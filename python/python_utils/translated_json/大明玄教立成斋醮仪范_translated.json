  "full_translation": "*The Ritual Norms for Establishing Daoist Offerings and Services of the Great Ming*\n*Scripture Title:* *The Ritual Norms for Establishing Daoist Offerings and Services of the Great Ming*\nCompiled by Song Zongzhen et al. of the Ming. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Division*, *Weiyi* (Ritual Propriety) category.\n\n**Imperial Preface to the Ritual Texts for Daoist Offerings and Services of the Mysterious Teaching**\n\nWe observe that the teachings of the Buddhists and Daoists each have two branches. Among the Buddhists, there are the Chan and the *jiao* (doctrinal schools). Among the Daoists, there are the Orthodox Unity and the Complete Perfection. Chan and Complete Perfection devote themselves to cultivating the body and nurturing nature, solely for their own sake. The *jiao* and Orthodox Unity, however, focus on transcending the mundane, specifically established for filial sons and compassionate parents. They benefit human relations and enrich customs—how great is their merit!\n\nThough the teachings of Confucius and the laws of the state are clear, rigorously honoring the virtuous and punishing the unworthy, there are still those who refuse to heed them. Even among those who do, how many act in accordance with principle? The two traditions of Buddhism and Daoism, however, are entirely free from the constraints of correcting faults or rectifying errors, yet the number of people who follow them without distinction is vast.\n\nIn the households of officials and commoners, when there is a funeral, without Buddhist monks or Daoist priests, it is difficult to conduct the rites of interment. If these two traditions are not employed for the funeral, then parents are deemed uncompassionate toward their children, and children are deemed unfilial toward their parents—bringing shame before neighbors and kin. This is why Confucius said: *\"In the West there is a Great Sage who governs without teaching\"*—this is precisely what he meant.\n\nYet today, those who instruct monks and Daoists act without principle, wantonly establishing rituals and ceremonies that neither accord with reason nor align with human sentiment.\n\nThe ignorant and unknowing populace blindly follows these ritual forms, engaging in three, five, or seven days and nights of chanting scriptures. These scriptures, which teach people to do good and refrain from evil in the Buddhist and Daoist traditions, are like the laws and decrees of the state. If chanting scriptures allows the spirits of the dead to hear them and thereby awaken their good intentions, this is acceptable. But if chanting scriptures is meant to absolve the dead of their sins—as if one could escape punishment for violating the law by reading the statutes—this is impossible. Such practices waste family resources, while the dull and foolish monks and Daoists take them as models of ritual perfection, exhausting their spirits in the process. Observing the rituals they perform, one finds errors in the texts and miswritten characters, which the learned then mock and deride. The reason for such ridicule is this: before the Buddha has been invited or the Three Pure Ones have arrived, they already face the wall to report the patron’s affairs. Monks may even proclaim these matters to the Buddha three times a day, while Daoists present their memorials thrice daily. From this, one might think Śākyamuni and Laozi are hard of hearing or blind, requiring such repeated address. If not for this, what possible reason could there be?\n\nLet the Ministry of Rites convene with Buddhist and Daoist clergy to establish standardized formats for their ritual forms, which shall then be disseminated everywhere for their observance. This would prevent the waste of poor families’ resources and preserve the spiritual vitality of monks and Daoists—would this not be excellent?\n\n*Preface to the* Ritual Forms for the Establishment of Daoist Offerings and Purifications *of the Great Ming, composed in the eleventh month of the seventh year of the Hongwu reign.*\n\nWhen divine tortoises and dragon-horses presented their charts and writings in response to enlightened eras, and when the nine phoenixes and eight simurghs sang in secret harmony with wondrous forms—then did the radiance of precious pearls shine forth, and the exalted jade tablets ascend in splendor. The thirty-six divisions, texts of profound mystery, could be pored over endlessly without exhaustion; the five thousand and more words, the essence of the *Dao* and *virtue*, aligned perfectly with the transformations of governance. Yet as the meaning of the scriptures grew obscure and their truth was lost, ritual forms were transmitted and gradually proliferated. A hundred schools arose in separate lineages, and through the ages their excesses overflowed. Where chants and praises multiplied, simplicity and sincerity were no longer upheld; where rites stretched day and night, devotion inevitably waned. Examined against the standards of ritual and music, they often transgressed proper bounds; measured against Heaven, Earth, and the gods, they risked irreverence.\n\nFortunately, a sage now reigns above, and the immortal Dao may be renewed. By the grace of His Majesty the Emperor—pure, serene, subtle, and profound; lofty, luminous, vast, and deep—all under Heaven is pacified, and the tribute of distant lands flows in like rivers converging in the Yangtze and Han. His reverence in serving the Supreme Lord is manifest in the suburban sacrifices; his rites of conciliation toward the hundred spirits move them to respond. Thus does he gather blessings for the common people and turn his divine attention to the two teachings.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the seventh year of the Hongwu reign, your servants Song Zongzhen, Zhao Yunzhong, Fu Tongxu, Deng Zhongxiu, Zhou Xuanzhen, and others, reverently obeying the imperial decree, compiled and streamlined the rituals of the Daoist tradition, establishing fixed regulations to present for the throne’s approval.\n\nWe, your servants Zongzhen and others, are of humble nature and shallow learning, yet presuming to undertake this task with due reverence, have compiled these ritual forms and now humbly submit the draft for presentation. Should it pass the scrutiny of the celestial gaze and receive the sagely decision of His Majesty, its implementation among the unseen and manifest realms would bring benefit and advantage—truly a blessing for the Daoist tradition through ten thousand generations.\n\nThe following is the ordered sequence of rites, with the ritual texts appended thereafter:\n\n*Established Rituals of the Mysterious Teaching for Fast and Offering in the Great Ming*\n\n**Three-Day Ritual for Deliverance of the Deceased: Daily Sequence**\n\n**First Day**\n*Dispatching the Talisman*\nPurification by sprinkling, ritual proceedings, summoning the generals, three libations of wine, reading the memorial, dispatching the generals, burning paper money, and dedication.\n\n*Raising the Banner*\nRitual proceedings, recitation of the white document, chanting of gāthās, intoning of scriptures, and dedication.\n\n*Establishing the Supervisors of the Altar and the Fast*\nRitual proceedings, recitation of the white document, intoning of scriptures, and dedication.\n\n*Arranging the Seats and Expounding the Scriptures*\nInviting the scriptures with ritual proceedings as prescribed, intoning the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*, the *Scripture of Salvation from Suffering*, and the *Scripture of Ascent to Heaven*.\n\n*Summoning at the Spirit Tablet*\nIncantation of food, intoning of scriptures, and dedication.\n\n*Establishing the Cold Forest Site*\nRitual proceedings, chanting of gāthās, summoning the orphaned souls and offering food, intoning of scriptures, and burning of paper money.\n\n**Second Day**\nPurification by sprinkling, ritual proceedings, and intoning of scriptures.\n\n*Rite of Repentance*\nEither the *Repentance Before Heaven*, the *Repentance of the Nine Dark Realms*, or the *Divination of the Three Officials*; incantation of food at the spirit tablet.

He scatters sweet dew to moisten and bedew, spreads auspicious clouds to shelter and embrace. Today, reverently following the mysterious title, we unfurl the resplendent pennant. Crimson characters trail radiance, universally illuminating the brightness of benighted thoroughfares; vast blessings absolve transgressions, widely extending the compassionate ferry of the Dharma sea. We bow our heads in reverence, take refuge, and extol with praise and chant.\n\n**Mantra Pennant**\nEastern Florescence, wondrous and solemn, manifests myriad merciful forms. Dwelling in eternal joy, seated upon the golden lotus, wisdom-light shines unimpeded, illuminating the dark springs. Withered skeletons and decayed bones all attain luminous freshness. Sweet dew flows and moistens, pervading the empty mystery. Those sunk in the depths are delivered, no longer stagnant in the frigid abyss.\n\n**Chanting the Gāthā**\nAuspicious clouds weave this numinous pennant,\nits shadow cast upon the floating void, dispersing through the world.\nAs soon as the ethereal wind stirs,\nall sentient beings escape the dark barriers.\n\n**Chanting the Sūtra – Dedication**\n\n**Inviting the Altar Overseer**\nWe humbly acknowledge that within the Three Realms, each position is ordained by the true sovereign; within this region, merit necessarily relies upon the divine luminaries. Moreover, as this purification rite is solemnly conducted, we reverently invoke the protective guardianship of the altar overseer, all majestic spirits, their awe-inspiring presence manifest, their numinous power towering. They uphold the luminous mind of impartial integrity, wielding the handle of fortune and misfortune, good and ill. All spirits submit to their sway; every being takes refuge. Whatever sincerity is offered must meet with response. We humbly hope that cloud-banners gleam in the sunlight, wind-horses are harnessed to descend; that immortal retinues soar through the sky, dispelling malevolent vapors to ensure solemn stillness. May they bear witness to the purification rite, suppress disturbances in the sacred precinct, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.\n\n**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Inviting the Purification Overseer**\n\nThus, the Dao holds purification rites as foremost, requiring offerings of utmost purity; sincerity deems ritual as paramount, demanding meticulous preparation in culinary arts. To ensure the kitchen’s offerings remain solemn and pristine, we must rely on the awe-inspiring presence of the deities to oversee and govern. We humbly beseech the numinous ones to descend, wielding their silent authority to suppress disorder; may the Dharma’s essence be refined, free from the taint of discordant vapors. May the purification rite be accomplished, the sacrificial rites perfected, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.\n\n**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Arranging the Seats and Expounding the Sūtra**\n\nIt is said: The Primordial One Qi gave rise to all heavens. The illumination of the Three Luminaries is the root of the sky. Above, there is no ancestor—only the Dao is its body. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao are beyond conception. Neither existent as existence nor nonexistent as nonexistence, it manifests throughout the ten directions, nurturing the myriad beings. Like the moon embracing all waters, its reflection is perfectly complete; like clouds receding from the vast sky, the boundless void remains unimpeded. Eternally tranquil and serene, abstruse and profound, it saves the world without limit, liberates beings without measure.\n\nToday, the filial devotee, in remembrance of the departed, knows that illusory forms perish while the true nature endures. Though all beings are fundamentally equal, not transcending the singular true essence, yet through eons of karmic defilement, how could they be free from the dust of the Three Poisons? Without the guidance of the Dharma’s teachings, how might they ascend to the celestial realms? Therefore, we expound the wondrous scriptures of the profound mystery, thereby illuminating the radiant wisdom of the *Lingbao*. As the pearl-like grains manifest, they summon the vibrant presence of immortals; where the jade celestial sphere pauses, one beholds the profound vastness of the great Dao. The Dharma assembly, reverent and devout, requests the scriptures in accordance with ritual.\n\n**Requesting the Sūtra – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra**\n*The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Salvation of All – The Scripture of the Generation of the Spirit – The Scripture of Salvation from Suffering – The Scripture of Ascension to Heaven*\n\nBefore the spirit tablet, we recite the offering of consecrated food:\nThe chapter on the spontaneous generation of the spirit unfolds the great abundance of the numinous scripture. For all sentient beings, we proclaim the esoteric mantras. We reverently invite the departed spirits, their minds stilled in solemn reverence. Today, we offer this Dharma food; may they deign to partake.\n\nFor the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the *Lingbao* invocation of compassion and wisdom, we chant:\nWe bow to the Radiant Wisdom of the Void and Supreme, we bow to the Lord of the Profound Mystery. You fashion heaven and earth, yet none can describe Your merit; You are the refuge and support of all beings. With compassion, You turn the Five Paths of the wheel of rebirth; with mercy, You rescue those suffering in the Three Realms of hell. We take refuge in the Azure Mystery of the Eastern Summit, we take refuge in the Compassionate Father of the Six Paths. We take refuge in the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Lords, forever freed from birth and death, transcending existence and entering the void without reliance. You enable the withered and decayed to become immortals. Through countless eons, such an encounter is rare; for the multitudes, You broadly expound the causes of karma. You revive the dead, granting eternal abiding, ensuring their form and spirit remain unchanged. Dispelling the suffering of the long night, releasing torment in the Three Realms. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance, its merit beyond conception. A single sprinkle of sweet dew, like heat finding coolness. The spirit ascends to the Great Canopy, its blessings extending to all.\n\nFor the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the mantras for purifying Fengdu, shattering hell, departing the cold courts, and ascending as immortals:\nVast and boundless is Fengdu, layered with mountains of vajra. The boundless light of the *Lingbao* illumines the scorching pools of suffering. The seven generations of ancestors and all lost souls, their bodies follow the fragrant cloud-banners. With the wisdom of samādhi and the blue lotus, they ascend to the eternal peace of the spirit. The golden light of merit gently opens the gates of darkness. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance; the lotus canopy drifts upon the clouds. The immortals chant the mysterious scriptures, ever dwelling in the Twelve Towers. Hasten to uphold the *Lingbao* mantra, roam freely in the celestial paradise. The cold courts hold much sorrow; turning back, they pay homage to the subtle mystery. The talisman of the Azure Lady and the *Lingbao*, inscribed by the divine of Mount Zhong. With a single thought, ascend to the Great Clarity; silently recite, contemplating the Supreme Void. Merit accrues to the Nine Dark Realms below, gradually rebirthing in the Purple Void.\n\n**Mantra for Nurturing the Spirit and Cultivating the Soul**\nThe spirit mushroom has no root, the source of all wonders. Within, it congeals the seven *po*, internally binds the three *hun*. The Twenty-Four Perfected Ones enter and exit without gate. In the abstruse and obscure, the primordial essence flickers. Through kalpas of existence and decay, it arises with the qi. Externally, it solidifies the primordial chaos; internally, it nourishes the Seven Perfected. The five spirits plant their blossoms; the Three Terraces unfold their glory. The Purple Chamber and the White Youth guide the soul back to infancy. Ascending upon clouds, drifting with the mist in the void. Within, the Jade Perfected, known as the Divine Elder. To the left, embracing the Peerless; to the right, guarded by the White Prime. The Dark Beast blocks the rear; the Vermilion Phoenix escorts the front. Above, the emerald canopy floats; below, the golden lotus supports. Fragrant clouds congeal in the sky; sweet dew flows without end. Inexhaustible in use, tracing its source without end.\n\n**Mantra for Opening the Towered Chambers with the Qi of the Three Luminaries**\nThe vast essence generates the Dharma qi, misty and dense in the midst of heaven. The two luminaries together shine clear; the five planets intermingle and communicate. The Three Luminaries blaze with brilliance; the precious qi congeals in the Three Palaces. The immortal realm gathers the Nine Elders; swallowing and absorbing, the hundred bones flourish. The golden blossom illuminates the light and shadow; the body harmonizes with creation. Aligning with the Dao and the natural, through ten thousand kalpas, life is endless.\n\n**Mantra for Empowering the Dharma Food**\nTurning back, we gaze upon the Mystic Canopy, merging with the radiance to grasp the numinous splendor. Restraining the *hun* and controlling the seven *po*, contemplating and settling at the center. In movement and stillness, we pay homage to the Void; in rest and repose, we feast in the Mystic Chamber. Hungry, we dine on yellow and azure blossoms; thirsty, we drink the nectar of the jade grove. The spirit and essence ascend to the Great Canopy, uniting the body to refine the true light. Reflecting again upon the Supreme Void, ever roaming the emptiness. The profound interpenetrates beyond the bounds of waves; the true transformation knows no interval. Subtle and boundless, without end or beginning—those who practice shall know for themselves. In silence, we forget doctrines and teachings; responding to the moment, we reveal the subtle mystery. The descent of the Dao does not summon itself; it must first be bestowed. Converging without dual paths, following the heart’s intent, they unite or part.\n\n**Mantra for Universally Offering the Dharma Food**\nFragrant smoke disperses to the ten directions; blossoms open in the lotus chambers. The kalpa grove’s precious fruits, the immortals’ sweet dew nectar. The natural offerings of the fragrant kitchen, the wondrous jade liquid beyond measure. We now universally offer, carefree in the halls of supreme blessing.\n\nDevotedly cultivate the great Daoist methods,\nWith focused heart, one senses the Great Darkness.\nYellow blossoms descend with true qi,\nThe five viscera knit the embryonic infant.\nSeven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,\nCountless souls soar to the Supreme Clarity.\nBlessings and benefits pervade without exception—\nThis food is offered to all beings.\n\n**Chanting Sutras | Transforming Wealth | Dedication**\nAt the Cold Grove site:\n\n**Reciting the Verse**\nTalismanic commands traverse the vast and obscure,\nDivine banners flutter in the dawn wind.\nThe spirit transcends the Northern Bureau,\nFlying sandals ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\nWith sincere intent, summon universally:\nThe Three Wicked Realms, the Nine Nights,\nThe Six Paths, the Four Births,\nThe spiritually endowed yet unenshrined,\nThe male and female souls in darkness.\n\nMay they, by the power of the Three Treasures\nAnd the compassion of the Three Treasures,\nAt this day and this hour,\nCome and attend the Dharma assembly.\n\n**Offering Food | Reception | Chanting Sutras**\n\n**The Second Day**\nPurification | Dharma Rites | Reciting the Previous Sutras\nRepentance Rituals | Raising Reverent Praise | Each participant bows in respect\n\n**The Three Refuges**\nWith sincere heart, take refuge in the Three Treasures of the ten directions.\nMay the departed spirits arise in mind and dedicate,\nAll paying reverence in faith.\n\n**Seated Praise**\nThe assembly of the Daoist altar,\nHolding tablets before their hearts,\nPerform repentance according to the Dharma.\n\nRecite repentance texts—whether the *Repentance to Heaven*,\nThe *Nine Darknesses Repentance*, or the *Three Officials Repentance*.\n\n**Incantation for Food Before the Spirit Tablet** (as before)\nUntil evening, offer food to the solitary and forsaken.\n\n**Reciting the Verse | Burning Talismans**\nThe gate of greatness opens to the mysterious,\nThe fragrant heavens descend in divine radiance.\nYellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,\nYin and yang’s qi and signs intermingle.\n\nWith sincere intent, summon universally:\nThe Three Wicked Realms, the Nine Nights,\nThe Six Paths, the Four Births,\nScholars, farmers, artisans, merchants,\nCivil and martial, physicians and diviners,\nThe thousand trades, the myriad classes,\nThe hundred schools, the nine streams,\nThe spiritually endowed yet unenshrined,\nThe male and female souls in darkness.\n\nMay they, by the power of the Three Treasures\nAnd the compassion of the Three Treasures,\nAt this night and this hour,\nCome and attend the Dharma assembly.\n\n**Incantation for the Food Vessel | Chanting Sutras**\n\n**The Third Day**\n\n**Ritual Proceedings**\n\n**Consecrating Water and Purifying the Altar | Inviting the Master | Invoking the Divine and Communing with Intent | Placing the Five Directions’ True Talismans for Pacification | Proclaiming the Talismanic Petition | Sealing the Lamps | Summoning the Departed | Bathing and Robing | Paying Reverence | Consecrating the Food and Dedication | Aiding the Forlorn and Offering the Food Vessel | Establishing the Numinous Treasure’s Food-Offering Rite | Extolling the Most Supreme Unity, the Compassionate Savior Lord**\n\nBurning the talismans, sprinkling purification:\nThe fragrance of pure virtue and power knows no distance unreached;\nIn the vastness of the Great Void’s expanse, response arises where feeling stirs.\n\nOn this day, as we establish the fast and open the Dharma banquet for [Name],\nUniversally aiding the souls in darkness,\nWe reverently await the descent of compassionate radiance to grant deliverance.\nMay the nine gloomy realms’ lingering souls all receive the merit of liberation;\nMay the six paths’ spirit-souls all attain the fruit of carefree wandering.\nThe Dharma assembly takes refuge and extols the merit and power.\n\n**Extolling the Most Supreme Unity, the Compassionate Savior Lord**\n\nWe have heard:\nQi waxes and wanes, the myriad forms emerge and vanish.\nDeath follows life, and life follows death;\nHumans become ghosts, and ghosts become humans,\nEndlessly revolving, ceaselessly repaying.\nNo sorrow surpasses that of the six paths,\nNo suffering exceeds that of the four births.\nThose lacking in goodness struggle to ascend the steps of virtue,\nWhile those who accumulate evil descend into evil realms.\nYet by the grace of our Mysterious Ancestor,\nYou are rescued from sinking,\nAs the rites of vast deliverance are spread,\nAnd the great assembly for transcendence is opened.\n\nAt the juncture when yin darkens and yang brightens,\nWhen spirits commune and ghosts gather,\nSouls stir and mournful winds arise,\nDivine echoes resound and yin mists gather.\nAt the first resounding cry, the dark earth hears from afar.\n\nWe look up to the Purple Pole’s Mysterious Lord,\nThe Father of the Azure Flower’s Teachings,\nWho points to the bright star as a torch of wisdom,\nBroadly extending its illumination;\nWho condenses the qi of Brahma to form the Dharma Bridge,\nGreatly bestowing deliverance.\n\nThe messengers of soul-summoning proclaim to the ten directions,\nCalling upon the earth deities of their jurisdiction to hasten and urge.\nMay those of the Heavenly Immortals’ Dao,\nThe Divine Spirits’ Dao,\nThe Human Relations’ Dao,\nThe Hell Dao,\nThe Hungry Ghost Dao,\nThe Animal Dao,\nAnd all living beings—fish, turtles, insects—\nIn the blink of an eye, be universally informed across the high and deep;\nIn this fleeting moment, be made aware near and far.\nNaturally, intent moves and sincerity responds,\nShadow follows echo.\n\nSummoning the many to lead the multitudes,\nVoices respond as qi seeks its kind;\nEmerging from death to enter life,\nThe faint of sight may see, the lame may walk.\nUnobstructed and unhindered, they come flowing forth;\nSome lag behind, some press ahead, arriving in measured pace.\nThe messengers exert their power of summoning,\nWhile the souls receive the merit of this calling.\n\nAll spirits of the Dao of Opening Karma, heed now the sacred chant.\nRecite the Fengdu incantation, burn the Summoning Soul talisman,\nInvoke the Most High Compassionate Savior, the Merciful Honored One.\nSummon the forsaken—chant the verse:\n\nThe Great Tenuous returns the Yellow Banner,\nThe Peerless commands the Spirit Pennant.\nGather and call from the Long Night’s abode,\nOpen the passage for souls to receive rebirth.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, summon universally:\nThe nine provinces’ domains, the ten kinds’ river sands,\nThose struck down by thunder, devoured by tigers and wolves,\nSlain by blade and slaughter, perished in childbirth or battle,\nSpirits without rites, the lost souls of men and women.\nMay they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,\nThis very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, summon universally:\nThose who drowned in rivers or wells, swept away by floods,\nConsumed by conflagrations, wandering in famine,\nStricken by plague and pestilence, hanged or slain by their own hand,\nSpirits without offerings, the lost souls of men and women.\nMay they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,\nThis very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, summon universally:\nAll across the ten directions’ empty realms, throughout the wilds,\nThe souls of those who died far from home, the ghosts of violent demise,\nDry bones and rotting remains, the lost souls of men and women.\nMay they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,\nThis very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.\n\nBathe in the recitation of mantras, burn the spirit garments,\nBurn the talismans of absolution, empower the offering of food.\n\nThe Scripture of the Five Kitchens\n\nQi harmonizes in supreme harmony,\nAttaining the One, the Dao brings all to peace.\nHarmony is not one harmony—\nMysterious principle merges with the boundless mystery.\nDo not think thoughts with thought,\nNor seek the absence of thought.\nThought without further reflection—\nThis is the Dharma held thus.\nDo not bind the mind to the mind,\nNor dwell in absolute detachment.\nWhen the mind is present, do not fixate on mind;\nIn truth, guard the abyss of truth.\nCultivate detachment from intent, yet detach not from intent,\nFor accumulated practice must not diverge from detachment.\nIntent without cultivation of intent—\nOne’s karma remains unknown even to oneself.\n\nAll consume qi to bind qi,\nYet none bind it through prolonged stillness.\nQi returns to its original qi;\nTake as you should, discharge as you must.\n\nScattering the offering of food,\nRecite the invocation to the Most High, the Merciful Savior,\nHere performing the talismanic rite of refinement and deliverance.\n\nTransmission of the Precepts\n\nThe Dao says: Precepts are cessation.\nThey serve to halt the mind’s transgressions,\nReturning it to right concentration—\nThus precepts give rise to concentration.\nThe Confucians also speak of “knowing cessation,\nThen attaining concentration.”\nYet the scriptures of the Three Caverns,\nThe four auxiliary esoteric texts,\nExpound preceptual Dharmas in myriad forms.\nOnly the Supreme Cavernous Mystery, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Numinous Treasure,\nStand as the foremost of all precepts.\nRevered by heaven and humanity,\nUpheld by the hidden and the manifest,\nSupreme above the supreme,\nMysterious within the mysterious,\nSpiritual among the myriad spirits,\nThe treasure of the singular qi,\nWondrously pervading the Three Realms,\nThe precepts restrain the six emotions.\nTheir number fixed by yang,\nThey are divided into nine.\nCultivated without pretense,\nThey are thus called the Twofold Real.\nImmortals and mortals look to them as their fortress;\nThe hidden and manifest rely on them as their bridge.\n\nThe soul receives them as Dharma-medicine.\nYet the method of receiving precepts begins with stillness and silence;\nThe method of upholding precepts exalts diligent reverence.\nThe assembly of Dharma devotees takes refuge together,\nWith unified sincerity in praise and chant.\n\nEach person must show reverence—\nThe Three Refuges are precisely refuge in the Dao,\nRefuge in the scriptures,\nAnd refuge in the master.\nThus all souls ought to believe and venerate.\n\n**The Three Refuges**\nOnce refuge is taken, the precepts are about to be transmitted.\nThe netherworld brightens as if spring has returned;\nKarmic grievances melt like ice dissolved.\nSin’s blossoms wither, merit’s fruit ripens.\nThe assembly of Dharma devotees, having taken refuge,\nShall now receive the Nine Precepts:\n\nThe First Precept: Be diligent, loyal to the sovereign;\nThe Second Precept: Be respectful and yielding, filial in supporting parents;\nThe Third Precept: Do not kill, but compassionately save all beings;\nThe Fourth Precept: Do not engage in licentiousness, but rectify the body and dwell rightly among things;\nThe Fifth Precept: Do not steal, but extend righteousness and diminish the self;\nThe Sixth Precept: Do not harbor wrath, nor oppress others with fury;\nThe Seventh Precept: Do not deceive, nor flatter, harm, or betray the good;\nThe Eighth Precept: Do not be arrogant, nor scorn the most essential;\nThe Ninth Precept: Do not waver, but uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.\n\nThe wondrous precepts, the numinous text,\nInscribed on yellow registers and white tablets,\nHaving been fully expounded in the sacred canon,\nAre now to be reverently received in their spiritual form.\n\nThe heart is hard to restrain,\nYet restrained by the Nine Precepts, it may return to the Great Void.\nThe form has not yet transcended,\nYet transcended by the Two Talismans, it may refine itself in the upper realms.\nThe departed soul must be reborn;\nWhile living, do not forget the precepts.\nThrough kalpas, ever uphold the talismanic covenant.\n\nCalm the spirit beyond the material world,\nSevering worldly ties across many lives;\nReceiving form in the yang realm,\nGood fruits naturally gather like ice congealing.\nFragrance lingers in the present,\nBlessings extend without end.\nBowing to the Merciful Venerable One,\nThe feast concludes, and the departed is sent forth.\n\nRecite the talismanic memorial,\nSend off the departed,\nTransform the paper offerings,\nAnd dedicate the merit.\n\nThe Ritual of the Three Offerings for Salvation and the Jiao Sacrifice\n\nRecite the incantations, declare the ranks, and with the Dharma Master [Name] and the assembled ritualists of this altar, we reverently and sincerely invoke:\n\nThe Boundless and Spontaneous, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao; the Azure Empyrean Savior of Suffering, the Merciful Venerable One; the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm; the Patriarchal Perfected Sovereign of Orthodox Unity, the Serene and Responsive True Lord; the Ancestral Perfected Master; the Masters of the Scriptures and Salvation; and all the Perfected Ones of the ranks—may the numinous altar respond to our invocation, and all majestic spirits attend.\n\nWe have heard:\nIn the cloud-palace of the Dharma-realm, above, we gaze upon the radiance of the Eastern Pole;\nIn the wind-marsh of the hollow void, below, we reach the bounds of the Northern Yin.\nNo scrutiny escapes the net of law, yet the handle of the Dipper opens the mysterious rites.\nRelying on the cinnabar tablet, the soul is led from darkness, and delusion is shattered;\nAided by the jade gaze, the form is refined, and the luminous spirit is perfected as true.\nThe Merciful Venerable One’s vow-power is vast and deep; the benevolent hearts of immortals and sages shine forth.\nAs this rite is established, resonance arises with life, and transformation brings carefree wandering.\nIn the Purple Court and the Pure Capital, our reverent aspirations are fully expressed;\nFrom the muddy streams and flowing waters, our humble devotion is wholly offered.\nWe humbly pray that feathered winds sweep away the dust, cloud chariots drift upon the light,\nManifesting in response to beings and circumstances, like the moon mirrored in a thousand rivers,\nSoaring through the void, riding the qi in flight.\nMay the fragrance drift to the eight directions, and benevolent grace flow abundantly.\nWitness our reverence and sincerity, and accept our earnest devotion.\nWe now present the First Offering.\n\n**First Offering Rites**\nWe have heard:\nThe limitless and boundless are unfathomable in their mysterious subtlety;\nLife and death follow one another like night and day.\nYet the divergence of delusion and awakening leads to the distinction of ascent and descent.\nWe contemplate the suffering of the dark, copper-bound prisons, where some fall into confinement;\nWe gaze upon the compassionate light of the Azure Empyrean’s lotus throne, where salvation is sought.\nThus, we follow the immortal models, bathing and refining the form and soul.\nTranscending the unceasing cycles of birth and transformation, we dare not delay in offering our devotion.\nThe waxen lamps’ wicks unfold nine-colored auspicious radiance;\nThe pine flowers of the ritual mat sincerely move the assembly of the Perfected.\nIn solemn and reverent order, we again offer our earnest devotion,\nAnd now present the Second Offering.\n\n**Second Offering Rites**\nWe have heard:\nThe luminous wisdom of the Mystic Clarity flows endlessly through the teachings;\nCarefree joy and bliss belong to the transcended souls who find their return.\nRescuing the hidden and manifest, we revive with clarity;\nHolding fast to sincerity, we are fervent in our plea.\nThe grace of the waves is profound, deeply bestowed and felt;\nThe bright water is offered with humility, though our gifts are meager.\nMay the departed soul swiftly shed karmic retribution and forever sever clinging attachments.\nIn the moonlight’s radiance, may they awaken to their original nature;\nIn the realms of humans and gods, may they be reborn in bodies of blessed wisdom.\nNow, the filial devotee [Name], moved by sincerity, fulfills their vows.\nMay the three disasters and eight difficulties silently vanish, and auspicious blessings ever abide;\nMay a hundred harmonies and a thousand blessings converge, and every step be luminous.\nWith wholehearted devotion, we present the wine of the Final Offering.\n\n**Third Offering Rites**\nRecite the memorial.\nSend forth the spirits.\n\nBowing in reverence, we affirm that the Dao rejects nothing, ever cleansing and uplifting without fail; rites possess their proper forms, and we are fortunate that this offering is now complete. The fragrant wine in the cup, clear and deep, has been poured, while the sinking water-clock’s arrow hastens on. Dust and defilement shame us, mere mortals; how could the swift wings of the divine ever pause for our entreaties? The visions of cloud and sky are truly beyond our full grasp; the profound grace of the cosmos still ever relies upon its sheltering care. We, [Names], can scarcely contain our longing and devotion, and so with utmost reverence we bow twice and humbly send forth the spirits.\n\n**Burning of Paper Offerings** | **Full Dispersal of Offerings**\n\nThe *Rites for the Establishment of the Fast and Offering* of the Great Ming Mysterious Teachings are now concluded.",

One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Division*, *Weiyi* (Ritual Propriety) category.\n\n**Imperial Preface to the Ritual Texts for Daoist Offerings and Services of the Mysterious Teaching**\n\nWe observe that the teachings of the Buddhists and Daoists each have two branches. Among the Buddhists, there are the Chan and the *jiao* (doctrinal schools). Among the Daoists, there are the Orthodox Unity and the Complete Perfection. Chan and Complete Perfection devote themselves to cultivating the body and nurturing nature, solely for their own sake. The *jiao* and Orthodox Unity, however, focus on transcending the mundane, specifically established for filial sons and compassionate parents. They benefit human relations and enrich customs—how great is their merit!\n\nThough the teachings of Confucius and the laws of the state are clear, rigorously honoring the virtuous and punishing the unworthy, there are still those who refuse to heed them. Even among those who do, how many act in accordance with principle? The two traditions of Buddhism and Daoism, however, are entirely free from the constraints of correcting faults or rectifying errors, yet the number of people who follow them without distinction is vast.\n\nIn the households of officials and commoners, when there is a funeral, without Buddhist monks or Daoist priests, it is difficult to conduct the rites of interment. If these two traditions are not employed for the funeral, then parents are deemed uncompassionate toward their children, and children are deemed unfilial toward their parents—bringing shame before neighbors and kin. This is why Confucius said: *\"In the West there is a Great Sage who governs without teaching\"*—this is precisely what he meant.\n\nYet today, those who instruct monks and Daoists act without principle, wantonly establishing rituals and ceremonies that neither accord with reason nor align with human sentiment.",

      "translated_text": "The ignorant and unknowing populace blindly follows these ritual forms, engaging in three, five, or seven days and nights of chanting scriptures. These scriptures, which teach people to do good and refrain from evil in the Buddhist and Daoist traditions, are like the laws and decrees of the state. If chanting scriptures allows the spirits of the dead to hear them and thereby awaken their good intentions, this is acceptable. But if chanting scriptures is meant to absolve the dead of their sins—as if one could escape punishment for violating the law by reading the statutes—this is impossible. Such practices waste family resources, while the dull and foolish monks and Daoists take them as models of ritual perfection, exhausting their spirits in the process. Observing the rituals they perform, one finds errors in the texts and miswritten characters, which the learned then mock and deride. The reason for such ridicule is this: before the Buddha has been invited or the Three Pure Ones have arrived, they already face the wall to report the patron’s affairs. Monks may even proclaim these matters to the Buddha three times a day, while Daoists present their memorials thrice daily. From this, one might think Śākyamuni and Laozi are hard of hearing or blind, requiring such repeated address. If not for this, what possible reason could there be?\n\nLet the Ministry of Rites convene with Buddhist and Daoist clergy to establish standardized formats for their ritual forms, which shall then be disseminated everywhere for their observance. This would prevent the waste of poor families’ resources and preserve the spiritual vitality of monks and Daoists—would this not be excellent?\n\n*Preface to the* Ritual Forms for the Establishment of Daoist Offerings and Purifications *of the Great Ming, composed in the eleventh month of the seventh year of the Hongwu reign.*",

The thirty-six divisions, texts of profound mystery, could be pored over endlessly without exhaustion; the five thousand and more words, the essence of the *Dao* and *virtue*, aligned perfectly with the transformations of governance. Yet as the meaning of the scriptures grew obscure and their truth was lost, ritual forms were transmitted and gradually proliferated. A hundred schools arose in separate lineages, and through the ages their excesses overflowed. Where chants and praises multiplied, simplicity and sincerity were no longer upheld; where rites stretched day and night, devotion inevitably waned. Examined against the standards of ritual and music, they often transgressed proper bounds; measured against Heaven, Earth, and the gods, they risked irreverence.\n\nFortunately, a sage now reigns above, and the immortal Dao may be renewed. By the grace of His Majesty the Emperor—pure, serene, subtle, and profound; lofty, luminous, vast, and deep—all under Heaven is pacified, and the tribute of distant lands flows in like rivers converging in the Yangtze and Han.

      "translated_text": "**Liturgical Text – Plain Prose**\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the Great Unity, the Merciful Venerable One, broadly bestows boundless grace; the great thousandfold world all depends on his salvific benevolence. He scatters sweet dew to moisten and bedew, spreads auspicious clouds to shelter and embrace. Today, reverently following the mysterious title, we unfurl the resplendent pennant. Crimson characters trail radiance, universally illuminating the brightness of benighted thoroughfares; vast blessings absolve transgressions, widely extending the compassionate ferry of the Dharma sea. We bow our heads in reverence, take refuge, and extol with praise and chant.\n\n**Mantra Pennant**\nEastern Florescence, wondrous and solemn, manifests myriad merciful forms. Dwelling in eternal joy, seated upon the golden lotus, wisdom-light shines unimpeded, illuminating the dark springs. Withered skeletons and decayed bones all attain luminous freshness. Sweet dew flows and moistens, pervading the empty mystery. Those sunk in the depths are delivered, no longer stagnant in the frigid abyss.\n\n**Chanting the Gāthā**\nAuspicious clouds weave this numinous pennant,\nits shadow cast upon the floating void, dispersing through the world.\nAs soon as the ethereal wind stirs,\nall sentient beings escape the dark barriers.\n\n**Chanting the Sūtra – Dedication**\n\n**Inviting the Altar Overseer**\nWe humbly acknowledge that within the Three Realms, each position is ordained by the true sovereign; within this region, merit necessarily relies upon the divine luminaries. Moreover, as this purification rite is solemnly conducted, we reverently invoke the protective guardianship of the altar overseer, all majestic spirits, their awe-inspiring presence manifest, their numinous power towering. They uphold the luminous mind of impartial integrity, wielding the handle of fortune and misfortune, good and ill. All spirits submit to their sway; every being takes refuge. Whatever sincerity is offered must meet with response. We humbly hope that cloud-banners gleam in the sunlight, wind-horses are harnessed to descend; that immortal retinues soar through the sky, dispelling malevolent vapors to ensure solemn stillness. May they bear witness to the purification rite, suppress disturbances in the sacred precinct, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.\n\n**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Inviting the Purification Overseer**",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Dao holds purification rites as foremost, requiring offerings of utmost purity; sincerity deems ritual as paramount, demanding meticulous preparation in culinary arts. To ensure the kitchen’s offerings remain solemn and pristine, we must rely on the awe-inspiring presence of the deities to oversee and govern. We humbly beseech the numinous ones to descend, wielding their silent authority to suppress disorder; may the Dharma’s essence be refined, free from the taint of discordant vapors. May the purification rite be accomplished, the sacrificial rites perfected, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.\n\n**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Arranging the Seats and Expounding the Sūtra**\n\nIt is said: The Primordial One Qi gave rise to all heavens. The illumination of the Three Luminaries is the root of the sky. Above, there is no ancestor—only the Dao is its body. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao are beyond conception. Neither existent as existence nor nonexistent as nonexistence, it manifests throughout the ten directions, nurturing the myriad beings. Like the moon embracing all waters, its reflection is perfectly complete; like clouds receding from the vast sky, the boundless void remains unimpeded. Eternally tranquil and serene, abstruse and profound, it saves the world without limit, liberates beings without measure.\n\nToday, the filial devotee, in remembrance of the departed, knows that illusory forms perish while the true nature endures. Though all beings are fundamentally equal, not transcending the singular true essence, yet through eons of karmic defilement, how could they be free from the dust of the Three Poisons? Without the guidance of the Dharma’s teachings, how might they ascend to the celestial realms? Therefore, we expound the wondrous scriptures of the profound mystery, thereby illuminating the radiant wisdom of the *Lingbao*. As the pearl-like grains manifest, they summon the vibrant presence of immortals; where the jade celestial sphere pauses, one beholds the profound vastness of the great Dao. The Dharma assembly, reverent and devout, requests the scriptures in accordance with ritual.\n\n**Requesting the Sūtra – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra**\n*The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Salvation of All – The Scripture of the Generation of the Spirit – The Scripture of Salvation from Suffering – The Scripture of Ascension to Heaven*\n\nBefore the spirit tablet, we recite the offering of consecrated food:\nThe chapter on the spontaneous generation of the spirit unfolds the great abundance of the numinous scripture. For all sentient beings, we proclaim the esoteric mantras. We reverently invite the departed spirits, their minds stilled in solemn reverence. Today, we offer this Dharma food; may they deign to partake.\n\nFor the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the *Lingbao* invocation of compassion and wisdom, we chant:\nWe bow to the Radiant Wisdom of the Void and Supreme, we bow to the Lord of the Profound Mystery. You fashion heaven and earth, yet none can describe Your merit; You are the refuge and support of all beings. With compassion, You turn the Five Paths of the wheel of rebirth; with mercy, You rescue those suffering in the Three Realms of hell. We take refuge in the Azure Mystery of the Eastern Summit, we take refuge in the Compassionate Father of the Six Paths. We take refuge in the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Lords, forever freed from birth and death, transcending existence and entering the void without reliance. You enable the withered and decayed to become immortals. Through countless eons, such an encounter is rare; for the multitudes, You broadly expound the causes of karma. You revive the dead, granting eternal abiding, ensuring their form and spirit remain unchanged. Dispelling the suffering of the long night, releasing torment in the Three Realms. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance, its merit beyond conception. A single sprinkle of sweet dew, like heat finding coolness. The spirit ascends to the Great Canopy, its blessings extending to all.\n\nFor the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the mantras for purifying Fengdu, shattering hell, departing the cold courts, and ascending as immortals:\nVast and boundless is Fengdu, layered with mountains of vajra. The boundless light of the *Lingbao* illumines the scorching pools of suffering. The seven generations of ancestors and all lost souls, their bodies follow the fragrant cloud-banners. With the wisdom of samādhi and the blue lotus, they ascend to the eternal peace of the spirit. The golden light of merit gently opens the gates of darkness. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance; the lotus canopy drifts upon the clouds. The immortals chant the mysterious scriptures, ever dwelling in the Twelve Towers. Hasten to uphold the *Lingbao* mantra, roam freely in the celestial paradise. The cold courts hold much sorrow; turning back, they pay homage to the subtle mystery. The talisman of the Azure Lady and the *Lingbao*, inscribed by the divine of Mount Zhong. With a single thought, ascend to the Great Clarity; silently recite, contemplating the Supreme Void. Merit accrues to the Nine Dark Realms below, gradually rebirthing in the Purple Void.\n\n**Mantra for Nurturing the Spirit and Cultivating the Soul**\nThe spirit mushroom has no root, the source of all wonders. Within, it congeals the seven *po*, internally binds the three *hun*. The Twenty-Four Perfected Ones enter and exit without gate. In the abstruse and obscure, the primordial essence flickers. Through kalpas of existence and decay, it arises with the qi. Externally, it solidifies the primordial chaos; internally, it nourishes the Seven Perfected. The five spirits plant their blossoms; the Three Terraces unfold their glory. The Purple Chamber and the White Youth guide the soul back to infancy. Ascending upon clouds, drifting with the mist in the void. Within, the Jade Perfected, known as the Divine Elder. To the left, embracing the Peerless; to the right, guarded by the White Prime. The Dark Beast blocks the rear; the Vermilion Phoenix escorts the front. Above, the emerald canopy floats; below, the golden lotus supports. Fragrant clouds congeal in the sky; sweet dew flows without end. Inexhaustible in use, tracing its source without end.\n\n**Mantra for Opening the Towered Chambers with the Qi of the Three Luminaries**\nThe vast essence generates the Dharma qi, misty and dense in the midst of heaven. The two luminaries together shine clear; the five planets intermingle and communicate. The Three Luminaries blaze with brilliance; the precious qi congeals in the Three Palaces. The immortal realm gathers the Nine Elders; swallowing and absorbing, the hundred bones flourish. The golden blossom illuminates the light and shadow; the body harmonizes with creation. Aligning with the Dao and the natural, through ten thousand kalpas, life is endless.\n\n**Mantra for Empowering the Dharma Food**\nTurning back, we gaze upon the Mystic Canopy, merging with the radiance to grasp the numinous splendor. Restraining the *hun* and controlling the seven *po*, contemplating and settling at the center. In movement and stillness, we pay homage to the Void; in rest and repose, we feast in the Mystic Chamber. Hungry, we dine on yellow and azure blossoms; thirsty, we drink the nectar of the jade grove. The spirit and essence ascend to the Great Canopy, uniting the body to refine the true light. Reflecting again upon the Supreme Void, ever roaming the emptiness. The profound interpenetrates beyond the bounds of waves; the true transformation knows no interval. Subtle and boundless, without end or beginning—those who practice shall know for themselves. In silence, we forget doctrines and teachings; responding to the moment, we reveal the subtle mystery. The descent of the Dao does not summon itself; it must first be bestowed. Converging without dual paths, following the heart’s intent, they unite or part.\n\n**Mantra for Universally Offering the Dharma Food**\nFragrant smoke disperses to the ten directions; blossoms open in the lotus chambers. The kalpa grove’s precious fruits, the immortals’ sweet dew nectar. The natural offerings of the fragrant kitchen, the wondrous jade liquid beyond measure. We now universally offer, carefree in the halls of supreme blessing.",
