Composed by Li Daochun of the Yuan dynasty; compiled by his disciples Chai Yuangao et al.\nSource of base text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Tai Xuan* Section.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Recorded Sayings of Master Qing’an Yingchan***\n\nWhen a master of the Dao first meets someone, he draws forth the words from within that person’s own house—is this not the mark of a true master of the Way?\n\nFrom youth, I studied the Confucian classics; in my prime, I delighted in discoursing on emptiness. Though I was foolish and lowly, if anyone could speak even a word tinged with the sour scent of the Dao, I would not hold myself above them as a Confucian but would humble myself to seek their instruction. Yet I had never encountered a true master—until one day.\n\nReturning to Mount Mao, I was visited by Master Li of Qing’an Hermitage, the Luminous Toad. No sooner had he taken his seat than he uttered a few words, each one utterly free of the taint of worldly striving. Then he expounded on the *Yi* before Fu Xi drew the trigrams, pierced through the barriers that even ancestral masters had failed to fully transcend, and swept away the superficial words of the Three Teachings until all was stark and bare—opening the blind eyes of us deluded ones to a vision of perfect roundness.\n\nA pure qi enveloped us; harmonious radiance filled the room. Was it that the toad’s grotto had shifted into my own body, or had I secretly entered the grotto myself? That night, I was a thousandfold astonished and overjoyed. Collecting my thoughts, I lit incense in my heart and bowed at the foot of my bed, saying: “This is my true teacher, a true master of the Way.” If the master would not cast me aside, I would humbly receive his warnings and teachings.\n\nThereafter, I followed the master for many days, and our questions and answers were numerous. They were gathered into this volume, which I unfurl from time to time in reverence. Only when I have overturned the fortress of profound subtleties beneath Qing’an’s seat and shattered the Great Void to atoms will I be a man who has accomplished the task.\n\nAt that time, if someone were to step forward and ask Old Qing’an: “What use is this relic here?”—he would surely reply: “It is the very target I struck when I first met a master.”\n\nRespectfully inscribed on a day of heavy summer rains in the *wuzi* year of the Zhiyuan era,\nGuangchan of Moyin Hermitage, a Daoist of Mount Mao, bows his head in reverence.\n\n---\n\n**The Recorded Sayings of Master Qing’an Yingchan, Fascicle One**\nCompiled by the disciple Moyin Chai Yuangao.\n\n**Record of Questions and Answers**\n\nMaster Dadian’s *Commentary on the Heart Sutra* states: A monk asked Master Cen, “How does one purify the two rats gnawing at the vine?” Master Cen replied, “People of this age must conceal themselves.” Someone dared to ask, “What does ‘conceal oneself’ mean?” The Master said, “Why wait for withering and decay before knowing emptiness? One must, in this very moment, be unattached to every thing and unstained by every affair. If I do not perceive all phenomena, then all phenomena do not perceive me—this is called ‘concealing oneself.’”\n\nSomeone asked, “To speak of it is to fall short, yet in Shandong and Hebei it may still be discussed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “If this matter is to be expressed in words, words cannot exhaust it. The final phrase, vast and boundless, encompasses all—what more is there to say? Even the words ‘falling short’ have already spoken it.”\n\nSomeone asked, “Do you recognize this sutra?” The Master replied, “In the western realm of *Gugayānī* and the northern continent of *Uttarakuru*.” The questioner asked, “Why single out these two lines?” The Master said, “I would not put it that way. If someone asked me what this sutra is, I would simply say: a hundred thousand *li* east and west, eighty thousand *li* south and north.”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘The great spiritual mantra, the great luminous mantra, the unsurpassed mantra, the peerless mantra’—to what in the Three Teachings do these four lines correspond?” The Master said, “They correspond to the most wondrous of Daoist texts, the most mysterious of mysteries, the unsurpassed and unexcelled, the spontaneous and uncontrived. They also correspond to the Confucian ‘true observation, true illumination, and true victory as one.’ Yet the highest attainment lies beyond words and phrases.”\n\nSomeone asked, “When the bodhisattva *Vimalaprabhā* first left the household at the first ground, how did she escape the woman’s trance? Mañjuśrī, the teacher of seven buddhas, could not escape it—why?” The Master said, “Old *Chou’an* put it well: ‘The dog welcomes the guest who once lodged here; the crow guards the fledgling fallen from the nest.’ It is perfectly clear—do not doubt further.”\n\nThe Master asked me, “Because Mañjuśrī could not escape the woman’s trance, he summoned *Vimalaprabhā* to investigate the Dharma-gate of non-duality. Mañjuśrī said, ‘Do not move—if you move, you will receive thirty blows.’ How do you understand this?” As I was about to deliberate, Master Ding’an stirred, inadvertently triggering the mechanism, and I presented this to the Master. He approved.\n\nThe Master said, “The mud-snake at the bottom of the well dances the *Zhezhi*; the bright moon at the window illuminates the plum and pear. How do you understand this?” After a long pause, I replied, “A melody blown from the hollows shatters the empty flowers in the eye.” The Master said, “Not so.” I then said, “The skull cracks open—only I remain; the eyes bulge forth—nothing else exists.” The Master said, “Closer.”\n\nSomeone asked, “In the old case of the two monks rolling up the blind, one succeeded and one failed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom.”\n\nSomeone asked, “A monk asked Mount Jia: ‘What is the Dharma-body?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-body is without form.’ The monk asked, ‘What is the Dharma-eye?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-eye is without flaw.’ Daowu heard this and refused the monk further audience. Later, when Boat Monk returned and raised the same exchange, Jia answered as before: ‘This time, there is a lion.’ Master, both questions and answers were the same—why was the first rejected and the latter accepted?” The Master said, “The moon in the clouds is the same, but the streams and mountains differ.”\n\nThe Master said, “Someone asked Dongshan about the precious mirror samādhi and the five positions. The secret verse says: ‘The central within the partial, the partial within the central; from the central it comes, to the partial it arrives, and in the combined it reaches.’ How does one investigate these five?” I answered, “The central must not be fixed as central, nor should the partial be seen as partial; the partial must not be fixed as central, nor should the central be displayed as central. When the central returns to the center, the partial also arrives at the center; when partial and central unite as one, all is center—then the combined is reached. At this point, partial and central are both forgotten, and only the center remains.”\n\nThe Master said, “Almost—but one must grasp the meaning within movement and stillness.”\n\nOne day, the Master sat with four others. He said, “Old Chuan said, ‘It is mind, is not mind, is not not-mind’—how would you put it?” All answers were unsatisfactory. I said, “It is mind, yet not; it is not mind, yet not.” The Master asked, “How is it so?” I gave a shout. The Master said, “Hold it well.”\n\nThe Master asked, “What is the Dao?” I struck the table. He then asked, “What is the person of the Dao?” I struck it again. The Master said, “Almost.” I shouted in response. The Master said, “Eight moments too late.”\n\nSomeone asked, “Thirty spokes share one hub—how is this to be understood?” The Master said, “Spokes and hub are merely the body of the vessel. Only when spokes converge at the hub does the cart become functional. This is like thirty days sharing one moon to fulfill the function of illumination, or the myriad dharmas returning to emptiness to fulfill the function of nature—all are the same.”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.’ Many interpretations exist—Master, please clarify for me.” The Master said, “Those who follow life are the harmonious union of water and fire; those who follow death are the discord of water and fire. Water forms the number six, fire the number seven—six and seven together make thirteen. The ancients said: ‘Seven and six make thirteen, the spring colors of the lunar palace.’ Some say it refers to the seven emotions and six desires combined—this is somewhat plausible. Others explain it through the eight trigrams and five phases—this is incorrect. Have you not heard the lower scripture say: ‘The rigid and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life’? Rigidity and strength arise from anger and desire; softness and weakness mean curbing anger and restraining desire. When anger and desire arise, fire blazes upward and water dampens below—water and fire are in discord. When anger and desire cease, yang descends and yin ascends—water and fire are in harmony. What doubt remains?”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?’—empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-producing.”\n\nCould the revered bellows embody the wondrous workings of heaven and earth’s creation? I humbly seek your enlightened explanation.\n\nThe Master replied: The *tuo* is a bottomless sack, and the *yue* is a three-holed flute—together, they form the bellows. This metaphor illustrates how heaven and earth, in their boundless emptiness, contain all subtle principles, just as the human mind, in its emptiness, remains luminously aware. “Inexhaustible” describes its unobstructed, flowing nature; “ever-producing” speaks to its limitless responsiveness to change.\n\nSomeone asked: What is meant by “morning *tun*, evening *meng*”?\n\nThe Master said: Qian and Kun, Kan and Li form the framework, while the sixty-four hexagrams revolve and transform within it. The cycle begins with *Tun* and *Meng* and concludes with *Ji Ji*, serving as the model for the fire-phase. The alchemical texts take Qian and Kun as the crucible, Kan and Li as the elixir ingredients, and the remaining hexagrams as the mechanisms of transformation. The sixty-four hexagrams, with their three hundred and sixty lines, correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of the year. Starting from the winter solstice, the sequence begins with *Tun* and *Meng*, and ends with *Ji Ji* on the final day of Great Snow. In terms of a single month, it begins with *Tun* and *Meng* on the first day and concludes with *Ji Ji* on the last day of the month. For a single day, it starts with *Tun* and *Meng* at the hour of *zi* and ends with *Ji Ji* at the hour of *hai*. In terms of practice, a moment’s effort seizes the seasonal rhythms of an entire year—beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and concluding with *Ji Ji*. Thus, “morning *tun*, evening *meng*” is merely a general term. Those who grasp this principle complete the celestial cycle in an instant, with all hexagrams contained within. As the ancestral masters said: “Within the hexagram without lines, Qian and Kun are already determined.”\n\nSomeone asked: What is meant by “nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase”?\n\nThe Master replied: From the perspective of non-action, this is two separate koans. From the perspective of action, it is a single process of cultivation. Let us first address the non-action approach. A monk asked Master Zhaozhou: “Does a dog have Buddha-nature?” Zhaozhou said: “Yes.” The monk asked: “Then why is it born into this?”\n\nZhaozhou said: \"No.\"\nThe monk asked: \"Why not?\"\nZhaozhou said: \"Because it is utterly devoid.\"\n\nAn ancient master also said: \"When the gosling in the vase becomes a goose, how does it emerge from the bottle?\"\nThese two koans are ones that many today cannot pass through. If someone can offer a single turning word, their study of the Dao is complete.\n\nSpeaking now from the perspective of action: the dog represents \"being within non-being,\" \"yang within yin.\" The dog that guards the minister’s tent prevents internal theft. \"Nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase\" refers to \"gold within water,\" \"elixir within the furnace.\" To nurture the golden goose is to nurture the sacred embryo. When the sacred embryo matures, it is like the gosling in the vase. That the vase breaks and the goose emerges is common worldly reasoning. That the goose emerges while the vase remains unbroken—this is the marvel of shedding the embryo. Thus, the ancestral masters said: \"Within the brocade tent, the jade dog is concealed; within the precious vase, the golden goose is nurtured.\" Is this not the wonder of the golden elixir?\n\nSomeone asked: \"Abandoning one’s wife and recklessly severing yin and yang—what does this mean?\"\nThe Master replied: Master Ziyang said: \"Without true lead, do not retreat to the mountains.\" This statement closely resembles those of today’s Dao-seekers, who, misled by false teachers, receive some method and immediately claim to have attained the Dao. They abandon their wives and children, retreat into the mountains, and when their practice yields no results, they grow remorseful—some return to secular life, others remarry. Such people are numerous. Then there are the ignorant and unlearned who, failing to grasp the sages’ principles, claim that abandoning one’s wife is not the Dao, instead pointing to women as cauldrons, or asserting that women’s bodies contain medicine, or designating the birth canal as the place of rebirth. This is a path of great disorder. The ancestral masters originally instructed the world: if one cannot extinguish desire, merely abandoning one’s wife is futile. Seeing that students misconstrued their meaning, they later added: \"Naturally, there is a cauldron to refine dragon and tiger—why cling to home, wife, and children?\" Today’s unlearned fixate on the first line, entirely neglecting the latter—truly, they are offenders.\n\nSomeone asked: \"My teacher once said that those who refine the elixir must not fixate on years, months, days, or hours. Why, then, does he also speak of gathering medicine according to dawn and dusk?\"\nThe Master replied: This aligns with the meaning of *Tun* and *Meng*, though its application differs slightly. The advent of spring and autumn marks the year’s dawn and dusk; the waxing and waning moons mark the month’s dawn and dusk; the hours of *yin* and *shen* mark the day’s dawn and dusk; the moment of yin-yang union marks the body’s dawn and dusk. Comprehending the Way of day and night, one understands the principle of yin-yang’s ebb and flow. Tracing the causes of darkness and light, one grasps the discourse on life and death. The great essentials of buddhas, immortals, and sages all lie herein.\n\nSomeone asked: \"That which cannot be seen is called *xi*; that which cannot be heard is called *yi*; that which cannot be grasped is called *wei*. Is this the same as or different from 'seeing without perceiving me, hearing without attaining, transcending all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao'?\"\nThe Master replied: They appear broadly similar, but their principles differ fundamentally. The former describes the essence; the latter, its function. *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"Be cautious of what you do not covet; be fearful of what you do not hear. Nothing is more visible than the hidden, nothing more manifest than the subtle—thus the noble person is ever vigilant in solitude.\" Only when one sees where \"I\" cannot be perceived, hears where nothing can be attained, and transcends all extremes can it be called the wondrous Dao. If one merely says that what cannot be seen is *xi*, what cannot be heard is *yi*, and what cannot be grasped is *wei*, what extremes remain to be transcended?\n\nYin Yu asked with delight: \"The year has twelve months, with the *zi* month among them; the day has twelve hours, with the *zi* hour among them. Where is the *zi* hour within the human body?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard perfect stillness—then the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.\" Does this not describe it?\nYin said: \"When *gui* is born, if the hour stirs, it must dissolve—what does this mean?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Indeed.\"\nYin further asked: \"The Primordial One suspended a precious pearl five *zhang* above the earth. How is this to be understood?\"\nThe Master said: \"How would you explain it?\"\nYin replied: \"Five is a yang number.\"\nThe Master said: \"No. Five *zhang* above the earth signifies separation from the five defilements. Within the realm of profound emptiness, it is the concealment of spirit in the wondrous.\"\nYin said: \"Above the five defilements lies the gate of the Mysterious Female, does it not?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Though so, without genuine effort and direct realization, merely speaking of such imagery—what use is it?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs. Why use such a base analogy?\"\nThe Master replied: Heaven, earth, and the sage do not regard benevolence as benevolence, thus they view the myriad things and the common people as insignificant, likening them to things that live and die on their own. Though they live and die on their own, they ultimately return to the root and restore their mandate. *The Book of Changes* states: \"Manifesting benevolence, concealing its function, it moves the myriad things without sharing the sage’s concerns.\" This is the meaning of \"heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs.\" *Qian* bestows great benefit upon the world without declaring what it benefits—how vast! This is the meaning of \"the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"[Laozi speaks of] the infant who has not yet learned to smile; Mencius speaks of the great person who does not lose their childlike heart. Are these the same?\"\nThe Master replied: \"They are the same. This describes the great simplicity not yet dispersed—its return is not far.\"\nSomeone asked: \"Laozi said: 'The Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct yet vague, within it there is something; vague yet indistinct, within it there is an image.'\"\n\n\"Profound and obscure, within it there is essence; this essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity.\" Why, among these three, does he speak only of \"this essence being utterly real, within it there is sincerity\"?\n\nThe Master replied: \"The sage speaks of 'a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.' This 'born before heaven and earth' is the manifest image of the Dao. The image becomes manifest through heaven and earth; heaven and earth are formed in chaos through this thing; the thing is congealed by the wondrous union of the two and fivefold essences. Thus, the two and fivefold essences are the substance of the Dao. The image and the thing are the function of the Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The passage on being 'cautious and apprehensive where nothing is seen'—the four lines beginning with 'to see yet not perceive me'—are a most apt analogy. If one could illustrate this even more aptly with Confucian sayings, I would be grateful if you would add a word.\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The first two lines describe being in a place where no one is present, yet constantly maintaining sincerity. The latter two lines describe being face-to-face with others, yet always guarding against unforeseen intentions. Consider how 'the burden of heaven is without sound or scent'—its sincerity cannot be concealed. Is this not the subtlety of what is hidden and manifest? Though the burden of heaven has no sound or scent to be heard or known, the principles of heaven shine clearly, and its sincerity cannot be concealed.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What does it mean that 'anxiety, regret, and shame reside in the minute'?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The minute refers to 'my heart is not like stone, unturnable.' In every movement of mind and stirring of thought, first reside in the minute. With great stability in the minute, even the slightest movement will show its first signs—how could there be regret or shame? The key is to be forewarned.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Are 'three days before *jia*' and 'three days after *jia*' the same as 'three days before *geng*' and 'three days after *geng*'?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"They are not the same. *Gu* means disorder. To awaken before it arises is to prevent disorder. To awaken after it has arisen and then remedy it means disorder can still be saved. If one does not awaken, the disorder becomes severe. *Jia* means the beginning. Awakening three days prior is called 'before *jia*'; awakening three days after is called 'after *jia*.' Awakening too long after three days is not true awakening. 'Before *geng*' and 'after *geng*' refer to the *xun* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place. *Xun* is wind, the mandate of heaven. When mandates are altered, the people do not trust them—only after the *si* day do they come to believe. If three days before the change, one first announces the advantages and harms, and then implements the reform, the people will follow and trust it. Then, three days after the change, one again admonishes them, so they gladly do good. From *jia* to *wu* and *ji* is the center; *geng* passes the center. Passing the center means change, hence it is called *geng*. *Geng* means reform and renewal.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"If it cannot be spoken of as the Dao, then how is the Dao to be explained? Quickly, speak of the Dao!\"\n\nI repeated this to him, and the Master assented.\n\nThe Master said: \"What cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—how would you explain it?\"\n\nI replied: \"I could explain it, but I fear my understanding is shallow and superficial. I would be grateful if you would speak of it.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"What emerges from spontaneity cannot be spoken of. The Dao originally has no name; this is called the unnameable name. What emerges from the Dao is the Dao that can be spoken of; only then can it be named the nameable name. What cannot be spoken of or named is the beginning of heaven and earth. What can be spoken of and named is the mother of the myriad things. To see its beginning, constantly be without desire to observe its subtlety. To see its mother, constantly be with desire to observe its manifestations. Subtle and profound, it begins in the beginningless. Manifest and bounded, it appears in what can be seen. These two emerge from the same source but have different names; together they are called the profound.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In the past, I sat in attendance before Master Shian. The Master asked me to compose a couplet: *'The essence pass, the spirit pass, and the qi pass—three passes converge as one.'* I responded: *'Heavenly sounds, earthly sounds, and human sounds—ten thousand sounds all resound.'* The Master changed *resound* to *clarify*. What would you compose?\"\n\nI replied: *\"Gentle fire, fierce fire, and wisdom fire—all fires complete the work.\"*\n\nThe Master then said: \"I have a couplet: *'Awakening the later-awakened with prior awakening.'* What would you compose in response?\"\n\nI replied: \"By external observation to observe internal observation.\"\nThe Master said: \"Change *by* to *return*—it would be better.\"\n\nOn the winter solstice night, the Master said: *\"As the first yang returns, the former kings closed their gates at the solstice.\"*\nWhat would you compose in response?\nI answered: *\"The six lines complete Kun; the noble person thus cultivates their work in due time.\"*\nThe Master approved.\n\nOne day, the Master addressed the assembly: *\"The prior sages’ *Yi* of the heart is the later people’s heart of the *Yi*.*\nEach of you, compose a couplet.\"\nI answered: *\"My body’s spirit and qi are fundamentally the primordial qi and spirit.\"*\nZhai Zai said: *\"The true nature of the Great Beginning—is it not today’s true nature?\"*\nThe Master said: \"I have a couplet of my own; all of you, listen carefully.\"\nThe Master said: *\"The scriptures of the lesser-born are originally the same as the Laozi’s treasury of scriptures.\"*\nNone could match it.\n\nThe Master asked: *\"The lungs correspond to metal, and metal is inherently sinking—why then does it float?\nThe liver corresponds to wood, and wood is inherently floating—why then does it sink?\"*\nNone could answer.\nThe Master said: *\"The lungs receive qi and thus contain yi; wood is within, so they float.\nThe liver receives qi and thus contains geng; metal is within, so it sinks.\nIn terms of hexagrams: Dui is metal, and metal’s nature is to sink. Yet metal generates the water of the northern first line as Kan, and the true fire within Kan flames upward—thus it floats.\nZhen is wood, and wood’s nature is to float. Yet the solid line below Zhen arises from wood generating the fire of the southern second line as Li, and the true water within Li descends—thus it sinks.\nIn terms of medicinal substances: lead is metal, inherently sinking, yet it rises when exposed to fire—thus it floats.\nMercury is wood, inherently floating, yet it falls when exposed to water—thus it sinks.\nIn terms of symbolic images: the moon belongs to Kan, inherently sinking, yet it floats when fire is applied.\nThe sun belongs to Li, inherently floating, yet it sinks when the talisman is withdrawn.\nThe ancients said: *'At the pond’s bottom, the sun glows red and yin demons vanish'—sinking due to water.\n*'At the mountain’s peak, the moon shines white and medicinal sprouts renew'—floating due to qi.\nIn sum: metal is hollow and thus floats; wood is solid and thus sinks. This is what is meant.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Host within host, guest within guest, guest within host, host within guest.*\nWhat do you make of this?\"\nNone grasped the mechanism.\nZhai Zai said: *\"The body beyond the body is host within host; the dream within a dream is guest within guest.\nPassion within nature is guest within host; nature within passion is host within guest.\"*\nThe Master said: \"That is somewhat closer.\"\nI answered: *\"I have only myself; he speaks of another, yet when he comes to employ me, I in turn command him—this is the meaning.\"*\nThe Master said: \"Not yet thorough.\"\nI replied: *\"Beyond the heart there is no heart—host within host.\nWithin thought arises thought—guest within guest.\nAwareness before movement—guest within host.\nAwareness after movement—host within guest.\"*\nThe Master said: \"It would be more precise to speak in terms of movement and stillness:\n*In stillness at its utmost—host within host.\nIn movement upon movement—guest within guest.\nAbiding firmly within movement—guest within host.\nScattering within stillness—host within guest.*\"\n\nThe Master asked: *\"Qian has four virtues; how many does Kun have?\"*\nI answered: \"Kun also has four virtues.\"\nThe Master said: \"Not entirely satisfactory.\nKun’s *yuan heng li* are the same as Qian’s, but the word *zhen* differs. Only after yielding and following does it become *zhen*—hence it is called the *zhen* of the mare.\nThe mare is gentle and yielding, yet moves with vigor.\"\n\nThe Master asked: *\"How many virtues does Zhun have?\"*\nI answered: *\"Its words—*yuan heng li zhen*—are the same as Qian’s, but its virtues differ.\"*\nThe Master asked: *\"In what way do they differ?\"*\nI pondered but could not respond.\nThe Master said: *\"If its virtues were the same, it would not be Zhun’s difficulty.\nThe *yuan heng* here means *yuan* possesses the meaning of great penetration.\n*Li zhen* means benefit lies in steadfast correctness; without correctness, it would not suffice to escape Zhun’s difficulties.\nWhere is the penetration in that?\nOnly by firmly guarding the *yuan*’s penetration can one overcome Zhun’s difficulties.\"*\n\nThe Master asked: *\"'In the southwest one gains companions; in the northeast one loses companions'—what does this mean?\"*\nI pondered but could not answer.\nThe Master smiled and said: *\"You do not yet understand.\"*\n\nHerein lies the principle: when the yin class gains yin companions, the yin qi grows ever more abundant, leading only to deeper delusion—thus it is called \"losing constancy.\" Yet when one reaches the yang position of the northeast, the yin companions are lost, and so \"steadfast correctness brings good fortune.\" As yin follows yang, the principle of generation and completion is fulfilled—thus it is called \"gaining constancy.\" If one severs it with resolute intent, from where could thoughts arise? When the passions of thought are cut off, one loses those companions—this too is called \"gaining constancy.\" Without the utmost clarity in all under heaven, who could attain this?\n\nThe Master asked: *\"Why are all six lines of Qian auspicious?\"*\nI replied: *\"Because of the attainment of its humble yielding.\"*\nThe Master said: *\"Yet all lines speak of humility, while the fifth line does not—why is this?\"*\nI answered: *\"The fifth is the position of the ruler. If it were overly humble, it would lose its authority. Thus it is said, 'There is benefit in employing military force—nothing is not advantageous.' Therefore, those who cultivate the true Way must balance firmness and flexibility, never leaning excessively toward softness.\"*\n\nThe Master asked: *\"What is meant by 'Before Heaven, do not oppose; after Heaven, accord with the celestial seasons'?\"*\nI replied: *\"That which precedes birth is 'before Heaven'—thus there is nothing to oppose. That which follows birth is 'after Heaven'—thus there is something to accord with.\"*\nThe Master said: *\"One should take the 'prior awakening' as an analogy for the natural arising of the precelestial, and the 'later awakening' as an analogy for the unavoidable arising of the postcelestial. That which arises naturally does not oppose the heavenly principle; that which arises unavoidably, I dare not oppose Heaven—thus it is called 'according with the celestial seasons.'\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure before they arise are called 'the Center'; when they arise and all strike the proper measure, it is called 'Harmony.'\"*\nHe then tested us: *\"When desire arises but has not yet arisen—where does one meet it?\"*\nAfter a long silence, someone answered.\nThe Master said: *\"That is already arisen.\"*\nI remained silent.\nThe Master said: *\"That is not yet arisen.\"*\nAnother answered.\nThe Master approved, saying: *\"Keep this for your own use, lest you blind the eyes of later learners. Only those who awaken on their own may truly apply it.\"*\n\n*Record of Qing’an Yingchanzi, Scroll One—End*\n*Record of Qing’an Yingchanzi, Scroll Two*\n\n**Compiled by Disciple Ding’an Zhao Daoke**\n**Essentials of the Daoist Mind**\n\nQing’an transmitted the *Convergence of Dao and Virtue* to Daoke, whereupon all disciples partook of the Dharma-milk and glimpsed the profound purport beyond words. Now, having gathered the recorded dialogues of these disciples into one volume, I share it with those of like aspiration, that they may awaken through mind-to-mind transmission—hence the title *Essentials of the Mind*.\n\nThe Master said: *\"This character ‘Dao’ belongs neither to the realm of speech nor to the realm of no-speech, neither to the realm of form nor to the realm of no-form.

Because I receive reverence, who dares not show respect?\"*\n\n**Winter Solstice Ascending the Hall to Expound the Scriptures**\nAfter ascending the seat, offering incense, and reciting the invocations,\nthe Master raised his staff and said:\n*\"The Dao is originally wordless;\nI too have little to say.\nBut with this staff,\nsometimes it is the substance in my hand,\nsometimes it is the function in my hand.\"*\n\nHe held the staff horizontally and asked:\n*\"Is this substance or function?\"*\nAfter a long pause, he continued:\n*\"In function, it props up heaven and supports earth.\"*\n\nThis staff possesses unfathomable spiritual power,\nits wondrous uses beyond measure.\nThe moment it is raised,\nthe boundless flying heavenly deities, the Immortal Kings of the Ten Directions,\nand the countless hosts of the Great Longevity Spirits\nall stand in submission.\nEven the Most High Lord Lao comes to the tip of the staff to beg for life.\n\nWhy? *\"Once the authority is in hand, the command is issued.\"*\n\nHe raised the staff and said:\n*\"Behold, all of you!\"*\nHe struck once and said:\n*\"Strike once—strike the void into □ leaps!\"*\nHe stirred it once and said:\n*\"Stir once—stir the primordial chaos into dense fusion!\"*\nHe drew a line and said:\n*\"Draw once—draw open the fences of the Three Teachings!\"*\nHe tapped once and said:\n*\"Tap once—tap through the nostrils of all!\"*\n\nThough it possesses such vast spiritual power,\nnot a single one in the entire world has it ever struck.\nWhy?\n\nThe Pure Hermitage’s staff strikes not the dullard.\nWith a shout, he asks:\n*\"Is there anyone who wishes to taste the rod’s bite? Step forth then.\"*\nThe True Hermitage emerges, bows, and asks:\n*\"When snow falls at the Winter Solstice, what is its meaning?\"*\nThe Master replies:\n*\"This question drips water that freezes solid—\nit cannot be taken as an auspicious sign,\nyet it cannot be dismissed as inauspicious.\nWithout the root of learning’s heel, it is no propitious omen.\nWithout the eye of accumulated study, how then to see it?\"*\nHmph!\n*\"The earth’s thunder shakes as the solitary yang arrives,\nthe White Maiden and Azure Lad meet in the Crimson Palace.\nThe song ends, the wine runs dry, clouds and rain disperse—\nshattered jade scatters wildly across the void.\nIs this not the snow of the Winter Solstice month?\"*\nHmph! *\"Do not mistake it for mere scenery.\"*\nWhy?\n*\"No need to seek the Winter Solstice beyond the city walls—\nwithin the body, a single bowel stirs to life.\nIn the year, there is the year’s Winter Solstice;\nin the month, the month’s Winter Solstice;\nin the day, the day’s Winter Solstice;\nin the hour, the hour’s Winter Solstice.\nThe Festival of the Solitary Yang is the year’s Winter Solstice;\nthe first day of each month is the month’s Winter Solstice;\nthe midnight hour is the day’s Winter Solstice.\nNow tell me—what is the Winter Solstice within the body?\"*\nThe True Hermitage says:\n*\"Pray, Master, grant instruction.\"*\nThe Master replies:\n*\"When the moon reaches the heart of the sky,\nwhen the wind brushes the water’s surface—\nboth hold the same pure savor,\nyet few indeed are those who know it.\"*\n\nDo you understand?\nThe disciple replies: \"Yes.\"\nThe Master says: \"Yet I fear there may still be those who do not fully grasp it—recite again the chapter *To the Utmost Void*?\"\nThe disciple replies: \"I can recite it.\"\nThe Master says: \"First, recite the opening four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"To the utmost void, hold fast to stillness;\nthe myriad things arise together,\nI thereby observe their return.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"Confucius said: *'Thunder lies within the earth—Return. The former kings, on this solstice day, closed the passes, forbade merchants and travelers from moving, and the lords did not inspect their domains.'* This refers to the ancient sage-kings who, on the Winter Solstice, closed the gates, halted all commerce and travel, and bade the people attain emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the return of the new yang. Once the new yang returns, the four seasons proceed in order, and the five grains flourish. When people, at the time of the yang’s return, maintain tranquility—keeping the inner realm from leaking outward and the outer realm from intruding inward—they await the yang’s return. Once the yang returns, the four elements are at peace, the hundred bones are in harmony—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nNow, today is the Winter Solstice with snowfall; merchants and travelers naturally cease their journeys—how could this not be an auspicious sign? Yet though all manner of auspicious signs may appear, none compare to the absence of *you*.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Now, the teeming things,\neach returns to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called the restoration of life.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"These four lines speak of observing transformation and knowing return. Consider the hexagram *Return*: from *Kun* it returns—*Kun* is stillness, yang is movement. Stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, and the Heart of Heaven is revealed.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Restoration of life is called constancy;\nto know constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"If one comprehends these subtle workings, one directly enters the realm of true constancy—hence, it is called illumination. But if, when the yang returns, one remains ignorant and acts recklessly, one will surely lose one’s life—hence, it is called misfortune.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"To know constancy is to be all-embracing;\nall-embracing is to be impartial;\nimpartial is to be kingly;\nkingly is to be heavenly.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"*All-embracing* means to broadly receive and contain. *Impartial* means to extend universally to all things. When one is utterly impartial and universal, one may become a ruler, a teacher—Heaven and humanity share the same principle.\"\n\n\"Recite the final lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Heavenly is the Dao;\nthe Dao is enduring.\nTo the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"To embody Heaven and unite with the Dao—this is the fullness of the Way of long life and enduring vision. Advancing further from here, one realizes the wondrous truth of the *non-arising dharma patience*. If one recognizes this intimately and directly assumes it, settling into the work of stillness—attaining the utmost void, holding fast to stillness—the Heart of Heaven is revealed. Once the Heart of Heaven is revealed, one radiates great luminosity in that very place, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. Within each of these worlds are three thousand great thousandfold lands; within each land, three thousand great thousandfold Dharma gates; within each gate, three thousand great thousandfold wise and virtuous beings; within each being, three thousand great thousandfold retinues; within each retinue, eyes that see the same Heart of Heaven, each radiating the same light, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. In this way, all beings on earth breathe through a single nostril.\n\nOnly then does one realize that every month, every day, every moment is the Winter Solstice—today’s Winter Solstice is but an ordinary day. An ancient worthy said: *'It is all just an ordinary day—yet the deluded masses stir up a commotion.'* Since it is merely an ordinary day, why do we perform these rituals today? Is it something extraordinary? Though we must follow local customs and add a footnote as convention requires—does anyone understand this footnote?\"\n\nShi’an says: \"I do not.\"\nThe Master says: \"Ask me, then.\"\nThe disciple asks: \"What is the footnote for the Winter Solstice?\"\nThe Master replies: *\"On this mid-winter day, joyous snowfall—may your honored presence be blessed with boundless fortune in all your movements.\"*\n\"Do you understand?\"\nThe disciple replies: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Master says: \"Since you understand, why do you not bow?\"\nShi’an bows.\nThe Master says: \"Wait—there is yet something beyond.\"\nShi’an asks: \"What else is there?\"\nThe Master says: \"Qing’an has spoken of it: *Auspicious snow heralds the blessings of this solstitial day.* The assembly leader repeats this: *On this propitious occasion, may celestial fortune descend upon us.* Take care, take care.\"\nThen he descends from the seat and dismisses the assembly.\n\nThe Master raises his whisk and addresses the assembly: \"The body of the Dao is without form, its name without designation—there is nothing to be said, and even if one speaks, it cannot be expressed. Today, having ascended the seat, I borrow this whisk to preach in my stead. This whisk is not a whisk—it is a troublemaker. Why? The moment it is lifted, it overturns the patriarchs’ doubts, blinds the eyes of the crowd, and provokes disputes. This whisk is all mouth, this whisk is all hands, this whisk is all eyes. Its spiritual powers are unfathomable, its transformations boundless.\"\n\nHe holds it upright: \"Look—does it have eyes or not?\"\nHe taps it once: \"Listen—does it have ears or not?\"\nHe casts the whisk aside: \"Hmm—does it have spiritual power or not?\"\n\nThe attendant picks up the whisk and hands it back to the Master.\nThe Master says: \"Used thus, yet beyond this use.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, he continues: \"Mountains, rivers, and the great earth—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. The ten thousand phenomena—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. The three worthies and ten sages—all rest upon the tip of this whisk. Every being in the vast world—all rest upon the tip of this whisk.\"\n\nHe waves the whisk: \"Is there anyone here who does not rest upon the tip of this whisk? If so, come forth and let us meet.\"\n\nThe Layman Huang steps forward and says:\n\"A single thunderclap startles like a thunderbolt,\nShaking the cold stars across the heavens.\"\n\nHe addresses the Master: \"What is the message of the returning yang?\"\n\nThe Master traces a circle in the air and asks: \"Do you understand?\"\n\nHuang replies: \"I do.\"\n\n\"What then of the yang within the body?\"\n\nThe Master flicks his whisk and shouts.\n\nHuang says: \"I accept it directly.\"\n\nThe Master says: \"Just proceed thus.\"\n\nHuang bows in gratitude: \"Had my teacher not revealed it, I would have nearly missed the birth of yang.\"\n\nDai Jiayan asks: \"For the most part, it is just an ordinary day,\nYet it stirs the masses into confusion.\nWhy is it called the Winter Solstice?\nAnd though it is said yang is born, why does snow fall? What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nThe Master says: \"The great earth lies level,\nHeaven and earth share one hue—do you understand?\"\n\nDai replies: \"I do not.\"\n\nThe Master says: \"Come closer, and I will tell you.\"\n\nDai approaches the Master.\n\nThe Master says: \"Though snow blankets a thousand mountains white,\nThe solitary peak stands tall and unchanging.\"\n\nDai bows in gratitude and withdraws.\n\nThe Master says: \"I have a hidden saying for you all to contemplate.\nThe sutra states:\n'Vague and indistinct—within it there is an image;\nIndistinct and vague—within it there is a thing.'\nNow, what is this thing?\"\n\nIf one among you penetrates this, then drag Li Qing’an down from the dharma seat, beat him to death, dig a deep pit, and bury him thick with earth—let no trace remain—it would not be excessive. If you fail to penetrate it, then Li Qing’an will bury you instead. Should this still not suffice, I shall add another annotation.\n\nA verse says:\nI have a single thing—\nIt can be small, it can be vast.\nIn essence, it is one with the great void;\nIn function, it pervades the dharma realm.\nLift it, and heaven cannot contain it;\nSet it down, and earth cannot bear it.\nThose who see it startle with bulging eyes;\nThose who hear it split their skulls asunder.\nIf a Daoist grasps this, the three mountains of Peng Island tremble;\nIf a black-robed monk grasps this, the lineage of Cao Stream is held in hand.\nWith it, govern the state—state is at peace, people prosper;\nWith it, aid the Dao—times are clear, the Dao flourishes.\nWere one to speak of its value, its worth would be ten thousand taels of gold;\nYet if one meets a true connoisseur, it is sold without a single coin.\nWhy without a single coin?\nNot for profit—only for joy.\nNow I raise it before you and ask:\nDo you understand, or do you not?\n\nShi’an says: I do not.\n\nThe Master says: Never mind understanding or not—today, you buy and sell it yourself.\n\nHe molds a round image and says: Look—within the seam of these two hands, plucked forth, it is naturally fragrant.\n\n**On the Birthday of the Supreme Lord Lao, Ascending the Seat**\n\nThe Master ascends the seat and says: The Supreme is without peer, yet abides in daily use. Pity those without learning, who merely speak of emerging from the hidden pass. Now, all of you, tell me: Where does the Supreme reside?\n\nHmph! Even now, as he speaks the dharma, do any of you understand? Even if you grasp the meaning at once, you remain a thread’s breadth from Qing’an’s Way. Why? If you say *he* is the Supreme, then what are *you*? You must investigate within yourself to see it intimately.\n\nThe Supreme says:\nThe true and constant Dao—those who awaken attain it.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nAgain, he says: The reason beings do not attain the true Dao is because of deluded mind. When the deluded mind stirs, it gives rise to all manner of karmic conditions. Bound by these conditions, they lose the root of the Dao. Seeing that beings are lost in delusion, the sage establishes various expedient means to guide the world, detaching them from defilements and leading them out of deluded paths—this is why the scripture is composed. The scripture is the path that returns to the Dao.\n\nThose who read this scripture should know: this scripture is but a forced name. In truth, there is nothing to be said, and even if said, it cannot be said. It cannot be grasped, cannot be abandoned, cannot be added to, cannot be diminished, cannot be described, cannot be conveyed to others. It does not belong to discourse, to knowledge, to perception, to hearing, to being or non-being. Do not take it as the mark of reality, do not take it as true emptiness, do not take it as literary meaning, do not take it as annihilation or permanence.\n\nThen how should one who engages with the Dao proceed? Only those who grasp the great image can attain it.\n\nThe Supreme says: Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come. Coming without harm, they rest in great peace. Music and bait may halt the passing traveler, but the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. Those who perceive the Dao through sound and form cling to impermanent dharmas, which ultimately come to an end. The Dao, when spoken, is bland and flavorless—seen, it is not enough to behold; heard, it is not enough to listen to; used, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nGreat indeed are the words of the sage! If one truly trusts this, one can leave behind all marks, end all dharmas, and directly merge them into a single whole—utterly bare, utterly empty—concealing the great sound in silence, hiding the great image in formlessness. Then, naturally, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one unites with the Dao in truth.\n\nYet how is it that today’s scholars do not seek the master’s intent, but privately speculate, some clinging to literary meaning, others fixating on words? The sage’s purpose in composing the scripture is thus obscured. The unannotated passages in this scripture often differ—this is the reason. Little do they know that the moment one opens one’s foul mouth, ten thousand eight thousand errors arise. The moment one says “the Dao that can be spoken,” it is not the constant Dao. The moment one says “the name that can be named,” it is not the constant name.\n\nThen is the constant Dao unspeakable? Are the five thousand words not the Dao? Is the constant name unnameable? Is the *Daodejing* not a name?\n\nHmph! The Dao that cannot be spoken—*that* is the Dao. The name that cannot be named—*that* is the name. If you have the eye to see this, your study of the Dao is complete. If not, you merely follow others’ footsteps: the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom, the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Thus, few understand the sage’s Dao.\n\nQing’an spares not his two lips to reveal this to you all. This scroll of scripture is but soiled paper, unfit for wiping. Since it is soiled paper, the five thousand words cannot elucidate the meaning of the unspeakable Dao. It is like a great physician treating illness—prescribing medicine according to the ailment. Once the illness is cured, the medicine is no longer needed. Once the constant Dao is attained, the five thousand words are also useless.\n\nThose who see it thus know: the speakable and nameable are the fringes of the Dao; the unspeakable and unnameable are the Dao’s profound mystery. The named fringe is the Dao’s function; the nameless mystery is the Dao’s essence. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the ten thousand things. These two emerge together yet bear different names—together they are called the profound. Profound beyond profound—they are the gate of all wonders.\n\nIf one can proceed from the named fringe to the nameless mystery, the true and constant Dao is attained. Who but the most utterly empty under heaven could achieve this?\n\nAll of you—Qing’an has spoken at length thus far. Is this speaking, or is it not speaking?\n\nAll of you who have heard the scripture thus far—is this hearing, or is it not hearing? Those of keen wisdom and insight, if there are those who hear what is not heard, only then do they meet Qing’an’s \"speaking of no-speaking.\" In this way, the Sage’s intent in composing the scripture becomes clear. The opening phrase—it is perfect, complete; cease all doubt.\n\nSomeone asks: If the Dao cannot be spoken, and names cannot be named, then why today’s grand ritual—is this not superfluous? The master replies: Not so. The Supreme’s descent on the fifteenth day of the second month is not real—it reveals the meaning of ceaseless generation. Today, celebrating the Supreme’s birth is precisely to illuminate that opening phrase. What superfluity is there? What doubt remains?\n\nAll of you—the opening phrase has already spoken itself. What then of the closing phrase? Hmph! The mouth given by father and mother will never serve me.\n\nThe master descends from the seat and dismisses the assembly.\n\nThe master says: \"Seen yet unseen—called *xī*; heard yet unheard—called *yí*; grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*. These three cannot be interrogated.\" I say: Seen yet unseen—called *xī*—is this not formless? Heard yet unheard—called *yí*—is this not soundless? Grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*—is this not shapeless?\n\nHe raises his whisk and asks: Do you see? He taps it once and asks: Do you hear? If you take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is not yet sharp. If you do not take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is still not sharp. How do all of you understand this?\n\nHey An steps forward and says:\nSeeing form is not form,\nHearing sound is not sound.\nWhere the colored body is unobstructed,\nOne arrives at the city of the Dharma King.\n\nThe master says: Leave behind words.\nHey An clenches his fist and says: Look.\nHe strikes once and says: Listen.\nDoes this still belong to seeing and hearing?\n\nThe master says: Striking emptiness to make a sound.\nHey An asks: Is there more?\nThe master replies: When you hide the great elephant in formlessness, and conceal the great sound in soundlessness, then come to meet me.\n\nHey An says: Yes. He bows in gratitude and retreats.\n\nThe master raises his staff and says:\nThe mud ox pants at the moon,\nThe wooden horse neighs in the wind—\nGazing, it seems to exist, yet no trace is found.\nQing’an’s staff draws the inverted Wondrous Peak.\n\nHe continues: To open the mouth is already a mistake—how laborious to raise such things! Hmph! If you seek the August Emperor’s intent beneath the staff, you have not even dreamed of it. Why? The good walker leaves no tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws; the good reckoner needs no counting rods; the good closer needs no bolts yet cannot be opened; the good binder needs no cords yet cannot be untied.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe step does not depend on the foot,\nGrasping things does not depend on the hand.\nTouch the tip of the nose—\nThe whole body is a mouth.\n\nIf you can thoroughly investigate this,\nThe forty-nine days were originally seven sevens.\nIf you understand it here,\nYou will know the Supreme spoke the scripture without ever opening his mouth,\nAnd Qing’an raised his staff without ever moving his hand.\nIf you have not yet done so,\nThen work within sound and form—\nIs there anyone who understands?\nYou may not open your mouth,\nYou may not move your hand.\nLeave behind sound and form—\nCome forward and meet me.\n\nIf you speak, you receive the staff.\nIf you do not speak, you still receive the staff.\n\nHuang the Layman steps forward, about to open the register, when the attendant says: You may not open your mouth. After a long silence, he stamps his foot once.\nThe master says: There is more.\n\nHuang coughs.\nThe master says: Eight *ke* too early or late.\n\nDing’an steps forward and bows, saying: I beg the master to repeat the teaching.\nThe master says: You may not open your mouth.\nDing’an raises his fist.\nAgain he says: You may not move your hand.\nDing’an shouts.\nThe master says: There is still more above.\nDing’an says: What more is there?\nThe master says: Among the assembly here today, it would be best to reflect in quietude.\n\nThe master descends from his seat. Ding’an follows.\nThe master seizes him and asks: Where are you going?\nDing’an says: Nowhere to go.\nThe master says: If you go like this, you may avoid the staff.\nDing’an bows in gratitude.\n\n*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Scroll Three concludes.*\n*(Note: Text may be missing before this line.)*\n\n*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Scroll Four*\n*Compiled by disciple Ning’an Deng Decheng*\n*Composed in Weiyang*\n\nThe master was in Weiyang composing a line, instructing his disciples to continue with another.\nThe master says: If any match the rhythm, they may advance a step.\n\nThe master says:\nFormless, traceless, nameless too,\nUpholding heaven and earth from ancient times to now.\nJust as Qing’an overturned it all—\nDing’an says: The great thousand worlds all turn to gold.\nWu’an says: Vast and without trace, beyond all seeking.\nFu’an says: Know that the point of entry is found in stillness.\nHei’an says: Transformed, the great earth becomes gold.\nYue’an says: Shattered into nothingness, without a trace.\n\nThe master says: Except for Wu’an, all have passed in one stroke.\n\nThe master says:\nThe tripod of heaven and golden furnace refine sun and moon,\nThe handle of the Big Dipper turns the celestial sphere.\nSplitting open chaos, the golden elixir is complete—\nDing’an says: Only then does the true man attain his will.\nWu’an says: The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet likened to action.\nHei’an says: This is the time before heaven and earth.\nJi’an says: Precisely the moment of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\n\nThe master says: Ding’an’s line is supreme.\n\nThe master says:\nStep forward and overturn the formless,\nLift your head and topple the Great Brahma Heaven.\nIf someone asks where I dwell—\nDing’an says: Breaking through the golden barrier, unbounded and free.\nWu’an says: A single speck contains the great thousand worlds.\nFu’an says: Hidden in the primordial chaos before the separation of foam.\nHeiku says: Neither diminished nor increased, fundamentally natural.\nYue’an says: Only in the space between your brows and lashes.\n\nThe master says: Ding’an is first, Fu’an second.\n\nThe master says:\nThrough kalpas, it was ever a single pearl,\nHard as raw iron, soft as butter.\nThe great thousand worlds have no place to rest—\nDing’an says: Encompassing heaven and earth, the pattern of creation.\nWu’an says: Beyond the Dao, emptiness is inexhaustible.\nFu’an says: Illuminating the void, there is nothing at all.\nPu’an says: Seeing it clearly, there is nothing to seek afterward.\nHei’an says: Filling the void entirely, it is all this.\nAishan says: Boundless pure light illumines the great emptiness.\n\nThe master says: None have fully captured it, yet among them, Ding’an and Hei’an come closest.\n\nThe master says:\nClinging to non-being or being is not the work,\nAbandoning both still falls into emptiness.\nOnly when neither is relied upon is there unity—\nDing’an says: True being arises from non-being, then subtly flows.\nHei’an says: Neither being nor non-being, only then is there perfect penetration.\nWu’an says: Neither being nor non-being reveals spiritual power.\nFu’an says: Only when the great void is one with the body is the Dao penetrated.\n\nThe master says: All come close.\n\nI say: It would be better to silently abide within.\n\nThe master says:\nRound and complete, a single circle,\nExisting before the primordial chaos was divided.\nWithout stem or root, nothing to grasp—\nDing’an says: Only now is the true trap revealed.\nHei’an says: Present and fully functional in every application.\nWu’an says: Know that when the moon sets, it does not leave the sky.\nFu’an says: Still and unmoving, awakening to the true meaning.\n\nThe master says: Hei’an’s line is acceptable.\n\nThe master says:\nAbove, it props up heaven; below, it props up earth,\nYet in the center, a single aperture does not circulate *qi*.\nInvisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear—\nDing’an says: Eating and dressing, ever unobscured.\nHei’an says: In every application, never apart.\nWu’an says: Filling the void, even spirits and ghosts fear it.\nSun’an says: How is it different from the void?\n\nThe master says: Ding’an’s line is acceptable.\n\nThe master further says:\nErect the tripod and dry up the four great seas,\nSet the furnace and refine the five Mount Sumerus to dust.\nThe golden elixir takes form, encompassing the three realms—\nDing’an says: Only then does the true man attain his will.\nWu’an says: The Dao is fundamentally non-action, yet likened to action.\nHei’an says: This is the time before heaven and before earth.\nJi’an says: Precisely the moment of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\n\nThe master says: Ding’an’s line is peerless.\n\nThe master was at Zhaoyang’s Four Sages Daoist Abbey, refining aspirations with his Dharma kin.

even finer.\n\nThe master says:\nLittle brother An, little toad Chan,\nHidden away, not permitted for outsiders to see.\nLast night, opening its mouth to swallow the sky—\nHei’an says: A belly full of

says:\nHearing scriptures and teachings, the task is never complete,\nSeeking the mystery apart from the Dharma is also wrong.\nNeither departing nor hearing—both are errors—\nHei’an says: Overturn everything, and the work is perfected.\nXi’an says: When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.\nThe master says: None have fully grasped it.\nI answer: Holding to the center without deviation is the true

traversing both paths, how can one attain the Dao?\nHei’an says: A slap across the face—too merciless.\nXi’an says: Originally, the middle way is level and smooth.\nThe master says: Xi’an comes closest.\nI say: Riding the wind back to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.\nThe master says:\nThe gateless barrier is not hard to fathom,\nYet speaking of no gate, there is no barrier.\nIf there is

defilement—\nHei’an says: Playing the zither to summon the phoenix, naturally clear.\nYi’an says: All conditions extinguished, the great elixir is complete.\nDong’an says: Emptiness and quiescence are rooted in sincerity.\nJing’an says: Releasing the whole body, one naturally attains spirit.\nThe master says: All fall short.\nI answer: Let it be free and at ease, then there is radiance.\nThe master says:\nWhen the work is done in the depths of darkness,\nGuarding even a little wastes the effort.\nNot guarding, it becomes vast and boundless—\nHei’an says: This body is wholly one with the great void.\nXi’an says: Within stillness, there is great spiritual power.\nDong’an says: The whole body hides within the great void.\nYi’an says: Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and connected.\nThe master says: Bring it forth beyond things to display spiritual power.\nThe master further says:\nLast night at midnight, the sun was at noon,\nThe great beast swallowed the tiger of South Mountain.\nWithin the clarity of concentration, spiritual power is displayed—\nHei’an says: When the lion roars, who dares insult?\nYi’an says: Shaking heaven and earth, who dares insult?\nThe master says: Neither of you recognizes this.\nI answer: The words make the dragon of the deep rise and dance.\nThe master says:\nFishing for the moon in water has always been delusion,\nPlanting lotuses in fire is empty deception.\nRashly seeking heaven expends much effort—\nHei’an says: Not departing from the present, the spiritual power unfolds.\nXi’an says: Without cultivation or verification, the work is complete.\nThe master says: How does it compare to simply abiding within?\nAgain he says:\nHeaven as the hut, earth as the foundation,\nThe four directions and eight extremes as the fence.\nWithin, there is a dull-witted man—\nHei’an says: Alone, he plays with the heart of heaven beneath the moon.\nThe master says: Better to overturn it all and not dwell.\nAgain he says:\nBefore heaven and earth divided, there was the boundless,\nBefore the boundless, there was the great beginning.\nWhat was the matter before the great beginning?\nHei’an says: Now it is not me, and I am not it.\nXi’an says: Through ancient and modern, only I alone am thus.\nThe master says: Now, the original body is seen as empty.\nThe master says:\nLast night at midnight, the sun was at noon,\nStraight up to the center of heaven, turning the Dipper’s handle.\nThe turning of the Dharma wheel shakes heaven and earth—\nHei’an says: In the Palace of Great Jewels, truly at ease.\nAgain he says: The myriad phenomena all come to pay homage.\nThe master says:\nDo not cling to mind or no-mind,\nBoth minds ultimately do not reach the truth.\nHaving mind is ultimately a burden—\nHei’an says: Grasping the center, there is truly a cause.\nThe master says: Forgetting both, one verifies the Dharma-body.\nAgain he says:\nI wield the hand of a killer,\nBrandishing the blade that gives life.\nI ask you, how to kill and give life?\nHei’an says: Giving life to what was previously dead.\nXi’an says: Severing all birth and death.\nThe master says: Neither of your blades has an edge.\nI answer: The Dharma-king’s decree is here.\nThe master says:\nA radiant, round pearl,\nWithout boundary outside, empty within.\nGently lifting it, there is no place to set it—\nHei’an says: Alone, it reveals itself, naturally at ease.\nXu’an says: Pervading the sand-realm, the true thusness appears.\nXi’an says: Whether releasing or gathering, all is within it.\nYi’an says: The origin dwells alone within.\nThe master says: How could you all not be attached?\n\nAh! Drawing me to dwell within the toad’s moon.\nAgain he says:\nForged into a searing red iron pellet,\nCrimson as the blazing sun, vast as the heavens.\nClamped and fed into every mouth—\nHei’an says: Chewing, one tastes the cool, singular Chan.\nXi’an says: Only when crushed is the full flavor known.\nThe master says: When liver and bowels rot away, the nature first hardens.\n\nThe master says: I play with poetry among the assembly of Dharma kin, yet my true intent lies not in verse but in the Dao. Should one grasp the Dao through poetry, the supreme, perfectly upright wonder is attained.\n\nNow, taking \"Turning the Deviant Back to the Right\" as the theme and rhyming with *ye zhe*, I compose a quatrain to prove that the theme must not be violated.\nHei’an says:\nHow laughable, the deluded disciples who fail to know their home—\nThey hail some false elder as their own father.\nHei’an extends the hand of non-action,\nPointing straight to Chang’an without hindrance.\n\nShi’an says:\nA winding path beside the byway, hundreds of households—\nEach mistakes a thief for father.\nNow that I’ve called them to turn their heads,\nThey trust at last the road to Penglai is unobstructed.\n\nJia’an says:\nThree thousand lesser dharmas bloom before the eye—\nTake care not to be misled, calling them father.\nSeizing by the nose, I drag them back to the great Dao,\nWhere the bright moon fills the sky, unclouded.\n\nThe master says:\nTo clasp a thief and cry injustice—how lamentable!\nWith eyes wide open, they still fail to recognize their father.\nNo wonder Qing’an wields a ruthless hand—\nShattering the heart’s aperture to demand boundlessness.\n\n*Record of Master Qing’an Yingchan, Scroll

awakened.\n\n**Explanatory Eulogy**\nRefine the spirit to temper the form,\nTemper the form to guard the essence.\nGuard the essence to master the qi,\nMaster the qi to abide in spirit.\nAbide in spirit to stabilize nature,\nStabilize nature to illuminate the heart.\nIlluminate the heart to awaken the root,\nAwaken the root to make the spirit numinous.\nNuminous spirit—qi settled,\nQi settled—essence congealed.\nEssence congealed—form solid,\nForm solid—longevity attained.\nLongevity—vision prolonged,\nVision prolonged—elixir perfected.\nElixir perfected—husk shed,\nHusk shed—primordial spirit.\nTo the right, this eulogy encapsulates the essence of spirit refinement.\nTo refine the spirit, first refine the essence.\nTo refine the essence, first master the qi.\nTo master the qi, first abide in stillness.\nAbiding in stillness brings clarity to the heart,\nNuminosity to the spirit,\nAnd stability to the qi.\nQi stabilized, essence congeals;\nEssence congealed, form solidifies.\nForm solidified, the yang spirit sheds its husk—\nThe Way of longevity and prolonged vision is complete.\nThe alchemical texts speak of *golden liquid refining the form*,\n*Golden liquid returning as elixir*—\nNone stray from this path.\n\n**Diagram of the Returning Elixir**\n\n**Explanatory Verse for the Diagram**\nWithin the eightfold golden crucible, the elixir is refined.\nEight is the completion number of wood—\nWood is nature, gold is emotion.\nSubduing emotion with nature,\nEntering the central palace—\nMetaphorically called the *earthen crucible*.\nThen, with fire, refine it:\nThe more it is refined, the more steadfast it becomes,\nThe more it is refined, the more round and luminous—\nHence the metaphor of the *Golden Elixir*.\nGuard it closely within the chambered furnace.\nFire is spirit,\nThe chamber is the crucible.\nThe primordial spirit enters the chamber,\nLike medicine in the furnace—\nTend it with utmost care,\nLest the slightest error be made.\nLead and mercury, ever prone to flee—\nHow could one not be vigilant?\nA hair’s breadth of deviation,\nAnd no elixir is formed.\n\nLacking earth, in the Kan palace, Ren and Gui escape.\nEarth is Kun—\nKun governs the body.\nWhen the body is still, the tiger roars;\nWhen the body moves, the tiger flees.\nThe tiger’s roar congeals the essence,\nThe tiger’s flight scatters it.\n\"Lacking earth\" means the body is unsettled;\n\"Ren and Gui escape\" means the essence is lost.\nScholars cannot afford to be careless.\n\nWhen the heart stirs, in the nature’s domain, Bing and Ding take flight.\nBing and Ding are fire, belonging to the heart.\nWhen the heart is settled, the dragon sings;\nWhen the heart is restless, the dragon bolts.\nThe dragon’s song solidifies the qi,\nThe dragon’s flight scatters it.\n\"Heart stirs\" means the fire blazes;\n\"Bing and Ding take flight\" means the qi disperses.\nThese two lines illustrate the flight of lead and the escape of mercury.\n\nWhere the master abides, yin demons are subdued.\nThe master is the original true nature,\nThe indestructible primordial spirit.\n\"Abides\" means the primordial spirit enters the chamber.\n\"Yin demons subdued\" means desires are extinguished.\nFor those who cultivate the Dao:\nWhen body and heart are still,\nSpirit congeals and qi solidifies.\n\nThe bright moon and sun—timely treasures radiant.\nThe sun and moon symbolize the essence of the body.\n\"Bright\" means the essence has congealed.\nWith deep practice and effort,\nRefining it into a single precious treasure,\nIts radiance shines through heaven and earth.\n\nThe one, two, three—primordial elements merge as one.\nHeaven-one generates water—essence.\nEarth-two generates fire—qi.\nHeaven-three generates wood—spirit.\nEssence, qi, and spirit refined into one,\nThe three and five unite—returning to the root.\n\nOld Man Gold lies dead, embracing the infant.\nThe character *gold* with *public* beside it is lead.\n\"Lead dies\" means the sea of desire is exhausted,\nPassions extinguished,\nThe sacred embryo formed,\nThe infant revealed.\n\nOne lead, two mercury meet in the three palaces.\nOne is the generative number of water—essence,\nMetaphorically called lead.\nTwo is the generative number of fire—qi,\nMetaphorically called cinnabar.\nThree is the generative number of wood—spirit,\nMetaphorically called mercury.\nThe three palaces are where the three primordials reside.\n\nEastern Sea’s Old Man Gold—refined a hundredfold.\nThe Eastern Sea symbolizes nature,\nOld Man Gold symbolizes emotion—\nAnother name for lead and mercury.\nEmotion returns to nature, refined by fire.\nOnly through a hundredfold refinement does it become the supreme treasure.\n\nWithin the body, the primordial serves as substance and function.\nWithin one’s own body lies the natural seed—\nTo seek it externally is folly.\nThe body’s primordial essence is the function of the Golden Elixir,\nThe heart’s primordial qi is its substance.\n\nThe wood-fluid of the Gen palace is the root and origin.\nThe Gen palace is earth,\nThe wood-fluid is mercury—\nTogether called *mercury within cinnabar*,\nThe mother of the Golden Elixir.\nLest scholars lack a standard,\nThese names are provisionally given.\n\nThe sun dwells in the moon’s cavern—truly luminous.\n\"Sun dwells in the moon’s cavern\" means yang enters the yin chamber,\nDrawing from Kan to fill Li,\nExtracting lead to replenish mercury,\nThe infant and the maiden unite,\nMetal and wood merge,\nWater and fire commingle.\n\nWhen the heart dies, the spirit lives—wisdom’s nature flows.\nWhen the heart dies, the spirit lives;\nWhen the spirit lives, wisdom flows.\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao:\nThe body like withered wood,\nThe heart like dead ashes,\nUtterly still.\nWith practice perfected,\nWisdom’s nature becomes round and luminous.\n\nWhen the work is complete and the water dries, lead and mercury conjoin.\nWhen the practice is fully perfected, the sea of desire naturally dries up.\nWhen nature and emotion merge as one, mercury and lead intertwine.\nWhen the fire-phase’s work is accomplished, form and spirit transcend.\nOnly then does the Golden Elixir take shape.\n\n*A single grain of the Great Elixir shines through heaven’s red—*\nThe Great Elixir is the Great Ultimate’s perfection.\nNot formed from external things, but refined from the original true suchness.\nWhen a person ingests and returns to it, they fruitfully attain the Golden Immortal.\n\n**In cultivating the Dao, first clarify the Three, Two, and One—**\nThe Three, Two, and One are essence, qi, and spirit.\nNot the essence of intercourse, the qi of breath, or the spirit of thought,\nBut the original essence, original qi, and original spirit.\nThis must not remain unclear.\n\n**In practicing the work, do not indulge the arising of the heart-mind.**\nDuring the practice, do not let the heart-mind wander.\nWhen the heart arises, fire flares upward; when the heart is settled, ignorance ceases.\nThroughout the twelve hours, constantly examine and restrain.\n\n**If people of this age would trust my words,**\nThose who study the Dao cling to texts and fixate on images, never attaining clarity themselves.\nLaozi said: *My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice,\nYet the world cannot know them, cannot practice them—such is the lack of trust.*\n\n**Strike and unite heaven and earth to house the true master.**\nHeaven and earth are body and heart.\nThose who truly trust strike and unite body and heart to recognize their original face.\nIf you meet face-to-face, you will decisively realize no coming, no going.\n\n**Kan-water’s waves surge due to lack of earth—**\nKan-water’s waves surge when essence does not abide.\n\"Lack of earth\" means the body is unsettled.\nAs the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *True earth restrains true lead.* This is it.\n\n**When the nature-heaven stirs thoughts, the arising heart is born—**\nWhen the nature-heaven stirs thoughts, emotions move within.\n\"The arising heart\" is distraction.\nAs the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *True lead restrains true mercury.* This is it.\n\n**To establish the mercury furnace, first work with water—**\nIn setting up the furnace and establishing the tripod, first stabilize essence—hence \"first work with water.\"\nWhen essence is stabilized, qi congeals.\nLead and mercury naturally conjoin.\nAs the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *Lead and mercury return to the earthen cauldron.*\n\n**Within the cauldron, harmonize and refine the Eight Metals—**\nThe Eight Metals are emotion and nature.\nThe cauldron is the Yellow Center.\nWhen nature and emotion return to the center, body and heart become profoundly still.\nAs the *Elixir Scriptures* say: *Body and heart still and unmoving.* This is it.\n\n**When eyes droop in sleep, work with water-mercury—**\nDuring practice, the demon of sleep disrupts.\nIn sleep, draw fire from water to attack mercury.\n\n**When the heart’s breath settles, refine the Eastern Metal—**\nWhen body and heart are unmoving, metal and wood merge.\nWhen breath settles, refine—\nThe one nature becomes round and luminous, all conditions cease.\n\n**The cart moves because the axle turns—I awaken to the heart-mind—**\nThe cart moves because the axle turns; people move because the heart moves.\nWhen the axle turns, awakening—\nOne who understands this principle attains perfection.\n\n**The Three Palaces, Two, and One—sun and moon shine bright—**\nThe Three Origins unite as one; the two substances become round.\nThe Three Palaces shine—\nBright as the sun and moon, they illumine heaven and earth.\n\nMeng’an said: *Master Qing’an composed these two nested-character and hidden-head poems not to indulge in cleverness,\nBut to elucidate the substance and function of the Golden Elixir, revealing the subtlest without gap.\nThe nested-character ode speaks of the Elixir’s substance; the hidden-head poem, of its function.\nThe hidden-head’s intent expresses the Elixir Dao’s subtlety,\nWhile the self-explication of its details makes the Elixir’s principles manifest.\nIf one views the diagrams and grasps the meaning, the Golden Elixir’s work is complete.*\nThus, he appended them to the collection to share with fellow cultivators.\n\n*Qing’an Yingchan’s Record, Volume Five concludes*\n*Qing’an Yingchanzi’s Record, Volume Six*\n\nThe disciple Sun’an Cai Zhi recorded this:\n\n**Yellow Center Resolves Doubts #1**\n\nThe Master said: *The ancestral masters, perfected beings, and highest sages of former ages possessed the Supreme Correct and True Dao, which they transmitted to the world to deliver people. Do you truly understand this?*\n\nDing’an replied: *This disciple has only just entered the Mystery Gate—utterly foolish and dull. Yet by your grace, Master, I have been accepted, a fortune of a thousand lifetimes. The Supreme Correct and True Dao I do not yet know; I humbly beseech your instruction.*\n\nThe Master said: *The Supreme Correct and True Dao is that which admits no higher, the most profound of the profound, beyond all form or image, spontaneously so—utterly perfect and wondrous. The sages were compelled to name it the Dao. Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this, and none have achieved cultivation without it. The oral transmission of the sacred masters, the heart-to-heart transmission of successive generations—the essential teaching of the Golden Elixir—is precisely the wondrous Dao of the Supreme Correct and True.*\n\nDing’an said: *The Supreme Correct and True’s wondrousness is likened to the Golden Elixir. What is its principle?*\n\nThe Master said: *The character \"gold\" (金) signifies firmness; \"elixir\" (丹), roundness. The Buddhists compare it to Perfect Enlightenment; the Confucians, to the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is no other thing—it is simply the original, singular numen. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, firm as gold, round as cinnabar, growing ever brighter with refinement. The Buddhists say: \"○ This is True Suchness.\" The Confucians say: \"○ This is the Supreme Ultimate.\" Our Dao says: \"○ This is the Golden Elixir.\" The substance is the same; only the names differ.*\n\n*The Book of Changes states: \"In Change there is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Supreme Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang—Heaven and Earth. Humanity is born between Heaven and Earth; this is called the Dao of Jiang Cai, and it is fully contained within the single body. The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the Elixir Dao, the Supreme Ultimate is the mother of the Elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury.*\n\n*What is called lead and mercury is not quicksilver, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, or herbs and trees; nor is it the essences, fluids, snivel, spittle, heart-kidney qi, or blood. Rather, it is the primordial essence within the body and the primordial spirit within the heart. When body and mind are unmoving, essence and qi congeal and coalesce—this is likened to the Elixir. What is called the Elixir is the Elixir Body. ○ This is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the Elixir is called Elixir Accomplishment. The so-called Elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source, the attainment of the Correct and True.*\n\n*Few in the world understand this. Today’s cultivators of the Dao mostly lack correct transmission; they all seek outwardly, following the deviant and turning from the correct. Thus, though many study, few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three refuges and five counterfeits; some refine the qi beyond the clouds and mist; some refine the essence and brilliance of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine pellets forming in empty space to become the Elixir. Some imagine objects in the cinnabar field to be the Elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the brows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to return it to the navel. Then there are those who swallow saliva and ingest fluids, inhale the new and exhale the old, practice the Eight Brocades, the Three-Character Method, shake the spine, turn the windlass, close the Tail Gate, guard the navel’s stem, gather heavenly water, calcine autumn stone, bend and stretch in daoyin, massage and regulate, silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, press the tongue to the upper palate, return the three fields, close and conduct qi, amass great fire in the bladder, or drill the five phases into the bitter sea. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent effort and gathering, they ultimately cannot accomplish the great work.*\n\n*The scriptures say: \"The correct Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true path often leads into deviant sects.\" This is what they mean. The essentials of the utmost truth are utterly simple and easy—difficult to encounter, yet easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected being who points the way, none fail to succeed.*\n\nDing’an said: *This disciple, by past karmic affinity, has been fortunate to meet you, Master, and receive the Dharma-milk. I humbly beseech your illumination of the essentials of the Golden Elixir.*\n\nThe Master said: *Listen carefully now, and I shall expound. The practice of the Elixir lies entirely in seizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, the sun and moon as water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the crow and hare as the medicinal substances. Rely on the celestial pivot’s revolutions, depend on the Dipper’s handle to advance and retreat. Gather qi at the proper time, move the tally according to principle. Advance the fire and retreat the tally, harmonize the Four Images. Pursue the two qi to return them to the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace. Return to the root and revert to the origin, restore the mandate. When merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its shell to become an immortal—this is called Elixir Accomplishment.*\n\nDing’an said: *The transformations of Heaven and Earth seem difficult to seize.*\n\nThe Master said: *It is entirely within the single body—what difficulty is there? Heaven and Earth are the physical form; water and fire are essence and qi; yin and yang are body and mind; the crow and hare are nature and emotion. Thus, the physical form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotion and nature as the mechanism of transformation, body and mind as the medicinal materials. The sages, fearing that students would have no standard to follow, used Heaven and Earth as metaphors. The human body and the transformations of Heaven and Earth are no different. The two words \"body\" and \"mind\" are the medicine, are the fire.*\n\n*Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, yang lead and yin mercury, Kan man and Li woman, sun crow and moon hare—none lie outside the two words \"body\" and \"mind.\" The celestial pivot’s revolutions are the celestial mind. The Elixir scriptures say: \"If the human mind unites with the celestial mind, the inversion of yin and yang ceases in an instant.\" They also say: \"Observe the Dao through the mind, and the Dao is the mind; observe the mind through the Dao, and the mind is the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Dipper’s handle in its revolutions—this is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet many of today’s students cling to physical forms, some claiming it lies between the brows, others at the navel wheel, or between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or in the bladder, or in the Cinnabar Field, or in the nine palaces of the head as the Mysterious Pass, or pointing to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or to the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all these are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one must not seek it outside this body either. The various Elixir scriptures do not specify its location, precisely because it defies description in words or brush. Hence the term \"Mysterious Pass.\" The sages merely inscribed a single character: *zhong* (\"center\"). Through this *zhong*, the Mysterious Pass becomes clear.\n\nThis *zhong* is not the center between inner and outer, nor the center among the four directions or above and below, nor the center within a center. The Buddhists say: \"Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a moment, what is your original face?\" This is the *zhong* of Chan. The Confucians say: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused—this is called *zhong*.\" The Daoists say: \"Where thoughts do not stir—this is called *zhong*.\" Thus, the Three Teachings employ but a single *zhong*.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Still and unmoving—this is the essence of *zhong*; responsive and penetrating—this is the function of *zhong*.\" Laozi says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\" Now, in the *Fu* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yin. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. At this very point of movement lies the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort in the moments of thought and action throughout the twelve double-hours. Over time, the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once seen, the medicinal substances, fire phases, withdrawal and addition, and even the transformation of the embryo and spiritual transcendence—none lie beyond this single aperture.\n\nTo \"gather the medicine\" is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time. This time is not the winter solstice, nor the waxing moon, nor the midnight hour. The master says: \"In refining the Elixir, there is no need to seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang naturally arises.\" He also says: \"When lead reaches *gui*-birth, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Thus, seek the moment of *gui*-birth within the body—this is the arising of one yang, the time to begin gathering.\n\nAfter the union of the two qi, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and avoid excess. \"When gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally lack clear standards, so the yearly cycle of seasons—cold and heat coming and going—serves as the model for the fire tally. The waxing and waning of the moon also illustrate the principles of withdrawal and addition. For example: at the winter solstice, yang is born—the *Fu* hexagram, twelfth month; two yangs—the *Lin* hexagram, first month; three yangs—the *Tai* hexagram, second month; four yangs—the *Dazhuang* hexagram, third month; five yangs—the *Guai* hexagram, fourth month; six yangs—the pure yang *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born, fifth month; one yin—the *Gou* hexagram, sixth month; two yins—the *Dun* hexagram, seventh month; three yins—the *Pi* hexagram, eighth month; four yins—the *Guan* hexagram, ninth month; five yins—the *Bo* hexagram, tenth month; pure yin—the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, returning to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and withdrawing the fire tally.\n\nAlas, students cling to texts and adhere to images, beginning the fire advance at the winter solstice, withdrawing the tally at the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months, unaware of the essentials. Seeing students misdirect their efforts, the sages compressed the yearly cycle into a single month, using the new and full moons to represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters to represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days to represent a month, and thirty days to represent a year. Yet students then fixated on the moon for their practice. The sages further compressed the moon’s waxing and waning into a single day, using midnight and noon to represent the new and full moons, and dawn and dusk to represent the two quarters. Students then fixated on a single day for their practice.\n\nMasters of recent times have said: \"Within a single moment of effort lies a year’s cycle of seasons.\" They also said: \"Before father and mother were born, where were the years, months, days, and hours?\" This is how the sages guided students to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Alas, those who cling to forms do not fathom the principle, adhering to texts and images, vainly exhausting their minds.\n\nI now directly point this out to you: the moment of *gui*-birth within the body is the arising of one yang. When yang ascends and yin descends, this is three yangs. When yin and yang separate, this is four yangs—corresponding to the second month, like the waxing moon, akin to the *mao* hour, the time for bathing, then advancing the fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, this is six yangs. After yin and yang unite and spirit and qi blend, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing when to stop, all previous efforts are wasted. Hence it is said: \"When elixir gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Then withdraw the tally, corresponding to one yin, and when yin and yang separate, this is three yins—yin and yang in their hidden positions, the time for bathing, corresponding to the eighth month, like the waning moon, akin to the *you* hour. Then proceed to six yins, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—in an instant, a single celestial revolution is complete.\n\nSimply follow this practice. Over time, effort will gradually congeal and solidify, transforming the formless into form, coalescing into the sacred embryo, called the completion of the Elixir.\n\nDing’an said: \"The initial effort and the application of the celestial revolution’s fire phases have been revealed by the master, yet the various alternate names remain unclear. I hope the master will clarify.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Alternate names are merely metaphors, all contained within the two words 'body' and 'mind.' At the outset of practice, concentrate the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s qi, and regulate the nose’s breath—let the four great elements remain unmoving.\"\n\nLet the essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle into their proper places—this is called the \"Five Qi Assembling at the Origin.\" Drawing them into the Central Palace is called \"Gathering the Five Phases.\" When the heart remains unmoving, the dragon intones; when the body remains unmoving, the tiger roars. When both body and heart remain unmoving, this is called \"Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger.\" The essence and qi are metaphorically likened to the tortoise and serpent, while the body and heart are likened to the dragon and tiger. When dragon, tiger, tortoise, and serpent merge into one, this is called \"Harmonizing the Four Symbols.\" Using nature to govern emotion is called \"Metal and Wood in Union.\" Using essence to guide qi is called \"Water and Fire in Intercourse.\" Wood and fire share the same source, the two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share the same source—north’s one and west’s four are held in common. Earth resides in the Central Palace, belonging to the self; the five numbers of wu and ji return to their original generative count. When heart, body, and intent merge into one, the three families meet and form the sacred embryo—this is collectively called the \"Three and Five in Fusion.\"\n\nRefining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—this is called the \"Three Flowers Gathering in the Tripod,\" also known as the \"Three Passes.\" Today’s scholars often designate the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow as the Three Passes, but these are merely methods of practice, not the essential points. Wherever the heart stirs with thought is the Mysterious Female; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, heart, and intent are the Three Essentials. The nature within the heart is called \"mercury within cinnabar,\" while the qi within the body is called \"metal within water.\" Metal is born of water, the mother of water; when metal returns to dwell within water, it is called \"the mother concealed in the child’s womb.\" Let no external realm enter, nor any internal realm depart—this is called \"Sealing and Preserving.\" Stillness without motion is called \"Nurturing the Fire.\" Emptiness and spontaneity are called \"Application.\" Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called \"Guarding the City.\" Subduing the inner realm is called \"Field Warfare.\" True mercury is called the \"Radiant Maiden,\" true lead is called the \"Infant.\" The embryonic intent is called the \"Yellow Dame.\" Nature and emotion are called husband and wife. Clarifying the heart and stabilizing intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances coalesce, the three origins converge—this is called \"Forming the Embryo.\" Cherishing the numinous root is called \"Warm Nurturing.\" Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—this is called \"Protecting and Sustaining.\" Let no deviation occur, for even a hair’s breadth of error will render all prior effort void.\n\nWhen the yang spirit manifests, this is called \"Shedding the Embryo.\" Returning to the root and restoring life, reverting to one’s original state—this is called \"Transcendence.\" Shattering emptiness is called \"Completion.\" Ding’an asked: \"When the Golden Elixir is complete, can it still be seen?\" The master answered: \"It can.\" He asked again: \"Does it have form?\" The master answered: \"It has no form.\" He asked again: \"If it has no form, how can it be seen?\" The master answered: \"The Golden Elixir is merely a forced name—how could it have form? That it can be seen does not mean it can be seen with the eyes. As the Buddhists say: 'Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see.' The Daoist scriptures say: 'Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao.' Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen. Listened for but not heard, yet never not heard. What is called visible and audible is not within the reach of ears and eyes, but is seen by the heart and heard by intent. It is like a great wind rising: entering the mountains, it shakes the trees; entering the water, it stirs the waves—how can one say it does not exist? Observed, it cannot be seen; grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The substance of the Golden Elixir is likewise. Thus, in the beginning of refinement, being and non-being are mutually employed, movement and stillness follow one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas are empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both relinquished—only then is the Mystic Pearl formed, the Great One returned to truth.\n\nWhen nature and life are both preserved, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—this is the fruition of the Golden Immortal. Thus, the scriptures and alchemical texts employ various alternate names to guide learners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the sublime, until they perceive nature and awaken to emptiness. Yet the true matter does not lie on paper. It is like a boat for crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed. As the ancients said: 'Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap.' This is what is meant. Moreover, this collection of mine must not be rigidly held to the page. One should only chew it thoroughly, savor its flavor, and delve into its source. Perhaps at a single word, the heart’s ground may open, and one may directly enter the realm of non-action—this is not difficult. There are further subtleties beyond, not easily spoken of lightly. One must seek them beyond the words, depending on how far your practice has progressed. There will be heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction. For now, devote yourself earnestly to the practice. The profound precepts issue a solemn warning, thus I offer this verse:\n\n*I grant you a scroll of the Golden Elixir—*\n*Devote yourself earnestly to seek within.*\n*If you can fathom the meaning in these words,*\n*The wondrous function will pervade the Great Void.\"*\n\n**A Guide to Refining Nature**\n\nThe study of nature and principle has no fixed sequence. Some say one must exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and arrive at life—this follows an order. Others say the three are accomplished simultaneously. Today’s scholars do not know which is correct. Let me explain clearly. Those of middling and lesser capacity must proceed gradually: first exhaust the principles of things, and only when fully exhausted can nature be fulfilled. If even one thing remains unexhausted, there will be an obstruction. One must first exhaust everything thoroughly to perceive one’s own nature, and only then proceed to life. Those of superior wisdom are not so. By exhausting a single principle, all principles become clear; fulfilling nature and arriving at life are accomplished all at once. It is like the Buddhist precepts, concentration, and wisdom—all are one.\n\nFor those of the lowest capacity, forgetting emotion and cutting off thought is called \"precepts\"; stillness without motion is called \"concentration\"; silent recognition and subtle penetration are called \"wisdom.\" Those of superior capacity are not so.\n\nThe superior adept, in observing precepts, naturally attains concentration; in concentration, wisdom spontaneously flows through—all three matters are accomplished at once.\n\nThose who refine the Golden Elixir begin gradually: first refining essence into qi, then progressively refining qi into spirit, and finally refining spirit to return to emptiness. The sudden teaching is not so. Here, essence, qi, and spirit are called the primordial medicinal substances, and the work is completed all at once.\n\nIn seeking thus, what sequence is there in the study of nature and principle? If one is a man of resolve, all three matters are accomplished at once. And what does it mean for all three to be accomplished at once? Hmph—like a tangled skein of silk in a pot, one slash severs it all.\n\n*The Shortcut to Immortality*\nMaster Yian of Yian Hermitage was a worthy magistrate of Xinghua. His benevolence extended to all things, and though he lived amidst the red dust of the world, his heart dwelled in the mysterious realm—truly a man who dwelt in the world yet transcended it. One day, he visited me in my Toad Hollow and sought instruction. When I briefly outlined the work, his questions and responses were uncommon, leaving me no choice but to speak. Thus, I composed these nine foundational matters and presented them to him, aligning with the principle of the Nine Returns. Within, the transformations of the Golden Elixir are elucidated, with references to the profound tenets of the Chan school. Study this text, savor its meaning, and seek its essence deeply—naturally, the distinction between self and other will vanish, and no view of difference will remain. As for the essentials of ascending to truth and treading the realm of the immortals, nothing surpasses this, hence the title *The Shortcut to Immortality*.\n\nWritten by Li Chunsu, the Luminous Toad of Clear Hermitage in Duliang.\n\n1. **Commencing at the Right Time**\nTo refine the Golden Elixir, one must first understand where to begin. Without knowing the initial work, all manner of contrivances and fabrications are futile. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not force guesses.\" One must have a true teacher point out where to place the hands and feet. Even knowing where to begin, one must also know the timing. This \"time\" refers to the moment of the first yang. Most people mistakenly identify the hour of *zi* as the time of the first yang—this is incorrect. To fixate on the hour is wrong, yet to say there is no time is also wrong. Have you not heard Lü the Perfected say: \"Refine the self and await the time\"? And have you not heard the Perfected One of Purple Yang say: \"When lead sees *gui* arise, swiftly gather it—scripture says the time arrives and the spirit knows\"? Pondering this, you will understand: when *gui* arises within the body, that is the time of the first yang. And what is the time when *gui* arises? Hmph—walking to the end of the water, sitting to watch the clouds rise.\n\n2. **True Lead and True Mercury**\nOnce the timing for commencing is known, one must recognize true lead and true mercury. Lead and mercury are not common lead, black tin, cinnabar, or quicksilver—they are the two original substances within one’s own body. Forcibly named as medicinal substances, their wondrous resonance and union are metaphorically called lead and mercury. Lead’s nature tends to fly, mercury’s to flee. When lead sees mercury, it does not fly; when mercury sees lead, it does not flee. The medicinal substances within the body are likewise. Do you wish to see the medicine? Hmph—clouds rising over the southern and northern mountains.\n\n3. **Gathering the Medicine into the Crucible**\nRecognizing it is not remarkable; knowing how to gather it is the marvel. To gather the medicinal substances, one does not depart from movement and stillness. Gathered from within movement and stillness, they are sent into the crucible of effortless transformation, refined with the true fire of samadhi into purple powder, coagulated into the mysterious pearl. Consuming it, one may attain longevity and enduring vision. How to understand the phrase \"coagulating the mysterious pearl\"? Hmph—grasping ten thousand acres of clouds from the green mountain, scooping the reflection of the moon from the azure pool.\n\n4. **Drawing Lead and Adding Mercury**\nHaving mastered the refinement of the medicine, one must understand drawing and adding. Drawing and adding mean removing excess to supplement deficiency. All beings in the world—celestial, human, asura, and non-human—have emotions in excess and nature deficient; thoughts in excess and mind deficient; essence in excess and qi deficient. Forgetting essence to nurture nature, gathering thoughts to return to mind, refining essence into qi and beyond—this is called drawing and adding. Yet even if one draws excess and supplements deficiency, it is not extraordinary. There is still a higher matter: one must reach the point of neither drawing nor adding. What is neither drawing nor adding? Hmph—neither surplus nor lack, just right when taken by hand.\n\n5. **The Fire-Timing of the Microcosmic Orbit**\nWhen one reaches the point of neither drawing nor adding, it is precisely the time to apply the fire-timing. It is also said: \"True fire has no timing.\" And: \"Do not impose timing upon the fire.\" Hmph—these two phrases have blinded the eyes of many and opened the eyes of many. I now directly point it out to you. Fire is the heart; timing is thought. Refining thought with the heart is called fire-timing. When the heart is settled and thought ceases, the fire-timing is applied. Though it is said thus, one must not cling to heart and thought, nor depart from them. Departing from heart and thought is delusion; clinging to them is attachment. Neither within nor apart from heart and thought—how then? Hmph—cold comes and heat goes, autumn harvests and winter stores.\n\n6. **Maintaining Fullness and Securing Achievement**\nDuring the practice, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing how to maintain fullness, all prior efforts are wasted. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"If one’s heart is not yet content with maintaining fullness, one may one day suffer disgrace.\" The Supreme Lord said: \"Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\" This is the meaning. And what is maintaining fullness? Hmph—full yet not overflowing, thus one long retains abundance.\n\n7. **Securing the Crucible and Furnace**\nHaving understood maintaining fullness, one must further secure the achievement. Securing means sealing the earthen cauldron tightly.\n\nA hair’s breadth of deviation sets heaven and earth apart. Thus, when the fire-tending is complete and the cycles of the celestial revolution are fulfilled, one abides in silent radiance, the true breath flowing ceaselessly. Throughout the twelve hours, one must vigilantly attend to it, until the elixir ripens and spontaneity is attained. And what are the signs of the elixir’s ripening? Hmph—this night a full measure is poured: where is there no clear light?\n\n8. **Nurturing and Cultivating**\nOnce the golden elixir takes form, further nurturing and cultivation are required. What is nurturing and cultivating? It is like a woman carrying a child. Throughout the twelve hours, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, one must proceed with utmost care—like an ox nurturing its yellow essence, like a dragon guarding its pearl—constantly preserving it within, never allowing interruption, until the moment of parturition, when one’s feet stand firmly upon solid ground. Do you understand parturition? Hmph—when the melon is ripe, the stem falls away.\n\n9. **Regulating the Spirit and Emerging from the Shell**\nAfter parturition, one regulates the spirit in its comings and goings, proceeding with even greater care, like a mother cherishing her infant. In daily life and diet, one must always hold it close; when it begins to move, one must watch over it. If not watched over, it may fall into pits and ravines. Only when the work is established may one depart from the mother. The work of regulating the spirit is just the same. Master Zhongli said:\n*\"The child is young and not yet grown,\nWholly dependent on the mother’s grace.\nAfter three years and nine cycles, worldly ties are done—\nThen roaming heaven and earth, it needs no kin.\"*\nThis is the meaning. Though spoken thus, do not take it as a mere state of affairs.\n\nOnly by guarding against danger and remaining vigilant at every moment—until the crucible and furnace are entirely overturned—does one attain carefree ease, moving without restraint, roaming beyond the material world, and merging with the Great Void as one body.\n\nHow to overturn the crucible and furnace?\nWith a single phrase—*home shattered, people lost* (☯十力)—the empty sky shatters into fragments, revealing the solitary cinnabar toad.\n\n**Water Tune Prelude: Revealing the Nature’s Principle**\nThe supreme Dao speaks no words,\nIts divine workings beyond all measure.\nOriginally complete, nothing to add,\nNothing to subtract—no gain, no loss.\nNot in wide learning or broad study,\nBut in silent communion and deep reflection,\nWithin stillness, ponder carefully.\nThe true intent within—\nNever departs from the Central Yellow.\n\nRound and full,\nRadiant and bright,\nManifesting in majesty.\nWithout excess or lack,\nThe entire being, formless, aligns with true constancy.\nSimply recognize this now in silence—\nIt is Maitreya of the future,\nTo be embraced directly.\nOpening the eye atop the crown,\nNothing in all realms can conceal it.\n\n**The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir**\nThe Great Dao is wordless,\nYet without words, its Dao cannot be revealed.\nThe Golden Elixir is formless,\nYet without form, how can its elixir be seen?\nThus, the sages modeled heaven and earth,\nTransforming people through the Dao,\nEstablishing myriad names,\nSetting forth countless forms,\nComposing scriptures and classics on the elixir,\nTo guide and enlighten all beings.\nAlas, today’s scholars cling to forms and texts,\nGenerating interpretations,\nSpawning heterodoxies,\nSplitting the Three Teachings into divergent paths,\nUnable to unite as one—\nAll because they know not the source.\nNow, I set forth the secret essentials of the Golden Elixir’s transformations,\nComposing thirty-five verses.\nClarifying the supreme principle,\nDirectly pointing to its various names,\nI title this *The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir*,\nOffering it to the Retired Hermit of the Thatched Hut,\nThat he may easily comprehend.\nIf one grasps the meaning through these words,\nOne naturally embraces the root and returns to emptiness,\nDirectly entering the wondrous realm of the Inaudible and Invisible.\n\n**Nature and Life**\nThe primordial true suchness is called *nature*,\nThe primordial unity of qi is called *life*.\nNature is originally vast in spiritual power,\nYet bound by the body, it loses its efficacy.\nNow, if one fully lets go,\nIt once more radiates luminous clarity.\n\n**Substance and Function**\nModeling heaven and earth is called *substance*,\nEmbracing yin while holding yang is called *function*.\nHeaven and earth establish the foundation,\nYin and yang drive the mechanism of transformation.\nThese pivotal principles—\nFew truly understand.\n\n**Dragon and Tiger**\nThe primordial qi within the heart is called the *dragon*,\nThe primordial essence within the body is called the *tiger*.\nWhen nature is settled, the dragon returns to water,\nWhen emotions are forgotten, the tiger withdraws to the mountain.\nWhen nature and emotion harmonize,\nOne’s name is enrolled among the immortals.\n\n**Lead and Mercury**\nThe numinous spring of the Great One is called *lead*,\nThe fiery palace of Vermilion Mound is called *mercury*.\nTo refine the mercury of Southern Mountain,\nFirst draw forth the lead of Northern Sea.\nWith body at ease and mind unmoved,\nThe supreme treasure solidifies.\n\n**Crucible and Furnace**\nThe true metal of Qian Palace is called the *crucible*,\nThe true earth of Kun Palace is called the *furnace*.\nThe crucible is forged of Qian’s metal,\nThe furnace must be enveloped in Kun’s earth.\nOnce body and mind are upright,\nThe crucible and furnace stand firm.\n\n**Elixir Kiln**\nThe singular true nature is called the *elixir*,\nThe four great illusory aggregates are called the *kiln*.\nThe illusory body serves as the elixir kiln,\nTrue suchness is the medicinal material.\nWith unceasing effort,\nThe spiritual embryo forms within.\n\n**Being and Nonbeing**\nChasing wind and clutching shadows is called *being*,\nScooping water to toy with the moon is called *nonbeing*.\nOnly when one grasps the departure from Kan and Li,\nDoes one know that being is nonbeing.\nWhen being and nonbeing merge as one,\nThey are refined into a luminous pearl.\n\n**Medicine and Fire**\nDrawing in emotions with qi is called *medicine*,\nRefining thoughts with the mind is called *fire*.\nGathering the medicine is fundamentally easy,\nThe firing process is likewise not difficult.\nWith not a single matter in the heart,\nTrue fire penetrates the Three Passes.\n\n**Mysterious Female**\nThe valley of emptiness is called the *mysterious*,\nThe aperture of returning to the root is called the *female*.\nWhen qi returns to the root within the empty valley,\nThis is the gate of heaven and earth.\nOnce the opening and closing are mastered,\nThe golden crucible remains warm as broth.\n\n**Centrality and Uprightness**\nStillness without movement is called *centrality*,\nResponsiveness without obstruction is called *uprightness*.\nOnly when the heart is tranquil is it upright,\nOnly when the spirit is clear is it central.\nAbiding in profound stillness,\nHeavenly principle responds and flows.\n\n**Numinous Treasure**\nThe hundred spirits undispersed are called *numinous*,\nThe myriad qi perpetually present are called *treasure*.\nThe treasure within one’s own body,\nManifests efficacy in all actions.\nIf one can truly contain and nurture it,\nIt radiates great luminosity.\n\n**Purity and Stillness**\nThe cessation of waves in the numinous source is called *purity*,\nThe absence of dust in the field of nature is called *stillness*.\nThe spirit-water is originally pure,\nYet following the current, it becomes turbid.\nNow, if one remains unmoving,\nThe sun of wisdom naturally rises from east to west.\n\n**Withdrawing and Adding**\nForgetting emotions and severing thoughts is called *withdrawing*,\nRefining emotions and nurturing nature is called *adding*.\nNurturing nature is adding mercury,\nForgetting emotions is reducing lead.\nOnce form and spirit attain perfection,\nThere is neither gain nor loss.\n\n**Bathing**\nPolishing the ground of the heart is called *bathing*,\nWashing away toil and dust is called *washing*.\nTo subdue the wild ape,\nFirst capture the unruly horse.\nNot a speck of dust clings—\nSpirit and qi unite with the heart.\n\n**Return and Union**\nYin at its extreme gives rise to yang—this is *return*,\nYang at its extreme gives rise to yin—this is *union*.\nWhen yin reaches its limit, yang returns,\nWhen yang arises, union follows.\nIf the adept understands this principle,\nThey surely perceive the heart of heaven.\n\n**Intercourse and Union**\nThe blending of two things is called *intercourse*,\nThe convergence of the three primals is called *union*.\nThe maiden resides in the eastern chamber,\nThe metal lord dwells in the west.\nThe Yellow Dame brings them together,\nMatched as husband and wife.\n\n**Warm Nurturing**\nGentle, ceaseless true breathing is called *warmth*,\nContaining light in silent stillness is called *nurturing*.\nOnce the infant within the womb is formed,\nApply the work of warm nurturing.\nTend to it constantly,\nAnd upon shedding the shell, spiritual powers manifest.\n\n**Return and Restoration**\nQi uniting with spirit is called *return*,\nEmotions returning to nature is called *restoration*.\nTo restore gold to nature,\nFirst teach fire to return to the heart.\nWhen the two become one,\nAll the earth turns to gold.\n\n**Gathering and Release**\nEntering the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible is called *gathering*,\nExiting the paths of delusion is called *release*.\nThe eternal numinous youth,\nWhose spiritual powers are beyond measure.\nWhen released, he pervades the Dharma realm,\nWhen gathered, he conceals himself like a millet pearl.\n\n**Emptiness and Perfection**\nThe absence of being and nonbeing is called *emptiness*,\nThe hollowness within and without is called *perfection*.\nClinging to being leads to illusion,\nWhile grasping at nonbeing misses the mark.\n\n**Emptiness and Perfection**\nBeing and nonbeing both unestablished,\nWithin and without utterly void.\n\n**Spiritual Penetration**\nAwakening to the root and knowing the source is called *spiritual*,\nVast and without attainment is called *penetration*.\nSeeing through the face of birth-and-mother,\nNeither Buddha nor immortal remains.\nVast and without attainment,\nLet the sea become fields as it will.\n\n**Round Illumination**\nReturning wholly to the Great Ultimate is called *round*,\nFusing through true emptiness is called *illumination*.\nWhen effort reaches the elixir’s symbolic form,\nAnd merit is complete, the treasure becomes firm.\nThe moon of nature appears in shape,\nIllumining what preceded birth.\n\n**Awakening and Illumination**\nOverturning the ten thousand illusions is called *awakening*,\nRevealing the true constant alone is called *illumination*.\nQi returns to the primordial beginning,\nThe original spirit reverts to the Great Origin.\nThe ten thousand conditions are overturned,\nThe solitary true suchness revealed.\n\n**Integral Perfection**\nPure and undivided is called *integral*,\nOne with the Great Void is called *true*.\nOne principle amid a hundred concerns,\nConverging paths though diverse in course.\nGrasping the principle of integral perfection,\nBody and mind merge with the Great Origin.\n\n**Quatrain Poems**\n*For Cheng Jie’an*\n\nIn non-doing, best to act within the nothing,\nNaturally the jade toad shines on the azure cliff.\nNightlong labor without ceasing,\nQi rounded, spirit complete, the infant is born.\n\nJie’an sees through the world’s heat and cold,\nHones his brilliance, buries his light, nurturing tranquility.\nYet there is one true joy,\nScooping water from the emerald pool to play with the jade toad.\n\nBrother Jie, pure and without thing,\nOnly the jade toad nurtured within.\nWhen merit is complete and the three-five elixir formed,\nIts radiance shines south and north, east and west.\n\nConfucianism exhausts heavenly principle, Buddhism probes Chan,\nDaoism refines the golden elixir by natural law.\nOnly the jade toad unifies all,\nAt the crown’s gate, the eye of Dharma-body complete.\n\nThe master is originally a learned Confucian,\nYet also received the true lineage of immortals.\nPenetrating true emptiness to achieve great awakening,\nThe jade toad’s sign appears in earth and heaven alone.\n\n**Five Auspicious Quatrains of Seclusion**\n*For Cheng Jie’an*\n\nApart from the mysterious pass,\nAll else is not true.\nNon-doing ends in stumbling,\nAction labors in vain.\n\nNature settled, fire and water part,\nMind clear, wood and metal merge.\nThe four return to one place,\nAll rests in Jie’an’s completion.\n\nLiver and lungs are not dragon and tiger,\nHeart and kidneys are not fire and water.\nNature and emotion blend,\nSun and moon naturally embrace.\n\nIntention must abide in the center,\nMind must not stray outward.\nJie’an ever steadfast in oneness,\nThe embryo nurtured, the infant formed.\n\nThe Cowherd stands by the river,\nThe Weaver Girl crosses the bridge.\nOnce they meet,\nTheir two intentions harmonize.\n\nFrom the sea’s depths, red flame arises,\nFrom the mountain’s peak, white waves surge.\nJie’an’s joyous place,\nEver hearing the wooden man’s song.\n\nThe crucible stands, the embryo crucible suspended,\nThe furnace holds the Great One’s furnace.\nKnowing only the joy of generation,\nThen one may begin the work.\n\nIn an instant, emptiness becomes full,\nIn a moment, being enters nonbeing.\nJie’an’s work complete,\nHe obtains the night-shining pearl.\n\nWithout medicine, do not lightly ascend,\nWith living lead, hasten the work.\nDrive the chariot with the water tiger,\nRaise the fire with the mysterious wind.\n\nThe two things unite in emotion,\nThe three passes open their paths.\nWhere nature’s heaven clouds arise,\nLight illumines Jie’an in red.\n\nThe subtlety of non-doing revealed,\nThe mysterious pass profound and obscure.\nSeeking heaven’s treasure,\nLook for gold within the water.\n\nThe numinous ground without the slightest veil,\nJie’an without a speck of dust.\nThe jade toad round and bright,\nIts light piercing the nine heavens.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five,\nEast, west, south, north, center.\nThe five phases drill into one place,\nOnly relying on the Metal Lord.\n\nAttaining the One, all things are complete,\nWhere does the One reside?\nIf you can further forget the One,\nThis is the golden elixir.\n\nThe formless preceded heaven and earth,\nThe shapeless preceded the primordial chaos.\nBefore heaven, chaos intermingled,\nBeyond the mysterious, no further mystery.\n\nAbiding in sincerity, one enters sagehood,\nOffering reverence, one penetrates the mysterious.\nIn movement and stillness, nothing attained,\nCarefree, delighting in spontaneity.\n\n**On the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism**\n*For Cheng Jie’an*\n\n*Confucian Principle*\nExtending knowledge, investigating things...\n\nEvery thing contains the subtle Great Ultimate,\nAbiding in sincerity and offering reverence, one grasps the mechanism.\nSoundless, scentless, traceless,\nYet embodying all things, its principle shines forth—none can defy it.\n\n**Rectifying the Mind, Sincere in Will**\nSincerity and clarity, stillness and stability—these are the roots of the Dao.\nIn movement and stillness, none differ.\nIn daily life, maintain the One in rectitude,\nAnd naturally the heavenly principle responds and communicates.\n\n**The Human Mind is Precarious**\nAlas, how the world clings in deep delusion,\nChasing sounds and sights, ever teetering on peril.\nIf one can return to principle and exhaustively examine the self,\nNature settles, the body is at peace, and the spirit rejoices.\n\n**The Dao-Mind is Subtle**\nThe Dao resides in the daily life of ordinary people,\nManifesting benevolence, concealing its function, and unleashing spiritual power.\nNeither excess nor deficiency—ever present,\nYet how the eyes of ordinary people remain blind.\n\n**Only Precision, Only Oneness**\nThe marvelous mechanism of the heavenly mind lies in its essence and function.\nAbandoning the false to follow the true, one enters the subtle.\nRefining wisdom to enter the spirit—only through steadfast oneness,\nWith deep effort and force, one reaches the state of *xi yi*.\n\n**Faithfully Holding the Mean**\nHaving attained the subtle, one devotes effort to practice,\nThe great Dao, vast and level.\nIn its wondrous applications, the center remains steadfast,\nThe perilous is stabilized, the subtle made clear.\n\n**Exhausting Principle, Fulfilling Nature**\nAbiding in sincerity is essential—first exhaust principle,\nExhausting principle lies in the spiritual power of perfect sincerity.\nWhen sincerity is perfected and principle exhausted, the great root of heaven,\nThe nature of heaven is revealed in supreme radiance.\n\n**To Extend to Destiny**\nOne who delights in heaven and knows destiny is a true noble person,\nOne who exhausts principle and probes the subtle is a great sage.\nSimply holding the mean as the great root,\nFully illuminating the great root, one communes with the spirit.\n\n**Loyalty and Forbearance Alone**\nThe heart that reproves others should first reprove the self,\nThe heart that forgives the self should first forgive others.\nOnly when loyalty and forbearance are both complete does one attain the Dao,\nPersevering to the end, beginning anew—never departing from benevolence.\n\n**Returning to See the Heavenly Mind**\nWhen the host of yin is exhausted, a single yang arises,\nFirmly seal the mysterious pass—do not open it recklessly.\nIn the stillness of utmost quiescence, observe the movement within,\nThe heavenly mind gleams pure—one awakens to the original.\n\n**Knowing All Things in Their Fullness**\nEvery thing in the world embodies the heavenly principle,\nYet few among people today truly know this.\nTracing origins, returning to endings, one preserves the Great Ultimate,\nExhausting the spirit, knowing transformation, one enters non-action.\n\n**Retreating to Conceal in the Profound**\nThe principle of the primordial *Tai Yi* is profound and obscure,\nVast and great, precise and subtle—its wonders beyond assessment.\nSavoring and exploring the mysterious, the mystery lies within the self,\nWashing the mind, retreating to conceal—utmost in sincerity.\n\n**Constant Vigilance in Solitude**\nSeen yet unseen, heard yet soundless,\nIn concealment and revelation, the subtle and profound—ever perfectly sincere.\nIts responsive spiritual mechanism is beyond human fathoming,\nYet the majestic heavenly intent shines forth clearly.\n\n**Unifying with the One**\nEach thing inherently contains a Great Ultimate,\nIts mechanism and seal govern creation, embodying heaven and earth.\nThrough adversity and success, the One pervades—fully the heavenly principle,\nEmbracing the root, returning to the origin, harmonizing with nature.\n\n**Returning to the Ultimate of Non-Ultimate**\nWithin the ultimate of non-ultimate lies the complete Great Ultimate,\nThe Great Ultimate takes form, dividing into the Two Modes.\nThe myriad things, the Three Powers—all are complete within me,\nReturning to the non-ultimate is the sage’s foundation.\n\n**Buddhist Teachings**\n**Two Bodies, One Essence**\nThe Dharma-body is pure and formless in its origin,\nHow can the phenomenal be called the Perfect Body?\nEven if a thousand or ten thousand transformation bodies arise,\nIf they cannot unite as one, they are not wholly true.\n\n**Three Minds as One**\nThe three minds are fundamentally one—originally without division,\nYet grasping and separating them is merely delusion.\nIf one can remain unstained by the present,\nThe past and future all return to emptiness.\n\n**Dissolving to Realize Emptiness**\nBoast not of learning or discussing Chan,\nSimply settle the mind and sever all entanglements.\nDiscard all acquired knowledge and understanding,\nAnd the clouds of delusion disperse—the moon’s radiance is full.\n\n**Manifesting the Subtle Without Interval**\nSeeing yet as if not seen,\nInability to contain and conceal leads back to delusion.\nHiding the body, veiling brilliance—without trace,\nOnly then is one the golden-maned lion child.\n\n**Neither Establishing Existence nor Non-Existence**\nClinging to existence or non-existence—both are hard to fathom,\nDualistic grasping leads to loss and emptiness.\nEven uniting existence and non-existence remains illusion,\nOnly by holding the mean can one merge with spiritual power.\n\n**Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom**\nIn movement, unmoving—this is true precepts,\nTrue samadhi alone unites with the ancestral lineage.\nWhen wisdom ascends and pervades the Dharma-realm,\nAll karmic illusions and delusions melt away.\n\n**No Fixed Dharma**\nSeeking Dharma through Chan, one’s nature is wholly deluded,\nDeparting from Dharma to seek the mysterious only deepens deviation.\nWhen one realizes Dharma arises from the mind,\nDharma is empty, the mind is quiescent—one sees the Tathagata.\n\n**Empty and Penetrating, Spiritually Communicating**\nAn empty mind, still and stable, communicates with the mysterious feminine,\nPoverty so pure it penetrates the bones—this is the foundation of the Dao.\nThe spirit’s realm gleams bright—the moon of the mind appears,\nThe zenith of Chan alone reveals its great radiance.\n\n**Suchness, Awakened Nature**\nThe true nature is originally perfect and complete,\nSuchness unmoving, illuminating the midst of heaven.\nIts light shines pure and unobstructed,\nPiercing the primordial chaos before the separation of *Hong Meng*.\n\n**Constant Joy, Self, Stillness**\nNurturing the spirit, cultivating the will—yearning for purity and emptiness,\nAll day carefree, at ease in expansion and contraction.\nMost blissful is the true joy within samadhi,\nThe zenith of Chan alone shines, luminous and such.\n\n**Mending the Tattered Robe in the Morning Sun**\nMending the tattered robe in the morning sun—mere pretense,\nPatching the shoulders, then the waist.\nMended only to tear again,\nHow can it compare to being utterly bare?\n\n**Finishing the Sutra by Moonlight**\nThe silver toad in the sky barely half,\nYet the deluded seek to finish the final passage.\nSuddenly, a wisp of dark cloud arrives,\nAnd their eyes remain as blind as ever.\n\n**The Diamond Sutra Pagoda**\nA seamless pagoda, clear and distinct,\nForcibly pried open by others.\nEight faces, four directions—all are eyes,\nWithin, the living Tathagata appears.\n\n**Daoist Teachings**\n**Purity and Non-Action**\n\n**Purity and Non-Action**\nClear and pure, fundamentally wordless,\nAny act of doing disrupts spontaneity.\nSilently comprehend, penetrate the mysterious pass,\nThe numinous spirit transforms, the treasure congeals firm.\n\n**The Supreme and Utmost Real**\nNon-action excels as the method for heaven and earth,\nDiscern the root in above, below, and center.\nOnly through right concentration can one grasp this essence,\nTrue Suchness emerges, blazing through the Gate of Heaven.\n\n**The Wondrous Function of True Origin**\nNeither cling to \"no-mind\" nor \"mind,\"\nHow can \"no-mind\" fathom the heart of heaven?\nMind inevitably becomes a burden,\nCast off both \"being\" and \"non-being,\" and awakened nature is pure.\n\n**Diminish and Diminish Again**\nMountain and marsh diminish through the interplay of Gen and Dui,\nAdmonishing one to curb anger and extinguish wrath and delusion.\nDiminish and diminish again, without obstruction,\nAbandon learning, embrace non-action, and enter the foundation of sagehood.\n\n**The Three Returns of Day and Night**\nThe great principle of prior heaven is hard to seek,\nYet all day long, diligently hold fast to the One True.\nThe work of the three returns is for daily use,\nThe mysterious pass is penetrated, and the yang spirit emerges.\n\n**Once Attained, Forever Attained**\nScholarly understanding and insight are but dust,\nThe voices of the Hearers and Perfect Awakening are mere grime.\nPurify the mind, refine thoughts in the purity of Chan’s heaven,\nBoth sage and commoner behold the radiance of the sun of wisdom.\n\n**Withdrawing Lead and Adding Mercury**\nWithdrawing lead is merely severing worldly ties,\nAdding mercury is the work of one’s original nature.\nWhen emotion and nature merge, the immortal Dao is complete,\nMercury and lead congeal, and the Great Elixir is perfected.\n\n**The Gate of the Mysterious Female**\nThe mysterious pass and the female portal are the Dao’s gate,\nOpen, it aligns with Qian; closed, it aligns with Kun.\nThe deluded busily point to mouth and nose,\nHow can the original mandate return to its root?\n\n**Departing the Paths of Delusion**\nCast off fame, forsake profit, delight in emptiness,\nSever all illusory conditions.\nThe waves of the sea of nature settle, the boat reaches the shore,\nA wheel of bright moonlight emerges from the clouded thoroughfare.\n\n**Entering the Gate of Profound Silence**\nThe three passes are penetrated, the true mystery is attained,\nThe true creation of non-action is fundamentally natural.\nWith each step, transcend the formless realm,\nLifting the head, the body resides in the Great Heavenly Net.\n\n**Excessive Words Lead to Exhaustion**\nA thousand scriptures, ten thousand discourses expound the ancestral teaching,\nYet how lamentable that the deluded see no common path.\nGrand debates and lofty speeches boast of sharpness,\nIn the end, all fall into stubborn emptiness.\n\n**Better to Abide in the Center**\nDiscoursing on the wondrous and discussing the profound leads nowhere,\nBetter to silently guard the center.\nNeither leaning nor deviating, the mysterious pass is penetrated,\nUnchanging, one aligns with the sage’s achievement.\n\n**The Nine-Turned Spirit Elixir**\nErect the crucible, burn dry the four great seas?\nSet the furnace, refine to dust the five Mount Sumerus.\nThe golden elixir takes form, encompassing the three realms,\nOnly then is it the time for a true man to fulfill his ambition.\n\n**The Dao That Can Be Spoken Is Not the Eternal Dao**\nThe true and constant Dao is beyond words,\nAny speech clearly betrays the宗.\nIf one grasps the meaning within the unsaid,\nNo further effort is needed to complete the work.\n\n*End of the Sixth Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Qing’an Yingchanzi*\n*(This piece also appears in the third scroll of the* Zhonghe Collection*, titled \"Questions and Answers of Zhao Ding’an.\" Differences exist. Postscript.)*\n\nI have often heard that the Most High initiated teachings to guide those yet to come, giving rise to the study of divine transcendents. Yet how could the study of divine transcendents be spoken of in ordinary terms? Only when one encounters a perfected being who illuminates the mind and transforms its nature, who comprehends the mechanism of yin-yang’s opening and closing, and who penetrates the principle of the unity of inherent nature and life-destiny—only then, standing transcendent and independent, responding to transformations without end, may one truly discourse upon the study of divine transcendents.\n\nSince the Eastern Florescence transmitted its lineage, and after the radiance of Zhong and Lü spread forth, transcendents emerged in ranks, all of them eminent scholars and towering masters. Some aided rulers in enacting the Dao above, while others bestowed blessings upon the people to relieve their suffering below. The mystic wind flourished ever more, and those who arose to study transcendence have been countless through the ages.\n\nThereafter, Yingchanzi Li Qing’an emerged, tracing the origins of the Daoist study and receiving esoteric transmission from the divine transcendents. The essence of the Three Teachings was brilliantly clear within his breast. From all directions, seekers flocked to his door, their numbers beyond reckoning, to request his further instruction. His expositions on the wonders of the golden elixir, his exchanges with disciples in answering doubts, and his swift, incisive responses—all these words were recorded and compiled into a book titled *Recorded Sayings of Qing’an*. I have recited its passages again and again: not a single superfluous word in any chapter, not a single extraneous character in any line. All reveal the enduring influence of the Most High and disclose what the earlier perfected ones had left unspoken. Truly, it may be called luminous and wondrous. Its teachings correspond inwardly and outwardly with the *Zhonghe Collection*.\n\nThe feathered scholar Deng Tanran of Jingnan had long transcribed this work. Now, he has commissioned artisans to carve and print it, ensuring the transmission of Qing’an’s virtuous voice endures, and thus demonstrating the universality of his intent. Those who study transcendence and peruse these writings will surely find themselves inspired to transcendence—how could this be but a small contribution?\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Hunranzi, a later student from the Xiū River of Nanchang.",

Though I was foolish and lowly, if anyone could speak even a word tinged with the sour scent of the Dao, I would not hold myself above them as a Confucian but would humble myself to seek their instruction. Yet I had never encountered a true master—until one day.\n\nReturning to Mount Mao, I was visited by Master Li of Qing’an Hermitage, the Luminous Toad. No sooner had he taken his seat than he uttered a few words, each one utterly free of the taint of worldly striving. Then he expounded on the *Yi* before Fu Xi drew the trigrams, pierced through the barriers that even ancestral masters had failed to fully transcend, and swept away the superficial words of the Three Teachings until all was stark and bare—opening the blind eyes of us deluded ones to a vision of perfect roundness.\n\nA pure qi enveloped us; harmonious radiance filled the room. Was it that the toad’s grotto had shifted into my own body, or had I secretly entered the grotto myself? That night, I was a thousandfold astonished and overjoyed. Collecting my thoughts, I lit incense in my heart and bowed at the foot of my bed, saying: “This is my true teacher, a true master of the Way.” If the master would not cast me aside, I would humbly receive his warnings and teachings.\n\nThereafter, I followed the master for many days, and our questions and answers were numerous. They were gathered into this volume, which I unfurl from time to time in reverence. Only when I have overturned the fortress of profound subtleties beneath Qing’an’s seat and shattered the Great Void to atoms will I be a man who has accomplished the task.\n\nAt that time, if someone were to step forward and ask Old Qing’an: “What use is this relic here?”—he would surely reply: “It is the very target I struck when I first met a master.”\n\nRespectfully inscribed on a day of heavy summer rains in the *wuzi* year of the Zhiyuan era,\nGuangchan of Moyin Hermitage, a Daoist of Mount Mao, bows his head in reverence.\n\n---\n\n**The Recorded Sayings of Master Qing’an Yingchan, Fascicle One**\nCompiled by the disciple Moyin Chai Yuangao.",

      "translated_text": "**Record of Questions and Answers**\n\nMaster Dadian’s *Commentary on the Heart Sutra* states: A monk asked Master Cen, “How does one purify the two rats gnawing at the vine?” Master Cen replied, “People of this age must conceal themselves.” Someone dared to ask, “What does ‘conceal oneself’ mean?” The Master said, “Why wait for withering and decay before knowing emptiness? One must, in this very moment, be unattached to every thing and unstained by every affair. If I do not perceive all phenomena, then all phenomena do not perceive me—this is called ‘concealing oneself.’”\n\nSomeone asked, “To speak of it is to fall short, yet in Shandong and Hebei it may still be discussed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “If this matter is to be expressed in words, words cannot exhaust it. The final phrase, vast and boundless, encompasses all—what more is there to say? Even the words ‘falling short’ have already spoken it.”\n\nSomeone asked, “Do you recognize this sutra?” The Master replied, “In the western realm of *Gugayānī* and the northern continent of *Uttarakuru*.” The questioner asked, “Why single out these two lines?” The Master said, “I would not put it that way. If someone asked me what this sutra is, I would simply say: a hundred thousand *li* east and west, eighty thousand *li* south and north.”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘The great spiritual mantra, the great luminous mantra, the unsurpassed mantra, the peerless mantra’—to what in the Three Teachings do these four lines correspond?” The Master said, “They correspond to the most wondrous of Daoist texts, the most mysterious of mysteries, the unsurpassed and unexcelled, the spontaneous and uncontrived. They also correspond to the Confucian ‘true observation, true illumination, and true victory as one.’ Yet the highest attainment lies beyond words and phrases.”\n\nSomeone asked, “When the bodhisattva *Vimalaprabhā* first left the household at the first ground, how did she escape the woman’s trance? Mañjuśrī, the teacher of seven buddhas, could not escape it—why?” The Master said, “Old *Chou’an* put it well: ‘The dog welcomes the guest who once lodged here; the crow guards the fledgling fallen from the nest.’ It is perfectly clear—do not doubt further.”\n\nThe Master asked me, “Because Mañjuśrī could not escape the woman’s trance, he summoned *Vimalaprabhā* to investigate the Dharma-gate of non-duality. Mañjuśrī said, ‘Do not move—if you move, you will receive thirty blows.’ How do you understand this?” As I was about to deliberate, Master Ding’an stirred, inadvertently triggering the mechanism, and I presented this to the Master. He approved.\n\nThe Master said, “The mud-snake at the bottom of the well dances the *Zhezhi*; the bright moon at the window illuminates the plum and pear. How do you understand this?” After a long pause, I replied, “A melody blown from the hollows shatters the empty flowers in the eye.” The Master said, “Not so.” I then said, “The skull cracks open—only I remain; the eyes bulge forth—nothing else exists.” The Master said, “Closer.”\n\nSomeone asked, “In the old case of the two monks rolling up the blind, one succeeded and one failed—what does this mean?” The Master said, “The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom.”\n\nSomeone asked, “A monk asked Mount Jia: ‘What is the Dharma-body?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-body is without form.’ The monk asked, ‘What is the Dharma-eye?’ Jia said, ‘The Dharma-eye is without flaw.’ Daowu heard this and refused the monk further audience. Later, when Boat Monk returned and raised the same exchange, Jia answered as before: ‘This time, there is a lion.’ Master, both questions and answers were the same—why was the first rejected and the latter accepted?” The Master said, “The moon in the clouds is the same, but the streams and mountains differ.”\n\nThe Master said, “Someone asked Dongshan about the precious mirror samādhi and the five positions. The secret verse says: ‘The central within the partial, the partial within the central; from the central it comes, to the partial it arrives, and in the combined it reaches.’ How does one investigate these five?” I answered, “The central must not be fixed as central, nor should the partial be seen as partial; the partial must not be fixed as central, nor should the central be displayed as central. When the central returns to the center, the partial also arrives at the center; when partial and central unite as one, all is center—then the combined is reached. At this point, partial and central are both forgotten, and only the center remains.”\n\nThe Master said, “Almost—but one must grasp the meaning within movement and stillness.”\n\nOne day, the Master sat with four others. He said, “Old Chuan said, ‘It is mind, is not mind, is not not-mind’—how would you put it?” All answers were unsatisfactory. I said, “It is mind, yet not; it is not mind, yet not.” The Master asked, “How is it so?” I gave a shout. The Master said, “Hold it well.”\n\nThe Master asked, “What is the Dao?” I struck the table. He then asked, “What is the person of the Dao?” I struck it again. The Master said, “Almost.” I shouted in response. The Master said, “Eight moments too late.”\n\nSomeone asked, “Thirty spokes share one hub—how is this to be understood?” The Master said, “Spokes and hub are merely the body of the vessel. Only when spokes converge at the hub does the cart become functional. This is like thirty days sharing one moon to fulfill the function of illumination, or the myriad dharmas returning to emptiness to fulfill the function of nature—all are the same.”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen.’ Many interpretations exist—Master, please clarify for me.” The Master said, “Those who follow life are the harmonious union of water and fire; those who follow death are the discord of water and fire. Water forms the number six, fire the number seven—six and seven together make thirteen. The ancients said: ‘Seven and six make thirteen, the spring colors of the lunar palace.’ Some say it refers to the seven emotions and six desires combined—this is somewhat plausible. Others explain it through the eight trigrams and five phases—this is incorrect. Have you not heard the lower scripture say: ‘The rigid and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life’? Rigidity and strength arise from anger and desire; softness and weakness mean curbing anger and restraining desire. When anger and desire arise, fire blazes upward and water dampens below—water and fire are in discord. When anger and desire cease, yang descends and yin ascends—water and fire are in harmony. What doubt remains?”\n\nSomeone asked, “‘Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?’—empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-producing.”",

      "translated_text": "Could the revered bellows embody the wondrous workings of heaven and earth’s creation? I humbly seek your enlightened explanation.\n\nThe Master replied: The *tuo* is a bottomless sack, and the *yue* is a three-holed flute—together, they form the bellows. This metaphor illustrates how heaven and earth, in their boundless emptiness, contain all subtle principles, just as the human mind, in its emptiness, remains luminously aware. “Inexhaustible” describes its unobstructed, flowing nature; “ever-producing” speaks to its limitless responsiveness to change.\n\nSomeone asked: What is meant by “morning *tun*, evening *meng*”?\n\nThe Master said: Qian and Kun, Kan and Li form the framework, while the sixty-four hexagrams revolve and transform within it. The cycle begins with *Tun* and *Meng* and concludes with *Ji Ji*, serving as the model for the fire-phase. The alchemical texts take Qian and Kun as the crucible, Kan and Li as the elixir ingredients, and the remaining hexagrams as the mechanisms of transformation. The sixty-four hexagrams, with their three hundred and sixty lines, correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of the year. Starting from the winter solstice, the sequence begins with *Tun* and *Meng*, and ends with *Ji Ji* on the final day of Great Snow. In terms of a single month, it begins with *Tun* and *Meng* on the first day and concludes with *Ji Ji* on the last day of the month. For a single day, it starts with *Tun* and *Meng* at the hour of *zi* and ends with *Ji Ji* at the hour of *hai*. In terms of practice, a moment’s effort seizes the seasonal rhythms of an entire year—beginning with *Tun* and *Meng* and concluding with *Ji Ji*. Thus, “morning *tun*, evening *meng*” is merely a general term. Those who grasp this principle complete the celestial cycle in an instant, with all hexagrams contained within. As the ancestral masters said: “Within the hexagram without lines, Qian and Kun are already determined.”\n\nSomeone asked: What is meant by “nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase”?\n\nThe Master replied: From the perspective of non-action, this is two separate koans. From the perspective of action, it is a single process of cultivation. Let us first address the non-action approach.

      "translated_text": "Zhaozhou said: \"No.\"\nThe monk asked: \"Why not?\"\nZhaozhou said: \"Because it is utterly devoid.\"\n\nAn ancient master also said: \"When the gosling in the vase becomes a goose, how does it emerge from the bottle?\"\nThese two koans are ones that many today cannot pass through. If someone can offer a single turning word, their study of the Dao is complete.\n\nSpeaking now from the perspective of action: the dog represents \"being within non-being,\" \"yang within yin.\" The dog that guards the minister’s tent prevents internal theft. \"Nurturing the golden goose within the precious vase\" refers to \"gold within water,\" \"elixir within the furnace.\" To nurture the golden goose is to nurture the sacred embryo. When the sacred embryo matures, it is like the gosling in the vase. That the vase breaks and the goose emerges is common worldly reasoning. That the goose emerges while the vase remains unbroken—this is the marvel of shedding the embryo. Thus, the ancestral masters said: \"Within the brocade tent, the jade dog is concealed; within the precious vase, the golden goose is nurtured.\" Is this not the wonder of the golden elixir?\n\nSomeone asked: \"Abandoning one’s wife and recklessly severing yin and yang—what does this mean?\"\nThe Master replied: Master Ziyang said: \"Without true lead, do not retreat to the mountains.\" This statement closely resembles those of today’s Dao-seekers, who, misled by false teachers, receive some method and immediately claim to have attained the Dao. They abandon their wives and children, retreat into the mountains, and when their practice yields no results, they grow remorseful—some return to secular life, others remarry. Such people are numerous. Then there are the ignorant and unlearned who, failing to grasp the sages’ principles, claim that abandoning one’s wife is not the Dao, instead pointing to women as cauldrons, or asserting that women’s bodies contain medicine, or designating the birth canal as the place of rebirth. This is a path of great disorder. The ancestral masters originally instructed the world: if one cannot extinguish desire, merely abandoning one’s wife is futile. Seeing that students misconstrued their meaning, they later added: \"Naturally, there is a cauldron to refine dragon and tiger—why cling to home, wife, and children?\" Today’s unlearned fixate on the first line, entirely neglecting the latter—truly, they are offenders.\n\nSomeone asked: \"My teacher once said that those who refine the elixir must not fixate on years, months, days, or hours. Why, then, does he also speak of gathering medicine according to dawn and dusk?\"\nThe Master replied: This aligns with the meaning of *Tun* and *Meng*, though its application differs slightly. The advent of spring and autumn marks the year’s dawn and dusk; the waxing and waning moons mark the month’s dawn and dusk; the hours of *yin* and *shen* mark the day’s dawn and dusk; the moment of yin-yang union marks the body’s dawn and dusk. Comprehending the Way of day and night, one understands the principle of yin-yang’s ebb and flow. Tracing the causes of darkness and light, one grasps the discourse on life and death. The great essentials of buddhas, immortals, and sages all lie herein.\n\nSomeone asked: \"That which cannot be seen is called *xi*; that which cannot be heard is called *yi*; that which cannot be grasped is called *wei*. Is this the same as or different from 'seeing without perceiving me, hearing without attaining, transcending all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao'?\"\nThe Master replied: They appear broadly similar, but their principles differ fundamentally. The former describes the essence; the latter, its function. *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"Be cautious of what you do not covet; be fearful of what you do not hear. Nothing is more visible than the hidden, nothing more manifest than the subtle—thus the noble person is ever vigilant in solitude.\" Only when one sees where \"I\" cannot be perceived, hears where nothing can be attained, and transcends all extremes can it be called the wondrous Dao. If one merely says that what cannot be seen is *xi*, what cannot be heard is *yi*, and what cannot be grasped is *wei*, what extremes remain to be transcended?\n\nYin Yu asked with delight: \"The year has twelve months, with the *zi* month among them; the day has twelve hours, with the *zi* hour among them. Where is the *zi* hour within the human body?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard perfect stillness—then the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return.\" Does this not describe it?\nYin said: \"When *gui* is born, if the hour stirs, it must dissolve—what does this mean?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Indeed.\"\nYin further asked: \"The Primordial One suspended a precious pearl five *zhang* above the earth. How is this to be understood?\"\nThe Master said: \"How would you explain it?\"\nYin replied: \"Five is a yang number.\"\nThe Master said: \"No. Five *zhang* above the earth signifies separation from the five defilements. Within the realm of profound emptiness, it is the concealment of spirit in the wondrous.\"\nYin said: \"Above the five defilements lies the gate of the Mysterious Female, does it not?\"\nThe Master replied: \"Though so, without genuine effort and direct realization, merely speaking of such imagery—what use is it?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs. Why use such a base analogy?\"\nThe Master replied: Heaven, earth, and the sage do not regard benevolence as benevolence, thus they view the myriad things and the common people as insignificant, likening them to things that live and die on their own. Though they live and die on their own, they ultimately return to the root and restore their mandate. *The Book of Changes* states: \"Manifesting benevolence, concealing its function, it moves the myriad things without sharing the sage’s concerns.\" This is the meaning of \"heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs.\" *Qian* bestows great benefit upon the world without declaring what it benefits—how vast! This is the meaning of \"the sage is not benevolent, treating the common people as straw dogs.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"[Laozi speaks of] the infant who has not yet learned to smile; Mencius speaks of the great person who does not lose their childlike heart. Are these the same?\"\nThe Master replied: \"They are the same. This describes the great simplicity not yet dispersed—its return is not far.\"\nSomeone asked: \"Laozi said: 'The Dao as a thing is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct yet vague, within it there is something; vague yet indistinct, within it there is an image.'\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Profound and obscure, within it there is essence; this essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity.\" Why, among these three, does he speak only of \"this essence being utterly real, within it there is sincerity\"?\n\nThe Master replied: \"The sage speaks of 'a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.' This 'born before heaven and earth' is the manifest image of the Dao. The image becomes manifest through heaven and earth; heaven and earth are formed in chaos through this thing; the thing is congealed by the wondrous union of the two and fivefold essences. Thus, the two and fivefold essences are the substance of the Dao. The image and the thing are the function of the Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The passage on being 'cautious and apprehensive where nothing is seen'—the four lines beginning with 'to see yet not perceive me'—are a most apt analogy. If one could illustrate this even more aptly with Confucian sayings, I would be grateful if you would add a word.\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The first two lines describe being in a place where no one is present, yet constantly maintaining sincerity. The latter two lines describe being face-to-face with others, yet always guarding against unforeseen intentions. Consider how 'the burden of heaven is without sound or scent'—its sincerity cannot be concealed. Is this not the subtlety of what is hidden and manifest? Though the burden of heaven has no sound or scent to be heard or known, the principles of heaven shine clearly, and its sincerity cannot be concealed.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What does it mean that 'anxiety, regret, and shame reside in the minute'?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The minute refers to 'my heart is not like stone, unturnable.' In every movement of mind and stirring of thought, first reside in the minute. With great stability in the minute, even the slightest movement will show its first signs—how could there be regret or shame? The key is to be forewarned.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Are 'three days before *jia*' and 'three days after *jia*' the same as 'three days before *geng*' and 'three days after *geng*'?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"They are not the same. *Gu* means disorder. To awaken before it arises is to prevent disorder. To awaken after it has arisen and then remedy it means disorder can still be saved. If one does not awaken, the disorder becomes severe. *Jia* means the beginning. Awakening three days prior is called 'before *jia*'; awakening three days after is called 'after *jia*.' Awakening too long after three days is not true awakening. 'Before *geng*' and 'after *geng*' refer to the *xun* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place. *Xun* is wind, the mandate of heaven. When mandates are altered, the people do not trust them—only after the *si* day do they come to believe. If three days before the change, one first announces the advantages and harms, and then implements the reform, the people will follow and trust it. Then, three days after the change, one again admonishes them, so they gladly do good. From *jia* to *wu* and *ji* is the center; *geng* passes the center. Passing the center means change, hence it is called *geng*. *Geng* means reform and renewal.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"If it cannot be spoken of as the Dao, then how is the Dao to be explained? Quickly, speak of the Dao!\"\n\nI repeated this to him, and the Master assented.\n\nThe Master said: \"What cannot be spoken of, what cannot be named—how would you explain it?\"\n\nI replied: \"I could explain it, but I fear my understanding is shallow and superficial. I would be grateful if you would speak of it.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"What emerges from spontaneity cannot be spoken of. The Dao originally has no name; this is called the unnameable name. What emerges from the Dao is the Dao that can be spoken of; only then can it be named the nameable name. What cannot be spoken of or named is the beginning of heaven and earth. What can be spoken of and named is the mother of the myriad things. To see its beginning, constantly be without desire to observe its subtlety. To see its mother, constantly be with desire to observe its manifestations. Subtle and profound, it begins in the beginningless. Manifest and bounded, it appears in what can be seen. These two emerge from the same source but have different names; together they are called the profound.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"In the past, I sat in attendance before Master Shian. The Master asked me to compose a couplet: *'The essence pass, the spirit pass, and the qi pass—three passes converge as one.'* I responded: *'Heavenly sounds, earthly sounds, and human sounds—ten thousand sounds all resound.'* The Master changed *resound* to *clarify*. What would you compose?\"\n\nI replied: *\"Gentle fire, fierce fire, and wisdom fire—all fires complete the work.\"*\n\nThe Master then said: \"I have a couplet: *'Awakening the later-awakened with prior awakening.'* What would you compose in response?\"",

The former kings, on this solstice day, closed the passes, forbade merchants and travelers from moving, and the lords did not inspect their domains.'* This refers to the ancient sage-kings who, on the Winter Solstice, closed the gates, halted all commerce and travel, and bade the people attain emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the return of the new yang. Once the new yang returns, the four seasons proceed in order, and the five grains flourish. When people, at the time of the yang’s return, maintain tranquility—keeping the inner realm from leaking outward and the outer realm from intruding inward—they await the yang’s return. Once the yang returns, the four elements are at peace, the hundred bones are in harmony—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nNow, today is the Winter Solstice with snowfall; merchants and travelers naturally cease their journeys—how could this not be an auspicious sign? Yet though all manner of auspicious signs may appear, none compare to the absence of *you*.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Now, the teeming things,\neach returns to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called the restoration of life.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"These four lines speak of observing transformation and knowing return. Consider the hexagram *Return*: from *Kun* it returns—*Kun* is stillness, yang is movement. Stillness at its extreme gives rise to movement, and the Heart of Heaven is revealed.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Restoration of life is called constancy;\nto know constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"If one comprehends these subtle workings, one directly enters the realm of true constancy—hence, it is called illumination. But if, when the yang returns, one remains ignorant and acts recklessly, one will surely lose one’s life—hence, it is called misfortune.\"\n\n\"Recite the next four lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"To know constancy is to be all-embracing;\nall-embracing is to be impartial;\nimpartial is to be kingly;\nkingly is to be heavenly.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"*All-embracing* means to broadly receive and contain. *Impartial* means to extend universally to all things. When one is utterly impartial and universal, one may become a ruler, a teacher—Heaven and humanity share the same principle.\"\n\n\"Recite the final lines.\"\nThe disciple recites:\n*\"Heavenly is the Dao;\nthe Dao is enduring.\nTo the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\"*\n\nThe Master says: \"To embody Heaven and unite with the Dao—this is the fullness of the Way of long life and enduring vision. Advancing further from here, one realizes the wondrous truth of the *non-arising dharma patience*. If one recognizes this intimately and directly assumes it, settling into the work of stillness—attaining the utmost void, holding fast to stillness—the Heart of Heaven is revealed. Once the Heart of Heaven is revealed, one radiates great luminosity in that very place, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. Within each of these worlds are three thousand great thousandfold lands; within each land, three thousand great thousandfold Dharma gates; within each gate, three thousand great thousandfold wise and virtuous beings; within each being, three thousand great thousandfold retinues; within each retinue, eyes that see the same Heart of Heaven, each radiating the same light, illuminating the three thousand great thousandfold worlds.

      "translated_text": "If one among you penetrates this, then drag Li Qing’an down from the dharma seat, beat him to death, dig a deep pit, and bury him thick with earth—let no trace remain—it would not be excessive. If you fail to penetrate it, then Li Qing’an will bury you instead. Should this still not suffice, I shall add another annotation.\n\nA verse says:\nI have a single thing—\nIt can be small, it can be vast.\nIn essence, it is one with the great void;\nIn function, it pervades the dharma realm.\nLift it, and heaven cannot contain it;\nSet it down, and earth cannot bear it.\nThose who see it startle with bulging eyes;\nThose who hear it split their skulls asunder.\nIf a Daoist grasps this, the three mountains of Peng Island tremble;\nIf a black-robed monk grasps this, the lineage of Cao Stream is held in hand.\nWith it, govern the state—state is at peace, people prosper;\nWith it, aid the Dao—times are clear, the Dao flourishes.\nWere one to speak of its value, its worth would be ten thousand taels of gold;\nYet if one meets a true connoisseur, it is sold without a single coin.\nWhy without a single coin?\nNot for profit—only for joy.\nNow I raise it before you and ask:\nDo you understand, or do you not?\n\nShi’an says: I do not.\n\nThe Master says: Never mind understanding or not—today, you buy and sell it yourself.\n\nHe molds a round image and says: Look—within the seam of these two hands, plucked forth, it is naturally fragrant.\n\n**On the Birthday of the Supreme Lord Lao, Ascending the Seat**\n\nThe Master ascends the seat and says: The Supreme is without peer, yet abides in daily use. Pity those without learning, who merely speak of emerging from the hidden pass. Now, all of you, tell me: Where does the Supreme reside?\n\nHmph! Even now, as he speaks the dharma, do any of you understand? Even if you grasp the meaning at once, you remain a thread’s breadth from Qing’an’s Way. Why? If you say *he* is the Supreme, then what are *you*? You must investigate within yourself to see it intimately.\n\nThe Supreme says:\nThe true and constant Dao—those who awaken attain it.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nAgain, he says: The reason beings do not attain the true Dao is because of deluded mind. When the deluded mind stirs, it gives rise to all manner of karmic conditions. Bound by these conditions, they lose the root of the Dao. Seeing that beings are lost in delusion, the sage establishes various expedient means to guide the world, detaching them from defilements and leading them out of deluded paths—this is why the scripture is composed. The scripture is the path that returns to the Dao.\n\nThose who read this scripture should know: this scripture is but a forced name. In truth, there is nothing to be said, and even if said, it cannot be said. It cannot be grasped, cannot be abandoned, cannot be added to, cannot be diminished, cannot be described, cannot be conveyed to others. It does not belong to discourse, to knowledge, to perception, to hearing, to being or non-being. Do not take it as the mark of reality, do not take it as true emptiness, do not take it as literary meaning, do not take it as annihilation or permanence.\n\nThen how should one who engages with the Dao proceed? Only those who grasp the great image can attain it.\n\nThe Supreme says: Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come. Coming without harm, they rest in great peace. Music and bait may halt the passing traveler, but the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor. Those who perceive the Dao through sound and form cling to impermanent dharmas, which ultimately come to an end. The Dao, when spoken, is bland and flavorless—seen, it is not enough to behold; heard, it is not enough to listen to; used, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nGreat indeed are the words of the sage! If one truly trusts this, one can leave behind all marks, end all dharmas, and directly merge them into a single whole—utterly bare, utterly empty—concealing the great sound in silence, hiding the great image in formlessness. Then, naturally, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one unites with the Dao in truth.\n\nYet how is it that today’s scholars do not seek the master’s intent, but privately speculate, some clinging to literary meaning, others fixating on words? The sage’s purpose in composing the scripture is thus obscured. The unannotated passages in this scripture often differ—this is the reason. Little do they know that the moment one opens one’s foul mouth, ten thousand eight thousand errors arise. The moment one says “the Dao that can be spoken,” it is not the constant Dao. The moment one says “the name that can be named,” it is not the constant name.\n\nThen is the constant Dao unspeakable? Are the five thousand words not the Dao? Is the constant name unnameable? Is the *Daodejing* not a name?\n\nHmph! The Dao that cannot be spoken—*that* is the Dao. The name that cannot be named—*that* is the name. If you have the eye to see this, your study of the Dao is complete. If not, you merely follow others’ footsteps: the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom, the common people use it daily yet do not know it. Thus, few understand the sage’s Dao.\n\nQing’an spares not his two lips to reveal this to you all. This scroll of scripture is but soiled paper, unfit for wiping. Since it is soiled paper, the five thousand words cannot elucidate the meaning of the unspeakable Dao. It is like a great physician treating illness—prescribing medicine according to the ailment. Once the illness is cured, the medicine is no longer needed. Once the constant Dao is attained, the five thousand words are also useless.\n\nThose who see it thus know: the speakable and nameable are the fringes of the Dao; the unspeakable and unnameable are the Dao’s profound mystery. The named fringe is the Dao’s function; the nameless mystery is the Dao’s essence. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the ten thousand things. These two emerge together yet bear different names—together they are called the profound. Profound beyond profound—they are the gate of all wonders.\n\nIf one can proceed from the named fringe to the nameless mystery, the true and constant Dao is attained. Who but the most utterly empty under heaven could achieve this?\n\nAll of you—Qing’an has spoken at length thus far. Is this speaking, or is it not speaking?",

      "translated_text": "All of you who have heard the scripture thus far—is this hearing, or is it not hearing? Those of keen wisdom and insight, if there are those who hear what is not heard, only then do they meet Qing’an’s \"speaking of no-speaking.\" In this way, the Sage’s intent in composing the scripture becomes clear. The opening phrase—it is perfect, complete; cease all doubt.\n\nSomeone asks: If the Dao cannot be spoken, and names cannot be named, then why today’s grand ritual—is this not superfluous? The master replies: Not so. The Supreme’s descent on the fifteenth day of the second month is not real—it reveals the meaning of ceaseless generation. Today, celebrating the Supreme’s birth is precisely to illuminate that opening phrase. What superfluity is there? What doubt remains?\n\nAll of you—the opening phrase has already spoken itself. What then of the closing phrase? Hmph! The mouth given by father and mother will never serve me.\n\nThe master descends from the seat and dismisses the assembly.\n\nThe master says: \"Seen yet unseen—called *xī*; heard yet unheard—called *yí*; grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*. These three cannot be interrogated.\" I say: Seen yet unseen—called *xī*—is this not formless? Heard yet unheard—called *yí*—is this not soundless? Grasped yet unobtainable—called *wēi*—is this not shapeless?\n\nHe raises his whisk and asks: Do you see? He taps it once and asks: Do you hear? If you take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is not yet sharp. If you do not take this as seeing and hearing, your eye of study is still not sharp. How do all of you understand this?\n\nHey An steps forward and says:\nSeeing form is not form,\nHearing sound is not sound.\nWhere the colored body is unobstructed,\nOne arrives at the city of the Dharma King.\n\nThe master says: Leave behind words.\nHey An clenches his fist and says: Look.\nHe strikes once and says: Listen.\nDoes this still belong to seeing and hearing?\n\nThe master says: Striking emptiness to make a sound.\nHey An asks: Is there more?\nThe master replies: When you hide the great elephant in formlessness, and conceal the great sound in soundlessness, then come to meet me.\n\nHey An says: Yes. He bows in gratitude and retreats.\n\nThe master raises his staff and says:\nThe mud ox pants at the moon,\nThe wooden horse neighs in the wind—\nGazing, it seems to exist, yet no trace is found.\nQing’an’s staff draws the inverted Wondrous Peak.\n\nHe continues: To open the mouth is already a mistake—how laborious to raise such things! Hmph! If you seek the August Emperor’s intent beneath the staff, you have not even dreamed of it. Why? The good walker leaves no tracks; the good speaker leaves no flaws; the good reckoner needs no counting rods; the good closer needs no bolts yet cannot be opened; the good binder needs no cords yet cannot be untied.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe step does not depend on the foot,\nGrasping things does not depend on the hand.\nTouch the tip of the nose—\nThe whole body is a mouth.\n\nIf you can thoroughly investigate this,\nThe forty-nine days were originally seven sevens.\nIf you understand it here,\nYou will know the Supreme spoke the scripture without ever opening his mouth,\nAnd Qing’an raised his staff without ever moving his hand.\nIf you have not yet done so,\nThen work within sound and form—\nIs there anyone who understands?\nYou may not open your mouth,\nYou may not move your hand.\nLeave behind sound and form—\nCome forward and meet me.\n\nIf you speak, you receive the staff.\nIf you do not speak, you still receive the staff.\n\nHuang the Layman steps forward, about to open the register, when the attendant says: You may not open your mouth. After a long silence, he stamps his foot once.\nThe master says: There is more.",

These two emerge together yet bear different names—together they are called the profound. Profound beyond profound—they are the gate of all wonders.\n\nIf one can proceed from the named fringe to the nameless mystery, the true and constant Dao is attained. Who but the most utterly empty under heaven could achieve this?\n\nAll of you—Qing’an has spoken at length thus far. Is this speaking, or is it not speaking?",

      "translated_text": "The disciple Sun’an Cai Zhi recorded this:\n\n**Yellow Center Resolves Doubts #1**\n\nThe Master said: *The ancestral masters, perfected beings, and highest sages of former ages possessed the Supreme Correct and True Dao, which they transmitted to the world to deliver people. Do you truly understand this?*\n\nDing’an replied: *This disciple has only just entered the Mystery Gate—utterly foolish and dull. Yet by your grace, Master, I have been accepted, a fortune of a thousand lifetimes. The Supreme Correct and True Dao I do not yet know; I humbly beseech your instruction.*\n\nThe Master said: *The Supreme Correct and True Dao is that which admits no higher, the most profound of the profound, beyond all form or image, spontaneously so—utterly perfect and wondrous. The sages were compelled to name it the Dao. Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this, and none have achieved cultivation without it. The oral transmission of the sacred masters, the heart-to-heart transmission of successive generations—the essential teaching of the Golden Elixir—is precisely the wondrous Dao of the Supreme Correct and True.*\n\nDing’an said: *The Supreme Correct and True’s wondrousness is likened to the Golden Elixir. What is its principle?*\n\nThe Master said: *The character \"gold\" (金) signifies firmness; \"elixir\" (丹), roundness. The Buddhists compare it to Perfect Enlightenment; the Confucians, to the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is no other thing—it is simply the original, singular numen. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, firm as gold, round as cinnabar, growing ever brighter with refinement. The Buddhists say: \"○ This is True Suchness.\" The Confucians say: \"○ This is the Supreme Ultimate.\" Our Dao says: \"○ This is the Golden Elixir.\" The substance is the same; only the names differ.*\n\n*The Book of Changes states: \"In Change there is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Supreme Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang—Heaven and Earth. Humanity is born between Heaven and Earth; this is called the Dao of Jiang Cai, and it is fully contained within the single body. The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the Elixir Dao, the Supreme Ultimate is the mother of the Elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury.*\n\n*What is called lead and mercury is not quicksilver, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, or herbs and trees; nor is it the essences, fluids, snivel, spittle, heart-kidney qi, or blood. Rather, it is the primordial essence within the body and the primordial spirit within the heart. When body and mind are unmoving, essence and qi congeal and coalesce—this is likened to the Elixir. What is called the Elixir is the Elixir Body. ○ This is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the Elixir is called Elixir Accomplishment. The so-called Elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source, the attainment of the Correct and True.*\n\n*Few in the world understand this. Today’s cultivators of the Dao mostly lack correct transmission; they all seek outwardly, following the deviant and turning from the correct. Thus, though many study, few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three refuges and five counterfeits; some refine the qi beyond the clouds and mist; some refine the essence and brilliance of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine pellets forming in empty space to become the Elixir. Some imagine objects in the cinnabar field to be the Elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the brows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to return it to the navel. Then there are those who swallow saliva and ingest fluids, inhale the new and exhale the old, practice the Eight Brocades, the Three-Character Method, shake the spine, turn the windlass, close the Tail Gate, guard the navel’s stem, gather heavenly water, calcine autumn stone, bend and stretch in daoyin, massage and regulate, silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, press the tongue to the upper palate, return the three fields, close and conduct qi, amass great fire in the bladder, or drill the five phases into the bitter sea. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent effort and gathering, they ultimately cannot accomplish the great work.*\n\n*The scriptures say: \"The correct Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true path often leads into deviant sects.\" This is what they mean. The essentials of the utmost truth are utterly simple and easy—difficult to encounter, yet easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected being who points the way, none fail to succeed.*\n\nDing’an said: *This disciple, by past karmic affinity, has been fortunate to meet you, Master, and receive the Dharma-milk. I humbly beseech your illumination of the essentials of the Golden Elixir.*\n\nThe Master said: *Listen carefully now, and I shall expound. The practice of the Elixir lies entirely in seizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, the sun and moon as water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the crow and hare as the medicinal substances. Rely on the celestial pivot’s revolutions, depend on the Dipper’s handle to advance and retreat. Gather qi at the proper time, move the tally according to principle. Advance the fire and retreat the tally, harmonize the Four Images. Pursue the two qi to return them to the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace. Return to the root and revert to the origin, restore the mandate. When merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its shell to become an immortal—this is called Elixir Accomplishment.*\n\nDing’an said: *The transformations of Heaven and Earth seem difficult to seize.*\n\nThe Master said: *It is entirely within the single body—what difficulty is there? Heaven and Earth are the physical form; water and fire are essence and qi; yin and yang are body and mind; the crow and hare are nature and emotion. Thus, the physical form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotion and nature as the mechanism of transformation, body and mind as the medicinal materials. The sages, fearing that students would have no standard to follow, used Heaven and Earth as metaphors. The human body and the transformations of Heaven and Earth are no different. The two words \"body\" and \"mind\" are the medicine, are the fire.*\n\n*Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, yang lead and yin mercury, Kan man and Li woman, sun crow and moon hare—none lie outside the two words \"body\" and \"mind.\" The celestial pivot’s revolutions are the celestial mind. The Elixir scriptures say: \"If the human mind unites with the celestial mind, the inversion of yin and yang ceases in an instant.\" They also say: \"Observe the Dao through the mind, and the Dao is the mind; observe the mind through the Dao, and the mind is the Dao.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Dipper’s handle in its revolutions—this is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet many of today’s students cling to physical forms, some claiming it lies between the brows, others at the navel wheel, or between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or in the bladder, or in the Cinnabar Field, or in the nine palaces of the head as the Mysterious Pass, or pointing to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or to the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all these are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one must not seek it outside this body either. The various Elixir scriptures do not specify its location, precisely because it defies description in words or brush. Hence the term \"Mysterious Pass.\" The sages merely inscribed a single character: *zhong* (\"center\"). Through this *zhong*, the Mysterious Pass becomes clear.\n\nThis *zhong* is not the center between inner and outer, nor the center among the four directions or above and below, nor the center within a center. The Buddhists say: \"Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a moment, what is your original face?\" This is the *zhong* of Chan. The Confucians say: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused—this is called *zhong*.\" The Daoists say: \"Where thoughts do not stir—this is called *zhong*.\" Thus, the Three Teachings employ but a single *zhong*.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Still and unmoving—this is the essence of *zhong*; responsive and penetrating—this is the function of *zhong*.\" Laozi says: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\" Now, in the *Fu* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yin. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. At this very point of movement lies the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort in the moments of thought and action throughout the twelve double-hours. Over time, the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once seen, the medicinal substances, fire phases, withdrawal and addition, and even the transformation of the embryo and spiritual transcendence—none lie beyond this single aperture.\n\nTo \"gather the medicine\" is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time. This time is not the winter solstice, nor the waxing moon, nor the midnight hour. The master says: \"In refining the Elixir, there is no need to seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang naturally arises.\" He also says: \"When lead reaches *gui*-birth, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Thus, seek the moment of *gui*-birth within the body—this is the arising of one yang, the time to begin gathering.\n\nAfter the union of the two qi, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and avoid excess. \"When gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Advancing the fire and withdrawing the tally lack clear standards, so the yearly cycle of seasons—cold and heat coming and going—serves as the model for the fire tally. The waxing and waning of the moon also illustrate the principles of withdrawal and addition. For example: at the winter solstice, yang is born—the *Fu* hexagram, twelfth month; two yangs—the *Lin* hexagram, first month; three yangs—the *Tai* hexagram, second month; four yangs—the *Dazhuang* hexagram, third month; five yangs—the *Guai* hexagram, fourth month; six yangs—the pure yang *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born, fifth month; one yin—the *Gou* hexagram, sixth month; two yins—the *Dun* hexagram, seventh month; three yins—the *Pi* hexagram, eighth month; four yins—the *Guan* hexagram, ninth month; five yins—the *Bo* hexagram, tenth month; pure yin—the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, returning to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and withdrawing the fire tally.\n\nAlas, students cling to texts and adhere to images, beginning the fire advance at the winter solstice, withdrawing the tally at the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months, unaware of the essentials. Seeing students misdirect their efforts, the sages compressed the yearly cycle into a single month, using the new and full moons to represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters to represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days to represent a month, and thirty days to represent a year. Yet students then fixated on the moon for their practice. The sages further compressed the moon’s waxing and waning into a single day, using midnight and noon to represent the new and full moons, and dawn and dusk to represent the two quarters. Students then fixated on a single day for their practice.\n\nMasters of recent times have said: \"Within a single moment of effort lies a year’s cycle of seasons.\" They also said: \"Before father and mother were born, where were the years, months, days, and hours?\" This is how the sages guided students to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Alas, those who cling to forms do not fathom the principle, adhering to texts and images, vainly exhausting their minds.\n\nI now directly point this out to you: the moment of *gui*-birth within the body is the arising of one yang. When yang ascends and yin descends, this is three yangs. When yin and yang separate, this is four yangs—corresponding to the second month, like the waxing moon, akin to the *mao* hour, the time for bathing, then advancing the fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, this is six yangs. After yin and yang unite and spirit and qi blend, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing when to stop, all previous efforts are wasted. Hence it is said: \"When elixir gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Then withdraw the tally, corresponding to one yin, and when yin and yang separate, this is three yins—yin and yang in their hidden positions, the time for bathing, corresponding to the eighth month, like the waning moon, akin to the *you* hour. Then proceed to six yins, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—in an instant, a single celestial revolution is complete.\n\nSimply follow this practice. Over time, effort will gradually congeal and solidify, transforming the formless into form, coalescing into the sacred embryo, called the completion of the Elixir.\n\nDing’an said: \"The initial effort and the application of the celestial revolution’s fire phases have been revealed by the master, yet the various alternate names remain unclear. I hope the master will clarify.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Alternate names are merely metaphors, all contained within the two words 'body' and 'mind.' At the outset of practice, concentrate the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s qi, and regulate the nose’s breath—let the four great elements remain unmoving.\"",
      "overlap_context": "al hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, yang lead and yin mercury, Kan man and Li woman, sun crow and moon hare—none lie outside the two words \"body\" and \"mind.\" The celestial pivot’s revolutions are the celestial mind. The Elixir scriptures say: \"If the human mind unites with the celestial mind, the inversion of yin and yang ceases in an instant.\" They also say: \"Observe the Dao through the mind, and the Dao is the mind; observe the mind through the Dao, and the mind is the Dao.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Let the essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle into their proper places—this is called the \"Five Qi Assembling at the Origin.\" Drawing them into the Central Palace is called \"Gathering the Five Phases.\" When the heart remains unmoving, the dragon intones; when the body remains unmoving, the tiger roars. When both body and heart remain unmoving, this is called \"Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger.\" The essence and qi are metaphorically likened to the tortoise and serpent, while the body and heart are likened to the dragon and tiger. When dragon, tiger, tortoise, and serpent merge into one, this is called \"Harmonizing the Four Symbols.\" Using nature to govern emotion is called \"Metal and Wood in Union.\" Using essence to guide qi is called \"Water and Fire in Intercourse.\" Wood and fire share the same source, the two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share the same source—north’s one and west’s four are held in common. Earth resides in the Central Palace, belonging to the self; the five numbers of wu and ji return to their original generative count. When heart, body, and intent merge into one, the three families meet and form the sacred embryo—this is collectively called the \"Three and Five in Fusion.\"\n\nRefining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—this is called the \"Three Flowers Gathering in the Tripod,\" also known as the \"Three Passes.\" Today’s scholars often designate the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow as the Three Passes, but these are merely methods of practice, not the essential points. Wherever the heart stirs with thought is the Mysterious Female; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, heart, and intent are the Three Essentials. The nature within the heart is called \"mercury within cinnabar,\" while the qi within the body is called \"metal within water.\" Metal is born of water, the mother of water; when metal returns to dwell within water, it is called \"the mother concealed in the child’s womb.\" Let no external realm enter, nor any internal realm depart—this is called \"Sealing and Preserving.\" Stillness without motion is called \"Nurturing the Fire.\" Emptiness and spontaneity are called \"Application.\" Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called \"Guarding the City.\" Subduing the inner realm is called \"Field Warfare.\" True mercury is called the \"Radiant Maiden,\" true lead is called the \"Infant.\" The embryonic intent is called the \"Yellow Dame.\" Nature and emotion are called husband and wife. Clarifying the heart and stabilizing intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances coalesce, the three origins converge—this is called \"Forming the Embryo.\" Cherishing the numinous root is called \"Warm Nurturing.\" Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—this is called \"Protecting and Sustaining.\" Let no deviation occur, for even a hair’s breadth of error will render all prior effort void.\n\nWhen the yang spirit manifests, this is called \"Shedding the Embryo.\" Returning to the root and restoring life, reverting to one’s original state—this is called \"Transcendence.\" Shattering emptiness is called \"Completion.\" Ding’an asked: \"When the Golden Elixir is complete, can it still be seen?\" The master answered: \"It can.\" He asked again: \"Does it have form?\" The master answered: \"It has no form.\" He asked again: \"If it has no form, how can it be seen?\" The master answered: \"The Golden Elixir is merely a forced name—how could it have form? That it can be seen does not mean it can be seen with the eyes. As the Buddhists say: 'Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see.' The Daoist scriptures say: 'Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao.' Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen. Listened for but not heard, yet never not heard. What is called visible and audible is not within the reach of ears and eyes, but is seen by the heart and heard by intent. It is like a great wind rising: entering the mountains, it shakes the trees; entering the water, it stirs the waves—how can one say it does not exist? Observed, it cannot be seen; grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The substance of the Golden Elixir is likewise. Thus, in the beginning of refinement, being and non-being are mutually employed, movement and stillness follow one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas are empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both relinquished—only then is the Mystic Pearl formed, the Great One returned to truth.\n\nWhen nature and life are both preserved, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—this is the fruition of the Golden Immortal. Thus, the scriptures and alchemical texts employ various alternate names to guide learners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the sublime, until they perceive nature and awaken to emptiness. Yet the true matter does not lie on paper. It is like a boat for crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed. As the ancients said: 'Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap.' This is what is meant. Moreover, this collection of mine must not be rigidly held to the page. One should only chew it thoroughly, savor its flavor, and delve into its source. Perhaps at a single word, the heart’s ground may open, and one may directly enter the realm of non-action—this is not difficult. There are further subtleties beyond, not easily spoken of lightly. One must seek them beyond the words, depending on how far your practice has progressed. There will be heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction. For now, devote yourself earnestly to the practice. The profound precepts issue a solemn warning, thus I offer this verse:\n\n*I grant you a scroll of the Golden Elixir—*\n*Devote yourself earnestly to seek within.*\n*If you can fathom the meaning in these words,*\n*The wondrous function will pervade the Great Void.\"*\n\n**A Guide to Refining Nature**\n\nThe study of nature and principle has no fixed sequence. Some say one must exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and arrive at life—this follows an order. Others say the three are accomplished simultaneously. Today’s scholars do not know which is correct. Let me explain clearly. Those of middling and lesser capacity must proceed gradually: first exhaust the principles of things, and only when fully exhausted can nature be fulfilled. If even one thing remains unexhausted, there will be an obstruction. One must first exhaust everything thoroughly to perceive one’s own nature, and only then proceed to life. Those of superior wisdom are not so. By exhausting a single principle, all principles become clear; fulfilling nature and arriving at life are accomplished all at once. It is like the Buddhist precepts, concentration, and wisdom—all are one.\n\nFor those of the lowest capacity, forgetting emotion and cutting off thought is called \"precepts\"; stillness without motion is called \"concentration\"; silent recognition and subtle penetration are called \"wisdom.\" Those of superior capacity are not so.",

The sudden teaching is not so. Here, essence, qi, and spirit are called the primordial medicinal substances, and the work is completed all at once.\n\nIn seeking thus, what sequence is there in the study of nature and principle? If one is a man of resolve, all three matters are accomplished at once. And what does it mean for all three to be accomplished at once? Hmph—like a tangled skein of silk in a pot, one slash severs it all.\n\n*The Shortcut to Immortality*\nMaster Yian of Yian Hermitage was a worthy magistrate of Xinghua. His benevolence extended to all things, and though he lived amidst the red dust of the world, his heart dwelled in the mysterious realm—truly a man who dwelt in the world yet transcended it. One day, he visited me in my Toad Hollow and sought instruction. When I briefly outlined the work, his questions and responses were uncommon, leaving me no choice but to speak. Thus, I composed these nine foundational matters and presented them to him, aligning with the principle of the Nine Returns. Within, the transformations of the Golden Elixir are elucidated, with references to the profound tenets of the Chan school. Study this text, savor its meaning, and seek its essence deeply—naturally, the distinction between self and other will vanish, and no view of difference will remain. As for the essentials of ascending to truth and treading the realm of the immortals, nothing surpasses this, hence the title *The Shortcut to Immortality*.\n\nWritten by Li Chunsu, the Luminous Toad of Clear Hermitage in Duliang.\n\n1. **Commencing at the Right Time**\nTo refine the Golden Elixir, one must first understand where to begin. Without knowing the initial work, all manner of contrivances and fabrications are futile. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting a true teacher, do not force guesses.\" One must have a true teacher point out where to place the hands and feet. Even knowing where to begin, one must also know the timing. This \"time\" refers to the moment of the first yang. Most people mistakenly identify the hour of *zi* as the time of the first yang—this is incorrect. To fixate on the hour is wrong, yet to say there is no time is also wrong. Have you not heard Lü the Perfected say: \"Refine the self and await the time\"? And have you not heard the Perfected One of Purple Yang say: \"When lead sees *gui* arise, swiftly gather it—scripture says the time arrives and the spirit knows\"? Pondering this, you will understand: when *gui* arises within the body, that is the time of the first yang. And what is the time when *gui* arises? Hmph—walking to the end of the water, sitting to watch the clouds rise.\n\n2. **True Lead and True Mercury**\nOnce the timing for commencing is known, one must recognize true lead and true mercury. Lead and mercury are not common lead, black tin, cinnabar, or quicksilver—they are the two original substances within one’s own body. Forcibly named as medicinal substances, their wondrous resonance and union are metaphorically called lead and mercury. Lead’s nature tends to fly, mercury’s to flee. When lead sees mercury, it does not fly; when mercury sees lead, it does not flee. The medicinal substances within the body are likewise. Do you wish to see the medicine? Hmph—clouds rising over the southern and northern mountains.\n\n3. **Gathering the Medicine into the Crucible**\nRecognizing it is not remarkable; knowing how to gather it is the marvel. To gather the medicinal substances, one does not depart from movement and stillness. Gathered from within movement and stillness, they are sent into the crucible of effortless transformation, refined with the true fire of samadhi into purple powder, coagulated into the mysterious pearl. Consuming it, one may attain longevity and enduring vision. How to understand the phrase \"coagulating the mysterious pearl\"? Hmph—grasping ten thousand acres of clouds from the green mountain, scooping the reflection of the moon from the azure pool.\n\n4. **Drawing Lead and Adding Mercury**\nHaving mastered the refinement of the medicine, one must understand drawing and adding. Drawing and adding mean removing excess to supplement deficiency. All beings in the world—celestial, human, asura, and non-human—have emotions in excess and nature deficient; thoughts in excess and mind deficient; essence in excess and qi deficient. Forgetting essence to nurture nature, gathering thoughts to return to mind, refining essence into qi and beyond—this is called drawing and adding. Yet even if one draws excess and supplements deficiency, it is not extraordinary. There is still a higher matter: one must reach the point of neither drawing nor adding. What is neither drawing nor adding? Hmph—neither surplus nor lack, just right when taken by hand.\n\n5. **The Fire-Timing of the Microcosmic Orbit**\nWhen one reaches the point of neither drawing nor adding, it is precisely the time to apply the fire-timing. It is also said: \"True fire has no timing.\" And: \"Do not impose timing upon the fire.\" Hmph—these two phrases have blinded the eyes of many and opened the eyes of many. I now directly point it out to you. Fire is the heart; timing is thought. Refining thought with the heart is called fire-timing. When the heart is settled and thought ceases, the fire-timing is applied. Though it is said thus, one must not cling to heart and thought, nor depart from them. Departing from heart and thought is delusion; clinging to them is attachment. Neither within nor apart from heart and thought—how then? Hmph—cold comes and heat goes, autumn harvests and winter stores.\n\n6. **Maintaining Fullness and Securing Achievement**\nDuring the practice, one must recognize how to maintain fullness. Without knowing how to maintain fullness, all prior efforts are wasted. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"If one’s heart is not yet content with maintaining fullness, one may one day suffer disgrace.\" The Supreme Lord said: \"Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\" This is the meaning. And what is maintaining fullness? Hmph—full yet not overflowing, thus one long retains abundance.\n\n7. **Securing the Crucible and Furnace**\nHaving understood maintaining fullness, one must further secure the achievement. Securing means sealing the earthen cauldron tightly.",

Thus, when the fire-tending is complete and the cycles of the celestial revolution are fulfilled, one abides in silent radiance, the true breath flowing ceaselessly.

Hmph—this night a full measure is poured: where is there no clear light?\n\n8. **Nurturing and Cultivating**\nOnce the golden elixir takes form, further nurturing and cultivation are required. What is nurturing and cultivating? It is like a woman carrying a child. Throughout the twelve hours, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, one must proceed with utmost care—like an ox nurturing its yellow essence, like a dragon guarding its pearl—constantly preserving it within, never allowing interruption, until the moment of parturition, when one’s feet stand firmly upon solid ground. Do you understand parturition? Hmph—when the melon is ripe, the stem falls away.\n\n9. **Regulating the Spirit and Emerging from the Shell**\nAfter parturition, one regulates the spirit in its comings and goings, proceeding with even greater care, like a mother cherishing her infant. In daily life and diet, one must always hold it close; when it begins to move, one must watch over it. If not watched over, it may fall into pits and ravines. Only when the work is established may one depart from the mother. The work of regulating the spirit is just the same.

restraint, roaming beyond the material world, and merging with the Great Void as one body.\n\nHow to overturn the crucible and furnace?\nWith a single phrase—*home shattered, people lost* (☯十力)—the empty sky shatters into fragments, revealing the solitary cinnabar toad.\n\n**Water Tune Prelude: Revealing the Nature’s Principle**\nThe supreme Dao speaks no words,\nIts divine workings beyond all measure.\nOriginally complete, nothing to add,\nNothing to subtract—no gain, no loss.\nNot in wide learning or broad study,\nBut in silent communion and deep reflection,\nWithin stillness, ponder carefully.\nThe true intent within—\nNever departs from the Central Yellow.\n\nRound and full,\nRadiant and bright,\nManifesting in majesty.\nWithout excess or lack,\nThe entire being, formless, aligns with true constancy.\nSimply recognize this now in silence—\nIt is Maitreya of the future,\nTo be embraced directly.\nOpening the eye atop the crown,\nNothing in all realms can conceal it.\n\n**The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir**\nThe Great Dao is wordless,\nYet without words, its Dao cannot be revealed.\nThe Golden Elixir is formless,\nYet without form, how can its elixir be seen?\nThus, the sages modeled heaven and earth,\nTransforming people through the Dao,\nEstablishing myriad names,\nSetting forth countless forms,\nComposing scriptures and classics on the elixir,\nTo guide and enlighten all beings.\nAlas, today’s scholars cling to forms and texts,\nGenerating interpretations,\nSpawning heterodoxies,\nSplitting the Three Teachings into divergent paths,\nUnable to unite as one—\nAll because they know not the source.\nNow, I set forth the secret essentials of the Golden Elixir’s transformations,\nComposing thirty-five verses.\nClarifying the supreme principle,\nDirectly pointing to its various names,\nI title this *The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir*,\nOffering it to the Retired Hermit of the Thatched Hut,\nThat he may easily comprehend.\nIf one grasps the meaning through these words,\nOne naturally embraces the root and returns to emptiness,\nDirectly entering the wondrous realm of the Inaudible and Invisible.\n\n**Nature and Life**\nThe primordial true suchness is called *nature*,\nThe primordial unity of qi is called *life*.\nNature is originally vast in spiritual power,\nYet bound by the body, it loses its efficacy.\nNow, if one fully lets go,\nIt once more radiates luminous clarity.\n\n**Substance and Function**\nModeling heaven and earth is called *substance*,\nEmbracing yin while holding yang is called *function*.\nHeaven and earth establish the foundation,\nYin and yang drive the mechanism of transformation.\nThese pivotal principles—\nFew truly understand.\n\n**Dragon and Tiger**\nThe primordial qi within the heart is called the *dragon*,\nThe primordial essence within the body is called the *tiger*.\nWhen nature is settled, the dragon returns to water,\nWhen emotions are forgotten, the tiger withdraws to the mountain.\nWhen nature and emotion harmonize,\nOne’s name is enrolled among the immortals.\n\n**Lead and Mercury**\nThe numinous spring of the Great One is called *lead*,\nThe fiery palace of Vermilion Mound is called *mercury*.\nTo refine the mercury of Southern Mountain,\nFirst draw forth the lead of Northern Sea.\nWith body at ease and mind unmoved,\nThe supreme treasure solidifies.\n\n**Crucible and Furnace**\nThe true metal of Qian Palace is called the *crucible*,\nThe true earth of Kun Palace is called the *furnace*.\nThe crucible is forged of Qian’s metal,\nThe furnace must be enveloped in Kun’s earth.\nOnce body and mind are upright,\nThe crucible and furnace stand firm.\n\n**Elixir Kiln**\nThe singular true nature is called the *elixir*,\nThe four great illusory aggregates are called the *kiln*.\nThe illusory body serves as the elixir kiln,\nTrue suchness is the medicinal material.\nWith unceasing effort,\nThe spiritual embryo forms within.\n\n**Being and Nonbeing**\nChasing wind and clutching shadows is called *being*,\nScooping water to toy with the moon is called *nonbeing*.\nOnly when one grasps the departure from Kan and Li,\nDoes one know that being is nonbeing.\nWhen being and nonbeing merge as one,\nThey are refined into a luminous pearl.\n\n**Medicine and Fire**\nDrawing in emotions with qi is called *medicine*,\nRefining thoughts with the mind is called *fire*.\nGathering the medicine is fundamentally easy,\nThe firing process is likewise not difficult.\nWith not a single matter in the heart,\nTrue fire penetrates the Three Passes.\n\n**Mysterious Female**\nThe valley of emptiness is called the *mysterious*,\nThe aperture of returning to the root is called the *female*.\nWhen qi returns to the root within the empty valley,\nThis is the gate of heaven and earth.\nOnce the opening and closing are mastered,\nThe golden crucible remains warm as broth.\n\n**Centrality and Uprightness**\nStillness without movement is called *centrality*,\nResponsiveness without obstruction is called *uprightness*.\nOnly when the heart is tranquil is it upright,\nOnly when the spirit is clear is it central.\nAbiding in profound stillness,\nHeavenly principle responds and flows.\n\n**Numinous Treasure**\nThe hundred spirits undispersed are called *numinous*,\nThe myriad qi perpetually present are called *treasure*.\nThe treasure within one’s own body,\nManifests efficacy in all actions.\nIf one can truly contain and nurture it,\nIt radiates great luminosity.\n\n**Purity and Stillness**\nThe cessation of waves in the numinous source is called *purity*,\nThe absence of dust in the field of nature is called *stillness*.\nThe spirit-water is originally pure,\nYet following the current, it becomes turbid.\nNow, if one remains unmoving,\nThe sun of wisdom naturally rises from east to west.\n\n**Withdrawing and Adding**\nForgetting emotions and severing thoughts is called *withdrawing*,\nRefining emotions and nurturing nature is called *adding*.\nNurturing nature is adding mercury,\nForgetting emotions is reducing lead.\nOnce form and spirit attain perfection,\nThere is neither gain nor loss.\n\n**Bathing**\nPolishing the ground of the heart is called *bathing*,\nWashing away toil and dust is called *washing*.\nTo subdue the wild ape,\nFirst capture the unruly horse.\nNot a speck of dust clings—\nSpirit and qi unite with the heart.\n\n**Return and Union**\nYin at its extreme gives rise to yang—this is *return*,\nYang at its extreme gives rise to yin—this is *union*.\nWhen yin reaches its limit, yang returns,\nWhen yang arises, union follows.\nIf the adept understands this principle,\nThey surely perceive the heart of heaven.\n\n**Intercourse and Union**\nThe blending of two things is called *intercourse*,\nThe convergence of the three primals is called *union*.\nThe maiden resides in the eastern chamber,\nThe metal lord dwells in the west.\nThe Yellow Dame brings them together,\nMatched as husband and wife.\n\n**Warm Nurturing**\nGentle, ceaseless true breathing is called *warmth*,\nContaining light in silent stillness is called *nurturing*.\nOnce the infant within the womb is formed,\nApply the work of warm nurturing.\nTend to it constantly,\nAnd upon shedding the shell, spiritual powers manifest.\n\n**Return and Restoration**\nQi uniting with spirit is called *return*,\nEmotions returning to nature is called *restoration*.\nTo restore gold to nature,\nFirst teach fire to return to the heart.\nWhen the two become one,\nAll the earth turns to gold.\n\n**Gathering and Release**\nEntering the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible is called *gathering*,\nExiting the paths of delusion is called *release*.\nThe eternal numinous youth,\nWhose spiritual powers are beyond measure.\nWhen released, he pervades the Dharma realm,\nWhen gathered, he conceals himself like a millet pearl.\n\n**Emptiness and Perfection**\nThe absence of being and nonbeing is called *emptiness*,\nThe hollowness within and without is called *perfection*.\nClinging to being leads to illusion,\nWhile grasping at nonbeing misses the mark.",

things, its principle shines forth—none can defy it.\n\n**Rectifying the Mind, Sincere in Will**\nSincerity and clarity, stillness and stability—these are the roots of the Dao.\nIn movement and stillness, none differ.\nIn daily life, maintain the One in rectitude,\nAnd naturally the heavenly principle responds and communicates.\n\n**The Human Mind is Precarious**\nAlas, how the world clings in deep delusion,\nChasing sounds and sights, ever teetering on peril.\nIf one can return to principle and exhaustively examine the self,\nNature settles, the body is at peace, and the spirit rejoices.\n\n**The Dao-Mind is Subtle**\nThe Dao resides in the daily life of ordinary people,\nManifesting benevolence, concealing its function, and unleashing spiritual power.\nNeither excess nor deficiency—ever present,\nYet how the eyes of ordinary people remain blind.\n\n**Only Precision, Only Oneness**\nThe marvelous mechanism of the heavenly mind lies in its essence and function.\nAbandoning the false to follow the true, one enters the subtle.\nRefining wisdom to enter the spirit—only through steadfast oneness,\nWith deep effort and force, one reaches the state of *xi yi*.\n\n**Faithfully Holding the Mean**\nHaving attained the subtle, one devotes effort to practice,\nThe great Dao, vast and level.\nIn its wondrous applications, the center remains steadfast,\nThe perilous is stabilized, the subtle made clear.\n\n**Exhausting Principle, Fulfilling Nature**\nAbiding in sincerity is essential—first exhaust principle,\nExhausting principle lies in the spiritual power of perfect sincerity.\nWhen sincerity is perfected and principle exhausted, the great root of heaven,\nThe nature of heaven is revealed in supreme radiance.\n\n**To Extend to Destiny**\nOne who delights in heaven and knows destiny is a true noble person,\nOne who exhausts principle and probes the subtle is a great sage.\nSimply holding the mean as the great root,\nFully illuminating the great root, one communes with the spirit.\n\n**Loyalty and Forbearance Alone**\nThe heart that reproves others should first reprove the self,\nThe heart that forgives the self should first forgive others.\nOnly when loyalty and forbearance are both complete does one attain the Dao,\nPersevering to the end, beginning anew—never departing from benevolence.\n\n**Returning to See the Heavenly Mind**\nWhen the host of yin is exhausted, a single yang arises,\nFirmly seal the mysterious pass—do not open it recklessly.\nIn the stillness of utmost quiescence, observe the movement within,\nThe heavenly mind gleams pure—one awakens to the original.\n\n**Knowing All Things in Their Fullness**\nEvery thing in the world embodies the heavenly principle,\nYet few among people today truly know this.\nTracing origins, returning to endings, one preserves the Great Ultimate,\nExhausting the spirit, knowing transformation, one enters non-action.\n\n**Retreating to Conceal in the Profound**\nThe principle of the primordial *Tai Yi* is profound and obscure,\nVast and great, precise and subtle—its wonders beyond assessment.\nSavoring and exploring the mysterious, the mystery lies within the self,\nWashing the mind, retreating to conceal—utmost in sincerity.\n\n**Constant Vigilance in Solitude**\nSeen yet unseen, heard yet soundless,\nIn concealment and revelation, the subtle and profound—ever perfectly sincere.\nIts responsive spiritual mechanism is beyond human fathoming,\nYet the majestic heavenly intent shines forth clearly.\n\n**Unifying with the One**\nEach thing inherently contains a Great Ultimate,\nIts mechanism and seal govern creation, embodying heaven and earth.\nThrough adversity and success, the One pervades—fully the heavenly principle,\nEmbracing the root, returning to the origin, harmonizing with nature.\n\n**Returning to the Ultimate of Non-Ultimate**\nWithin the ultimate of non-ultimate lies the complete Great Ultimate,\nThe Great Ultimate takes form, dividing into the Two Modes.\nThe myriad things, the Three Powers—all are complete within me,\nReturning to the non-ultimate is the sage’s foundation.\n\n**Buddhist Teachings**\n**Two Bodies, One Essence**\nThe Dharma-body is pure and formless in its origin,\nHow can the phenomenal be called the Perfect Body?\nEven if a thousand or ten thousand transformation bodies arise,\nIf they cannot unite as one, they are not wholly true.\n\n**Three Minds as One**\nThe three minds are fundamentally one—originally without division,\nYet grasping and separating them is merely delusion.\nIf one can remain unstained by the present,\nThe past and future all return to emptiness.\n\n**Dissolving to Realize Emptiness**\nBoast not of learning or discussing Chan,\nSimply settle the mind and sever all entanglements.\nDiscard all acquired knowledge and understanding,\nAnd the clouds of delusion disperse—the moon’s radiance is full.\n\n**Manifesting the Subtle Without Interval**\nSeeing yet as if not seen,\nInability to contain and conceal leads back to delusion.\nHiding the body, veiling brilliance—without trace,\nOnly then is one the golden-maned lion child.\n\n**Neither Establishing Existence nor Non-Existence**\nClinging to existence or non-existence—both are hard to fathom,\nDualistic grasping leads to loss and emptiness.\nEven uniting existence and non-existence remains illusion,\nOnly by holding the mean can one merge with spiritual power.\n\n**Precepts, Samadhi, Wisdom**\nIn movement, unmoving—this is true precepts,\nTrue samadhi alone unites with the ancestral lineage.\nWhen wisdom ascends and pervades the Dharma-realm,\nAll karmic illusions and delusions melt away.\n\n**No Fixed Dharma**\nSeeking Dharma through Chan, one’s nature is wholly deluded,\nDeparting from Dharma to seek the mysterious only deepens deviation.\nWhen one realizes Dharma arises from the mind,\nDharma is empty, the mind is quiescent—one sees the Tathagata.\n\n**Empty and Penetrating, Spiritually Communicating**\nAn empty mind, still and stable, communicates with the mysterious feminine,\nPoverty so pure it penetrates the bones—this is the foundation of the Dao.\nThe spirit’s realm gleams bright—the moon of the mind appears,\nThe zenith of Chan alone reveals its great radiance.\n\n**Suchness, Awakened Nature**\nThe true nature is originally perfect and complete,\nSuchness unmoving, illuminating the midst of heaven.\nIts light shines pure and unobstructed,\nPiercing the primordial chaos before the separation of *Hong Meng*.\n\n**Constant Joy, Self, Stillness**\nNurturing the spirit, cultivating the will—yearning for purity and emptiness,\nAll day carefree, at ease in expansion and contraction.\nMost blissful is the true joy within samadhi,\nThe zenith of Chan alone shines, luminous and such.\n\n**Mending the Tattered Robe in the Morning Sun**\nMending the tattered robe in the morning sun—mere pretense,\nPatching the shoulders, then the waist.\nMended only to tear again,\nHow can it compare to being utterly bare?\n\n**Finishing the Sutra by Moonlight**\nThe silver toad in the sky barely half,\nYet the deluded seek to finish the final passage.\nSuddenly, a wisp of dark cloud arrives,\nAnd their eyes remain as blind as ever.\n\n**The Diamond Sutra Pagoda**\nA seamless pagoda, clear and

      "translated_text": "I have often heard that the Most High initiated teachings to guide those yet to come, giving rise to the study of divine transcendents. Yet how could the study of divine transcendents be spoken of in ordinary terms? Only when one encounters a perfected being who illuminates the mind and transforms its nature, who comprehends the mechanism of yin-yang’s opening and closing, and who penetrates the principle of the unity of inherent nature and life-destiny—only then, standing transcendent and independent, responding to transformations without end, may one truly discourse upon the study of divine transcendents.\n\nSince the Eastern Florescence transmitted its lineage, and after the radiance of Zhong and Lü spread forth, transcendents emerged in ranks, all of them eminent scholars and towering masters. Some aided rulers in enacting the Dao above, while others bestowed blessings upon the people to relieve their suffering below. The mystic wind flourished ever more, and those who arose to study transcendence have been countless through the ages.\n\nThereafter, Yingchanzi Li Qing’an emerged, tracing the origins of the Daoist study and receiving esoteric transmission from the divine transcendents. The essence of the Three Teachings was brilliantly clear within his breast. From all directions, seekers flocked to his door, their numbers beyond reckoning, to request his further instruction. His expositions on the wonders of the golden elixir, his exchanges with disciples in answering doubts, and his swift, incisive responses—all these words were recorded and compiled into a book titled *Recorded Sayings of Qing’an*. I have recited its passages again and again: not a single superfluous word in any chapter, not a single extraneous character in any line. All reveal the enduring influence of the Most High and disclose what the earlier perfected ones had left unspoken. Truly, it may be called luminous and wondrous. Its teachings correspond inwardly and outwardly with the *Zhonghe Collection*.\n\nThe feathered scholar Deng Tanran of Jingnan had long transcribed this work. Now, he has commissioned artisans to carve and print it, ensuring the transmission of Qing’an’s virtuous voice endures, and thus demonstrating the universality of his intent. Those who study transcendence and peruse these writings will surely find themselves inspired to transcendence—how could this be but a small contribution?\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Hunranzi, a later student from the Xiū River of Nanchang.",
