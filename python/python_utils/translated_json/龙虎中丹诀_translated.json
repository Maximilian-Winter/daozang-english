and sixth hours,\nWhen the work is complete and the ascension day arrives,\nOnly then shall you believe the speed of the Returned Elixir.\n\n**The Ode of the Embryo’s Chamber**\nWhat is most excellent?\nThe Original Essence, eternal as sun and moon,\nThe Elixir Field deep within the rain,\nThe Mysterious Mother enfolding frost upon the head.\n\nTrue Black congeals as the chamber,\nNuminous Sand solidifies as the hall—\nIn still contemplation, the Sacred Principle is attained,\nThe single Essence pure, beyond the ordinary.\n\n**The Ode of Embryonic Yang**\nThe Five Bandits see what flourishes,\nThe Mysterious Origin’s work is clear—\nThe Sacred Elixir’s birth brings flavor,\nThe Numinous Liquid’s emanation is fragrant.\n\nWithin the abdomen, the splendor of Heaven and Earth,\nIn the cauldron, the eternal sun and moon—\nOnce you grasp the True Method,\nThe single *qi* rings clear and resonant.\n\n**The Ode of the Divine Embryo**\nTo attain the transformation of the Divine Embryo,\nYou must first secretly preserve the Essence.\nThe Six Dragons race through the film of life,\nThe Single Horse gallops with the wind’s roar.\n\nThe mind escapes the Red Dust in haste,\nThe body soars through the Green Void with ease—\nBut if you cultivate this resolve,\nSoon you shall reach the Penglai Isles.\n\n**The Ode of the Embryo’s Spirit**\nTo seek the Embryo’s Spirit,\nFirst endure the bitter refinement of form.\nOne True Essence has its master,\nThree Masters naturally ascend.\n\nThe Heterodox Bones turn golden,\nThe Immortal Cauldron refines the Polar Star—\nWhen you awaken this work,\nDo not weary of reading the *Huangting*.\n\n**The Ode of Embryonic Transformation**\nOn the day when the work is complete and form is forgotten,\nWhen the Embryo seeks to transform—\nAuspicious light arises in the Outer Chamber,\nDivine Water flows from the Lotus Pool.\nHeavenly music is heard at dawn,\nYin Demons wail and depart at night.\nTurning back to thank your birth in the mortal world,\nOrdinary bones shall not follow.\n\n**The True Fire Incantation**\nYang Essence, Yang Essence,\nCome to safeguard my body—\nMy embryo is already numinous,\nUniting with its True Essence.\nAs it is, so it shall be done. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Command.**\n\n**The True Water Incantation**\nGreat Yin, Mysterious Essence,\nBecome my Embryo’s Spirit—\nCalm its soul and spirit,\nGuard and protect its True Form.\nAs it is, so it shall be done. **Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Command.**\n\n**The Circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit Ritual**\n\nThe **Microcosmic Orbit** completes three hundred sixty-five cycles,\nmatching the days of the sun and moon in a year—\nleap days accumulated within, culminating in the inner realm,\nwhere the Four Symbols are activated by the Five Phases.\n\nFor the Five Phases manifest in the Four Seasons,\nhere they are fully revealed:\n\n**Zhen (Thunder, East)**\nOn the Spring Equinox, at the *Mao* hour (5–7 AM),\nface the east, recite the incantation nine times,\nconduct the Fire nine times—\neach time swallow eleven mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,\ntotaling ninety-nine mouthfuls.\n\n**Li (Flame, South)**\nOn the Summer Solstice, at the *Wu* hour (11 AM–1 PM),\nface the south, recite the incantation three times,\nconduct the Fire three times—\neach time swallow twenty-seven mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,\ntotaling eighty-one mouthfuls.\n\n**Dui (Lake, West)**\nOn the Autumn Equinox, at the *You* hour (5–7 PM),\nface the west, recite the incantation seven times,\nconduct the Fire seven times—\neach time swallow ten mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,\nthen twelve more—\ntotaling seventy-two mouthfuls.\n\n**Kan (Water, North)**\nOn the Winter Solstice, at the *Zi* hour (11 PM–1 AM),\nface the north, recite the incantation five times,\nconduct the Fire five times—\neach time swallow twenty mouthfuls from the Lotus Pool,\nthen twenty-eight more—\ntotaling one hundred eighty mouthfuls.\n\n**The Fire Incantation**\n*\"Yùyí jié lún, yùpèi jīnchēng,\nliújīn huǒlíng, jíjí rúlǜ lìng.\"*\n\n**Dragon-Tiger Elixir: Water-Fire Central Dan in Nine Stages**\n\n**First Year**\nThe Sacred Embryo now stands—\nthe Dao immortal may be sought.\nGolden Essence leaps, surging past the Passes,\nFirst banishing the heart’s killing Yin Demons,\nthen the Heart Channel’s rising Lotus Pool Waters.\nYin and Yang clash, birthing wind and thunder—\nsoul and spirit soar, startling dreams and slumber.\nSuddenly, the Six Organs show faint improvement,\nand guarding the True Elixir heals ailments naturally.\n\n**Second Year**\nThe Tortoise Pool awakens at night—\nthe Crimson Sun and Silver Hare surge from the depths.\nDay reveals a body radiant with divine qi,\nall bones free of disease, self-regulating.\nSeated in darkness, divine light shines forth,\neyes flashing like sudden lightning.\nIn dreams, I embrace my elder brother-child,\nthis is the Second Transformation of the Returning Elixir.\n\n**Third Year**\nThe True Elixir nears completion in a thousand days—\nthe Golden Pass and Jade Locks stand firm.\nA thunderous roar boils the sea,\nand the elixir’s essence moistens the joints.\nThe Lotus Pool drips like suspended pearls,\nrepeatedly brewed and rinsed into solidified ghee—\ncapable of healing others, easing suffering.\nIngested for a hundred days, it banishes all calamities.\n\n**Fourth Year**\nDetachment from sensory desires clears the mind,\nthe Three Fields and Six Organs glow like torches.\nDaily, sacred fluids flow as jade ghee,\ngradually shunning rich, pungent foods.\nEarthly bones grow light, transforming into the Divine Chamber,\nfeet become childlike, as if sealed with lacquer.\nWrinkles smooth, hair regrows—\nonly then does the Daoist know the body’s true benefit.\n\n**Fifth Year**\nAfter five years, what then?\nThough flavors taste sweet, they no longer harmonize...\n\n**Sixth Year**\nWhen true yang-qi thrives, one is ever sated—\nall foods suit, yet fire is sparingly used.\nWine flows without measure, yet intoxication never comes;\nits hue and luster sharpen, invigorating the spirit’s essence.\nEach day, the Pearl of Joy turns with sacred grace,\nand naturally, the body ascends to the Daoist’s rank.\n\n**Seventh Year**\nThe elixir’s ninth transformation is no distant dream—\nwith steady gaze, one discerns the autumn hair’s thread at a hundred paces.\nWhy seek external remedies to reverse aging?\nOld scars and blemishes dissolve without trace.\nWithout eating, the prenatal qi sustains—\nthis method escapes the logic of birth and death.\nWith resolute heart, a hundred days’ practice—\nwhat marvels unfold? The first wondrous power, without a tear.\n\n**Eighth Year**\nInner resolve aligns with the boundless void,\nand all worldly attachments fade from the mind.\nThe Nine Parasites vanish, the Three Corpses perish,\nand the soul no longer wanders—dreams cease entirely.\nYang-essence stands firm, nourishing the Spirit Storehouse,\nand the four limbs fear neither cold nor heat.\nOne knows death and life are not to be weighed—\nthe Land of Purity is the Daoist’s path to transcendence.\n\n**Ninth Year**\nThe prenatal Daoist’s spirit longs to take flight,\nand celestial music drifts through stillness at will.\nCommon folk recoil at the sight of carrion’s stench,\nyet divine radiance brightens one’s bearing naturally.\nEarthly spirits appear in white robes daily,\nwhile violet and crimson true mists fill the gaze.\nThis body suddenly transforms into fiery light—\nand thus, the spirit departs the mortal frame.\n\nThe secrets of the Dragon-Tiger elixir are now complete.",

The first wondrous power, without a tear.\n\n**Eighth Year**\nInner resolve aligns with the boundless void,\nand all worldly attachments fade from the mind.\nThe Nine Parasites vanish, the Three Corpses perish,\nand the soul no longer wanders—dreams cease entirely.\nYang-essence stands firm, nourishing the Spirit Storehouse,\nand the four limbs fear neither cold nor heat.\nOne knows death and life are not to be weighed—\nthe Land of Purity is the Daoist’s path to transcendence.\n\n**Ninth Year**\nThe prenatal Daoist’s spirit longs to take flight,\nand celestial music drifts through stillness at will.\nCommon folk recoil at the sight of carrion’s stench,\nyet divine radiance brightens one’s bearing naturally.\nEarthly spirits appear in white robes daily,\nwhile violet and crimson true mists fill the gaze.\nThis body suddenly transforms into fiery light—\nand thus, the spirit departs the mortal frame.\n\nThe secrets of the Dragon-Tiger elixir are now complete.",
