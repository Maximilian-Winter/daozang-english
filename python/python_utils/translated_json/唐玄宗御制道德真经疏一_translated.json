  "full_translation": "**Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang**\n\n**Title:** *Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang*\n**Author:** Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Li Longji\n**Ten fascicles.**\n**Base text source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings of the Divine Empyrean Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n**Collated with:** Dunhuang manuscripts P.3592, P.2823, S.4365.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nLaozi is the inner appellation of the Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Origin. As the profound and abstruse founder of the Dao, he descended and was born in Yi and Bo. Our august imperial ancestor, in solemn succession, bestowed upon our Tang the surname. His teachings for the governance of the world and his boundless blessings have long bestowed distant auspices, tracing their roots to the gourd and melon’s endless vines. His traces of emergence and withdrawal are fully recorded in the annals.\n\nThe Daoist tradition regards him as the Jade Dawn’s responsive title; Sima Qian called him a reclusive gentleman, yet Confucius took him as his teacher. When Laozi expounded the *Classic of the Dao* amidst the scriptures, Confucius inquired about rites, sighing in admiration of his dragon-like virtue—thus, Kong Qiu had no reservations. Having dwelled long in the Zhou court, he was about to guide the western frontier when the Pass Prefect Yin Xi entreated him to compose a text. Thereupon, he unfolded two fascicles, elucidating the source of the Dao and virtue, the nurturing of life and sustenance—nothing lies beyond this, and its essence resides in governing the self and governing the state.\n\nTo govern the state is to renounce ostentation and extravagance, taking non-action and silence as instruction. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone. If lords and kings can preserve it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\"* It further says: *\"I take no action, and the people transform of themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves; I delight in stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nTo govern the self is to diminish selfishness and reduce desires, making an empty mind and a full belly one’s duty. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"Constantly take no desire to observe its mysteries.\"* It also says: *\"Do not value rare goods; do not display what may be desired.\"* And further: *\"Block its apertures, close its gates, blunt its sharpness, untangle its knots.\"* All these are to be preserved with softness, weakness, femininity, and stillness. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.\"* And: *\"Know the masculine, but preserve the feminine.\"* Such is its great purport.\n\nAs for exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, closing off conditions and stilling thoughts, acting in accord with reality while exercising adaptability, sitting in forgetfulness and relinquishing illumination, diminishing again and again, and delving into the mysterious again and again—these are scarcely attainable through words and transmission.\n\nHis teachings are all-encompassing, his text concise, his purport expansive, his words accessible. Thus, those who wander its corridors and chambers all believe themselves to have ascended the hall and glimpsed its inner sanctum. Yet only upon profound study and deep reflection do they realize that, even at the tip of an autumn hair, they have not attained one ten-thousandth of it.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name; I style it the Dao; forced to name it, I call it Great.\"* Thus, the Great Dao is the forced appellation for the ultimate emptiness and wondrous root, naming its function of universal generation.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"In the Grand Beginning, there was Nonbeing. This Nonbeing refers to the existence of this wondrous Nonbeing.\"* He also said: *\"Nonbeing has no name. The nameless is the absence of forced names.\"* Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\"* Forced to name its universal generation, it is called the Dao. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The named is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nZhuangzi further said: *\"That by which things obtain life is called virtue.\"* Virtue (*de*) means attainment (*de*), signifying that the myriad transformations of heaven and earth, the lateral communication of all things, all rely on the wondrous root for their generation and completion. Attaining life is virtue. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\"* Hence, the Dao is the substance of virtue, and virtue is the function of the Dao.\n\nThe division of the Scripture into upper and lower fascicles first clarifies the Dao, followed by virtue. However, while the names of substance and function may be separated, their reality cannot. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"They emerge together yet have different names; together they are called the Mysterious.\"* Speaking of their emergence, they divide into two; inquiring into their unity, they merge into one. Hence, it is said they may be separated yet cannot be separated.\n\nThus, the upper fascicle states: *\"This is called mysterious virtue,\"* and: *\"The bearing of the profoundly virtuous,\"* and: *\"The virtuous are aligned with virtue,\"* and: *\"Constant virtue does not depart.\"* The lower fascicle states: *\"Lose the Dao, then virtue,\"* and: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Dao,\"* and: *\"The Dao generates the One,\"* and: *\"The Great Dao is utterly level.\"* Thus, substance and function are mutually expounded, alternately clarifying the essentials—there is no need to rigidly assign them to the upper or lower fascicles.\n\nThe term *jing* (scripture) means \"path,\" signifying the path of communication; it also means \"constant,\" signifying the constant path of communication.\n\nEver mindful of our sagely ancestor’s bequeathed teachings and the plans left for his descendants, in moments of respite from governance, I have devoted myself to lecturing and reading. Now, I once again elucidate a few of its essential mysteries. Words cannot exhaust meaning; I roughly set forth the great outline to aid scholars.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Fascicle One**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThis chapter clarifies the origin of the wondrous root and the ancestral source of the myriad transformations. It first sets forth the forced appellation of ultimate emptiness, then elucidates the return of all wonders to their source.\n\nThus, *\"the Dao that can be spoken\"* clarifies substance and function; *\"the nameless\"* and *\"the named\"* clarify root and trace; *\"no desire\"* and *\"desire\"* clarify the two modes of observation; *\"emerging together yet having different names\"* clarifies the dispersal of the uncarved block into vessels; *\"together called the Mysterious\"* clarifies the return of vessels to the uncarved block; *\"mysterious and again mysterious\"* distinguishes the forgetting of both; *\"the gate of all wonders\"* points to the attainment of enlightenment.\n\nThese are the gradual steps of progressive cultivation and the great method of embodied realization.\n\n***\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"***\n\n**Commentary:** The Dao is the forced appellation for the ultimate emptiness and wondrous root. It means \"to communicate\" and \"path.\" The first character establishes the宗 (foundation).\n\n*\"That can be spoken\"* means this wondrous root universally generates the myriad things, serving as the path by which the myriad things emerge. It may be called the Dao, hence *\"that can be spoken.\"*\n\n*\"Not the constant Dao\"* means the wondrous root’s generation and transformation have no fixed method. Forced to name it, it cannot be exhaustively described. Thus, it may be called *\"great,\"* or *\"receding,\"* or *\"distant,\"* or *\"near\"*—it is not constant to one Dao. Hence, *\"not the constant Dao.\"*\n\n**\"The name that can be named is not the constant name.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Name\"* refers to the designation applied to things, the name derived from the Dao’s function. The first character likewise establishes the *宗* (foundation). *\"That can be named\"* means names arise from function and may thus be established. *\"Not the constant name\"* means: in heaven, it is called *\"pure\"*; on earth, it is called *\"tranquil.\"* Though the attainment of the One is not distinct, when constrained by function, names differ. Thus, it is not constant to one name. Hence, *\"not the constant name.\"*\n\n**\"Nameless—the beginning of heaven and earth.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Nameless\"* means that before the myriad transformations arose, no forced appellation existed. Thus, *Zhuangzi* states: *\"In the Great Beginning, there was Non-Being; Non-Being had no name.\"* Yet when the wondrous root descended as *qi* and opened heaven and earth, heaven and earth mutually sustained each other as their primordial beginning. Hence, *\"nameless—the beginning of heaven and earth.\"* This corresponds to the *Yijing*’s *\"Great Ultimate generating the Two Modes.\"* The annotation *\"权舆\"* (beginning) cites the *Erya*: *\"权舆* means *beginning*.\"\n\n**\"Named—the mother of the myriad things.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Named\"* means that in response to function, things are crafted, and forced appellations arise. Once the myriad transformations unfold and the ten thousand things take form, the wondrous root pervades all, sustaining human use. Through its abundant nurturance, it is called *\"mother\"*—*\"mother\"* signifying the principle of flourishing nourishment. Thus, *\"nameless\"* and *\"named\"* are distinctions the sage makes regarding function to clarify the identity and difference of root and trace, yet the Dao is not bound to either named or nameless.\n\n**\"Constantly without desire, observe its mystery; constantly with desire, observe its manifestations.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Desire\"* is the movement of nature, the arising of mind in pursuit of objects. To *\"constantly be without desire\"* means the true nature is pure and still; turning inward to illumine the source of the Dao, one observes the wondrous root. If there is desire, the mind arises in pursuit of objects, and nature is disturbed by desire. Observing the root through desire, one loses the harmony of the mean and sees only its edges and boundaries. *\"徼\"* means *\"boundary.\"*\n\n**Alternative Explanation:** *\"Desire\"* refers to the act of contemplative intent. It means establishing teachings through the presence of intent. *\"Constantly without desire\"* means the Dharma is pure and still, free from verbal expression, without contemplative intent—thus one perceives the subtlety of the Dao. *\"Constantly with desire\"* means proceeding from the root to function, establishing teachings through words, responding to things and penetrating all, transforming and perfecting the world—thus one sees the convergence of the multitude. *\"徼\"* means *\"convergence.\"*\n\n**\"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"These\"* refers to the above matters. *\"Two\"* denotes *\"that which can be spoken\"* and *\"that which can be named,\"* *\"nameless\"* and *\"named,\"* *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire\"*—each forming a pair. Hence, *\"two.\"* Both derive from the wondrous root, thus *\"emerge from the same source.\"* Yet as names are established according to function, they differ.\n\n**\"Together they are called the profound.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Profound\"* means *\"deep and wondrous.\"* In terms of emergence, names differ—this is the descent from root to trace. In terms of unity, it is deep and wondrous—this is the return of trace to root. Returning to the root is deep and wondrous, hence *\"called the profound.\"*\n\n**\"Profound and yet again profound—the gateway of the manifold mysteries.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** Returning trace to root is called *\"profound.\"* Yet if one abides in this profundity, traces re-emerge, and names differ once more, equal and without distinction. Thus, by borrowing *\"again profound\"* to transcend *\"profound,\"* one is urged not to cling to profundity. When root and trace are both forgotten, this is called *\"non-abiding.\"* In non-abiding, one attains *\"emergent realization.\"* The annotation *\"意因不生\"* (no arising of intent) cites the *Xisheng Jing*: *\"Emerging together yet bearing different forms, each generates its own intent.\"* Now, with no arising of intent, one is united in profound wondrousness. *\"Without desire for the absence of desire\"* means that to seek the absence of desire is still to harbor a desiring mind. To seek the absence of desire is not yet free from desire. Now, with neither desire nor the absence of desire, transcending one after another, all is utterly forgotten. Such correct contemplation is the manifold mysteries. Though the mysteries are many, if one emerges through this gateway, it is called *\"the gateway of the manifold mysteries.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two**\nThe preceding chapter clarified the difference between the wondrous root’s generation and transformation and the two modes of observation. This chapter reveals how, when the uncarved block scatters, causes diverge into myriad distinctions, and one pursues objects, drifting and wandering. Yet through skillful transformation, one returns to the root. Thus, it begins by exposing the deluded attachment to beauty and goodness, then demonstrates the mutual subversion of being and non-being, concluding with the sage’s principle to guide the return to primordial simplicity.\n\n**\"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.\"**\n\n**Commentary:**\n\"All under heaven\" refers broadly to everything beneath the encompassing sky. \"Beauty\" denotes what the heart finds sweet and pleasing. \"Goodness\" signifies what the body enacts. It speaks of how all people under heaven recognize as beauty what their own hearts find sweet, and as goodness what their own bodies practice. Thus, those who favor sweetness reject bitterness; those who cherish vermilion dismiss plainness. In mutual contention and rivalry, they vie in asserting right and wrong—all arising from the stirring of desire. Hence, beauty and ugliness arise in succession.\n\nThe sage knows that beauty and ugliness have no fixed essence; both are deluded attachments. Such attachments are impermanent, and thus it is said, \"ugliness arises.\" *Yi* serves as a grammatical particle.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"The wondrous and the putrid\"*—as *Zhuangzi* states: what is deemed wondrous is called \"divine and marvelous,\" while what is despised is called \"foul and rotten.\"\n\n**\"Being and non-being give rise to each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of being and non-being in their nature. Being does not arise of itself but comes into existence through non-being; the common view mistakenly holds that non-being generates being. Non-being does not arise of itself but comes into existence through being; the common view mistakenly holds that being generates non-being. Thus, it is said they \"give rise to each other.\" Yet in the pairing of being and non-being, they do not inherently generate one another. The notion of \"giving rise\" arises only from deluded attachment. Just as beauty and ugliness do not arise from inherent nature, all is empty. The sage, wishing to rescue the deluded from their stagnation, thus enumerates the six confusions.\n\n**\"Difficulty and ease complete each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of difficulty and ease in their nature. What is difficult for one becomes easy for another; what is easy for one becomes difficult for another—just as a carpenter finds wood easy but clay difficult, while a potter finds clay easy but wood difficult. Thus, it is said, \"difficulty and ease complete each other.\" If all shared the same difficulty, there would be no ease; if all shared the same ease, there would be no difficulty. Difficulty and ease have no true substance; their names arise from delusion. Such is the emptiness of dharmas. Therefore, one who fully understands this forgets both skill and clumsiness, and the names of difficulty and ease cease—just as beauty and ugliness have no fixed nature.\n\n**\"Long and short reveal each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the mutual emptiness of long and short. Long reveals short, and short reveals long—thus, it is said, \"long and short reveal each other.\" Just as the leg of a teal is not inherently short, but appears so because the crane’s leg is long (and lengthening it would cause distress), and the crane’s leg is not inherently long, but appears so because the teal’s leg is short (and shortening it would bring sorrow). Seeing long and short as relative is like beauty and ugliness: lacking fixed standards, all is deluded attachment.\n\n**\"High and low incline toward each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of the names \"high\" and \"low.\" The two terms mutually contend and supplant one another. To call something high depends on what is low, yet there is always something higher; to call something low depends on what is high, yet there is always something lower. Thus, what is called high is not truly high, and what is called low is not truly low. In the world, those with rank and title alternately serve as ministers and servants—all is impermanent and empty, lacking fixed position.\n\n**\"Sound and voice harmonize with each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of harmony. When the five notes blend, who composes the melody? It is the combination of all sounds that enables the creation of music. Like worldly dharmas, all arise from harmony, yet their essence is not real—all is empty. How, then, can one definitively judge beauty and ugliness? Such is not the discourse of true insight.\n\n**\"Before and after follow each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of the three times in thought. The sun and moon alternate, each succeeding the other with renewal. Like taking a step, which comes first—before or after? The names \"before\" and \"after\" arise only from their mutual following. Names are established by delusion—who knows their origin? Past, future, and present—all three times are empty, for thoughts shift moment by moment. This, too, is like beauty and ugliness, which have no fixed names.\n\n**\"Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\"**\n**Commentary:** \"Therefore\" introduces what follows to illuminate what precedes. Those who adorn themselves with cunning and deceit, though silent, do not embody non-action. Those who embrace authenticity and simplicity, though gesturing all day, remain ever at ease. Thus, the sage, knowing the emptiness of all dharmas, is free from attachment. To govern all under heaven, one must abandon superficiality and employ pure virtue, so that the people are transformed and each rests in their proper place. When each rests in their proper place, there is no disturbance—is this not the affair of non-action? Words arise from one’s own mind yet align with the hearts of all under heaven. Thus, though one may speak all their life, they have never truly spoken—is this not the teaching without words?\n\n**\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them.\"**\n**Commentary:** *Arise* means to move; *refuse* means to decline or reject. The sage, skilled in transformation, engages in no affairs and practices non-action. The people, unaware, wander and rejoice, each following their own movements without offering thanks to the sage. Thus, they drum on their bellies and play in the earth, forgetting the emperor’s power—this is the people forgetting the sage’s merit.\n\n**\"He gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely on it, accomplishes yet does not dwell in it.\"**\n**Commentary:** Allowing things to fulfill their nature, the sage does not claim them as his own. Enabling things to pursue their endeavors, the sage does not regard them as his achievement. Even as the great work of peace extends ever further, he remains as cautious in the end as at the beginning, never daring to rest. This is the sage forgetting his own merit.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"Day by day, he grows more cautious\"*—a phrase from the *Book of Documents*.\n\n**\"Only because he does not dwell in it does it not leave him.\"**\n**Commentary:** The sage, straight as an arrow yet ever vigilant, maintains the same care at the end as at the beginning, never faltering from start to finish. Never resting in ease or indulgence, his virtue daily renews. Forgetting his merit, the merit does not depart; illuminating the world, all under heaven is at peace. Thus, it is said, \"Only because he does not dwell in it does it not leave him.\"\n\n**\"Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how the myriad distinctions pursue objects, yet through skillful transformation, one returns to the root. This chapter reveals that when exalting the worthy is not practiced, non-action leads to the ultimate principle. It begins by rejecting the exaltation of worthiness to eliminate traces of pride and favoritism, then expounds the sage’s principle to demonstrate the method of establishing teaching, concluding with non-action to illuminate how transformation is accomplished and simplicity restored.\n\n**\"Not Exalting the Worthy\" (continued)**\n\nBy not exalting the worthy, the people are made not to contend.\n*Commentary:* *Exalting* means to honor and esteem; *worthy* refers to talent and ability. If the ruler honors talent and ability, those who advance will embellish falsehoods, chasing appearances and losing their true nature. The loss of truth is the very cause of exalting the worthy, and the pursuit of appearances inevitably gives rise to the ill of contention. How much better to mold them through profound transformation, entrusting all to non-action—like clouds naturally following the dragon, or wind ever accompanying the tiger. Then, with Yao and Shun upon the throne, there will be no lack of ministers like the *yuan* and *kai*; Yi and Lü will ascend the court, naturally attaining the esteem of the *taiheng*. Each will remain in their proper place, and none will covet what is not theirs, thus ending contention.\n\nBy not prizing rare and precious goods, the people are made not to steal.\n*Commentary:* In receiving life, each is allotted a portion. The materials, tools, and treasures of the body are the goods of one’s allotted share; to seek beyond this is to desire what cannot be obtained, hence \"rare and precious.\" To disregard one’s inherent nature and yearn for cleverness is to lose one’s celestial truth and become a thief of the private. Now, if the wise and foolish alike follow their nature, employing their faculties as they ought, there will be no transgressive desires, and rare goods will naturally be held in light regard. When all abide within their allotted nature, who would steal? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"The benevolence of the unbenevolent steals the essence of life and nature, glutting itself on wealth and honor.\" Another interpretation: If the ruler does not prize pearls, rhinoceros horns, or precious treasures, his governance will be pure and tranquil. The people, transformed by this, will themselves renounce greed, each knowing contentment, and thus none will steal.\n\nBy not displaying what is desirable, the heart is made not to be confused.\n*Commentary:* Yearning for cleverness is to see what is desirable. When desire arises and stirs, what is this if not confusion? Now, since one neither exalts worthy ability nor transgresses one’s allotted portion with vain seeking, one does not see what is desirable, and the heart is not deluded or disordered.\n\nThus, in the governance of the sage,\n*Commentary:* The sage governs the state and orders the self, taking this as the foundation of teaching. What, then, is there to do in governing the state? It is simply to order the self. Therefore, empty the heart and fill the belly, extinguish desire and forget knowledge. In acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\nEmpty their hearts,\n*Commentary:* When the heart is employed in pursuing external things, worldly affairs cloud and confuse it. When contemplation is tranquil and truth is preserved whole, emotions and desires do not arise. When emotions and desires do not arise, the heart is empty. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The empty room gives birth to brightness,\" meaning that when the heart is empty, pure brightness arises alone. Thus, it is said: empty their hearts.\n\nFill their bellies,\n*Commentary:* The belly is the faculty of containment and receptivity. When it is full, there is no greed. It is desired that virtue and power fill one inwardly, so that no covetous love arises. Thus, it is said: fill their bellies. The note refers to the remonstrance of Mo Ruo of the state of Chen during the Spring and Autumn period, who admonished Wei Xianzi, wishing to take the belly of the petty man as the heart of the noble one—content when sated, ceasing to eat.\n\nWeaken their ambitions,\n*Commentary:* Ambition is the heart’s affair; what resides in the heart is called ambition. It is desired that all the heart’s movements be guarded by softness and weakness. Thus, it is known that when the heart is empty, ambition is weak.\n\nStrengthen their bones.\n*Commentary:* The bones are the body’s framework. When virtue and power fill one inwardly, there is no covetous grasping. Without covetousness, the belly is full; when the belly is full, the bones are naturally strong.\n\nEver cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire,\n*Commentary:* The reason the sage practices the teaching of emptying the heart and filling the belly is to ever cause the people to be without the knowledge of contention and exaltation, without the desires of covetous seeking, allowing them to transform themselves.\n\nAnd cause those with knowledge not to dare act.\n*Commentary:* Those without knowledge and desire are already pure and tranquil. Thus, those with knowledge are gradually molded and transformed by their purity, not daring to act in pursuit of appearances or covetous seeking, and so act through non-action.\n\nAct through non-action, and nothing is not well-ordered.\n*Commentary:* To act in accordance with one’s nature is to act without acting. Moreover, by eliminating the traces of exalting the worthy and not seeking rare goods, people abide within their allotted portions, and things surely preserve their true nature. In acting through non-action, what need is there for ostentation or pursuit in transformation? Since there is no fragrance and no stench, people thus do not recognize or know. With the great flourishing of pure wind, who would say it is not well-ordered?\n\n**\"Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Emptiness\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when exalting the worthy is not practiced, non-action leads to the ultimate principle. This chapter reveals the function of the wondrous root, acting through non-action. It begins by marking the Dao’s emptiness to show the origin of utmost vacuity, then speaks of subduing and untying to clarify how emptiness resolves entanglements. Next, it expounds the marvel of harmony and sameness, its radiance untainted by dust, concluding with the image of preceding the Emperor, desiring that all know where to return.\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet in its use it is never exhausted. Profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\n*Commentary:* *Empty* means vacuous; it is said that the Dao employs emptiness as its function. The harmonious *qi* is empty, thus it functions as the Dao. In its functioning, it gives birth to the myriad things, and things receive its power. If one speaks of its power, things doubt its vastness; if one speaks of its emptiness, the Dao has never been full. Yet its wondrous root is deep and tranquil, ever the ancestor of the myriad things. It is said \"seems\" because the Dao is not a fixed thing, thus it is not spoken of directly. The rest follow this example.\n\nSubdue its sharpness, untie its entanglements.\n*Commentary:* *Subdue* means to restrain; *sharpness* means keen and cutting. *Untie* means to release; *entanglements* means many disturbances. The function of emptiness is not opposed by things, thus the heart’s keenness and the affairs’ disturbances, when mindful of the Dao’s emptiness and harmony, are naturally restrained and released. This is to take the person to clarify the Dao’s function. The note refers to the \"Mending Nature\" chapter of *Zhuangzi*, which says: \"Mending nature through the vulgar, using vulgar learning to seek to return to one’s beginning.\" It means that keenness and entanglements arise from desire, thus mindfulness of the Dao subdues and unties them, while vulgar learning only further binds them.\n\nHarmonize its radiance, blend with its dust. Abysmal! It seems perhaps to exist.\n*Commentary:* The Dao’s empty function does not abandon things. In radiance, it is one with radiance; in dust, it is one with dust. It is nowhere not present, yet where it is, it is ever without form. In its empty function, it can merge radiance and dust; in its wondrous root, it is abysmally still and not confined. Thus, it is said \"seems perhaps.\"\n\nI know not whose child it is—it seems to precede the semblance of the Lord.\n*Commentary:* \"I\" refers to the Old Master’s self-designation. \"Semblance\" means \"to resemble.\" The Old Master says: I observe the Dao’s empty function, which gives life to and completes the myriad things. Tracing its origin, I cannot fathom its source. Since there is no one who acts as its father, I know not whose child the Dao is. Yet all things rely on the Dao to be born, so it seems to exist before the Lord. The note says: the Lord is the master of all living things. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Lord emerges from the Thunder.\" Fu Xi comments: \"The Lord is the master of living things, the source of growth and benefit.\" Another interpretation: \"Semblance\" means \"to manifest signs.\" This Lord of living things can manifest the forms of things, hence it is called the \"Semblance-Lord.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 5**\nThe previous chapter clarified the wondrous root and empty function, embodying non-action in both essence and application. This chapter reveals how partial love fosters selfishness, and partiality makes universality difficult. It begins by likening the myriad things to straw dogs to illustrate Heaven and Earth’s impartial forgetfulness, then compares them to a bellows to show how emptiness remains inexhaustible and unobstructed. It concludes with the admonition that excessive speech leads to exhaustion, urging one to abide in centered harmony.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not humane—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane—he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n*Commentary:* \"Humane\" refers to the term for universal love. \"Straw\" is grass; straw dogs are made of bound grass for sacrificial use. *Zhuangzi* says: Master Jin said to Yan Hui: \"Before straw dogs are displayed, they are wrapped in embroidered silk. Once displayed, the gatherers of firewood take them to burn.\" Now, Heaven and Earth, being supremely humane, give life to and complete all things. Yet like one who binds grass into dogs, they do not demand the merit of barking or guarding, nor do they regard their act of giving life as a benevolent favor—hence they are called \"not humane.\" Thus, the sage who lets the world be should view the hundred clans in the same way. The note says: \"Concealing kindness\" refers to the *Record of Rites*, where Confucius says: \"Even when covering [a dead dog], one does not discard it.\" \"Not only loving one’s own kin\" is a passage from the *Record of Rites*.\n\nIs not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\n*Commentary:* A \"bellows\" is a leather sack used to blow air and fan fire. A \"pipe\" is a flute. That Heaven and Earth regard the myriad things as straw dogs is because their space is empty, so they give life without partiality and do not seek gratitude. It is like a bellows blowing wind or a flute emitting breath—constantly responding to requests, yet without attachment. Thus, it remains empty without exhaustion or obstruction, and the more it moves, the more it produces sound and qi. This serves as a model for rulers: if they empty their minds and embrace profound silence, their transformation will be pure and uniform, without exhaustion or obstruction. In daily use, they will act without knowing, and the more they move, the more they will produce.\n\nExcessive speech leads to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center.\n*Commentary:* \"Excessive speech\" refers to many words of universal love. Though one may speak much of universal love, putting it into practice is difficult to achieve universally, so one often meets with exhaustion and failure. Thus, it is better to forget concerns and respond emptily, embracing centered harmony—then all will naturally be sufficient. The note says: \"Not reciprocating\" means \"to answer.\" It refers to having empty words without corresponding action.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 6**\nThe previous chapter revealed how partial love fosters selfishness, and partiality makes universality difficult. This chapter clarifies how supreme emptiness responds, and such response is inexhaustible. It begins by invoking the Valley Spirit to illustrate the Dao through its spiritual function, then speaks of the Mysterious Female to distinguish the mysterious power that mothers all things. It concludes with the subtle and ceaseless, showing how empty response requires no toil.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\n*Commentary:* The \"Valley Spirit\" illustrates how a valley echoes sound, resembling how the Dao responds to things—it responds to stimuli as if spiritually. \"Spirit\" is the name for the unfathomable. \"Death\" means rest or cessation. The unfathomable response never rests, hence it is said the Valley Spirit does not die. \"Mysterious\" means profound. \"Female\" means mother. The Valley Spirit’s response is profoundly subtle and indescribable; all things flourish and are nourished by it, hence it is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n*Commentary:* The Mysterious Female’s function responds to all stimuli, and its response emerges from things, hence it is called a \"gate.\" Heaven and Earth are the greatest of the formed. Without the Mysterious Female’s function, they would disperse and dissipate. Thus, they rely on and receive the One as their root, hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nCeaselessly, as if existing—its use is not toilsome.\n*Commentary:* \"Ceaselessly\" conveys the meaning of subtle and unbroken. The Mysterious Female’s function responds to things without partiality. Its subtlety is described as \"as if existing,\" and its impartiality means its use does not grow weary.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 7**\nThe previous chapter clarified how the Valley Spirit’s empty response is inexhaustible. This chapter reveals how Heaven and Earth are selfless, and selflessness makes them enduring. It begins by using Heaven and Earth as an analogy, then turns to the sage to further illustrate, concluding with how selflessness achieves selfish ends, urging diligence in this practice.\n\nHeaven is enduring, Earth is lasting.\n*Commentary:* This marks the chapter’s theme. Heaven, by its qi and appearance, is called \"enduring.\" Earth, by its form and substance, is called \"lasting.\" The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can live long.\n\n*Commentary:* The previous line posed the question; this line offers a hypothetical answer: The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they cover and bear the myriad things, nurturing and raising all beings, all of which rely on and observe the wondrous root. They do not pride themselves on their power of giving life and completion—hence they can be enduring. Another interpretation: \"Do not live for themselves\" means Heaven and Earth merely give life to and nourish the myriad things, without enriching their own lives—hence they can be enduring.\n\nTherefore, the sage places himself behind yet finds himself ahead; sets himself outside yet finds himself preserved.\n*Commentary:* Therefore, the sage emulates Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing, bestowing equal nurture without partiality. Thus, he defers to others, and the people rejoice in and rely on him, looking up to him as their leader—hence he finds himself ahead.\n\nThe sage does not exalt himself in honor, but instead humbles his own person, so the world turns toward benevolence, free from fear or harm—thus his person is preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest? Therefore he can fulfill his own interest.\n\n*Commentary:* Is it not because Heaven and Earth have no self-interested heart that they can achieve their enduring preservation, and the sage can find himself ahead and preserved? Is it not because of this absence of self-interest that they fulfill their own enduring preservation and precedence?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**\nThe previous chapter clarified that Heaven and Earth, being without self-interest in giving life and completion, endure long. This chapter clarifies that the perfected person, practicing goodness through softness and weakness, remains free from blame. It begins by likening the highest virtue to water, illustrating how its three capacities approximate the Dao. Next, it describes dwelling in lowly places, enumerating the seven virtues that benefit all things. It concludes with the principle of non-contention, urging the preservation of softness to achieve complete victory.\n\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\n*Commentary:* \"The highest virtue\" refers to the person. \"Resembles water\" is the analogy. The perfected person, with an empty mind, abides in non-attachment, forgetting goodness yet embodying the highest goodness. The conduct of the highest virtue, like the capacities of water, is fully expounded below, containing both principle and analogy.\n\nWater benefits the myriad things yet does not contend; it dwells where the multitude disdain.\n*Commentary:* Water’s nature is sweet and cool, scattering and moistening all things. Those who receive its moisture and benefit grow—hence it is said to \"benefit,\" this being its first capacity. Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water; its levelness can be taken as a model, its clarity can reflect people. When it flows and encounters hollows, it yields and follows. Wherever it is led, it never contends—this is its second capacity. All people shun lowly places, but water flows downward, embracing the turbid and dwelling in the foul without refusal—this is its third capacity. Thus it nearly approximates the Dao.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Near\" means close. Benefiting things demonstrates its great benefit; non-contention manifests its softness and weakness; dwelling in the foul shows its capacity to endure disgrace. These three capacities of water’s nature are unified in the perfected person. With conduct such as this, he is not far from the Dao—hence it is said to be \"near.\"\n\nDwelling in goodness, it abides in the earth.\n*Commentary:* Where the perfected person dwells, he is good at benefiting others. Like water on the earth, its benefits to things are many. Moreover, the earth’s way is to be lowly, and water loves to flow downward, both resembling the perfected person’s humility and compliance, approximating the Dao’s nature of softness and weakness—hence it is said to \"dwell in goodness, abiding in the earth.\"\n\nIts heart is good in its depth.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s heart is good at tranquility, like water’s nature, still and deep as a spring. When water is still, it is clear and bright; when the heart is at leisure, it attains enlightenment. \"Depth\" means profound stillness—hence it is said the \"heart is good in its depth.\"\n\nIn giving, it is good in benevolence.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s great aid is always to give to others. The merit of his generous bestowal accords with benevolent conduct. Like water moistening things, it is without partiality of love or aversion—hence it is said to \"give in goodness, embodying benevolence.\"\n\nIn speech, it is good in sincerity.\n*Commentary:* The person of highest virtue speaks with utmost truthfulness, transforming the common people with good faith and sincerity, never deceiving. Like a flowing spring, how could it differ in treacherous terrain? Hence it is said to \"speak in goodness, embodying sincerity.\"\n*Note:* \"Moving through danger without losing its sincerity\" is the *Zhouyi* hexagram *Kan*’s line statement.\n\nIn governance, it is good in order.\n*Commentary:* \"Governance\" means rectitude. The perfected person, in all affairs, acts without self-will, rectifying his demeanor to awaken things, so that things follow his rectitude. When rectitude prevails, is this not goodness? Like water’s nature, washing and cleansing all things, making them pure and still—hence it is said to \"govern in goodness, bringing order.\"\n\nIn affairs, it is good in ability.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person is perfectly enlightened, unhindered by things. In all movements and undertakings, he is thoroughly capable. This capability is called luminous understanding. Like water’s nature, when channeled it becomes a river, when dammed it becomes a pond. It floats boats and embraces the void, accomplishing all things—this is its goodness in ability.\n\nIn movement, it is good in timing.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s heart is like an empty valley, comparable to a mirror or reflection: when things stir, it responds. Like water’s nature, melting in spring and freezing in winter, it ebbs and flows with the seasons—hence it is said to \"move in goodness, embodying timeliness.\"\n\nOnly by not contending does it remain free from blame.\n*Commentary:* \"Blame\" means fault. The perfected person’s good conduct does no harm to things. With an empty heart, he bends to preserve all, never contending. Flowing like waves, yielding and submissive, he never opposes things—thus he remains free from the realm of fault and blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding to Fullness**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the perfected person, practicing goodness through softness and weakness, remains free from blame. This chapter clarifies that the common people, drowning in emotion and prideful fullness, incur fault. It begins by illustrating the difficulty of preserving fullness and sharpness, then warns against the pursuit of gold, jade, and wealth, concluding with the principle of withdrawing when one’s name is achieved and work is done, urging the forgetting of merit and non-abiding.\n\nHolding to fullness is not as good as stopping.\n*Commentary:* \"Holding\" means grasping. \"Fullness\" means repletion. \"Stopping\" means cessation. The human heart is greedy and covetous, seeking without satiety. Grasping and preserving, it strives to make things full. Accumulating wealth becomes a burden, and regret and misfortune inevitably arise. Thus the sage warns: it is better to cease.\n\nSharpening to a point cannot be long preserved.\n*Commentary:* \"Sharpening\" means measuring. \"Point\" means sharpness. The common people, mired in attachment, covet glory and profit. Thus they measure past affairs, honing their desires to a sharp edge. Ghosts watch, people resent, and calamity and fault are invited—hence it is said this cannot be long preserved.\n\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\n*Commentary:* If covetousness is never abandoned, it may lead to gold and jade filling the hall. Yet the elephant’s tusks bring fire upon its body, and the pheasant fears the sacrificial altar and cuts off its tail. Losing the treasure of non-covetousness, one sits and invites the worry of bandits and thieves. How can such harm be called \"guarding\"? This further explains the difficulty of holding to fullness.\n\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance bring one’s own fault.\n*Commentary:* \"Bring\" means to give. Wealth invites others to seek it, hence one easily deceives things. Honor invites others to submit, hence one delights in overpowering others. Arrogance and extravagance arise unexpectedly, and calamity and fault come—who is to blame? Since fault arises from arrogance, and arrogance is born of the self, it is said to \"bring one’s own fault.\" This further explains the difficulty of sharpening to a point.\n\nWhen merit is achieved, name established, and the body withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThis presents a warning. For fullness invites loss, while humility readily receives benefit. Even Heaven’s Way does not remain constantly full—thus those who achieve merit collapse, and those who establish fame suffer decline. To seek long preservation, such words have never been heard. One must forget both merit and fame, withdraw the self, and decline excess. Following Heaven’s Way, one does not lose the balance of fullness and emptiness, and thus bears no worry or blame.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Po-Soul**\nThe previous chapter showed how indulgence in desire and arrogance in fullness bring fault; this chapter reveals that nurturing the spirit and cherishing qi without admixture leaves no flaw. From \"Nurturing the po-soul\" to \"cleansing and purifying\" instructs on cultivating the body to preserve virtue. From \"loving the people\" to \"understanding clearly\" demonstrates that when virtue is whole, one may become a ruler. The conclusion with \"giving life and nourishing\" illustrates the mysterious power extending to all things.\n\n**\"Nurturing the po-soul and embracing the One—can one not be separated from it?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Nurturing\" (載) means the beginning. \"Nurturing\" (營) means to protect. When a person first receives life and begins transformation, there is only an empty form. Once the po-soul is born, yang qi fills the empty po. When the po can move, it is called the hun-soul—like the moon’s po reflecting the sun, light is born. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and Zichan say: \"At the beginning of human life, it is called po. Once po is born, yang becomes hun.\" This means that when one first possesses the empty po, one should nurture and protect the yang qi, keeping it always full, so that life may be preserved whole. If movement and use are inconsistent, scattering the yang qi, one reverts to an empty po and perishes. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The heart near death—do not let it regain yang.\" Thus, one is instructed to nurture and protect the empty po, restoring yang to preserve life, embracing and guarding pure oneness without admixture, never separating from the body—then life is preserved whole. This teaches the nurturing of spirit.\n\n**\"Concentrating qi to attain softness—can one be like an infant?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Concentrating\" means focusing singularly. \"Qi\" is the subtle, harmonious qi. The foundation of human life is the primordial qi. If one is tainted by worldly realms, the primordial qi scatters, and the spirit cannot stabilize the body. Thus, one is warned to concentrate the harmonious qi, attaining softness and weakness, able to be like an infant, without attachment. This teaches the nurturing of qi.\n\n**\"Cleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror—can one be without flaw?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Cleansing\" means washing. \"Purifying\" means ordering. \"Mysterious mirror\" is the illumination of the heart. \"Flaw\" is sickness. When one indulges in worldly attachments, desire arises. One must wash and order, purifying the heart’s illumination so that love and desire do not arise—can one then be without flaw? This teaches the cleansing of the heart.\n\n**\"Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without contrivance?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Loving the people\" means not oppressing them with sudden labor, nor harming their nature with service. \"Governing the state\" means prioritizing agriculture and valuing grain, simplifying affairs to avoid vexation—then the people live in peace, transformed without words. This is \"without contrivance\"—can one do this?\n\n**\"The heavenly gate opens and closes—can one act as the female?\"**\n*Commentary:* To become a ruler, one must receive the mandate of succession—this \"heavenly gate\" is where the imperial mandate emerges. \"Opening\" means receiving the mandate; \"closing\" means being deposed. Heaven bestows its precious mandate to bless the virtuous. If one can guard feminine softness, one may enjoy supreme fortune. Thus, it says: \"Can one act as the female?\"\n\nAnother explanation: The *Book of Changes* says: \"Opening and closing are called change.\" This means the sage establishes teachings, responding to change without constancy, not relying on masculine strength but guarding the feminine and yielding—just as the heavenly gate opens and closes, diminishing the full and benefiting the humble.\n\n**\"Understanding clearly in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"**\n*Commentary:* Once the ruler receives the mandate and governs all under heaven, if one can guard feminine stillness, one’s virtue becomes clear, shining like the sun in all four directions. One’s power extends to all things without claiming it as one’s own—this is called forgetting merit as if without knowledge. Thus, it says: \"Can one be without knowledge?\"\n\n**\"Giving life and nourishing.\"**\n*Commentary:* The later text says: \"The Dao gives life; virtue nourishes.\" Here, \"giving life and nourishing\" means that when the ruler models the Dao’s clarity and stillness, all things attain their natural growth. Emulating virtue’s vast aid, all things fulfill their nourishment. Thus, it says: \"giving life and nourishing.\"\n\n**\"Giving life without possessing, acting without relying, leading without dominating—this is called mysterious virtue.\"**\n*Commentary:* When things attain their natural growth, the sage forgets merit and use. When growth is attained, the principle of life is self-sufficient; when merit is forgotten, its use remains whole. This is achieving the private through the public, becoming the true ruler without dominating. Thus, \"giving life without possessing\" means allowing all things to attain their growth, without the ruler claiming them as his own. \"Acting without relying\" means allowing all things to fulfill their functions without boasting of one’s own merit. \"Leading without dominating\" means standing above the myriad people—thus called \"leading\"—yet not relying on merit, thus called \"without dominating.\" Such is called profound and mysterious virtue.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Scroll One, concludes.**\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Scroll Two begins.**\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\n\nThe previous chapter expounded on nurturing the spirit and cherishing qi without admixture to avoid flaws; this chapter reveals how the beneficial and the useful, the existent and the nonexistent, mutually support one another to establish merit. Thus, Heaven and Earth embody the profound subtlety of the Great Simplicity, while shafts and wheels manifest the substance of nonbeing. Taking the vehicle as a metaphor, it illustrates the utility of existence to complete its meaning.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub; it is in their \"nothingness\" that the use of the cart lies.\n**Commentary:** Thirty spokes converge upon a single hub, showing how the few are mastered by the many. Only when the hub is empty and void does the cart’s function of movement arise. This clarifies how nonexistence benefits existence.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is the utterly nonexistent, the supremely One. Thus it can stir and animate all things, pervade and sustain all materials, allowing the ten thousand differences to be distinct yet formed by a single image, the myriad apertures to operate in concert yet sounded by a single resonance. Therefore, the origins of all movement and utility in the world, the foundations of all generation and completion, have never departed from the supremely One.\n\nConsider the cart and its wheels: the shafts and wheels exist, while the space within the cart is empty and void. Only when the cart’s interior is empty and void can it be put to use. If the shafts and wheels did not exist, the utility of the empty void would cease. If the cart’s interior were not empty and void, the shafts and wheels would all become useless objects.\n\nThus, when Heaven and Earth take their places, the efficacy of the *Yi* becomes manifest; when the myriad transformations flow and move, the function of the Dao is revealed. Therefore, by borrowing the utility of coarse existence and nonexistence, it clarifies how the utmost nonexistence benefits existence.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel; it is in its \"nothingness\" that the use of the vessel lies.\n**Commentary:** *Shan* means to blend; *zhi* is sticky clay. The note refers to the potter, as the *Book of Documents* states: \"To mold earth is called *tao* (pottery).\" The craftsman blends and shapes the clay, firing it into a vessel, which also relies on its hollow emptiness to serve as a receptacle.\n\nCarve doors and windows to make a room; it is in their \"nothingness\" that the use of the room lies.\n**Commentary:** *Zao* means to bore. Doors and side windows are called *you*. In ancient times, people dwelled in caves, as the *Odes* says: \"They dug and piled, dug and hollowed,\" referring to excavating the earth from the cave to cover its top, hence called *zao*. Later sages replaced these with palaces and chambers, utilizing the empty space within for human habitation. *Zhuangzi* says: \"If a room had no empty space, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would quarrel over the path,\" meaning they would contend for passage. The *Erya* states: \"A palace is called a room.\"\n\nThus, existence is for the sake of benefit, while nonexistence is for the sake of use.\n**Commentary:** The benefit of existence lies in its utility, and utility necessarily relies on nonexistence—hence existence takes nonexistence as its benefit. The use of nonexistence lies in its substance, and substance necessarily relies on existence—hence nonexistence takes existence as its benefit. The note says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel,\" a passage from the *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi*. From nonexistence, it is called the Dao; when it involves existence, it is called a vessel. To clarify the function of the Dao, one must rely on concrete vessels. Thus, it begins by borrowing metaphors from three transformations and ultimately seeks to apply nonexistence to a single principle.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nThe previous chapter revealed how the beneficial and the useful, the existent and the nonexistent, mutually support one another to establish merit; this chapter shows how indulging in sensory dusts and chasing after external realms leads to madness. It first presents colors and sounds to warn against harm to one’s proper nature, then discusses hunting to illustrate how pursuing desires scorches harmony. Finally, it concludes with the sage’s choices, demonstrating the essentials of preserving authenticity and safeguarding one’s nature.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the palate.\n**Commentary:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black; the five tones are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*; the five flavors are sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and pungent. *Shuang* means deviation. The eyes behold colors, the ears hear sounds, the mouth savors flavors—if one exceeds proper measure, harm cannot be avoided. Thus, one’s bodily faculties become deaf and blind, and the palate loses its sense of taste. Moreover, if one becomes infatuated with worldly sounds, colors, and other phenomena without awakening to their empty nature, not only will the bodily faculties become deaf and blind, but one’s wisdom will also be deaf and blind.\n\nChasing and hunting stir the heart to madness.\n**Commentary:** This refers to those who indulge in sounds and cling to colors, their desires racing like one who hunts, seeking only to kill and capture. As desire surges and chases after external realms, observing it calmly reveals it to be a heart driven to madness.\n\nRare and precious goods hinder conduct.\n**Commentary:** Rare and precious goods refer to the body’s vessels as commodities. What is meant by \"rare and precious goods\" are things beyond one’s inherent nature, which cannot be obtained through seeking. If one does not rest in one’s original nature but distorts it to seek falsely, deviating from naturalness, one’s conduct in the Dao will be hindered.\n\nThus, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\n**Commentary:** The belly receives without discrimination; the eyes, deluded by sights, cling to sensory dusts. Without discrimination, harmony is preserved—hence the sage acts for it. Clinging to sensory dusts harms one’s nature—hence the sage does not act for the eyes. Therefore, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**\nThe previous chapter showed how indulging in sensory dusts and chasing external realms leads to madness; this chapter reveals how favor and disgrace cause alarm and how valuing the body leads to suffering. It begins with two sentences stating the theme to raise a question, then uses ten sentences to explain the principle in response, and concludes with four sentences on valuing and cherishing without arrogance, employing metaphors to complete its meaning.\n\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm.\n**Commentary:** *Ruo* means \"like.\" It states that the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar. When one grasps it, it is favor; when one lets go, it is disgrace. It speaks of those who cannot equalize their hearts regarding honor and disgrace, who boast and pursue fame and power. When they hold authority, they take it as glory; when they lose power, they lament their lowly disgrace. Glory leads to arrogance, while disgrace brings alarm and sighs. Thus, it presents this warning to make them treat favor and disgrace as equal.\n\nValue great suffering as you do the body.\n**Commentary:** *Gui* means to esteem or value. *Ruo* also means \"like.\" The body is the source of calamity. Indulging in sounds and colors, competing for glory and splendor—all arise from having a body, which becomes the root of suffering.\n\nThose who esteem their bodies—how do they differ from those who esteem great suffering? Since the body itself is suffering, there is no distinction between them. One cannot be free from suffering precisely because one has a body. Thus, esteeming the body is no different from esteeming great suffering. If one could be free from suffering, one would also be free from the body. From this, we know that suffering arises from esteem, and the body arises from suffering. Hence, it is said: *Value great suffering as you do the body.*\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"?\nFavor is inferior.\n**Commentary:** Earlier, it was stated that \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar,\" but lest one fail to understand, a question is posed: *What is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"?* The answer follows: *Favor is inferior.* The reason favor is inferior is this: those who rely on favor become arrogant, and arrogance breeds misfortune. When misfortune arises from favor, favor becomes the root of disgrace. Thus, we know favor is inferior.\n\nTo gain it is alarming; to lose it is alarming—this is what is meant by \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar.\"\n**Commentary:** To gain it is favor; to lose it is disgrace. That both are alarming shows that favor and disgrace are cyclical, and favor is the root of disgrace. Worldly beings rejoice when they gain favor and tremble when they suffer disgrace. Thus, the sage warns them: fortune and misfortune are cyclical, like intertwined threads. Since favor and disgrace are unstable, how can one be alarmed by only one? When disgrace comes, one is alarmed by misfortune; when favor arrives, one is alarmed by arrogance. The alarm is the same in both cases. Hence, it is said: *this is what is meant by \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by \"value great suffering as you do the body\"?\n**Commentary:** Lest one fail to understand, a question is posed to clarify.\nThe reason I have great suffering is that I have a body.\n**Commentary:** The reason I have great suffering is that I cling to the form of the body, delighting in honor and loathing disgrace, distinguishing right from wrong. When I do not obtain what I desire, I am filled with great sorrow and fear. My spirit is inwardly exhausted by greed, and my form is outwardly worn by striving. Weary and toiling—what is this if not suffering?\n\nBut if I were without a body, what suffering would I have?\n**Commentary:** \"Without a body\" means realizing that the form of the body is illusory and fundamentally unreal. One should then sit in forgetfulness, abandoning perception and dulling the senses, merging with the boundless Dao where there is no master, and equaling the \"entrusted harmony\" that is not the self. Naturally, the paths of honor and disgrace vanish, and the hearts of love and aversion cease. This is what is called \"the Great Release.\" What concern would one then have for great suffering?\n\nThus, it is said: *But if I were without a body, what suffering would I have?*\nThe commentary states: *Entrusted harmony*—in the *Zhuangzi*, Ch’eng responds to Shun: \"The body is not yours; it is the entrusted harmony of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nTherefore, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their body as the world may be confided with the world.\n**Commentary:** If a ruler esteems their body as lord of the world, valuing the self leads to domineering others, and thus others will not follow. Such a ruler may only be *entrusted* with the world temporarily. But if a ruler cherishes their body as lord of the world, loving the self leads to compassion for others, and thus the people will gladly elevate them. Such a ruler may be *confided* with the world, remaining its lord for long.\n\nNow, this chapter begins by speaking of the alarm caused by favor and disgrace and concludes with entrustment and confiding. It aims to show that being alarmed by favor and disgrace is not as good as forgetting favor and disgrace; esteeming and cherishing are not as good as forgetting esteem and cherish; being entrusted with the world is not as good as forgetting the world. Thus, it is said: *The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body.* If one is alarmed by favor and disgrace but has not yet forgotten the distinction between self and others, then a hundred concerns converge into one. If one clings to what one has, then ten thousand differences contend for supremacy. Therefore, forgetting favor and disgrace means there is nothing left to alarm; forgetting the body means there is no root of suffering; forgetting the world means there is no trace of entrustment. Only then can there be a ruler of the highest order above and ministers of the lowest knowledge below. There is non-action, yet nothing is left undone; there is no virtue, yet virtue is possessed.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: \"Look at It and It Cannot Be Seen\"**\nThe previous chapter clarified that valuing the body is suffering and urged forgetting both. This chapter clarifies that the wondrous root has no form, and thus in application, all is pervaded. The first three lines speak of the impossibility of seeking it in sound and color; the next six lines show that any inquiry must return to nothingness; the following five lines demonstrate the unfathomable functioning of the wondrous; and the final four lines conclude by citing the ancients to confirm the present.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—it is called *yí*.\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called *xī*.\nGrasp at it and it cannot be held—it is called *wēi*.\n**Commentary:** This speaks of the Dao. Those who look at it seek the Dao in color; those who listen to it seek the Dao in sound; those who grasp at it seek the Dao in form. The Dao is not a matter of color, sound, or form, so seeking it is ultimately futile. Because it cannot be obtained, one might call it nothing. Yet within this nothingness of color, it responds to all colors; within this nothingness of sound, it harmonizes with all sounds; within this nothingness of form, it shapes all forms. It is the color of no-color, the sound of no-sound, the form of no-form. Thus, it is called *xī*, *wēi*, and *yí*. *Xī*, *wēi*, and *yí* describe the luminous Dao but are not the Dao itself.\n*Yí* means level and easy.\n*Xī* refers to the subtlety of sound.\n*Bó* means to grasp or hold.\nThese three cannot be inquired into, so they are blended into one.\n**Commentary:** The three are *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi*. *Zhì* means to obtain; *jié* means to inquire. *Hùn* means to merge. The wondrous root is subtle and unified, defying description in terms of color, sound, or form. How can one inquire into it? If one attempts to inquire using color, sound, or form, one only obtains *xī* and *wēi*. These three are provisional names meant to clarify the functioning of the Dao. Since the Dao is not color, sound, or form, they merge into one.\n\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dark.\n**Commentary:** *Jiǎo* means bright; *mèi* means dark. Tangible things all have fixed directions: above is bright, and below is dark. But the wondrous root is indistinct and cannot be named. Thus, above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Yet it can be above or below, bright or dark. If it is not the most profound in the world, who could attain this?\n\nCeaseless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness.\n**Commentary:** *Shéngshéng* suggests ceaseless movement. The wondrous root moves without end, yet it cannot be named. Thus, it returns to nothingness.\n\nThe wondrous root gives rise to transformation, its movement endless. The power of generating beings cannot be forced into names. It creates all things yet is not a thing; it engenders life yet is not life. When pursued, the wondrous root remains serene—never has there been any thing. Thus it is said to return to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless—this is called *hūhuǎng*.\n**Commentary:** *Zhuàng* means form; *xiàng* means image. The wondrous root is primordially undifferentiated, fundamentally without shape or substance. Yet the ten thousand transformations rely upon it for sustenance, and the manifold beings flow into form. This may be called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. It cannot be named as being, nor can it be fixed as non-being. Difficult to name as either, it is thus called *hūhuǎng*.\n\nWe meet it yet do not see its head; we follow it yet do not see its rear.\n**Commentary:** The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed. Thus, those who meet it do not see its head, and those who follow it do not see its rear. Without a head, there is no beginning; without a rear, there is no end. Without beginning or end, it cannot be grasped by meeting or following.\n\nHold to the Dao of old to steer the being of today.\n**Commentary:** This shows how the ancient sage-kings always used non-action as the Dao to transform and guide the people. Thus, it admonishes those of today: if they can hold fast to the ancient practice of the teaching of non-action to govern the affairs of today’s being, then transformation will occur without words.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** The previous line spoke of holding to the Dao of old to guide action. This line speaks of knowing the ancient beginning, clarifying that the practice of the Dao must lead to transformation. Thus, it reiterates: if the sage-kings can know the ancient beginning and govern through non-action, they should embrace simplicity, cherishing purity and tranquility. This is to know the principle of non-action—this is the discipline of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Those Skilled in the Way of Old**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the wondrous root, being without image, functions universally in all applications. This chapter shows how those who penetrate the mysterious do not become full but can embrace decay.\n\nThe opening five lines on “those skilled in the Way of old” reveal the subtlety of their skill. The next seven lines, beginning with “cautious as if,” illustrate the difficulty of discerning their virtuous bearing. The two lines “Who can...” express the gradual arising of cultivation. The closing lines, beginning with “Preserving this Way,” conclude by affirming achievement without stagnation.\n\nThose skilled in the Way of old were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, too deep to be known.\n**Commentary:** *Gǔ* means “of old”; *shì* means “to serve.” It speaks of those in ancient times who were skilled in serving through the Dao: their essence was exquisitely refined, their spirit profoundly still and penetrating. Embodied in the Dao, their words dissolved without obstruction. Yet their capacity was so vast and deep that it could not be known.\n\nPrecisely because they could not be known, one was forced to describe their bearing:\n**Commentary:** Though those skilled in the Way could manifest their true bearing to awaken others, their boundless brilliance shone like the light of heaven, and their virtue was too profound to fathom. Thus, one was forced to describe their bearing, seeking traces of compliance to guide and transform the common and foolish.\n\nCautious, as if crossing a river in winter;\n**Commentary:** *Yù* means “leisurely caution.” *Ruò* means “like.” The river symbolizes the worldly realm of love and desire, which drowns sentient beings. Though those skilled in the Way dwelled in the world, they were not stained by love and desire, like one crossing a river in winter—thus they were full of leisurely caution. The reason for caution in winter crossings is that the ice is thick and strong, with no fear of sinking.\n\nHesitant, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\n**Commentary:** *Yóu* means “doubt” or “difficulty.” Those skilled in the Way, being free of love and desire, were full of leisurely caution. Yet when observing their actions, movements, and conduct, they feared misalignment with the Dao and thus remained hesitant. Like one today who, when handling affairs, fears the neighbors’ knowledge and becomes vigilant.\n\nSolemn, as if a guest;\n**Commentary:** Those skilled in the Way made no contrivances regarding love and desire, like a guest before a host—solemn and respectful. Yet in their virtuous conduct, they were not rigidly attached to things, flowing like ice melting in spring, without obstruction.\n\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\n**Commentary:** *Dūn* means “thick” or “sincere”; *pǔ* means “uncarved.” Though not rigidly attached to things, they were free of frivolous competition. Their virtue was sincere and thick, like uncarved wood, without distinction.\n\nVast, as if a valley;\n**Commentary:** *Kuàng* means “spacious.” Those skilled in the Way embraced the Dao and held virtue; their capacity was vast and wide. Toward all things, they could contain and receive, like an empty valley that holds everything.\n\nTurbid, as if muddy.\n**Commentary:** Those skilled in the Way, though their minds were luminously clear, could embrace all things, blending with the dust of the world without distinguishing themselves. They were indistinct, like muddy water, so that none could know them.\n\nWho can still the turbid to gradually clarify it?\n**Commentary:** Following the previous line’s “as if muddy,” it takes the settling of water as an analogy for the mind of those skilled in the Way, which, being unstained, naturally becomes still. Who can, amid the turbid love and desires of the world, use the clarity of the Dao-nature to still them, preventing the arising of desires—just as muddy water, when stilled, gradually clarifies? *Shú* means “who.”\n\nWho can remain at rest to gradually bring forth life?\n**Commentary:** This teaches non-attachment to dharmas. Who can use the clarity of the Dao-nature to still love and desire, like the nature of water? Having achieved gradual clarity, if one then remains fixed in this clarity, stagnating, that is not awakening—it is not yet liberation. One must seek further excellence, advancing in cultivation. As the Dao is diminished again and again, and practice proceeds step by step, the clarity of the Dao-nature does not stagnate in dharmas but gradually stirs and emerges. *Shēng* means “to emerge.”\n\nThose who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.\n**Commentary:** Stagnating in dharmas and resting in clarity is called fullness. Thus, if one wishes to preserve this Way of gradual clarity and gradual emergence, one must remain unstained, attaining without attachment. To stagnate in clarity and seek emergence is to harm fullness and obstruct the practice of the Way—thus, “do not desire.”\n\nOnly by not desiring fullness can one remain worn yet not newly completed.\n**Commentary:** To be without stagnation, attaining non-action, and abiding nowhere in dharmas—this is not to be full. One constantly regards newly realized dharmas as worn and thin, ever seeking superior dharmas, never clinging to them as newly completed. To do so would be to stagnate.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost in Emptiness**\nThe preceding chapter showed how those who penetrate the mysterious preserve the Dao without desiring fullness; this chapter reveals how those who guard stillness must return to the root and restore the mandate. Restoring the mandate is the essence of knowing the constant; guarding stillness is the path to attaining emptiness. The text unfolds in sequence, demonstrating that both principles converge in the function of the Dao. Thus, to know the constant is to be enlightened; to practice the Dao is to endure.\n\nAttain the utmost in emptiness; guard stillness with sincerity.\n**Commentary:** The \"utmost in emptiness\" is the wondrous origin. All beings receive life by endowing this emptiness, the utmost in the wondrous origin—this is called true nature. Yet after receiving form, the six senses become entangled in love and desire, the five desires run rampant, true nature scatters, and the wondrous origin is lost. To ensure that the wondrous origin of utmost emptiness is necessarily attained within oneself, one must guard this feminine stillness, thicken the sincerity of one’s nature, sever desires, embrace non-action, and remain unwearied by narrowness. Then the wondrous origin of utmost emptiness will naturally be attained—just as water flows toward the moist and fire tends toward the dry. \"Attain\" means to ensure its inevitable arrival, akin to the meaning of *zhi* in \"summoning the army\" in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nThe myriad things arise together; I thereby observe their return.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the meaning of guarding stillness with sincerity to attain the utmost in emptiness. Though the myriad things and forms move and act differently, when one observes their return, they always revert to their root. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu* (Return).\" *Fu* means to revert to the root. Thus, stillness leads to return, while movement causes one to lose the root.\n\nThe teeming things, each returns to its root.\n**Commentary:** This illustrates the meaning of observing return through analogy. The root is the qi one receives at birth. Now, observing the myriad things—flowers and leaves flourishing—when their nature is spent, they all return to their root to regenerate. The wondrous origin of utmost emptiness is what humans receive at birth. Observing the bustle of emotions and desires, if one can guard stillness and attain emptiness, true nature will return to the primordial mandate and endure.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the mandate.\n**Commentary:** When things return to the root, they become tranquil; when humans guard stillness, they attain emptiness. Trees receive life from the root; returning to the root restores the mandate. Humans receive life from the wondrous origin; if one can guard stillness and attain emptiness, this is called returning to restore the nature and mandate one was endowed with.\n\nRestoring the mandate is called the constant; knowing the constant is called illumination.\nNot knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune.\n**Commentary:** By guarding feminine stillness with sincerity to attain the utmost emptiness of the wondrous origin, attaining emptiness restores the mandate—this is called obtaining the constant. To know and guard the constant is called illumination. Losing the constant and acting recklessly is called impermanence. Without constancy in virtue, one will surely meet with extreme misfortune. The note reads: \"Not constant in virtue, or bearing shame,\" citing the *Heng* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*.\n\nKnowing the constant brings capacity;\n**Commentary:** Knowing the constant is illumination; illumination enables one to reflect all things. As things arise, one responds without fail, containing all—thus, \"knowing the constant brings capacity.\"\n\nCapacity brings impartiality; impartiality brings kingship;\n**Commentary:** To contain and respond to all things is impartiality, free from selfishness. Without selfishness, the world turns toward one—this is called kingship.\n\nKingship brings heaven; heaven brings the Dao;\n**Commentary:** Only heaven is great, and the king models himself upon it. His virtue mirrors heaven, covering all—thus, \"kingship brings heaven.\" With the king’s virtue like heaven, non-action governs, and the transformative power of the Dao flows—thus, \"heaven brings the Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao brings enduring; to the end of one’s days, no peril.\n**Commentary:** To govern with stillness and attain emptiness, returning to the root and restoring the mandate—with such virtue, one may become a king. The king’s virtue aligns with heaven, and by enacting the Dao, the Dao endures, bestowing lasting fortune. The people turn to him as to the sun, revere him as heaven, cherish him as rain, and long for him as spring. Thus, to the end of his days, what peril could there be? Hence, \"to the end of one’s days, no peril.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme One, Those Below Know of His Existence**\nThis chapter first discusses the customs of pristine antiquity, then descends to the decadence of later ages, seeking to clarify the gradual loss of the Dao and trace the origins of corruption. The preceding chapter showed that guarding stillness attains emptiness; this chapter demonstrates that non-action restores simplicity. When simplicity scatters, favor and praise arise; with non-action, one speaks of the self as natural. May the rulers who transform through the Dao devote themselves to this wordless teaching.\n\nThe supreme one—those below know of his existence.\n**Commentary:** The \"supreme one\" refers to the rulers of pristine antiquity. To call them \"supreme\" is to honor them. Such rulers engaged in non-action and practiced wordless teaching. Their ministers merely knew there was a ruler above, revering him as heaven—vast and above, bestowing the beauty of the four seasons’ growth. Yet they knew not how to praise his virtue—hence, \"those below know of his existence.\"\n\nThe next, they draw near and praise.\n**Commentary:** After the passing of the supreme rulers, the Yellow Emperor and the sages Yao and Shun arose, enacting teachings and practicing goodness, extending benevolence to the people—thus, they drew near. Their gentleness and weakness brought balance, their achievements towered over the world—thus, they were praised. Yet the traces of their favor and praise in life became the afflictions of later generations. Thus, *Zhuangzi* said: \"I tell you! The root of great disorder must lie between Yao and Shun.\" Why? Because their traces endured for a thousand generations thereafter.\n\nNext, they fear and scorn him.\n**Commentary:** After the passing of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, the age descended to the Three Kings and Five Hegemons, gradually declining into harshness. With severe punishments and oppressive systems, the people feared them. Yet rulers could not discern clearly, so the people scorned them. Below, subjects debated crimes to seek merit; above, rulers rewarded treachery and bred deceit. Such mutual deception chills the heart.\n\n\"Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains the fear of rulers. The people fear the sovereign’s laws and scorn his teachings because the ruler’s trust in them is insufficient—thus, the people become untrustworthy.\n\n\"Yet they value his words.\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains drawing near and praising. The people draw near to the ruler’s virtuous conduct and praise his achievements because the ruler’s teachings possess power—thus, they value his words and extol them. (Note: In ancient texts, *gu* 古 is interchangeable with *you* 由.)\n\n\"When deeds are accomplished and affairs succeed, the people all say, ‘We are naturally thus.’\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains the \"supreme rulers\" and \"those below know of his existence.\" When simplicity remains unharmed, who would craft ritual vessels? When the Dao and virtue are universally practiced, where would praise and nearness be established? Thus, in the age of the supreme rulers, the people forgot the emperor’s power. Only when deeds were accomplished and affairs succeeded did they all say it was naturally so, unaware of why they should draw near, praise, or repay him.\n\n**Chapter 18: The Decay of the Great Dao**\nThe previous chapter clarified the progression of eras, showing how the Dao endured when simplicity remained intact. This chapter reveals how customs decay when the Dao is lost, and benevolence and righteousness arise. Shaving one’s head and seeking a physician—though it may bring recovery, counting grains while cooking and combing one’s hair—how it harms one’s nature! Thus, these eight lines are presented to expose the extreme of decay, hoping to return to ancient simplicity.\n\n\"When the Great Dao decays, there is benevolence and righteousness.\"\n**Commentary:** The decay of the Great Dao refers to an age of shallow customs, where people vie in vanity. The wind of serene harmony vanishes, and the transformative influence of pure clarity is lost. The affairs of the perfect Dao and non-action are abandoned—hence, it is called decay. With decay, there arises benevolence of universal love and righteousness that curbs wrongdoing, leaving one to tread cautiously between them. Thus, *Zhuangzi* said: \"The Dao is hidden in petty achievements.\" Petty achievements refer to benevolence and righteousness, each self-contained and unable to achieve great unity—hence, they are called petty.\n\n\"When wisdom and cleverness emerge, there is great deceit.\"\n**Commentary:** The emergence of wisdom and cleverness refers to later generations using intellect to establish laws to regulate customs and create statutes to expose treachery. Fearing disbelief, they made seals to authenticate. Fearing inequity, they crafted measures and scales. Yet the unscrupulous stole the seals and pilfered the measures, so the laws created by wisdom only amplified their deceit—hence, there is great deceit.\n\n\"When the six relations are not in harmony, there is filial piety and compassion.\"\n**Commentary:** The six relations are father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. In an age of great unity, there is no private kinship. But when superiors and inferiors are discordant, resentment and favor arise, leading to acts like fanning pillows and warming mats—called filial. Going out and returning with concern—called compassion. Bearing the names of compassion and filial piety, they display self-satisfaction, unaware that in the age of the Great Dao, the world was one family. Superiors inherited and inferiors were pacified by natural duty. Seeing others as oneself, one did not exclusively love one’s own kin—thus, all in the world could be filial. Others saw one as themselves, not exclusively cherishing their own children—thus, all in the world could be compassionate. Then where would the names of filial piety and compassion be applied?\n\n\"When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\"\n**Commentary:** Loyalty is the duty of a minister—why then speak of \"loyal ministers\"? Because the ruler loses the way of governing ministers, allowing flatterers to advance. They draw near to benighted rulers, breeding disaster and chaos. Then some face danger and give their lives, enduring hardship to rectify the state—earning the name of loyal ministers. But when the transformative influence of the Dao prevails, in non-action and purity, the sage-king’s many officers are all like Kui and Long. The constant norms are in order, none failing in their duties. Then the names of loyalty and filial piety cease, and the Dao of simplicity flourishes—what need is there for loyal ministers or filial sons? These four are the extreme of decay—how could one not return to simplicity?\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Volume Two Concluded*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Volume Three*\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Cutting Off Sagacity**\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed the decay of customs and the loss of the Dao, where benevolence and righteousness then flourished. This chapter clarifies that by cutting off the many paths and returning to simplicity, thieves and bandits will cease to exist. The first six lines set aside the traces of self-importance and compliance; the next three lines will elucidate the method of establishing teaching; the final four lines demonstrate the course of practice.\n\n**Cut off sagacity, abandon knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.**\n*Commentary:* Sagacity refers to the sagacity of contrived creation. Knowledge refers to the mundane knowledge of self-importance and compliance. The sagacity of creation leaves traces, while the knowledge of self-importance is not true. Losing truth gives rise to artifice and deceit; pursuing traces causes one to lose the root. Thus, both are cut off and abandoned to restore simplicity. When the harmony of Heaven flows unimpeded and self-importance ceases, the people gain a hundredfold benefit.\n\n**Cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.**\n*Commentary:* The preceding chapter stated that when the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness. Here, it says that by cutting off benevolence and abandoning righteousness, the people return to filial piety and kindness. This clarifies that in the age of the great Dao—what is called \"mysterious sameness\"—the people have no private attachments and are all naturally kind and filial. Thus, when principle is perfected, traces vanish; when affairs are proper, names depart. Now, with the Six Relations in decay, the names of filial piety and kindness become prominent. If one cuts off the benevolence of universal love and abandons the righteousness of judging right and wrong, then rivers and lakes will have no forced assistance, and kindness and filial piety will possess their natural essence. Thus, the people return to great filial piety and kindness.\n\n**Cut off skill, abandon profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist.**\n*Commentary:* Cutting off skill means eliminating excessive and unlawful craftsmanship. Abandoning profit means forsaking the pursuit of wealth, monopolies, and illicit gains. Thieves and bandits arise from insatiable desire. If skill is cut off, people will not contend; if profit is abandoned, people will be content. Who, then, would become a thief or bandit? Thus, it is said they will cease to exist.\n\nThese three are insufficient as text, so they are made to belong to something else.\n*Commentary:* The three are: first, cutting off sagacity and abandoning knowledge; second, cutting off benevolence and abandoning righteousness; third, cutting off skill and abandoning profit. These three are merely to be cut off and abandoned, without yet involving cultivation. Thus, as text, they are insufficient to convey teaching. They are made to belong to what follows—namely, \"seeing the plain\" and so on.\n\n**See the plain, embrace the uncarved, lessen selfishness, reduce desire.**\n*Commentary:* To seek to cut off sagacity and abandon knowledge, one must constantly see the true and plain. To seek to cut off benevolence and abandon righteousness, one must embrace simplicity and plainness. To seek to cut off skill and abandon profit, one must lessen selfishness and reduce desire. Though the three cuttings may be insufficient in text, in practice they are more than enough for self-cultivation. To prohibit and cut off from the center, one must draw upon inner conduct.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Cutting Off Learning Brings No Sorrow**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that by cutting off the many paths and returning to simplicity, thieves and bandits will cease to exist. This chapter reveals that one must fear and remove worldly learning as if in darkness, thus standing alone and apart from others. The first line marks the path to be cut off; the next seven lines present analogies to clarify the principle; the following seventeen lines distinguish the ordinary and the sagely in debate; the final two lines discuss solitary practice to conclude.\n\n**Cut off learning, and there will be no sorrow.**\n*Commentary:* Cutting off learning means cutting off worldly, contrived learning. All people, at birth, possess true simplicity. To exceed one’s lot in seeking learning harms one’s nature and brings much trouble. If one were to cut off all learning entirely, things would have no cultivation. Here, it is clarified that one cuts off only excessive, contrived learning—what *Zhuangzi* calls \"worldly learning that seeks to return to the beginning.\" As for learning within one’s lot, following one’s nature in practice, the superior person diligently cultivates it, and it is not to be cut off. Thus, it is said, \"Cut off learning, and there will be no sorrow.\"\n\n**How far apart are \"yes\" and \"ah\"? How distant are good and evil?**\n*Commentary:* \"Yes\" is a respectful response. The *Rites of Zhou* states: \"When the teacher summons, do not say 'yes' but rise.\" \"Ah\" is a careless response. The *Book of Han* asks: \"Who is He?\"—meaning \"who is it?\" This presents an analogy. \"Yes\" and \"ah\" both come from the mouth: \"yes\" is respectful and thus good, while \"ah\" is careless and thus evil. Whether learning is cut off or not depends on the heart. Cutting it off brings no sorrow; not cutting it off gives rise to trouble. Since they come from the same mouth, it is said, \"How far apart?\" Since it depends on the heart, it is said, \"How distant?\" If one can understand that learning is no-learning, and that the appearances of learning are empty, forgetting knowledge in knowing, and not generating distinctions, then \"yes\" and \"ah\" become equal, and good and evil are both forgotten.\n\n**What people fear, one cannot but fear.**\n*Commentary:* What people fear are carelessness and evil. Carelessness leads to faults, and evil invites disdain. Being disdained, one is abandoned and slighted by others; having faults, things multiply blame and resentment. This is like worldly, contrived learning, which increases right and wrong. If one does not fear and cut it off, it all violates one’s lot and harms one’s nature. Thus, one cannot but fear and cut it off.\n\n**Vast and boundless, it has no end!**\n*Commentary:* Vast means decay. Carelessness and evil are faults; worldly learning loses truth—all are to be feared and thus cut off and abandoned. If one does not cut off and abandon them, then one’s true nature decays without end. The *Book of Songs* says: \"The night is not yet ended,\" meaning the night-watches are still many. Here, it says \"it has no end,\" meaning that worldly learning harms one’s nature without cease. Thus, the road ahead is long, and it is said to have no end.\n\n**The multitude delight and rejoice, as if feasting on the great sacrifice, as if ascending the spring terrace.**\n*Commentary:* \"Delight and rejoice\" describes the stirring of emotions and desires. This clarifies those who do not fear and cut off worldly learning. Worldly, contrived learning stirs emotions and desires. Delighting and rejoicing in pursuit of external things, they toil their whole lives—like a starving man at a great feast, indulging in rich flavors; like one gazing from the spring terrace, stirred to attachment. The great sacrifice consists of oxen, sheep, and pigs. The spring terrace is where attachment arises: its flourishing plants and trees, paired birds and singing creatures, the warm harmony of spring—all easily lead to indulgence. Thus, the *Bin Ode* says: \"The spring days are long; the white southernwood is gathered in abundance. My heart is sorrowful—would that I could go with the lord’s son!\"\n\nI alone remain fearful where no sign appears, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. The commentary states: Here, \"I\" refers to Lord Lao himself, who, in fearing and cutting off worldly learning, embraces the Dao and contains harmony. Alone, he remains serene and still, untouched by the contrived affairs of the world—emotions, desires, and the like—showing no trace or sign. Like an infant who cannot yet laugh, he is without discrimination. \"Smile\" here means to recognize others. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Not yet able to smile, who would begin with him?\"\n\nAdrift, adrift, as if with no place to return. The commentary states: \"Adrift, adrift\" describes movement. The multitude, stirred by movement, clings and grasps, ever seeking something to pursue, as if they have somewhere to go. But I, free of intent, remain serene and still—following the current as it flows, stopping where it pools. Like one who walks the Way, I have no fixed destination, no restless striving.\n\nAll others have more than enough, while I alone seem to lack. The commentary states: The multitude, entangled in worldly learning, boasts of their cunning and wisdom, clinging to all things as if they possess abundance. I alone diminish these, never stagnating, my heart free of attachment—thus I seem to have forgotten.\n\nIs my heart that of a fool? So pure, so pure! The commentary states: I, perceiving all things without attachment, seem to have forgotten—how could this be the heart of a fool? Yet my heart remains pure, unadorned, free of desire—hence it seems forgotten.\n\nThe common folk are bright and clear; I alone seem dim. The common folk are sharp and exacting; I alone am dull and vague. The commentary states: \"Bright and clear\" describes their self-importance and display of cunning. \"Dim\" means dull and without discrimination. \"Sharp and exacting\" refers to their establishment of teachings and laws to restrain others. \"Dull and vague\" describes a mind that is broad and unburdened. Their brightness and exactitude, their imposition of teachings, all stem from their failure to cut off worldly learning and contrivance. Thus the sage fears and cuts them off, remaining dim and silent.\n\nSwift as darkness, still as solitude—seeming without end. The commentary states: One who has cut off learning is swift and without intent, ever in a state of dimness, yet the heart remains still, never clinging. In all things, there is no attachment—hence it seems without end.\n\nAll others have their means; I alone am stubborn and coarse. The commentary states: The common folk, unafraid of worldly learning, remain entangled in their pursuits, never at rest. I alone, in this world, am without discrimination—like one crude and unrefined. \"Stubborn\" means without discrimination; \"coarse\" means base and insufficient. Yet my heart is truly awakened—hence I say \"seeming\" thus.\n\nFrom \"All others rejoice\" onward, all contrasts are made clear.\n\nI alone differ from others, yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother. The commentary states: These two lines conclude the passage. \"I alone differ from others\" means I differ from the common folk who do not cut off worldly learning—all the contrasts above show how I differ from them. The common folk cling to contrivance; I alone forget emotions and desires. The common folk discriminate among things; I alone see no right or wrong. Hence I differ from others. \"Yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother\" means Lord Lao admonishes people to preserve simplicity, maintain harmony, reduce selfishness, and limit desires—cutting off indulgence in sights and sounds, halting the pursuit of fame and reputation. Like an infant, one should seek only nourishment from the Mother. Thus it is said: \"Yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother.\"\n\n**Chapter 21: The Appearance of Great Virtue**\nThe previous chapter showed how fearing and cutting off worldly learning leaves one dim, thus differing from others. This chapter reveals that following the true and perfect Dao enables one to encompass all beginnings. The opening two lines on \"great virtue\" illustrate the virtuous person’s compliance with the Dao. The following ten lines, from \"The Dao as a thing,\" unfold the essence of the One’s mystery. The five lines from \"From ancient times\" distinguish the names of its functions and conclude with the virtue of generation and completion.\n\nThe appearance of great virtue: only the Dao is followed. The commentary states: \"Great\" means utmost; \"follow\" means compliance; \"appearance\" means form and state. To clarify how the practitioner complies with the perfect Dao, it asks: What is the form and state of one of utmost virtue? It answers: The form and state of one of utmost virtue is to follow only the Dao of emptiness and extremity.\n\nThe Dao as a thing is only vague, only indistinct. The commentary states: This describes the form of the empty and extreme mystery as a thing—the Dao that great virtue follows. The empty and extreme mystery, forcibly named the Dao, as a thing—what is its movement and form? This mystery is neither being nor non-being, difficult to name. If called being, it is still and without image; if called non-being, it seems to abide like depth. Without being or non-being, it is hard to name—hence it is called vague and indistinct.\n\nIndistinct, oh! Vague, oh! Within it there are images. The commentary states: This clarifies the traces of its descending generation. \"Indistinct\" means non-being; \"vague\" means being. \"Images\" are signs of manifestation. The mystery is without thing—hence it is called indistinct. Generation and transformation take form—hence it is called vague. Thus, from non-being it descends into being; within it, signs of all things appear—from the root it descends into traces.\n\nVague, oh! Indistinct, oh! Within it there are things. The commentary states: \"Things\" here refer to the Dao as a thing, meaning the mystery itself. The mystery descends into generation, manifesting all images. Cultivating nature and returning to virtue, one reverts to non-thing. Non-thing is the Dao. It says that in cultivating nature and returning to virtue, one does not depart from the mystery—from being one returns to non-being, merging again with the perfect Dao. Hence it says \"within it there are things,\" meaning there is the wondrous thing. This gathers the traces to return to the root.\n\nDark, oh! Obscure, oh! Within it there is essence. The commentary states: \"Dark and obscure\" mean deep and hidden. From the empty extreme it descends into generation; from cultivating nature it returns to the root. Gathering the traces to return to the root, the wondrous thing may abide—dark and obscure, unfathomable, containing transformation. Within it lies the utmost essence—hence it says \"within it there is essence.\"\n\nIts essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity. The commentary states: The wondrous thing of the perfect Dao, being fundamentally free of falsity, transforms with utmost essence—hence its essence is utterly real.\n\nThe power of generation and completion pervades all beings; when things move, it responds without the slightest deviation—hence it says \"within it there is sincerity.\" From antiquity to the present, its name does not depart, for it surveys the origins of the multitude.\n\nThe commentary states: *Survey* means to measure and observe. *Origins* means the fundamental beginnings. The power of generation and completion of the Dao and virtue, the sincerity of the dark and obscure true essence, remains boundless from beginning to end, unchanging from ancient times to the present. Thus, the names of things that attain the Dao’s function—such as the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth—persist from antiquity to the present without departing. Hence the annotation says: Since the function of generation and completion is the same in past and present, the names of its responses remain unchanged through the ages. With this essence of utmost sincerity, it surveys the fundamental beginnings of the myriad things, allowing each to fulfill its function of generation and completion.\n\nHow do I know the origins of the multitude are thus? By this.\n\nThe commentary states: It further explains: How do I know that the fundamental beginnings of the myriad things all receive from the Dao, and that the Dao must survey them to enable their functions of generation and completion? The answer is: By this utmost essence and sincerity, for all things in the present receive their generation and completion—hence we know this to be so.\n\n**Chapter 22: \"That Which Is Crooked Shall Be Made Whole\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that following the perfect Dao to its utmost sincerity enables one to survey the origins of the multitude. This chapter explains that embracing the One as a model and refraining from contention exemplifies the six phrases of \"crooked yet whole,\" demonstrating the conduct of wholeness. The following two phrases mark the sagely practice, while the subsequent four phrases further elucidate the meaning of \"crooked yet whole\" down to \"worn yet renewed.\" The concluding phrase affirms that only by non-contention can one attain wholeness and return to the root.\n\nThat which is crooked shall be made whole.\nThe commentary states: *Crooked* means to yield and follow. If one can yield and follow without resisting things, one may preserve one’s wholeness—hence it says \"that which is crooked shall be made whole.\"\n\nThat which is bent shall be made straight.\nThe commentary states: *Bent* means to endure humiliation from things. *Straight* means to correct what is crooked. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"To correct the crooked is to make it straight.\" Though one does not resist things, if things come to bend one, and one can endure the humiliation, the other will surely feel shame and amend themselves. Thus, one’s straightness can correct the crooked—hence it says \"that which is bent shall be made straight.\"\n\nThat which is hollow shall be filled.\nThe commentary states: *Hollow* means low and sunken. *Filled* means full. This is a metaphorical explanation. Just as the earth aids what is low, causing water to flow and fill it, so too does one who maintains humility find their virtue growing ever greater. To be crooked and bent is to be low and sunken; to be whole and straight is to be full and abundant—hence it says \"that which is hollow shall be filled.\"\n\nThat which is worn shall be renewed.\nThe commentary states: *Worn* refers to what is humble and unrefined. Crookedness, bending, and hollowness all mean to humble oneself. By humbling oneself, others will defer to one, and thus one’s virtue and conduct will daily renew—hence it says \"that which is worn shall be renewed.\"\n\nThat which is little shall attain; that which is much shall be confounded.\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.\n\nThe commentary states: One who takes little for oneself will not lose, hence it says \"attain.\" One who gives much will provoke contention, hence it says \"confounded.\" This applies to cultivating the body and equally to cultivating the Dao: one must hold fast to simplicity and preserve one’s true nature. If one seeks widely among divergent paths, one invites disorder and confusion. Thus, the loss of the sheep is due to branching paths, and the ruin of life lies in pursuing many directions. Therefore, the sage embraces the One without deviation and may serve as the model for all under heaven. *Model* means standard.\n\nNot displaying oneself, thus one is luminous.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is crooked shall be made whole.\" If one does not display one’s own excellence but instead yields to things, one’s wholeness in virtue becomes ever more luminous—hence it says \"thus one is luminous.\"\n\nNot asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is bent shall be made straight.\" If one can endure humiliation from things without asserting one’s own rightness, one will surely avoid blame. Thus, one’s straightness becomes naturally distinguished—hence it says \"thus one is distinguished.\"\n\nNot boasting, thus one has merit.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is hollow shall be filled.\" If one does not boast or claim credit but instead practices humility, others will not contend with one, and merit will return to oneself. Like the low earth, water will surely fill it—hence it says \"thus one has merit.\"\n\nNot being arrogant, thus one endures.\n\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is worn shall be renewed.\" If one can uphold simplicity and humility without self-display, others will surely esteem and respect one, and good conduct will grow ever longer—hence it says \"thus one endures.\"\n\n\"Only by not contending does none under heaven contend with one.\"\nThe commentary states: All these acts of bending to preserve wholeness—yielding, not contending, softness overcoming hardness, humility embracing both crooked and straight—who under heaven could contend with such a one? Hence it says \"none can contend with one.\"\n\n\"Of old, what was called 'bending to preserve wholeness'—was this an empty saying? Truly, wholeness is thus attained and returned to.\"\nThe commentary states: This cites antiquity to conclude the meaning of bending to preserve wholeness. Since ancient times, this saying of bending to preserve wholeness has existed—could it be mere empty words without substance? If one can bend and yield without resistance, one truly possesses the principle of wholeness, which returns to oneself—hence it says \"truly, wholeness is thus attained and returned to.\" *Cheng* means \"truly.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Few Words, Naturalness**\nThe previous chapter clarified embracing the One as the model of non-contention, hence the saying \"bending to preserve wholeness.\" This chapter clarifies aligning with the Dao by forgetting words and relinquishing attachments, thus naturally becoming one with what is lost. The first line establishes the principle to illuminate the truth, the next five lines present analogies to expound the teaching. Thereafter, it broadly develops the principle and analogies to form the conclusion.\n\n**Few words, naturalness.**\nThe commentary states: This clarifies that teachings must not be rigidly grasped. \"Few words\" means forgetting words. Words exist for the sake of awakening to the Dao; when one awakens to the Dao, words are forgotten. Yet one cannot entirely forget them, for they serve to expound the principle. But the principle of naturalness should not be fixed as existing or not existing. The meaning of \"few words\" is likewise not fixed in speech. Thus, the phrase \"few words\" is used to reveal the principle of naturalness—hence it says \"few words, naturalness.\" If one can, through those words and teachings, awaken to and realize the subtle, not clinging to the trap or the fish, one accords with naturalness. Hence it says \"few words, naturalness.\"\n\n**Whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day.**\nThe commentary states: Whirlwinds are violently swift winds. Sudden rains are violently heavy rains. Wind exists to scatter things, rain to moisten them. If they are violently swift or heavy, they harm things and do not last. This is likened to teachings, which exist to expound the principle. If one clings to words and fixates on teachings, one cannot awaken to or understand them, and will surely lose the Dao and fall into delusion. Thus, winds and rains must not be violent and sudden, and teachings must not be rigidly grasped. To clarify that forgetting words accords with naturalness, it presents the analogy of whirlwinds and sudden rains.\n\n**Who causes these? Heaven and Earth.**\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot even endure long—how much less can man?\n\nThe commentary states: *Shu* means \"who.\" The text poses the question: Who causes these whirlwinds and sudden rains? The answer: Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, even their violent outbursts cannot last. How much less can ordinary men, clinging rigidly to teachings and acting with sudden violence, fail to empty themselves and forget, gradually reaching the extreme—how could they ever attain awakening and understanding? Thus, those who follow the Dao—\n\nThe commentary states: *Cong* means \"to accord.\" The supremely empty Dao, its function inexhaustible and without fixed form, flows through things without ever congealing or stagnating. Therefore, if one wishes to embody this wondrous Dao and accord with it, one must not cling or stagnate. Hence it says: *those who follow the Dao.*\n\nThose of the Dao are one with the Dao.\nThe commentary states: Those who accord with the Dao are called *those of the Dao*—those who follow the Dao without stagnation, awakening to and understanding teachings without rigid attachment, may become one with the Dao. Thus it says: *one with the Dao.*\n\nThose of virtue are one with virtue.\nThe commentary states: *Virtue* is the name for the Dao’s function. When its power extends to things, things receive it, hence it is called *virtue.* Those who embody and awaken to it, following the Dao, not only awaken themselves but also benefit the world. When the world receives their virtue, and they forget their own merit, all their actions accord with the Dao’s function. Thus it says: *those of virtue are one with virtue.*\n\nThose of loss are one with loss.\nThe commentary states: *Loss* refers to clinging to teachings and losing the Dao. Teachings are but the snare and trap of principle. With snare and trap, one may catch fish and hare; but if one clings to the snare and trap, one loses the fish and hare. Clinging to teachings, one loses the wondrous principle. Losing the principle, one has no way to attain the Dao—this is to be one with loss. Thus it says: *those of loss are one with loss.*\n\nThose one with the Dao, the Dao also receives.\nThose one with virtue, virtue also receives.\nThose one with loss, loss also receives.\nThe commentary states: This speaks of resonance through shared qi. Thus, when a tiger roars, wind arises; when a crane cries, its young respond. Though natures differ like liver and gallbladder, or Chu and Yue, when the Dao aligns, even Yi and Xia become as one. Like attracts like—nothing resists this. Thus, those one with the Dao receive the Dao; those one with loss receive loss. Like the moon’s reflection drawn from water with a mirror, or fire kindled by the sun with a burning-mirror. Thus it says: *those one with the Dao, the Dao also receives.*\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nThe commentary states: The reason people cannot embody and awaken to principle, forgetting words, is that their trust and understanding are insufficient, giving rise to doubt and stagnation. With doubt and stagnation, they cling to words in search of awakening. Clinging to words in search of awakening only deepens delusion—this is the response of distrust. Thus it says: *there is distrust.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe previous chapter showed that those who cling to words and stagnate in teachings are one with loss. This chapter reveals that self-display, self-righteousness, boasting, and pride invite the world’s disdain. The first two lines present an analogy to show the difficulty of attainment; the next four lines clarify that even seeking it yields no success. The passage beginning *In relation to the Dao* issues warnings and exhortations, urging those of the Dao not to dwell in such states.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk.\nThe commentary states: *Qi* means \"to stand on tiptoe and gaze.\" *Kua* means \"to stride with legs apart.\" This presents an analogy. To crane the neck and stand on tiptoe in hopes of seeing farther is precarious—one cannot stand firm. To stride with legs apart is to be obstructed by things—one cannot walk. This is like those who are self-displaying and self-righteous.\n\nThus, one who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk. One who displays himself cannot be enlightened; one who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious—this much is clear.\n\nOne who displays himself cannot be enlightened.\nThe commentary states: Those who display themselves lose the mirror of introspection. Flaunting their talents and exalting themselves, they seek to be seen, yet every move invites blame. No one supports them, and their own undertakings end in obscurity. Thus it says: *one who displays himself cannot be enlightened.*\n\nOne who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious.\nThe commentary states: Those who cannot yield or accept others yet insist on their own rightness, seeking to stand out and be recognized, make themselves a target of resentment. Others cannot bear them, and slander grows daily. Thus it is hard to become illustrious. Hence it says: *one who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious.*\n\nOne who boasts achieves no merit.\nThe commentary states: Humility is the handle of virtue; yielding is the ornament of propriety. Without these, nothing can be accomplished. How much less can one who is self-assertive and boastful, seeking merit through non-yielding, achieve anything but strife and excess? Thus it says: *one who boasts achieves no merit.*\n\nOne who prides himself does not endure.\nThe commentary states: The ancient worthies agreed: \"Great virtue appears foolish.\" Those who pride themselves on their reputation and conduct invite scorn. Ridicule follows, and though they seek advancement, others resent them and refuse to acknowledge their growth. Thus it says: *one who prides himself does not endure.*\n\nIn relation to the Dao, these are called leftover food and parasitic conduct.\nThe commentary states: *Leftover food* refers to the remnants of a meal. *Parasitic conduct* refers to superfluous, growth-like behavior. Leftovers are filthy; growths are a bodily affliction. Such conduct as self-display and self-righteousness, when measured against the Dao, is like leftover food and parasitic growths—universally despised. It is called *parasitic conduct* because self-display and self-righteousness are excrescences on virtuous conduct. Thus it says: *parasitic conduct.* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"People will not eat my leftovers.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Growths and excrescences protrude from the body yet exceed its nature.\"\n\nThe world may despise them—thus those of the Dao do not dwell in them.\nThe commentary states: Since self-display and self-righteousness are like leftover food and parasitic conduct, even ordinary things may despise them. Therefore, the noble person of the Dao does not engage in such behavior.\n\nThe Twenty-Fifth Chapter: Something Formless Yet Complete\n\nThe previous chapter clarified that self-display and self-righteousness, when measured against the Dao, are like leftover food and parasitic conduct, concluding that those of the Dao do not dwell in them. This chapter extols the Dao’s greatness through the threefold movement of \"vastness,\" revealing its primordial completion before Heaven and ultimately teaching conformity to the Dao’s spontaneity. It begins by declaring, \"Something formless yet complete,\" in six phrases to illuminate the marvelous source’s ineffable essence, from which all things derive their efficacy. Next, in \"I know not its name\" and the following six phrases, it traces the origin of forced naming, showing even names to be unattainable. Then, in \"Thus the Dao\" and the subsequent six phrases, it demonstrates the nurturing of the Four Great and admonishes rulers to emulate them. From there to the end, it instructs in modeling the Dao’s spontaneity, embracing non-action and purity.\n\nSomething formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\nCommentary: \"Something\" refers to the wondrous entity—the supremely subtle, marvelous source. To explain why forced naming is impossible, it first speaks of the Dao as \"something.\" This wondrous entity, though formless, is complete, containing all images. Tracing its creative transformations, it existed before Heaven and Earth, hence \"born before Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nStill and silent, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates endlessly without exhaustion.\nCommentary: \"Still and silent\" describes the formless entity’s nature—profoundly tranquil and empty, the marvelous source abiding in quiescence. Thus it stands alone and does not alter; responding to things without intent, its function pervades all existence, hence \"circulates endlessly without exhaustion.\"\n\nIt may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\nCommentary: The marvelous source’s creative transformations pervade all existence; all things owe their formation to it. Its nurturing virtue is so abundant that it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven. \"Mother\" signifies nurturing and nourishment.\n\nI know not its name; I style it \"Dao,\" and if forced to name it, call it \"Great.\"\nCommentary: A \"style\" expresses its virtue; a \"name\" defines its essence. The Venerable Lord says the marvelous source’s creative transformations are inexhaustibly subtle in function, its stillness and silence defying fixed form. Born before Heaven and Earth, it eludes designation by lineage. Thus, \"I know not its name.\" Yet seeing its vast pervasion of things, to express its inherent virtue, I style it \"Dao.\" Seeing its all-embracing boundlessness, to define its supremely formless essence, I force the name \"Great.\" Ordinary things are first named, then styled, for they grow from small to large. The Dao is first styled, then named, descending from essence to manifestation.\n\nGreat means passing; passing means far-reaching; far-reaching means returning.\nCommentary: One confined to a single direction is not the most universal under Heaven. Heaven’s office is to cover but not to bear form; Earth’s office is to bear form but not to cover. Only the marvelous source’s function has no fixed direction. Though forced to name it \"Great,\" it does not abide in greatness. Seeking it from greatness, it passes beyond. Seeking it from passing, it becomes distant and unattainable.\n\nFrom afar one seeks it, and it returns to reside in the human body and mind—thus it is said, \"far-reaching means returning.\" Zhuangzi said: \"The Dao is not confined to the great, nor does it neglect the small.\" Therefore, the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great.\n\nCommentary: Because we force the name \"Great\" upon it, we cite examples of what follows in greatness. Thus, Heaven can suspend the dark mystery above and cover all things; Earth can remain tranquil below and bear all things; the king can govern with clarity and stillness, transforming all things—these are the Three Great Ones, and my Dao unifies them all. Within the realm there are Four Great Ones, and the king is one of them.\n\nCommentary: \"Within the realm\" refers to bounded limits. Yet the great Dao of the mysterious realm is not confined to these limits. If we speak only of what is visible, then Heaven and Earth themselves become boundaries, and the Dao is no longer within them. Here, we borrow words to expound the profound principle, not to contrive strange interpretations. We preserve the text to prevent doubts and difficulties, though many explanations remain incomplete.\n\nNow, \"realm\" is but a name. If we take the name as the essence, it is because things have no essence beyond their names—hence \"within the realm.\" If we speak of the Dao, the Dao is within it; if we speak of Heaven’s name, Heaven has no body beyond it—thus we say \"within the realm.\" Within the realm of names, there are these Four Great Ones. It is said that the king is one of them because the king is the chief of human spirits. With the Dao, all things receive his virtue; without it, Heaven and Earth suffer harm. Thus, the king is singled out as one of the Four Great Ones, to urge him to model himself on the Dao’s spontaneity.\n\nMan models himself on Earth; Earth models itself on Heaven; Heaven models itself on the Dao; the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\nCommentary: \"Man\" here refers to the king. We call him \"man\" because he can emulate Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, and the Dao’s clarity and stillness, so that all under Heaven turn to him. If he fails, the people will have no one to follow. Thus, we call him \"man\" as a warning. The king should first embrace Earth’s tranquility; by abiding in tranquility, he should then emulate Heaven’s life-giving transformation, extending his merit to all things. Next, he should emulate the Dao’s clarity and stillness, forgetting his merit in things and allowing them to transform themselves. If the ruler can do this, he aligns with the Dao’s modeling of spontaneity. The Dao’s modeling of spontaneity does not mean imitating spontaneity.\n\nIf, as some confused critics argue, the Dao models itself after spontaneity, then within the realm there would be Five Great Ones, not Four. They further cite the *Western Ascension Scripture*, which says: \"Emptiness and nothingness give birth to spontaneity; spontaneity gives birth to the Dao.\" This makes the Dao the grandchild of emptiness and nothingness, the child of spontaneity, arbitrarily imposing a sequence to establish hierarchy, severing the source and uprooting the foundation—how deeply inverted!\n\nLet us examine this: \"Emptiness and nothingness\" are the essence of the wondrous origin, an essence that is not a thing, hence called \"emptiness and nothingness.\" \"Spontaneity\" is the nature of the wondrous origin, a nature that is not contrived, hence called \"spontaneity.\" The \"Dao\" is the function of the wondrous origin, what we force a name upon, yet it universally generates—hence we call it the Dao. If we trace the names of essence and function, we call it \"emptiness and nothingness.\" Spontaneity and the Dao are one—when we seek their source, they are but the single wondrous origin. What, then, is there to imitate? Thus, the critics’ objections fail to grasp the mystery’s pivot.\n\n**Chapter 26: Weight as the Root of Lightness**\nThe previous chapter, speaking of the Four Great Ones within the realm, ultimately urges modeling on the Dao’s spontaneity. This chapter clarifies that weight and stillness are sovereign, warning against treating the self lightly and the realm carelessly. The first two lines state the principle to reveal its meaning; the next two use analogy to clarify it. The following four lament the ruler’s loss of the Dao, and the final two describe the perils of frivolity and restlessness as a warning.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness; stillness is the sovereign of restlessness.\n\nCommentary: \"Root\" means foundation. The flowers and leaves of plants are light, yet they grow from the root and stem—if the root and stem are agitated, the weight of the root becomes their foundation. Thus, weight is the root of lightness. Weight implies stillness; lightness implies restlessness. Since weight is the root of lightness, stillness is the sovereign of restlessness. Weight has the power to restrain lightness; stillness has the strength to govern restlessness. Thus, when authority is weighty, even the labor of lifting the nose is accomplished; when the mind is still, even the desire to chew ceases.\n\nTherefore, the noble person travels all day yet does not leave the baggage wagon.\n\nCommentary: The \"noble person\" refers to the ruler, for his aspirations can govern people and nurture things—hence we call him \"noble.\" The *zī* is a covered wagon. Weight is the origin of lightness—this is an analogy. The ruler should always maintain weight and stillness, just as one does not depart from the baggage wagon. If a traveler loses his baggage, he will have nothing to rely on and will surely suffer cold and hunger. If the ruler indulges in frivolity and restlessness, his ministers will scatter, and disaster will arise. Thus, it is said he travels all day without leaving the baggage wagon.\n\nThough he may have splendid sights, he dwells in them with serene detachment.\n\nCommentary: If the ruler values weight and stillness, the people will not be overburdened. But if he ascends high towers, sails deep pools, strikes bells, and dances with women as splendid sights, the people’s strength will be exhausted, and chaos and ruin will follow. Thus, the warning: though there may be splendid sights, he should dwell in them with tranquil ease, detached and unconcerned.\n\nHow could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his own person lightly before the realm?\n\nCommentary: The Son of Heaven governs a million *jǐng* of land, levies taxes from 640,000 *jǐng*, commands a million warhorses and ten thousand chariots—hence he is called the lord of ten thousand chariots. \"How could\" is an expression of lament. The realm is the great treasure’s seat. The lord of ten thousand chariots unifies the Four Seas; he should ensure his descendants number in the thousands and his lineage endures for a hundred generations. If he governs well, there will be effortless transformation; if he embraces virtue, all will return to benevolence. How could he, entrusted with this great vessel, indulge in pleasure, surrendering his person to desire and leading all to ruin? Thus, for the sake of personal desire, he treats the great treasure’s seat lightly—how lamentable!\n\nTo act lightly is to lose one’s ministers; to act rashly is to lose one’s lord.\n\n**Commentary:** If a lord is overly frivolous, he will inevitably cause disturbance; with disturbance, people scatter—who then will serve as his ministers? Thus it is said, *to act lightly is to lose one’s ministers*—this is a warning to rulers. As for ministers, they must measure their abilities when accepting office, lest they invite slander by advancing too swiftly. If one feigns merit to seek favor, adorns deceit to chase glory, and pursues promotion with such rashness, disaster will soon follow, and exile or execution will be self-inflicted—how then can one serve a lord? Thus it is said, *to act rashly is to lose one’s lord*—this extends the warning to ministers.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: \"Good Practice Leaves No Tracks\"**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that gravity and stillness make one a lord, cautioning against treating the realm lightly; this chapter elucidates that words and deeds should leave no trace, urging constant goodness in saving others. To uphold gravity and stillness is to embody non-action. To practice good words and deeds is to value forgetting and relinquishment. First, it sets forth the five virtues of conduct, then expounds the compassion of saving others, and finally unfolds the teaching of mutual forgetting—though it concludes with the essential principle of profound subtlety.\n\n**Good practice leaves no tracks.**\n\n**Commentary:** This reveals the purity of the Dharma-nature. *Practice* refers to cultivation. The Dharma-nature is pure, and this is called the profound mystery. Though one relies on diligent practice, one must remain unattached—arising and ceasing in succession, practicing yet without practice, harmonizing with the Dao. This is called *good practice*. If one can achieve this, emptiness and form become equal, and both realm and mind are purified. To seek tracks in such a state—is it not difficult? Thus it is said, *good practice leaves no tracks.*\n\n**Good words leave no flaws or blame.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that one of good practice does not cling to verbal teachings. *Flaw* means defect; *blame* means reproach. *Words* refer to teachings. If one’s practice is boundless, one can comprehend verbal teachings without becoming attached to them—transcending words while using words. This is *good words*. If one can do this, one preserves the meaning while discarding the form, perceiving the principle while forgetting the words. In such verbal teachings, there is not a single defect or reproach. Thus it is said, *good words leave no flaws or blame.*\n\n**The good reckoner uses no counting rods.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that when verbal teachings leave no trace, there are no divergent paths. If one clings to words and is bound by practice, debating right and wrong, even the most skilled reckoner cannot calculate it. But if one understands that all dharmas are expedient gates, ultimately pure and free from discriminating views, then one need not labor over counting rods or calculations to naturally enter the One Vehicle. If one reckons so well, why rely on counting rods? Thus it is said, *the good reckoner uses no counting rods.*\n\n**The good closer needs no bolts or bars to remain unopened.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that when one no longer calculates divergent paths, the mind of desire naturally closes. *Bolt* is horizontal; *bar* is vertical. If one practices goodness and closure without attachment or stagnation, the mind remains luminous and pure, and sensory dust does not arise. Thus it is said, *the good closer needs no bolts or bars—how could it be opened?* Hence, *the good closer needs no bolts or bars to remain unopened.*\n\n**The good binder uses no ropes or ties to remain unsolved.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that one who is good at closure unites the mind with the Dao. *Bind* means to fasten; *rope* means cord; *tie* means restraint; *solve* means to loosen. If one sits in forgetfulness and transcends perception, deeply harmonizing with the source of the Dao amidst all dharmas, one can avoid being bound by the mind. This is called *good binding*. Those who use ropes and ties will find that when the rope frays, the tie loosens. But those bound by the Dao find that when the mind is still, the Dao becomes obscure. Even if all conditions arise, one remains unstained. Though no ropes or ties are used, how could it be loosened and undone? Thus it is said, *the good binder uses no ropes or ties to remain unsolved.*\n\n**Therefore, the sage constantly saves others, and so abandons no one.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Therefore* introduces what follows to clarify what precedes. Though the sage’s mind is serene and still, their teaching flows freely. Thus, they constantly use their goodness to save others, ensuring all attain clarity and understanding. With great compassion and impartiality, they guide all people without exception. Thus it is said, *constantly saves others, and so abandons no one.*\n\n**Constantly saves all things, and so abandons nothing.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Things* encompass both the sentient and insentient. Saving people with good teaching means not abandoning them; saving things with a good heart means not abandoning anything. This allows all beings—moving and still—to flourish without premature harm. Thus it is said, *constantly saves all things, and so abandons nothing.*\n\n**This is called \"inheriting illumination.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *Inheriting* means subtle application; *illumination* means clear awakening. Saving others through good practice lies in forgetting and relinquishment. If one clings to teachings and prides oneself on attainment, tracks will remain. Thus, though one constantly saves others, one must ultimately ensure the wisdom-mind remains unobstructed. Such subtle application leads to awakening. Thus it is said, *this is called \"inheriting illumination.\"*\n\n**Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Teacher* means model. The good person, free from all attachments, has a pure mind; unobstructed by dharmas, their teaching is all-pervading. Like water, it reflects whatever comes before it—what is reflected takes form, while the one reflecting remains without mind. The good person’s wisdom is like this, and so can serve as the teacher and model for the not-good.\n\n**The not-good person is the resource of the good.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Resource* means to take. Fire has warmth, and the cold draw near. Those who hear the Dao and practice diligently must rely on a master. Having praised the teacher’s goodness, one must submit to the disciple’s labor. Thus, the not-good person can be taken and employed by the good.\n\nHe who does not honor his teacher nor cherish his resource,\nthough widely learned, is greatly deluded—\nthis is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Commentary:**\nAt the initial stage of practice, the learner retains the duality of study,\nunable to forget the teaching, and so honors and cherishes teacher and resource.\nIf one can fully realize the gateway of practice,\nthen learning becomes no-learning,\nthe names of teacher and resource fall away,\nand the terms of honor and cherish no longer exist.\nYet the great theme of this chapter is the forgetting and relinquishing of teaching.\nSpoken in terms of gradual and sudden, there are no stages without gradation;\nbut when the ultimate is attained, all dharmas are empty.\nThus, the earlier mention of teacher and resource points the way of progress,\nwhile the later words of not honoring and not cherishing guide the gate of awakening and realization.\nThis makes clear that honoring the teacher is for the sake of retaining the appearance of study;\nonce the appearance of study is empty, there is naturally nothing to honor.\nCherishing the resource is for the sake of retaining the appearance of teaching;\nwhen teaching is also forgotten, there is no longer a resource to cherish.\nLike fish and water forgetting each other in the river and lake,\nthere is no longer any wetting or moistening.\nWhen the common and vulgar first hear this Way,\nthey do not awaken, clinging to study and fixating on teaching,\nand so must regard it as great delusion.\nThus, the Old Master measures and says:\nthough the common and vulgar may see it as great delusion,\nin terms of the Dao, this is called the essential mystery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 28**\nThe previous chapter clarified that conduct and words must not be clung to,\nand that constant virtue is what saves people.\nThis chapter clarifies that embracing humility is the practice,\nand that constant virtue thereby returns to simplicity.\n\nIt first sets forth the three segments of knowing the male,\nshowing that cultivation gradually reaches the ultimate.\nNext, it states that when simplicity scatters, the two sentences below\ndemonstrate that reaching the ultimate must have an accomplishment.\nFinally, the single phrase \"great governance\" discusses the sage’s function in wielding power,\nconcluding with its profound meaning.\n\n**Know the male, guard the female, and be the world’s valley.**\n**Commentary:**\n*Know* means to discern. *Male* is hardness and impatience.\n*Female* is softness and stillness.\nThings value wholeness and harmony; the Dharma seeks the middle way.\nThe male is excessive and overbearing; the female is lowly and weak—\nneither is perfectly balanced in good conduct.\nOne must rely on sincerity as the warp,\nthus knowing the male’s impatience, one should guard the female’s stillness.\nIn guarding the female’s stillness, one should also know the male’s impatience.\nKnowing the male and guarding the female, one can thereby know the male.\nGuarding the male leads to defeat; defeat obstructs conduct,\nso one is especially warned to guard the female’s softness.\nTo guard the female’s softness is called the virtue of humility;\nall things turn toward it, as water flows to the valley.\nThe *Erya* says: \"Water flowing into a channel is called a valley.\"\n*Be the world’s valley*: constant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to the state of an infant.\n\n**Commentary:**\nKnowing the male and guarding the female is good conduct;\nall things turn toward it, making one the world’s valley.\nOne who can do this has true and constant virtue that never scatters.\nConstant virtue unscattered is wholeness and harmony.\nThe person of wholeness and harmony has few private desires and little craving,\ntranquil and without sign, like an infant—\nthus it is said to return to the state of an infant.\n\n**Know the white, guard the black, and be the world’s model.**\n**Commentary:**\n*White* is brightness. *Black* is darkness.\n*Model* means standard.\nOne who guards the female’s stillness has manifest virtue,\nyet though virtue is manifest, one does not pride oneself before others,\nbut remains like darkness, guarding pure harmony.\nOne who can do this can be the world’s model.\n\n**Be the world’s model**: constant virtue does not err,\nreturning to the boundless.\n**Commentary:**\n*Err* means deviation. *Boundless* means ultimate limit.\nKnowing the white and guarding the black is called complete virtue.\nThe person of complete virtue can be the world’s model,\nand the true and constant Dao responds without error,\nits function inexhaustible—\nthus it is said to return to the boundless.\n\n**Know the honored, guard the humble, and be the world’s valley.**\n**Commentary:**\n*Honored* is honor and glory. *Humble* is lowliness and disgrace.\nOne who is the world’s model has honored virtue,\nyet though virtue is honored, one constantly guards humility,\ntaking harmony as the measure, containing all without exception,\nlike an empty valley that responds to whatever comes—\nthus it is said to be the world’s valley.\n\n**Be the world’s valley**: constant virtue is then complete,\nreturning to simplicity.\n**Commentary:**\n*Simplicity* is the Dao.\nEmpty and receptive, responding to things like the valley spirit,\ntrue and constant virtue is thereby perfectly complete.\nComplete, it returns to simplicity.\nThe Dao is the essence of virtue; virtue is the function of the Dao.\nSpeaking of its function, it is said that constant virtue is complete;\ndiscussing its essence, it is said to return to simplicity.\nReturning to simplicity, the wondrous source is pure;\nconstant virtue, its function is inexhaustible.\nWho but the most penetrating in the world could attain this?\n\n**When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels.**\n**The sage uses it and becomes the leader of officials.**\n**Commentary:**\n*Vessels* are material forms.\nFrom \"know the male\" onward, it discusses cultivating nature and returning to virtue,\nthus returning to the Dao.\nHere it says that when simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels,\nshowing that when virtue is complete and merges with the Dao,\nit can then function.\nThe traces of function are coarse, involving material forms—\nthus it is said that when simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels.\nOnce involved with material forms, the uses of its material must have refinement and coarseness.\nThus, the ordinary person uses it and can only preserve pure simplicity,\nwhile the sage’s great salvation makes him the leader of all materials.\n**Therefore, great governance does not sever.**\n**Commentary:**\nThis clarifies the sage’s use of the Dao.\nThe sage’s virtue is complete, governing all things with great control,\nfollowing the Qian and Kun in bestowing blessings,\nlike the grace of rain and dew,\neach unfolding its harmony without knowing its power,\nallowing all things, moving and still, to fully attain growth and completion,\nnever severing or harming for one’s own use—\nthus it is said that great governance does not sever.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 29**\nThe previous chapter clarified that embracing humility is the practice,\nand that constant virtue must return to simplicity.\nThis chapter clarifies that grasping and clinging lose the sacred vessel,\nand so must not be done.\n\nIt first sets forth the six phrases from \"Those who would take the world\"\nto show that the precious position has its proper place,\nwarning treacherous and rebellious ministers.\n\"Those who grasp lose it\" demonstrates that the mandate does not abide in constancy,\nserving to warn deluded and indulgent rulers.\nThe section from \"Thus things\" onward distinguishes the mutual dependence of things,\nand from \"Therefore the sage\" onward warns rulers against excessive extravagance.\n\nThose who would take the realm and act upon it—\nI see they shall not attain their end.\n*(Commentary: The realm is the precious seat of great treasure. When August Heaven commands the Emperor to govern all beings, it must await the mandate resting upon one’s person before one may rule the ten thousand lands. Yet treacherous and rebellious villains, violent and cruel men, would seize the realm by force and make themselves its lord. Since they have no time even to purge their own crimes, how can they hope for Heaven’s favor? Thus the Old Master warns: I see that such men shall never achieve what they seek. 已 is an auxiliary particle.)*\n\nThe realm is the sacred vessel—it cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it shall ruin it.\n*(Commentary: The realm’s precious seat cannot be seized by force because it is the vessel of Heaven and Earth’s numinous power, meant to endure under sagely rulers of constant virtue and spread the transformation of harmonious kindness. How could violent and cruel men be allowed to act upon it by force and poison the realm? Thus it cannot be acted upon, and those who do shall surely fail. This is a warning to treacherous and rebellious ministers.)*\n\nThose who grasp shall lose it.\n*(Commentary: Rulers—whether restoring order after chaos or succeeding to the throne to uphold tradition—must all manifest virtue and suppress transgression, showing compassion and seeking to relieve suffering. If one clings to this position and tyrannizes the divine lord, allowing the state to descend into chaos without semblance of order, then Heaven’s Way will bar the way of excess, the spirits will grow angry, and the people will harbor resentment. Disasters will arise, and turmoil will follow—who then will uphold such a ruler? He shall lose this position. This is a warning to emperors and kings.)*\n\nThus things: some move forward, some follow behind;\nsome exhale warmth, some blow cold;\nsome grow strong, some weaken;\nsome are upheld, some collapse.\n*(Commentary: This shows that all things are inconstant, and affairs rise and fall in mutual dependence. 呴 is warm breath; 吹 is cold breath. 强 is strength; 羸 is weakness. 载 means to undertake; 隳 means to destroy. Since acting leads to ruin and grasping leads to loss, so too do things: some advance ahead, some trail behind; some exhale warmth, some blow cold; some are supported to grow strong, some are suppressed to grow weak; some are drawn forth to undertake affairs, some are pushed to collapse. All are tangled together, without fixed measure. Only by following the people’s desires can one be joyfully accepted without resentment.)*\n\nTherefore the sage abandons excess, abandons extravagance, abandons excessiveness.\n*(Commentary: Thus the sage who governs the realm, seeing that movement and following are inconstant and knowing that clinging leads to loss, restrains himself and examines his conduct, cutting away greed and curbing desire. He abandons extreme actions, abandons lavish adornments, abandons excessive indulgence. Though named as three, they are in truth one. Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness all transgress proper measure.)*\n\n**Chapter 30**\nThe previous chapter showed that clinging leads to loss, and thus one must abandon excess, extravagance, and excessiveness. This chapter shows that military strength invites retribution and that one must not indulge in arrogance and aggression. It begins with \"Those who assist rulers with the Way,\" warning ministers not to rely on military force. The section from \"Where armies encamp\" onward clarifies that a fondness for war inevitably brings misfortune, and from \"Thus the good\" onward demonstrates that one must act only when unavoidable. The section from \"Things in their prime\" concludes by showing that relying on strength leads to defeat.\n\nThose who assist rulers with the Way do not dominate the realm with military force—\nsuch affairs invite retribution.\n*(Commentary: 以 means \"to employ\"; 佐 means \"to assist\"; 还 means \"retribution.\" When serving as a minister, one should employ the transformative power of the Way and non-action to assist the ruler, governing like Yao and Shun, becoming their right hand. Perform the shield-and-feather dance upon the palace steps, cultivate civil virtue across the four seas, so that all grasp the great image and come to you, the grand staircase is level, and the realm is at peace. If instead one brandishes the might of weapons and armor, exhausts the affairs of invasion and conquest, and wages war against others, they will surely respond. Since such affairs invite retribution, who can foresee the outcome of victory or defeat?)*\n\nWhere armies encamp, brambles grow.\nAfter great armies pass, years of famine follow.\n\n**Commentary:** *Shī* (师) means \"military forces,\" and as the *Yijing* states, \"The army is the multitude.\" When armies are mobilized and multitudes set in motion, people are wearied by service. On the march, they must carry provisions and be escorted, disrupting labor and harming agriculture. With farming neglected, brambles grow. After great armies pass, the accumulated costs are vast. Harmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, but the *qi* of war invites harm. Floods and droughts follow in succession, crops fail to grow, and thus years of famine and disaster inevitably come as retribution for the grievances of endless warfare.\n\nTherefore, the wise act only to achieve their aim and dare not seek dominance through force.\n**Commentary:** The *Chunqiu* states, \"To slay the enemy is called *guǒ* (果).\" Here, it is made clear that slaying the enemy prevents mutual aggression and halts their violence. Thus, to slay the enemy is to achieve *guǒ*—that is, to stop the enemy. Laozi says: In all matters, one should act only when unavoidable. If forced to employ arms, the best use of force is merely to halt killing, preventing further predation. One must never use the many to oppress the few or bully others to assert dominance. To assert dominance invites retribution, and thus the warning is given: dare not seek dominance through force.\n\nAct decisively but do not boast; act decisively but do not vaunt your achievements; act decisively but do not grow arrogant.\n**Commentary:** The proper use of force is to decisively halt the enemy. If one halts the enemy yet boasts of it, this cannot be called a virtuous victory. Therefore, though one may decisively halt the enemy, one must take care never to boast or brag. Boasting and bragging lead to the pursuit of merit, so even when one acts decisively to halt the enemy, the warning is given: do not vaunt your achievements. To vaunt one’s achievements is to become arrogant and overbearing. Arrogance and overbearing lead to delight in killing, and such delight ensures defeat in the blink of an eye. This is a clear warning—how can one not be cautious?\n\nTo act decisively is unavoidable; thus, act decisively but do not rely on force.\n**Commentary:** To act decisively in halting the enemy is not to seek victory by overpowering others, but rather, when the enemy invades and there is no alternative, one must act decisively when unavoidable. *Yǐ* (已) means \"to halt.\" When employing arms in response to the enemy, one does not seek victory but merely halts aggression. One who can do this does not rely on force to win, and thus it is said: act decisively but do not rely on force.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way.\" What does not follow the Way comes to an early end.\n**Commentary:** All things, when they reach their peak, begin to age. When armies grow too strong, they meet defeat. Thus, relying on military strength is like a thing relying on its prime—both only hasten their decline. An army that relies on strength cannot preserve its virtuous victory. These two matters—things in their prime and armies in their strength—are called \"not following the Way.\" Wise ministers and enlightened rulers, recognizing this, must halt such actions early. Thus, it is said: what does not follow the Way comes to an early end. *Yǐ* (已) means \"to halt.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 31: On Fine Armies**\nThe previous chapter clarified that strong armies invite retribution and that one must not act decisively with boasting or vaunting. This chapter explains that fine armies are things some despise, and one should employ them only when unavoidable. It begins by admonishing their inauspiciousness, showing that those who follow the Way do not engage in them. Next, it states that even in victory, one should not take pride, demonstrating that delight in killing is wrong. It then offers analogies from auspicious affairs to clarify, concluding with the rites of mourning to show that one should not delight in war.\n\nFine armies are inauspicious instruments.\n**Commentary:** *Jiā* (佳) means \"fine.\" *Bīng* (兵) refers to military strategies and the like. *Xiáng* (祥) means \"auspicious.\" *Qì* (器) means \"tools\" or \"instruments.\" The noble person advances virtue and cultivates their work, carefully tending to beginnings, concealing their instruments within, and awaiting the right moment to act. They should wander in the gardens of the Way and virtue, roam the forests of ancient texts, so that their illustrious name shines forth, and they accomplish great deeds. Yet some take delight in military strategies and tactical manuals. The crafting of strategies turns the proper into the extraordinary; books on military tactics emphasize display over substance, all centering on attack, war, and slaughter. Thus, they are inauspicious instruments.\n\nSome despise them, and therefore those who follow the Way do not engage in them.\n**Commentary:** To cultivate virtue within is to fulfill one’s capacity. Since these are inauspicious instruments, even ordinary things may despise them—how much more so the noble person who follows the Way? How could they willingly involve themselves in such matters? Thus, it is said: those who follow the Way do not engage in them.\n\nThe noble person values the left in times of peace and the right in times of war.\n**Commentary:** The left is *yáng*; the right is *yīn*. *Yáng* delights in life; *yīn* delights in killing. Delighting in life, the left is valued in times of peace. Delighting in killing, the right is valued in times of war.\n\nArmies are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person.\n**Commentary:** The preceding text states that fine armies are inauspicious instruments, explaining that in war, the right is valued and killing is favored, and thus those who follow the Way do not engage in them. Here, it is said that armies are inauspicious instruments, directly concluding the earlier point: they are not the instruments of the noble person. The noble person takes the Way and virtue as their instruments, and thus nothing is not beneficial.\n\nWhen unavoidable, one employs them, with tranquility as the highest principle.\n**Commentary:** Civil virtue is the instrument of governance and transformation. Military strategy is merely its auxiliary. Thus, civil virtue weaves the patterns of heaven and earth, while martial power quells calamities and chaos. Though heaven generates the five materials, none can be discarded, and the use of martial power must be measured and appropriate. One must recognize that their application has primary and secondary aspects, their execution has proper and improper sequences, and all depends on circumstances. Only when unavoidable does one respond—such as when the four barbarians invade and the royal army launches a punitive expedition. One should then display benevolence and pacify them with the Way and virtue. Like the stinging of mosquitoes and gnats, one should harbor no anger. Extending this principle, tranquility is the highest principle.\n\nVictory should not be glorified. To glorify it is to delight in killing.\n**Commentary:** If one cannot win over others with virtue and resorts to arms to seek victory, though one may prevail, one should still feel shame for one’s lack of virtue and not take pride in it. Victory often entails much killing, so to take pride in victory is to delight in killing.\n\nThose who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n**Commentary:** Heaven and earth delight in life, nurturing all things. The benevolent person should follow heaven’s virtue, making preservation and salvation their duty. How can one recklessly indulge in cunning and force to satisfy their greed? The cruel and rapacious will find no one to follow them. To seek the realization of their ambitions—is this not difficult?\n\nThus, those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.\n**Commentary:** The left pertains to yang and life, hence auspicious; the right pertains to yin and death, hence inauspicious. As the *Record of Rites: Tan Gong* states: \"The Master stood with his disciples, clasping his hands, and honored the right. The disciples also honored the right. The Master said, 'You delight in learning, but I have recently lost my elder sister.'\" The disciples then honored the left. The deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right—this is to accord with mourning rites.\n**Commentary:** The supreme general commands the army and is solely responsible for killing, hence he stands on the right. The deputy general, being secondary, does not bear sole responsibility for killing, hence he stands on the left. Now, though the left is honored and the right is humble, the supreme general nonetheless occupies the right, for the Way of warfare is akin to mourning rites, which honor the right. Thus, the supreme general stands on the right, as if placed there by mourning rites.\n\nWhen many are killed, one should mourn them with sorrowful tears.\n**Commentary:** To seek victory in war inevitably entails killing many. Yet victory should not be glorified, so one grieves and weeps in sorrow. The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. Now, in war, lives are taken—how can a humane heart not feel compassion and weep in sorrow? Is this not fitting?\n\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe mourning rites.\n**Commentary:** Though victory in battle brings rewards and rank, military merit is placed on the right, an inauspicious position, hence it is said to observe mourning rites. Yet war is but an instrument of misfortune—must one don mourning garments and lean on a staff to call it mourning rites? Those who annotate this passage all claim such rites existed in antiquity, but upon searching the classics, no evidence is found. Thus, this interpretation is not adopted here. The reference to the Duke of Qin weeping before his army pertains to mourning defeat, not victory.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that fine weaponry is inauspicious, and thus one of the Dao does not engage in it. This chapter explains that if lords and kings uphold the Dao, the myriad things will naturally submit. It begins by declaring the nameless to elucidate the Dao, then illustrates how upholding the Dao brings forth auspicious signs. The passage on \"beginning to govern\" expands on its application, and the analogy of the Dao concludes the chapter.\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\n**Commentary:** Its responsiveness is inexhaustible, adapting to all circumstances—such is the constancy of the Dao. As it constantly responds, its manifestations are manifold, hence it is nameless in its constancy. Thus, it is said: *The Dao is eternally nameless.*\n\nThough the uncarved block is small, none under heaven dare treat it as a subject.\n**Commentary:** The uncarved block is the wondrous root. Spoken of in terms of its life-giving function, it is called the Dao; discussed in its essence of oneness, it is called the uncarved block. Thus, it is said to be small. Yet in its transformative power, it perfects all things, making it supremely great. Hence, none dare treat the Dao as a subject.\n\nIf lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will naturally submit.\n**Commentary:** If lords and kings can embrace and uphold the wondrous root in its essence of oneness, practicing non-action and non-affair, then all within the four seas will look up to their transformation, submitting in reverence. Bathed in virtue and drinking in harmony, they will naturally yield.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to descend sweet dew.\n**Commentary:** When lords and kings uphold the Dao, peace prevails, and no disasters or calamities arise. Heaven and earth harmonize, their qi intermingling in balance, descending sweet dew as an auspicious omen for the lords and kings.\n\nNo one commands it, yet it distributes itself evenly.\n**Commentary:** *Mo* means \"none.\" Heaven descends sweet dew, bestowing its blessings without intent. No one issues commands, yet it spreads evenly, as if the lords and kings had weighed and distributed it impartially, without bias or favor. When great harmony is achieved through virtuous transformation, from east to west, who would not submit without thought?\n\nAnother interpretation: When lords and kings uphold the Dao to bring forth auspicious signs, the people naturally attain peace. Without the need for commands, all becomes even and unified.\n\nWhen governance begins, names arise. Once names exist,\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means \"to govern.\" *Names* refer to the named things under heaven. *Ji* means \"exhaustively.\" If lords and kings embrace the essence of oneness, heaven will send down auspicious signs, bestowing transformation without intent, spreading evenly and uniformly. Only then can they begin to govern the named things. When things submit to the Dao, all named things become the possession of the lords and kings.\n\nthey too will know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n**Commentary:** *Dai* means \"peril.\" When lords and kings uphold the Dao and transform the world, the myriad things naturally submit. Thus, even named things will know to rely on and stop at the lords and kings. By relying on a ruler of the Dao, one avoids perilous affairs. Hence, it is said: *Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.*\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams flowing into rivers and seas.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the passage on lords and kings upholding the Dao, to which heaven responds. Thus, it is said: A ruler of the Dao governing the world, shaping it with benevolent virtue, will naturally bring about great peace. When harmonious qi moves heaven, heavenly omens will surely respond, just as valleys and streams flow into rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter 33**\nThe preceding chapter explained that when lords and kings uphold the Dao, the myriad things naturally submit. This chapter clarifies that the reason they submit to a ruler of the Dao lies in self-knowledge and self-mastery. Self-knowledge brings clarity; self-mastery brings strength. It concludes with the idea of *dying yet not perishing*, warning against violating the principles of heaven.\n\nOne who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened.\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means \"to discern.\" When the mind engages with external things, knowledge arises. The mind that arises from such engagement discerns past matters—this is called *knowing the dharma*. When one employs the mind to generate wisdom and discerns the good and evil of others, this is commonly called *wisdom*. But if one turns inward, examining without relying on the mind, clearly observing the mind without generating knowledge of the dharma—one who can do this is said to be *enlightened*. Hence, it is said: *One who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened.*\n\nOne who conquers others has strength; one who conquers oneself is mighty.\n\n**Commentary:**\n\"One who conquers others\" refers to using power and authority to overpower others—such a person may only be called *strong*. \"One who conquers oneself\" means mastering one’s own mind, rendering it soft and yielding. The Way of softness and yielding cannot be overcome by external things, thus preserving one’s true strength. Hence, the following passage states: *\"To guard softness is to be strong.\"* It also says: *\"The soft overcomes the hard,\"* and thus: *\"One who conquers oneself is mighty.\"*\n\n\"One who knows contentment is rich.\"\n**Commentary:** Contentment resides in the mind. If the mind knows contentment, it will be free from greed and desire. Though one may subsist on simple fare and plain water, one remains lofty and self-sufficient—this may be called *rich*. \"One who acts with perseverance has resolve.\"\n**Commentary:** To exert oneself with unrelenting effort, never slackening or growing weary, knowing oneself and conquering oneself without wavering—this may be called *having resolve*.\n\n\"One who does not lose their proper place endures.\"\n**Commentary:** Practices such as knowing contentment and acting with perseverance are common among people. If one does not lose their constancy in these, they may be said to *endure in the Way*. Another interpretation: One who acts without losing their proper place may long endure.\n\n\"One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\"\n**Commentary:** *Death* is the end of the principle of life. *Perishing* refers to premature or unjust demise. *Longevity* is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. To yield to the natural order, not losing the principle of heaven, and to pass away in accord with transformation—such a one fulfills their allotted span and may be called *long-lived*. If one is driven by relentless ambition, the principle of life remains incomplete. Shan Bao retained the complexion of a child, and Zhang Yi enjoyed wealth and nobility, yet neither fulfilled the principle of heaven—how could they be called *long-lived*? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"None in the world is longer-lived than an infant who dies young, yet Peng Zu is considered short-lived.\"*\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows Everywhere**\nThe previous chapter showed that even those who submit as guests to a ruler of the Dao do so because he is able to conquer himself. This chapter reveals that all great and glorious achievements arise from modeling the Dao and forgetting merit.\n\nIt begins by declaring, *\"The great Dao flows everywhere,\"* demonstrating that it extends left and right without boundaries or contention. Next, it states, *\"Though its merit is accomplished, it does not claim possession,\"* showing that the small and the great defy naming. Thus, in the passage on the sage below, it praises the sage for not valuing himself, thereby achieving great and glorious deeds.\n\n*\"The great Dao flows everywhere; it may be found to the left or right.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"Flows everywhere\"* describes its unbounded nature. The Dao as a thing is neither yin nor yang, neither soft nor hard. It flows without attachment, responding to all phenomena, available to the left or right without partiality. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The Dao has never had boundaries.\"* *\"The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse them. Its merit is accomplished, yet it does not claim possession.\"*\n**Commentary:** All things in heaven and earth rely on the great Dao’s power of free-flowing generation to sustain their principle of life. Yet the Dao, in its wondrous transformation, is fundamentally without intent. Though things rely on it to live, the Dao does not grow weary or consider it labor. Another interpretation: Things do not refuse the Dao’s grace, for its merit lies in generation and completion. The great Dao’s work of generating things is fully accomplished, yet it does not regard them as its own possession. Another interpretation: The Dao’s generation of things fulfills its virtue and completes its merit, yet though its merit is accomplished, it does not claim possession—this is called *forgetting merit*.\n\n*\"It nurtures the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master. Ever without desire, it may be called small.\"*\n**Commentary:** This is a phonetic gloss on the meaning. *\"It may be called small\"* means it *cannot* be called small. The Dao generates the ten thousand things, nurturing and maturing them without acting as their master. Toward those myriad things, it is ever without desire—how could the Dao be narrow or small? Thus, *\"it may be called small\"* means it *cannot* be called small.\n\n*\"The ten thousand things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—it may be called great.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"The ten thousand things return to it\"* means they return to the Dao’s power of generation and completion. The Dao does not act as their master, yet it does not discard these myriad things—how could the Dao not be vast and great? Thus, *\"it may be called great\"* means it *cannot* be called great. Since it may be found to the left or right, it is neither small nor great. Being neither small nor great, it is truly difficult to name. The annotation states: *\"There are ten thousand differences\"*—this is a passage from *Zhuangzi*.\n\n*\"Therefore, the sage never acts as great, and thus accomplishes greatness.\"*\n**Commentary:** The sage who governs the world spreads virtue and bestows blessings, causing the people’s customs to become pure and transformation to spread. Things flourish and grow, yet the sage models the Dao by forgetting merit, never exalting himself as great. Thus, he accomplishes his great and glorious work.\n\n**End of Volume Four of *The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Annotated and Elucidated Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n**Beginning of Volume Five of *The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Annotated and Elucidated Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Holding the Great Image**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that the Dao may be applied to the left or right, thereby bestowing the merit of nurturing and sustaining all things. This chapter elucidates that when a ruler employs the Dao, the people return to the transformative influence of peace and harmony. It begins by emphasizing the act of \"holding the image\" to illustrate the principle of return and allegiance. Next, it speaks of \"music and delicacies\" as a metaphor for the cause of such return. The passage beginning with *\"The Dao issues from the mouth\"* expounds upon the teaching of non-action and wordless instruction, urging rulers to employ the Dao.\n\n*\"Hold the great image, and all under heaven will come to you.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Hold* means to grasp or uphold. *The great image* refers to the Dao. This teaches that when a ruler upholds the great Dao to govern the world, acting without contrivance or interference, all things follow their natural course. Observing the times and gauging the winds, all turn toward the ruler of the Dao. Thus, it is said, *\"all under heaven will come to you.\"*\n\n*\"They come and are not harmed; they dwell in peace and tranquility.\"*\n**Commentary:** When people from the four directions, drawn by the ruler’s transformative influence, come to him, the sovereign governs with the Dao, offering comfort without harm, and thus they abide in great peace. *Peace* denotes the harmony of governance and teaching; *great* signifies the brilliance of meritorious achievement.\n\n*\"Music and delicacies make the passing traveler pause.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Music* refers to melodies; *delicacies*, to food and drink. This is a metaphor: just as a household with music and food causes passing travelers to linger, so too does a ruler who upholds the great image draw all under heaven to return.\n\n*\"The Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"The Dao that issues from the mouth\"* refers to the ruler’s restraint of the Dao’s pure and tranquil principles, embodying the teaching of non-action and wordlessness. When first uttered, it seems bland and flavorless—how could it compare to the worldly pleasures of kinship, praise, fear, or shame, which are deemed savory?\n\n*\"Look at it, and it cannot be seen; listen to it, and it cannot be heard. Yet its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Inexhaustible* means without end. The transformative power of the Dao, being non-action, is bland and impartial. It neither imposes harsh scrutiny nor enacts ostentatious laws. Thus, it cannot be seen when looked upon, nor heard when listened to. Yet, with the passage of years, its surplus is evident: customs become pure, harmony spreads, and all things—animate and inanimate—flourish. Its efficacy is boundless, hence *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Art of Contraction**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that those who practice the transformative power of the Dao become a refuge for all. This chapter reveals that the Dao, when employed as a strategic tool, serves as the state’s most potent instrument. While return leads to peace and tranquility, this instrument must never be displayed to others. It begins by introducing the strategic interplay of contraction and expansion, then demonstrates the practice of softness and weakness, and concludes with the metaphor of the fish and the abyss to illustrate the subtlety of strategic action.\n\n*\"When you wish to contract it, you must first expand it. When you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it. When you wish to abolish it, you must first exalt it. When you wish to seize it, you must first bestow it.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Contract* means to gather or restrain. This explains how the sage employs strategic means to guide and transform living beings. Since people possess both dull and keen faculties, teachings must adapt through both expedient and definitive methods. The sage, assessing the nature of beings, employs these methods in alternation. Those of keen faculties, upon perceiving goodness, reform their faults and, with but a slight indication, deeply grasp the root. Those of dull faculties, mired in long-standing delusion, cannot be led to return without strategic means. Thus, to contract their desires, one must first expand them to their utmost, allowing them to become ensnared by their own cravings, whereupon they will naturally contract. The same principle applies to strengthening and weakening, and so forth. When applied, none will fail to trust it. At first hearing, such words may seem contrary to the Dao’s intent, but profound understanding of its mysteries reveals the basis of expedient and definitive methods. Hence, the annotation states: *\"The noble person values strategic action when it aligns with righteousness; the petty person uses it for deceit.\"* The subsequent line, *\"it must not be displayed to others,\"* underscores the difficulty of strategic action.\n\n*\"This is called subtle illumination.\"*\n**Commentary:** The principle of strategic transformation is subtle, yet when its effects are examined, its efficacy is manifest. Thus, it is called *\"subtle illumination.\"*\n\n*\"Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\"*\n**Commentary:** The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Compliance is the means by which strategic action is carried out.\"* This clarifies that compliance, humility, and modesty enable the exercise of strategic action. Thus, to contract, one first expands; to weaken, one first strengthens. Yet ultimately, contraction and weakness prevail—this is how softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength. Hence, it is said, *\"Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\"*\n\n*\"Fish cannot be removed from the abyss; the state’s sharpest instruments must not be displayed to others.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Removed* means to lose. *Sharpest instruments* refer to strategic means. Just as fish depend on water, so too does the ruler wield authority. If fish lose water, they are caught by others; if strategic means are improperly displayed, they are usurped by petty men, who manipulate them for deceit.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that the Dao may employ strategic means, demonstrating the art of contraction and expansion. This chapter emphasizes that such strategy must align with righteousness, ultimately anchoring the uncarved block of simplicity. Thus, *\"The Dao constantly practices non-action,\"* and if lords and kings uphold it, all things transform of themselves. Simplicity does not desire the world’s stillness, yet the world becomes clear of itself. Laozi speaks to elucidate the wordless, teaching to relinquish teaching. Thus, he expounds this chapter at the close of the *Upper Classic*, entrusting it to those who, through profound insight, may forget both words and their absence.\n\n*\"The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\n**Commentary:** The nature of the Dao is pure and tranquil, its wondrous essence profoundly still—hence, it constantly practices non-action. All things rely upon it for birth and growth; it responds unfailingly to all stimuli—hence, nothing is left undone. Those who act always leave something undone; thus, those who practice non-action leave nothing undone.\n\n*\"If lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\"*\n**Commentary:** If lords and kings uphold the Dao’s purity and tranquility, practicing non-action and refraining from interference, the myriad things will naturally respond to their transformative influence, and the ruler’s virtuous teaching will restore simplicity.\n\n*\"When transformation stirs desire, I shall restrain it with the nameless uncarved block.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** The \"nameless uncarved block\" is the Dao. \"Desire stirs\" refers to the impulse toward action and intervention. \"I\" is the self-designation of kings and lords. This means: when people receive virtuous teaching and transform accordingly, the ruler’s virtue becomes non-active and pure. Yet if they again stir desire and act with intervention, I shall restrain them with the nameless uncarved block, calming them so they return to purity and stillness, free from the impulse to act. Even the nameless uncarved block must not be desired.\n\n**Commentary:** Above, it was said that when common people stir desire and act with intervention, the ruler shall restrain them with the nameless uncarved block. Now it is said that even the nameless uncarved block must not be desired—if one clings to the nameless, traces remain, and sentient beings, following these traces, lose their root and fall back into intervention, no different from the desires they sought to overcome. Thus, the nameless uncarved block is first used to calm the desires of the people; once their desires are dispelled, the sage also relinquishes the nameless. It is like medicine used to treat illness—once the illness is cured, the medicine is forgotten; like a boat used to cross water—once the crossing is complete, the boat is abandoned. If one clings to the boat after crossing or continues taking medicine after recovery, not only will the far shore remain unreached, but new afflictions will arise.\n\n*\"Not desiring, one attains stillness, and the world will right itself.\"*\n**Commentary:** When even the nameless uncarved block is no longer desired, and the desire for non-desire is likewise forgotten, profound tranquility emerges—this is called complete liberation. The ruler practices non-action and governs from above; the people follow their nature and transform below. Without the need for commands or decrees, the world naturally attains order. Thus it is said, \"the world will right itself.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 38: \"Supreme Virtue Does Not Insist on Virtue\"**\nThis chapter begins by outlining the function of the Dao, then clarifies the transformative power of complete virtue. When virtue is whole, simplicity remains undivided, and the age knows no need for mutual aid. When the Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise, and customs suffer from superficiality and dissipation. To change and restore the original state, the text first describes the non-action of supreme virtue, then the deviations of benevolence and righteousness, concluding with the call to abandon ornamentation and return to substance, so that simplicity and purity may be restored.\n\n*\"Supreme virtue does not insist on virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\"*\n**Commentary:** \"Supreme\" refers to the era. \"Virtue\" denotes its function. In high antiquity, simplicity and non-action governed; embodying the essence of the Dao, it allowed things to follow their nature—this was the unadulterated virtue of that age, hence \"supreme virtue.\" Profound virtue operates in hiddenness, beyond human naming, hence \"does not insist on virtue.\" Yet its harmonious influence spreads, and all things thrive and grow; its power remains complete, hence \"possesses virtue.\" The note, *\"That by which things are enabled to live is called virtue,\"* is from the *Miscellaneous Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*.\n\n*\"Inferior virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.\"*\n**Commentary:** This speaks of the gradual decline of simplicity and virtue. The sage praises the wind of non-action, yet the people strive for progress in non-action, clinging to traces and falling short—hence \"inferior virtue.\" Striving for progress implies virtue can be named, hence \"does not lose virtue.\" Yet naming virtue leads to attachment; attachment corrupts simplicity, hence \"lacks virtue.\"\n\n*\"Supreme virtue practices non-action and has no purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** This further explains supreme virtue. Supreme virtue operates in hiddenness, governing through non-action; simplicity remains undivided, hence no trace of progress. Here, \"supreme virtue practices non-action\" means it embodies simplicity, naturally enacting non-action—not knowing the beauty of non-action and thus practicing it. Hence, \"has no purpose in doing so.\" Not only is there no progress to boast of, but even the intention to transform is absent. Thus the note says, *\"Both heart and trace are free of action.\"*\n\n*\"Inferior virtue acts and has purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** This further explains inferior virtue. \"Inferior virtue acts\" means it admires the transformative power of non-action and thus practices it—hence \"acts.\" Though the heart desires non-action, the trace reveals attachment—hence \"has purpose in doing so.\" Inferior virtue’s action has a reason for being. Thus the note says, *\"The heart is non-active, but the trace is active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme benevolence acts yet has no purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** Below, this clarifies that when the Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise. \"Supreme benevolence\" means taking benevolence as supreme; the rest follow this pattern. Benevolence is the name for universal love. When the great Dao prevails, things receive no private favor; as simplicity scatters, universal love remains. Here, it explains the practice of benevolence: \"supreme benevolence acts\"—practicing benevolence while forgetting benevolence, giving without seeking reward. Yet universal love cannot reach all, and this small kindness remains untrustworthy. Thus, the heart is always occupied—hence \"acts.\" The trace, however, approaches non-action—hence \"has no purpose in doing so.\" The note says, *\"Here, the heart is active, but the trace is non-active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme righteousness acts and has purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** Righteousness means appropriateness—cutting, shaping, and deciding so that things attain their proper place. When simplicity is already broken, right and wrong arise. To cut away wrong and affirm right, ensuring appropriateness, it is called \"supreme righteousness acts.\" The heart desires to cut away wrong and affirm right, acting with purpose—hence \"has purpose in doing so.\" The note says, *\"Here, both heart and trace are active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme ritual acts, yet none respond—then it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\"*\n**Commentary:** Ritual means conduct—what can be followed and practiced. *Zhuangzi* says, *\"Ritual is like wings, used to navigate the world.\"* The institution of ritual aims to remedy decline. Thus, the *Book of Rites* has three hundred rules, and the *Rites of Zhou* three thousand ceremonies—elaborate safeguards and detailed regulations. Once the pure source is lost, affairs compete in chaos. Ritual preserves external restraints, not the inner principle. Bowing and yielding elevate its forms; jade and silk display reciprocity. To give without return is not ritual; to receive without reciprocation is also not ritual.\n\nHere, when supreme ritual is performed yet none respond, one rolls up their sleeves in anger to compel compliance—hence the phrase *\"rolls up their sleeves to compel it.\"*\n\nThus, the Way is lost and then virtue follows; virtue is lost and then benevolence follows; benevolence is lost and then righteousness follows; righteousness is lost and then ritual follows.\n\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the origin of decline. *\"Losing the Way\"* refers to the highest virtue. The highest virtue aligns with the Way, hence it is called *\"losing the Way.\"* The preceding chapter states, *\"When the great Way is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.\"* *Zhuangzi* says, *\"The Way is obscured by petty achievements,\"* for the Way is never absent. Yet here it is called *\"lost\"*—this is in reference to people. When customs are pure, the great Way prevails; when customs are shallow, petty achievements arise. Once petty achievements arise, the great Way is obscured; when benevolence and righteousness are practiced, the highest virtue declines. This marks the divergence of worldly customs in their shallowness. The sage adapts to the times: as simplicity gradually dissipates, the Way is lost and then virtue follows; as virtue further declines, benevolence follows; with traces of universal love remaining, righteousness follows; when restraints are insufficient, ritual follows.\n\nTo discuss ritual in an age of simplicity is either madness or folly; to forget ritual in an age of shallowness is either stupidity or deceit. Thus, the sage’s intent to save the world never changes, yet the methods for peace or peril cannot be uniform.\n\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Now\"* introduces the point. When later sages practice ritual, it is to remedy the decline of loyalty and trust. If people embraced loyalty and trust, what need would there be for ritual laws? *\"The beginning of chaos\"* means that ritual prevents disorder, yet it can only be the starting point for governing chaos—not the transformative power of the Way.\n\n*\"Foreknowledge\"* is the flower of the Way and the beginning of folly.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Foreknowledge\"* refers to those who establish ritual. It is called *\"foreknowledge\"* because they create these external restraints before human nature’s inherent understanding. The Way flows with human nature, while ritual exists as external traces. Compared to the Way, it deviates from simplicity, hence it is the *\"flower of the Way.\"* *\"The beginning of folly\"*—ritual is meant to pacify chaos, addressing disorder to restore harmony and return to simplicity. Yet those who practice ritual in the world do not cultivate the inner nature but focus on external adornments. Reverence and love are lacking, while gifts and silks abound. This is not the insight of the enlightened but the beginning of folly. Hence, it is called *\"the beginning of folly.\"*\n\nTherefore, the great man abides in depth, not shallowness; dwells in substance, not ornament.\n\n**Commentary:** The *\"great man\"* is the noble person of the Way—the ruler of highest virtue mentioned earlier. *\"Depth and substance\"* refer to the effortless power of the Way and virtue; *\"shallowness and ornament\"* refer to the deliberate acts of ritual and righteousness. The sage prioritizes the transformative power of the Way and virtue, hence *\"abides in depth and substance,\"* and defers the teachings of ritual and righteousness, hence *\"does not dwell in ornament or shallowness.\"* Thus, *\"rejects that and embraces this.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"That\"* refers to ritual and righteousness; *\"this\"* refers to the Way and virtue. The sage rejects the superficiality of ritual and righteousness and embraces the depth of the Way and virtue. Yet in truth, the sage’s myriad considerations converge as one, and both extremes dissolve—how could there be *\"that\"* and *\"this\"* to reject or embrace? This is merely a teaching to guide the ordinary.\n\n**Chapter 39: Those of Old Who Obtained the One**\nThe previous chapter clarified the distinction between highest virtue and ritual, between simplicity and shallowness, hence it presented the great man’s choice to guide others toward the proper path. This chapter explains how things attain the function of the Way and are completed: when they tread the Way, they endure; when they boast of it, they perish. Thus, it recounts the humble virtue of lords and kings as the foundation of sincerity.\n\n*\"Those of old who obtained the One:\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Of old\"* refers to antiquity. *\"The One\"* is the harmonious qi. It is called *\"the One\"* because it unites with things, unchanging across past and present—hence *\"the One.\"* The *Book of Changes* states, *\"One yin and one yang are called the Way,\"* clarifying that the qi of the Way unites with yin when in yin and with yang when in yang. *\"Obtained of old\"* introduces the origin and traces the end, returning the branch to the root. Thus, it cites the ancient attainment to illustrate the present text. The principles of obtaining the One are outlined below.\n\n*\"Heaven obtained the One and became clear;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Among vast phenomena, none is greater than the primal qi of Heaven. Thus, it is first presented as the foremost of those who obtained the One. The pure yang qi, by obtaining the One, can arch broadly to cover and initiate the myriad things.\n\n*\"Earth obtained the One and became stable;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Among vast forms, none is greater than the pattern of Earth. The pure yin substance, by obtaining the One, can bear weight and nurture the myriad things.\n\n*\"The spirits obtained the One and became numinous;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Spirits\"* refers to the wondrous workings of the myriad things. By obtaining the One, they can transform without limit, beyond all form and inquiry.\n\n*\"The valleys obtained the One and became full;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Water flows into streams as brooks, and into brooks as valleys. When valleys obtain the One, their springs flow abundantly, ever full and inexhaustible.\n\n*\"The myriad things obtained the One and came to life;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Things\"* encompasses all—moving and still, sentient and insentient. By obtaining the harmonious qi, they can grow, move, and never cease.\n\n*\"Lords and kings obtained the One and became the norm for the world.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Lords and kings\"* are rulers. *\"Lords\"* are the ranks of the five nobles; *\"kings\"* are the lords of ten thousand chariots. When lords and kings obtain the One, they can perpetually govern the world, ensuring nothing is unserved, and become the standard of peace for the world. Some versions use *\"upright\"* (貞) instead of *\"norm\"* (正), but *\"upright\"* means *\"norm.\"*\n\n*\"This is how they attained it.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding meaning and introduces the following text.\n\nTo attain is to obtain. How do the clarity of heaven, the tranquility of earth, the numinous transformations of spirits, the fullness of valleys, the growth of things, and the upright peace of lords and kings come to be? All arise from the wondrous workings of obtaining the Dao. This clarifies the benefits of attaining the Dao. The following text elucidates the harms of losing the Dao.\n\nShould heaven lack the means to remain clear, it may fear splitting apart.\n**Commentary:** *\"Lack the means\"* is an expression of utmost sincerity. *\"Means\"* signifies use. Those who pride themselves on preservation lose, while those who cling to attainment forfeit. Heaven attains the Dao’s use to achieve clarity and lightness; if it fails to uphold the harmonious and tranquil Dao, merely priding itself on its clarity, it may fear breaking apart and losing its form.\n\nShould earth lack the means to remain tranquil, it may fear eruption.\n**Commentary:** Earth attains the Dao’s use to achieve stillness; it must forget its tranquility. If it prides itself on its stillness, it may fear erupting and losing its shape.\n\nShould spirits lack the means to remain numinous, they may fear exhaustion.\n**Commentary:** Spirits attain the Dao’s use to achieve boundless transformation; they must forget their essence. If they pride themselves on their numinosity, they may fear exhaustion and lose their wondrous workings.\n\nShould valleys lack the means to remain full, they may fear depletion.\n**Commentary:** Valleys attain the Dao’s use to achieve emptiness and receptivity; they must remain full. If they pride themselves on their fullness, they may fear drying up and losing their flowing nourishment.\n\nShould the myriad things lack the means to live, they may fear extinction.\n**Commentary:** The myriad things attain the Dao’s use to achieve growth; they must forget their life. If they pride themselves on possessing it, they may fear death and extinction, ceasing to be living spirits.\n\nShould lords and kings lack the means to remain noble and exalted, they may fear collapse.\n**Commentary:** *\"Collapse\"* means to stumble and fall. Lords and kings attain the Dao’s use to become rulers of the world; they must forget their loftiness and cultivate humility. If they pride themselves on their nobility, they may fear stumbling and failing to bring order to the world.\n\n**Annotation:** The sagely teachings have been passed down through the ages for the sake of living beings. Though it begins by citing the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth, it ultimately returns to exhorting lords and kings to embrace the feminine and employ the Dao. As the *Book* says, *\"Heaven generates the myriad things, but only humans are endowed with spirit.\"* The supreme sovereign acts as the parent of the people. Thus, the sagely teachings are directed toward the one ruler. Though it begins by warning heaven and earth to forget the merit of their clarity and tranquility, it ends by admonishing lords and kings not to pride themselves on their power to nurture and transform. The way of humility is fully expounded below.\n\nThus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation.\n**Commentary:** *\"Noble\"* and *\"high\"* refer to lords and kings; *\"lowly\"* and *\"low\"* refer to the common people. Lords and kings attain nobility through the common people, showing that the lowly and low are the root and foundation of the noble and high. As the *Book* says, *\"The people are the root of the state; when the root is firm, the state is at peace.\"* When a ruler diligently practices humility and gathers the people, it may be called securing the state’s root.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"To delight in their joyful harmony and threefold transformation\"*—the *Odes* say, *\"The joyful and harmonious lord is the parent of the people.\"* *\"Joyful\"* means delight; *\"harmonious\"* means ease. When a lord possesses the virtue of joy and ease, he nurtures the people, and the hundred clans long for him as children do for their mother. If his virtue is the opposite, the people will scatter.\n\nThus, lords and kings refer to themselves as *\"the solitary,\"* *\"the bereft,\"* and *\"the unworthy.\"* Is this not taking the lowly as their root? Is it not so?\n**Commentary:** *\"Thus\"* concludes the preceding meaning. When lords and kings refer to themselves as *\"the solitary,\"* *\"the bereft,\"* and *\"the unworthy,\"* as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Zuo*, *\"I and my two or three ministers grieve over the loss of our state,\"* or when they call themselves *\"the bereft one,\"* following the example of former rulers who deemed *\"the bereft one\"* worthy, or when they say *\"the unworthy,\"* for *\"unworthy\"* means *\"not good\"*—these three titles are what people despise, yet lords and kings place them at the forefront of their self-designations. This is humility in self-cultivation, not pride in their loftiness. *\"Is this not taking the lowly as their root?\"* asks whether this is indeed taking the lowly as their root. *\"Is it not so?\"* is a rhetorical question, to which the answer is: *\"Truly, it is taking the lowly as their root.\"*\n\nThus, counting the parts of a carriage yields no carriage.\n**Commentary:** *\"Thus\"* continues from the above. The preceding text clarifies that lords and kings attain nobility through the lowly, but nobility has no fixed form, and its principle is difficult to grasp. Thus, it borrows the example of a carriage’s parts to illustrate. When one counts all the parts of a carriage, there is ultimately no *\"carriage\"*—only wheels and shafts temporarily assembled to bear the name *\"carriage.\"* This analogy applies to lords and kings: counting the nobility of lords and kings ultimately yields no *\"nobility\"*—only the lowly, temporarily borrowed to constitute the nobility of lords and kings. Wheels and shafts are the root of the carriage; if the root is preserved, there is a carriage; if the root is lost, there is no carriage. The lowly are the root of nobility; if the root is preserved, there is rank; if the root is lost, there is no rank. This is meant to admonish lords and kings to cherish and nurture the people below and not abandon the solitary and forsaken.\n\nThey do not wish to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.\n**Commentary:** Jade is noble, and stone is lowly. To be *\"like jade\"* is to pride oneself on one’s nobility; to be *\"like stone\"* is to maintain humility. Since lords and kings take the lowly as their root, they should not wish to be lustrous like jade, priding themselves on their loftiness, but should instead be coarse like stone, preserving humility.\n\n**Chapter 40: \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that heaven and earth attain the One to warn against the harm of pride and attachment. This chapter elucidates the interplay of reality and expediency to expound the meaning of *\"returning to the constant.\"* Only by abandoning pride can one preserve the root of nobility; only by aligning with righteousness can one employ expediency. It aims to deepen understanding of the Dao’s emptiness and thus reaffirms its harmonious use.\n\nReversal is the movement of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** *\"Reversal\"* means to turn away from the vulgar; *\"movement\"* refers to change and transformation, signifying expediency. The multitude clings to life and loses the Dao, so the sage transforms and employs expediency to turn them away from the vulgar and toward the Dao.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"Reversal aligns with the constant and accords with righteousness\"*—*\"constant\"* means enduring; *\"righteousness\"* means fitting. Now, taking the lowly as the root of the noble and the low as the foundation of the high, or using non-being for being, initially seems contrary to common sentiment but ultimately aligns with the Dao. Thus, this is called the movement of the Dao.\n\nConfucius said, \"One may stand with them, yet not employ expediency with them.\" The expedient Way reverses the constant and is difficult to comprehend, so he offers the analogy of the *tangdi* flower, saying its blossoms first reverse and later align—thus illustrating how the expedient Way first opposes and later accords.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the true Way. People all despise weakness and prize strength, knowing that aggression and restlessness are the vulgar’s function. The Dao overcomes the rigid with softness and harmony, revealing that gentleness, weakness, femininity, and stillness are the Dao’s constant function. Thus it is said, \"Weakness is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nAll things under heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being.\n**Commentary:** All tangible things under heaven succeed one another through form, hence \"born of being.\" Yet when one exhausts the substance of being, it must rely on non-being. As the *Liezi* states: \"Form in motion cannot generate form but generates shadow; non-being in motion cannot generate non-being but generates being.\" Thus it is said, \"Emptiness is the root of heaven and earth; non-being is the source of the myriad things.\" This is spoken to urge beings to trace the source, recognize the root, and awaken to the Dao.\n\nSince being and non-being are thus, the real and the expedient are likewise. Hence the annotation states: \"The real in relation to the expedient is like non-being giving rise to being.\" It further says: \"The ultimate Dao is empty and tranquil, beyond all names\"—referring to the emptiness of dharmas’ nature, which does not depend on conditions. The essence of the Dao in its utmost reaches is profoundly empty, serene, and still, neither expedient nor real. How could it be named? In the true nature of dharmas, there is neither being nor non-being; affairs transcend mutual dependence. The statements \"things are born of being; being is born of non-being\" are all provisional expressions. If one knows that counting a chariot is not the chariot itself, one likewise knows that counting dharmas is not the dharmas themselves. How could there be real and expedient to speak of as generating one another? One who awakens to this principle may be said to have attained liberation.\n\n*Preface to Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Five, Concluded*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Six: \"The Superior Person Hears of the Dao\" (Chapter Forty-One)*\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidated the two gates of the expedient and the real, which are the dynamic functions of the Dao. This chapter clarifies that the luminous Dao appears obscure, and only the superior person diligently practices it.\n\nFirst, it distinguishes the three types of persons who hear of the Dao, whose belief or rejection differs. Next, it establishes the teachings below to illuminate the path of cultivating the Dao and virtue. Finally, from \"Only the Dao\" onward, it concludes with the efficacious workings of bestowing goodness.\n\nThe superior person, upon hearing of the Dao, diligently practices it.\n*Commentary:* The person of highest wisdom, possessing deep insight and penetrating discernment, upon hearing of the Dao—whether its expedient aspect as subtle illumination or its real aspect as gentle weakness—puts it into practice without laxity. Thus, it is said they \"diligently practice it.\"\n\nThe middling person, upon hearing of the Dao, wavers between belief and disbelief.\n*Commentary:* The person of middling capacity, whose clarity and obscurity remain unresolved, upon hearing of the wondrous Dao, sometimes believes and sometimes doubts. When perceiving its clarity, they believe and uphold it; when perceiving its obscurity, they doubt and hesitate. Their resolve is not yet decisive, hence it is said they \"waver between belief and disbelief.\"\n\nThe inferior person, upon hearing of the Dao, laughs greatly at it.\n*Commentary:* The inferior person, whose understanding does not reach the principle, upon hearing of the Dao, does not believe it, deeming it empty and absurd, and thus ridicules it. This is like ceremonial caps being despised by the people of Yue, or uncut jade being rejected in the state of Chu. As *Zhuangzi* states: \"A narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao.\"\n\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.\n*Commentary:* The profound Dao is recondite and deeply unfathomable. Though luminous, it appears obscure, its principle contrary to common sentiment. The inferior person, benighted and foolish, thus laughs at it. If it were not laughed at by the inferior person, it would not be called subtle and profound; it would merely be a shallow and vulgar teaching, insufficient to be called the Dao. It is not a conventional worldly dharma, and thus is mocked by the common and foolish—precisely because it is the wondrous Dao.\n\nIt is thus established in the teachings:\n*Commentary:* \"Established\" means to set forth. Here, words are set forth to explain the superior person’s diligent practice of the Dao, the middling person’s wavering between belief and disbelief, and the inferior person’s great laughter. \"In the teachings\" refers to the following elucidations of the Dao and the like.\n\nThe luminous Dao appears obscure.\n*Commentary:* \"Luminous\" means clear and penetrating; \"obscure\" means dim and dark. The practitioner of the Dao and virtue nurtures clarity through obscurity, relinquishing form and discarding cunning, yet is in truth clear and penetrating. Thus, it is said to \"appear obscure.\" The superior person diligently practices it, appearing obscure in their clarity, while the inferior person, failing to comprehend, laughs at it. The middling person, upon first hearing of the luminous Dao, believes it and thus \"appears to uphold it,\" but upon later hearing of its obscurity, doubts it and thus \"appears to abandon it.\"\n\nAdvancing in the Dao appears as retreat.\n*Commentary:* The person advancing in the Dao has no arising thoughts within and forgets all external affairs. Their merit and fame diminish daily, and great accomplishment appears incomplete. The inferior person, observing this, sees it as akin to retreat and failure.\n\nThe level Dao appears uneven.\n*Commentary:* \"Level\" means even and smooth; \"uneven\" refers to irregularities in silk. The person whose mind is clear and tranquil, free from dust and desire, is open and even, without boundaries among things, yet outwardly appears like silk with knots and flaws.\n\nSupreme virtue appears as a valley.\n*Commentary:* The diligent practitioner is called a person of supreme virtue. Their virtue is fully manifest, and being fully manifest, it contains and embraces all things. Thus, it is said to \"appear as a valley.\"\n\nGreat purity appears sullied.\n*Commentary:* \"Purity\" means untainted; \"sullied\" means defiled. The one who attains the untainted Dao conceals their traces and mingles with the dust, hence is said to \"appear sullied,\" yet in truth remains purely untainted, uniquely whole and complete.\n\nVast virtue appears insufficient.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s virtue extends to all without exception. Yet, abiding in softness and practicing humility, they always appear insufficient. As the *Records of the Historian* states: \"A skilled merchant deeply conceals their wealth, appearing empty; the noble person of abundant virtue appears foolish.\" Thus, it appears foolish and insufficient.\n\nEstablished virtue appears as theft.\n*Commentary:* \"Established\" means to erect; \"theft\" refers to stealing. The person who establishes hidden virtue practices secretly and cultivates in obscurity, as if fearing discovery, like one who has been robbed. Thus, it is said to \"appear as theft.\"\n\nAuthentic reality appears altered.\n*Commentary:* \"Authentic\" means pure and unified; \"altered\" means changed. The practitioner of the Dao and virtue possesses virtue that is pure and without pretense, yet appears as if subject to change, flowing with things and harmonizing with their brilliance.\n\nGreat squareness has no corners.\n*Commentary:* \"Squareness\" means uprightness; \"corners\" means angles. To hone one’s reputation and establish integrity, creating edges and corners, is the way of those who seek to teach others—it is not the way of the person of great squareness. Unaffected by grinding, unstained by black dye, this is great squareness. Yet, it can harmonize with brilliance and mingle with the dust, without setting itself apart. Thus, it is said that \"great squareness has no corners.\"\n\nThe great vessel is late in completion.\n*Commentary:* That which fulfills all uses is called a vessel. A vessel completed late can become great. Thus, the superior person diligently practices, accumulating merit to attain realization, achieving it gradually, not in a single morning or evening. Hence, it is said to be \"late in completion.\"\n\nThe great sound is rarely heard.\n*Commentary:* The Dao can respond to all sounds—this is the great sound. Yet, when listened for, it has no sound—this is the rare sound. By analogy, the sage expounds the One Vehicle, and the Dharma sound pervades all, responding only when there is resonance. Thus, it is said to be \"rarely heard.\"\n\nThe great image has no form.\n*Commentary:* Those who cling to form and instruments are confined to one direction. Only the Dao of the great image, fundamentally without form or substance, responds to stimuli and can manifest all forms. Thus, it is said that \"the great image has no form.\"\n\nThe Dao is hidden and without name.\n*Commentary:* When considering its pervasive generation, it is forcibly called the Dao; when forgetting its function, it is hidden and nameless. Seeking to inscribe its essence with a name, yet its wondrous root is without form, thus its essence cannot be named. Hence, it is said that \"the Dao is hidden and without name.\"\n\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the efficacious workings of the Dao. \"Only\" means singular; \"bestowing\" means giving. It sighs in admiration that though this Dao is nameless and without form, without sound or image, it alone can distribute qi and effect transformation, bestowing upon and completing the myriad things. Thus, it is said to be \"good at bestowing and completing.\"\n\n*Chapter Forty-Two: \"The Dao Gives Birth to One\"*\nThe preceding chapter clarified the Dao heard by the three types of persons, which gives birth to the myriad things. This chapter elucidates the origin of the generation and transformation of the myriad things, which necessarily relies on the three qi. First, it clarifies that the harmonious qi is gentle and weak, enabling the myriad things to embrace it and thereby attain harmony.\n\nNext, it states \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy,\" admonishing kings and dukes to abide in humility. It concludes with \"the strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end,\" demonstrating the origin of cultivation and learning.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\n\n*Commentary:* The Dao is the divine source of utmost emptiness; the One is the essence of harmonious qi. \"Gives birth\" means to move and emerge. It speaks of the Dao moving forth harmonious qi to give life to things. Yet the principle of responsive transformation is not yet complete, so it further generates yang qi. Accumulating yang qi to form the One, this is called the Two. Pure yang cannot further generate yin qi, so accumulating yin to form the Two, this is called the Three. \"Gives birth to the myriad things\" means that when yin and yang intermingle in harmony and the harmonious qi transforms into purity, it universally generates the ten thousand beings. This clarifies the meaning of the Dao’s efficacious bestowal and life-giving completion.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the harmonious qi.\n\n*Commentary:* It speaks of the birth of things, which, having relied on the harmonious qi of yin and yang to attain completion, must bear yin qi, embrace yang qi, and cherish the harmonious qi to maintain softness and harmony. Thus, the Broadly Accomplished Master told the Yellow Emperor, \"I guard the One and embrace harmony, so I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years without my form ever declining.\" From this, we know that the primal qi of harmonious balance is what the multitude of beings depend upon. Laozi presents this to show that since humans are endowed with harmonious qi at birth, qi is the root of life, and people should therefore abide in softness and gentleness, embracing weakness to preserve their root.\n\nWhat people detest are only \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy,\" yet kings and dukes take these as their titles.\n\n*Commentary:* Harmonious qi is soft and weak, the root of life. Thus, it cites kings and dukes practicing humility to reinforce this root. \"Orphaned, widowed, and unworthy\" are inauspicious names, not honorific titles, and are what people detest. Yet kings and dukes take them as their titles—this is the intent of humility. Kings and dukes are the leaders of moral transformation, upon whom the survival or demise of the realm depends. All under heaven look to them. If they do not esteem humility and softness to stabilize the altars of state, the people will not turn to them. Thus, humility and softness are the foundation for achieving towering merit.\n\nTherefore, things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Therefore\" continues from the above. \"Diminished\" means to belittle oneself. It speaks of kings and dukes calling themselves \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy\" to diminish themselves, thereby causing the people to joyfully support, respect, and serve them, resulting in gain. \"Augmented yet lose\" refers to kings and dukes who, valuing and indulging themselves, become arrogant in their high position, causing the people below to disperse and thus incur loss. As the *Book of Documents* says, \"Arrogance invites loss; humility receives gain\"—this is what it means.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach as my principle.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Others\" refers to rulers, who are the heads of governance and education, upon whom the customs of a state depend, transforming through the influence of one person. Thus, Laozi declares: If a ruler wishes to implement verbal instruction to transform the people, they must employ my principle of emptiness, softness, and weakness to teach them.\n\nThe strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Strong and overbearing\" refers to those who are violent and obstinate. Such violent individuals lose the essentials of nurturing life and forfeit their heavenly mandate, failing to meet their natural end. The Perfected Immortal Yan said, \"The strong Qin perished through tyranny; the great Han prospered through harmony and compliance.\" The strong and overbearing lose the Dao; the rigid and martial lose their spirit. Once the master of life retreats, how can they long endure? The annotation states: \"Moving in opposition to things, things may strike back.\" \"Opposition\" means resistance. \"Things strike back\" refers to the *Yi Jing*’s *Yi* hexagram, top nine line, which says, \"No one augments them; someone strikes them.\"\n\nI shall take this as the father of teaching.\n\nHere the essence of cultivation and learning is distilled. Lord Lao cites the demise of the strong and overbearing as a warning, and the preservation of the supple and weak as an encouragement. Calling this the \"father of teaching\" means that, just as the father is the root of the child, I shall take this teaching of suppleness as the foundation of all teachings—like a father to his children, hence \"father of teaching.\"\n\n**Chapter 43: The Softest in the World**\nThe previous chapter revealed how beings, turning their backs on the Dao and acting with violence, fail to meet their natural end. This chapter instructs people to rectify their nature through suppleness, for in cultivating it, one merges with the Dao. Though their paths differ, their principles converge, returning to the same end. It begins by setting forth the inherent suppleness of the Dao’s nature, for if one attains it but then loses it, the fault lies in becoming rigid and strong. The passage from \"I therefore know\" onward clarifies the Dao of non-action, which brings boundless benefit, surpassing all other teachings.\n\nThe softest in the world rides forth and masters the hardest in the world.\n*Commentary:* The true nature of humanity is originally pure and clear, with harmonious qi dwelling within—this is the softest. But if one races after desires, becoming stained by worldly dust and lured by sounds and sights, the true nature scatters, becoming the hardest. \"Nothingness enters where there is no gap.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Nothingness\" means that when one awakens to the illusory nature of all dharmas and realizes their emptiness, one returns to the true nature and unites with the Dao, entering the gapless. \"Gapless\" is the Dao. \"Entering\" means merging with the Dao. To say the Dao is \"gapless\" is to clarify that the nature of the Dao is pure and still, utterly boundless, without the slightest crevice.\n\nI therefore know the benefit of non-action.\n*Commentary:* Here, \"I\" is Lord Lao speaking. This chapter also universally admonishes rulers to govern the world through non-action. Lord Lao says: I see that the true nature of beings is supple and weak, yet when they race and compete, they become utterly rigid. If they could illuminate their minds and circumstances, realizing that all is empty, they would merge with the Dao. Thus, I know that governing body and state through purity and non-action brings benefit to all. By analogy, the teachings of action cannot compare to the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world can match it.\n*Commentary:* The supreme Dao is wordless, yet all things are born through it. The sage acts not, yet transforms through purity. Thus, it does not wait for words to become teaching. \"Few in the world can match it\" means that among the nine schools and hundred lineages, few can equal the teaching of non-action. It also means that unless one is a ruler who embodies the Dao, none can attain it—hence, it is called \"rare.\"\n\n**Chapter 44: Name or Self—Which is Closer?**\nThe previous chapter showed how the true nature, when supple, becomes rigid through racing and competition. This chapter clarifies the closeness or distance of fame and wealth, and how attachment to hoarding brings calamity. The first three lines pose questions about gain and loss; the next two detail the causes of disaster. The final \"knowing contentment\" urges one to abide by one’s lot, ensuring longevity.\n\nName or self—which is closer?\n*Commentary:* This compares name with self. \"Which\" means \"who.\" The question asks: Between striving for fame and preserving life, which aligns with the way of preserving truth and longevity? It laments that people of this age cannot forget fame to preserve the self.\n\nSelf or wealth—which is more?\n*Commentary:* \"More\" implies what is more valuable. Between self and wealth, which is more worthy of esteem? This is said to awaken one to the greater value of the self, so that one does not prize wealth. *Annotation:* \"Cast aside jade, shatter pearls\" is a phrase from the *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters.\n\nGain or loss—which brings suffering?\n*Commentary:* This summarizes the two questions above: between gaining fame and wealth or losing them, which brings suffering? Gaining fame and wealth means losing the self; preserving the self means losing fame and wealth. Their outcomes are clearly distinct—suffering is evident. Yet deluded beings fail to perceive this first, so the following text elaborates.\n\nThus, excessive love incurs great cost; excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.\n*Commentary:* These two lines answer the previous questions. \"Excessive love incurs great cost\" responds to \"name or self—which is closer?\" \"Cost\" means loss; \"closer\" means love. Excessive love of fame distorts one’s nature, depleting the spirit. The more one loves, the greater the cost. \"Excessive hoarding invites heavy loss\" responds to \"self or wealth—which is more?\" The more one hoards, the heavier the loss. The harm of coveting jade is like holding a sword; the peril of possessing pearls is like embracing a wall. The tombs in the *Book of Songs* were robbed for their pearls—let the ruin brought by wealth serve as a profound warning.\n\nKnowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop averts danger—thus one may endure long.\n*Commentary:* \"Disgrace\" means harm and entanglement; \"danger\" means peril and ruin. Not pursuing fame is knowing contentment; not amassing wealth is knowing when to stop. Knowing contentment ensures one’s name matches reality without excess. Knowing when to stop ensures one does not hoard wealth, avoiding the harm of greed. Free from disgrace and peril, one may long endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Great Perfection Seems Lacking**\nThe previous chapter showed how self and wealth differ in closeness, and how attachment to hoarding brings calamity. This chapter teaches that caution in fullness is like deficiency, so its use never exhausts. The first seven lines establish the model for conduct; the next two clarify the superiority of stillness over restlessness. The final \"purity and stillness\" concludes that purity and stillness can rectify the world.\n\nGreat perfection seems lacking, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n*Commentary:* For all learners, when their merit and conduct reach great perfection and all virtues are complete, they must remain humble and forgetful, as if flawed. Then their abilities will never be exhausted. The ruler who embodies the Dao in great perfection is likewise: his achievements equal the creative power of heaven and earth, his virtue matches the illumination of sun and moon. His accomplishments are vast—hence \"great perfection.\" Yet he does not rely on his perfection, appearing as if lacking. In this way, his use is inexhaustible.\n\nGreat fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n*Commentary:* \"Empty\" means vacuous. \"Exhausted\" means depleted. This clarifies that the sage, though his emoluments and rank are full, cultivates reverence and frugality, never allowing himself to be full and overflowing—hence he seems empty and vacuous. As it is said: \"Having seems as if not having; fullness seems as if emptiness.\" Thus his application is without end or depletion.\n\nGreat straightness seems bent;\n*Commentary:* \"Straight\" means upright. \"Bent\" means crooked. The preceding four lines jointly clarify substance and function; the following three lines only present their substance, without stating their function. The text is abbreviated to reveal the meaning, and the rest may be inferred by analogy. To purify oneself while defiling others, to promote the upright while setting aside the crooked—this is petty straightness. Not clinging to right to dispute wrong, not rectifying oneself to correct others—this is great straightness. Adapting flexibly to circumstances, hence it is said to seem bent. The *Commentary* states: \"Upright yet not unrestrained\"—this is from the \"Dao Classic\" in the first scroll.\n\nGreat skill seems clumsy;\n*Commentary:* Displaying embellished craftsmanship, flaunting the marvels of compass and square—this is petty skill. Utilizing resources as they are, allowing things to achieve success naturally, without losing their proper measure—this is great skill. Without carving or cutting, its achievement unseen, it appears as if unrefined and clumsy. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Creation carves and sculpts the myriad forms yet is not considered skillful.\"\n\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\n*Commentary:* Combining metaphors and adorned phrases, knotting cords and weaving sentences—this is petty eloquence. Practicing the teaching without words, eloquently carving the myriad things, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—this is great eloquence. The ultimate word transcends words, without emphasis or suppression, like one who is halting and tongue-tied.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.\n*Commentary:* This presents an analogy to illustrate the teaching. Those who cling to completion will surely fail; those who hold to fullness will surely topple. Thus the sage’s achievements benefit the world, yet he does not appear successful—hence he seems lacking, and so his use is without flaw. Though his position is exalted above ten thousand chariots, he does not regard his rank as complete—hence he seems empty, and so he is inexhaustible. Fearing that people may not understand, he borrows the movement and stillness of yang qi to illustrate. \"Restlessness\" means movement. \"Overcomes\" means extremity. It is said: In spring and summer, yang qi emerges above the earth, and the myriad things thereby live. When yang qi’s movement reaches its extreme, it becomes cold, and cold causes the myriad things to wither and die. This clarifies that restlessness is the root of death, and excess is the source of decline. It illustrates that those whose achievements are complete yet not lacking will fail, those who hold to fullness yet are not empty will topple, and those who act with rigidity and restlessness will surely die.\n\n\"Stillness overcomes heat\" means: In autumn and winter, yang qi is still beneath the Yellow Springs. When stillness reaches its extreme, it becomes heat, and heat gives rise to harmonious qi. The myriad things thereby live, their life arising from stillness. Thus we know stillness is the root of life and also the ruler of restlessness. The analogy is taken from great completion and great fullness: by being able to seem lacking and empty, they are without flaw or exhaustion, thereby attaining life. Those who can practice non-action and stillness thereby grasp the root of life. This urges people to pursue stillness to seek life, not to lightly indulge in restlessness and hasten toward death.\n\nPurity and stillness rectify the world.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the preceding meaning. The sage observes the advance and retreat of the numinous yang qi, knowing that restlessness is the source of hastening toward death, while stillness is the root of life. Governing human affairs and nurturing the multitude of beings, he holds to the root to govern the branches, devoting himself to the Way of purity and stillness. Thus he can rectify the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World Follows the Dao**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified the conduct of the five great ones, broadening the gateway for cultivating learning. This chapter clarifies the three great transgressions, revealing the harms of desire. It first sets forth the benefits and harms of a world with or without the Dao, then clarifies the origins of crime and fault, and finally concludes with the virtue of knowing contentment, to caution against the calamities born of greed.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to manure the fields.\n*Commentary:* \"Retired\" means set aside. \"Manure\" means to cultivate the fields. \"When the world follows the Dao\" means governing with the Dao, practicing non-action, and transforming through it. Guarding the four frontiers, the borders are at peace, and there is no need to covet more land to burden the common people. Thus the affairs of arms and warhorses are set aside, and people can begin plowing the southern fields to cultivate their gardens.\n\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao, warhorses breed on the outskirts.\n*Commentary:* \"Outskirts\" means the border, the defensive ground between two states’ frontiers. When the world lacks rulers who employ the Dao, then the wild frontiers have unruly barbarians. Thus the military horses breed on the outskirts, meaning they remain there for a long time without returning.\n\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\n*Commentary:* \"Crime\" means violating the law; \"desire\" means covetousness. It is said: The crime of warhorses breeding on the outskirts arises from the ruler’s covetousness for land. Seeing land as desirable, the desire stirs, and greed arises. This is the greatest crime—hence \"no crime is greater than indulging desire.\"\n\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment;\n*Commentary:* \"Calamity\" means harm, the lack of divine protection. From what does the calamity of ruin and defeat arise? From coveting land, seeking without satiety, not knowing moderation—this causes the divine way not to protect, and thus one incurs harm. Human transgressions are not of one kind, but greed brings the greatest calamity.\n\nNo fault is greater than desiring to acquire.\n*Commentary:* \"Fault\" means misfortune. The bold in greed, their desires ever increasing, never cease once they obtain, but seek further. If they acquire by improper means, they will swiftly bring misfortune upon themselves—is this not fitting? \"Indulging desire\" means desiring what one has not yet obtained, the initial stirring of greed, a crime lighter than calamity. \"Not knowing contentment\" means obtaining yet still demanding more, a calamity heavier than crime. \"No fault is greater than desiring to acquire\" means: having already obtained what was sought, yet the desire remains insatiable—then the fault of this transgression is even greater than calamity.\n\nThus the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the meaning of the ruler who follows the Dao. It is said: The ruler who follows the Dao has no desire for expansion, does not covet land, is firmly rooted in his proper share, and knows contentment. Thus he is joyfully upheld by the world, his person secure and his state well-ordered. This contentment of knowing contentment extends even to yielding—hence it is ever content.\n\nThe annotation states: \"Contentment in things is not true contentment; contentment in the heart is true contentment.\" True contentment means sufficiency lies in the heart, not in external things. Abiding by one’s limits and guarding one’s proper share, though little may seem much; insatiable desire, though much may still seem little.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Venturing Forth**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when the world follows the Dao, knowing contentment brings everlasting sufficiency. This chapter elucidates that teaching without venturing forth demonstrates accomplishment through non-action.\n\nThe first two lines declare that not venturing forth enables knowledge of the world. The next two lines show that harmony among people brings the world into accord. The following two lines illustrate that the farther one ventures, the less one knows. The final four lines conclude that non-action brings transformation to fulfillment.\n\n\"Not venturing forth from the door, one knows the world.\"\n*Commentary:* The sagely ruler who embodies the Dao governs through non-action. Though his teachings do not extend beyond his door, pure virtue naturally pervades the realm—this may be called knowing the way to govern the world.\n\nAnother interpretation: When the ruler’s governance of the world is good, the response is likewise good. Thus, without the trouble of venturing forth, the world may be known. As the *Book of Changes* states: \"When a noble one speaks, if his words are good, they resonate even a thousand *li* away—how much more so with those nearby?\" This is the meaning.\n\n\"Not peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\"\n*Commentary:* When human and Heaven respond to each other, essence and *qi* intermingle. If the ruler governs with virtue, celestial patterns remain unconfused; if he violates the Five Phases, *yin* and *yang* fall into disorder. Thus the *Book of Documents* states: \"Auspicious omens bring timely rain and harmonious winds; inauspicious omens bring constant fog and errant gales.\" From this, we know that actions originate within oneself, while their signs manifest in Heaven—why wait to peer through the window to see them? As the *Book of Changes* says: \"Words and deeds are how the noble one moves Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n\"The farther one ventures, the less one knows.\"\n*Commentary:* This describes the ruler who has lost the Dao. Unable to abide in non-action and humble himself, he seeks to extend his teachings to transform others. The farther his commands reach, the more he strays from non-action, and the less he understands governance.\n\nThus the sage \"knows without going forth.\"\n*Commentary:* This reiterates that not venturing forth enables knowledge of the world. Without affairs or action, teachings do not extend beyond the door—hence \"without going forth.\" Drawing near to observe oneself, one comprehends things to come. Thus, through my non-action, people transform themselves—why wait for teachings to venture forth before calling it knowledge?\n\n\"Names without seeing.\"\n*Commentary:* This reiterates that not peering through the window enables seeing the Way of Heaven. When the crane cries, its mate responds; when stimulated, Heaven moves. From the small, one may know the great; by examining oneself, one may know others. The auspiciousness summoned depends on the person—thus the governance of Great Peace may be spoken of without seeing. Why insist on peering to name it? Hence, \"names without seeing.\"\n\n\"Accomplishes without acting.\"\n*Commentary:* This summarizes the meaning of not venturing forth and not peering. Where there is action above, there is disturbance below. Now the sage concentrates his spirit and sits in solemn silence within the court. The ruler practices non-action, the people have no affairs, households are well-provided, and the myriad transformations naturally come to fruition.\n\n**Chapter 48: Daily Advancement in Learning**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that not venturing forth and not peering enables knowledge of governance. This chapter elucidates that in learning and embodying the Dao, one reaches the state of non-action.\n\nThe first two lines demonstrate the gradual process of cultivation and forgetting. The next three lines clarify the benefits of diminishing the existent to return to the non-existent. The final four lines conclude the meaning, warning that busyness is insufficient to transform others.\n\n\"In learning, one advances daily; in embodying the Dao, one diminishes daily.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Learning\" means cultivation. \"Diminishing\" means forgetting and reducing. At the outset of cultivation, one daily seeks knowledge and experience as advancement. When advancing toward the Dao, one forgets and reduces practices and actions—why is this? In learning, one initially relies on study to understand the Dao, cultivating merit to amend faults. Ultimately, one awakens to principle and forgets words, relinquishes merit and abandons attachments. Thus the annotation states: \"Advancing in knowledge and experience is the beginning of cultivating the Dao\"—this refers to the initial stage. \"Diminishing merit and action is the gateway to awakening to the Dao\"—this refers to the final stage.\n\n\"Diminish and again diminish, to reach non-action.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Diminish\" refers to reducing the merit and actions of one who embodies the Dao. \"Again diminish\" means eliminating the mind that forgets merit and action. This entails first forgetting traces, then forgetting the mind. When both mind and traces are forgotten, one may be said to have reached the ultimate—thus arriving at non-action.\n\n\"Non-action, yet nothing is not done.\"\n*Commentary:* Where there is action, there is obstruction; where there is obstruction, there are things left undone. Now, since there is non-action, non-action means no obstruction—hence nothing is left undone. This is called harmonizing with the Dao, responding and acting universally. Thus the preceding passage states: \"The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\"\n\n\"To govern the world, one must constantly practice non-affairs.\"\n*Commentary:* This exhorts the ruler to practice non-action. \"Govern\" means to transform and guide. To transform and guide the world, one must practice non-action and engage in non-affairs. With non-affairs, the people below are not disturbed; with non-action, the hundred clans are naturally at peace. Ruling with this, what cannot be achieved? \"Constantly\" means that governing through non-action must never be departed from, even for a moment.\n\n\"When there are affairs, it is insufficient to govern the world.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Affairs\" refers to onerous policies and dense prohibitions. Harsh commands disturb the people; dense nets multiply punishments. The hundred clans are not at peace, and the four directions scatter—seeking to transform and guide them, is this not difficult? Thus, busyness is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Six, concludes.*\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Seven.*\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Mind**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that embodying the Dao entails daily diminishing, demonstrating the gateway of cultivation and forgetting. This chapter elucidates that the sage has no fixed mind, illustrating the function of responding to things with an empty heart.\n\nThe first six lines declare that the sage has no fixed mind in responding to things.\n\nThe next two lines illustrate how the sage blends with the world while employing the heart-mind. The final two lines conclude the reason the hundred clans return to goodness, clarifying the sage’s virtue of impartial nurturance.\n\nThe sage has no constant mind, taking the hearts of the hundred clans as his own heart.\n*Commentary:* The sage is empty and forgetful; things move him to respond. Response necessarily follows stimulus, and since stimuli are not uniform, his responses have no constant mind. Though his mind has no constancy, his intent remains in compassionate salvation. The hundred clans possess hearts of unbelief and ungoodness, so he blends his heart with theirs to transform and guide them—hence it is said he has no constant mind.\n\nThose who are good, I treat with goodness,\n*Commentary:* This is the principle of response and stimulus. *I* refers to the sage. Those who are good are hearts turned toward the correct Dao; the sage encourages them to advance in cultivation, bringing their conduct to fruition so that they attain the great goodness of forgetting goodness.\n\nThose who are not good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue becomes goodness.\n*Commentary:* The not-good are those whose habits deepen delusion, who trust in evil and turn from the Dao; the sage also draws them with the good Dao. *Virtue becomes goodness* means they are transformed by the sage’s virtue to become good.\n\nThose who are trustworthy, I trust,\n*Commentary:* Trustworthy means hearing the Dao and practicing it diligently, with no doubt or attachment; the sage responds with utmost sincerity, affirming their goodness so that they attain profound trust.\n\nThose who are untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue becomes trustworthiness.\n*Commentary:* Untrustworthy refers to the stubborn and rebellious who oppose the teachings; the sage also transforms them with impartial, correct trust, so that they are transformed by the sage’s virtue to abandon falsity and return to trust. Hence it is said *virtue becomes trustworthiness.*\n\nThe sage in the world is ever vigilant, blending his heart with the world.\n*Commentary:* This clarifies how the sage blends with the world while employing the heart-mind. *Vigilant* means diligent and concerned. The sage, governing the world and overseeing all within the four seas, fears that sentient beings will not return to goodness and trust, so he is ever vigilant for the world. Since the hundred clans cannot yet trust and be good, the sage blends with them and employs his heart—hence it is said he blends his heart with the world.\n\nThe hundred clans all fix their ears and eyes [upon him],\n*Commentary:* When the hundred clans are transformed by the sage’s virtue to return to goodness, they observe customs with pure simplicity, so they all turn their ears and eyes to observe and listen, taking the sage as their model.\n\nThe sage treats them all as children.\n*Commentary:* Since the hundred clans fix their ears and eyes to observe and listen to the sage, the sage regards them as a compassionate mother does her infant—hence it is said he treats them all as children. Another interpretation: The hundred clans have discriminating minds; the sage transforms them to uniformly follow goodness, making them like infants without discrimination.\n\n**Chapter 50: Emerging from Life, Entering Death**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that the sage has no fixed mind, blending his heart to respond to goodness and trust. This chapter elucidates emerging from life and entering death, revealing the gateway to skillfully guarding against affliction and entanglement.\n\nThe first five lines mark those who dwell in timeliness and follow what is fitting. The next five lines clarify the deeply transformed and those who seek transformation. The final eight lines conclude the practice of skillful guarding, pointing to the gateway of long life and enduring vision.\n\nEmerging from life, entering death.\n*Commentary:* Those who thoroughly comprehend life and death do not cling to life—this is called *emerging from life.* Those who are deluded and attached to self and others, moving toward the realm of death—this is called *entering death.* This marks the chapter’s theme.\n\nOf those who live, thirteen in ten [follow this way],\n*Commentary:* *Those* refers to types. This broadly discusses sentient beings who can dwell in the principle of life, not prizing themselves, adapting to their time of coming, and harboring no attachments. Of such, broadly speaking, three in ten follow this way. This means those who follow principle are few, while those who oppose it are many.\n\nOf those who die, thirteen in ten [follow this way].\n*Commentary:* This also broadly discusses those who understand the way of death, not resisting transformation, adapting to their departure as fitting, and harboring no fear. Of such, three in ten also follow this way.\n\nOf those who in life move toward the realm of death, thirteen in ten [follow this way].\n*Commentary:* This explains those who are deluded and attached, the types who lose the principle of nurturing life. Though people desire to cultivate life, they cannot comprehend it; their actions lead them to the realm of death. Having lost the principle of nurturing life and deviated from the way of following death, of such, three in ten also follow this way.\n\nWhy is this?\n*Commentary:* This poses the question of why sentient beings move toward the realm of death.\n\nBecause of their excessive clinging to life.\n*Commentary:* This answers directly: Those who move toward the realm of death do so because they are mired in contrivance, drowning in emotion and indulging desire, excessively nurturing themselves to preserve life. Their nurturance is too excessive, so their actions lead them to the realm of death.\n\nNow, I have heard that those who skillfully guard life\n*Commentary:* *Guard* means protect. Those who skillfully protect life with the Dao profoundly observe life’s root, which is originally pure and still. They forget life in life, not allowing emotions and desires to disturb their harmony, nurturing their nature only with emptiness and tranquility. Nothing can harm them—hence they are called *those who skillfully guard life.*\n\nWhen traveling by land, they do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by weapons.\n*Commentary:* *Encounter* means an unplanned meeting. According to the *Classic of Mountains and Seas,* the rhinoceros emerges south of the Xiang River, its color dark and black.\n\nThe *Erya* states: \"Its form resembles a wild ox, with a single horn, weighing a thousand *jin*.\" Those who skillfully guard life do not harbor harmful intentions toward other beings. Thus, when traveling by land, they do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by weapons. For tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons likewise lack any intent to harm. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades.\n\n*Commentary:* The preceding passage clarifies that those who skillfully guard life harbor no harmful intentions within, and thus do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers externally. Here, it further explains that even if they were to encounter such dangers, these would lack any intent to harm. Naturally, there would be no place for them to apply their claws, horns, or blades. From this, we know that those who forget their emotions toward external things may tame and befriend seabirds on the shore or lead land beasts by a tether to wander freely—how much less could harm come to them? Thus, it does not occur.\n\nWhy is this so?\n*Commentary:* This asks why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons—things that harm people—do not thrust their claws, horns, or blades, leaving no place for their weapons to lodge. It poses this question to enlighten others. The reason is that they have no ground of death.\n\n*Commentary:* This is the direct answer. Those who perceive themselves as substantial are burdened; those who excessively indulge in life’s nurturance invite death. Now, those who skillfully guard life illuminate the emptiness of dharmic nature and awaken to the illusory nature of form. Thus, they forget life in life and avoid the excesses of over-nurturance. Without self-interest, they follow transformation, and so there is no ground of death for them to inhabit. Since their minds harbor no ground of death, how could tigers, rhinoceroses, or weapons harm them?\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Them Life**\nThe preceding chapter expounded on emerging from life and entering death, revealing the gateway to transcending suffering and entanglement. This chapter clarifies how the Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, without domination yet naturally honored. It begins by praising the wondrous origin’s responsive efficacy in generating and completing. Next, it explains why all things revere and honor the Dao and virtue. Thus, the Dao gives them life, and it further extols the merit of nurturance.\n\n\"Gives them life yet does not possess\"—this concludes by praising the virtue of forgetting merit.\n\nThe Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\n*Commentary:* \"The Dao gives them life\" means that the natural, harmonious qi shapes and refines the myriad things, enabling their existence—hence, the Dao gives them life. The *Annotation* states: \"The wondrous origin’s dynamic function descends harmonious qi.\" The wondrous origin is the Dao. The supreme Dao descends qi as the root of all things, thus called the wondrous origin. \"Virtue nurtures them\"—virtue means attainment; nurture means cultivation. When the myriad things attain the Dao’s function and can cultivate their forms, this nurturance is condensed into the term \"virtue,\" hence \"virtue nurtures them.\"\n\nThings take form; circumstances complete them.\n*Commentary:* The Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, allowing the ten thousand kinds to flow into form—hence, \"things take form.\" The *Annotation* states: \"Qian’s knowing and Kun’s acting manifest form and position.\" The *Appended Sayings* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"Qian knows the great beginning; Kun acts to complete things.\" Heaven and earth become form; above and below become position. These are all the Dao’s work, entrusted to Qian and Kun for their function. \"Circumstances complete them\"—the Dao provides the myriad things with the timing of heaven and the advantages of earth, the circumstances of yin and yang, and things rely on these to reach completion—hence, \"circumstances complete them.\"\n\nThus, the myriad things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\n*Commentary:* Since the Dao and virtue are the merit of giving life and nurturance, all living beings universally revere the Dao and honor virtue. This urges all beings to return to the root and venerate the Dao.\n\nThe Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor—none confer rank upon them, yet they are eternally natural.\n*Commentary:* In the world, those who are revered and honored must receive rank from a ruler before being esteemed. Now, the Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor arise from their life-giving and nurturing merit bestowed upon things. Thus, things revere and honor them—not through conferred rank but eternally and naturally.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\n*Commentary:* This reiterates the opening chapter’s meaning of the Dao giving life. Beginning is giving life; nurturing is cultivation.\n\nIt rears and raises them,\n*Commentary:* Advancement is rearing; fostering is raising.\n\ncompletes and ripens them,\n*Commentary:* Assisting is completion; fulfillment is ripening.\n\nnurtures and shelters them.\n*Commentary:* Provision is nurturance; protection is shelter. These eight terms all refer to the Dao and virtue’s functions, which is why the myriad things revere and honor them.\n\nGives them life yet does not possess,\n*Commentary:* The Dao gives life to the myriad things yet does not perceive any life to claim—this is the meaning of forgetting life, concluding the above passage on the Dao giving life.\n\nacts yet does not rely,\n*Commentary:* Virtue’s nurturance does not perceive any thing to act upon, nor does it rely on its merit—this concludes the above passage on virtue’s nurturance.\n\nrears yet does not dominate.\n*Commentary:* Through the Dao and virtue, one forgets the merit of giving life and nurturance. Thus, though presiding over the myriad things, rearing, raising, completing, and ripening them, one does not act as their dominator or demand recompense from them. This urges rulers to emulate the Dao’s giving life and nurturance while forgetting their merit.\n\nThis is called profound virtue.\n*Commentary:* This praises the virtue of forgetting merit. Profound means deep and unfathomable. Though the great Dao can give life and nurture, it ultimately does not rely on or dominate. Its virtue is universally bestowed, yet its name does not advance—is this not a deep and unfathomable virtue?\n\n**Chapter 52: The World Has a Beginning**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how the Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, without domination yet naturally honored. This chapter explains guarding the mother to preserve the child, returning to clarity to avoid bodily misfortune. It begins with seven lines on the life-giving origin, urging one to know the child and guard the mother. Next, six lines warn against excessive desire, closing the senses and shutting the gates. The final six lines praise the merit of cultivation and realization, concluding with the practice of embracing constancy.\n\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the world’s mother.\n*Commentary:* Qi is the beginning; life is the mother. The Dao and virtue, with harmonious and wondrous qi, give life to the myriad things. Things receive life as a child does from its mother—hence, \"serves as the world’s mother.\" Though the mother differs from the Dao’s qi, its transformative influence remains constant. Thus, the preceding chapter states: \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\"\n\nHere the text urges one to know the source and recognize the root, to guard the mother and preserve the child. Having attained the mother, one thereby knows the child. *Commentary:* Once a person has obtained the harmonious qi, flourishing and nurturing it as the mother, they should recognize that their body is the child of this harmonious qi. Having known the child, one then guards the mother, and thus remains free from peril until death. *Commentary:* Once a person knows their body is the child of the Dao’s qi, born from harmonious qi, they should guard the Dao’s purity, avoiding contamination by false dust, cherishing qi and nurturing spirit so they do not scatter. Humans are born from the Dao and look to it as their root; now, returning to the Dao and guarding the mother, it is said one \"again guards it.\" \"Free from peril until death\" means that if one can constantly be without desire and return to the Dao, they may complete their natural lifespan without danger.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates, and one will not toil for a lifetime. *Commentary:* This describes the practice of cutting off desire and guarding the mother. \"Openings\" refers to pleasure—ears and eyes take delight in sounds and sights, nose and mouth in fragrances and flavors, each of the six senses having its own pleasures. \"Gates\" denote the means of entry and exit, the pathways through which the senses and external realms interact. If one blocks the senses’ delight in seeing and hearing, the gate of misfortune closes. With the gate of misfortune closed, one will not toil for a lifetime. Thus it is said, \"one will not toil for a lifetime.\"\n\nOpen the openings, aid one’s affairs, and one will be beyond saving for a lifetime. *Commentary:* This describes the conduct of one who loses the Dao. Opening the gates of seeing and hearing, assisting in the pursuit of pleasure, misfortune and calamity will only increase, so that one cannot be saved for a lifetime.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity. *Commentary:* This points to the source of preventing misfortune. When evil omens arise, one must detect even the slightest signs. Thus, in times of worry, regret, or adversity, one should be attentive to the smallest details. Those who guard the mother should prevent harm at its inception and address disorder before it arises. One who can do this may be called clear-sighted.\n\nGuarding softness is called strength. *Commentary:* One who practices softness and weakness, dwelling in a place of non-contention, cannot be overcome by others. In the function of the Dao, one who can do this may be called strong.\n\nUse its light, return to its clarity. *Commentary:* Light shines outward and is ever-active; clarity shines inward and is ever-still. Through seeing the small and guarding softness, one attains clarity. Being strong without arrogance, clear yet employing strength, though one uses light to shine outward, one returns to inner clarity. This further explains the meaning of seeing the small and guarding softness, urging one to cease outward focus and return inward. Thus it is said, \"return to its clarity.\"\n\nLeave no misfortune for the self—this is called embracing constancy. *Commentary:* \"Leave\" means to bestow; \"misfortune\" means calamity. Using light to illuminate things without attachment, returning to guard inner clarity without self-aggrandizement, guarding the mother and preserving the child, reflecting back to the source, one naturally avoids misfortune and calamity. \"This is called embracing constancy\" means that to act in concealment is to embrace. One who can perceive subtle signs to avoid harm, guard softness while containing clarity, and practice such conduct, embraces the true and constant Dao by knowing the child and guarding the mother.\n\n**Chapter 53: If I Were Suddenly to Have Knowledge**\n\nThe previous chapter clarified guarding the mother to preserve the child, aiming to return to clarity without leaving misfortune for the self. This chapter explains that if one were suddenly to employ knowledge, walking the Dao would involve fear of arbitrary action. The first three lines show that having knowledge deviates from the Dao. The next two lines demonstrate that the Dao is upright while people are perverse. The following seven lines reveal the harms born of knowledge. The final two lines lament the way of thieves and boasters, serving as a warning.\n\nIf I were suddenly to have knowledge, walking the great Dao, I would only fear arbitrary action. *Commentary:* \"If I\" is a hypothetical phrase used by Laozi. \"Suddenly\" describes the appearance of having knowledge. The Dao does not rely on knowledge to overcome others; if one wishes to walk the Dao through knowledge, Laozi, fearing its obscuring effects, declares: If I were suddenly to pride myself on having knowledge and wished to practice the great Dao of non-action in the world, having knowledge would deviate from the Dao, losing the transformative influence of non-action and purity. Whatever one arbitrarily does would harm others, which is deeply to be feared.\n\nThe great Dao is very level, yet the people prefer byways. *Commentary:* \"Level\" means flat and easy. \"Byways\" are crooked and expedient paths. The great Dao is smooth and effortless, yet people prefer to take devious shortcuts. The transformative power of the great Dao values non-action and non-interference, which is effortless. Yet those who govern cannot rest their minds in desirelessness and instead engage in mental labor to address affairs. Though they initially prefer byways seeking expediency, they ultimately lose the Dao and disrupt harmony. Thus it is said, \"the people greatly prefer byways.\"\n\nThe court is excessively adorned, *Commentary:* \"Adorned\" means managed. Those who prefer byways do not esteem the transformative power of non-action but instead take action as governance. Though they claim to manage extensively, action harms through cunning and deceit. Thus, exalting worthies and priding oneself on knowledge breeds artifice and falsehood. *Another interpretation:* The court is embellished with towering halls and carved beams, hence \"excessively adorned.\"\n\nThe fields are overgrown, *Commentary:* \"Overgrown\" means weeds proliferate. Excessive cunning and idle consumption lead to the neglect of agriculture. Without the bounty of fine harvests, how can one hope for granaries as full as hills?\n\nThe granaries are very empty. *Commentary:* When the year is abundant, granaries are full; when agriculture is abandoned, granaries are empty—this is the natural principle.\n\nWearing embroidered silks, *Commentary:* Blue and red are \"embroidery\"; colored silk is \"brocade.\" This refers to valuing ornamentation over substance.\n\nCarrying sharp swords, *Commentary:* Sharp swords represent military preparedness. Civil virtue is the instrument of governance, while military achievement is its auxiliary. Civil virtue is fundamental; military power is secondary. Now, if one focuses solely on military affairs, this is abandoning the root to exalt the branch.\n\nSated with food and drink, *Commentary:* \"Sated\" refers to indulgence in food and drink.\n\nSuch lavish abundance in the kitchens, surfeited with rich and rare delicacies—when those above possess an excess of jade-like viands, those below suffer the peril of cold and hunger.\n\nWealth and goods overflow.\n*Commentary:* \"Wealth and goods\" refer to money, silks, pearls, jade, and the like. \"Overflow\" means amassing through heavy exactions. The lesser learning prizes non-greed as treasure, yet one merely seeks to hoard wealth, ensnaring the foolish. This is called \"thievish boasting\"—how can it be the Way!\n\n*Commentary:* To take by unjust means is theft; to flaunt what one possesses is boasting. Moreover, to levy head taxes and gather like dust in a dustpan, taking from those who lack, indulging desire while squandering, and arrogantly parading one’s surplus—is this not rightly called theft? Such conduct is not the Way I would follow.\n\n*Also:* The particle \"zai\" expresses lament and sorrow.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Establishing Goodness**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how rulers who favor byways resemble thievish boasters, acting contrary to the Way. This chapter elucidates how rulers who establish goodness endure unshaken and long abide.\n\nIt begins by declaring the benefits of establishing a state through the Way and cultivating the self. Next, it explains the method of observing the self, the household, and so on, by starting with the self. Finally, \"How do I know?\" concludes with a sigh, affirming the evidence of wisdom’s illumination.\n\nOne who establishes goodness cannot be uprooted.\n*Commentary:* \"Establishes\" means to found; \"cannot be uprooted\" means it cannot be overthrown. If a ruler is adept at founding the state upon the Way and establishing its root, following the people’s non-action and entrusting transformation to the multitudes, then, molding them with purity and simplicity and cultivating their customs and reputation, he ensures that their exemplary conduct inspires trust. Delighted, the people willingly follow without weariness. Thus, his achievements and enterprise take deep root, and all directions turn toward his virtue. This is what is meant by \"establishing goodness\"—how could it be overthrown?\n\nOne who embraces goodness cannot be parted from it.\n*Commentary:* \"Embraces\" means to guard; \"parted\" means to separate. One who skillfully embraces the people with the Way moves, and they joyfully follow—how could they be parted? Moreover, where fine food is found, even passing travelers pause—how much more so with the Dao and virtue? When one employs them to govern things, all things naturally turn toward them.\n\nDescendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n*Commentary:* \"Sacrifice\" means to offer; \"descendants\" refers to later generations, meaning that posterity offers rites to their ancestors. The *Commentary* states: If a ruler’s merit extends to posterity through the Way and virtue, people cherish the sweet pear even in its absence—how much more his descendants? Kings ancestralize merit and enfeoff virtue. Thus, the rise of the Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by Kings Wen and Wu. The Zhou’s sacrifices included the suburban rites for Hou Ji and the ancestral rites for King Wen. Though the dynasty’s divined span was thirty generations and its years seven hundred, and though the ancestral tablets of abandoned temples overflowed beyond the temple, the suburban and ancestral sacrifices for Hou Ji and King Wen never ceased.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its attainment is true.\n*Commentary:* The following explains that little cultivation yields little proof, and much learning yields much attainment. Thus, \"cultivate it in the self\" means cultivating within one’s person; \"cultivate it in the household\" means cultivating within one’s family. Beginning with the self and extending to the world, the pattern may be inferred. One who establishes goodness perceives the true nature clearly. The true nature is pure and tranquil, free from falsity and杂. When falsity and杂 are exhausted, virtue becomes truly pure.\n\nCultivate it in the household, and its virtue overflows.\n*Commentary:* Cultivating the Way within the household brings harmony above and below. Extending the cultivation of the self to the household, its virtue overflows with blessing. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says, \"The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant fortune.\"\n\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures.\n*Commentary:* According to the *Rites of Zhou*, a village consists of 2,500 households. If an entire village cultivates the Way, rites and propriety flourish, and superiors and inferiors maintain proper order. Neighbors live side by side without partiality toward kin. If only one household cultivates the Way, its virtue remains limited; when an entire village does so, its virtue endures.\n\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds.\n*Commentary:* Cultivating the Way within the state transforms customs and shifts prevailing winds, returning to purity and reverting to simplicity. Without bias toward the near, cultivating the Way in one village is still insufficient; when the entire state does so, virtue abounds.\n\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\n*Commentary:* \"Universal\" means all-pervading. When the people return to sincerity, it is through the ruler’s transformation. Cultivating it in the ancestral temple, virtue flows beyond the seas. This occurs when one rectifies the self within, transforming without words and governing without instruction. The response of those below to those above is like an echo answering a sound. When virtue leaves nothing untouched, it is truly universal.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self.\n*Commentary:* \"Observe\" means to examine and perceive. The *Commentary* states: By the method of cultivating the self, observe the self. One who attains purity and tranquility perceives the true aspect of the self—originally pure and tranquil, unstained by worldly dust. Removing all views of existence, when the view of existence is dispelled, even emptiness is seen as empty. Abandoning both extremes at once, one returns to the Middle Way. This may be called purity and tranquility, attaining the true.\n\nObserve the household through the household.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the household, observe the household. When the household is harmonious, blessings and goodness overflow.\n\nObserve the village through the village.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the village, observe the village. When the people of the village all cultivate the Way, superiors and inferiors maintain proper order. As the transformative influence gradually spreads, virtue endures.\n\nObserve the state through the state.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the state, observe the state. When the people of the state all cultivate the Way, diligent and frugal, virtue abounds.\n\nObserve the world through the world.\n*Commentary:* To observe the world through the world—what else is there to observe? One merely observes the self. When the ruler is pure and tranquil, governing through non-action and the transformative power of the Way, establishing goodness and embracing virtue, the people naturally turn toward him, and the state and its people enjoy peace.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\n\nThis is hypothetical speech. The Old Master asks: How do I know that those who skillfully establish cannot be uprooted, those who skillfully embrace cannot be lost, and that blessings and virtue greatly increase? It is by observing the self and the like—observing from within and extending outward—that one comes to know. The *Yijing* states: \"Observe my life, observe their life,\" meaning one first observes the self and then observes others.\n\n**Chapter 55: Embracing Virtue**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the ruler who skillfully establishes enjoys unshakable and enduring existence. This chapter clarifies that the person who embraces virtue alone knows harmony and causes no harm.\n\nThe first five lines mark why one who embraces virtue does not grasp.\nThe next five lines, beginning with \"bones weak,\" clarify why one who preserves harmony does not grow hoarse.\n\nTo know harmony is to be enlightened; to manipulate qi is to be forceful.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way,\" and what is not of the Way perishes early.\n\nOne whose virtue is deeply embraced is like a newborn child.\n*Commentary:* \"Embrace\" means to hold within. It speaks of the perfected person who holds the profound depth of virtue and power within. Internally, they are preserved by virtue and power; externally, they are protected by spirit and illumination—comparable to a loving mother and her newborn child. This principle is difficult to comprehend, so it is illustrated through analogy. Thus, the innate harmony of the newborn is used to exemplify the perfected person’s complete virtue. The newborn, being the youngest of infants, is chosen because it has no discriminating mind and harbors no intention to harm.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting them, fierce beasts do not seize them, birds of prey do not strike them.\n*Commentary:* This explains the perfected person’s complete virtue. Poisonous creatures include wasps and scorpions; fierce beasts include tigers and rhinoceroses; birds of prey include eagles and hawks. \"Sting\" refers to injecting venom with the tail’s tip. \"Seize\" means to press down with the feet. \"Strike\" means to grasp with the talons. The perfected person’s virtue is complete within, their harmonious qi abundant and overflowing, their mind merged with the Dao. Thus, poisonous creatures cannot sting them, fierce beasts cannot seize them, and birds of prey cannot strike them—all due to the restraining power of their utmost compliance and profound virtue.\n\nTheir bones are weak and their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.\n*Commentary:* The following clarifies the newborn’s complete harmony. The newborn’s sinews and bones are soft and weak, and their grasp should not be strong, yet their clenched fists hold fast—is this not due to their undispersed harmonious qi?\n\nThey do not know the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence.\n*Commentary:* The female is called \"yin,\" the male \"yang.\" The organ is the source of vital energy. The newborn’s mind is free of desire, unaware of the union of yin and yang, yet the source of their contained qi moves—is this not due to the purity of their essence?\n\nThey cry all day without growing hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony.\n*Commentary:* \"Hoarse\" means the voice becomes raspy. The newborn cries all day without their voice growing hoarse—is this not due to the perfection of their harmonious qi?\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the analogy of the newborn, whose voice does not grow hoarse due to the perfection of their harmonious qi, and extends the lesson. It says that if one can be like an infant, knowing the principle of harmony and softness and cultivating it without loss, this is called knowing the true constancy of conduct.\n\nTo know constancy is to be enlightened.\n*Commentary:* One who knows the true constancy of conduct and preserves essence while cherishing qi is called enlightened.\n\nThose who understand harmony and constancy praise the beauty of shared virtue. Later, they increase life and manipulate qi, demonstrating the errors of losing the Way.\n\nTo increase life is to invite omens.\n*Commentary:* \"Omens\" signify the portents of fortune or misfortune. It speaks of those who cannot fully harmonize with the knowledge of constancy and instead pursue gains beyond their allotted share. Little do they realize that seeking beyond one’s share leads to excess, and excessive pursuit of life’s increase invites misfortune. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Always follow nature and do not increase life.\"\n\nTo manipulate qi with the mind is to be forceful.\n*Commentary:* The mind distinguishes right and wrong, while qi makes no such distinctions. Thus, following qi leads to softness and weakness, while directing it with the mind leads to forcefulness. Those who lose the Way and increase life employ the mind to manipulate qi, and when qi is controlled by the mind, this is called forcefulness. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi.\"\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way,\" and what is not of the Way perishes early.\n*Commentary:* This clarifies the errors of forcefulness and losing the Way. \"Prime\" means vigor and determination. \"Age\" means decline and exhaustion. All things flourish and then fade; when vigor reaches its peak, aging follows. Those who use the mind to manipulate qi and pride themselves on their strength bring about their own decline—this is called \"not following the Way.\" The Way values softness and weakness; relying on strength is contrary to the Way, so one is urged to cease early.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe previous chapter clarified that one who embraces virtue alone knows harmony and causes no harm. This chapter clarifies that the person who awakens to the Dao understands words yet clings to none.\n\nThe first two lines demonstrate the smooth flow of principle and the forgetting of words.\nThe next seven lines clarify stilling dust without being stained.\nThe lines beginning with \"This is called\" clarify that the unstained share virtue with the mysterious.\nThe lines beginning with \"Thus\" clarify that those of shared virtue cannot be slandered or praised.\n\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n*Commentary:* \"Wise\" means awakened and enlightened. \"Speak\" means to debate and explain. The profound principle is subtle, the mysterious teaching hidden and obscure. Though words may elucidate the principle, ultimately the principle is grasped and words forgotten. Thus, the enlightened grasp the principle and forget words, while the debaters cling to words and fail to awaken. Hence: \"The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\"\n\nBlock their apertures, close their gates.\n*Commentary:* As explained in the chapter \"The World Has a Beginning,\" that passage addressed restraining the six senses’ love of expression through the Dao’s purity and stillness. Here, it addresses freeing oneself from the burden of clinging to words through teaching and discernment. Without attachment to words, one blocks their apertures; not being the master of honor or disgrace, one closes their gates.\n\nBlunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their light, merge with their dust.\n*Commentary:* These four lines appeared in the previous section, \"The Dao Is Empty.\" There, they discussed the Dao’s function; here, they clarify human conduct. The two sections—upper and lower—cite the same text because it serves both the cultivation of the self and the salvation of others, so it is repeated for emphasis.\n\nThis is called \"profound union.\"\n*Commentary:* It extols those who embody the Dao: having transcended attachment to verbal teachings, they harmonize their light and merge with the dust, their conduct aligning with the Dao. This is called \"uniting with the profound in virtue.\"\n\nThus, they cannot be drawn near, nor can they be kept at a distance.\n*Commentary:* Those who achieve profound union have no partiality in their hearts. They cannot be drawn near through familiarity, for they harmonize their light and accord with things; nor can they be kept at a distance through estrangement.\n\nThey cannot be benefited, nor can they be harmed.\n*Commentary:* Serene and desireless, they cannot be enticed by profit; dwelling in a realm beyond contention, they cannot be assailed by harm.\n\nThey cannot be honored, nor can they be debased.\n*Commentary:* Embracing the Dao’s spontaneity, they transcend the reach of rank and emolument; rising above all entanglements, they elude the judgments of the common world.\n\nTherefore, they are honored by all under Heaven.\n*Commentary:* Those who attain profound union awaken to principle and forget words, block their apertures and close their gates, leaving their senses and dust untainted. Having blunted their sharpness and untangled their knots, they harmonize their light and merge with the dust. Such is their conduct—thus, they are revered by all under Heaven.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Seven Concluded*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Eight*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing the State with Governance**\n\nThe preceding chapter illuminated how those who awaken to the Dao attain clarity in speech yet remain free from attachment. This chapter reveals how rulers who govern through governance lose the spontaneous transformation of non-action.\n\nThree sentences set forth the theme to convey its meaning; the next ten employ rhetorical questions to clarify principle. The final five demonstrate that through non-interference, one may gain all under Heaven.\n\n**Governing the state with governance,**\n*Commentary:* These three opening sentences together establish the core teaching. *With* (以) means \"to employ\"; *governance* (政) means \"instruction.\" Rulers who act with deliberate effort, relying on governance and instruction to achieve order, fail to embrace non-action and allow things to transform of themselves. That such rulers seek to bring about governance has never been heard of before.\n\n**Employing the extraordinary in warfare,**\n*Commentary:* *Extraordinary* (奇) refers to deception and stratagem. Weapons are inauspicious tools, detested by the noble person—how much more so when they bear the name of deception and lack restraint in their use? Thus, warfare is like fire: if not contained, it will consume itself. Therefore, one knows that extraordinary and deceptive warfare is not the way to secure victory.\n\n**Gaining all under Heaven through non-interference.**\n*Commentary:* This, too, sets forth the theme.\n\nA ruler of the Dao governs through non-action, and in this non-action there is no meddling; with no meddling there is no vexation; with no vexation the people transform of themselves, and all under Heaven attains great peace. How do I know that this is so for all under Heaven? By this.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"How do I know\"* is a rhetorical question. *\"This is so\"* means \"it is thus.\" *\"By this\"* is the answer. The Old Master poses the question: How do I know that to gain all under Heaven one must practice non-action and non-interference? The following text—*\"When all under Heaven abounds in taboos, the people grow ever poorer\"*—shows that when I practice non-action, the people transform of themselves, and this verification makes it known.\n\nWhen all under Heaven abounds in taboos of the ruler’s own making, the people grow ever poorer.\n\n*Commentary:* This further explains the failure of governance through policy. When one who rules all under Heaven fails to foster purity and stillness to transform the people, or to uphold simplicity in overseeing affairs, when policies are vexatious and nets of law are dense, the people below have nowhere to set their hands and feet. With no respite from avoiding taboos, they lose their livelihoods day by day and fall into ever greater poverty.\n\nWhen the people abound in sharp instruments, the state grows ever more benighted.\n\n*Commentary:* This explains the earlier line on employing the extraordinary in warfare. *\"Sharp instruments\"* refers to stratagems and schemes. The Way of power lies in adapting to the times, to be used only when there is no other choice. If the ruler frequently resorts to stratagems and fails to return to substance, those below will respond with deceit and cunning, hence it is said that this *\"increases the benighted chaos.\"*\n\nWhen the people abound in skills and craft, rare goods proliferate.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Skills\"* (伎) means abilities; *\"craft\"* (巧) means ingenuity. *\"Rare goods\"* refers to carved and inlaid objects, precious commodities, and luxury items. When the ruler does not esteem purity and simplicity but favors extravagance, the people emulate their superior and indulge in excess. They vie in ostentation and adornment, and such things multiply day by day.\n\nWhen laws and decrees are ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits abound.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Laws\"* are penal codes; *\"decrees\"* are administrative commands. When the ruler above cannot restrain desire to govern the people but seeks to regulate all things through pronounced laws and decrees, the people, merely seeking to avoid punishment, lose all sense of shame. Officials, in turn, steal and act corruptly, and superiors and subordinates deceive one another—hence thieves and bandits multiply.\n\nTherefore the sage declares: I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* This explains the principle of gaining all under Heaven through non-interference. *\"I\"* refers to the sage. The virtue of the sage does not esteem skills and craft; the ruler who embodies the Dao values non-action. In the practice of non-action, there are no prohibitions, and those below emulate the ruler’s non-action—hence it is said that *\"the people transform of themselves.\"*\n\nI engage in no meddling, and the people grow rich of themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* When those above impose no taxes or levies, and those below suffer no vexations, when they plow their fields and dig their wells, each household is provided for and the people are content—hence it is said that *\"the people grow rich of themselves.\"*\n\nI am fond of stillness, and the people rectify themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* Stillness is the nature of humanity at birth, the nature of Heaven. When those above cherish tranquility and are not swayed by disturbance, those below, influenced by the ruler’s virtue, follow their nature and rectify themselves.\n\nI am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.\n\n*Commentary:* When the ruler is able to inwardly preserve harmony and outwardly refrain from pursuing desires, the people, moved by this influence, naturally return to purity and simplicity.\n\n**Chapter 58: Governance of Obscurity**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies how rulers who govern through policy fail to achieve self-transformation through non-action.\n\n**Chapter 58: Governance of Obscurity**\n\nThis chapter clarifies that governance through policy must fail, revealing the origins of fortune and misfortune.\n\nFirst, it sets forth two modes of governance—one lenient, one severe—then explains the two gates of fortune and misfortune, whose interdependence knows no constancy. The delusion of the people below is lamented, and the sagely virtue below is presented to encourage cultivation.\n\n**Its governance obscure, its people pure;**\n*Commentary:* \"Obscure\" means uncontrived and magnanimous. \"Pure\" means unadorned and sincere. The ruler who practices non-action governs with broad and tolerant policies, allowing things to fulfill themselves. Without harshness or violence, the customs of the people thus remain pure and unspoiled.\n\n**Its governance exacting, its people deficient;**\n*Commentary:* \"Exacting\" means strict and oppressive governance. \"Deficient\" means decayed and scattered. The ruler who acts with intention imposes severe and urgent policies, binding the people with laws. As legal restrictions proliferate, theft and disorder abound, and the people become impoverished and dispersed.\n\n**Misfortune—fortune leans upon it; fortune—misfortune lies hidden within. Who knows their limit?**\n*Commentary:* \"Misfortune—fortune leans upon it\" means that the obscure governance mentioned earlier, though deemed harmful by custom, in fact leads the people to become pure and sincere. Is this not fortune born of misfortune? \"Fortune—misfortune lies hidden within\" means that the exacting governance, though deemed beneficial by custom, instead causes things to decay and scatter. Is this not misfortune concealed within fortune and then unleashed? \"Who knows their limit?\" refers to those who lose the Dao and abandon virtue, indulging in artifice and ostentation. Fortune and misfortune cycle endlessly, their interdependence without constancy—who can fathom their ultimate end?\n\n**Is there no constancy?**\n*Commentary:* This asks whether the extremes of fortune and misfortune lack a fixed norm. Yet this arises because people fail to embody the Dao and practice non-action, instead clinging to delusion and losing their constancy.\n\n**Constancy reverts to strangeness, goodness reverts to perversity.**\n*Commentary:* This explains the origin of delusion regarding constancy. The people, confused about fortune and misfortune, fail to recognize constancy and mistake it for deceit. Unclear about goodness, they take it for ominous portents. Thus, constancy seems absent.\n\n**The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.**\n*Commentary:* This laments that the people, deluded about constancy and goodness, reverse them into strangeness and perversity. Such confusion has persisted for ages, hence it is said to have endured for long.\n\n**Thus the sage is square but does not cut,**\n*Commentary:* \"Square\" derives from constancy. This presents the sage’s virtue to encourage cultivation. The sage, in propagating the Dao and aiding the age, guides all things toward constancy. His conduct is upright and constant, and things respond by rectifying themselves—not by imposing teachings or carving things to conform to himself.\n\n**sharp but does not wound,**\n*Commentary:* \"Sharp\" means incorruptible. \"Wound\" means to defile. The sage, following his nature, remains incorruptible and naturally transforms those below. He purifies their defilement to reveal their clarity. The character for \"wound\" originally meant \"to harm\"; the sage, though sharp in conduct, does not injure others.\n\n**straight but does not extend,**\n*Commentary:* \"Extend\" means to stretch forth. The sage’s conduct is not crooked, and others naturally follow his uprightness—not because they are unrighteous, but because he does not stretch forth to straighten their crookedness.\n\n**luminous but does not dazzle.**\n*Commentary:* \"Luminous\" refers to wisdom. Though the sage possesses wisdom, he conceals it and does not display it to dazzle others. Thus, it is said he is luminous but does not dazzle.\n\nWith such sagely virtue, the people naturally become pure and follow his transformation.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidates the governance of non-action, whereby people attain purity and harmony. This chapter expounds on governing people and serving Heaven, advocating no excess but frugality. First, it establishes that in governing people and serving Heaven, nothing precedes thrift. Next, with \"only then\" below, it extends the prior meaning—this is called \"submission\"—and employs the metaphor of deep roots to illustrate the Way of longevity.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift.\n*Commentary:* \"Thrift\" means cherishing. When a ruler seeks to govern and transform his people while reverently serving the Supreme, nothing precedes the virtue of cherishing resources—this is the power of frugality. By restraining excess, sufficiency is ensured, and people are gathered. With abundant sacrificial offerings, Heaven bestows its favor upon bright virtue; thus, nothing surpasses thrift.\n\nOnly through thrift is this called early submission.\n*Commentary:* \"Only through thrift\" reiterates the above. \"Early submission\" explains the meaning of frugality and thrift. There are seven instances of such reiteration, all following this pattern. \"Only\" is an introductory particle. \"Submission\" means service. Only a ruler who practices frugality and cherishing in governing people and serving Heaven, making thrift the foundation of governance, will cause all under Heaven to submit early to his rule.\n\nEarly submission is called the accumulation of virtue.\n*Commentary:* Why do all under Heaven look up to his transformation and the realm submit to his benevolence? Because he practices restraint and frugality, the people submit early to his service—thus accumulating his virtue abundantly.\n\nWith abundant virtue, there is nothing that cannot be overcome.\n*Commentary:* \"Overcome\" means to be capable. If a ruler amasses virtue, his governance will ensure the people’s strength is universally preserved, and his service to Heaven will be met with unceasing auspiciousness. Then, the four directions will turn toward his transformation, and there will be nothing he cannot subdue.\n\nWith nothing that cannot be overcome, none can fathom its limits.\n*Commentary:* When a ruler’s virtue leaves nothing unconquered, even distant customs will admire his transformation, and remote lands will observe his influence—none will be too far to reach. Thus, none can fathom its limits.\n\nWhen none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state.\n*Commentary:* When a ruler’s virtuous transformation reaches all without exception, drawing the allegiance of the multitudes and the blessings of the divine, only then may he be said to possess the state. As the *Yijing* states: \"The king approaches the temple and the household.\"\n\nBeyond this, how can one be said to possess the state? The mother of possessing the state can endure long.\n*Commentary:* \"Mother\" refers to the Dao/Way, signifying nurturance. The reason one may be called a possessor of the state lies solely in having the Dao/Way to nourish the people. Thus, his fortune and reign will be everlasting and enduring.\n\nThis is called the Way of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.\n*Commentary:* A ruler who accumulates virtue and takes the Dao/Way as his state may endure long; thus, the metaphor of roots and stems is employed to expound this principle. \"Stem\" refers to the base of a flower. When the roots of plants run deep, they flourish; when their stems are firm, they do not fall—thus enduring long. This illustrates that a ruler who accumulates virtue plants his roots in the Dao/Way and secures his stem in virtue, extending his mandate in the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that governing people with frugality and cherishing causes all directions to submit early. This chapter elucidates that early submission without disturbance leads to the mutual return of virtue. First, it presents the analogy of governing the state without action. Next, it explains that virtue extends to ghosts and spirits, with neither causing harm. Finally, it concludes by extolling the virtue of mutual return, exhorting rulers who possess states.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n*Commentary:* This is a metaphor. \"Small fish\" refers to tiny fish. When cooking small fish, one must not stir them, for stirring will break them apart. This illustrates that governing a great state must not be meddlesome, for meddling will disorder the people. Both require the Dao/Way to achieve success.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way is employed to oversee all under Heaven, its ghosts do not manifest as spirits.\n*Commentary:* \"Employ\" means to use. \"Oversee\" means to attend. Spirits that dwell in darkness and manifest as ghosts and spirits do so through their numinous efficacy. When people make requests, spirits respond. Yet if the transformation of supreme virtue ensures the people’s safety, not only will they forget the Emperor’s power, but they will also cease to invoke ghosts and spirits. Thus, the ghosts dwelling in darkness will have no means to display their numinous efficacy.\n\nIt is not that its ghosts do not manifest as spirits; their spirits do not harm the people.\n*Commentary:* This further explains why ghosts do not display their efficacy. \"It is not that its ghosts do not manifest as spirits\" does not mean ghosts cease to exist or lose their numinous power. Rather, when omens arise, it is due to human transgressions. If people maintain their virtue, spirits will not appear as portents to harm them. As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Their qi flames forth to claim them.\"\n\nIt is not that their spirits do not harm people; the sage also does not harm people.\n*Commentary:* The statement that \"their spirits do not harm people\" implies not only that spirits lack efficacy and cannot harm people, but also that the sage, employing the Dao/Way to oversee the people without action or disturbance, ensures the people rectify themselves. Thus, it is said the sage employs the Dao/Way to oversee all under Heaven. To further elucidate the sage’s virtue, it reiterates: he also does not harm people.\n\nAs neither harms the other, their virtues mutually return.\n*Commentary:* \"Neither\" refers to the sage and the spirits. The people are the foundation of the state and the hosts of the spirits. If ghosts and spirits harm the people, they injure the state’s foundation; if the sage harms the people, he impoverishes the spirits’ host. Now, as neither harms the other, their virtues mutually return. Not only do the spirits and the sage alone prosper, but the myriad people also universally benefit.\n\n**Chapter 61: A Great State as the Lower Reaches**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that employing the Dao/Way to oversee all things leads to the mutual return of virtue. This chapter elucidates that humbling oneself with virtue causes things to return through modesty. First, it establishes that a great state employs humility to attract transformation. Next, it explains that when a great state humbles itself, both great and small attain their desires. Finally, it particularly exhorts great states to practice humility.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches, the confluence of all under Heaven.\n*Commentary:* The Jiang and the sea lie below the flow of all rivers, which empty into them—thus called the lower reaches. Applied to people, this is the virtue of humility. A ruler, possessing the Dao/Way, preserves his state; without virtue, the people scatter.\n\nThus, those who govern a great state must dwell in the lower reaches, opening themselves to receive, so that all under Heaven converge and come—thereby preserving their greatness. Hence it is said: \"The lower reaches are the confluence of all under Heaven.\"\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven is the female; the female ever prevails over the male through stillness.\n*Commentary:* \"The confluence of all under Heaven\" reiterates the preceding text to conclude the meaning of \"lower reaches.\" It states that the reason all under Heaven converge and come is due to the great state’s humility, likened to how the male, through the female’s stillness, is sought by the active male. Thus, it is said: \"The female ever prevails over the male through stillness.\"\n\nThrough stillness, one is below.\n*Commentary:* As previously stated, the reason all under Heaven converge and come is that the ruler employs the virtue of humility. This is like the female, who through stillness prevails over the male, for she takes stillness as her foundation in being below.\n\nTherefore, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins over the small state.\n*Commentary:* \"Therefore\" continues the preceding text to complete its meaning. It states that the ruler of a great state, eschewing force and employing the virtue of humility to gently subdue, causes the smaller rulers to seek shelter and allegiance, thereby winning over the people of the small state as subjects and servants.\n\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins over the great state.\n*Commentary:* Since the ruler of a great state employs the virtue of humility to gently subdue the small state, the ruler of the small state offers tribute, attends court, and enters alliances, never daring to rebel. By serving the great state with humble rites, the small state seeks the great state’s might as support.\n\nThus, some humble themselves to win over, while others humble themselves and win over.\n*Commentary:* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"That which can be directed left or right is called 'with.'\" \"Some humble themselves to win over\" means that when a great state employs the virtue of humility, it wins over the small state, making it amenable to direction—hence \"with.\" \"Others humble themselves and win over\" means that when a small state employs the virtue of humility to serve the great state, it can only offer allegiance and seek support, unable to direct the great state at will—hence \"and.\"\n\nA great state desires nothing more than to nurture and govern its people, while a small state desires nothing more than to enter into service.\n*Commentary:* When a great state, honoring humility, wins over a small state, it harbors no other intent but to nurture and govern the small state’s subjects as their sovereign. When a small state employs humility, offering tribute and gifts to win over the great state, it seeks nothing more than to enter into service and gain support.\n\nBoth attain their desires, so the great should be the first to humble themselves.\n*Commentary:* The great desire to nurture, the small desire to serve—both fulfill their wishes, hence \"both attain their desires.\" \"The great should be the first to humble themselves\" means that things never belittle the great because of their smallness, but the great inevitably overpower the small. Fearing that the rulers of great states may become arrogant and invite disaster, few can practice humility—thus the admonition that the great should especially humble themselves.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao/Way as the Mystery of Myriad Things**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when one humbles oneself with virtue, both great and small attain their desires. This chapter elucidates that when the Dao/Way transforms things, both good and evil receive its sustenance. First, it establishes the profound and mysterious nature of the Dao/Way. Next, it explains the teaching that transforms people. Finally, it extols the Dao/Way’s efficacy, declaring it worthy of reverence.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the mystery of myriad things.\n*Commentary:* The Dao/Way is the potent name for the wondrous origin. \"Mystery\" means within. The Dao/Way encompasses all without exclusion, serving as the source from which all things arise—hence it is the mystery within myriad things. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: \"The Dao/Way is profoundly mysterious, the abyss of emptiness and non-being,\" which expresses this.\n\nThe treasure of the good,\n*Commentary:* \"Treasure\" denotes that which is cherished. The good are those who embody the Dao/Way through non-action, their bodies and minds pure and still—thus they treasure it without ceasing.\n\nThe refuge of the not-good.\n*Commentary:* \"Refuge\" means to rely upon or lean on. The not-good, though their minds lack wisdom, are influenced by accumulated habits. In times of peace, they neglect the Dao/Way, but in adversity, they seek it, relying upon it for safety.\n\nFine words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\n*Commentary:* This is an analogy. It states that even the not-good can be taught. As the commentary notes: \"Sweet and fine words can be used to seek in the marketplace. Noble and lofty conduct can be bestowed upon others.\" This compares the sage’s use of sweet and savory teachings, noble and still conduct, to transform the not-good—like merchants gathering in the marketplace, all following the good. Hence the following text:\n\nWhy discard those who are not good?\n*Commentary:* If people’s words and deeds are not good, why discard them? One should guide them with the good Dao/Way, hoping they will reform and abandon evil. They must not be cast aside without transformation—hence \"why discard them?\"\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed.\n*Commentary:* The Three Dukes refer to the Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Protector. The Son of Heaven practices non-action, while the Three Dukes discourse on the Dao/Way—all to provide instruction and establish teachings for transforming the not-good. As the *Book of Documents* states: \"Heaven’s work is performed by humans,\" which expresses this.\n\nThough one may offer a large jade disc preceded by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.\n*Commentary:* A \"large jade disc\" refers to the largest of jade discs; a \"team of four horses\" refers to the finest horses. Though the Three Dukes assist the ruler by offering jade and horses to the supreme, these are not as precious as presenting the Dao/Way of non-action, which transforms evil into good. \"Preceded by a team of four horses\" refers to the ancient custom of leading horses with jade when offering tribute—hence \"preceded.\" As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Twelve oxen, preceded by soft leather, were used to reward the army,\" which exemplifies this.\n\nWhy was this Dao/Way so revered in ancient times?\n*Commentary:* This invokes antiquity to affirm the present, inspiring trust in all things.\n\nThe ancients—those good people of former times—treasured the Dao/Way. One may ask: why did they so treasure and revere this Dao/Way? Was it not because they sought to attain it through effort, or to escape guilt through its power? Thus it was prized by all under Heaven.\n\n*Commentary:* This answers the question of why the Dao/Way is revered. \"Not attained through seeking by the day\" means that the Dao/Way lies in awakening, and awakening lies in the clarity of the heart-mind—unlike the methods of deliberate action, which require the accumulation of days and years in striving pursuit. Simply still the heart-mind and restrain desire, and pure whiteness will arise of itself. \"Or to escape guilt through its power\" means that when deluded thoughts arise and defilement takes hold, karmic entanglements follow. But if one awakens to the Dao/Way and empties the heart-mind, the causes of guilt naturally vanish. How could this be like those who cling to rigidity, whose every movement breeds regret and resentment, and who only seek escape from punishment after incurring guilt? For this reason, the good people of all under Heaven treasure and revere it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**\n\nThe previous chapter illuminated the profound mystery of the subtle origin, showing how sitting and presenting the Dao/Way serves as the gateway for assisting the ruler. This chapter reveals the dark silence of non-action, ceasing resentment and perfecting the practice of cultivation. It begins by setting forth the principle of sitting in forgetfulness and cutting off desire, then demonstrates how to prevent evil before it sprouts. In what follows, it cites the virtues of the sage to reinforce and exhort.\n\nAct without acting,\nAttend to affairs without affairs,\nTaste without tasting.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Acting\" means contrivance. The practitioner of the Dao/Way sits in forgetfulness, casting off desire, and thus does not contrive. Whatever is enacted merges with transformation, so that in acting there is non-acting—hence \"without acting.\" This clarifies the heart-mind. Not clinging to affairs, one attends to them without affairs—this clarifies the body. Not indulging in flavors, one tastes without tasting—this clarifies the mouth. When the three karmic activities are exhausted, the six senses and their objects naturally cease.\n\nAs for the affairs of great and small, many and few—if one enters the realm of deliberate action, there is nothing that is not a foe of resentment. But if one embodies that non-action, abandons these desires, and awakens to the true reality, without giving rise to thoughts of anxiety, then resentment naturally does not arise. This is what is meant by \"repaying resentment with virtue.\"\n\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy,\nAchieve greatness while it is still small.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Plan\" means to deliberate. \"Achieve\" means to undertake. All harm to life from emotions and desires arises gradually, without exception beginning in ease and ending in difficulty, starting in the small and later becoming great. If one deliberates at the time when it is still easy, then in the end there will be no difficulty. If one undertakes at the time when it is still small, then later there will be no greatness. If one attempts difficulty in difficulty, or greatness in greatness, once calamity and chaos have already arisen, even if one then seeks to plan and act, it will be of no benefit to the affliction.\n\nThe difficult affairs of all under Heaven necessarily arise from what is easy,\nThe great affairs of all under Heaven necessarily arise from what is small.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Arise\" means to begin. This repeats the previous passage to trace the origin of calamity and difficulty. Difficult affairs necessarily begin in what is easy—this urges one to plan for them while they are still easy. Great affairs necessarily begin in what is small—this urges one to eliminate them while they are still small. The examples are truly numerous and cannot all be listed, so the text uses \"all under Heaven\" to encompass them.\n\nThus the sage never attempts greatness, and so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\n*Commentary:* The previous passage showed that ordinary people constantly attempt difficult and great affairs, and thus often fail and encounter hardship. Here it presents the sage, who never attempts difficult or great affairs, and so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\nLight promises must lack trust,\nMuch ease must bring much difficulty.\n\n*Commentary:* This concludes the analogy. Those who do not reflect thrice before speaking, and lightly and easily make promises, will surely lack loyalty and trustworthiness. Those who do not plan for the beginning and carefully consider the end, and easily undertake affairs, will later surely give rise to difficulty and become entangled in suffering.\n\nThus the sage still regards it as difficult, and so in the end encounters no difficulty.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage is the ruler who embodies the Dao/Way. \"Still regards it as difficult\" means to regard lightly making promises and much ease as difficult. How much more so for those who are not like the sage? Because the sage regards lightly making promises and much ease as difficult, in the end there are no difficult and great affairs.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: Holding What Is Secure and Easy**\n\nThe previous chapter illuminated non-action and dark silence, showing the gateway to ceasing resentment and cultivating the Dao/Way. This chapter reveals the principle of anticipating calamity and preventing it beforehand, setting forth the practice of cutting off emotions and eliminating desires. The first six lines repeatedly clarify the gradual nature of preventing calamity. The next six lines present analogies for the causes of calamity. The following two lines discuss the delusion of clinging. Another six lines expound the conduct that differs from the ordinary. The final seven lines extend the sage’s lack of desire and lack of learning to exhort the ordinary world to hold fast to what is easy and plan for what is easy.\n\nWhat is secure is easy to hold,\n\n*Commentary:* \"Secure\" means stillness. \"Hold\" means to grasp. When people receive life, their true nature is pure and still. When moved by external things, they pursue desire without end. Here it clarifies that when the heart-mind of desire has not yet stirred, in the time of stillness, if one seeks to guard it and prevent it from scattering, it is very easy to hold—hence \"what is secure is easy to hold.\"\n\nWhat has no sign is easy to plan for.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Sign\" means the first sprouts. \"Plan\" means to deliberate. When emotions and desires are about to arise but have not yet shown signs, to deliberate and cut them off is also very easy—hence \"what has no sign is easy to plan for.\"\n\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\n\n*Commentary:* When the heart-mind of desire has already stirred, it is tender and fragile, not yet firm. If one seeks to remove it, it is easy to destroy.\n\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Minute\" means small. When calamity and misfortune are small and have not yet become great, to prevent them at the outset and cause them to disperse and dissolve is also very easy.\n\nAct on it before it exists,\n\n*Commentary:* \"Act\" means to cultivate and remove. This line explains the previous \"easy to hold\" and \"easy to plan for.\" The reason it is easy is that when the heart-mind of desire has not yet arisen, to cultivate and remove it, cutting it off, is to prevent evil from arising—hence \"act on it before it exists.\"\n\nPut it in order before it is in chaos.\n\n*Commentary:* This line explains the previous \"easy to break\" and \"easy to scatter.\" The reason it is easy is that although evil exists, it is still tender and minute, and has not yet become calamity and chaos—hence it is easy to put in order.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a hair-fine sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basketful of earth.\nA journey of a thousand li starts beneath one’s feet.\n\n*Commentary:* This speaks of calamity arising from the minute and becoming manifest. It is like a tree of arm-spanning girth, which at first grows no thicker than a hair’s end—this illustrates growth from inherent nature. A nine-tiered terrace begins with a single basket of earth—this illustrates formation through accumulated habit. A journey of a thousand li begins with the lifting of a foot—this illustrates progress through unceasing advance. Thus all things under heaven truly begin with the minute, yet people often overlook it, allowing it to become the root of calamity. Hence these three analogies are adduced to confirm the preceding text.\n\nThose who act fail; those who grasp lose.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Act\" refers to contrivance. \"Grasp\" refers to attachment. It means that people, unable to act before existence or put things in order before chaos, instead contrive beyond their inherent nature and cling to sensory realms—hence they inevitably meet with ruin and loss.\n\nTherefore the sage, through non-action, suffers no failure; through non-attachment, suffers no loss.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage, through non-action and tranquility, preserves the integrity of inherent nature and thus suffers no failure. Through emptiness and forgetfulness, free from attachment, the true nature remains constant and thus suffers no loss.\n\nIn their undertakings, the common people often fail when near completion.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Near\" means close. It means that ordinary people, in pursuing good deeds, often fail when their endeavors are nearly complete, unable to exercise caution to the end, thus bringing about ruin.\n\nIf one remains as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure.\n\n*Commentary:* This is Laozi’s repeated exhortation. If one can be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, maintaining consistency from start to finish, then no undertaking will fail. Thus the *Book of Documents* states: \"All things have a beginning, but few attain completion.\"\n\nTherefore the sage desires what others do not desire, and does not value rare and precious goods.\n\n*Commentary:* This illustrates the sage’s conduct in contrast to the common. \"Rare and precious goods\" refer internally to what lies beyond one’s inherent nature, and externally to jewels, rhinoceros horns, and treasures. The sage, in desiring what others do not desire, neither pursues what lies beyond inherent nature nor seeks goods that burden virtue—hence does not value rare and precious goods.\n\nThe sage learns what others do not learn, thereby restoring what the common people have transgressed.\n\n*Commentary:* Ordinary people value rare and precious goods, thus they distort and strive to learn what lies beyond their inherent nature. The sage does not seek transgressive learning but preserves the naturalness of inherent nature. In learning what others do not learn, the sage thus aims to restore what the common people have transgressed.\n\nTo assist the spontaneity of the myriad things, yet dare not act.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Assist\" means to aid. \"Spontaneity\" is the inherent nature of things. When sentient beings arise in delusion and lose their inherent nature, the sage, through compassionate guidance, teaches non-action, thereby aiding the spontaneity of things and preserving the true nature from ruin—hence dares not act through worldly learning or excessive desire.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Eight, Complete*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Nine*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancients Skilled in the Dao**\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidated the foresight of anticipating harm and the practice of eliminating emotions and desires. This chapter reveals how the pursuit of cunning gives rise to calamity and demonstrates the profound virtue of great compliance.\n\nFirst, it clarifies the transformative power of the Dao; next, it distinguishes the harm wrought by intelligence. From *\"Know this\"* onward, it presents discernment as a method. From *\"Constantly knowing\"* onward, it extols the effort of practice and urges cultivation.\n\nThose of old who were skilled in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple.\n\n*Commentary:* The ancient rulers who were adept at employing the Dao for transformation valued non-action and tranquility. They did not flaunt their understanding of the Dao to dazzle the people but instead guided them toward purity and harmony, curbing cunning and deceit, so that they might remain as guileless as the unlearned.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because of their excessive intelligence.\n\n*Commentary:* The reason the people are hard to govern lies precisely in their overabundance of intelligence. This excess arises because the ruler fails to embody the Dao in overseeing the realm, thereby allowing the people to employ their intelligence in crafty schemes, giving rise to deceit and making governance difficult.\n\nGoverning the state with intelligence is the state’s ruin.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"With\"* means to employ. *\"Ruin\"* means harm. When a ruler relies on cunning ministers to govern the state, an excess of intelligence leads to the rise of schemes. Where schemes are employed, deceit arises; where deceit arises, the Dao is abandoned. This brings harm to the state, hence it is called the state’s ruin.\n\nGoverning the state without intelligence is the state’s blessing.\n\n*Commentary:* When a ruler does not rely on cunning ministers but instead seeks those of pure virtue, allowing them to advance the Dao of non-action and propagate the winds of great simplicity, harmony is achieved—this is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two paths serves as a model.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"These two\"* refers to governing with intelligence and without it. *\"Model\"* means pattern; *\"serves\"* means method. When a ruler understands that governing with intelligence brings ruin while governing without it brings blessing, they should abandon ruin and embrace blessing. Knowing this, one may serve as a model and method for governing the state.\n\nConstantly knowing this model is called profound virtue.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Profound\"* means deep and wondrous. When a ruler consistently understands these two paths as a model, this is called profound and wondrous virtue.\n\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching; it moves contrary to things, and only then does it attain great compliance.\n\n*Commentary:* This is a concluding exclamation. The ruler of profound virtue transforms through non-action, their capacity unfathomable—this is depth. Their influence extends boundlessly—this is far-reaching. Thus, they return with all things to the wondrous origin, only then attaining great compliance with the true nature of spontaneity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Rivers and Seas**\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed how the pursuit of cunning gives rise to calamity and demonstrated the profound virtue of great compliance. This chapter elucidates how humility makes one a master and exemplifies the sage’s virtue of non-contention.\n\nFirst, it presents the analogy of rivers and seas, showing that humility makes one a king. Next, it clarifies how the sage employs modesty, willingly yielding without resentment. Finally, it concludes with the virtue of non-contention, offering a gateway for cultivation.\n\nThe rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at being lowly; thus, they become kings of the hundred valleys.\n\n*Commentary:* The rivers and seas can command the homage of all streams and become their kings because they excel at occupying the lowest places. As the *Book of Changes* states: *\"The way of earth changes fullness to flow into humility.\"* This is the analogy. Just as the way of earth employs humility, so all streams converge and submit to it; when the sage employs humility, the people willingly follow without resentment.\n\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, they must place their words below them.\n\n*Commentary:* This draws the analogy to its conclusion. When the sage wishes to be above the people, they must humble their words. How could the sage truly desire to be above others while placing their words below them? The sage knows that fullness invites loss, so their words are modest and gentle, their names humble and solitary. By placing themselves below others, their great virtue and vast achievements naturally earn the people’s reverence.\n\nIf they wish to lead the people, they must place themselves behind them.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage does not seek to lead others but, through feigned humility, places themselves behind others, and the people naturally follow.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people do not feel burdened; when they are ahead, the people do not feel harmed.\n\n*Commentary:* This concludes the preceding discussion. The sage occupies the supreme position of the throne, the utmost height of honor, yet labors for the people’s ease and diminishes themselves for the people’s benefit. Being above, they enable the people’s livelihood, so the people do not feel burdened. Being ahead, they ensure the people’s governance, so the people do not feel harmed.\n\nTherefore, the world delights in exalting them without resentment.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage’s virtue is vast and impartial, bringing life to all like spring. They shine like the sun, neither burdening nor harming the people. Thus, the world delights in exalting them without weariness.\n\nBecause they do not contend, no one in the world can contend with them.\n\n*Commentary:* Why does the world delight in exalting the sage without resentment? Is it not because the sage humbles their words and places themselves behind others, refusing to contend with things? Thus, no one in the world can contend with the sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World Calls My Dao Great**\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidated how humility makes one a master and exemplified the sage’s virtue of non-contention. This chapter illustrates how the Dao’s greatness appears unworthy and demonstrates the three treasures through the practice of compassion.\n\nThe first six lines declare the Dao’s greatness, explaining why it appears unworthy. The next five lines present the three treasures, urging their use through compassion. The following eight lines further expound the benefits of compassion and the harm of abandoning it. The final four lines conclude with an exclamation on the virtue of compassion.\n\nThe world calls my Dao great, yet it seems unworthy.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Unworthy\"* means lacking resemblance. Laozi says that the world considers his Dao vast and formless, appearing to lack any likeness, hence the response below.\n\nPrecisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would long since have been small.\n\n*Commentary:* This answers why it appears unworthy.\n\nFor only my Dao is vast and great, transcending all things, fundamentally beyond the probing knowledge of ordinary sentiment—thus it is called great. Were it to possess any likeness or resemblance, like the laws of the world, it would long since have lost its greatness. Such are the petty, coarse, and shallow laws, no different from those of cultivation—how could they be called great? The particle *ye fu* serves as an exclamatory aid.\n\nI possess three treasures, which I safeguard and hold fast.\n*Commentary:* This explains why it appears unworthy: precisely because these three practices differ from the common, Laozi says that though his Dao is great and without resemblance, it yet possesses these three treasures, most precious and noble. People of the world must safeguard and uphold them to cultivate the self and govern the state.\n\nThe first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world.\n*Commentary:* This enumerates the three treasures. Embracing benevolence and bestowing widely, loving and nurturing all beings—this is compassion. Using resources sparingly and enriching others, not depleting things—this is frugality. In undertaking affairs, harmonizing without taking the lead—this is not daring to be first in the world. The meaning of their great benefits is fully expounded below.\n\nThrough compassion, one can be brave.\n*Commentary:* This restates the efficacy of the three treasures. Ordinary people, greedy and competitive, lacking compassion, are bold in recklessness, leading to exhaustion and defeat. Now the sage practices compassion, thus bold in delivering and saving others. Later, it cites the *Analects*: \"The humane are surely brave.\"\n\nThrough frugality, one can be expansive.\n*Commentary:* By being thrifty and cherishing resources, not wasting wealth or harming others, one’s merits and benefits spread widely.\n\nBy not daring to be first in the world, one can become the chief of instruments.\n*Commentary:* Diminishing the self to benefit others, withdrawing to advance others—this is not daring to be first in the world. Thus, others gladly elevate one to become the chief of sacred instruments.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim bravery, abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness, abandon humility yet claim precedence—this is death.\n*Commentary:* *Qie* means \"rashly\" or \"recklessly.\" Worldly sentiments, full of desires, act contrary to the Dao: abandoning the compassion that benefits others for the reckless bravery that harms them, forsaking the frugality that conserves for the reckless extravagance that spreads, discarding the humility of retreat for the reckless self-aggrandizement of precedence. Such conduct violates compassion and frugality. Using it to govern the state leads to its ruin; using it to cultivate the self leads to one’s demise—hence, it is called death.\n\nWith compassion, in battle one wins; in defense, one stands firm.\n*Commentary:* Compassion is the foremost of the three treasures, thus it is singled out for praise. Using compassion to resist war preserves the multitude. Using compassion to defend brings peace to the people. Neither loses compassion, thus one can win and stand firm.\n\nHeaven will save them, protecting them with compassion.\n*Commentary:* *Jiu* means \"to assist,\" *wei* means \"to guard.\" The Way of Heaven blesses the good, and the good encounter no misfortune. Thus, those who fight with compassion will be assisted by Heaven; those who defend with compassion will be guarded by Heaven. Victory in battle and firmness in defense ultimately rely on the merit of using compassion—assisted and guarded, they ultimately receive the aid of the supremely bright.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Good Warrior**\nThe previous chapter clarified that only greatness appears unworthy, presenting the three treasures and urging their practice through compassion. This chapter clarifies that the good warrior is not martial, setting forth four virtues that match the ultimate of Heaven. It first sets forth the four virtuous practices, then praises them as the virtue of non-contention, and concludes that goodness can match Heaven, preparing to expound the essential Dao of antiquity.\n\nThe good warrior is not martial.\n*Commentary:* *Shi* means \"to serve,\" *wu* means \"might\" or \"martial power.\" The enlightened ruler, governing with the Dao, practices compassion and frugality to nurture the people, not wielding martial power to control them. What he esteems is compassion, thus he is called \"not martial.\"\n\nThe good fighter is not angry.\n*Commentary:* When armies are sent forth to meet the enemy, the matter lies in compassion and sorrow. Even mosquitoes and gnats sting—one merely drives them away. Thus, the good fighter lies in stopping the enemy, not in relying on anger—hence, \"the good fighter is not angry.\"\n\nThe good conqueror does not contend.\n*Commentary:* That non-contention arises from esteeming virtue. If one uses force to contend for victory, it is not good conquest. Leading the distant with softness and harmonizing the near, fully expressing compassion and harmony, not contending with the enemy, the enemy submits of itself—hence, \"the good conqueror does not contend.\"\n\nThe good employer of others is humble.\n*Commentary:* The good employer of others speaks with humility, and others will exert their full strength, achieving success. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: \"The noble lowers itself to the base, greatly gaining the people.\" This is called the virtue of non-contention.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the above: the good warrior is always yielding and not martial, the good fighter is always compassionate and not angry, the good conqueror is always yielding and does not contend, the good employer of others is always humble. In this way, things exhaust their abilities, and people value their use—all arising from humility. Is this not the virtue of non-contention?\n\nThis is called employing the strength of others.\n*Commentary:* Being profoundly still and reverent, humble and yielding to others, all people rejoice and willingly exhaust their strength. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: \"Delighting in employing others, people forget their toil\"—this is employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called matching the ultimate of Heaven, the essential of antiquity.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the four virtuous practices above, the virtue of non-contention. Those who can practice them can match Heaven and be called emperors—this is the ultimate essential Dao of antiquity.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Strategist’s Saying**\nThe previous chapter clarified the virtuous practices of the good warrior, whose non-contention allows him to match Heaven. This chapter clarifies that the strategist has a saying: to treat the enemy lightly is nearly to forget one’s treasures. The first line sets forth the theme with a question. The next six lines demonstrate the practice to clarify it. The final four lines admonish the use of arms, declaring that those who know compassion and sorrow will surely win.\n\nThe strategist has a saying:\n*Commentary:* Laozi detested the customs of the time, where rulers treated enemies lightly, inviting disaster, delighting in war and killing. Thus, he invoked antiquity to admonish, and what is called \"has a saying\" refers to the following line.\n\n\"I dare not act as the host but as the guest,\"\n\nThe Commentary: \"I\" refers to the one who employs military force. To initiate is to act as the host; to respond is to act as the guest. The host, by initiating, provokes affairs and grows covetous, while the guest, by responding, guards with compassion. This makes clear that in antiquity, those who employed military force always had admonitions: one must guard with compassion and not provoke affairs or grow covetous. Thus it is said, \"I dare not act as the host but as the guest.\"\n\n\"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nThe Commentary: To retreat and guard by the Dao is to achieve good victory. To advance and seize strength is to court defeat. Thus, even a slight advance harms through covetousness, while even a great retreat gains through humility. Now, scorning contention, it is said, \"I dare not advance an inch,\" and valuing compassionate yielding, \"but retreat a foot.\"\n\n\"This is called marching without marching,\"\nThe Commentary: To march with troops is to halt the enemy; halting the enemy values non-contention. Now, acting as the guest and retreating a foot, achieving good victory through non-contention, though marching to meet the enemy, is the same as not marching.\n\n\"Repelling without arms,\"\nThe Commentary: To bare one’s arms is to display anger. One who excels in battle does not grow angry, thus it is as if there are no arms to bare, hence \"repelling without arms.\"\n\n\"Drawing no enemy,\"\nThe Commentary: To draw is to lead. To lead the enemy is to seek contention; now, taking non-contention as virtue, there is no enemy to draw, hence \"drawing no enemy.\"\n\n\"Wielding no weapon.\"\nThe Commentary: To wield is to hold; weapons refer to the five weapons—dagger-axe, spear, and the like. To hold weapons is to intend to slay the enemy. Taking compassion as the foundation and restraining one’s weapons, though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, thus it is the same as wielding no weapon.\n\n\"There is no greater disaster than to treat the enemy lightly; treating the enemy lightly nearly loses my treasure.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Nearly\" means to approach; \"loses\" means to forfeit. \"Treasure\" refers to compassion. Of all disasters, none is greater than to slight and provoke the enemy, delighting in contention. Thus one nearly forfeits the treasure of compassion. Now, having lost compassion, to fight is to court defeat, to guard is to invite dispersal. The calamities between generations are not of one kind, but dispersal and defeat are the greatest disasters. Thus,\n\n\"When armies clash, the sorrowful will win.\"\nThe Commentary: To clash is to raise. When two states raise armies to engage, victory belongs to the ruler who follows the Dao and the general who acts with compassion, pitying the people and not seeking to kill many.\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\n*The Teachings of My Words Are Very Easy to Know*\nThe previous chapter clarified the sayings on employing military force, warning against treating the enemy lightly. This chapter clarifies the teachings that unfold the principle, showing their ease of understanding. What is easy to know must have a sovereign ruler; treating the enemy lightly forfeits compassion and goodness. First, it declares the sagely teachings as easy to know; next, it shows the lost path of those who do not comprehend. Below \"words have a sovereign,\" it explains the meaning of ease in knowing. Below \"only,\" it discusses the reasons for not comprehending. Finally, it laments the sage’s jade-like heart, exhorting the diligent practitioner.\n\n\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.\"\nThe Commentary: Laozi says that what I speak unfolds the principle; when the principle is unfolded, words are forgotten, thus they are easy to know. What I speak of as affairs is to act without acting; when affairs are simple, there is non-action, thus they are easy to practice.\n\n\"Yet none in the world can know, none can practice.\"\nThe Commentary: This laments that sentient beings cannot understand wordless words, clinging to words and stagnating in teachings, deluded by verbal instruction, thus none can know. They cannot awaken to acting without acting, entangled in affairs without restraint, lost in worldly matters, thus none can practice.\n\n\"Words have a sovereign; affairs have a ruler.\"\nThe Commentary: This reiterates the reason for ease in knowing and practicing. \"Sovereign\" means root; \"ruler\" means master. Words exist for the sake of principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten, thus words take wordlessness as their root. Affairs exist for the sake of achievement; when achievement is complete, affairs are set aside, thus affairs take non-action as their ruler. Is this not easy to practice?\n\n\"Only because of ignorance, therefore they do not know me.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Do not know me\" means they do not know me. Only because the delusion of the age lacks awakened knowledge, fixating on names and forms, unable to unfold the principle, clinging to affairs in affairs, stagnating in words with words, thus they do not know the intent of my teachings—wordlessness and non-action.\nAnother interpretation: Laozi says that what I know lies only in unknowing, yet the people of the world seek knowledge with knowledge, thus they do not know me.\n\n\"Those who know me are few; thus those who model themselves on me are noble.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Few\" means scarce. \"Model\" means to follow. Laozi says that those who know my intent to forget words and accord with the principle are exceedingly scarce. If one can follow my words and practice them, then one may be esteemed and noble.\n\n\"Thus the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\"\nThe Commentary: Coarse cloth is fur, the garment of the lowly. To wear coarse fur is to cover the rough clothing of the humble. Jade is pure and lustrous, comparable to the virtue of the noble person. This is to say that the sage’s inner heart is wise and enlightened, while his outward appearance is like that of a fool. Thus it is said he \"wears coarse cloth,\" and because his heart is wise and enlightened, it is said he \"holds jade.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\n*To Know That One Does Not Know Is Superior*\nThe previous chapter clarified the teachings that unfold the principle, showing their ease of knowing.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\n*To Know That One Does Not Know Is Superior*\n\nThis chapter clarifies the enlightened mind, wherein emptiness and forgetfulness are supreme. It begins by distinguishing between delusion and awakening, for clinging to delusion breeds deceit.\n\nOnly the lowly—concluding with praise for the sage—fully recognize that \"knowing\" is a flaw, and thus do not force knowledge.\n\nTo know that one does not know is superior.\nTo not know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\n**Commentary:** The nature of the Dao is fundamentally empty, and it is not a matter of knowing. The sage, awakened to this, does not grasp at discriminating knowledge. In not clinging to knowledge, it is called \"not knowing,\" which is the highest virtue. This explains awakening.\n\n\"Not knowing yet claiming to know is a flaw\" refers to ordinary people who do not understand that the knowledge of the Dao is not truly real. Regarding this principle of non-knowing, they forcibly assert knowledge, binding themselves to attachment. This is why it is called a flaw in conduct. This distinguishes delusion.\n\nOnly by recognizing the flaw as a flaw does one avoid being flawed.\n\n**Commentary:** Sentient beings forcibly assert knowledge, generating false views and attachments, which become afflictions. Only by recognizing the flaw of forced knowledge and forgetting knowledge itself does one avoid being afflicted by forced knowledge. Thus it is said, \"only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw does one avoid being flawed.\"\n\nThe sage is not flawed because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw, and thus is not flawed.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage’s perfect wisdom is luminous, awakened to true reality. In knowledge, he forgets knowledge, and thus is not afflicted by knowledge. Why is this so? Because he recognizes the flaw of ordinary beings’ forced knowledge, and so expounds true wisdom to dispel it. Once the flaw of false knowledge is removed, the medicine of true knowledge is also set aside. Thus it is said, \"he is not flawed.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\n*The People Do Not Fear Authority*\n\nThe previous chapter clarified the wisdom of the enlightened mind, wherein emptiness and forgetfulness are supreme. This chapter reveals the affliction of delusion and the authority that is to be feared.\n\nFirst, it states that when people do not fear authority, calamity will soon follow. Next, it warns against narrowness. Below, it urges people to empty their minds and quiet their desires, so that the spirit will not reject them. Finally, it presents the conduct of the sage as evidence, showing what to discard and what to embrace.\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will arrive.\n\n**Commentary:** Authority is that which is to be feared. Desires and aversions arise from subtle beginnings; when accumulated, they become afflictions and burdens, giving rise to great authority. If people do not guard against the subtle, they will eventually face what is greatly to be feared.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling.\n\n**Commentary:** The dwelling of the spirit is the mind. People should forget emotions and abandon desires, broadening and softening their hearts so that the inner palace is at ease. When the spirit rests in the mind, the body endures.\n\nDo not reject their source of life.\n\n**Commentary:** The source of life is the spirit. To reject is to despise. People are born through the spirit, hence the spirit is called their source of life. The numinous spirit favors emptiness and stillness. People should purify their minds and quiet their thoughts, and the spirit will naturally return to them. If they indulge desires and defile the spirit, or engage in restless activity and disturb their nature, their essence and qi will scatter and dissipate, leading to forgetfulness of their origin. Thus, they are urged not to reject the spirit that gives them life, so as to preserve the Way of longevity.\n\nOnly by not rejecting it is one not rejected.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way is called \"goodness that bestows\"; the spirit is called \"that which sustains form.\" When people cherish the Way and preserve the spirit, it is said, \"only by not rejecting it.\" By removing defilements and halting thoughts, focusing solely on purity and unity, the spirit will not reject them. Thus it is said, \"is one not rejected.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage knows himself but does not display himself.\n\n**Commentary:** To know oneself is to reflect inwardly and examine oneself, guarding against harm in its subtlety so that no fearful matters arise. To not display oneself is to not flaunt one’s talents and abilities, dazzling others, violating principle and losing constancy, thereby inviting misfortune.\n\nHe cherishes himself but does not exalt himself.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage preserves and cherishes his body, cutting off desires so that the spirit is not rejected. To not exalt himself is to not arrogantly elevate himself above others, oppressing and harming them, thereby accumulating resentment.\n\nThus, he discards that and embraces this.\n\n**Commentary:** He discards self-display and self-exaltation, and embraces self-knowledge and self-cherishing. The sage attains the wisdom of equality, awakened to the emptiness of the nature of the Dao. In principle, there is no discarding or embracing. This is spoken to teach and guide the ignorant, using such language for instruction.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three**\n*Boldness in Daring*\n\nThe previous chapter revealed the affliction of delusion and the authority that is to be feared. This chapter clarifies the consequences of boldness and daring, which lead to self-destruction.\n\nFirst, it distinguishes between daring and not daring, showing their differing outcomes in benefit and harm. Next, it elucidates the Way of Heaven’s humility and gentleness, warning against boldness and daring. Finally, it laments the retribution of Heaven’s net, urging good people to cultivate virtue.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life.\n\n**Commentary:** Resoluteness is called boldness; decisiveness is called daring. Those who are strong and unyielding, fearing nothing and lacking humility and gentleness, act with reckless decisiveness. Those who rebel against superiors and disrupt order follow the path to self-destruction. Thus it is said, \"boldness in daring leads to death.\"\n\nBoldness in not daring leads to life: if one is cautious in affairs, restrains oneself, and knows when to retreat, deciding not to act with reckless boldness or provoke misfortune, this is the path to preserving life. Thus it is said, \"boldness in not daring leads to life.\"\n\nKnowing these two, one may encounter benefit or harm.\n\n**Commentary:** The two refer to daring and not daring. If one knows that boldness leads to death and harm, while not daring leads to life and benefit, one should be bold in not daring. Though both involve boldness, their applications differ. Thus it is said, \"one may encounter benefit or harm.\"\n\nWho knows the reason for what Heaven detests?\n\n**Commentary:** Who means \"who.\" Reason means \"meaning\" or \"cause.\" Those who are bold and act recklessly bring harm upon themselves, which is detested by the Way of Heaven. Yet among the people of this world, who understands this meaning?\n\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Commentary:** This presents the sage as an example to inspire ordinary people. Even with the sage’s wisdom, he finds boldness and daring difficult, fearing their harm. How much more so for ordinary people who act with boldness and daring—how can they avoid harm?\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory.\n\n**Commentary:** Following the above statement on what Heaven detests, these four lines broadly elucidate the Way of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, warning against reckless boldness. People cling to victory and defeat, hence they contend. The Way of Heaven bestows impartially, favoring only goodness. Nothing opposes it, thus it is said to \"excel at victory.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not speak yet excels at response.\n\n**Commentary:** What words does Heaven utter? It simply blesses the good and punishes excess, responding to fortune and misfortune alike. Thus it is said to \"not speak yet excel at response.\"\n\nIt does not summon yet comes of itself.\n\n**Commentary:** All things arrive by the call of fate. Yet Heaven does not summon them—it allows them to follow its will, and the myriad things come and submit of their own accord. Thus, embracing yin and holding yang, spring’s birth and summer’s growth all come without being summoned.\n\nVast and boundless, it excels at planning.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of Heaven is profound and distant, vast and expansive. It hangs images to show change, which people may emulate. Thus it is said to \"excel at planning.\"\n\nThe net of Heaven is vast and wide, loose yet never failing.\n\n**Commentary:** \"Vast and wide\" means broad and expansive. This further explains the preceding principles of the Way of Heaven. Though Heaven’s net is broad, loose, and distant, in rewarding good and punishing evil, it does not miss by even a hair’s breadth.\n\n*End of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Nine*\n*Chapter Seventy-Four: \"The People Constantly Do Not Fear\"*\n\nThe preceding chapter clarifies how reckless daring in action leads to self-inflicted harm. This chapter reveals that action breeds contempt for death, inevitably incurring the punishment of the one who wields death. The first five lines issue a warning against the use of punishment. The next line identifies the one who wields death. The final four lines show that substituting punishment for death will surely bring fault and blame.\n\nThe people constantly do not fear death—how can they be intimidated with death?\n**Commentary:** This speaks of those who cannot abide by the Dao’s clarity and stillness, instead indulging their desires and hastening toward death. Through long habit, they grow accustomed to it and feel no fear. The ruler should transform them through clarity and stillness, guiding them with teaching—how can he further use punishment and execution to terrify them?\n\nIf the people constantly feared death and acted with perversity, I could seize and execute them—who would dare?\n**Commentary:** This shows that when the ruler transforms through non-action, the people all restrain their desires, each preserving their lives and constantly fearing death. Only those who act with perverse and unvirtuous conduct would allow me to seize and execute them—who would dare to do so immediately? The reason they are not executed is that there exists the Heavenly Net’s appointed executioner, as the following text states.\n\nThere is always one who wields death to kill.\n**Commentary:** *Si* (司) means \"to preside over.\" Heaven’s gaze is perfectly clear, nothing escapes its scrutiny. Those who act with perversity do not meet their proper end—this is the one appointed by Heaven to wield death and kill them.\n\nTo kill in place of the one who wields death is called \"taking the place of the great carpenter in hewing.\"\n**Commentary:** This says that when the unvirtuous are executed by the one who wields death, if the ruler uses his power to seize and kill them at once, he takes the place of the executioner in killing—this defies Heaven’s principle, like an unskilled man replacing the great carpenter in hewing wood.\n\nFew who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing do not injure their hands.\n**Commentary:** When the great carpenter hews wood, his movements accord with square and circle. If an unskilled man replaces him, he will surely lose the proper measure—how could he not damage the material and injure his hands? Heaven’s net does not fail, its divine principle is luminously clear. If the ruler employs punishment, taking the place of the one who wields death, how could he not harm the people and forfeit Heaven’s harmony? This is what is meant by \"how can they be intimidated with death.\"\n\n*Chapter Seventy-Five: \"When the People Suffer Hunger\"*\nThe preceding chapter showed that action breeds contempt for death, inevitably incurring the punishment of the one who wields death. This chapter reveals that heavy taxation impoverishes the people, giving rise to the harms of action. The first three sections successively clarify the causes of these harms. The final section, beginning with \"only those,\" laments and urges them to value life.\n\nWhen the people suffer hunger, it is because their superiors consume too much in taxes—this is why they hunger.\n**Commentary:** The people are the foundation of the state. If governance is oppressive and taxes are heavy, leaving the people impoverished, then the state’s foundation is harmed, and harm leads to peril. Thus, the people’s insufficiency arises from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—this is why they suffer hunger.\n\nWhen the people are difficult to govern, it is because their superiors act—this is why they are difficult to govern.\n**Commentary:** The foolish masses rely on the ruler for governance. The root of governance lies in non-action, for when I practice non-action, the people naturally transform. The reason the people are now difficult to govern is that their superiors act. Action breeds oppressive governance and disturbs the people, giving rise to great falsity—this is why they are difficult to govern.\n\nWhen the people treat death lightly, it is because they seek excessive enrichment of life—this is why they treat death lightly.\n**Commentary:** The reason people lightly enter the realm of death and forfeit their lives is that they violate their allotted portion in seeking life, nourishing it too lavishly. Disregarding the net of punishment, they pursue their desires—this is why they treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not treat life as something to be enriched are superior to those who value life.\n**Commentary:** Life has its limits; contentment with one’s portion is sufficient. It cannot be violated, nor can it be augmented. To seek life beyond what is proper is delusion. Thus, those who do not enrich their lives preserve them, while those who seek to enrich their lives lose them. Therefore, those who do not treat life as a burden to be worried over are superior to those who pride themselves on valuing life.\n\n*Chapter Seventy-Six: \"When People Are Born\"*\nThe preceding chapter showed that heavy taxation impoverishes the people, giving rise to the harms of action. This chapter reveals that action breeds desire in the heart, thus forfeiting the harmony of qi’s softness. The first part marks the two paths of life and death; the next part offers two analogies from plants and trees. The conclusion, beginning with \"the strong and great dwell below,\" warns that one must abide by harmony and softness.\n\nWhen people are born, they are supple and weak; when they die, they are stiff and strong.\n**Commentary:** When people are born, harmonious qi flows through them, naturally rendering them supple and weak. When they die, harmonious qi scatters, and their limbs become stiff and strong. This is said to show that suppleness and weakness, stiffness and strength, serve as warnings for life and death.\n\nAll things, plants and trees, when alive are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry.\n**Commentary:** This offers an analogy. All things, plants and trees, gather qi to live, so their branches and leaves flourish, soft and fragile. When qi is exhausted and they die, their stems and trunks wither and dry. The preceding part addressed beings with awareness; this part addresses those without awareness, showing that the gathering and scattering of qi determine flourishing and withering. Beings with awareness determine life and death by the presence or absence of the Dao.\n\nThus, the stiff and strong are followers of death; the supple and weak are followers of life.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the preceding meaning. It says that when plants and trees live, they are soft and fragile; when dead, they are stiff and strong. Thus, those who act with stiffness and strength are followers of death, while those who act with suppleness and weakness are the kind that live.\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.\n**Commentary:** The military saying holds that compassion is the foundation. Thus, it says that armies relying on strength will be defeated, intending to show that those who rely on strength will die.\n\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled.\n**Commentary:** The root of a tree is strong and great, so it dwells below. Its branches and twigs are supple and weak, growing together above. This takes the supple and weak to dwell above, while the strong and overbearing remain below—hence the following text states:\n\nThe strong and great dwell below; the supple and weak dwell above.\n**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding text, explaining that the root of a tree is strong and great, so its branches and leaves grow together above. It intends to show that the strong and overbearing always dwell below the supple and weak.\n\nChapter Seventy-Seven: The Way of Heaven\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that deliberate action stirs the heart’s desires, thereby losing the harmony of qi’s suppleness. This chapter reveals that overbearing strength inevitably invites loss, hence the analogy of Heaven’s Way.\n\nThe opening line presents Heaven as a warning. The next five lines offer an analogy to illustrate Heaven’s Way. The following eight lines synthesize the preceding meaning. The conclusion extols sagely virtue to exhort.\n\nIs not the Way of Heaven like the drawing of a bow?\n**Commentary:** This employs both principle and analogy. Heaven’s Way is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the drawing of a bow is used to illuminate Heaven’s power. The method of drawing a bow is detailed below.\n\nThe high are pressed down; the low are lifted. The excessive are diminished; the deficient are supplemented.\n**Commentary:** In drawing a bow, one must align the limbs and steady the frame, ensuring proper tension and balance. Pressing down the high and lifting the low sets the arrow’s aim. Diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient adjusts the shot’s distance. Only thus can one strike the mark.\n\nHeaven’s Way is likewise: the sun, moon, cold, and heat proceed and return. As they come, they diminish what is excessive; as they go, they supplement what is deficient—thus completing the year’s work. The ruler of men should emulate Heaven’s Way: restraining the strong, aiding the weak, diminishing excess, and benefiting deficiency. Hence, it speaks of reducing abundance and augmenting humility, desiring that all things be measured and bestowed with equity.\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the deficient. The way of man is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies that the human way cannot emulate Heaven’s diminishing and supplementing. The note on \"reducing the many to benefit the few\" is a phrase from the *Yi*’s *Modesty* hexagram.\n\nWho can take their excess and offer it to the world? Only those who possess the Way.\n**Commentary:** *Shu* means \"who.\" The Old Master laments that the age cannot emulate Heaven’s Way, descending to relieve the people and magnifying its power. Thus, he invokes Heaven’s Way to exhort: Who can emulate Heaven’s Way, diminishing their excess to succor the deficient? Only a ruler who possesses the Way can do so.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without presuming,\n**Commentary:** This cites the sage to confirm the above meaning of possessing the Way. *Presuming* means self-importance. The sage emulates Heaven’s equitable bestowal, extending virtue to all things without displaying merit—hence, it says \"without presuming.\"\n\nAnd accomplishes without dwelling.\n**Commentary:** The sage knows that dwelling on accomplishment invites Heaven’s diminution. Thus, though the Way governs the realm and merit aids the world, they ascribe glory to the multitude and do not dwell upon their achievements.\n\nNot desiring to display worthiness.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the meaning of \"without presuming\" and \"without dwelling.\" Though the sage’s abundant virtue fills within, their excellent reputation remains hidden without. Their refusal to presume action or dwell on merit stems from the desire to conceal virtue and obscure fame, not wishing others to perceive their worthiness. This, too, is the intent of diminishing excess.\n\nChapter Seventy-Eight: The Suppleness of the World\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed that overbearing strength inevitably invites loss, illustrating it with Heaven’s Way. This chapter clarifies that suppleness receives benefit, hence praising the power of water.\n\nThe first five lines extol water’s triumphant work. The next four lament that none can practice it. The following five verify the preceding meaning. The final line synthesizes the above.\n\nIn the world, nothing is more supple than water, yet in attacking the firm and strong, none can surpass it.\n**Commentary:** Water’s nature is to flow downward without contention, moving and resting with the seasons, taking shape according to its vessel. Thus, among all things in the world that are supple and weak, none surpass water. Yet in attacking the firm and strong, none can surpass it.\n\nFor though water is supple, it can bore through stone. Though stone is firm, it cannot harm water. If the firm attacks the firm, both are damaged; if water attacks stone, the stone is harmed while the water remains whole. Thus, in attacking the firm and subduing the strong, none precede water—hence, it says \"none can surpass it.\"\n\nThere is nothing that can replace it.\n**Commentary:** Though water is utterly supple, in attacking the firm and strong, nothing can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the power of non-contention and lacks the intent to prevail?\n\nGoverning the state and cultivating the self should always be thus.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. The world knows this, yet none can practice it.\n**Commentary:** The way of suppleness overcomes rigidity; the way of weakness overcomes strength. All in the world know this principle, yet deluded by self-regard and prizing their own excellence, none can practice what they know—hence, it says \"none can practice it.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage says: One who bears the state’s disgrace is master of the altars of soil and grain; one who bears the state’s misfortune is called king of the world.\n**Commentary:** This cites the sage’s words to confirm the preceding meaning, exemplifying one who practices the way of suppleness overcoming rigidity.\n\n*Disgrace* means filth and humiliation. If a ruler can contain and bear disgrace, taking the myriad transgressions of the realm upon themselves, the people will admire their virtue and not scatter. The altars of soil and grain will be served—hence, they are called master of the altars of soil and grain.\n\n*Bearing the state’s misfortune* means goodness. If a ruler can humbly employ suppleness, bearing the state’s misfortune, calling themselves \"the orphaned, the widowed, the unworthy,\" then the four seas will turn to benevolence—hence, they are called king of the world.\n\nTrue words seem contradictory.\n**Commentary:** This line concludes the above. Bearing the state’s filth yet becoming master of the altars of soil and grain, bearing the state’s misfortune yet becoming king of the world—such words appear contrary, differing from the common. Thus, the Old Master praises them as truly upright words, trustworthy in practice. Yet to the vulgar, they initially seem contradictory.\n\nChapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Resentment\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that suppleness receives benefit, hence praising the power of water. This chapter reveals that laws and decrees generate harm, inevitably leaving lingering resentment.\n\nAt first, establishing teachings to harmonize resentment is not yet the greatest principle. Thus, below, it is shown that those with virtue hold the tally, and resentment does not arise. Later, the Way of Heaven is discussed, revealing that the Way of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good.\n\nTo harmonize great resentment, there must remain lingering resentment.\n\n**Commentary:** In the beginning, when humanity was born, body and mind were pure and still. Now, they are mired in worldly defilements, losing the Way and sinking together—this is the work of emotions and desires. Thus, we know that what becomes the greatest resentment to the self is none other than emotions and desires. *Harmonize* means to reconcile. This speaks of the people, swayed by emotional attachments, generating deceit and falsehood. The ruler, unable to employ non-action to allow their natural transformation, instead establishes teachings and laws to curb their cunning, reconciling and harmonizing them—hence, \"harmonizing great resentment.\" Yet lingering resentment must remain, for once teachings and laws are established, traces cannot be avoided. The harm of these traces in turn becomes resentment—thus, it is said that lingering resentment must remain. How can this be considered good?\n\n**Commentary:** Establishing teachings and laws inevitably breeds harm. With lingering resentment, how can this be called good? It is merely mending one’s nature through worldly learning to seek a return to the original state. If one could transform through purity and stillness, without affairs or action, the people would possess a wind of simplicity, and the harm of lingering traces would vanish—only then could it be called good.\n\nTherefore, the sage holds the left tally but does not demand of others.\n\n**Commentary:** The left tally is the heart. The heart is the yang storehouse, contracting with external conditions—hence, it is called the left tally. When the sage establishes teachings, there are connections and traces, which become lingering resentment. Thus, he holds fast to this heart, keeping it pure and still, transforming others below. Without emotions or desires, there is no need for punishment or demands, and non-action naturally contracts.\n\nThus, those with virtue govern by the tally, while those without virtue govern by penetration.\n\n**Commentary:** *Govern* means to preside. *Penetration* means to pass through. The virtuous ruler presides over the heart and tally, allowing the people to transform themselves. The ruler without virtue, unable to empty the heart and forget the self, desires only to enact laws to control others. Enacting laws breeds harm—hence, this is without virtue.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial, ever favoring the good.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of Heaven bestows evenly, favoring the good without deceit. Thus, those who govern with purity and stillness are blessed by Heaven, and their words bring no disadvantage. Those who enact laws with cruelty and harm are visited by Heaven’s calamity, and their misfortunes cannot be escaped. Is this not the meaning of \"August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue\"?\n\n**Chapter Eighty: The Small State with Few People**\n\nThe preceding chapter showed that laws and decrees breed harm, inevitably leaving lingering traces of resentment. This chapter reveals that simplicity and purity bring perfect governance, naturally eliminating ostentatious and self-serving demands. It begins by advocating a wind of non-action to encourage emulation, showing that when the people follow the ruler’s transformation, order is achieved. Later, it clarifies that when households are sufficient and people content, there is nothing to seek.\n\nLet the state be small, its people few, so that though there be tools for tens and hundreds, they are not used.\n\n**Commentary:** *Few* means scant. *Tens* refers to squads. *Hundreds* refers to leaders. *Tools* means implements. This discusses the age of pristine antiquity. Speaking of a small state shows no desire for expansion. Speaking of few people shows no desire for multitude. Without desire for expansion, the heart is free of greed and competition. Without desire for multitude, affairs are necessarily simple. When the way of simplicity is established, the wind of purity flourishes. Even if there are tools surpassing others, fit to serve as squad leaders or commanders to govern the people, they are not put to use.\n\nLet the people regard death as weighty and not wander far.\n\n**Commentary:** *Wander* means to migrate. When transformation returns to purity, governance is not oppressive. The people cherish their lives, thus regarding death as weighty. Rooted in their fundamental occupations and delighting in their work, with nothing sought externally, each remains content in their place—hence, they do not migrate far.\n\nThough there be boats and carriages, there is no occasion to ride them.\n\n**Commentary:** Boats and carriages are made to traverse water and land, to exchange what is needed. With no coming or going, boats and carriages are abandoned, having no use. As *Zhuangzi* says, \"In the age of utmost virtue, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges.\"\n\nThough there be armor and weapons, there is no occasion to array them.\n\n**Commentary:** Armor and weapons are arrayed to subdue the disobedient and repel invaders. When the ruler practices the Way and the people below remain undivided, the affairs of attack and war are set aside. Thus, armor and weapons are sheathed, having no occasion to be arrayed.\n\nLet the people return to knotting cords and using them.\n\n**Commentary:** In ancient times, before writing and contracts arose, knotted cords were used to record affairs. Thus, the *Appended Sayings* states, \"In high antiquity, knotted cords governed; later sages replaced them with writing and contracts.\" This is to show that in the age of knotted cords, people were pure and simple. Once writing arose, deceit and falsehood were born. Now, it would have the people forget emotions and abandon desires, returning to pristine antiquity—hence, \"let the people return to knotting cords and using them.\"\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful...\n\nWhere food is fitting, all that is eaten is sweet. Where clothing is appropriate, all that is worn is beautiful. If neither is fitting nor appropriate, even jade-like feasts and brocade robes cannot be called sweet or beautiful.\n\nLet them be content with their dwellings, delight in their customs.\n\n**Commentary:** Without desires, one is content with one’s dwelling. With transformed purity, one delights in one’s customs. If desires are pursued without restraint, one will not be content with one’s dwelling. If governance is harsh and daily more vexatious, how can one delight in one’s customs?\n\nLet neighboring states be within sight of one another, let the sounds of their roosters and dogs be heard across the borders, yet let the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them.\n\n**Commentary:** That neighboring states are within sight and the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard speaks to their proximity. That people grow old and die without traveling between them arises from each being self-sufficient, having nothing to seek from the other.\n\n**Chapter 81: Sincere Words Are Not Fine**\n\nThe two scrolls, upper and lower, together illumine the Dao and its virtue. They begin by declaring the essential aim, opening the gate to all mysteries. They conclude by gathering and returning, guiding one to the path of attaining the meaning.\n\nThus, they entrust the teaching to the contrast between sincerity and beauty to manifest the instruction of words, and discuss the distinction between goodness and eloquence to admonish cultivation. They write of vast knowledge to show the lost and deluded, and expound non-accumulation to teach forgetting and relinquishment. They borrow multiplicity to unfold the nature of the Dharma, and conclude with non-contention to clarify the sage.\n\nThey intend that learners penetrate the subtleties within words and images, and guide the fish-trap and rabbit-snare beyond the principle itself. Awakening to the teaching, one may forget the teaching—why then seal one’s lips in Vimalakīrti’s silence? Through words, one clarifies the wordless, and thus may understand the mind at the pillar beneath.\n\nSincere words are not fine.\n\n**Commentary:** Sincere words are the truthful words of sagely teaching. Here, the Old Master wishes to clarify the teachings he expounds, transforming and guiding sentient beings. They are truly sincere, and thus at odds with the common, deemed by the world as not fine.\n\nFine words are not sincere.\n\n**Commentary:** Fine words refer to the sweet and pleasing words of worldly teaching. Their speech is full of embellishment, moving in accord with the vulgar. Being neither truthful nor sincere, they cannot transform others. That sincere words are not fine is precisely because the fine words of worldly teaching are not sincere.\n\nThe good do not dispute.\n\n**Commentary:** The goodness of awakening to the teaching lies in cultivation. In practice, one forgets it, never clinging or stagnating, and thus does not dispute.\n\nThe disputatious are not good.\n\n**Commentary:** Those who merely dispute the teaching, never awakening or understanding, accumulate many delusions in their cultivation and stagnation, and thus are not good.\n\nThe wise are not learned.\n\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means awakening and understanding. *Bo* means extensive hearing. Those who embody the Dao and awaken to it value essence and unity, not extensive hearing. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says, \"Extensive hearing drowns the mind.\"\n\nThe learned are not wise.\n\n**Commentary:** Those with extensive hearing stagnate in the teaching of words. Stagnating in the teaching, they speak all day without exhausting it. Not awakening, they are called unwise.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate.\n\n**Commentary:** *Ji* means stagnation and gathering. The sage, having wondrously penetrated the source of principle and deeply understood the nature of the Dharma, awakens to the emptiness and falsity of written words and the hollowness of verbal teachings. Having clarified the principle expounded, the words that expound it are also relinquished. Thus, regarding those verbal teachings, there is not the slightest stagnation or accumulation. Hence, it is said the sage does not accumulate.\n\nHaving given to others, one’s own is ever more abundant. Having given to others, one’s own is ever more plentiful.\n\n**Commentary:** *Ji* means to exhaust. Though the sage does not stagnate in verbal teachings, sentient beings must rely on the sage’s guidance to develop wisdom. Thus, the sage exhausts the pure and tranquil principle, giving it entirely to the foolish and teaching them. In the sage’s nature of wisdom and understanding, there is no depletion. Hence, it is said ever more abundant, ever more plentiful.\n\n**Annotation:** *You* clarifies one’s inherent nature. *Duo* clarifies external benefit. The nature of awakening to principle is not possessed by another, hence it is called inherent. The benefit of teaching does not arise from within, hence it is called external. This clarifies that when the sage teaches the foolish, their minds become ever more understanding, hence ever more abundant. As they learn and half is taught, the principle becomes ever more lucid, hence ever more plentiful.\n\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of Heaven bestows life and nurtures the myriad things—this is benefit. It does not dominate or sever—this is non-harm. This analogy is raised to clarify the sage’s Way of vast benefit.\n\nThe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of the sage, in all its actions, does not contend with things. For the sage has no stagnation or accumulation, and having given to others, one’s own is ever more abundant—hence, does not contend.\n\n*Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Ten, Completed*",

      "translated_text": "**Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang**\n\n**Title:** *Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang*\n**Author:** Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Li Longji\n**Ten fascicles.**\n**Base text source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings of the Divine Empyrean Section*, *Jade Instructions Category*.\n**Collated with:** Dunhuang manuscripts P.3592, P.2823, S.4365.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nLaozi is the inner appellation of the Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Origin. As the profound and abstruse founder of the Dao, he descended and was born in Yi and Bo. Our august imperial ancestor, in solemn succession, bestowed upon our Tang the surname. His teachings for the governance of the world and his boundless blessings have long bestowed distant auspices, tracing their roots to the gourd and melon’s endless vines. His traces of emergence and withdrawal are fully recorded in the annals.\n\nThe Daoist tradition regards him as the Jade Dawn’s responsive title; Sima Qian called him a reclusive gentleman, yet Confucius took him as his teacher. When Laozi expounded the *Classic of the Dao* amidst the scriptures, Confucius inquired about rites, sighing in admiration of his dragon-like virtue—thus, Kong Qiu had no reservations. Having dwelled long in the Zhou court, he was about to guide the western frontier when the Pass Prefect Yin Xi entreated him to compose a text. Thereupon, he unfolded two fascicles, elucidating the source of the Dao and virtue, the nurturing of life and sustenance—nothing lies beyond this, and its essence resides in governing the self and governing the state.\n\nTo govern the state is to renounce ostentation and extravagance, taking non-action and silence as instruction. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone. If lords and kings can preserve it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\"* It further says: *\"I take no action, and the people transform of themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people prosper of themselves; I delight in stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nTo govern the self is to diminish selfishness and reduce desires, making an empty mind and a full belly one’s duty. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"Constantly take no desire to observe its mysteries.\"* It also says: *\"Do not value rare goods; do not display what may be desired.\"* And further: *\"Block its apertures, close its gates, blunt its sharpness, untangle its knots.\"* All these are to be preserved with softness, weakness, femininity, and stillness. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.\"* And: *\"Know the masculine, but preserve the feminine.\"* Such is its great purport.\n\nAs for exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, closing off conditions and stilling thoughts, acting in accord with reality while exercising adaptability, sitting in forgetfulness and relinquishing illumination, diminishing again and again, and delving into the mysterious again and again—these are scarcely attainable through words and transmission.\n\nHis teachings are all-encompassing, his text concise, his purport expansive, his words accessible. Thus, those who wander its corridors and chambers all believe themselves to have ascended the hall and glimpsed its inner sanctum. Yet only upon profound study and deep reflection do they realize that, even at the tip of an autumn hair, they have not attained one ten-thousandth of it.\n\nThe Scripture states: *\"There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name; I style it the Dao; forced to name it, I call it Great.\"* Thus, the Great Dao is the forced appellation for the ultimate emptiness and wondrous root, naming its function of universal generation.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"In the Grand Beginning, there was Nonbeing. This Nonbeing refers to the existence of this wondrous Nonbeing.\"* He also said: *\"Nonbeing has no name. The nameless is the absence of forced names.\"* Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\"* Forced to name its universal generation, it is called the Dao. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The named is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nZhuangzi further said: *\"That by which things obtain life is called virtue.\"* Virtue (*de*) means attainment (*de*), signifying that the myriad transformations of heaven and earth, the lateral communication of all things, all rely on the wondrous root for their generation and completion. Attaining life is virtue. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"The Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\"* Hence, the Dao is the substance of virtue, and virtue is the function of the Dao.\n\nThe division of the Scripture into upper and lower fascicles first clarifies the Dao, followed by virtue. However, while the names of substance and function may be separated, their reality cannot. Thus, the Scripture states: *\"They emerge together yet have different names; together they are called the Mysterious.\"* Speaking of their emergence, they divide into two; inquiring into their unity, they merge into one. Hence, it is said they may be separated yet cannot be separated.\n\nThus, the upper fascicle states: *\"This is called mysterious virtue,\"* and: *\"The bearing of the profoundly virtuous,\"* and: *\"The virtuous are aligned with virtue,\"* and: *\"Constant virtue does not depart.\"* The lower fascicle states: *\"Lose the Dao, then virtue,\"* and: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Dao,\"* and: *\"The Dao generates the One,\"* and: *\"The Great Dao is utterly level.\"* Thus, substance and function are mutually expounded, alternately clarifying the essentials—there is no need to rigidly assign them to the upper or lower fascicles.\n\nThe term *jing* (scripture) means \"path,\" signifying the path of communication; it also means \"constant,\" signifying the constant path of communication.\n\nEver mindful of our sagely ancestor’s bequeathed teachings and the plans left for his descendants, in moments of respite from governance, I have devoted myself to lecturing and reading. Now, I once again elucidate a few of its essential mysteries. Words cannot exhaust meaning; I roughly set forth the great outline to aid scholars.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Commentary on the True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Fascicle One**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThis chapter clarifies the origin of the wondrous root and the ancestral source of the myriad transformations. It first sets forth the forced appellation of ultimate emptiness, then elucidates the return of all wonders to their source.\n\nThus, *\"the Dao that can be spoken\"* clarifies substance and function; *\"the nameless\"* and *\"the named\"* clarify root and trace; *\"no desire\"* and *\"desire\"* clarify the two modes of observation; *\"emerging together yet having different names\"* clarifies the dispersal of the uncarved block into vessels; *\"together called the Mysterious\"* clarifies the return of vessels to the uncarved block; *\"mysterious and again mysterious\"* distinguishes the forgetting of both; *\"the gate of all wonders\"* points to the attainment of enlightenment.\n\nThese are the gradual steps of progressive cultivation and the great method of embodied realization.\n\n***\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"***\n\n**Commentary:** The Dao is the forced appellation for the ultimate emptiness and wondrous root. It means \"to communicate\" and \"path.\" The first character establishes the宗 (foundation).\n\n*\"That can be spoken\"* means this wondrous root universally generates the myriad things, serving as the path by which the myriad things emerge. It may be called the Dao, hence *\"that can be spoken.\"*\n\n*\"Not the constant Dao\"* means the wondrous root’s generation and transformation have no fixed method. Forced to name it, it cannot be exhaustively described. Thus, it may be called *\"great,\"* or *\"receding,\"* or *\"distant,\"* or *\"near\"*—it is not constant to one Dao. Hence, *\"not the constant Dao.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**\"The name that can be named is not the constant name.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Name\"* refers to the designation applied to things, the name derived from the Dao’s function. The first character likewise establishes the *宗* (foundation). *\"That can be named\"* means names arise from function and may thus be established. *\"Not the constant name\"* means: in heaven, it is called *\"pure\"*; on earth, it is called *\"tranquil.\"* Though the attainment of the One is not distinct, when constrained by function, names differ. Thus, it is not constant to one name. Hence, *\"not the constant name.\"*\n\n**\"Nameless—the beginning of heaven and earth.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Nameless\"* means that before the myriad transformations arose, no forced appellation existed. Thus, *Zhuangzi* states: *\"In the Great Beginning, there was Non-Being; Non-Being had no name.\"* Yet when the wondrous root descended as *qi* and opened heaven and earth, heaven and earth mutually sustained each other as their primordial beginning. Hence, *\"nameless—the beginning of heaven and earth.\"* This corresponds to the *Yijing*’s *\"Great Ultimate generating the Two Modes.\"* The annotation *\"权舆\"* (beginning) cites the *Erya*: *\"权舆* means *beginning*.\"\n\n**\"Named—the mother of the myriad things.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Named\"* means that in response to function, things are crafted, and forced appellations arise. Once the myriad transformations unfold and the ten thousand things take form, the wondrous root pervades all, sustaining human use. Through its abundant nurturance, it is called *\"mother\"*—*\"mother\"* signifying the principle of flourishing nourishment. Thus, *\"nameless\"* and *\"named\"* are distinctions the sage makes regarding function to clarify the identity and difference of root and trace, yet the Dao is not bound to either named or nameless.\n\n**\"Constantly without desire, observe its mystery; constantly with desire, observe its manifestations.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Desire\"* is the movement of nature, the arising of mind in pursuit of objects. To *\"constantly be without desire\"* means the true nature is pure and still; turning inward to illumine the source of the Dao, one observes the wondrous root. If there is desire, the mind arises in pursuit of objects, and nature is disturbed by desire. Observing the root through desire, one loses the harmony of the mean and sees only its edges and boundaries. *\"徼\"* means *\"boundary.\"*\n\n**Alternative Explanation:** *\"Desire\"* refers to the act of contemplative intent. It means establishing teachings through the presence of intent. *\"Constantly without desire\"* means the Dharma is pure and still, free from verbal expression, without contemplative intent—thus one perceives the subtlety of the Dao. *\"Constantly with desire\"* means proceeding from the root to function, establishing teachings through words, responding to things and penetrating all, transforming and perfecting the world—thus one sees the convergence of the multitude. *\"徼\"* means *\"convergence.\"*\n\n**\"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"These\"* refers to the above matters. *\"Two\"* denotes *\"that which can be spoken\"* and *\"that which can be named,\"* *\"nameless\"* and *\"named,\"* *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire\"*—each forming a pair. Hence, *\"two.\"* Both derive from the wondrous root, thus *\"emerge from the same source.\"* Yet as names are established according to function, they differ.\n\n**\"Together they are called the profound.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Profound\"* means *\"deep and wondrous.\"* In terms of emergence, names differ—this is the descent from root to trace. In terms of unity, it is deep and wondrous—this is the return of trace to root. Returning to the root is deep and wondrous, hence *\"called the profound.\"*\n\n**\"Profound and yet again profound—the gateway of the manifold mysteries.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** Returning trace to root is called *\"profound.\"* Yet if one abides in this profundity, traces re-emerge, and names differ once more, equal and without distinction. Thus, by borrowing *\"again profound\"* to transcend *\"profound,\"* one is urged not to cling to profundity. When root and trace are both forgotten, this is called *\"non-abiding.\"* In non-abiding, one attains *\"emergent realization.\"* The annotation *\"意因不生\"* (no arising of intent) cites the *Xisheng Jing*: *\"Emerging together yet bearing different forms, each generates its own intent.\"* Now, with no arising of intent, one is united in profound wondrousness. *\"Without desire for the absence of desire\"* means that to seek the absence of desire is still to harbor a desiring mind. To seek the absence of desire is not yet free from desire. Now, with neither desire nor the absence of desire, transcending one after another, all is utterly forgotten. Such correct contemplation is the manifold mysteries. Though the mysteries are many, if one emerges through this gateway, it is called *\"the gateway of the manifold mysteries.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two**\nThe preceding chapter clarified the difference between the wondrous root’s generation and transformation and the two modes of observation. This chapter reveals how, when the uncarved block scatters, causes diverge into myriad distinctions, and one pursues objects, drifting and wandering. Yet through skillful transformation, one returns to the root. Thus, it begins by exposing the deluded attachment to beauty and goodness, then demonstrates the mutual subversion of being and non-being, concluding with the sage’s principle to guide the return to primordial simplicity.\n\n**\"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.\"**",
      "overlap_context": "That can be spoken\"* means this wondrous root universally generates the myriad things, serving as the path by which the myriad things emerge. It may be called the Dao, hence *\"that can be spoken.\"*\n\n*\"Not the constant Dao\"* means the wondrous root’s generation and transformation have no fixed method. Forced to name it, it cannot be exhaustively described. Thus, it may be called *\"great,\"* or *\"receding,\"* or *\"distant,\"* or *\"near\"*—it is not constant to one Dao. Hence, *\"not the constant Dao.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary:**\n\"All under heaven\" refers broadly to everything beneath the encompassing sky. \"Beauty\" denotes what the heart finds sweet and pleasing. \"Goodness\" signifies what the body enacts. It speaks of how all people under heaven recognize as beauty what their own hearts find sweet, and as goodness what their own bodies practice. Thus, those who favor sweetness reject bitterness; those who cherish vermilion dismiss plainness. In mutual contention and rivalry, they vie in asserting right and wrong—all arising from the stirring of desire. Hence, beauty and ugliness arise in succession.\n\nThe sage knows that beauty and ugliness have no fixed essence; both are deluded attachments. Such attachments are impermanent, and thus it is said, \"ugliness arises.\" *Yi* serves as a grammatical particle.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"The wondrous and the putrid\"*—as *Zhuangzi* states: what is deemed wondrous is called \"divine and marvelous,\" while what is despised is called \"foul and rotten.\"\n\n**\"Being and non-being give rise to each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of being and non-being in their nature. Being does not arise of itself but comes into existence through non-being; the common view mistakenly holds that non-being generates being. Non-being does not arise of itself but comes into existence through being; the common view mistakenly holds that being generates non-being. Thus, it is said they \"give rise to each other.\" Yet in the pairing of being and non-being, they do not inherently generate one another. The notion of \"giving rise\" arises only from deluded attachment. Just as beauty and ugliness do not arise from inherent nature, all is empty. The sage, wishing to rescue the deluded from their stagnation, thus enumerates the six confusions.\n\n**\"Difficulty and ease complete each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of difficulty and ease in their nature. What is difficult for one becomes easy for another; what is easy for one becomes difficult for another—just as a carpenter finds wood easy but clay difficult, while a potter finds clay easy but wood difficult. Thus, it is said, \"difficulty and ease complete each other.\" If all shared the same difficulty, there would be no ease; if all shared the same ease, there would be no difficulty. Difficulty and ease have no true substance; their names arise from delusion. Such is the emptiness of dharmas. Therefore, one who fully understands this forgets both skill and clumsiness, and the names of difficulty and ease cease—just as beauty and ugliness have no fixed nature.\n\n**\"Long and short reveal each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the mutual emptiness of long and short. Long reveals short, and short reveals long—thus, it is said, \"long and short reveal each other.\" Just as the leg of a teal is not inherently short, but appears so because the crane’s leg is long (and lengthening it would cause distress), and the crane’s leg is not inherently long, but appears so because the teal’s leg is short (and shortening it would bring sorrow). Seeing long and short as relative is like beauty and ugliness: lacking fixed standards, all is deluded attachment.\n\n**\"High and low incline toward each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of the names \"high\" and \"low.\" The two terms mutually contend and supplant one another. To call something high depends on what is low, yet there is always something higher; to call something low depends on what is high, yet there is always something lower. Thus, what is called high is not truly high, and what is called low is not truly low. In the world, those with rank and title alternately serve as ministers and servants—all is impermanent and empty, lacking fixed position.\n\n**\"Sound and voice harmonize with each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of harmony. When the five notes blend, who composes the melody? It is the combination of all sounds that enables the creation of music. Like worldly dharmas, all arise from harmony, yet their essence is not real—all is empty. How, then, can one definitively judge beauty and ugliness? Such is not the discourse of true insight.\n\n**\"Before and after follow each other.\"**\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the emptiness of the three times in thought. The sun and moon alternate, each succeeding the other with renewal. Like taking a step, which comes first—before or after? The names \"before\" and \"after\" arise only from their mutual following. Names are established by delusion—who knows their origin? Past, future, and present—all three times are empty, for thoughts shift moment by moment. This, too, is like beauty and ugliness, which have no fixed names.\n\n**\"Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\"**\n**Commentary:** \"Therefore\" introduces what follows to illuminate what precedes. Those who adorn themselves with cunning and deceit, though silent, do not embody non-action. Those who embrace authenticity and simplicity, though gesturing all day, remain ever at ease. Thus, the sage, knowing the emptiness of all dharmas, is free from attachment. To govern all under heaven, one must abandon superficiality and employ pure virtue, so that the people are transformed and each rests in their proper place. When each rests in their proper place, there is no disturbance—is this not the affair of non-action? Words arise from one’s own mind yet align with the hearts of all under heaven. Thus, though one may speak all their life, they have never truly spoken—is this not the teaching without words?\n\n**\"The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them.\"**\n**Commentary:** *Arise* means to move; *refuse* means to decline or reject. The sage, skilled in transformation, engages in no affairs and practices non-action. The people, unaware, wander and rejoice, each following their own movements without offering thanks to the sage. Thus, they drum on their bellies and play in the earth, forgetting the emperor’s power—this is the people forgetting the sage’s merit.\n\n**\"He gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely on it, accomplishes yet does not dwell in it.\"**\n**Commentary:** Allowing things to fulfill their nature, the sage does not claim them as his own. Enabling things to pursue their endeavors, the sage does not regard them as his achievement. Even as the great work of peace extends ever further, he remains as cautious in the end as at the beginning, never daring to rest. This is the sage forgetting his own merit.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"Day by day, he grows more cautious\"*—a phrase from the *Book of Documents*.\n\n**\"Only because he does not dwell in it does it not leave him.\"**\n**Commentary:** The sage, straight as an arrow yet ever vigilant, maintains the same care at the end as at the beginning, never faltering from start to finish. Never resting in ease or indulgence, his virtue daily renews. Forgetting his merit, the merit does not depart; illuminating the world, all under heaven is at peace. Thus, it is said, \"Only because he does not dwell in it does it not leave him.\"\n\n**\"Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how the myriad distinctions pursue objects, yet through skillful transformation, one returns to the root. This chapter reveals that when exalting the worthy is not practiced, non-action leads to the ultimate principle.

      "translated_text": "**\"Not Exalting the Worthy\" (continued)**\n\nBy not exalting the worthy, the people are made not to contend.\n*Commentary:* *Exalting* means to honor and esteem; *worthy* refers to talent and ability. If the ruler honors talent and ability, those who advance will embellish falsehoods, chasing appearances and losing their true nature. The loss of truth is the very cause of exalting the worthy, and the pursuit of appearances inevitably gives rise to the ill of contention. How much better to mold them through profound transformation, entrusting all to non-action—like clouds naturally following the dragon, or wind ever accompanying the tiger. Then, with Yao and Shun upon the throne, there will be no lack of ministers like the *yuan* and *kai*; Yi and Lü will ascend the court, naturally attaining the esteem of the *taiheng*. Each will remain in their proper place, and none will covet what is not theirs, thus ending contention.\n\nBy not prizing rare and precious goods, the people are made not to steal.\n*Commentary:* In receiving life, each is allotted a portion. The materials, tools, and treasures of the body are the goods of one’s allotted share; to seek beyond this is to desire what cannot be obtained, hence \"rare and precious.\" To disregard one’s inherent nature and yearn for cleverness is to lose one’s celestial truth and become a thief of the private. Now, if the wise and foolish alike follow their nature, employing their faculties as they ought, there will be no transgressive desires, and rare goods will naturally be held in light regard. When all abide within their allotted nature, who would steal? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"The benevolence of the unbenevolent steals the essence of life and nature, glutting itself on wealth and honor.\" Another interpretation: If the ruler does not prize pearls, rhinoceros horns, or precious treasures, his governance will be pure and tranquil. The people, transformed by this, will themselves renounce greed, each knowing contentment, and thus none will steal.\n\nBy not displaying what is desirable, the heart is made not to be confused.\n*Commentary:* Yearning for cleverness is to see what is desirable. When desire arises and stirs, what is this if not confusion? Now, since one neither exalts worthy ability nor transgresses one’s allotted portion with vain seeking, one does not see what is desirable, and the heart is not deluded or disordered.\n\nThus, in the governance of the sage,\n*Commentary:* The sage governs the state and orders the self, taking this as the foundation of teaching. What, then, is there to do in governing the state? It is simply to order the self. Therefore, empty the heart and fill the belly, extinguish desire and forget knowledge. In acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well-ordered.\n\nEmpty their hearts,\n*Commentary:* When the heart is employed in pursuing external things, worldly affairs cloud and confuse it. When contemplation is tranquil and truth is preserved whole, emotions and desires do not arise. When emotions and desires do not arise, the heart is empty. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The empty room gives birth to brightness,\" meaning that when the heart is empty, pure brightness arises alone. Thus, it is said: empty their hearts.\n\nFill their bellies,\n*Commentary:* The belly is the faculty of containment and receptivity. When it is full, there is no greed. It is desired that virtue and power fill one inwardly, so that no covetous love arises. Thus, it is said: fill their bellies. The note refers to the remonstrance of Mo Ruo of the state of Chen during the Spring and Autumn period, who admonished Wei Xianzi, wishing to take the belly of the petty man as the heart of the noble one—content when sated, ceasing to eat.\n\nWeaken their ambitions,\n*Commentary:* Ambition is the heart’s affair; what resides in the heart is called ambition. It is desired that all the heart’s movements be guarded by softness and weakness. Thus, it is known that when the heart is empty, ambition is weak.\n\nStrengthen their bones.\n*Commentary:* The bones are the body’s framework. When virtue and power fill one inwardly, there is no covetous grasping. Without covetousness, the belly is full; when the belly is full, the bones are naturally strong.\n\nEver cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire,\n*Commentary:* The reason the sage practices the teaching of emptying the heart and filling the belly is to ever cause the people to be without the knowledge of contention and exaltation, without the desires of covetous seeking, allowing them to transform themselves.\n\nAnd cause those with knowledge not to dare act.\n*Commentary:* Those without knowledge and desire are already pure and tranquil. Thus, those with knowledge are gradually molded and transformed by their purity, not daring to act in pursuit of appearances or covetous seeking, and so act through non-action.\n\nAct through non-action, and nothing is not well-ordered.\n*Commentary:* To act in accordance with one’s nature is to act without acting. Moreover, by eliminating the traces of exalting the worthy and not seeking rare goods, people abide within their allotted portions, and things surely preserve their true nature. In acting through non-action, what need is there for ostentation or pursuit in transformation? Since there is no fragrance and no stench, people thus do not recognize or know. With the great flourishing of pure wind, who would say it is not well-ordered?\n\n**\"Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Emptiness\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when exalting the worthy is not practiced, non-action leads to the ultimate principle. This chapter reveals the function of the wondrous root, acting through non-action. It begins by marking the Dao’s emptiness to show the origin of utmost vacuity, then speaks of subduing and untying to clarify how emptiness resolves entanglements. Next, it expounds the marvel of harmony and sameness, its radiance untainted by dust, concluding with the image of preceding the Emperor, desiring that all know where to return.\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet in its use it is never exhausted. Profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\n*Commentary:* *Empty* means vacuous; it is said that the Dao employs emptiness as its function. The harmonious *qi* is empty, thus it functions as the Dao. In its functioning, it gives birth to the myriad things, and things receive its power. If one speaks of its power, things doubt its vastness; if one speaks of its emptiness, the Dao has never been full. Yet its wondrous root is deep and tranquil, ever the ancestor of the myriad things. It is said \"seems\" because the Dao is not a fixed thing, thus it is not spoken of directly. The rest follow this example.\n\nSubdue its sharpness, untie its entanglements.\n*Commentary:* *Subdue* means to restrain; *sharpness* means keen and cutting. *Untie* means to release; *entanglements* means many disturbances. The function of emptiness is not opposed by things, thus the heart’s keenness and the affairs’ disturbances, when mindful of the Dao’s emptiness and harmony, are naturally restrained and released. This is to take the person to clarify the Dao’s function. The note refers to the \"Mending Nature\" chapter of *Zhuangzi*, which says: \"Mending nature through the vulgar, using vulgar learning to seek to return to one’s beginning.\" It means that keenness and entanglements arise from desire, thus mindfulness of the Dao subdues and unties them, while vulgar learning only further binds them.\n\nHarmonize its radiance, blend with its dust. Abysmal! It seems perhaps to exist.\n*Commentary:* The Dao’s empty function does not abandon things. In radiance, it is one with radiance; in dust, it is one with dust. It is nowhere not present, yet where it is, it is ever without form. In its empty function, it can merge radiance and dust; in its wondrous root, it is abysmally still and not confined. Thus, it is said \"seems perhaps.\"",

      "translated_text": "I know not whose child it is—it seems to precede the semblance of the Lord.\n*Commentary:* \"I\" refers to the Old Master’s self-designation. \"Semblance\" means \"to resemble.\" The Old Master says: I observe the Dao’s empty function, which gives life to and completes the myriad things. Tracing its origin, I cannot fathom its source. Since there is no one who acts as its father, I know not whose child the Dao is. Yet all things rely on the Dao to be born, so it seems to exist before the Lord. The note says: the Lord is the master of all living things. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Lord emerges from the Thunder.\" Fu Xi comments: \"The Lord is the master of living things, the source of growth and benefit.\" Another interpretation: \"Semblance\" means \"to manifest signs.\" This Lord of living things can manifest the forms of things, hence it is called the \"Semblance-Lord.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 5**\nThe previous chapter clarified the wondrous root and empty function, embodying non-action in both essence and application. This chapter reveals how partial love fosters selfishness, and partiality makes universality difficult. It begins by likening the myriad things to straw dogs to illustrate Heaven and Earth’s impartial forgetfulness, then compares them to a bellows to show how emptiness remains inexhaustible and unobstructed. It concludes with the admonition that excessive speech leads to exhaustion, urging one to abide in centered harmony.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not humane—they regard the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not humane—he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n*Commentary:* \"Humane\" refers to the term for universal love. \"Straw\" is grass; straw dogs are made of bound grass for sacrificial use. *Zhuangzi* says: Master Jin said to Yan Hui: \"Before straw dogs are displayed, they are wrapped in embroidered silk. Once displayed, the gatherers of firewood take them to burn.\" Now, Heaven and Earth, being supremely humane, give life to and complete all things. Yet like one who binds grass into dogs, they do not demand the merit of barking or guarding, nor do they regard their act of giving life as a benevolent favor—hence they are called \"not humane.\" Thus, the sage who lets the world be should view the hundred clans in the same way. The note says: \"Concealing kindness\" refers to the *Record of Rites*, where Confucius says: \"Even when covering [a dead dog], one does not discard it.\" \"Not only loving one’s own kin\" is a passage from the *Record of Rites*.\n\nIs not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\n*Commentary:* A \"bellows\" is a leather sack used to blow air and fan fire. A \"pipe\" is a flute. That Heaven and Earth regard the myriad things as straw dogs is because their space is empty, so they give life without partiality and do not seek gratitude. It is like a bellows blowing wind or a flute emitting breath—constantly responding to requests, yet without attachment. Thus, it remains empty without exhaustion or obstruction, and the more it moves, the more it produces sound and qi. This serves as a model for rulers: if they empty their minds and embrace profound silence, their transformation will be pure and uniform, without exhaustion or obstruction. In daily use, they will act without knowing, and the more they move, the more they will produce.\n\nExcessive speech leads to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center.\n*Commentary:* \"Excessive speech\" refers to many words of universal love. Though one may speak much of universal love, putting it into practice is difficult to achieve universally, so one often meets with exhaustion and failure. Thus, it is better to forget concerns and respond emptily, embracing centered harmony—then all will naturally be sufficient. The note says: \"Not reciprocating\" means \"to answer.\" It refers to having empty words without corresponding action.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 6**\nThe previous chapter revealed how partial love fosters selfishness, and partiality makes universality difficult. This chapter clarifies how supreme emptiness responds, and such response is inexhaustible. It begins by invoking the Valley Spirit to illustrate the Dao through its spiritual function, then speaks of the Mysterious Female to distinguish the mysterious power that mothers all things. It concludes with the subtle and ceaseless, showing how empty response requires no toil.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.\n*Commentary:* The \"Valley Spirit\" illustrates how a valley echoes sound, resembling how the Dao responds to things—it responds to stimuli as if spiritually. \"Spirit\" is the name for the unfathomable. \"Death\" means rest or cessation. The unfathomable response never rests, hence it is said the Valley Spirit does not die. \"Mysterious\" means profound. \"Female\" means mother. The Valley Spirit’s response is profoundly subtle and indescribable; all things flourish and are nourished by it, hence it is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n*Commentary:* The Mysterious Female’s function responds to all stimuli, and its response emerges from things, hence it is called a \"gate.\" Heaven and Earth are the greatest of the formed. Without the Mysterious Female’s function, they would disperse and dissipate. Thus, they rely on and receive the One as their root, hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nCeaselessly, as if existing—its use is not toilsome.\n*Commentary:* \"Ceaselessly\" conveys the meaning of subtle and unbroken. The Mysterious Female’s function responds to things without partiality. Its subtlety is described as \"as if existing,\" and its impartiality means its use does not grow weary.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 7**\nThe previous chapter clarified how the Valley Spirit’s empty response is inexhaustible. This chapter reveals how Heaven and Earth are selfless, and selflessness makes them enduring. It begins by using Heaven and Earth as an analogy, then turns to the sage to further illustrate, concluding with how selflessness achieves selfish ends, urging diligence in this practice.\n\nHeaven is enduring, Earth is lasting.\n*Commentary:* This marks the chapter’s theme. Heaven, by its qi and appearance, is called \"enduring.\" Earth, by its form and substance, is called \"lasting.\" The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can live long.\n\n*Commentary:* The previous line posed the question; this line offers a hypothetical answer: The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they cover and bear the myriad things, nurturing and raising all beings, all of which rely on and observe the wondrous root. They do not pride themselves on their power of giving life and completion—hence they can be enduring. Another interpretation: \"Do not live for themselves\" means Heaven and Earth merely give life to and nourish the myriad things, without enriching their own lives—hence they can be enduring.\n\nTherefore, the sage places himself behind yet finds himself ahead; sets himself outside yet finds himself preserved.\n*Commentary:* Therefore, the sage emulates Heaven and Earth’s covering and bearing, bestowing equal nurture without partiality. Thus, he defers to others, and the people rejoice in and rely on him, looking up to him as their leader—hence he finds himself ahead.",

It is nowhere not present, yet where it is, it is ever without form. In its empty function, it can merge radiance and dust; in its wondrous root, it is abysmally still and not confined. Thus, it is said \"seems perhaps.\"",

      "translated_text": "The sage does not exalt himself in honor, but instead humbles his own person, so the world turns toward benevolence, free from fear or harm—thus his person is preserved. Is it not because he is without self-interest? Therefore he can fulfill his own interest.\n\n*Commentary:* Is it not because Heaven and Earth have no self-interested heart that they can achieve their enduring preservation, and the sage can find himself ahead and preserved? Is it not because of this absence of self-interest that they fulfill their own enduring preservation and precedence?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water**\nThe previous chapter clarified that Heaven and Earth, being without self-interest in giving life and completion, endure long. This chapter clarifies that the perfected person, practicing goodness through softness and weakness, remains free from blame. It begins by likening the highest virtue to water, illustrating how its three capacities approximate the Dao. Next, it describes dwelling in lowly places, enumerating the seven virtues that benefit all things. It concludes with the principle of non-contention, urging the preservation of softness to achieve complete victory.\n\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\n*Commentary:* \"The highest virtue\" refers to the person. \"Resembles water\" is the analogy. The perfected person, with an empty mind, abides in non-attachment, forgetting goodness yet embodying the highest goodness. The conduct of the highest virtue, like the capacities of water, is fully expounded below, containing both principle and analogy.\n\nWater benefits the myriad things yet does not contend; it dwells where the multitude disdain.\n*Commentary:* Water’s nature is sweet and cool, scattering and moistening all things. Those who receive its moisture and benefit grow—hence it is said to \"benefit,\" this being its first capacity. Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water; its levelness can be taken as a model, its clarity can reflect people. When it flows and encounters hollows, it yields and follows. Wherever it is led, it never contends—this is its second capacity. All people shun lowly places, but water flows downward, embracing the turbid and dwelling in the foul without refusal—this is its third capacity. Thus it nearly approximates the Dao.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Near\" means close. Benefiting things demonstrates its great benefit; non-contention manifests its softness and weakness; dwelling in the foul shows its capacity to endure disgrace. These three capacities of water’s nature are unified in the perfected person. With conduct such as this, he is not far from the Dao—hence it is said to be \"near.\"\n\nDwelling in goodness, it abides in the earth.\n*Commentary:* Where the perfected person dwells, he is good at benefiting others. Like water on the earth, its benefits to things are many. Moreover, the earth’s way is to be lowly, and water loves to flow downward, both resembling the perfected person’s humility and compliance, approximating the Dao’s nature of softness and weakness—hence it is said to \"dwell in goodness, abiding in the earth.\"\n\nIts heart is good in its depth.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s heart is good at tranquility, like water’s nature, still and deep as a spring. When water is still, it is clear and bright; when the heart is at leisure, it attains enlightenment. \"Depth\" means profound stillness—hence it is said the \"heart is good in its depth.\"\n\nIn giving, it is good in benevolence.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s great aid is always to give to others. The merit of his generous bestowal accords with benevolent conduct. Like water moistening things, it is without partiality of love or aversion—hence it is said to \"give in goodness, embodying benevolence.\"\n\nIn speech, it is good in sincerity.\n*Commentary:* The person of highest virtue speaks with utmost truthfulness, transforming the common people with good faith and sincerity, never deceiving. Like a flowing spring, how could it differ in treacherous terrain? Hence it is said to \"speak in goodness, embodying sincerity.\"\n*Note:* \"Moving through danger without losing its sincerity\" is the *Zhouyi* hexagram *Kan*’s line statement.\n\nIn governance, it is good in order.\n*Commentary:* \"Governance\" means rectitude. The perfected person, in all affairs, acts without self-will, rectifying his demeanor to awaken things, so that things follow his rectitude. When rectitude prevails, is this not goodness? Like water’s nature, washing and cleansing all things, making them pure and still—hence it is said to \"govern in goodness, bringing order.\"\n\nIn affairs, it is good in ability.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person is perfectly enlightened, unhindered by things. In all movements and undertakings, he is thoroughly capable. This capability is called luminous understanding. Like water’s nature, when channeled it becomes a river, when dammed it becomes a pond. It floats boats and embraces the void, accomplishing all things—this is its goodness in ability.\n\nIn movement, it is good in timing.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s heart is like an empty valley, comparable to a mirror or reflection: when things stir, it responds. Like water’s nature, melting in spring and freezing in winter, it ebbs and flows with the seasons—hence it is said to \"move in goodness, embodying timeliness.\"\n\nOnly by not contending does it remain free from blame.\n*Commentary:* \"Blame\" means fault. The perfected person’s good conduct does no harm to things. With an empty heart, he bends to preserve all, never contending. Flowing like waves, yielding and submissive, he never opposes things—thus he remains free from the realm of fault and blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding to Fullness**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the perfected person, practicing goodness through softness and weakness, remains free from blame. This chapter clarifies that the common people, drowning in emotion and prideful fullness, incur fault. It begins by illustrating the difficulty of preserving fullness and sharpness, then warns against the pursuit of gold, jade, and wealth, concluding with the principle of withdrawing when one’s name is achieved and work is done, urging the forgetting of merit and non-abiding.\n\nHolding to fullness is not as good as stopping.\n*Commentary:* \"Holding\" means grasping. \"Fullness\" means repletion. \"Stopping\" means cessation. The human heart is greedy and covetous, seeking without satiety. Grasping and preserving, it strives to make things full. Accumulating wealth becomes a burden, and regret and misfortune inevitably arise. Thus the sage warns: it is better to cease.\n\nSharpening to a point cannot be long preserved.\n*Commentary:* \"Sharpening\" means measuring. \"Point\" means sharpness. The common people, mired in attachment, covet glory and profit. Thus they measure past affairs, honing their desires to a sharp edge. Ghosts watch, people resent, and calamity and fault are invited—hence it is said this cannot be long preserved.\n\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can guard them.\n*Commentary:* If covetousness is never abandoned, it may lead to gold and jade filling the hall. Yet the elephant’s tusks bring fire upon its body, and the pheasant fears the sacrificial altar and cuts off its tail. Losing the treasure of non-covetousness, one sits and invites the worry of bandits and thieves. How can such harm be called \"guarding\"? This further explains the difficulty of holding to fullness.\n\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance bring one’s own fault.\n*Commentary:* \"Bring\" means to give. Wealth invites others to seek it, hence one easily deceives things. Honor invites others to submit, hence one delights in overpowering others. Arrogance and extravagance arise unexpectedly, and calamity and fault come—who is to blame? Since fault arises from arrogance, and arrogance is born of the self, it is said to \"bring one’s own fault.\" This further explains the difficulty of sharpening to a point.\n\nWhen merit is achieved, name established, and the body withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "This presents a warning. For fullness invites loss, while humility readily receives benefit. Even Heaven’s Way does not remain constantly full—thus those who achieve merit collapse, and those who establish fame suffer decline. To seek long preservation, such words have never been heard. One must forget both merit and fame, withdraw the self, and decline excess. Following Heaven’s Way, one does not lose the balance of fullness and emptiness, and thus bears no worry or blame.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Po-Soul**\nThe previous chapter showed how indulgence in desire and arrogance in fullness bring fault; this chapter reveals that nurturing the spirit and cherishing qi without admixture leaves no flaw. From \"Nurturing the po-soul\" to \"cleansing and purifying\" instructs on cultivating the body to preserve virtue. From \"loving the people\" to \"understanding clearly\" demonstrates that when virtue is whole, one may become a ruler. The conclusion with \"giving life and nourishing\" illustrates the mysterious power extending to all things.\n\n**\"Nurturing the po-soul and embracing the One—can one not be separated from it?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Nurturing\" (載) means the beginning. \"Nurturing\" (營) means to protect. When a person first receives life and begins transformation, there is only an empty form. Once the po-soul is born, yang qi fills the empty po. When the po can move, it is called the hun-soul—like the moon’s po reflecting the sun, light is born. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and Zichan say: \"At the beginning of human life, it is called po. Once po is born, yang becomes hun.\" This means that when one first possesses the empty po, one should nurture and protect the yang qi, keeping it always full, so that life may be preserved whole. If movement and use are inconsistent, scattering the yang qi, one reverts to an empty po and perishes. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The heart near death—do not let it regain yang.\" Thus, one is instructed to nurture and protect the empty po, restoring yang to preserve life, embracing and guarding pure oneness without admixture, never separating from the body—then life is preserved whole. This teaches the nurturing of spirit.\n\n**\"Concentrating qi to attain softness—can one be like an infant?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Concentrating\" means focusing singularly. \"Qi\" is the subtle, harmonious qi. The foundation of human life is the primordial qi. If one is tainted by worldly realms, the primordial qi scatters, and the spirit cannot stabilize the body. Thus, one is warned to concentrate the harmonious qi, attaining softness and weakness, able to be like an infant, without attachment. This teaches the nurturing of qi.\n\n**\"Cleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror—can one be without flaw?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Cleansing\" means washing. \"Purifying\" means ordering. \"Mysterious mirror\" is the illumination of the heart. \"Flaw\" is sickness. When one indulges in worldly attachments, desire arises. One must wash and order, purifying the heart’s illumination so that love and desire do not arise—can one then be without flaw? This teaches the cleansing of the heart.\n\n**\"Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without contrivance?\"**\n*Commentary:* \"Loving the people\" means not oppressing them with sudden labor, nor harming their nature with service. \"Governing the state\" means prioritizing agriculture and valuing grain, simplifying affairs to avoid vexation—then the people live in peace, transformed without words. This is \"without contrivance\"—can one do this?\n\n**\"The heavenly gate opens and closes—can one act as the female?\"**\n*Commentary:* To become a ruler, one must receive the mandate of succession—this \"heavenly gate\" is where the imperial mandate emerges. \"Opening\" means receiving the mandate; \"closing\" means being deposed. Heaven bestows its precious mandate to bless the virtuous. If one can guard feminine softness, one may enjoy supreme fortune. Thus, it says: \"Can one act as the female?\"\n\nAnother explanation: The *Book of Changes* says: \"Opening and closing are called change.\" This means the sage establishes teachings, responding to change without constancy, not relying on masculine strength but guarding the feminine and yielding—just as the heavenly gate opens and closes, diminishing the full and benefiting the humble.\n\n**\"Understanding clearly in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"**\n*Commentary:* Once the ruler receives the mandate and governs all under heaven, if one can guard feminine stillness, one’s virtue becomes clear, shining like the sun in all four directions. One’s power extends to all things without claiming it as one’s own—this is called forgetting merit as if without knowledge. Thus, it says: \"Can one be without knowledge?\"\n\n**\"Giving life and nourishing.\"**\n*Commentary:* The later text says: \"The Dao gives life; virtue nourishes.\" Here, \"giving life and nourishing\" means that when the ruler models the Dao’s clarity and stillness, all things attain their natural growth. Emulating virtue’s vast aid, all things fulfill their nourishment. Thus, it says: \"giving life and nourishing.\"\n\n**\"Giving life without possessing, acting without relying, leading without dominating—this is called mysterious virtue.\"**\n*Commentary:* When things attain their natural growth, the sage forgets merit and use. When growth is attained, the principle of life is self-sufficient; when merit is forgotten, its use remains whole. This is achieving the private through the public, becoming the true ruler without dominating. Thus, \"giving life without possessing\" means allowing all things to attain their growth, without the ruler claiming them as his own. \"Acting without relying\" means allowing all things to fulfill their functions without boasting of one’s own merit. \"Leading without dominating\" means standing above the myriad people—thus called \"leading\"—yet not relying on merit, thus called \"without dominating.\" Such is called profound and mysterious virtue.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Scroll One, concludes.**\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Scroll Two begins.**\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**",

      "translated_text": "The previous chapter expounded on nurturing the spirit and cherishing qi without admixture to avoid flaws; this chapter reveals how the beneficial and the useful, the existent and the nonexistent, mutually support one another to establish merit. Thus, Heaven and Earth embody the profound subtlety of the Great Simplicity, while shafts and wheels manifest the substance of nonbeing. Taking the vehicle as a metaphor, it illustrates the utility of existence to complete its meaning.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub; it is in their \"nothingness\" that the use of the cart lies.\n**Commentary:** Thirty spokes converge upon a single hub, showing how the few are mastered by the many. Only when the hub is empty and void does the cart’s function of movement arise. This clarifies how nonexistence benefits existence.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is the utterly nonexistent, the supremely One. Thus it can stir and animate all things, pervade and sustain all materials, allowing the ten thousand differences to be distinct yet formed by a single image, the myriad apertures to operate in concert yet sounded by a single resonance. Therefore, the origins of all movement and utility in the world, the foundations of all generation and completion, have never departed from the supremely One.\n\nConsider the cart and its wheels: the shafts and wheels exist, while the space within the cart is empty and void. Only when the cart’s interior is empty and void can it be put to use. If the shafts and wheels did not exist, the utility of the empty void would cease. If the cart’s interior were not empty and void, the shafts and wheels would all become useless objects.\n\nThus, when Heaven and Earth take their places, the efficacy of the *Yi* becomes manifest; when the myriad transformations flow and move, the function of the Dao is revealed. Therefore, by borrowing the utility of coarse existence and nonexistence, it clarifies how the utmost nonexistence benefits existence.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel; it is in its \"nothingness\" that the use of the vessel lies.\n**Commentary:** *Shan* means to blend; *zhi* is sticky clay. The note refers to the potter, as the *Book of Documents* states: \"To mold earth is called *tao* (pottery).\" The craftsman blends and shapes the clay, firing it into a vessel, which also relies on its hollow emptiness to serve as a receptacle.\n\nCarve doors and windows to make a room; it is in their \"nothingness\" that the use of the room lies.\n**Commentary:** *Zao* means to bore. Doors and side windows are called *you*. In ancient times, people dwelled in caves, as the *Odes* says: \"They dug and piled, dug and hollowed,\" referring to excavating the earth from the cave to cover its top, hence called *zao*. Later sages replaced these with palaces and chambers, utilizing the empty space within for human habitation. *Zhuangzi* says: \"If a room had no empty space, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would quarrel over the path,\" meaning they would contend for passage. The *Erya* states: \"A palace is called a room.\"\n\nThus, existence is for the sake of benefit, while nonexistence is for the sake of use.\n**Commentary:** The benefit of existence lies in its utility, and utility necessarily relies on nonexistence—hence existence takes nonexistence as its benefit. The use of nonexistence lies in its substance, and substance necessarily relies on existence—hence nonexistence takes existence as its benefit. The note says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel,\" a passage from the *Appended Judgments* of the *Yi*. From nonexistence, it is called the Dao; when it involves existence, it is called a vessel. To clarify the function of the Dao, one must rely on concrete vessels. Thus, it begins by borrowing metaphors from three transformations and ultimately seeks to apply nonexistence to a single principle.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nThe previous chapter revealed how the beneficial and the useful, the existent and the nonexistent, mutually support one another to establish merit; this chapter shows how indulging in sensory dusts and chasing after external realms leads to madness. It first presents colors and sounds to warn against harm to one’s proper nature, then discusses hunting to illustrate how pursuing desires scorches harmony. Finally, it concludes with the sage’s choices, demonstrating the essentials of preserving authenticity and safeguarding one’s nature.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the palate.\n**Commentary:** The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black; the five tones are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*; the five flavors are sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and pungent. *Shuang* means deviation. The eyes behold colors, the ears hear sounds, the mouth savors flavors—if one exceeds proper measure, harm cannot be avoided. Thus, one’s bodily faculties become deaf and blind, and the palate loses its sense of taste. Moreover, if one becomes infatuated with worldly sounds, colors, and other phenomena without awakening to their empty nature, not only will the bodily faculties become deaf and blind, but one’s wisdom will also be deaf and blind.\n\nChasing and hunting stir the heart to madness.\n**Commentary:** This refers to those who indulge in sounds and cling to colors, their desires racing like one who hunts, seeking only to kill and capture. As desire surges and chases after external realms, observing it calmly reveals it to be a heart driven to madness.\n\nRare and precious goods hinder conduct.\n**Commentary:** Rare and precious goods refer to the body’s vessels as commodities. What is meant by \"rare and precious goods\" are things beyond one’s inherent nature, which cannot be obtained through seeking. If one does not rest in one’s original nature but distorts it to seek falsely, deviating from naturalness, one’s conduct in the Dao will be hindered.\n\nThus, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\n**Commentary:** The belly receives without discrimination; the eyes, deluded by sights, cling to sensory dusts. Without discrimination, harmony is preserved—hence the sage acts for it. Clinging to sensory dusts harms one’s nature—hence the sage does not act for the eyes. Therefore, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**\nThe previous chapter showed how indulging in sensory dusts and chasing external realms leads to madness; this chapter reveals how favor and disgrace cause alarm and how valuing the body leads to suffering. It begins with two sentences stating the theme to raise a question, then uses ten sentences to explain the principle in response, and concludes with four sentences on valuing and cherishing without arrogance, employing metaphors to complete its meaning.\n\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm.\n**Commentary:** *Ruo* means \"like.\" It states that the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar. When one grasps it, it is favor; when one lets go, it is disgrace. It speaks of those who cannot equalize their hearts regarding honor and disgrace, who boast and pursue fame and power. When they hold authority, they take it as glory; when they lose power, they lament their lowly disgrace. Glory leads to arrogance, while disgrace brings alarm and sighs. Thus, it presents this warning to make them treat favor and disgrace as equal.\n\nValue great suffering as you do the body.\n**Commentary:** *Gui* means to esteem or value. *Ruo* also means \"like.\" The body is the source of calamity. Indulging in sounds and colors, competing for glory and splendor—all arise from having a body, which becomes the root of suffering.",

      "translated_text": "Those who esteem their bodies—how do they differ from those who esteem great suffering? Since the body itself is suffering, there is no distinction between them. One cannot be free from suffering precisely because one has a body. Thus, esteeming the body is no different from esteeming great suffering. If one could be free from suffering, one would also be free from the body. From this, we know that suffering arises from esteem, and the body arises from suffering. Hence, it is said: *Value great suffering as you do the body.*\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"?\nFavor is inferior.\n**Commentary:** Earlier, it was stated that \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar,\" but lest one fail to understand, a question is posed: *What is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"?* The answer follows: *Favor is inferior.* The reason favor is inferior is this: those who rely on favor become arrogant, and arrogance breeds misfortune. When misfortune arises from favor, favor becomes the root of disgrace. Thus, we know favor is inferior.\n\nTo gain it is alarming; to lose it is alarming—this is what is meant by \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar.\"\n**Commentary:** To gain it is favor; to lose it is disgrace. That both are alarming shows that favor and disgrace are cyclical, and favor is the root of disgrace. Worldly beings rejoice when they gain favor and tremble when they suffer disgrace. Thus, the sage warns them: fortune and misfortune are cyclical, like intertwined threads. Since favor and disgrace are unstable, how can one be alarmed by only one? When disgrace comes, one is alarmed by misfortune; when favor arrives, one is alarmed by arrogance. The alarm is the same in both cases. Hence, it is said: *this is what is meant by \"the alarm caused by favor and disgrace is similar.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by \"value great suffering as you do the body\"?\n**Commentary:** Lest one fail to understand, a question is posed to clarify.\nThe reason I have great suffering is that I have a body.\n**Commentary:** The reason I have great suffering is that I cling to the form of the body, delighting in honor and loathing disgrace, distinguishing right from wrong. When I do not obtain what I desire, I am filled with great sorrow and fear. My spirit is inwardly exhausted by greed, and my form is outwardly worn by striving. Weary and toiling—what is this if not suffering?\n\nBut if I were without a body, what suffering would I have?\n**Commentary:** \"Without a body\" means realizing that the form of the body is illusory and fundamentally unreal. One should then sit in forgetfulness, abandoning perception and dulling the senses, merging with the boundless Dao where there is no master, and equaling the \"entrusted harmony\" that is not the self. Naturally, the paths of honor and disgrace vanish, and the hearts of love and aversion cease. This is what is called \"the Great Release.\" What concern would one then have for great suffering?\n\nThus, it is said: *But if I were without a body, what suffering would I have?*\nThe commentary states: *Entrusted harmony*—in the *Zhuangzi*, Ch’eng responds to Shun: \"The body is not yours; it is the entrusted harmony of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nTherefore, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their body as the world may be confided with the world.\n**Commentary:** If a ruler esteems their body as lord of the world, valuing the self leads to domineering others, and thus others will not follow. Such a ruler may only be *entrusted* with the world temporarily. But if a ruler cherishes their body as lord of the world, loving the self leads to compassion for others, and thus the people will gladly elevate them. Such a ruler may be *confided* with the world, remaining its lord for long.\n\nNow, this chapter begins by speaking of the alarm caused by favor and disgrace and concludes with entrustment and confiding. It aims to show that being alarmed by favor and disgrace is not as good as forgetting favor and disgrace; esteeming and cherishing are not as good as forgetting esteem and cherish; being entrusted with the world is not as good as forgetting the world. Thus, it is said: *The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body.* If one is alarmed by favor and disgrace but has not yet forgotten the distinction between self and others, then a hundred concerns converge into one. If one clings to what one has, then ten thousand differences contend for supremacy. Therefore, forgetting favor and disgrace means there is nothing left to alarm; forgetting the body means there is no root of suffering; forgetting the world means there is no trace of entrustment. Only then can there be a ruler of the highest order above and ministers of the lowest knowledge below. There is non-action, yet nothing is left undone; there is no virtue, yet virtue is possessed.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: \"Look at It and It Cannot Be Seen\"**\nThe previous chapter clarified that valuing the body is suffering and urged forgetting both. This chapter clarifies that the wondrous root has no form, and thus in application, all is pervaded. The first three lines speak of the impossibility of seeking it in sound and color; the next six lines show that any inquiry must return to nothingness; the following five lines demonstrate the unfathomable functioning of the wondrous; and the final four lines conclude by citing the ancients to confirm the present.\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—it is called *yí*.\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called *xī*.\nGrasp at it and it cannot be held—it is called *wēi*.\n**Commentary:** This speaks of the Dao. Those who look at it seek the Dao in color; those who listen to it seek the Dao in sound; those who grasp at it seek the Dao in form. The Dao is not a matter of color, sound, or form, so seeking it is ultimately futile. Because it cannot be obtained, one might call it nothing. Yet within this nothingness of color, it responds to all colors; within this nothingness of sound, it harmonizes with all sounds; within this nothingness of form, it shapes all forms. It is the color of no-color, the sound of no-sound, the form of no-form. Thus, it is called *xī*, *wēi*, and *yí*. *Xī*, *wēi*, and *yí* describe the luminous Dao but are not the Dao itself.\n*Yí* means level and easy.\n*Xī* refers to the subtlety of sound.\n*Bó* means to grasp or hold.\nThese three cannot be inquired into, so they are blended into one.\n**Commentary:** The three are *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi*. *Zhì* means to obtain; *jié* means to inquire. *Hùn* means to merge. The wondrous root is subtle and unified, defying description in terms of color, sound, or form. How can one inquire into it? If one attempts to inquire using color, sound, or form, one only obtains *xī* and *wēi*. These three are provisional names meant to clarify the functioning of the Dao. Since the Dao is not color, sound, or form, they merge into one.\n\nAbove, it is not bright;\nbelow, it is not dark.\n**Commentary:** *Jiǎo* means bright; *mèi* means dark. Tangible things all have fixed directions: above is bright, and below is dark. But the wondrous root is indistinct and cannot be named. Thus, above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Yet it can be above or below, bright or dark. If it is not the most profound in the world, who could attain this?\n\nCeaseless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness.\n**Commentary:** *Shéngshéng* suggests ceaseless movement. The wondrous root moves without end, yet it cannot be named. Thus, it returns to nothingness.",

      "translated_text": "The wondrous root gives rise to transformation, its movement endless. The power of generating beings cannot be forced into names. It creates all things yet is not a thing; it engenders life yet is not life. When pursued, the wondrous root remains serene—never has there been any thing. Thus it is said to return to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless—this is called *hūhuǎng*.\n**Commentary:** *Zhuàng* means form; *xiàng* means image. The wondrous root is primordially undifferentiated, fundamentally without shape or substance. Yet the ten thousand transformations rely upon it for sustenance, and the manifold beings flow into form. This may be called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. It cannot be named as being, nor can it be fixed as non-being. Difficult to name as either, it is thus called *hūhuǎng*.\n\nWe meet it yet do not see its head; we follow it yet do not see its rear.\n**Commentary:** The most refined has no form; the greatest cannot be encompassed. Thus, those who meet it do not see its head, and those who follow it do not see its rear. Without a head, there is no beginning; without a rear, there is no end. Without beginning or end, it cannot be grasped by meeting or following.\n\nHold to the Dao of old to steer the being of today.\n**Commentary:** This shows how the ancient sage-kings always used non-action as the Dao to transform and guide the people. Thus, it admonishes those of today: if they can hold fast to the ancient practice of the teaching of non-action to govern the affairs of today’s being, then transformation will occur without words.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** The previous line spoke of holding to the Dao of old to guide action. This line speaks of knowing the ancient beginning, clarifying that the practice of the Dao must lead to transformation. Thus, it reiterates: if the sage-kings can know the ancient beginning and govern through non-action, they should embrace simplicity, cherishing purity and tranquility. This is to know the principle of non-action—this is the discipline of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Those Skilled in the Way of Old**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the wondrous root, being without image, functions universally in all applications. This chapter shows how those who penetrate the mysterious do not become full but can embrace decay.\n\nThe opening five lines on “those skilled in the Way of old” reveal the subtlety of their skill. The next seven lines, beginning with “cautious as if,” illustrate the difficulty of discerning their virtuous bearing. The two lines “Who can...” express the gradual arising of cultivation. The closing lines, beginning with “Preserving this Way,” conclude by affirming achievement without stagnation.\n\nThose skilled in the Way of old were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, too deep to be known.\n**Commentary:** *Gǔ* means “of old”; *shì* means “to serve.” It speaks of those in ancient times who were skilled in serving through the Dao: their essence was exquisitely refined, their spirit profoundly still and penetrating. Embodied in the Dao, their words dissolved without obstruction. Yet their capacity was so vast and deep that it could not be known.\n\nPrecisely because they could not be known, one was forced to describe their bearing:\n**Commentary:** Though those skilled in the Way could manifest their true bearing to awaken others, their boundless brilliance shone like the light of heaven, and their virtue was too profound to fathom. Thus, one was forced to describe their bearing, seeking traces of compliance to guide and transform the common and foolish.\n\nCautious, as if crossing a river in winter;\n**Commentary:** *Yù* means “leisurely caution.” *Ruò* means “like.” The river symbolizes the worldly realm of love and desire, which drowns sentient beings. Though those skilled in the Way dwelled in the world, they were not stained by love and desire, like one crossing a river in winter—thus they were full of leisurely caution. The reason for caution in winter crossings is that the ice is thick and strong, with no fear of sinking.\n\nHesitant, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\n**Commentary:** *Yóu* means “doubt” or “difficulty.” Those skilled in the Way, being free of love and desire, were full of leisurely caution. Yet when observing their actions, movements, and conduct, they feared misalignment with the Dao and thus remained hesitant. Like one today who, when handling affairs, fears the neighbors’ knowledge and becomes vigilant.\n\nSolemn, as if a guest;\n**Commentary:** Those skilled in the Way made no contrivances regarding love and desire, like a guest before a host—solemn and respectful. Yet in their virtuous conduct, they were not rigidly attached to things, flowing like ice melting in spring, without obstruction.\n\nSimple, as if uncarved wood;\n**Commentary:** *Dūn* means “thick” or “sincere”; *pǔ* means “uncarved.” Though not rigidly attached to things, they were free of frivolous competition. Their virtue was sincere and thick, like uncarved wood, without distinction.\n\nVast, as if a valley;\n**Commentary:** *Kuàng* means “spacious.” Those skilled in the Way embraced the Dao and held virtue; their capacity was vast and wide. Toward all things, they could contain and receive, like an empty valley that holds everything.\n\nTurbid, as if muddy.\n**Commentary:** Those skilled in the Way, though their minds were luminously clear, could embrace all things, blending with the dust of the world without distinguishing themselves. They were indistinct, like muddy water, so that none could know them.\n\nWho can still the turbid to gradually clarify it?\n**Commentary:** Following the previous line’s “as if muddy,” it takes the settling of water as an analogy for the mind of those skilled in the Way, which, being unstained, naturally becomes still. Who can, amid the turbid love and desires of the world, use the clarity of the Dao-nature to still them, preventing the arising of desires—just as muddy water, when stilled, gradually clarifies? *Shú* means “who.”\n\nWho can remain at rest to gradually bring forth life?\n**Commentary:** This teaches non-attachment to dharmas. Who can use the clarity of the Dao-nature to still love and desire, like the nature of water? Having achieved gradual clarity, if one then remains fixed in this clarity, stagnating, that is not awakening—it is not yet liberation. One must seek further excellence, advancing in cultivation. As the Dao is diminished again and again, and practice proceeds step by step, the clarity of the Dao-nature does not stagnate in dharmas but gradually stirs and emerges. *Shēng* means “to emerge.”\n\nThose who preserve this Way do not desire fullness.\n**Commentary:** Stagnating in dharmas and resting in clarity is called fullness. Thus, if one wishes to preserve this Way of gradual clarity and gradual emergence, one must remain unstained, attaining without attachment. To stagnate in clarity and seek emergence is to harm fullness and obstruct the practice of the Way—thus, “do not desire.”",
      "overlap_context": "things all have fixed directions: above is bright, and below is dark. But the wondrous root is indistinct and cannot be named. Thus, above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Yet it can be above or below, bright or dark. If it is not the most profound in the world, who could attain this?\n\nCeaseless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness.\n**Commentary:** *Shéngshéng* suggests ceaseless movement. The wondrous root moves without end, yet it cannot be named. Thus, it returns to nothingness.",

      "translated_text": "Only by not desiring fullness can one remain worn yet not newly completed.\n**Commentary:** To be without stagnation, attaining non-action, and abiding nowhere in dharmas—this is not to be full. One constantly regards newly realized dharmas as worn and thin, ever seeking superior dharmas, never clinging to them as newly completed. To do so would be to stagnate.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost in Emptiness**\nThe preceding chapter showed how those who penetrate the mysterious preserve the Dao without desiring fullness; this chapter reveals how those who guard stillness must return to the root and restore the mandate. Restoring the mandate is the essence of knowing the constant; guarding stillness is the path to attaining emptiness. The text unfolds in sequence, demonstrating that both principles converge in the function of the Dao. Thus, to know the constant is to be enlightened; to practice the Dao is to endure.\n\nAttain the utmost in emptiness; guard stillness with sincerity.\n**Commentary:** The \"utmost in emptiness\" is the wondrous origin. All beings receive life by endowing this emptiness, the utmost in the wondrous origin—this is called true nature. Yet after receiving form, the six senses become entangled in love and desire, the five desires run rampant, true nature scatters, and the wondrous origin is lost. To ensure that the wondrous origin of utmost emptiness is necessarily attained within oneself, one must guard this feminine stillness, thicken the sincerity of one’s nature, sever desires, embrace non-action, and remain unwearied by narrowness. Then the wondrous origin of utmost emptiness will naturally be attained—just as water flows toward the moist and fire tends toward the dry. \"Attain\" means to ensure its inevitable arrival, akin to the meaning of *zhi* in \"summoning the army\" in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nThe myriad things arise together; I thereby observe their return.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the meaning of guarding stillness with sincerity to attain the utmost in emptiness. Though the myriad things and forms move and act differently, when one observes their return, they always revert to their root. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu* (Return).\" *Fu* means to revert to the root. Thus, stillness leads to return, while movement causes one to lose the root.\n\nThe teeming things, each returns to its root.\n**Commentary:** This illustrates the meaning of observing return through analogy. The root is the qi one receives at birth. Now, observing the myriad things—flowers and leaves flourishing—when their nature is spent, they all return to their root to regenerate. The wondrous origin of utmost emptiness is what humans receive at birth. Observing the bustle of emotions and desires, if one can guard stillness and attain emptiness, true nature will return to the primordial mandate and endure.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the mandate.\n**Commentary:** When things return to the root, they become tranquil; when humans guard stillness, they attain emptiness. Trees receive life from the root; returning to the root restores the mandate. Humans receive life from the wondrous origin; if one can guard stillness and attain emptiness, this is called returning to restore the nature and mandate one was endowed with.\n\nRestoring the mandate is called the constant; knowing the constant is called illumination.\nNot knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune.\n**Commentary:** By guarding feminine stillness with sincerity to attain the utmost emptiness of the wondrous origin, attaining emptiness restores the mandate—this is called obtaining the constant. To know and guard the constant is called illumination. Losing the constant and acting recklessly is called impermanence. Without constancy in virtue, one will surely meet with extreme misfortune. The note reads: \"Not constant in virtue, or bearing shame,\" citing the *Heng* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*.\n\nKnowing the constant brings capacity;\n**Commentary:** Knowing the constant is illumination; illumination enables one to reflect all things. As things arise, one responds without fail, containing all—thus, \"knowing the constant brings capacity.\"\n\nCapacity brings impartiality; impartiality brings kingship;\n**Commentary:** To contain and respond to all things is impartiality, free from selfishness. Without selfishness, the world turns toward one—this is called kingship.\n\nKingship brings heaven; heaven brings the Dao;\n**Commentary:** Only heaven is great, and the king models himself upon it. His virtue mirrors heaven, covering all—thus, \"kingship brings heaven.\" With the king’s virtue like heaven, non-action governs, and the transformative power of the Dao flows—thus, \"heaven brings the Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao brings enduring; to the end of one’s days, no peril.\n**Commentary:** To govern with stillness and attain emptiness, returning to the root and restoring the mandate—with such virtue, one may become a king. The king’s virtue aligns with heaven, and by enacting the Dao, the Dao endures, bestowing lasting fortune. The people turn to him as to the sun, revere him as heaven, cherish him as rain, and long for him as spring. Thus, to the end of his days, what peril could there be? Hence, \"to the end of one’s days, no peril.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme One, Those Below Know of His Existence**\nThis chapter first discusses the customs of pristine antiquity, then descends to the decadence of later ages, seeking to clarify the gradual loss of the Dao and trace the origins of corruption. The preceding chapter showed that guarding stillness attains emptiness; this chapter demonstrates that non-action restores simplicity. When simplicity scatters, favor and praise arise; with non-action, one speaks of the self as natural. May the rulers who transform through the Dao devote themselves to this wordless teaching.\n\nThe supreme one—those below know of his existence.\n**Commentary:** The \"supreme one\" refers to the rulers of pristine antiquity. To call them \"supreme\" is to honor them. Such rulers engaged in non-action and practiced wordless teaching. Their ministers merely knew there was a ruler above, revering him as heaven—vast and above, bestowing the beauty of the four seasons’ growth. Yet they knew not how to praise his virtue—hence, \"those below know of his existence.\"\n\nThe next, they draw near and praise.\n**Commentary:** After the passing of the supreme rulers, the Yellow Emperor and the sages Yao and Shun arose, enacting teachings and practicing goodness, extending benevolence to the people—thus, they drew near. Their gentleness and weakness brought balance, their achievements towered over the world—thus, they were praised. Yet the traces of their favor and praise in life became the afflictions of later generations. Thus, *Zhuangzi* said: \"I tell you! The root of great disorder must lie between Yao and Shun.\" Why? Because their traces endured for a thousand generations thereafter.",

      "translated_text": "Next, they fear and scorn him.\n**Commentary:** After the passing of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, the age descended to the Three Kings and Five Hegemons, gradually declining into harshness. With severe punishments and oppressive systems, the people feared them. Yet rulers could not discern clearly, so the people scorned them. Below, subjects debated crimes to seek merit; above, rulers rewarded treachery and bred deceit. Such mutual deception chills the heart.\n\n\"Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains the fear of rulers. The people fear the sovereign’s laws and scorn his teachings because the ruler’s trust in them is insufficient—thus, the people become untrustworthy.\n\n\"Yet they value his words.\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains drawing near and praising. The people draw near to the ruler’s virtuous conduct and praise his achievements because the ruler’s teachings possess power—thus, they value his words and extol them. (Note: In ancient texts, *gu* 古 is interchangeable with *you* 由.)\n\n\"When deeds are accomplished and affairs succeed, the people all say, ‘We are naturally thus.’\"\n**Commentary:** This further explains the \"supreme rulers\" and \"those below know of his existence.\" When simplicity remains unharmed, who would craft ritual vessels? When the Dao and virtue are universally practiced, where would praise and nearness be established? Thus, in the age of the supreme rulers, the people forgot the emperor’s power. Only when deeds were accomplished and affairs succeeded did they all say it was naturally so, unaware of why they should draw near, praise, or repay him.\n\n**Chapter 18: The Decay of the Great Dao**\nThe previous chapter clarified the progression of eras, showing how the Dao endured when simplicity remained intact. This chapter reveals how customs decay when the Dao is lost, and benevolence and righteousness arise. Shaving one’s head and seeking a physician—though it may bring recovery, counting grains while cooking and combing one’s hair—how it harms one’s nature! Thus, these eight lines are presented to expose the extreme of decay, hoping to return to ancient simplicity.\n\n\"When the Great Dao decays, there is benevolence and righteousness.\"\n**Commentary:** The decay of the Great Dao refers to an age of shallow customs, where people vie in vanity. The wind of serene harmony vanishes, and the transformative influence of pure clarity is lost. The affairs of the perfect Dao and non-action are abandoned—hence, it is called decay. With decay, there arises benevolence of universal love and righteousness that curbs wrongdoing, leaving one to tread cautiously between them. Thus, *Zhuangzi* said: \"The Dao is hidden in petty achievements.\" Petty achievements refer to benevolence and righteousness, each self-contained and unable to achieve great unity—hence, they are called petty.\n\n\"When wisdom and cleverness emerge, there is great deceit.\"\n**Commentary:** The emergence of wisdom and cleverness refers to later generations using intellect to establish laws to regulate customs and create statutes to expose treachery. Fearing disbelief, they made seals to authenticate. Fearing inequity, they crafted measures and scales. Yet the unscrupulous stole the seals and pilfered the measures, so the laws created by wisdom only amplified their deceit—hence, there is great deceit.\n\n\"When the six relations are not in harmony, there is filial piety and compassion.\"\n**Commentary:** The six relations are father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. In an age of great unity, there is no private kinship. But when superiors and inferiors are discordant, resentment and favor arise, leading to acts like fanning pillows and warming mats—called filial. Going out and returning with concern—called compassion. Bearing the names of compassion and filial piety, they display self-satisfaction, unaware that in the age of the Great Dao, the world was one family. Superiors inherited and inferiors were pacified by natural duty. Seeing others as oneself, one did not exclusively love one’s own kin—thus, all in the world could be filial. Others saw one as themselves, not exclusively cherishing their own children—thus, all in the world could be compassionate. Then where would the names of filial piety and compassion be applied?\n\n\"When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\"\n**Commentary:** Loyalty is the duty of a minister—why then speak of \"loyal ministers\"? Because the ruler loses the way of governing ministers, allowing flatterers to advance. They draw near to benighted rulers, breeding disaster and chaos. Then some face danger and give their lives, enduring hardship to rectify the state—earning the name of loyal ministers. But when the transformative influence of the Dao prevails, in non-action and purity, the sage-king’s many officers are all like Kui and Long. The constant norms are in order, none failing in their duties. Then the names of loyalty and filial piety cease, and the Dao of simplicity flourishes—what need is there for loyal ministers or filial sons? These four are the extreme of decay—how could one not return to simplicity?\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Volume Two Concluded*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Volume Three*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Nineteen: Cutting Off Sagacity**\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed the decay of customs and the loss of the Dao, where benevolence and righteousness then flourished. This chapter clarifies that by cutting off the many paths and returning to simplicity, thieves and bandits will cease to exist. The first six lines set aside the traces of self-importance and compliance; the next three lines will elucidate the method of establishing teaching; the final four lines demonstrate the course of practice.\n\n**Cut off sagacity, abandon knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.**\n*Commentary:* Sagacity refers to the sagacity of contrived creation. Knowledge refers to the mundane knowledge of self-importance and compliance. The sagacity of creation leaves traces, while the knowledge of self-importance is not true. Losing truth gives rise to artifice and deceit; pursuing traces causes one to lose the root. Thus, both are cut off and abandoned to restore simplicity. When the harmony of Heaven flows unimpeded and self-importance ceases, the people gain a hundredfold benefit.\n\n**Cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.**\n*Commentary:* The preceding chapter stated that when the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness. Here, it says that by cutting off benevolence and abandoning righteousness, the people return to filial piety and kindness. This clarifies that in the age of the great Dao—what is called \"mysterious sameness\"—the people have no private attachments and are all naturally kind and filial. Thus, when principle is perfected, traces vanish; when affairs are proper, names depart. Now, with the Six Relations in decay, the names of filial piety and kindness become prominent. If one cuts off the benevolence of universal love and abandons the righteousness of judging right and wrong, then rivers and lakes will have no forced assistance, and kindness and filial piety will possess their natural essence. Thus, the people return to great filial piety and kindness.\n\n**Cut off skill, abandon profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist.**\n*Commentary:* Cutting off skill means eliminating excessive and unlawful craftsmanship. Abandoning profit means forsaking the pursuit of wealth, monopolies, and illicit gains. Thieves and bandits arise from insatiable desire. If skill is cut off, people will not contend; if profit is abandoned, people will be content. Who, then, would become a thief or bandit? Thus, it is said they will cease to exist.\n\nThese three are insufficient as text, so they are made to belong to something else.\n*Commentary:* The three are: first, cutting off sagacity and abandoning knowledge; second, cutting off benevolence and abandoning righteousness; third, cutting off skill and abandoning profit. These three are merely to be cut off and abandoned, without yet involving cultivation. Thus, as text, they are insufficient to convey teaching. They are made to belong to what follows—namely, \"seeing the plain\" and so on.\n\n**See the plain, embrace the uncarved, lessen selfishness, reduce desire.**\n*Commentary:* To seek to cut off sagacity and abandon knowledge, one must constantly see the true and plain. To seek to cut off benevolence and abandon righteousness, one must embrace simplicity and plainness. To seek to cut off skill and abandon profit, one must lessen selfishness and reduce desire. Though the three cuttings may be insufficient in text, in practice they are more than enough for self-cultivation. To prohibit and cut off from the center, one must draw upon inner conduct.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Cutting Off Learning Brings No Sorrow**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that by cutting off the many paths and returning to simplicity, thieves and bandits will cease to exist. This chapter reveals that one must fear and remove worldly learning as if in darkness, thus standing alone and apart from others. The first line marks the path to be cut off; the next seven lines present analogies to clarify the principle; the following seventeen lines distinguish the ordinary and the sagely in debate; the final two lines discuss solitary practice to conclude.\n\n**Cut off learning, and there will be no sorrow.**\n*Commentary:* Cutting off learning means cutting off worldly, contrived learning. All people, at birth, possess true simplicity. To exceed one’s lot in seeking learning harms one’s nature and brings much trouble. If one were to cut off all learning entirely, things would have no cultivation. Here, it is clarified that one cuts off only excessive, contrived learning—what *Zhuangzi* calls \"worldly learning that seeks to return to the beginning.\" As for learning within one’s lot, following one’s nature in practice, the superior person diligently cultivates it, and it is not to be cut off. Thus, it is said, \"Cut off learning, and there will be no sorrow.\"\n\n**How far apart are \"yes\" and \"ah\"? How distant are good and evil?**\n*Commentary:* \"Yes\" is a respectful response. The *Rites of Zhou* states: \"When the teacher summons, do not say 'yes' but rise.\" \"Ah\" is a careless response. The *Book of Han* asks: \"Who is He?\"—meaning \"who is it?\" This presents an analogy. \"Yes\" and \"ah\" both come from the mouth: \"yes\" is respectful and thus good, while \"ah\" is careless and thus evil. Whether learning is cut off or not depends on the heart. Cutting it off brings no sorrow; not cutting it off gives rise to trouble. Since they come from the same mouth, it is said, \"How far apart?\" Since it depends on the heart, it is said, \"How distant?\" If one can understand that learning is no-learning, and that the appearances of learning are empty, forgetting knowledge in knowing, and not generating distinctions, then \"yes\" and \"ah\" become equal, and good and evil are both forgotten.\n\n**What people fear, one cannot but fear.**\n*Commentary:* What people fear are carelessness and evil. Carelessness leads to faults, and evil invites disdain. Being disdained, one is abandoned and slighted by others; having faults, things multiply blame and resentment. This is like worldly, contrived learning, which increases right and wrong. If one does not fear and cut it off, it all violates one’s lot and harms one’s nature. Thus, one cannot but fear and cut it off.\n\n**Vast and boundless, it has no end!**\n*Commentary:* Vast means decay. Carelessness and evil are faults; worldly learning loses truth—all are to be feared and thus cut off and abandoned. If one does not cut off and abandon them, then one’s true nature decays without end. The *Book of Songs* says: \"The night is not yet ended,\" meaning the night-watches are still many. Here, it says \"it has no end,\" meaning that worldly learning harms one’s nature without cease. Thus, the road ahead is long, and it is said to have no end.\n\n**The multitude delight and rejoice, as if feasting on the great sacrifice, as if ascending the spring terrace.**\n*Commentary:* \"Delight and rejoice\" describes the stirring of emotions and desires. This clarifies those who do not fear and cut off worldly learning. Worldly, contrived learning stirs emotions and desires. Delighting and rejoicing in pursuit of external things, they toil their whole lives—like a starving man at a great feast, indulging in rich flavors; like one gazing from the spring terrace, stirred to attachment. The great sacrifice consists of oxen, sheep, and pigs. The spring terrace is where attachment arises: its flourishing plants and trees, paired birds and singing creatures, the warm harmony of spring—all easily lead to indulgence. Thus, the *Bin Ode* says: \"The spring days are long; the white southernwood is gathered in abundance. My heart is sorrowful—would that I could go with the lord’s son!\"",

      "translated_text": "I alone remain fearful where no sign appears, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. The commentary states: Here, \"I\" refers to Lord Lao himself, who, in fearing and cutting off worldly learning, embraces the Dao and contains harmony. Alone, he remains serene and still, untouched by the contrived affairs of the world—emotions, desires, and the like—showing no trace or sign. Like an infant who cannot yet laugh, he is without discrimination. \"Smile\" here means to recognize others. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Not yet able to smile, who would begin with him?\"\n\nAdrift, adrift, as if with no place to return. The commentary states: \"Adrift, adrift\" describes movement. The multitude, stirred by movement, clings and grasps, ever seeking something to pursue, as if they have somewhere to go. But I, free of intent, remain serene and still—following the current as it flows, stopping where it pools. Like one who walks the Way, I have no fixed destination, no restless striving.\n\nAll others have more than enough, while I alone seem to lack. The commentary states: The multitude, entangled in worldly learning, boasts of their cunning and wisdom, clinging to all things as if they possess abundance. I alone diminish these, never stagnating, my heart free of attachment—thus I seem to have forgotten.\n\nIs my heart that of a fool? So pure, so pure! The commentary states: I, perceiving all things without attachment, seem to have forgotten—how could this be the heart of a fool? Yet my heart remains pure, unadorned, free of desire—hence it seems forgotten.\n\nThe common folk are bright and clear; I alone seem dim. The common folk are sharp and exacting; I alone am dull and vague. The commentary states: \"Bright and clear\" describes their self-importance and display of cunning. \"Dim\" means dull and without discrimination. \"Sharp and exacting\" refers to their establishment of teachings and laws to restrain others. \"Dull and vague\" describes a mind that is broad and unburdened. Their brightness and exactitude, their imposition of teachings, all stem from their failure to cut off worldly learning and contrivance. Thus the sage fears and cuts them off, remaining dim and silent.\n\nSwift as darkness, still as solitude—seeming without end. The commentary states: One who has cut off learning is swift and without intent, ever in a state of dimness, yet the heart remains still, never clinging. In all things, there is no attachment—hence it seems without end.\n\nAll others have their means; I alone am stubborn and coarse. The commentary states: The common folk, unafraid of worldly learning, remain entangled in their pursuits, never at rest. I alone, in this world, am without discrimination—like one crude and unrefined. \"Stubborn\" means without discrimination; \"coarse\" means base and insufficient. Yet my heart is truly awakened—hence I say \"seeming\" thus.\n\nFrom \"All others rejoice\" onward, all contrasts are made clear.\n\nI alone differ from others, yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother. The commentary states: These two lines conclude the passage. \"I alone differ from others\" means I differ from the common folk who do not cut off worldly learning—all the contrasts above show how I differ from them. The common folk cling to contrivance; I alone forget emotions and desires. The common folk discriminate among things; I alone see no right or wrong. Hence I differ from others. \"Yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother\" means Lord Lao admonishes people to preserve simplicity, maintain harmony, reduce selfishness, and limit desires—cutting off indulgence in sights and sounds, halting the pursuit of fame and reputation. Like an infant, one should seek only nourishment from the Mother. Thus it is said: \"Yet I value seeking nourishment from the Mother.\"\n\n**Chapter 21: The Appearance of Great Virtue**\nThe previous chapter showed how fearing and cutting off worldly learning leaves one dim, thus differing from others. This chapter reveals that following the true and perfect Dao enables one to encompass all beginnings. The opening two lines on \"great virtue\" illustrate the virtuous person’s compliance with the Dao. The following ten lines, from \"The Dao as a thing,\" unfold the essence of the One’s mystery. The five lines from \"From ancient times\" distinguish the names of its functions and conclude with the virtue of generation and completion.\n\nThe appearance of great virtue: only the Dao is followed. The commentary states: \"Great\" means utmost; \"follow\" means compliance; \"appearance\" means form and state. To clarify how the practitioner complies with the perfect Dao, it asks: What is the form and state of one of utmost virtue? It answers: The form and state of one of utmost virtue is to follow only the Dao of emptiness and extremity.\n\nThe Dao as a thing is only vague, only indistinct. The commentary states: This describes the form of the empty and extreme mystery as a thing—the Dao that great virtue follows. The empty and extreme mystery, forcibly named the Dao, as a thing—what is its movement and form? This mystery is neither being nor non-being, difficult to name. If called being, it is still and without image; if called non-being, it seems to abide like depth. Without being or non-being, it is hard to name—hence it is called vague and indistinct.\n\nIndistinct, oh! Vague, oh! Within it there are images. The commentary states: This clarifies the traces of its descending generation. \"Indistinct\" means non-being; \"vague\" means being. \"Images\" are signs of manifestation. The mystery is without thing—hence it is called indistinct. Generation and transformation take form—hence it is called vague. Thus, from non-being it descends into being; within it, signs of all things appear—from the root it descends into traces.\n\nVague, oh! Indistinct, oh! Within it there are things. The commentary states: \"Things\" here refer to the Dao as a thing, meaning the mystery itself. The mystery descends into generation, manifesting all images. Cultivating nature and returning to virtue, one reverts to non-thing. Non-thing is the Dao. It says that in cultivating nature and returning to virtue, one does not depart from the mystery—from being one returns to non-being, merging again with the perfect Dao. Hence it says \"within it there are things,\" meaning there is the wondrous thing. This gathers the traces to return to the root.\n\nDark, oh! Obscure, oh! Within it there is essence. The commentary states: \"Dark and obscure\" mean deep and hidden. From the empty extreme it descends into generation; from cultivating nature it returns to the root. Gathering the traces to return to the root, the wondrous thing may abide—dark and obscure, unfathomable, containing transformation. Within it lies the utmost essence—hence it says \"within it there is essence.\"\n\nIts essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity. The commentary states: The wondrous thing of the perfect Dao, being fundamentally free of falsity, transforms with utmost essence—hence its essence is utterly real.",

The power of generation and completion of the Dao and virtue, the sincerity of the dark and obscure true essence, remains boundless from beginning to end, unchanging from ancient times to the present. Thus, the names of things that attain the Dao’s function—such as the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth—persist from antiquity to the present without departing. Hence the annotation says: Since the function of generation and completion is the same in past and present, the names of its responses remain unchanged through the ages. With this essence of utmost sincerity, it surveys the fundamental beginnings of the myriad things, allowing each to fulfill its function of generation and completion.\n\nHow do I know the origins of the multitude are thus? By this.\n\nThe commentary states: It further explains: How do I know that the fundamental beginnings of the myriad things all receive from the Dao, and that the Dao must survey them to enable their functions of generation and completion? The answer is: By this utmost essence and sincerity, for all things in the present receive their generation and completion—hence we know this to be so.\n\n**Chapter 22: \"That Which Is Crooked Shall Be Made Whole\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that following the perfect Dao to its utmost sincerity enables one to survey the origins of the multitude. This chapter explains that embracing the One as a model and refraining from contention exemplifies the six phrases of \"crooked yet whole,\" demonstrating the conduct of wholeness. The following two phrases mark the sagely practice, while the subsequent four phrases further elucidate the meaning of \"crooked yet whole\" down to \"worn yet renewed.\" The concluding phrase affirms that only by non-contention can one attain wholeness and return to the root.\n\nThat which is crooked shall be made whole.\nThe commentary states: *Crooked* means to yield and follow. If one can yield and follow without resisting things, one may preserve one’s wholeness—hence it says \"that which is crooked shall be made whole.\"\n\nThat which is bent shall be made straight.\nThe commentary states: *Bent* means to endure humiliation from things. *Straight* means to correct what is crooked. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"To correct the crooked is to make it straight.\" Though one does not resist things, if things come to bend one, and one can endure the humiliation, the other will surely feel shame and amend themselves. Thus, one’s straightness can correct the crooked—hence it says \"that which is bent shall be made straight.\"\n\nThat which is hollow shall be filled.\nThe commentary states: *Hollow* means low and sunken. *Filled* means full. This is a metaphorical explanation. Just as the earth aids what is low, causing water to flow and fill it, so too does one who maintains humility find their virtue growing ever greater. To be crooked and bent is to be low and sunken; to be whole and straight is to be full and abundant—hence it says \"that which is hollow shall be filled.\"\n\nThat which is worn shall be renewed.\nThe commentary states: *Worn* refers to what is humble and unrefined. Crookedness, bending, and hollowness all mean to humble oneself. By humbling oneself, others will defer to one, and thus one’s virtue and conduct will daily renew—hence it says \"that which is worn shall be renewed.\"\n\nThat which is little shall attain; that which is much shall be confounded.\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.\n\nThe commentary states: One who takes little for oneself will not lose, hence it says \"attain.\" One who gives much will provoke contention, hence it says \"confounded.\" This applies to cultivating the body and equally to cultivating the Dao: one must hold fast to simplicity and preserve one’s true nature. If one seeks widely among divergent paths, one invites disorder and confusion. Thus, the loss of the sheep is due to branching paths, and the ruin of life lies in pursuing many directions. Therefore, the sage embraces the One without deviation and may serve as the model for all under heaven. *Model* means standard.\n\nNot displaying oneself, thus one is luminous.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is crooked shall be made whole.\" If one does not display one’s own excellence but instead yields to things, one’s wholeness in virtue becomes ever more luminous—hence it says \"thus one is luminous.\"\n\nNot asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is bent shall be made straight.\" If one can endure humiliation from things without asserting one’s own rightness, one will surely avoid blame. Thus, one’s straightness becomes naturally distinguished—hence it says \"thus one is distinguished.\"\n\nNot boasting, thus one has merit.\nThe commentary states: This further explains \"that which is hollow shall be filled.\" If one does not boast or claim credit but instead practices humility, others will not contend with one, and merit will return to oneself. Like the low earth, water will surely fill it—hence it says \"thus one has merit.\"\n\nNot being arrogant, thus one endures.",

Hence it says \"none can contend with one.\"\n\n\"Of old, what was called 'bending to preserve wholeness'—was this an empty saying? Truly, wholeness is thus attained and returned to.\"\nThe commentary states: This cites antiquity to conclude the meaning of bending to preserve wholeness. Since ancient times, this saying of bending to preserve wholeness has existed—could it be mere empty words without substance? If one can bend and yield without resistance, one truly possesses the principle of wholeness, which returns to oneself—hence it says \"truly, wholeness is thus attained and returned to.\" *Cheng* means \"truly.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Few Words, Naturalness**\nThe previous chapter clarified embracing the One as the model of non-contention, hence the saying \"bending to preserve wholeness.\" This chapter clarifies aligning with the Dao by forgetting words and relinquishing attachments, thus naturally becoming one with what is lost. The first line establishes the principle to illuminate the truth, the next five lines present analogies to expound the teaching. Thereafter, it broadly develops the principle and analogies to form the conclusion.\n\n**Few words, naturalness.**\nThe commentary states: This clarifies that teachings must not be rigidly grasped. \"Few words\" means forgetting words. Words exist for the sake of awakening to the Dao; when one awakens to the Dao, words are forgotten. Yet one cannot entirely forget them, for they serve to expound the principle. But the principle of naturalness should not be fixed as existing or not existing. The meaning of \"few words\" is likewise not fixed in speech. Thus, the phrase \"few words\" is used to reveal the principle of naturalness—hence it says \"few words, naturalness.\" If one can, through those words and teachings, awaken to and realize the subtle, not clinging to the trap or the fish, one accords with naturalness. Hence it says \"few words, naturalness.\"\n\n**Whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day.**\nThe commentary states: Whirlwinds are violently swift winds. Sudden rains are violently heavy rains. Wind exists to scatter things, rain to moisten them. If they are violently swift or heavy, they harm things and do not last. This is likened to teachings, which exist to expound the principle. If one clings to words and fixates on teachings, one cannot awaken to or understand them, and will surely lose the Dao and fall into delusion. Thus, winds and rains must not be violent and sudden, and teachings must not be rigidly grasped. To clarify that forgetting words accords with naturalness, it presents the analogy of whirlwinds and sudden rains.\n\n**Who causes these? Heaven and Earth.**",

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth cannot even endure long—how much less can man?\n\nThe commentary states: *Shu* means \"who.\" The text poses the question: Who causes these whirlwinds and sudden rains? The answer: Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, even their violent outbursts cannot last. How much less can ordinary men, clinging rigidly to teachings and acting with sudden violence, fail to empty themselves and forget, gradually reaching the extreme—how could they ever attain awakening and understanding? Thus, those who follow the Dao—\n\nThe commentary states: *Cong* means \"to accord.\" The supremely empty Dao, its function inexhaustible and without fixed form, flows through things without ever congealing or stagnating. Therefore, if one wishes to embody this wondrous Dao and accord with it, one must not cling or stagnate. Hence it says: *those who follow the Dao.*\n\nThose of the Dao are one with the Dao.\nThe commentary states: Those who accord with the Dao are called *those of the Dao*—those who follow the Dao without stagnation, awakening to and understanding teachings without rigid attachment, may become one with the Dao. Thus it says: *one with the Dao.*\n\nThose of virtue are one with virtue.\nThe commentary states: *Virtue* is the name for the Dao’s function. When its power extends to things, things receive it, hence it is called *virtue.* Those who embody and awaken to it, following the Dao, not only awaken themselves but also benefit the world. When the world receives their virtue, and they forget their own merit, all their actions accord with the Dao’s function. Thus it says: *those of virtue are one with virtue.*\n\nThose of loss are one with loss.\nThe commentary states: *Loss* refers to clinging to teachings and losing the Dao. Teachings are but the snare and trap of principle. With snare and trap, one may catch fish and hare; but if one clings to the snare and trap, one loses the fish and hare. Clinging to teachings, one loses the wondrous principle. Losing the principle, one has no way to attain the Dao—this is to be one with loss. Thus it says: *those of loss are one with loss.*\n\nThose one with the Dao, the Dao also receives.\nThose one with virtue, virtue also receives.\nThose one with loss, loss also receives.\nThe commentary states: This speaks of resonance through shared qi. Thus, when a tiger roars, wind arises; when a crane cries, its young respond. Though natures differ like liver and gallbladder, or Chu and Yue, when the Dao aligns, even Yi and Xia become as one. Like attracts like—nothing resists this. Thus, those one with the Dao receive the Dao; those one with loss receive loss. Like the moon’s reflection drawn from water with a mirror, or fire kindled by the sun with a burning-mirror. Thus it says: *those one with the Dao, the Dao also receives.*\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nThe commentary states: The reason people cannot embody and awaken to principle, forgetting words, is that their trust and understanding are insufficient, giving rise to doubt and stagnation. With doubt and stagnation, they cling to words in search of awakening. Clinging to words in search of awakening only deepens delusion—this is the response of distrust. Thus it says: *there is distrust.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe previous chapter showed that those who cling to words and stagnate in teachings are one with loss. This chapter reveals that self-display, self-righteousness, boasting, and pride invite the world’s disdain. The first two lines present an analogy to show the difficulty of attainment; the next four lines clarify that even seeking it yields no success. The passage beginning *In relation to the Dao* issues warnings and exhortations, urging those of the Dao not to dwell in such states.\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk.\nThe commentary states: *Qi* means \"to stand on tiptoe and gaze.\" *Kua* means \"to stride with legs apart.\" This presents an analogy. To crane the neck and stand on tiptoe in hopes of seeing farther is precarious—one cannot stand firm. To stride with legs apart is to be obstructed by things—one cannot walk. This is like those who are self-displaying and self-righteous.\n\nThus, one who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who strides cannot walk. One who displays himself cannot be enlightened; one who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious—this much is clear.\n\nOne who displays himself cannot be enlightened.\nThe commentary states: Those who display themselves lose the mirror of introspection. Flaunting their talents and exalting themselves, they seek to be seen, yet every move invites blame. No one supports them, and their own undertakings end in obscurity. Thus it says: *one who displays himself cannot be enlightened.*\n\nOne who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious.\nThe commentary states: Those who cannot yield or accept others yet insist on their own rightness, seeking to stand out and be recognized, make themselves a target of resentment. Others cannot bear them, and slander grows daily. Thus it is hard to become illustrious. Hence it says: *one who is self-righteous cannot be illustrious.*\n\nOne who boasts achieves no merit.\nThe commentary states: Humility is the handle of virtue; yielding is the ornament of propriety. Without these, nothing can be accomplished. How much less can one who is self-assertive and boastful, seeking merit through non-yielding, achieve anything but strife and excess? Thus it says: *one who boasts achieves no merit.*\n\nOne who prides himself does not endure.\nThe commentary states: The ancient worthies agreed: \"Great virtue appears foolish.\" Those who pride themselves on their reputation and conduct invite scorn. Ridicule follows, and though they seek advancement, others resent them and refuse to acknowledge their growth. Thus it says: *one who prides himself does not endure.*\n\nIn relation to the Dao, these are called leftover food and parasitic conduct.\nThe commentary states: *Leftover food* refers to the remnants of a meal. *Parasitic conduct* refers to superfluous, growth-like behavior. Leftovers are filthy; growths are a bodily affliction. Such conduct as self-display and self-righteousness, when measured against the Dao, is like leftover food and parasitic growths—universally despised. It is called *parasitic conduct* because self-display and self-righteousness are excrescences on virtuous conduct. Thus it says: *parasitic conduct.* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"People will not eat my leftovers.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Growths and excrescences protrude from the body yet exceed its nature.\"\n\nThe world may despise them—thus those of the Dao do not dwell in them.\nThe commentary states: Since self-display and self-righteousness are like leftover food and parasitic conduct, even ordinary things may despise them. Therefore, the noble person of the Dao does not engage in such behavior.",

This chapter extols the Dao’s greatness through the threefold movement of \"vastness,\" revealing its primordial completion before Heaven and ultimately teaching conformity to the Dao’s spontaneity. It begins by declaring, \"Something formless yet complete,\" in six phrases to illuminate the marvelous source’s ineffable essence, from which all things derive their efficacy. Next, in \"I know not its name\" and the following six phrases, it traces the origin of forced naming, showing even names to be unattainable. Then, in \"Thus the Dao\" and the subsequent six phrases, it demonstrates the nurturing of the Four Great and admonishes rulers to emulate them. From there to the end, it instructs in modeling the Dao’s spontaneity, embracing non-action and purity.\n\nSomething formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\nCommentary: \"Something\" refers to the wondrous entity—the supremely subtle, marvelous source. To explain why forced naming is impossible, it first speaks of the Dao as \"something.\" This wondrous entity, though formless, is complete, containing all images. Tracing its creative transformations, it existed before Heaven and Earth, hence \"born before Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nStill and silent, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates endlessly without exhaustion.\nCommentary: \"Still and silent\" describes the formless entity’s nature—profoundly tranquil and empty, the marvelous source abiding in quiescence. Thus it stands alone and does not alter; responding to things without intent, its function pervades all existence, hence \"circulates endlessly without exhaustion.\"\n\nIt may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\nCommentary: The marvelous source’s creative transformations pervade all existence; all things owe their formation to it. Its nurturing virtue is so abundant that it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven. \"Mother\" signifies nurturing and nourishment.\n\nI know not its name; I style it \"Dao,\" and if forced to name it, call it \"Great.\"\nCommentary: A \"style\" expresses its virtue; a \"name\" defines its essence. The Venerable Lord says the marvelous source’s creative transformations are inexhaustibly subtle in function, its stillness and silence defying fixed form. Born before Heaven and Earth, it eludes designation by lineage. Thus, \"I know not its name.\" Yet seeing its vast pervasion of things, to express its inherent virtue, I style it \"Dao.\" Seeing its all-embracing boundlessness, to define its supremely formless essence, I force the name \"Great.\" Ordinary things are first named, then styled, for they grow from small to large. The Dao is first styled, then named, descending from essence to manifestation.\n\nGreat means passing; passing means far-reaching; far-reaching means returning.\nCommentary: One confined to a single direction is not the most universal under Heaven. Heaven’s office is to cover but not to bear form; Earth’s office is to bear form but not to cover. Only the marvelous source’s function has no fixed direction. Though forced to name it \"Great,\" it does not abide in greatness. Seeking it from greatness, it passes beyond. Seeking it from passing, it becomes distant and unattainable.",

      "translated_text": "From afar one seeks it, and it returns to reside in the human body and mind—thus it is said, \"far-reaching means returning.\" Zhuangzi said: \"The Dao is not confined to the great, nor does it neglect the small.\" Therefore, the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great.\n\nCommentary: Because we force the name \"Great\" upon it, we cite examples of what follows in greatness. Thus, Heaven can suspend the dark mystery above and cover all things; Earth can remain tranquil below and bear all things; the king can govern with clarity and stillness, transforming all things—these are the Three Great Ones, and my Dao unifies them all. Within the realm there are Four Great Ones, and the king is one of them.\n\nCommentary: \"Within the realm\" refers to bounded limits. Yet the great Dao of the mysterious realm is not confined to these limits. If we speak only of what is visible, then Heaven and Earth themselves become boundaries, and the Dao is no longer within them. Here, we borrow words to expound the profound principle, not to contrive strange interpretations. We preserve the text to prevent doubts and difficulties, though many explanations remain incomplete.\n\nNow, \"realm\" is but a name. If we take the name as the essence, it is because things have no essence beyond their names—hence \"within the realm.\" If we speak of the Dao, the Dao is within it; if we speak of Heaven’s name, Heaven has no body beyond it—thus we say \"within the realm.\" Within the realm of names, there are these Four Great Ones. It is said that the king is one of them because the king is the chief of human spirits. With the Dao, all things receive his virtue; without it, Heaven and Earth suffer harm. Thus, the king is singled out as one of the Four Great Ones, to urge him to model himself on the Dao’s spontaneity.\n\nMan models himself on Earth; Earth models itself on Heaven; Heaven models itself on the Dao; the Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\nCommentary: \"Man\" here refers to the king. We call him \"man\" because he can emulate Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, and the Dao’s clarity and stillness, so that all under Heaven turn to him. If he fails, the people will have no one to follow. Thus, we call him \"man\" as a warning. The king should first embrace Earth’s tranquility; by abiding in tranquility, he should then emulate Heaven’s life-giving transformation, extending his merit to all things. Next, he should emulate the Dao’s clarity and stillness, forgetting his merit in things and allowing them to transform themselves. If the ruler can do this, he aligns with the Dao’s modeling of spontaneity. The Dao’s modeling of spontaneity does not mean imitating spontaneity.\n\nIf, as some confused critics argue, the Dao models itself after spontaneity, then within the realm there would be Five Great Ones, not Four. They further cite the *Western Ascension Scripture*, which says: \"Emptiness and nothingness give birth to spontaneity; spontaneity gives birth to the Dao.\" This makes the Dao the grandchild of emptiness and nothingness, the child of spontaneity, arbitrarily imposing a sequence to establish hierarchy, severing the source and uprooting the foundation—how deeply inverted!\n\nLet us examine this: \"Emptiness and nothingness\" are the essence of the wondrous origin, an essence that is not a thing, hence called \"emptiness and nothingness.\" \"Spontaneity\" is the nature of the wondrous origin, a nature that is not contrived, hence called \"spontaneity.\" The \"Dao\" is the function of the wondrous origin, what we force a name upon, yet it universally generates—hence we call it the Dao. If we trace the names of essence and function, we call it \"emptiness and nothingness.\" Spontaneity and the Dao are one—when we seek their source, they are but the single wondrous origin. What, then, is there to imitate? Thus, the critics’ objections fail to grasp the mystery’s pivot.\n\n**Chapter 26: Weight as the Root of Lightness**\nThe previous chapter, speaking of the Four Great Ones within the realm, ultimately urges modeling on the Dao’s spontaneity. This chapter clarifies that weight and stillness are sovereign, warning against treating the self lightly and the realm carelessly. The first two lines state the principle to reveal its meaning; the next two use analogy to clarify it. The following four lament the ruler’s loss of the Dao, and the final two describe the perils of frivolity and restlessness as a warning.\n\nWeight is the root of lightness; stillness is the sovereign of restlessness.\n\nCommentary: \"Root\" means foundation. The flowers and leaves of plants are light, yet they grow from the root and stem—if the root and stem are agitated, the weight of the root becomes their foundation. Thus, weight is the root of lightness. Weight implies stillness; lightness implies restlessness. Since weight is the root of lightness, stillness is the sovereign of restlessness. Weight has the power to restrain lightness; stillness has the strength to govern restlessness. Thus, when authority is weighty, even the labor of lifting the nose is accomplished; when the mind is still, even the desire to chew ceases.\n\nTherefore, the noble person travels all day yet does not leave the baggage wagon.\n\nCommentary: The \"noble person\" refers to the ruler, for his aspirations can govern people and nurture things—hence we call him \"noble.\" The *zī* is a covered wagon. Weight is the origin of lightness—this is an analogy. The ruler should always maintain weight and stillness, just as one does not depart from the baggage wagon. If a traveler loses his baggage, he will have nothing to rely on and will surely suffer cold and hunger. If the ruler indulges in frivolity and restlessness, his ministers will scatter, and disaster will arise. Thus, it is said he travels all day without leaving the baggage wagon.\n\nThough he may have splendid sights, he dwells in them with serene detachment.\n\nCommentary: If the ruler values weight and stillness, the people will not be overburdened. But if he ascends high towers, sails deep pools, strikes bells, and dances with women as splendid sights, the people’s strength will be exhausted, and chaos and ruin will follow. Thus, the warning: though there may be splendid sights, he should dwell in them with tranquil ease, detached and unconcerned.\n\nHow could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his own person lightly before the realm?\n\nCommentary: The Son of Heaven governs a million *jǐng* of land, levies taxes from 640,000 *jǐng*, commands a million warhorses and ten thousand chariots—hence he is called the lord of ten thousand chariots. \"How could\" is an expression of lament. The realm is the great treasure’s seat. The lord of ten thousand chariots unifies the Four Seas; he should ensure his descendants number in the thousands and his lineage endures for a hundred generations. If he governs well, there will be effortless transformation; if he embraces virtue, all will return to benevolence. How could he, entrusted with this great vessel, indulge in pleasure, surrendering his person to desire and leading all to ruin? Thus, for the sake of personal desire, he treats the great treasure’s seat lightly—how lamentable!",

      "translated_text": "To act lightly is to lose one’s ministers; to act rashly is to lose one’s lord.\n\n**Commentary:** If a lord is overly frivolous, he will inevitably cause disturbance; with disturbance, people scatter—who then will serve as his ministers? Thus it is said, *to act lightly is to lose one’s ministers*—this is a warning to rulers. As for ministers, they must measure their abilities when accepting office, lest they invite slander by advancing too swiftly. If one feigns merit to seek favor, adorns deceit to chase glory, and pursues promotion with such rashness, disaster will soon follow, and exile or execution will be self-inflicted—how then can one serve a lord? Thus it is said, *to act rashly is to lose one’s lord*—this extends the warning to ministers.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: \"Good Practice Leaves No Tracks\"**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that gravity and stillness make one a lord, cautioning against treating the realm lightly; this chapter elucidates that words and deeds should leave no trace, urging constant goodness in saving others. To uphold gravity and stillness is to embody non-action. To practice good words and deeds is to value forgetting and relinquishment. First, it sets forth the five virtues of conduct, then expounds the compassion of saving others, and finally unfolds the teaching of mutual forgetting—though it concludes with the essential principle of profound subtlety.\n\n**Good practice leaves no tracks.**\n\n**Commentary:** This reveals the purity of the Dharma-nature. *Practice* refers to cultivation. The Dharma-nature is pure, and this is called the profound mystery. Though one relies on diligent practice, one must remain unattached—arising and ceasing in succession, practicing yet without practice, harmonizing with the Dao. This is called *good practice*. If one can achieve this, emptiness and form become equal, and both realm and mind are purified. To seek tracks in such a state—is it not difficult? Thus it is said, *good practice leaves no tracks.*\n\n**Good words leave no flaws or blame.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that one of good practice does not cling to verbal teachings. *Flaw* means defect; *blame* means reproach. *Words* refer to teachings. If one’s practice is boundless, one can comprehend verbal teachings without becoming attached to them—transcending words while using words. This is *good words*. If one can do this, one preserves the meaning while discarding the form, perceiving the principle while forgetting the words. In such verbal teachings, there is not a single defect or reproach. Thus it is said, *good words leave no flaws or blame.*\n\n**The good reckoner uses no counting rods.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that when verbal teachings leave no trace, there are no divergent paths. If one clings to words and is bound by practice, debating right and wrong, even the most skilled reckoner cannot calculate it. But if one understands that all dharmas are expedient gates, ultimately pure and free from discriminating views, then one need not labor over counting rods or calculations to naturally enter the One Vehicle. If one reckons so well, why rely on counting rods? Thus it is said, *the good reckoner uses no counting rods.*\n\n**The good closer needs no bolts or bars to remain unopened.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that when one no longer calculates divergent paths, the mind of desire naturally closes. *Bolt* is horizontal; *bar* is vertical. If one practices goodness and closure without attachment or stagnation, the mind remains luminous and pure, and sensory dust does not arise. Thus it is said, *the good closer needs no bolts or bars—how could it be opened?* Hence, *the good closer needs no bolts or bars to remain unopened.*\n\n**The good binder uses no ropes or ties to remain unsolved.**\n\n**Commentary:** This shows that one who is good at closure unites the mind with the Dao. *Bind* means to fasten; *rope* means cord; *tie* means restraint; *solve* means to loosen. If one sits in forgetfulness and transcends perception, deeply harmonizing with the source of the Dao amidst all dharmas, one can avoid being bound by the mind. This is called *good binding*. Those who use ropes and ties will find that when the rope frays, the tie loosens. But those bound by the Dao find that when the mind is still, the Dao becomes obscure. Even if all conditions arise, one remains unstained. Though no ropes or ties are used, how could it be loosened and undone? Thus it is said, *the good binder uses no ropes or ties to remain unsolved.*\n\n**Therefore, the sage constantly saves others, and so abandons no one.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Therefore* introduces what follows to clarify what precedes. Though the sage’s mind is serene and still, their teaching flows freely. Thus, they constantly use their goodness to save others, ensuring all attain clarity and understanding. With great compassion and impartiality, they guide all people without exception. Thus it is said, *constantly saves others, and so abandons no one.*\n\n**Constantly saves all things, and so abandons nothing.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Things* encompass both the sentient and insentient. Saving people with good teaching means not abandoning them; saving things with a good heart means not abandoning anything. This allows all beings—moving and still—to flourish without premature harm. Thus it is said, *constantly saves all things, and so abandons nothing.*\n\n**This is called \"inheriting illumination.\"**\n\n**Commentary:** *Inheriting* means subtle application; *illumination* means clear awakening. Saving others through good practice lies in forgetting and relinquishment. If one clings to teachings and prides oneself on attainment, tracks will remain. Thus, though one constantly saves others, one must ultimately ensure the wisdom-mind remains unobstructed. Such subtle application leads to awakening. Thus it is said, *this is called \"inheriting illumination.\"*\n\n**Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Teacher* means model. The good person, free from all attachments, has a pure mind; unobstructed by dharmas, their teaching is all-pervading. Like water, it reflects whatever comes before it—what is reflected takes form, while the one reflecting remains without mind. The good person’s wisdom is like this, and so can serve as the teacher and model for the not-good.\n\n**The not-good person is the resource of the good.**\n\n**Commentary:** *Resource* means to take. Fire has warmth, and the cold draw near. Those who hear the Dao and practice diligently must rely on a master. Having praised the teacher’s goodness, one must submit to the disciple’s labor. Thus, the not-good person can be taken and employed by the good.",

When August Heaven commands the Emperor to govern all beings, it must await the mandate resting upon one’s person before one may rule the ten thousand lands. Yet treacherous and rebellious villains, violent and cruel men, would seize the realm by force and make themselves its lord. Since they have no time even to purge their own crimes, how can they hope for Heaven’s favor? Thus the Old Master warns: I see that such men shall never achieve what they seek. 已 is an auxiliary particle.)*\n\nThe realm is the sacred vessel—it cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it shall ruin it.\n*(Commentary: The realm’s precious seat cannot be seized by force because it is the vessel of Heaven and Earth’s numinous power, meant to endure under sagely rulers of constant virtue and spread the transformation of harmonious kindness. How could violent and cruel men be allowed to act upon it by force and poison the realm? Thus it cannot be acted upon, and those who do shall surely fail. This is a warning to treacherous and rebellious ministers.)*\n\nThose who grasp shall lose it.\n*(Commentary: Rulers—whether restoring order after chaos or succeeding to the throne to uphold tradition—must all manifest virtue and suppress transgression, showing compassion and seeking to relieve suffering. If one clings to this position and tyrannizes the divine lord, allowing the state to descend into chaos without semblance of order, then Heaven’s Way will bar the way of excess, the spirits will grow angry, and the people will harbor resentment. Disasters will arise, and turmoil will follow—who then will uphold such a ruler? He shall lose this position. This is a warning to emperors and kings.)*\n\nThus things: some move forward, some follow behind;\nsome exhale warmth, some blow cold;\nsome grow strong, some weaken;\nsome are upheld, some collapse.\n*(Commentary: This shows that all things are inconstant, and affairs rise and fall in mutual dependence. 呴 is warm breath; 吹 is cold breath. 强 is strength; 羸 is weakness. 载 means to undertake; 隳 means to destroy. Since acting leads to ruin and grasping leads to loss, so too do things: some advance ahead, some trail behind; some exhale warmth, some blow cold; some are supported to grow strong, some are suppressed to grow weak; some are drawn forth to undertake affairs, some are pushed to collapse. All are tangled together, without fixed measure. Only by following the people’s desires can one be joyfully accepted without resentment.)*\n\nTherefore the sage abandons excess, abandons extravagance, abandons excessiveness.\n*(Commentary: Thus the sage who governs the realm, seeing that movement and following are inconstant and knowing that clinging leads to loss, restrains himself and examines his conduct, cutting away greed and curbing desire. He abandons extreme actions, abandons lavish adornments, abandons excessive indulgence. Though named as three, they are in truth one. Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness all transgress proper measure.)*\n\n**Chapter 30**\nThe previous chapter showed that clinging leads to loss, and thus one must abandon excess, extravagance, and excessiveness. This chapter shows that military strength invites retribution and that one must not indulge in arrogance and aggression.

The section from \"Where armies encamp\" onward clarifies that a fondness for war inevitably brings misfortune, and from \"Thus the good\" onward demonstrates that one must act only when unavoidable.

If instead one brandishes the might of weapons and armor, exhausts the affairs of invasion and conquest, and wages war against others, they will surely respond.

      "translated_text": "**Commentary:** *Shī* (师) means \"military forces,\" and as the *Yijing* states, \"The army is the multitude.\" When armies are mobilized and multitudes set in motion, people are wearied by service. On the march, they must carry provisions and be escorted, disrupting labor and harming agriculture. With farming neglected, brambles grow. After great armies pass, the accumulated costs are vast. Harmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, but the *qi* of war invites harm. Floods and droughts follow in succession, crops fail to grow, and thus years of famine and disaster inevitably come as retribution for the grievances of endless warfare.\n\nTherefore, the wise act only to achieve their aim and dare not seek dominance through force.\n**Commentary:** The *Chunqiu* states, \"To slay the enemy is called *guǒ* (果).\" Here, it is made clear that slaying the enemy prevents mutual aggression and halts their violence. Thus, to slay the enemy is to achieve *guǒ*—that is, to stop the enemy. Laozi says: In all matters, one should act only when unavoidable. If forced to employ arms, the best use of force is merely to halt killing, preventing further predation. One must never use the many to oppress the few or bully others to assert dominance. To assert dominance invites retribution, and thus the warning is given: dare not seek dominance through force.\n\nAct decisively but do not boast; act decisively but do not vaunt your achievements; act decisively but do not grow arrogant.\n**Commentary:** The proper use of force is to decisively halt the enemy. If one halts the enemy yet boasts of it, this cannot be called a virtuous victory. Therefore, though one may decisively halt the enemy, one must take care never to boast or brag. Boasting and bragging lead to the pursuit of merit, so even when one acts decisively to halt the enemy, the warning is given: do not vaunt your achievements. To vaunt one’s achievements is to become arrogant and overbearing. Arrogance and overbearing lead to delight in killing, and such delight ensures defeat in the blink of an eye. This is a clear warning—how can one not be cautious?\n\nTo act decisively is unavoidable; thus, act decisively but do not rely on force.\n**Commentary:** To act decisively in halting the enemy is not to seek victory by overpowering others, but rather, when the enemy invades and there is no alternative, one must act decisively when unavoidable. *Yǐ* (已) means \"to halt.\" When employing arms in response to the enemy, one does not seek victory but merely halts aggression. One who can do this does not rely on force to win, and thus it is said: act decisively but do not rely on force.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way.\" What does not follow the Way comes to an early end.\n**Commentary:** All things, when they reach their peak, begin to age. When armies grow too strong, they meet defeat. Thus, relying on military strength is like a thing relying on its prime—both only hasten their decline. An army that relies on strength cannot preserve its virtuous victory. These two matters—things in their prime and armies in their strength—are called \"not following the Way.\" Wise ministers and enlightened rulers, recognizing this, must halt such actions early. Thus, it is said: what does not follow the Way comes to an early end. *Yǐ* (已) means \"to halt.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 31: On Fine Armies**\nThe previous chapter clarified that strong armies invite retribution and that one must not act decisively with boasting or vaunting. This chapter explains that fine armies are things some despise, and one should employ them only when unavoidable. It begins by admonishing their inauspiciousness, showing that those who follow the Way do not engage in them. Next, it states that even in victory, one should not take pride, demonstrating that delight in killing is wrong. It then offers analogies from auspicious affairs to clarify, concluding with the rites of mourning to show that one should not delight in war.\n\nFine armies are inauspicious instruments.\n**Commentary:** *Jiā* (佳) means \"fine.\" *Bīng* (兵) refers to military strategies and the like. *Xiáng* (祥) means \"auspicious.\" *Qì* (器) means \"tools\" or \"instruments.\" The noble person advances virtue and cultivates their work, carefully tending to beginnings, concealing their instruments within, and awaiting the right moment to act. They should wander in the gardens of the Way and virtue, roam the forests of ancient texts, so that their illustrious name shines forth, and they accomplish great deeds. Yet some take delight in military strategies and tactical manuals. The crafting of strategies turns the proper into the extraordinary; books on military tactics emphasize display over substance, all centering on attack, war, and slaughter. Thus, they are inauspicious instruments.\n\nSome despise them, and therefore those who follow the Way do not engage in them.\n**Commentary:** To cultivate virtue within is to fulfill one’s capacity. Since these are inauspicious instruments, even ordinary things may despise them—how much more so the noble person who follows the Way? How could they willingly involve themselves in such matters? Thus, it is said: those who follow the Way do not engage in them.\n\nThe noble person values the left in times of peace and the right in times of war.\n**Commentary:** The left is *yáng*; the right is *yīn*. *Yáng* delights in life; *yīn* delights in killing. Delighting in life, the left is valued in times of peace. Delighting in killing, the right is valued in times of war.\n\nArmies are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person.\n**Commentary:** The preceding text states that fine armies are inauspicious instruments, explaining that in war, the right is valued and killing is favored, and thus those who follow the Way do not engage in them. Here, it is said that armies are inauspicious instruments, directly concluding the earlier point: they are not the instruments of the noble person. The noble person takes the Way and virtue as their instruments, and thus nothing is not beneficial.\n\nWhen unavoidable, one employs them, with tranquility as the highest principle.\n**Commentary:** Civil virtue is the instrument of governance and transformation. Military strategy is merely its auxiliary. Thus, civil virtue weaves the patterns of heaven and earth, while martial power quells calamities and chaos. Though heaven generates the five materials, none can be discarded, and the use of martial power must be measured and appropriate. One must recognize that their application has primary and secondary aspects, their execution has proper and improper sequences, and all depends on circumstances. Only when unavoidable does one respond—such as when the four barbarians invade and the royal army launches a punitive expedition. One should then display benevolence and pacify them with the Way and virtue. Like the stinging of mosquitoes and gnats, one should harbor no anger. Extending this principle, tranquility is the highest principle.\n\nVictory should not be glorified. To glorify it is to delight in killing.\n**Commentary:** If one cannot win over others with virtue and resorts to arms to seek victory, though one may prevail, one should still feel shame for one’s lack of virtue and not take pride in it. Victory often entails much killing, so to take pride in victory is to delight in killing.\n\nThose who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n**Commentary:** Heaven and earth delight in life, nurturing all things. The benevolent person should follow heaven’s virtue, making preservation and salvation their duty. How can one recklessly indulge in cunning and force to satisfy their greed? The cruel and rapacious will find no one to follow them. To seek the realization of their ambitions—is this not difficult?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored.\n**Commentary:** The left pertains to yang and life, hence auspicious; the right pertains to yin and death, hence inauspicious. As the *Record of Rites: Tan Gong* states: \"The Master stood with his disciples, clasping his hands, and honored the right. The disciples also honored the right. The Master said, 'You delight in learning, but I have recently lost my elder sister.'\" The disciples then honored the left. The deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right—this is to accord with mourning rites.\n**Commentary:** The supreme general commands the army and is solely responsible for killing, hence he stands on the right. The deputy general, being secondary, does not bear sole responsibility for killing, hence he stands on the left. Now, though the left is honored and the right is humble, the supreme general nonetheless occupies the right, for the Way of warfare is akin to mourning rites, which honor the right. Thus, the supreme general stands on the right, as if placed there by mourning rites.\n\nWhen many are killed, one should mourn them with sorrowful tears.\n**Commentary:** To seek victory in war inevitably entails killing many. Yet victory should not be glorified, so one grieves and weeps in sorrow. The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace. Now, in war, lives are taken—how can a humane heart not feel compassion and weep in sorrow? Is this not fitting?\n\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe mourning rites.\n**Commentary:** Though victory in battle brings rewards and rank, military merit is placed on the right, an inauspicious position, hence it is said to observe mourning rites. Yet war is but an instrument of misfortune—must one don mourning garments and lean on a staff to call it mourning rites? Those who annotate this passage all claim such rites existed in antiquity, but upon searching the classics, no evidence is found. Thus, this interpretation is not adopted here. The reference to the Duke of Qin weeping before his army pertains to mourning defeat, not victory.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that fine weaponry is inauspicious, and thus one of the Dao does not engage in it. This chapter explains that if lords and kings uphold the Dao, the myriad things will naturally submit. It begins by declaring the nameless to elucidate the Dao, then illustrates how upholding the Dao brings forth auspicious signs. The passage on \"beginning to govern\" expands on its application, and the analogy of the Dao concludes the chapter.\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\n**Commentary:** Its responsiveness is inexhaustible, adapting to all circumstances—such is the constancy of the Dao. As it constantly responds, its manifestations are manifold, hence it is nameless in its constancy. Thus, it is said: *The Dao is eternally nameless.*\n\nThough the uncarved block is small, none under heaven dare treat it as a subject.\n**Commentary:** The uncarved block is the wondrous root. Spoken of in terms of its life-giving function, it is called the Dao; discussed in its essence of oneness, it is called the uncarved block. Thus, it is said to be small. Yet in its transformative power, it perfects all things, making it supremely great. Hence, none dare treat the Dao as a subject.\n\nIf lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will naturally submit.\n**Commentary:** If lords and kings can embrace and uphold the wondrous root in its essence of oneness, practicing non-action and non-affair, then all within the four seas will look up to their transformation, submitting in reverence. Bathed in virtue and drinking in harmony, they will naturally yield.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to descend sweet dew.\n**Commentary:** When lords and kings uphold the Dao, peace prevails, and no disasters or calamities arise. Heaven and earth harmonize, their qi intermingling in balance, descending sweet dew as an auspicious omen for the lords and kings.\n\nNo one commands it, yet it distributes itself evenly.\n**Commentary:** *Mo* means \"none.\" Heaven descends sweet dew, bestowing its blessings without intent. No one issues commands, yet it spreads evenly, as if the lords and kings had weighed and distributed it impartially, without bias or favor. When great harmony is achieved through virtuous transformation, from east to west, who would not submit without thought?\n\nAnother interpretation: When lords and kings uphold the Dao to bring forth auspicious signs, the people naturally attain peace. Without the need for commands, all becomes even and unified.\n\nWhen governance begins, names arise. Once names exist,\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means \"to govern.\" *Names* refer to the named things under heaven. *Ji* means \"exhaustively.\" If lords and kings embrace the essence of oneness, heaven will send down auspicious signs, bestowing transformation without intent, spreading evenly and uniformly. Only then can they begin to govern the named things. When things submit to the Dao, all named things become the possession of the lords and kings.\n\nthey too will know when to stop. Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n**Commentary:** *Dai* means \"peril.\" When lords and kings uphold the Dao and transform the world, the myriad things naturally submit. Thus, even named things will know to rely on and stop at the lords and kings. By relying on a ruler of the Dao, one avoids perilous affairs. Hence, it is said: *Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.*\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams flowing into rivers and seas.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the passage on lords and kings upholding the Dao, to which heaven responds. Thus, it is said: A ruler of the Dao governing the world, shaping it with benevolent virtue, will naturally bring about great peace. When harmonious qi moves heaven, heavenly omens will surely respond, just as valleys and streams flow into rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter 33**\nThe preceding chapter explained that when lords and kings uphold the Dao, the myriad things naturally submit. This chapter clarifies that the reason they submit to a ruler of the Dao lies in self-knowledge and self-mastery. Self-knowledge brings clarity; self-mastery brings strength. It concludes with the idea of *dying yet not perishing*, warning against violating the principles of heaven.\n\nOne who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened.\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means \"to discern.\" When the mind engages with external things, knowledge arises. The mind that arises from such engagement discerns past matters—this is called *knowing the dharma*. When one employs the mind to generate wisdom and discerns the good and evil of others, this is commonly called *wisdom*. But if one turns inward, examining without relying on the mind, clearly observing the mind without generating knowledge of the dharma—one who can do this is said to be *enlightened*. Hence, it is said: *One who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened.*\n\nOne who conquers others has strength; one who conquers oneself is mighty.",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary:**\n\"One who conquers others\" refers to using power and authority to overpower others—such a person may only be called *strong*. \"One who conquers oneself\" means mastering one’s own mind, rendering it soft and yielding. The Way of softness and yielding cannot be overcome by external things, thus preserving one’s true strength. Hence, the following passage states: *\"To guard softness is to be strong.\"* It also says: *\"The soft overcomes the hard,\"* and thus: *\"One who conquers oneself is mighty.\"*\n\n\"One who knows contentment is rich.\"\n**Commentary:** Contentment resides in the mind. If the mind knows contentment, it will be free from greed and desire. Though one may subsist on simple fare and plain water, one remains lofty and self-sufficient—this may be called *rich*. \"One who acts with perseverance has resolve.\"\n**Commentary:** To exert oneself with unrelenting effort, never slackening or growing weary, knowing oneself and conquering oneself without wavering—this may be called *having resolve*.\n\n\"One who does not lose their proper place endures.\"\n**Commentary:** Practices such as knowing contentment and acting with perseverance are common among people. If one does not lose their constancy in these, they may be said to *endure in the Way*. Another interpretation: One who acts without losing their proper place may long endure.\n\n\"One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\"\n**Commentary:** *Death* is the end of the principle of life. *Perishing* refers to premature or unjust demise. *Longevity* is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. To yield to the natural order, not losing the principle of heaven, and to pass away in accord with transformation—such a one fulfills their allotted span and may be called *long-lived*. If one is driven by relentless ambition, the principle of life remains incomplete. Shan Bao retained the complexion of a child, and Zhang Yi enjoyed wealth and nobility, yet neither fulfilled the principle of heaven—how could they be called *long-lived*? Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"None in the world is longer-lived than an infant who dies young, yet Peng Zu is considered short-lived.\"*\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows Everywhere**\nThe previous chapter showed that even those who submit as guests to a ruler of the Dao do so because he is able to conquer himself. This chapter reveals that all great and glorious achievements arise from modeling the Dao and forgetting merit.\n\nIt begins by declaring, *\"The great Dao flows everywhere,\"* demonstrating that it extends left and right without boundaries or contention. Next, it states, *\"Though its merit is accomplished, it does not claim possession,\"* showing that the small and the great defy naming. Thus, in the passage on the sage below, it praises the sage for not valuing himself, thereby achieving great and glorious deeds.\n\n*\"The great Dao flows everywhere; it may be found to the left or right.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"Flows everywhere\"* describes its unbounded nature. The Dao as a thing is neither yin nor yang, neither soft nor hard. It flows without attachment, responding to all phenomena, available to the left or right without partiality. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The Dao has never had boundaries.\"* *\"The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse them. Its merit is accomplished, yet it does not claim possession.\"*\n**Commentary:** All things in heaven and earth rely on the great Dao’s power of free-flowing generation to sustain their principle of life. Yet the Dao, in its wondrous transformation, is fundamentally without intent. Though things rely on it to live, the Dao does not grow weary or consider it labor. Another interpretation: Things do not refuse the Dao’s grace, for its merit lies in generation and completion. The great Dao’s work of generating things is fully accomplished, yet it does not regard them as its own possession. Another interpretation: The Dao’s generation of things fulfills its virtue and completes its merit, yet though its merit is accomplished, it does not claim possession—this is called *forgetting merit*.\n\n*\"It nurtures the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master. Ever without desire, it may be called small.\"*\n**Commentary:** This is a phonetic gloss on the meaning. *\"It may be called small\"* means it *cannot* be called small. The Dao generates the ten thousand things, nurturing and maturing them without acting as their master. Toward those myriad things, it is ever without desire—how could the Dao be narrow or small? Thus, *\"it may be called small\"* means it *cannot* be called small.\n\n*\"The ten thousand things return to it, yet it does not act as their master—it may be called great.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"The ten thousand things return to it\"* means they return to the Dao’s power of generation and completion. The Dao does not act as their master, yet it does not discard these myriad things—how could the Dao not be vast and great? Thus, *\"it may be called great\"* means it *cannot* be called great. Since it may be found to the left or right, it is neither small nor great. Being neither small nor great, it is truly difficult to name. The annotation states: *\"There are ten thousand differences\"*—this is a passage from *Zhuangzi*.\n\n*\"Therefore, the sage never acts as great, and thus accomplishes greatness.\"*\n**Commentary:** The sage who governs the world spreads virtue and bestows blessings, causing the people’s customs to become pure and transformation to spread. Things flourish and grow, yet the sage models the Dao by forgetting merit, never exalting himself as great. Thus, he accomplishes his great and glorious work.\n\n**End of Volume Four of *The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Annotated and Elucidated Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n**Beginning of Volume Five of *The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Annotated and Elucidated Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue***",

This chapter elucidates that when a ruler employs the Dao, the people return to the transformative influence of peace and harmony. It begins by emphasizing the act of \"holding the image\" to illustrate the principle of return and allegiance. Next, it speaks of \"music and delicacies\" as a metaphor for the cause of such return. The passage beginning with *\"The Dao issues from the mouth\"* expounds upon the teaching of non-action and wordless instruction, urging rulers to employ the Dao.\n\n*\"Hold the great image, and all under heaven will come to you.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Hold* means to grasp or uphold. *The great image* refers to the Dao. This teaches that when a ruler upholds the great Dao to govern the world, acting without contrivance or interference, all things follow their natural course. Observing the times and gauging the winds, all turn toward the ruler of the Dao. Thus, it is said, *\"all under heaven will come to you.\"*\n\n*\"They come and are not harmed; they dwell in peace and tranquility.\"*\n**Commentary:** When people from the four directions, drawn by the ruler’s transformative influence, come to him, the sovereign governs with the Dao, offering comfort without harm, and thus they abide in great peace. *Peace* denotes the harmony of governance and teaching; *great* signifies the brilliance of meritorious achievement.\n\n*\"Music and delicacies make the passing traveler pause.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Music* refers to melodies; *delicacies*, to food and drink. This is a metaphor: just as a household with music and food causes passing travelers to linger, so too does a ruler who upholds the great image draw all under heaven to return.\n\n*\"The Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor.\"*\n**Commentary:** *\"The Dao that issues from the mouth\"* refers to the ruler’s restraint of the Dao’s pure and tranquil principles, embodying the teaching of non-action and wordlessness. When first uttered, it seems bland and flavorless—how could it compare to the worldly pleasures of kinship, praise, fear, or shame, which are deemed savory?\n\n*\"Look at it, and it cannot be seen; listen to it, and it cannot be heard. Yet its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Inexhaustible* means without end. The transformative power of the Dao, being non-action, is bland and impartial. It neither imposes harsh scrutiny nor enacts ostentatious laws. Thus, it cannot be seen when looked upon, nor heard when listened to. Yet, with the passage of years, its surplus is evident: customs become pure, harmony spreads, and all things—animate and inanimate—flourish. Its efficacy is boundless, hence *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Art of Contraction**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that those who practice the transformative power of the Dao become a refuge for all. This chapter reveals that the Dao, when employed as a strategic tool, serves as the state’s most potent instrument. While return leads to peace and tranquility, this instrument must never be displayed to others. It begins by introducing the strategic interplay of contraction and expansion, then demonstrates the practice of softness and weakness, and concludes with the metaphor of the fish and the abyss to illustrate the subtlety of strategic action.\n\n*\"When you wish to contract it, you must first expand it. When you wish to weaken it, you must first strengthen it. When you wish to abolish it, you must first exalt it. When you wish to seize it, you must first bestow it.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Contract* means to gather or restrain. This explains how the sage employs strategic means to guide and transform living beings. Since people possess both dull and keen faculties, teachings must adapt through both expedient and definitive methods. The sage, assessing the nature of beings, employs these methods in alternation. Those of keen faculties, upon perceiving goodness, reform their faults and, with but a slight indication, deeply grasp the root. Those of dull faculties, mired in long-standing delusion, cannot be led to return without strategic means. Thus, to contract their desires, one must first expand them to their utmost, allowing them to become ensnared by their own cravings, whereupon they will naturally contract. The same principle applies to strengthening and weakening, and so forth. When applied, none will fail to trust it. At first hearing, such words may seem contrary to the Dao’s intent, but profound understanding of its mysteries reveals the basis of expedient and definitive methods. Hence, the annotation states: *\"The noble person values strategic action when it aligns with righteousness; the petty person uses it for deceit.\"* The subsequent line, *\"it must not be displayed to others,\"* underscores the difficulty of strategic action.\n\n*\"This is called subtle illumination.\"*\n**Commentary:** The principle of strategic transformation is subtle, yet when its effects are examined, its efficacy is manifest. Thus, it is called *\"subtle illumination.\"*\n\n*\"Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\"*\n**Commentary:** The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Compliance is the means by which strategic action is carried out.\"* This clarifies that compliance, humility, and modesty enable the exercise of strategic action. Thus, to contract, one first expands; to weaken, one first strengthens. Yet ultimately, contraction and weakness prevail—this is how softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength. Hence, it is said, *\"Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\"*\n\n*\"Fish cannot be removed from the abyss; the state’s sharpest instruments must not be displayed to others.\"*\n**Commentary:** *Removed* means to lose. *Sharpest instruments* refer to strategic means. Just as fish depend on water, so too does the ruler wield authority. If fish lose water, they are caught by others; if strategic means are improperly displayed, they are usurped by petty men, who manipulate them for deceit.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that the Dao may employ strategic means, demonstrating the art of contraction and expansion. This chapter emphasizes that such strategy must align with righteousness, ultimately anchoring the uncarved block of simplicity. Thus, *\"The Dao constantly practices non-action,\"* and if lords and kings uphold it, all things transform of themselves. Simplicity does not desire the world’s stillness, yet the world becomes clear of itself. Laozi speaks to elucidate the wordless, teaching to relinquish teaching. Thus, he expounds this chapter at the close of the *Upper Classic*, entrusting it to those who, through profound insight, may forget both words and their absence.\n\n*\"The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\"*\n**Commentary:** The nature of the Dao is pure and tranquil, its wondrous essence profoundly still—hence, it constantly practices non-action. All things rely upon it for birth and growth; it responds unfailingly to all stimuli—hence, nothing is left undone. Those who act always leave something undone; thus, those who practice non-action leave nothing undone.\n\n*\"If lords and kings can uphold it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\"*\n**Commentary:** If lords and kings uphold the Dao’s purity and tranquility, practicing non-action and refraining from interference, the myriad things will naturally respond to their transformative influence, and the ruler’s virtuous teaching will restore simplicity.\n\n*\"When transformation stirs desire, I shall restrain it with the nameless uncarved block.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary:** The \"nameless uncarved block\" is the Dao. \"Desire stirs\" refers to the impulse toward action and intervention. \"I\" is the self-designation of kings and lords. This means: when people receive virtuous teaching and transform accordingly, the ruler’s virtue becomes non-active and pure. Yet if they again stir desire and act with intervention, I shall restrain them with the nameless uncarved block, calming them so they return to purity and stillness, free from the impulse to act. Even the nameless uncarved block must not be desired.\n\n**Commentary:** Above, it was said that when common people stir desire and act with intervention, the ruler shall restrain them with the nameless uncarved block. Now it is said that even the nameless uncarved block must not be desired—if one clings to the nameless, traces remain, and sentient beings, following these traces, lose their root and fall back into intervention, no different from the desires they sought to overcome. Thus, the nameless uncarved block is first used to calm the desires of the people; once their desires are dispelled, the sage also relinquishes the nameless. It is like medicine used to treat illness—once the illness is cured, the medicine is forgotten; like a boat used to cross water—once the crossing is complete, the boat is abandoned. If one clings to the boat after crossing or continues taking medicine after recovery, not only will the far shore remain unreached, but new afflictions will arise.\n\n*\"Not desiring, one attains stillness, and the world will right itself.\"*\n**Commentary:** When even the nameless uncarved block is no longer desired, and the desire for non-desire is likewise forgotten, profound tranquility emerges—this is called complete liberation. The ruler practices non-action and governs from above; the people follow their nature and transform below. Without the need for commands or decrees, the world naturally attains order. Thus it is said, \"the world will right itself.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 38: \"Supreme Virtue Does Not Insist on Virtue\"**\nThis chapter begins by outlining the function of the Dao, then clarifies the transformative power of complete virtue. When virtue is whole, simplicity remains undivided, and the age knows no need for mutual aid. When the Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise, and customs suffer from superficiality and dissipation. To change and restore the original state, the text first describes the non-action of supreme virtue, then the deviations of benevolence and righteousness, concluding with the call to abandon ornamentation and return to substance, so that simplicity and purity may be restored.\n\n*\"Supreme virtue does not insist on virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\"*\n**Commentary:** \"Supreme\" refers to the era. \"Virtue\" denotes its function. In high antiquity, simplicity and non-action governed; embodying the essence of the Dao, it allowed things to follow their nature—this was the unadulterated virtue of that age, hence \"supreme virtue.\" Profound virtue operates in hiddenness, beyond human naming, hence \"does not insist on virtue.\" Yet its harmonious influence spreads, and all things thrive and grow; its power remains complete, hence \"possesses virtue.\" The note, *\"That by which things are enabled to live is called virtue,\"* is from the *Miscellaneous Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*.\n\n*\"Inferior virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.\"*\n**Commentary:** This speaks of the gradual decline of simplicity and virtue. The sage praises the wind of non-action, yet the people strive for progress in non-action, clinging to traces and falling short—hence \"inferior virtue.\" Striving for progress implies virtue can be named, hence \"does not lose virtue.\" Yet naming virtue leads to attachment; attachment corrupts simplicity, hence \"lacks virtue.\"\n\n*\"Supreme virtue practices non-action and has no purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** This further explains supreme virtue. Supreme virtue operates in hiddenness, governing through non-action; simplicity remains undivided, hence no trace of progress. Here, \"supreme virtue practices non-action\" means it embodies simplicity, naturally enacting non-action—not knowing the beauty of non-action and thus practicing it. Hence, \"has no purpose in doing so.\" Not only is there no progress to boast of, but even the intention to transform is absent. Thus the note says, *\"Both heart and trace are free of action.\"*\n\n*\"Inferior virtue acts and has purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** This further explains inferior virtue. \"Inferior virtue acts\" means it admires the transformative power of non-action and thus practices it—hence \"acts.\" Though the heart desires non-action, the trace reveals attachment—hence \"has purpose in doing so.\" Inferior virtue’s action has a reason for being. Thus the note says, *\"The heart is non-active, but the trace is active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme benevolence acts yet has no purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** Below, this clarifies that when the Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise. \"Supreme benevolence\" means taking benevolence as supreme; the rest follow this pattern. Benevolence is the name for universal love. When the great Dao prevails, things receive no private favor; as simplicity scatters, universal love remains. Here, it explains the practice of benevolence: \"supreme benevolence acts\"—practicing benevolence while forgetting benevolence, giving without seeking reward. Yet universal love cannot reach all, and this small kindness remains untrustworthy. Thus, the heart is always occupied—hence \"acts.\" The trace, however, approaches non-action—hence \"has no purpose in doing so.\" The note says, *\"Here, the heart is active, but the trace is non-active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme righteousness acts and has purpose in doing so.\"*\n**Commentary:** Righteousness means appropriateness—cutting, shaping, and deciding so that things attain their proper place. When simplicity is already broken, right and wrong arise. To cut away wrong and affirm right, ensuring appropriateness, it is called \"supreme righteousness acts.\" The heart desires to cut away wrong and affirm right, acting with purpose—hence \"has purpose in doing so.\" The note says, *\"Here, both heart and trace are active.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme ritual acts, yet none respond—then it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\"*\n**Commentary:** Ritual means conduct—what can be followed and practiced. *Zhuangzi* says, *\"Ritual is like wings, used to navigate the world.\"* The institution of ritual aims to remedy decline. Thus, the *Book of Rites* has three hundred rules, and the *Rites of Zhou* three thousand ceremonies—elaborate safeguards and detailed regulations. Once the pure source is lost, affairs compete in chaos. Ritual preserves external restraints, not the inner principle. Bowing and yielding elevate its forms; jade and silk display reciprocity. To give without return is not ritual; to receive without reciprocation is also not ritual.",

      "translated_text": "Here, when supreme ritual is performed yet none respond, one rolls up their sleeves in anger to compel compliance—hence the phrase *\"rolls up their sleeves to compel it.\"*\n\nThus, the Way is lost and then virtue follows; virtue is lost and then benevolence follows; benevolence is lost and then righteousness follows; righteousness is lost and then ritual follows.\n\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the origin of decline. *\"Losing the Way\"* refers to the highest virtue. The highest virtue aligns with the Way, hence it is called *\"losing the Way.\"* The preceding chapter states, *\"When the great Way is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.\"* *Zhuangzi* says, *\"The Way is obscured by petty achievements,\"* for the Way is never absent. Yet here it is called *\"lost\"*—this is in reference to people. When customs are pure, the great Way prevails; when customs are shallow, petty achievements arise. Once petty achievements arise, the great Way is obscured; when benevolence and righteousness are practiced, the highest virtue declines. This marks the divergence of worldly customs in their shallowness. The sage adapts to the times: as simplicity gradually dissipates, the Way is lost and then virtue follows; as virtue further declines, benevolence follows; with traces of universal love remaining, righteousness follows; when restraints are insufficient, ritual follows.\n\nTo discuss ritual in an age of simplicity is either madness or folly; to forget ritual in an age of shallowness is either stupidity or deceit. Thus, the sage’s intent to save the world never changes, yet the methods for peace or peril cannot be uniform.\n\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Now\"* introduces the point. When later sages practice ritual, it is to remedy the decline of loyalty and trust. If people embraced loyalty and trust, what need would there be for ritual laws? *\"The beginning of chaos\"* means that ritual prevents disorder, yet it can only be the starting point for governing chaos—not the transformative power of the Way.\n\n*\"Foreknowledge\"* is the flower of the Way and the beginning of folly.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Foreknowledge\"* refers to those who establish ritual. It is called *\"foreknowledge\"* because they create these external restraints before human nature’s inherent understanding. The Way flows with human nature, while ritual exists as external traces. Compared to the Way, it deviates from simplicity, hence it is the *\"flower of the Way.\"* *\"The beginning of folly\"*—ritual is meant to pacify chaos, addressing disorder to restore harmony and return to simplicity. Yet those who practice ritual in the world do not cultivate the inner nature but focus on external adornments. Reverence and love are lacking, while gifts and silks abound. This is not the insight of the enlightened but the beginning of folly. Hence, it is called *\"the beginning of folly.\"*\n\nTherefore, the great man abides in depth, not shallowness; dwells in substance, not ornament.\n\n**Commentary:** The *\"great man\"* is the noble person of the Way—the ruler of highest virtue mentioned earlier. *\"Depth and substance\"* refer to the effortless power of the Way and virtue; *\"shallowness and ornament\"* refer to the deliberate acts of ritual and righteousness. The sage prioritizes the transformative power of the Way and virtue, hence *\"abides in depth and substance,\"* and defers the teachings of ritual and righteousness, hence *\"does not dwell in ornament or shallowness.\"* Thus, *\"rejects that and embraces this.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"That\"* refers to ritual and righteousness; *\"this\"* refers to the Way and virtue. The sage rejects the superficiality of ritual and righteousness and embraces the depth of the Way and virtue. Yet in truth, the sage’s myriad considerations converge as one, and both extremes dissolve—how could there be *\"that\"* and *\"this\"* to reject or embrace? This is merely a teaching to guide the ordinary.\n\n**Chapter 39: Those of Old Who Obtained the One**\nThe previous chapter clarified the distinction between highest virtue and ritual, between simplicity and shallowness, hence it presented the great man’s choice to guide others toward the proper path. This chapter explains how things attain the function of the Way and are completed: when they tread the Way, they endure; when they boast of it, they perish. Thus, it recounts the humble virtue of lords and kings as the foundation of sincerity.\n\n*\"Those of old who obtained the One:\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Of old\"* refers to antiquity. *\"The One\"* is the harmonious qi. It is called *\"the One\"* because it unites with things, unchanging across past and present—hence *\"the One.\"* The *Book of Changes* states, *\"One yin and one yang are called the Way,\"* clarifying that the qi of the Way unites with yin when in yin and with yang when in yang. *\"Obtained of old\"* introduces the origin and traces the end, returning the branch to the root. Thus, it cites the ancient attainment to illustrate the present text. The principles of obtaining the One are outlined below.\n\n*\"Heaven obtained the One and became clear;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Among vast phenomena, none is greater than the primal qi of Heaven. Thus, it is first presented as the foremost of those who obtained the One. The pure yang qi, by obtaining the One, can arch broadly to cover and initiate the myriad things.\n\n*\"Earth obtained the One and became stable;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Among vast forms, none is greater than the pattern of Earth. The pure yin substance, by obtaining the One, can bear weight and nurture the myriad things.\n\n*\"The spirits obtained the One and became numinous;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Spirits\"* refers to the wondrous workings of the myriad things. By obtaining the One, they can transform without limit, beyond all form and inquiry.\n\n*\"The valleys obtained the One and became full;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Water flows into streams as brooks, and into brooks as valleys. When valleys obtain the One, their springs flow abundantly, ever full and inexhaustible.\n\n*\"The myriad things obtained the One and came to life;\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Things\"* encompasses all—moving and still, sentient and insentient. By obtaining the harmonious qi, they can grow, move, and never cease.\n\n*\"Lords and kings obtained the One and became the norm for the world.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *\"Lords and kings\"* are rulers. *\"Lords\"* are the ranks of the five nobles; *\"kings\"* are the lords of ten thousand chariots. When lords and kings obtain the One, they can perpetually govern the world, ensuring nothing is unserved, and become the standard of peace for the world. Some versions use *\"upright\"* (貞) instead of *\"norm\"* (正), but *\"upright\"* means *\"norm.\"*\n\n*\"This is how they attained it.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding meaning and introduces the following text.",

      "translated_text": "To attain is to obtain. How do the clarity of heaven, the tranquility of earth, the numinous transformations of spirits, the fullness of valleys, the growth of things, and the upright peace of lords and kings come to be? All arise from the wondrous workings of obtaining the Dao. This clarifies the benefits of attaining the Dao. The following text elucidates the harms of losing the Dao.\n\nShould heaven lack the means to remain clear, it may fear splitting apart.\n**Commentary:** *\"Lack the means\"* is an expression of utmost sincerity. *\"Means\"* signifies use. Those who pride themselves on preservation lose, while those who cling to attainment forfeit. Heaven attains the Dao’s use to achieve clarity and lightness; if it fails to uphold the harmonious and tranquil Dao, merely priding itself on its clarity, it may fear breaking apart and losing its form.\n\nShould earth lack the means to remain tranquil, it may fear eruption.\n**Commentary:** Earth attains the Dao’s use to achieve stillness; it must forget its tranquility. If it prides itself on its stillness, it may fear erupting and losing its shape.\n\nShould spirits lack the means to remain numinous, they may fear exhaustion.\n**Commentary:** Spirits attain the Dao’s use to achieve boundless transformation; they must forget their essence. If they pride themselves on their numinosity, they may fear exhaustion and lose their wondrous workings.\n\nShould valleys lack the means to remain full, they may fear depletion.\n**Commentary:** Valleys attain the Dao’s use to achieve emptiness and receptivity; they must remain full. If they pride themselves on their fullness, they may fear drying up and losing their flowing nourishment.\n\nShould the myriad things lack the means to live, they may fear extinction.\n**Commentary:** The myriad things attain the Dao’s use to achieve growth; they must forget their life. If they pride themselves on possessing it, they may fear death and extinction, ceasing to be living spirits.\n\nShould lords and kings lack the means to remain noble and exalted, they may fear collapse.\n**Commentary:** *\"Collapse\"* means to stumble and fall. Lords and kings attain the Dao’s use to become rulers of the world; they must forget their loftiness and cultivate humility. If they pride themselves on their nobility, they may fear stumbling and failing to bring order to the world.\n\n**Annotation:** The sagely teachings have been passed down through the ages for the sake of living beings. Though it begins by citing the clarity of heaven and the tranquility of earth, it ultimately returns to exhorting lords and kings to embrace the feminine and employ the Dao. As the *Book* says, *\"Heaven generates the myriad things, but only humans are endowed with spirit.\"* The supreme sovereign acts as the parent of the people. Thus, the sagely teachings are directed toward the one ruler. Though it begins by warning heaven and earth to forget the merit of their clarity and tranquility, it ends by admonishing lords and kings not to pride themselves on their power to nurture and transform. The way of humility is fully expounded below.\n\nThus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation.\n**Commentary:** *\"Noble\"* and *\"high\"* refer to lords and kings; *\"lowly\"* and *\"low\"* refer to the common people. Lords and kings attain nobility through the common people, showing that the lowly and low are the root and foundation of the noble and high. As the *Book* says, *\"The people are the root of the state; when the root is firm, the state is at peace.\"* When a ruler diligently practices humility and gathers the people, it may be called securing the state’s root.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"To delight in their joyful harmony and threefold transformation\"*—the *Odes* say, *\"The joyful and harmonious lord is the parent of the people.\"* *\"Joyful\"* means delight; *\"harmonious\"* means ease. When a lord possesses the virtue of joy and ease, he nurtures the people, and the hundred clans long for him as children do for their mother. If his virtue is the opposite, the people will scatter.\n\nThus, lords and kings refer to themselves as *\"the solitary,\"* *\"the bereft,\"* and *\"the unworthy.\"* Is this not taking the lowly as their root? Is it not so?\n**Commentary:** *\"Thus\"* concludes the preceding meaning. When lords and kings refer to themselves as *\"the solitary,\"* *\"the bereft,\"* and *\"the unworthy,\"* as in the *Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Zuo*, *\"I and my two or three ministers grieve over the loss of our state,\"* or when they call themselves *\"the bereft one,\"* following the example of former rulers who deemed *\"the bereft one\"* worthy, or when they say *\"the unworthy,\"* for *\"unworthy\"* means *\"not good\"*—these three titles are what people despise, yet lords and kings place them at the forefront of their self-designations. This is humility in self-cultivation, not pride in their loftiness. *\"Is this not taking the lowly as their root?\"* asks whether this is indeed taking the lowly as their root. *\"Is it not so?\"* is a rhetorical question, to which the answer is: *\"Truly, it is taking the lowly as their root.\"*\n\nThus, counting the parts of a carriage yields no carriage.\n**Commentary:** *\"Thus\"* continues from the above. The preceding text clarifies that lords and kings attain nobility through the lowly, but nobility has no fixed form, and its principle is difficult to grasp. Thus, it borrows the example of a carriage’s parts to illustrate. When one counts all the parts of a carriage, there is ultimately no *\"carriage\"*—only wheels and shafts temporarily assembled to bear the name *\"carriage.\"* This analogy applies to lords and kings: counting the nobility of lords and kings ultimately yields no *\"nobility\"*—only the lowly, temporarily borrowed to constitute the nobility of lords and kings. Wheels and shafts are the root of the carriage; if the root is preserved, there is a carriage; if the root is lost, there is no carriage. The lowly are the root of nobility; if the root is preserved, there is rank; if the root is lost, there is no rank. This is meant to admonish lords and kings to cherish and nurture the people below and not abandon the solitary and forsaken.\n\nThey do not wish to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.\n**Commentary:** Jade is noble, and stone is lowly. To be *\"like jade\"* is to pride oneself on one’s nobility; to be *\"like stone\"* is to maintain humility. Since lords and kings take the lowly as their root, they should not wish to be lustrous like jade, priding themselves on their loftiness, but should instead be coarse like stone, preserving humility.\n\n**Chapter 40: \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao\"**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that heaven and earth attain the One to warn against the harm of pride and attachment. This chapter elucidates the interplay of reality and expediency to expound the meaning of *\"returning to the constant.\"* Only by abandoning pride can one preserve the root of nobility; only by aligning with righteousness can one employ expediency. It aims to deepen understanding of the Dao’s emptiness and thus reaffirms its harmonious use.\n\nReversal is the movement of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** *\"Reversal\"* means to turn away from the vulgar; *\"movement\"* refers to change and transformation, signifying expediency. The multitude clings to life and loses the Dao, so the sage transforms and employs expediency to turn them away from the vulgar and toward the Dao.\n\n**Annotation:** *\"Reversal aligns with the constant and accords with righteousness\"*—*\"constant\"* means enduring; *\"righteousness\"* means fitting. Now, taking the lowly as the root of the noble and the low as the foundation of the high, or using non-being for being, initially seems contrary to common sentiment but ultimately aligns with the Dao. Thus, this is called the movement of the Dao.",
      "overlap_context": "y:** *\"Lords and kings\"* are rulers. *\"Lords\"* are the ranks of the five nobles; *\"kings\"* are the lords of ten thousand chariots.

Some versions use *\"upright\"* (貞) instead of *\"norm\"* (正), but *\"upright\"* means *\"norm.\"*\n\n*\"This is how they attained it.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding meaning and introduces the following text.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said, \"One may stand with them, yet not employ expediency with them.\" The expedient Way reverses the constant and is difficult to comprehend, so he offers the analogy of the *tangdi* flower, saying its blossoms first reverse and later align—thus illustrating how the expedient Way first opposes and later accords.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies the true Way. People all despise weakness and prize strength, knowing that aggression and restlessness are the vulgar’s function. The Dao overcomes the rigid with softness and harmony, revealing that gentleness, weakness, femininity, and stillness are the Dao’s constant function. Thus it is said, \"Weakness is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nAll things under heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being.\n**Commentary:** All tangible things under heaven succeed one another through form, hence \"born of being.\" Yet when one exhausts the substance of being, it must rely on non-being. As the *Liezi* states: \"Form in motion cannot generate form but generates shadow; non-being in motion cannot generate non-being but generates being.\" Thus it is said, \"Emptiness is the root of heaven and earth; non-being is the source of the myriad things.\" This is spoken to urge beings to trace the source, recognize the root, and awaken to the Dao.\n\nSince being and non-being are thus, the real and the expedient are likewise. Hence the annotation states: \"The real in relation to the expedient is like non-being giving rise to being.\" It further says: \"The ultimate Dao is empty and tranquil, beyond all names\"—referring to the emptiness of dharmas’ nature, which does not depend on conditions. The essence of the Dao in its utmost reaches is profoundly empty, serene, and still, neither expedient nor real. How could it be named? In the true nature of dharmas, there is neither being nor non-being; affairs transcend mutual dependence. The statements \"things are born of being; being is born of non-being\" are all provisional expressions. If one knows that counting a chariot is not the chariot itself, one likewise knows that counting dharmas is not the dharmas themselves. How could there be real and expedient to speak of as generating one another? One who awakens to this principle may be said to have attained liberation.\n\n*Preface to Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Five, Concluded*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Six: \"The Superior Person Hears of the Dao\" (Chapter Forty-One)*",

      "translated_text": "The preceding chapter elucidated the two gates of the expedient and the real, which are the dynamic functions of the Dao. This chapter clarifies that the luminous Dao appears obscure, and only the superior person diligently practices it.\n\nFirst, it distinguishes the three types of persons who hear of the Dao, whose belief or rejection differs. Next, it establishes the teachings below to illuminate the path of cultivating the Dao and virtue. Finally, from \"Only the Dao\" onward, it concludes with the efficacious workings of bestowing goodness.\n\nThe superior person, upon hearing of the Dao, diligently practices it.\n*Commentary:* The person of highest wisdom, possessing deep insight and penetrating discernment, upon hearing of the Dao—whether its expedient aspect as subtle illumination or its real aspect as gentle weakness—puts it into practice without laxity. Thus, it is said they \"diligently practice it.\"\n\nThe middling person, upon hearing of the Dao, wavers between belief and disbelief.\n*Commentary:* The person of middling capacity, whose clarity and obscurity remain unresolved, upon hearing of the wondrous Dao, sometimes believes and sometimes doubts. When perceiving its clarity, they believe and uphold it; when perceiving its obscurity, they doubt and hesitate. Their resolve is not yet decisive, hence it is said they \"waver between belief and disbelief.\"\n\nThe inferior person, upon hearing of the Dao, laughs greatly at it.\n*Commentary:* The inferior person, whose understanding does not reach the principle, upon hearing of the Dao, does not believe it, deeming it empty and absurd, and thus ridicules it. This is like ceremonial caps being despised by the people of Yue, or uncut jade being rejected in the state of Chu. As *Zhuangzi* states: \"A narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao.\"\n\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.\n*Commentary:* The profound Dao is recondite and deeply unfathomable. Though luminous, it appears obscure, its principle contrary to common sentiment. The inferior person, benighted and foolish, thus laughs at it. If it were not laughed at by the inferior person, it would not be called subtle and profound; it would merely be a shallow and vulgar teaching, insufficient to be called the Dao. It is not a conventional worldly dharma, and thus is mocked by the common and foolish—precisely because it is the wondrous Dao.\n\nIt is thus established in the teachings:\n*Commentary:* \"Established\" means to set forth. Here, words are set forth to explain the superior person’s diligent practice of the Dao, the middling person’s wavering between belief and disbelief, and the inferior person’s great laughter. \"In the teachings\" refers to the following elucidations of the Dao and the like.\n\nThe luminous Dao appears obscure.\n*Commentary:* \"Luminous\" means clear and penetrating; \"obscure\" means dim and dark. The practitioner of the Dao and virtue nurtures clarity through obscurity, relinquishing form and discarding cunning, yet is in truth clear and penetrating. Thus, it is said to \"appear obscure.\" The superior person diligently practices it, appearing obscure in their clarity, while the inferior person, failing to comprehend, laughs at it. The middling person, upon first hearing of the luminous Dao, believes it and thus \"appears to uphold it,\" but upon later hearing of its obscurity, doubts it and thus \"appears to abandon it.\"\n\nAdvancing in the Dao appears as retreat.\n*Commentary:* The person advancing in the Dao has no arising thoughts within and forgets all external affairs. Their merit and fame diminish daily, and great accomplishment appears incomplete. The inferior person, observing this, sees it as akin to retreat and failure.\n\nThe level Dao appears uneven.\n*Commentary:* \"Level\" means even and smooth; \"uneven\" refers to irregularities in silk. The person whose mind is clear and tranquil, free from dust and desire, is open and even, without boundaries among things, yet outwardly appears like silk with knots and flaws.\n\nSupreme virtue appears as a valley.\n*Commentary:* The diligent practitioner is called a person of supreme virtue. Their virtue is fully manifest, and being fully manifest, it contains and embraces all things. Thus, it is said to \"appear as a valley.\"\n\nGreat purity appears sullied.\n*Commentary:* \"Purity\" means untainted; \"sullied\" means defiled. The one who attains the untainted Dao conceals their traces and mingles with the dust, hence is said to \"appear sullied,\" yet in truth remains purely untainted, uniquely whole and complete.\n\nVast virtue appears insufficient.\n*Commentary:* The perfected person’s virtue extends to all without exception. Yet, abiding in softness and practicing humility, they always appear insufficient. As the *Records of the Historian* states: \"A skilled merchant deeply conceals their wealth, appearing empty; the noble person of abundant virtue appears foolish.\" Thus, it appears foolish and insufficient.\n\nEstablished virtue appears as theft.\n*Commentary:* \"Established\" means to erect; \"theft\" refers to stealing. The person who establishes hidden virtue practices secretly and cultivates in obscurity, as if fearing discovery, like one who has been robbed. Thus, it is said to \"appear as theft.\"\n\nAuthentic reality appears altered.\n*Commentary:* \"Authentic\" means pure and unified; \"altered\" means changed. The practitioner of the Dao and virtue possesses virtue that is pure and without pretense, yet appears as if subject to change, flowing with things and harmonizing with their brilliance.\n\nGreat squareness has no corners.\n*Commentary:* \"Squareness\" means uprightness; \"corners\" means angles. To hone one’s reputation and establish integrity, creating edges and corners, is the way of those who seek to teach others—it is not the way of the person of great squareness. Unaffected by grinding, unstained by black dye, this is great squareness. Yet, it can harmonize with brilliance and mingle with the dust, without setting itself apart. Thus, it is said that \"great squareness has no corners.\"\n\nThe great vessel is late in completion.\n*Commentary:* That which fulfills all uses is called a vessel. A vessel completed late can become great. Thus, the superior person diligently practices, accumulating merit to attain realization, achieving it gradually, not in a single morning or evening. Hence, it is said to be \"late in completion.\"\n\nThe great sound is rarely heard.\n*Commentary:* The Dao can respond to all sounds—this is the great sound. Yet, when listened for, it has no sound—this is the rare sound. By analogy, the sage expounds the One Vehicle, and the Dharma sound pervades all, responding only when there is resonance. Thus, it is said to be \"rarely heard.\"\n\nThe great image has no form.\n*Commentary:* Those who cling to form and instruments are confined to one direction. Only the Dao of the great image, fundamentally without form or substance, responds to stimuli and can manifest all forms. Thus, it is said that \"the great image has no form.\"\n\nThe Dao is hidden and without name.\n*Commentary:* When considering its pervasive generation, it is forcibly called the Dao; when forgetting its function, it is hidden and nameless. Seeking to inscribe its essence with a name, yet its wondrous root is without form, thus its essence cannot be named. Hence, it is said that \"the Dao is hidden and without name.\"\n\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the efficacious workings of the Dao. \"Only\" means singular; \"bestowing\" means giving. It sighs in admiration that though this Dao is nameless and without form, without sound or image, it alone can distribute qi and effect transformation, bestowing upon and completing the myriad things. Thus, it is said to be \"good at bestowing and completing.\"\n\n*Chapter Forty-Two: \"The Dao Gives Birth to One\"*\nThe preceding chapter clarified the Dao heard by the three types of persons, which gives birth to the myriad things. This chapter elucidates the origin of the generation and transformation of the myriad things, which necessarily relies on the three qi. First, it clarifies that the harmonious qi is gentle and weak, enabling the myriad things to embrace it and thereby attain harmony.",

      "translated_text": "Next, it states \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy,\" admonishing kings and dukes to abide in humility. It concludes with \"the strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end,\" demonstrating the origin of cultivation and learning.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\n\n*Commentary:* The Dao is the divine source of utmost emptiness; the One is the essence of harmonious qi. \"Gives birth\" means to move and emerge. It speaks of the Dao moving forth harmonious qi to give life to things. Yet the principle of responsive transformation is not yet complete, so it further generates yang qi. Accumulating yang qi to form the One, this is called the Two. Pure yang cannot further generate yin qi, so accumulating yin to form the Two, this is called the Three. \"Gives birth to the myriad things\" means that when yin and yang intermingle in harmony and the harmonious qi transforms into purity, it universally generates the ten thousand beings. This clarifies the meaning of the Dao’s efficacious bestowal and life-giving completion.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the harmonious qi.\n\n*Commentary:* It speaks of the birth of things, which, having relied on the harmonious qi of yin and yang to attain completion, must bear yin qi, embrace yang qi, and cherish the harmonious qi to maintain softness and harmony. Thus, the Broadly Accomplished Master told the Yellow Emperor, \"I guard the One and embrace harmony, so I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years without my form ever declining.\" From this, we know that the primal qi of harmonious balance is what the multitude of beings depend upon. Laozi presents this to show that since humans are endowed with harmonious qi at birth, qi is the root of life, and people should therefore abide in softness and gentleness, embracing weakness to preserve their root.\n\nWhat people detest are only \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy,\" yet kings and dukes take these as their titles.\n\n*Commentary:* Harmonious qi is soft and weak, the root of life. Thus, it cites kings and dukes practicing humility to reinforce this root. \"Orphaned, widowed, and unworthy\" are inauspicious names, not honorific titles, and are what people detest. Yet kings and dukes take them as their titles—this is the intent of humility. Kings and dukes are the leaders of moral transformation, upon whom the survival or demise of the realm depends. All under heaven look to them. If they do not esteem humility and softness to stabilize the altars of state, the people will not turn to them. Thus, humility and softness are the foundation for achieving towering merit.\n\nTherefore, things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Therefore\" continues from the above. \"Diminished\" means to belittle oneself. It speaks of kings and dukes calling themselves \"orphaned, widowed, and unworthy\" to diminish themselves, thereby causing the people to joyfully support, respect, and serve them, resulting in gain. \"Augmented yet lose\" refers to kings and dukes who, valuing and indulging themselves, become arrogant in their high position, causing the people below to disperse and thus incur loss. As the *Book of Documents* says, \"Arrogance invites loss; humility receives gain\"—this is what it means.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach as my principle.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Others\" refers to rulers, who are the heads of governance and education, upon whom the customs of a state depend, transforming through the influence of one person. Thus, Laozi declares: If a ruler wishes to implement verbal instruction to transform the people, they must employ my principle of emptiness, softness, and weakness to teach them.\n\nThe strong and overbearing do not meet their natural end.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Strong and overbearing\" refers to those who are violent and obstinate. Such violent individuals lose the essentials of nurturing life and forfeit their heavenly mandate, failing to meet their natural end. The Perfected Immortal Yan said, \"The strong Qin perished through tyranny; the great Han prospered through harmony and compliance.\" The strong and overbearing lose the Dao; the rigid and martial lose their spirit. Once the master of life retreats, how can they long endure? The annotation states: \"Moving in opposition to things, things may strike back.\" \"Opposition\" means resistance. \"Things strike back\" refers to the *Yi Jing*’s *Yi* hexagram, top nine line, which says, \"No one augments them; someone strikes them.\"\n\nI shall take this as the father of teaching.",

This chapter elucidates the origin of the generation and transformation of the myriad things, which necessarily relies on the three qi. First, it clarifies that the harmonious qi is gentle and weak, enabling the myriad things to embrace it and thereby attain harmony.",

      "translated_text": "Here the essence of cultivation and learning is distilled. Lord Lao cites the demise of the strong and overbearing as a warning, and the preservation of the supple and weak as an encouragement. Calling this the \"father of teaching\" means that, just as the father is the root of the child, I shall take this teaching of suppleness as the foundation of all teachings—like a father to his children, hence \"father of teaching.\"\n\n**Chapter 43: The Softest in the World**\nThe previous chapter revealed how beings, turning their backs on the Dao and acting with violence, fail to meet their natural end. This chapter instructs people to rectify their nature through suppleness, for in cultivating it, one merges with the Dao. Though their paths differ, their principles converge, returning to the same end. It begins by setting forth the inherent suppleness of the Dao’s nature, for if one attains it but then loses it, the fault lies in becoming rigid and strong. The passage from \"I therefore know\" onward clarifies the Dao of non-action, which brings boundless benefit, surpassing all other teachings.\n\nThe softest in the world rides forth and masters the hardest in the world.\n*Commentary:* The true nature of humanity is originally pure and clear, with harmonious qi dwelling within—this is the softest. But if one races after desires, becoming stained by worldly dust and lured by sounds and sights, the true nature scatters, becoming the hardest. \"Nothingness enters where there is no gap.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Nothingness\" means that when one awakens to the illusory nature of all dharmas and realizes their emptiness, one returns to the true nature and unites with the Dao, entering the gapless. \"Gapless\" is the Dao. \"Entering\" means merging with the Dao. To say the Dao is \"gapless\" is to clarify that the nature of the Dao is pure and still, utterly boundless, without the slightest crevice.\n\nI therefore know the benefit of non-action.\n*Commentary:* Here, \"I\" is Lord Lao speaking. This chapter also universally admonishes rulers to govern the world through non-action. Lord Lao says: I see that the true nature of beings is supple and weak, yet when they race and compete, they become utterly rigid. If they could illuminate their minds and circumstances, realizing that all is empty, they would merge with the Dao. Thus, I know that governing body and state through purity and non-action brings benefit to all. By analogy, the teachings of action cannot compare to the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world can match it.\n*Commentary:* The supreme Dao is wordless, yet all things are born through it. The sage acts not, yet transforms through purity. Thus, it does not wait for words to become teaching. \"Few in the world can match it\" means that among the nine schools and hundred lineages, few can equal the teaching of non-action. It also means that unless one is a ruler who embodies the Dao, none can attain it—hence, it is called \"rare.\"\n\n**Chapter 44: Name or Self—Which is Closer?**\nThe previous chapter showed how the true nature, when supple, becomes rigid through racing and competition. This chapter clarifies the closeness or distance of fame and wealth, and how attachment to hoarding brings calamity. The first three lines pose questions about gain and loss; the next two detail the causes of disaster. The final \"knowing contentment\" urges one to abide by one’s lot, ensuring longevity.\n\nName or self—which is closer?\n*Commentary:* This compares name with self. \"Which\" means \"who.\" The question asks: Between striving for fame and preserving life, which aligns with the way of preserving truth and longevity? It laments that people of this age cannot forget fame to preserve the self.\n\nSelf or wealth—which is more?\n*Commentary:* \"More\" implies what is more valuable. Between self and wealth, which is more worthy of esteem? This is said to awaken one to the greater value of the self, so that one does not prize wealth. *Annotation:* \"Cast aside jade, shatter pearls\" is a phrase from the *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters.\n\nGain or loss—which brings suffering?\n*Commentary:* This summarizes the two questions above: between gaining fame and wealth or losing them, which brings suffering? Gaining fame and wealth means losing the self; preserving the self means losing fame and wealth. Their outcomes are clearly distinct—suffering is evident. Yet deluded beings fail to perceive this first, so the following text elaborates.\n\nThus, excessive love incurs great cost; excessive hoarding invites heavy loss.\n*Commentary:* These two lines answer the previous questions. \"Excessive love incurs great cost\" responds to \"name or self—which is closer?\" \"Cost\" means loss; \"closer\" means love. Excessive love of fame distorts one’s nature, depleting the spirit. The more one loves, the greater the cost. \"Excessive hoarding invites heavy loss\" responds to \"self or wealth—which is more?\" The more one hoards, the heavier the loss. The harm of coveting jade is like holding a sword; the peril of possessing pearls is like embracing a wall. The tombs in the *Book of Songs* were robbed for their pearls—let the ruin brought by wealth serve as a profound warning.\n\nKnowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop averts danger—thus one may endure long.\n*Commentary:* \"Disgrace\" means harm and entanglement; \"danger\" means peril and ruin. Not pursuing fame is knowing contentment; not amassing wealth is knowing when to stop. Knowing contentment ensures one’s name matches reality without excess. Knowing when to stop ensures one does not hoard wealth, avoiding the harm of greed. Free from disgrace and peril, one may long endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Great Perfection Seems Lacking**\nThe previous chapter showed how self and wealth differ in closeness, and how attachment to hoarding brings calamity. This chapter teaches that caution in fullness is like deficiency, so its use never exhausts. The first seven lines establish the model for conduct; the next two clarify the superiority of stillness over restlessness. The final \"purity and stillness\" concludes that purity and stillness can rectify the world.\n\nGreat perfection seems lacking, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n*Commentary:* For all learners, when their merit and conduct reach great perfection and all virtues are complete, they must remain humble and forgetful, as if flawed. Then their abilities will never be exhausted. The ruler who embodies the Dao in great perfection is likewise: his achievements equal the creative power of heaven and earth, his virtue matches the illumination of sun and moon. His accomplishments are vast—hence \"great perfection.\" Yet he does not rely on his perfection, appearing as if lacking. In this way, his use is inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n*Commentary:* \"Empty\" means vacuous. \"Exhausted\" means depleted. This clarifies that the sage, though his emoluments and rank are full, cultivates reverence and frugality, never allowing himself to be full and overflowing—hence he seems empty and vacuous. As it is said: \"Having seems as if not having; fullness seems as if emptiness.\" Thus his application is without end or depletion.\n\nGreat straightness seems bent;\n*Commentary:* \"Straight\" means upright. \"Bent\" means crooked. The preceding four lines jointly clarify substance and function; the following three lines only present their substance, without stating their function. The text is abbreviated to reveal the meaning, and the rest may be inferred by analogy. To purify oneself while defiling others, to promote the upright while setting aside the crooked—this is petty straightness. Not clinging to right to dispute wrong, not rectifying oneself to correct others—this is great straightness. Adapting flexibly to circumstances, hence it is said to seem bent. The *Commentary* states: \"Upright yet not unrestrained\"—this is from the \"Dao Classic\" in the first scroll.\n\nGreat skill seems clumsy;\n*Commentary:* Displaying embellished craftsmanship, flaunting the marvels of compass and square—this is petty skill. Utilizing resources as they are, allowing things to achieve success naturally, without losing their proper measure—this is great skill. Without carving or cutting, its achievement unseen, it appears as if unrefined and clumsy. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Creation carves and sculpts the myriad forms yet is not considered skillful.\"\n\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\n*Commentary:* Combining metaphors and adorned phrases, knotting cords and weaving sentences—this is petty eloquence. Practicing the teaching without words, eloquently carving the myriad things, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—this is great eloquence. The ultimate word transcends words, without emphasis or suppression, like one who is halting and tongue-tied.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.\n*Commentary:* This presents an analogy to illustrate the teaching. Those who cling to completion will surely fail; those who hold to fullness will surely topple. Thus the sage’s achievements benefit the world, yet he does not appear successful—hence he seems lacking, and so his use is without flaw. Though his position is exalted above ten thousand chariots, he does not regard his rank as complete—hence he seems empty, and so he is inexhaustible. Fearing that people may not understand, he borrows the movement and stillness of yang qi to illustrate. \"Restlessness\" means movement. \"Overcomes\" means extremity. It is said: In spring and summer, yang qi emerges above the earth, and the myriad things thereby live. When yang qi’s movement reaches its extreme, it becomes cold, and cold causes the myriad things to wither and die. This clarifies that restlessness is the root of death, and excess is the source of decline. It illustrates that those whose achievements are complete yet not lacking will fail, those who hold to fullness yet are not empty will topple, and those who act with rigidity and restlessness will surely die.\n\n\"Stillness overcomes heat\" means: In autumn and winter, yang qi is still beneath the Yellow Springs. When stillness reaches its extreme, it becomes heat, and heat gives rise to harmonious qi. The myriad things thereby live, their life arising from stillness. Thus we know stillness is the root of life and also the ruler of restlessness. The analogy is taken from great completion and great fullness: by being able to seem lacking and empty, they are without flaw or exhaustion, thereby attaining life. Those who can practice non-action and stillness thereby grasp the root of life. This urges people to pursue stillness to seek life, not to lightly indulge in restlessness and hasten toward death.\n\nPurity and stillness rectify the world.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the preceding meaning. The sage observes the advance and retreat of the numinous yang qi, knowing that restlessness is the source of hastening toward death, while stillness is the root of life. Governing human affairs and nurturing the multitude of beings, he holds to the root to govern the branches, devoting himself to the Way of purity and stillness. Thus he can rectify the world.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World Follows the Dao**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified the conduct of the five great ones, broadening the gateway for cultivating learning. This chapter clarifies the three great transgressions, revealing the harms of desire. It first sets forth the benefits and harms of a world with or without the Dao, then clarifies the origins of crime and fault, and finally concludes with the virtue of knowing contentment, to caution against the calamities born of greed.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to manure the fields.\n*Commentary:* \"Retired\" means set aside. \"Manure\" means to cultivate the fields. \"When the world follows the Dao\" means governing with the Dao, practicing non-action, and transforming through it. Guarding the four frontiers, the borders are at peace, and there is no need to covet more land to burden the common people. Thus the affairs of arms and warhorses are set aside, and people can begin plowing the southern fields to cultivate their gardens.\n\nWhen the world does not follow the Dao, warhorses breed on the outskirts.\n*Commentary:* \"Outskirts\" means the border, the defensive ground between two states’ frontiers. When the world lacks rulers who employ the Dao, then the wild frontiers have unruly barbarians. Thus the military horses breed on the outskirts, meaning they remain there for a long time without returning.\n\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire;\n*Commentary:* \"Crime\" means violating the law; \"desire\" means covetousness. It is said: The crime of warhorses breeding on the outskirts arises from the ruler’s covetousness for land. Seeing land as desirable, the desire stirs, and greed arises. This is the greatest crime—hence \"no crime is greater than indulging desire.\"\n\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment;\n*Commentary:* \"Calamity\" means harm, the lack of divine protection. From what does the calamity of ruin and defeat arise? From coveting land, seeking without satiety, not knowing moderation—this causes the divine way not to protect, and thus one incurs harm. Human transgressions are not of one kind, but greed brings the greatest calamity.\n\nNo fault is greater than desiring to acquire.\n*Commentary:* \"Fault\" means misfortune. The bold in greed, their desires ever increasing, never cease once they obtain, but seek further. If they acquire by improper means, they will swiftly bring misfortune upon themselves—is this not fitting? \"Indulging desire\" means desiring what one has not yet obtained, the initial stirring of greed, a crime lighter than calamity. \"Not knowing contentment\" means obtaining yet still demanding more, a calamity heavier than crime. \"No fault is greater than desiring to acquire\" means: having already obtained what was sought, yet the desire remains insatiable—then the fault of this transgression is even greater than calamity.\n\nThus the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the meaning of the ruler who follows the Dao. It is said: The ruler who follows the Dao has no desire for expansion, does not covet land, is firmly rooted in his proper share, and knows contentment. Thus he is joyfully upheld by the world, his person secure and his state well-ordered. This contentment of knowing contentment extends even to yielding—hence it is ever content.",

      "translated_text": "The annotation states: \"Contentment in things is not true contentment; contentment in the heart is true contentment.\" True contentment means sufficiency lies in the heart, not in external things. Abiding by one’s limits and guarding one’s proper share, though little may seem much; insatiable desire, though much may still seem little.\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Venturing Forth**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when the world follows the Dao, knowing contentment brings everlasting sufficiency. This chapter elucidates that teaching without venturing forth demonstrates accomplishment through non-action.\n\nThe first two lines declare that not venturing forth enables knowledge of the world. The next two lines show that harmony among people brings the world into accord. The following two lines illustrate that the farther one ventures, the less one knows. The final four lines conclude that non-action brings transformation to fulfillment.\n\n\"Not venturing forth from the door, one knows the world.\"\n*Commentary:* The sagely ruler who embodies the Dao governs through non-action. Though his teachings do not extend beyond his door, pure virtue naturally pervades the realm—this may be called knowing the way to govern the world.\n\nAnother interpretation: When the ruler’s governance of the world is good, the response is likewise good. Thus, without the trouble of venturing forth, the world may be known. As the *Book of Changes* states: \"When a noble one speaks, if his words are good, they resonate even a thousand *li* away—how much more so with those nearby?\" This is the meaning.\n\n\"Not peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\"\n*Commentary:* When human and Heaven respond to each other, essence and *qi* intermingle. If the ruler governs with virtue, celestial patterns remain unconfused; if he violates the Five Phases, *yin* and *yang* fall into disorder. Thus the *Book of Documents* states: \"Auspicious omens bring timely rain and harmonious winds; inauspicious omens bring constant fog and errant gales.\" From this, we know that actions originate within oneself, while their signs manifest in Heaven—why wait to peer through the window to see them? As the *Book of Changes* says: \"Words and deeds are how the noble one moves Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n\"The farther one ventures, the less one knows.\"\n*Commentary:* This describes the ruler who has lost the Dao. Unable to abide in non-action and humble himself, he seeks to extend his teachings to transform others. The farther his commands reach, the more he strays from non-action, and the less he understands governance.\n\nThus the sage \"knows without going forth.\"\n*Commentary:* This reiterates that not venturing forth enables knowledge of the world. Without affairs or action, teachings do not extend beyond the door—hence \"without going forth.\" Drawing near to observe oneself, one comprehends things to come. Thus, through my non-action, people transform themselves—why wait for teachings to venture forth before calling it knowledge?\n\n\"Names without seeing.\"\n*Commentary:* This reiterates that not peering through the window enables seeing the Way of Heaven. When the crane cries, its mate responds; when stimulated, Heaven moves. From the small, one may know the great; by examining oneself, one may know others. The auspiciousness summoned depends on the person—thus the governance of Great Peace may be spoken of without seeing. Why insist on peering to name it? Hence, \"names without seeing.\"\n\n\"Accomplishes without acting.\"\n*Commentary:* This summarizes the meaning of not venturing forth and not peering. Where there is action above, there is disturbance below. Now the sage concentrates his spirit and sits in solemn silence within the court. The ruler practices non-action, the people have no affairs, households are well-provided, and the myriad transformations naturally come to fruition.\n\n**Chapter 48: Daily Advancement in Learning**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that not venturing forth and not peering enables knowledge of governance. This chapter elucidates that in learning and embodying the Dao, one reaches the state of non-action.\n\nThe first two lines demonstrate the gradual process of cultivation and forgetting. The next three lines clarify the benefits of diminishing the existent to return to the non-existent. The final four lines conclude the meaning, warning that busyness is insufficient to transform others.\n\n\"In learning, one advances daily; in embodying the Dao, one diminishes daily.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Learning\" means cultivation. \"Diminishing\" means forgetting and reducing. At the outset of cultivation, one daily seeks knowledge and experience as advancement. When advancing toward the Dao, one forgets and reduces practices and actions—why is this? In learning, one initially relies on study to understand the Dao, cultivating merit to amend faults. Ultimately, one awakens to principle and forgets words, relinquishes merit and abandons attachments. Thus the annotation states: \"Advancing in knowledge and experience is the beginning of cultivating the Dao\"—this refers to the initial stage. \"Diminishing merit and action is the gateway to awakening to the Dao\"—this refers to the final stage.\n\n\"Diminish and again diminish, to reach non-action.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Diminish\" refers to reducing the merit and actions of one who embodies the Dao. \"Again diminish\" means eliminating the mind that forgets merit and action. This entails first forgetting traces, then forgetting the mind. When both mind and traces are forgotten, one may be said to have reached the ultimate—thus arriving at non-action.\n\n\"Non-action, yet nothing is not done.\"\n*Commentary:* Where there is action, there is obstruction; where there is obstruction, there are things left undone. Now, since there is non-action, non-action means no obstruction—hence nothing is left undone. This is called harmonizing with the Dao, responding and acting universally. Thus the preceding passage states: \"The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\"\n\n\"To govern the world, one must constantly practice non-affairs.\"\n*Commentary:* This exhorts the ruler to practice non-action. \"Govern\" means to transform and guide. To transform and guide the world, one must practice non-action and engage in non-affairs. With non-affairs, the people below are not disturbed; with non-action, the hundred clans are naturally at peace. Ruling with this, what cannot be achieved? \"Constantly\" means that governing through non-action must never be departed from, even for a moment.\n\n\"When there are affairs, it is insufficient to govern the world.\"\n*Commentary:* \"Affairs\" refers to onerous policies and dense prohibitions. Harsh commands disturb the people; dense nets multiply punishments. The hundred clans are not at peace, and the four directions scatter—seeking to transform and guide them, is this not difficult? Thus, busyness is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Six, concludes.*\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Seven.*\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Mind**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that embodying the Dao entails daily diminishing, demonstrating the gateway of cultivation and forgetting.

The final two lines conclude the reason the hundred clans return to goodness, clarifying the sage’s virtue of impartial nurturance.\n\nThe sage has no constant mind, taking the hearts of the hundred clans as his own heart.\n*Commentary:* The sage is empty and forgetful; things move him to respond. Response necessarily follows stimulus, and since stimuli are not uniform, his responses have no constant mind. Though his mind has no constancy, his intent remains in compassionate salvation. The hundred clans possess hearts of unbelief and ungoodness, so he blends his heart with theirs to transform and guide them—hence it is said he has no constant mind.\n\nThose who are good, I treat with goodness,\n*Commentary:* This is the principle of response and stimulus. *I* refers to the sage. Those who are good are hearts turned toward the correct Dao; the sage encourages them to advance in cultivation, bringing their conduct to fruition so that they attain the great goodness of forgetting goodness.\n\nThose who are not good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue becomes goodness.\n*Commentary:* The not-good are those whose habits deepen delusion, who trust in evil and turn from the Dao; the sage also draws them with the good Dao. *Virtue becomes goodness* means they are transformed by the sage’s virtue to become good.\n\nThose who are trustworthy, I trust,\n*Commentary:* Trustworthy means hearing the Dao and practicing it diligently, with no doubt or attachment; the sage responds with utmost sincerity, affirming their goodness so that they attain profound trust.\n\nThose who are untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue becomes trustworthiness.\n*Commentary:* Untrustworthy refers to the stubborn and rebellious who oppose the teachings; the sage also transforms them with impartial, correct trust, so that they are transformed by the sage’s virtue to abandon falsity and return to trust. Hence it is said *virtue becomes trustworthiness.*\n\nThe sage in the world is ever vigilant, blending his heart with the world.\n*Commentary:* This clarifies how the sage blends with the world while employing the heart-mind. *Vigilant* means diligent and concerned. The sage, governing the world and overseeing all within the four seas, fears that sentient beings will not return to goodness and trust, so he is ever vigilant for the world. Since the hundred clans cannot yet trust and be good, the sage blends with them and employs his heart—hence it is said he blends his heart with the world.\n\nThe hundred clans all fix their ears and eyes [upon him],\n*Commentary:* When the hundred clans are transformed by the sage’s virtue to return to goodness, they observe customs with pure simplicity, so they all turn their ears and eyes to observe and listen, taking the sage as their model.\n\nThe sage treats them all as children.\n*Commentary:* Since the hundred clans fix their ears and eyes to observe and listen to the sage, the sage regards them as a compassionate mother does her infant—hence it is said he treats them all as children. Another interpretation: The hundred clans have discriminating minds; the sage transforms them to uniformly follow goodness, making them like infants without discrimination.\n\n**Chapter 50: Emerging from Life, Entering Death**\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that the sage has no fixed mind, blending his heart to respond to goodness and trust. This chapter elucidates emerging from life and entering death, revealing the gateway to skillfully guarding against affliction and entanglement.\n\nThe first five lines mark those who dwell in timeliness and follow what is fitting. The next five lines clarify the deeply transformed and those who seek transformation. The final eight lines conclude the practice of skillful guarding, pointing to the gateway of long life and enduring vision.\n\nEmerging from life, entering death.\n*Commentary:* Those who thoroughly comprehend life and death do not cling to life—this is called *emerging from life.* Those who are deluded and attached to self and others, moving toward the realm of death—this is called *entering death.* This marks the chapter’s theme.\n\nOf those who live, thirteen in ten [follow this way],\n*Commentary:* *Those* refers to types. This broadly discusses sentient beings who can dwell in the principle of life, not prizing themselves, adapting to their time of coming, and harboring no attachments. Of such, broadly speaking, three in ten follow this way. This means those who follow principle are few, while those who oppose it are many.\n\nOf those who die, thirteen in ten [follow this way].\n*Commentary:* This also broadly discusses those who understand the way of death, not resisting transformation, adapting to their departure as fitting, and harboring no fear. Of such, three in ten also follow this way.\n\nOf those who in life move toward the realm of death, thirteen in ten [follow this way].\n*Commentary:* This explains those who are deluded and attached, the types who lose the principle of nurturing life. Though people desire to cultivate life, they cannot comprehend it; their actions lead them to the realm of death. Having lost the principle of nurturing life and deviated from the way of following death, of such, three in ten also follow this way.\n\nWhy is this?\n*Commentary:* This poses the question of why sentient beings move toward the realm of death.\n\nBecause of their excessive clinging to life.\n*Commentary:* This answers directly: Those who move toward the realm of death do so because they are mired in contrivance, drowning in emotion and indulging desire, excessively nurturing themselves to preserve life. Their nurturance is too excessive, so their actions lead them to the realm of death.\n\nNow, I have heard that those who skillfully guard life\n*Commentary:* *Guard* means protect. Those who skillfully protect life with the Dao profoundly observe life’s root, which is originally pure and still. They forget life in life, not allowing emotions and desires to disturb their harmony, nurturing their nature only with emptiness and tranquility. Nothing can harm them—hence they are called *those who skillfully guard life.*\n\nWhen traveling by land, they do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by weapons.\n*Commentary:* *Encounter* means an unplanned meeting.

      "translated_text": "The *Erya* states: \"Its form resembles a wild ox, with a single horn, weighing a thousand *jin*.\" Those who skillfully guard life do not harbor harmful intentions toward other beings. Thus, when traveling by land, they do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by weapons. For tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons likewise lack any intent to harm. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades.\n\n*Commentary:* The preceding passage clarifies that those who skillfully guard life harbor no harmful intentions within, and thus do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers externally. Here, it further explains that even if they were to encounter such dangers, these would lack any intent to harm. Naturally, there would be no place for them to apply their claws, horns, or blades. From this, we know that those who forget their emotions toward external things may tame and befriend seabirds on the shore or lead land beasts by a tether to wander freely—how much less could harm come to them? Thus, it does not occur.\n\nWhy is this so?\n*Commentary:* This asks why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons—things that harm people—do not thrust their claws, horns, or blades, leaving no place for their weapons to lodge. It poses this question to enlighten others. The reason is that they have no ground of death.\n\n*Commentary:* This is the direct answer. Those who perceive themselves as substantial are burdened; those who excessively indulge in life’s nurturance invite death. Now, those who skillfully guard life illuminate the emptiness of dharmic nature and awaken to the illusory nature of form. Thus, they forget life in life and avoid the excesses of over-nurturance. Without self-interest, they follow transformation, and so there is no ground of death for them to inhabit. Since their minds harbor no ground of death, how could tigers, rhinoceroses, or weapons harm them?\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Them Life**\nThe preceding chapter expounded on emerging from life and entering death, revealing the gateway to transcending suffering and entanglement. This chapter clarifies how the Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, without domination yet naturally honored. It begins by praising the wondrous origin’s responsive efficacy in generating and completing. Next, it explains why all things revere and honor the Dao and virtue. Thus, the Dao gives them life, and it further extols the merit of nurturance.\n\n\"Gives them life yet does not possess\"—this concludes by praising the virtue of forgetting merit.\n\nThe Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\n*Commentary:* \"The Dao gives them life\" means that the natural, harmonious qi shapes and refines the myriad things, enabling their existence—hence, the Dao gives them life. The *Annotation* states: \"The wondrous origin’s dynamic function descends harmonious qi.\" The wondrous origin is the Dao. The supreme Dao descends qi as the root of all things, thus called the wondrous origin. \"Virtue nurtures them\"—virtue means attainment; nurture means cultivation. When the myriad things attain the Dao’s function and can cultivate their forms, this nurturance is condensed into the term \"virtue,\" hence \"virtue nurtures them.\"\n\nThings take form; circumstances complete them.\n*Commentary:* The Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, allowing the ten thousand kinds to flow into form—hence, \"things take form.\" The *Annotation* states: \"Qian’s knowing and Kun’s acting manifest form and position.\" The *Appended Sayings* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"Qian knows the great beginning; Kun acts to complete things.\" Heaven and earth become form; above and below become position. These are all the Dao’s work, entrusted to Qian and Kun for their function. \"Circumstances complete them\"—the Dao provides the myriad things with the timing of heaven and the advantages of earth, the circumstances of yin and yang, and things rely on these to reach completion—hence, \"circumstances complete them.\"\n\nThus, the myriad things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\n*Commentary:* Since the Dao and virtue are the merit of giving life and nurturance, all living beings universally revere the Dao and honor virtue. This urges all beings to return to the root and venerate the Dao.\n\nThe Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor—none confer rank upon them, yet they are eternally natural.\n*Commentary:* In the world, those who are revered and honored must receive rank from a ruler before being esteemed. Now, the Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor arise from their life-giving and nurturing merit bestowed upon things. Thus, things revere and honor them—not through conferred rank but eternally and naturally.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them.\n*Commentary:* This reiterates the opening chapter’s meaning of the Dao giving life. Beginning is giving life; nurturing is cultivation.\n\nIt rears and raises them,\n*Commentary:* Advancement is rearing; fostering is raising.\n\ncompletes and ripens them,\n*Commentary:* Assisting is completion; fulfillment is ripening.\n\nnurtures and shelters them.\n*Commentary:* Provision is nurturance; protection is shelter. These eight terms all refer to the Dao and virtue’s functions, which is why the myriad things revere and honor them.\n\nGives them life yet does not possess,\n*Commentary:* The Dao gives life to the myriad things yet does not perceive any life to claim—this is the meaning of forgetting life, concluding the above passage on the Dao giving life.\n\nacts yet does not rely,\n*Commentary:* Virtue’s nurturance does not perceive any thing to act upon, nor does it rely on its merit—this concludes the above passage on virtue’s nurturance.\n\nrears yet does not dominate.\n*Commentary:* Through the Dao and virtue, one forgets the merit of giving life and nurturance. Thus, though presiding over the myriad things, rearing, raising, completing, and ripening them, one does not act as their dominator or demand recompense from them. This urges rulers to emulate the Dao’s giving life and nurturance while forgetting their merit.\n\nThis is called profound virtue.\n*Commentary:* This praises the virtue of forgetting merit. Profound means deep and unfathomable. Though the great Dao can give life and nurture, it ultimately does not rely on or dominate. Its virtue is universally bestowed, yet its name does not advance—is this not a deep and unfathomable virtue?\n\n**Chapter 52: The World Has a Beginning**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how the Dao gives life and virtue nurtures, without domination yet naturally honored. This chapter explains guarding the mother to preserve the child, returning to clarity to avoid bodily misfortune. It begins with seven lines on the life-giving origin, urging one to know the child and guard the mother. Next, six lines warn against excessive desire, closing the senses and shutting the gates. The final six lines praise the merit of cultivation and realization, concluding with the practice of embracing constancy.\n\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the world’s mother.\n*Commentary:* Qi is the beginning; life is the mother. The Dao and virtue, with harmonious and wondrous qi, give life to the myriad things. Things receive life as a child does from its mother—hence, \"serves as the world’s mother.\" Though the mother differs from the Dao’s qi, its transformative influence remains constant. Thus, the preceding chapter states: \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the text urges one to know the source and recognize the root, to guard the mother and preserve the child. Having attained the mother, one thereby knows the child. *Commentary:* Once a person has obtained the harmonious qi, flourishing and nurturing it as the mother, they should recognize that their body is the child of this harmonious qi. Having known the child, one then guards the mother, and thus remains free from peril until death. *Commentary:* Once a person knows their body is the child of the Dao’s qi, born from harmonious qi, they should guard the Dao’s purity, avoiding contamination by false dust, cherishing qi and nurturing spirit so they do not scatter. Humans are born from the Dao and look to it as their root; now, returning to the Dao and guarding the mother, it is said one \"again guards it.\" \"Free from peril until death\" means that if one can constantly be without desire and return to the Dao, they may complete their natural lifespan without danger.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates, and one will not toil for a lifetime. *Commentary:* This describes the practice of cutting off desire and guarding the mother. \"Openings\" refers to pleasure—ears and eyes take delight in sounds and sights, nose and mouth in fragrances and flavors, each of the six senses having its own pleasures. \"Gates\" denote the means of entry and exit, the pathways through which the senses and external realms interact. If one blocks the senses’ delight in seeing and hearing, the gate of misfortune closes. With the gate of misfortune closed, one will not toil for a lifetime. Thus it is said, \"one will not toil for a lifetime.\"\n\nOpen the openings, aid one’s affairs, and one will be beyond saving for a lifetime. *Commentary:* This describes the conduct of one who loses the Dao. Opening the gates of seeing and hearing, assisting in the pursuit of pleasure, misfortune and calamity will only increase, so that one cannot be saved for a lifetime.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity. *Commentary:* This points to the source of preventing misfortune. When evil omens arise, one must detect even the slightest signs. Thus, in times of worry, regret, or adversity, one should be attentive to the smallest details. Those who guard the mother should prevent harm at its inception and address disorder before it arises. One who can do this may be called clear-sighted.\n\nGuarding softness is called strength. *Commentary:* One who practices softness and weakness, dwelling in a place of non-contention, cannot be overcome by others. In the function of the Dao, one who can do this may be called strong.\n\nUse its light, return to its clarity. *Commentary:* Light shines outward and is ever-active; clarity shines inward and is ever-still. Through seeing the small and guarding softness, one attains clarity. Being strong without arrogance, clear yet employing strength, though one uses light to shine outward, one returns to inner clarity. This further explains the meaning of seeing the small and guarding softness, urging one to cease outward focus and return inward. Thus it is said, \"return to its clarity.\"\n\nLeave no misfortune for the self—this is called embracing constancy. *Commentary:* \"Leave\" means to bestow; \"misfortune\" means calamity. Using light to illuminate things without attachment, returning to guard inner clarity without self-aggrandizement, guarding the mother and preserving the child, reflecting back to the source, one naturally avoids misfortune and calamity. \"This is called embracing constancy\" means that to act in concealment is to embrace. One who can perceive subtle signs to avoid harm, guard softness while containing clarity, and practice such conduct, embraces the true and constant Dao by knowing the child and guarding the mother.\n\n**Chapter 53: If I Were Suddenly to Have Knowledge**\n\nThe previous chapter clarified guarding the mother to preserve the child, aiming to return to clarity without leaving misfortune for the self. This chapter explains that if one were suddenly to employ knowledge, walking the Dao would involve fear of arbitrary action. The first three lines show that having knowledge deviates from the Dao. The next two lines demonstrate that the Dao is upright while people are perverse. The following seven lines reveal the harms born of knowledge. The final two lines lament the way of thieves and boasters, serving as a warning.\n\nIf I were suddenly to have knowledge, walking the great Dao, I would only fear arbitrary action. *Commentary:* \"If I\" is a hypothetical phrase used by Laozi. \"Suddenly\" describes the appearance of having knowledge. The Dao does not rely on knowledge to overcome others; if one wishes to walk the Dao through knowledge, Laozi, fearing its obscuring effects, declares: If I were suddenly to pride myself on having knowledge and wished to practice the great Dao of non-action in the world, having knowledge would deviate from the Dao, losing the transformative influence of non-action and purity. Whatever one arbitrarily does would harm others, which is deeply to be feared.\n\nThe great Dao is very level, yet the people prefer byways. *Commentary:* \"Level\" means flat and easy. \"Byways\" are crooked and expedient paths. The great Dao is smooth and effortless, yet people prefer to take devious shortcuts. The transformative power of the great Dao values non-action and non-interference, which is effortless. Yet those who govern cannot rest their minds in desirelessness and instead engage in mental labor to address affairs. Though they initially prefer byways seeking expediency, they ultimately lose the Dao and disrupt harmony. Thus it is said, \"the people greatly prefer byways.\"\n\nThe court is excessively adorned, *Commentary:* \"Adorned\" means managed. Those who prefer byways do not esteem the transformative power of non-action but instead take action as governance. Though they claim to manage extensively, action harms through cunning and deceit. Thus, exalting worthies and priding oneself on knowledge breeds artifice and falsehood. *Another interpretation:* The court is embellished with towering halls and carved beams, hence \"excessively adorned.\"\n\nThe fields are overgrown, *Commentary:* \"Overgrown\" means weeds proliferate. Excessive cunning and idle consumption lead to the neglect of agriculture. Without the bounty of fine harvests, how can one hope for granaries as full as hills?\n\nThe granaries are very empty. *Commentary:* When the year is abundant, granaries are full; when agriculture is abandoned, granaries are empty—this is the natural principle.\n\nWearing embroidered silks, *Commentary:* Blue and red are \"embroidery\"; colored silk is \"brocade.\" This refers to valuing ornamentation over substance.\n\nCarrying sharp swords, *Commentary:* Sharp swords represent military preparedness. Civil virtue is the instrument of governance, while military achievement is its auxiliary. Civil virtue is fundamental; military power is secondary. Now, if one focuses solely on military affairs, this is abandoning the root to exalt the branch.\n\nSated with food and drink, *Commentary:* \"Sated\" refers to indulgence in food and drink.",

      "translated_text": "Such lavish abundance in the kitchens, surfeited with rich and rare delicacies—when those above possess an excess of jade-like viands, those below suffer the peril of cold and hunger.\n\nWealth and goods overflow.\n*Commentary:* \"Wealth and goods\" refer to money, silks, pearls, jade, and the like. \"Overflow\" means amassing through heavy exactions. The lesser learning prizes non-greed as treasure, yet one merely seeks to hoard wealth, ensnaring the foolish. This is called \"thievish boasting\"—how can it be the Way!\n\n*Commentary:* To take by unjust means is theft; to flaunt what one possesses is boasting. Moreover, to levy head taxes and gather like dust in a dustpan, taking from those who lack, indulging desire while squandering, and arrogantly parading one’s surplus—is this not rightly called theft? Such conduct is not the Way I would follow.\n\n*Also:* The particle \"zai\" expresses lament and sorrow.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Establishing Goodness**\nThe preceding chapter clarified how rulers who favor byways resemble thievish boasters, acting contrary to the Way. This chapter elucidates how rulers who establish goodness endure unshaken and long abide.\n\nIt begins by declaring the benefits of establishing a state through the Way and cultivating the self. Next, it explains the method of observing the self, the household, and so on, by starting with the self. Finally, \"How do I know?\" concludes with a sigh, affirming the evidence of wisdom’s illumination.\n\nOne who establishes goodness cannot be uprooted.\n*Commentary:* \"Establishes\" means to found; \"cannot be uprooted\" means it cannot be overthrown. If a ruler is adept at founding the state upon the Way and establishing its root, following the people’s non-action and entrusting transformation to the multitudes, then, molding them with purity and simplicity and cultivating their customs and reputation, he ensures that their exemplary conduct inspires trust. Delighted, the people willingly follow without weariness. Thus, his achievements and enterprise take deep root, and all directions turn toward his virtue. This is what is meant by \"establishing goodness\"—how could it be overthrown?\n\nOne who embraces goodness cannot be parted from it.\n*Commentary:* \"Embraces\" means to guard; \"parted\" means to separate. One who skillfully embraces the people with the Way moves, and they joyfully follow—how could they be parted? Moreover, where fine food is found, even passing travelers pause—how much more so with the Dao and virtue? When one employs them to govern things, all things naturally turn toward them.\n\nDescendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n*Commentary:* \"Sacrifice\" means to offer; \"descendants\" refers to later generations, meaning that posterity offers rites to their ancestors. The *Commentary* states: If a ruler’s merit extends to posterity through the Way and virtue, people cherish the sweet pear even in its absence—how much more his descendants? Kings ancestralize merit and enfeoff virtue. Thus, the rise of the Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by Kings Wen and Wu. The Zhou’s sacrifices included the suburban rites for Hou Ji and the ancestral rites for King Wen. Though the dynasty’s divined span was thirty generations and its years seven hundred, and though the ancestral tablets of abandoned temples overflowed beyond the temple, the suburban and ancestral sacrifices for Hou Ji and King Wen never ceased.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its attainment is true.\n*Commentary:* The following explains that little cultivation yields little proof, and much learning yields much attainment. Thus, \"cultivate it in the self\" means cultivating within one’s person; \"cultivate it in the household\" means cultivating within one’s family. Beginning with the self and extending to the world, the pattern may be inferred. One who establishes goodness perceives the true nature clearly. The true nature is pure and tranquil, free from falsity and杂. When falsity and杂 are exhausted, virtue becomes truly pure.\n\nCultivate it in the household, and its virtue overflows.\n*Commentary:* Cultivating the Way within the household brings harmony above and below. Extending the cultivation of the self to the household, its virtue overflows with blessing. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says, \"The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant fortune.\"\n\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures.\n*Commentary:* According to the *Rites of Zhou*, a village consists of 2,500 households. If an entire village cultivates the Way, rites and propriety flourish, and superiors and inferiors maintain proper order. Neighbors live side by side without partiality toward kin. If only one household cultivates the Way, its virtue remains limited; when an entire village does so, its virtue endures.\n\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds.\n*Commentary:* Cultivating the Way within the state transforms customs and shifts prevailing winds, returning to purity and reverting to simplicity. Without bias toward the near, cultivating the Way in one village is still insufficient; when the entire state does so, virtue abounds.\n\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue is universal.\n*Commentary:* \"Universal\" means all-pervading. When the people return to sincerity, it is through the ruler’s transformation. Cultivating it in the ancestral temple, virtue flows beyond the seas. This occurs when one rectifies the self within, transforming without words and governing without instruction. The response of those below to those above is like an echo answering a sound. When virtue leaves nothing untouched, it is truly universal.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self.\n*Commentary:* \"Observe\" means to examine and perceive. The *Commentary* states: By the method of cultivating the self, observe the self. One who attains purity and tranquility perceives the true aspect of the self—originally pure and tranquil, unstained by worldly dust. Removing all views of existence, when the view of existence is dispelled, even emptiness is seen as empty. Abandoning both extremes at once, one returns to the Middle Way. This may be called purity and tranquility, attaining the true.\n\nObserve the household through the household.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the household, observe the household. When the household is harmonious, blessings and goodness overflow.\n\nObserve the village through the village.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the village, observe the village. When the people of the village all cultivate the Way, superiors and inferiors maintain proper order. As the transformative influence gradually spreads, virtue endures.\n\nObserve the state through the state.\n*Commentary:* By the method of cultivating the state, observe the state. When the people of the state all cultivate the Way, diligent and frugal, virtue abounds.\n\nObserve the world through the world.\n*Commentary:* To observe the world through the world—what else is there to observe? One merely observes the self. When the ruler is pure and tranquil, governing through non-action and the transformative power of the Way, establishing goodness and embracing virtue, the people naturally turn toward him, and the state and its people enjoy peace.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?

      "translated_text": "This is hypothetical speech. The Old Master asks: How do I know that those who skillfully establish cannot be uprooted, those who skillfully embrace cannot be lost, and that blessings and virtue greatly increase? It is by observing the self and the like—observing from within and extending outward—that one comes to know. The *Yijing* states: \"Observe my life, observe their life,\" meaning one first observes the self and then observes others.\n\n**Chapter 55: Embracing Virtue**\nThe previous chapter clarified that the ruler who skillfully establishes enjoys unshakable and enduring existence. This chapter clarifies that the person who embraces virtue alone knows harmony and causes no harm.\n\nThe first five lines mark why one who embraces virtue does not grasp.\nThe next five lines, beginning with \"bones weak,\" clarify why one who preserves harmony does not grow hoarse.\n\nTo know harmony is to be enlightened; to manipulate qi is to be forceful.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way,\" and what is not of the Way perishes early.\n\nOne whose virtue is deeply embraced is like a newborn child.\n*Commentary:* \"Embrace\" means to hold within. It speaks of the perfected person who holds the profound depth of virtue and power within. Internally, they are preserved by virtue and power; externally, they are protected by spirit and illumination—comparable to a loving mother and her newborn child. This principle is difficult to comprehend, so it is illustrated through analogy. Thus, the innate harmony of the newborn is used to exemplify the perfected person’s complete virtue. The newborn, being the youngest of infants, is chosen because it has no discriminating mind and harbors no intention to harm.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting them, fierce beasts do not seize them, birds of prey do not strike them.\n*Commentary:* This explains the perfected person’s complete virtue. Poisonous creatures include wasps and scorpions; fierce beasts include tigers and rhinoceroses; birds of prey include eagles and hawks. \"Sting\" refers to injecting venom with the tail’s tip. \"Seize\" means to press down with the feet. \"Strike\" means to grasp with the talons. The perfected person’s virtue is complete within, their harmonious qi abundant and overflowing, their mind merged with the Dao. Thus, poisonous creatures cannot sting them, fierce beasts cannot seize them, and birds of prey cannot strike them—all due to the restraining power of their utmost compliance and profound virtue.\n\nTheir bones are weak and their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.\n*Commentary:* The following clarifies the newborn’s complete harmony. The newborn’s sinews and bones are soft and weak, and their grasp should not be strong, yet their clenched fists hold fast—is this not due to their undispersed harmonious qi?\n\nThey do not know the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs—such is the perfection of essence.\n*Commentary:* The female is called \"yin,\" the male \"yang.\" The organ is the source of vital energy. The newborn’s mind is free of desire, unaware of the union of yin and yang, yet the source of their contained qi moves—is this not due to the purity of their essence?\n\nThey cry all day without growing hoarse—such is the perfection of harmony.\n*Commentary:* \"Hoarse\" means the voice becomes raspy. The newborn cries all day without their voice growing hoarse—is this not due to the perfection of their harmonious qi?\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the analogy of the newborn, whose voice does not grow hoarse due to the perfection of their harmonious qi, and extends the lesson. It says that if one can be like an infant, knowing the principle of harmony and softness and cultivating it without loss, this is called knowing the true constancy of conduct.\n\nTo know constancy is to be enlightened.\n*Commentary:* One who knows the true constancy of conduct and preserves essence while cherishing qi is called enlightened.\n\nThose who understand harmony and constancy praise the beauty of shared virtue. Later, they increase life and manipulate qi, demonstrating the errors of losing the Way.\n\nTo increase life is to invite omens.\n*Commentary:* \"Omens\" signify the portents of fortune or misfortune. It speaks of those who cannot fully harmonize with the knowledge of constancy and instead pursue gains beyond their allotted share. Little do they realize that seeking beyond one’s share leads to excess, and excessive pursuit of life’s increase invites misfortune. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Always follow nature and do not increase life.\"\n\nTo manipulate qi with the mind is to be forceful.\n*Commentary:* The mind distinguishes right and wrong, while qi makes no such distinctions. Thus, following qi leads to softness and weakness, while directing it with the mind leads to forcefulness. Those who lose the Way and increase life employ the mind to manipulate qi, and when qi is controlled by the mind, this is called forcefulness. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi.\"\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is called \"not following the Way,\" and what is not of the Way perishes early.\n*Commentary:* This clarifies the errors of forcefulness and losing the Way. \"Prime\" means vigor and determination. \"Age\" means decline and exhaustion. All things flourish and then fade; when vigor reaches its peak, aging follows. Those who use the mind to manipulate qi and pride themselves on their strength bring about their own decline—this is called \"not following the Way.\" The Way values softness and weakness; relying on strength is contrary to the Way, so one is urged to cease early.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe previous chapter clarified that one who embraces virtue alone knows harmony and causes no harm. This chapter clarifies that the person who awakens to the Dao understands words yet clings to none.\n\nThe first two lines demonstrate the smooth flow of principle and the forgetting of words.\nThe next seven lines clarify stilling dust without being stained.\nThe lines beginning with \"This is called\" clarify that the unstained share virtue with the mysterious.\nThe lines beginning with \"Thus\" clarify that those of shared virtue cannot be slandered or praised.\n\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n*Commentary:* \"Wise\" means awakened and enlightened. \"Speak\" means to debate and explain. The profound principle is subtle, the mysterious teaching hidden and obscure. Though words may elucidate the principle, ultimately the principle is grasped and words forgotten. Thus, the enlightened grasp the principle and forget words, while the debaters cling to words and fail to awaken. Hence: \"The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\"\n\nBlock their apertures, close their gates.\n*Commentary:* As explained in the chapter \"The World Has a Beginning,\" that passage addressed restraining the six senses’ love of expression through the Dao’s purity and stillness. Here, it addresses freeing oneself from the burden of clinging to words through teaching and discernment. Without attachment to words, one blocks their apertures; not being the master of honor or disgrace, one closes their gates.\n\nBlunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their light, merge with their dust.\n*Commentary:* These four lines appeared in the previous section, \"The Dao Is Empty.\" There, they discussed the Dao’s function; here, they clarify human conduct. The two sections—upper and lower—cite the same text because it serves both the cultivation of the self and the salvation of others, so it is repeated for emphasis.",

One merely observes the self. When the ruler is pure and tranquil, governing through non-action and the transformative power of the Way, establishing goodness and embracing virtue, the people naturally turn toward him, and the state and its people enjoy peace.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?

      "translated_text": "A ruler of the Dao governs through non-action, and in this non-action there is no meddling; with no meddling there is no vexation; with no vexation the people transform of themselves, and all under Heaven attains great peace. How do I know that this is so for all under Heaven? By this.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"How do I know\"* is a rhetorical question. *\"This is so\"* means \"it is thus.\" *\"By this\"* is the answer. The Old Master poses the question: How do I know that to gain all under Heaven one must practice non-action and non-interference? The following text—*\"When all under Heaven abounds in taboos, the people grow ever poorer\"*—shows that when I practice non-action, the people transform of themselves, and this verification makes it known.\n\nWhen all under Heaven abounds in taboos of the ruler’s own making, the people grow ever poorer.\n\n*Commentary:* This further explains the failure of governance through policy. When one who rules all under Heaven fails to foster purity and stillness to transform the people, or to uphold simplicity in overseeing affairs, when policies are vexatious and nets of law are dense, the people below have nowhere to set their hands and feet. With no respite from avoiding taboos, they lose their livelihoods day by day and fall into ever greater poverty.\n\nWhen the people abound in sharp instruments, the state grows ever more benighted.\n\n*Commentary:* This explains the earlier line on employing the extraordinary in warfare. *\"Sharp instruments\"* refers to stratagems and schemes. The Way of power lies in adapting to the times, to be used only when there is no other choice. If the ruler frequently resorts to stratagems and fails to return to substance, those below will respond with deceit and cunning, hence it is said that this *\"increases the benighted chaos.\"*\n\nWhen the people abound in skills and craft, rare goods proliferate.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Skills\"* (伎) means abilities; *\"craft\"* (巧) means ingenuity. *\"Rare goods\"* refers to carved and inlaid objects, precious commodities, and luxury items. When the ruler does not esteem purity and simplicity but favors extravagance, the people emulate their superior and indulge in excess. They vie in ostentation and adornment, and such things multiply day by day.\n\nWhen laws and decrees are ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits abound.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Laws\"* are penal codes; *\"decrees\"* are administrative commands. When the ruler above cannot restrain desire to govern the people but seeks to regulate all things through pronounced laws and decrees, the people, merely seeking to avoid punishment, lose all sense of shame. Officials, in turn, steal and act corruptly, and superiors and subordinates deceive one another—hence thieves and bandits multiply.\n\nTherefore the sage declares: I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* This explains the principle of gaining all under Heaven through non-interference. *\"I\"* refers to the sage. The virtue of the sage does not esteem skills and craft; the ruler who embodies the Dao values non-action. In the practice of non-action, there are no prohibitions, and those below emulate the ruler’s non-action—hence it is said that *\"the people transform of themselves.\"*\n\nI engage in no meddling, and the people grow rich of themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* When those above impose no taxes or levies, and those below suffer no vexations, when they plow their fields and dig their wells, each household is provided for and the people are content—hence it is said that *\"the people grow rich of themselves.\"*\n\nI am fond of stillness, and the people rectify themselves.\n\n*Commentary:* Stillness is the nature of humanity at birth, the nature of Heaven. When those above cherish tranquility and are not swayed by disturbance, those below, influenced by the ruler’s virtue, follow their nature and rectify themselves.\n\nI am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.\n\n*Commentary:* When the ruler is able to inwardly preserve harmony and outwardly refrain from pursuing desires, the people, moved by this influence, naturally return to purity and simplicity.\n\n**Chapter 58: Governance of Obscurity**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies how rulers who govern through policy fail to achieve self-transformation through non-action.",

As legal restrictions proliferate, theft and disorder abound, and the people become impoverished and dispersed.\n\n**Misfortune—fortune leans upon it; fortune—misfortune lies hidden within. Who knows their limit?**\n*Commentary:* \"Misfortune—fortune leans upon it\" means that the obscure governance mentioned earlier, though deemed harmful by custom, in fact leads the people to become pure and sincere. Is this not fortune born of misfortune? \"Fortune—misfortune lies hidden within\" means that the exacting governance, though deemed beneficial by custom, instead causes things to decay and scatter. Is this not misfortune concealed within fortune and then unleashed? \"Who knows their limit?\" refers to those who lose the Dao and abandon virtue, indulging in artifice and ostentation. Fortune and misfortune cycle endlessly, their interdependence without constancy—who can fathom their ultimate end?\n\n**Is there no constancy?**\n*Commentary:* This asks whether the extremes of fortune and misfortune lack a fixed norm. Yet this arises because people fail to embody the Dao and practice non-action, instead clinging to delusion and losing their constancy.\n\n**Constancy reverts to strangeness, goodness reverts to perversity.**\n*Commentary:* This explains the origin of delusion regarding constancy. The people, confused about fortune and misfortune, fail to recognize constancy and mistake it for deceit. Unclear about goodness, they take it for ominous portents. Thus, constancy seems absent.\n\n**The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.**\n*Commentary:* This laments that the people, deluded about constancy and goodness, reverse them into strangeness and perversity. Such confusion has persisted for ages, hence it is said to have endured for long.\n\n**Thus the sage is square but does not cut,**\n*Commentary:* \"Square\" derives from constancy. This presents the sage’s virtue to encourage cultivation. The sage, in propagating the Dao and aiding the age, guides all things toward constancy. His conduct is upright and constant, and things respond by rectifying themselves—not by imposing teachings or carving things to conform to himself.\n\n**sharp but does not wound,**\n*Commentary:* \"Sharp\" means incorruptible. \"Wound\" means to defile. The sage, following his nature, remains incorruptible and naturally transforms those below. He purifies their defilement to reveal their clarity. The character for \"wound\" originally meant \"to harm\"; the sage, though sharp in conduct, does not injure others.\n\n**straight but does not extend,**\n*Commentary:* \"Extend\" means to stretch forth. The sage’s conduct is not crooked, and others naturally follow his uprightness—not because they are unrighteous, but because he does not stretch forth to straighten their crookedness.\n\n**luminous but does not dazzle.**\n*Commentary:* \"Luminous\" refers to wisdom. Though the sage possesses wisdom, he conceals it and does not display it to dazzle others. Thus, it is said he is luminous but does not dazzle.\n\nWith such sagely virtue, the people naturally become pure and follow his transformation.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**",

      "translated_text": "The preceding chapter elucidates the governance of non-action, whereby people attain purity and harmony. This chapter expounds on governing people and serving Heaven, advocating no excess but frugality. First, it establishes that in governing people and serving Heaven, nothing precedes thrift. Next, with \"only then\" below, it extends the prior meaning—this is called \"submission\"—and employs the metaphor of deep roots to illustrate the Way of longevity.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift.\n*Commentary:* \"Thrift\" means cherishing. When a ruler seeks to govern and transform his people while reverently serving the Supreme, nothing precedes the virtue of cherishing resources—this is the power of frugality. By restraining excess, sufficiency is ensured, and people are gathered. With abundant sacrificial offerings, Heaven bestows its favor upon bright virtue; thus, nothing surpasses thrift.\n\nOnly through thrift is this called early submission.\n*Commentary:* \"Only through thrift\" reiterates the above. \"Early submission\" explains the meaning of frugality and thrift. There are seven instances of such reiteration, all following this pattern. \"Only\" is an introductory particle. \"Submission\" means service. Only a ruler who practices frugality and cherishing in governing people and serving Heaven, making thrift the foundation of governance, will cause all under Heaven to submit early to his rule.\n\nEarly submission is called the accumulation of virtue.\n*Commentary:* Why do all under Heaven look up to his transformation and the realm submit to his benevolence? Because he practices restraint and frugality, the people submit early to his service—thus accumulating his virtue abundantly.\n\nWith abundant virtue, there is nothing that cannot be overcome.\n*Commentary:* \"Overcome\" means to be capable. If a ruler amasses virtue, his governance will ensure the people’s strength is universally preserved, and his service to Heaven will be met with unceasing auspiciousness. Then, the four directions will turn toward his transformation, and there will be nothing he cannot subdue.\n\nWith nothing that cannot be overcome, none can fathom its limits.\n*Commentary:* When a ruler’s virtue leaves nothing unconquered, even distant customs will admire his transformation, and remote lands will observe his influence—none will be too far to reach. Thus, none can fathom its limits.\n\nWhen none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state.\n*Commentary:* When a ruler’s virtuous transformation reaches all without exception, drawing the allegiance of the multitudes and the blessings of the divine, only then may he be said to possess the state. As the *Yijing* states: \"The king approaches the temple and the household.\"\n\nBeyond this, how can one be said to possess the state? The mother of possessing the state can endure long.\n*Commentary:* \"Mother\" refers to the Dao/Way, signifying nurturance. The reason one may be called a possessor of the state lies solely in having the Dao/Way to nourish the people. Thus, his fortune and reign will be everlasting and enduring.\n\nThis is called the Way of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.\n*Commentary:* A ruler who accumulates virtue and takes the Dao/Way as his state may endure long; thus, the metaphor of roots and stems is employed to expound this principle. \"Stem\" refers to the base of a flower. When the roots of plants run deep, they flourish; when their stems are firm, they do not fall—thus enduring long. This illustrates that a ruler who accumulates virtue plants his roots in the Dao/Way and secures his stem in virtue, extending his mandate in the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that governing people with frugality and cherishing causes all directions to submit early. This chapter elucidates that early submission without disturbance leads to the mutual return of virtue. First, it presents the analogy of governing the state without action. Next, it explains that virtue extends to ghosts and spirits, with neither causing harm. Finally, it concludes by extolling the virtue of mutual return, exhorting rulers who possess states.\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n*Commentary:* This is a metaphor. \"Small fish\" refers to tiny fish. When cooking small fish, one must not stir them, for stirring will break them apart. This illustrates that governing a great state must not be meddlesome, for meddling will disorder the people. Both require the Dao/Way to achieve success.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way is employed to oversee all under Heaven, its ghosts do not manifest as spirits.\n*Commentary:* \"Employ\" means to use. \"Oversee\" means to attend. Spirits that dwell in darkness and manifest as ghosts and spirits do so through their numinous efficacy. When people make requests, spirits respond. Yet if the transformation of supreme virtue ensures the people’s safety, not only will they forget the Emperor’s power, but they will also cease to invoke ghosts and spirits. Thus, the ghosts dwelling in darkness will have no means to display their numinous efficacy.\n\nIt is not that its ghosts do not manifest as spirits; their spirits do not harm the people.\n*Commentary:* This further explains why ghosts do not display their efficacy. \"It is not that its ghosts do not manifest as spirits\" does not mean ghosts cease to exist or lose their numinous power. Rather, when omens arise, it is due to human transgressions. If people maintain their virtue, spirits will not appear as portents to harm them. As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Their qi flames forth to claim them.\"\n\nIt is not that their spirits do not harm people; the sage also does not harm people.\n*Commentary:* The statement that \"their spirits do not harm people\" implies not only that spirits lack efficacy and cannot harm people, but also that the sage, employing the Dao/Way to oversee the people without action or disturbance, ensures the people rectify themselves. Thus, it is said the sage employs the Dao/Way to oversee all under Heaven. To further elucidate the sage’s virtue, it reiterates: he also does not harm people.\n\nAs neither harms the other, their virtues mutually return.\n*Commentary:* \"Neither\" refers to the sage and the spirits. The people are the foundation of the state and the hosts of the spirits. If ghosts and spirits harm the people, they injure the state’s foundation; if the sage harms the people, he impoverishes the spirits’ host. Now, as neither harms the other, their virtues mutually return. Not only do the spirits and the sage alone prosper, but the myriad people also universally benefit.\n\n**Chapter 61: A Great State as the Lower Reaches**\nThe preceding chapter clarifies that employing the Dao/Way to oversee all things leads to the mutual return of virtue. This chapter elucidates that humbling oneself with virtue causes things to return through modesty. First, it establishes that a great state employs humility to attract transformation. Next, it explains that when a great state humbles itself, both great and small attain their desires. Finally, it particularly exhorts great states to practice humility.\n\nA great state is the lower reaches, the confluence of all under Heaven.\n*Commentary:* The Jiang and the sea lie below the flow of all rivers, which empty into them—thus called the lower reaches. Applied to people, this is the virtue of humility. A ruler, possessing the Dao/Way, preserves his state; without virtue, the people scatter.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who govern a great state must dwell in the lower reaches, opening themselves to receive, so that all under Heaven converge and come—thereby preserving their greatness. Hence it is said: \"The lower reaches are the confluence of all under Heaven.\"\n\nThe confluence of all under Heaven is the female; the female ever prevails over the male through stillness.\n*Commentary:* \"The confluence of all under Heaven\" reiterates the preceding text to conclude the meaning of \"lower reaches.\" It states that the reason all under Heaven converge and come is due to the great state’s humility, likened to how the male, through the female’s stillness, is sought by the active male. Thus, it is said: \"The female ever prevails over the male through stillness.\"\n\nThrough stillness, one is below.\n*Commentary:* As previously stated, the reason all under Heaven converge and come is that the ruler employs the virtue of humility. This is like the female, who through stillness prevails over the male, for she takes stillness as her foundation in being below.\n\nTherefore, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins over the small state.\n*Commentary:* \"Therefore\" continues the preceding text to complete its meaning. It states that the ruler of a great state, eschewing force and employing the virtue of humility to gently subdue, causes the smaller rulers to seek shelter and allegiance, thereby winning over the people of the small state as subjects and servants.\n\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins over the great state.\n*Commentary:* Since the ruler of a great state employs the virtue of humility to gently subdue the small state, the ruler of the small state offers tribute, attends court, and enters alliances, never daring to rebel. By serving the great state with humble rites, the small state seeks the great state’s might as support.\n\nThus, some humble themselves to win over, while others humble themselves and win over.\n*Commentary:* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"That which can be directed left or right is called 'with.'\" \"Some humble themselves to win over\" means that when a great state employs the virtue of humility, it wins over the small state, making it amenable to direction—hence \"with.\" \"Others humble themselves and win over\" means that when a small state employs the virtue of humility to serve the great state, it can only offer allegiance and seek support, unable to direct the great state at will—hence \"and.\"\n\nA great state desires nothing more than to nurture and govern its people, while a small state desires nothing more than to enter into service.\n*Commentary:* When a great state, honoring humility, wins over a small state, it harbors no other intent but to nurture and govern the small state’s subjects as their sovereign. When a small state employs humility, offering tribute and gifts to win over the great state, it seeks nothing more than to enter into service and gain support.\n\nBoth attain their desires, so the great should be the first to humble themselves.\n*Commentary:* The great desire to nurture, the small desire to serve—both fulfill their wishes, hence \"both attain their desires.\" \"The great should be the first to humble themselves\" means that things never belittle the great because of their smallness, but the great inevitably overpower the small. Fearing that the rulers of great states may become arrogant and invite disaster, few can practice humility—thus the admonition that the great should especially humble themselves.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao/Way as the Mystery of Myriad Things**\nThe preceding chapter clarified that when one humbles oneself with virtue, both great and small attain their desires. This chapter elucidates that when the Dao/Way transforms things, both good and evil receive its sustenance. First, it establishes the profound and mysterious nature of the Dao/Way. Next, it explains the teaching that transforms people. Finally, it extols the Dao/Way’s efficacy, declaring it worthy of reverence.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the mystery of myriad things.\n*Commentary:* The Dao/Way is the potent name for the wondrous origin. \"Mystery\" means within. The Dao/Way encompasses all without exclusion, serving as the source from which all things arise—hence it is the mystery within myriad things. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: \"The Dao/Way is profoundly mysterious, the abyss of emptiness and non-being,\" which expresses this.\n\nThe treasure of the good,\n*Commentary:* \"Treasure\" denotes that which is cherished. The good are those who embody the Dao/Way through non-action, their bodies and minds pure and still—thus they treasure it without ceasing.\n\nThe refuge of the not-good.\n*Commentary:* \"Refuge\" means to rely upon or lean on. The not-good, though their minds lack wisdom, are influenced by accumulated habits. In times of peace, they neglect the Dao/Way, but in adversity, they seek it, relying upon it for safety.\n\nFine words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\n*Commentary:* This is an analogy. It states that even the not-good can be taught. As the commentary notes: \"Sweet and fine words can be used to seek in the marketplace. Noble and lofty conduct can be bestowed upon others.\" This compares the sage’s use of sweet and savory teachings, noble and still conduct, to transform the not-good—like merchants gathering in the marketplace, all following the good. Hence the following text:\n\nWhy discard those who are not good?\n*Commentary:* If people’s words and deeds are not good, why discard them? One should guide them with the good Dao/Way, hoping they will reform and abandon evil. They must not be cast aside without transformation—hence \"why discard them?\"\n\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed.\n*Commentary:* The Three Dukes refer to the Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Protector. The Son of Heaven practices non-action, while the Three Dukes discourse on the Dao/Way—all to provide instruction and establish teachings for transforming the not-good. As the *Book of Documents* states: \"Heaven’s work is performed by humans,\" which expresses this.\n\nThough one may offer a large jade disc preceded by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.\n*Commentary:* A \"large jade disc\" refers to the largest of jade discs; a \"team of four horses\" refers to the finest horses. Though the Three Dukes assist the ruler by offering jade and horses to the supreme, these are not as precious as presenting the Dao/Way of non-action, which transforms evil into good. \"Preceded by a team of four horses\" refers to the ancient custom of leading horses with jade when offering tribute—hence \"preceded.\" As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Twelve oxen, preceded by soft leather, were used to reward the army,\" which exemplifies this.\n\nWhy was this Dao/Way so revered in ancient times?\n*Commentary:* This invokes antiquity to affirm the present, inspiring trust in all things.",

      "translated_text": "The ancients—those good people of former times—treasured the Dao/Way. One may ask: why did they so treasure and revere this Dao/Way? Was it not because they sought to attain it through effort, or to escape guilt through its power? Thus it was prized by all under Heaven.\n\n*Commentary:* This answers the question of why the Dao/Way is revered. \"Not attained through seeking by the day\" means that the Dao/Way lies in awakening, and awakening lies in the clarity of the heart-mind—unlike the methods of deliberate action, which require the accumulation of days and years in striving pursuit. Simply still the heart-mind and restrain desire, and pure whiteness will arise of itself. \"Or to escape guilt through its power\" means that when deluded thoughts arise and defilement takes hold, karmic entanglements follow. But if one awakens to the Dao/Way and empties the heart-mind, the causes of guilt naturally vanish. How could this be like those who cling to rigidity, whose every movement breeds regret and resentment, and who only seek escape from punishment after incurring guilt? For this reason, the good people of all under Heaven treasure and revere it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**\n\nThe previous chapter illuminated the profound mystery of the subtle origin, showing how sitting and presenting the Dao/Way serves as the gateway for assisting the ruler. This chapter reveals the dark silence of non-action, ceasing resentment and perfecting the practice of cultivation. It begins by setting forth the principle of sitting in forgetfulness and cutting off desire, then demonstrates how to prevent evil before it sprouts. In what follows, it cites the virtues of the sage to reinforce and exhort.\n\nAct without acting,\nAttend to affairs without affairs,\nTaste without tasting.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Acting\" means contrivance. The practitioner of the Dao/Way sits in forgetfulness, casting off desire, and thus does not contrive. Whatever is enacted merges with transformation, so that in acting there is non-acting—hence \"without acting.\" This clarifies the heart-mind. Not clinging to affairs, one attends to them without affairs—this clarifies the body. Not indulging in flavors, one tastes without tasting—this clarifies the mouth. When the three karmic activities are exhausted, the six senses and their objects naturally cease.\n\nAs for the affairs of great and small, many and few—if one enters the realm of deliberate action, there is nothing that is not a foe of resentment. But if one embodies that non-action, abandons these desires, and awakens to the true reality, without giving rise to thoughts of anxiety, then resentment naturally does not arise. This is what is meant by \"repaying resentment with virtue.\"\n\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy,\nAchieve greatness while it is still small.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Plan\" means to deliberate. \"Achieve\" means to undertake. All harm to life from emotions and desires arises gradually, without exception beginning in ease and ending in difficulty, starting in the small and later becoming great. If one deliberates at the time when it is still easy, then in the end there will be no difficulty. If one undertakes at the time when it is still small, then later there will be no greatness. If one attempts difficulty in difficulty, or greatness in greatness, once calamity and chaos have already arisen, even if one then seeks to plan and act, it will be of no benefit to the affliction.\n\nThe difficult affairs of all under Heaven necessarily arise from what is easy,\nThe great affairs of all under Heaven necessarily arise from what is small.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Arise\" means to begin. This repeats the previous passage to trace the origin of calamity and difficulty. Difficult affairs necessarily begin in what is easy—this urges one to plan for them while they are still easy. Great affairs necessarily begin in what is small—this urges one to eliminate them while they are still small. The examples are truly numerous and cannot all be listed, so the text uses \"all under Heaven\" to encompass them.\n\nThus the sage never attempts greatness, and so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\n*Commentary:* The previous passage showed that ordinary people constantly attempt difficult and great affairs, and thus often fail and encounter hardship. Here it presents the sage, who never attempts difficult or great affairs, and so is able to accomplish greatness.\n\nLight promises must lack trust,\nMuch ease must bring much difficulty.\n\n*Commentary:* This concludes the analogy. Those who do not reflect thrice before speaking, and lightly and easily make promises, will surely lack loyalty and trustworthiness. Those who do not plan for the beginning and carefully consider the end, and easily undertake affairs, will later surely give rise to difficulty and become entangled in suffering.\n\nThus the sage still regards it as difficult, and so in the end encounters no difficulty.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage is the ruler who embodies the Dao/Way. \"Still regards it as difficult\" means to regard lightly making promises and much ease as difficult. How much more so for those who are not like the sage? Because the sage regards lightly making promises and much ease as difficult, in the end there are no difficult and great affairs.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: Holding What Is Secure and Easy**\n\nThe previous chapter illuminated non-action and dark silence, showing the gateway to ceasing resentment and cultivating the Dao/Way. This chapter reveals the principle of anticipating calamity and preventing it beforehand, setting forth the practice of cutting off emotions and eliminating desires. The first six lines repeatedly clarify the gradual nature of preventing calamity. The next six lines present analogies for the causes of calamity. The following two lines discuss the delusion of clinging. Another six lines expound the conduct that differs from the ordinary. The final seven lines extend the sage’s lack of desire and lack of learning to exhort the ordinary world to hold fast to what is easy and plan for what is easy.\n\nWhat is secure is easy to hold,\n\n*Commentary:* \"Secure\" means stillness. \"Hold\" means to grasp. When people receive life, their true nature is pure and still. When moved by external things, they pursue desire without end. Here it clarifies that when the heart-mind of desire has not yet stirred, in the time of stillness, if one seeks to guard it and prevent it from scattering, it is very easy to hold—hence \"what is secure is easy to hold.\"\n\nWhat has no sign is easy to plan for.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Sign\" means the first sprouts. \"Plan\" means to deliberate. When emotions and desires are about to arise but have not yet shown signs, to deliberate and cut them off is also very easy—hence \"what has no sign is easy to plan for.\"\n\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\n\n*Commentary:* When the heart-mind of desire has already stirred, it is tender and fragile, not yet firm. If one seeks to remove it, it is easy to destroy.\n\nWhat is minute is easy to scatter.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Minute\" means small. When calamity and misfortune are small and have not yet become great, to prevent them at the outset and cause them to disperse and dissolve is also very easy.\n\nAct on it before it exists,\n\n*Commentary:* \"Act\" means to cultivate and remove. This line explains the previous \"easy to hold\" and \"easy to plan for.\" The reason it is easy is that when the heart-mind of desire has not yet arisen, to cultivate and remove it, cutting it off, is to prevent evil from arising—hence \"act on it before it exists.\"\n\nPut it in order before it is in chaos.\n\n*Commentary:* This line explains the previous \"easy to break\" and \"easy to scatter.\" The reason it is easy is that although evil exists, it is still tender and minute, and has not yet become calamity and chaos—hence it is easy to put in order.",
      "overlap_context": "ot as precious as presenting the Dao/Way of non-action, which transforms evil into good. \"Preceded by a team of four horses\" refers to the ancient custom of leading horses with jade when offering tribute—hence \"preceded.\" As the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Twelve oxen, preceded by soft leather, were used to reward the army,\" which exemplifies this.\n\nWhy was this Dao/Way so revered in ancient times?\n*Commentary:* This invokes antiquity to affirm the present, inspiring trust in all things.",

      "translated_text": "A tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a hair-fine sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basketful of earth.\nA journey of a thousand li starts beneath one’s feet.\n\n*Commentary:* This speaks of calamity arising from the minute and becoming manifest. It is like a tree of arm-spanning girth, which at first grows no thicker than a hair’s end—this illustrates growth from inherent nature. A nine-tiered terrace begins with a single basket of earth—this illustrates formation through accumulated habit. A journey of a thousand li begins with the lifting of a foot—this illustrates progress through unceasing advance. Thus all things under heaven truly begin with the minute, yet people often overlook it, allowing it to become the root of calamity. Hence these three analogies are adduced to confirm the preceding text.\n\nThose who act fail; those who grasp lose.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Act\" refers to contrivance. \"Grasp\" refers to attachment. It means that people, unable to act before existence or put things in order before chaos, instead contrive beyond their inherent nature and cling to sensory realms—hence they inevitably meet with ruin and loss.\n\nTherefore the sage, through non-action, suffers no failure; through non-attachment, suffers no loss.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage, through non-action and tranquility, preserves the integrity of inherent nature and thus suffers no failure. Through emptiness and forgetfulness, free from attachment, the true nature remains constant and thus suffers no loss.\n\nIn their undertakings, the common people often fail when near completion.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Near\" means close. It means that ordinary people, in pursuing good deeds, often fail when their endeavors are nearly complete, unable to exercise caution to the end, thus bringing about ruin.\n\nIf one remains as cautious at the end as at the beginning, there will be no failure.\n\n*Commentary:* This is Laozi’s repeated exhortation. If one can be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, maintaining consistency from start to finish, then no undertaking will fail. Thus the *Book of Documents* states: \"All things have a beginning, but few attain completion.\"\n\nTherefore the sage desires what others do not desire, and does not value rare and precious goods.\n\n*Commentary:* This illustrates the sage’s conduct in contrast to the common. \"Rare and precious goods\" refer internally to what lies beyond one’s inherent nature, and externally to jewels, rhinoceros horns, and treasures. The sage, in desiring what others do not desire, neither pursues what lies beyond inherent nature nor seeks goods that burden virtue—hence does not value rare and precious goods.\n\nThe sage learns what others do not learn, thereby restoring what the common people have transgressed.\n\n*Commentary:* Ordinary people value rare and precious goods, thus they distort and strive to learn what lies beyond their inherent nature. The sage does not seek transgressive learning but preserves the naturalness of inherent nature. In learning what others do not learn, the sage thus aims to restore what the common people have transgressed.\n\nTo assist the spontaneity of the myriad things, yet dare not act.\n\n*Commentary:* \"Assist\" means to aid. \"Spontaneity\" is the inherent nature of things. When sentient beings arise in delusion and lose their inherent nature, the sage, through compassionate guidance, teaches non-action, thereby aiding the spontaneity of things and preserving the true nature from ruin—hence dares not act through worldly learning or excessive desire.\n\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Eight, Complete*\n*Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Nine*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancients Skilled in the Dao**\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidated the foresight of anticipating harm and the practice of eliminating emotions and desires. This chapter reveals how the pursuit of cunning gives rise to calamity and demonstrates the profound virtue of great compliance.\n\nFirst, it clarifies the transformative power of the Dao; next, it distinguishes the harm wrought by intelligence. From *\"Know this\"* onward, it presents discernment as a method. From *\"Constantly knowing\"* onward, it extols the effort of practice and urges cultivation.\n\nThose of old who were skilled in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple.\n\n*Commentary:* The ancient rulers who were adept at employing the Dao for transformation valued non-action and tranquility. They did not flaunt their understanding of the Dao to dazzle the people but instead guided them toward purity and harmony, curbing cunning and deceit, so that they might remain as guileless as the unlearned.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because of their excessive intelligence.\n\n*Commentary:* The reason the people are hard to govern lies precisely in their overabundance of intelligence. This excess arises because the ruler fails to embody the Dao in overseeing the realm, thereby allowing the people to employ their intelligence in crafty schemes, giving rise to deceit and making governance difficult.\n\nGoverning the state with intelligence is the state’s ruin.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"With\"* means to employ. *\"Ruin\"* means harm. When a ruler relies on cunning ministers to govern the state, an excess of intelligence leads to the rise of schemes. Where schemes are employed, deceit arises; where deceit arises, the Dao is abandoned. This brings harm to the state, hence it is called the state’s ruin.\n\nGoverning the state without intelligence is the state’s blessing.\n\n*Commentary:* When a ruler does not rely on cunning ministers but instead seeks those of pure virtue, allowing them to advance the Dao of non-action and propagate the winds of great simplicity, harmony is achieved—this is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two paths serves as a model.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"These two\"* refers to governing with intelligence and without it. *\"Model\"* means pattern; *\"serves\"* means method. When a ruler understands that governing with intelligence brings ruin while governing without it brings blessing, they should abandon ruin and embrace blessing. Knowing this, one may serve as a model and method for governing the state.\n\nConstantly knowing this model is called profound virtue.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Profound\"* means deep and wondrous. When a ruler consistently understands these two paths as a model, this is called profound and wondrous virtue.\n\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching; it moves contrary to things, and only then does it attain great compliance.\n\n*Commentary:* This is a concluding exclamation. The ruler of profound virtue transforms through non-action, their capacity unfathomable—this is depth. Their influence extends boundlessly—this is far-reaching. Thus, they return with all things to the wondrous origin, only then attaining great compliance with the true nature of spontaneity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Rivers and Seas**\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed how the pursuit of cunning gives rise to calamity and demonstrated the profound virtue of great compliance. This chapter elucidates how humility makes one a master and exemplifies the sage’s virtue of non-contention.\n\nFirst, it presents the analogy of rivers and seas, showing that humility makes one a king. Next, it clarifies how the sage employs modesty, willingly yielding without resentment. Finally, it concludes with the virtue of non-contention, offering a gateway for cultivation.\n\nThe rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at being lowly; thus, they become kings of the hundred valleys.\n\n*Commentary:* The rivers and seas can command the homage of all streams and become their kings because they excel at occupying the lowest places. As the *Book of Changes* states: *\"The way of earth changes fullness to flow into humility.\"* This is the analogy. Just as the way of earth employs humility, so all streams converge and submit to it; when the sage employs humility, the people willingly follow without resentment.\n\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, they must place their words below them.\n\n*Commentary:* This draws the analogy to its conclusion. When the sage wishes to be above the people, they must humble their words. How could the sage truly desire to be above others while placing their words below them? The sage knows that fullness invites loss, so their words are modest and gentle, their names humble and solitary. By placing themselves below others, their great virtue and vast achievements naturally earn the people’s reverence.\n\nIf they wish to lead the people, they must place themselves behind them.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage does not seek to lead others but, through feigned humility, places themselves behind others, and the people naturally follow.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people do not feel burdened; when they are ahead, the people do not feel harmed.\n\n*Commentary:* This concludes the preceding discussion. The sage occupies the supreme position of the throne, the utmost height of honor, yet labors for the people’s ease and diminishes themselves for the people’s benefit. Being above, they enable the people’s livelihood, so the people do not feel burdened. Being ahead, they ensure the people’s governance, so the people do not feel harmed.\n\nTherefore, the world delights in exalting them without resentment.\n\n*Commentary:* The sage’s virtue is vast and impartial, bringing life to all like spring. They shine like the sun, neither burdening nor harming the people. Thus, the world delights in exalting them without weariness.\n\nBecause they do not contend, no one in the world can contend with them.\n\n*Commentary:* Why does the world delight in exalting the sage without resentment? Is it not because the sage humbles their words and places themselves behind others, refusing to contend with things? Thus, no one in the world can contend with the sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World Calls My Dao Great**\n\nThe preceding chapter elucidated how humility makes one a master and exemplified the sage’s virtue of non-contention. This chapter illustrates how the Dao’s greatness appears unworthy and demonstrates the three treasures through the practice of compassion.\n\nThe first six lines declare the Dao’s greatness, explaining why it appears unworthy. The next five lines present the three treasures, urging their use through compassion. The following eight lines further expound the benefits of compassion and the harm of abandoning it. The final four lines conclude with an exclamation on the virtue of compassion.\n\nThe world calls my Dao great, yet it seems unworthy.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"Unworthy\"* means lacking resemblance. Laozi says that the world considers his Dao vast and formless, appearing to lack any likeness, hence the response below.\n\nPrecisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would long since have been small.\n\n*Commentary:* This answers why it appears unworthy.",

      "translated_text": "For only my Dao is vast and great, transcending all things, fundamentally beyond the probing knowledge of ordinary sentiment—thus it is called great. Were it to possess any likeness or resemblance, like the laws of the world, it would long since have lost its greatness. Such are the petty, coarse, and shallow laws, no different from those of cultivation—how could they be called great? The particle *ye fu* serves as an exclamatory aid.\n\nI possess three treasures, which I safeguard and hold fast.\n*Commentary:* This explains why it appears unworthy: precisely because these three practices differ from the common, Laozi says that though his Dao is great and without resemblance, it yet possesses these three treasures, most precious and noble. People of the world must safeguard and uphold them to cultivate the self and govern the state.\n\nThe first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world.\n*Commentary:* This enumerates the three treasures. Embracing benevolence and bestowing widely, loving and nurturing all beings—this is compassion. Using resources sparingly and enriching others, not depleting things—this is frugality. In undertaking affairs, harmonizing without taking the lead—this is not daring to be first in the world. The meaning of their great benefits is fully expounded below.\n\nThrough compassion, one can be brave.\n*Commentary:* This restates the efficacy of the three treasures. Ordinary people, greedy and competitive, lacking compassion, are bold in recklessness, leading to exhaustion and defeat. Now the sage practices compassion, thus bold in delivering and saving others. Later, it cites the *Analects*: \"The humane are surely brave.\"\n\nThrough frugality, one can be expansive.\n*Commentary:* By being thrifty and cherishing resources, not wasting wealth or harming others, one’s merits and benefits spread widely.\n\nBy not daring to be first in the world, one can become the chief of instruments.\n*Commentary:* Diminishing the self to benefit others, withdrawing to advance others—this is not daring to be first in the world. Thus, others gladly elevate one to become the chief of sacred instruments.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion yet claim bravery, abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness, abandon humility yet claim precedence—this is death.\n*Commentary:* *Qie* means \"rashly\" or \"recklessly.\" Worldly sentiments, full of desires, act contrary to the Dao: abandoning the compassion that benefits others for the reckless bravery that harms them, forsaking the frugality that conserves for the reckless extravagance that spreads, discarding the humility of retreat for the reckless self-aggrandizement of precedence. Such conduct violates compassion and frugality. Using it to govern the state leads to its ruin; using it to cultivate the self leads to one’s demise—hence, it is called death.\n\nWith compassion, in battle one wins; in defense, one stands firm.\n*Commentary:* Compassion is the foremost of the three treasures, thus it is singled out for praise. Using compassion to resist war preserves the multitude. Using compassion to defend brings peace to the people. Neither loses compassion, thus one can win and stand firm.\n\nHeaven will save them, protecting them with compassion.\n*Commentary:* *Jiu* means \"to assist,\" *wei* means \"to guard.\" The Way of Heaven blesses the good, and the good encounter no misfortune. Thus, those who fight with compassion will be assisted by Heaven; those who defend with compassion will be guarded by Heaven. Victory in battle and firmness in defense ultimately rely on the merit of using compassion—assisted and guarded, they ultimately receive the aid of the supremely bright.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Good Warrior**\nThe previous chapter clarified that only greatness appears unworthy, presenting the three treasures and urging their practice through compassion. This chapter clarifies that the good warrior is not martial, setting forth four virtues that match the ultimate of Heaven. It first sets forth the four virtuous practices, then praises them as the virtue of non-contention, and concludes that goodness can match Heaven, preparing to expound the essential Dao of antiquity.\n\nThe good warrior is not martial.\n*Commentary:* *Shi* means \"to serve,\" *wu* means \"might\" or \"martial power.\" The enlightened ruler, governing with the Dao, practices compassion and frugality to nurture the people, not wielding martial power to control them. What he esteems is compassion, thus he is called \"not martial.\"\n\nThe good fighter is not angry.\n*Commentary:* When armies are sent forth to meet the enemy, the matter lies in compassion and sorrow. Even mosquitoes and gnats sting—one merely drives them away. Thus, the good fighter lies in stopping the enemy, not in relying on anger—hence, \"the good fighter is not angry.\"\n\nThe good conqueror does not contend.\n*Commentary:* That non-contention arises from esteeming virtue. If one uses force to contend for victory, it is not good conquest. Leading the distant with softness and harmonizing the near, fully expressing compassion and harmony, not contending with the enemy, the enemy submits of itself—hence, \"the good conqueror does not contend.\"\n\nThe good employer of others is humble.\n*Commentary:* The good employer of others speaks with humility, and others will exert their full strength, achieving success. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: \"The noble lowers itself to the base, greatly gaining the people.\" This is called the virtue of non-contention.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the above: the good warrior is always yielding and not martial, the good fighter is always compassionate and not angry, the good conqueror is always yielding and does not contend, the good employer of others is always humble. In this way, things exhaust their abilities, and people value their use—all arising from humility. Is this not the virtue of non-contention?\n\nThis is called employing the strength of others.\n*Commentary:* Being profoundly still and reverent, humble and yielding to others, all people rejoice and willingly exhaust their strength. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: \"Delighting in employing others, people forget their toil\"—this is employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called matching the ultimate of Heaven, the essential of antiquity.\n*Commentary:* This concludes the four virtuous practices above, the virtue of non-contention. Those who can practice them can match Heaven and be called emperors—this is the ultimate essential Dao of antiquity.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Strategist’s Saying**\nThe previous chapter clarified the virtuous practices of the good warrior, whose non-contention allows him to match Heaven. This chapter clarifies that the strategist has a saying: to treat the enemy lightly is nearly to forget one’s treasures. The first line sets forth the theme with a question. The next six lines demonstrate the practice to clarify it. The final four lines admonish the use of arms, declaring that those who know compassion and sorrow will surely win.\n\nThe strategist has a saying:\n*Commentary:* Laozi detested the customs of the time, where rulers treated enemies lightly, inviting disaster, delighting in war and killing. Thus, he invoked antiquity to admonish, and what is called \"has a saying\" refers to the following line.\n\n\"I dare not act as the host but as the guest,\"",

If it were worthy, it would long since have been small.\n\n*Commentary:* This answers why it appears unworthy.",

      "translated_text": "The Commentary: \"I\" refers to the one who employs military force. To initiate is to act as the host; to respond is to act as the guest. The host, by initiating, provokes affairs and grows covetous, while the guest, by responding, guards with compassion. This makes clear that in antiquity, those who employed military force always had admonitions: one must guard with compassion and not provoke affairs or grow covetous. Thus it is said, \"I dare not act as the host but as the guest.\"\n\n\"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nThe Commentary: To retreat and guard by the Dao is to achieve good victory. To advance and seize strength is to court defeat. Thus, even a slight advance harms through covetousness, while even a great retreat gains through humility. Now, scorning contention, it is said, \"I dare not advance an inch,\" and valuing compassionate yielding, \"but retreat a foot.\"\n\n\"This is called marching without marching,\"\nThe Commentary: To march with troops is to halt the enemy; halting the enemy values non-contention. Now, acting as the guest and retreating a foot, achieving good victory through non-contention, though marching to meet the enemy, is the same as not marching.\n\n\"Repelling without arms,\"\nThe Commentary: To bare one’s arms is to display anger. One who excels in battle does not grow angry, thus it is as if there are no arms to bare, hence \"repelling without arms.\"\n\n\"Drawing no enemy,\"\nThe Commentary: To draw is to lead. To lead the enemy is to seek contention; now, taking non-contention as virtue, there is no enemy to draw, hence \"drawing no enemy.\"\n\n\"Wielding no weapon.\"\nThe Commentary: To wield is to hold; weapons refer to the five weapons—dagger-axe, spear, and the like. To hold weapons is to intend to slay the enemy. Taking compassion as the foundation and restraining one’s weapons, though weapons exist, there is no intent to kill, thus it is the same as wielding no weapon.\n\n\"There is no greater disaster than to treat the enemy lightly; treating the enemy lightly nearly loses my treasure.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Nearly\" means to approach; \"loses\" means to forfeit. \"Treasure\" refers to compassion. Of all disasters, none is greater than to slight and provoke the enemy, delighting in contention. Thus one nearly forfeits the treasure of compassion. Now, having lost compassion, to fight is to court defeat, to guard is to invite dispersal. The calamities between generations are not of one kind, but dispersal and defeat are the greatest disasters. Thus,\n\n\"When armies clash, the sorrowful will win.\"\nThe Commentary: To clash is to raise. When two states raise armies to engage, victory belongs to the ruler who follows the Dao and the general who acts with compassion, pitying the people and not seeking to kill many.\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\n*The Teachings of My Words Are Very Easy to Know*\nThe previous chapter clarified the sayings on employing military force, warning against treating the enemy lightly. This chapter clarifies the teachings that unfold the principle, showing their ease of understanding. What is easy to know must have a sovereign ruler; treating the enemy lightly forfeits compassion and goodness. First, it declares the sagely teachings as easy to know; next, it shows the lost path of those who do not comprehend. Below \"words have a sovereign,\" it explains the meaning of ease in knowing. Below \"only,\" it discusses the reasons for not comprehending. Finally, it laments the sage’s jade-like heart, exhorting the diligent practitioner.\n\n\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.\"\nThe Commentary: Laozi says that what I speak unfolds the principle; when the principle is unfolded, words are forgotten, thus they are easy to know. What I speak of as affairs is to act without acting; when affairs are simple, there is non-action, thus they are easy to practice.\n\n\"Yet none in the world can know, none can practice.\"\nThe Commentary: This laments that sentient beings cannot understand wordless words, clinging to words and stagnating in teachings, deluded by verbal instruction, thus none can know. They cannot awaken to acting without acting, entangled in affairs without restraint, lost in worldly matters, thus none can practice.\n\n\"Words have a sovereign; affairs have a ruler.\"\nThe Commentary: This reiterates the reason for ease in knowing and practicing. \"Sovereign\" means root; \"ruler\" means master. Words exist for the sake of principle; when principle is attained, words are forgotten, thus words take wordlessness as their root. Affairs exist for the sake of achievement; when achievement is complete, affairs are set aside, thus affairs take non-action as their ruler. Is this not easy to practice?\n\n\"Only because of ignorance, therefore they do not know me.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Do not know me\" means they do not know me. Only because the delusion of the age lacks awakened knowledge, fixating on names and forms, unable to unfold the principle, clinging to affairs in affairs, stagnating in words with words, thus they do not know the intent of my teachings—wordlessness and non-action.\nAnother interpretation: Laozi says that what I know lies only in unknowing, yet the people of the world seek knowledge with knowledge, thus they do not know me.\n\n\"Those who know me are few; thus those who model themselves on me are noble.\"\nThe Commentary: \"Few\" means scarce. \"Model\" means to follow. Laozi says that those who know my intent to forget words and accord with the principle are exceedingly scarce. If one can follow my words and practice them, then one may be esteemed and noble.\n\n\"Thus the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\"\nThe Commentary: Coarse cloth is fur, the garment of the lowly. To wear coarse fur is to cover the rough clothing of the humble. Jade is pure and lustrous, comparable to the virtue of the noble person. This is to say that the sage’s inner heart is wise and enlightened, while his outward appearance is like that of a fool. Thus it is said he \"wears coarse cloth,\" and because his heart is wise and enlightened, it is said he \"holds jade.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\n*To Know That One Does Not Know Is Superior*\nThe previous chapter clarified the teachings that unfold the principle, showing their ease of knowing.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Seventy-One**\n*To Know That One Does Not Know Is Superior*\n\nThis chapter clarifies the enlightened mind, wherein emptiness and forgetfulness are supreme. It begins by distinguishing between delusion and awakening, for clinging to delusion breeds deceit.\n\nOnly the lowly—concluding with praise for the sage—fully recognize that \"knowing\" is a flaw, and thus do not force knowledge.\n\nTo know that one does not know is superior.\nTo not know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\n**Commentary:** The nature of the Dao is fundamentally empty, and it is not a matter of knowing. The sage, awakened to this, does not grasp at discriminating knowledge. In not clinging to knowledge, it is called \"not knowing,\" which is the highest virtue. This explains awakening.\n\n\"Not knowing yet claiming to know is a flaw\" refers to ordinary people who do not understand that the knowledge of the Dao is not truly real. Regarding this principle of non-knowing, they forcibly assert knowledge, binding themselves to attachment. This is why it is called a flaw in conduct. This distinguishes delusion.\n\nOnly by recognizing the flaw as a flaw does one avoid being flawed.\n\n**Commentary:** Sentient beings forcibly assert knowledge, generating false views and attachments, which become afflictions. Only by recognizing the flaw of forced knowledge and forgetting knowledge itself does one avoid being afflicted by forced knowledge. Thus it is said, \"only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw does one avoid being flawed.\"\n\nThe sage is not flawed because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw, and thus is not flawed.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage’s perfect wisdom is luminous, awakened to true reality. In knowledge, he forgets knowledge, and thus is not afflicted by knowledge. Why is this so? Because he recognizes the flaw of ordinary beings’ forced knowledge, and so expounds true wisdom to dispel it. Once the flaw of false knowledge is removed, the medicine of true knowledge is also set aside. Thus it is said, \"he is not flawed.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\n*The People Do Not Fear Authority*\n\nThe previous chapter clarified the wisdom of the enlightened mind, wherein emptiness and forgetfulness are supreme. This chapter reveals the affliction of delusion and the authority that is to be feared.\n\nFirst, it states that when people do not fear authority, calamity will soon follow. Next, it warns against narrowness. Below, it urges people to empty their minds and quiet their desires, so that the spirit will not reject them. Finally, it presents the conduct of the sage as evidence, showing what to discard and what to embrace.\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will arrive.\n\n**Commentary:** Authority is that which is to be feared. Desires and aversions arise from subtle beginnings; when accumulated, they become afflictions and burdens, giving rise to great authority. If people do not guard against the subtle, they will eventually face what is greatly to be feared.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling.\n\n**Commentary:** The dwelling of the spirit is the mind. People should forget emotions and abandon desires, broadening and softening their hearts so that the inner palace is at ease. When the spirit rests in the mind, the body endures.\n\nDo not reject their source of life.\n\n**Commentary:** The source of life is the spirit. To reject is to despise. People are born through the spirit, hence the spirit is called their source of life. The numinous spirit favors emptiness and stillness. People should purify their minds and quiet their thoughts, and the spirit will naturally return to them. If they indulge desires and defile the spirit, or engage in restless activity and disturb their nature, their essence and qi will scatter and dissipate, leading to forgetfulness of their origin. Thus, they are urged not to reject the spirit that gives them life, so as to preserve the Way of longevity.\n\nOnly by not rejecting it is one not rejected.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way is called \"goodness that bestows\"; the spirit is called \"that which sustains form.\" When people cherish the Way and preserve the spirit, it is said, \"only by not rejecting it.\" By removing defilements and halting thoughts, focusing solely on purity and unity, the spirit will not reject them. Thus it is said, \"is one not rejected.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage knows himself but does not display himself.\n\n**Commentary:** To know oneself is to reflect inwardly and examine oneself, guarding against harm in its subtlety so that no fearful matters arise. To not display oneself is to not flaunt one’s talents and abilities, dazzling others, violating principle and losing constancy, thereby inviting misfortune.\n\nHe cherishes himself but does not exalt himself.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage preserves and cherishes his body, cutting off desires so that the spirit is not rejected. To not exalt himself is to not arrogantly elevate himself above others, oppressing and harming them, thereby accumulating resentment.\n\nThus, he discards that and embraces this.\n\n**Commentary:** He discards self-display and self-exaltation, and embraces self-knowledge and self-cherishing. The sage attains the wisdom of equality, awakened to the emptiness of the nature of the Dao. In principle, there is no discarding or embracing. This is spoken to teach and guide the ignorant, using such language for instruction.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three**\n*Boldness in Daring*\n\nThe previous chapter revealed the affliction of delusion and the authority that is to be feared. This chapter clarifies the consequences of boldness and daring, which lead to self-destruction.\n\nFirst, it distinguishes between daring and not daring, showing their differing outcomes in benefit and harm. Next, it elucidates the Way of Heaven’s humility and gentleness, warning against boldness and daring. Finally, it laments the retribution of Heaven’s net, urging good people to cultivate virtue.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life.\n\n**Commentary:** Resoluteness is called boldness; decisiveness is called daring. Those who are strong and unyielding, fearing nothing and lacking humility and gentleness, act with reckless decisiveness. Those who rebel against superiors and disrupt order follow the path to self-destruction. Thus it is said, \"boldness in daring leads to death.\"\n\nBoldness in not daring leads to life: if one is cautious in affairs, restrains oneself, and knows when to retreat, deciding not to act with reckless boldness or provoke misfortune, this is the path to preserving life. Thus it is said, \"boldness in not daring leads to life.\"\n\nKnowing these two, one may encounter benefit or harm.\n\n**Commentary:** The two refer to daring and not daring. If one knows that boldness leads to death and harm, while not daring leads to life and benefit, one should be bold in not daring. Though both involve boldness, their applications differ. Thus it is said, \"one may encounter benefit or harm.\"\n\nWho knows the reason for what Heaven detests?\n\n**Commentary:** Who means \"who.\" Reason means \"meaning\" or \"cause.\" Those who are bold and act recklessly bring harm upon themselves, which is detested by the Way of Heaven. Yet among the people of this world, who understands this meaning?\n\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Commentary:** This presents the sage as an example to inspire ordinary people. Even with the sage’s wisdom, he finds boldness and daring difficult, fearing their harm. How much more so for ordinary people who act with boldness and daring—how can they avoid harm?\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory.\n\n**Commentary:** Following the above statement on what Heaven detests, these four lines broadly elucidate the Way of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, warning against reckless boldness. People cling to victory and defeat, hence they contend. The Way of Heaven bestows impartially, favoring only goodness. Nothing opposes it, thus it is said to \"excel at victory.\"",

      "translated_text": "The preceding chapter clarifies how reckless daring in action leads to self-inflicted harm. This chapter reveals that action breeds contempt for death, inevitably incurring the punishment of the one who wields death. The first five lines issue a warning against the use of punishment. The next line identifies the one who wields death. The final four lines show that substituting punishment for death will surely bring fault and blame.\n\nThe people constantly do not fear death—how can they be intimidated with death?\n**Commentary:** This speaks of those who cannot abide by the Dao’s clarity and stillness, instead indulging their desires and hastening toward death. Through long habit, they grow accustomed to it and feel no fear. The ruler should transform them through clarity and stillness, guiding them with teaching—how can he further use punishment and execution to terrify them?\n\nIf the people constantly feared death and acted with perversity, I could seize and execute them—who would dare?\n**Commentary:** This shows that when the ruler transforms through non-action, the people all restrain their desires, each preserving their lives and constantly fearing death. Only those who act with perverse and unvirtuous conduct would allow me to seize and execute them—who would dare to do so immediately? The reason they are not executed is that there exists the Heavenly Net’s appointed executioner, as the following text states.\n\nThere is always one who wields death to kill.\n**Commentary:** *Si* (司) means \"to preside over.\" Heaven’s gaze is perfectly clear, nothing escapes its scrutiny. Those who act with perversity do not meet their proper end—this is the one appointed by Heaven to wield death and kill them.\n\nTo kill in place of the one who wields death is called \"taking the place of the great carpenter in hewing.\"\n**Commentary:** This says that when the unvirtuous are executed by the one who wields death, if the ruler uses his power to seize and kill them at once, he takes the place of the executioner in killing—this defies Heaven’s principle, like an unskilled man replacing the great carpenter in hewing wood.\n\nFew who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing do not injure their hands.\n**Commentary:** When the great carpenter hews wood, his movements accord with square and circle. If an unskilled man replaces him, he will surely lose the proper measure—how could he not damage the material and injure his hands? Heaven’s net does not fail, its divine principle is luminously clear. If the ruler employs punishment, taking the place of the one who wields death, how could he not harm the people and forfeit Heaven’s harmony? This is what is meant by \"how can they be intimidated with death.\"\n\n*Chapter Seventy-Five: \"When the People Suffer Hunger\"*\nThe preceding chapter showed that action breeds contempt for death, inevitably incurring the punishment of the one who wields death. This chapter reveals that heavy taxation impoverishes the people, giving rise to the harms of action. The first three sections successively clarify the causes of these harms. The final section, beginning with \"only those,\" laments and urges them to value life.\n\nWhen the people suffer hunger, it is because their superiors consume too much in taxes—this is why they hunger.\n**Commentary:** The people are the foundation of the state. If governance is oppressive and taxes are heavy, leaving the people impoverished, then the state’s foundation is harmed, and harm leads to peril. Thus, the people’s insufficiency arises from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—this is why they suffer hunger.\n\nWhen the people are difficult to govern, it is because their superiors act—this is why they are difficult to govern.\n**Commentary:** The foolish masses rely on the ruler for governance. The root of governance lies in non-action, for when I practice non-action, the people naturally transform. The reason the people are now difficult to govern is that their superiors act. Action breeds oppressive governance and disturbs the people, giving rise to great falsity—this is why they are difficult to govern.\n\nWhen the people treat death lightly, it is because they seek excessive enrichment of life—this is why they treat death lightly.\n**Commentary:** The reason people lightly enter the realm of death and forfeit their lives is that they violate their allotted portion in seeking life, nourishing it too lavishly. Disregarding the net of punishment, they pursue their desires—this is why they treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not treat life as something to be enriched are superior to those who value life.\n**Commentary:** Life has its limits; contentment with one’s portion is sufficient. It cannot be violated, nor can it be augmented. To seek life beyond what is proper is delusion. Thus, those who do not enrich their lives preserve them, while those who seek to enrich their lives lose them. Therefore, those who do not treat life as a burden to be worried over are superior to those who pride themselves on valuing life.\n\n*Chapter Seventy-Six: \"When People Are Born\"*\nThe preceding chapter showed that heavy taxation impoverishes the people, giving rise to the harms of action. This chapter reveals that action breeds desire in the heart, thus forfeiting the harmony of qi’s softness. The first part marks the two paths of life and death; the next part offers two analogies from plants and trees. The conclusion, beginning with \"the strong and great dwell below,\" warns that one must abide by harmony and softness.\n\nWhen people are born, they are supple and weak; when they die, they are stiff and strong.\n**Commentary:** When people are born, harmonious qi flows through them, naturally rendering them supple and weak. When they die, harmonious qi scatters, and their limbs become stiff and strong. This is said to show that suppleness and weakness, stiffness and strength, serve as warnings for life and death.\n\nAll things, plants and trees, when alive are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry.\n**Commentary:** This offers an analogy. All things, plants and trees, gather qi to live, so their branches and leaves flourish, soft and fragile. When qi is exhausted and they die, their stems and trunks wither and dry. The preceding part addressed beings with awareness; this part addresses those without awareness, showing that the gathering and scattering of qi determine flourishing and withering. Beings with awareness determine life and death by the presence or absence of the Dao.\n\nThus, the stiff and strong are followers of death; the supple and weak are followers of life.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the preceding meaning. It says that when plants and trees live, they are soft and fragile; when dead, they are stiff and strong. Thus, those who act with stiffness and strength are followers of death, while those who act with suppleness and weakness are the kind that live.\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.\n**Commentary:** The military saying holds that compassion is the foundation. Thus, it says that armies relying on strength will be defeated, intending to show that those who rely on strength will die.\n\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled.\n**Commentary:** The root of a tree is strong and great, so it dwells below. Its branches and twigs are supple and weak, growing together above. This takes the supple and weak to dwell above, while the strong and overbearing remain below—hence the following text states:\n\nThe strong and great dwell below; the supple and weak dwell above.\n**Commentary:** This summarizes the preceding text, explaining that the root of a tree is strong and great, so its branches and leaves grow together above. It intends to show that the strong and overbearing always dwell below the supple and weak.",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Way of Heaven\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that deliberate action stirs the heart’s desires, thereby losing the harmony of qi’s suppleness. This chapter reveals that overbearing strength inevitably invites loss, hence the analogy of Heaven’s Way.\n\nThe opening line presents Heaven as a warning. The next five lines offer an analogy to illustrate Heaven’s Way. The following eight lines synthesize the preceding meaning. The conclusion extols sagely virtue to exhort.\n\nIs not the Way of Heaven like the drawing of a bow?\n**Commentary:** This employs both principle and analogy. Heaven’s Way is profound and distant; without analogy, it cannot be made clear. Thus, the drawing of a bow is used to illuminate Heaven’s power. The method of drawing a bow is detailed below.\n\nThe high are pressed down; the low are lifted. The excessive are diminished; the deficient are supplemented.\n**Commentary:** In drawing a bow, one must align the limbs and steady the frame, ensuring proper tension and balance. Pressing down the high and lifting the low sets the arrow’s aim. Diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient adjusts the shot’s distance. Only thus can one strike the mark.\n\nHeaven’s Way is likewise: the sun, moon, cold, and heat proceed and return. As they come, they diminish what is excessive; as they go, they supplement what is deficient—thus completing the year’s work. The ruler of men should emulate Heaven’s Way: restraining the strong, aiding the weak, diminishing excess, and benefiting deficiency. Hence, it speaks of reducing abundance and augmenting humility, desiring that all things be measured and bestowed with equity.\n\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the deficient. The way of man is not so: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n**Commentary:** This clarifies that the human way cannot emulate Heaven’s diminishing and supplementing. The note on \"reducing the many to benefit the few\" is a phrase from the *Yi*’s *Modesty* hexagram.\n\nWho can take their excess and offer it to the world? Only those who possess the Way.\n**Commentary:** *Shu* means \"who.\" The Old Master laments that the age cannot emulate Heaven’s Way, descending to relieve the people and magnifying its power. Thus, he invokes Heaven’s Way to exhort: Who can emulate Heaven’s Way, diminishing their excess to succor the deficient? Only a ruler who possesses the Way can do so.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without presuming,\n**Commentary:** This cites the sage to confirm the above meaning of possessing the Way. *Presuming* means self-importance. The sage emulates Heaven’s equitable bestowal, extending virtue to all things without displaying merit—hence, it says \"without presuming.\"\n\nAnd accomplishes without dwelling.\n**Commentary:** The sage knows that dwelling on accomplishment invites Heaven’s diminution. Thus, though the Way governs the realm and merit aids the world, they ascribe glory to the multitude and do not dwell upon their achievements.\n\nNot desiring to display worthiness.\n**Commentary:** This concludes the meaning of \"without presuming\" and \"without dwelling.\" Though the sage’s abundant virtue fills within, their excellent reputation remains hidden without. Their refusal to presume action or dwell on merit stems from the desire to conceal virtue and obscure fame, not wishing others to perceive their worthiness. This, too, is the intent of diminishing excess.\n\nChapter Seventy-Eight: The Suppleness of the World\n\nThe preceding chapter revealed that overbearing strength inevitably invites loss, illustrating it with Heaven’s Way. This chapter clarifies that suppleness receives benefit, hence praising the power of water.\n\nThe first five lines extol water’s triumphant work. The next four lament that none can practice it. The following five verify the preceding meaning. The final line synthesizes the above.\n\nIn the world, nothing is more supple than water, yet in attacking the firm and strong, none can surpass it.\n**Commentary:** Water’s nature is to flow downward without contention, moving and resting with the seasons, taking shape according to its vessel. Thus, among all things in the world that are supple and weak, none surpass water. Yet in attacking the firm and strong, none can surpass it.\n\nFor though water is supple, it can bore through stone. Though stone is firm, it cannot harm water. If the firm attacks the firm, both are damaged; if water attacks stone, the stone is harmed while the water remains whole. Thus, in attacking the firm and subduing the strong, none precede water—hence, it says \"none can surpass it.\"\n\nThere is nothing that can replace it.\n**Commentary:** Though water is utterly supple, in attacking the firm and strong, nothing can replace it. Is this not because it possesses the power of non-contention and lacks the intent to prevail?\n\nGoverning the state and cultivating the self should always be thus.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. The world knows this, yet none can practice it.\n**Commentary:** The way of suppleness overcomes rigidity; the way of weakness overcomes strength. All in the world know this principle, yet deluded by self-regard and prizing their own excellence, none can practice what they know—hence, it says \"none can practice it.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage says: One who bears the state’s disgrace is master of the altars of soil and grain; one who bears the state’s misfortune is called king of the world.\n**Commentary:** This cites the sage’s words to confirm the preceding meaning, exemplifying one who practices the way of suppleness overcoming rigidity.\n\n*Disgrace* means filth and humiliation. If a ruler can contain and bear disgrace, taking the myriad transgressions of the realm upon themselves, the people will admire their virtue and not scatter. The altars of soil and grain will be served—hence, they are called master of the altars of soil and grain.\n\n*Bearing the state’s misfortune* means goodness. If a ruler can humbly employ suppleness, bearing the state’s misfortune, calling themselves \"the orphaned, the widowed, the unworthy,\" then the four seas will turn to benevolence—hence, they are called king of the world.\n\nTrue words seem contradictory.\n**Commentary:** This line concludes the above. Bearing the state’s filth yet becoming master of the altars of soil and grain, bearing the state’s misfortune yet becoming king of the world—such words appear contrary, differing from the common. Thus, the Old Master praises them as truly upright words, trustworthy in practice. Yet to the vulgar, they initially seem contradictory.\n\nChapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Resentment\n\nThe preceding chapter clarified that suppleness receives benefit, hence praising the power of water. This chapter reveals that laws and decrees generate harm, inevitably leaving lingering resentment.",

      "translated_text": "At first, establishing teachings to harmonize resentment is not yet the greatest principle. Thus, below, it is shown that those with virtue hold the tally, and resentment does not arise. Later, the Way of Heaven is discussed, revealing that the Way of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good.\n\nTo harmonize great resentment, there must remain lingering resentment.\n\n**Commentary:** In the beginning, when humanity was born, body and mind were pure and still. Now, they are mired in worldly defilements, losing the Way and sinking together—this is the work of emotions and desires. Thus, we know that what becomes the greatest resentment to the self is none other than emotions and desires. *Harmonize* means to reconcile. This speaks of the people, swayed by emotional attachments, generating deceit and falsehood. The ruler, unable to employ non-action to allow their natural transformation, instead establishes teachings and laws to curb their cunning, reconciling and harmonizing them—hence, \"harmonizing great resentment.\" Yet lingering resentment must remain, for once teachings and laws are established, traces cannot be avoided. The harm of these traces in turn becomes resentment—thus, it is said that lingering resentment must remain. How can this be considered good?\n\n**Commentary:** Establishing teachings and laws inevitably breeds harm. With lingering resentment, how can this be called good? It is merely mending one’s nature through worldly learning to seek a return to the original state. If one could transform through purity and stillness, without affairs or action, the people would possess a wind of simplicity, and the harm of lingering traces would vanish—only then could it be called good.\n\nTherefore, the sage holds the left tally but does not demand of others.\n\n**Commentary:** The left tally is the heart. The heart is the yang storehouse, contracting with external conditions—hence, it is called the left tally. When the sage establishes teachings, there are connections and traces, which become lingering resentment. Thus, he holds fast to this heart, keeping it pure and still, transforming others below. Without emotions or desires, there is no need for punishment or demands, and non-action naturally contracts.\n\nThus, those with virtue govern by the tally, while those without virtue govern by penetration.\n\n**Commentary:** *Govern* means to preside. *Penetration* means to pass through. The virtuous ruler presides over the heart and tally, allowing the people to transform themselves. The ruler without virtue, unable to empty the heart and forget the self, desires only to enact laws to control others. Enacting laws breeds harm—hence, this is without virtue.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial, ever favoring the good.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of Heaven bestows evenly, favoring the good without deceit. Thus, those who govern with purity and stillness are blessed by Heaven, and their words bring no disadvantage. Those who enact laws with cruelty and harm are visited by Heaven’s calamity, and their misfortunes cannot be escaped. Is this not the meaning of \"August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue\"?\n\n**Chapter Eighty: The Small State with Few People**\n\nThe preceding chapter showed that laws and decrees breed harm, inevitably leaving lingering traces of resentment. This chapter reveals that simplicity and purity bring perfect governance, naturally eliminating ostentatious and self-serving demands. It begins by advocating a wind of non-action to encourage emulation, showing that when the people follow the ruler’s transformation, order is achieved. Later, it clarifies that when households are sufficient and people content, there is nothing to seek.\n\nLet the state be small, its people few, so that though there be tools for tens and hundreds, they are not used.\n\n**Commentary:** *Few* means scant. *Tens* refers to squads. *Hundreds* refers to leaders. *Tools* means implements. This discusses the age of pristine antiquity. Speaking of a small state shows no desire for expansion. Speaking of few people shows no desire for multitude. Without desire for expansion, the heart is free of greed and competition. Without desire for multitude, affairs are necessarily simple. When the way of simplicity is established, the wind of purity flourishes. Even if there are tools surpassing others, fit to serve as squad leaders or commanders to govern the people, they are not put to use.\n\nLet the people regard death as weighty and not wander far.\n\n**Commentary:** *Wander* means to migrate. When transformation returns to purity, governance is not oppressive. The people cherish their lives, thus regarding death as weighty. Rooted in their fundamental occupations and delighting in their work, with nothing sought externally, each remains content in their place—hence, they do not migrate far.\n\nThough there be boats and carriages, there is no occasion to ride them.\n\n**Commentary:** Boats and carriages are made to traverse water and land, to exchange what is needed. With no coming or going, boats and carriages are abandoned, having no use. As *Zhuangzi* says, \"In the age of utmost virtue, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges.\"\n\nThough there be armor and weapons, there is no occasion to array them.\n\n**Commentary:** Armor and weapons are arrayed to subdue the disobedient and repel invaders. When the ruler practices the Way and the people below remain undivided, the affairs of attack and war are set aside. Thus, armor and weapons are sheathed, having no occasion to be arrayed.\n\nLet the people return to knotting cords and using them.\n\n**Commentary:** In ancient times, before writing and contracts arose, knotted cords were used to record affairs. Thus, the *Appended Sayings* states, \"In high antiquity, knotted cords governed; later sages replaced them with writing and contracts.\" This is to show that in the age of knotted cords, people were pure and simple. Once writing arose, deceit and falsehood were born. Now, it would have the people forget emotions and abandon desires, returning to pristine antiquity—hence, \"let the people return to knotting cords and using them.\"\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful...",

      "translated_text": "Where food is fitting, all that is eaten is sweet. Where clothing is appropriate, all that is worn is beautiful. If neither is fitting nor appropriate, even jade-like feasts and brocade robes cannot be called sweet or beautiful.\n\nLet them be content with their dwellings, delight in their customs.\n\n**Commentary:** Without desires, one is content with one’s dwelling. With transformed purity, one delights in one’s customs. If desires are pursued without restraint, one will not be content with one’s dwelling. If governance is harsh and daily more vexatious, how can one delight in one’s customs?\n\nLet neighboring states be within sight of one another, let the sounds of their roosters and dogs be heard across the borders, yet let the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them.\n\n**Commentary:** That neighboring states are within sight and the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard speaks to their proximity. That people grow old and die without traveling between them arises from each being self-sufficient, having nothing to seek from the other.\n\n**Chapter 81: Sincere Words Are Not Fine**\n\nThe two scrolls, upper and lower, together illumine the Dao and its virtue. They begin by declaring the essential aim, opening the gate to all mysteries. They conclude by gathering and returning, guiding one to the path of attaining the meaning.\n\nThus, they entrust the teaching to the contrast between sincerity and beauty to manifest the instruction of words, and discuss the distinction between goodness and eloquence to admonish cultivation. They write of vast knowledge to show the lost and deluded, and expound non-accumulation to teach forgetting and relinquishment. They borrow multiplicity to unfold the nature of the Dharma, and conclude with non-contention to clarify the sage.\n\nThey intend that learners penetrate the subtleties within words and images, and guide the fish-trap and rabbit-snare beyond the principle itself. Awakening to the teaching, one may forget the teaching—why then seal one’s lips in Vimalakīrti’s silence? Through words, one clarifies the wordless, and thus may understand the mind at the pillar beneath.\n\nSincere words are not fine.\n\n**Commentary:** Sincere words are the truthful words of sagely teaching. Here, the Old Master wishes to clarify the teachings he expounds, transforming and guiding sentient beings. They are truly sincere, and thus at odds with the common, deemed by the world as not fine.\n\nFine words are not sincere.\n\n**Commentary:** Fine words refer to the sweet and pleasing words of worldly teaching. Their speech is full of embellishment, moving in accord with the vulgar. Being neither truthful nor sincere, they cannot transform others. That sincere words are not fine is precisely because the fine words of worldly teaching are not sincere.\n\nThe good do not dispute.\n\n**Commentary:** The goodness of awakening to the teaching lies in cultivation. In practice, one forgets it, never clinging or stagnating, and thus does not dispute.\n\nThe disputatious are not good.\n\n**Commentary:** Those who merely dispute the teaching, never awakening or understanding, accumulate many delusions in their cultivation and stagnation, and thus are not good.\n\nThe wise are not learned.\n\n**Commentary:** *Zhi* means awakening and understanding. *Bo* means extensive hearing. Those who embody the Dao and awaken to it value essence and unity, not extensive hearing. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says, \"Extensive hearing drowns the mind.\"\n\nThe learned are not wise.\n\n**Commentary:** Those with extensive hearing stagnate in the teaching of words. Stagnating in the teaching, they speak all day without exhausting it. Not awakening, they are called unwise.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate.\n\n**Commentary:** *Ji* means stagnation and gathering. The sage, having wondrously penetrated the source of principle and deeply understood the nature of the Dharma, awakens to the emptiness and falsity of written words and the hollowness of verbal teachings. Having clarified the principle expounded, the words that expound it are also relinquished. Thus, regarding those verbal teachings, there is not the slightest stagnation or accumulation. Hence, it is said the sage does not accumulate.\n\nHaving given to others, one’s own is ever more abundant. Having given to others, one’s own is ever more plentiful.\n\n**Commentary:** *Ji* means to exhaust. Though the sage does not stagnate in verbal teachings, sentient beings must rely on the sage’s guidance to develop wisdom. Thus, the sage exhausts the pure and tranquil principle, giving it entirely to the foolish and teaching them. In the sage’s nature of wisdom and understanding, there is no depletion. Hence, it is said ever more abundant, ever more plentiful.\n\n**Annotation:** *You* clarifies one’s inherent nature. *Duo* clarifies external benefit. The nature of awakening to principle is not possessed by another, hence it is called inherent. The benefit of teaching does not arise from within, hence it is called external. This clarifies that when the sage teaches the foolish, their minds become ever more understanding, hence ever more abundant. As they learn and half is taught, the principle becomes ever more lucid, hence ever more plentiful.\n\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of Heaven bestows life and nurtures the myriad things—this is benefit. It does not dominate or sever—this is non-harm. This analogy is raised to clarify the sage’s Way of vast benefit.\n\nThe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\n**Commentary:** The Way of the sage, in all its actions, does not contend with things. For the sage has no stagnation or accumulation, and having given to others, one’s own is ever more abundant—hence, does not contend.\n\n*Imperial Commentary on the Authentic Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Ten, Completed*",
