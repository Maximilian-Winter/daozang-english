In a dream, he once beheld it, calling it the *Ninefold Transformed Huayang Scarf*. His master’s bearing was majestic, resembling that of Zhongli, and with this scarf bound upon his head, his radiance and refinement only deepened—truly a man beyond the world of things. Thus, these verses were composed in praise:\n\nHis countenance mirrors Zhongli’s treasured form,\nNaturally poised, his spirit refined and bright.\n\n**How could one know he is not a wanderer of the red dust?**\n*It is the Ninefold Transformed Huayang Scarf of blue cloth.*\n\n**In Praise of Chongyang’s Perfected of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation**\nA cloud-wrought crown, a rosy cape, a crimson sash—\nHis form enters the radiant sphere, apart from the Purple Clarity.\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Conduct fulfills his primal vow,\nRescuing the imperiled, saving the suffering, ferrying all beings.\n\n**Following the Rhyme of Perfected Chongyang**\nHe dwells not in towns nor villages,\nThinks not of wife, son, or grandson.\nHis resolve lies in circling the walls to cultivate the Great Dao,\nTurning the jade gate to enter the golden portal.\n\n**Expressing My Thoughts**\nThirty years within the gate of Confucian learning,\nYet not one word as vast as heaven did I know.\nBy chance, I awakened to the principles of the Wind Immortal—\nSuddenly, numinous clarity filled the boundless cosmos.\n\n**Again**\nA realm of immortals, vast and formless,\nLofty and vaulted, a heaven of one’s own.\nIn broad daylight, at ease without trivial affairs,\nOne soars through the cinnabar clouds, riding the mist.\n\n**Again**\nA carefree wanderer of the Three Mountains,\nAn unbound immortal, at ease and unconstrained.\nIn purity, one turns the scenes within the pot,\nIn non-action, one treads and shatters the heavens within the cave.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of the Second Young Master of the Medicine King of Chang’an**\nCloud-roaming, I crossed waters past Zhongmou,\nWhere I met the great praise of Master Chongyang.\nHe permitted me to return in perfect clarity,\nAmong the thirty-six Perfected of the Grotto-Heavens.\n\n**[Ten Quatrains]**\nWhen Perfected Chongyang wished to journey to Ninghai, he personally drew a painting and entrusted it to his disciple, Master Shi of Liquan County, to keep in secret.\n\nYu dreamed beforehand of a crane emerging from the earth in the Southern Garden. A month later, Master Chongyang arrived, pointing to where the crane had risen and instructing that a hut be built there.\n\nYu further dreamed of following his master into a mountain. The next day, his master bestowed upon him the childhood name *Shantong*.\n\nXuan followed his master to Nanjing. As the year drew to a close, the master prepared to depart the world.\n\nYu sought to leave the world in distress.\nThe master said: *\"I have already written of this beforehand on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Guanzhong.\"*\n\nYu informed the master of his three wishes:\nFirst, to print and circulate the *Complete Perfection Collection* of the master.\nThe master replied: *\"It is already settled in Chang’an.\"*\nSecond, to observe mourning for the master for three years.\nThe master said: *\"The old hut site in Liujiang Village will suffice for your dwelling.\"*\nThird, to exhort parents of all directions to cast off the mundane and cultivate immortality.\nThe master said: *\"Enough. Ascend in rosy clouds.\"*\n\nI parted ways at Daliang, passed through Luoyang, entered Tong Pass, crossed Mount Hua, and visited Jingzhao. A Daoist friend urged me to stay, and I lingered for several days in Master Kong’s hut.\n\nMaster Shi of Liquan came seeking me, and we met at the tea house by the eastern gate. When asked his name, he said: *\"I am Shi Fengzi of Liquan, also a disciple of Perfected Chongyang.\"* Hearing this, I rejoiced greatly, for the master had often spoken of his worth.\n\nAfter tea, I strolled idly beneath the Taiping Tower. Daoist friend Yang the Second invited me to stay, and as we sipped tea, Master Shi arrived. He again offered bows, but I reproved him: *\"Since you are a disciple of Master Chongyang, why so many courtesies? How can a Daoist live by bowing two or three times a day?\"*\n\nI knew beforehand that this gentleman feared begging in the streets, so I sought to provoke him. I wished to share a pot of wine with him, but the host was unsure. Master Shi drew coins from his robe, but I said: *\"No need for these. Go to the streets, beg for money, and buy wine.\"* After staring for a while, he went to beg and returned with wine. I drank alone, and when he asked for a poem, I composed ten quatrains to bestow upon him:\n\n*What shame is there in a walking corpse and moving bones?*\n*Do not let clothing and food stir up needless sorrow.*\n*Learn from me—stretch your arms in the streets,*\n*Begging as you go, most free and refined.*\n\n**Again**\n*Wealth and honor are but trifles,*\n*While life and nature are as vast as heaven.*\n*Fire, wind, earth, and water are like floating bubbles—*\n*First see through this illusory body.*\n\n**Again**\n*Today, I truly meet a worthy one,*\n*Do not let household affairs create karmic debt.*\n*Subdue your self and go begging—*\n*Daily life will naturally become effortless.*\n\n**Again**\n*Ma Feng does not love the wine in the cup,*\n*But leads you to stretch your hands idly in the streets.*\n*Pass the days as you will, aiding the Dao’s growth,*\n*No need to concoct medicine to idle away your mouth.*\n\n**Again**\n*Take this coarse wine to aid my spirit,*\n*Rely on the jade nectar to nourish your celestial truth.*\n*Who knows that the drunker one becomes, the more clear and free?*\n*One day, your merit complete, you’ll be a person of the Three Isles.*\n\n**Again**\n*No wife, no son, no daughter—*\n*Heaven grants you carefree ease; best to awaken.*\n*Do not deceive your heart or mock others,*\n*For unseen spirits ever watch over you.*\n\n**Again**\n*Let go of all you once cherished,*\n*Hasten to withdraw and seek beyond the world.*\n*What you seek is not apart from the inch-square of your heart—*\n*Be selfless and upright, and you’ll find a true friend.*\n\n**Again**\n*The celestial mechanism dare not be lightly imparted,*\n*Observe carefully whether you awaken or not.*\n*When hardship comes, forget your home—*\n*Then I will point you to the path of longevity.*\n\n**Again**\n*Fleeting fame and profit are hard enough to seek;*\n*Once gained, you’ll lie in an earthen mound.*\n*Do not think immortality a trifling matter—*\n*It requires merit and conduct to reach Yingzhou.*\n\n**Again**\n*To become an immortal, you must awaken fully,*\n*Cast aside the ten thousand worldly ties in one stroke.*\n*Always find even your shadow too much—*\n*Then you’ll naturally have an immortal to guide you.*\n\n**For the Daoist Friends of Chang’an**\nAt every household’s gate, the Dao of Chang’an,\nIn every courtyard, the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\nWith a single step unmoved, one transcends the dharma-realm,\nWith three faces all-pervading, one attains cool clarity.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Guo Zicong’s Instruction for Chang’an**\nLuminous and pure, the divine radiance shines abundantly,\nNaturally, the monkey and horse are not driven.\nTurning deeper, one awakens to the path of mysterious penetration—\nI wonder if Fen Yang has received the message.\n\n**Matching Magistrate Lu’s Rhyme**\nA single body becomes the circling wall,\nA carefree spirit-child dwells within.\nThough mute, it speaks words of profound mystery,\nDo not let the monkey and horse run wild.\n\n**For Kong the Elder and His Brother Peng Ziyuan of Chang’an**\nAt forty-eight, I came to Chang’an,\nSeeking the regard of various gentlemen with discerning eyes.\nToday, I extend myself to those who know me—\nSpeaking of cultivation, I reveal the coiled dragon and tiger.\n\n**Again**\nHut-master Kong and Peng Ziyuan,\nAlong with all Daoist kin, early sought the mysterious.\n\nWithin the body, the fire of long life nourishes,\nWithin the crucible, the everlasting sky is perfected.\n\n**Again**\nHeart clear, intent pure, nature roams free,\nUnfettered and unbound, the waist unburdened.\nIf you wish lead and mercury to conjoin within the furnace,\nFirst harmonize the inner elixir of the cauldron.\n\n**Again**\nCast aside worldly ties, let all affairs cease,\nNaturally, the true cause is grasped.\nThe vital and harmonious essence pierces the cinnabar cave,\nThe awakened spirit-child ascends the jade tower.\n\n**Again**\nUnmoved by external pleasures, untouched by greed or wrath,\nBlending with the world, radiant in speech and laughter.\nI only wish that all gentlemen share my resolve—\nTogether we cultivate and ascend as immortals.\n\n**Again**\nRoaming beyond the mundane, the spirit is fortified,\nFree from care, forgetting schemes, uniting with the supreme truth.\nRealize that non-contention marks the highest adept,\nEver embracing forbearance, one becomes an immortal.\n\n**Again**\nDaoist joy is most fitting,\nPassionately fond of song and revelry, utterly enchanted.\nIn purity and stillness lies true delight,\nNaturally, sleeves dance into the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nOn Sanji Mountain, the rustic refines the great elixir,\nWithin the jade furnace, snow blankets all.\nAwakened, one no longer flaunts a bearded might,\nBut humbly invites others to look with discerning eyes.\n\n**Again**\nAwakened, one feels no shame in begging for scraps,\nHow could fame or profit sway my being?\nI urge all gentlemen to relinquish attachment,\nAnd swiftly follow Ma Yu in seeking the formless.\n\n**Again**\nSwiftly focus the mind, restrain the monkey-heart,\nCirculate the pure and void, let metal and wood flow.\nThrough ninefold refinement, the great medicine is perfected,\nForever as immortal kin, dwelling on Yingzhou.\n\n**Inscribed at the Hall of Reverence for Antiquity, Office of the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, for Secretary Wang Qingu**\n\nMaster Wang’s nature ever reveres antiquity,\nWithin his hall, dragons and tigers idly harmonize.\nDay by day, month by month, inversion is achieved,\nNaturally, the embryonic immortal dances forth.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu’s visage is ancient,\nHaving awakened to the lofty dragon and the watery tiger.\nHe submits to the wondrous mystery within the supreme principle,\nDaring to dance with Ma and Feng upon the streets.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu upholds the primordial,\nBefore heaven and earth, the true dragon and tiger.\nEmerging from height, entering the depths, east or west at will,\nStartling the elixir-child to dance in response.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu comprehends the eternal,\nNurturing dragon and tiger within the formless.\nClear and pure, the primordial origin is revealed,\nThe carefree spirit-child dances before all.\n\n**At Mafang, Visiting Lecturer Li the Younger Reading the *Nanhua Jing***\n\nTo seek texts and trace antiquity is to know much,\nYet awakening to the *Nanhua* deepens the mystery.\nBetter to cast aside the ten thousand entanglements,\nStruggle free to grasp the one and ascend the celestial ladder.\n\n**For Abbot Liu of Mafang Hermitage**\n\nWith whole heart enter the Dao, reaching the journey’s end,\nThe two qi harmonized, gathered with utmost care.\nThe three treasures—essence, spirit, qi—conjoin,\nThrough the four seasons, converging toward Yingzhou.\n\n**For Little Zhang of Hu County**\n\nWhen the young one asks of the Dao, the Dao remains wordless,\nYet purity sustains the most wondrous mystery.\nRely on this ancestral way, ever preserved,\nNaturally, one has the destiny to become a divine immortal.\n\n**For Little Wang of Hu County**\n\nYoung one, listen to the nurturing of the spirit-child,\nBy karmic cause, you follow the Ma-Feng lineage.\nThrough non-action and purity, awaken fully,\nNaturally, your cloud-steps reach Penglai Palace.\n\n**For Xu Qingshen of Qingzhen**\n\nEver entangled in the fiery household, never seeing the end,\nA single body vainly bears a family’s sorrows.\nEven if you settle all for them, it remains unsettled—\nBetter to still the heart and cease at once.\n\n**For Wu Jieyuan of Hu County**\n\nI encountered immortals, others encountered me,\nYet they remain like me, consumed by smoke and fire.\nNurturing qi, preserving truth, unstained by dust,\nNaturally, one has the destiny to bear immortal fruit.\n\n**For Duwu the Fifth of Hu County**\n\nTo cultivate immortality, first subdue self and ego,\nThen within the waters, nurture the true fire.\nIntent diminished, heart forgotten, without a speck of dust,\nThe elixir of nature congeals, the fruit of success ripens.\n\n**Passing the Hanpi Verdant Hall in the Hu Countryside, Composed for Liang the Maiden of Yaozhou**\n\nForm is emptiness, emptiness is form,\nForm and emptiness both forgotten.\nSince awakening to the form within emptiness,\nSuddenly, the heart-lotus exudes jade-green fragrance.\n\n**For Magistrate Pei of Li Springs**\n\nBefore your eyes, children grow into adults,\nTheir whiskers and beards like tarnished silver.\nDo not blame my haggard and worn appearance—\nThey have stolen my finest spirit.\n\n**For Master He of Chunhua, Gift of a Mottled Bamboo Staff as Travel Provision**\n\nA single stalk, truly a dragon-transforming timber,\nStruck to vanquish the three corpses, demons, and specters.\nBlood-stained, mottled like tortoiseshell,\nI gift it to you, to bear on your journey to Penglai.\n\n**On the Lower Prime Day of the Ding-You Year, Exiting the Encircled Wall**\n\nDancing thus, truly hastened,\nRecognizing the eternal origin’s true visage.\nMaster Father and Master Uncle descend to the world,\nThe auspicious moment directly pointed to the northwest.\n\n**Reunion**\n\nMaster Father Chongyang, the Wondrous-Acting Perfected of Compassionate Transformation,\nMaster Uncle Yuchan, the Pure and Serene Perfected of Universal Clarity.\nHaving just passed Fufeng, I turned back in haste,\nSpecially visiting Qiyang to boast of my discerning eyes.\nAgain encountering my original master, obtaining the great elixir,\nHe instructed me to establish east, west, south, and north.\n\n**On the Twenty-Eighth Day of the Mid-Winter Month, Re-Entering the Encircled Wall**\n\nThe wind howls, the wind-horse departs,\nRoaming the northwest clouds for over a month.\nYet longing for my former retreat, I return,\nLeaping once more into the encircled wall.\n\n**Sealing the Doors and Windows**\n\nFrom Kunyu, Sanji, and Ma Mountain, the rustic,\nI firmly seal the doors and windows ninefold.\nRevolving Kan and Li, Geng and Jia,\nUnconcerned with south or north, east or west.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\n\nIn the early winter of the Wuyin year of the Dading era, I journeyed from Longmen to the Taihe Hermitage in Huating, staying over ten days, intending to brush my sleeves and head for Kongtong.\nOn that day, I lingered only in the eastern quarters, staying one or two days at Master Gong’s hermitage.\nAt the time, there were Liu Zhaoxin, Pei Daqi, Li Dacheng, and over ten fellow Daoists from the city and suburbs.\nI exhorted them through the night, yet not one turned their heart toward the Dao.\nThe next day, about to depart, I left this quatrain:\n\nThe cinnabar-refined Yang’s jade nature unfolds,\nCloud-roaming the northwest, selecting immortal timber.\nThe brocade-scaled fish eludes the empty cast,\nI reel in my line and return.\n\n**Li Dacheng of the Fishing Middle, Again Using the Previous Rhyme**\n\nThe foolish one’s nature suddenly opens wide,\nA single spark of numinous yang, called chosen timber.\nLet no dust or grime dim the heart,\nIn clarity, transmit the wondrous mystery.\n\n**Four More Poems for Li Dacheng**\n\nYou’ve hooked the lost from the sea of suffering,\nTogether we walk and sit, freely roaming.\nEntrusting the true within the heart, refining nature,\nAttaining the wondrous, penetrating the mysterious, we wander the ten isles.\n\nOnce more, joyful that the worthy turns their head to join the current,\nAwakening to wander the world within the gourd.\nClouds and waters require no toil of foot,\nNaturally step by step one reaches Penglai Isle.\n\nOnce more,\nUnfettered and carefree, flowing as one with the Dao,\nNot following fame or profit, roaming beyond the dust.\nBefore returning to the cinnabar clouds of the celestial grotto,\nFirst tread the Jasper Isle within the gourd.\n\nOnce more,\nHow fares the Great Vehicle’s harmonized essence?\nUnattached, far surpassing all else uncelebrated.\nNature like a solitary cloud or lone crane,\nFree and at ease—nothing surpasses this.\n\n**Returning the Black Cap to Magistrate Zhao**\nCarving through darkness, cleaving ignorance, no longer foolish,\nAble to distinguish black from white, the jade nature crimson.\nMaster Wumao awakens to the bright moon,\nThe Red Pine Immortal scorns the pure wind.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\nLi Jichuan dreamed of receiving a quatrain from Master Cuan, and I thus matched it in praise:\nMaster Cuan once bowed to me as teacher,\nHis will steadfast, never for a moment wavering.\nAfter the cicada’s molt, roots clearly seen,\nBy chance he descended to the world and left behind these verses.\n\n**To Abbot Zhang Dawu of Huating County**\nUpright words must be heeded,\nRefine the root, solidify the source, qi steadies the spirit.\nIf the horse and monkey remain unruly,\nGuard against unforeseen calamity befalling the body.\n\n**To a Daoist Friend of Huating County**\nHorse-like wind, compassionate vows emulating Vimalakīrti,\nEver grieving for the multitudes suffering deeply.\nExhortations in verse, if awakened to,\nSpare them from rushing into fire like moths.\n\n**To Madame He, Wife of Jiao Gong**\nYouth has passed, yet still clinging to the boudoir,\nPity the deluded, unaware of autumn’s approach.\nBefore becoming utterly withered and worn,\nSeek the wondrous mystery early, don the lotus crown soon.\n\n**On the Winter Solstice, Gifting Charcoal to Vice Prefect Li Zhenguo of Longzhou**\nYang revives, the year renews,\nI laugh at the poet’s excessive toil.\nBreathing on the brush, madly chanting, inscribing jade slips,\nEvery thought and impulse—charcoal for dark fuel.\n\nOnce more,\nHeaven’s Dao offers two paths to humanity,\nIn winter’s month, none are spared.\nScorching heat, proud qi mingling with ice,\nIn a poor hut’s cold stillness, even fire feels chill.\n\n**Thanking Liu Sanlang of Longzhou for the Sheepskin Robe**\nFrost clouds uniform, no variation,\nSix-petaled flakes drift, sealing the old pass.\nDeep gratitude to the true Daoist friend from Pengcheng,\nGifting me this fur robe to withstand winter’s cold.\n\n**Parting from Longzhou**\nWater and clouds wander by rule,\nFlowing or reversing, none can fathom.\nWithin, revolving the mechanism of heaven and earth,\nComprehending the root source, truly one attains.\n\n**On the Twenty-Ninth Day of the Seventh Month, Gengzi Year, Inscribed on the Eastern Wall of the Southern Dipper Pavilion at Taiping Palace, Zhongnan**\nFleeting as wind harms a speck of dust—gone,\nWho would rush about like me?\nThe awakened turn their heads, grasp the wondrous,\nNaturally, Penglai Isle is the journey’s course.\n\n**On the Twenty-Fourth Day of the Eighth Month, Gengzi Year, Praying for Rain in Chang’an**\nBarefoot, horse-like wind, praying for rain,\nHeart’s incense curls toward the immortal court.\nWhen will the plow receive its due moisture?\nFive fives never stray from twenty-five.\n\nOnce more,\nShoots wither, the myriad people grieve,\nBurning heart’s incense, auspicious qi rises.\nPraying again, the Three Perfected descend together,\nA sudden downpour—autumn’s harvest assured.\n\n**Encountering a Crane While Visiting Gu Moke’s Study**\nCloud companions, rosy friends attend the feast,\nStep by step, Gui Peak before me.\nI seek the guest by the green lotus pool,\nOthers see the yellow crane’s immortal from the grotto.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\nAbbot Wuchang of Wutai came to serve tea, asking:\n“They say clouds drift in azure skies, water rests in a vase—how so?”\nThe Moon Master spoke of ancients’ words,\n“Clouds in azure skies, water in a vase.”\nI understood: water and clouds reversed,\nA stream’s wind and moon, wine just sobered.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Zhao Dianshi of Qiyang Town**\nOx, deer, and sheep carts overturned,\nFew hold discourse, few act.\nHaving met and received direct transmission,\nHow could I deceive the parents of the ten directions?\n\nOnce more,\nTwo wheels swiftly come and go,\nI ask myself—how many years?\nStudying the *Yi*, past the age of hearing,\nYet stubbornly refusing my old wife’s deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nDifferent names must be discussed in many ways,\nDo not say they are unrelated to the mysterious.\nIf a scholar is swayed by wind and horse,\nNaturally, he will not heed the pillow’s deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nNine-turning effort lies in the workings,\nDo not say delving into the wondrous is irrelevant.\nThe profound principle is hard for people to grasp,\nBefore attaining clarity, endure the deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nAbandoning that, clinging to this,\nLoving the immortal’s essence, enduring shame.\nWood and metal’s threefold mystery,\nNot wild words or clever deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nKan and Li exchange positions, circulating,\nComing and going, not externally.\nI wish to confide in those who know me,\nBut others cling, calling it foolish.\n\nOnce more,\nThe Dao’s law is naturally distinct,\nThe wondrous mystery attained through sincerity.\nHeaven’s mechanism is profound, not the common Dao,\nWithout meeting a true teacher, all is deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nI have awakened to this and that,\nRegardless of others’ concern or indifference.\nLearning the Dao stems from true attainment,\nDeceiving others is self-deception.\n\nOnce more,\nDragons and snakes rise from land, qi surging,\nSun and moon share a palace, not the ten stems.\nFollowing this cultivation, immortality is certain,\nDo not say Ma Yu deceives others.\n\nOnce more,\nImmortal scriptures speak of refining and holding,\nYet deluded people refuse to act.\nManaging household affairs in the mundane world, boasting of enlightenment,\nClearly, one deceives one’s own heart.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with the Silver Brothers of Yaozhou**\nMeeting the profound, interest endures,\nHeart opens, awakens—best to leave the world.\nIndolent at ease, forming true delight,\nLaughable, the busy unaware of their busyness.\n\n**Matching Rhymes Again, Purchasing from the Hou Brothers of Hezhong**\nWithin the gourd, refining, emerald clouds lengthen,\nRepairing gardens and pavilions, no night in that land.\nSeizing the flying crow and running hare,\nNaturally, sun and moon are unhurried.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Magistrate Lei of Shuzheng County**\nYour reputation surpasses Su Qin’s,\nUnlike those who conceal their light, hiding their names.\nBeyond things, carefree and truly unconstrained,\nFrom the beginning, a single point is naturally bright.\n\nOnce more,\nStillness and clarity are the elixir of longevity,\nAbandoning wife and children, no oral transmission.\nAfter awakening, knowing emptiness, not clinging to existence,\nNaturally, good causes and conditions are attained.\n\n**On New Year’s Day**\nSpring and summer return, autumn also shifts,\nLast night’s lingering year-end swept away by the wind.\n\nNew Year’s Day, people say we gain a year,\nI say this floating life loses one instead.\n\n**For Liu Mengsong, Palace Examination Graduate of Gaoling**\nDreaming aright, you kept the eighteen elders whole,\nYet how could this compare to one spiritually attuned?\nMajestic and radiant, worldly dust cannot stain,\nVast and dignified, your nature remains unvoid.\n\n**Admonition to Spring Excursionists**\nSeeking blossoms, chasing emeralds in lavish display,\nHow could you pause to sigh for falling flowers?\nIf you awaken to the truth of flourishing and decay,\nTurn back beyond the world to refine cinnabar.\n\n**Matching Xiao Pu’s “Affairs of the Garden” – A Warning to Sightseers**\nWithin the gourd, refinement yields eternal spring,\nYet you, in the fourth month, chase blossoms and green.\nCease your infatuation with butterflies’ frivolous dance,\nLest the flower’s allure ensnare your very being.\n\n**Again**\nDiligently tending the fire, you cling to grafting,\nNever ceasing the sweet nectar upon lips and teeth.\nWith resolve, cultivate truth and banish sleep’s demon,\nWithout attachment to the false, tend the primal leaf.\n\n**Inscribed on a Paper Fan**\nEmotions severed, passions forgotten in stillness,\nThe heart bright, the spirit manifest—white plantain.\nAs jade-like radiance sways, a pure breeze arrives,\nNo need for frost-white silk to dispel summer’s heat.\n\n**On Pomegranate Blossoms**\nThe courtyard ablaze with pomegranates red as fire,\nMocking peach and plum that chase fleeting bubbles.\nWho knows that chrysanthemums by the eastern fence at frost’s dawn\nWill blaze in fragrant splendor, claiming autumn alone?\n\n**Quatrain**\nFor the Lord of Jingye Manor by White Horse River, who bestowed a crooked bamboo staff\nCrooked and curved, destined to become a dragon’s timber,\nDeep thanks for your noble gift to me.\nOne day, when the work is complete and truth fully realized,\nI’ll ascend the clouds to visit Penglai with it in hand.\n\n**Quatrain**\nLamenting how people only know to eat and defecate,\nNever pausing to attend to their nature and life.\nThe grain cart enters, the dung cart departs,\nThis endless cycle—when will it end?\nEven if granted a lifespan of a hundred years,\nIt amounts to no more than thirty-six thousand days.\n\n**Quatrain**\nPeople cling to a couplet from the ancients:\n*“First, you must experience all worldly affairs,\nThen seek the mechanism of transcendence.”*\nYet this principle is not entirely sound.\nWorldly affairs are boundless, without end,\nTo claim you’ve “experienced them all” is itself a fallacy.\n\nDo better to see through all attachments as nothingness,\nThen naturally you penetrate the mysterious and grasp the wondrous mechanism.\n\n**Admonition to the Foolish**\nAlas, how foolish people are—\nDwelling in a fiery house, they seek a red-hot furnace.\nNot only do they fail to reach a place of coolness,\nHow can they escape the stench and filth of the ditch?\n\n**Admonition to the Wicked**\nA deep sigh for the wicked,\nWho rely on power to bully others for their own amusement.\nDay by day, their stubborn hearts breed evil;\nIn the end, how will they withstand the torments of the evil realms?\n\n**The Sixteen Battlegrounds**\nFire, wind, earth, and water bind the skin-sack;\nThe four demon-kings of eye, ear, nose, and tongue.\nSelf and others, right and wrong sow the seeds of karma;\nQi, wealth, wine, and lust—these are the execution grounds of men.\n\n**Distinguishing Right from Wrong**\nWind, flowers, snow, and moon bring no true benefit;\nWine, lust, anger, and wealth are all enemies.\nSelf and others, right and wrong summon ghostly destinies;\nOnly in pure tranquility and virtue does the immortal’s boat ferry one across.\n\n**Urging Resolute Entry into the Dao**\nSilken blades, felt arrows, paper spears—\nHow can these seize the immortal’s banner and join the Dao’s current?\nA true man of resolve and courage,\nTo escape life and death, must turn his gaze at once.\n\n**To Fellow Daoists**\nIf your heart is set on entering the Dao, do not delay,\nLest procrastination age the worthy before their time.\nToday’s affairs are unknown by tomorrow;\nHow dare one presume upon next year?\n\n**Again**\nThe path to long life is worth pursuing,\nYet impermanence is better for stilling the heart.\nRoaming like clouds and water, seek good companions,\nAnd naturally, you will encounter true kindred spirits.\n\n**Instructing Disciples**\nEvery thought and worry harms the spirit;\nHow dare one linger in the dust of entanglements?\nCutting off the ten thousand conditions, all is illusion;\nCultivating the one nature, the whole truth is perfected.\n\n**Again**\nOn the mountain of self and others lies the pass of life and death;\nI urge you to topple the mountain of self and others.\nOnce self and others are removed, the heart’s nature becomes good,\nAnd naturally, you leap beyond the pass of life and death.\n\n**Again**\nTo illuminate the original, primal point of light,\nFirst still the monkey and horse of mind and intent.\nWhen heart, essence, and will are pure, the three cinnabar fields unite;\nThe tiger emerges, the dragon coils—four images complete.\n\n**To Li Jichuan**\nHidden talents, keen and sharp, not to be called foolish,\nA true man boldly casts aside glory and splendor.\nDaring to forsake wife and children, a man of true resolve,\nWith the will to cultivate virtue and power, he is called my disciple.\n\n**To Sister Lu**\nA single surge to the heavens, the lamp of wisdom shines bright;\nAuspicious smoke of the Eight Trigrams billows forth.\nThe ninefold refined golden elixir perfects the jade nature,\nAnd the jeweled path of the Ten Continents lies open for travel.\n\n**To Sister Xue of Songxi, the Recluse**\nThe greatest taboo in cultivation is extravagance;\nShatter every attachment to refine wheat and hemp.\nReversing and cycling yin and yang to penetrate creation,\nNaturally, the furnace yields the great cinnabar.\n\n**To Sister Chai**\nGreat cultivation lies in non-action and non-doing;\nWith intent stilled and heart cleansed, the lamp of wisdom shines.\nIlluminating the nine passes to freely enter and exit,\nOn Kunlun’s peak, one ascends in ascent.\n\n**To Sister Yan of Shuangxi, the Recluse**\nWith whole heart enter the Dao and never turn back;\nThe eight flavors of jade nectar nourish the great elixir.\nThe nine luminaries harmonize to form the true jade nature,\nAnd with full merit, one ascends the immortal’s altar.\n\n**Quatrain**\nAfter the capital’s decree sent me forth,\nI returned home, composing this poem to thank the Commander-in-Chief.\nThis rustic from Sanji Mountain, having met with fortune,\nCame to Qin’s land to refine the clouds and waves.\nReflecting, I take myself back home—\nBetter to request a blade in the hall than remain.\n\n**Quatrain**\nSince the decree compelled my departure,\nI had no choice but to bid farewell to the capital, hence this poem.\nOn the stage of fame and profit, one struts with vanity;\nHow could one willingly still the heart and cultivate beyond the world?\nDo not blame me for reeling in my fishing rod;\nI know my humble verse cannot match a mighty hook.\n\n**To An Gong of Hezhong Prefecture**\nMaster An must awaken to the eternal Chang’an,\nAnd turn that awakening inward as contemplation.\nLet heart and intent not follow the monkey and horse’s turns;\nWhen qi and spirit harmonize, the numinous elixir forms.\n\n**Quatrain**\nPassing through Huangyang Inn, I met Scholar Wang,\nWho spoke of Huang Yingqing’s palace examination at fifty-three, with a poem of self-praise.\nI borrowed his rhyme and composed ten quatrains.\nCarrying scrolls of the *Dao and Virtue* and *Yin Talismans*,\nWith star crown and moon mantle, my cloud robe gleams.\nThe world does not recognize this wanderer of mist and rosy clouds,\nMistaking the topknot of a wind-tossed immortal for demonic obstruction.\n\n**Again**\nWith elixir scriptures in my belly, no need to carry them;\nA hempen robe and paper jacket outshine brocade.\nNow I brush my sleeves and return to Ninghai,\nThirteen companions of the Dao roam the clouds with me.\n\n**Again**\nI vow never to carry jade twists or golden willows;\nWith a carefree heart, I wear a short hat and light robe.\nPersecuted by officials for cultivating truth and exhorting goodness,\nThis is the third time I’ve been summoned hence.\n\n**Quatrain**\n\nAt Jingyuan Garrison in Guo Prefecture, as well as the capital and Gan River Garrison, demonic obstructions have already struck thrice.\n\n**Again**\nShoulders bear the weight of layered eaves, yet the heart remains unburdened;\nI cast off ties to children and grandchildren, discarding even my robe.\nAwakened to the sixfold clarity of six-by-six,\nFirst the threefold realization, then the threefold verification.\n\n**Again (Hidden Head)**\n□-like mysteries need not be carried,\n□-transmitted secrets render green robes obsolete.\n□-within, the Great Elixir is perfected,\n□-whirling, the Six Harmonies revolve in threes.\n*(Disassemble one character to begin.)*\n\n**Again**\nFamily burdens weigh heavy on layered eaves,\nShuttling back and forth to trade furs and robes.\nSoon to fall once more into the deep pit,\nHow to kindle the alchemical furnace’s triple fire?\n\n**Again**\nAbandoning all household ties, never to bear them again,\nMouth speaks of mysteries, never of robes.\nClad in felt and wool, the heart holds fast to the Dao,\nOriginally an infant, free from the trinity of cares.\n\n**To Registrar Xue of Wuzhi County**\nSuddenly awakened, the heart bears no fiery trials,\nA hempen robe surpasses silken finery.\nPreserve the principle of purity and non-action,\nRefining essence, qi, and spirit into the Triple Treasure.\n\n**Again**\nLeaping from the fiery pit, no home to bear,\nA carefree straw cloak outshines any robe.\nRoaming the cloud-water path to Penglai Isle,\nThe Great Elixir naturally coalesces in threes.\n\n**Exhorting the Butcher of Qimen**\nThe karmic debt of slaughter must be borne,\nNext life’s rebirth forfeits even a robe.\nTo dissolve this enmity, change your trade—\nFollow the example of Zhao Si and Zhang San.\n\n**To Daoist Friends in Kaizhou**\nThe Horse Wind blows east, the decision comes from the west,\nLet the Daoist lords ponder this riddle.\nReencountering Master Chongyang’s extraordinary net,\nWe ride the clouds together to Penglai.\n\n**Matching a Daoist Friend’s Rhyme**\nSeeing through this floating life, it is thus,\nYet the body’s shadow still feels excessive.\nWherever cloud-roaming leads, the path to mystery opens,\nGuiding all from the waves of suffering.\n\n**Upon Seeing Magistrate Li San of Zizhou Holding a White Plantain Fan**\nThe Horse Wind’s encounter brings boundless ease,\nUnfettered and unrestrained, no belt to bind the waist.\nThe true nature’s fragrance lingers like old red hibiscus,\nThe frost-hearted white plantain unfurls its leaves.\n\n**Continuing Master Geng of Weizhou’s Rhyme**\nThe Horse Wind met a living immortal,\nWithin the cave, perfecting one’s own heaven.\nDragon and tiger coil afar, beholding the moon of nature,\nHorse and ape settle in stillness, savoring the lotus of the heart.\n\n**Quatrain**\nAs Daoist friends from Changle saw me off on my journey,\nWe reached the foot of Solitary Mountain and beheld immortal traces on the stone.\nI then composed a brief ode, presenting it to the tea-tasting assembly and all Daoist friends:\nEach vies to glimpse immortal traces,\nWho would willingly follow in my footsteps?\nWith single-minded transcendence beyond the mundane,\nOne naturally gains the destiny to tread the cloud-path.\n\n**Quatrain**\nTo Vice Magistrate of Laizhou and Attendant Tu Dan, who presented an ancient poem:\nYesterday, I chanced to read it and continued in the original rhyme—may you deign to peruse it.\nThe furnace-refined elixir is priceless,\nIn the hermitage, herbs were never bartered for coin.\nYesterday’s guest arrived with a discerning eye,\nThis morning, I keep company with the white clouds in slumber.\n\n**Matching Ren Gong’s Rhyme**\nThrough mysterious cultivation, the original true self is nurtured,\nVirtue is never solitary—it must have neighbors.\nWith intent purified, one knows the elixir does not leak,\nWith heart cleansed, who would believe the nature is unstained?\n\n**To Master Ma Congshi of Huiguang Hermitage in Xigao Village, Huang County**\nForsaking wealth to accumulate blessings, blessings like mountains,\nYet rebirth remains inescapable, coming and going in cycles.\nOnly when body and mind are pure within and without,\nIs there no birth or death, no swift revolutions.\n\n**Incantation for the Withered Bamboo of Quanzhen Hermitage in Huang County**\nThe Daoist gate is called Longevity,\nIntent on withering and transforming form.\nMay these few stalks remain ever-green,\nNot a single leaf allowed to lose its verdure.\n\n**Delighted by the Living Pine**\nI master the art of life, revolving and generating,\nQi spreads through the body, transmuting form.\nBeyond the window, not only the gentleman’s green,\nBefore the hermitage, the great man’s verdancy brings joy.\n\n**Quatrain**\nOn the third day of the sixth lunar month, Dingmao year of the Dading era,\nDaoist friends of Huang County invited me to reside in the walled enclosure of Jinyu Hermitage,\nwhere six young pines were newly planted. I composed three quatrains:\nIn the sixth month before the hermitage, six pines are planted,\nThe Horse Wind whirls in reverse, as if overturned.\nThrice infusing qi, strength is meager,\nYet the six aspirations revive with great merit.\n\n**Again**\nAt the height of summer’s dog days, pines are planted,\nDaoist friends idly test the Horse Wind.\nI say these six saplings will not survive on their own,\nBut legend speaks of the true merit of the Triple Topknot.\n\n**Again**\nOn the third day of the sixth month, six small pines are planted,\nTheir hues shift in the gusting wind.\nI pray to borrow Chongyang’s qi,\nThat they may fulfill the famed merit of the Triple Topknot.\n\n**Continuing the Rhyme of Cangshi of Dengzhou**\nThreading the pearl requires clarity,\nA gentle fire compels qi to transmit.\nThe nine orifices illuminated, the Dao’s fruit is attained,\nThe Three Lights harmoniously shine, a fine affinity gained.\n\n**Continuing the Rhyme of Zhu Tongjian of Dengzhou**\nMercury and lead meet, hastened by effort,\nInfant and maiden unite without a matchmaker.\nJade tiger and golden dragon soar earthward,\nGolden crow and jade hare descend from heaven.\n\n**Matching Sun Gong’s Rhyme for the Palace Examination**\nI only wish my kin would early abandon splendor,\nSweep the sleeves and resolutely seek the immortal’s abode.\nSleeping in clouds, lying beneath the moon, drinking rosy dawn,\nGolden lotuses with jade blossoms will guide the way.\n\n**Again**\nExhort you to turn back early and know emptiness,\nAbandon learning, preserve non-action, and guard the center.\nWith resolute body and mind like Ma Yu,\nOne naturally drifts in the true wind.\n\n**Again**\nWish you would swiftly awaken the heart,\nCease chasing fame and profit.\nPursue affairs beyond the mundane, beyond the clouds,\nThe rootless withered tree will naturally flourish.\n\n**To Instructor Fan of Ninghai**\nInstructor Fan, a worthy of our village,\nCompetes for profit and fame in youthful vigor.\nIf you grasp the wondrous subtleties of my gate,\nExtinguish the heart and repair the heaven within the cave.\n\n**Returning the Gourd and Back-Cloth to Abbot Jiang, with a Poem**\nImmortal Feng left behind a gourd,\nAbbot Jiang, you are destined to receive it.\nReturning your back-cloth, may you awaken,\nAnd emulate my cloud-water roaming in boundless ease.\n\n**To Musician Yang Hezhi**\nCease displaying cleverness before others,\nBetter to recognize the luminous within your nature.\nCalm the heart, dispel desires—spirit becomes manifest,\nAttaining residence in Penglai’s first palace.\n\n**Exchanging the Long Balustrade for Tian Xi’s Walking Staff**\nA single crooked piece, transformed into dragon material,\nExchanged for a bamboo staff far surpassing wealth.\nEach idly embraces poetic inspiration as it arises,\nCleaving open the true nature to reveal immortal talent.\n\n**To Candle Discipline Master, Gift of a Staff**\nGreat-Uncle Haichan bore a precious staff,\nIts merit complete, cloud-steps transcend the Three Realms.\nTo whom did Ma Feng pass this delight?\nTo Candle Discipline Master, truly at ease.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nThree topknots like Kun arrows—Ma Feng, my brother,\nCloud-water drifting, ever thus.\nCultivating pearls and treasures, I ever regret their scarcity,\nYet gazing at my shadow, I find it all too abundant.\n\n**Composed at Fan Mingshu’s Residence on the Twenty-First Day of the Ninth Month, Renyin Year**\nGrasping the essentials, purifying the numinous terrace,\nMist-locked and smoke-veiled, it would not open.\nReencountering Master Chongyang’s guidance,\nA clear wind blows forth the bright moon.\n\n**Following Qi Dacheng’s Rhyme**\nThe master’s name bears three coiled topknots,\nWith earnest intent, ponder the tender heart.\nNo attachment to the dusty world’s adorned scenes,\nOnly the Dao’s flavor surpasses sweet citrus.\n\n**Again**\nHaving met Fengxian’s three disciples,\nTranscendent beyond things, we ponder together.\nOnly then do I know the joy of ease and freedom,\nAnd truly trust in the bliss of serene contentment.\n\n**Again**\nWith Tan, Liu, and Qiu—three fellow disciples—\nAlongside me, they exhort the world to ponder the Dao.\nPhoenixes dance and simurghs soar, spirit-light piercing,\nTigers roam and dragons coil—great medicine sweet.\n\n**Again**\nWithin the Eight Trigrams furnace, refining six and three,\nThrough mystery and wonder, no need for pondering.\nWater births crimson flames, enhancing divine radiance,\nFire nurtures blue lotuses, dripping dew’s sweetness.\n\n**Again**\nRefining essence, qi, and spirit into three treasures,\nHow could I think of fleeting ledgers or beards to ponder?\nBearing the light, tending the fire-court—no suffering,\nHaving tasted the elixir’s measure, even labor is sweet.\n\n**Again**\nA woman’s heart harbors three venomous serpents,\nThe awakened turn their light inward to ponder.\nExtracting oneself from desire, knowing bitterness upon bitterness,\nIn clarity, savoring the taste—sweetness upon sweetness.\n\n**Again**\nScholars Qi Two and Li Three,\nWith their *zhi*, *hu*, *zhe*, *ye*, cease such pondering.\nPlaying with literary livelihoods, they know it as suffering,\nStudying the Dao’s way of life, they find it sweet.\n\n**Again, to the Young Disciples Below the Hall**\nOx, deer, and sheep carts convey the three,\nWorthy for the young disciples below the hall to ponder.\nAccumulated merit’s jade nectar surpasses sugar’s sweetness,\nCultivated conduct’s peaches rival honey’s richness.\n\n*Volume One of the* Cavernous Mystery’s Golden and Jade Collection *concludes*\n*Volume Two of the* Cavernous Mystery’s Golden and Jade Collection\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains: In Response to Yu Tianxi’s Curved Bamboo Staff**\n\nMen all marvel at forsaking fields and gardens,\nYet this staff, borne by the wind, meets Taiyuan’s favor.\nThe nodal staff, weary of splendor, seeks dismissal—\nA single curved bamboo branch returns to the origin.\n\n---\n\n**For the Daoist Friends of Laiyang Who Prepared Sweet Rice Offerings, Composed Thereupon**\n\nThe offerings sustain the wind-borne, six-fold heartbreak,\nNow consumed, I feel no more attachment.\nWithin the gourd, strange scenes unlike common sights—\nWithin the cavern, a clear sky distinct from the world’s.\n\n---\n\n**Song and Dance**\n\nYoung disciples lead me in idle song and dance,\nNoble gentlemen laugh as I play the fool.\nSeeing through floating life, I treat it as a game,\nIn mad winds, my face conceals an immortal’s guise.\n\n---\n\n**Completion of Merit**\n\nSnapping the reins of fame, free from worldly ties,\nPrying open the locks of gain, untouched by dust.\nA thousand mornings temper jade from Three Streams,\nNine years’ merit complete—an immortal beyond kalpas.\n\n---\n\n**Upon Receiving an Invitation to Laiyang for the Huanglu Ordination Rites, Presented by High Master Li the Preceptor**\n\n**Poetic Rhymes**\n\nTrue mindfulness in the cold of three winters’ intercalary moon,\nHow dare I, in my hut, long for lavish feasts?\nThe preceptor teases me for coming with a hoe—\nLaughing at the lack of alchemical scriptures to moisten the fiery abyss.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at the Abbot’s Lodge of Yutuan in Wendeng, Named “Lodge of Harmonious Encounter”**\n\nFine mountains, fine waters, fine pines and bamboo,\nBefore the Lodge of Harmonious Encounter, they clear my gaze.\nThis blessed land deserves the name “Brocade River,”\nThis grotto heaven befits a celestial dwelling’s roof.\n\n---\n\n**Names of the Pond at the Lodge of Harmonious Encounter in Yutuan**\n\nJade Blossom, Golden Lotus, Dragon’s Roar, Tiger’s Howl,\nTransformed Life, Alchemical Infant, Queen Mother, Grotto Heaven—\nPond of Colored Cloud Bridge, Nine Suns, Perfect Circle.\nJade and gold, dragon and tiger—truly a sight to behold,\nTransforming to cradle the infant, the path made smooth.\nThe Queen Mother’s grotto heaven manifests colored clouds,\nWithin the Nine Suns’ pond, the elixir attains perfection.\n\n---\n\n**Merit Perfected**\n\nSevering passion, cutting love, free from care’s torment,\nExtinguishing thoughts, forgetting schemes, penetrating subtle mystery.\nIntent purified, heart’s incense blooms in three realms,\nLife’s flow connects, the moon of nature shines full.\n\n---\n\n**Quatrains**\n\n**Encountering Magistrate He of Jingyuan Town, Who Asked When I Would Depart**\n\n*[Missing characters reconstructed by dismantling the character 木]*\nGold interspersed, jade blossoms bloom,\nBeyond the *mu*, green youths urge without cease.\nAsking when I’ll set west with the wind—\nI say, “On what day shall I turn eastward?”\n\n---\n\n**Quatrains**\n\n**Du of Jingzhao’s Visit**\n\nOne day, Magistrate Du of Jingzhao came to call, saying: “A decade ago, I once met the Perfected Lord of Chongyang, who left me a quatrain inscribed on an artificial hill, its hidden head dismantling the character *yun*. The poem read:\n*Beneath the clouds, dismantle ‘cloud’—*\n*Yun-yun, Anshi shapes the mountain’s part,*\n*□ carving lone peaks to stand above the throng.*\nI have forgotten the latter two lines. I beg you to complete them for me.” As the request could not be refused, I provisionally filled the command with these lines:\n*□ Yun-yun, Anshi shapes the mountain’s part,*\n*□ carving lone peaks to stand above the throng.*\n*□ Awakened, Taihu’s azure eyes unfold,*\n*□ gazing, the realm of form seems floating clouds.*\n*(Dismantling the character* yun *to begin.)*\n\n**Matching Immortal Tan’s

Chongyang, the Wondrous Practitioner of Compassionate Transformation, drew me from the household—thus I compose this poem to thank my master’s mercy.\n\nThe mountain rustic mused on past freedom,\nAmid the fiery household, worry and sorrow.\nSeeking wealth and rank through myriad hardships,\nEntangling endless grievances in toil.\nPondering life and death—how to escape?\nServing wife and children—when will it end?\nJust as I sought to return, what fortune!\nThe Immortal of the Wind hooked me out to roam the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nThe mountain rustic escaped the fiery pit’s woe,\nEntering the Dao, no longer harmed by sorrow.\nDay by day, carefree in song and chant,\nHour by hour, at ease in joyful praise.\nVerdant mist and purple haze ever his companions,\nBright moon and clear wind his eternal peers.\nGuiding kind souls to the Great Dao,\nCultivating merit to perfection, he ascends to Penglai.\n\n**At Jiande**\nDaoists have no kin yet none are not kin,\nGrieving for all things, grieving for oneself.\nHeart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,\nMind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.\nWorldly realms are constantly swept aside,\nThe flawless garden renews itself daily.\nSilently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,\nHe rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.\n\n**Self-Description**\nThree topknots—yet not out of piety,\nIf asked the reason, how could it be told?\nPromoting the master’s name, one should bear it on the crown,\nConcealing the scholar’s □, the heart remains steadfast.\nWho knows that in this world, the mountain rustic,\nYields not to the unicorn immortal of the celestial court?\nToday I reveal it plainly to you:\nWhen merit is complete, he will tread the clouds and mist.\n\n**Again**\nMyriad entanglements seen through, all return to emptiness,\nFrom this, cultivation bears fruit early.\nThe horse of the mind struggles against deluded love,\nThe monkey of the heart easily falls into folly.\nQi and spirit settle, the golden elixir congeals,\nDragon and tiger clarify, the jade nature glows red.\nI report to fellow practitioners: rely on wondrous use,\nTogether we refine and ascend to Penggong.\n\n**Again**\nDoting on a wife is no wise man,\nLusting after beauty is truly a fool.\nEven slight attachment invites poisonous hands,\nThe merest thought ensnares one in demonic bonds.\nEssence withers, marrow dries, the form grows gaunt,\nQi scatters, spirit wanes, ghosts drag one away.\nI awoke, I startled—best to flee early,\nWhy wait until the funeral drum’s lament?\n\n**Linked Pearls Ode**\nMy heart ails, my heart heals,\nPeople judge right and wrong—who truly knows?\nSearching the wondrous, searching the profound, searching to grasp the true,\nNo contention, no competition, no forced cultivation.\nEver pure, ever still, ever generating goodness,\nDemanding the Dao, demanding practice, demanding salvation from peril.\nCherishing jade, cherishing benevolence, cherishing deliverance,\nRousing the heart, rousing the mind, rousing compassion.\n\n**Regulated Verse**\n**Composed at the Request of Attendant Secretary Wanyan**\nAttendant Secretary Wanyan remarked: \"I did not expect you, Master, would dwell in a thatched hut within walled confines, enduring such carefree simplicity.\" Thus, I composed this.\n\nWithin the Horse Family Alley, the Ma family’s home,\nNorth residence, south garden—nothing to boast.\nWhat glory and splendor are not mere livelihood?\nThis carefree ease is the finest way of life.\nBody and mind depart the vulgar, refining the golden cavern,\nClouds and waters turn to the mysterious, planting jade sprouts.\nSuddenly, the world before my eyes feels narrow,\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon congeal the numinous cinnabar.\n\n**Ode to Autumn Scenery**\nThe year’s finest scene lies in late autumn,\nThe Dipper points west, fire’s course flows.\nVital qi gathers essence, revealing wondrous use,\nFrost flies to meet the season, responding to true cultivation.\nChrysanthemums bloom, ever evoking Tao Qian’s spirit,\nLeaves fall, utterly devoid of Song Yu’s sorrow.\nToward dawn, wind clear, stream bright beneath the moon,\nSomeone awakens and sets forth for Penglai.\n\n**Presented to Liu Bohu of Gaoling, Awaiting the Palace Examination**\nBeyond Pengcheng’s worldly bounds, I search meticulously,\nAt the moment of awakening, all affairs cease.\nSitting or lying, no hindrance to leading the white deer,\nDwelling or walking, unimpeded in guiding the green ox.\nEver pure, ever still—one must recognize this,\nTrue practice, true merit—decisively complete the cycle.\nWhen the ninefold elixir is perfected, depart for Pengdao,\nTo specially seek the ancestral master, Liu Haichan.\n\n**Exhorting Disciples**\nCultivation must abandon lust and wealth,\nBeware the cup’s temptation, lest calamity arise.\nQuickly cast aside the self and others, lay them low,\nHastily strike open the dragon-tiger’s cave.\nThe elixir forms, snow-white pellets gleam in the golden tripod,\nNature congeals, frost-like spheres radiate on the jade terrace.\nWhite clouds ever fly at the grotto’s mouth,\nWhen merit is complete, ascend to Penglai.\n\n**Again**\nContending for fame, competing for profit—endless toil,\nUnnoticed, the visage ages, temples turn gray.\nGreed for wife and children brings bodily suffering,\nHow would one know the Dao’s virtue ever grows?\nI hope you swiftly secure spirit and qi,\nLearn from me, diligently refining lead and mercury’s frost.\nWhen merit and practice accumulate, true nature manifests,\nTogether we shall ascend to Pengzhuang.\n\n**Composed Upon Bringing Li Dacheng into the Walled Abode**\nIn the northwest, by the pavilion stream, a walled abode,\nHere one may well conceal this body.\nBefore my eyes, emerald bamboo—several gentlemen,\nFacing green pines—two great men.\nFlowing water, artificial hills—mere child’s play,\nClear wind, bright moon—do you comprehend?\nIf you can grasp my planting of nine,\nI, within these walls, plant leeks and scallions—thus I dwell here.\nThere is a share of numinous light to ascend to the Jade Capital.\n\n**Presented to Zhang Zhengfu of Danxia Abbey in Qiyang**\nDaoists have no kin yet none are not kin,\nGrieving for all things, grieving for oneself.\nHeart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,\nMind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.\nWorldly realms are constantly swept aside,\nThe flawless garden renews itself daily.\nSilently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,\nHe rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.\n\nParting clouds to summon cranes, I visit Twin Groves,\nCradling a wuwei thunder-zither in my arms.\nBefore Flower Calyx Tower, I meet a beneficent friend,\nBy Kunming Pool’s shore, I encounter a true confidant.\nThe Three Fields’ treasures illumine the spirit’s chamber,\nThe meridian’s infant emerges in brocade quilts.\nIn my palm rests a single night-shining pearl—\nNo need for foot’s labor to tread jade peaks.\n\n**Presented to Li Dacheng, with respects to Abbot Jinggong**\n\nWithin encircling walls, most serene,\nThe Dao’s abode—pure emptiness—claims two rafters.\nDeeply I cherish the bamboo’s gentlemanly resolve,\nHow I admire the pine’s aged, virtuous wisdom.\nEight channels’ limpid waters distill as clear wine,\nFive Peaks’ linked summits rise like verdant lotuses.\nThough Confucian scholars serve as beneficent friends,\nWithout the Three Teachings united, no harmony is complete.\n\n**Presented to Master Zhang of Jingyang**\n\nAt sixty-four, the hexagrams near their close,\nSuddenly awakened, heart reduced to ashes, I wander beyond the mundane.\nSeeking me, you submit to true awakening,\nDelving into mysteries, probing subtleties, you cultivate with devotion.\nYour topknot parted like cloud-and-aurora companions,\nYour hands raised like wind-and-moon comrades.\nBowing, you further clarify the precious principle—\nNaturally, you shall depart to attend Penglai’s isles.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for the Old Man of the Moon**\n\nHaving known the non-dual Dao precedes heaven,\nYour tally matches the mountain rustic’s most wondrous words.\nSimurgh and phoenix soar to nest in jade caverns,\nTiger and dragon roar to enter golden gates.\nWithin the gourd, heaven and earth’s marrow is refined,\nWithin the grotto, the roots of heaven and earth are shaken.\nA single millet-pearl cradles sun and moon—\nDim yet luminous, neither dark nor dull.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Gao Neifeng**\n\nThough you speak of officialdom’s dusty clamor,\nWhy must you rush through this life in haste?\nSwiftly sever the ten thousand entanglements like snapped stalks,\nLest your singular nature drift like floating duckweed.\nEmerging from the sea of suffering, the heart awakens,\nDispersing floating clouds, the moon shines clear.\nWhen merit and practice reach perfection, you transcend the upper realms—\nOnly then do you know Ma Yu’s initiation of cinnabar sincerity.\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Ning Bogong’s Poem on Gifting Silver Dates**\n\nSeven-jeweled, exquisitely wrought, treasures of the hidden realm,\nBearing rare fruits and extraordinary greens.\nExternally, powdered husks wholly encase jade,\nInternally, water-crystal forms half-veiled in frost.\nRefined with civil and martial fires to enhance their savor,\nBoiled in pagoda-tree broth to deepen their fragrance.\nI imagine you first tasted this delight—\nUpon receiving your gift, this mountain rustic welcomes the true yang.\n\n**Visiting Abbot Zhang Detong of Xiulin for the Palace Examination**\n\nBeneath Gui Peak lies Xiulin Village,\nWhere a monk of refined tastes delights in the Daoist.\nParting clouds to summon

Confucian Zhang and the suffering son awaken,\nThe Three Teachings shall converse of everlasting spring.\n\n**Wu Zhengxin, Zhao Shuangxin, and Wei Lin Follow Me to Visit Gui Peak**\n\nThree gentlemen accompany me on a journey with the Nine Immortals,\nTwelve celestial cycles, twelve revolutions.\nRelying on nine-three for wondrous efficacy,\nCapable of transmuting two-six into elegance.\nNurture

Huxian, whose lofty aspirations sought me out:\n\nThe world’s net ensnares fame and gain,\nDust’s cage shrouds right and wrong.\nInto the mountains I go to gather herbs,\nFollowing the clouds, I

Collection**\n*Volume Six of* **The Cave of Mystery: Gold and Jade Collection**\n\n**Six-Character Poems**\n\n**On the Pavilion of Contented Aging**\nI have a cup of fragrant wine,\nTo share with a kindred spirit.\nGazing upon the bustling world,\nNone compare to the carefree rustic elder.\n\n**Also**\nFallen into dissipation, indulging in wine,\nDrunk and sober—such states have been.\nIf one asks my lineage,\nMy ancestral home is in Fufeng, the elder of Shen.\nMy ancestor’s name was Jue, styled Shen-sou.\n\n**Matching the Previous Rhyme in Tribute to Wei, Magistrate of Longzhou**\nFond of drinking the immortal’s wine of longevity,\nFond of seeking the \"something\" within \"nothing.\"\nFond of revering the heart as one’s teacher,\nFond of becoming a transcendent elder beyond the mundane.\n\n**Following Master Hu’s Rhyme**\n□Zhang’s words are wondrous,\n□All worldly chatter.\n□Better to say nothing,\n□In silence, the marvelous speech.\n\n*(Lines begin with the character \"口\" [mouth], deconstructed.)*\n\n**In Praise of Master Shi**\nMaster Shi encountered his fate,\nEncountered Chongyang.\nChongyang transmitted the teaching,\nTransmitted the Mystery and the Yellow.\nThe profound principle of Mystery and Yellow,\nNever to be forgotten.\nWithin, he upheld cultivation,\nWithout, he severed worldly heat and cold.\nWater and fire achieved harmony,\nSun and moon conjoined their light.\nThe dragon chants in the Li position,\nThe tiger roars in the Kan chamber.\nWood and metal stand apart,\nInfant and maiden unite in round and square.\nThe elixir pellet is savored,\nIts flavor known, its fragrance perceived.\nThe divine elixir coalesces in perfection,\nGleaming with crystalline radiance.\nThe immortal of the wind comes to ferry him,\nManifesting auspicious signs.\nFor three days they sang and danced,\nThen bid farewell to the streets and lanes.\nOnly saying, \"I depart,\nHastening to Peng’s estate.\"\nReturning to the hermitage,\nHe suddenly passed away.\nOnlookers gathered in crowds,\nFor the event was extraordinary.\nHis true nature, one and numinous,\nTook its place in the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Song**\n\n**Song of Salvation** *(To the tune of Su Dongpo’s verse)*\n\nI harbor no mind of going or staying—where then could it dwell?\nUnshaken, unmoved, within the realm of the Three Yangs.\nWith single intent transcendent, seeking nothing without,\nAll affairs forgotten, ever turning inward in reflection.\nA carefree soul unbound, a man of fallen fortunes,\nI roam at ease, content in pristine poverty.\nMy body like a wild crane, untouched by snares,\nMy mind like a lone cloud, unstained by dust.\nNo merit, no dharma—my heart sits in meditation,\nIdle chatter and baseless talk pass by my ears.\nWhen people come beseeching me for rites of deliverance,\nAgain and again, I cannot turn them away.\nEncircled by walls, I observe the summer retreat, applying blessings,\nDaily prayers and a single meal—no lowly act.\nSilently reciting the true scripture, I arouse compassion,\nRescuing the suffering with a shout, flinging open hell’s gates.\nLonely souls and stagnant spirits shed their shackles,\nSinging wildly, dancing in chaotic joy.\nBy this merit they gain rebirth,\nAuspicious clouds guide them to the Jade Pool feast.\n\nI see worldly affairs as utterly hollow,\nYet I admonish mortals with stern exhortation:\n\"Seek wealth, seek wealth—but hold fast to righteousness,\nFor unrighteous wealth is sharp as a blade.\nBetter to see through worldly entanglements,\nBoldly forsake wife and child, be a true man.\nNever forget your original resolve, nor falter in retreat,\nDay by day, month by month, follow my example.\nSeeing yet seeing nothing, hearing yet hearing nothing,\nNot seeing, not hearing—yet attaining true sight and sound.\nThe Dharma-body is formless, yet form manifests,\nThe Dharma-drum is soundless, yet sound resounds.\nExiting and entering doors, I am welcomed and sent off,\nIn welcoming and sending, the wondrous function is revealed.\nMaster Chongyang transmitted this to Shantong,\nNow I pass it on to you all.\nNaturally, rosy clouds stream from the chariot’s crossbar,\nNaturally, one gazes toward the office of immortals.\nAt this point, east and west are no longer divided,\nWhat worry is there of lacking a share in Fufeng’s lineage?\nIf one awakens to this profoundly profound principle,\nThen Penglai and Yingzhou lie within a glance’s reach.\"\n\n**Song of Compassion** *(Hidden-Head Acrostic)*\n□ At last, fortunately meeting Chongyang’s immortal,\n□ I forgot all, half-dragging my sleeves.\n□ My cap askew, emulating my master’s way,\n□ Like a sheep that eats not, no border outcast.\nNo border outcast,\n□ The secret method transmitted at thirteen,\n□ My heart of halberds long since dissolved,\n□ Smoke extinguished, the three auspicious topknots gone.\n□ Practicing great goodness, arousing compassion,\n□ Mindful of the grieving, diligently exhorting the world.\n□ The numinous remains unstained, forever pure,\n□ Qi harmonized, ever so gently.\nEver so gently,\n□ Planting in the cinnabar field, the immortal’s heels follow.\n□ Silk and fine cloth resist wind and frost,\n□ Bestowing on the poor, tattered though it be.\n□ The brush never encroaches on profit or fame,\n□ The tongue need not speak of dogs or swine.\n□ A numinous object appears, spitting crimson radiance,\n□ Revealing the teachings through poems and songs.\n□ A crane arrives, sparse and distant, to summon me,\n□ How could it refuse me, who vows so earnestly?\n□ Thus I perform rites to deliver the departed,\n□ Their resolve pitiable, their compassion worthy.\n□ Silently praying to my original true master,\n□ I report this to the underworld’s courts.\n□ Below, lonely souls and stagnant spirits revive,\n□ Above, they are ferried across like boats on water.\n□ Their voices sing like birds of the nine marshes,\n□ Where green simurghs and red phoenixes cry.\n\n*(The acrostic begins with the character \"人\" [person].)*\n\n**Song of Universal Salvation** *(Hidden-Head Acrostic)*\n□ Colored waters flow between beams and pillars,\n□ Where the crow and hare of sun and moon come.\n□ Sincerely guarding the Dao, attaining true joy,\n□ My intent ever pure, my wondrous words flow.\nMy wondrous words flow,\n□ Profound discussions transmit the mystery to Zhong and Lü.\n□ The secret method again passed to Wang, Feng, and the immortals,\n□ Shantong, having met them, gained deep delight.\n□ Gazing at the jade maiden singing in the cave,\n□ Rejoicing as the golden infant dances in the void.\nDances in the void,\n□ For years in Shaanxi’s right, dwelling in humble walls.\n□ Months passed like monkeys halting, horses pausing,\n□ Smoke extinguished, dragons entwining tigers.\n□ Suddenly, a decree arrived in Shandong,\n□ Virtuous people came to pray for inner blessings.\n□ My cap straightened, I performed rites of deliverance,\n□ Applying blessings to repay my homeland.\n□ All souls and spirits rise from the Yellow Springs,\n□ Wandering through clouds to return to the Purple Court.\nReturn to the Purple Court,\n□ Where cloud-cranes do not reject me.\n□ Ah! Universally saved from the wheel of rebirth,\n□ All children ascend as immortals, none left behind.\n\n**Song of Sighing**\nZhiyang’s Daoist friend visited Wendeng,\nNot to seek blossoms or chase emerald splendor.\nHe spoke of Magistrate Zai sending a letter,\nInviting me to preside over rites to save the departed.\nTo save the departed—\nA most noble task,\nYet some small matters must be clarified.\nI fear later generations will imitate in vain,\nRushing to feasts and rites without cultivating the Dao.\nWithout cultivating the Dao,\nHow can one attain immortality?\nTo attain immortality, one must refine qi ceaselessly,\nReverse the waterwheel, let the lamp-tree fall,\nWhirl through the cosmos, perfecting the numinous nature.\nWhen the numinous nature is perfected,\nOne must accumulate merit,\nTurning people’s heads to return to purity.\nWith compassion, rescue the drowning, build bridges,\nWith empathy, aid the perilous, erect ladders.\nErecting ladders,\nBecoming a ferryboat,\nFerrying beings beyond, engaging in true cultivation.\nYet why do Daoist friends seek rites of deliverance,\nDiligently praying for me to save the imprisoned dead?\nTo save the imprisoned dead—\nWhat is this?\nI am a man of non-action, of purity and stillness,\nNever chasing rites or invoking the Heavenly Worthy,\nUnskilled in ascending altars to perform rituals.\nPerforming rituals—\nSummoning the yellow-crowned,\nPurifying myself to ascend the altar, turning inward in contemplation.\nWhere I apply blessings, encircled by walls,\nI silently pray to my original master, the Heavenly Immortal Official.\nThe Heavenly Joy Official—\nChongyang himself—\nSighing, he arouses compassion, transforming with pity.\nA thousand layers of hell’s shackles open,\nAll departed spirits’ sins are forgiven.\nSins forgiven,\nTogether with lonely souls,\nThey roam the Purple Court, entering the gates of immortals.\nIn the Land of No Night, they attain true joy,\nIn the Cave of Eternal Spring, they hold golden cups.\n\n**Matching Hu the Preceptor’s Rhyme**\nThe Perfected of Chongyang sought a friend,\nTraveling east to Ninghai.\nThe lazy man with three topknots chose immortality,\nJourneying west to Chang’an.\nThe great road of Chang’an—\nWhat is it like?\nFit for the carefree,\nApt for abandoning the infant.\nHaving grasped the profound essence,\nOne should restore the body’s form.\nDrawing and adding, employing and arranging,\nNext in sequence, step by step.\nFlying birds and running hares,\nBoth play in pristine whiteness.\nSmoke vanishes, fire extinguishes,\nSharpness blunted, strength subdued.\nSevering afflictions,\nWashing away dust.\nThe heart unstained,\nTeeth free from decay.\nGold flowers to be admired,\nJade trees to be cultivated.\nFire nurtures the grass of wisdom,\nWater nourishes the sprouts of the numinous.\nEver let the numinous flame blaze,\nNever let the spirit-water overflow.\n\nKeep the life-lamp ever bright and clear,\nNever let the nature-candle sink and fade.\nSeek those of like heart and like virtue,\nDiscussing with support and sequence in turn.\nThe Three Corpses bow and submit within the square inch,\nThe Six Bandits struggle to reach the Nine Heavens.\nTo turn the sun and moon within the pot,\nOne must invert the mountains within the cave.\nAttaining the natural, desires scatter like stars,\nAttaining the natural, self and others dissolve like stars.\nThe great elixir, pure and numinous in the jade crucible,\nThe fetal immortal sings and dances on the Jasper Terrace.\nHow lamentable is the clamor of fame and profit,\nHow lamentable the sorrow of life and death.\nBest to thoroughly examine worldly ties together,\nLest the walking skeleton briefly stray in madness.\nResolve to refine the form like withered wood,\nResolve to subdue the heart like cold ashes.\nOne day, when the ninefold elixir is complete,\nRide the clouds to Penglai together.\n\n**Method of Establishing the Body**\nThe method of establishing the body is clearly revealed:\nFirmly restrain the horse of intent,\nTightly lock the monkey of the heart.\nSever stinginess and greed,\nSubdue self and others.\nBe cautious in speech,\nGuard against faults of the mouth.\nDo not stir up waves,\nDo not kindle smoke and fire.\nSteal moments of leisure amid busyness,\nHide within the clamor.\nCultivate benevolence and accumulate virtue,\nDispel calamities and extinguish misfortunes.\nYield to others and advance the self—\nThis too bears the fruit of immortality.\n\n**[On the Ten Perfections]**\nThe ten perfections are internal matters,\nNot phenomena before the eyes.\nTruly pure, truly still,\nThey are naturally attained:\nA flowing rosy glow in the nape,\nA radiant light in the eyes,\nA surge of harmony in the ears,\nA jade pillar in the nose,\nSweet nectar in the mouth,\nTrue fire in the heart,\nThe Yellow River flowing backward below the navel,\nWood and metal turning with the waves,\nHeaven and earth naturally conjoined,\nThe ten perfections complete—nature becomes effortlessly refined.\n\n**Linked Verses**\nBreaking free from the reins of fame, the guest of the Three Isles,\nWrenching open the lock of profit, the immortal of the Ten Continents.\n\nThe path to longevity demands repair,\nThe root of deathlessness must be tempered and refined.\nCultivate the heart as a guest of eternal life,\nRefine the nature as one who lives yet is dead.\nRefine the qi—qi harmonized, the spirit leaps;\nCultivate the true—true purity, the nature gleams.\nFocus the heart to study the Dao, one must penetrate the Dao;\nSteel the will to refine immortality, one is bound to meet immortals.\nWho knows that divine brilliance surpasses talent’s glow?\nI find the heart’s clarity outshines the eyes’ brightness.\nWhen the heart is free from clinging, the spirit’s radiance shines;\nWhen qi flows without stagnation, the nature’s wisdom is complete.\n\nIn water, flames burst forth—three elixirs coalesce;\nWithin fire, a lotus blooms—a single nature awakens.\nThe man who studies the Dao bears no self;\nThe hero who refines immortality harbors no human sentiment.\nForget the surface, awaken within the heart;\nWithin the Dao, penetrate the wondrous and the profound.\nIn dreams, the shadowless sword was once grasped;\nThrough the Dharma, the heart of attachment is cast away.\nAmid dust, unstained—awakening in the heart;\nOn the Dao’s path, mystery is penetrated—nature becomes numinous.\n\nWithin yin, yang is concealed—yang blazes resplendent;\nWithin life, the nature is nurtured—the nature gleams.\nTo study the Dao, one must rely on a heart resolute and fierce;\nTo refine immortality, the will must be steadfast and unyielding.\nThe stone maiden plays the flute—phoenixes dance;\nThe clay ox enters the sea—tiger and dragon harmonize.\nThe jade maiden, delicate and radiant, strikes the dragon’s horn;\nThe golden infant, clear and unbound, rides the tiger’s waist.\nBeneath the Jasper Pool, the green luan dances;\nWithin the Palace of Langyuan, the white crane soars.\nIn the sleeve, a green serpent—a three-foot sword;\nWithin the abdomen, a white tiger—the nine-times-returned elixir.\n\nWithin the Azure Radiance Palace, red snow is gathered;\nBefore the Jasper Cliff, the Red Pine is admired.\nHeart pure, intent clear—the path to heaven’s hall;\nIntent scattered, heart wild—the gate to hell’s abyss.\nThe pivot of transformation relies on the power of non-action;\nCreation depends entirely on the work of purity and stillness.\nWith a single sleeve, sweep away the world of dust;\nThe three elixirs coalesce—one becomes a Great Luo immortal.\nSeize the primal, numinous essence;\nBehold the original truth of the primordial beginning.\nSix by six, yin dissolves—the elixir glows resplendent;\nThree by three, yang gathers—the nature shines with spirit.\n\nThe root of clouds, the bone of water—return to the golden crucible;\nThe marrow of mercury, the essence of lead—gather in the jade furnace.\nSwiftly cast the self into the mountain’s embrace;\nHastily pierce open the cave of dragon and tiger.\nTrample the tortoise and serpent—true living practice;\nHarmonize dragon and tiger—a fine livelihood.\nIf you wish for the maiden and infant to play within the crucible,\nYou must cause the sun and moon to share the same palace.\nWithin the crucible, refined gold births five hues;\nWithin the furnace, fine jade coalesces into three lights.\n\nThe hare flees, the crow flies—plunging into the sea of qi;\nDragon’s roar, tiger’s howl—entering the capital of spirit.\nTightly bind the heart-monkey—no leakage in the elixir;\nFirmly seize the intent-horse—the nature becomes clear.\nSubdue the heavenly pass and earthly axis;\nPivot the Kan tiger and Li dragon.\nWhen the monkey rages and the horse falters, the Dao is hard to achieve;\nWhen the tiger withdraws and the dragon coils, the true is easily seen.\n\nFewer matters in the heart, fewer worries;\nMore dust on the nature, more afflictions.\nWithin having, having—yet not having, having;\nWithin non-having, non-having—yet having, non-having.\n\n**[Returning to the Mountain Melody]**\n\nYu, together with the monk Master Zhulü and Palace Examination graduate Fan Shouqing, once burned incense and sat in quietude at the Three Teachings Hall north of the prefectural city. Master Wang arrived bearing a qin and played it. As the sun slanted westward, he performed the qin melody *Returning to the Mountain Melody*, for Yu harbored the intent to return to the True.\n\n\"To be capable of non-doing is to be capable of all-doing;\nTo be capable of non-knowing is to be capable of all-knowing.\nWho would not pursue this Dao once they know it?\nYet who truly understands it when they pursue it?\n\nThe wind sighs, sighs—leaves take flight;\nThe wild geese cry, cry—southward they return.\nAlas, the world of men—days and months hasten;\nAge nears death, yet still they cling to folly.\n\nGrieved, the human world—my soul would take wing;\nAlas, the human world—my heart would shatter.\nHard to resolve—this world is not my home;\nI point to the green mountains—best to return early.\n\nBy night, the green mountains—bright moon soars;\nBy dawn, the green mountains—bright moon returns.\nHunger fed by rosy clouds, thirst slaked by streams;\nCut off from the world—none know me.\n\nNo-knowing, no-doing—\nThis heart extinguished, what doubt remains?\n\nSuddenly, twin blossoms fly in the celestial court;\nAscending the Three Palaces, I wander the Purple Tenuity.\"\n\n**[In Praise of Shedding the Form]**\nIn the *guimao* year, the Master’s Father, Perfected One Danyang, one day took up his brush and wrote, calling it *In Praise of Shedding the Form*. That very year, he indeed shed his mortal coil, and so it is collected here.\n\n\"The light that guards the body shines with uncommon radiance;\nThe beast that guards the body—wind and clouds attend before and behind.\nGreat is the ascent to Perfection—shedding the form to attain longevity.\n\nAzure locks, green brows,\nCrimson cheeks, pale skin.\nLike the dragon, he changes his bones;\nLike the cicada, he sloughs his skin.\nNot altering his nature—why leave behind an empty robe?\n\nStill as if asleep, he lies upon the mat and departs.\nGreat is the ascent to Perfection—the path leads into the azure depths.\n\nUnicorns follow the crimson regalia,\nPhoenixes draw the vermilion carriage.\nThe simurgh’s cry, jade pendants tinkling,\nTreading the void, stepping upon clouds.\nExalted, he receives the true decrees,\nAscending to the Jade Celestial Court.\n\nHow long the celestial path—\nThe immortals take flight.\nStriking metal, tapping stone,\nScattering flowers, burning incense.\nThe sound stirs the Three Realms,\nMultitudes gather from the ten directions.\nAll demons revere him,\nThe Six Dings are startled and flee.\n\nThe numinous embryo now complete,\nFortunate to be free of calamity and blight.\nYet gazing back at the pines and cypresses—\nNot for the sake of distant years.\nMountains may crumble in time,\nSeas may turn to fields.\nLong earth, enduring heaven—\nForever ranked among the Immortals.\"\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the* Treasury of Daoist Gold and Jade *is complete.*\n*The Seventh Scroll of the* Treasury of Daoist Gold and Jade.\n\n**On Gratitude**\n\nThe grace of heaven and earth, sun and moon, father and mother,\nCannot lift me from the depths of sinking.\nBrothers and sisters—brief acquaintances,\nWives and children—even less akin.\nFortune met the Wind Immortal, who transmitted secret formulas,\nEnabling Ma Yu to attain good causes.\nSevering passions, cutting attachments, harmonizing dragon and tiger,\nAbandoning cares, forgetting schemes, birthing phoenix and qilin.\nWithin jade, gold is born; the elixir coalesces as treasure,\nIn water, fire is nurtured; qi settles the spirit.\n\nThe master’s grace runs deep—impossible to repay,\nI vow to circle the walls in death, refining the utmost truth.\n\n---\n\n**Lyrics: Tenfold Gratitude (Originally \"Auspicious Partridge\")**\n\n**First Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nBeyond the world’s dust, a life rare to hear of:\nTempering the jade furnace with snow from three ravines,\nPerfecting the golden tripod with clouds from a single stream.\nDragons ought to bathe in fire,\nFierce tigers may burn in water.\nA single grain of divine elixir shines through jade,\nIts numinous radiance peerless, transcending all.\n\n**Second Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nI swear to cultivate, resolve to refine the heart:\nFire’s flames extinguished, fire nurtures wood,\nMercury exhausted, water gives birth to gold.\nWood and gold in three realms open the mysterious path,\nWater and fire flow as one, forming a treasure peak.\nWith enduring vision, the great elixir is complete, never leaking,\nBearing clouds, I depart, free from rising and sinking.\n\n**Third Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nRefining the numinous embryo in the Jade Capital:\nLead and mercury simmer—first come signs,\nTiger and dragon mate—how could there be no sound?\nThree luminaries shine together, surpassing the three meditations,\nFive peaks merge as one, issuing from the five phases.\nWhen the three-five elixir is complete, true creation is achieved,\nNaturally stepping upon clouds to visit Penglai.\n\n**Fourth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nHeaven and earth gathered into the treasure vase,\nSun and moon, mountains and rivers enhance its splendor,\nTiger and dragon, infant and maiden find peace.\nLight and clear, heavy and turbid—yin and yang aligned,\nVast and deep, lofty and bright—all things imbued with spirit.\nThe radiant red elixir completes nature and life,\nTranscendent, riding a crane across the celestial court.\n\n**Fifth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nI swear never to be tainted by wine, lust, anger, or wealth.\nFirst, I drive away the solar crow,\nThen firmly seize the lunar hare.\nThe moon’s wheel shines anew, without wax or wane,\nThe sun’s brilliance intensifies, without dimming or sinking.\nWhen merit is full and the elixir complete, where shall I go?\nBeyond the cloudy Han, free from yin and yang.\n\n**Sixth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nUnfettered, carefree, untouched by dust:\nSeeing through the false body as truly false,\nProbing the true nature as truly real.\nOnly then knowing the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,\nOnly then realizing the unspiritual is the source of the spiritual.\nWith the pure elixir complete, I ride the red phoenix,\nIn the Great Luo Heaven, savoring eternal spring.\n\n**Seventh Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nGrasping emptiness, stilling the mercury of death:\nCattle and sheep fill the path, lying in my way,\nA pavilion of wind and moon proves one’s purity.\nClear and pure, hard to be deceived by the false,\nPure and clear, easy to perceive the real.\nWhen the dragon-tiger elixir is complete, no nine revolutions needed,\nNaturally, eternally, I become an immortal.\n\n**Eighth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nReversing yin and yang, relying on refinement and cooking:\nFire descends, water ascends, casting snow-like waves,\nDragon’s roar, tiger’s howl, unleashing thunderous sounds.\nThe jade furnace’s auspicious snow layers upon layers,\nThe golden tripod’s propitious light softly arises.\nThe priceless elixir complete, no aging or death,\nOn the path of long life, the dharma-body is light.\n\n**Ninth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nMind pure, heart clear, the path smooth and level:\nUsing non-action as creation,\nNot relying on effort for enterprise.\nJust like luring dragon and tiger,\nOr harmonizing maiden and infant.\nWith the elixir of living joy complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,\nWhere Master He and my teacher come from afar to welcome me.\n\n**Tenth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nShattering the golden willow, the jade shackles of emotion:\nIn the Gate of Enduring Vision, cultivating endurance,\nOn the Path of Long Life, attaining longevity.\nDim and silent, limpid and deep,\nVast and obscure, pure and clear.\nAt dawn, the elixir complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,\nWhere Master Chongyang comes from afar to welcome me.\n\n---\n\n**Expressing Feelings #1**\nNo entanglements in the realm of profit and fame,\nNo flames of self and others in the crowd.\nWith intent, I wander mountains—upon their ridges,\nWith joy, I delight in waters—beside their clouds.\nComing and going, drifting like a solitary crane,\nStaying or leaving, serene as a cicada.\nHow many can attain such carefree ease?\nLet others say I live as a divine immortal.\n\n**Begging in the Streets**\nSpare a coin, good people, to aid the poor and forge karmic ties.\nSilently, it returns a hundredfold,\nOpenly, it nurtures my three fields.\nAbandoning stinginess opens the heart’s ground,\nSevering attachment unlocks the wondrous mystery.\nOne day, awakened, I leave the sea of suffering,\nCarefree beyond the world, cultivating immortality together.\n\n**Exhorting Disciples**\nThe Daoist’s livelihood does not intrude,\nEach seeks their own clothing and food.\nAvoid idle words and quarrels,\nLet go of worldly affairs and worldly cares.\nProbe the profound, abandon thoughts—dragons follow tigers,\nSeek the hidden, forget schemes—water nurtures gold.\nPurify the colored body to preserve the dharma-body,\nWhen the elixir in the furnace is ripe, step upon the jade peak.\n\n**A Daoist Friend Asks If One Can Cultivate at Home**\nTo be an immortal yet cling to a wife is folly,\nStealing moments from busyness to seek the Dao.\nThe gate of purity remains unrecognized,\nLustful desires and deceptive arts seize the heart.\nSeeking both family and Dao to be perfect—how?\nHow to savor the sweetness of solitude?\nDo not wait for Fengdu’s summons to arrive,\nReturn early beyond the world to dwell in a cloudy hermitage.\n\n**Presented to Marshal Li**\nMake your body a cinnabar mound,\nWithin, ever wandering clouds and waters.\nLi and Kan palaces exchange as true midnight and noon,\nJia and Geng positions shift, erasing spring and autumn.\nThe five phases and four images are all without use,\nYet the three isles and ten continents have their reasons.\nWith merit and conduct unblemished, clouds and cranes guide you,\nIn the Great Luo Heaven, ranked among the immortals.\n\n**Meeting Daoist Friends During the Cold Food Festival**\nCold food forbids fire, restrains the mind-monkey,\nTrue breath regulated, eternally continuous.\nNot roaming clouds and waters along fragrant grass paths,\nHow could body and mind cling to the apricot blossom sky?\nDo not become a tomb-bound ghost,\nLearn from me to cultivate as an immortal beyond the world.\nOne day, the great elixir completes its nine revolutions,\nAscending the void—why need to swing on a swing?\n\n**Presented to Zhang Shubiao of Jingyang**\nAt sixty-four, the hexagrams near their end,\nSuddenly awakened, heart like cold ashes, leaving the worldly.\nSeeking me to probe the true and return to right awakening,\nProbing the profound, seeking the hidden, practicing cultivation.\n\n**Presented to Master Duan**\n\nBrow parted like forked chignons, companion of cloud and rosy dawn,\nHands revealed in clasped fists, comrade of wind and moon.\nBowing deeply to clarify the principle of cherishing,\nNaturally one may depart to attend Penglai Isle.\n\n**Presented to Master Jiang**\n*Breaking the character \"段\" (Duan) to begin*\n\nBeyond the world, Master □ enjoys a fine livelihood,\nWith □ fire meeting to congeal the great cinnabar.\n□ maiden lingers to behold the great elixir,\n□ ox roars in play with numinous blossoms.\n□ clouds spread earthward, the alchemical furnace blazing,\n□ child gazes heavenward, azure eyes radiant.\n□ with three lifetimes, you awaken,\n□ within, untroubled, you tread mist and rosy clouds.\n\n**Presented to Master Jiang**\n\nThe Abbot of Changchun Hermitage in Ninghai, Master Jiang,\nAlong with fellow Daoist friends, pitying my difficulty in walking,\nConstructed a handcart for me.\nOn the day the work was completed, he came to Fushan to deliver it,\nSo I composed these words in gratitude.\n\nBlue ox, white deer, and yellow sheep,\nSteadily pull the cloud chariot day and night.\nBearing the weight of heaven and earth, ever in union,\nPushing the sun and moon, their light eternally intertwined.\nThe Dharma wheel resounds, entering the dark cavern,\nThe cloud carriage jingles, entering the Daoist sanctuary.\nIf you awaken to the nine revolutions of the elixir,\nNaturally you shall succeed Ma Danyang.\n\n**Presented to the Daoist Assembly at the Huanglu Offering in Wendeng County**\n\nOn Kunyu’s three-chignon steeds, Ma and Feng sing,\nMeeting those who cultivate immortality, weary of worldly affairs.\nI dwell in non-action to fulfill my original vow,\nWhile others seek memorial rites, tormented by suffering.\nThrough empowerment, I assist the offering within these humble walls,\nDelivering departed souls to the Great Luo Heaven.\nFortunate are the lingering spirits and solitary souls,\nAll together transcended in boundless joy.\n\n**Again**\n\nSince first encountering the joy of pure poverty,\nDelighted to dwell within these enclosing walls, fearing the dust of the world.\nRefining qi, qi harmonizes, spirit clings to qi,\nNurturing spirit, spirit is refreshed, qi settles spirit.\nMagistrate Zai invited me to perform memorial rites,\nThis humble one, with compassionate heart, upholds the good cause.\nDelivering departed souls to ascend the upper realms,\nAll solitary spirits and lingering souls turn toward the True.\n\n**Burning Heart Incense** *(originally titled \"Xingxiangzi\")*\n\nHusband and wife parted—\nWho are you? Who am I?\n\nWith their household—originally no kinship,\nAll through matchmakers’ words, we bound in marriage.\nThen fell to folly’s cliff, craving wealth and property,\nOnly dreading poverty.\nYou too lost in dust, I too lost in dust.\nManaging family ties—burning oneself in fire.\nDrawn by their affection, enslaved in my heart and spirit.\nFortunate to meet Master Fengxian,\nParting ways, each cultivating the True.\nGoing forth to teach on the streets\n\nMaster Chongyang, truly a true teacher,\nInstructed Ma Yu to live as a beggar.\nHis livelihood pure and still, his path non-action.\nStroking the heart’s zither, harmonizing dragon and tiger,\nDrinking the elixir pellet.\nVowing never to return to Shandong,\nFor his destiny lay in Guanzhong.\nThus blending light, mingling with the world as time flows.\nIdly wielding the bamboo skimmer,\nOnly wishing others to know.\nHoping not to return too late,\nLest time pass in vain—hasten your practice.\n\nTo all fellow disciples\n\nNot yet reaching Danyang,\nHow dare I claim to be a teacher?\nTo those of like mind, I reveal a little.\nThe wondrous place of longevity\nSeems to require some effort.\nGathering five-colored clouds,\nThe qi of the Five Phases, the tablets of the Five Directions.\nA rooster born in the west, a rabbit born in the east—\nSuch is the time of wood and metal’s separation.\nIn purity, the meaning is grasped;\nIn clarity, the heart knows.\nWishing for early purity of heart,\nEarly clarity of intent,\nEarly practice.\n\nExhorting Brother Xiang to beg for leftovers\n\nA tumbleweed beyond the world, starving within,\nSuddenly hearing the temple bell strike—\nBegging for leftovers, praying to the Mysterious Origin.\nRemember, those who leave the household\nHave no home, no land—Daoist poverty.\nHemp and wheat fill the meal,\nDispelling corpse-worms.\nAwakening to an empty heart,\nA full belly, harmony within.\nThe infant rides the tiger, the maiden mounts the dragon.\nIn the realm of emptiness,\nComing without trace, going without shadow.\n\n**Again**\n\nSudden enlightenment, carefree—\nThe causes of leaving the world.\nHearing only of others\nBuilding feast-halls,\nOne stretches out one’s arms,\nStanding at the side—\nBegging for leftover broth,\nSeeking scraps of rice,\nPassing the remnant years.\nShameless, unabashed,\nQuenching fire, dispelling smoke.\nThen turning the mind\nTo seek the wondrous, to seek the mysterious,\nUnfolding the jade bud,\nGathering the golden lotus.\nFeeling qi and spirit clear,\nSpirit radiant—\nBecoming an immortal.\n\n**For Master Wang the Fifth, Presenting Food Within the Enclosure Wall**\nTeach them to remove what should be removed,\nYet they vie to prepare feast-kitchens.\nBrothers weary,\nWasting effort in vain.\nBetter to rest early,\nTo recognize the primordial origin—\nThere, seek the root of clouds,\nFollow the feet of clouds,\nTread the cloud thoroughfare.\nBreathing like a tortoise,\nSeeming to exist, seeming not—\nFeeling harmony and ease\nIn coming and going.\nTurning mountains and peaks,\nInhaling rivers and lakes.\nGiving birth to the immortal embryo,\nForming immortal substance,\nAscending to the immortal capital.\n\n**Chanting Incense**\nNot burning aloeswood,\nIdly burning the incense of the heart.\nSpreading the wind of benevolence,\nEverywhere incense is heard.\nEach person turns toward goodness,\nEach cherishes incense.\nWishing to abide in non-action,\nEver pure and still—\nNaturally fragrant.\nWondrous cavern-cloud incense,\nTiger’s roar sprays fragrance.\nMoreover, the dragon’s chant\nExhales fragrant scent.\nJade forms the precious talisman,\nGold binds the cinnabar incense.\nAttaining the journey to Penglai,\nTranscending the Three Realms,\nOffering true incense.\n\n**Chanting the Crane**\nThough dwelling among chickens,\nLike a phoenix amassing down—\nEver since Ding Ling\nManifested thus.\nFrost-white feathers, crimson crest,\nJade wings, jade-like flesh.\nFeeding on duckweed in Taihu,\nNibbling chestnuts by the pool,\nCrying to the clouds and rainbow.\nAt dawn, playing in the field of mushrooms,\nAt dusk, drinking from the Jasper Pond.\nAwaiting Wang Qiao\nTo come and rein it in.\nDancing in the market of Wu,\nRiding the strange chariot of Wei—\nThen pointing toward Penglai,\nMorning court in the golden palace,\nAscending to the cinnabar steps.\n\n**Exhortation to the World**\nVisage ashen,\nWhiskers and temples streaked with gray.\nYet still foolishly deluded,\nEnvious, greedy, miserly.\nNot worrying for oneself,\nBut caressing wife and children.\nCrafty thoughts arise,\nNo mind to yield,\nNo heart to relax.\nIn the waves of the bitter sea,\nEver bound to the fire-house.\nDeploying schemes,\nAccumulating karma like mountains.\nNot seeking the Great Dao,\nEver obstinate and dull.\nWho among you knows—\nCultivating immortality is easy,\nNurturing a family is hard.\n\n**Karmic Retribution of Good and Evil**\nThose who do evil,\nViolent and unmatched—\nCarefully considering,\nWhat can they do?\nIn life, facing official law,\nIn death, meeting King Yama.\nAs prisoners in hell,\nPounded in mortars,\nGround in mills.\nThose who accumulate goodness,\nReverent, humble, harmonious—\nCarefully considering,\nThey surpass all.\nBlack ledgers hard to collect,\nHow could they enter penal courts?\nMoreover, divine spirits protect them,\nHouseholds prosper,\nDescendants multiply.\n\n**Inscribed for Master Wu at the Eastern Gallery**\nSixth month’s severe cold,\nTwelfth month’s scorching heat—\nThis true work,\nClearly inverted.\nWithin yang, yin reaches its extreme;\nWithin yin, yang is born.\nFrom the midst of the Five Phases,\nWho has walked this path?\nI walk the journey.\nMyriad golden lotuses,\nEver flourishing in fire.\nWithin water, beholding\nThe red flames ascending.\nThe two gathered together,\nOne nature perfectly accomplished.\nThen wearing the Three Flowers,\nCombing the three topknots,\nBowing to the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**For the Two Directors, Zhang and Liu**\nI exhort Qinghe,\nUrge Pengcheng—\nAnd all gentlemen,\nCease wearying the

rainbow hues.\nSailing the immortal raft.\n\n**For Liu Shujian and Ma Changji**\n\nMy kin, Shujian and Changji,\nBoth serving as inspectors.\nUnversed in indulgence,\nThey rush to and fro, greedy for fame and profit.\nHow foolish they seem!\nI urge them to gather their primordial yang early,\nWhy cling to wife and child?\nErect a cloud hermitage,\nA single profound word, no vulgar chatter.\nDeparting the dust to seek the truth.\n\n**For the Chief of the Laizhou Equality Assembly**\n\nThe world tells of the speckled bamboo and the fair one’s tears,\nAll mere empty talk.\nStruck by the Three Corpses,\nBlood-stained spots appear—most wondrous indeed.\nMa Feng knows.\nDevote yourself to uprightness, wielding no partial staff,\nMock not the humble.\nBest to wander idly,\nBanishing all demons, the jade nature shines.\nBound for the Jasper Pool.\n\n**Ode to the Bamboo Staff**\n\nI wish you to adorn the carefree traveler,\nKnee of crane, ever at his side.\nStrolling through clouds and mist,\nLaughing proudly in the pure wind by the moonlit stream.\nJoy in serenity.\nEven the reed of the sea has Lü’s second integrity,\nThe yang number clearly known.\nHarmonious with the Dao,\nA fine companion for cloud-roving, wind-footed steeds.\nDo not refuse.\n\n**Self-Lament**\n\n**Reflection on the Self**\n\nThis body, worn and tattered as a thatched hut,\nDripping with rain, torn by the wind.\nIt draws fire and summons smoke,\nRiddled with rat holes, snake burrows—its pillars askew.\nYet all can be made firm.\nShould a master appear, it transforms into a cavern of silver mist,\nRestored to a cloud-borne pavilion.\nPearl curtains hang,\nAnd one delights in the radiance of an unending day.\nSurely ascension awaits.\n\n**Awakening**\n\nI awoke to refine the treasure within,\nNo longer flaunting beard or brow.\nOnly the joy of stillness remains,\nDispensing benevolent winds without bias or favor.\nMay my resolve stand firm.\nI urge others to see through the dream of floating life,\nTo forsake the allure of ornate carriages.\nNo need to gaze upon curtains—\nFollow me soaring into the grotto-heaven,\nTo become an immortal.\n\n**Self-Admonition**\n\nOnce, in my cups, I grew careless,\nVowing never again to raise the goblet.\nSeeing through fleeting wealth,\nI no longer contend in vain, nor bury myself in desire.\nThus I avoid calamity.\nAgain and again, I chance upon the path of cultivation,\nPurifying the spirit’s terrace.\nI guard the sacred embryo,\nWaiting for the luminous pearl to become a child,\nBound for Penglai.\n\n**Karma’s Weight**\n\nIn a past life, I sowed no blessings for this one,\nBegging in the streets.\nFrozen and starving, I wandered in distress,\nMy heart like a boiling cauldron, seared by suffering.\nI prayed for mercy.\nClearly, a single coin given,\nSecretly repays the worthy.\nThe greatest affinity—\nSince ancient times, compassion alone makes immortals.\nNo empty words.\n\n**Tea and Wine, the Affairs of Human Sentiment**\n\nTea comes, wine goes—mere worldly custom,\nNot the root of the Dao.\nOnly to offer, only to reciprocate,\nWine departs, yet no tea returns in kind.\nThus enmity is born.\n\nTo pity the poor and set out congee, seeking no reward,\nIs virtue built in secret.\nBetter still, true cultivation—\nSurely one shall gaze upon the Ten Isles in days to come,\nTreading the clouds in wander.\n\n**Relieving Hunger, Together Serving Winter’s Congee**\n\nWith bowed head, I salute the noble lords,\nWho join to set out congee for the starving through three winters.\nMay each household prosper,\nAnd this small act of compassion—\nA measure of rice to succor the poor—\nFind goodly favor.\n\nThe heart of the Dao abides in constant good deeds,\nAs nature and destiny merge in harmony.\nWhen the mind is truly open,\nIt binds the horse, seizes the monkey,\nAnd leads forth tiger and dragon,\nBound for the Peng Palace.\n\n**The World’s Love of Convenience**\n\nEvery mortal clings to what seems advantageous,\nVying for gain.\nScheming with cunning,\nThey win what seems profitable—yet it is loss.\nFew understand.\n\nI urge them: set aside this \"convenience,\"\nBuild virtue through giving.\nNot out of folly,\nBut to secretly amass vast blessings,\nAscending to the Purple Tenuity,\nTo become an immortal and return.\n\n**Floating Clouds and Wealth**\n\nFloating clouds gather and scatter like wealth—\nIll-gotten gains,\nDo not covet them,\nFor they bring calamity and invite disaster.\nHow unwise.\n\nBetter to cultivate a mind of equanimity,\nWhere none are harmed.\n\n**Far Superior to Fasting**\n\nFar superior to fasting,\nIt ensures one avoids the precipice in days to come.\nBound for Penglai.\n\n**Winter Porridge**\n\nThree winters’ porridge should endure,\nYear after year the same.\nWith steadfast compassion,\nOne sows true fields of blessing in this life.\nNo loss for the wise.\nThough but a measure of rice is given,\nThe blessings gained are boundless.\nWhen merit’s work is complete,\nOne is certain to ascend as an immortal,\nRising to the azure heavens.\n\n**Preparing Offerings**\n\nBefore the fast, prepare incense and fire,\nSupply the hungry and poor with diligence.\nSurely a noble soul lies hidden within—\nDo not take them lightly.\nI have now received the true message,\nAnd share it with others—one must be reverent,\nAs solemn as when sacrificing to the gods,\nMeeting the true with truth.\n\n**Beggars in the Streets**\n\nThose starving and freezing in the streets,\nReceive with joy and pity.\nServe them as you would immortals,\nLest a sage be hidden among them.\nBe wholehearted in this.\nBetter than performing ten grand jiao rites,\nOr sowing other karmic seeds.\nWhen virtuous deeds are complete,\nOne is certain to step upon the azure lotus,\nAnd go to pay homage to the Origin.\n\n**Winter Porridge for the Needy**\n\nThree winters’ porridge should relieve distress,\nFor the hungry are pitiable.\nA fine deed worth spreading—\nWhen others hear of this good cause,\nThey too will follow.\nRelieving poverty and lifting suffering brings merciful blessings,\nMerit without end.\nSuperior to burning sandalwood and aloes,\nIt ensures one ascends to heaven in days to come,\nTo become a divine immortal.\n\n**In the Kitchen, Heed Fu Feng’s Admonition**\n\nWhen cooking porridge, do not make it thin.\nLet it be thick and hearty,\nLest you deceive the bellies of others.\nAwaken compassion.\nDay after day, never weary in heart,\nAnd begin at the proper hour.\nDispel the biting cold,\nAnd never neglect this true merit.\nGreat fortune shall be yours.\n\n**Compassionate Daoist Friends**\n\nCompassionate Daoist friends take pity on the poor and destitute,\nSetting out porridge for three winters.\nAll shall gain true merit,\nAnd with devout sincerity, see it through to the end.\nYear after year, the offering continues.\nKindness without waste—when others hear of it,\nThey too shall wish for household abundance.\nThose who aid the poor\nShall surely not be left empty-handed in days to come,\nBut ascend to the immortal palaces.\n\n**A Thousand Households, Ten Thousand Doors**\n\nLet all people heed this exhortation,\nAnd cultivate good causes.\nTake pity on the hungry,\nAnd together provide porridge for three winters to relieve the poor.\nBlessings shall overflow.\nA scoop or half a handful of compassionate rice\nHolds merit no light matter.\nFar greater than reciting scriptures,\nA merciful heart reaches the Jade Capital,\nAnd inscribes one’s name among the immortals.\n\n**Wind Like Blades, Snow Like Arrows**\n\nThe three winters bring bitter suffering—\nHave mercy on the poor children.\nNo clothes upon their backs,\nNo food within their mouths, ever gnawed by hunger.\nHow wretched their plight.\nNow is the time for all to perform virtuous deeds,\nAnd awaken compassion.\nRescue the drowning, uphold the faltering,\nAnd provide porridge for a hundred days.\nThis shall build the ladder to immortality.\n*[To Master Sun]*\nSetting out porridge in winter brings manifold benefits.\nI urge Master Sun, as deputy director, to take care\nThat it never be discontinued.\nWith deep gratitude.\nI humbly present two short lyrics:\n\nPorridge set out in winter graces temple and abbey,\nA virtuous deed that shines.\nCast aside all worry,\nAnd realize that acts of compassion run deepest.\nAll shall hold you in esteem.\nNever grow weary or impatient,\nFor this surpasses burning sandalwood and aloes.\nSeek the wondrous in quiet moments,\nWhere water and fire give birth to gold within jade,\nAnd ascend to the jasper peaks.\n\nWhere does Deputy Director Sun reside?\nAt the Purple Ultimate Palace.\nReceiving guests with humility,\nHe treats high and low alike, moving his own person—\nLike a drawn bow.\n\nI urge the worthy to recognize early the true cultivation,\nTo revolve the numinous palace.\nCease all excessive reverence,\nFor the brocade arrow, fine as silk, strikes the precious body—\nNo bow is needed.\n\n*Departing the Sea of Suffering*\n*(Following the rhyme of Master Chongyang)*\n\nBy karmic encounter, one departs the sea of suffering,\nCultivating truth in stillness and solitude.\nWithin the true wind,\nSeize the true gale.\nPlant jade and jasper,\nAnd true auspices fill the azure sky.\nDraw forth the true jade hare,\nThe true golden rooster—\nNaturally, they dissolve all.\nGather further the true dragon and true tiger, coiling around,\nFor the true image will not spare even the partial.\nTruly indistinct, truly manifest,\nOne sees the true infant and true maiden beckoning.\nSeek the true Departure, the true Block, the true place,\nTo truly, truly aid one another and ingest the numinous sprout.\nSuddenly, the primordial true visage coalesces,\nThrough true purity,\nWith harmonious effort and power.\nDepart for Peng Isle,\nTo pay homage to Master Chongyang,\nAnd abide in eternal freedom.\n\n*End of Scroll Seven of the* **Treasury of Golden Jade from the Grotto Mysteries**\n\n---\n*[The following eleven lyrics are to the tune*

infant,\nWithin the Palace of Five Lights.\nThen suddenly,\nThe elixir coalesces, luminous—\nAttaining boundless true joy.\n\nOnce, playing in the water,\nI swiftly saw my error.\nThus I compose this verse\nTo show those below the hall—\nLest any cling stubbornly.\n\n**To Little Immortal Li**\nLi, the fitting monk,\nA monk who studies the Dao.\nThe Dao demands profound subtlety,\nSought daily in

unburdened.\nNow is the time\nTo forge good karmic ties,\nRoaming as clouds and water, transforming all.\n\n**On Hearing of the Passing of the Wu Brothers, Scholars of the First Rank**\nAlas, this floating life,\nHeart turned to ashes.\nThe Wu brothers, scholars of the first rank,\nYouthful and pure in their prime.\nWho could have known\nThat in half a month’s time,\nThey would together meet their end?\nLet others awaken,\nLet others reflect:\nCast aside worldly ties,\nPreserve life and nature in full.\nTruly pure,\nThey speak of escaping rebirth,\nAttaining eternal life with certainty.\n\n**Guo the Laywoman of Xingping Joins the Hall of Complete Perfection to Cultivate the Dao**\nLaywoman Guo,\nWith the resolve of a man,\nShears worldly passions,\nFearing life and death.\nFar from her husband,\nShe sews shut the yin gate,\nUnmatched in ancient or modern times.\nVigilant to the end,\nAs at the beginning,\nSages and worthies\nShall secretly uplift you.\n\nAmid non-action, in purity from head to toe,\nDwelling with Ma Gu.\n\n**Master Lu of Pucheng**\nAlas, this man,\nBroken and worn.\nHeedless of peril and ruin,\nHe toys with the gates of the Dao.\nStill, by his own doing,\nUnmindful of past transgressions,\nHow shall he escape great calamity?\nHear my words, cast off entanglements:\nWorldly love and dusty passions,\nSever them with a single blade.\nDissolve past karma,\nResume cultivation,\nAnd the winds of Ma Feng shall watch over you.\n\n**Another**\nHair like tangled hemp,\nFace like filth.\nAll affairs forgotten,\nThe heart free of dust and grime.\nIndolent and unrestrained,\nLost in sloth and indulgence,\nBegging for scraps with outstretched hands.\nFortunate to know nothing,\nWhy cling to something?\nEmbrace the void beyond void,\nThe elixir of no-leakage.\nSeek Penglai,\nWhen merit fills three thousand,\nYou shall don cloud-sleeved robes.\n\n**Bodhisattva Bo Awaits Inquiry**\nBodhisattva Bo,\nSkilled in sculpting,\nBoasts of wondrous hands and marvelous craft,\nNever ceasing.\nExpending spirit,\nMuddying water and dragging through mire,\nAll for the sake of feeding his family.\nYet does the heart awaken?\nDoes the nature comprehend?\nIn idle offerings,\nTo the true Father and Mother.\nIn purity and clarity,\nThe elixir is forged,\nTo ride the green phoenix and depart.\n\n**Yang Awaits Inquiry**\nYang the Craftsman,\nSculpts with skill,\nPlaying with mud and water,\nNever nurturing the vast.\nCease the clamor,\nCease begging for poems,\nTurn your heart toward the Dao.\nDelve deeply, probe thoroughly,\nIn purity and clarity,\nThe mysteries shall reveal themselves.\nQi, spirit, essence—\nThe elixir of no-leakage complete,\nRide the clouds to Penglai’s isles.\n\n**Elder Bo of Shaohua Seeks [a Response]**\nElder Bo, Elder Bo.\n\nAt eighty-four years,\nWhy awaken the heart to cultivate and nurture?\nReading Chongyang’s *Complete Works of the True*,\nSome savor is found.\nSpeak not of age,\nNor of lifespan’s appearance.\nExternally hoary,\nInternally unconstrained.\nQi unbroken—\nCultivation remains possible,\nSwiftly settling the mind is paramount.\n\n**To Ma Shouqing**\nMa, the Maiden,\nReturns once more.\nIn daily use, non-action,\nLeisurely nurturing simplicity.\nCease discourse\nOn the maiden, the infant, the youthful,\nOr where tiger and dragon contend.\nSever worldly ties,\nAttain true delight.\nFire extinguished, smoke dispersed,\nQi and spirit firm.\nWithin, cloud-wandering—\nMerit fills the Three Fields,\nAscend Penglai’s immortal path.\n\n**Internal Cultivation: To Master Xu of the Garden**\nAlone and steadfast,\nTending the garden.\nTreading furrows, pacing ridges,\nYet not walking in vain.\nGrasping the jade crucible,\nReversing the flow of numinous waves—\nWhen were hands ever raised?\nWatering frequently,\nSprouts and shoots emerge.\nGradually fragrant,\nThe garden brims with splendor.\nFrom the Palace of Jeweled Petals,\nRadiant clouds burst forth,\nEmulating the divine elder’s return.\n\n**Gathering the Medicine: To Elder Tian of Longzhou**\nTo learn cultivation\nIs like gathering herbs.\nCarrying a basket of purity,\nUnstained by defilement.\nWandering deep\nAmid white clouds—\nWhen was a hoe ever used?\nSummoning the green phoenix,\nBeckoning the white crane.\nTreading upon the sacred land,\nNaturally resplendent.\nBeholding the ninefold transmutation,\nA single elixir pill complete—\nThen gather it into the azure vault.\n\n**Internal Plowing: To Master Mu Zhang**\nDwelling in solitary clarity,\nInternally plowing and sowing.\nHeart and intent at ease,\nUnshaken, unmoved.\nIn profound obscurity,\nA golden ox appears,\nPlowing deep in the valley’s fields.\nClear rain descends,\nPurple mushrooms rise.\nRed phoenix and dark turtle\nCome forth to behold the offering.\nHemp and wheat bear\nDivine pearls of millet,\nAscending the azure heavens in tribute.\n\n**To Abbot Wang**\nWhen nurturing the family,\nWhat was the state of affairs?\n\nHarried by wife and sons,\nAs if afflicted in heart.\nChasing profit and fame,\nToiling back and forth—\nToo weary, too weary.\nSince turning to the Dao,\nEver open and at ease.\nBeyond the twin words \"nature and life,\"\nNo other deluded thoughts arise.\nSeizing tranquility,\nFreely roaming and carefree—\nHow unbounded, how unbounded.\n\n**[Illness Among the Daoist Assembly]**\nWhile dwelling on Mount Zhongnan,\nI lived within bare walls,\nLegs bared, feet unshod,\nWithout fire or lamp,\nFor six years in all.\nSuddenly stirred in heart,\nI wandered the clouds at will,\nWestward to Huating,\nSeeking shelter in Shenkan.\nBy chance, I contracted the Central Plains’ *jin-huo* toxin,\nCoughing blood and gasping—\nThe illness struck with great urgency.\nFellow Daoists offered medicine;\nI bowed and received it,\nYet dared not taste.\nThey urged me:\n\"Eat raw scallions with strong vinegar\nTo dispel the poison.\"\nI pondered again and again:\nWhen a Daoist falls ill,\nNone can heal but oneself.\nOne must refine the supreme treasure within the body,\nAnd the malady will naturally fade.\nThus I composed a short lyric, *The Mirror of Clarity*,\nAnd respectfully presented it to the assembly,\nHoping for your kind regard.\n\n---\n*Ma feng-feng*, five score and six.\nDrifting like cloud and water,\nAlone and serene.\nRiding the celestial wind,\nSwaying the luminous radiance,\nEver brightening the candle of inherent nature.\nArriving at Tingchuan,\nI lodged in a cellar.\nUnawares, I encountered\nThe Central Plains’ *jin-huo* toxin.\nTo dissolve the disharmony of the four impermanent forms,\nRefine the gold and jade within the body.\n\n**Treating Illness**\nWhen qi does not flow,\nThe feet and knees suffer.\n\nMica ointment should be applied and kept ready at all times. For tetanus from wounds, what remedy is there? Grind *huaruishi* finely and sprinkle it.\n\n**Treating Heart Maladies**\n*Qingshen* powder. For obstinate dispositions, *fuzi*; for harmonizing the center, *lizhong* pills. If *Lingbao* elixirs are taken in excess, even the bones and marrow may transform.\n\n**To Ju Deyi of Hezhou**\nJu of Hezhou, listen to my words. Cast aside all these techniques and methods. The great Dao of spontaneity and non-action—how could it lie in meticulous manipulation? The *Mirror of Clarity* ever gleams pure, illuminating the myriad conditions, beyond birth and extinction. This original luminous essence shines as bright as the autumn moon.\n\n**To Master Ma**\nHow free and unburdened, how open and expansive! In sitting, lying, dwelling, and walking, carefree and at ease. Reflect deeply: those entangled in fame and profit—how could they know this flavor? In leisure, cultivate and nurture. Temper that single luminous pearl of spirit until it gleams resplendent. Count thrice the seas’ transformation to mulberry fields—this is but a moment for the immortals.\n\n**To the Ten Palace Examiners of Huating**\nYin Yuqing, Fan Zuxun, Ming Zhongji Meng, Zi Xun, Zi Run, Han Qing, and Xin Zhong the official—all of the Qinghe clan. Cheng Derong, Li Hanchen: ten of our fellowship, all refined and talented. I urge you, gentlemen, to let fame and profit turn to ash and attend early to the perfection of nature and life.\n\n**To Lingyangzi Li Dacheng**\nLingyangzi, you come to bid farewell. Parting is not like the time of welcome. Hear my counsel: travel with purpose, and tend closely to your widowed mother. For us, when the smoke and fire of worldly desires are extinguished, never forget your original resolve—steadily deepen your determination. Walk the great Dao, unfold the primal truth, and summon the clear wind and bright moon.\n\n**To Young Master Liu**\nOne green ox, two tails. Three eyes surveying above and below. Four hooves white as silver, frolicking through the five directions. The six desires and seven emotions all abandoned. Drinking the eight-flavored nectar, radiance suffuses the body. Within the nine tripods, it transmutes into divine elixir—tenfold perfection complete.\n\n**To Jiranzi**\nPractitioners of the Dao, listen closely.\n\nFasting fare must not be made exquisite beyond measure. What need is there for exotic delicacies of many kinds? A single flavor suffices. In tranquil partaking, contentment is ever found. The ten thousand spirits harmonize in bliss, the alchemical pair rejoices in union. Naturally, the golden elixir coalesces—claiming one’s place among the immortals of Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**Daoist Companions Ask About Cultivation**\nCloud companions inquire, rosy friends respond. The matter of nature and life is grave—one must surely deliver oneself. The turning wheel of rebirth is decided in this very life; search diligently, scrub thoroughly. When the blue lotus blooms and the white lotus unfolds, within the lotus canopy the alchemical pair gazes above and below. Proceeding upon the road to Penglai, they dance the *liuma* of eighteen movements.\n\n**To Abbot Yan of Huating’s Yinyuan Cloister**\nLiu Ziwen, of penetrating nature, saw three generations of his family—father and sons—all take the tonsure. No longer entangled in outward practices, they recognized the wondrous Dharma of non-doing. Within, all was pure and clear, a numinous treasure pagoda. Jade elephants and golden lions encircled it sevenfold. Suddenly, a resounding *ding-dang* arose, revealing the bodhisattva of wondrous sound.\n\n**Daoist Companions Ask of What Household I Am**\nDaoist companions inquire, “Of what household are you?”\nI answer: “Pure and still, with no contrivance.”\nThey laugh and say, “This is mere obstinate emptiness—where do you grasp it?”\nTo grasp it, I tell you this: the mind-steed and heart-ape must be firmly captured. Naturally, the earth wells forth with sweet springs, and heaven descends with sweet dew.\n\nAgain—\nSweet springs well forth, sweet dew descends. Ascending and descending without cease, they naturally moisten the three fields, where purple灵芝 unfurl in abundance. Benevolent sprouts arise, wisdom shoots emerge. Blazing and radiant, they illuminate the jade path. Then they transform into a single divine pearl, pointing the way to Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**Exhortation to Disciples**\nAvoid vain pretenses, avoid vain pretenses. Do not lean upon non-leaning, nor trifle with the Dao. Preserving nature and life is no ordinary matter—strike decisively and settle it completely. O child of the homeless life, display your skill. Take all former attachments and suddenly, fiercely sever them. With single-minded resolve and unyielding determination, cultivate steadfastly to join the company of immortals.\n\n**To Pei Daqi**\nPractitioners of the Dao must keep the heart kind. Yet karmic obstructions and demonic illusions assail them relentlessly. In the twelve hours, the unruly steed and frenzied ape give rise to unceasing evil thoughts. Steel your resolve, temper it constantly. Exterminate them without trace, and war shall never arise again.\n\n**Harmonizing Qi and Spirit, the Elixir of Purity Forms—**\nThe Embryonic Immortal emerges in manifestation.\n\n**To Li Fei, the Great Recluse**\nPractitioner of the Dao, avoid missteps.\nPonder carefully: external joy cannot compare to inner joy.\nIn constant purity, pure delight arises of itself—\nthis is the original, true exultation.\nNo sorrow, no attachment,\nfree and unbound, qi and spirit blaze radiantly.\nWhen merit is perfected and the Embryonic Immortal revealed,\nyou shall dance your way back to the Azure Heavens.\n\n**The Melon and Plum Parable**\nBeware the floating water-caltrop, fear the sinking plum.\nSee through the floating caltrop,\nand the principle becomes self-evident.\nFrom this moment on, cease flaunting literary arts,\nand no longer need you expound on rites.\nWander like clouds upon water, far from your homeland.\nDo not cultivate outward appearances—\ncultivate only the inner.\nStabilize your breath, attain eternal harmony,\nand drink the immortal elixir of longevity.\n\n**Again**\nThe bitter melon’s stem, the fragrant sweet plum:\nabandon bitterness for sweetness,\nand the supreme principle becomes clear.\nExtinguish ignorance, blend with the world while shining,\nand for now, perform worldly rites at leisure.\nSeek the ancient capital, traverse the locust groves.\nLet the heart dwell beyond things,\nlet qi gather to replenish the inner.\nIn the void, nurture the infant spirit,\nand drink the celestial elixir of spontaneity.\n\n**Again**\nThis scholar, surnamed Li in the world,\nawakened to the pure stillness of non-action—\nthe profound principle of spontaneity.\nSummoned by the Jade Emperor,\nhe vied for first place among immortals,\nsurpassing Kong Li’s inquiry into rites.\nHear my words, return to your homeland.\nDwell once more within the encircling walls,\nand diligently cultivate the inner.\nWhen the jade peaches ripen,\nthe nectar shall flow of itself—\nmocking Shen Sheng’s draught of sacrificial wine.\n\n**Again**\nMustard greens are heavy, plums are precious.\nAwakened to the suffering of birth and death,\nweary of delving into texts and principles.\nDiminish flavors, distance yourself from sights and sounds,\nand grow tired of studying the *Zhou Rites*.\nGather the Three Lights, release them into the Three Li.\nRecognize the discourse of the Three Topknots—\nin purity, both inner and outer.\nQi and spirit, the Three Treasures—\nwhen the elixir is formed,\nthe Three Pure Ones shall bestow their nectar.\n\n**Resolute Determination**\nO child of the homeless life, be decisive.\nBite through ignorance with a single snap,\nas the fire-drill of delusion bores in.\nIn all matters of the Dao, temper your resolve with unyielding steel—\nthen you may be called a man of iron.\nLet your will not waver, your heart not stray.\nDiscern the ancient and modern,\nthe immortal’s public records.\nThrough accumulated merit and practice,\nfear no hardship—\nawait the direct crossing to the other shore.\n\n**Thus I Show Fellow Cultivators the Resolute Path to Immortal Fruition**\nO child of the homeless life, be decisive.\nSever all ten thousand dusty entanglements at once.\nForget cunning, cut off thoughts, and cultivate immortality—\nsettle the matter of nature and life completely.\nOutwardly foolish, inwardly radiant,\nin voice and laughter, bearing the guise of a simpleton.\n\nRejoice in poverty, sing and dance before the streets,\ndelight in spreading mats and holding bowls.\nO cultivator, take heed—do not err.\nPonder carefully: outer joy cannot compare to inner joy.\nIn stillness and clarity, true joy and true bliss arise,\nas smiles bloom like flowers.\nFree from sorrow, free from attachment,\nqi and spirit harmonize in ascent, the heart holds no resentment.\nGive rise to great goodness, deliver the deluded and lost,\ntogether ascend to the azure heavens.\n\nWhen encountering foes, seek reconciliation.\nWine, lust, temper, and wealth—forever renounce, forever abstain.\nWalk the great Dao, sever the ten thousand entanglements,\nand you shall be utterly without hindrance.\nDo not deceive the heart, nor fabricate strange deeds.\nRecognize the ever-constant, roam freely and at ease.\nAbide in non-action, yet let compassion arise in the heart—\nsuch merit and practice are unmatched.\n\n**To My Fourth Younger Brother, Ma Yunfu**\nLive in harmony with others, avoid brawls.\nBeware of delusion—gambling, gaming, and drinking.\nThe hidden winds of illness terrify those nearby—\nhasten to their rescue.\nTo banish sickness, shake your sleeves free.\nCultivate beyond the mundane, pristine and pure from the outset.\nThere is yet another true and eternal Chang’an—\nawait its fulfillment in time.\n\n**Against Fabricating Strange Deeds**\nFeigning madness, shedding worldly burdens—\ndo not act wildly, nor cast off family ties.\n\nFreed from family entanglements, keep the mind-ground pure.\nDo not feign strangeness, nor pretend to be good;\ncease reckless talk of spirits and ghosts.\nCold and heat—know to avoid them.\nIn pursuing the Dao, do not be ashamed\nof coarse clothes and simple fare.\nFollow the laws of the land, transgress no heavenly precepts—\nsuch is the livelihood of one who cultivates immortality.\n\n**Against Powdering and Washing the Face**\nA monastic, craving fine delicacies,\nheedless of waste, powders and washes the face.\nEating vegetarian dumplings, pretending they are turtle soup—\nwhat dignity is there in this?\nIndulging the palate brings no lasting benefit.\nCoarse tea and plain rice suffice to fill the trench.\nDelight in poverty, roam in tranquil simplicity—\nthis is a different kind of insight.\n\n**To Those Who Prepare Noodles**\nNoodle-maker, heed my words:\nknead firmly, roll thin, slice with care.\nAt the stove and hearth, do not delay—\nadd fire and candlelight without pause.\nWhen fragrance arises and it is well-cooked,\nseason sweetly and harmoniously, filling the hollow with substance.\nAfter the meal, guard against wild thoughts—\npreserve the original, unadorned face.\n\n**Admonition to the Drunken**\nDo not indulge in drunkenness, do not indulge in drunkenness.\nHow could a worthy dare act so before officials?\nIn cultivating the Dao, superior persons do not contend—\ntruly, I bear you no ill will.\nDo not give free rein to desire, do not give free rein to desire.\nRefrain from craving the cup; early on, exalt good deeds.\nTake hold of your nature and life, perfect them wholly—\npursue the livelihood of an immortal.\n\n**On the Disciples of the Three Teachings**\nThe reckoning of the Nine Yangs, thoroughly understood—\ndisciples of the Three Teachings, just emerged from the nest.\nIn the depth of spring, by good fortune we meet—\nwhat a different kind of joy this is.\nNo words, no speech,\ngrasping hands and laughing without end.\nBody and mind—no longer like Cold Mountain—\nthis life is truly reclaimed.\n\n**Truthful Words**\nNo scholar chases fame, no talk of profit.\nWine, sex, temper, wealth—no thought is given to them.\nWorldly affairs—none concern the heart;\nseek instead another livelihood.\nTo preserve the true, one must cultivate qi.\nWithin purity and clarity, tiger and dragon play.\nAttaining the natural, the inner workings turn—\na celestial embryo is born, an immortal emerges.\n\n**Exhortation to Monks and Daoists for Harmony**\nDaoists slander monks, monks slander Daoists—\nI urge monks and Daoists: cease this mutual defamation.\nWhat should those who have left the household truly be like?\nResolve the matter of nature and life early on.\nStrive for unity, delve into the profound.\nRefine the spirit and qi, coalesce them into the Three Treasures.\nIn the realm of True Suchness, ascend to the Tusita Heaven—\nin radiant clarity, journey to Peng Island.\n\n**Against Luxury**\nMonastic, listen carefully:\nin dwelling, be cautious—\ndo not build grand and splendid structures.\nTo construct gardens and pavilions pleasing to the eye—\nhow does this differ from the ways of the worldly?\nIf asked, \"What is it?\"\nBamboo fences and thatched huts,\na broken wooden gate,\npatched robes of paper and hemp—\nthis is the livelihood of the Daoist.\n\n**To Master Zhao**\nMonastic, temper yourself.\n\nEach one seeks to subdue self and others,\nyet how can past karmic debts—deep and profound—\nbe torn asunder in an instant?\nMay the heart open, may delusion shatter early.\nAll things are empty—why contend?\nRefining the self’s form *is* the practice;\nit will surely bear fruit in time.\n\n**Exhortation to Disciples Seeking the Dao**\nIn cultivation, dispel false thoughts.\nPonder carefully, and gradually fine conditions will arise.\nLeave the self behind early—\nseek the Dao, inquire into Chan—\nI cannot be your reliance.\nIn Chang’an, there are those of lofty conduct:\nMaster Gu Yue, the ancient moon,\nand Teacher Yang Pi, the sheepskin-clad.\nServe them with utmost reverence,\nlearn a measure of self-cultivation.\n\n**To Dharma Master Guo**\nWild and unrestrained,\nhe wandered idly,\npassing through Jingyuan Town,\nwhere archers and soldiers detained him,\nseizing him as a spy\nwithout allowing explanation.\nOnce angered, no remedy remained.\nBound in Guo Lue, he endured imprisonment.\nHad it not been for Lord Guo, the prefect’s grace,\nwhen would this ordeal have ended?\n\n**Lament for the World**\nAlas! How shallow is human perception—\nthose who possess ten thousand strings of cash\ndeem themselves richer than those with a thousand.\nDo they ever consider the great limit that looms,\ncrushing mountains and shattering eggs alike?\nIf awakened, cast aside worldly ties.\nTurn beyond the material—\nno more scheming, no more calculation.\nRefine spirit and qi until radiant,\nto become an immortal companion on Penglai.\n\n**Again**\nXi Shi’s beauty, Pan An’s looks—\n\nThose who understand see it and laugh.\nThough the great wind shapes earth and water into form,\nin the end, none escape the pit and grave.\nMay you awaken, may you comprehend.\nWhat use is an imposing, dignified exterior\nif within there is nothing profound to cultivate and perfect,\nnothing to grasp the nature of life and destiny clearly?\n\n**To Master Zhang**\nMaster Zhang, named *Wu Yu* (\"Without Desire\"),\nhis virtue-title *Wu Zheng* (\"Without Contention\"),\nnaturally free from vulgarity.\nFurther befitting his Daoist name, *Wu Chen* (\"Without Dust\"),\nhe delights in pure poverty and solitary lodging.\nJade within gold, gold within jade—\ngold and jade in harmonious balance,\nexotic fragrance rich and lush.\nWhen the great elixir is complete,\nhe will ride the cloud-chariot in ease,\nenjoying the immortal blessings of Penglai.\n\n**Lament for the World**\nAlas! How recklessly people rush.\nWhen fortune favors, they mock those who have lost it.\nHow can they know that those who now lack fortune\nonce enjoyed it as you do?\nAlas for hollow fame, alas for fleeting profit—\nlike floating clouds, no lasting plan.\nPonder life and death, seek the Dao, inquire into Chan,\ncultivate longevity and enduring vision.\n\n**To Song the Dharma Master of Wendeng**\nHe performs the talismanic rites, relieving suffering and illness.\nTruly, his noble family’s deep and illustrious practice is known.\nEven more, he should hasten to cultivate the true,\nrecognizing the ancestral origin of qi and spirit.\nRefine mercury and lead, harmonize dragon and tiger.\nBetween wood and metal lies the barrier;\nthe path flows through midnight and noon.\nWhen naturally the luminous pearl coalesces,\nhe will point the way to Penglai and return.\n\n**To Li Jin of Yidu Prefecture**\nLord of Longxi, named *Qu Bing* (\"To Shed Illness\"),\nhis heart’s virtue-title *Qu Hua* (\"To Shed Ornament\"),\nhis Daoist name *Qu Chen* (\"To Shed Dust\")—most essential.\nOnce awakened, he will shed all things,\nand then cultivate and perfect his nature and destiny.\nHis mind ever clear, his intent ever pure,\nhis Dharma name further resonates with the Valley Spirit.\nThe name *Tong Yi* (\"Through Unity\") is also fitting,\nhis style *Xian Qing* (\"Immortal Minister\") well-matched.\n\n**Lament for the World**\nAlas! How foolish people’s schemes.\nThey vie for the hollow fame of a snail’s horn,\nthe paltry profit of a fly’s head.\nYet once they gain a mere grain’s height,\nthey laugh at those beneath.\nThey bicker over right and wrong, vent idle grievances—\nhow could they awaken to cultivation,\ntranscend the mundane, and leave the world behind?\nWith but a little effort in mastering nature and destiny,\nthey might claim a place among Penglai’s immortals.\n\n**Again**\nThose who tend to family—\nnot one of them understands.\n\nEach parades their cleverness, yet clings to stinginess and greed.\nThough Heaven bestows great gifts—startling to relinquish—\ndare they not cherish their own lives?\nThis life, so vital to the body:\none breath failing, the body becomes dirt and dung.\nMay they awaken swiftly, hasten to cultivate and preserve,\nconsolidate their qi and spirit—then immortality is assured.\n\n**To Ma Yandu**\nTwo in-laws, each enlightened.\nWhat they once cherished,\nnow see as fierce tigers.\nRecognize the wuwei, the pure and tranquil family way,\nwhere nothing is contrived.\nNo stinginess, no joy or anger.\nRegulate the breath evenly, continuously nurture within.\nAwait the day when merit is complete, the work fulfilled—\ntogether they will ascend on clouds.\n\n**To Ling Yi Zi**\nMaster He, listen closely.\nBefore your hair is bound in a topknot,\nfirst wear it in twin buns.\nNor has the time come to beg for scraps—\nwait until awakening grants them to you.\nAttain samadhi and prajna, enter the first ground.\nRely on non-defilement, non-attachment,\nthe wuwei livelihood.\nWith a mind pure and clear, penetrate the wondrous and profound—\nthen the eternal covenant of immortality is yours.\n\n**Why Master He Went to Ninghai to Compose a Lyric for His Fellow Villagers**\nUrge your fellow villagers to awaken.\nFleeting profit, fleeting fame—\nneither firm nor enduring.\nWife and children are but walking corpses,\nthe self but stinking rot.\nTurn back early, seek the true path.\nLearn from Ma’s example,\njoyfully return.\nBeyond the material world, till the field of the heart—\nbecome companions to the immortals.\n\n**To Master Wei**\n□ is pure, □ plays with fire.\n□ in empty stillness, tigers rest with dragons.\n□ lotus blooms, surpassing all flowers,\n□ in karmic deeds of aid.\nAwakening, truly rejoice.\n□ the wuwei secret of purity,\nnaturally penetrates the mysteries.\n□ self-attained, cease further pursuit—\n□ others need not fear death.\n*(Composed by dissecting the character \"Wei.\")*\n\n**White Guanyin, Originally Named White Crane Child**\n\n**To Wu Zhigang**\nHis playful name belies diligence,\nfor he is one who nurtures simplicity.\nTo dress, he’s too lazy to raise his arms;\nto eat, too indolent to part his lips.\nWhen his face is grimy, he merely seeks water;\nhis topknot unkempt, he can’t be bothered to wrap a cloth.\nNo longer does he dream of worldly toil—\nhe has awakened to the truth within.\n\n**Again**\nThe method for long life and eternal vision\nrequires forgetting all things.\nGuard the monkey-mind—it’s easily subdued;\nrestrain the horse-intent—its wildness is hard to curb.\nDraw the tiger to dwell in the dragon’s cave,\ntame the dragon to reside in the tiger’s den.\nWhen the two become one,\nmount the crane and journey to Penglai’s estate.\n\n**Yanling’s Wondrous Formula, Originally Named Twin Swans**\n\n**Respectfully Following Master Chongyang’s Rhyme**\nFortunate to meet Fengxian, parting from the eastern land.\nNo entanglements, freely roaming the clouds.\nTrue joy and delight, singing with abandon.\nThese worldly ties—\none day, they will cease.\nEmulating Tian Dan’s fire-oxen strategy,\nharnessing metal and wood,\nreversing the flow.\nThe

mind—\ncirculate the sun and moon, do not let them idle.\nNurture the lower elixir without leakage,\nthen ascend to the crimson tower to refine the central elixir,\nfilling the upper numinous palace, attaining the three elixirs.\n\n**Reusing the Previous Rhyme**\nNurturing the three elixirs, yet not idle,\ntransforming people to enter the Dao, recognizing true leisure—\ntrue joy, true bliss, responding to true idleness.\nFurther refining the three elixirs into one,\npracticing merit to perfection, revealing the divine elixir—\nthe fetal immortal presents the purple golden elixir.\n\n**To the Daoist Beneath the Hall**\nFoul intentions and stubborn minds breed the smoke of the hearth,\ngaping mouths and wagging tongues spawn right and wrong—\nwounding others, harming oneself, transgressions arise in secret.\n\nThe contentious are naturally unkind,\nthe virtuous do not contend, and good sprouts grow—\nthe uncontentious superior person attains long life.\n\n**To Master Yan**\nForsaking glory and splendor, dwelling beyond the material,\nwith focused effort in the wondrous and true,\nwithin the Kan and Li palaces, playing with the pure and void.\n\nStriking jade teeth

Assembly)**\n*Following the Ancient Rhyme*\nWords spill carelessly, heedless of tune or measure,\nyet I sing and dance to my heart’s content,\nletting others laugh as they will.\n\nRejuvenating the

me.\nTempering the divine elixir,\nneither great nor small.\n\nThe fetal immortal nurtured,\npresents the magic mushroom.\nNow, boasting of this,\nat last, the Dao is attained.\n\n**The Grotto Heaven (Originally Named Partridge Sky)**\n*Sent to Ma Yunfu*\nAbandon gambling, drinking, and vouching for others,\nlessen the smoke and dust, reduce greed.\nSearching for one’s own faults brings lasting benefit,\nseeing not the faults of others reaps good causes.\n\nStartled by neither favor nor disgrace,\ndelighting in purity and poverty,\ncultivating the mind, nurturing nature, treasuring spirit.\n\nPersisting thus in successful practice,\nthe bright moon and clear wind become true companions.\n\n**To Master Yuan #3**\nSuddenly recalling fleeting glory pains my heart,\nbrief honor and fame sink into oblivion.\nHow much better the carefree wanderer beyond the world,\nunlike those bound within the realm, lacking freedom.\n\nForsaking worldly cares,\ndelighting in purity and poverty,\nin walking, standing, sitting, lying—*lori*...\nRefining the elixir of immortality in the jade crucible,\npreserving the golden furnace’s deathless truth.\n\n**To Zhaoranzi**\nI urge you, do

material.\n\nCultivating virtue and power,\nfortifying spirit,\ntigers and dragons coil and roar.\nMercury and lead naturally form the elixir,\nriding the crane, soaring on clouds, paying homage to the Perfected.\n\n**The Elixir Well of the Quanzhen Hermitage**\nDigging must reach eighteen feet deep,\nsweet springs naturally respond with clear song.\nFurther, it heals illness—named the Elixir Well,\nbefitting the mountain recluse’s heart of universal salvation.\n\nLet people heed advice,\nbecome knowing friends,\npursuing the wondrous subtleties of Chongyang.\nPurple *zhi*’s radiance shapes form,\nthe blue-eyed true suchness ascends the jeweled peak.\n\n**Jade Tower Spring (Borrowing the Willow Lyric’s Rhyme)**\n*To the Cloud Dweller*\nThe grotto heaven knows no night nor dawn,\nonly crimson light and purple mist.\nWithin the numinous waves, the golden turtle appears,\na thousand strands of silver silk upon its back.\n\nTwo spirits, diligent, harness the wind’s chariot,\nKan and Li merge, whispering secrets.\nCarving open creation to its subtlest depths,\nmastering the true work’s inverted numbers.\n\n**To the Eternal Spring Child #4**\nWhy seek wealth or nobility?\nNo need for prose like Bai’s.\nDelving into nature and destiny is a fine livelihood,\ncherishing the root’s source is the true way to live.\n\nHiding the mechanism in profound secrecy,\nunwilling to boast before others.\nDrinking jade nectar by the thousand cups,\ncloud friends and rosy companions toast in one intoxication.\n\n**To the Chang’an Child**\nWithin the grotto, sun and moon know no day or night,\nradiant cloud thoroughfares connect jeweled paths.\nAbove, the purple brain receives the Three Clarities,\nbelow, the Yellow River shines in five colors.\n\nNaturally, rosy clouds weave a delicate abode,\nwithin dwell the immortals of the Three Isles.\nBefore their traces beyond the clouds are revealed,\nthey have already arrived before our eyes.\n\n**To the Perfected Truth Child**\nIn clarity, awakening to auspicious omens,\nworthy to be the true heir of the Wind Immortal.\nGathering white snow and yellow sprouts,\nforging the divine

thousand ages among men.\n\n**To Master Zhang of Panxi**\nRefining primordial yang in the golden palace,\npreventing dark demons from stealing.\nMaintaining purity yields merit,\neternally congealing

the East or sets in the West,\nfree from sorrow,\non the road to Chang’an,\nthe Way is walked without delay.\n\n**Departing the Multitude: Instructions to Disciples**\nAll speak of smoke dispersing,\nof fire extinguished,\nyet at the slightest touch, ignorance stirs.\nUnaware, unknowing—\nhow can one depart the multitude?\nThe Dao is fundamentally easy to practice, easy to understand,\nbut the heart resists—\nhard to grasp, hard to follow.\nThe demon of the heart obstructs,\ngreat virtue unformed,\nthe square inch of the mind cannot attain clarity.\n\nGo with the flow,\nheed these instructions:\nlet go of right and wrong,\nof self and others.\nAlas, the walking corpses of bone—\nwhat shame? What glory?\nHasten to save your own nature,\nharmonize qi and spirit,\nrefine and solidify the true form.\nIn the numinous words,\nthe jade terrace and Penglai’s gardens—\nthe Isles of the Blessed lie ahead.\n\n**In Praise of Master Liu of Hunyuan’s Ascension**\nYoung, he followed the crowd;\ngrown, he stood apart—\ndevoted to the registers of the Dao.\nHe inscribed talismans, chanted over water,\nhealed the sick, and rescued the imperiled.\nHis virtue, though hidden like a thief’s,\nscorned splendor—\noyster-shell food and coarse robes.\nHe once encountered\nMaster Chongyang,\nwho transmitted to him the gateway to profound stillness.\n\nKnowing\nhis merit and conduct complete,\nhe hastened to visit me,\nsetting the date of his return.\nWith a flick of his sleeve,\nhe departed at the appointed time.\nIn Pengcheng, all was settled—\nMa, swift as the wind,\ncomposed a new verse.\nAttaining longevity,\nhe ascended with the cloud-borne immortals,\nriding a crane to the Jasper Pool.\n\n**In Praise of True Man Chongyang’s Manifestation**\nIn the ancient prefecture of Dengzhou,\nbeyond the Gate of Immortals,\npainted bridges and carriages could not pass.\nMaster Chongyang,\nbefore the multitude, revealed his true nature.\nHe foretold that after twelve years,\nPrefect He would meet his end.\nFinding the path treacherous,\nthe people dismantled it,\ncommanding craftsmen to rebuild.\n\nIn Wendeng,\nhe appeared again—\nupon a white turtle and lotus,\nseated in empty space.\nMagistrate Ni Manghu\nbeheld his true form.\nSuddenly, he turned, reclining on his side—\nauspicious clouds stirred,\nand he returned to the immortal palace.\nPeople vied to paint his likeness,\nenshrining it in every home,\nrevered and honored everywhere.\n\n**Again**\nThe Wondrous Practitioner,\nMaster Chongyang,\nmet his teacher, the Perfected Lü.\nAfter ten years of perfecting the Dao,\nhe departed, riding the wind.\nFor twelve years, he descended thrice to the world,\nhis

forth from the numinous palace.\nLet people awaken,\nhasten to cultivate purity—\ndo not endure the world’s veneration.\n\n**To Elders Xin the Fifth and Jiang the Fourth**\nSurpassing wealth and distinction,\ntheir conduct set them apart—\nJiang Jian and Xin Tong of Laiyang.\nIn Wendeng, they attended the jiao rites,\nundaunted by frost and wind.\nTraveling nearly a thousand li,\nthey sought the altar,\npresenting their petition to Ma Yu and Jiang Gong.\nUpholding filial piety,\nthe magistrate, hearing of this,\nrewarded their extraordinary merit with fine wine.\n\nSincere and devout,\ntheir prayers met with response—\nas the jiao rites concluded,\nan immortal appeared amidst the clouds.\nThey summoned a master painter\nto capture his wondrous visage.\nFrom then on, in motion and stillness,\nthey turned the wheel,\nnavigating the palace of yin and yang.\nForsaking worldly affairs,\ntheir fellow villagers admired and revered them,\nholding them in ever higher esteem.\n\n**To the Leaders of the Laiyang County Jiao Ritual**\nZhong Zhen of Gaomi,\nJiang Jian of Laiyang,\nand Xin Shi, known for restoring temples.\nThey invited me to perform the

of thin gruel sufficed—\nyet they mustered full and perfect effort.\nThrough empowerment, not carelessly,\nthey trampled the jade mountains to dust,\nnurturing the golden treasury within.\nThey sought the coupling of tiger and dragon,\nto birth the primal visage,\nto gather and refine their spirit,\nawakening and cleansing—\nthat all lost souls might be delivered,\nascending together to Penglai’s palace.\nLet all heed this counsel,\nunite in joyful goodness,\nfor Daoist and Buddhist alike are revered.\n\n**Attending the Great Jiao Ritual at Huanglu, Dengzhou**\nBefore Pine-Cypress

people come,\nseeking deliverance for the departed,\nwith a thousand words, ten thousand pleas,\nearnestly entreating—\nthey but strengthen their fasting and abstinence,\nbowing from afar toward the

A month later, Master Chongyang arrived, pointing to where the crane had risen and instructing that a hut be built there.\n\nYu further dreamed of following his master into a mountain. The next day, his master bestowed upon him the childhood name *Shantong*.\n\nXuan followed his master to Nanjing. As the year drew to a close, the master prepared to depart the world.\n\nYu sought to leave the world in distress.\nThe master said: *\"I have already written of this beforehand on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Guanzhong.\"*\n\nYu informed the master of his three wishes:\nFirst, to print and circulate the *Complete Perfection Collection* of the master.\nThe master replied: *\"It is already settled in Chang’an.\"*\nSecond, to observe mourning for the master for three years.\nThe master said: *\"The old hut site in Liujiang Village will suffice for your dwelling.\"*\nThird, to exhort parents of all directions to cast off the mundane and cultivate immortality.\nThe master said: *\"Enough. Ascend in rosy clouds.\"*\n\nI parted ways at Daliang, passed through Luoyang, entered Tong Pass, crossed Mount Hua, and visited Jingzhao. A Daoist friend urged me to stay, and I lingered for several days in Master Kong’s hut.\n\nMaster Shi of Liquan came seeking me, and we met at the tea house by the eastern gate. When asked his name, he said: *\"I am Shi Fengzi of Liquan, also a disciple of Perfected Chongyang.\"* Hearing this, I rejoiced greatly, for the master had often spoken of his worth.\n\nAfter tea, I strolled idly beneath the Taiping Tower. Daoist friend Yang the Second invited me to stay, and as we sipped tea, Master Shi arrived. He again offered bows, but I reproved him: *\"Since you are a disciple of Master Chongyang, why so many courtesies? How can a Daoist live by bowing two or three times a day?\"*\n\nI knew beforehand that this gentleman feared begging in the streets, so I sought to provoke him. I wished to share a pot of wine with him, but the host was unsure. Master Shi drew coins from his robe, but I said: *\"No need for these. Go to the streets, beg for money, and buy wine.\"* After staring for a while, he went to beg and returned with wine. I drank alone, and when he asked for a poem, I composed ten quatrains to bestow upon him:\n\n*What shame is there in a walking corpse and moving bones?*\n*Do not let clothing and food stir up needless sorrow.*\n*Learn from me—stretch your arms in the streets,*\n*Begging as you go, most free and refined.*\n\n**Again**\n*Wealth and honor are but trifles,*\n*While life and nature are as vast as heaven.*\n*Fire, wind, earth, and water are like floating bubbles—*\n*First see through this illusory body.*\n\n**Again**\n*Today, I truly meet a worthy one,*\n*Do not let household affairs create karmic debt.*\n*Subdue your self and go begging—*\n*Daily life will naturally become effortless.*\n\n**Again**\n*Ma Feng does not love the wine in the cup,*\n*But leads you to stretch your hands idly in the streets.*\n*Pass the days as you will, aiding the Dao’s growth,*\n*No need to concoct medicine to idle away your mouth.*\n\n**Again**\n*Take this coarse wine to aid my spirit,*\n*Rely on the jade nectar to nourish your celestial truth.*\n*Who knows that the drunker one becomes, the more clear and free?*\n*One day, your merit complete, you’ll be a person of the Three Isles.*\n\n**Again**\n*No wife, no son, no daughter—*\n*Heaven grants you carefree ease; best to awaken.*\n*Do not deceive your heart or mock others,*\n*For unseen spirits ever watch over you.*\n\n**Again**\n*Let go of all you once cherished,*\n*Hasten to withdraw and seek beyond the world.*\n*What you seek is not apart from the inch-square of your heart—*\n*Be selfless and upright, and you’ll find a true friend.*\n\n**Again**\n*The celestial mechanism dare not be lightly imparted,*\n*Observe carefully whether you awaken or not.*\n*When hardship comes, forget your home—*\n*Then I will point you to the path of longevity.*\n\n**Again**\n*Fleeting fame and profit are hard enough to seek;*\n*Once gained, you’ll lie in an earthen mound.*\n*Do not think immortality a trifling matter—*\n*It requires merit and conduct to reach Yingzhou.*\n\n**Again**\n*To become an immortal, you must awaken fully,*\n*Cast aside the ten thousand worldly ties in one stroke.*\n*Always find even your shadow too much—*\n*Then you’ll naturally have an immortal to guide you.*\n\n**For the Daoist Friends of Chang’an**\nAt every household’s gate, the Dao of Chang’an,\nIn every courtyard, the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\nWith a single step unmoved, one transcends the dharma-realm,\nWith three faces all-pervading, one attains cool clarity.\n\n**Matching the Rhyme of Guo Zicong’s Instruction for Chang’an**\nLuminous and pure, the divine radiance shines abundantly,\nNaturally, the monkey and horse are not driven.\nTurning deeper, one awakens to the path of mysterious penetration—\nI wonder if Fen Yang has received the message.\n\n**Matching Magistrate Lu’s Rhyme**\nA single body becomes the circling wall,\nA carefree spirit-child dwells within.\nThough mute, it speaks words of profound mystery,\nDo not let the monkey and horse run wild.\n\n**For Kong the Elder and His Brother Peng Ziyuan of Chang’an**\nAt forty-eight, I came to Chang’an,\nSeeking the regard of various gentlemen with discerning eyes.\nToday, I extend myself to those who know me—\nSpeaking of cultivation, I reveal the coiled dragon and tiger.\n\n**Again**\nHut-master Kong and Peng Ziyuan,\nAlong with all Daoist kin, early sought the mysterious.",

ties, let all affairs cease,\nNaturally, the true cause is grasped.\nThe vital and harmonious essence pierces the cinnabar cave,\nThe awakened spirit-child ascends the jade tower.\n\n**Again**\nUnmoved by external pleasures, untouched by greed or wrath,\nBlending with the world, radiant in speech and laughter.\nI only wish that all gentlemen share my resolve—\nTogether we cultivate and ascend as immortals.\n\n**Again**\nRoaming beyond the mundane, the spirit is fortified,\nFree from care, forgetting schemes, uniting with the supreme truth.\nRealize that non-contention marks the highest adept,\nEver embracing forbearance, one becomes an immortal.\n\n**Again**\nDaoist joy is most fitting,\nPassionately fond of song and revelry, utterly enchanted.\nIn purity and stillness lies true delight,\nNaturally, sleeves dance into the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nOn Sanji Mountain, the rustic refines the great elixir,\nWithin the jade furnace, snow blankets all.\nAwakened, one no longer flaunts a bearded might,\nBut humbly invites others to look with discerning eyes.\n\n**Again**\nAwakened, one feels no shame in begging for scraps,\nHow could fame or profit sway my being?\nI urge all gentlemen to relinquish attachment,\nAnd swiftly follow Ma Yu in seeking the formless.\n\n**Again**\nSwiftly focus the mind, restrain the monkey-heart,\nCirculate the pure and void, let metal and wood flow.\nThrough ninefold refinement, the great medicine is perfected,\nForever as immortal kin, dwelling on Yingzhou.\n\n**Inscribed at the Hall of Reverence for Antiquity, Office of the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, for Secretary Wang Qingu**\n\nMaster Wang’s nature ever reveres antiquity,\nWithin his hall, dragons and tigers idly harmonize.\nDay by day, month by month, inversion is achieved,\nNaturally, the embryonic immortal dances forth.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu’s visage is ancient,\nHaving awakened to the lofty dragon and the watery tiger.\nHe submits to the wondrous mystery within the supreme principle,\nDaring to dance with Ma and Feng upon the streets.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu upholds the primordial,\nBefore heaven and earth, the true dragon and tiger.\nEmerging from height, entering the depths, east or west at will,\nStartling the elixir-child to dance in response.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Qingu comprehends the eternal,\nNurturing dragon and tiger within the formless.\nClear and pure, the primordial origin is revealed,\nThe carefree spirit-child dances before all.\n\n**At Mafang, Visiting Lecturer Li the Younger Reading the *Nanhua Jing***\n\nTo seek texts and trace antiquity is to know much,\nYet awakening to the *Nanhua* deepens the mystery.\nBetter to cast aside the ten thousand entanglements,\nStruggle free to grasp the one and ascend the celestial ladder.\n\n**For Abbot Liu of Mafang Hermitage**\n\nWith whole heart enter the Dao, reaching the journey’s end,\nThe two qi harmonized, gathered with utmost care.\nThe three treasures—essence, spirit, qi—conjoin,\nThrough the four seasons, converging toward Yingzhou.\n\n**For Little Zhang of Hu County**\n\nWhen the young one asks of the Dao, the Dao remains wordless,\nYet purity sustains the most wondrous mystery.\nRely on this ancestral way, ever preserved,\nNaturally, one has the destiny to become a divine immortal.\n\n**For Little Wang of Hu County**\n\nYoung one, listen to the nurturing of the spirit-child,\nBy karmic cause, you follow the Ma-Feng lineage.\nThrough non-action and purity, awaken fully,\nNaturally, your cloud-steps reach Penglai Palace.\n\n**For Xu Qingshen of Qingzhen**\n\nEver entangled in the fiery household, never seeing the end,\nA single body vainly bears a family’s sorrows.\nEven if you settle all for them, it remains unsettled—\nBetter to still the heart and cease at once.\n\n**For Wu Jieyuan of Hu County**\n\nI encountered immortals, others encountered me,\nYet they remain like me, consumed by smoke and fire.\nNurturing qi, preserving truth, unstained by dust,\nNaturally, one has the destiny to bear immortal fruit.\n\n**For Duwu the Fifth of Hu County**\n\nTo cultivate immortality, first subdue self and ego,\nThen within the waters, nurture the true fire.\nIntent diminished, heart forgotten, without a speck of dust,\nThe elixir of nature congeals, the fruit of success ripens.\n\n**Passing the Hanpi Verdant Hall in the Hu Countryside, Composed for Liang the Maiden of Yaozhou**\n\nForm is emptiness, emptiness is form,\nForm and emptiness both forgotten.\nSince awakening to the form within emptiness,\nSuddenly, the heart-lotus exudes jade-green fragrance.\n\n**For Magistrate Pei of Li Springs**\n\nBefore your eyes, children grow into adults,\nTheir whiskers and beards like tarnished silver.\nDo not blame my haggard and worn appearance—\nThey have stolen my finest spirit.\n\n**For Master He of Chunhua, Gift of a Mottled Bamboo Staff as Travel Provision**\n\nA single stalk, truly a dragon-transforming timber,\nStruck to vanquish the three corpses, demons, and specters.\nBlood-stained, mottled like tortoiseshell,\nI gift it to you, to bear on your journey to Penglai.\n\n**On the Lower Prime Day of the Ding-You Year, Exiting the Encircled Wall**\n\nDancing thus, truly hastened,\nRecognizing the eternal origin’s true visage.\nMaster Father and Master Uncle descend to the

Pure and Serene Perfected of Universal Clarity.\nHaving just passed Fufeng, I turned back in haste,\nSpecially visiting Qiyang to boast of my discerning eyes.\nAgain encountering my original master, obtaining the great elixir,\nHe instructed me to establish east, west, south, and north.\n\n**On the Twenty-Eighth Day of the Mid-Winter Month, Re-Entering the Encircled Wall**\n\nThe wind howls, the wind-horse departs,\nRoaming the northwest clouds for over a month.\nYet longing for my former retreat, I return,\nLeaping once more into the encircled wall.\n\n**Sealing the Doors and Windows**\n\nFrom Kunyu, Sanji, and Ma Mountain, the rustic,\nI firmly seal the doors and windows ninefold.\nRevolving Kan and Li, Geng and Jia,\nUnconcerned with south or north, east or west.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\n\nIn the early winter of the Wuyin year of the Dading era, I journeyed from Longmen to the Taihe Hermitage in Huating, staying over ten days, intending to brush my sleeves and head for Kongtong.\nOn that day, I lingered only in the eastern quarters, staying one or two days at Master Gong’s hermitage.\nAt the time, there were Liu Zhaoxin, Pei Daqi, Li Dacheng, and over ten fellow Daoists from the city and suburbs.\nI exhorted them through the night, yet not one turned their heart toward the Dao.\nThe next day, about to depart, I left this quatrain:\n\nThe cinnabar-refined Yang’s jade nature unfolds,\nCloud-roaming the northwest, selecting immortal timber.\nThe brocade-scaled fish eludes the empty cast,\nI reel in my line and return.\n\n**Li Dacheng of the Fishing Middle, Again Using the Previous Rhyme**\n\nThe foolish one’s nature suddenly opens wide,\nA single spark of numinous yang, called chosen timber.\nLet no dust or grime dim the heart,\nIn clarity, transmit the wondrous mystery.\n\n**Four More Poems for Li Dacheng**\n\nYou’ve hooked the lost from the sea of suffering,\nTogether we walk and sit, freely roaming.\nEntrusting the true within the heart, refining nature,\nAttaining the wondrous, penetrating the mysterious, we wander the ten isles.",

to the cinnabar clouds of the celestial grotto,\nFirst tread the Jasper Isle within the gourd.\n\nOnce more,\nHow fares the Great Vehicle’s harmonized essence?\nUnattached, far surpassing all else uncelebrated.\nNature like a solitary cloud or lone crane,\nFree and at ease—nothing surpasses this.\n\n**Returning the Black Cap to Magistrate Zhao**\nCarving through darkness, cleaving ignorance, no longer foolish,\nAble to distinguish black from white, the jade nature crimson.\nMaster Wumao awakens to the bright moon,\nThe Red Pine Immortal scorns the pure wind.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\nLi Jichuan dreamed of receiving a quatrain from Master Cuan, and I thus matched it in praise:\nMaster Cuan once bowed to me as teacher,\nHis will steadfast, never for a moment wavering.\nAfter the cicada’s molt, roots clearly seen,\nBy chance he descended to the world and left behind these verses.\n\n**To Abbot Zhang Dawu of Huating County**\nUpright words must be heeded,\nRefine the root, solidify the source, qi steadies the spirit.\nIf the horse and monkey remain unruly,\nGuard against unforeseen calamity befalling the body.\n\n**To a Daoist Friend of Huating County**\nHorse-like wind, compassionate vows emulating Vimalakīrti,\nEver grieving for the multitudes suffering deeply.\nExhortations in verse, if awakened to,\nSpare them from rushing into fire like moths.\n\n**To Madame He, Wife of Jiao Gong**\nYouth has passed, yet still clinging to the boudoir,\nPity the deluded, unaware of autumn’s approach.\nBefore becoming utterly withered and worn,\nSeek the wondrous mystery early, don the lotus crown soon.\n\n**On the Winter Solstice, Gifting Charcoal to Vice Prefect Li Zhenguo of Longzhou**\nYang revives, the year renews,\nI laugh at the poet’s excessive toil.\nBreathing on the brush, madly chanting, inscribing jade slips,\nEvery thought and impulse—charcoal for dark fuel.\n\nOnce more,\nHeaven’s Dao offers two paths to humanity,\nIn winter’s month, none are spared.\nScorching heat, proud qi mingling with ice,\nIn a poor hut’s cold stillness, even fire feels chill.\n\n**Thanking Liu Sanlang of Longzhou for the Sheepskin Robe**\nFrost clouds uniform, no variation,\nSix-petaled flakes drift, sealing the old pass.\nDeep gratitude to the true Daoist friend from Pengcheng,\nGifting me this fur robe to withstand winter’s cold.\n\n**Parting from Longzhou**\nWater and clouds wander by rule,\nFlowing or reversing, none can fathom.\nWithin, revolving the mechanism of heaven and earth,\nComprehending the root source, truly one attains.\n\n**On the Twenty-Ninth Day of the Seventh Month, Gengzi Year, Inscribed on the Eastern Wall of the Southern Dipper Pavilion at Taiping Palace, Zhongnan**\nFleeting as wind harms a speck of dust—gone,\nWho

for Rain in Chang’an**\nBarefoot, horse-like wind, praying for rain,\nHeart’s incense curls toward the immortal court.\nWhen will the plow receive its due moisture?\nFive fives never stray from twenty-five.\n\nOnce more,\nShoots wither, the myriad people grieve,\nBurning heart’s incense, auspicious qi rises.\nPraying again, the Three Perfected descend together,\nA sudden downpour—autumn’s harvest assured.\n\n**Encountering a Crane While Visiting Gu Moke’s Study**\nCloud companions, rosy friends attend the feast,\nStep by step, Gui Peak before me.\nI seek the guest by the green lotus pool,\nOthers see the yellow crane’s immortal from the grotto.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\nAbbot Wuchang of Wutai came to serve tea, asking:\n“They say clouds drift in azure skies, water rests in a vase—how

deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nNine-turning effort lies in the workings,\nDo not say delving into the wondrous is irrelevant.\nThe profound principle is hard for people to grasp,\nBefore attaining clarity, endure the deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nAbandoning that, clinging to this,\nLoving the immortal’s essence, enduring shame.\nWood and metal’s threefold mystery,\nNot wild words or clever deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nKan and Li exchange positions, circulating,\nComing and going, not externally.\nI wish to confide in those who know me,\nBut others cling, calling it foolish.\n\nOnce more,\nThe Dao’s law is naturally distinct,\nThe wondrous mystery attained through sincerity.\nHeaven’s mechanism is profound, not the common Dao,\nWithout meeting a true teacher, all is deceit.\n\nOnce more,\nI have awakened to this and that,\nRegardless of others’ concern or indifference.\nLearning the Dao stems from true attainment,\nDeceiving others is self-deception.\n\nOnce more,\nDragons and snakes rise from land, qi surging,\nSun and moon share a palace, not the ten stems.\nFollowing this cultivation, immortality is certain,\nDo not say Ma Yu deceives others.\n\nOnce more,\nImmortal scriptures speak of refining and holding,\nYet deluded people refuse to act.\nManaging household affairs in the mundane world, boasting of enlightenment,\nClearly, one deceives one’s own heart.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with the Silver Brothers of Yaozhou**\nMeeting the profound, interest endures,\nHeart opens, awakens—best to leave the world.\nIndolent at ease, forming true delight,\nLaughable, the busy unaware of their busyness.\n\n**Matching Rhymes Again, Purchasing from the Hou Brothers of Hezhong**\nWithin the gourd, refining, emerald clouds lengthen,\nRepairing gardens and pavilions, no night in that land.\nSeizing the flying crow and running hare,\nNaturally, sun and moon are unhurried.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Magistrate Lei of Shuzheng County**\nYour reputation surpasses Su Qin’s,\nUnlike those who conceal their light, hiding their names.\nBeyond things, carefree and truly unconstrained,\nFrom the beginning, a single point is naturally bright.\n\nOnce more,\nStillness and clarity are the elixir of longevity,\nAbandoning wife and children, no oral transmission.\nAfter awakening, knowing emptiness, not clinging to existence,\nNaturally, good causes and conditions are attained.\n\n**On New Year’s Day**\nSpring and summer return, autumn also shifts,\nLast night’s lingering year-end swept away by the wind.",

ditch?\n\n**Admonition to the Wicked**\nA deep sigh for the wicked,\nWho rely on power to bully others for their own amusement.\nDay by day, their stubborn hearts breed evil;\nIn the end, how will they withstand the torments of the evil realms?\n\n**The Sixteen Battlegrounds**\nFire, wind, earth, and water bind the skin-sack;\nThe four demon-kings of eye, ear, nose, and tongue.\nSelf and others, right and wrong sow the seeds of karma;\nQi, wealth, wine, and lust—these are the execution grounds of men.\n\n**Distinguishing Right from Wrong**\nWind, flowers, snow, and moon bring no true benefit;\nWine, lust, anger, and wealth are all enemies.\nSelf and others, right and wrong summon ghostly destinies;\nOnly in pure tranquility and virtue does the immortal’s boat ferry one across.\n\n**Urging Resolute Entry into the Dao**\nSilken blades, felt arrows, paper spears—\nHow can these seize the immortal’s banner and join the Dao’s current?\nA true man of resolve and

heart.\nRoaming like clouds and water, seek good companions,\nAnd naturally, you will encounter true kindred spirits.\n\n**Instructing Disciples**\nEvery thought and worry harms the spirit;\nHow dare one linger in the dust of entanglements?\nCutting off the ten thousand conditions, all is illusion;\nCultivating the one nature, the whole truth is perfected.\n\n**Again**\nOn the mountain of self and

the lamp of wisdom shines bright;\nAuspicious smoke of the Eight Trigrams billows forth.\nThe ninefold refined golden elixir perfects the jade nature,\nAnd the jeweled path of the Ten Continents lies open for travel.\n\n**To Sister Xue of Songxi, the Recluse**\nThe greatest taboo in cultivation is extravagance;\nShatter every attachment to refine wheat and hemp.\nReversing and cycling yin and yang to penetrate creation,\nNaturally, the furnace yields the great cinnabar.\n\n**To Sister Chai**\nGreat cultivation lies in non-action and non-doing;\nWith intent stilled and heart cleansed, the lamp of wisdom shines.\nIlluminating the nine passes to freely enter and exit,\nOn Kunlun’s peak, one ascends in ascent.\n\n**To Sister Yan of Shuangxi, the Recluse**\nWith whole heart enter the Dao and never turn back;\nThe eight flavors of jade nectar nourish the great elixir.\nThe nine luminaries harmonize to form the true jade nature,\nAnd with full merit, one ascends the immortal’s altar.\n\n**Quatrain**\nAfter the capital’s decree sent me forth,\nI returned home, composing this poem to thank the Commander-in-Chief.\nThis rustic from Sanji Mountain, having met with fortune,\nCame to Qin’s land to refine the clouds and waves.\nReflecting, I take myself back home—\nBetter to request a blade in the hall than remain.\n\n**Quatrain**\nSince the decree compelled my departure,\nI had no choice but to bid farewell to the capital, hence this poem.\nOn the stage of fame and profit, one struts with vanity;\nHow could one willingly still the heart and cultivate beyond the world?\nDo not blame me for reeling in my fishing rod;\nI know my humble verse cannot match a mighty hook.\n\n**To An Gong of Hezhong Prefecture**\nMaster An must awaken to the eternal Chang’an,\nAnd turn that awakening inward as contemplation.\nLet heart and intent not follow the monkey and horse’s turns;\nWhen qi and spirit harmonize, the numinous elixir forms.\n\n**Quatrain**\nPassing through Huangyang Inn, I met Scholar Wang,\nWho spoke of Huang Yingqing’s palace examination at fifty-three, with a poem of self-praise.\nI borrowed his rhyme and composed ten quatrains.\nCarrying scrolls of the *Dao and Virtue* and *Yin Talismans*,\nWith star crown and moon mantle, my cloud robe gleams.\nThe world does not recognize this wanderer of mist and rosy clouds,\nMistaking the topknot of a wind-tossed immortal for demonic obstruction.\n\n**Again**\nWith elixir scriptures in my belly, no need to carry them;\nA hempen robe and paper jacket outshine brocade.\nNow I brush my sleeves and return to Ninghai,\nThirteen companions of the Dao roam the clouds with me.\n\n**Again**\nI vow never to carry jade twists or golden willows;\nWith a carefree

      "translated_text": "**To Master Zhou of Wenshan**\nA man in straw cloak and staff, carefree and idle,\nHeart opened wide, loath to speak of toil.\nWho would believe the grotto-heaven’s paradise,\nWhere no flowers bloom, no willows sway—yet spring abides.\n\n**Again**\nWealth, lust, wine, and beauty most harm men,\nThe fiery household seethes with bitter pain.\nOften they fret not for autumn’s coming scene,\nBlindly clinging to spring before their eyes.\n\n**To Li Maochun of Chang’an**\n□ days hasten, aging man,\n□ suddenly feels suffering, startled by toil.\n□ discerns awakening, turns to the Dao,\n□ thus, Chang’an’s Li Maochun.\n\n*(Breaking the character \"日\" to form the verse.)*\n\n**Again (composing from three characters)**\n□□ often calls you a good man,\n□□ fears hardship, dreads toil.\n□□ knows all stems from filial piety,\n□□ all transmit Li Maochun’s name.\n\n**Regulated Verse in Seven Characters**\n**[In Gratitude to My Master]**\nMaster Chongyang, the Wondrous Practitioner of Compassionate Transformation, drew me from the household—thus I compose this poem to thank my master’s mercy.\n\nThe mountain rustic mused on past freedom,\nAmid the fiery household, worry and sorrow.\nSeeking wealth and rank through myriad hardships,\nEntangling endless grievances in toil.\nPondering life and death—how to escape?\nServing wife and children—when will it end?\nJust as I sought to return, what fortune!\nThe Immortal of the Wind hooked me out to roam the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nThe mountain rustic escaped the fiery pit’s woe,\nEntering the Dao, no longer harmed by sorrow.\nDay by day, carefree in song and chant,\nHour by hour, at ease in joyful praise.\nVerdant mist and purple haze ever his companions,\nBright moon and clear wind his eternal peers.\nGuiding kind souls to the Great Dao,\nCultivating merit to perfection, he ascends to Penglai.\n\n**At Jiande**\nDaoists have no kin yet none are not kin,\nGrieving for all things, grieving for oneself.\nHeart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,\nMind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.\nWorldly realms are constantly swept aside,\nThe flawless garden renews itself daily.\nSilently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,\nHe rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.\n\n**Self-Description**\nThree topknots—yet not out of piety,\nIf asked the reason, how could it be told?\nPromoting the master’s name, one should bear it on the crown,\nConcealing the scholar’s □, the heart remains steadfast.\nWho knows that in this world, the mountain rustic,\nYields not to the unicorn immortal of the celestial court?\nToday I reveal it plainly to you:\nWhen merit is complete, he will tread the clouds and mist.\n\n**Again**\nMyriad entanglements seen through, all return to emptiness,\nFrom this, cultivation bears fruit early.\nThe horse of the mind struggles against deluded love,\nThe monkey of the heart easily falls into folly.\nQi and spirit settle, the golden elixir congeals,\nDragon and tiger clarify, the jade nature glows red.\nI report to fellow practitioners: rely on wondrous use,\nTogether we refine and ascend to Penggong.\n\n**Again**\nDoting on a wife is no wise man,\nLusting after beauty is truly a fool.\nEven slight attachment invites poisonous hands,\nThe merest thought ensnares one in demonic bonds.\nEssence withers, marrow dries, the form grows gaunt,\nQi scatters, spirit wanes, ghosts drag one away.\nI awoke, I startled—best to flee early,\nWhy wait until the funeral drum’s lament?\n\n**Linked Pearls Ode**\nMy heart ails, my heart heals,\nPeople judge right and wrong—who truly knows?\nSearching the wondrous, searching the profound, searching to grasp the true,\nNo contention, no competition, no forced cultivation.\nEver pure, ever still, ever generating goodness,\nDemanding the Dao, demanding practice, demanding salvation from peril.\nCherishing jade, cherishing benevolence, cherishing deliverance,\nRousing the heart, rousing the mind, rousing compassion.\n\n**Regulated Verse**\n**Composed at the Request of Attendant Secretary Wanyan**\nAttendant Secretary Wanyan remarked: \"I did not expect you, Master, would dwell in a thatched hut within walled confines, enduring such carefree simplicity.\" Thus, I composed this.\n\nWithin the Horse Family Alley, the Ma family’s home,\nNorth residence, south garden—nothing to boast.\nWhat glory and splendor are not mere livelihood?\nThis carefree ease is the finest way of life.\nBody and mind depart the vulgar, refining the golden cavern,\nClouds and waters turn to the mysterious, planting jade sprouts.\nSuddenly, the world before my eyes feels narrow,\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon congeal the numinous cinnabar.\n\n**Ode to Autumn Scenery**\nThe year’s finest scene lies in late autumn,\nThe Dipper points west, fire’s course flows.\nVital qi gathers essence, revealing wondrous use,\nFrost flies to meet the season, responding to true cultivation.\nChrysanthemums bloom, ever evoking Tao Qian’s spirit,\nLeaves fall, utterly devoid of Song Yu’s sorrow.\nToward dawn, wind clear, stream bright beneath the moon,\nSomeone awakens and sets forth for Penglai.\n\n**Presented to Liu Bohu of Gaoling, Awaiting the Palace Examination**\nBeyond Pengcheng’s worldly bounds, I search meticulously,\nAt the moment of awakening, all affairs cease.\nSitting or lying, no hindrance to leading the white deer,\nDwelling or walking, unimpeded in guiding the green ox.\nEver pure, ever still—one must recognize this,\nTrue practice, true merit—decisively complete the cycle.\nWhen the ninefold elixir is perfected, depart for Pengdao,\nTo specially seek the ancestral master, Liu Haichan.\n\n**Exhorting Disciples**\nCultivation must abandon lust and wealth,\nBeware the cup’s temptation, lest calamity arise.\nQuickly cast aside the self and others, lay them low,\nHastily strike open the dragon-tiger’s cave.\nThe elixir forms, snow-white pellets gleam in the golden tripod,\nNature congeals, frost-like spheres radiate on the jade terrace.\nWhite clouds ever fly at the grotto’s mouth,\nWhen merit is complete, ascend to Penglai.\n\n**Again**\nContending for fame, competing for profit—endless toil,\nUnnoticed, the visage ages, temples turn gray.\nGreed for wife and children brings bodily suffering,\nHow would one know the Dao’s virtue ever grows?\nI hope you swiftly secure spirit and qi,\nLearn from me, diligently refining lead and mercury’s frost.\nWhen merit and practice accumulate, true nature manifests,\nTogether we shall ascend to Pengzhuang.\n\n**Composed Upon Bringing Li Dacheng into the Walled Abode**\nIn the northwest, by the pavilion stream, a walled abode,\nHere one may well conceal this body.\nBefore my eyes, emerald bamboo—several gentlemen,\nFacing green pines—two great men.\nFlowing water, artificial hills—mere child’s play,\nClear wind, bright moon—do you comprehend?\nIf you can grasp my planting of nine,\nI, within these walls, plant leeks and scallions—thus I dwell here.\nThere is a share of numinous light to ascend to the Jade Capital.\n\n**Presented to Zhang Zhengfu of Danxia Abbey in Qiyang**\nDaoists have no kin yet none are not kin,\nGrieving for all things, grieving for oneself.\nHeart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,\nMind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.\nWorldly realms are constantly swept aside,\nThe flawless garden renews itself daily.\nSilently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,\nHe rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.",

need for foot’s labor to tread jade peaks.\n\n**Presented to Li Dacheng, with respects to Abbot Jinggong**\n\nWithin encircling walls, most serene,\nThe Dao’s abode—pure emptiness—claims two rafters.\nDeeply I cherish the bamboo’s gentlemanly resolve,\nHow I admire the pine’s aged, virtuous wisdom.\nEight channels’ limpid waters distill as clear wine,\nFive Peaks’ linked summits rise like verdant lotuses.\nThough Confucian scholars serve as beneficent friends,\nWithout the Three Teachings united, no harmony is complete.\n\n**Presented to Master Zhang of Jingyang**\n\nAt sixty-four, the hexagrams near their close,\nSuddenly awakened, heart reduced to ashes, I wander beyond the mundane.\nSeeking me, you submit to true awakening,\nDelving into mysteries, probing subtleties, you cultivate with devotion.\nYour topknot parted like cloud-and-aurora companions,\nYour hands raised like wind-and-moon comrades.\nBowing, you further clarify the precious principle—\nNaturally, you

words.\nSimurgh and phoenix soar to nest in jade caverns,\nTiger and dragon roar to enter golden gates.\nWithin the gourd, heaven and earth’s marrow is refined,\nWithin the grotto, the roots of heaven

      "translated_text": "**On Gratitude**\n\nThe grace of heaven and earth, sun and moon, father and mother,\nCannot lift me from the depths of sinking.\nBrothers and sisters—brief acquaintances,\nWives and children—even less akin.\nFortune met the Wind Immortal, who transmitted secret formulas,\nEnabling Ma Yu to attain good causes.\nSevering passions, cutting attachments, harmonizing dragon and tiger,\nAbandoning cares, forgetting schemes, birthing phoenix and qilin.\nWithin jade, gold is born; the elixir coalesces as treasure,\nIn water, fire is nurtured; qi settles the spirit.\n\nThe master’s grace runs deep—impossible to repay,\nI vow to circle the walls in death, refining the utmost truth.\n\n---\n\n**Lyrics: Tenfold Gratitude (Originally \"Auspicious Partridge\")**\n\n**First Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nBeyond the world’s dust, a life rare to hear of:\nTempering the jade furnace with snow from three ravines,\nPerfecting the golden tripod with clouds from a single stream.\nDragons ought to bathe in fire,\nFierce tigers may burn in water.\nA single grain of divine elixir shines through jade,\nIts numinous radiance peerless, transcending all.\n\n**Second Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nI swear to cultivate, resolve to refine the heart:\nFire’s flames extinguished, fire nurtures wood,\nMercury exhausted, water gives birth to gold.\nWood and gold in three realms open the mysterious path,\nWater and fire flow as one, forming a treasure peak.\nWith enduring vision, the great elixir is complete, never leaking,\nBearing clouds, I depart, free from rising and sinking.\n\n**Third Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nRefining the numinous embryo in the Jade Capital:\nLead and mercury simmer—first come signs,\nTiger and dragon mate—how could there be no sound?\nThree luminaries shine together, surpassing the three meditations,\nFive peaks merge as one, issuing from the five phases.\nWhen the three-five elixir is complete, true creation is achieved,\nNaturally stepping upon clouds to visit Penglai.\n\n**Fourth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nHeaven and earth gathered into the treasure vase,\nSun and moon, mountains and rivers enhance its splendor,\nTiger and dragon, infant and maiden find peace.\nLight and clear, heavy and turbid—yin and yang aligned,\nVast and deep, lofty and bright—all things imbued with spirit.\nThe radiant red elixir completes nature and life,\nTranscendent, riding a crane across the celestial court.\n\n**Fifth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nI swear never to be tainted by wine, lust, anger, or wealth.\nFirst, I drive away the solar crow,\nThen firmly seize the lunar hare.\nThe moon’s wheel shines anew, without wax or wane,\nThe sun’s brilliance intensifies, without dimming or sinking.\nWhen merit is full and the elixir complete, where shall I go?\nBeyond the cloudy Han, free from yin and yang.\n\n**Sixth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nUnfettered, carefree, untouched by dust:\nSeeing through the false body as truly false,\nProbing the true nature as truly real.\nOnly then knowing the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,\nOnly then realizing the unspiritual is the source of the spiritual.\nWith the pure elixir complete, I ride the red phoenix,\nIn the Great Luo Heaven, savoring eternal spring.\n\n**Seventh Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nGrasping emptiness, stilling the mercury of death:\nCattle and sheep fill the path, lying in my way,\nA pavilion of wind and moon proves one’s purity.\nClear and pure, hard to be deceived by the false,\nPure and clear, easy to perceive the real.\nWhen the dragon-tiger elixir is complete, no nine revolutions needed,\nNaturally, eternally, I become an immortal.\n\n**Eighth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nReversing yin and yang, relying on refinement and cooking:\nFire descends, water ascends, casting snow-like waves,\nDragon’s roar, tiger’s howl, unleashing thunderous sounds.\nThe jade furnace’s auspicious snow layers upon layers,\nThe golden tripod’s propitious light softly arises.\nThe priceless elixir complete, no aging or death,\nOn the path of long life, the dharma-body is light.\n\n**Ninth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nMind pure, heart clear, the path smooth and level:\nUsing non-action as creation,\nNot relying on effort for enterprise.\nJust like luring dragon and tiger,\nOr harmonizing maiden and infant.\nWith the elixir of living joy complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,\nWhere Master He and my teacher come from afar to welcome me.\n\n**Tenth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**\nShattering the golden willow, the jade shackles of emotion:\nIn the Gate of Enduring Vision, cultivating endurance,\nOn the Path of Long Life, attaining longevity.\nDim and silent, limpid and deep,\nVast and obscure, pure and clear.\nAt dawn, the elixir complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,\nWhere Master Chongyang comes from afar to welcome me.\n\n---\n\n**Expressing Feelings #1**\nNo entanglements in the realm of profit and fame,\nNo flames of self and others in the crowd.\nWith intent, I wander mountains—upon their ridges,\nWith joy, I delight in waters—beside their clouds.\nComing and going, drifting like a solitary crane,\nStaying or leaving, serene as a cicada.\nHow many can attain such carefree ease?\nLet others say I live as a divine immortal.\n\n**Begging in the Streets**\nSpare a coin, good people, to aid the poor and forge karmic ties.\nSilently, it returns a hundredfold,\nOpenly, it nurtures my three fields.\nAbandoning stinginess opens the heart’s ground,\nSevering attachment unlocks the wondrous mystery.\nOne day, awakened, I leave the sea of suffering,\nCarefree beyond the world, cultivating immortality together.\n\n**Exhorting Disciples**\nThe Daoist’s livelihood does not intrude,\nEach seeks their own clothing and food.\nAvoid idle words and quarrels,\nLet go of worldly affairs and worldly cares.\nProbe the profound, abandon thoughts—dragons follow tigers,\nSeek the hidden, forget schemes—water nurtures gold.\nPurify the colored body to preserve the dharma-body,\nWhen the elixir in the furnace is ripe, step upon the jade peak.\n\n**A Daoist Friend Asks If One Can Cultivate at Home**\nTo be an immortal yet cling to a wife is folly,\nStealing moments from busyness to seek the Dao.\nThe gate of purity remains unrecognized,\nLustful desires and deceptive arts seize the heart.\nSeeking both family and Dao to be perfect—how?\nHow to savor the sweetness of solitude?\nDo not wait for Fengdu’s summons to arrive,\nReturn early beyond the world to dwell in a cloudy hermitage.\n\n**Presented to Marshal Li**\nMake your body a cinnabar mound,\nWithin, ever wandering clouds and waters.\nLi and Kan palaces exchange as true midnight and noon,\nJia and Geng positions shift, erasing spring and autumn.\nThe five phases and four images are all without use,\nYet the three isles and ten continents have their reasons.\nWith merit and conduct unblemished, clouds and cranes guide you,\nIn the Great Luo Heaven, ranked among the immortals.\n\n**Meeting Daoist Friends During the Cold Food Festival**\nCold food forbids fire, restrains the mind-monkey,\nTrue breath regulated, eternally continuous.\nNot roaming clouds and waters along fragrant grass paths,\nHow could body and mind cling to the apricot blossom sky?\nDo not become a tomb-bound ghost,\nLearn from me to cultivate as an immortal beyond the world.\nOne day, the great elixir completes its nine revolutions,\nAscending the void—why need to swing on a swing?\n\n**Presented to Zhang Shubiao of Jingyang**\nAt sixty-four, the hexagrams near their end,\nSuddenly awakened, heart like cold ashes, leaving the worldly.\nSeeking me to probe the true and return to right awakening,\nProbing the profound, seeking the hidden, practicing cultivation.",

Blazing and radiant, they illuminate the jade path. Then they transform into a single divine pearl, pointing the way to Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**Exhortation to Disciples**\nAvoid vain pretenses, avoid vain pretenses. Do not lean upon non-leaning, nor trifle with the Dao. Preserving nature and life is no ordinary matter—strike decisively and settle it completely. O child of the homeless life, display your skill.

and spotless,\nnaturally lucid and smooth.\nOriginally without lack.\nWithin the jade crucible and golden tripod,\nyellow sprouts and white snow.\nTrue dragon and tiger—\ncoiling around the nodes of the pass.\nThe joy of the alchemical infant.\nBearing Kunlun’s summit,\nbursting through clouds and mist,\nheaven knows no day or night—\never revealing one luminous moon.\n\n**To All Daoist Friends**\nHorse Wind earnestly implores,\nall noble friends of the Dao.\nDo not be deluded by the false—\nwithin, what is worthy endures.\nSeek longevity.\nEmploy true effort wholly in\npurifying the

west?\nCinnabar exists only in laughter and conversation.\nLife and destiny are not governed by heaven and earth.\nWith one precious word, bidding farewell to the mountain recluse,\nthe feathered wheel swiftly carries him to Penglai’s palace.\n\n**Arousing Compassion #2**\nMa Yu often relies on Buddhist practice,\nfrom the heart of non-doing, arousing compassion,\nresponding to cries of suffering as conduct.\n\nAll women and men as one’s parents,\nseeing their lives and deaths in dire peril—\none must establish a ladder to heaven.\n\n**Establishing the Ladder**\nErecting the true heavenly ladder,\nformless, shadowless, without foundation,\na swift path entering non-doing.\nAt ease, carefree—\ntrue livelihood,\never pure, ever still, delighting in the subtle.\nNaturally, heaven and earth all return.\n\n**To Master Yu**\nThe candle of nature shines, illuminating the jade flask,\nthe incense of the heart wafts fragrantly in the golden crucible,\ndrinking the blade and spoon to intoxication in true suchness.\nBefore the Flower Calyx Tower, a horse gallops sideways,\nin Huayin County, a donkey is ridden backward—\nthe youth of the Five Spirits holds the divine pearl.\n\n**To Master Hao**\nGreat awakening—floating life, no attachment to home,\nthe great vehicle’s essence, unadorned,\ngreat penetration of the mysterious and wondrous, without boasting.\nGreat virtue establishes true livelihood,\ngreat elixir refined—a fine livelihood,\ngreat merit accomplished, stepping into mist and clouds.\n\n**To the Daoist Under the Hall**\nIdle right and wrong must not be heard,\nhow can one daily engage in self-discourse?\nSecretly harming merit and conduct, damaging the subtle vapors.\nThe tongue is the root of disaster—firmly seal it,\nordinarily, restrain the opening of misfortune’s gate,\nnaturally, life and destiny endure.\n\n**Self-Recitation**\nBreaking precepts, the mountain recluse speaks at length,\nenduring others’ shame and humiliation without remorse,\nlately, fondly drinking jade nectar.\nMysterious jade, mysterious gold fill the precious tripod,\ntrue man, true woman fill the elixir chamber—\ngreedily awaiting residence in Penglai’s estate.\n\n**Expressing My Heart**\nExternal pleasures never stir the inner heart,\nwithin, no mouth yet chanting,\neach sound pure and elegant, piercing the jade grove.\nTo truly listen, one must listen yet not hear,\nlike the deaf and blind—yet can be pursued.\nThen, immortals and buddhas become confidants.\n\n**To Masters Gan and Zhang**\nPure and still, non-doing seals the secret mechanism,\ngolden waves and jade ripples congeal into blade and spoon.\nMarvelous! Wondrous! Reaching the most profound subtlety.\nSeizing the dim and silent,\nable to eat, able to drink, even more able to carry—\nfrom nothingness, nurturing the transformed child.\n\n**To Master Zhu**\nOne meal of fragrant wild vegetable stew,\nfacing the stream, bamboo before him, chanting verses,\nunfazed by the turning of jia and geng.\nWhat is the Daoist’s true livelihood?\nAt high noon, striking the third watch,\nplowing together with clouds and moon.\n\n**To Yu the Tile of Ninghai**\nThe water dog spouts smoke, veiling the jade pavilion,\nthe fire ox enters the sea to plant the magic field,\nwhite lotus blossoms interspersed with blue.\nThe blue-eyed foreign monk’s brows sweep the earth,\nthe frost-haired rabbit’s horns pierce the sky—\nthe Tathāgata’s perfect sign is originally round.\n\n**To the Daoist Under the Hall**\nAbandoning family ties, further abandoning the body,\nnot feeding tigers or saving starving eagles—\nseeing through the illusory form, forgetting oneself.\nNo shame, no disgrace, no defilement,\ncarefree and unobstructed, qi and spirit clear—\nthe true buddha within the heart manifests radiance.\n\n**To Li Jichuan of Huating**\nEleven of us comrades came as one,\nten are bound by karma, their hearts not yet extinguished—\ndo not let them lose footing and fall into the wheel of rebirth.\nEarly, early, turn to the mysterious and leave the sea of suffering,\nleisurely, leisurely refine qi and nurture the numinous embryo—\nupon merit’s completion, together ascend to Penglai.\n\n**To Immortal Zhang**\nResolute in cultivation, a true man,\nsingle-minded and devoted, avoiding the three paths,\npure as ice, spotless as jade—without a speck of dust.\nIn emptiness, human heads joyfully fall,\nwithin the flask, the Dipper’s handle turns freely—\nthe elixir completed, ninefold refined, riding the cloud chariot.\n\n**To Masters Wang and Liu**\nDo not treat cultivation as trivial,\na still body is not as good as a still mind—\ncirculate the sun and moon, do not let them idle.\nNurture the lower elixir without leakage,\nthen ascend to the crimson tower to refine the central elixir,\nfilling the upper numinous palace, attaining the three elixirs.\n\n**Reusing the Previous Rhyme**\nNurturing the three elixirs, yet not idle,\ntransforming people to enter the Dao, recognizing true leisure—\ntrue joy, true bliss, responding to true idleness.\nFurther refining the three elixirs into one,\npracticing merit to perfection, revealing the divine elixir—\nthe fetal immortal presents the purple golden elixir.",

envy for mortal wealth and rank.\nHe built a walled abode,\nshielding from wind, frost, and rain.\nBy day and night, he mended the numinous light—\none day, his work complete, he shall depart.\nTo dwell in Penglai’s grotto-palace,\nserving our Master.\n\n**Sent to Three Daoist Friends: Tan, Liu, and Hao #2**\nTan Feng, Liu, and Hao—cloud and mist friends,\ncarefree, wandering at ease.\nWhen the mood wanes, best return to Shaanxi’s west,\nto speak of the *wu* within *you*.\nEver pure, ever still, ever free from leakage—\nthen tiger and dragon unite in embrace.\nWithin this, no divine yet divine splendor,\nbut the draught of immortality’s wine.\n\n**On Meeting Ma Feng**\nMa Feng, once a rich man’s son—\nwhy cast off wife and child?\nNow a drifting, impoverished soul,\nuntil he met Master Chongyang.\nFrom then, styled \"Master Danyang,\"\nworldly affairs vanished without trace.\nAwakened to the truth of man’s birth—\nhe shall surely become an immortal.\n\n**Self-Realization**\nFather and elder brothers passed before their time—\nno need for divination henceforth.\nSurely the wheel turns to me next—\nhow to escape birth and death?\nAwakened, I become a fleeting shadow,\nlet others guess and shatter their hearts.\nRecognize the true *somewhat* within—\nthen share in the clouds’ embrace.\n\n**Thinking of Gao of Liaoyang’s Great Talent**\n*To the Tune \"Remembering an Old Friend at Taoyuan\"*\nSince parting, I often dwell in restless longing.\nWhere now does his official journey lead?\nHe has forgotten our first meeting.\nI now cultivate beyond the world—\nonly wishing he might awaken.\nFiercely abandon glory, wealth, and rank,\nto join the cloud and mist companions.\n\n**To the Kong Brothers of Kong Hermitage**\nFour brothers, Kong—\nthe two youngest have passed.\nNo need for divination hereafter—\njust recall them and shed tears.\nBirth, death—how to avoid?\nBest fiercely cast off worldly ties,\ncultivate beyond the world, accumulate merit,\nand surely attain the immortal’s rank.\n\n**Exhorting Li the Ritual Master of the Three Altars in Chang’an**\nMaster Li, Keeper of the Observances, heed my counsel—\nthis alone is not yet the ultimate ease.\nAwaken to the clarity of water and cloud,\nthe profound mystery of the heart made manifest.\nThe Wooden Man’s skill is no ordinary arrow—\nuse the Three Vehicles to rescue and aid.\nPierce through the palace within—\nthen behold the Tathāgata’s face.\n\n**The Recluse of Taoyuan Asks of the Dao**\nThe recluse of Taoyuan came especially,\nasking of some subtle mystery.\nI spoke of the inversion of *kan* and *li*,\nwater and fire sharing the same furnace.\nTiger and dragon coil to form the elixir-treasure,\nfive-colored auspicious clouds parting the way.\nThey guide forth the embryonic immortal, untouched by age,\nto dwell on Penglai’s isle.\n\n**Master Wutai Yue Comes to Share Tea**\nMaster Wutai Yue, master of the Three Essentials,\nhas expelled the Three Pengs.\nWielding the Three Carts, radiant and bright,\nthey bear the Three Vehicles’ wonders.\nThe Three Assemblies at Dragon Flower—his heart now clear,\nsuddenly the Three Lights shine as one.\nWithin, the Three Altars’ rites are set—\nhe himself has attained the Three Purities.\n\n**To Master Cai and His Wife (Three-Character Stanza)**\n□□Husband and wife, heed my judgment:\n□□Best to relinquish □□.\n□□Let sons be—no need to manage,\n□□for soon they shall be severed.\n□□Entanglements of love, unshackled,\n□□gradually refined by fire.\n□□Bright, luminous, and resplendent,\n□□the mountain rustic calls.\n\n**Another**\nMandarin ducks, not yet old, but hair already white—\nwhat karmic cause is so hard to fathom?\nSpeak the truth, and naturally you shall understand:\nall for clinging to lust and delusion.\nIf one awakens and suddenly flees to rivers and mountains,\ndevoted to cultivating virtue beyond the world—\nthe pure and still Daoist dharma—\nthen dwell in Penglai’s abode.\n\n**To Elder Master Yao**\nFirst in cultivation, cast off worldly ties,\ndo not follow worldly chatter.\nBeware of climbing high then neglecting the low,\ndo not cling to the slightest pretense.\nRestrain the heart’s monkey and the mind’s horse,\ntruly still, truly pure, serene and refined.\nWhen spirit and qi harmonize, awake and free—\nmerit complete, the elixir priceless.\n\n**To Master He, Bound for the Isles, with a Bamboo Staff**\nA Daoist gift, presenting the profound—\nnaturally, a zither rests upon the knee.\nIts sound pierces the nine heavens’ mystery,\ndrawing the green luan to dance.\nFill the cup with flowing rosy clouds—do not refuse—\ntake the nine-jointed numinous branch.\nIt shall aid your steps from the very beginning,\nstraight to Penglai’s path.\n\n**To Zhao Gongchuo Before the Palace Examination**\nToday, the transmission of cultivation’s practice—\nexternally, refine the ten thousand entanglements.\nRefined once, best refine again,\nwhat need to refine if you’ve seen through?\nOnly then, within, leisurely refine—\nthe Six Bandits and Three Corpses, repeatedly refined.\nMirror extinguished, heart forgotten, the elixir refined—\nthen truly refine into reality.\n\n**Another Chant**\nMan is bound by the ten thousand entanglements—\nif you can see through them,\nand further recognize them,\nthen cultivation can be accomplished.\n\n**To Zhang the Keeper of the Lianzhu Abbey**\nAt the Zhenyang Town’s Cinnabar Cloud Abbey,\nAbbot Zhang’s skillful hands.\nSection by section, the Cinnabar Field tended,\never bright and resplendent.\nWithin, the inner landscape truly worth beholding—\nseeing through nature’s rootless chaos.\nThe Dao blesses your long life—\nmay you gain immortals as companions.\n\n**To the Two Masters Liu of Ancient Times**\nYour destiny holds a share in immortal cultivation—\nwhy vie for profit, contend for fame, and suffer a rebuke?\nRestraining desire, defying emotion, sorrow and vexation—\ncompelled to turn back swiftly.\nCounting up, what’s the use of fleeting splendor?\nBetter to preserve your nature and life.\nDirectly recognize the *wuwei* purity—\nthen surely attain immortality.\n\n**To Registrar Wang Yanwen**\nYour destiny holds a share in the immortal’s covenant—\nbeyond that, hard to seek fame and profit.\nWhat you arrange cannot be as you wish—\nthis spurs the resolve to cultivate.\nCounting up, no one can replace you in birth and death—\nhow could you burden yourself with worldly ties?\nTo claim the immortal’s seat on the Ten Isles—\npile up pure and still merit.\n\n**To Officer Li the Fourth**\nLeisurely reflecting on past and present, those who turn back—\ntheir right and wrong, merits and fame achieved.\nYet often, affairs do not go as wished—\nsuddenly awakened, they seek a way to return.\nTranscending the world, brushing aside worldly burdens,\ncultivating merit beyond the world.\nWinning the joy of sages and worthies—\nPeng Island awaits your place.\n\n**To Master Zheng**\nIf you intend to enter the Dao, first turn back—\nhow much more so, now in your sixty-ninth year?\nLife and destiny should be saved early—\ndo not wait until the body withers.\nGuard the *wuwei* purity and stillness—\nnaturally, the divine elixir shall be without leakage.",
