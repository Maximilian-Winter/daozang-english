Shuaihé (Disrupting and Concealing)**\n*Shuai* means to agitate or unsettle.\n*Hé* means to conceal or withdraw.\n\nWhen engaging with others in discourse, one may either **agitate them**, prompting them to reveal their alignment, or **conceal them**, prompting them to reveal their divergence.\n\n**If one examines antiquity**, the Sage, when questioning the cosmos, followed (*ruò*) and considered (*qǐ*) the ancient Dao, teaching accordingly.\n\nThe Sage, as the first among all beings, emerged before all things, using **prior knowledge to enlighten the unknowing**, and **prior enlightenment to awaken the unenlightened**. Thus, the Sage is first among all beings.\n\nObserving the **opening and closing of Yin and Yang**, the Sage named and commanded all things.\nYang opens to generate life; Yin closes to complete it.\nOnce generation and completion are established, names must be assigned to them.\n\nKnowing the **gates of existence and annihilation**—\nDo not forget that those who perish are those who exist, and those who exist are those who perish.\nOnly those who perceive the **omens of fortune and misfortune beforehand** truly grasp the *machine* (critical junctures).\n\nThus it is said: **\"Know the gates of existence and annihilation.\"**\n\nCalculating the **termination and origin of all things**, penetrating the logic of human hearts, and perceiving the **portents of transformation**—\nThe termination and origin of all things, the logic of human hearts, and the portents of transformation are all clearly manifest. Through profound insight, nothing remains obscure or unmeasured. Thus, one can calculate, penetrate, and perceive.\n\n*Zhèn* (portents) means **sudden emergence**.\n\nAnd one **guards and oversees these gates**—\n*Shǐ* means to **maintain and govern**.\nThe gates refer to the **gates of existence and annihilation** mentioned above.\n\nHaving penetrated the principles of things, knowing the termination and origin of existence and annihilation, the Sage guards and oversees them, ensuring all turn away from annihilation and toward existence.\n\nThus, the Sage’s Dao in the world, from ancient times to today, remains **one**.\n\nThough all turn away from annihilation and toward existence, the Dao is one.\n\n**Transformation is boundless**, yet all things return to their proper place.\nThough the Dao is one, its practice varies, hence **transformation is boundless**. Yet it remains orderly, hence **all things return to their proper place**.\n\nSometimes **Yin**, sometimes **Yang**; sometimes **soft**, sometimes **hard**; sometimes **open**, sometimes **closed**; sometimes **relaxed**, sometimes **tense**.\nThese two aspects—**law and symbol**—differ in form, and their teachings vary accordingly.\n\nThus, the Sage, though **one in guarding and overseeing the gates**, must **carefully examine what comes first or last**!\nThough governance may differ, in guarding and overseeing the gates, the Sage remains consistent. Therefore, one must carefully examine what should be prioritized and what should follow.\n\n**Measuring ability and assessing skill**, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.\n*Quán* refers to **strategic calculation**; *néng* refers to **inherent ability**; *zhàngqiǎo* refers to **artisan craftsmanship**.\n\nThe Sage, in employing people, measures their **strategic acumen and abilities**, assesses their **craftsmanship and skill**, and then assigns them accordingly.\n\nAmong the **virtuous and unvirtuous, the wise and foolish, the brave and cowardly, the benevolent and righteous**, there are differences. Thus, one may:\n- **Agitate** the virtuous to align them,\n- **Conceal** the unvirtuous to reveal their divergence,\n- **Advance** the wise and brave to honor them,\n- **Retreat** the foolish and cowardly to degrade them,\n- **Elevate** or **debase** them as needed,\nYet **do nothing** (*wuwei*) and **shepherd them with humility**.\n\nThe virtuous and foolish each fulfill their roles; ministers and officials exert their strengths. The only requirement is **humility and non-action** in guiding them.\n\n**Carefully determine presence and absence** to discern their **substance and emptiness**, and **follow their desires** to reveal their **intentions**.\nIn employing the worthy, one must first **carefully determine their substance and emptiness**, their **honesty and deceit**, then follow their desires to discern their **true intentions**.\n\n**Subtly challenge their words** and turn them back upon themselves to seek the truth, valuing **obtaining their alignment through agitation** to seek their advantage.\nWhen others speak, one must **subtly challenge and invert their words**, agitating them to reveal their true sentiments. Once the truth is obtained, one may **conceal and agitate them further**, prompting them to seek the **advantage of their own words**.\n\nSometimes **open and reveal**, sometimes **conceal and close**.\nOpening and revealing aligns their sentiments; concealing and closing reveals their sincerity.\nOpening aligns to **exhaust their sentiments**; concealing diverges to **test their sincerity**.\n\n**What is permissible and what is not**—carefully examine their strategies to **trace their alignment or divergence**.\nIn all speech, what is permissible and what is not must be **clearly examined**, their strategies scrutinized to **determine their true alignment or divergence**.\n\n**Unity and separation have their principles**; first, follow their intentions.\nThough strategies may vary in unity or separation, if one **holds fast to principle**, they may first follow their intentions to **fulfill them**, thereby knowing the **outcome of success or failure**.\n\nIf one seeks to **agitate**, **thoroughness is paramount**; if one seeks to **conceal**, **secrecy is paramount**.\nThe value of **thoroughness and secrecy** lies in their subtlety, aligning with the Dao.\n\nAgitation **probes their sentiments**; concealment **binds their sincerity**.\nProbing while **selecting and choosing**, binding while **tying and restraining**.\n\nEmotions may be true or false, hence the need for **selection and discernment**. Sincerity may lack constancy, hence the need for **binding and restraint**.\n\nAll this reveals the **weights and measures** of their **calculations**—thus the Sage **deliberates accordingly**. When the **weights and measures** are laid out, the **light and heavy** naturally distinguish themselves, and only then are **standards** established to **regulate their lightness and heaviness**. Once **light and heavy** find their proper place, **strategies and deliberations** are devised to **guide them along**.\n\nThose who do not conform to the **weights and measures** and **standards** are thus considered by the Sage to be **flawed**—their **lightness and heaviness** do not align with the **true measure**, their **length and shortfall** do not fulfill the **proper count**. Such are **worthless**; what use are they?\n\nThe Sage therefore **reconsiders and devises new strategies**, seeking their **opposite**. Thus, when **agitating**, one may either **cast forth** or **withdraw and store**; those who conform to the **weights and measures** are cast forth for use, while the unworthy are withdrawn and hidden.\n\nWhen **concealing**, one may either **retain** or **reject**. The sincere are retained, the insincere are rejected. **Agitation and concealment** are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Closing the door** is called **Kun (receptive)**, **opening the door** is called **Qian (creative)**—thus, they are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Agitation and concealment** shift **yin and yang**, the **opening and closing of the four seasons**, to **transform all things** in their **longitudinal and latitudinal** ways. The **yin field** shifts, the **four seasons** open and close—all this is the **Dao of agitation and concealment**.\n\n**Longitudinal and latitudinal** refer to **decay and renewal**. All things are either **opened to rise** or **concealed to decay**. **Reversal, inversion, and transformation** must arise from this.\n\nSpeaking of the **Dao of agitation and concealment**, it may **reverse** to emerge from one place, or **reverse** to return from another, or **reverse** to transform here while its **nature** manifests there—all this stems from **agitation and concealment**. Hence it is said: *\"This is how it arises.\"*\n\n**Agitation and concealment** are the **great transformations of the Dao**, the **variations of speech**—one must **forewarn and examine** their transformations. If there is no **opening and closing**, the **great Dao** would not transform. If there is no **variation in speech**, then **opening and closing** are what **transform the great Dao**. Though **speech and affairs** may be vast, they all **achieve completion through transformation**. Hence, **divination is prepared**.\n\n**Fortune and misfortune depend on this**. The **mouth** is the **gatekeeper of the heart**; the **heart** is the **master of the spirit**. The heart **expresses itself through the mouth**, hence the mouth is the **gatekeeper of the heart**. The spirit **serves the heart**, hence the heart is the **master of the spirit**.\n\n**Desires, intentions, joys, and appetites**, **thoughts, wisdom, and strategies**—all these **pass through the gate** in and out. These **eight aspects** all **traverse the mouth**, hence it is said they **enter and exit through the gate**.\n\nThus, **controlling agitation and concealment** regulates their **entry and exit**. **Agitation** is **opening, speaking, yang**; **concealment** is **closing, silence, yin**.\n\nIf these **eight aspects** lack **opening and closing**, affairs may become **unregulated**, hence **agitation and concealment** are used to **govern their entry and exit**. **Speaking outward** is **yang**; **concealing emotions inward** is **yin**. When **yin and yang** are harmonized, their **beginning and end** are complete.\n\n**Opening and closing** are **regulated**, hence **yin and yang** are harmonized. **Sequence and order** are appropriate, hence their **beginning and end** are complete.\n\nThus, **longevity, peace, wealth, honor, fame, affection, profit, satisfaction, joy, and desire** are called **yang**—**beginning**. These all **seek life**, hence they are called **beginning, yang**.\n\n**Death, sorrow, poverty, humiliation, loss, harm, punishment, and execution** are called **yin**—**end**. These all **seek death**, hence they are called **yin, end**.\n\nAll **speech that follows yang** is called **beginning**, meaning **goodness initiates affairs**. All **speech that follows yin** is called **end**, meaning **evil concludes strategies**.\n\nIt is said that **speech** may be **yin** or **yang**; the listener must **know this distinction**. The **Dao of agitation and concealment** is tested through **yin and yang**.\n\nWhether one **probes** or **conceals**, using **yin and yang speech** to test them reveals their **true intentions**. Thus, when speaking to those of **yang disposition**, one **elevates** them; when speaking to those of **yin disposition**, one **lowers** them.\n\nTo those of **yin disposition**, speak **lowly** to seek the **small**; to those of **yang disposition**, speak **highly** to seek the **great**. **Yin speech** is **low and small**, hence *\"seek the small with lowliness\"*; **yang speech** is **elevated**, hence *\"seek the great with height.\"*\n\nFrom this, **nothing is excluded**, **nothing is barred**, **nothing is impossible**. When **yin and yang** are exhausted, **small and great** are revealed—thus **entry and exit are all permissible**; what is there that cannot be?\n\nOne may **speak to individuals**, to **families**, to **nations**, to **the world**. There is **nothing impossible**, hence all that is spoken is **permissible**.\n\nTo act **small** is to have **no interior**; to act **great** is to have **no exterior**. Exhausting **yin** leaves **no interior**, exhausting **yang** leaves **no exterior**.\n\n**Gain and loss, departure and arrival, doubling and reversal**—all are governed by **yin and yang**. **Following the Dao** is called **gain**; **harming affairs** is called **loss**; **contradicting principle** is called **departure**; **aligning with intention** is called **arrival**; **departing utterly** is called **doubling**; **departing and returning** is called **reversal**.\n\nAll this does not exceed the **nature of yin and yang**, hence it is said: *\"All are governed by yin and yang.\"*\n\n**Yang moves and acts**; **yin stops and conceals**. **Yang moves outward**; **yin follows inward**. **Yang returns to its beginning and end**; **yin reaches its limit and reverses to yang**.\n\nThis speaks of **upper and lower** completing each other through **yin and yang generation**. **Yang moves** to **generate virtue**; **yin remains still** to **form substance**. **Seeking yin with yang** is **enveloping with virtue**; **binding yang with yin** is **applying force**.\n\nThis means the **noble nourishes the commoner with rank and rewards**, while the **commoner responds with strength and labor**. **Yin and yang seek each other** through **agitation and concealment**. The **upper and lower** can **seek each other** because **opening and closing** give rise to this.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang**, and it speaks of the laws governing humanity. Since one embodies the **Heaven and Earth** and mirrors **yin and yang**, its laws can thus be applied to humanity.\n\nAs the **first principle of all affairs**, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**. Heaven is round, Earth is square—this is the meaning of **upper and lower**. When the principles of **opening and closing** are fully realized, then all things are generated. Thus, it is the **first principle of all affairs**, and the **Dao/Way of upper and lower** emerges from here. Hence, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**.\n\n**Secondly, the Dao/Way of listening**: If even one aspect of what is spoken does not align, it must be countered with difficulty. When challenged, the speaker must reconsider and respond accordingly.\n\nThe **Great Transformation** of antiquity arose together with the **Formless**. The **Great Transformation** refers to the ancient sages transforming all things through the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Formless** is the **Dao/Way**. Since movement originates from the **Dao/Way**, it is said to arise together with the **Formless**.\n\nTo **look backward to understand the past**, to **invert to verify the present**; to **look backward to know antiquity**, to **invert to know the present**; to **look backward to know others**, to **invert to know oneself**. This means the **Great Transformation** of the sage examines all things and reflects upon himself. When undertaking affairs, he weighs them with utmost caution, repeatedly verifying and reflecting to **know what is to come** by first observing what has passed; to **know the present** by first examining antiquity; to **know others** by first measuring himself. Thus, he can **execute strategies without omission**, and his actions **always succeed**.\n\nThe principles of **movement and stillness, emptiness and substance** do not align with the present—then one seeks them in antiquity. **Movement and stillness** arise from **action and cessation**; **emptiness and substance** arise from **truth and falsity**. When their principles do not align with the present, one seeks them in antiquity.\n\nThere are affairs that, when inverted, reveal their **covering**—this is the intent of the sage. When an affair does not align, one inverts to seek its counterpart, and upon reversing, the **covering** is revealed. This is how **what is to come** is understood through seeking antiquity—this is the sage’s intent. **One must not fail to examine this.**\n\nIf one does not scrutinize, one will err in **subtlety**—thus, one must not fail to examine.\n\n**Speech is movement**; **silence is stillness**. Following their words, one listens to their **phrasing**. By observing **stillness** in **movement**, what is seen becomes clear. By examining **speech** through **phrasing**, what is gained becomes evident.\n\nWhen speech does not align, one inverts to seek it—its response will surely emerge. This means that if speech does not conform to principle, one must not immediately reject it. Instead, one counters it, compelling the speaker to seek truth, and the **response in accordance with principle** will naturally appear.\n\nSpeech has **symbols**; affairs have **analogies**. When there are **symbols and analogies**, one observes their **sequence**. Since the **response in accordance with principle** has emerged, speech thus has **symbols**, and affairs have **analogies**. Since past affairs had **symbols and analogies**, one must further observe their **sequence**, allowing them to fully manifest.\n\n**Symbols** refer to **legal models**; **analogies** refer to **proportional reasoning**. **Symbols** mirror the affair; **analogies** compare the phrasing.\n\nTo **seek the voiced from the formless**—principle lies in **profound subtlety**, hence it is **formless**. Without speech, it would not be made manifest, hence one seeks the **voiced from the formless**. **Voice** is speech; **analogies** refer to **comparative reasoning**. When the **baited words** align with the affair, one obtains the **truth of the person**.\n\nObtaining **fish** depends on the **bait**; obtaining **words** depends on the **opening statement**. When the **opening statement** is made, the **response** follows; when the **bait** is cast, the **fish** comes—hence, it is called **baiting with words**. When words align with affairs, it is called **aligning with affairs**. **Testing clearly** lies in **unfolding speech**, hence it is called **obtaining the truth of the person**.\n\nThis is like **setting snares to capture beasts**—one spreads the nets widely and oversees them. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the truth emerges on its own—this is the **net for capturing people**. When the net is set and overseen, the beasts are naturally ensnared. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the principle emerges on its own. Once the principle is manifest, the **sage and worthy** distinguish it.\n\nEven if one seeks to conceal themselves, the **Dao/Way** provides no escape—hence, it is called the **net for capturing people**. If one **constantly holds the net** to drive them toward their duties, those who **defy** will inevitably **speak without restraint**, and one must then **adapt the net**.\n\nTo **hold the net for capturing people** is to drive them toward their duties. If they **contradict**, they will **speak without restraint**. Thus, one must **change the net** and further **urge them with boldness**.\n\nTo **stir with symbols**, to **respond to their intent**, to **see their emotions**, and to **guide them accordingly**—this speaks of **adaptation**. **Respond** means to **align**. It means to further open **legal models** to stir them; once their intent is aligned, their emotions become visible, and one then **guides them** accordingly.\n\n**I reflect upon the past**; **they invert to come forward**. When speech has **symbols and analogies**, one establishes the **foundation** accordingly. When **I reflect upon the past** to seek them, and **they invert to come forward** to fulfill their duties, then **strategies emerge without end**. Thus, when speech has **symbols and analogies**, there is **no need to select words**. Thus, one can **establish the foundation of the state**.\n\nTo **layer, repeat, invert, and cover**—then no affair will lose its words. This means that once **symbols and analogies** are established, one then **layers, repeats, inverts, and covers** them—all referring to **repeatedly examining with meticulous care**, allowing no room for error. Thus, one can **fulfill all affairs perfectly**, with no loss of words.\n\nThe sage **leads the foolish and the wise**—all affairs remain **without doubt**. The sage **leads the foolish** by concealing them, thereby knowing their sincerity; **leads the wise** by provoking them, thereby exhausting their emotions, and all obtain their truth. Thus, all affairs remain **without doubt**.\n\nThe ancient masters of **inverted listening** transformed **ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions. This means that those skilled in **inverted listening** enter a state of **forgetting and abandoning perception**, not pondering yet **profoundly observing**, thus able to **transform ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions, penetrating the **profound and subtle** while remaining **mysterious**.\n\nThe **gathering of ghosts and spirits** is inherently **secretive**; now, it cannot be done—hence, it is called **transformation**. When **transformation** aligns with principle, then the **Dao/Way of guiding** becomes clear. If the **Dao/Way of guiding** is unclear, the **emotions obtained** will be indistinct; if the **emotions obtained** are indistinct, the **foundation established** will be unclear. **Clarity in emotions** depends on **clear guidance**; thus, if guidance is unclear, emotions remain indistinct. **Clarity in the foundation** depends on **clear emotions**; thus, if emotions are indistinct, the foundation is unclear.\n\nWhen **symbols and analogies** are transformed, there will surely be **inverted speech** to return and listen to.\n\n「When one speaks, **symbols and analogies** are transformed, and **inverted speech** arises to challenge them. One should let them speak first, then return to **stillness** to listen.\n\nTo hear their words, one must remain **silent**; to make them reveal themselves, one must **close one’s eyes** and feign indifference. To raise their voice, one must lower one’s own; to take from them, one must offer instead. This is the **Dao/Way of inverted listening**, by which one can **entice and draw forth** their true emotions.\n\nThus, when one desires to hear their voice, one must **return to stillness** and **silence**; when one desires them to speak openly, one must **close one’s eyes** and **compress one’s gaze**; when one desires them to be lofty, one must appear **humble**; when one desires them to withdraw, one must **give freely**. In this way, their **emotions** can be **drawn out**, and nothing will remain **hidden**.\n\nTo **open their emotions**, one must first **transform symbols and analogies** and **stir them** through **guiding speech**. When voices resonate in harmony, **true principle** converges. If one wishes to **open their emotions**, first **present symbols and analogies** to **move them**. Once their emotions are stirred, **guiding speech** must be **nurtured gradually**, allowing them to speak naturally—like cranes calling in the shade, their voices echoing in response.\n\nThus, **true principle** can be **drawn together**.\n\nSometimes this arises from one thing, sometimes from another; sometimes by **attending to the superior** (*shàng*), sometimes by **guiding the inferior** (*xià*). The **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is to know whether their words stem from this or that, or whether they are **attended to from above** or **guided from below**. This is how one **discerns truth from falsehood**, knows **harmony from discord**, and **detects their deceit**.\n\nFor **truth and falsehood**, **harmony and discord**, and **deceit**, one discerns them through **attending to the superior** (*shàng*). Their **actions, words, and silences** all emerge from **emotions**; their **joy or anger** reveals their **intentions**.\n\nAll this depends on **first establishing clarity within oneself**—this is the **method** for **guiding speech**. One must **invert and probe** to observe where their **emotions** are **lodged**, thus **testing their sincerity**.\n\nTo **know others**, one must first **see their emotions**; hence, this **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is employed. If one seeks **inner stillness**, one must listen to their words, examine their **affairs**, **discuss all things**, and **distinguish between strength and weakness**.\n\nThough their words may not be of immediate concern, one can **perceive the subtle** and **know the general** (*lèi*). When one **investigates others** and **dwells within their intentions**, one can **measure their capacity** and **shoot their intent**—like a snake’s mark never missing, or **Yì’s arrow** striking true.\n\nIf their **words and emotions align**, their **fortune or misfortune** will not stray—like **Yì’s arrow** finding its mark without fail. **Listening to speech** and **observing emotions** is no different; hence, they are compared thus.\n\nThus, the **beginning of knowing** lies in **self-knowledge** before knowing others. The one who **knows others** is **wise**; the one who **knows oneself** is **enlightened**. **Wisdom** arises from **enlightenment**, and **enlightenment** can **generate wisdom**. To **know others**, one must first **know oneself**.\n\nTheir **mutual understanding** is like **eyeless fish** (*bǐmù*)—each depends on the other. Their **manifestation** is like **light and shadow**—one cannot exist without the other. I can **know myself**; they must **rely on my knowing them**—both gain, and only then do the **Dao/Way of the sages** converge, hence like **eyeless fish**.\n\nWhen **sages** unite, **principle** naturally **shines forth**, like light giving rise to shadow. Their **words are never lost**—like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**. If one **discerns the sage** with **sagely wisdom**, what more is there to lose? Hence, like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**.\n\nTheir **interaction with others** is **subtle**; their **perception of emotions** is **swift**. The **Dao/Way of sages** in dealing with others is **refined and elusive**; yet in an instant, they **see emotions** with precision—like **yin** and **yáng**, or **yáng** and **yin**, like **roundness** and **squareness**, or **squareness** and **roundness**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*) is to **take their type** as one’s own **arms and legs**—to **compare them as parts of a single body**. This **principle** has been **long-standing**.\n\nThus, their **mutual fulfillment** is like **yin** and **yáng**. Their **mutual manifestation** is like **roundness** and **squareness**. Before their **form is seen**, one **guides them with the Dao/Way of roundness**; once their **form is manifest**, one **tasks them with the square method**.\n\nTheir **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, is governed by this. This is the **Dao/Way of employing others**—whether **promoting them**, **demoting them**, **assigning them to the left**, or **elevating them to the right**—all is determined by the **principle of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*).\n\nIf one does not **first establish clarity within oneself**, then **guiding others** will be **improper**. Their **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, if not **first established**, will not align with the **proper method** of **guiding others**.\n\nIf their **employment** is **unskillful**, it is called **forgetting emotions** and **losing the Dao/Way**. When **employment is unskillful**, one **operates from the superficial** (*mò*), **continues without pause** (*xù*), **uses round tools for square holes** (*záo*), and **square tools for round holes** (*bǐng*), thus **losing both emotions and the Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one **first establishes clarity** and **guides others** with **perfect virtue**, then one **drives without visible trace** (*míngxiàng*), **no one sees one’s approach** (*mén*), and it is called **heavenly and divine**.\n\nIf one can **first establish clarity**, then **guiding others** becomes **virtuous and boundless**—**mysterious winds** (*xuánfēng*) **blow far and wide**, neither **form nor trace** is seen, neither **door nor entrance** (*ménhù*) is apparent. One **sees their form** yet cannot **grasp it**; the **Dao/Way** is **ever-applied** yet **unknown**. Hence, it is called **heavenly and divine**.\n\n**Inner Harmony, the Third Chapter**\n\n**Binding** (*chà*) means **holding fast** so that it remains **secure**. One **secures** only after **obtaining**—then **roundness is joined** without separation.\n\nIn matters of **ruler and subject**, **superior and inferior**, if the **Dao/Way aligns**, they **draw near despite distance**; if it does not align, they **stay distant despite closeness**, and **reject what is not their intent**. If their **affairs are in accord**, they **depart yet return** in seeking **harmony**.\n\nThey **advance yet do not approach**; they **hear voices from afar** yet **ponder them in return**. When **separated**, they **advance yet do not approach**, and **hear voices** while **pondering in return**.»\n\n「All affairs possess **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*). Words may **draw near despite distance**, or **stay distant despite closeness**—hence, all affairs possess **inner harmony**. They are **bound** by **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao/Way** (*lǜ*), or by **factional ties and wealth**, or by **beauty and favor**. **Binding** from their very **beginning**.\n\nSome are **bound** by **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—when **Dao/Way** connects them to the **ruler and subject**, they are called **subjects** in name, but in reality, they are **masters**. When **Dao/Way** binds them through **friendship**, they are called **friends**—as seen in the case of **Guiguzi**’s disciples in *Ghost Valley Master’s Scrolls* (卷上). Those **bound** by **wealth** or **beauty**, like **Fei Zhong** and **E Lai** under **Jie** and **Jiu**, are of this kind.\n\nThey **utilize their own intentions**—if they wish to **enter**, they enter; if they wish to **exit**, they exit; if they wish to **draw near**, they draw near; if they wish to **stay distant**, they stay distant; if they wish to **approach**, they approach; if they wish to **depart**, they depart; if they wish to **seek**, they seek; if they wish to **ponder**, they ponder. The eight matters from **self-entering and self-exiting** downward are all in accordance with the **subject’s** intentions, following their own desires.\n\nThus, they can **steadfastly resolve their will** toward the **ruler**, and no external force can **intervene**. Like the **ant mother** (*yímǔ*) following its young—when it **exits**, there is no **trace**; when it **enters**, there is no **boundary**; it **goes alone and returns alone**, and none can **halt** it.\n\nThe **ant mother** (*yímǔ*), also called **locust mother** (*huánglà*), resembles a spider, dwelling in a **burrow** with a **cover**. It nurtures its young by covering the burrow’s entrance, and when it **exits and enters**, there is **no initial trace**—thus, nothing can **halt** it.\n\nNow, the **subjects** of **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*) **yield flexibly** to the **ruler**, **binding themselves securely** without **leaving any gaps**. This is also due to **inner harmony**.\n\nThe **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**, while the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**. When persuasive speech is **advanced**, they **bind themselves internally** to the **ruler**. Hence, it is said that the **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**.\n\nThey **weigh the situation** to **plan accordingly**—if the **ruler** does not **grasp** or **accept** their plans, they are **discarded**. Thus, it is said that the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**.\n\nThose who wish to **persuade** must **conceal their true intentions** and **weigh the situation**; those who **plan** must **follow what is convenient**. If they **persuade** while **concealing their intentions**, their words **will succeed**. If they **plan** while **following convenience**, their plans **will be adopted**. Through **subtle deliberation** of **feasibility** and **open discussion** of **advantages and losses**, they **guide the ruler’s will**.\n\nWhen **opportunities arise** and **timing is right**, they **align with the ruler’s plans**. *\"Opportunity\"* refers to the **Dao/Way unfolding**—when the **Dao/Way** **defends** and **advances**, their words **respond to the moment’s needs**, aligning with the **ruler’s** plans.\n\nThey **carefully consider** the **ruler’s** **binding** and **respond appropriately** to **timing**—when **planning** and **deliberating**, they **advance** to the **ruler**, securing their own position, and then **respond** to the **ruler’s** needs, ensuring their words **align with the ruler’s heart**.\n\nIf there is **internal discord**, it cannot be **implemented**. If their **plans** do not **align with the ruler’s**, they cannot be **executed**. Thus, they **probe the ruler’s current inclinations**, **adapt to what is convenient**, and **seek to change** their plans. When their **initial plans** prove unfit, they **reassess**, **adjust**, and **act according to the moment’s needs** to **alter their strategies**.\n\nTo **seek internal harmony** through **change**, they **employ the method of \"taking with the tube\"** (*guǎnqǔjiàn*). When they **take with the tube**, it **becomes distant**; when they **seek internal harmony** through **change**, it **becomes secure**. It is said that when **advancing**, they must **first use persuasive language**; when **responding**, they must **employ adaptable words**. If **past matters** are already **settled**, their words must **be persuasive**; if **future matters** have not yet **manifested**, their words must **be flexible**.\n\nThose skilled in **change** thoroughly **know the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, thus **grasping the Dao/Way of heaven** (*tiān*). Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **harmonize with the four seasons**, causing **ghosts and spirits** to **align with yin and yang**.\n\nThose skilled in **change** refer to those who **master the principles** of **adaptable strategies**. Thoroughly **knowing the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, they can **grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Hence, it is said that they **thus grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **follow the natural order** of the **four seasons**. Hence, it is said that they **harmonize with the four seasons**.\n\n**Ghosts and spirits** are those that **assist yin and yang** in **nurturing life**. When the **Dao/Way** **unifies heaven and earth**, they can **cause ghosts and spirits** to **align in virtue** with **yin and yang**.\n\nThus, they can **nurture the people**. When they **observe the ruler’s** **plans and affairs**, they **know their intentions**.\n\nTheir **nurturing of the people** lies in **observing their plans and affairs** to **know their intentions**. If there are **plans that do not align**, it is because they are **unfamiliar**.\n\nWhen they **align yet do not bind**, it is **yang** (*yang*) **drawing near externally** while **yin** (*yīn*) **stays distant internally**. There may be **separation and reunion** without **secure binding**—when **yang** (*yang*) **externally draws near**, while **yin** (*yīn*) **internally stays distant**.\n\nIf there are **plans that do not align**, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** them. *\"Not align\"* refers to **round holes for square pegs**; hence, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** such plans.\n\nThus, those who **draw near despite distance** possess **hidden virtue**; those who **stay distant despite closeness** lack **harmony of intent**. *\"Hidden virtue\"* refers to **private bonds** of **yin** (*yīn*).\n\nThose who **approach yet are rejected** have **unfavorable strategies**; those who **depart yet return seeking** have **opportunities arising mid-affair**. It is said that when **words** do not **align with the moment**, and **affairs** are **settled only after realization**, it is because **opportunities arose mid-affair**.\n\nThose who **advance yet do not approach** have **improper implementation**; those who **hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return** are **aligned with their plans** and **await decisive action**. It is said that when their **actions** **align with their own plans**, they **wait to execute them in sequence**, hence *\"hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return\"*.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"If one does not see their kind yet acts accordingly, they will meet with opposition; if one does not grasp their true intent yet persuades them, they will be met with disapproval.\"*\n\nIt is said that if one does not **grasp their true intent and kind**, yet **persuades them**, it is like **driving northward while facing south** or **Chen Xiao** traveling to **Qin**—thus, they will **meet with disapproval and opposition**.\n\nIf they **grasp their true intent**, they can **control their movements**—when they **encounter favorable winds**, like **swans** (*hóng*) or **fish** (*yú*) in **vast waters**, they **flow freely**, and none can **halt** them. Thus, they can **direct their actions** at will.\n\nThis **method** allows for **free entry and exit**, **secure binding or opening**. This **method** refers to **grasp of their true intent**—then **entry and exit** are **unrestricted**, and **binding or opening** are **as they wish**.\n\nThe Sage establishes affairs by first knowing through this grasp of intent and thus controlling all things. It is said that by grasping intent to establish affairs, one can foresee what is favorable or not. All things, whether bound or unchanging, are thus rooted in grasping intent.\n\nFrom the Way and virtue, to ren and righteousness, to rites and music, to strategies and schemes—all stem from grasping intent, enabling the practice of ren, righteousness, and virtue in all undertakings.\n\nFirst, one examines the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, blending and adjusting interpretations, deliberating what to retain or discard. *Hun* means \"to harmonize.\" This refers to first considering the words of the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, aligning them with one’s own reasoning, then adjusting and refining current affairs, debating what to accept or reject.\n\nTo unite, one employs the inner; to discard, the outer. *Inner* refers to intent within; *outer* refers to intent without. When intent is grasped, unity follows naturally; when intent is lost, separation ensues—this is the constant principle.\n\nTo discern inner and outer, one must master the Dao and its patterns, anticipating events through strategy, resolving doubts with precision. It is said that those skilled in inner and outer understanding perceive the unfolding of the Dao’s patterns, foresee events, and resolve doubts in sequence.\n\nWith no miscalculations in strategy, one establishes merit and builds virtue. Having mastered the Dao’s unfolding, one’s strategies are without error. Without error in strategy, one can then establish merit and build virtue.\n\nTo govern the people and manage resources, one must *control and harmonize inwardly*. To order the names of lord and subject, ensuring hierarchy is clear. To regulate taxes and labor, ensuring no disparity between near and far. When hierarchy is clear, duties are distinct. When disparity is absent, burdens are light. Thus, this becomes the foundation of a state. Hence, it is said: *control and harmonize inwardly*.\n\nWhen the ruler is blind and ungoverned, the people are chaotic and unaware, one must *control and reverse* the situation. When the ruler neglects his duties and the people are unaware of their unrest, the world becomes a land without states, a realm without masters, and those in darkness may act as they please, while those who scorn you will rise. Hence, it is said: *control and reverse*.\n\nWhen inner alignment is achieved and nothing is left externally, one may persuade and elevate. It is said that a virtuous ruler, confident in his actions, does not retain the praise of others. Such a one creates reputation and spreads it abroad, testing others’ intentions.\n\nIf one is summoned, one welcomes and responds. When the ruler’s heart is virtuous, if a summons comes, one greets and obeys it to fulfill one’s purpose. If one wishes to depart, one does so through calculated risk. Like birds that take flight before settling, one departs by offering perilous terms.\n\nThrough cyclical transformation and adaptation, no action is forced—this is the way of great propriety. At the juncture of departure or arrival, one weighs what is fitting, turning like a wheel, adapting to change. Though others may not perceive the intent, such retreat is the ultimate in preserving oneself and upholding propriety. *Propriety* is *law*.\n\n**Chapter Four: Looming Collapse (Dǐ Zhí)**\n*Dǐ* means to strike firmly; *zhí* refers to cracks and fissures. When walls collapse due to fissures, or structures fail due to hidden flaws, one must strike firmly to reinforce them. Thus, walls and structures will not fail. If ruin is inevitable, one removes it and rebuilds, placing people and affairs accordingly.\n\nThings have their natural order; affairs have their unions and separations. This speaks of unions and separations as natural principles. Some things are near yet unseen, others far yet known. What is near yet unseen is due to not examining their words; what is far yet known comes from reflecting past events to judge the present.\n\nBy examining words and observing actions, one can perceive near intent. By reflecting past events to judge the present, one can foresee distant affairs. The past is like the present. Thus, by reviewing the past, one can verify the future. Hence, it is said: *reflect the past to judge the present*.\n\n*Tie* is the altar; the altar is *xián*; *xián* is the beginning of great fissures. When fissures grow vast, collapse is imminent, so one must strike firmly to reinforce.\n\nAt the outset, cracks may be *loomed* (mapped) and sealed, struck to repel, struck to suppress, struck to conceal, or struck to resolve. This is the principle of *looming collapse*.\n\n*Ying* refers to the emergence of fissures—its subtle beginnings. What arises internally can be sealed by striking; what comes externally can be repelled; what rises from below can be suppressed; what is nascent can be concealed; what is beyond remedy can be accepted. Deep understanding of these five aspects reveals the true logic of *looming collapse*.\n\nWhen danger looms, the Sage perceives it, safeguarding their methods, adapting to transform affairs, mastering strategies and schemes to discern the subtle. The Sage operates beyond form—thus, when danger first appears, they are already aware, both clear and wise. Hence, they safeguard their methods.\n\nBy adapting to transform affairs, they respond to circumstances, mastering strategies and schemes to weave and measure, discerning the subtle to preemptively guard against it. From the finest hair’s breadth, they act to sway the roots of great mountains.\n\nThe Han Emperor Gaozu rose from humble origins to the imperial throne; Tang of the Shang ruled from a hundred li to govern all under heaven. *Jīng* is the beginning; *huī* is movement.\n\nWhen the signs of external turmoil first emerge—conspiracies lurking like sprouting weeds—all such schemes arise from *dǐzhì* (抵帜), the strategic response to fissures in the Dao, serving as its defense. *[#21]*\n\nWhen governance falters and external signs of chaos sprout—when rebellious plots begin to take root—sage counsel is invoked to devise strategy. *[#22]* This is because the art of *dǐzhì* lies in seizing these moments. Thus, when the fissures appear, the Way’s defense may be enacted. Hence it is said: *\"To block the gap of the banner is to unfold the Way.\"*\n\nWhen the realm fractures, with no enlightened ruler above and nobles lacking virtue, then schemers and traitors rise, the worthy are sidelined, the Sage exiled, and deceitful opportunists flourish. Rulers and ministers mislead one another, leading to collapse and mutual destruction—father and son turn against each other, estranged and hostile. This is called the *sprouting of rebellious seeds* (萌牙). Such is the *banner of chaos* (帜坛) for the state. *[伐射]* means to provoke conflict and strike one another.\n\nWhen the Sage perceives the sprouting of rebellious seeds, they respond with law. If the age can be governed, they block it to seal it off; if not, they block it to seize it. Sometimes they block thus, sometimes they block otherwise—sometimes they counter it, sometimes they overturn it. To block thus is to seal it; to block otherwise is to seize it. To counter it is to aid its logic; to overturn it is to take the land by force.\n\nThe governance of the Five Emperors was sealed by blocking; the deeds of the Three Kings were seized by blocking. The Five Emperors’ rule could still be rectified in their time, hence *\"blocking to seal it\"*—thus the practice of abdication in favor of the worthy. The Three Kings’ era was beyond rectification, hence *\"blocking to seize it\"*—thus the wars of conquest.\n\nWhen feudal lords clash, no single victory can be counted upon—at such times, the ability to block determines supremacy. *[This refers to the Age of the Five Hegemons, where dominance came from above.]*\n\nFrom the union and separation of Heaven and Earth’s cyclical rise and fall, there must always be fissures in the banner—these cannot be ignored. *[合离]* refers to *Yin-Yang negation and affirmation*; the Dao’s true observation reveals that even Heaven and Earth have moments of negation and affirmation, creating these fissures—how much more so for humanity! Thus, it is said: *\"These cannot be ignored.\"*\n\nTo discern them through *yáohé* (掉阖)—to wield this Way—is the mark of the Sage. *[牌阖]* is also negation and affirmation. Those who embody the Great Dao to govern human affairs are the Sage. The Sage is Heaven and Earth’s envoy, following humanity to serve the cosmic order—hence *\"Heaven and Earth’s envoy.\"*\n\nIf no opportunity arises for blocking, they remain hidden, awaiting the moment. When the moment comes, they act. If it can be aligned with the above, if it can be restrained below—*aligning with the above* means blocking to seal, aiding the age’s governance; *restraining below* means blocking to seize, forcing submission to oneself. *[#23]*\n\nTo act in accordance and follow the Way is to guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth. *[#24]* Those who follow this Way may occupy the supreme position—thus, they guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*(End of Ghost Valley Classic, Volume One)*\n\n**\"Fei\" (Flying)** refers to raising one’s reputation to exalt and elevate it. **\"Jian\" (Clamping)** refers to restraining and binding so that they cannot escape.\n\nThe method of taking a person begins by raising their reputation to exalt them, and they will inevitably reveal their true intentions and exhaust their resolve without concealment. Only then can one, through their preferences, restrain and bind them so they cannot shift or turn.\n\nIn assessing talent and ability, the purpose is to summon those from afar and bring those nearby. By gauging their strategies and measuring their capacities—whether distant or near—one determines their potential. Raising their reputation is how one summons those from afar and brings those nearby.\n\nFor instance, when the virtuous are either distant or near, one employs this method to attract them, as in the case of King Zhao of Yan honoring Guo Ju, a matter of historical record.\n\nTo establish influence and control affairs, one must first discern distinctions and similarities, separating the threads of right and wrong. Once those from afar and near have arrived, one then establishes the authority of rewards and punishments, regulating the success or failure of their actions.\n\nWith the situation thus set, one must first examine the alliances and divisions—whether they align or oppose—and distinguish the truth or falsehood in their words. Observing their inner and outer expressions, one knows the presence or absence of their true capabilities. The outer refers to superficial appearances, the inner to genuine substance; presence or absence refers to the Dao’s unfolding of their abilities or failures.\n\nAgain, by observing their true or deceptive words, one discerns whether their capabilities are genuine or feigned. One then resolves matters of safety and peril, determining relationships of closeness and distance.\n\nHaving discerned distinctions, separated right from wrong, observed inner and outer expressions, and known presence or absence, one can then arrange matters of safety and peril, and settle affairs of closeness and distance—thus distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy.\n\nOnly then does one weigh and measure them. If they harbor hidden intentions, one can then summon, seek, and employ them. Weighing determines their lightness or heaviness; measuring determines their length or shortcoming. Once their lightness or heaviness is revealed, and their length or shortcoming takes form, one applies hidden strategies to aid their alignment or deviation.\n\nThus, whether summoning, seeking, or employing them becomes possible.\n\nUsing the words of **hook-and-clamp**, one flies and clamps them. **\"Hook\"** refers to luring and revealing their true nature. The talents and dispositions of people vary in rank, so the words of hook-and-clamp also have gradations.\n\nThus, when employing hook-and-clamp words, if one confuses them internally to reveal their true nature, it is called **hook**; if one praises them externally to reveal their true nature, it is called **fly**. Once their true nature is obtained, one clamps and restrains them so they cannot escape or shift—hence, **hook-and-clamp**, hence **flying hook-and-clamp**.\n\nThe language of hook-and-clamp is flexible, sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging. That is, when employing hook-and-clamp words, one may either feign agreement to unite them or feign opposition to separate them—hence, **sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging**.\n\nIf they cannot be swayed by this, one may first summon them and then impose burdens. **\"Cannot be swayed\"** means the hook-and-clamp words fail to move them. Thus, one first issues commands to summon them. **\"Imposing burdens\"** refers to, once they arrive, revealing their true capacities.\n\nOnce they arrive, one then fully reveals their true abilities and defenses, knowing what they can do—some may thus follow and transform. Or, one may first impose burdens and then disparage them. Some, even after revealing their true abilities, still do not follow and transform, so one then exposes their shortcomings to disparage them—those who err may thus follow, indicating they did not understand transformation.\n\nOr, one may use imposing burdens as disparagement, or disparagement as imposing burdens. Some reveal their true abilities, yet their shortcomings become evident—this is using burdens as disparagement. Others, after detailing their shortcomings, are shamed into compliance—this is using disparagement as burdens.\n\nBecause they are difficult to move, one may either impose burdens or disparage them, driving and luring them into transformation.\n\nIn employing them, one may use wealth, treasures, jade, pearls, white jade, or adornments to serve them. **\"Employing them\"** means, once they have followed and transformed, one must first know their nature, habits, likes, and dislikes, then move them with wealth or adornments to test their loyalty.\n\nOr, one may measure their abilities and establish influence to hook them—gauging their strengths and weaknesses, then setting the conditions of approach or withdrawal to hook their true nature and discern their intelligence and strategy.\n\nOr, one may observe their actions, see their proficiency, and clamp them—meaning one watches their conduct, sees their skill, and restrains them to know their courage or cowardice.\n\nIn applying this method, one uses **blocking and signaling**—meaning these above methods are extensions of blocking and signaling.\n\nWhen intending to employ them in the world, one must measure their abilities, observe the flourishing or decline of the times, assess the breadth or narrowness of the land, the difficulty or ease of the terrain, the abundance or scarcity of the people and resources, and the alliances of the feudal lords—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated.\n\n**\"Employing them in the world\"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to assist the emperor. Measuring abilities determines whether the emperor’s capacities can be aided to completion. Observing the times’ flourishing or decline, the land’s breadth or narrowness, and the people’s abundance or scarcity further determines whether the harmony of Heaven, Earth, and humanity aligns with the age’s prosperity or adversity. Examining the feudal lords’ alliances—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated—further determines whether they will follow or oppose.\n\nHaving carefully considered their intentions and inclinations, one knows their likes and dislikes, then speaks to what they value most, using flying-and-clamping words to hook their desires and clamp them in pursuit.\n\nHaving carefully examined their intentions and inclinations, knowing their likes and dislikes, one then addresses what they hold most dear. Again, using flying-and-clamping words, one hooks their desires. Having known their desires, one clamps and seeks them. If their desires are not defied, what persuasion would they refuse?\n\nWhen employing this on people, one measures their intelligence and abilities, weighs their talents and strength, gauges their qi and influence, and sets the pivotal mechanisms to welcome, follow, clamp, and harmonize them according to intent. This is the **continuation of flying and clamping**.\n\n**\"Employing this on people\"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to the feudal lords. Measuring intelligence and abilities, gauging qi and influence also seeks to know their strategic capabilities.\n\n**\"Pivot\"** is what governs the movement of doors; **\"mechanism\"** is what governs the release of crossbows.\n\n「Once one has discerned the strategic capabilities—both strengths and weaknesses—of the feudal lords, laws are then established to regulate their movements, as the pivot governs the door’s opening and closing, and the mechanism governs the firing of the crossbow. Sometimes one leads them by welcoming, sometimes follows by yielding, always restraining their emotions to harmonize them and guiding their intentions to suit one’s own purpose. Thus, the feudal lords’ loyalty can be secured, and the ruler’s favor can be firmly maintained.\n\nThis is called the **continuation of flying and clamping**—applying the extensions of flying and clamping to people. When used on people, it means sending out empty words while receiving sincere responses, binding them without losing them, and probing their speech to discern their true intent. They may comply with clamping, they may resist it, they may be drawn in or repelled, they may be guided east or west, south or north, or even turned back or overturned. Yet when used on people, it refers to deploying the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to manipulate them. Only by spreading one’s reputation does this work—hence, \"sending out empty words.\" They, in turn, open their hearts and reveal their true emotions, submitting to you—hence, \"receiving sincere responses.\" Once their emotions are secured, they are bound by the **continuation of flying and clamping** and not abandoned. Further, by spreading their words and observing their speech, one can make them follow, resist, or be bound in any direction. Their reversal or overthrow lies solely in your clamping and guiding, for there is no thought that cannot be subdued. Though they may overturn, they can be restored, never losing their proper measure. Though they may falter or fail, the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** can recover and reassert them, never losing its rhythm and control—this is the **ultimate application of clamping**.\n\n**The Sixth Principle: Unity in Opposition**\nThe Dao/Way being hidden, the proper path cannot proceed openly, so when one seeks to unite, one must first oppose. This ensures they have no doubt, allowing one to then carry out their intentions—just as the departure of Yi Yin and Lü Shang was the prelude to their unity.\n\nIn all cases of seeking unity through opposition, there must be a fitting strategy.\nWhen one seeks unity through opposition, even if the responses are uneven, the application of strategy will make them align. Through transformation and adaptation, they follow suit, each with their own form and momentum, their reversals and overthrows interdependent, and measures established according to circumstances.\nThe principle of opposition is self-referential: it shifts with the transformation, like links in a chain. Yet their departures and arrivals each have their own patterns—some reverse, some overturn. The principle itself seeks alignment, and no matter the circumstances, measures are established accordingly.\n\nThus, the sage, positioned between heaven and earth, establishes their standing to govern the world, spreading teachings and proclaiming their name, always adapting to the confluence of circumstances and observing the suitability of the times. They consider what should be expanded or reduced, using this to foreknow and align with transformations. What should be expanded or reduced refers to the proper application of governance and teaching. Once knowing what must be expanded or reduced, one acts accordingly. Hence, \"foreknow\"—using the principle of opposition to understand.\n\n**Transformation and Adaptation** refers to shifting and conforming to the changes of others.\nThe world has no fixed nobility, nor do matters have a fixed master.\nRen (benevolence) makes one noble, hence no fixed nobility.\nEstablishing virtue makes one a master, hence no fixed master.\nThe sage is always acting without fixed action, always listening without fixed listening—\nBy using the **continuation of flying and clamping**, they act without restraint.\nThey do not listen to baseless words, hence no fixed listening.\n\nWhen matters are completed and strategies align, the sage takes the lead in guiding them.\nIn matters, they are already accomplished; in strategy, they are already harmonized.\nThus, they are established with the multitude as their leader.\nWhen aligned with one and separated from another, loyalty cannot serve two masters.\nWhen aligned with one but separated from another, their loyalty cannot be fully applied to both.\nThere must be **opposition through reversal**—\nReversing to this, nature to that, and then reversing again to that.\nIts method is this:\nSince loyalty cannot be fully applied to both, it is proper to employ the **stratagem of reversal and fear** to manipulate them.\n\n**Reversal and Opposition** means reversing to unite with this, then acting to oppose that.\nTo act through reversal means to create doubt in their affairs, so that the confused cannot perceive the truth.\n\nWhen deploying this across the world, one must measure the world and align with it;\nWhen deploying this within a state, one must measure the state and align with it;\nWhen deploying this within a family, one must measure the family and align with it;\nWhen deploying this in personal conduct, one must measure one’s own abilities, strength, and influence, and align with them.\nGreat or small, advance or retreat—its use remains consistent.\nWhen deploying this, it refers to the extension of opposition.\nTo measure means to assess the presence or absence of their circumstances.\nTo align means to cultivate their favor.\nBefore executing the **stratagem of reversal**, one must first affirm their circumstances and curry their favor, then the hidden ruler will have no way to perceive or awaken, thus allowing the deployment of the **stratagem of reversal** to succeed.\n\nThough the extensions of its application may vary in scale—great or small, advance or retreat—yet when one properly affirms their circumstances and cultivates their favor, it remains consistent in use, hence \"its use remains consistent.\"\n\nOne must first deliberate on strategy and define plans before executing them with the **flying-and-clamping stratagem**. When deploying the **extension of reversal and fear**, one must first establish the strategy and plans, then execute them, again using the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to reinforce and fill the gaps.\n\nThe ancients who mastered the art of opposition and reversal\nUnified the Four Seas, encompassed the feudal lords’ loyalty, and transformed the land of unity—then sought to align.\nThose who deeply understood the principle of opposition and reversal\nUnified all under heaven, united the feudal lords, and drove them to the land of unity—then employed methods to transform and shift them.\nOnce their hearts were aligned, they sought their true ruler and united with them.\nHence, Yi Yin five times approached Tang, five times approached Jie, before uniting with Tang;\nLü Shang three times approached King Wen, three times entered Yin, yet could not clarify his purpose—before uniting with King Wen.\nYi Yin approached Jie and Zhou because their nature demanded no doubt, and since they had no doubt, he could then unite with their true ruler.\nThis is the **clamping of heavenly command**, hence their submission without doubt.\nHeavenly command was tied to Yin, Tang, and King Wen, so the two ministers submitted to the two rulers without doubt.\nWithout the utmost sage reaching the depths of the Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world;\nWithout laboring over the mind and exhausting thought, one cannot fathom matters;\nWithout fully attending to emotions and discerning truth, one cannot establish reputation;\nWithout refined talent and virtue, one cannot wield armies;\nWithout genuine sincerity, one cannot know people.»\n\n「Thus, the **Way of harmonizing nature**, one must first assess one’s own talents and abilities, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one’s **sagely discernment** and **long-term vision**—whether near or distant, who is superior and who is inferior.\n\nThe **Way of harmonizing** cannot be applied to those who surpass oneself, but rather to those who do not. Hence, one must know who is inferior before acting. Only then can one advance, retreat, expand, or contract. Once the **Way of harmonizing** is applied to those inferior to oneself, then advancement, retreat, expansion, and contraction are solely as one desires.\n\n**Chapter Seven: *Assessing Power and Discerning Emotions***\nThe ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.\n\nWhat is meant by measuring **power**? It is to gauge the scale of greatness and smallness, to strategize based on the multitude or scarcity of forces, and to evaluate the presence or absence of wealth and resources. The ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.\n\nMeasuring **power** means:\n- Gauging the scale of greatness and smallness,\n- Strategizing based on the multitude or scarcity of forces,\n- Evaluating the presence or absence of wealth and resources,\n- Calculating the abundance or scarcity of the populace,\n- Assessing whether there is surplus or deficit, and by how much,\n- Determining the advantages and disadvantages of terrain—whether it is perilous or easy,\n- Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of strategic planning,\n- Distinguishing the merit or demerit of ministers—whether they are virtuous or unworthy,\n- Judging the wisdom or lack thereof among guests and allies,\n- Observing the auspicious or inauspicious signs of Heaven’s timing,\n- Deciding which feudal lords to engage and which to disregard,\n- Measuring the stability or danger of the people’s hearts—whether they incline toward or away from you,\n- And whether they love or hate you.\n\nThrough careful observation, one can discern what is convenient. Thus, one can know their emotions. If one does this, their emotions can be understood, and no matter the situation, one can act accordingly.\n\n**Discerning emotions** requires approaching them when their desires are most pronounced to fully explore their cravings. When they have cravings, even a **wooden** figure cannot conceal their emotions. One must then approach them when their fears are most intense to fully explore their aversions. When they have aversions, they cannot conceal their emotions. Emotions and desires will inevitably reveal their changes.\n\nIf one is moved by their emotions yet does not perceive these changes, then one should avoid speaking to them and instead question those close to them, to know where their comfort lies. Even if one approaches them during moments of joy or fear to probe their desires and aversions, one may still not know their changes. Thus, one should avoid speaking to them and gradually question those close to them, and their true desires and comforts can then be known.\n\nEmotions that change within are reflected in outward appearance. Therefore, one must always use what is visible to infer what is hidden—this is called **probing and discerning emotions**. Emotions and outward expressions never diverge; internal changes are always mirrored in external appearance. Thus, one must always use outward appearance to infer internal emotions.\n\nThose who observe facial expressions to discern emotions are indeed employing this **Way**. This is called **probing the depths and discerning emotions**.\n\nTherefore, when calculating state affairs, one must carefully assess **power**. When advising a ruler, one must carefully discern emotions. Strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires must emerge from this. If one carefully assesses **power**, then state affairs can be calculated; if one carefully discerns emotions, then one can advise the ruler.\n\nAs for strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires, all must be discerned before action is taken. Hence, it is said that strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires also emerge from this.\n\nThen one can determine what is precious or worthless, what is weighty or light, what is advantageous or harmful, what can succeed or fail—all depend on this. If one is precise in **discerning and probing**, then preciousness, worthlessness, success, and failure are all determined by oneself, with nothing outside of **discerning and probing**. Hence, it is said that all depends on this.\n\nThus, even with the **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, without **discerning emotions**, one cannot uncover the hidden and concealed. This is the fundamental principle of strategy and the method of persuasion. The **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, though vast and profound, mysterious and wondrous, if not combined with the **probing of emotions**, then how can one seek their hidden and concealed aspects?\n\nTherefore, **discerning emotions** is the root of successful strategy and the foundation of persuasion.\n\nThere are always matters concerning people, yet people cannot anticipate these matters before they arise—this is the most difficult to achieve. Those who wield the **probing of emotions** also possess the insight of **unique perception**, hence they can anticipate matters concerning people before anyone else.\n\nThey can also exhaust all possibilities and perceive all changes, thus anticipating matters before they arise. Without embodying the profound and mastering the mysterious, none can achieve this. Hence, it is said that this is the most difficult to achieve.\n\nTherefore, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern, meaning one must always time their strategic planning. Human emotions are more treacherous than mountains and rivers, and more difficult to fathom than Heaven’s workings. Now, if one wishes to **discern and govern** them, is it not difficult?\n\nHence, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern. Strategic planning arises from human emotions; one must know their timing and rhythms. This is why it is the most difficult.\n\nTherefore, even the slightest movement of a silkworm—just a tiny insect—contains the potential for advantage or harm, and can give rise to matters. The beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities. The silkworm’s slight movements are but a humble creature, yet they still carry the seeds of advantage or harm. Thus, if one follows them, they bring joy; if one opposes them, they provoke anger. How much more so with humans, how much more so with ghosts and spirits?\n\nTherefore, advantage and harm are inevitable in affairs, and following or opposing them is the natural course of events. Hence, to invite advantage and avoid harm is the constant principle. Observing this can lead to the beauty of **generating affairs**.\n\n**Generating affairs** lies in carefully assessing subtle opportunities—hence, it is said that the beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities.»\n\n「This is the art of **divining emotions** and **adapting speech**, crafting discourse only after assessing the situation.\n\nOnce the emotions are divined, speech is then refined and followed accordingly—thus, it is said that **adapting speech** must first be shaped into discourse before it can be applied. In the eighth chapter of *The Art of War*, **\"Divining\"** is the **oath**#13 of the inner strategy. **\"Divining\"** refers to the one who assesses the emotions and then aligns with their desires.\n\nHence, **\"Divining\"** is the extension of **assessing**. The inner **oath** means that emotions and desires stir within, while their manifestations appear externally. **\"Divining\"** is the act of perceiving these external signs and inferring the inner emotions. Therefore, it is said: **\"Oaths\"** are the foundation of **divining**.\n\nWhen employing **divining**, there must be a **Way**. That **Way** must remain concealed.\n**Divining** is the means to gauge their emotional inclinations;\n**Adapting** is the means to stimulate and align with their inner **oaths**.\nTo use **divining and adapting**, one must first establish the principle.\nThus, it is said: *\"When employing it, there must be a **Way**.\"*\n\nThen, to measure emotions by emotions, emotions being inherently subtle and concealed, it is said: *\"That **Way** must remain hidden.\"*\n\nBy **adapting subtly**, one tests and probes their desires, and the inner **oaths** will surely respond. When they respond, they will inevitably act as desired.\nOnce the emotions are divined and their inclinations known, one then **adapts subtly** to their desires, and when their desires are met, emotions will surely stir.\nTesting and probing them, thus the inner **oaths** will respond.\n\nSo, when the **oaths** respond, one must withdraw subtly to fulfill their intended actions.\nThis is called **blocking fate and concealing intent**, hiding one’s true appearance and evading emotions so that others remain unaware—thus, one’s plans succeed without misfortune.\n\nThe ruler, having already determined the actions, can then **adapt** to fulfill them.\nThe minister’s affairs are best when left **unseen**, for completion brings an end—thus, one withdraws subtly.\nIf one does not align with this strategy, the credit for success will go to the ruler.\nThis is akin to **blocking fate and concealing intent**, **hiding appearance and evading emotions**.\n\nWhen emotions are concealed and intent is blocked, how can others know?\nIf others do not know the means by which one **restrains** their borrowed ruin, then one’s affairs can be completed without **restraint**.\n\n**\"Divining\"** lies here, **\"oaths\"** lie there—aligning and responding to them, there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.\nThis **adapting** is so subtle, yet its effects are naturally evident.\nThe observer sees only the results and not the subtlety itself.\nThus, when employing this method, success is assured—there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.\n\nThe ancient masters of **adapting** were like those who cast a hook into the depths—baiting it and hiding the line, they were sure to catch the fish.\nHence, it is said: *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing, conquers battles without others fearing.\"*\n\nThe fisherman reveals the bait but conceals the hook—thus, the fish does not see the bait, yet the hook is obtained.\nThe **virtuous** observe the results of their actions but conceal their **adapting**—thus, others do not know, yet they are naturally swayed.\nTherefore, it is said: *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing.\"*\n\nVictory in battle stems from **adapting** well—when **adapting** is concealed, there is no source from which to fear, hence it is said: *\"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing.\"*\n\nThe **Sage** plans in secrecy, hence it is called **mysterious** (*shen*);\nThey accomplish it openly, hence it is called **illuminated** (*ming*).\n**Mysterious** planning is concealed and hidden, daily actions unknown—like the **Dao/Way**’s inscrutable path, hence it is called **mysterious**.\nWhen affairs are completed and plans fulfilled, their brilliance shines clearly—hence it is called **illuminated**.\n\nSo, the saying *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing\"* means they do not see the means of advantage, yet they recognize the **Way**;\n*\"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing\"* means they trust the **Way** and are unaware of the reasoning behind it—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated** (*shenming*).\n\nThe **Sage** embodies the **Dao/Way** and establishes teachings, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth to effect transformations. They **conceal** their brilliance and **hide** their paths, **reserving** their actions while **displaying** their **virtue**.\nThus, people cannot comprehend their **borrowed ruin** (*shen*), yet they follow the **Dao/Way** without knowing its reasoning—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated**.\n\nConstantly waging war through **non-contention** (*buzheng*), they **restrain** disaster within their own hearts and minds, using **non-contention** as their method of war.\nNo armies are raised—**virtue** flows naturally, and the people are all unaware of the reasoning behind their **fearlessness**.\nOne **adapts** with their anger;\nOne **adapts** with their balance, one **adapts** with their rectitude—」\n\n「One **adapts** with their joy,\nOne **adapts** with their reputation, one **adapts** with their deeds;\nOne **adapts** with their integrity, one **adapts** with their **virtue**;\nOne **adapts** with their profit, one **adapts** with their humility.\n\nThese ten aspects of **non-contention** (*buzheng*) are all ways to **stir** (*mó*) the people’s **varying** (*cānchā*) **nature** (*xìng*), their **breathing** (*qì*) of **fullness** and **emptiness**.\nThose who **adapt** with their anger accumulate **virtue** and **power** (*shàn*), restraining evil before it sprouts—\nThus, the **Dao/Way’s** subtle winds spread far and wide,\nAnd the people remain **unaware** of why they submit—\nThey liken it to **mysterious and illuminated**.\n\nMatters shift and change.\nThus, those who **stir** (*mó*) must also **adapt** to the **factors** (*qǐ*) that move them.\n\nThe **still** (*jìng*) is **non-contention** (*buzheng*);\nThe **rectified** (*zhèng*) is **adaptation** (*mó*).\n**Reputation** (*míng*) is **adapted** to ensure the people are at ease and follow—\nThus, the state’s affairs are accomplished without effort.\n**Joy** (*xǐ*) is **adapted** to bring delight;\n**Deeds** (*xíng*) are **adapted** to achieve completion;\n**Integrity** (*lián*) is **adapted** to bring purity;\n**Trust** (*xìn*) is **adapted** to bring clarity.\n**Profit** (*lì*) is **adapted** to seek gain;\n**Humility** (*bēi*) is **adapted** to flatter.\n\n**Reputation** (*míng*) must be **exalted** and **promoted**—\nHence, it is called **exaltation** (*fā*).\n**Deeds** (*xíng*) must be **completed**—\nHence, it is called **completion** (*chéng*).\n\nThus, what the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) uses alone,\nOthers also possess,\nYet none achieve success—\nTheir use is incorrect.\n\nIt is said that the **Sage** alone **adapts** these ten matters,\nUsing **non-contention** (*buzheng*) to achieve success and establish affairs,\nYet common people all have them as well.\n\nIf their use is **borrowed ruin** (*shen*), not the **Dao/Way**—\nThen success cannot be attained.\n\nThus, **planning** is most difficult when it must be **thorough**,\n**Persuasion** is most difficult when it must be **fully heard**,\nAnd **affairs** are most difficult when they must be **certainly completed**.\n\nThese three challenges—\nOnly the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) can then accomplish them.\n\nIf **planning** is not **thorough**,\nThen the **opportunity** (*xī*) is lost, and the **endeavor** (*chéng*) is harmed.\nIf **persuasion** is not **fully heard**,\nThen **harmony** (*shùn*) is defied, and **doubt** (*yí*) arises.\nIf **affairs** are not **cross-completed** (*cházhéng*),\nThen **work is abandoned midway** (*zhǐzhuì*), and **ruin** (*fèi*) follows.\n\nAll these are difficult for others to bear,\nYet none find difficulty in them—\nOnly the **Sage** can do so.\n\nThus, **planning** must be **thorough**,\nAnd **persuasion** must be **fully heard**—\nOne must **choose** those with whom they can **communicate** (*tōng*) to speak.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*\"Some bonds are sealed without gaps.\"*\n\nTo those who can **communicate** (*tōng*), one **adapts** their **planning**—\n**Receiving** (*shòu*) it as **empty** (*xū*), like water receiving a stone,\nOpening currents to **harbor** (*nà*) springs.\nThus, no gaps can be found—\nHence, it is said:\n*\"One bond is sealed without gaps.\"*\n\nIf **affairs** are to be **completed**,\nThey must **align** with **fate** (*shù*).\nThus, it is said:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** of **fate** (*shù*) and **timing** (*shí*) must **correspond** with **fortune** (*yǎnshù*).\"*\n\nIf **planning** is to succeed,\nIt must first **consider** aligning with **fortune** (*yǎnshù*).\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of **fortune** (*yǎnshù*), **timing** (*shí*), and **fate** (*shù*) must all **correspond**—\nThen **affairs** can be **completed**, and **achievements** (*gōngyè*) can be **established**.\n\nIf **persuasion** is to be **heard**,\nThe **listener** must **align** with their **sentiments** (*qíng*).\nThus, it is said:\n*\"The **listener** must **align** with their **sentiments** (*qíng*).\"*\n\nTo **advance** (*jìn*) **persuasion** and ensure it is **heard**—\nOnly those who **align** with **sentiments** can do so.\n\nThus, **things** return to their **kindred** (*lèi*).\nCarrying wood toward fire,\nThe **dry** (*zào*) ignites first;\nPouring water on level ground,\nThe **moist** (*shī*) is first **soaked**.\n\nThis is how **things** of the same **kindred** (*lèi*) **respond** to **circumstances** (*shì*).\nIt is like this as well.\n\nThis speaks of the **inner resonance** (*nèifú*) **responding** to **external adaptation** (*wàimó*).\n\nIf **kindred** (*lèi*) is **obtained** (*dé*), then **response** (*yìng*) follows—\nLike water flowing to the **moist** (*shī*), fire advancing to the **dry** (*zào*).\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"**Adapt** with their **kindred** (*lèi*)—\nYet if there are those who do not **respond**,\nThen one must **adapt** with their **desires** (*yù*)—\nYet if there are those who do not **listen** (*tīng*).\"*\n\nThe **Way** of solitary action.\nOnly those skilled in **adaptation** (*mó*) could be the **Sage**.\nThus, the **Way** of solitary action is as such.\n\nThe **opportune** (*jǐ*) is never too late—\nWhen accomplished, it is not clung to;\nWhen enduring, it transforms naturally.\nTo act upon the **opportune**—what tardiness could there be?\nWhen the deed is done, it is not constrained—\nWhat lingering could there be?\n\nPracticing these two can transform the world.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Art of Persuasion**\nThe one who persuades does so by **endowing** (*zī*).\nThe persuader **endows** the other.\n**Endowing** means **taking** (*qǔ*).\n**Embellishing speech** is a **borrowing** (*jiǎ*)—\n**Borrowing** means **augmenting or diminishing** (*yì*).\n\nThe persuader **embellishes** speech to **appease** the other,\nYet it is not the **essence** of the matter.\nSince it is **borrowed**, there must be **augmentation or diminution**.\nThus, **borrowing** means **augmenting or diminishing**.\n\nThe **responder** uses **convenient words**—\n**Convenient words** are **light discourse** (*qīnglùn*).\nWhen asked, one **responds** and **replies**—\nYet it is merely **convenient words**.\nSince words seek **convenience**, the discussed matter naturally becomes **light discourse**,\nNot **true speech** (*zhìyán*).\n\nThe **completer of meaning** **clarifies**—\n**Clarifying** means **verification**.\nExamining **substantial matters** to establish **principles**,\nSeeking to **verify** truth and falsehood.\nOnce truth and falsehood are **clarified**, **verification** naturally follows.\nThus, **clarifying** means **verification**.\n\nWhen words **contradict**, it is to **repel**—\n**Difficult speech** is **repelling discourse**—\n**Repelling discourse** is **fishing for the opportune** (*diào jǐ*).\nWhen words do not align, they **contradict and challenge**,\nThus **repelling** prior discourse.\n**Repelling discourse**—\nWhen logic is **precise** and matters **clear**, the **subtle** can be fully **exhausted**.\nThus, **repelling discourse** is **fishing for the opportune**.\n\nTo seek the **profound and subtle**, it is called **fishing**.\n\n**Flattering speech** is **sycophantic yet claims loyalty**—\n**Stuffing** (*xiàn*) means **anticipating intent** to fulfill desires,\nSeeking the name of **loyalty**, hence **sycophantic yet claims loyalty**.\n\n**Flattering words** are **verbose yet claim wisdom**—\n**Verbose** means **prolific in rhetoric** to seek the name of **wisdom**, hence **verbose yet claim wisdom**.\n\n**Bold speech** is **reckless yet claims courage**—\n**Reckless** means **unhesitating abandonment**, seeking the name of **courage**, hence **reckless yet claims courage**.\n\n**Mournful speech** is **scheming yet claims sincerity**—\n**Mournful** means **feigning sorrow** in speech.\n**Scheming** means **strategizing and advancing counsel** to seek the name of **sincerity**, hence **scheming yet claims sincerity**.\n\n**Calm speech** is **contradictory yet claims victory**—\n**Calm speech** means **feigning purity** in speech.\n**Contradictory** means **prematurely denying** to **block the false**, seeking the name of **victory**, hence **contradictory yet claims victory**.\n\n**Anticipating intent to fulfill desires** is **sycophancy**,\n**Prolific in rhetoric** is **verbosity**,\n**Strategizing and advancing counsel** is **scheming**,\n**Unhesitating abandonment** is **recklessness**,\n**Prematurely denying to block the false** is **contradiction**.\n\nWhen one’s **true self** is insufficient,\nYet **unaware**, they **internally dispute**,\nAnd **counterattack** others’ faults,\n**Blocking** others’ objections—\nThis is **contradiction**.\n\nThus, the **mouth** is the **mechanism**—\nIt **closes** emotions and intentions;\nThe **ears and eyes** are the **auxiliaries** of the **heart**—\nThey **spy** on questions and **expose deceit**.\n\nThus it is said:\n**Harmonize the three** and **respond**,\n**Benefit the Dao** and **act**.\nThe **mouth** is for **uttering speech**, hence the **mechanism**.\nEmotions and intentions depend on the **mechanism**, hence **closing** them.\nThe **ears and eyes** assist the **heart** in **understanding principles**, hence **auxiliaries**.\nWhen the **heart** uses **ears and eyes**, it can **spy on gaps** and **see deceit**, hence **exposing deceit**.\n\nWhen the **ears, heart, and eyes** are **harmonized** and **responsive**,\nTheir **action** will **succeed**—\nNothing will be **unfavorable**.\nTheir **unfavorableness** is **nonexistent** because they **move with the Dao**.\nThus, **harmonize the three and respond**, **benefit the Dao and act**.\n\nThus, when **speaking is struck** yet **not disordered**,\nWhen **soaring** yet **not confused**,\nWhen **changing** yet **not perilous**—\nThis is **grasping the essential** and **obtaining principle**.\n\nIf one can **perceive the essential** and **grasp principle**,\nThen **flexibility** will **succeed without loss**.\n\nThus, though **speech is tangled yet not disordered**,\nThough **soaring is boundless yet not confused**,\nThough **changing** departs from **constancy yet is not perilous**—\nThis is so.\n\nThus, the **blind** cannot be shown **five colors**,\nThe **deaf** cannot be told of **five tones**.\n**Five colors** are for those with **eyes**,\nHence the **blind** cannot be **shown** them.\n**Five tones** are for those with **ears**,\nHence the **deaf** cannot be **told** of them.\nThese two are **divisions** for what follows.\n\nThus, what cannot be **sent forth** has **no opening** for it,\nWhat cannot be **received** has **no acceptance** for it.\nThere are **things that do not communicate**—\nHence the **Sage** does not **attend** to them.\nWhat cannot be **persuaded** in the other is because they are **obtuse and stagnant**, with **no opening**.\nWhat the other does not **persuade** here is because they are **shallow and narrow**, with **no acceptance**.\n\nThe **shallow and narrow** and the **obtuse and stagnant**\nAre always **blocked** and **uncommunicative**,\nHence the **Sage** does not **attend** to them.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*The mouth can eat, but not speak.*\n**Speech** has **taboos and prohibitions**.\n**Many mouths** can **melt gold**—\nThis is because **speech has hidden motives**.\nThe **mouth** can **nourish** the **hundred bodies**, hence it can **eat**.\nYet **speech** can **summon** the **hundred calamities**, hence it cannot **speak**.\n**Speech** **touches taboos and prohibitions**, hence **taboos and prohibitions**.\nGold is a **durable thing**, yet **many mouths** can **melt** it—\nThis is because **many mouths** have **private motives**.\nThus, **speech has hidden motives**.\n\nHuman **nature**—\nWhen **speaking**, they desire to be **heard**;\nWhen **acting**, they desire **success**.\nWhat is **hearable** depends on **aligning** with the other,\nWhat is **successful** depends on **following principle**.\nThis is the **beginning** for what follows.\n\nThus, the **wise** do not use their **weaknesses** but use the **strengths** of the **foolish**,\nDo not use their **clumsiness** but use the **skills** of the **foolish**,\nHence they are **not constrained**.\nThe **wise**’s **weaknesses** cannot **overcome** the **foolish**’s **strengths**,\nHence they use the **foolish**’s **strengths**.\n\nThe **wise**’s clumsiness cannot overcome the **foolish**’s skill, hence they use the **foolish**’s skill.\nIf one can always abandon their clumsiness and use the **foolish**’s skill, they will not be constrained.\n\nWhen speaking of what is beneficial, one follows their strengths;\nWhen speaking of what is harmful, one avoids their weaknesses.\nIf one follows the strengths of what is beneficial and avoids the weaknesses of what is harmful,\nThen their speech will be heard, and their actions will succeed.\n\nThus, the **armored insect**’s fierceness must rely on its **solidity**,\nThe **stinging insect**’s movement must rely on its **venom**.\nHence, **birds and beasts** use their strengths,\nAnd the **orator** knows how to use their advantages.\n\nThe **armored insect** hides itself with its **solidity**,\nThe **stinging insect** moves with venom to defend itself—\nThis is using their strengths.\nThus, they can avoid harm.\n\nEven other birds and beasts do not fail to use their strengths to preserve themselves.\nThe **orator**, observing this, also knows what to use and how to use it.\n\nThus, there are **five kinds of speech**:\n**Illness**, **grievance**, **worry**, **anger**, and **joy**.\nIf any one of these five arises, it disrupts **harmony** and **clarity**.\n\nThus:\n**Illness** arises from **weakened qi** and **lack of spirit**—\nThe ill are **dazed**, so their qi is weak and their spirit is absent.\n**Grievance** arises from **ruptured intestines** and **lack of mastery**—\nThe grieved are inwardly agitated, so their intestines are ruptured and their speech lacks control.\n**Worry** arises from **blockage** and **no release**—\nThe worried are **restless**, so they are blocked and their speech does not flow.\n**Anger** arises from **reckless movement** and **lack of restraint**—\nThe angry are **stifled and surging**, so they move recklessly and their speech is uncontrolled.\n**Joy** arises from **dissipation** and **lack of focus**—\nThe joyful are **shaken**, so they scatter and their speech lacks purpose.\n\nThese five, when **refined**, are used;\nWhen **advantageous**, they are applied.\nSince these five deviate from **moderation**, their use must be **refined**, and their application must be **advantageous**.\nIf they are neither refined nor advantageous, they are abandoned.\n\nThus:\nWhen speaking with the **wise**, rely on **breadth**;\nWith the **clumsy**, rely on **clarity**;\nWith the **eloquent**, rely on **concision**;\nWith the **noble**, rely on **authority**;\nWith the **wealthy**, rely on **elevation**;\nWith the **poor**, rely on **benefit**;\nWith the **lowly**, rely on **humility**;\nWith the **bold**, rely on **daring**;\nWith the **reckless**, rely on **sharpness**.\n\nThis is the **method**, yet people often reverse it.\nThis is the **measure** for appropriate speech—\nThose who do not understand reverse it,\nAnd thus act against **principle**, failing to avoid harm.\n\nHence:\nWhen speaking with the **wise**, use this to **illuminate** them;\nWhen speaking with the **unwise**, use this to **teach** them—yet it is difficult.\nTo speak with the **wise**, present this **method** clearly;\nTo speak with the **unwise**, teach them this **method**—\nBut since people’s confusion deepens over time, teaching them is difficult.\n\nThus, **speech** has many **categories**, and **actions** have many **changes**.\nHence, it is said:\nIf speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.\nSpeech is **diverse and intricate**, hence many **categories**.\nActions adapt to **circumstances**, hence many **changes**.\nIf speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.\n\nTo remain unchanging yet not lose **principle**—\nThis is why the **wise** value **not acting rashly**.\nNot being disordered, they do not change,\nThus their **principle** remains constant.\nThose who can maintain constancy without change—\nThis is the **use of wisdom**, hence their wisdom is **precious and not rash**.\n\nListening values **acuity**,\nWisdom values **clarity**,\nSpeech values **originality**.\nIf listening is **acute**, truth and falsehood are not confused;\nIf wisdom is **clear**, right and wrong are self-evident;\nIf speech is **original**, right and wrong have **proof**.\n\nIf these three are practiced, then **achievement** and **success** are secured—\nHence they must be **valued**.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Planning**\nIn human affairs, planning follows **human nature**.\nObtain the **foundation**, and the **foundation** must be obtained,\nThen seek its **pattern**, and **human nature** can be sought.\nSeeing **human nature** and planning, then no matter is left unfinished.\n\nCarefully obtaining **human nature**, one establishes the **Three Complements**.\nThey are: **Middle**, **Low**.\n\nUsing these three to verify, then **strange strategies** can arise.\nThe **Three Complements** are:\n**Upper**—to generate **strangeness**.\n**Strangeness** does not know its **origin**, beginning from ancient **patterns**.\n\nThe three are used together to verify,\nThen **strange strategies** can emerge.\nOnce **strange strategies** arise, they are universally effective—\nYet they are **obscured**.\n\nMeasuring **talent** and **ability**, one does not know their **limitations**.\nYet these **strange strategies** did not originate today or yesterday.\nThus, those of **shared nature** and **affinity** begin from antiquity, following **principle**.\n\nThe **South-pointing chariot** is used for those who do not **weigh circumstances**—\nYet it is also a **guide** for those whose affairs succeed together.\nThose of **shared desire** but **estranged**—\nThese are those who **harm each other**.\nAll who share **nature** and **desire** to **plan and act together**:\nIf their affairs succeed together, later they will be **affectionate**;\nIf one succeeds and one is harmed, later they will be **estranged**—this is **principle**.\n\nThose who share **hatred** and are **affectionate**—\nThese are those who **harm each other together**.\nThose who share **hatred** but are **estranged**—\nThese are those who **harm each other partially**.\n**Shared hatred** means they are **hated by the same**.\nLater, if both are harmed, their **nature** will be **affectionate**;\nIf one is spared and one is harmed, **principle** dictates they will be **estranged**—\nThis too is **principle**.\n\nThus, **benefit brings closeness**, **harm brings estrangement**—\nThis is the **constant law**.\n\nThis is how one discerns the **division of similarity and difference**—\nTheir **categories** are the same.\n\nThe **division of similarity and difference** is examined using this.\nThus, walls collapse at their **cracks**,\nWood breaks at its **knots**—\nThis is their **division**.\n\nWalls and wood are destroyed because of **cracks and knots**,\nHow much more so in **human affairs**, where **changes arise from similarity and difference**!\nThus, it is said: This is their **division**.\n\nThus, **changes arise from affairs**,\nAffairs arise from **planning**,\nPlanning arises from **strategy**,\nStrategy arises from **debate**,\nDebate arises from **persuasion**,\nPersuasion arises from **advancement**,\nAdvancement arises from **retreat**,\nRetreat arises from **control**.\n\nUsing **control** to govern **affairs**,\nThus, all **affairs** follow **one path**,\nAnd all **methods** follow **one principle**.\n\n「Speaking of affairs, they have **fundamental roots** and **origins**—\nEach has its own source, like plants and trees that grow from roots into branches, twigs, flowers, and leaves.\nThus, it is said: **#30 The Way of Change** unfolds,\nAnd then **affairs and undertakings** emerge.\n\nThose who bring forth **affairs and undertakings** must first devise **strategy and planning**.\nThose who perfect **strategy and planning** must first engage in **debate and persuasion**.\n**Debate and persuasion** must be weighed for their **correctness or error**,\nThus, **advancement and retreat** are required.\n\nOnce **dismissal and elevation** are determined,\n**Affairs** must be set as **precedent**,\nAnd then all **undertakings and methods**—what is there that does not arise from this?\nTheir **Dao and principles** are singular.\n\nThe **virtuous person** holds **wealth in light regard**,\nCannot be tempted by **gain**,\nBut can be moved to **expend**;\nThe **brave warrior** scorns **hardship**,\nCannot be deterred by **calamity**,\nBut can be urged to **embrace peril**;\nThe **wise strategist** grasps **principles** and understands **logic**,\nCannot be deceived by **false sincerity**,\nBut can be shown **reason and rightness**,\nAnd thus **achieve merit**—\nThese are the **Three Talents**.\n\nIf you lead those who hold **wealth in light regard** to **expend**,\nThen **wealth** can be preserved;\nIf you guide those who scorn **hardship** to **embrace peril**,\nThen **peril** can be **calmed**;\nIf you inspire those who grasp **principles** to **achieve merit**,\nThen **merit** can be **accomplished**.\n\nCombining these **Three Talents** and applying them,\nOne can **illuminate** a thousand *li* (leagues),\nWhy limit oneself to mere **twelve strategies** alone?\n\nThus, the **foolish** are easily **obstructed**,\nThe **unworthy** are easily **intimidated**,\nThe **greedy** are easily **enticed**—\nThis is **adapting to circumstances**.\n\nUsing these **three strengths**,\nAnd **countering** those **three weaknesses**,\nOne can **establish undertakings** and **achieve merit**.\n\nThe **planner** must **study circumstances** and **adapt accordingly**.\nThus, it is said: **Adapt to circumstances**.\n\nTherefore, the **strong** must **accumulate weakness**,\nAnd the **abundant** must **accumulate insufficiency**—\nThis is the **Dao of flexibility** in practice.\n\n**Softness overcomes hardness**,\nThus, **accumulating weakness** can bring **great strength**.\n**Straightness follows curvature**,\nThus, **accumulating curvature** can achieve **straightness**.\n**Fewness gains multitude**,\nThus, **accumulating insufficiency** can yield **abundance**.\n\nHence, **using weakness as strength**,\n**curving as straightness**,\n**insufficiency as abundance**,\nThis is the **Dao of flexibility** in action,\nThus, it is called: **The Way of Adaptive Practice**.\n\nTherefore, when advising a ruler whose **inner trust is distant** while **outerly close**,\nSpeak of the **inner**;\nWhen advising a subject whose **inner trust is close** while **outerly distant**,\nSpeak of the **outer**.\n\nIf **outerly close in appearance** but **innerly distant in truth**,\nThen speak of the **inner** to **remove internal estrangement**.\nIf **innerly close in truth** but **outerly distant in appearance**,\nThen speak of the **outer** to **remove external estrangement**.\n\nThus, **exploit their doubts** to **transform** them,\n**Confirm their perceptions** to **settle** them—\nIf **inner and outer** are not close and one harbors **doubt**,\nThen **exploit their doubt** and **change** them.\nIf they **perceive** something and **hold a view**,\nThen **confirm their perception** to **establish** it.\n\n**Leverage their arguments** to **bind** them,\n**Exploit their momentum** to **complete** it—\nOnce **views** are shaped, there are **positions of approach or withdrawal**,\nThen **exploit their momentum** to **fulfill** it.\nOnce **positions** are set, if **evil persists**,\nThen **weigh their evil** to **counterbalance** it,\nAnd **dismiss their remnants** to **repel** them.\n\n**Gently press** to **frighten** them,\n**Heighten risks** to **stir** them—\nOnce **evil is dismissed**, if they **rely on victory** and **become arrogant**,\nThen **press them gently** to **instill fear**,\nAnd **expose them to peril** to **shake** their confidence.\n\n**Subtly correct** to **align** them,\n**Use omens** to **respond**—\nThough **fear and agitation** may take hold,\nIf they still **do not understand change**,\nThen **subtly present evidence** to **verify** it,\nAnd **set up signs** to **confirm** the truth.\n\n**Surround and block** them,\n**Disrupt and confuse** them—\nThis is called **strategy and planning**.\n\nThough **evidence and signs** are presented,\nIf they still **do not understand change**,\nThis is perhaps **too deep to remedy**—\nThen **surround and block** them,\n**Disrupt and confuse** them,\nAnd **counter their resistance** to **gain** them.\n\nThus, one can **employ strategy and planning**.\n\nThe **application of strategy and planning**,\n**Public methods** are not as effective as **private**,\n**Private** is not as effective as **binding**—\n**Binding** means **no gaps**.\n\n**Public methods** are proclaimed in the **royal court**,\nKnown as **litigious assembly**,\nWhere **no one bears blame**,\nAnd their **undertakings are hard to fulfill**.\n**Private methods** do not leave the **inner court**,\nAre **cautious and precise**,\nAnd their **merits can be achieved**.\n\nThus, **public methods are not as effective as private**.\n\nEven **secret planning** is not as effective as **binding with them**.\nTwo people with **unified hearts**,\nNo **external force** can **pierce** them—\nTo seek their **gaps**, how possible is it?\n\n**Directness** is not as effective as **indirectness**—\n**Indirectness** is **unending flow**.\n\n**Directness** follows **logic** and **holds to constancy**,\nIs **difficult to advance swiftly**.\n**Indirectness** **inverts principles** yet **aligns with rightness**,\n**Undertakings** **match the moment** like **crossbows** firing.\n\nThus, **directness is not as effective as indirectness**.\nWhen **indirect strategies** are **executed once**,\nThey **circulate endlessly** and **no one knows their end**.\n\nThus, it is said: **Indirectness flows without stopping**.\n\nTherefore, when advising a **sovereign**,\nOne must speak of **indirectness**,\nAnd when advising a **minister**,\nOne must speak of **privacy**.\n\nSpeaking of **indirectness** to a **sovereign**,\nThen **extraordinary merit** can be **achieved**;\nSpeaking of **privacy** to a **minister**,\nThen **self-preservation** can be **fully secured**.\n\nIf their **body is inwardly aligned** yet their **words outwardly distant**,\nThen the **superficial** become **estranged**;\nIf their **body is outwardly distant** yet their **words inwardly profound**,\nThen the **deeply placed** are **in peril**.\nIf one’s **body is inward** yet their **words outward**,\nThen the **leaky** are **again estranged**;\nIf one’s **body is outward** yet their **words deep**,\nThen the **urgent** are **again in peril**.\n\nDo not **force upon others** what they **nearly dislike**,\nDo not **teach others** what they **do not know**.\n\nIf the **undertaking** is **close at hand** yet they **dislike it**,\nDo not **force** it upon them—\nThey will **harbor resentment and anger**.\nWhen **teaching others**, use what they **already know**—\nNow to **teach them what they do not know** is like **using darkness to dispel darkness**,\nHow can this be **beneficial**?\n\nPeople have **likes**—\n**Study** and **align** with them;\nPeople have **dislikes**—\n**Avoid** and **conceal** them,\nThus, **hidden paths** are **taken** while **open paths** are **chosen**.\n\n**Study** and **align** with what people **like**,\n**Avoid** and **conceal** what people **dislike**—\nDo this **in secret**;\nNot **contrary** to their **nature**,\nThey will **respond with joy**—\nThen **clearly state** to **reward** them.\n\nThus, it is said: **Hidden paths are taken while open paths are chosen**.\n\nTherefore, to **remove** them, **grant freedom**,\nAnd to **grant freedom**, **exploit their momentum**—\nWhen you wish to **remove** them,\nFirst **listen to their freedom**,\nLet them **push their transgressions to extremes**.\n\nOnce their **transgressions are extreme**,\nThen **apply the law** to **counter** them.\n\nThus, it is said: **\"To indulge is to exploit them.\"**\n\n**Appearance**—\nNeither beautiful nor ugly, hence **truthful emotions** are **entrusted** to it.\n**Appearance** refers to observing people’s **demeanor** to discern their **emotions**,\nThat is, when they see good, they do not praise it,\nAnd when they see evil, they do not condemn it.\nThose who act thus can **entrust** their **truthful emotions** to it.\nHence, it is said: **\"Truthful emotions are entrusted to it.\"**\n\nWhat can be **known** can be **employed**,\nWhat cannot be **known** is what the **planner** does not **employ**.\nIt is said that their **emotions** are broad and subtle,\nThose who can be made to **know** can be **employed** in **planning**,\nHence, it is said: **\"What can be known can be employed.\"**\nThose whose **emotions** are not broad and subtle,\nThose who cannot be made to **know** are not **employed** in **planning**,\nHence, it is said: **\"What cannot be known is what the planner does not employ.\"**\n\nTherefore, **matters** are **valued** in **controlling others**,\nAnd not in being **controlled** by others.\n**Controlling others** is **holding authority**,\nBeing **controlled** by others is **submitting to fate**.\n**Submitting to fate** means one’s **fate** is **controlled** by others.\nHence, the **Dao/Way** of the **sage** is **hidden**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **open**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **sage** is **internally open** yet **externally hidden**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **internally hidden** yet **externally open**.\n\nThe **wise** find **matters** easy,\nThe **unwise** find **matters** difficult.\nFrom this perspective, **perishing** cannot be **preserved**,\nAnd **danger** cannot be **made secure**,\nYet it is said: **\"The Way of non-action values wisdom.\"**\n\nThe **wise** are **forgiving**,\nHence **matters** are easy for them;\nThe **foolish** are **suspicious**,\nHence **matters** are difficult for them.\nYet even the **unwise** may suffer **perishing** or **danger**,\nBecause their **matters** are difficult,\nThus the **virtuous** cannot **fully implement** their **strategies**—\nThen the **perishing** will **perish**, the **dangerous** will **remain dangerous**,\nAnd to **seek security** and **preservation** is not also difficult?\nNow, if one wishes to **preserve** the **perishing**,\nAnd **secure** the **dangerous**,\nThen none but the **wise** can do it.\nHence, it is said: **\"The Way of non-action values wisdom.\"**\n\nWisdom is **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **know**,\nYet can be **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **see**.\nWhat the **multitude** cannot **know**,\nWhat the **multitude** cannot **see**,\nOnly the **wise** can **employ** it,\nThus wisdom is **valued** above all.\n\nOnce **employed**,\nIf what is **seen** is **appropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **oneself**;\nIf what is **seen** is **inappropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **others**.\nIt is also said:\nWhen wisdom is **employed**, first for **oneself**, then for **others**,\nIf what is **seen** is **appropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **oneself**;\nIf what is **not seen** is **inappropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **others**.\nIt is like **Bo Le** teaching the **cherished** yet **discarding the unworthy**,\nAnd **rewarding the diligent** yet **abandoning the sluggish**.\n\nHence, the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** had **hidden words**,\nSaying: **\"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies in loftiness and depth.\"**\nThe **sage’s** **establishment** of the **Dao/Way** lies in **concealment** and **obscurity**,\nNot merely in **loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness**,\nBut in **moderation and rectitude** alone.\nIt is said that the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** values **hidden subtlety**.\nExamining the **ancient remnants**,\nVerifying that this **principle** exists,\nIt is said: **\"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies only in loftiness and depth,\nThe sage’s establishment of the Dao/Way lies only in concealment and obscurity.\"**\nWhat is **concealed** is **moderation and rectitude**,\nNaturally **harmonizing** with the **Dao/Way**,\nNot **exclusively** in **benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and sincerity**.\nHence, it is said: **\"Not merely in loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness.\"**\n\nWhen the **principles** of the **Dao/Way** are **understood** to this extent,\nThen one can **discuss** them.\nIt is said that the **planner** **grasps** the **principles** of the **Dao/Way**,\nIf one can **reach** this **extent** and **be fluent**,\nThen one can **speak** to the **highest** and **most profound** **levels**.\nFrom **obtaining** this,\nOne can then **discuss** the **far and near** **principles**#33.\n**Discuss** means **nurture**.\nIf one **obtains** this **Dao/Way’s principle**,\nThen one can **hold** the **great treasure** **position**,\n**Nurture** the **far and near** people,\nAnd **lead** them to the **domain of longevity**.\n**Decision** Chapter Eleven\n\nIn **ordinary matters**,\nWhen **entrusting** to **people**,\nOne must **entrust** to those who **doubt**,\nFor **good use** brings **blessing**,\nAnd **bad use** brings **calamity**—\n**Good** extends to **leading** them.\nOnly after **doubt** does one **entrust**,\nHence, it is said: **\"Again, entrust to those who doubt.\"**\n\n**Nearly** **people’s** **emotions**,\nWhen **blessing** is **employed**, are **good**,\nWhen **calamity** is **employed**, are **evil**.\nThe **principles** of **blessing** and **calamity** are **not yet clear**,\nThus **doubt** arises from them.\nHence, it is said: **\"Good use brings blessing, evil use brings calamity.\"**\n\nYet, those who **follow** after **doubt**,\nFirst **lead** them to **obtain** their **emotions**,\nThen can **determine** their **appropriateness or inappropriateness**.\n**Ultimately**, there is **no confusion** or **partiality**,\nOnly **benefit** can arise.\nRemove their **benefit**,\nAnd they will **not accept** it.\nThis is the **strange** **entrustment**.\n\n**Holding doubt** is **confusion**,\n**Not being upright** is **partiality**.\nThose who **follow** without **confusion** or **partiality**,\nThen the **doer** will have **success and guidance**,\nAnd **blessing and benefit** will arise.\nIf one **removes** their **blessing and benefit**,\nThen the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**.\n**Further**, **entrust** one’s **intentions** to the **strange**.\n\n**Tending toward novelty** and **changing constancy**,\nIs called **strange**#36.\nIf there is **benefit** in **goodness**,\nAnd one **conceals** and **entrusts** it to **evil**,\nThen they will **not accept** it,\nAnd it will **lead to estrangement**.\nIt is said that the **doubters**, **based on their benefit**,\nAnd **goodness**, yet the **followers** **conceal** their **benefit** and **goodness**,\nAnd **entrust** it to **evil**,\nThen the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**,\nAnd it will **lead to estrangement**.\n\nHence, there are those who **cause loss of benefit**,\nAnd those who **cause separation from harm**—\nThis is the **failure** of **matters**.\nIt is said that the **two upper** **methods**,\nSometimes **remove benefit** and **entrust to evil**,\nThe **doubters**, having **not accepted** their **followers**,\nThen what is **done** will **not succeed** in **guidance**.\nHence, there are **failures** in **loss of benefit** and **suffering harm**.\nAll these are the **failures** of **matters**.\n\nThe **sage** can **accomplish** their **matters** through **five methods**:\nThere are those who **employ** **open virtue**,\nThose who **employ** **hidden guile**,\nThose who **employ** **sincerity and trust**,\nThose who **employ** **concealment and obscurity**,\nAnd those who **employ** **moderation and simplicity**.\nThe **sage** excels in **adaptation and flexibility**,\nExhausts the **principles** of **things**,\nAnd **nearly** **matters** **are completed** through them.\nWhen **matters** are **completed** and **principles** are **established**,\n**Open virtue** is **employed**;\nWhen **emotions** are **hidden** and **words** are **false**,\n**Hidden guile** is **employed**;\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is **established** and **intentions** are **straightforward**,\n**Sincerity and trust** are **employed**;\nWhen **deceit** is **minor** and **harm** is **slight**,\n**Concealment and obscurity** are **employed**;\nWhen **following constancy** and **holding to the old**,\n**Moderation and simplicity** are **employed**.\n**Open virtue** is **encouraged** with **one word**,\n**Hidden guile** is **encouraged** with **two words**,\n**Moderation and simplicity** serve as the **pivot and mechanism** for **employment**,\nAnd the **fourth** is **subtle** yet **applied**.\n**Encourage** means **exhort**.\n**Open** is the **Dao/Way** of the **ruler**,\nHence what is **spoken** is **also encouraged** with **one word**.\n\nOne—**non-action**. The **shadow** is the **path of the subject**, hence what is spoken is also **exhorted with two words**.\nTwo—**action**. The **ruler’s path** is **non-action**, hence **moderation and simplicity** are the **primary**.\nThe **subject’s path** is **action**, hence **pivot and mechanism** are **employed**.\n\nWhen **one** is spoken, when **two** is spoken, when **moderation and simplicity** are applied, when **pivot and mechanism** are used—these four methods in their **application** are **refined and subtle**, **harmonizing with the profound**, then **affairs proceed** and **principles face no difficulty**.\n\nThus, **measuring past events**, **verifying future ones**, **consulting moderation and simplicity**, if **proper**, then **employ it**.\nWhen **ruler and subject** have **fixed roles**, then **measure the past**, **verify the future**, **consult moderation and simplicity**, **calculate right and wrong**—if **in accord with principle**, then **employ it as a method**.\n\nIn **public and royal affairs** of **great lords**, when **dangerous yet glorious**—if **proper**, then **decide upon it**.\nDanger arises from **height**—when **affairs are lofty** and **reputation glorious**, then **employ it as a method**.\n\nWhen **effort is spared** and **success is easy**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.\nThis is called **\"benevolence without expenditure\"**, hence **employ it as a method**.\n\nWhen **effort is exerted**, **labor is strenuous**, yet **inevitable**—then **employ it**.\nThis is called **\"knowing what cannot be helped\"**, **\"accepting it as fate\"**, hence **employ it as a method**.\n\nTo **remove calamity**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.\nTo **follow blessing**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.\nTo **reject calamity** and **follow blessing** is the **greatest harmony of principle**, hence **employ it as a method**.\n\nThus, **settling doubts with sincerity** is the **pivot of ten thousand affairs**.\nTo **restore order from chaos**, to **determine success or failure**—this is **difficult to execute**.\nOrder is restored by **uprightness**, success or failure is **decided by method**—a **hair’s breadth** off, and the **result is miles apart**.\nThe **triggering of mechanisms** is the **source of honor and disgrace**, hence it is said: **difficult to execute**.\n\nThus, the **ancient kings** used **tortoise shells and milfoil** to **consult themselves**.\nThough the **ancient kings’ sagacity** was **omniscient**, they still **cast divination** to **determine methods**. How much more should those **below them** dare to **rely solely on themselves**, without **seeking counsel from the wise**?\n\n**The Twelfth Canon: Concordant Speech**\nWhen **words are spoken**, they **must be verified**, like **seals and contracts**, hence it is called **Concordant Speech**.\n\n**Calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**—those they **reach** are **nourished**.\n*\"Reach\"* means **extend**; *\"nourished\"* means **abundant**.\nWhen a **person in position** can be **calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**, then **all they influence** are **well-regulated and abundant**.\n\n**Giving generously yet remaining tranquil**, with a **vacant heart and even mind**, awaiting **depletion or loss**—\nWhen a **ruler** is **skilled in bestowing favors** yet **not tranquil**, only by **vacant heart and even mind** can they **await it**, for **depletion or loss** will **surely arrive**.\n\n**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **position**.\nThose who **hold position** must be **calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**.\n\n**Eyes value clarity**, **ears value acuity**, **mind values wisdom**.\n**Clear eyes** see **nothing unseen**, **acute ears** hear **nothing unheard**, **wise mind** thinks **nothing unperceived**.\nIf these three are **unobstructed**, then **what action is not appropriate**?\n\nTo **see with the world’s eyes** is to **see nothing unseen**, to **hear with the world’s ears** is to **hear nothing unheard**, to **plan with the world’s wisdom** is to **know nothing unknown**.\nIn the **age of Emperor Yao**, **bright and enlightened**, **cultivating the world**, he **employed this method**.\n\n**Radiance and fragrance advance together**, then **clarity cannot be blocked**.\nThe **sage does not act alone**—their **brightness and wisdom** are **delegated to the world**.\nThus, the **clear-seeing govern**, the **acute-hearing listen**, the **wise advise**.\nLike **following the dragon**, **wind following the tiger**, **inevitable yet unchecked**.\n**Radiance and fragrance advance together**—how could it be otherwise?\nLike **sun and moon shining**, how could they be **blocked**?\nHence it is said: **clarity cannot be blocked**.\n\n**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **clarity**.\nThose who **hold clarity** do so by **seeing with the world’s eyes**.\n\n**The art of virtue** is: **do not rigidly reject**.\n**Nurturing virtue** lies in **expansiveness and inclusivity**.\nMountains **do not reject dust**, hence they **achieve height**; seas **do not spurn tides**, hence they **achieve depth**.\nThe **sage does not repel the multitude**, hence they **achieve greatness**.\nThus it is said: **do not rigidly reject**.\n\n**Permit them, and they will guard**; **reject them, and they will close off**.\nIf you **permit and embrace**, the **multitude will return and defend**.\nIf you **reject and oppose**, the **multitude will rebel and stagnate**.\nTo **nurture virtue**, how can one **fail to be expansive and inclusive**?\n\nMountains **can be measured in height**, depths **can be fathomed**—yet **divine and enlightened positions**, **upright and tranquil**, **cannot be measured**.\nMountains **cannot exceed height**, depths **cannot exceed depth**—yet **divine and enlightened positions**—when **approached, no front is seen**; when **followed, no rear is seen**. How can they be **measured**?\n\n**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **virtue**.\nThose who **hold virtue** do so by **embracing expansiveness and not resisting**.\n\n**Rewards must be trustworthy**, **punishments must be just**.\n**Trustworthy rewards** make **meritorious officers** **risk life for duty**.\n**Just punishments** ensure **those executed** **die without resentment**.\n\n**Rewards must be trustworthy**—**verify what eyes and ears witness**; what is **unseen and unheard** will **inevitably transform**.\nWhen **bestowing favors and rewards**, if **ears and eyes verify** without **error**, and **actions align with merit**, then **trust precedes speech**, and even the **unseen and unheard** will **harmonize**.\n\n**Sincerity permeates the divine and enlightened**—how much more so for **deceitful schemers** daring to **assail the ruler**?\nThis is like **rotten meat before sharp blades**—**no harm will come**.\n\n**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **rewards**.\nThose who **hold rewards** value **trustworthiness**.\n\n**The Threefold Sovereignty of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity**\n\nOne is **Heaven’s**, one is **Earth’s**, and one is **Humanity’s**.\nHeaven has the **order of逆顺** (inverse and compliance),\nEarth has the **principles of孤虚** (loneliness and emptiness),\nHumanity has the **divisions of通塞** (flow and obstruction).\nThose who hold **the Mandate of Heaven** must all know these.\n\nIn **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**—\nwhere is the **wandering star (荧惑)**?\nFor **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**,\nthere are **proper alignments of yin and yang**, **facing and turning**—\nthese are what **governors and officials must not fail to understand**.\nMoreover, **荧惑** is **Heaven’s legal star**—\nwhere it resides brings **disaster to the blue-green** (east),\nand its **auspicious or inauspicious influence is particularly pronounced**.\nThus it is said:\nEven **a sagely monarch** must **scrutinize where 荧惑 resides**.\nTherefore, one must also **know this**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Questions**\nThe sovereign who **questions** must **discern the Dao of the Three Powers (三才)**.\nThe **heart governs the nine orifices**,\nthe **ruler is the leader of the five senses**.\nThe **nine orifices move as the heart directs**,\nand the **five senses act as the ruler commands**.\nFor those who do **good**, the ruler **bestows rewards**;\nfor those who do **wrong**, the ruler **inflicts punishments**.\n**Rewarding the good and punishing the wrong** is the **great principle of governance**.\nThe ruler **follows the means by which governance is sought**—\nif he **responds accordingly**, there will be **no labor**.\n**Responding** means **granting what is requested**;\n**requesting** means **seeking without fulfillment**.\nIf **requests are met**, then **giving and receiving are not arbitrary**;\nif **what is given is received**, then **actions proceed without delay**.\nMoving in accordance with **nature**, what **labor is there**?\nThe **sage employs this**, and thus **can reward appropriately**.\nFollowing **principle**, it **endures without fail**.\nResponding to **requests**, there is **no greater joy**.\nEven without **jade and silk**, the **encouragement is as if rewards were given**.\nYet if **one acts against principle**, **disaster comes swiftly**.\nFollowing **principle**, it **endures long**—\nthis is the **sovereign who responds**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Response**\nThe sovereign who **responds** must **follow principle**.\nThe ruler **cannot be neglectful**.\nIf the ruler is **neglectful**, then **crafty ministers arise**, and **the people are oppressed and rebellious**.\n**Neglect** means **not comprehending the principles of things**.\nWhen **principles are not fully known**, then **crafty ministers cause chaos**.\n**Business (家)**—like **crafts**—becomes **unstable**,\nand **inner and outer affairs are disconnected**.\nHow can one **know what to open**?\n**Business (家)** here means **enterprise**.\nSince **crafty ministers are in chaos**, what they **undertake is unstable**,\nand **inner and outer affairs are blocked**—\n**obstacles abound on all paths**.\nHow can one **know what to open**?\nIf **opening and closing are mismanaged**, the **source of good governance is unseen**.\n**Opening and closing** refer to **牌阖** (the art of strategic disclosure and concealment).\nSince **牌阖’s principles are not applied**, the **source of good governance remains hidden**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Comprehensive Knowledge**\nThe sovereign who **comprehends** must **know the principles of all things**.\nOne is **long-sightedness (长目)**,\ntwo is **flying ears (飞耳)**,\nthree is **establishing clarity (树明)**.\nUsing **the eyes of all under Heaven to see**, hence **long-sightedness**.\nUsing **the ears of all under Heaven to hear**, hence **flying ears**.\nUsing **the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**, hence **establishing clarity**.\nWith **clarity**, one **knows a thousand li away**,\nand **what is hidden and subtle**—\nthis is called **penetrating all under Heaven**.\n**Delinquents cannot conceal their schemes** in their hearts.\nFor **using the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**,\nthere is **nothing unknown**—\nthus, **a thousand li away**, **hidden and subtle matters** are **all discerned**.\nSince **hidden things are exposed**, those who **plot evil** will **abandon their schemes in their hearts**.\nThus it is said: **They cannot but change**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Reverence**\nThe sovereign who **reveres** must **possess keen intelligence and refined thought**.\nFollowing **names to achieve reality**, one **remains secure and complete**.\nWhen **reality matches the name**, this is **security**.\n**Names and reality** generate each other,\nand **oppose each other in their essence**.\nFollowing **names to achieve reality**,\nand **from reality generating names**—\nwhen **names and reality are not deficient**, **essence resides within**.\nThus it is said:\n**When names are correct, reality arises from them**,\n**and reality arises from principle**.\n**Names are correct and naturally arise from reality**,\n**reality is established and naturally arises from principle**.\n**Principle arises from the virtue of names and reality**—\nif there is **no principle**, then **names and reality naturally generate virtue**.\n**Virtue arises from harmony**, and **harmony arises from correctness**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Names**\nThe sovereign who **names** must **align with reality**.\nThe treatises *Zhuàn Wán* and *Guāng Luàn* are **lost**.\nSome have **filled in the gaps with Zhuāng Zhou’s *Zhuàn Kuāng*** in sequence.\n**Note:** The *Ghost Valley Classic* **exalts stratagems and deceives sagely wisdom**.\nWhile **Zhuāng Zhou’s *Zhuàn Kuāng*** **portrays the sage as a tool for great

of *Yin-Fu* – Seven Chapters (Continued)**\n\n**Yin-Fu** is the private intention within, the response of things without.\nLike matching seals and contracts, hence it is called *Yin-Fu*.\nFrom its root to its unfolding, hence it is called the **Root Canon**.\nIt embodies the **Five Dragons**—the Dragons of the Five Phases.\nThe Dragon transforms without end, the **qi** is unfathomable in yin and yang—\nthus the **Way** of nurturing the **spirit** follows the Five Dragons.\n\nWithin nurturing the **spirit** are the Five **qi**:\nthe **spirit** is their sovereign,\nthe **heart** their dwelling,\n**virtue** their envoy.\nThe **Way** is where nurturing the **spirit** ultimately returns.\n\nThe Five **qi** are the **qi** of the Five Zang:\nthe **spirit**, the **hun**, the **po**, the **jing**, and the **zhi**.\nThe **spirit** dwells among the four others, hence it is their sovereign.\nThe **heart** can harmonize and contain, hence it is their dwelling.\n**Virtue** can subdue evil #1, hence it is their envoy #2.\nYet matters of nurturing should return to the **Way**.\n\nThe **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth,\nthe single thread of all things.\nIt is the source of all things, what heaven generates,\nencompassing boundless formless **qi**,\nexisting before heaven and earth,\nits form unseen, its name unknown—\nthus it is called **spirit-soul**.\nWithout name, it is the origin of heaven and earth.\nHence it is said: The **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth.\nThe **Way**’s initial generation is One,\nhence it is called the **single thread**.\nSpeaking of the **Way**’s mixed creation,\nhow yin and yang mold and refine—\nall things are born and transformed through it,\nheaven and earth generated by it,\nboundless and vast, its form unseen.\nAs for the **qi** of nurturing and growth,\nit precedes heaven and earth in formation,\ncannot be described by form or defined by name,\nyet it subtly permeates all things—\nthus it is called **spirit-soul**.\nTherefore, the **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**,\nthe single principle of transformation.\nThus **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.\n\nThe **heart** can attain the One,\nand thus its **wei** #4 arises.\n**Spirit-brightness** discerns the **Way** and is born—\nhence it is said: The **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**.\nIf the principle of transformation is not singular,\nthere are times when transformation does not occur—\nhence it is said: the **single principle of transformation**.\nFollowing principle to completion is called **virtue**.\nEach of the Five **qi** follows principle,\nand thus success can be achieved—\nhence it is said: **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.\n\nThe One is that which acts without action and is naturally so.\nThe **heart** can act without action,\nand its unfolding arises spontaneously—\nhence it is said: The **heart** attains the One,\nand thus its unfolding arises.\n\n**Wei** is the **Way** of the **heart’s qi**,\nthe path by which it dwells—\nthe **spirit** is its envoy.\nWhen the **heart’s qi** aligns with the natural **Way**,\nunfolding arises.\nThe unfolding’s **Way** comes from alignment #4—\nthus the **spirit** is its envoy.\n\nThe nine orifices and twelve dwellings are the gates and thresholds of **qi**,\nthe **heart’s** total governance.\nReceived from heaven at birth, it is called the **True Person**.\nThe **True Person** is one with heaven.\nThe twelve alignments are:\nthe eyes seeing color,\nthe ears hearing sound,\nthe nose receiving fragrance,\nthe tongue tasting flavor,\nthe body sensing touch,\nthe mind contemplating affairs—\nthe roots and fields mutually interpenetrating and aligning,\nhence called the twelve alignments.\n**Qi** enters and exits through them,\nhence they are the gates and thresholds of **qi**.\nOnly the **heart** governs them,\nhence they are the **heart’s** total governance.\nAll these are received from heaven,\nunspoiled in their original nature—\nhence it is called the **True Person**.\nThe **True Person**’s body is identical to heaven,\nhence it is said: one with heaven.\n\nYet those who know this internally refine and cultivate,\nand are called **Sages**.\nThe **Sage** knows by analogy.\nInternal refinement is learning through study—\nthough the **Sage** is wise, still relying on learning.\nLearning is not natural—\nhence it is said: knowing by analogy.\n\nThus, when people are born,\nthey all emerge from the transformation of things.\nSpeaking of people born together in heaven and earth,\nthey share the One.\nAfter emerging, they follow things and transform—\nthus they differ.\n\nKnowing by analogy at home,\nthere are doubts and confusions.\nThe orifices #5 pertain to the nine openings,\nyet their doubts also connect with unfolding.\nIf the **heart** lacks unfolding,\nthe **wei** is blocked.\nWhen it is unblocked,\nthe Five **qi** are nurtured—\nthe task is to dwell the **spirit**,\nthis is called transformation.\n\nWhen the **heart’s** unfolding is unblocked,\nthe Five **qi** are naturally nurtured.\nYet nurturing the Five **qi** requires\nthe **spirit** to return and dwell.\nWhen the **spirit** returns and aligns,\ntransformation follows principle naturally.\n\nThe Five **qi** of transformation are:\n**zhi**, **sī** #6, **spirit**, and **virtue**.\nThe **spirit** is their sovereign—\ncalm and harmonious, it nurtures **qi**.\nWhen **qi** is nurtured in harmony,\nthe four do not decay.\nTheir fourfold influence and power\nachieves all things.\nPreserving and dwelling them is called **spirit-transformation**.\nReturning to the body, it is called the **True Person**.\n\nSpeaking of those who can transform:\nit lies in perfecting the Five **qi**.\nThe **spirit** is their sovereign—\nspeaking of unifying **zhi** and **sī** to rule them.\nThe **spirit** being sovereign,\nit can be calm and harmonious, nurturing **qi**.\nWhen **qi** is nurtured,\n**virtue** is also harmonized.\nThe four are **zhi**, **sī**, **spirit**, and **virtue**.\nIf the four do not decay,\ntheir fourfold influence and power\nachieves all things.\nConstantly preserving and aligning them,\nthe **Way** of the **spirit** transforms and returns to the body.\nWhen **spirit-transformation** returns to the body,\nit is called the **True Person**.\n\nThe **True Person** aligns with heaven and harmonizes with the **Way**,\nholds the One to nurture all things,\nembracing the **heart** of heaven,\napplying **virtue** and nurturing—\nwithout action, encompassing all,\nusing **zhi**, **sī**, thought, and intention\nto wield influence and power.\n\nThe **scholar** is one whose **spirit** is fully awakened,\nthus able to nurture **zhi**.\nThe One is without action.\nSpeaking of the **True Person** nurturing all things,\nembracing the **heart** of heaven,\napplying **virtue** and nurturing—\nall done without action.\nHence it is said: holding the One to nurture all things.\nAs for **zhi**, thought, and intention,\nmoving influence and power—\nall are natural and follow principle.\nHence it is said: without action, encompassing all.\n\nYet who can fully grasp this **Way**?\nOnly the virtuous **scholar** can.\nHaving awakened the **spirit**,\nonly then can **zhi** be nurtured.\n\nNurturing the **zhi** follows the **Linggui** [灵龟].\n\n**Zhi** discerns right and wrong,\nwhile the **Linggui** foretells auspicious and inauspicious omens.\nHence it is said: nurturing **zhi** follows the **Linggui**.\n\nNurturing **zhi** means harmonizing and unifying,\nso that the **heart-qi**’s thoughts are unrestricted.\nIt is said: the **heart-qi** is unrestricted.\nThus, one must nurture **zhi** to seek unification.\n\nWhen there is desire, **zhi** is stored and pondered.\n**Zhi** is the guide of desire.\nIf desires multiply, **zhi** scatters;\nwhen **zhi** scatters, it becomes weak;\nwhen **zhi** weakens, thoughts are not realized.\nThis shows that those who indulge desires cannot nurture **qi** and **zhi**,\nand thus their thoughts are not realized.\n\nWhen the **heart-qi** is unified, desires do not overwhelm;\nwhen desires do not overwhelm, **zhi** and intention do not weaken;\nwhen **zhi** and intention do not weaken, thoughts reach their essence.\nThis shows that those with few desires can nurture their **zhi**,\nand thus their thoughts reach their essence.\n\nWhen essence is realized, harmony and unification arise,\nand turbulent **qi** does not vex the chest.\nHarmony and unification mean all things are attuned and unrestricted,\nso turbulent **qi** naturally dissipates.\n\nThus, internally one nurtures **qi**,\nexternally one knows others.\nNurturing **zhi** makes the **heart** unified,\nknowing others clarifies their roles.\nA unified **heart** brings tranquility to the self,\nclear roles bring peace to the world.\n\nTo employ others, one must first know their nurtured **qi** and **zhi**,\ndiscern their strengths and weaknesses to nurture their **qi** and **zhi**,\nand observe their comfort to know their capabilities.\nTo employ others is called the **Wei** [卫] of nurturing **zhi**.\n\nNurturing **zhi** strengthens **qi**,\nneglecting it weakens **qi**.\nWhen strength and weakness manifest,\ntheir comfort and capabilities become known.\n\nThus, those skilled in nurturing **zhi** are those with few desires.\nIf **zhi** is not nurtured, the **heart-qi** is not steadfast;\nif the **heart-qi** is not steadfast, thoughts are not realized;\nif thoughts are not realized, **zhi** and intention are not firm;\nif **zhi** and intention are not firm, responses lack vigor;\nif responses lack vigor, **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** becomes hollow;\nif **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** is hollow, the **spirit** is forfeited.\nThis shows that losing the **spirit** begins with failing to nurture **zhi**.\n\nWhen the **spirit** is lost, the hair and beard wither,\nand the convergence of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit** is disjointed.\nWithered hair and beard signify a lack of clarity.\nConvergence refers to the interplay of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit**.\nIf the **spirit** lacks clarity, errors multiply,\nand thus the three cannot align in unity.\n\nThe beginning of nurturing **zhi** lies in self-cultivation.\nWhen self is cultivated, **zhi** and intention become firm.\nWhen **zhi** and intention are firm, **virtue** and power are undivided.\n**Spirit** and clarity must be steadfastly guarded to divide them.\nCultivation means few desires and a tranquil **heart**.\n\nWhen **virtue** and power are not divided,\n**spirit** and clarity are ever-present and steadfast.\nThus, **virtue** is refined and power moves all things.\n**Virtue** refined means dispersion is lost,\npower moving means one’s **virtue** can influence others.\nHence it is said: only then can they be divided.\n\nFirm intention follows the **Tengshe** [腾蛇].\nIntention has twists and turns,\nwhile the **Tengshe** bends and stretches,\nhence firm intention follows the **Tengshe**.\n\nFirm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.\nWhen intention is firm, **qi** is balanced;\nwhen **qi** is balanced, contemplation is precise.\nThus it is said: firm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.\n\nThe **heart** desires tranquility,\ncontemplation desires depth.\nA tranquil **heart** honors **spirit** and clarity,\ndeep contemplation perfects strategies.\nWhen **spirit** and clarity are honored, **zhi** cannot be disordered;\nwhen strategies are perfected, achievements cannot be obstructed.\n**Zhi** cannot be disordered, so strategies are fulfilled.\nAchievements cannot be obstructed, so the realm is secured.\n\nWhen intention and contemplation are settled,\nthe **heart** naturally becomes tranquil,\nand all actions are without error.\nThe **spirit**, when obtained, becomes concentrated.\nWhen the **heart** is tranquil,\nthings act without effort and follow their nature,\nrequiring no thought yet perceiving the profound.\nThus, even if the **heart**’s actions are without error,\nthe **spirit** naturally attains it.\nWhen attained, nothing remains unaccomplished.\nConcentration means fulfillment.\n\nIf **qi** is lodged externally,\nthe deceitful gain leverage,\nand false schemes cause confusion,\nso words no longer emanate from the **heart**.\nLodged means guest lodging—**qi** is not genuine, only borrowed.\nThus, the deceitful gain leverage,\nand false schemes cause confusion.\nSo words become mere chest utterances, no longer from the **heart**.\n\nThus, one must uphold **heart**-methods,\nguard the **True One** without transformation,\nand await the convergence of others’ intentions and contemplations,\nlistening and observing them.\n\nIt is said: the **heart** guards sincerity and clarity without loss,\nthe **True One** is steadfast and unchanging.\nOnly then, when interfacing with others,\ndo sincere and earnest individuals fully express their intentions,\nthe wise offer their strategies,\nand the enlightened present their plans,\nso that all align in harmony.\n\nUsing the **heavenly ear** to listen,\none can discern the omens of things.\nStrategies are the pivot of life and death;\nif contemplation does not converge,\nlistening will not be precise.\nIf observation fails, strategies are lost,\nand intention finds nothing to rely on—\nonly emptiness remains, devoid of substance.\nStrategies succeed, life is preserved;\nstrategies fail, death ensues.\nHence it is said: strategies are the pivot of life and death.\n\nIf contemplation does not align with things,\nlistening serves no purpose.\nIf listening is not precise,\nhow can observation succeed?\nContradicting observation while scheming—\nwhat else is this but failure?\nIf strategies fail, on what can intention depend?\nOnly hollow pretense remains, no longer sincere.\n\nThus, the contemplation of strategies\nmust begin with firm intention.\nFirm intention originates from the **heart**’s **Wei** [卫].\nWithout action yet seeking,\ncultivating tranquility for the five **zang** [脏],\nharmonizing the six **fu** [腑],\nso that **spirit**, **shen**, **hun**, and **po** guard their domains unmoving,\none can then internally gaze and reflectively listen,\nsettling **zhi** in the boundless void,\nawaiting the **spirit**’s comings and goings.\n\nIt is said: to seek the way of tranquil **heart**,\none must be serene and without action.\nThus, the five **zang** are tranquil,\nthe six **fu** are harmonized,\n**spirit**, **shen**, **hun**, and **po** each guard their roles,\ncalm and unmoving,\nso one can internally perceive the formless\nand reflectively hear the soundless.\nWhen **zhi** and contemplation are settled,\nthe **Great Void** arrives,\nand myriad **spirits** and clarities converge upon oneself.\n\nThrough observing the unfolding of Heaven and Earth,\none knows the myriad things’ creation and transformation,\nsees the completion and origin of **Yin** and **Yang**,\nand grasps the principles of human affairs.\nWithout stepping outside, one knows the world;\nwithout peering through windows, one sees the **Dao** of Heaven.\nOne issues decrees unseen,\nand attains without movement.\n\nOnly the **spirit** does this—\nserene and unmoving,\nyet responsive and thus in harmony with the world’s essence.\nTo know what is unknown,\nto see what is unseen,\ndoes one truly need to step outside or peer through windows and doors?\nNo, for decrees are issued unseen,\nand attainment comes without movement.\n\nThis is called **Dao-knowing**,\nwhich harmonizes with **spirit** and **ming**,\nresponding to the boundless while the **spirit** abides.\n\nThe **Dao** is without thought,\nwithout action.\nYet **Dao-knowing**—\ndoes it require knowing to know?\nBecause it is without knowing,\nit can harmonize with **spirit** and **ming**,\nrespond to the boundless,\nand welcome the **spirit**’s arrival.\n\n**Abiding** is akin to **dwelling**.\nThe **Wei** [威] and **division** of **law** [法] subduing the bear:\n**Qi** [精] and **emptiness** [虚] moving creatures is called **Wei**,\nand **near** or **far** is called **division**.\n\nWhen the bear strikes,\nthe **spirit** first **dwells** and then moves,\nthus the **division** of **Wei** and **law** subdues the bear.\n**Wei** is the **spirit**’s **covering**—\n**covering**, like **garments** and **cloaks**.\nWhen **spirit** and **ming** are **cloaked** in stillness,\nthen their roles can be **divided**.\n\nThus, when one cultivates **serene** stillness and **firm** resolve,\nthe **spirit** returns to its **dwelling**,\nand the **Wei**’s **covering** flourishes.\nTo perfect the **spirit**’s return,\none must cultivate **serene** stillness and **firm** resolve,\nso that the **spirit**’s **Wei** and **covering** are grand and resplendent.\n\n**Dwelling** is the **abode** of resolve and intent.\nWhen **Wei** and **covering** are flourishing,\nthen the **inner substance** [内实] is firm.\nIf the **inner substance** is firm,\nthen nothing can oppose it.\n\n「If nothing opposes it,\nthen one can **divide** the **Wei** of others,\nand move their **effort** like the **Heavenly** [天].\nWhen **Wei** is flourishing externally,\nthen the **inner resolve** is firm and solid.\n**Form** and **covering** complement each other—\nwho dares oppose it?\nNo thing can oppose it.\nIf no thing can oppose it,\nthen the **Wei’s division** is complete.\n\nWhen **Wei’s division** moves,\nthen all things stand in solemn reverence,\nfearing the person as if they were **Heavenly**.\nTo grasp the **real** and discard the **empty**,\nto take the **possessed** and leave the **void**,\nis like weighing **pearls** with a **standard measure**.\nWhen **Wei** and **effort** are grand and resplendent,\nand figures stand in solemn reverence,\nit means I am **real and possessed** while they are **empty and void**.\nThus, one can take their **empty** with my **real**,\nand leave their **void** with my **possessed**.\nThe **taking** [取] is like the **moving of the stalks** [动爻] in response—\njust as weighing **pearls** completes the **standard measure**.\nTwenty-four **candareens** [铢] make one **standard measure** [镒].\nThus, the **moved** must follow,\nthe **sung** must harmonize.\n**Twist** one finger,\nobserve the rest—\nwhen the **moving** and **changing** appear in **form**,\nno one can intervene.\nWhen **Wei’s division** and **effort** shake things like the **wind**,\nthen the **moved** has **followers**,\nand the **sung** has **harmonizers**.\nBut **twist** their fingers,\nand call them by name,\nthen the **Wei** and **things** all arrive,\ngradually in order,\nlike **calming nature** [性安],\neach allowed to find its place.\n\nThus, the **wind** moves them,\nthe **changing** transforms them—\nlike clay in the potter’s hands,\nthe **Wei** and **instruments** of **things** reveal their **forms**.\nSo, the world rejoices,\nand it is **pushed** without **satiation**,\nwho could **question** it?\nTo **examine** the **harmonizing** and **responding**,\nand **question** reveals the **question**—\nwhen the **moving** and **changing** are clear,\nthen **Wei** can be **divided**.\n\nWhen one **examines** the **harmonizing** and **responding**,\nand **knows** the **question**,\nthen one can **question**—\nthus, one can **clearly** move and change,\nand **Wei** can be **divided**.\nBefore **moving** and **changing**,\none must first **nurture resolve**,\nand **conceal intent** to observe the **question**.\nOnce able to **nurture resolve**,\nand **conceal intent** to see the **question**,\nthen the **unfolding** of **moving** and **changing** can be achieved.\n\n**Knowing** their **fixed resolve** is self-**nurturing**,\n**yielding** to others is **nurturing** others.\nThus, **spirit** remains **internal** while **effort** is **external**,\nand **form** and **effort** can be established.\nThis is like the **method of dispersing effort** to startle the **crow** [乌].\n**Effort** is dispersed only after **things** submit—\njust as the **crow** strikes prey and gains.\n\nThus, **dispersing effort** is the **spirit’s deployment**.\n**Effort** arises from the **spirit’s** movement,\nso **effort** is the **spirit’s** deployment.\nWhen used,\nit must follow the **question** to move.\nWithout the **question**,\n**effort** cannot proceed—\nthus, when used,\nit must also follow the **question** to move.\nWhen **Wei** is solemn and **internal resolve** is resplendent,\nand it is **pushed** through the **question**,\nthen **effort** is dispersed.\n\n**Dispersing effort** is when the **heart** is **empty** and **resolve** overflows.\nIf the **heart** is **empty**,\nthen **things** are all **encompassed**;\nif **resolve** overflows,\nthen **matters** proceed without **obstruction**—\nthus, one can disperse **effort**.\nWhen **intent** is lost to **Wei** and **effort**,\n**spirit** is not **concentrated**,\nthen their **words** are **external** and **deceptive** in **change**.\nIf **resolve** and **intent** are **weakened** and **lost**,\nthen **effort** is **defeated**;\nif **spirit** is **damaged** and **unfocused**,\nthen **words** are **loose** and **deceptive** in **change**.\n\nThus, **observe** their **resolve** and **intent** as **measurements** [度数],\nthen **infer** and **explain** their **plans** and **matters**.\n**Measurements** are fully **rounded** and **square**,\n**leveling** the **short** and **long**.\n**Know** their **resolve** and **intent** as **ascending** or **declining**,\nthen one can establish the **measurements**.\nOnce the **measurements** are set,\nthen one can **infer** and **explain** them.\nTo **map** their **matters**,\none must also **fulfill** the **logic of roundness** and **squareness**,\nand **harmonize** the **uses of short** and **long**.\nWithout **measurements**,\n**effort** cannot be dispersed.\n**Dispersing effort** is waiting for the **question** to move—\nwhen **effort** moves,\nit is **divided**.\nIf **effort** cannot **observe** the **question**,\nthen it does not proceed.\nThus, **dispersing effort** is waiting for the **opportunity** to move.\nWhen it moves and **obtains** the **question**,\nthen **effort** is **divided**.\n\nTherefore, those skilled in **thinking through the question**,\nmust **refine** the **Five Qi** [五气] **internally**,\nand **observe** the **empty** and **real** **externally**—\nwhen they move,\nthey do not lose the **truth** of **division** and **dispersion**.\nThe **Five Qi** must be **refined internally**,\nthen one can **externally** **discern**.\nIf the **logic of empty** and **real** is not **lost**,\nthen the **question** can also be **known**.\nIf there is a **question** and one **knows** it,\nthen one can **not lose** the **truth** of **division** and **dispersion**.\n\nWhen one moves,\nthey follow their **resolve** and **intent**,\nand **know** their **strategies** and **plots**.\n**Strategies** and **plots** are the **forms** of **resolve** and **intent**,\nso one follows their **resolve** and **intent** to **know** their **strategies**.\n\n**Effort** is the **pivot** of **benefit** and **harm**,\nthe **Wei** of **strategic adaptation**.\nThe **defeated in effort** are those who do not **solemnly observe** with **spirit**.\nIf **spirit** does not **solemnly observe**,\nthen **effort** is **defeated**.\nThe **method of turning roundness** is like the **fierce beast**.\nWhen **strategies** are **endless** and **unfathomable**,\nthey are like the **fierce beast**.\n\n**Turning roundness** is when **matters** arrive,\nlike the **endless roundness** of turning.\n**Turning** is like the **unending威** of beasts.\n**Turning roundness** is the **method** of **unfathomable strategies**.\nThe **unfathomable** **heart** and **unmeasurable** **mind**,\nwith **original** and **unfathomable** **techniques**—\nthe **sage’s heart** is like a **mirror**,\n**things** respond as they are **sensed**,\nso the **unfathomable** **mind** and **techniques** of the **heart’s unfolding** can be **communicated**.\n\nYet, the **Dao/Way** of **spirit** is **mixed and indistinct** as one **principle** without **end**.\nTo **discuss** the **ten thousand variations** of **meaning**,\nonce the **sage’s heart** **originally** **unfathomably** **mixes** the **indistinct**,\nand **wonders** at **things** in **dimness** and **change**,\nthen the **unfathomable** **meaning** can be **explained**.\n**Wisdom** and **strategies**, **plots** and **calculations**,\neach have **manifestations**—\neither **yang** or **yin**,\neither **auspicious** or **inauspicious**,\neither **fortune** or **misfortune**.\nThere must be a **sage** with **unfathomable wisdom** to **communicate**,\nto **unfold** the **heart’s intentions**—\nthus, even in the **Dao/Way** of **spirit**,\none can **categorize** its **ten thousand types**,\nwhether **round** or **square**,\nas **matters** differ,\nthen **plots** arise.\nWhen **plots** arise,\neither **yin** or **yang**,\nthen **matters** are **settled**.\n**Matters** have no **fixed standard**,\nso their **manifestations** differ—\nthe **round** **operates** endlessly without **division**,\nthe **square** **stops** with **boundaries**,\n**yin** means **plots** are **hidden** and **not yet revealed**,\n**yang** means **actions** are **manifest** and **clear**,\n**auspicious** means **blessing** arrives,\n**inauspicious** means **calamity** comes.\nAll these **matters** are **reversible**.\nThus, the **sage** **embraces** this **use**,\n**turning roundness** to seek its **harmony**.」\n\nThus, the **sage** follows the **Dao/Way** of **turning roundness** in thought,\nto seek **harmony** and **fluidity** in **alignment**.\n\nTherefore, the **origin** of **nurturing** and **transforming** is **creation**,\nand all **movement** and **action** encompass the **Great Dao/Way**,\nto **observe** the **domain of the numinous and luminous**.\n\nThe **sage** embodies the **Dao/Way**,\nusing **movement** as **function**,\nand **spirit** as its **attendant**.\n\n**Heaven** thus **nurtures** and **transforms** through **teachings** and **cultivation**,\nits **movement** and **action** first **aligning** with the **principles** of the **Great Dao/Way**,\nto **verify** the **domain of the numinous and luminous**.\nWhen the **Dao/Way of spirit** is **unobstructed**,\nthen **commands** and **orders** are **issued**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** are **boundless**,\n**human affairs** are **endless**,\neach **fulfilling** its **kind**—\nwhen one **observes** their **plans**,\none **knows** the **termination** of **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness**,\n**success** and **failure**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** endure **longevity** and **duration**,\nthus they are **boundless**.\n**Human affairs** generate **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness** in **sequence**,\nthus they are **endless**.\n**Heaven and Earth** **achieve** **completion** through the **sun and moon** never **transgressing**,\nand **mountains and valleys** never **shifting**,\nwhile **human affairs** **achieve** **completion** through **long preservation** of **primordial **virtue/power** and **prosperity**,\nand **verifying** the **fulfillment** of their **destiny**.\n\nThus, when one **observes** the **gain or loss** of their **plans**,\nthe **termination** of **auspiciousness**, **inauspiciousness**, **success**, and **failure** can all be **known**.\n\n**Turning roundness**—\nsometimes it **turns** to **auspiciousness**,\nsometimes it **turns** to **inauspiciousness**.\nThe **sage**, through the **Dao/Way**, **foreknows** **life and death**,\nand thus **knows** to **turn roundness** and **follow squareness**.\n\nSince **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness** have no **fixed standard**,\none **selects** **categories** and **turns roundness**.\nYet the **sage**, through **sitting-forgetting** and **abandoning mirrors**,\n**embodies** **harmony** with the **Dao/Way**,\nand thus **foreknows** where **life and death** reside,\nonly then **turning roundness** and **following squareness**,\n**discarding inauspiciousness** and **following auspiciousness**.\n\n**Squareness** refers to where **life and death** reside.\n**Roundness** is for **harmonizing speech**,\n**squareness** is for **arranging affairs**,\n**transformation** is for **observing plans**,\nand **interacting with others** is for **observing intentions** of **advance and retreat**.\n\n**Roundness** **flows** and **adapts** without **exhaustion**,\nthus it can **harmonize** the **speech** of **others**.\n**Squareness** **divides** and **fixes** its **positions**,\nthus it can **arrange** **affairs** of **action**.\n**Transformation** **converts** **calamity** into **blessing**,\nthus it can **observe** the **gain or loss** of **plans**.\n**Interacting with others** **aligns** with **human nature**,\nthus it can **observe** the **intentions** of **advance and retreat**,\nand **matters of right and wrong**.\n\nAll these **meetings** are then **summarized** as **essential conclusions**,\nto **connect** their **discourses**.\n\nThis refers to the **four above**—\nwhen their **meetings** and **transformations** are **seen**,\nthen their **principles** and **essentials** are **summarized** and **concluded**,\nand the **discourses** of **emotion and deception** can be **fully connected**.\n\n**Diminishing and Perceiving** follow the **method of the numinous**.\n\n**Laozi** said: **\"Block its perceiving.\"**\n**River-Up Master** said: **\"Perceiving is the eye.\"**\n**Zhuangzi** said: **\"The heart has an eye.\"**\nThus, **perceiving** refers to **discerning principles** with the **heart’s eye**.\n\n**Diminishing** refers to **suppressing other thoughts** and **focusing** the **heart** to **perceive**.\n\n**Perceiving** can **know gain and loss**,\n**action** can **know rest and response**,\nthus the **method of diminishing and perceiving** follows the **numinous**.\n\n**Diminishing and perceiving** are the **critical moments** of **peril**.\nThe **principles of peril**—\nthe **subtle stirrings** of **omen**—\ncannot be **seen** without the **heart’s eye**.\n\nThus it is said:\n**\"Diminishing and perceiving\"** are the **sequels to peril**.\n**Affairs** have their **natural occurrences**,\n**things** have their **successes and failures**,\nand the **stirrings of peril** range from **subtle to manifest**.\nIf one does not **adapt emotions** and **distance the heart**,\n**knowing omens** and **penetrating mysteries**,\nthen one cannot **know** before **omens appear**,\nor **discern** before **forms take shape**.\n\nIf **winds and waves** **seethe** in **hidden terror**,\nand **perilous moments** **erupt** in **secrecy**,\nthen even the **vastness of rivers and seas** becomes a **dried-up stream**,\nand a **single sigh’s accumulation** piles into **mountains**.\nIf one does not **plan at the beginning**,\neven **regret** has **nowhere to turn**.\n\nThus it is said: **\"It cannot be neglected.\"**\n\nTherefore, the **sage** **waits idly** with **non-action** for the **virtuous**,\nspeaking of **discerning words** in **alignment** with **affairs**.\n\nThe **sage** is **diligent** in **seeking the worthy**,\n**meticulous** in **assigning tasks**.\nThus, **upright and at ease**, he **waits idly** with **non-action** for the **virtuous**.\n\nWhen the **worthy arrive**,\nthey **unfold** and **perform** with **speech**.\nThus it is said: **\"Discerning words.\"**\nAgain, **testing clearly** with **deeds**,\nthus it is said: **\"In alignment with affairs.\"**\n\n**Perceiving** is **knowing**,\n**diminishing** is **acting**.\nUsing the **heart’s eye**, one can **know**.\nSuppressing other thoughts, one can **act**.\n\nWhen **diminishing** is **applied** to **speech**,\nif **things** are **unacceptable**,\nthe **sage** does not **craft arguments**.\n\nSpeaking of **diminishing** and its **discourse**,\nand the **things** to which it is **applied**,\nif **principles** are **not universally valid**,\nthe **sage** does not **generate words** to **debate**.\n\nThus, the **wise** do not **lose others’ words** through **their own speech**,\nso **words** are **unburdened** and the **heart** is **unstrained**,\n**resolve** is **unconfused** and **intent** is **unerring**.\n\nThe **wise**, when **hearing disputes** among **common folk**,\n**gather** the **speech** of **cutters of grass and carriers of firewood**.\nThough **elaborately reasoned**,\n**all things** do not **explain themselves**.\n\nThus, they do not **abandon others’ words** because of their **own abilities**.\nSince there are **many words**,\n**speech** is **appropriate** and **unburdened**,\nreturning to **trust the hearts** of **many**,\nso the **heart** is **sincere** and **unfeigned**.\nWhen the **heart** is **sincere** and **speech** is **appropriate**,\nhow could **resolve** and **intent** be **confused**?\n\nWhen **difficulties and ease** are **judged**,\nthen **plans** are **made**.\n**Natural principles** are taken as **substance**.\n**Affairs** are **lost** and then **life** is **planned**,\n**constants** are **changed** and then **calculations** **arise**.\n\nThus, when the **heart** **judges** the **junctions** of **difficulty and ease**,\nthen **plans** are **made**.\nIf **plans** **lose** the **Natural Way**,\nthen **affairs** **fail** and **achievements** **crumble**.\n\nThus, **lines** **follow** the **Natural Way**,\ntaking it as the **substance** for **planning**.\n\n**Roundness** does not **act**,\n**squareness** does not **stop**—\nthis is called **great achievement**.\n\n**Benefiting** and **diminishing** are all **crafted in speech** to **debate** their **gain or loss**.\n\nThe **subtlety of planning** lies in its ability\nto **convert calamity into blessing**,\nto **achieve success** from **failure**,\nand to **pursue** the **other** to **complete oneself**.\n\nIf the **other** uses **roundness** in **planning**,\nmy **orders** **do not proceed**.\nIf the **other** uses **squareness** in **planning**,\nmy **orders** **do not halt**.\n\nYet **roundness proceeds** and **squareness stops**—\nthis is the **constant principle**.\nWhen my **plans** are **launched**,\nthe **other** **loses its constant**—\nhow could this not be **great achievement**?\n\nAs for **planning’s gains and losses**,\nall are **crafted in speech** to **debate** their **merits**.\n\nUsing the **authority** to **divide threats** and **scatter influence**,\nto **reveal perceiving**—\nwhen **peril’s mechanisms** are **dangerous**, this is its **sequence**.\n\nWhat enables one to **divide threats** and **scatter influence**\nis the **function** of the **heart’s eye**.\nWhen the **heart’s eye** is **clear**,\nthe **threats of perilous mechanisms** can be **known**.\n\nOnce known, then one can arrange it accordingly.\nThus, those skilled in diminishing *yú* [perceiving] are like\nunleashing water from a thousand-*rèn* [fathom] dam,\nrolling round boulders down a ten-thousand-*rèn* gorge.\nYet those who can execute this—\ntheir form and circumstances leave no alternative.\n\nSpeaking of those skilled in curbing deliberation to focus the *heart’s eye*,\nthey perceive events clearly, grasp principles distinctly,\ntheir intent follows order without doubt,\ntheir resolve is mighty yet unobstructed—\nlike controlling water or rolling stones,\nwho could withstand their command?\n\n**Holding the Pivot.**\nThe Pivot—\nresiding centrally to govern the outer,\ndwelling near to control the distant,\nmastering movement—\nis the essence of turning.\n\nThus, the celestial North Star is called the Celestial Pivot,\nthe turning hinge of a door is called the Door Pivot.\nTherefore, to *hold the Pivot*\nis to wield the handle of motion to govern things.\n\n*Holding the Pivot* means:\nspring generates, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores—\nthe natural order of Heaven.\nThe four seasons move naturally without contrivance—\nthis is what makes it the *constant*.\n\nDo not forcibly disrupt or reverse it;\nthose who do, though they succeed, must fail.\nWhat Heaven’s principles naturally embrace,\nif left undisturbed and in harmony,\nthe four seasons proceed, all things flourish.\nYet if one disrupts the seasons, defies the *qi* and climate,\neven success turns to ruin—what of those who fail?\n\nYuan Liang said:\nAll beings with *qi* rejoice when obeyed,\nrage when defied—\nhow much more so Heaven, sovereign over all things,\nwhen it is defied?\n\nThus, the sovereign too has the Celestial Pivot of generation, nurturing, completion, and storage.\nThe sovereign follows Heaven’s movement,\nso too does the sovereign have the Celestial Pivot.\nYet its generation, nurturing, completion, and storage\nare the unfolding of Heaven’s *dao*—\nthe proper order of human affairs,\nno different in essence.\n\nYet still, do not forcibly disrupt or reverse it.\nTo do so, though one flourishes, must decline—\nthis is the grand framework of Heaven’s *dao* and the sovereign’s rule.\nTo disrupt Heaven’s course, to reverse human propriety—\nthis is inversion.\n\nThus it is said:\nIf not *yi* [rightness], what is the *Dao*?\n\nThis section on *holding the Pivot* is too brief,\nits principles not fully expounded—\nperhaps the text is incomplete or lost.\n\n**Central Thread.**\nThe Central Thread—\noriginating from within, extending outward through the heart,\nrooted in mending what is external.\n\nThus it is said: *Central Thread.*\nThe *Central Thread* means:\nreviving the desperate, aiding the urgent,\napplying aid to those who can speak,\nthe virtuous saving things while the constrained do not forget gratitude.\n*Reviving*—to uplift;\n*Trending*—to turn toward.\nWhen things are desperate and urgent,\none must uplift and turn to protect them—\nthis is their aid.\nAnd it lies with those who can speak,\nthose of profound virtue.\n\nIf they can rescue the constrained,\nthe desperate will forever harbor gratitude.\nThose who can speak—\ntheir kind are benevolent and widely generous.\n*Kind*—of the same class.\nThose who can speak resolve disputes, save crises,\nyet do not lose their virtuous nature,\nwhile broadly extending kindness.\n\nThose who practice virtue act in accordance with the *Dao*.\nTo say those who practice virtue act rightly—\ntheir deeds never stray from the *Dao*.\n\nYet to rescue the constrained is to nurture the petty.\nThe petty, when constrained, can be made governable.\nIn times of shifting circumstances,\nthe scholar may:\nsometimes avert disaster through strategic retreat,\nsometimes strike down those who harm the virtuous,\nsometimes break virtue to assert dominance,\nsometimes suppress the constrained to form crime,\nsometimes mournfully uphold goodness,\nsometimes rise from ruin to establish oneself.\n\n*Strategic retreat*—when war looms, turning to avoid destruction.\nThe scholar may have cause to avert such calamity.\n*Strike down those who harm the virtuous*—\nthe petty’s way is slander without end,\nso those who can speak often suffer slaughter.\n*Break virtue to assert dominance*—\ndestroying cultural refinement, glorifying war.\n*Suppress the constrained to form crime*—\nwhen one’s merit is unrecognized, they are falsely ensnared.\n*Mournfully uphold goodness*—\nwhen the world is chaotic, without order,\nthe virtuous cling to death-defying integrity,\ntheir true hearts untainted—\nas the pine and cypress endure only in winter’s severity.\n\n*Rise from ruin to establish oneself*—\nwhen Heaven does not repent disaster,\ndanger and ruin follow in succession,\nthe noble, though impoverished, remain uncorrupted,\nand ultimately establish themselves—\nas did Guan Zhong.\n\nThus, the *Dao* values governing others,\nnot being governed by others.\nTo govern others is to grasp authority;\nto be governed by others is to lose one’s life.\nIt is noble to have surplus power to govern others,\nnot noble to lack defense and be governed by others.\n\nHence:\nobserve form to discern appearance,\nmirror the body to perceive countenance,\nlisten to tone to harmonize sound,\nunravel enmity through gaps,\nweave and sever words,\nconsolidate the heart to uphold *yi* [rightness].\n\nThis summarizes the overview;\nthe details follow below.\n\nThe *Classic* records events,\ncounting the *Dao*’s transformations—\nits essence lies in *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*.\n\nThis summarizes the *Classic*’s meaning of *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*,\nsaying the *Classic*’s records merely enumerate the *Dao*’s shifts.\nAs for the key to adaptability,\nit lies in *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*.\n\n*Observe form to discern appearance, mirror the body to perceive countenance*—\nthis is the *yáo* [stems] generating them.\nSeeing another’s form and mirroring their body,\none knows their appearance—\nthis is divination through *yáo* and *guà* [hexagrams].\nOne can influence appearance and countenance to discern them.\nThis means those without principle\ncan be influenced by appearance and countenance to be divined.\n\nYet those with principle—\ntheir eyes do not gaze at what is improper,\ntheir ears do not listen to deceit,\ntheir speech is grounded in the *Odes* and *Documents*,\ntheir conduct is not perverse or licentious,\nthey embody the *Dao* in form,\nlisten with propriety in appearance,\ntheir demeanor is dignified, their color serene—\nthey cannot be discerned through appearance or countenance.\nThus, their emotions are concealed,\ntheir intentions sealed,\nand they depart unseen.\n\nThose with principle act with unwavering rectitude,\ntheir actions are never perverse or licentious,\nand later flourish,\ntheir radiance ever renewed.\nEven with the tongues of deceitful scholars,\nthere is no way to expose them.\nThus, their emotions remain hidden,\ntheir intentions sealed and stored away.\n\nHearing voices and harmonizing sounds—\nwhen *qi* and tone differ,\nfavor and response do not align.\n\nThus, *shang* and *jiao* are not paired,\n*zheng* and *yu* do not combine.\n*Shang* is metal, *jiao* wood,\n*zheng* fire, *yu* water—\neach in turn restrains and consumes the other,\ntheir natures and *qi* discordant,\nso they do not harmonize.\n\nOnly *gong* can master the four tones.\n*Gong* is earth, earth governs the four seasons.\nFrom these four seasons all things arise,\nthus *gong* is master of the four tones.\n\nWhen sounds are not harmonized,\nthey bring neither sorrow nor blame.\nThose who scatter injury and ugliness with sound\nmust speak what offends the ear.\nScattered injury and ugliness—\nthese are the discordant tones.\nWhen *qi* and sound are not in harmony,\nthey clash with what is proper,\nso it is said their clash offends the ear.\n\nEven with virtuous conduct and great renown,\nthey cannot pair like *bìmù* fish or *héyì* birds,\nmutually relying on one another.\nThis is because their *qi* does not align,\ntheir tones are not attuned.\n\nWho can make two seek response\nwithout sharing the same *qi*?\n\nTo resolve enmity and fill deficiencies—\nthis means resolving the weak and feeble’s grudges.\nThe executioner is the deficient one,\nthe strong are the deficient.\nThe art of persuasion is like drawing a bow:\nthe high are lowered, the low are raised.\nThus, the weak and feeble become enemies,\nand are resolved.\nThe strong are the deficient,\nand are filled.\n\nOnce the deficient are filled,\nthe victorious exalt their deeds,\nmagnify their power.\nThe filled and magnified—\ntheir deeds are exalted,\ntheir power magnified.\n\nThe weak lament their failures,\ngrieve their lowliness,\nspread their names in shame,\nbring dishonor to their lineage.\nThe weak, when lamented,\nare moved to double their strength,\nto die in service.\n\nIf there is no extreme might,\nno overwhelming force,\nthen all may be coerced and united.\nThough they are the deficient,\nthey lack neither strength nor mastery.\nThus, with military might,\nthey are compelled to submit and unite.\n\nTo linger after departure—\nthis means prolonging one’s striking words,\nleaving room for further thought.\n*Ji*—to bind—\nto bind the words of those who have gone,\nso that later reflection aligns with them.\n\nThus, those who are sincere and trustworthy\nare praised for their conduct,\ntheir resolve strengthened.\nTheir deeds are said to be both enduring and repayable,\ntheir meeting marked by joy.\nTo order them to think again after departure,\npraise their noble conduct,\nstrengthen their resolve,\nso they do not grow slack.\nThese noble deeds—\ntheir virtue is constant,\ntheir repayments assured.\nTheir meeting is harmonious,\nand they are filled with joy.\n\nUsing others’ minor virtues as proof\nto bind the past,\nclarifying doubts with sincerity before departing.\nHaving praised their conduct and strengthened their resolve,\nthen using others who nearly match them as proof,\nto bind the past intentions,\nand to clarify one’s own sincere doubts.\nThus, when departing,\nthey will think of you and not forget.\n\nTo retreat with words—\nthis means observing their flaws.\nThe art of retreat with words\nis to observe their shortcomings.\nThus, speech is bound to have flaws,\nand their flaws are recorded for verification.\nSpeech cannot be without flaws,\nonce their flaws are known,\nthey are remembered for verification.\n\nAct with taboos,\ndemonstrate timely prohibitions.\nHaving observed their flaws,\nuse taboos to move them,\ndemonstrate prohibitions in season,\nso they harbor fear.\nThen bind them with sincerity to calm their hearts,\nconceal their words and withdraw.\n\nWhen their words were once advantageous but are now withdrawn,\ntheir gratitude and awe will be deep.\n\nDo not reveal your limitations before many.\nHaving concealed your words,\nwarn them: *\"Do not, before many, reveal what you cannot do.\"*\n\nTo gather the heart—\nwhen encountering those who love learning and rely on skill,\npraise their distant reputation.\nTo gather their hearts,\nseeing they love learning and rely on skill,\ncreate a reputation for them,\nso that near and far know of it.\n\nThe method of verification—\nstartle them with the strange,\nso their hearts attach to you.\nHaving created their reputation,\nthen verify their reliance,\nand with the strange startle them.\nThus, their hearts will attach to you.\n\nTo emulate them—\nverify past chaos,\nreturn sincerity to them.\nTheir hearts already attached,\nthen emulate them before others,\nverify them with past sages,\nthen rectify their past actions,\nsaying: *\"This is why I act thus—\nmy sincerity is for them.\"*\n\nTo encounter those ensnared by lust and wine—\nuse music to move them,\nsaying they will surely die,\nthat their days are few.\nTo gather the hearts of the foolish,\nseeing those ensnared by lust and wine,\nmusic can persuade.\nAnd with excess in wine and lust,\nlead them to the brink of death,\nsaying their days are few.\nWith these worrisome matters,\nmove them.\n\nDelight them with what they have not seen,\nso they may finally observe the vast and boundless fate,\nand meet again later.\n\nAgain, delight them with music—\nthings they have never seen,\nso that, in the end, they may observe what is boundless.\nYet, how can they be led astray by wine and lust?\n\nIf they can take pleasure in this,\nthen their life and fate will flow boundlessly and without end,\nand they will meet again in eternal years.\n\nThe foolish cannot be swayed by the Dao/Way—\nthus, music is used to capture their hearts.\n\nThose who uphold **righteousness** (*yì*)—\n**righteousness** means what is fitting.\nTo explore the heart is to probe within,\nto harmonize with others.\nExploring the heart means attaining their essence,\nguiding from without to within,\nfor all things have their natural inclinations and follow accordingly.\nOnce their hearts are known,\nthen the essence is deeply attained.\nWith their hearts deeply understood,\none can guide from without to within.\nIf the inner is controlled by me,\nthen what matter cannot be accomplished?\nThus, all things have their proper place,\nnone failing to follow as intended.\n\nHence, the petty (*xiǎorén*) compare themselves to the virtuous,\nusing **deviant arts** (*zuǒdào*) to manipulate them,\neven to the point of ruining families and seizing states.\nThe petty, through probing the heart,\ncompare themselves to the virtuous,\nusing **deviant arts** to wield power.\nAll matters not of **public virtue** (*gōngzhéng*) are called petty.\nThey invert the Dao/Way and disrupt the norms,\nharm the virtuous and attack the good.\nTheir methods are **deviant** (*zuǒ*), their opposition is **public** (*gōng*).\nA hundred blessings become chaos,\nten thousand affairs fall into disarray,\nfamilies are shattered, states are lost—\nis this not fitting?\n\nOnly the virtuous and wise can guard their families with **righteousness** (*yì*)\nand guard their states with the Dao/Way.\nThe sage values the subtle and wondrous Dao/Way,\nfor it can transform peril into safety,\nrescue the lost and bring them to preservation.\n\nThe Dao/Way—\nthis refers to the **central path** (*zhōngjīng*) of the Dao/Way.\n\n*(Ghost Valley Master Scroll, Part II concludes.)*",

Shuaihé (Disrupting and Concealing)**\n*Shuai* means to agitate or unsettle.\n*Hé* means to conceal or withdraw.\n\nWhen engaging with others in discourse, one may either **agitate them**, prompting them to reveal their alignment, or **conceal them**, prompting them to reveal their divergence.\n\n**If one examines antiquity**, the Sage, when questioning the cosmos, followed (*ruò*) and considered (*qǐ*) the ancient Dao, teaching accordingly.\n\nThe Sage, as the first among all beings, emerged before all things, using **prior knowledge to enlighten the unknowing**, and **prior enlightenment to awaken the unenlightened**. Thus, the Sage is first among all beings.\n\nObserving the **opening and closing of Yin and Yang**, the Sage named and commanded all things.\nYang opens to generate life; Yin closes to complete it.\nOnce generation and completion are established, names must be assigned to them.\n\nKnowing the **gates of existence and annihilation**—\nDo not forget that those who perish are those who exist, and those who exist are those who perish.\nOnly those who perceive the **omens of fortune and misfortune beforehand** truly grasp the *machine* (critical junctures).\n\nThus it is said: **\"Know the gates of existence and annihilation.\"**\n\nCalculating the **termination and origin of all things**, penetrating the logic of human hearts, and perceiving the **portents of transformation**—\nThe termination and origin of all things, the logic of human hearts, and the portents of transformation are all clearly manifest. Through profound insight, nothing remains obscure or unmeasured. Thus, one can calculate, penetrate, and perceive.\n\n*Zhèn* (portents) means **sudden emergence**.\n\nAnd one **guards and oversees these gates**—\n*Shǐ* means to **maintain and govern**.\nThe gates refer to the **gates of existence and annihilation** mentioned above.\n\nHaving penetrated the principles of things, knowing the termination and origin of existence and annihilation, the Sage guards and oversees them, ensuring all turn away from annihilation and toward existence.\n\nThus, the Sage’s Dao in the world, from ancient times to today, remains **one**.\n\nThough all turn away from annihilation and toward existence, the Dao is one.\n\n**Transformation is boundless**, yet all things return to their proper place.\nThough the Dao is one, its practice varies, hence **transformation is boundless**. Yet it remains orderly, hence **all things return to their proper place**.\n\nSometimes **Yin**, sometimes **Yang**; sometimes **soft**, sometimes **hard**; sometimes **open**, sometimes **closed**; sometimes **relaxed**, sometimes **tense**.\nThese two aspects—**law and symbol**—differ in form, and their teachings vary accordingly.\n\nThus, the Sage, though **one in guarding and overseeing the gates**, must **carefully examine what comes first or last**!\nThough governance may differ, in guarding and overseeing the gates, the Sage remains consistent. Therefore, one must carefully examine what should be prioritized and what should follow.\n\n**Measuring ability and assessing skill**, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.\n*Quán* refers to **strategic calculation**; *néng* refers to **inherent ability**; *zhàngqiǎo* refers to **artisan craftsmanship**.\n\nThe Sage, in employing people, measures their **strategic acumen and abilities**, assesses their **craftsmanship and skill**, and then assigns them accordingly.\n\nAmong the **virtuous and unvirtuous, the wise and foolish, the brave and cowardly, the benevolent and righteous**, there are differences. Thus, one may:\n- **Agitate** the virtuous to align them,\n- **Conceal** the unvirtuous to reveal their divergence,\n- **Advance** the wise and brave to honor them,\n- **Retreat** the foolish and cowardly to degrade them,\n- **Elevate** or **debase** them as needed,\nYet **do nothing** (*wuwei*) and **shepherd them with humility**.\n\nThe virtuous and foolish each fulfill their roles; ministers and officials exert their strengths. The only requirement is **humility and non-action** in guiding them.\n\n**Carefully determine presence and absence** to discern their **substance and emptiness**, and **follow their desires** to reveal their **intentions**.\nIn employing the worthy, one must first **carefully determine their substance and emptiness**, their **honesty and deceit**, then follow their desires to discern their **true intentions**.\n\n**Subtly challenge their words** and turn them back upon themselves to seek the truth, valuing **obtaining their alignment through agitation** to seek their advantage.\nWhen others speak, one must **subtly challenge and invert their words**, agitating them to reveal their true sentiments. Once the truth is obtained, one may **conceal and agitate them further**, prompting them to seek the **advantage of their own words**.\n\nSometimes **open and reveal**, sometimes **conceal and close**.\nOpening and revealing aligns their sentiments; concealing and closing reveals their sincerity.\nOpening aligns to **exhaust their sentiments**; concealing diverges to **test their sincerity**.\n\n**What is permissible and what is not**—carefully examine their strategies to **trace their alignment or divergence**.\nIn all speech, what is permissible and what is not must be **clearly examined**, their strategies scrutinized to **determine their true alignment or divergence**.\n\n**Unity and separation have their principles**; first, follow their intentions.\nThough strategies may vary in unity or separation, if one **holds fast to principle**, they may first follow their intentions to **fulfill them**, thereby knowing the **outcome of success or failure**.\n\nIf one seeks to **agitate**, **thoroughness is paramount**; if one seeks to **conceal**, **secrecy is paramount**.\nThe value of **thoroughness and secrecy** lies in their subtlety, aligning with the Dao.\n\nAgitation **probes their sentiments**; concealment **binds their sincerity**.\nProbing while **selecting and choosing**, binding while **tying and restraining**.",

Sincerity may lack constancy, hence the need for **binding and restraint**.\n\nAll this reveals the **weights and measures** of their **calculations**—thus the Sage **deliberates accordingly**. When the **weights and measures** are laid out, the **light and heavy** naturally distinguish themselves, and only then are **standards** established to **regulate their lightness and heaviness**. Once **light and heavy** find their proper place, **strategies and deliberations** are devised to **guide them along**.\n\nThose who do not conform to the **weights and measures** and **standards** are thus considered by the Sage to be **flawed**—their **lightness and heaviness** do not align with the **true measure**, their **length and shortfall** do not fulfill the **proper count**. Such are **worthless**; what use are they?\n\nThe Sage therefore **reconsiders and devises new strategies**, seeking their **opposite**. Thus, when **agitating**, one may either **cast forth** or **withdraw and store**; those who conform to the **weights and measures** are cast forth for use, while the unworthy are withdrawn and hidden.\n\nWhen **concealing**, one may either **retain** or **reject**. The sincere are retained, the insincere are rejected. **Agitation and concealment** are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Closing the door** is called **Kun (receptive)**, **opening the door** is called **Qian (creative)**—thus, they are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Agitation and concealment** shift **yin and yang**, the **opening and closing of the four seasons**, to **transform all things** in their **longitudinal and latitudinal** ways. The **yin field** shifts, the **four seasons** open and close—all this is the **Dao of agitation and concealment**.\n\n**Longitudinal and latitudinal** refer to **decay and renewal**. All things are either **opened to rise** or **concealed to decay**. **Reversal, inversion, and transformation** must arise from this.\n\nSpeaking of the **Dao of agitation and concealment**, it may **reverse** to emerge from one place, or **reverse** to return from another, or **reverse** to transform here while its **nature** manifests there—all this stems from **agitation and concealment**. Hence it is said: *\"This is how it arises.\"*\n\n**Agitation and concealment** are the **great transformations of the Dao**, the **variations of speech**—one must **forewarn and examine** their transformations. If there is no **opening and closing**, the **great Dao** would not transform. If there is no **variation in speech**, then **opening and closing** are what **transform the great Dao**. Though **speech and affairs** may be vast, they all **achieve completion through transformation**. Hence, **divination is prepared**.\n\n**Fortune and misfortune depend on this**. The **mouth** is the **gatekeeper of the heart**; the **heart** is the **master of the spirit**. The heart **expresses itself through the mouth**, hence the mouth is the **gatekeeper of the heart**. The spirit **serves the heart**, hence the heart is the **master of the spirit**.\n\n**Desires, intentions, joys, and appetites**, **thoughts, wisdom, and strategies**—all these **pass through the gate** in and out. These **eight aspects** all **traverse the mouth**, hence it is said they **enter and exit through the gate**.\n\nThus, **controlling agitation and concealment** regulates their **entry and exit**. **Agitation** is **opening, speaking, yang**; **concealment** is **closing, silence, yin**.\n\nIf these **eight aspects** lack **opening and closing**, affairs may become **unregulated**, hence **agitation and concealment** are used to **govern their entry and exit**. **Speaking outward** is **yang**; **concealing emotions inward** is **yin**. When **yin and yang** are harmonized, their **beginning and end** are complete.\n\n**Opening and closing** are **regulated**, hence **yin and yang** are harmonized. **Sequence and order** are appropriate, hence their **beginning and end** are complete.\n\nThus, **longevity, peace, wealth, honor, fame, affection, profit, satisfaction, joy, and desire** are called **yang**—**beginning**. These all **seek life**, hence they are called **beginning, yang**.\n\n**Death, sorrow, poverty, humiliation, loss, harm, punishment, and execution** are called **yin**—**end**. These all **seek death**, hence they are called **yin, end**.\n\nAll **speech that follows yang** is called **beginning**, meaning **goodness initiates affairs**. All **speech that follows yin** is called **end**, meaning **evil concludes strategies**.\n\nIt is said that **speech** may be **yin** or **yang**; the listener must **know this distinction**. The **Dao of agitation and concealment** is tested through **yin and yang**.\n\nWhether one **probes** or **conceals**, using **yin and yang speech** to test them reveals their **true intentions**. Thus, when speaking to those of **yang disposition**, one **elevates** them; when speaking to those of **yin disposition**, one **lowers** them.\n\nTo those of **yin disposition**, speak **lowly** to seek the **small**; to those of **yang disposition**, speak **highly** to seek the **great**. **Yin speech** is **low and small**, hence *\"seek the small with lowliness\"*; **yang speech** is **elevated**, hence *\"seek the great with height.\"*\n\nFrom this, **nothing is excluded**, **nothing is barred**, **nothing is impossible**. When **yin and yang** are exhausted, **small and great** are revealed—thus **entry and exit are all permissible**; what is there that cannot be?\n\nOne may **speak to individuals**, to **families**, to **nations**, to **the world**. There is **nothing impossible**, hence all that is spoken is **permissible**.\n\nTo act **small** is to have **no interior**; to act **great** is to have **no exterior**.

      "translated_text": "This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang**, and it speaks of the laws governing humanity. Since one embodies the **Heaven and Earth** and mirrors **yin and yang**, its laws can thus be applied to humanity.\n\nAs the **first principle of all affairs**, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**. Heaven is round, Earth is square—this is the meaning of **upper and lower**. When the principles of **opening and closing** are fully realized, then all things are generated. Thus, it is the **first principle of all affairs**, and the **Dao/Way of upper and lower** emerges from here. Hence, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**.\n\n**Secondly, the Dao/Way of listening**: If even one aspect of what is spoken does not align, it must be countered with difficulty. When challenged, the speaker must reconsider and respond accordingly.\n\nThe **Great Transformation** of antiquity arose together with the **Formless**. The **Great Transformation** refers to the ancient sages transforming all things through the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Formless** is the **Dao/Way**. Since movement originates from the **Dao/Way**, it is said to arise together with the **Formless**.\n\nTo **look backward to understand the past**, to **invert to verify the present**; to **look backward to know antiquity**, to **invert to know the present**; to **look backward to know others**, to **invert to know oneself**. This means the **Great Transformation** of the sage examines all things and reflects upon himself. When undertaking affairs, he weighs them with utmost caution, repeatedly verifying and reflecting to **know what is to come** by first observing what has passed; to **know the present** by first examining antiquity; to **know others** by first measuring himself. Thus, he can **execute strategies without omission**, and his actions **always succeed**.\n\nThe principles of **movement and stillness, emptiness and substance** do not align with the present—then one seeks them in antiquity. **Movement and stillness** arise from **action and cessation**; **emptiness and substance** arise from **truth and falsity**. When their principles do not align with the present, one seeks them in antiquity.\n\nThere are affairs that, when inverted, reveal their **covering**—this is the intent of the sage. When an affair does not align, one inverts to seek its counterpart, and upon reversing, the **covering** is revealed. This is how **what is to come** is understood through seeking antiquity—this is the sage’s intent. **One must not fail to examine this.**\n\nIf one does not scrutinize, one will err in **subtlety**—thus, one must not fail to examine.\n\n**Speech is movement**; **silence is stillness**. Following their words, one listens to their **phrasing**. By observing **stillness** in **movement**, what is seen becomes clear. By examining **speech** through **phrasing**, what is gained becomes evident.\n\nWhen speech does not align, one inverts to seek it—its response will surely emerge. This means that if speech does not conform to principle, one must not immediately reject it. Instead, one counters it, compelling the speaker to seek truth, and the **response in accordance with principle** will naturally appear.\n\nSpeech has **symbols**; affairs have **analogies**. When there are **symbols and analogies**, one observes their **sequence**. Since the **response in accordance with principle** has emerged, speech thus has **symbols**, and affairs have **analogies**. Since past affairs had **symbols and analogies**, one must further observe their **sequence**, allowing them to fully manifest.\n\n**Symbols** refer to **legal models**; **analogies** refer to **proportional reasoning**. **Symbols** mirror the affair; **analogies** compare the phrasing.\n\nTo **seek the voiced from the formless**—principle lies in **profound subtlety**, hence it is **formless**. Without speech, it would not be made manifest, hence one seeks the **voiced from the formless**. **Voice** is speech; **analogies** refer to **comparative reasoning**. When the **baited words** align with the affair, one obtains the **truth of the person**.\n\nObtaining **fish** depends on the **bait**; obtaining **words** depends on the **opening statement**. When the **opening statement** is made, the **response** follows; when the **bait** is cast, the **fish** comes—hence, it is called **baiting with words**. When words align with affairs, it is called **aligning with affairs**. **Testing clearly** lies in **unfolding speech**, hence it is called **obtaining the truth of the person**.\n\nThis is like **setting snares to capture beasts**—one spreads the nets widely and oversees them. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the truth emerges on its own—this is the **net for capturing people**. When the net is set and overseen, the beasts are naturally ensnared. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the principle emerges on its own. Once the principle is manifest, the **sage and worthy** distinguish it.\n\nEven if one seeks to conceal themselves, the **Dao/Way** provides no escape—hence, it is called the **net for capturing people**. If one **constantly holds the net** to drive them toward their duties, those who **defy** will inevitably **speak without restraint**, and one must then **adapt the net**.\n\nTo **hold the net for capturing people** is to drive them toward their duties. If they **contradict**, they will **speak without restraint**. Thus, one must **change the net** and further **urge them with boldness**.\n\nTo **stir with symbols**, to **respond to their intent**, to **see their emotions**, and to **guide them accordingly**—this speaks of **adaptation**. **Respond** means to **align**. It means to further open **legal models** to stir them; once their intent is aligned, their emotions become visible, and one then **guides them** accordingly.\n\n**I reflect upon the past**; **they invert to come forward**. When speech has **symbols and analogies**, one establishes the **foundation** accordingly. When **I reflect upon the past** to seek them, and **they invert to come forward** to fulfill their duties, then **strategies emerge without end**. Thus, when speech has **symbols and analogies**, there is **no need to select words**. Thus, one can **establish the foundation of the state**.\n\nTo **layer, repeat, invert, and cover**—then no affair will lose its words. This means that once **symbols and analogies** are established, one then **layers, repeats, inverts, and covers** them—all referring to **repeatedly examining with meticulous care**, allowing no room for error. Thus, one can **fulfill all affairs perfectly**, with no loss of words.\n\nThe sage **leads the foolish and the wise**—all affairs remain **without doubt**. The sage **leads the foolish** by concealing them, thereby knowing their sincerity; **leads the wise** by provoking them, thereby exhausting their emotions, and all obtain their truth. Thus, all affairs remain **without doubt**.\n\nThe ancient masters of **inverted listening** transformed **ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions. This means that those skilled in **inverted listening** enter a state of **forgetting and abandoning perception**, not pondering yet **profoundly observing**, thus able to **transform ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions, penetrating the **profound and subtle** while remaining **mysterious**.\n\nThe **gathering of ghosts and spirits** is inherently **secretive**; now, it cannot be done—hence, it is called **transformation**. When **transformation** aligns with principle, then the **Dao/Way of guiding** becomes clear. If the **Dao/Way of guiding** is unclear, the **emotions obtained** will be indistinct; if the **emotions obtained** are indistinct, the **foundation established** will be unclear. **Clarity in emotions** depends on **clear guidance**; thus, if guidance is unclear, emotions remain indistinct. **Clarity in the foundation** depends on **clear emotions**; thus, if emotions are indistinct, the foundation is unclear.\n\nWhen **symbols and analogies** are transformed, there will surely be **inverted speech** to return and listen to.",

      "translated_text": "「When one speaks, **symbols and analogies** are transformed, and **inverted speech** arises to challenge them. One should let them speak first, then return to **stillness** to listen.\n\nTo hear their words, one must remain **silent**; to make them reveal themselves, one must **close one’s eyes** and feign indifference. To raise their voice, one must lower one’s own; to take from them, one must offer instead. This is the **Dao/Way of inverted listening**, by which one can **entice and draw forth** their true emotions.\n\nThus, when one desires to hear their voice, one must **return to stillness** and **silence**; when one desires them to speak openly, one must **close one’s eyes** and **compress one’s gaze**; when one desires them to be lofty, one must appear **humble**; when one desires them to withdraw, one must **give freely**. In this way, their **emotions** can be **drawn out**, and nothing will remain **hidden**.\n\nTo **open their emotions**, one must first **transform symbols and analogies** and **stir them** through **guiding speech**. When voices resonate in harmony, **true principle** converges. If one wishes to **open their emotions**, first **present symbols and analogies** to **move them**. Once their emotions are stirred, **guiding speech** must be **nurtured gradually**, allowing them to speak naturally—like cranes calling in the shade, their voices echoing in response.\n\nThus, **true principle** can be **drawn together**.\n\nSometimes this arises from one thing, sometimes from another; sometimes by **attending to the superior** (*shàng*), sometimes by **guiding the inferior** (*xià*). The **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is to know whether their words stem from this or that, or whether they are **attended to from above** or **guided from below**. This is how one **discerns truth from falsehood**, knows **harmony from discord**, and **detects their deceit**.\n\nFor **truth and falsehood**, **harmony and discord**, and **deceit**, one discerns them through **attending to the superior** (*shàng*). Their **actions, words, and silences** all emerge from **emotions**; their **joy or anger** reveals their **intentions**.\n\nAll this depends on **first establishing clarity within oneself**—this is the **method** for **guiding speech**. One must **invert and probe** to observe where their **emotions** are **lodged**, thus **testing their sincerity**.\n\nTo **know others**, one must first **see their emotions**; hence, this **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is employed. If one seeks **inner stillness**, one must listen to their words, examine their **affairs**, **discuss all things**, and **distinguish between strength and weakness**.\n\nThough their words may not be of immediate concern, one can **perceive the subtle** and **know the general** (*lèi*). When one **investigates others** and **dwells within their intentions**, one can **measure their capacity** and **shoot their intent**—like a snake’s mark never missing, or **Yì’s arrow** striking true.\n\nIf their **words and emotions align**, their **fortune or misfortune** will not stray—like **Yì’s arrow** finding its mark without fail. **Listening to speech** and **observing emotions** is no different; hence, they are compared thus.\n\nThus, the **beginning of knowing** lies in **self-knowledge** before knowing others. The one who **knows others** is **wise**; the one who **knows oneself** is **enlightened**. **Wisdom** arises from **enlightenment**, and **enlightenment** can **generate wisdom**. To **know others**, one must first **know oneself**.\n\nTheir **mutual understanding** is like **eyeless fish** (*bǐmù*)—each depends on the other. Their **manifestation** is like **light and shadow**—one cannot exist without the other. I can **know myself**; they must **rely on my knowing them**—both gain, and only then do the **Dao/Way of the sages** converge, hence like **eyeless fish**.\n\nWhen **sages** unite, **principle** naturally **shines forth**, like light giving rise to shadow. Their **words are never lost**—like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**. If one **discerns the sage** with **sagely wisdom**, what more is there to lose? Hence, like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**.\n\nTheir **interaction with others** is **subtle**; their **perception of emotions** is **swift**. The **Dao/Way of sages** in dealing with others is **refined and elusive**; yet in an instant, they **see emotions** with precision—like **yin** and **yáng**, or **yáng** and **yin**, like **roundness** and **squareness**, or **squareness** and **roundness**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*) is to **take their type** as one’s own **arms and legs**—to **compare them as parts of a single body**. This **principle** has been **long-standing**.\n\nThus, their **mutual fulfillment** is like **yin** and **yáng**. Their **mutual manifestation** is like **roundness** and **squareness**. Before their **form is seen**, one **guides them with the Dao/Way of roundness**; once their **form is manifest**, one **tasks them with the square method**.\n\nTheir **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, is governed by this. This is the **Dao/Way of employing others**—whether **promoting them**, **demoting them**, **assigning them to the left**, or **elevating them to the right**—all is determined by the **principle of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*).\n\nIf one does not **first establish clarity within oneself**, then **guiding others** will be **improper**. Their **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, if not **first established**, will not align with the **proper method** of **guiding others**.\n\nIf their **employment** is **unskillful**, it is called **forgetting emotions** and **losing the Dao/Way**. When **employment is unskillful**, one **operates from the superficial** (*mò*), **continues without pause** (*xù*), **uses round tools for square holes** (*záo*), and **square tools for round holes** (*bǐng*), thus **losing both emotions and the Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one **first establishes clarity** and **guides others** with **perfect virtue**, then one **drives without visible trace** (*míngxiàng*), **no one sees one’s approach** (*mén*), and it is called **heavenly and divine**.\n\nIf one can **first establish clarity**, then **guiding others** becomes **virtuous and boundless**—**mysterious winds** (*xuánfēng*) **blow far and wide**, neither **form nor trace** is seen, neither **door nor entrance** (*ménhù*) is apparent. One **sees their form** yet cannot **grasp it**; the **Dao/Way** is **ever-applied** yet **unknown**. Hence, it is called **heavenly and divine**.\n\n**Inner Harmony, the Third Chapter**\n\n**Binding** (*chà*) means **holding fast** so that it remains **secure**. One **secures** only after **obtaining**—then **roundness is joined** without separation.\n\nIn matters of **ruler and subject**, **superior and inferior**, if the **Dao/Way aligns**, they **draw near despite distance**; if it does not align, they **stay distant despite closeness**, and **reject what is not their intent**. If their **affairs are in accord**, they **depart yet return** in seeking **harmony**.\n\nThey **advance yet do not approach**; they **hear voices from afar** yet **ponder them in return**. When **separated**, they **advance yet do not approach**, and **hear voices** while **pondering in return**.»",
      "overlap_context": "is unclear, the **emotions obtained** will be indistinct; if the **emotions obtained** are indistinct, the **foundation established** will be unclear. **Clarity in emotions** depends on **clear guidance**; thus, if guidance is unclear, emotions remain indistinct. **Clarity in the foundation** depends on **clear emotions**; thus, if emotions are indistinct, the foundation is unclear.\n\nWhen **symbols and analogies** are transformed, there will surely be **inverted speech** to return and listen to.",

      "translated_text": "「All affairs possess **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*). Words may **draw near despite distance**, or **stay distant despite closeness**—hence, all affairs possess **inner harmony**. They are **bound** by **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao/Way** (*lǜ*), or by **factional ties and wealth**, or by **beauty and favor**. **Binding** from their very **beginning**.\n\nSome are **bound** by **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—when **Dao/Way** connects them to the **ruler and subject**, they are called **subjects** in name, but in reality, they are **masters**. When **Dao/Way** binds them through **friendship**, they are called **friends**—as seen in the case of **Guiguzi**’s disciples in *Ghost Valley Master’s Scrolls* (卷上). Those **bound** by **wealth** or **beauty**, like **Fei Zhong** and **E Lai** under **Jie** and **Jiu**, are of this kind.\n\nThey **utilize their own intentions**—if they wish to **enter**, they enter; if they wish to **exit**, they exit; if they wish to **draw near**, they draw near; if they wish to **stay distant**, they stay distant; if they wish to **approach**, they approach; if they wish to **depart**, they depart; if they wish to **seek**, they seek; if they wish to **ponder**, they ponder. The eight matters from **self-entering and self-exiting** downward are all in accordance with the **subject’s** intentions, following their own desires.\n\nThus, they can **steadfastly resolve their will** toward the **ruler**, and no external force can **intervene**. Like the **ant mother** (*yímǔ*) following its young—when it **exits**, there is no **trace**; when it **enters**, there is no **boundary**; it **goes alone and returns alone**, and none can **halt** it.\n\nThe **ant mother** (*yímǔ*), also called **locust mother** (*huánglà*), resembles a spider, dwelling in a **burrow** with a **cover**. It nurtures its young by covering the burrow’s entrance, and when it **exits and enters**, there is **no initial trace**—thus, nothing can **halt** it.\n\nNow, the **subjects** of **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*) **yield flexibly** to the **ruler**, **binding themselves securely** without **leaving any gaps**. This is also due to **inner harmony**.\n\nThe **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**, while the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**. When persuasive speech is **advanced**, they **bind themselves internally** to the **ruler**. Hence, it is said that the **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**.\n\nThey **weigh the situation** to **plan accordingly**—if the **ruler** does not **grasp** or **accept** their plans, they are **discarded**. Thus, it is said that the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**.\n\nThose who wish to **persuade** must **conceal their true intentions** and **weigh the situation**; those who **plan** must **follow what is convenient**. If they **persuade** while **concealing their intentions**, their words **will succeed**. If they **plan** while **following convenience**, their plans **will be adopted**. Through **subtle deliberation** of **feasibility** and **open discussion** of **advantages and losses**, they **guide the ruler’s will**.\n\nWhen **opportunities arise** and **timing is right**, they **align with the ruler’s plans**. *\"Opportunity\"* refers to the **Dao/Way unfolding**—when the **Dao/Way** **defends** and **advances**, their words **respond to the moment’s needs**, aligning with the **ruler’s** plans.\n\nThey **carefully consider** the **ruler’s** **binding** and **respond appropriately** to **timing**—when **planning** and **deliberating**, they **advance** to the **ruler**, securing their own position, and then **respond** to the **ruler’s** needs, ensuring their words **align with the ruler’s heart**.\n\nIf there is **internal discord**, it cannot be **implemented**. If their **plans** do not **align with the ruler’s**, they cannot be **executed**. Thus, they **probe the ruler’s current inclinations**, **adapt to what is convenient**, and **seek to change** their plans. When their **initial plans** prove unfit, they **reassess**, **adjust**, and **act according to the moment’s needs** to **alter their strategies**.\n\nTo **seek internal harmony** through **change**, they **employ the method of \"taking with the tube\"** (*guǎnqǔjiàn*). When they **take with the tube**, it **becomes distant**; when they **seek internal harmony** through **change**, it **becomes secure**. It is said that when **advancing**, they must **first use persuasive language**; when **responding**, they must **employ adaptable words**. If **past matters** are already **settled**, their words must **be persuasive**; if **future matters** have not yet **manifested**, their words must **be flexible**.\n\nThose skilled in **change** thoroughly **know the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, thus **grasping the Dao/Way of heaven** (*tiān*). Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **harmonize with the four seasons**, causing **ghosts and spirits** to **align with yin and yang**.\n\nThose skilled in **change** refer to those who **master the principles** of **adaptable strategies**. Thoroughly **knowing the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, they can **grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Hence, it is said that they **thus grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **follow the natural order** of the **four seasons**. Hence, it is said that they **harmonize with the four seasons**.\n\n**Ghosts and spirits** are those that **assist yin and yang** in **nurturing life**. When the **Dao/Way** **unifies heaven and earth**, they can **cause ghosts and spirits** to **align in virtue** with **yin and yang**.\n\nThus, they can **nurture the people**. When they **observe the ruler’s** **plans and affairs**, they **know their intentions**.\n\nTheir **nurturing of the people** lies in **observing their plans and affairs** to **know their intentions**. If there are **plans that do not align**, it is because they are **unfamiliar**.\n\nWhen they **align yet do not bind**, it is **yang** (*yang*) **drawing near externally** while **yin** (*yīn*) **stays distant internally**. There may be **separation and reunion** without **secure binding**—when **yang** (*yang*) **externally draws near**, while **yin** (*yīn*) **internally stays distant**.\n\nIf there are **plans that do not align**, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** them. *\"Not align\"* refers to **round holes for square pegs**; hence, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** such plans.\n\nThus, those who **draw near despite distance** possess **hidden virtue**; those who **stay distant despite closeness** lack **harmony of intent**. *\"Hidden virtue\"* refers to **private bonds** of **yin** (*yīn*).\n\nThose who **approach yet are rejected** have **unfavorable strategies**; those who **depart yet return seeking** have **opportunities arising mid-affair**. It is said that when **words** do not **align with the moment**, and **affairs** are **settled only after realization**, it is because **opportunities arose mid-affair**.\n\nThose who **advance yet do not approach** have **improper implementation**; those who **hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return** are **aligned with their plans** and **await decisive action**. It is said that when their **actions** **align with their own plans**, they **wait to execute them in sequence**, hence *\"hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return\"*.\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"If one does not see their kind yet acts accordingly, they will meet with opposition; if one does not grasp their true intent yet persuades them, they will be met with disapproval.\"*\n\nIt is said that if one does not **grasp their true intent and kind**, yet **persuades them**, it is like **driving northward while facing south** or **Chen Xiao** traveling to **Qin**—thus, they will **meet with disapproval and opposition**.\n\nIf they **grasp their true intent**, they can **control their movements**—when they **encounter favorable winds**, like **swans** (*hóng*) or **fish** (*yú*) in **vast waters**, they **flow freely**, and none can **halt** them. Thus, they can **direct their actions** at will.\n\nThis **method** allows for **free entry and exit**, **secure binding or opening**. This **method** refers to **grasp of their true intent**—then **entry and exit** are **unrestricted**, and **binding or opening** are **as they wish**.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage establishes affairs by first knowing through this grasp of intent and thus controlling all things. It is said that by grasping intent to establish affairs, one can foresee what is favorable or not. All things, whether bound or unchanging, are thus rooted in grasping intent.\n\nFrom the Way and virtue, to ren and righteousness, to rites and music, to strategies and schemes—all stem from grasping intent, enabling the practice of ren, righteousness, and virtue in all undertakings.\n\nFirst, one examines the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, blending and adjusting interpretations, deliberating what to retain or discard. *Hun* means \"to harmonize.\" This refers to first considering the words of the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, aligning them with one’s own reasoning, then adjusting and refining current affairs, debating what to accept or reject.\n\nTo unite, one employs the inner; to discard, the outer. *Inner* refers to intent within; *outer* refers to intent without. When intent is grasped, unity follows naturally; when intent is lost, separation ensues—this is the constant principle.\n\nTo discern inner and outer, one must master the Dao and its patterns, anticipating events through strategy, resolving doubts with precision. It is said that those skilled in inner and outer understanding perceive the unfolding of the Dao’s patterns, foresee events, and resolve doubts in sequence.\n\nWith no miscalculations in strategy, one establishes merit and builds virtue. Having mastered the Dao’s unfolding, one’s strategies are without error. Without error in strategy, one can then establish merit and build virtue.\n\nTo govern the people and manage resources, one must *control and harmonize inwardly*. To order the names of lord and subject, ensuring hierarchy is clear. To regulate taxes and labor, ensuring no disparity between near and far. When hierarchy is clear, duties are distinct. When disparity is absent, burdens are light. Thus, this becomes the foundation of a state. Hence, it is said: *control and harmonize inwardly*.\n\nWhen the ruler is blind and ungoverned, the people are chaotic and unaware, one must *control and reverse* the situation. When the ruler neglects his duties and the people are unaware of their unrest, the world becomes a land without states, a realm without masters, and those in darkness may act as they please, while those who scorn you will rise. Hence, it is said: *control and reverse*.\n\nWhen inner alignment is achieved and nothing is left externally, one may persuade and elevate. It is said that a virtuous ruler, confident in his actions, does not retain the praise of others. Such a one creates reputation and spreads it abroad, testing others’ intentions.\n\nIf one is summoned, one welcomes and responds. When the ruler’s heart is virtuous, if a summons comes, one greets and obeys it to fulfill one’s purpose. If one wishes to depart, one does so through calculated risk. Like birds that take flight before settling, one departs by offering perilous terms.\n\nThrough cyclical transformation and adaptation, no action is forced—this is the way of great propriety. At the juncture of departure or arrival, one weighs what is fitting, turning like a wheel, adapting to change. Though others may not perceive the intent, such retreat is the ultimate in preserving oneself and upholding propriety. *Propriety* is *law*.\n\n**Chapter Four: Looming Collapse (Dǐ Zhí)**\n*Dǐ* means to strike firmly; *zhí* refers to cracks and fissures. When walls collapse due to fissures, or structures fail due to hidden flaws, one must strike firmly to reinforce them. Thus, walls and structures will not fail. If ruin is inevitable, one removes it and rebuilds, placing people and affairs accordingly.\n\nThings have their natural order; affairs have their unions and separations. This speaks of unions and separations as natural principles. Some things are near yet unseen, others far yet known. What is near yet unseen is due to not examining their words; what is far yet known comes from reflecting past events to judge the present.\n\nBy examining words and observing actions, one can perceive near intent. By reflecting past events to judge the present, one can foresee distant affairs. The past is like the present. Thus, by reviewing the past, one can verify the future. Hence, it is said: *reflect the past to judge the present*.\n\n*Tie* is the altar; the altar is *xián*; *xián* is the beginning of great fissures. When fissures grow vast, collapse is imminent, so one must strike firmly to reinforce.\n\nAt the outset, cracks may be *loomed* (mapped) and sealed, struck to repel, struck to suppress, struck to conceal, or struck to resolve. This is the principle of *looming collapse*.\n\n*Ying* refers to the emergence of fissures—its subtle beginnings. What arises internally can be sealed by striking; what comes externally can be repelled; what rises from below can be suppressed; what is nascent can be concealed; what is beyond remedy can be accepted. Deep understanding of these five aspects reveals the true logic of *looming collapse*.\n\nWhen danger looms, the Sage perceives it, safeguarding their methods, adapting to transform affairs, mastering strategies and schemes to discern the subtle. The Sage operates beyond form—thus, when danger first appears, they are already aware, both clear and wise. Hence, they safeguard their methods.\n\nBy adapting to transform affairs, they respond to circumstances, mastering strategies and schemes to weave and measure, discerning the subtle to preemptively guard against it. From the finest hair’s breadth, they act to sway the roots of great mountains.\n\nThe Han Emperor Gaozu rose from humble origins to the imperial throne; Tang of the Shang ruled from a hundred li to govern all under heaven. *Jīng* is the beginning; *huī* is movement.",

      "translated_text": "When the signs of external turmoil first emerge—conspiracies lurking like sprouting weeds—all such schemes arise from *dǐzhì* (抵帜), the strategic response to fissures in the Dao, serving as its defense. *[#21]*\n\nWhen governance falters and external signs of chaos sprout—when rebellious plots begin to take root—sage counsel is invoked to devise strategy. *[#22]* This is because the art of *dǐzhì* lies in seizing these moments. Thus, when the fissures appear, the Way’s defense may be enacted. Hence it is said: *\"To block the gap of the banner is to unfold the Way.\"*\n\nWhen the realm fractures, with no enlightened ruler above and nobles lacking virtue, then schemers and traitors rise, the worthy are sidelined, the Sage exiled, and deceitful opportunists flourish. Rulers and ministers mislead one another, leading to collapse and mutual destruction—father and son turn against each other, estranged and hostile. This is called the *sprouting of rebellious seeds* (萌牙). Such is the *banner of chaos* (帜坛) for the state. *[伐射]* means to provoke conflict and strike one another.\n\nWhen the Sage perceives the sprouting of rebellious seeds, they respond with law. If the age can be governed, they block it to seal it off; if not, they block it to seize it. Sometimes they block thus, sometimes they block otherwise—sometimes they counter it, sometimes they overturn it. To block thus is to seal it; to block otherwise is to seize it. To counter it is to aid its logic; to overturn it is to take the land by force.\n\nThe governance of the Five Emperors was sealed by blocking; the deeds of the Three Kings were seized by blocking. The Five Emperors’ rule could still be rectified in their time, hence *\"blocking to seal it\"*—thus the practice of abdication in favor of the worthy. The Three Kings’ era was beyond rectification, hence *\"blocking to seize it\"*—thus the wars of conquest.\n\nWhen feudal lords clash, no single victory can be counted upon—at such times, the ability to block determines supremacy. *[This refers to the Age of the Five Hegemons, where dominance came from above.]*\n\nFrom the union and separation of Heaven and Earth’s cyclical rise and fall, there must always be fissures in the banner—these cannot be ignored. *[合离]* refers to *Yin-Yang negation and affirmation*; the Dao’s true observation reveals that even Heaven and Earth have moments of negation and affirmation, creating these fissures—how much more so for humanity! Thus, it is said: *\"These cannot be ignored.\"*\n\nTo discern them through *yáohé* (掉阖)—to wield this Way—is the mark of the Sage. *[牌阖]* is also negation and affirmation. Those who embody the Great Dao to govern human affairs are the Sage. The Sage is Heaven and Earth’s envoy, following humanity to serve the cosmic order—hence *\"Heaven and Earth’s envoy.\"*\n\nIf no opportunity arises for blocking, they remain hidden, awaiting the moment. When the moment comes, they act. If it can be aligned with the above, if it can be restrained below—*aligning with the above* means blocking to seal, aiding the age’s governance; *restraining below* means blocking to seize, forcing submission to oneself. *[#23]*\n\nTo act in accordance and follow the Way is to guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth. *[#24]* Those who follow this Way may occupy the supreme position—thus, they guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*(End of Ghost Valley Classic, Volume One)*",

      "translated_text": "**\"Fei\" (Flying)** refers to raising one’s reputation to exalt and elevate it. **\"Jian\" (Clamping)** refers to restraining and binding so that they cannot escape.\n\nThe method of taking a person begins by raising their reputation to exalt them, and they will inevitably reveal their true intentions and exhaust their resolve without concealment. Only then can one, through their preferences, restrain and bind them so they cannot shift or turn.\n\nIn assessing talent and ability, the purpose is to summon those from afar and bring those nearby. By gauging their strategies and measuring their capacities—whether distant or near—one determines their potential. Raising their reputation is how one summons those from afar and brings those nearby.\n\nFor instance, when the virtuous are either distant or near, one employs this method to attract them, as in the case of King Zhao of Yan honoring Guo Ju, a matter of historical record.\n\nTo establish influence and control affairs, one must first discern distinctions and similarities, separating the threads of right and wrong. Once those from afar and near have arrived, one then establishes the authority of rewards and punishments, regulating the success or failure of their actions.\n\nWith the situation thus set, one must first examine the alliances and divisions—whether they align or oppose—and distinguish the truth or falsehood in their words. Observing their inner and outer expressions, one knows the presence or absence of their true capabilities. The outer refers to superficial appearances, the inner to genuine substance; presence or absence refers to the Dao’s unfolding of their abilities or failures.\n\nAgain, by observing their true or deceptive words, one discerns whether their capabilities are genuine or feigned. One then resolves matters of safety and peril, determining relationships of closeness and distance.\n\nHaving discerned distinctions, separated right from wrong, observed inner and outer expressions, and known presence or absence, one can then arrange matters of safety and peril, and settle affairs of closeness and distance—thus distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy.\n\nOnly then does one weigh and measure them. If they harbor hidden intentions, one can then summon, seek, and employ them. Weighing determines their lightness or heaviness; measuring determines their length or shortcoming. Once their lightness or heaviness is revealed, and their length or shortcoming takes form, one applies hidden strategies to aid their alignment or deviation.\n\nThus, whether summoning, seeking, or employing them becomes possible.\n\nUsing the words of **hook-and-clamp**, one flies and clamps them. **\"Hook\"** refers to luring and revealing their true nature. The talents and dispositions of people vary in rank, so the words of hook-and-clamp also have gradations.\n\nThus, when employing hook-and-clamp words, if one confuses them internally to reveal their true nature, it is called **hook**; if one praises them externally to reveal their true nature, it is called **fly**. Once their true nature is obtained, one clamps and restrains them so they cannot escape or shift—hence, **hook-and-clamp**, hence **flying hook-and-clamp**.\n\nThe language of hook-and-clamp is flexible, sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging. That is, when employing hook-and-clamp words, one may either feign agreement to unite them or feign opposition to separate them—hence, **sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging**.\n\nIf they cannot be swayed by this, one may first summon them and then impose burdens. **\"Cannot be swayed\"** means the hook-and-clamp words fail to move them. Thus, one first issues commands to summon them. **\"Imposing burdens\"** refers to, once they arrive, revealing their true capacities.\n\nOnce they arrive, one then fully reveals their true abilities and defenses, knowing what they can do—some may thus follow and transform. Or, one may first impose burdens and then disparage them. Some, even after revealing their true abilities, still do not follow and transform, so one then exposes their shortcomings to disparage them—those who err may thus follow, indicating they did not understand transformation.\n\nOr, one may use imposing burdens as disparagement, or disparagement as imposing burdens. Some reveal their true abilities, yet their shortcomings become evident—this is using burdens as disparagement. Others, after detailing their shortcomings, are shamed into compliance—this is using disparagement as burdens.\n\nBecause they are difficult to move, one may either impose burdens or disparage them, driving and luring them into transformation.\n\nIn employing them, one may use wealth, treasures, jade, pearls, white jade, or adornments to serve them. **\"Employing them\"** means, once they have followed and transformed, one must first know their nature, habits, likes, and dislikes, then move them with wealth or adornments to test their loyalty.\n\nOr, one may measure their abilities and establish influence to hook them—gauging their strengths and weaknesses, then setting the conditions of approach or withdrawal to hook their true nature and discern their intelligence and strategy.\n\nOr, one may observe their actions, see their proficiency, and clamp them—meaning one watches their conduct, sees their skill, and restrains them to know their courage or cowardice.\n\nIn applying this method, one uses **blocking and signaling**—meaning these above methods are extensions of blocking and signaling.\n\nWhen intending to employ them in the world, one must measure their abilities, observe the flourishing or decline of the times, assess the breadth or narrowness of the land, the difficulty or ease of the terrain, the abundance or scarcity of the people and resources, and the alliances of the feudal lords—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated.\n\n**\"Employing them in the world\"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to assist the emperor. Measuring abilities determines whether the emperor’s capacities can be aided to completion. Observing the times’ flourishing or decline, the land’s breadth or narrowness, and the people’s abundance or scarcity further determines whether the harmony of Heaven, Earth, and humanity aligns with the age’s prosperity or adversity. Examining the feudal lords’ alliances—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated—further determines whether they will follow or oppose.\n\nHaving carefully considered their intentions and inclinations, one knows their likes and dislikes, then speaks to what they value most, using flying-and-clamping words to hook their desires and clamp them in pursuit.\n\nHaving carefully examined their intentions and inclinations, knowing their likes and dislikes, one then addresses what they hold most dear. Again, using flying-and-clamping words, one hooks their desires. Having known their desires, one clamps and seeks them. If their desires are not defied, what persuasion would they refuse?\n\nWhen employing this on people, one measures their intelligence and abilities, weighs their talents and strength, gauges their qi and influence, and sets the pivotal mechanisms to welcome, follow, clamp, and harmonize them according to intent. This is the **continuation of flying and clamping**.\n\n**\"Employing this on people\"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to the feudal lords. Measuring intelligence and abilities, gauging qi and influence also seeks to know their strategic capabilities.\n\n**\"Pivot\"** is what governs the movement of doors; **\"mechanism\"** is what governs the release of crossbows.",

      "translated_text": "「Once one has discerned the strategic capabilities—both strengths and weaknesses—of the feudal lords, laws are then established to regulate their movements, as the pivot governs the door’s opening and closing, and the mechanism governs the firing of the crossbow. Sometimes one leads them by welcoming, sometimes follows by yielding, always restraining their emotions to harmonize them and guiding their intentions to suit one’s own purpose. Thus, the feudal lords’ loyalty can be secured, and the ruler’s favor can be firmly maintained.\n\nThis is called the **continuation of flying and clamping**—applying the extensions of flying and clamping to people. When used on people, it means sending out empty words while receiving sincere responses, binding them without losing them, and probing their speech to discern their true intent. They may comply with clamping, they may resist it, they may be drawn in or repelled, they may be guided east or west, south or north, or even turned back or overturned. Yet when used on people, it refers to deploying the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to manipulate them. Only by spreading one’s reputation does this work—hence, \"sending out empty words.\" They, in turn, open their hearts and reveal their true emotions, submitting to you—hence, \"receiving sincere responses.\" Once their emotions are secured, they are bound by the **continuation of flying and clamping** and not abandoned. Further, by spreading their words and observing their speech, one can make them follow, resist, or be bound in any direction. Their reversal or overthrow lies solely in your clamping and guiding, for there is no thought that cannot be subdued. Though they may overturn, they can be restored, never losing their proper measure. Though they may falter or fail, the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** can recover and reassert them, never losing its rhythm and control—this is the **ultimate application of clamping**.\n\n**The Sixth Principle: Unity in Opposition**\nThe Dao/Way being hidden, the proper path cannot proceed openly, so when one seeks to unite, one must first oppose. This ensures they have no doubt, allowing one to then carry out their intentions—just as the departure of Yi Yin and Lü Shang was the prelude to their unity.\n\nIn all cases of seeking unity through opposition, there must be a fitting strategy.\nWhen one seeks unity through opposition, even if the responses are uneven, the application of strategy will make them align. Through transformation and adaptation, they follow suit, each with their own form and momentum, their reversals and overthrows interdependent, and measures established according to circumstances.\nThe principle of opposition is self-referential: it shifts with the transformation, like links in a chain. Yet their departures and arrivals each have their own patterns—some reverse, some overturn. The principle itself seeks alignment, and no matter the circumstances, measures are established accordingly.\n\nThus, the sage, positioned between heaven and earth, establishes their standing to govern the world, spreading teachings and proclaiming their name, always adapting to the confluence of circumstances and observing the suitability of the times. They consider what should be expanded or reduced, using this to foreknow and align with transformations. What should be expanded or reduced refers to the proper application of governance and teaching. Once knowing what must be expanded or reduced, one acts accordingly. Hence, \"foreknow\"—using the principle of opposition to understand.\n\n**Transformation and Adaptation** refers to shifting and conforming to the changes of others.\nThe world has no fixed nobility, nor do matters have a fixed master.\nRen (benevolence) makes one noble, hence no fixed nobility.\nEstablishing virtue makes one a master, hence no fixed master.\nThe sage is always acting without fixed action, always listening without fixed listening—\nBy using the **continuation of flying and clamping**, they act without restraint.\nThey do not listen to baseless words, hence no fixed listening.\n\nWhen matters are completed and strategies align, the sage takes the lead in guiding them.\nIn matters, they are already accomplished; in strategy, they are already harmonized.\nThus, they are established with the multitude as their leader.\nWhen aligned with one and separated from another, loyalty cannot serve two masters.\nWhen aligned with one but separated from another, their loyalty cannot be fully applied to both.\nThere must be **opposition through reversal**—\nReversing to this, nature to that, and then reversing again to that.\nIts method is this:\nSince loyalty cannot be fully applied to both, it is proper to employ the **stratagem of reversal and fear** to manipulate them.\n\n**Reversal and Opposition** means reversing to unite with this, then acting to oppose that.\nTo act through reversal means to create doubt in their affairs, so that the confused cannot perceive the truth.\n\nWhen deploying this across the world, one must measure the world and align with it;\nWhen deploying this within a state, one must measure the state and align with it;\nWhen deploying this within a family, one must measure the family and align with it;\nWhen deploying this in personal conduct, one must measure one’s own abilities, strength, and influence, and align with them.\nGreat or small, advance or retreat—its use remains consistent.\nWhen deploying this, it refers to the extension of opposition.\nTo measure means to assess the presence or absence of their circumstances.\nTo align means to cultivate their favor.\nBefore executing the **stratagem of reversal**, one must first affirm their circumstances and curry their favor, then the hidden ruler will have no way to perceive or awaken, thus allowing the deployment of the **stratagem of reversal** to succeed.\n\nThough the extensions of its application may vary in scale—great or small, advance or retreat—yet when one properly affirms their circumstances and cultivates their favor, it remains consistent in use, hence \"its use remains consistent.\"\n\nOne must first deliberate on strategy and define plans before executing them with the **flying-and-clamping stratagem**. When deploying the **extension of reversal and fear**, one must first establish the strategy and plans, then execute them, again using the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to reinforce and fill the gaps.\n\nThe ancients who mastered the art of opposition and reversal\nUnified the Four Seas, encompassed the feudal lords’ loyalty, and transformed the land of unity—then sought to align.\nThose who deeply understood the principle of opposition and reversal\nUnified all under heaven, united the feudal lords, and drove them to the land of unity—then employed methods to transform and shift them.\nOnce their hearts were aligned, they sought their true ruler and united with them.\nHence, Yi Yin five times approached Tang, five times approached Jie, before uniting with Tang;\nLü Shang three times approached King Wen, three times entered Yin, yet could not clarify his purpose—before uniting with King Wen.\nYi Yin approached Jie and Zhou because their nature demanded no doubt, and since they had no doubt, he could then unite with their true ruler.\nThis is the **clamping of heavenly command**, hence their submission without doubt.\nHeavenly command was tied to Yin, Tang, and King Wen, so the two ministers submitted to the two rulers without doubt.\nWithout the utmost sage reaching the depths of the Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world;\nWithout laboring over the mind and exhausting thought, one cannot fathom matters;\nWithout fully attending to emotions and discerning truth, one cannot establish reputation;\nWithout refined talent and virtue, one cannot wield armies;\nWithout genuine sincerity, one cannot know people.»",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the **Way of harmonizing nature**, one must first assess one’s own talents and abilities, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one’s **sagely discernment** and **long-term vision**—whether near or distant, who is superior and who is inferior.\n\nThe **Way of harmonizing** cannot be applied to those who surpass oneself, but rather to those who do not. Hence, one must know who is inferior before acting. Only then can one advance, retreat, expand, or contract. Once the **Way of harmonizing** is applied to those inferior to oneself, then advancement, retreat, expansion, and contraction are solely as one desires.\n\n**Chapter Seven: *Assessing Power and Discerning Emotions***\nThe ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.\n\nWhat is meant by measuring **power**? It is to gauge the scale of greatness and smallness, to strategize based on the multitude or scarcity of forces, and to evaluate the presence or absence of wealth and resources. The ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.\n\nMeasuring **power** means:\n- Gauging the scale of greatness and smallness,\n- Strategizing based on the multitude or scarcity of forces,\n- Evaluating the presence or absence of wealth and resources,\n- Calculating the abundance or scarcity of the populace,\n- Assessing whether there is surplus or deficit, and by how much,\n- Determining the advantages and disadvantages of terrain—whether it is perilous or easy,\n- Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of strategic planning,\n- Distinguishing the merit or demerit of ministers—whether they are virtuous or unworthy,\n- Judging the wisdom or lack thereof among guests and allies,\n- Observing the auspicious or inauspicious signs of Heaven’s timing,\n- Deciding which feudal lords to engage and which to disregard,\n- Measuring the stability or danger of the people’s hearts—whether they incline toward or away from you,\n- And whether they love or hate you.\n\nThrough careful observation, one can discern what is convenient. Thus, one can know their emotions. If one does this, their emotions can be understood, and no matter the situation, one can act accordingly.\n\n**Discerning emotions** requires approaching them when their desires are most pronounced to fully explore their cravings. When they have cravings, even a **wooden** figure cannot conceal their emotions. One must then approach them when their fears are most intense to fully explore their aversions. When they have aversions, they cannot conceal their emotions. Emotions and desires will inevitably reveal their changes.\n\nIf one is moved by their emotions yet does not perceive these changes, then one should avoid speaking to them and instead question those close to them, to know where their comfort lies. Even if one approaches them during moments of joy or fear to probe their desires and aversions, one may still not know their changes. Thus, one should avoid speaking to them and gradually question those close to them, and their true desires and comforts can then be known.\n\nEmotions that change within are reflected in outward appearance. Therefore, one must always use what is visible to infer what is hidden—this is called **probing and discerning emotions**. Emotions and outward expressions never diverge; internal changes are always mirrored in external appearance. Thus, one must always use outward appearance to infer internal emotions.\n\nThose who observe facial expressions to discern emotions are indeed employing this **Way**. This is called **probing the depths and discerning emotions**.\n\nTherefore, when calculating state affairs, one must carefully assess **power**. When advising a ruler, one must carefully discern emotions. Strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires must emerge from this. If one carefully assesses **power**, then state affairs can be calculated; if one carefully discerns emotions, then one can advise the ruler.\n\nAs for strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires, all must be discerned before action is taken. Hence, it is said that strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires also emerge from this.\n\nThen one can determine what is precious or worthless, what is weighty or light, what is advantageous or harmful, what can succeed or fail—all depend on this. If one is precise in **discerning and probing**, then preciousness, worthlessness, success, and failure are all determined by oneself, with nothing outside of **discerning and probing**. Hence, it is said that all depends on this.\n\nThus, even with the **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, without **discerning emotions**, one cannot uncover the hidden and concealed. This is the fundamental principle of strategy and the method of persuasion. The **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, though vast and profound, mysterious and wondrous, if not combined with the **probing of emotions**, then how can one seek their hidden and concealed aspects?\n\nTherefore, **discerning emotions** is the root of successful strategy and the foundation of persuasion.\n\nThere are always matters concerning people, yet people cannot anticipate these matters before they arise—this is the most difficult to achieve. Those who wield the **probing of emotions** also possess the insight of **unique perception**, hence they can anticipate matters concerning people before anyone else.\n\nThey can also exhaust all possibilities and perceive all changes, thus anticipating matters before they arise. Without embodying the profound and mastering the mysterious, none can achieve this. Hence, it is said that this is the most difficult to achieve.\n\nTherefore, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern, meaning one must always time their strategic planning. Human emotions are more treacherous than mountains and rivers, and more difficult to fathom than Heaven’s workings. Now, if one wishes to **discern and govern** them, is it not difficult?\n\nHence, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern. Strategic planning arises from human emotions; one must know their timing and rhythms. This is why it is the most difficult.\n\nTherefore, even the slightest movement of a silkworm—just a tiny insect—contains the potential for advantage or harm, and can give rise to matters. The beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities. The silkworm’s slight movements are but a humble creature, yet they still carry the seeds of advantage or harm. Thus, if one follows them, they bring joy; if one opposes them, they provoke anger. How much more so with humans, how much more so with ghosts and spirits?\n\nTherefore, advantage and harm are inevitable in affairs, and following or opposing them is the natural course of events. Hence, to invite advantage and avoid harm is the constant principle. Observing this can lead to the beauty of **generating affairs**.\n\n**Generating affairs** lies in carefully assessing subtle opportunities—hence, it is said that the beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities.»",

When they respond, they will inevitably act as desired.\nOnce the emotions are divined and their inclinations known, one then **adapts subtly** to their desires, and when their desires are met, emotions will surely stir.\nTesting and probing them, thus the inner **oaths** will respond.\n\nSo, when the **oaths** respond, one must withdraw subtly to fulfill their intended actions.\nThis is called **blocking fate and concealing intent**, hiding one’s true appearance and evading emotions so that others remain unaware—thus, one’s plans succeed without misfortune.\n\nThe ruler, having already determined the actions, can then **adapt** to fulfill them.\nThe minister’s affairs are best when left **unseen**, for completion brings an end—thus, one withdraws subtly.\nIf one does not align with this strategy, the credit for success will go to the ruler.\nThis is akin to **blocking fate and concealing intent**, **hiding appearance and evading emotions**.\n\nWhen emotions are concealed and intent is blocked, how can others know?\nIf others do not know the means by which one **restrains** their borrowed ruin, then one’s affairs can be completed without **restraint**.\n\n**\"Divining\"** lies here, **\"oaths\"** lie there—aligning and responding to them, there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.\nThis **adapting** is so subtle, yet its effects are naturally evident.\nThe observer sees only the results and not the subtlety itself.\nThus, when employing this method, success is assured—there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.\n\nThe ancient masters of **adapting** were like those who cast a hook into the depths—baiting it and hiding the line, they were sure to catch the fish.\nHence, it is said: *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing, conquers battles without others fearing.\"*\n\nThe fisherman reveals the bait but conceals the hook—thus, the fish does not see the bait, yet the hook is obtained.\nThe **virtuous** observe the results of their actions but conceal their **adapting**—thus, others do not know, yet they are naturally swayed.\nTherefore, it is said: *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing.\"*\n\nVictory in battle stems from **adapting** well—when **adapting** is concealed, there is no source from which to fear, hence it is said: *\"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing.\"*\n\nThe **Sage** plans in secrecy, hence it is called **mysterious** (*shen*);\nThey accomplish it openly, hence it is called **illuminated** (*ming*).\n**Mysterious** planning is concealed and hidden, daily actions unknown—like the **Dao/Way**’s inscrutable path, hence it is called **mysterious**.\nWhen affairs are completed and plans fulfilled, their brilliance shines clearly—hence it is called **illuminated**.\n\nSo, the saying *\"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing\"* means they do not see the means of advantage, yet they recognize the **Way**;\n*\"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing\"* means they trust the **Way** and are unaware of the reasoning behind it—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated** (*shenming*).\n\nThe **Sage** embodies the **Dao/Way** and establishes teachings, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth to effect transformations. They **conceal** their brilliance and **hide** their paths, **reserving** their actions while **displaying** their **virtue**.\nThus, people cannot comprehend their **borrowed ruin** (*shen*), yet they follow the **Dao/Way** without knowing its reasoning—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated**.\n\nConstantly waging war through **non-contention** (*buzheng*), they **restrain** disaster within their own hearts and minds, using **non-contention** as their method of war.\nNo armies are raised—**virtue** flows naturally, and the people are all unaware of the reasoning behind their **fearlessness**.\nOne **adapts** with their anger;\nOne **adapts** with their balance, one **adapts** with their rectitude—」",

**foolish**’s skill, they will not be constrained.\n\nWhen speaking of what is beneficial, one follows their strengths;\nWhen speaking of what is harmful, one avoids their weaknesses.\nIf one follows the strengths of what is beneficial and avoids the weaknesses of what is harmful,\nThen their speech will be heard, and their actions will succeed.\n\nThus, the **armored insect**’s fierceness must rely on its **solidity**,\nThe **stinging insect**’s movement must rely on its **venom**.\nHence, **birds and beasts** use their strengths,\nAnd the **orator** knows how to use their advantages.\n\nThe **armored insect** hides itself with its **solidity**,\nThe **stinging insect** moves with venom to defend itself—\nThis is using their strengths.\nThus, they can avoid harm.\n\nEven other birds and beasts do not fail to use their strengths to preserve themselves.\nThe **orator**, observing this, also knows what to use and how to use it.\n\nThus, there are **five kinds of speech**:\n**Illness**, **grievance**, **worry**, **anger**, and **joy**.\nIf any one of these five arises, it disrupts **harmony** and **clarity**.\n\nThus:\n**Illness** arises from **weakened qi** and **lack of spirit**—\nThe ill are **dazed**, so their qi is weak and their spirit is absent.\n**Grievance** arises from **ruptured intestines** and **lack of mastery**—\nThe grieved are inwardly agitated, so their intestines are ruptured and their speech lacks control.\n**Worry** arises from **blockage** and **no release**—\nThe worried are **restless**, so they are blocked and their speech does not flow.\n**Anger** arises from **reckless movement** and **lack of restraint**—\nThe angry are **stifled and surging**, so they move recklessly and their speech is uncontrolled.\n**Joy** arises from **dissipation** and **lack of focus**—\nThe joyful are **shaken**, so they scatter and their speech lacks purpose.\n\nThese five, when **refined**, are used;\nWhen **advantageous**, they are applied.\nSince these five deviate from **moderation**, their use must be **refined**, and their application must be **advantageous**.\nIf they are neither refined nor advantageous, they are abandoned.\n\nThus:\nWhen speaking with the **wise**, rely on **breadth**;\nWith the **clumsy**, rely on **clarity**;\nWith the **eloquent**, rely on **concision**;\nWith the **noble**, rely on **authority**;\nWith the **wealthy**, rely on **elevation**;\nWith the **poor**, rely on **benefit**;\nWith the **lowly**, rely on **humility**;\nWith the **bold**, rely on **daring**;\nWith the **reckless**, rely on **sharpness**.\n\nThis is the **method**, yet people often reverse it.\nThis is the **measure** for appropriate speech—\nThose who do not understand reverse it,\nAnd thus act against **principle**, failing to avoid harm.\n\nHence:\nWhen speaking with the **wise**, use this to **illuminate** them;\nWhen speaking with the **unwise**, use this to **teach** them—yet it is difficult.\nTo speak with the **wise**, present this **method** clearly;\nTo speak with the **unwise**, teach them this **method**—\nBut since people’s confusion deepens over time, teaching them is difficult.\n\nThus, **speech** has many **categories**, and **actions** have many **changes**.\nHence, it is said:\nIf speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.\nSpeech is **diverse and intricate**, hence many **categories**.\nActions adapt to **circumstances**, hence many **changes**.\nIf speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.\n\nTo remain unchanging yet not lose **principle**—\nThis is why the **wise** value **not acting rashly**.\nNot being disordered, they do not change,\nThus their **principle** remains constant.\nThose who can maintain constancy without change—\nThis is the **use of wisdom**, hence their wisdom is **precious and not rash**.\n\nListening values **acuity**,\nWisdom values **clarity**,\nSpeech values **originality**.\nIf listening is **acute**, truth and falsehood are not confused;\nIf wisdom is **clear**, right and wrong are self-evident;\nIf speech is **original**, right and wrong have **proof**.\n\nIf these three are practiced, then **achievement** and **success** are secured—\nHence they must be **valued**.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Planning**\nIn human affairs, planning follows **human nature**.\nObtain the **foundation**, and the **foundation** must be obtained,\nThen seek its **pattern**, and **human nature** can be sought.\nSeeing **human nature** and planning, then no matter is left unfinished.\n\nCarefully obtaining **human nature**, one establishes the **Three Complements**.\nThey are: **Middle**, **Low**.\n\nUsing these three to verify, then **strange strategies** can arise.\nThe **Three Complements** are:\n**Upper**—to generate **strangeness**.\n**Strangeness** does not know its **origin**, beginning from ancient **patterns**.\n\nThe three are used together to verify,\nThen **strange strategies** can emerge.\nOnce **strange strategies** arise, they are universally effective—\nYet they are **obscured**.\n\nMeasuring **talent** and **ability**, one does not know their **limitations**.\nYet these **strange strategies** did not originate today or yesterday.\nThus, those of **shared nature** and **affinity** begin from antiquity, following **principle**.\n\nThe **South-pointing chariot** is used for those who do not **weigh circumstances**—\nYet it is also a **guide** for those whose affairs succeed together.\nThose of **shared desire** but **estranged**—\nThese are those who **harm each other**.\nAll who share **nature** and **desire** to **plan and act together**:\nIf their affairs succeed together, later they will be **affectionate**;\nIf one succeeds and one is harmed, later they will be **estranged**—this is **principle**.\n\nThose who share **hatred** and are **affectionate**—\nThese are those who **harm each other together**.\nThose who share **hatred** but are **estranged**—\nThese are those who **harm each other partially**.\n**Shared hatred** means they are **hated by the same**.\nLater, if both are harmed, their **nature** will be **affectionate**;\nIf one is spared and one is harmed, **principle** dictates they will be **estranged**—\nThis too is **principle**.\n\nThus, **benefit brings closeness**, **harm brings estrangement**—\nThis is the **constant law**.\n\nThis is how one discerns the **division of similarity and difference**—\nTheir **categories** are the same.\n\nThe **division of similarity and difference** is examined using this.\nThus, walls collapse at their **cracks**,\nWood breaks at its **knots**—\nThis is their **division**.\n\nWalls and wood are destroyed because of **cracks and knots**,\nHow much more so in **human affairs**, where **changes arise from similarity and difference**!\nThus, it is said: This is their **division**.\n\nThus, **changes arise from affairs**,\nAffairs arise from **planning**,\nPlanning arises from **strategy**,\nStrategy arises from **debate**,\nDebate arises from **persuasion**,\nPersuasion arises from **advancement**,\nAdvancement arises from **retreat**,\nRetreat arises from **control**.\n\nUsing **control** to govern **affairs**,\nThus, all **affairs** follow **one path**,\nAnd all **methods** follow **one principle**.",

planning**.\nThose who perfect **strategy and planning** must first engage in **debate and persuasion**.\n**Debate and persuasion** must be weighed for their **correctness or error**,\nThus, **advancement and retreat** are required.\n\nOnce **dismissal and elevation** are determined,\n**Affairs** must be set as **precedent**,\nAnd then all **undertakings and methods**—what is there that does not arise from this?\nTheir **Dao and principles** are singular.\n\nThe **virtuous person** holds **wealth in light regard**,\nCannot be tempted by **gain**,\nBut can be moved to **expend**;\nThe **brave warrior** scorns **hardship**,\nCannot be deterred by **calamity**,\nBut can be urged to **embrace peril**;\nThe **wise strategist** grasps **principles** and understands **logic**,\nCannot be

**expend**,\nThen **wealth** can be preserved;\nIf you guide those who scorn **hardship** to **embrace peril**,\nThen **peril** can be **calmed**;\nIf you inspire those who grasp **principles** to

**twelve strategies** alone?\n\nThus, the **foolish** are easily **obstructed**,\nThe **unworthy** are easily **intimidated**,\nThe **greedy** are easily **enticed**—\nThis is **adapting to circumstances**.\n\nUsing these **three strengths**,\nAnd **countering** those **three weaknesses**,\nOne can **establish undertakings** and **achieve merit**.\n\nThe **planner** must **study circumstances** and **adapt accordingly**.\nThus, it is said: **Adapt to circumstances**.\n\nTherefore, the **strong** must **accumulate weakness**,\nAnd the **abundant** must **accumulate insufficiency**—\nThis is the **Dao of flexibility** in practice.\n\n**Softness overcomes hardness**,\nThus, **accumulating weakness** can bring **great strength**.\n**Straightness follows

strength**,\n**curving as straightness**,\n**insufficiency as abundance**,\nThis is the **Dao of flexibility** in action,\nThus, it is called: **The Way of Adaptive Practice**.\n\nTherefore, when advising a ruler whose **inner trust is distant** while **outerly close**,\nSpeak of the **inner**;\nWhen advising a subject whose **inner trust is close** while **outerly distant**,\nSpeak of the **outer**.\n\nIf **outerly close in appearance** but **innerly distant in truth**,\nThen speak of the **inner** to **remove internal estrangement**.\nIf **innerly close in truth** but **outerly

perception** to **establish** it.\n\n**Leverage their arguments** to **bind** them,\n**Exploit their momentum** to **complete** it—\nOnce **views** are shaped, there are **positions of approach or

**executed once**,\nThey **circulate endlessly** and **no one knows their end**.\n\nThus, it is said: **Indirectness flows without stopping**.\n\nTherefore, when advising a **sovereign**,\nOne must speak of **indirectness**,\nAnd when advising a **minister**,\nOne must speak of **privacy**.\n\nSpeaking of **indirectness** to a **sovereign**,\nThen **extraordinary merit** can be **achieved**;\nSpeaking of **privacy** to a **minister**,\nThen **self-preservation** can be **fully secured**.\n\nIf their **body is inwardly aligned** yet their **words outwardly distant**,\nThen the **superficial** become **estranged**;\nIf their **body is outwardly distant** yet their **words inwardly profound**,\nThen the **deeply placed** are **in peril**.\nIf one’s **body is inward** yet their **words outward**,\nThen the **leaky** are **again estranged**;\nIf one’s **body is outward** yet their **words deep**,\nThen the **urgent** are **again in peril**.\n\nDo not **force upon

**entrust** their **truthful emotions** to it.\nHence, it is said: **\"Truthful emotions are entrusted to it.\"**\n\nWhat can be **known** can be **employed**,\nWhat cannot be **known** is what the

is what the planner does not employ.\"**\n\nTherefore, **matters** are **valued** in **controlling others**,\nAnd not in being **controlled** by others.\n**Controlling others** is **holding

**hidden**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **open**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **sage** is **internally open** yet **externally hidden**,\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **internally hidden** yet **externally open**.\n\nThe **wise** find **matters** easy,\nThe **unwise** find **matters** difficult.\nFrom this perspective, **perishing** cannot be **preserved**,\nAnd **danger** cannot be **made secure**,\nYet it is said: **\"The Way of non-action values wisdom.\"**\n\nThe **wise** are **forgiving**,\nHence **matters** are easy for them;\nThe **foolish** are **suspicious**,\nHence **matters** are difficult for them.\nYet even the **unwise** may suffer **perishing** or **danger**,\nBecause their **matters** are difficult,\nThus the **virtuous** cannot **fully implement** their **strategies**—\nThen the **perishing** will **perish**, the **dangerous** will **remain dangerous**,\nAnd to **seek security** and **preservation** is not also difficult?\nNow, if one wishes to **preserve** the **perishing**,\nAnd **secure** the **dangerous**,\nThen none but the **wise** can do it.\nHence, it is said: **\"The Way of non-action values wisdom.\"**\n\nWisdom is **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **know**,\nYet can be **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **see**.\nWhat the **multitude** cannot **know**,\nWhat the **multitude** cannot **see**,\nOnly the **wise** can **employ** it,\nThus wisdom is **valued** above all.\n\nOnce **employed**,\nIf what is **seen** is **appropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **oneself**;\nIf what is **seen** is **inappropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **others**.\nIt is also said:\nWhen wisdom is **employed**, first for **oneself**, then for **others**,\nIf what is **seen** is **appropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **oneself**;\nIf what is **not seen** is **inappropriate**,\nChoose **matters** and act upon them—\nThis is to act for **others**.\nIt is like **Bo Le** teaching the **cherished** yet **discarding the unworthy**,\nAnd **rewarding the diligent** yet **abandoning the sluggish**.\n\nHence, the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** had **hidden words**,\nSaying: **\"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies in loftiness and depth.\"**\nThe **sage’s** **establishment** of the **Dao/Way** lies in **concealment** and **obscurity**,\nNot merely in **loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness**,\nBut in **moderation and rectitude** alone.\nIt is said that the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** values **hidden subtlety**.\nExamining the **ancient remnants**,\nVerifying that this **principle** exists,\nIt is said: **\"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies only in loftiness and depth,\nThe sage’s establishment of the Dao/Way lies only in concealment and obscurity.\"**\nWhat is **concealed** is **moderation and rectitude**,\nNaturally **harmonizing** with the **Dao/Way**,\nNot **exclusively** in **benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and sincerity**.\nHence, it is said: **\"Not merely in loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness.\"**\n\nWhen the **principles** of the **Dao/Way** are **understood** to this extent,\nThen one can **discuss** them.\nIt is said that the **planner** **grasps** the **principles** of the **Dao/Way**,\nIf one can **reach** this **extent** and **be fluent**,\nThen one can **speak** to the **highest** and **most profound** **levels**.\nFrom **obtaining** this,\nOne can then **discuss** the **far and near** **principles**#33.\n**Discuss** means **nurture**.\nIf one **obtains** this **Dao/Way’s principle**,\nThen one can **hold** the **great treasure**

**people**,\nOne must **entrust** to those who **doubt**,\nFor **good use** brings **blessing**,\nAnd **bad use** brings **calamity**—\n**Good** extends to **leading** them.\nOnly after **doubt** does one **entrust**,\nHence, it is said: **\"Again, entrust to those who doubt.\"**\n\n**Nearly** **people’s** **emotions**,\nWhen **blessing** is **employed**, are **good**,\nWhen **calamity** is **employed**, are **evil**.\nThe **principles** of **blessing** and **calamity** are **not yet clear**,\nThus **doubt** arises from them.\nHence, it is said: **\"Good use brings blessing, evil use brings calamity.\"**\n\nYet, those who **follow** after **doubt**,\nFirst **lead** them to **obtain** their **emotions**,\nThen can **determine** their **appropriateness or inappropriateness**.\n**Ultimately**, there is **no confusion** or **partiality**,\nOnly **benefit** can arise.\nRemove their **benefit**,\nAnd they will **not accept** it.\nThis is the **strange** **entrustment**.\n\n**Holding doubt** is **confusion**,\n**Not being upright** is **partiality**.\nThose who **follow** without **confusion** or **partiality**,\nThen the **doer** will have **success and guidance**,\nAnd **blessing and benefit** will arise.\nIf one **removes** their **blessing and benefit**,\nThen the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**.\n**Further**, **entrust** one’s **intentions** to the **strange**.\n\n**Tending toward novelty** and **changing constancy**,\nIs called **strange**#36.\nIf there is **benefit** in **goodness**,\nAnd one **conceals** and **entrusts** it to **evil**,\nThen they will **not accept** it,\nAnd it will **lead to estrangement**.\nIt is said that the **doubters**, **based on their benefit**,\nAnd **goodness**, yet the **followers** **conceal** their **benefit** and **goodness**,\nAnd **entrust** it to **evil**,\nThen the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**,\nAnd it will **lead to estrangement**.\n\nHence, there are those who **cause loss of benefit**,\nAnd those who **cause separation from harm**—\nThis is the **failure** of **matters**.\nIt is said that the **two upper** **methods**,\nSometimes **remove benefit** and **entrust to evil**,\nThe **doubters**, having **not accepted** their **followers**,\nThen what is **done** will **not succeed** in **guidance**.\nHence, there are **failures** in **loss of benefit** and **suffering harm**.\nAll these are the **failures** of **matters**.\n\nThe **sage** can **accomplish** their **matters** through **five methods**:\nThere are those who **employ** **open virtue**,\nThose who **employ** **hidden guile**,\nThose who **employ** **sincerity and trust**,\nThose who **employ** **concealment and obscurity**,\nAnd those who **employ** **moderation and simplicity**.\nThe **sage** excels in **adaptation and flexibility**,\nExhausts the **principles** of **things**,\nAnd **nearly** **matters** **are completed** through them.\nWhen **matters** are **completed** and **principles** are **established**,\n**Open virtue** is **employed**;\nWhen **emotions** are **hidden** and **words** are **false**,\n**Hidden guile** is **employed**;\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is **established** and **intentions** are **straightforward**,\n**Sincerity and trust** are **employed**;\nWhen **deceit** is **minor** and **harm** is **slight**,\n**Concealment and obscurity** are **employed**;\nWhen **following constancy** and **holding to the old**,\n**Moderation and simplicity** are **employed**.\n**Open virtue** is **encouraged** with **one word**,\n**Hidden guile** is **encouraged** with **two words**,\n**Moderation and simplicity** serve as the **pivot and mechanism** for **employment**,\nAnd the **fourth** is **subtle** yet **applied**.\n**Encourage** means **exhort**.\n**Open** is the **Dao/Way** of the **ruler**,\nHence what is **spoken** is **also encouraged** with

and compliance),\nEarth has the **principles of孤虚** (loneliness and emptiness),\nHumanity has the **divisions of通塞** (flow and obstruction).\nThose who hold **the Mandate of Heaven** must all know these.\n\nIn **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**—\nwhere is the **wandering star (荧惑)**?\nFor **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**,\nthere are **proper alignments of yin and yang**, **facing and turning**—\nthese are what **governors and officials must not fail to understand**.\nMoreover, **荧惑** is **Heaven’s legal star**—\nwhere it resides brings **disaster to the blue-green** (east),\nand its **auspicious or inauspicious influence is particularly pronounced**.\nThus it is said:\nEven **a sagely monarch** must **scrutinize where 荧惑 resides**.\nTherefore, one must also **know this**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Questions**\nThe sovereign who **questions** must **discern the Dao of the Three Powers (三才)**.\nThe **heart governs the nine orifices**,\nthe **ruler is the leader of the five senses**.\nThe **nine orifices move as the heart directs**,\nand the **five senses act as the ruler commands**.\nFor those who do **good**, the ruler **bestows rewards**;\nfor those who do **wrong**, the ruler **inflicts punishments**.\n**Rewarding the good and punishing the wrong** is the **great principle of governance**.\nThe ruler **follows the means by which governance is sought**—\nif he **responds accordingly**, there will be **no labor**.\n**Responding** means **granting what is requested**;\n**requesting** means **seeking without fulfillment**.\nIf **requests are met**, then **giving and receiving are not arbitrary**;\nif **what is given is received**, then **actions proceed without delay**.\nMoving in accordance with **nature**, what **labor is there**?\nThe **sage employs this**, and thus **can reward appropriately**.\nFollowing **principle**, it **endures without fail**.\nResponding to **requests**, there is **no greater joy**.\nEven without **jade and silk**, the **encouragement is as if rewards were given**.\nYet if **one acts against principle**, **disaster comes swiftly**.\nFollowing **principle**, it **endures long**—\nthis is the **sovereign who responds**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Response**\nThe sovereign who **responds** must **follow principle**.\nThe ruler **cannot be neglectful**.\nIf the ruler is **neglectful**, then **crafty ministers arise**, and **the people are oppressed and rebellious**.\n**Neglect** means **not comprehending the principles of things**.\nWhen **principles are not fully known**, then **crafty ministers cause chaos**.\n**Business (家)**—like **crafts**—becomes **unstable**,\nand **inner and outer affairs are disconnected**.\nHow can one **know what to open**?\n**Business (家)** here means **enterprise**.\nSince **crafty ministers are in chaos**, what they **undertake is unstable**,\nand **inner and outer affairs are blocked**—\n**obstacles abound on all paths**.\nHow can one **know what to open**?\nIf **opening and closing are mismanaged**, the **source of good governance is unseen**.\n**Opening and closing** refer to **牌阖** (the art of strategic disclosure and concealment).\nSince **牌阖’s principles are not applied**, the **source of good governance remains hidden**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Comprehensive Knowledge**\nThe sovereign who **comprehends** must **know the principles of all things**.\nOne is **long-sightedness (长目)**,\ntwo is **flying ears (飞耳)**,\nthree is **establishing clarity (树明)**.\nUsing **the eyes of all under Heaven to see**, hence **long-sightedness**.\nUsing **the ears of all under Heaven to hear**, hence **flying ears**.\nUsing **the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**, hence **establishing clarity**.\nWith **clarity**, one **knows a thousand li away**,\nand **what is hidden and subtle**—\nthis is called **penetrating all under Heaven**.\n**Delinquents cannot conceal their schemes** in their hearts.\nFor **using the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**,\nthere is **nothing unknown**—\nthus, **a thousand li away**, **hidden and subtle matters** are **all discerned**.\nSince **hidden things are exposed**, those who **plot evil** will **abandon their schemes in their hearts**.\nThus it is said: **They cannot but change**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Reverence**\nThe sovereign who **reveres** must **possess keen intelligence and refined thought**.\nFollowing **names to achieve reality**, one **remains secure and complete**.\nWhen **reality matches the name**, this is **security**.\n**Names and reality** generate each other,\nand **oppose each other in their essence**.\nFollowing **names to achieve reality**,\nand **from reality generating names**—\nwhen **names and reality are not deficient**, **essence resides within**.\nThus it is said:\n**When names are correct, reality arises from them**,\n**and reality arises from principle**.\n**Names are correct and naturally arise from reality**,\n**reality is established and naturally arises from principle**.\n**Principle arises from the virtue of names and reality**—\nif there is **no principle**, then **names and reality naturally generate virtue**.\n**Virtue arises from harmony**, and **harmony arises from correctness**.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Names**\nThe sovereign who **names** must **align with reality**.\nThe treatises *Zhuàn Wán* and *Guāng Luàn* are **lost**.\nSome have **filled in the gaps with Zhuāng Zhou’s *Zhuàn Kuāng*** in sequence.\n**Note:** The *Ghost Valley Classic* **exalts

without end, the **qi** is unfathomable in yin and yang—\nthus the **Way** of nurturing the **spirit** follows the Five Dragons.\n\nWithin nurturing the **spirit** are the Five **qi**:\nthe **spirit** is their sovereign,\nthe **heart** their dwelling,\n**virtue** their envoy.\nThe **Way** is where nurturing the **spirit** ultimately returns.\n\nThe Five **qi** are the **qi** of the Five Zang:\nthe **spirit**, the **hun**, the **po**, the **jing**, and the **zhi**.\nThe **spirit** dwells among the four others, hence it is their sovereign.\nThe **heart** can harmonize and contain, hence it is their dwelling.\n**Virtue** can subdue evil #1, hence it is their envoy #2.\nYet matters of nurturing should return to the **Way**.\n\nThe **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth,\nthe single thread of all things.\nIt is the source of all things, what heaven generates,\nencompassing boundless formless **qi**,\nexisting before heaven and earth,\nits form unseen, its name unknown—\nthus it is called **spirit-soul**.\nWithout name, it is the origin of heaven and earth.\nHence it is said: The **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth.\nThe **Way**’s initial generation is One,\nhence it is called the **single thread**.\nSpeaking of the **Way**’s mixed creation,\nhow yin and yang mold and refine—\nall things are born and transformed through it,\nheaven and earth generated by it,\nboundless and vast, its form unseen.\nAs for the **qi** of nurturing and growth,\nit precedes heaven and earth in formation,\ncannot be described by form or defined by name,\nyet it subtly permeates all things—\nthus it is called **spirit-soul**.\nTherefore, the **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**,\nthe single principle of transformation.\nThus **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.\n\nThe **heart** can attain the One,\nand thus its **wei** #4 arises.\n**Spirit-brightness** discerns the **Way** and is born—\nhence it is said: The **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**.\nIf the principle of transformation is not singular,\nthere are times when transformation does not occur—\nhence it is said: the **single principle of transformation**.\nFollowing principle to completion is called **virtue**.\nEach of the Five **qi** follows principle,\nand thus success can be achieved—\nhence it is said: **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.\n\nThe One is that which acts without action and is naturally so.\nThe **heart** can act without action,\nand its unfolding arises spontaneously—\nhence it is said: The **heart** attains the One,\nand thus its unfolding arises.\n\n**Wei** is the **Way** of the **heart’s qi**,\nthe path by which it dwells—\nthe **spirit** is its envoy.\nWhen the **heart’s qi** aligns with the natural **Way**,\nunfolding arises.\nThe unfolding’s **Way** comes from alignment #4—\nthus the **spirit** is its envoy.\n\nThe nine orifices and twelve dwellings are the gates and thresholds of **qi**,\nthe

**Sage** is wise, still relying on learning.\nLearning is not natural—\nhence it is said: knowing by analogy.\n\nThus, when people are born,\nthey all emerge from the transformation of things.\nSpeaking of people born together in heaven and earth,\nthey share the One.\nAfter emerging, they follow things and transform—\nthus they differ.\n\nKnowing by analogy at home,\nthere are doubts and confusions.\nThe orifices #5 pertain to the nine openings,\nyet their doubts also connect with unfolding.\nIf the **heart** lacks unfolding,\nthe **wei** is blocked.\nWhen it is unblocked,\nthe Five **qi** are nurtured—\nthe task is to dwell the **spirit**,\nthis is called transformation.\n\nWhen the **heart’s** unfolding is unblocked,\nthe Five **qi** are naturally

said: nurturing **zhi** follows the **Linggui**.\n\nNurturing **zhi** means harmonizing and unifying,\nso that the **heart-qi**’s thoughts are unrestricted.\nIt is said: the **heart-qi** is unrestricted.\nThus, one must nurture **zhi** to seek unification.\n\nWhen there is desire, **zhi** is stored and pondered.\n**Zhi** is the guide of desire.\nIf desires multiply, **zhi** scatters;\nwhen **zhi** scatters, it becomes weak;\nwhen **zhi** weakens, thoughts are not realized.\nThis shows that those who indulge desires cannot nurture **qi** and **zhi**,\nand thus their thoughts are not realized.\n\nWhen the **heart-qi** is unified, desires do not overwhelm;\nwhen desires do not overwhelm, **zhi** and intention do not weaken;\nwhen **zhi** and intention do not weaken, thoughts reach their essence.\nThis shows that those with few desires can nurture their **zhi**,\nand thus their thoughts reach their essence.\n\nWhen essence is realized, harmony and unification arise,\nand turbulent **qi** does not vex the chest.\nHarmony and unification mean all things are attuned and unrestricted,\nso turbulent **qi** naturally dissipates.\n\nThus, internally one nurtures **qi**,\nexternally one knows others.\nNurturing **zhi** makes the **heart** unified,\nknowing others clarifies their roles.\nA unified **heart** brings tranquility to the self,\nclear roles bring peace to the world.\n\nTo employ others, one must first know their nurtured **qi** and **zhi**,\ndiscern their strengths and weaknesses to nurture their **qi** and **zhi**,\nand observe their comfort to know their capabilities.\nTo employ others is called the **Wei** [卫] of nurturing **zhi**.\n\nNurturing **zhi** strengthens **qi**,\nneglecting it weakens **qi**.\nWhen strength and weakness manifest,\ntheir comfort and capabilities become known.\n\nThus, those skilled in nurturing **zhi** are those with few desires.\nIf **zhi** is not nurtured, the **heart-qi** is not steadfast;\nif the **heart-qi** is not steadfast, thoughts are not realized;\nif thoughts are not realized, **zhi** and intention are not firm;\nif **zhi** and intention are not firm, responses lack vigor;\nif responses lack vigor, **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** becomes hollow;\nif **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** is hollow, the **spirit** is forfeited.\nThis shows that losing the **spirit** begins with failing to nurture **zhi**.\n\nWhen the **spirit** is lost, the hair and beard wither,\nand the convergence of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit** is disjointed.\nWithered hair and beard signify a lack of clarity.\nConvergence refers to the interplay of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit**.\nIf the **spirit** lacks clarity, errors multiply,\nand thus the three cannot align in unity.\n\nThe beginning of nurturing **zhi** lies in self-cultivation.\nWhen self is cultivated, **zhi** and intention become firm.\nWhen **zhi** and intention are firm, **virtue** and power are undivided.\n**Spirit** and clarity must be steadfastly guarded to divide them.\nCultivation means few desires and a tranquil **heart**.\n\nWhen **virtue** and power are not divided,\n**spirit** and clarity are ever-present and steadfast.\nThus, **virtue** is refined and power moves all things.\n**Virtue** refined means dispersion is lost,\npower moving means one’s **virtue** can influence others.\nHence it is said: only then can they be divided.\n\nFirm intention follows the **Tengshe** [腾蛇].\nIntention has twists and turns,\nwhile the **Tengshe** bends and stretches,\nhence firm intention follows the **Tengshe**.\n\nFirm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.\nWhen intention is firm, **qi** is balanced;\nwhen **qi** is balanced, contemplation is precise.\nThus it is said: firm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.\n\nThe **heart** desires tranquility,\ncontemplation desires depth.\nA tranquil **heart** honors **spirit** and clarity,\ndeep contemplation perfects strategies.\nWhen **spirit** and clarity are honored, **zhi** cannot be disordered;\nwhen strategies are perfected, achievements cannot be obstructed.\n**Zhi** cannot be disordered, so strategies are fulfilled.\nAchievements cannot be obstructed, so the realm is secured.\n\nWhen intention and contemplation are settled,\nthe **heart** naturally becomes tranquil,\nand all actions are without error.\nThe **spirit**, when obtained, becomes concentrated.\nWhen the **heart** is tranquil,\nthings act without effort and follow their nature,\nrequiring no thought yet perceiving the profound.\nThus, even if the **heart**’s actions are without error,\nthe **spirit** naturally attains it.\nWhen attained, nothing remains unaccomplished.\nConcentration means fulfillment.\n\nIf **qi** is lodged externally,\nthe deceitful gain leverage,\nand false schemes cause confusion,\nso words no longer emanate from the **heart**.\nLodged means guest lodging—**qi** is not genuine, only borrowed.\nThus, the deceitful gain leverage,\nand false schemes cause confusion.\nSo words become mere chest utterances, no longer from the **heart**.\n\nThus, one must uphold **heart**-methods,\nguard the **True One** without transformation,\nand await the convergence of others’ intentions and contemplations,\nlistening and observing them.\n\nIt is said: the **heart** guards sincerity and clarity without loss,\nthe **True One** is steadfast and unchanging.\nOnly then, when interfacing with others,\ndo sincere and earnest individuals fully express their intentions,\nthe wise offer their strategies,\nand the enlightened present their plans,\nso that all align in harmony.\n\nUsing the **heavenly ear** to listen,\none can discern the omens of things.\nStrategies are the pivot of life and death;\nif contemplation does not converge,\nlistening will not be precise.\nIf observation fails, strategies are lost,\nand intention finds nothing to rely on—\nonly emptiness remains, devoid of substance.\nStrategies succeed, life is preserved;\nstrategies fail, death ensues.\nHence it is said: strategies are the pivot of life and death.\n\nIf contemplation does not align with things,\nlistening serves no purpose.\nIf listening is not precise,\nhow can observation succeed?\nContradicting observation while scheming—\nwhat else is this but failure?\nIf strategies fail, on what can intention depend?\nOnly hollow pretense remains, no longer sincere.\n\nThus, the contemplation of strategies\nmust begin with firm intention.\nFirm intention originates from the **heart**’s **Wei** [卫].\nWithout action yet seeking,\ncultivating tranquility for the five **zang** [脏],\nharmonizing the six **fu** [腑],\nso that **spirit**, **shen**, **hun**,
