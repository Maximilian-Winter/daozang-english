The Prolegomenon**\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was seated upon his lion throne within the Palace of Primordial Yang, amidst the Seven Jeweled Citadel of the Inconceivable Mountain. Surrounded by the Eight Mightiest Guardians, he sat in tranquil repose, his body and mind unmoving. For seven minor kalpas, he did not rise from his seat. Then, he emitted a great radiance, suffusing the ten directions and illuminating boundless lands—worlds as numerous as motes of dust—without exception.\n\nAt that moment, the perfected beings and sagely immortals across the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds and their countless lands were struck with awe and wonder. With one voice, they exclaimed: *\"Alas! By what karmic cause does the Celestial Worthy of Great Virtue in that realm emit such rare and wondrous light, a marvel beyond compare?\"*\n\nGazing from afar at the mountain, the assembled sages and immortals of those dust-mote worlds beheld the radiance—peerless, sublime, and unparalleled—so extraordinary no simile could suffice. Their hearts raced with reverence and longing, yet their lips could not utter a word. All yearned to hasten there.\n\nThen, the Celestial Worthy, in serene composure, stirred his thoughts. With the wisdom of knowing others’ minds, he perceived from afar the devout intentions of the sagely assembly in those distant lands. These beings were all of the highest rank, each worthy of deliverance.\n\nHe then raised his voice and proclaimed to the boundless lands in the ten directions: *\"You, perfected beings, have planted the roots of virtue in past lives, pure and undivided. You are my true children, fit to uphold the treasury of the Dao. I now wish to enter the Realm of Eternal Bliss. Ride upon this rare and wondrous radiance, and come together to this Dharma-seat, that you may encounter the unsurpassed Dharma I expound today.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this voice, the sagely assemblies of the innumerable lands in the ten directions rejoiced greatly. Mounting divine light, they soared through the void, crossing valleys and peaks, all of the highest rank, following the radiance to gather. These great assemblies—whose afflictions were emptied, whose nature of the Dao was luminously understood—were named: Pure Conduct Perfected, Wondrous Form Perfected, Jeweled Radiance Perfected, Shining Brilliance Perfected, Eloquent Wisdom Perfected, Universal Equality Perfected, Sagely Conduct Perfected, All-Pervading Understanding Perfected, Virtue-Filled Perfected, Life-Delivering Perfected, Salvation-Seeking Perfected, Guiding Master Perfected, Kindly Love Perfected, Insightful Form Perfected, Lofty Excellence Perfected, Supreme Intent Perfected, Illuminating Clarity Perfected, Treasury-Guarding Perfected, Upholding Protection Perfected, Equal Contemplation Perfected, Serene Samādhi Perfected, Unobstructed Perfected, Soaring Void Perfected, Constant Mindfulness Perfected, Transformative Penetration Perfected, Skillful Adaptation Perfected, Tranquil Samādhi Perfected, Wondrous Radiance Perfected, Wondrous Flower Perfected, Great Compassion Perfected, Wisdom-Light Perfected, Jeweled Canopy Perfected, and others.\n\nThese innumerable perfected beings, along with their retinues and the boundless hosts of celestial dragons and mighty spirit-kings, arrived as one at the Inconceivable Mountain, their numbers beyond reckoning. Like a fine mist or dense fog, they encircled the mountain thrice, gazing upon the Celestial Worthy. With measured and graceful steps, they bowed at his feet, inquired after his well-being, and then took their seats in due order.\n\nThen, the Celestial Worthy, suffusing the great assembly with his boundless compassion, softly intoned: *\"Perfected beings, you have amassed countless virtues over measureless kalpas to gather here today, encountering this rare radiance and beholding the unsurpassed and unprecedented Dharma. Your assembly is beyond conception. I now wish to enter the Realm of Eternal Bliss. If any among you have doubts, speak freely and ask.\"*\n\nThereupon, Pure Conduct Perfected rose from his seat, adjusted his robes, knelt with reverence, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: *\"We, this assembly, have ridden upon this rare radiance, desiring to ask questions. If you deign to grant us leave, we shall dare to present our inquiries.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: *\"Pure Conduct Perfected, you now skillfully open the way for this assembly, seeking the forms of the Dao. Ask freely, without hesitation. I shall distinguish and explain, resolving all your doubts.\"*\n\nHaving received permission, Pure Conduct Perfected’s heart leapt with joy, his delight boundless. He addressed the Celestial Worthy: *\"This bodily form, this radiance suffusing all—sublime, rare, and wondrous—stands peerless, surpassing a hundred thousand suns, beyond all conception. I reflect thus: such a bodily form is rare and unfathomable. If any being beholds this light, they are called a ‘perfected being,’ able to perceive all dharmas without harming their eye faculty.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: *\"Pure Conduct Perfected, it is just as you say. My bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being beholds the wondrous light of my form, their eye faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, contemplate their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being hears the wondrous light of my form, their ear faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, hear their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being smells the wondrous light of my form, their nose faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, discern their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my true form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being speaks of the wondrous light of my form, their tongue faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to distinguish all dharmas, articulate their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.\"*\n\nMoreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being touches the wondrous light of my form, their body faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to awaken to all dharmas, know their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.\n\nMoreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being knows the wondrous light of my form, their mind faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, realize their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.\n\nVirtuous and pure practitioners, my present bodily form emits boundless radiance. Suppose all the worlds in the ten directions—three thousand great thousandfold worlds—were pulverized into motes of dust, and each mote contained ten directions’ worth of boundless worlds. Even if all those boundless worlds were again ground into dust, and this dust were compared to the thousand-millionth part of my bodily light, it would not equal a single portion. Thus, in the boundless lands of the ten directions, if any being encounters this light, their six faculties become luminous and pure, penetrating without obstruction, able to comprehend all dharmas, discern their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas. Through this radiant adornment, all beings in the boundless, innumerable worlds of motes of dust attain the supreme, true, vajra-like wondrous form, the merit of radiance beyond conception. Even if one were to expound it for kalpas without end, it could not be exhausted.\n\nThereupon, the virtuous practitioners and the great assembly, hearing the Heavenly Worthy expound the wondrous radiance that benefits beings beyond measure, all raised their voices in unison, exclaiming in wonder, “Never before has such virtue been seen! The Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous bodily form, vast treasury of radiance, and adornment of blessings and grace are truly inexhaustible.”\n\nAt that time, Wondrous Form Perfected One, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse on the marvelous bodily radiance—unmatched in heaven or earth—approached, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Great Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I now behold your bodily form, its vast radiance pervading all worlds of motes of dust. Bodhisattvas from other lands and holy assemblies from the ten directions have gathered here, desiring to hear essential teachings. Yet this inconceivable city—is it a common sight? The Wheel of the Supreme Dharma you expound, with its wondrous and peerless radiance—what is its name? I pray you elucidate it, resolve our doubts, and grant this assembly the joy of clarity, that their minds may be at peace and their merit boundless.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, delighted and joyful, praised Wondrous Form: “Excellent, excellent! Wondrous Form Perfected One, you skillfully comprehend the nature of all dharmas, your mind unobstructed, and thus you inquire on behalf of the assembly. Listen well, for I shall now expound the marvelous, unfathomable, and unprecedented Dharma. From ancient times, I have revealed teachings for beings, yet never before has such vast radiance illuminated the worlds, nor have assemblies of holy ones from worlds as motes of dust gathered on this Inconceivable Mountain to hear this supreme Dharma. The unsurpassed scripture I proclaim is named *The Wondrous Grove* and also *The Victorious Practice*. Contemplate well this unsurpassed Mahāyāna sūtra of marvelous teachings.\n\nIf any person hears the name of this sūtra, wholeheartedly believes and receives it, reflects upon it with reverence, honors and praises it, comprehends its meaning, and expounds it to others, extolling the Great Dao, know that this person has planted good roots for countless kalpas and accomplished merit. Thus, in this very life, they hear this Mahāyāna sūtra of marvelous teachings. Such a one is the great compassionate father of all beings, awakening all and serving as the guide on the Way. All beings in the world should diligently cultivate merit here, single-minded and unwavering. The Mahāyāna merit attained by such a person is boundless and immeasurable, beyond all reckoning. Suppose all the grasses and trees in the ten directions’ three thousand great thousandfold worlds were cut into inch-long sticks and used to tally this person’s merit—even then, it could not be exhausted. Therefore, all of you who enter this jeweled city and hear the name of *The Mahāyāna Wondrous Grove* shall surely attain the supreme Way, enter eternal bliss, abide in the wondrous land, and accumulate towering merit, no different from mine.”\n\nThereupon, the great assembly, hearing the name of the sūtra, all awakened at once. They raised their hands, snapped their fingers, bowed in reverence, and exclaimed in praise.\n\nThen Treasure Radiance, holding his tablet in solemn dignity, approached, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “By good fortune, I have been permitted to attend this assembly. Earlier, I heard the exposition of the marvelous Mahāyāna sūtra of secret essential teachings, named *The Wondrous Grove* and *The Victorious Practice*. Yet my understanding is shallow; I cannot fathom it myself. Why, Heavenly Worthy, is this scripture named *The Wondrous Grove*? I pray you elucidate it, reveal its essential meaning, enlighten the assembly, benefit all, and resolve our doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Treasure Radiance Perfected One, today you have aroused great compassion, inquiring on behalf of the assembly for the true essential teachings, awakening those to come in ways beyond conception. Return to your seat, and I shall expound it clearly for all, that they may awaken and attain peace and bliss.\n\nThe *Mahāyāna Wondrous Grove Unsurpassed Scripture* I now proclaim possesses boundless, inconceivable merit. It is like a precious grove that bears fruit, nourishing all. Those who consume its blossoms and fruits attain golden radiance, wondrous in every aspect. Likewise, those who hear this sūtra, wholeheartedly receive it, and grasp its meaning attain wisdom, perfect clarity, and a wondrous bodily form. For this reason, it is no different from that grove. Moreover, in that precious grove, roots, trunks, stems, and leaves are all true script, and when a gentle breeze stirs, it emits resonant verses, their sound most marvelous.”\n\nShould those who hear it attain clear awakening to the Dao, my Dharma-form is then like that *Wondrous Grove*. If any sentient being stirs even the faintest aspiration, I manifest through the teaching of sound—its voice most wondrous. Whoever hears it immediately attains true perfection. For this reason, it is no different from that grove.\n\nMoreover, that *Wondrous Grove* has no known origin; it arises age after age, its lineage unbroken. My Dharma-form, like that precious grove, has no known origin; it appears age after age, its nature unbroken. For this reason, it is no different from that grove.\n\nFurthermore, the branches of that precious grove cast their shade, pervading the three thousand worlds without exception. My Dharma-form, with its virtue-shade, covers the three thousand great thousandfold worlds, boundless and all-encompassing. For this reason, it is no different from that grove.\n\nMoreover, that *Wondrous Grove* follows without intent, bending and rising with the wind. Though frost and snow may come, they cannot wither it. My Dharma-form is likewise: without intent, it accords with goodness, ever responsive to the stirrings of beings. Though afflictions, the three evil destinies, and karmic retribution may arise, they cannot cause harm. For this reason, it is no different from that grove.\n\nAll the multitudes of dust-mote realms, beholding my radiance—rare and surpassingly wondrous—crossed empty space and valleys to gather at the inconceivable mountain, cultivating my sublime causes and hearing these essential teachings. All who came, upon hearing this Mahāyāna teaching, found their wisdom renewed day by day, their merit boundless. For this reason, it is also called the *Sublime Cultivation*.\n\nThe assembly of Jeweled Light and others, immeasurable and boundless, upon hearing these essential words, all awakened, bowed together in reverence, and exclaimed their approval.\n\nThen Jeweled Light spoke these verses:\n\n*\"The peerless, skillful Lord of Great Compassion,*\n*Who vows not to abandon the four vast pledges to liberate beings,*\n*Manifests in wondrous, unmoving seated form,*\n*Emitting great radiance that illumines the ten directions.*\n\n*The boundless multitudes of dust-mote lands*\n*All behold the marvelous light of the Dharma-body.*\n*The assembly, pure and unified, of supreme beings,*\n*Is worthy to uphold the rare* Wondrous Grove Sūtra.\n\n*With minds that penetrate the boundless realms,*\n*They proclaim in a mighty voice: ‘True guests indeed!’*\n*I now wish to enter the Land of Eternal Bliss,*\n*And thus summon this assembly to receive and uphold it.*\n\n*The multitude, hearing this, rejoiced greatly,*\n*Flying through space and crossing valleys to arrive as one.*\n*With afflictions exhausted, all are free,*\n*Clearly understanding the Dharma-nature of the Mahāyāna gate.*\n\n*Surrounding and gazing, they listen without weariness,*\n*Advancing in order to bow to the Heavenly Worthy.*\n*Through measureless cultivation of great compassion,*\n*They proclaim the causes long practiced by this assembly.*\n\n*Thus they now hear this rare Dharma,*\n*How excellent this inconceivable gathering!*\n*With merit complete and practice fulfilled, they enter eternal bliss,*\n*And this morning, all doubts are resolved for the assembly.*\n\n*Thus the supremely wise and radiant one,*\n*Pure in conduct and right mindfulness, stirs the three thousand worlds.*\n*Riding this rare and wondrous seat of the great assembly,*\n*He invites all to voice their doubts and questions.*\n\n*Having received this sublime command,*\n*I dare to step forward and speak of this rare light:*\n*The skillful, compassionate discourse on the Dharma-form,*\n*With boundless radiance, uniquely venerable.*\n\n*Those who encounter this illumination attain purity in the six aspects,*\n*Unbroken by worldly dharmas, they realize the true body.*\n*Were all the dust-motes of countless worlds*\n*To be ground to finest particles, their number could not be reckoned.*\n\n*There was also a long-cultivating great being,*\n*Named Wondrous Form, who inquired of the sūtra’s name.*\n*Thus the great compassion descended as a rain of Dharma,*\n*Revealing the titles and chapters in full.*\n\n*Should one encounter and hear this name,*\n*Merit, virtue, and blessings will all be adorned.*\n*Were all the grasses and trees of the three thousand worlds*\n*To be cut into inch-long segments, their count could not be known.*\n\n*I, too, now ride this supreme blessing*\n*To ask further of the sūtra’s name and meaning.*\n*Having received the peerless secret of the Dharma King,*\n*All doubts regarding name and meaning are dispelled.*\n\n*We of this assembly, gathered as one,*\n*Rejoice in having heard the* Wondrous Grove Sūtra.\n*Thus we ascend to the boundless station,*\n*And all beings depart from the clamor of dust.*\n\n*Jeweled Light and the others—*\n*At that time, the great assembly, having heard the verses,*\n*Rejoiced greatly in their hearts, all awakened,*\n*And together bowed their heads before returning to their seats.*\n\n**Chapter Two: Contemplating the True Form**\n\nThen Radiant Realized One stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We of this assembly have heard the Heavenly Worthy speak of this wondrous, rare, and precious radiance. Should anyone in the future encounter this light, they will attain clarity and purity in the six senses, unbroken by worldly dharmas, and realize the true form. Yet this humble one, of inferior understanding, has not grasped this meaning. I do not know whether the worldly and the true form are one or distinct. If they are one, why is it called ‘the worldly’? If the worldly is true, why is it not called ‘true’? If they are distinct, having attained the true form, why is it said to remain unbroken? If the worldly remains unbroken, how can the true be attained? If the worldly remains unbroken yet the true is attained, it is like a seed: if the seed remains unbroken, from where do the sprout, stem, flower, and fruit arise? Thus, these two aspects remain unclear. I humbly beseech your instruction to resolve these doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, you skillfully guide beings to resolve these doubts. Return now to your seat, and I shall expound it for you. You ask whether the worldly and the true form are one or distinct. Now I ask you: in what you see, is it the seeing of dharma or the seeing of form?”\n\nRadiant Realized One answered: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, in the worldly and the true form, is there the seeing of dharma or the seeing of form?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, the true form and the worldly are fundamentally without distinction. It is only that beings have not yet fully penetrated them. They observe only the forms and have not yet seen the dharma. Thus they distinguish between the worldly and the true form, perceiving their forms as different. Now, with the eye of wisdom, observe the worldly form: the form itself is true. To fully understand the true form is called seeing the dharma. For this reason, the worldly is not broken, yet the true form is attained.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked further: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if the worldly is not broken yet the true form is attained, what is the form of the worldly that, when unbroken, is said to be the true form?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, the form of the worldly is none other than ignorance, attachment, clinging to views, anger, delusion, and all the afflictions—these are the form of the worldly.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked further: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if ignorance, attachment, anger, delusion, and all the afflictions are the form of the worldly, and it is said that without breaking them, the true form is attained—then does the true form still contain attachment? If attachment exists, is it true? Why then speak of cutting off all afflictions to attain the true form?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, what you say is indeed so: the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions. Now, when I speak of cutting them off, it is because beings have not yet seen the dharma and see only ignorance, attachment, delusion, anger, and afflictions. Thus, it is said that by cutting them off, the true form is attained. If one can know that the nature of afflictions is empty, that attachment has never truly existed, and that ignorance is eternally pure, then there is no dharma to cut off. From this, one should understand that the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions. The true form is without form; without form, there is nothing to attain. Ignorance is without dharma; without dharma, there is nothing to cut off. Without cutting off, there is nothing to attain—this is called cutting off afflictions. Without attaining, without cutting off—this is called attaining the true form. From this, one should understand that the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked again: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if the true form and afflictions are without duality, and because they are without duality, one speaks of attaining the true form—why then does one not speak of attaining afflictions as the true form, since they are also without duality?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, as I have just said, there are two kinds: one is the seeing of forms, and the other is the seeing of dharma. Those who see the dharma speak of attaining the true form; those who see forms speak of attaining afflictions. From this, one should understand that those who see the dharma constantly observe the wondrous source and thus attain the true form; those who see forms constantly observe the coarse edge and thus attain afflictions. If one can know that the nature of afflictions is empty and that no dharma has ever existed, and observes the source from the traces, this is called the seeing of dharma. If, on the other hand, one is obscured by ignorance and sees only afflictions, seeing from ignorance, this is called the true form.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If one sees afflictions as existing and also sees the true form, then both afflictions and the true form are afflictions. If one can know that these afflictions are not different from the true form, that the true form is without form, then afflictions and the true form are called the true form.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: You previously asked, ‘For example, if a seed is not broken, from where do the sprout, stem, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit arise?’ Now I ask you: Does the seed break, or does the sprout arise? If the seed breaks, then breaking is without cause; without cause, there is effect—this is impossible. If the sprout arises when the seed breaks, then breaking does not give rise to it; breaking as the cause of arising is also impossible. From this, one should understand that the seed, sprout, stem, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit are neither arising nor breaking, neither cause nor effect, neither not-cause nor not-effect. Afflictions and the true form are also thus: neither before nor after, neither one nor different, neither not-one nor not-different.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: You claim that the sprout arises when the seed breaks. Now I ask you: When the seed breaks and the sprout arises, does it arise at the time of breaking, before breaking, or after breaking? If it arises at the time of breaking, then breaking is arising; if arising is breaking, then arising does not arise. If it arises and then breaks, then arising is breaking; if breaking is arising, then breaking does not break. How can the sprout arise when the seed breaks? It is like shade breaking: when the shade breaks, the body does not arise. Without shade, there is no body—this is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that if the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise; without the seed, there is no sprout—this is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that breaking does not give rise to arising.\n\n“If one says that the sprout arises at the time of breaking, then it shares the same substance as breaking. How can it arise? It is like a single body: all the faculties share the same substance. How can the head break and the foot arise? The head breaking and the foot arising—this is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that when the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise; arising and breaking sharing the same substance is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that at the time of breaking, there is no arising.\n\n“If the sprout arises after breaking, then arising and breaking are separate. How can they be cause and effect? It is like a ruined seed: the seed has already perished, and perishing means no sprout. How can the sprout later arise from a ruined seed? From this, one should understand that there is no arising after breaking; the sprout arising after the seed has broken is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that after the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: Are the breaking of the seed and the arising of the sprout one, or are they different? If they are one, then breaking is opposed to arising. How can they share the same substance? If breaking is perishing, then there is no arising. How can breaking give rise to arising? If arising is not perishing, how can arising and breaking be different? If they are different, then they are not cause and effect. A non-cause giving rise to an effect is not reasonable. It is like space: space is not the cause of a rabbit’s horn. Space as a non-cause giving rise to a rabbit’s horn as an effect is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that difference also does not give rise to arising. How can there be arising?\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If the sprout arises before breaking, then the seed’s substance has not yet changed. If the sprout arises before the seed changes, then the sprout arises without cause. Without cause, there is effect; without the seed, there is the sprout—this is not reasonable. It is like a formless thing: its shadow does not arise. If the form has not yet arisen and the shadow arises, one should know that this shadow does not arise from the form. It is like sesame seeds: if the sesame seeds have not broken, the oil does not arise. From this, one should understand that there is no arising before breaking. How can there be arising?\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If the sprout arises after breaking, then the seed has already perished, and perishing means no cause. If the sprout arises after the seed has perished, then this sprout is just arising and is not an effect. The seed having perished and the sprout arising—this is not reasonable. It is like having no milk: curds do not arise. If there is no milk and yet there are curds, then the curds do not arise from the milk.”\n\nFrom this, one should know that there is no arising after breaking. How can there be arising? Examining the marks of arising, they are ultimately and eternally extinguished. Since they cannot be obtained, therefore there is no arising.\n\nAt that time, Biàncái rose from his seat, stepped forward with measured dignity, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “I have reflected that all sentient beings drift and surge in birth and death due to ignorance, craving, attachment, and false views. I have further reflected: from where do craving, false views, and ignorance arise, causing sentient beings to drift and surge in birth and death? Does the root of birth and death arise from the mind? From the eye? From the ear? From the nose? From the tongue? From within? From without? From existence? From emptiness? We here assembled truly do not yet understand. We beseech you to explain and resolve our doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Biàncái, true adept, excellent is this question. Return now to your seat, and I shall expound for you. The root of birth and death arises from emptiness and also from existence; from within and also from without; from the nose and also from the tongue; from the eye and also from the ear. Fundamentally, it does not arise, yet it also arises from the mind. Why is this? Because the mind-dharma is empty. Since the mind-dharma is empty, ignorance is also empty; since ignorance is empty, craving and attachment are also empty; since craving and attachment are empty, birth and death are also empty; since birth and death are empty, the eye-dharma is also empty; since the eye-dharma is empty, the ear-dharma is also empty; since the ear-dharma is empty, the nose-dharma is also empty; since the nose-dharma is empty, the tongue-dharma is also empty; since the tongue-dharma is empty, inner and outer are also empty; since inner and outer are empty, emptiness and existence are also empty. For these reasons, the root of birth and death arises from emptiness.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Biàncái: the dharma of emptiness is fundamentally empty, and the mind-dharma is also empty. How can the empty dharma give rise to the empty mind-dharma? Since the mind-dharma is empty, it arises from emptiness. This would be like the east, which is fundamentally empty, giving rise to the emptiness of the west. Since you know the east is fundamentally empty and does not give rise to the emptiness of the west, you should know that the dharma of emptiness, being fundamentally empty, does not give rise to the mind-dharma. Since the mind-dharma is empty, it does not arise from emptiness. You should know that the mind-dharma, its mark fundamentally empty, does not give rise to ignorance. Since you know ignorance is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the mind, you should know that ignorance, being fundamentally empty, does not give rise to craving and attachment. Since you know craving and attachment are fundamentally empty and do not arise from ignorance, you should know that craving and attachment, being empty, do not give rise to false views. Since you know false views are fundamentally empty and do not arise from craving and attachment, you should know that false views, being empty, do not give rise to the mind-dharma. Since you know the mind-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from false views, you should know that the mind-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the eye-dharma. Since you know the eye-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the mind, you should know that the eye-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the ear-dharma. Since you know the ear-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the eye, you should know that the ear-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the nose-dharma. Since you know the nose-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the ear, you should know that the nose-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the tongue-dharma. Since you know the tongue-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the nose, you should know that the tongue-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the inner dharma. Since you know the inner dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the tongue, you should know that the inner dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the outer dharma. Since you know the outer dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from within, you should know that the outer dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the dharma of existence. Since you know the dharma of existence is fundamentally empty and does not arise from without, you should know that the dharma of existence, being empty, does not give rise to the dharma of emptiness. Since you know the dharma of emptiness is fundamentally empty and does not arise from existence, you should know that the dharma of emptiness, being empty, does not give rise to birth and death. Since you know birth and death are fundamentally empty and do not arise from emptiness, you should know that birth and death do not give rise to birth and death.\n\nAll conditioned afflictions—from this, you should know that conditioned birth and death, in which sentient beings drift and surge, are like clouds in the void, like forms in space, like echoes in a valley, like the moon in water, like reflections in a mirror, like mirages in the heat, like sparks in lightning, like hearing for the deaf, like seeing for the blind, like speech for the mute, like a two-headed crane, like a three-legged chicken, like fur on a tortoise, like horns on a hare—within these are ignorance, craving, attachment, and false views. The root of birth and death is also thus: ultimately all is empty, beyond discourse. It is like the extinction of a lamp, which cannot be sought. The fundamental emptiness of birth and death is also thus—like a great raging fire, like four venomous snakes, not to be approached. The dharma of birth and death is also thus. You and others should cultivate this contemplation, and you will attain the unconditioned and transcend birth and death.”\n\nThereupon, Biàncái and the assembly, having heard these essential words, rejoiced and leapt with joy, exclaiming that they had never before heard the like. The great assembly as one voice praised it as excellent and spoke these verses:\n\n“Supreme Compassionate Venerable,\nSkillfully expounding the true mark.\nThe root of worldly afflictions\nIs the cause of supreme wisdom.\nSentient beings, not yet understanding,\nAre taught to sever craving and anger.\nIf one knows it is fundamentally non-existent,\nBirth and death become the Dao-ground.\nThe nature of ignorance is eternally extinguished,\nAfflictions are like the sound of wind.\nThe wisdom-eye should be purified,\nDharma-insight clears deep darkness.\nFundamentally, there is no dual mark,\nCoarse and subtle—trust opens the cause.\nIf one can discern non-duality,\nThe three realms are inconceivable.\nAbiding in the mind of true mark,\nThe Dao-ground severs anger and craving.\nThe seed has never perished,\nSprout and stem truly do not arise.\nIf there is prior existence not from a cause,\nFrom prior non-existence, what arises?\nIn the three times, one discerns the dharma of arising—\nThe seed is truly not the cause.\nIts own essence has never existed,\nFrom where do sprout and stem arise?\nBiàncái, unsurpassed adept,\nSkillfully inquires into the cause of birth and death.\nBoundless is your great compassion,\nFor the assembly, you fully expound.\nIgnorance and birth and death\nAre like echoes in an empty valley.\nWhat the deaf and blind hear and see—\nIn the world, it is truly not so.\nThe wise contemplate birth and death\nAs a great magician’s illusion.”\n\nClay figurines never run,\nWooden roosters never soar in the sky.\nIf one can fathom this principle,\nAll becomes inconceivable.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised the great assembly, saying: “Excellent, excellent! All of you here today have heard this rare Dharma, fully comprehending the true mark, just as it has been expounded. Riding my discourse today, I proclaim it for future generations, so that all beings may come to understand it as clearly as you do now.”\n\nAt that time, the great assembly bowed their heads in reverence and praised its excellence.\n\n**Chapter Three: Discerning the Right from the Deviant**\n\nThen, the Perfected of Universal Equality rose from his seat, stepped forward, and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “I have reflected upon the bodily marks of the Heavenly Worthy—radiant, surpassing, subtle, and inconceivable—like the Diamond King shattering all obstacles. Your wisdom is luminous and clear, all habitual tendencies forever eradicated. You stand alone and steadfast, entering the inconceivable city.\n\nI now wish to ask a question, yet dare not presume to speak. I pray that out of great compassion, you will bestow the guidelines, the stages of cultivation, and their meaning, so that future generations may behold the true and real.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent, Perfected of Universal Equality! You skillfully benefit beings of the future and have raised this question to awaken the deluded. Return to your seat, and I shall expound for you.\n\nAll questions fall into two kinds: the right question and the deviant question. The right question is akin to the Dao; the deviant question is a retinue of Māra.\n\nUniversal Equality asked again: “What constitutes the right? And what the deviant?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “If one asks because of conditioned existence or because of unconditioned existence, this is a deviant question. To ask neither because of conditioned existence nor because of unconditioned existence—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing arising or because of seeing cessation, each is a deviant question. To ask without seeing arising or without seeing cessation—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing abiding or because of seeing decay, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing abiding or without seeing decay—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing transgression or because of seeing merit, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing transgression or without seeing merit—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing purity or because of seeing defilement, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing purity or without seeing defilement—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing ‘is’ or because of seeing ‘is not,’ this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing ‘is’ or without seeing ‘is not’—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing closeness or because of seeing distance, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing closeness or without seeing distance—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing emptiness or because of seeing existence, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing emptiness or without seeing existence—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing suffering or because of seeing joy, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing suffering or without seeing joy—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing sageliness or because of seeing ordinariness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing sageliness or without seeing ordinariness—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing good or because of seeing evil, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing good or without seeing evil—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing giving or because of seeing stealing, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing giving or without seeing stealing—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing precepts or because of seeing transgression, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing precepts or without seeing transgression—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing long or because of seeing short, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing long or without seeing short—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing nobility or because of seeing baseness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing nobility or without seeing baseness—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing gain or because of seeing loss, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing gain or without seeing loss—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing deviance or because of seeing rightness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing rightness or without seeing deviance—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing a question or because of not seeing a question, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing a question or without seeing the absence of a question—this is a right question.\n\nAll such categories possess right and deviant. The right and deviant all arise from the mind. What the mind generates is all inverted: seeing existence where there is none, seeing nonexistence where there is none, seeing arising where there is no arising, seeing cessation where there is no cessation, seeing abiding where there is no abiding, seeing decay where there is no decay, seeing transgression where there is no transgression, seeing merit where there is no merit, seeing purity where there is no purity, seeing defilement where there is no defilement, seeing ‘is’ where there is no ‘is,’ seeing ‘is not’ where there is no ‘is not,’ seeing closeness where there is no closeness, seeing distance where there is no distance, seeing emptiness where there is no emptiness, seeing existence where there is no existence, seeing suffering where there is no suffering, seeing joy where there is no joy, seeing sageliness where there is no sageliness, seeing ordinariness where there is no ordinariness, seeing good where there is no good, seeing evil where there is no evil, seeing giving where there is no giving, seeing stealing where there is no stealing, seeing precepts where there are no precepts, seeing transgression where there is no transgression, seeing long where there is no long, seeing short where there is no short, seeing nobility where there is no nobility, seeing baseness where there is no baseness, seeing gain where there is no gain, seeing loss where there is no loss, seeing deviance where there is no deviance, seeing rightness where there is no rightness, seeing a question where there is no question, seeing seeing where there is no seeing—all such views are utterly false, like an illusion, like a dream. Only death is real.\n\nWhy is this so? All dharmas are without mind. To see dharmas with a mind is called deviant seeing. If one can know that all dharmas are without mind and does not generate a mind to see, this is called right seeing. Therefore, know that all questions arising from a mind are deviant questions; only questions without a mind are called right questions.\n\nFor this reason, I do not now instruct all beings to sever afflictions in order to attain the true mark. I merely wish to liberate those beings enmeshed in delusion, and thus expound the two meanings of affliction and the true mark.”\n\nTruly, there is no birth and death, and thus the true mark may be attained. Why is this so? All dharmas are pure, fundamentally without dual aspects, without coming or going. Therefore, I do not now instruct beings to sever afflictions in order to attain the true mark. Though afflictions are spoken of, there are in truth no afflictions to be severed; though constant bliss is spoken of, there is no constant bliss to be longed for. Since there are no afflictions, beings do not lose the true mark; since there is no true mark, I do not now abandon afflictions. If in the latter age there is one who can generate this thought, embody and comprehend the true and real, this is called the Great Vehicle, the cultivation of the true and right practice.\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, all present rejoiced greatly in their minds, and the countless multitudes, of one body with the formless, together entered the true and real. Then the Bodhisattva of the Sagely Practice addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “In the future age, if there are beings who generate a mind of ‘having’ in regard to dharmas, the Great Dao will forever be obscured and will not circulate in the world. If one sees the Three Clarities as a pure realm and longs for it in the mind, such a person, though cultivating merit for kalpas unending, will not attain liberation. Why is this so? The realm of the Three Clarities is called quiescence and extinction, far removed from all dust, not receiving any attachments. If one generates a mind of seeing, one falls into deviant views, does not cultivate the right practice, and is said to have forever lost the supreme Dharma.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Venerable praised the Sagely Practice, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Truly, it is as you have said. Sagely and true one, you have planted the root of virtue in the past, clearly understood the true mark, and attained unimpeded penetration. Thus, today you resolve the doubts of the assembly—this is truly profound and essential. If there is one who, in regard to dharmas, generates a mind of ‘having,’ abandons the defiled realm to seek the bliss of the Three Clarities, forsakes the body of sentient beings to seek the mark of the true Dao, desires to sever afflictions and enter the formless, or seeks to leave all views to attain quiescence and extinction—such a one, I say, is a person of great deviant views and arrogant contempt. It is like a foolish person who, fearing heaven and earth, wishes to flee, yet wherever they go, they do not leave the great earth. Beings are likewise: fearing the body of birth and death, they hastily abandon the three realms, generating a mind of aversion and separation. Yet the body they attain does not depart from birth and death. Such beings have not yet seen the Dharma or sought the mark of the true Dao. Deeply and truly, they are to be pitied.\n\nThe mark of the true Dao is called non-action, without arising or ceasing, neither existent nor non-existent, neither long nor short, neither great nor small, neither form nor mind. To embody this mark is called cultivating the true and right practice of the Dao.”\n\nAgain, he addressed the Sagely Practice: “Worldly beings, their ignorance and hindrances heavy, have the true Dao within their bodies yet cannot perceive it. It is like a foolish person running east and west in search of the color of empty space, yet unable to see that form itself is emptiness. All in the world are likewise: their minds and natures gallop about, desiring to seek the true Dao, yet they do not know that body and mind are the true Dao. It is like a foolish person who sees only bamboo and wood but does not know fire, abandoning the wood to seek fire, not knowing that fire is already within the wood. All in the world are likewise: they abandon the body to seek the Dao, yet do not know the Dao is already within the body. Abandoning wood to seek fire is like a foolish person abandoning form to seek shadow or forsaking sound to seek echo, not knowing that form is the root of shadow and sound the source of echo.\n\nKnow therefore that the deviant views of the world, with their blazing afflictions, are like a forest of thorns, like a thicket of caltrops—one cannot draw near. You, this assembly today, riding the teaching I now proclaim for the future, should know that the Three Clarities are not separate from afflictions, and that the Great Dao is not elsewhere. Simply observe body and mind, cultivate the right practice, and naturally attain liberation, forever leave afflictions behind, and constantly abide in the Three Clarities. Reflect well upon this, and you will naturally be at peace and joyful.”\n\nThereupon, the Sagely Practice again addressed the Heavenly Venerable of Great Virtue, saying: “How can you say that all beings are the true Dao, yet also command the cultivation of the right practice to attain peace and joy? If they are already the Dao, why must they cultivate? It is like a bird with wings—why must it practice flying?”\n\nJust as scaly creatures need not practice swimming, clouds ascend and rain descends without study or learning. If all beings are already the true Dao, why must they cultivate practice to attain peace and joy? I pray you resolve this doubt.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied, saying: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, excellent is this question. As I have just said, the true Dao and beings are like fire within wood—neither one nor different, neither identical nor separate. The wood contains fire, yet wood is not fire; without wood there is no fire, yet fire is not wood. Wood is not fire, thus they are not one; fire does not depart from wood, thus they are not different. From this you should know that the true Dao and beings are neither one nor different, neither identical nor separate. Beings contain the Dao, yet beings are not the Dao; without beings there is no Dao, yet the Dao is not beings. Beings are not the Dao, thus they are not one; the Dao does not depart from beings, thus they are not different.\n\nFrom this you should know: if you seek fire, seek it within wood, not within ice; if you seek the Dao, seek it within the body, not elsewhere. To seek fire in ice or the Dao in other realms—even if your strength could move mountains, your merit drain the sea, the more strenuously you exert yourself, the more wondrous your efforts, after kalpas of practice, you will only drift farther from the Dao. Therefore, I now tell all beings: if you wish to obtain fire, you must apply human effort, prepare the drilling tools, and move your hands with force—only then will you see fire. For beings learning the Dao and cultivating the right practice, it is likewise: you must accumulate good merit, prepare the seeds of wisdom, observe within this body, and move the spirit of the mind—only then will you see the Dao. For this reason, I command beings to cultivate the correct and true, that they may attain peace and joy.\n\nFish need not practice swimming in empty water, yet they must exert themselves to ascend and descend; birds do not take empty flight or depart through water—true Dao and beings are not of this kind. Clouds ascend and rain descends without awareness or intention, without study or learning. Such phenomena belong to the mundane world and cannot be compared to the true Dao. Reflect well upon this, and you will naturally gain understanding.”\n\nThereupon, Sagely Practice again addressed the Heavenly Venerable of Great Virtue, saying: “When beings seek the Dao within the body rather than elsewhere, is emptiness within the body? Or does emptiness lie elsewhere?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, thirty-six questions of this kind are called perverse views.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked: “Great Virtue Heavenly Venerable, do you see fire in wood and water in ice, yet no fire in ice and no water in wood?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, for those who have not yet awakened, I conform to worldly appearances.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked the Heavenly Venerable: “Is there fire in ice? Is there water in wood?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, in empty space you see all forms and images.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked the Heavenly Venerable: “In seeking fire in ice or water in wood, is this the correct perspective?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, to seek the Dao within the body, extinguish all conditioned actions, and thereby attain liberation—this is not the correct path. If you seek the true Dao, simply observe the body; if you seek empty space, simply observe all phenomena. Observe the true aspect of the body: the Dao arises from the body, also from the mind, from the eyes and ears, from the nose and tongue, from the four great elements, from the hundred parts of the body. Observe the true aspect of things: emptiness arises from heaven, also from earth, from the self, from others, from water and fire, from grasses and trees, from the ten directions, from the myriad things.\n\nFor this reason, I expound this scripture to deliver the dust-mote multitude, yet I have never seen a single being who has received deliverance. Why? My eye is empty, beings are also empty—emptiness is without distinction. Because I distinguish emptiness, my eye’s wisdom is bright and pure, able to observe all things with unimpeded penetration. I observe the three thousand great thousand worlds, past and future, all beings—all have already received deliverance. For this cause, I say that within emptiness all infinite forms and images are complete.”\n\nThereupon, Sagely Practice and the great assembly, having heard these essential words, all rose to bow and spoke in verse:\n\nPossessing all wisdom,\nExcellent and wondrous Venerable One,\nYou expound this subtle and marvelous Dharma,\nRight and wrong most clearly distinguished.\nInverted views give rise to grasping and rejection,\nThe correct and true are neither existent nor nonexistent.\nThe mind’s dharmas are not originally present,\nYet with mind, false delusions arise.\nSkillfully conforming to all phenomena,\nWhen phenomena cease, perfect is the correct and true.\nThe correct and true have no further characteristics,\nAfflictions are truly originally empty.\nBeings do not differ from the Dao,\nAll views are without conditioned action.\nWith mind desiring to cut off and sever,\nGreat practice forever does not proceed.\nThe Three Clarities are not distantly wondrous,\nQuiescence and extinction lie within the breast.\nIf you produce the mind’s view,\nWisdom’s fangs will forever be shattered.\nThe Heavenly Venerable expounds this kind,\nCalled the arrogant and indolent.\nLike one who fears the great earth,\nHastening to flee and hide the body,\nThough you race a thousand leagues in a day,\nWithout earth there is no place to contain the body.\nDisdaining the body to seek the Dao,\nSeeing the Dao yet not forgetting the body,\nClinging to the body, the Dao is distant,\nBirth and death become instead your kin.\nThe utmost true is without arising or ceasing,\nThe Great Dao is apart from severance and constancy.\nIf you embody this wondrousness,\nYou are called one who cultivates the correct and true.\nBeings, burdened by heavy obstructions,\nLose the Dao and see only the body.\nTaking the body to seek the Dao,\nObserving form yet not knowing emptiness.\nLike the foolish seeing wood,\nNot knowing whence fire comes.\nEcho and shadow are not far removed,\nForm and sound are the root source.\nPerverse views give rise to afflictions,\nA thicket of thorns and brambles.\nWith views arise poison and harm,\nWounding the body—how is this different?\nThe Three Clarities are afflictions,\nThe Great Dao surely lies within this body.\nLike fire within wood,\nWith drilling tools and human effort.\nAccumulate goodness to seek the true Dao,\nPeace and joy will meet the correct and true.\nExpounding the scripture to deliver all,\nIts measure cannot be reckoned.\nIlluminating the original coming and going,\nAll who receive deliverance are but empty claims.\nEmpty space is surely without bounds,\nBeings—where do they find refuge?”\n\nMy eye is originally pure and clear,\nPenetrating the great thousandfold worlds.\nPast and future, present as well—\nAll are but motes of dust.\nThrough boundless kalpas without measure,\nI have already realized the true and correct.\n*Great Vehicle Wondrous Forest Sutra, Scroll the Upper Concludes*\n*Great Vehicle Wondrous Forest Sutra, Scroll the Middle*\n*Chapter Four: Contemplating the Body*\n\nAt that time, the Great Compassionate Perfected One rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Our assembly now reflects in our hearts that the teachings Your Holiness has expounded are subtle and wondrous, difficult to fathom. The true nature of afflictions is without distinction, its meaning profound and obscure. We, this assembly, have personally received your sacred decree and had our doubts resolved. Yet for future beings whose minds have not yet awakened, upon hearing this great Dharma, how may they come to understand it? Your Holiness has said that the Three Clarities are not distant, that the Dao resides within this very body. When all beings hear that the Dao is within the body but do not comprehend this meaning, their doubts only deepen. By what method may their doubts be dispelled, allowing all beings to abide in peace and joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent, Great Compassionate Perfected One! Through boundless kalpas, you have borne the suffering and afflictions of all beings, and thus today you have fittingly raised this question. Now return to your seat, and I shall expound for you, so that all future beings of sincere heart may attain peace and joy. If there are beings who enter my Dharma-gate and hear my wondrous teachings yet cannot fully comprehend them, they should be consoled with three methods to settle their minds and awaken understanding. What are these three methods?\n\nFirst, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet believe and accept it, they should cultivate the Five Precepts to discipline their bodies, preventing dissipation. Let the five roots be bright and pure, their natures harmonized, fearless in the Dharma, and capable of receiving it.\n\nSecond, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet fully understand it, they should apply the Three Samadhis to stabilize their minds, preventing distraction. Let their minds be upright and tranquil, their natures and qi harmonized, fearless in the Dharma, and capable of reciting and upholding it.\n\nThird, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet fully perceive it, they should pervade body and mind with the Six Wisdoms, removing all obstacles. Let their inner and outer be bright and pure, body and mind serene and clear, wisdom penetrating empty space, and the true nature be clearly seen. Fearless in the Dharma, they will be capable of entrustment.\n\nWhat are the Five Precepts?\n\nFirst, if the eye-root clings to forms, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those forms as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s eye-root is no different from them.\n\nSecond, if the ear-root clings to sounds, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those sounds as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s ear-root is no different from them.\n\nThird, if the nose-root clings to fragrances, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those fragrances as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s nose-root is no different from them.\n\nFourth, if the tongue-root clings to flavors, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those flavors as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s tongue-root is no different from them.\n\nFifth, if the body-root clings to dharmas, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those dharmas as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s body-condition is no different from them.\n\nWhat are the Three Samadhis?\n\nFirst, if a being’s mind is scattered and clings to many things, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as illusion, dream, mirage, or lightning—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, the mind will not scatter. This is called *peaceful samadhi*.\n\nSecond, if a being’s mind is scattered and prone to anger, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as echo, resonance, mist, or cloud—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, there will be no anger. This is called *Dharma samadhi*.\n\nThird, if a being’s mind is scattered and prone to delusion and arrogance, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as wind, space, bubble, or shadow—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, there will be no delusion or arrogance. This is called *decisive samadhi*.\n\nWhat are the Six Wisdoms?\n\nFirst, having understood that forms change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the eye-root is purified. This is called *seeing wisdom*.\n\nSecond, having understood that sounds change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the ear-root is purified. This is called *hearing wisdom*.\n\nThird, having understood that fragrances change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the nose-root is purified. This is called *penetrating wisdom*.\n\nFourth, having understood that flavors change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the tongue-root is purified. This is called *discerning wisdom*.\n\nFifth, having understood that all dharmas change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the body-condition is purified. This is called *awakening wisdom*.\n\nSixth, having understood that the Three Poisons change with time, momentary and impermanent, with no obstructions, the mind-root is purified. This is called *penetrating wisdom*.\n\nGreat Compassionate Perfected One, in the latter age of the world, all beings who wish to enter the Dharma-gate should apply these three methods to settle their minds, removing all fear. Once fear is gone, they will naturally abide in peace and joy, body and mind firm and unshaken. The Six Wisdoms will be bright and pure, penetrating without obstruction, and all in the world will be perceived as wondrous forms. From this, know that one may realize the true nature without severing afflictions.\n\nYou, this assembly, must not lightly show this Dharma to the unworthy. A single moment of doubt or slander will prevent rebirth for ten thousand kalpas.”\n\nBeware, beware most carefully.\n\nAt that time, Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We in this assembly, having heard the Great Dharma, leap with joy in body and mind, finding bliss and peace, attaining fearlessness beyond all thought. Yet some doubts remain obscure, and we dare not presume to present them. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to deign to grant us a hearing.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, if you have doubts like a net, ask freely whatever you wish. I shall distinguish and explain, revealing what has not yet been heard.”\n\nThereupon, Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Great Virtue, Dharma King, why do you say that if there are beings who wish to enter the Dharma-gate, they should apply these three methods to settle their minds and attain peace and joy? Are all beings originally possessed of a deviant mind? If they have a mind, its nature is already fixed—how then can you say that by these three methods one may settle the mind and attain fearlessness? If they originally have no mind, how can it be settled? And why now do you speak of applying these three methods to settle the mind and attain stability?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent is this question. Listen carefully, listen carefully. I shall distinguish and explain, so that all in future ages may resolve their doubts. Perfected One of Pervasive Attainment, the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising. How is the mind-Dharma of all beings like arising? Do all beings originally have arising? If there is arising, from whence does it come? Do all beings originally have no arising? If there is no arising, why do we see arising bodies? You in this assembly—do you see the body as existing or as non-existing?”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration replied: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, we in this assembly see the body as non-existent. Why? Because the prior form perishes, and the subsequent form arises.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma is likewise. It is neither existent nor non-existent, arising and perishing moment by moment. The prior mind perishes and does not become the cause of the later; the later mind arises and is not the fruit of the prior. Therefore, I say that the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if you say that the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising, and arising-Dharma sees arising, then arising-Dharma is like the mind—can the mind be seen?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma can be seen. If you wish to see the mind-Dharma, it is like seeing arising. Arising has no fixed location; if you wish to see the mind-Dharma, it likewise has no fixed location.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if you say that the mind-Dharma is like arising, both without fixed location, how then can it be settled to attain peace and joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, can the body be settled?”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration answered: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, the body-Dharma, moment by moment, cannot be settled.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma is likewise—it cannot be settled.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if it cannot be settled, why did you earlier say to settle the mind and attain joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, because one sees the body as existing, one is enabled to settle it. Once settled, one knows the mind as neither existent nor non-existent. Neither existent nor non-existent—this is called attaining the true mind, and thus one attains peace and joy. Therefore, I now apply these three methods to settle the mind and attain peace and joy.”\n\nWhen the great assembly heard the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, all awakened to understanding. With one voice, they praised it as excellent and spoke these verses:\n\nThe Dharma King, Great Compassionate Worthy of the Three Realms,\nSeated upright in body, beyond all thought—\nFor the multitudes, he expounds this subtle, wondrous Dharma,\nOpening the supreme cause for all beings’ awakening.\nThus we know afflictions are one with true form,\nUnderstanding the Dao-field as equal to ignorance.\nIn the beginner’s mind, not yet purified,\nGreat compassion employs skillful means to dispel deep darkness.\nThus the Heavenly Worthy expounds and reveals,\nThe wondrous grove of three methods enlightening the beginner’s mind.\nThe Five Precepts observe the body, the five roots become still;\nThe Three Samādhis gather the mind, the Three Poisons are removed.\nThe One Vehicle pervades the three thousand lands,\nThe Six Wisdoms are cultivated anew, the nine nights purified.\nAwakening to the illusory dream as not truly existent,\nYet the non-truly-existent Dharma is also not empty.\nThus one dwells in the Land of Peace and Joy,\nWhere neither emptiness nor illusory existence is ever absent.\nThis abiding is not apart from the human realm,\nWhere wondrous forms in the world are most marvelous.\nWhat was once unenlightened was called affliction;\nNow, in great awakening, it is named the True Immortal.\nOne body with two names, seen according to the perceiver—\nThe good sees two names as one body.\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration, supreme and unsurpassed,\nHolds this earnest devotion ever in mind.\nHe asks of all beings’ arising and attainment:\nDo they have a mind? Is the mind without mind? How is it fixed?\nNow, by the great compassion of the supreme secret,\nWe know beings have a mind, and the mind is like arising.\nThe arising-Dharma is neither non-existent nor existent;\nThe mind that has a mind is neither existent nor non-existent.\nPrior arising and later arising do not continue;\nHaving a mind and having no mind do not condition each other.\nSeeing the body as non-existent is like the mind-Dharma;\nSeeking the mind as non-absent is like seeing the body.\nIf one can know body and mind as neither identical nor different,\nHow can one cling to body and mind as definitely existent or non-existent?\nSpeaking of the two extremes, there is no duality;\nForgetting the one middle, where is the center?\nIn the two extremes and the middle, nothing is possessed—\nProfound and subtle, wondrous beyond all thought.\nThus body and mind can be settled,\nAnd the true mind abides forever through ten thousand kalpas.”\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy had heard the verses spoken by the great assembly, he addressed all the Perfected Ones: “You in this assembly have deeply understood the Dharma-forms in this seat, finding bliss and peace. Truly, as you have said, there is no difference. In future ages, may all beings likewise attain awakening.”\n\nAt that time, the great assembly all rejoiced, bowed their heads in reverence, received the command, and withdrew together.\n\nChapter Five: The Youth’s Questions\n\nAt that time, a youth in attendance named Wisdom Illuminated rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, bowed in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, whose subtle and wondrous radiance universally illumines the ten directions, the worlds as numerous as motes of dust, and all lands—where innumerable multitudes of Perfected Ones and sages, beyond reckoning, have gathered together in the inconceivable city. The land is level and even, the palaces rare and wondrous, accommodating motes of dust in number without crowding or constraint.”\n\n“By what cause does this land possess such wondrous qualities? By what deeds of merit have these multitudes of Perfected Ones cultivated their practice? Encountering the radiance of this precious light, they have entered this assembly—how rare and unfathomable! Hearing this *Wondrous Grove*, we rejoice without limit. We beseech you to bestow your teaching and awaken those of the future.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the youth, saying: “Excellent, excellent, Wisdom Illuminated! You have skillfully aroused the subtle and wondrous conditions, enabling those of future ages to resolve their doubts. This inconceivable mountain is called the Hall of Great Blessing, where one departs from birth and death, and the land is pure and undefiled—beyond the perception of the Two Vehicles. Here, the Heavenly Worthies of the three times—past, future, and present—gather in assembly. A single mote of dust contains eighty thousand beings, and all is inconceivable: the palaces and couches, the hundred flavors of sweet fragrances, the garments and bedding, the flowers and fruits, the groves and trees, the bathing pools suffusing the body—all are composed of the seven treasures. Whatever is needed arrives at the thought. This land of virtue and power is beyond conception. My words today cannot exhaust its description.\n\nIn the lands of the ten directions and the three thousand worlds, all the dust-mote multitudes of Perfected Ones gather in assembly—all are superior beings, pure and undivided, their wisdom perfectly luminous, having fully understood the nature of all dharmas. Over countless kalpas, they have planted the roots of virtue. Thus, on this day, they encounter the radiant light and assemble here. Seeing me today expound the great and subtle Mahāyāna teachings, universally delivering boundless beings, they hear the name of this scripture, the *Wondrous Grove*, even a single chapter or verse. Know that such a person, though their body be but dust and sand, and their three karmic actions have committed manifold transgressions, shall all be purified and no longer suffer retribution. If any being hears the name of this scripture and recites even a single chapter or verse, wherever they are born, they shall dwell in a pure land, their clothing and food abundant, lacking nothing. Having heard this scripture, they shall not fall into the three evil destinies, nor encounter the knife mountains, sword trees, copper pillars, or burning coals; the iron beds of freezing ice and all suffering retributions shall naturally be destroyed. Wherever they go, they shall abide in bliss, and weapons, disasters, and poisonous beasts shall not harm them.”\n\nThe youth asked again: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, we pray you expound further: What practices do the Perfected Ones cultivate? By what power of mind do they perceive the nature of all dharmas, attain mastery, and penetrate without obstruction? How do they encounter this sacred scripture and hear the subtle and wondrous Dharma?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Wisdom Illuminated, the Perfected Ones’ practice is this: in all dharmas, they harbor no expectations, for their minds and natures are extinguished. Observing all forms, they do not generate attachment, knowing the eye is empty. Hearing all sounds, they do not generate attachment, knowing the ear is empty. Smelling all fragrances, they do not generate attachment, knowing the nose is empty. Tasting all flavors, they do not generate attachment, knowing the tongue is empty. Holding all treasures, they do not generate attachment, knowing the hand is empty. Walking on level ground, they do not generate attachment, knowing the foot is empty. Seeing the heavens, they do not delight, knowing there is no self. Seeing the hells, they do not fear, knowing there is no suffering. Seeing others give, they do not rejoice, knowing there is no gain. Seeing others plunder, they do not rage, knowing there is no loss. Hearing praise, they do not delight, knowing there is no fame. Facing slander, they do not resent, knowing there is no harm. Seeing the Jade Capital Mountain, they do not deem it high, for it has no ‘tall’ aspect. Seeing mounds and resting places, they do not deem them low, for they have no ‘short’ aspect. Seeing the kalpa trees, they do not deem them distant, for they have no ‘long-lived’ aspect. Seeing the hibiscus flowers, they do not deem them fleeting, for they have no ‘short-lived’ aspect. Seeing the Great Brahmā Heaven, they do not deem it vast, for it has no ‘great’ aspect. Seeing the tip of a hair, they do not deem it fine, for it has no ‘small’ aspect. Seeing raging fires, they do not deem them hot, for they have no ‘burning’ aspect. Seeing the vast seas, they do not deem them wet, for they have no ‘moist’ aspect. Seeing carvings and paintings, they do not deem them skillful, for they have no ‘artful’ aspect. Seeing the dull and inarticulate, they do not deem them foolish, for they have no ‘clumsy’ aspect. Seeing almsgiving, they do not deem it difficult, for they have no ‘wealth’ aspect. Seeing greed and stinginess, they do not deem them regrettable, for they have no ‘miserly’ aspect. Seeing all beings, they do not deem them different, for they have no ‘distinct’ aspect. Seeing the vast emptiness, they do not deem it singular, for it has no ‘non-existent’ aspect. Seeing kin and clan, they do not cling, for they have no ‘loving’ aspect. Seeing enemies, they do not despise, for they have no ‘hating’ aspect. Seeing heaven and earth, they do not deem them enduring, for they have no ‘abiding’ aspect. Seeing lightning, they do not deem it swift, for it has no ‘departing’ aspect. Seeing the sun rise, they do not deem it east, for it has no ‘emerging’ aspect. Seeing the sun set, they do not deem it west, for it has no ‘sinking’ aspect. Without west, without sinking, for there is no sun’s setting. Without east, without emerging, for there is no sun’s rising. Thus should you know: the Perfected Ones see dharmas yet do not see, for by not seeing, they dwell today in the pure land, encounter the rare and wondrous light, and hear me expound the great and subtle Mahāyāna scriptures. With single-minded faith, they comprehend and uphold them.”\n\nAt that time, a youth in attendance named Good Faith rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and with single-minded devotion gazed upon the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, your words are profoundly deep and subtly wondrous, beyond conception. If there are beings who hear this Dharma, by what power of mind may they attain awakening?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good Faith, if there are beings who encounter this scripture yet cannot fully comprehend it, they should contemplate their own bodies with wisdom: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and all faculties—are they defiled or undefiled? Do they arise from causes?”\n\n“Is it without cause? If one claims there is a self, and that the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements to form this self, one should reflect thus: the four great elements are by nature empty—how then can they combine? If the four great elements are empty yet combine to form this body, and the body arises from the four great elements, then since the four great elements are empty, this body is also empty. Why? Because it is fundamentally empty. If one claims that this body, the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements, yet the four great elements are distinct in nature—how can they combine? If the four great elements are distinct yet combine to form this body, then since the body arises from the four great elements, this body is also distinct. Why? Because it is fundamentally distinct. If one claims that this body, the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements, yet the four great elements do not combine—then how does this body come to be? If the four great elements combine to give rise to this body, yet they do not truly combine, then what combines to give rise to this body? Tigers, deer, snakes, and rats do not share the same nature—how then can they combine to give rise to anything? From this, one should know that this present body is like wind, like a shadow, like dew, like lightning, like an illusion, like a dream, like an echo, like a reverberation—ultimately quiescent and extinguished, utterly without cause. To know and see thus is called the contemplation of Dharma. Through this power of mind, one may generate the gates of all virtues, abide in the Three Clarities, and ever dwell in the Pure Land. In all views, the mind remains unshaken, and with single-minded wisdom, one observes all myriad kinds as wholly pure.”\n\nThe youth Good Faith, having heard this, rejoiced in his heart and marveled at what he had never before encountered. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:\n\n“What I now expound,\nAll the Heavenly Worthies proclaim:\nPast and future alike,\nAll share the power of one mind.\nThe dust-motes of the ten directions,\nAll the Dharma Kings therein—\nEach expounds the subtle and wondrous meaning,\nThe One Vehicle of the supreme scripture.\nShould even one person hear\nA single chapter or verse,\nAnd vow with resolve to uphold it,\nProclaiming it to future ages—\nSuch a good man,\nOr such a good woman,\nWherever they walk or dwell,\nNo plague or calamity shall dare harm them.\nIf one single-mindedly contemplates,\nThe five sufferings shall be utterly dispelled.\nAgain, they ask of the true adept,\nThe extraordinary causes of their practice.\nThe Dharma attained by the true person:\nObserving the body, they know it is wholly empty.\nSuffering and joy are not two,\nHatred and love are all the same.\nHigh and low share no distinct path,\nGreat and small differ not in form.\nThe sun’s rising is not its first union,\nThe sun’s setting—how could it be its final extinction?\nEast and west have no fixed place,\nRising and setting follow no single direction.”\n\n“They ask further: by what power of mind\nMay one attain this contemplation of equality?\nI reveal the contemplation of wisdom,\nWhereby all limbs and joints dissolve and merge.\nThe four great elements do not truly combine,\nAs tigers and deer do not share the same herd.\nKnowing thus the illusory and unreal,\nDew and lightning are all empty.\nUltimately without arising or ceasing,\nThe sun of the mind in Dharma contemplation shines bright.\nEver dwelling in the Pure Land,\nEternal joy knows no end.”\n\nAt that time, the youth in attendance and all the great assembly, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s subtle verses, rejoiced and leapt for joy, marvelling at what they had never before encountered. Thereupon, the entire assembly bowed their heads in unison, praising in one voice, and withdrew after making reverence.\n\nChapter Six: Following in Accordance\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy addressed Traversing All-Pervasively, saying: “In the latter age, should there be one who comprehends what I have expounded, extols its wondrous meaning, and proclaims it to those who have not yet heard, enabling them to awaken and embody its profound essence, not clinging to mere words, and knowing the nature of all dharmas to be without attachment—know that such a person has long since planted and perfected meritorious roots in the presence of immeasurable, boundless Heavenly Worthies. The people of the world, wherever such a person dwells, shall provide and offer clothing, food, bedding, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all necessities for sustaining life and healing. Those who act thus shall attain merit and virtue no different from what I myself have cultivated. Why is this so?”\n\nSuch a person is the supreme fangya of the Great Vehicle, upholding and propagating the treasury of the Dao, ensuring it never ceases. This person, in a former life, once entered the jeweled city, heard my sublime and wondrous scriptures of the Great Vehicle, and was reborn in the lower realms to proclaim my true teaching. Therefore, I say that making offerings to this person is no different from making offerings to me. Why is this so? Because this person deeply understands my subtle purport, expounding the Dao in accord with what is fitting, without any attachment or stagnation. Thus, making offerings to such a person in the world brings immeasurable merit and virtue.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, what does it mean to expound in accord with what is fitting, speaking in accordance with sentient beings, without attachment?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, the Dao I expound accords with sentient beings: I speak of the One Vehicle, of the dharmas of the three times, of conditioned dharmas, of unconditioned dharmas, of worldly dharmas, of supramundane dharmas, of defiled dharmas, of pure dharmas, of transgressions and blessings, of suffering and joy, of causes and effects—such teachings are called ‘accordance with what is fitting.’ The world of sentient beings is like the illusions conjured by a magician, without any fixed nature. It is also like the visions seen in a nighttime dream, all of which are false and illusory, without any true reality. If there are sentient beings who profoundly comprehend this meaning, such persons are my true disciples, capable of being entrusted with and upholding the treasury of the Dao, ensuring it never ceases.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, in these essential and wondrous teachings that accord with the world, is there no fixed nature, no transgressions or blessings, no suffering or joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, the Dao I expound accords with sentient beings: I speak of transgressions as blessings, of blessings as transgressions, of suffering as joy, of joy as suffering. Therefore, the Dao I expound is without fixed certainty.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, what does it mean to speak of transgressions as blessings, of blessings as transgressions, of suffering as joy, of joy as suffering? If there is no fixed nature, how do all sentient beings cultivate and transcend the cycle of birth and death to attain true liberation?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, when I speak of transgressions as blessings, it is because all transgressions committed by sentient beings are fundamentally empty in nature, without any inherent existence. When I speak of blessings as transgressions, it is because all blessings cultivated by sentient beings involve the mind’s hope and attachment to those blessings. The same applies to teachings on suffering and joy, causes and effects. From this, you should understand that my teachings on transgressions and blessings, suffering and joy, causes and effects are also without fixed nature. If one can know that all dharmas are unfixed, the mind is without obstruction and without entanglement—this is called liberation. One no longer transmigrates through the six destinies of birth and death but abides in constant joy and purity, immovably at peace. This is what it means to expound in accord with what is fitting, speaking in accordance with the world. To expound in accord with what is fitting is to guide and draw in sentient beings without fixed nature. By being without fixed nature, sentient beings are enabled to enter a state of certainty, free from fear. They can enter the three realms as guides for the multitude, liberating all immeasurable sentient beings and leading them into constant joy.”\n\nAt that time, Traversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I have reflected within myself that our great assembly, upon hearing these wondrous teachings, understands clearly in our minds and harbors no more doubts. However, in future ages, there will be sentient beings who, upon hearing these profound and subtle teachings, may not be able to resolve their uncertainties. The Heavenly Worthy has spoken of transgressions and blessings, suffering and joy as without fixed nature, all in accordance with sentient beings in the world. With what power of mind does one accord with the world, which is without fixed nature?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, what I now expound is permeated and cultivated by the mind of great compassion. The words, phrases, and sentences I speak in accordance with the world are all expedient means, guiding and receiving in various ways to enable liberation. Conditioned existence is illusory, the afflictions of ignorance are suffering. When one awakens to the nature of dharmas and perceives the true and real, this is called ‘accordance with sentient beings, expounding the Dao in accord with what is fitting.’”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again asked: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, why do you arouse great compassion for all sentient beings without falsehood or deception?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, it is like someone seeking empty space. If I now speak of space, is that falsehood or deception?”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively replied: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, can empty space be spoken of?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, empty space cannot be spoken of. The space I now speak of is empty, and my speaking is also empty. From this, you should understand that the world is fundamentally illusory, without any inherent existence. When I speak of the world, I do not fall into falsehood. Why is this so? The nature of falsehood is empty, and when I speak of falsehood, my speaking is also empty. Therefore, my speaking does not fall into falsehood.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if all in the world is spoken of as empty, and one accords with sentient beings, what benefit is there?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, it is for the sake of transformation and guidance, for the sake of liberation, for entering the gate of emptiness, for extinguishing all views, for realizing the absence of characteristics, for illuminating the absence of action. All conditioned activities are ultimately quiescent and will never arise again. Since there is no arising or ceasing, one abides immovably and constantly. Therefore, I now accord with the world through the mind of great compassion, enabling all sentient beings to attain this great benefit.”\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, how does a perfected one remain unattached to worldly dharmas in the mind?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled, excellent is this question. What do you and the assembly think?”\n\nThe Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled replied: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I have reflected within myself that the conduct of a perfected one is quiescent in mind and nature, without dual characteristics. If there were dual characteristics, it would be illusory.”\n\n“Now, observing the dharma, I hear good without joy, hear evil without anger, without marks of love or aversion. My mind and nature are quiescent, without hope. I observe all in the world as if a master of illusion, seeing his illusory creations—knowing them to be unreal, I am without attachment. The perfected one’s vision of all conditioned dharmas in the world is likewise: knowing them to be unreal, he is without attachment.”\n\nAt that time, the attendant acolyte named Superior Form, having heard the perfected one’s discourse, rejoiced greatly, leaping with boundless joy, his words unable to express it. It was as if a nobleman, having lost his beloved son for many days, suddenly saw him restored to life. My joy upon hearing the perfected one’s teaching is the same. Yet some dimness of doubt remains, and I cannot resolve it myself. Advancing, I bow my head and address the perfected one: “Greatly Virtuous Perfected One, you have said that the perfected one observes worldly dharmas as without dual characteristics, and because there are no dual characteristics, he is without attachment. If there were attachment, it would be illusory. But if illusory dharmas are like dreams and phantasms—since they are not truly existent—even if they are illusory, what loss is there?”\n\nThe perfected one replied: “Superior Form, you have asked me well, enabling those of the future to resolve their doubts. What I now say is this: if beings cling to conditioned dharmas, that is illusion. When the illusory mind arises, dualistic views appear. If beings can comprehend the non-duality of dual characteristics, they will know that what they see as illusory is itself without illusion. Therefore, what I now teach is this: if there are dualistic views and attachment to the world, that is illusion. Without dualistic views, one observes all illusions as not of the world. Since they are not of the world, there are no dualistic views. Without dualistic views, there is no illusion. From this, know that one who understands illusion observes all in the world as truly without loss.”\n\nSuperior Form again asked: “Greatly Virtuous Perfected One, you have said that illusion arises from dualistic views, that attachment to the world arises from the mind. But before understanding the world and the dharmas of the mind, which is the cause? Which is the effect? Is it the dharmas of the mind that give rise to the world, or is it the world that gives rise to the dharmas of the mind? If there were no dharmas of the mind, who would perceive the world? If there were no world, what would the mind perceive? If you say the dharmas of the mind perceive the world, then before the dharmas of the mind existed, there should be no world. If you say the world is what the mind perceives, then before the world existed, there should be no dharmas of the mind. These two principles I truly cannot comprehend. I pray you expound and clarify what I have not yet heard.”\n\nThe perfected one replied: “Superior Form, I now tell you: the dharmas of the mind and the world are neither cause nor effect, neither prior nor subsequent, neither one nor different, neither existent nor non-existent—yet they are also both existent and non-existent, both one and different, even cause and effect. It is like a hen that gives birth to an egg, and like an egg that gives birth to a hen. Thus, hen and egg are neither cause nor effect, neither prior nor subsequent, neither one nor different, neither existent nor non-existent—yet they are also both existent and non-existent, both one and different, even cause and effect. If you understand non-arising, there is no such question. If you seek attainment, it is a perverse question. One who asks perverse questions forever loses the vast Mahāyāna vision.\n\n“Superior Form, how can you seek the marks of life in an empty valley’s echo, or seek the sprouts of grain in scorched seeds? The dharmas of the mind and the world are likewise: ultimately and eternally extinguished, they cannot be discussed. They are like a great poison—one cannot taste them; like a raging fire—one cannot draw near. To speak of the marks of the world or the dharmas of the mind is like a blind man describing colors or a deaf man describing sounds—ultimately without cause, they cannot be discussed.”\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Truly as you have said. You have skillfully distinguished that the dharmas of the mind and the world are both without existence and cannot be spoken of—profound and essential words.”\n\nThereupon, the great assembly, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly and spoke in verse:\n\nWonderful and wondrous, the Venerable One,\nWho raised such questions.\nIf even one person hears and understands\nThe profound and subtle meaning,\nProclaiming and transmitting this great dharma,\nRevealing and awakening those to come—\nKnow that this great being\nHas planted boundless merit.\nAll beings in the world\nShould attend to such a one,\nSupplying what he lacks,\nHis merit beyond measure.\nOne who understands this profound truth\nIs a true child of my dharma,\nUpholding the wondrous forest of scriptures,\nAble to nurture supreme talent.\nUnderstanding my expedient teachings,\nThat suffering and joy have no inherent cause—\nLike a great master of illusion\nSeeing his illusory creations,\nThough conforming to worldly dharmas,\nWith wisdom, the mind is without attachment.\nDrawing forth all sentient beings,\nThey decisively enter the Mahāyāna,\nComprehending the nature of the world,\nLiberated without distinct calamities.\nNow I speak of the world\nWithout falling into illusion.\nQuestioning emptiness, one seeks form;\nDiscerning emptiness, one follows the occasion.\nPerfected One of Great Virtue,\nFor the assembly, you inquired about the mind’s conduct.\nHaving received the supreme response,\nYou declared your past practices:\nThough conforming to worldly dharmas,\nWhat you saw was without illusion.\nSuperior Form, true acolyte,\nNot yet fully understanding, raised his doubts.\nThe perfected one skillfully resolved them,\nLike ice melting away.\nThe dharmas of mind and world\nAre neither effect nor cause.\nOne who knows the blind man describes colors—\nWhy trouble to speak of an empty valley?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy praised the perfected one,\nAnd the great assembly all opened their hearts.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of the Inconceivable City, having spoken these verses, addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, we pray that your great compassion not abandon its vast resolve. Bestow the great radiance to illuminate the infinite worlds below, allowing those inferior beings to behold the precious light, dispelling their ignorant darkness, and forming karmic connections with the Dao, so that the Dao may return to its origin.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy flicked his fingers, and from his palm emerged the supreme precious light, round as a mirror, penetrating the lower realms to illuminate infinite lands—even the three evil destinies and the suffering souls of the Nine Dark Realms—all became bright and clear, perfectly pure.\n\nThe hells found rest, and karmic retribution knew tranquility. The deaf, the blind, the six afflictions, and all forms of suffering were transformed into joy. Humans, birds, and beasts alike awakened to benevolent hearts, no longer harming one another. By virtue of this radiance, all beings lifted their eyes to behold the Inconceivable City from afar, as though gazing into their own palms, with nothing obscured. Those who beheld this light were destined to journey to the Hall of Eternal Bliss, entering the Jeweled City, where boundless joy awaited.\n\n*The Great Vehicle Wondrous Forest Sutra, Middle Fascicle, concludes.*\n\n---\n\n*The Great Vehicle Wondrous Forest Sutra, Lower Fascicle*\n*The Seventh Chapter: The Assembly of Perfected Beings Preaches the Dharma*\n\nAt that time, the attendant youth named Good Vision rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Today, while attending this assembly, I have heard this rare and wondrous sutra, filling my body and mind with exultation and joy beyond words. The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings, replete with profound analogies, are not what the Two Vehicles could ever hear or perceive. How excellent is this gathering, never before experienced! All the perfected beings of the ten thousand worlds have assembled here. By what power of mind do these great ones contemplate the nature of all dharmas, thereby encountering this wondrous and venerable sutra? I pray that you reveal the practices of the perfected beings in observing the nature of all dharmas, so that all beings may awaken.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised Good Vision, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Attendant youth, you now ask on behalf of all future beings that I expound the practices of the perfected in observing the nature of all dharmas.” Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of perfected beings: “All of you here today have gathered by virtue of this wondrous radiance—an inconceivable convergence. You are all superior beings, pure and unadulterated, with clear understanding of the nature of dharmas. The youth has requested that I broadly explain the power of mind by which the perfected observe the nature of all dharmas. Thus, today you shall hear the essential teachings of the wondrous Great Vehicle, the first and rarest of profound meanings. Now, let each of you reveal the practices of the perfected, so that these youths and all beings of future ages may comprehend the secret essentials and esoteric practices of the perfected.”\n\nAt that time, the perfected being named Wondrous Form addressed the assembly of youths: “Now, with one mind, listen attentively. We, the assembly of perfected beings, shall broadly expound the practices of the perfected in observing the nature of all dharmas, revealing what has never been heard, so that all may awaken. The practices of the perfected begin with receiving all precepts and observing all decorum, just as when good men and women in the world hear the Dharma and their minds leap with joy, free from doubt, generating resolute conviction. So too do the perfected: from kalpas immeasurable in the past to the present, in all the precepts they uphold and decorum they observe, their minds leap with joy, free from doubt, generating resolute conviction without regression. This is called the perfected’s observance of precepts in contemplating the nature of dharmas, cultivating resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Jeweled Radiance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the practices of the perfected are grounded in the Four Immeasurable Minds, firm and unshakable, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Illuminating Brilliance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all dharmas and decisively attain the unsurpassed Dao, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Universal Equality addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected guide all beings without partiality, regarding them as their own children, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Sagely Conduct addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in their right conduct, remain free from distracting thoughts and contemplate all forms without differentiation, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected enter into suffering and hardship to rescue beings without wavering, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Pervasive Penetration addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected reflect inwardly and contemplate all beings as nothing but reality itself, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Virtue Fulfilled addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in all dharmas, discern without obstruction, subdue external paths, and lead others to correctness, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Swift Salvation addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all natures as fundamentally pure and inconceivable, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected Guide addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in body, speech, and mind, guide beings without falsehood, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Loving Kindness addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all dharmas as entirely real, nothing apart from the true Dao, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating Form addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, when harassed by all demonic hordes, remain free from anger, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Lofty Attainment addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death, feel no delight, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Supreme Compassion addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with a supreme mind, deliver and guide all beings to accomplishment, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Luminous Clarity addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, having received all precepts, remain unwavering in mind, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Treasure Guardianship addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing all precious things, remain free from attachment, ever delighting in offering, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Sustained Protection addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, amidst the five desires, remain free from delight, ever cultivating pure conduct, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Equanimous Vision addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all beings, seeing neither arising nor ceasing, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Quiescent Samādhi addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected know that all beings, having heard this sutra, will unfailingly attain the Dao, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Unobstructedness addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with the fragrance of merit and virtue, perpetually pervade the five destinies without hindrance, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Soaring Emptiness addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing all who arouse the aspiration, will unfailingly ascend to the jeweled city, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Constant Remembrance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing all beings, ceaselessly inspire their awakening, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Skillful Transformation addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected know that the dharmas of the world possess neither abiding nor departing marks, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Serene Samādhi addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, expounding the Dharma for beings, do not conceive of dharmas, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Radiance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with wisdom, extinguish immeasurable transgressions, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Flower addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected see the Heavenly Worthies and the trees of merit and virtue filling the lands in the ten directions, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing the suffering of beings, do not become distant, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Luminous Wisdom addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing the deluded, instruct them in severance, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Jeweled Canopy addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with non-action, shelter and protect all, bringing them peace and security, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nAt that time, the innumerable youths seated in attendance, having heard the subtle, wondrous, and true Mahāyāna teachings—essential, profound, and far-reaching—each awakened, simultaneously praised them as excellent, paid their respects, and withdrew.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Contemplating the Nature of Dharmas**\n\nThen the Perfected of Liberated Life arose from his seat, bowed his head, and respectfully inquired of the Heavenly Worthy: “As was just expounded, the contemplation of the nature of dharmas by the perfected is without expectation, knowing the emptiness of dharmas. If this is the case, how do they adorn all beings to attain the Dao?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, all beings are fundamentally pure in nature, devoid of anything, akin to empty space. The nature of the Dao is also empty; since the nature of the Dao is empty, how can you ask how all beings attain the Dao? The nature of beings and the nature of the Dao are not two. The nature of beings is illusory; all illusory natures are called the nature of dharmas. Within the nature of dharmas, there is no attainment or loss, no increase or decrease. Therefore, I say that all beings attain the true mark without severing afflictions.”\n\nThe Perfected of Liberated Life again inquired: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, if as you have said, all beings naturally abide in bliss without cultivating vows and practices—”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, within the nature of dharmas, is there cultivation of vows and practices to attain bliss? The so-called bliss arises from the mind; the nature of the mind is fundamentally empty. How can there be cultivation? If there is bliss, it is called desire. Knowing the emptiness of all dharmas is true bliss.”\n\nThe Perfected again asked: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, since all beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent, why is it said that all beings, through immeasurable kalpas of cultivating merit and virtue, gather the inconceivable and dwell in pure lands?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, it is like a sorrowful person whose mind is confused, afflicted by vexation and heat. Before this person, various illusions are displayed—wooden men and women, wooden oxen and horses—arranged and performed in various magical arts. The sorrowful one, seeing these, conceives thoughts of oxen and horses, and their afflictions cease, their mind becoming at ease. I am now the same. All beings, deluded by false sorrow and poison, have not yet attained bliss.”\n\nTherefore, I speak of cultivating all virtues—boundless and immeasurable—only then may one be reborn in the inconceivable realm. If one knows that delusion is fundamentally devoid of substance, then every step and action of all beings is itself inconceivable. If one knows purity, freedom, and unimpededness, then every wish of the heart is freely and fully realized. Should one cultivate goodness, one shall be reborn in the wondrous lands of the Three Clarities. Such expedient means serve only to halt false delusion, for in truth, there has never been any hope for the eternal bliss of the Three Clarities.\n\nIf one desires swift attainment of the precious city of the Three Clarities and the realm of eternal bliss, one must ride the great and supreme mind of wisdom, observing the form of one’s own body: from what dharma did it arise through immeasurable kalpas? Knowing it arises from no cause, one knows there is no self. Because there is no self, therefore one’s body eternally abides in the Three Clarities’ realm of eternal bliss.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Liberated Life again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, since the lives of all beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent, illusory and unreal—like dreams, without determinacy—how is it that all good men and women, without severing the three karmas, without practicing the six perfections, without cultivating the four immeasurables, may yet attain the Dao?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, why do you ask such a question? The three karmas of all beings are called impure. Body, speech, and mind arise from nothing; even if one could cultivate them, they would still be illusory. How so? The three karmas are fundamentally pure—what cause is there to cultivate? If there is cultivation, it is because there is impurity. It is like a grave illness: one summons physicians and medicines, skilled in curing all diseases, worth a thousand gold pieces. Though they are welcomed along the road and arrive at the house, in the end, they are not the true remedy. Or like a madman speaking of empty flowers—though he discourses on their subtlety, in the end, they cannot be trusted. All beings who cultivate the body to seek the Dao are likewise.\n\nCultivating the body to seek the Dao entails two afflictions. What are these two? First, because there is evil; second, because one perceives a self. These two views are the great illnesses of the Dao. Therefore, if beings wish to seek the Dao, they must ride the great and supreme mind of wisdom, observing the form of their own body. Once they realize there is no body, the three karmas become pure of themselves. Practicing the six perfections and cultivating the four immeasurable minds—this is called following expedient means to guide and receive. It is like a traveler blocked by the scorching valley, wishing to reach the other shore but having no means to cross. Borrowing a boat, they traverse the depths; once they reach the other shore, the boat they once used is no longer needed. The six perfections and four practices are likewise. For beings who have not yet realized the shore of the unborn Dao, the six perfections are provisionally employed to pacify their minds and bring them to harmony. Once they realize there is no body and attain the ground of the Dao, the six perfections and all practices are no longer needed.”\n\nThe Perfected One of Liberated Life again said: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, the parables you have spoken are essential and profound. All the practices that beings cultivate to seek liberation—once they are liberated, nothing more is practiced. Does this mean that all who become perfected and attain the Dao practice nothing? If there is no practice, should great compassion be lost? How then does the great Dao, for all beings, constantly enact the four vast vows to liberate them from suffering?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, the Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, saves and liberates beings from suffering without distinction of self and other, without love or aversion, without formation or decay, without gain or loss. It is like a bridge or boat, mindless in ferrying beings, making no distinction between pure and impure, human or non-human, oxen, horses, mules, or donkeys—all pass through. The Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, practices great liberation without mind, and though liberating beings, there is no self or other, no love or aversion, no formation or decay, no gain or loss. It is like the great sea, receiving a hundred rivers without increase or decrease, without impurity or purity, without mind to discriminate, containing all things. Gold, silver, pearls, crystal, lapis lazuli, giant clams, agate, coral, amber—all treasures are encompassed within. The great treasury of the true Dao is likewise. The Great Net of the Three Clarities, the Four Brahmā Heavens, the Three Realms, the heavens and humans of the five paths, immortals, perfected beings, and great sages—none are not contained within. For this reason, it is mindless and ever-sufficient, without practice, without the marks of going or coming.”\n\nThen the Perfected One of Liberated Life exclaimed: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, your words are subtle and wondrous, beyond thought and conception. The Dharma I have heard fills me with boundless joy, immeasurable and infinite—such as the Two Vehicles cannot hear or see.” Thereupon, the Perfected One bowed his head in reverence and spoke these verses:\n\n“Wondrous and peerless, supreme and honored One,\nYour subtle and profound Mahāyāna sutra expounds this meaning:\nAll natures are empty, unborn, and undying.\nThe Dao-nature and beings are fundamentally not two;\nWithout relying on cultivation, it is naturally attained.\nDharma-nature and illusion-nature are different names,\nYet purity, quiescence, and extinction share no distinction.\nFrom of old, we were truly sorrowful,\nNot severing afflictions, not realizing true nature.\nOnly now, in this seat, have we heard\nThis subtle and wondrous Mahāyāna Dharma—\nAt last knowing that beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent,\nEternally blissful through immeasurable kalpas.\nRising with desire to cultivate myriad practices,\nNot knowing that practice is empty, fundamentally without cultivation.\nThe great sage provisionally speaks of cultivation,\nLike a magician performing a play.\nWooden oxen and horses belong to the sorrowful one;\nThe person’s sorrow and the wooden horses are both illusory.\nKnowing delusion is fundamentally without substance,\nYet its inverted appearances are inconceivable.\nThe subtle lands of the Three Clarities you speak of\nAre expedient means to guide beings to return to truth.\nRealizing there is no cause and no self,\nOne’s own land is the Three Clarities.\nKnowing one’s body is illusion and dream,\nThe six perfections and four immeasurables are all empty declarations.\nEven if one cultivates without flaw,\nIt is still the delusion of a mind with intention.”\n\nJust as one gravely ill seeks medicine,\nYet medicine itself does not delight the heart.\nBefore one can fully realize the formless,\nOne provisionally uses boats and bridges to cross perilous currents.\n\nWhen the Dao is attained and truth is realized, the mind’s movements cease;\nForgetting the mind, one ferries beings across—boundless indeed.\nThe great sea contains immeasurable treasures;\nThe true Dao embraces all precious things.\n\nWe, having now heard this supreme Dharma,\nRejoice that the three realms are the Dao’s field.\n\nAt that time, after the assembly had recited this verse, the immeasurable multitude in the City of the Inconceivable all rejoiced together and returned to their seats.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Pure Wisdom**\n\nThen the Youth of Right Vision addressed the Perfected One, saying: “Lifespan Perfected One, how can you say that the conduct of the Perfected One, amid desire and attachment, remains unstained in mind, unstained by non-desire—this is called the Perfected One’s contemplation of the nature of all dharmas, attaining decisive understanding?”\n\nDoes the Perfected One see desire and attachment as having some perception? Some conduct?\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, excellent is this question. The Perfected One’s perception of all conditioned dharmas is like a wise person seeing a mirage in the heat, or a great magician beholding his own illusions—knowing they are not real, the mind holds no expectations. The Perfected One’s perception of all conditioned dharmas is likewise.\n\nThe Perfected One’s perception observes the perceptions of beings;\nThe perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception—how can they be the same?\nThe Perfected One’s conduct accords with the conduct of beings;\nThe conduct of beings is precisely what the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, who have attained the Dao and realized truth, know and perceive—how can the great Dao’s conduct be the same as that of beings?\n\nThe conduct of beings is the meaning of emptiness.\nThe Perfected One’s conduct is the conduct of the Dao, the place of the Dao’s activity.\nThus, the Perfected One’s conduct accords with the conduct of beings—how can the perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception?\n\nThe conduct of beings arises from having conduct;\nFrom having discriminations, from deluded perceptions;\nFrom delusion, the mind clings to things;\nFrom clinging, perceptions differ.\nThus, the perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, what dharma does the Perfected One perceive to attain decisive understanding?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, the Perfected One’s perception sees neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned. All conditioned dharmas are entirely delusory. Knowing delusion is empty, without discrimination—this is called true perception. The unconditioned dharma is originally pure, having no existence, and thus nothing is perceived. To comprehend these two perceptions is called pure wisdom. Contemplating the nature of all dharmas as entirely empty—this is called true perception. True perception is luminous and pure—this is called pure wisdom. Therefore, the Perfected One, amid all dharmas, attains decisive understanding, for nothing is perceived.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, if this is so, do all beings who cultivate practice attain nothing?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, why do you speak thus? All beings, if they can know that there is no cause and no effect, no practice and no attainment—this is called cause and effect, this is called practice and attainment. If one arises in perceptions of having attainment, this is called wrong view, not to be approached. Having no practice and no attainment—this is called right conduct, the conduct of the Perfected One, for nothing is attained.\n\nIt is like a bright mirror reflecting all forms,\nClear and luminous, without obstruction,\nYet the mirror itself never says, ‘I can illuminate.’\nThe wondrous forest of pure wisdom, the assembly in the jeweled city—\nAll the perfected ones of the dust-mote realms,\nTheir mind-mirrors luminous and pure, for nothing is attained,\nReflect all dharmas clearly and luminously, without hindrance.\nYet the perfected ones never say, ‘I can illuminate,’\nJust like that mirror, no different.\n\nAgain, it is like clear water reflecting a hundred thousand moons,\nFor their natures are equally luminous.\nThe Perfected One’s perception is likewise:\nContemplating all things in the world,\nNothing is not pure,\nFor their natures are equally empty.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, if all in the world is empty, does the Heavenly Worthy’s appearance in the world bring no benefit?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, how can there be benefit in the absence of dharmas? Do you now perceive the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions as having the mark of arising?”\n\nThe Youth replied: “Venerable Perfected One, what I now perceive has no mark of arising. Knowing all dharmas are empty, originally pure—thus the Heavenly Worthy appears in the world without the mark of arising.”\n\nThe Perfected One continued: “Youth of Right Vision, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions appear in the world to sever the delusions of all beings, proclaiming this wondrous sutra, the profound Dharma, enabling all beings to attain pure wisdom, clearly understand the nature of dharmas, without obstruction, knowing all dharmas are empty, fundamentally without delusion. Once delusion is empty, the mind’s nature is pure. Thus, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions have no mark of appearing or disappearing. For this reason, the Heavenly Worthies’ appearance in the world brings great benefit, and all beings attain right vision, abiding in peace and bliss.\n\nIt is like dreaming at night of venomous snakes,\nTheir fangs bared, approaching to devour,\nThe mind terrified, fleeing in panic,\nCrying out to the heavens, stumbling in confusion,\nAwakened by someone beside the bed: ‘Why do you cry out in your sleep?’\nSuddenly the dreamer awakens,\nStretching limbs, knowing the dream’s visions were false,\nThe mind composed, abiding in peace and bliss.\n\nAll beings dwell in the vast chamber of ignorance within the three realms,\nAll their actions like dreams, without reality.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, proclaims this Mahāyāna wondrous sutra,\nAwakening all to attain right vision,\nPossessing all wisdom, pure wisdom perfected,\nAll abiding in peace and bliss.”\n\nHaving attained peace and bliss, one does not generate attachment;\nWithout attachment, one gains determination, never again entering the flow;\nNever entering the flow, there is no union;\nWithout union, there is no ignorance;\nWithout ignorance, there are no formations;\nWithout formations, there is eternal extinction,\nNo arising of any marks, ultimately pure,\nWithout speech, without discourse.\nIf there is speech, it is illusory;\nYet illusory speech is itself reality.\nWhy is this so?\nIllusory speech is but script—\nThe nature of script is empty, and emptiness is reality.\nFor this reason, the Heavenly Worthy’s illusory words are all reality.\n\nAt that time, the attendant youth named Dharma Appearance stepped forward, bowed his head, and addressed the Perfected One: “Virtuous One, why do you say that when true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, they are called true persons? When contemplating the nature of dharmas, is the nature of that nature existent or non-existent? If the nature of dharmas exists, it must be eternally constant; if it is non-existent, it must be definitively empty. How can a nature that is eternally constant be called empty? How can a nature that is definitively empty be called illusory? If the nature is definitively empty yet called illusory, then such speech is itself illusory. It is like space—empty and without illusion—yet to call it illusory is to speak falsely, for space itself has no illusion. If the nature is definitively existent, how can you say that when true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, they are called true persons, and that in contemplating the nature of dharmas, they gain a determined mind? To speak of a definitively existent nature as empty is to speak of emptiness, not of the emptiness of dharma-nature. If dharma-nature is not empty yet spoken of as empty, such speech is also illusory. To speak of dharma-nature as empty when its nature is not empty—how can one contemplate dharmas and attain determination? These two interpretations remain unresolved. I humbly request your elucidation, that all present may resolve their doubts.”\n\nThe Perfected One of Compassionate Salvation addressed the youth: “Dharma Appearance, excellent is this question! Now, when I speak of contemplating the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, why do you ask whether the nature of that nature is existent or non-existent? If the nature is definitively existent, then all dharmas possessing it cannot be called empty; if the nature is definitively empty, then the emptiness of that nature cannot be called existent. To perceive the nature as existent is eternalism; to perceive it as empty is annihilationism. These two views are false views. The thirty-six views are not the true and correct vision. What I perceive is the true nature of dharma-nature—neither existent nor non-existent, neither eternal nor annihilated, neither arising nor ceasing, neither white nor black, neither blue nor yellow, neither long nor short, neither high nor low, neither one nor different, neither great nor small, neither cold nor hot, neither prior nor posterior, neither cause nor effect. For this reason, I say that true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, for it is without possession. Though I say it is not existent, it is not definitively empty; though I say it is not empty, it is not eternally existent. Because it is not definitively existent, dharma-nature is not eternal; because it is not definitively empty, dharma-nature is not annihilated. Dharma-nature is not annihilated, unlike a rabbit’s horn; dharma-nature is not eternal, unlike illusory falsity. For this reason, I say that true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, for it is without possession. It is like the extinction of a lamp—unseekable, ultimately pure, and unattainable.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One: “Excellent, true adept! Swiftly you have expounded this profound and rare teaching, the foremost of realities.” The countless attendant youths all attained awakening.\n\nAt that time, a youth named Universal Illumination arose among the assembly and spoke in verse:\n\nExcellent is this wondrous seat of the forest,\nIts merit unfathomable.\nThe dust-motes of the ten directions,\nEncountering this rare light,\nWalk the empty path to the wondrous seat,\nPure and singular, the supreme truth.\nWith wisdom’s mind, they contemplate the wondrous dharma—\nThe nature of dharmas is naturally empty.\nThe conditioned dharmas of the world,\nAll are not real.\nThe wise observe their illusory nature,\nLike a magician seeing wooden puppets.\nSeeing illusion as ordinary sight,\nOrdinary people see it as truly different.\nThe great Dao of the ten directions,\nAll worlds and all beings—\nTogether they practice the foremost truth,\nYet the deluded call it otherwise.\nTrue vision comprehends all dharmas,\nClearly observing even the finest dust.\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s bodily marks—\nAll marks are originally unarisen.\nExpounding this wondrous sutra,\nAll beings realize emptiness.\nThus we know the three realms are empty,\nDreams and illusions are universally unreal.\nIgnorance forever extinguished,\nAll formations naturally dissolve.\nFrom this we know the illusory,\nNever was it not the Dao-ground.\nThe supreme and utterly true adept,\nWith pure wisdom rescues the submerged.\nSkillfully discerning the nature of dharmas,\nIts emptiness is neither existent nor non-existent.\nEternal and annihilated, originally pure—\nLike a lamp’s extinction, unseekable.\nThe Heavenly Worthy praises the rare,\nExcellent is this wondrous sutra!\nWe all awaken together,\nRejoicing in the supreme mind.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, having heard the youth’s verse, praised him: “Excellent, Universal Illumination! Through long cultivation of pure wisdom, today you have entered the jeweled city together with all, hearing my Mahāyāna teaching and attaining awakening, comprehending the nature of dharmas, clearly understanding the world. The nature is without possession—just as you have said. Today I am joyful and at peace, free from all worry. You and all present, in future ages, proclaim my Mahāyāna wondrous sutra, that all future beings of aspiration may attain awakening, together gaining pure wisdom, free from doubt and obstruction, clearly and decisively pure, abiding in peace and bliss.”\n\nAt that time, the immeasurable assembly of attendants, all the immortals and perfected ones, and the mighty spirit-kings rose together, bowed in reverence, received the command, and withdrew.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Praise**\n\nThen, in the Jade Capital Mountain, the Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Lofty Perfection rose from his seat. Having heard the Dharma spoken by the Perfected Ones, he rejoiced with exultation and scattered immeasurable, wondrous celestial flowers upon the seat. With incense of a hundred blended treasures, he perfumed the minds of the assembly. The inconceivable city and all who had come rejoiced greatly.\n\nThen the Heavenly King addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “By what cause and condition have we, this great assembly, encountered this rare and wondrous scripture? Having heard the Dharma spoken by the Perfected Ones—profound and abstruse, a teaching never before known—I have reflected thus: If good men and women, all sentient beings, should hear even a single chapter or verse of this Great Vehicle’s wondrous scripture, and with wholehearted faith receive, uphold, and practice it, reciting, praising, expounding, transcribing, and copying it, such a person is a true disciple of the Great Dao. Their power and might can shatter all the enmities of birth-and-death’s demonic forces. Why is this so? The true nature spoken by the Perfected Ones is the true Dao, the correct essence, pure and equal, without any differing marks—it is called the complete destruction of all sentient beings’ boundless perverse views. If there is one who, upon hearing this teaching, gives rise to no doubt, generates resolute conviction, receives, upholds, and makes offerings to it, and expounds even a single chapter or verse to others, know that this person has planted wholesome causes for measureless kalpas, and thus in this present life clearly perceives the nature of the Dharma. Hearing this Great Vehicle’s wondrous scripture, they do not generate fear or dread. If one who hears this Great Vehicle scripture should in future lives fall into the three evil destinies, such a thing cannot occur. Having heard this scripture and rejoiced upon first encounter, their merit and virtue are boundless. Know that this person’s every step and action is the cause and condition of the Three Clarities’ eternal bliss. Wherever this scripture abides, it is protected by the immeasurable great spirits of all the heavens. If there are those who expound and recite this Great Vehicle scripture, and wherever they may be, those who come with wholehearted devotion to the Dharma seat to listen with joy—know that such persons have entered the Dharma Wheel, the inconceivable city. Wherever this scripture is present—whether in cities, villages, mountains, forests, open fields, temples, or altars—wherever it travels, all demonic outsiders and evil persons cannot inflict harm. We, this assembly today, having beheld the Heavenly Venerable radiating wondrous light and heard this essential teaching, rejoice without measure. We vow to uphold and protect this scripture, sparing neither body nor life. It is like a blind man with but one remaining eye, guarding that eye, fearing any injury. We now guard and uphold this Great Vehicle scripture in the same way, fearing any harm, daring not treat it with negligence.”\n\nThen the Heavenly King spoke these verses:\n\nWe, this immeasurable assembly,\nhave together entered the jeweled city.\nEncountering the light, we saw the rare,\nthe wondrous Great Vehicle scripture.\nIf there are those with faith,\nwho receive and uphold its chapters and verses,\nthis person’s merit and power\nwill subdue and vanquish all demons.\nWherever this scripture travels,\nno demon dares to invade.\nThose who hear the scripture and come to listen\nwill have lotus flowers bloom beneath their feet.\nWe, having heard this essential teaching,\nvow to uphold it, daring not transgress,\nas one guards a single eye,\ncherishing it, lest it be harmed.\nWe now protect the Venerable Dharma,\ntreasuring it even more than this.\nMay this Great Vehicle Dharma\nuniversally ferry the beings of the ten heavens.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable praised the Heavenly King, saying: “Excellent, excellent! You and this assembly are true upholders of the Great Vehicle, protecting and ferrying all beings. You are my true disciples, aiding me in propagating and circulating this teaching in the degenerate age, enabling all to attain awakening. You, seated here today, have mounted this wondrous cause, and in future kalpas shall surely attain the true Great Dao.”\n\nThen the Heavenly King and all the great assembly, having heard these words, felt their minds at peace, rejoicing without measure. Together they exclaimed in approval, bowed in reverence, and withdrew.\n\n*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Grove of the Great Vehicle.*",

Hymns of Joy\n\n---\n\n### **The Sublime Grove of the Great Vehicle Sutra, Volume One**\n\n#### **1. The Prolegomenon**\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was seated upon his lion throne within the Palace of Primordial Yang, amidst the Seven Jeweled Citadel of the Inconceivable Mountain. Surrounded by the Eight Mightiest Guardians, he sat in tranquil repose, his body and mind unmoving. For seven minor kalpas, he did not rise from his seat. Then, he emitted a great radiance, suffusing the ten directions and illuminating boundless lands—worlds as numerous as motes of dust—without exception.\n\nAt that moment, the perfected beings and sagely immortals across the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds and their countless lands were struck with awe and wonder. With one voice, they exclaimed: *\"Alas! By what karmic cause does the Celestial Worthy of Great Virtue in that realm emit such rare and wondrous light, a marvel beyond compare?\"*\n\nGazing from afar at the mountain, the assembled sages and immortals of those dust-mote worlds beheld the radiance—peerless, sublime, and unparalleled—so extraordinary no simile could suffice. Their hearts raced with reverence and longing, yet their lips could not utter a word. All yearned to hasten there.\n\nThen, the Celestial Worthy, in serene composure, stirred his thoughts. With the wisdom of knowing others’ minds, he perceived from afar the devout intentions of the sagely assembly in those distant lands. These beings were all of the highest rank, each worthy of deliverance.\n\nHe then raised his voice and proclaimed to the boundless lands in the ten directions: *\"You, perfected beings, have planted the roots of virtue in past lives, pure and undivided. You are my true children, fit to uphold the treasury of the Dao. I now wish to enter the Realm of Eternal Bliss. Ride upon this rare and wondrous radiance, and come together to this Dharma-seat, that you may encounter the unsurpassed Dharma I expound today.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this voice, the sagely assemblies of the innumerable lands in the ten directions rejoiced greatly. Mounting divine light, they soared through the void, crossing valleys and peaks, all of the highest rank, following the radiance to gather. These great assemblies—whose afflictions were emptied, whose nature of the Dao was luminously understood—were named: Pure Conduct Perfected, Wondrous Form Perfected, Jeweled Radiance Perfected, Shining Brilliance Perfected, Eloquent Wisdom Perfected, Universal Equality Perfected, Sagely Conduct Perfected, All-Pervading Understanding Perfected, Virtue-Filled Perfected, Life-Delivering Perfected, Salvation-Seeking Perfected, Guiding Master Perfected, Kindly Love Perfected, Insightful Form Perfected, Lofty Excellence Perfected, Supreme Intent Perfected, Illuminating Clarity Perfected, Treasury-Guarding Perfected, Upholding Protection Perfected, Equal Contemplation Perfected, Serene Samādhi Perfected, Unobstructed Perfected, Soaring Void Perfected, Constant Mindfulness Perfected, Transformative Penetration Perfected, Skillful Adaptation Perfected, Tranquil Samādhi Perfected, Wondrous Radiance Perfected, Wondrous Flower Perfected, Great Compassion Perfected, Wisdom-Light Perfected, Jeweled Canopy Perfected, and others.\n\nThese innumerable perfected beings, along with their retinues and the boundless hosts of celestial dragons and mighty spirit-kings, arrived as one at the Inconceivable Mountain, their numbers beyond reckoning. Like a fine mist or dense fog, they encircled the mountain thrice, gazing upon the Celestial Worthy. With measured and graceful steps, they bowed at his feet, inquired after his well-being, and then took their seats in due order.\n\nThen, the Celestial Worthy, suffusing the great assembly with his boundless compassion, softly intoned: *\"Perfected beings, you have amassed countless virtues over measureless kalpas to gather here today, encountering this rare radiance and beholding the unsurpassed and unprecedented Dharma. Your assembly is beyond conception. I now wish to enter the Realm of Eternal Bliss. If any among you have doubts, speak freely and ask.\"*\n\nThereupon, Pure Conduct Perfected rose from his seat, adjusted his robes, knelt with reverence, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: *\"We, this assembly, have ridden upon this rare radiance, desiring to ask questions. If you deign to grant us leave, we shall dare to present our inquiries.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: *\"Pure Conduct Perfected, you now skillfully open the way for this assembly, seeking the forms of the Dao. Ask freely, without hesitation. I shall distinguish and explain, resolving all your doubts.\"*\n\nHaving received permission, Pure Conduct Perfected’s heart leapt with joy, his delight boundless. He addressed the Celestial Worthy: *\"This bodily form, this radiance suffusing all—sublime, rare, and wondrous—stands peerless, surpassing a hundred thousand suns, beyond all conception. I reflect thus: such a bodily form is rare and unfathomable. If any being beholds this light, they are called a ‘perfected being,’ able to perceive all dharmas without harming their eye faculty.\"*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: *\"Pure Conduct Perfected, it is just as you say. My bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being beholds the wondrous light of my form, their eye faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, contemplate their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being hears the wondrous light of my form, their ear faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, hear their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my bodily form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being smells the wondrous light of my form, their nose faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to comprehend all dharmas, discern their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.*\n\n*Moreover, my true form possesses boundless radiance, called the ‘Radiance of Boundless Meaning.’ If any being speaks of the wondrous light of my form, their tongue faculty becomes penetrating and luminous, able to distinguish all dharmas, articulate their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas.\"*",

Suppose all the worlds in the ten directions—three thousand great thousandfold worlds—were pulverized into motes of dust, and each mote contained ten directions’ worth of boundless worlds. Even if all those boundless worlds were again ground into dust, and this dust were compared to the thousand-millionth part of my bodily light, it would not equal a single portion. Thus, in the boundless lands of the ten directions, if any being encounters this light, their six faculties become luminous and pure, penetrating without obstruction, able to comprehend all dharmas, discern their natures, and perceive their true forms—serene and unchanging—without harming worldly dharmas. Through this radiant adornment, all beings in the boundless, innumerable worlds of motes of dust attain the supreme, true, vajra-like wondrous form, the merit of radiance beyond conception. Even if one were to expound it for kalpas without end, it could not be exhausted.\n\nThereupon, the virtuous practitioners and the great assembly, hearing the Heavenly Worthy expound the wondrous radiance that benefits beings beyond measure, all raised their voices in unison, exclaiming in wonder, “Never before has such virtue been seen! The Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous bodily form, vast treasury of radiance, and adornment of blessings and grace are truly inexhaustible.”\n\nAt that time, Wondrous Form Perfected One, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse on the marvelous bodily radiance—unmatched in heaven or earth—approached, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Great Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I now behold your bodily form, its vast radiance pervading all worlds of motes of dust. Bodhisattvas from other lands and holy assemblies from the ten directions have gathered here, desiring to hear essential teachings. Yet this inconceivable city—is it a common sight? The Wheel of the Supreme Dharma you expound, with its wondrous and peerless radiance—what is its name? I pray you elucidate it, resolve our doubts, and grant this assembly the joy of clarity, that their minds may be at peace and their merit boundless.”\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, delighted and joyful, praised Wondrous Form: “Excellent, excellent! Wondrous Form Perfected One, you skillfully comprehend the nature of all dharmas, your mind unobstructed, and thus you inquire on behalf of the assembly. Listen well, for I shall now expound the marvelous, unfathomable, and unprecedented Dharma. From ancient times, I have revealed teachings for beings, yet never before has such vast radiance illuminated the worlds, nor have assemblies of holy ones from worlds as motes of dust gathered on this Inconceivable Mountain to hear this supreme Dharma. The unsurpassed scripture I proclaim is named *The Wondrous Grove* and also *The Victorious Practice*. Contemplate well this unsurpassed Mahāyāna sūtra of marvelous teachings.\n\nIf any person hears the name of this sūtra, wholeheartedly believes and receives it, reflects upon it with reverence, honors and praises it, comprehends its meaning, and expounds it to others, extolling the Great Dao, know that this person has planted good roots for countless kalpas and accomplished merit. Thus, in this very life, they hear this Mahāyāna sūtra of marvelous teachings. Such a one is the great compassionate father of all beings, awakening all and serving as the guide on the Way. All beings in the world should diligently cultivate merit here, single-minded and unwavering. The Mahāyāna merit attained by such a person is boundless and immeasurable, beyond all reckoning. Suppose all the grasses and trees in the ten directions’ three thousand great thousandfold worlds were cut into inch-long sticks and used to tally this person’s merit—even then, it could not be exhausted. Therefore, all of you who enter this jeweled city and hear the name of *The Mahāyāna Wondrous Grove* shall surely attain the supreme Way, enter eternal bliss, abide in the wondrous land, and accumulate towering merit, no different from mine.”\n\nThereupon, the great assembly, hearing the name of the sūtra, all awakened at once. They raised their hands, snapped their fingers, bowed in reverence, and exclaimed in praise.\n\nThen Treasure Radiance, holding his tablet in solemn dignity, approached, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “By good fortune, I have been permitted to attend this assembly. Earlier, I heard the exposition of the marvelous Mahāyāna sūtra of secret essential teachings, named *The Wondrous Grove* and *The Victorious Practice*. Yet my understanding is shallow; I cannot fathom it myself. Why, Heavenly Worthy, is this scripture named *The Wondrous Grove*? I pray you elucidate it, reveal its essential meaning, enlighten the assembly, benefit all, and resolve our doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Treasure Radiance Perfected One, today you have aroused great compassion, inquiring on behalf of the assembly for the true essential teachings, awakening those to come in ways beyond conception. Return to your seat, and I shall expound it clearly for all, that they may awaken and attain peace and bliss.\n\nThe *Mahāyāna Wondrous Grove Unsurpassed Scripture* I now proclaim possesses boundless, inconceivable merit. It is like a precious grove that bears fruit, nourishing all. Those who consume its blossoms and fruits attain golden radiance, wondrous in every aspect. Likewise, those who hear this sūtra, wholeheartedly receive it, and grasp its meaning attain wisdom, perfect clarity, and a wondrous bodily form. For this reason, it is no different from that grove. Moreover, in that precious grove, roots, trunks, stems, and leaves are all true script, and when a gentle breeze stirs, it emits resonant verses, their sound most marvelous.”",

For this reason, it is also called the *Sublime Cultivation*.\n\nThe assembly of Jeweled Light and others, immeasurable and boundless, upon hearing these essential words, all awakened, bowed together in reverence, and exclaimed their approval.\n\nThen Jeweled Light spoke these verses:\n\n*\"The peerless, skillful Lord of Great Compassion,*\n*Who vows not to abandon the four vast pledges to liberate beings,*\n*Manifests in wondrous, unmoving seated form,*\n*Emitting great radiance that illumines the ten directions.*\n\n*The boundless multitudes of dust-mote lands*\n*All behold the marvelous light of the Dharma-body.*\n*The assembly, pure and unified, of supreme beings,*\n*Is worthy to uphold the rare* Wondrous Grove Sūtra.\n\n*With minds that penetrate the boundless realms,*\n*They proclaim in a mighty voice: ‘True guests indeed!’*\n*I now wish to enter the Land of Eternal Bliss,*\n*And thus summon this assembly to receive and uphold it.*\n\n*The multitude, hearing this, rejoiced greatly,*\n*Flying through space and crossing valleys to arrive as one.*\n*With afflictions exhausted, all are free,*\n*Clearly understanding the Dharma-nature of the Mahāyāna gate.*\n\n*Surrounding and gazing, they listen without weariness,*\n*Advancing in order to bow to the Heavenly Worthy.*\n*Through measureless cultivation of great compassion,*\n*They proclaim the causes long practiced by this assembly.*\n\n*Thus they now hear this rare Dharma,*\n*How excellent this inconceivable gathering!*\n*With merit complete and practice fulfilled, they enter eternal bliss,*\n*And this morning, all doubts are resolved for the assembly.*\n\n*Thus the supremely wise and radiant one,*\n*Pure in conduct and right mindfulness, stirs the three thousand worlds.*\n*Riding this rare and wondrous seat of the great assembly,*\n*He invites all to voice their doubts and questions.*\n\n*Having received this sublime command,*\n*I dare to step forward and speak of this rare light:*\n*The skillful, compassionate discourse on the Dharma-form,*\n*With boundless radiance, uniquely venerable.*\n\n*Those who encounter this illumination attain purity in the six aspects,*\n*Unbroken by worldly dharmas, they realize the true body.*\n*Were all the dust-motes of countless worlds*\n*To be ground to finest particles, their number could not be reckoned.*\n\n*There was also a long-cultivating great being,*\n*Named Wondrous Form, who inquired of the sūtra’s name.*\n*Thus the great compassion descended as a rain of Dharma,*\n*Revealing the titles and chapters in full.*\n\n*Should one encounter and hear this name,*\n*Merit, virtue, and blessings will all be adorned.*\n*Were all the grasses and trees of the three thousand worlds*\n*To be cut into inch-long segments, their count could not be known.*\n\n*I, too, now ride this supreme blessing*\n*To ask further of the sūtra’s name and meaning.*\n*Having received the peerless secret of the Dharma King,*\n*All doubts regarding name and meaning are dispelled.*\n\n*We of this assembly, gathered as one,*\n*Rejoice in having heard the* Wondrous Grove Sūtra.\n*Thus we ascend to the boundless station,*\n*And all beings depart from the clamor of dust.*\n\n*Jeweled Light and the others—*\n*At that time, the great assembly, having heard the verses,*\n*Rejoiced greatly in their hearts, all awakened,*\n*And together bowed their heads before returning to their seats.*\n\n**Chapter Two: Contemplating the True Form**\n\nThen Radiant Realized One stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We of this assembly have heard the Heavenly Worthy speak of this wondrous, rare, and precious radiance. Should anyone in the future encounter this light, they will attain clarity and purity in the six senses, unbroken by worldly dharmas, and realize the true form. Yet this humble one, of inferior understanding, has not grasped this meaning. I do not know whether the worldly and the true form are one or distinct. If they are one, why is it called ‘the worldly’? If the worldly is true, why is it not called ‘true’? If they are distinct, having attained the true form, why is it said to remain unbroken? If the worldly remains unbroken, how can the true be attained? If the worldly remains unbroken yet the true is attained, it is like a seed: if the seed remains unbroken, from where do the sprout, stem, flower, and fruit arise? Thus, these two aspects remain unclear. I humbly beseech your instruction to resolve these doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, you skillfully guide beings to resolve these doubts. Return now to your seat, and I shall expound it for you. You ask whether the worldly and the true form are one or distinct. Now I ask you: in what you see, is it the seeing of dharma or the seeing of form?”\n\nRadiant Realized One answered: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, in the worldly and the true form, is there the seeing of dharma or the seeing of form?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, the true form and the worldly are fundamentally without distinction. It is only that beings have not yet fully penetrated them. They observe only the forms and have not yet seen the dharma. Thus they distinguish between the worldly and the true form, perceiving their forms as different. Now, with the eye of wisdom, observe the worldly form: the form itself is true. To fully understand the true form is called seeing the dharma. For this reason, the worldly is not broken, yet the true form is attained.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked further: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if the worldly is not broken yet the true form is attained, what is the form of the worldly that, when unbroken, is said to be the true form?”",

Moreover, in that precious grove, roots, trunks, stems, and leaves are all true script, and when a gentle breeze stirs, it emits resonant verses, their sound most marvelous.”",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, the form of the worldly is none other than ignorance, attachment, clinging to views, anger, delusion, and all the afflictions—these are the form of the worldly.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked further: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if ignorance, attachment, anger, delusion, and all the afflictions are the form of the worldly, and it is said that without breaking them, the true form is attained—then does the true form still contain attachment? If attachment exists, is it true? Why then speak of cutting off all afflictions to attain the true form?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, what you say is indeed so: the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions. Now, when I speak of cutting them off, it is because beings have not yet seen the dharma and see only ignorance, attachment, delusion, anger, and afflictions. Thus, it is said that by cutting them off, the true form is attained. If one can know that the nature of afflictions is empty, that attachment has never truly existed, and that ignorance is eternally pure, then there is no dharma to cut off. From this, one should understand that the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions. The true form is without form; without form, there is nothing to attain. Ignorance is without dharma; without dharma, there is nothing to cut off. Without cutting off, there is nothing to attain—this is called cutting off afflictions. Without attaining, without cutting off—this is called attaining the true form. From this, one should understand that the true form is attained without cutting off afflictions.”\n\nRadiant Realized One asked again: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if the true form and afflictions are without duality, and because they are without duality, one speaks of attaining the true form—why then does one not speak of attaining afflictions as the true form, since they are also without duality?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Radiant Realized One, as I have just said, there are two kinds: one is the seeing of forms, and the other is the seeing of dharma. Those who see the dharma speak of attaining the true form; those who see forms speak of attaining afflictions. From this, one should understand that those who see the dharma constantly observe the wondrous source and thus attain the true form; those who see forms constantly observe the coarse edge and thus attain afflictions. If one can know that the nature of afflictions is empty and that no dharma has ever existed, and observes the source from the traces, this is called the seeing of dharma. If, on the other hand, one is obscured by ignorance and sees only afflictions, seeing from ignorance, this is called the true form.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If one sees afflictions as existing and also sees the true form, then both afflictions and the true form are afflictions. If one can know that these afflictions are not different from the true form, that the true form is without form, then afflictions and the true form are called the true form.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: You previously asked, ‘For example, if a seed is not broken, from where do the sprout, stem, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit arise?’ Now I ask you: Does the seed break, or does the sprout arise? If the seed breaks, then breaking is without cause; without cause, there is effect—this is impossible. If the sprout arises when the seed breaks, then breaking does not give rise to it; breaking as the cause of arising is also impossible. From this, one should understand that the seed, sprout, stem, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit are neither arising nor breaking, neither cause nor effect, neither not-cause nor not-effect. Afflictions and the true form are also thus: neither before nor after, neither one nor different, neither not-one nor not-different.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: You claim that the sprout arises when the seed breaks. Now I ask you: When the seed breaks and the sprout arises, does it arise at the time of breaking, before breaking, or after breaking? If it arises at the time of breaking, then breaking is arising; if arising is breaking, then arising does not arise. If it arises and then breaks, then arising is breaking; if breaking is arising, then breaking does not break. How can the sprout arise when the seed breaks? It is like shade breaking: when the shade breaks, the body does not arise. Without shade, there is no body—this is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that if the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise; without the seed, there is no sprout—this is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that breaking does not give rise to arising.\n\n“If one says that the sprout arises at the time of breaking, then it shares the same substance as breaking. How can it arise? It is like a single body: all the faculties share the same substance. How can the head break and the foot arise? The head breaking and the foot arising—this is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that when the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise; arising and breaking sharing the same substance is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that at the time of breaking, there is no arising.\n\n“If the sprout arises after breaking, then arising and breaking are separate. How can they be cause and effect? It is like a ruined seed: the seed has already perished, and perishing means no sprout. How can the sprout later arise from a ruined seed? From this, one should understand that there is no arising after breaking; the sprout arising after the seed has broken is also not reasonable. Therefore, I say that after the seed breaks, the sprout does not arise.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: Are the breaking of the seed and the arising of the sprout one, or are they different? If they are one, then breaking is opposed to arising. How can they share the same substance? If breaking is perishing, then there is no arising. How can breaking give rise to arising? If arising is not perishing, how can arising and breaking be different? If they are different, then they are not cause and effect. A non-cause giving rise to an effect is not reasonable. It is like space: space is not the cause of a rabbit’s horn. Space as a non-cause giving rise to a rabbit’s horn as an effect is not reasonable. From this, one should understand that difference also does not give rise to arising. How can there be arising?\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If the sprout arises before breaking, then the seed’s substance has not yet changed. If the sprout arises before the seed changes, then the sprout arises without cause. Without cause, there is effect; without the seed, there is the sprout—this is not reasonable. It is like a formless thing: its shadow does not arise. If the form has not yet arisen and the shadow arises, one should know that this shadow does not arise from the form. It is like sesame seeds: if the sesame seeds have not broken, the oil does not arise. From this, one should understand that there is no arising before breaking. How can there be arising?\n\n“Again, I say to you, Radiant Realized One: If the sprout arises after breaking, then the seed has already perished, and perishing means no cause. If the sprout arises after the seed has perished, then this sprout is just arising and is not an effect. The seed having perished and the sprout arising—this is not reasonable. It is like having no milk: curds do not arise. If there is no milk and yet there are curds, then the curds do not arise from the milk.”",

      "translated_text": "From this, one should know that there is no arising after breaking. How can there be arising? Examining the marks of arising, they are ultimately and eternally extinguished. Since they cannot be obtained, therefore there is no arising.\n\nAt that time, Biàncái rose from his seat, stepped forward with measured dignity, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “I have reflected that all sentient beings drift and surge in birth and death due to ignorance, craving, attachment, and false views. I have further reflected: from where do craving, false views, and ignorance arise, causing sentient beings to drift and surge in birth and death? Does the root of birth and death arise from the mind? From the eye? From the ear? From the nose? From the tongue? From within? From without? From existence? From emptiness? We here assembled truly do not yet understand. We beseech you to explain and resolve our doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Biàncái, true adept, excellent is this question. Return now to your seat, and I shall expound for you. The root of birth and death arises from emptiness and also from existence; from within and also from without; from the nose and also from the tongue; from the eye and also from the ear. Fundamentally, it does not arise, yet it also arises from the mind. Why is this? Because the mind-dharma is empty. Since the mind-dharma is empty, ignorance is also empty; since ignorance is empty, craving and attachment are also empty; since craving and attachment are empty, birth and death are also empty; since birth and death are empty, the eye-dharma is also empty; since the eye-dharma is empty, the ear-dharma is also empty; since the ear-dharma is empty, the nose-dharma is also empty; since the nose-dharma is empty, the tongue-dharma is also empty; since the tongue-dharma is empty, inner and outer are also empty; since inner and outer are empty, emptiness and existence are also empty. For these reasons, the root of birth and death arises from emptiness.\n\n“Again, I say to you, Biàncái: the dharma of emptiness is fundamentally empty, and the mind-dharma is also empty. How can the empty dharma give rise to the empty mind-dharma? Since the mind-dharma is empty, it arises from emptiness. This would be like the east, which is fundamentally empty, giving rise to the emptiness of the west. Since you know the east is fundamentally empty and does not give rise to the emptiness of the west, you should know that the dharma of emptiness, being fundamentally empty, does not give rise to the mind-dharma. Since the mind-dharma is empty, it does not arise from emptiness. You should know that the mind-dharma, its mark fundamentally empty, does not give rise to ignorance. Since you know ignorance is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the mind, you should know that ignorance, being fundamentally empty, does not give rise to craving and attachment. Since you know craving and attachment are fundamentally empty and do not arise from ignorance, you should know that craving and attachment, being empty, do not give rise to false views. Since you know false views are fundamentally empty and do not arise from craving and attachment, you should know that false views, being empty, do not give rise to the mind-dharma. Since you know the mind-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from false views, you should know that the mind-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the eye-dharma. Since you know the eye-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the mind, you should know that the eye-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the ear-dharma. Since you know the ear-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the eye, you should know that the ear-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the nose-dharma. Since you know the nose-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the ear, you should know that the nose-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the tongue-dharma. Since you know the tongue-dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the nose, you should know that the tongue-dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the inner dharma. Since you know the inner dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from the tongue, you should know that the inner dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the outer dharma. Since you know the outer dharma is fundamentally empty and does not arise from within, you should know that the outer dharma, being empty, does not give rise to the dharma of existence. Since you know the dharma of existence is fundamentally empty and does not arise from without, you should know that the dharma of existence, being empty, does not give rise to the dharma of emptiness. Since you know the dharma of emptiness is fundamentally empty and does not arise from existence, you should know that the dharma of emptiness, being empty, does not give rise to birth and death. Since you know birth and death are fundamentally empty and do not arise from emptiness, you should know that birth and death do not give rise to birth and death.\n\nAll conditioned afflictions—from this, you should know that conditioned birth and death, in which sentient beings drift and surge, are like clouds in the void, like forms in space, like echoes in a valley, like the moon in water, like reflections in a mirror, like mirages in the heat, like sparks in lightning, like hearing for the deaf, like seeing for the blind, like speech for the mute, like a two-headed crane, like a three-legged chicken, like fur on a tortoise, like horns on a hare—within these are ignorance, craving, attachment, and false views. The root of birth and death is also thus: ultimately all is empty, beyond discourse. It is like the extinction of a lamp, which cannot be sought. The fundamental emptiness of birth and death is also thus—like a great raging fire, like four venomous snakes, not to be approached. The dharma of birth and death is also thus. You and others should cultivate this contemplation, and you will attain the unconditioned and transcend birth and death.”\n\nThereupon, Biàncái and the assembly, having heard these essential words, rejoiced and leapt with joy, exclaiming that they had never before heard the like.

It is like having no milk: curds do not arise. If there is no milk and yet there are curds, then the curds do not arise from the milk.”",

All of you here today have heard this rare Dharma, fully comprehending the true mark, just as it has been expounded. Riding my discourse today, I proclaim it for future generations, so that all beings may come to understand it as clearly as you do now.”\n\nAt that time, the great assembly bowed their heads in reverence and praised its excellence.\n\n**Chapter Three: Discerning the Right from the Deviant**\n\nThen, the Perfected of Universal Equality rose from his seat, stepped forward, and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “I have reflected upon the bodily marks of the Heavenly Worthy—radiant, surpassing, subtle, and inconceivable—like the Diamond King shattering all obstacles. Your wisdom is luminous and clear, all habitual tendencies forever eradicated. You stand alone and steadfast, entering the inconceivable city.\n\nI now wish to ask a question, yet dare not presume to speak. I pray that out of great compassion, you will bestow the guidelines, the stages of cultivation, and their meaning, so that future generations may behold the true and real.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent, Perfected of Universal Equality! You skillfully benefit beings of the future and have raised this question to awaken the deluded. Return to your seat, and I shall expound for you.\n\nAll questions fall into two kinds: the right question and the deviant question. The right question is akin to the Dao; the deviant question is a retinue of Māra.\n\nUniversal Equality asked again: “What constitutes the right? And what the deviant?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “If one asks because of conditioned existence or because of unconditioned existence, this is a deviant question. To ask neither because of conditioned existence nor because of unconditioned existence—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing arising or because of seeing cessation, each is a deviant question. To ask without seeing arising or without seeing cessation—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing abiding or because of seeing decay, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing abiding or without seeing decay—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing transgression or because of seeing merit, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing transgression or without seeing merit—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing purity or because of seeing defilement, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing purity or without seeing defilement—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing ‘is’ or because of seeing ‘is not,’ this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing ‘is’ or without seeing ‘is not’—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing closeness or because of seeing distance, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing closeness or without seeing distance—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing emptiness or because of seeing existence, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing emptiness or without seeing existence—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing suffering or because of seeing joy, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing suffering or without seeing joy—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing sageliness or because of seeing ordinariness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing sageliness or without seeing ordinariness—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing good or because of seeing evil, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing good or without seeing evil—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing giving or because of seeing stealing, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing giving or without seeing stealing—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing precepts or because of seeing transgression, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing precepts or without seeing transgression—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing long or because of seeing short, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing long or without seeing short—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing nobility or because of seeing baseness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing nobility or without seeing baseness—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing gain or because of seeing loss, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing gain or without seeing loss—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing deviance or because of seeing rightness, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing rightness or without seeing deviance—this is a right question.\n\nIf one asks because of seeing a question or because of not seeing a question, this is a deviant question. To ask without seeing a question or without seeing the absence of a question—this is a right question.\n\nAll such categories possess right and deviant. The right and deviant all arise from the mind. What the mind generates is all inverted: seeing existence where there is none, seeing nonexistence where there is none, seeing arising where there is no arising, seeing cessation where there is no cessation, seeing abiding where there is no abiding, seeing decay where there is no decay, seeing transgression where there is no transgression, seeing merit where there is no merit, seeing purity where there is no purity, seeing defilement where there is no defilement, seeing ‘is’ where there is no ‘is,’ seeing ‘is not’ where there is no ‘is not,’ seeing closeness where there is no closeness, seeing distance where there is no distance, seeing emptiness where there is no emptiness, seeing existence where there is no existence, seeing suffering where there is no suffering, seeing joy where there is no joy, seeing sageliness where there is no sageliness, seeing ordinariness where there is no ordinariness, seeing good where there is no good, seeing evil where there is no evil, seeing giving where there is no giving, seeing stealing where there is no stealing, seeing precepts where there are no precepts, seeing transgression where there is no transgression, seeing long where there is no long, seeing short where there is no short, seeing nobility where there is no nobility, seeing baseness where there is no baseness, seeing gain where there is no gain, seeing loss where there is no loss, seeing deviance where there is no deviance, seeing rightness where there is no rightness, seeing a question where there is no question, seeing seeing where there is no seeing—all such views are utterly false, like an illusion, like a dream. Only death is real.\n\nWhy is this so? All dharmas are without mind. To see dharmas with a mind is called deviant seeing. If one can know that all dharmas are without mind and does not generate a mind to see, this is called right seeing. Therefore, know that all questions arising from a mind are deviant questions; only questions without a mind are called right questions.\n\nFor this reason, I do not now instruct all beings to sever afflictions in order to attain the true mark. I merely wish to liberate those beings enmeshed in delusion, and thus expound the two meanings of affliction and the true mark.”",

      "translated_text": "Truly, there is no birth and death, and thus the true mark may be attained. Why is this so? All dharmas are pure, fundamentally without dual aspects, without coming or going. Therefore, I do not now instruct beings to sever afflictions in order to attain the true mark. Though afflictions are spoken of, there are in truth no afflictions to be severed; though constant bliss is spoken of, there is no constant bliss to be longed for. Since there are no afflictions, beings do not lose the true mark; since there is no true mark, I do not now abandon afflictions. If in the latter age there is one who can generate this thought, embody and comprehend the true and real, this is called the Great Vehicle, the cultivation of the true and right practice.\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, all present rejoiced greatly in their minds, and the countless multitudes, of one body with the formless, together entered the true and real. Then the Bodhisattva of the Sagely Practice addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “In the future age, if there are beings who generate a mind of ‘having’ in regard to dharmas, the Great Dao will forever be obscured and will not circulate in the world. If one sees the Three Clarities as a pure realm and longs for it in the mind, such a person, though cultivating merit for kalpas unending, will not attain liberation. Why is this so? The realm of the Three Clarities is called quiescence and extinction, far removed from all dust, not receiving any attachments. If one generates a mind of seeing, one falls into deviant views, does not cultivate the right practice, and is said to have forever lost the supreme Dharma.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Venerable praised the Sagely Practice, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Truly, it is as you have said. Sagely and true one, you have planted the root of virtue in the past, clearly understood the true mark, and attained unimpeded penetration. Thus, today you resolve the doubts of the assembly—this is truly profound and essential. If there is one who, in regard to dharmas, generates a mind of ‘having,’ abandons the defiled realm to seek the bliss of the Three Clarities, forsakes the body of sentient beings to seek the mark of the true Dao, desires to sever afflictions and enter the formless, or seeks to leave all views to attain quiescence and extinction—such a one, I say, is a person of great deviant views and arrogant contempt. It is like a foolish person who, fearing heaven and earth, wishes to flee, yet wherever they go, they do not leave the great earth. Beings are likewise: fearing the body of birth and death, they hastily abandon the three realms, generating a mind of aversion and separation. Yet the body they attain does not depart from birth and death. Such beings have not yet seen the Dharma or sought the mark of the true Dao. Deeply and truly, they are to be pitied.\n\nThe mark of the true Dao is called non-action, without arising or ceasing, neither existent nor non-existent, neither long nor short, neither great nor small, neither form nor mind. To embody this mark is called cultivating the true and right practice of the Dao.”\n\nAgain, he addressed the Sagely Practice: “Worldly beings, their ignorance and hindrances heavy, have the true Dao within their bodies yet cannot perceive it. It is like a foolish person running east and west in search of the color of empty space, yet unable to see that form itself is emptiness. All in the world are likewise: their minds and natures gallop about, desiring to seek the true Dao, yet they do not know that body and mind are the true Dao. It is like a foolish person who sees only bamboo and wood but does not know fire, abandoning the wood to seek fire, not knowing that fire is already within the wood. All in the world are likewise: they abandon the body to seek the Dao, yet do not know the Dao is already within the body. Abandoning wood to seek fire is like a foolish person abandoning form to seek shadow or forsaking sound to seek echo, not knowing that form is the root of shadow and sound the source of echo.\n\nKnow therefore that the deviant views of the world, with their blazing afflictions, are like a forest of thorns, like a thicket of caltrops—one cannot draw near. You, this assembly today, riding the teaching I now proclaim for the future, should know that the Three Clarities are not separate from afflictions, and that the Great Dao is not elsewhere. Simply observe body and mind, cultivate the right practice, and naturally attain liberation, forever leave afflictions behind, and constantly abide in the Three Clarities. Reflect well upon this, and you will naturally be at peace and joyful.”\n\nThereupon, the Sagely Practice again addressed the Heavenly Venerable of Great Virtue, saying: “How can you say that all beings are the true Dao, yet also command the cultivation of the right practice to attain peace and joy? If they are already the Dao, why must they cultivate? It is like a bird with wings—why must it practice flying?”",

      "translated_text": "Just as scaly creatures need not practice swimming, clouds ascend and rain descends without study or learning. If all beings are already the true Dao, why must they cultivate practice to attain peace and joy? I pray you resolve this doubt.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied, saying: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, excellent is this question. As I have just said, the true Dao and beings are like fire within wood—neither one nor different, neither identical nor separate. The wood contains fire, yet wood is not fire; without wood there is no fire, yet fire is not wood. Wood is not fire, thus they are not one; fire does not depart from wood, thus they are not different. From this you should know that the true Dao and beings are neither one nor different, neither identical nor separate. Beings contain the Dao, yet beings are not the Dao; without beings there is no Dao, yet the Dao is not beings. Beings are not the Dao, thus they are not one; the Dao does not depart from beings, thus they are not different.\n\nFrom this you should know: if you seek fire, seek it within wood, not within ice; if you seek the Dao, seek it within the body, not elsewhere. To seek fire in ice or the Dao in other realms—even if your strength could move mountains, your merit drain the sea, the more strenuously you exert yourself, the more wondrous your efforts, after kalpas of practice, you will only drift farther from the Dao. Therefore, I now tell all beings: if you wish to obtain fire, you must apply human effort, prepare the drilling tools, and move your hands with force—only then will you see fire. For beings learning the Dao and cultivating the right practice, it is likewise: you must accumulate good merit, prepare the seeds of wisdom, observe within this body, and move the spirit of the mind—only then will you see the Dao. For this reason, I command beings to cultivate the correct and true, that they may attain peace and joy.\n\nFish need not practice swimming in empty water, yet they must exert themselves to ascend and descend; birds do not take empty flight or depart through water—true Dao and beings are not of this kind. Clouds ascend and rain descends without awareness or intention, without study or learning. Such phenomena belong to the mundane world and cannot be compared to the true Dao. Reflect well upon this, and you will naturally gain understanding.”\n\nThereupon, Sagely Practice again addressed the Heavenly Venerable of Great Virtue, saying: “When beings seek the Dao within the body rather than elsewhere, is emptiness within the body? Or does emptiness lie elsewhere?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, thirty-six questions of this kind are called perverse views.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked: “Great Virtue Heavenly Venerable, do you see fire in wood and water in ice, yet no fire in ice and no water in wood?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, for those who have not yet awakened, I conform to worldly appearances.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked the Heavenly Venerable: “Is there fire in ice? Is there water in wood?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, in empty space you see all forms and images.”\n\nSagely Practice again asked the Heavenly Venerable: “In seeking fire in ice or water in wood, is this the correct perspective?”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: “Sagely Practice, true scholar, to seek the Dao within the body, extinguish all conditioned actions, and thereby attain liberation—this is not the correct path. If you seek the true Dao, simply observe the body; if you seek empty space, simply observe all phenomena. Observe the true aspect of the body: the Dao arises from the body, also from the mind, from the eyes and ears, from the nose and tongue, from the four great elements, from the hundred parts of the body. Observe the true aspect of things: emptiness arises from heaven, also from earth, from the self, from others, from water and fire, from grasses and trees, from the ten directions, from the myriad things.\n\nFor this reason, I expound this scripture to deliver the dust-mote multitude, yet I have never seen a single being who has received deliverance. Why? My eye is empty, beings are also empty—emptiness is without distinction. Because I distinguish emptiness, my eye’s wisdom is bright and pure, able to observe all things with unimpeded penetration. I observe the three thousand great thousand worlds, past and future, all beings—all have already received deliverance. For this cause, I say that within emptiness all infinite forms and images are complete.”\n\nThereupon, Sagely Practice and the great assembly, having heard these essential words, all rose to bow and spoke in verse:\n\nPossessing all wisdom,\nExcellent and wondrous Venerable One,\nYou expound this subtle and marvelous Dharma,\nRight and wrong most clearly distinguished.\nInverted views give rise to grasping and rejection,\nThe correct and true are neither existent nor nonexistent.\nThe mind’s dharmas are not originally present,\nYet with mind, false delusions arise.\nSkillfully conforming to all phenomena,\nWhen phenomena cease, perfect is the correct and true.\nThe correct and true have no further characteristics,\nAfflictions are truly originally empty.\nBeings do not differ from the Dao,\nAll views are without conditioned action.\nWith mind desiring to cut off and sever,\nGreat practice forever does not proceed.\nThe Three Clarities are not distantly wondrous,\nQuiescence and extinction lie within the breast.\nIf you produce the mind’s view,\nWisdom’s fangs will forever be shattered.\nThe Heavenly Venerable expounds this kind,\nCalled the arrogant and indolent.\nLike one who fears the great earth,\nHastening to flee and hide the body,\nThough you race a thousand leagues in a day,\nWithout earth there is no place to contain the body.\nDisdaining the body to seek the Dao,\nSeeing the Dao yet not forgetting the body,\nClinging to the body, the Dao is distant,\nBirth and death become instead your kin.\nThe utmost true is without arising or ceasing,\nThe Great Dao is apart from severance and constancy.\nIf you embody this wondrousness,\nYou are called one who cultivates the correct and true.\nBeings, burdened by heavy obstructions,\nLose the Dao and see only the body.\nTaking the body to seek the Dao,\nObserving form yet not knowing emptiness.\nLike the foolish seeing wood,\nNot knowing whence fire comes.\nEcho and shadow are not far removed,\nForm and sound are the root source.\nPerverse views give rise to afflictions,\nA thicket of thorns and brambles.\nWith views arise poison and harm,\nWounding the body—how is this different?\nThe Three Clarities are afflictions,\nThe Great Dao surely lies within this body.\nLike fire within wood,\nWith drilling tools and human effort.\nAccumulate goodness to seek the true Dao,\nPeace and joy will meet the correct and true.\nExpounding the scripture to deliver all,\nIts measure cannot be reckoned.\nIlluminating the original coming and going,\nAll who receive deliverance are but empty claims.\nEmpty space is surely without bounds,\nBeings—where do they find refuge?”",

Reflect well upon this, and you will naturally be at peace and joyful.”\n\nThereupon, the Sagely Practice again addressed the Heavenly Venerable of Great Virtue, saying: “How can you say that all beings are the true Dao, yet also command the cultivation of the right practice to attain peace and joy? If they are already the Dao, why must they cultivate? It is like a bird with wings—why must it practice flying?”",

The true nature of afflictions is without distinction, its meaning profound and obscure. We, this assembly, have personally received your sacred decree and had our doubts resolved. Yet for future beings whose minds have not yet awakened, upon hearing this great Dharma, how may they come to understand it? Your Holiness has said that the Three Clarities are not distant, that the Dao resides within this very body. When all beings hear that the Dao is within the body but do not comprehend this meaning, their doubts only deepen. By what method may their doubts be dispelled, allowing all beings to abide in peace and joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent, Great Compassionate Perfected One! Through boundless kalpas, you have borne the suffering and afflictions of all beings, and thus today you have fittingly raised this question. Now return to your seat, and I shall expound for you, so that all future beings of sincere heart may attain peace and joy. If there are beings who enter my Dharma-gate and hear my wondrous teachings yet cannot fully comprehend them, they should be consoled with three methods to settle their minds and awaken understanding. What are these three methods?\n\nFirst, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet believe and accept it, they should cultivate the Five Precepts to discipline their bodies, preventing dissipation. Let the five roots be bright and pure, their natures harmonized, fearless in the Dharma, and capable of receiving it.\n\nSecond, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet fully understand it, they should apply the Three Samadhis to stabilize their minds, preventing distraction. Let their minds be upright and tranquil, their natures and qi harmonized, fearless in the Dharma, and capable of reciting and upholding it.\n\nThird, if there are beings who hear this Great Vehicle but cannot yet fully perceive it, they should pervade body and mind with the Six Wisdoms, removing all obstacles. Let their inner and outer be bright and pure, body and mind serene and clear, wisdom penetrating empty space, and the true nature be clearly seen. Fearless in the Dharma, they will be capable of entrustment.\n\nWhat are the Five Precepts?\n\nFirst, if the eye-root clings to forms, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those forms as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s eye-root is no different from them.\n\nSecond, if the ear-root clings to sounds, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those sounds as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s ear-root is no different from them.\n\nThird, if the nose-root clings to fragrances, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those fragrances as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s nose-root is no different from them.\n\nFourth, if the tongue-root clings to flavors, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those flavors as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s tongue-root is no different from them.\n\nFifth, if the body-root clings to dharmas, one should apply the Great Precepts of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating those dharmas as subject to change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to. Observe that one’s body-condition is no different from them.\n\nWhat are the Three Samadhis?\n\nFirst, if a being’s mind is scattered and clings to many things, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as illusion, dream, mirage, or lightning—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, the mind will not scatter. This is called *peaceful samadhi*.\n\nSecond, if a being’s mind is scattered and prone to anger, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as echo, resonance, mist, or cloud—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, there will be no anger. This is called *Dharma samadhi*.\n\nThird, if a being’s mind is scattered and prone to delusion and arrogance, one should apply the Great Samadhi of the Wondrous Forest, contemplating all in the world as wind, space, bubble, or shadow—unreal and insubstantial. Knowing their unreality, there will be no delusion or arrogance. This is called *decisive samadhi*.\n\nWhat are the Six Wisdoms?\n\nFirst, having understood that forms change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the eye-root is purified. This is called *seeing wisdom*.\n\nSecond, having understood that sounds change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the ear-root is purified. This is called *hearing wisdom*.\n\nThird, having understood that fragrances change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the nose-root is purified. This is called *penetrating wisdom*.\n\nFourth, having understood that flavors change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the tongue-root is purified. This is called *discerning wisdom*.\n\nFifth, having understood that all dharmas change with time, momentary and impermanent, with nothing to cling to, the body-condition is purified. This is called *awakening wisdom*.\n\nSixth, having understood that the Three Poisons change with time, momentary and impermanent, with no obstructions, the mind-root is purified. This is called *penetrating wisdom*.\n\nGreat Compassionate Perfected One, in the latter age of the world, all beings who wish to enter the Dharma-gate should apply these three methods to settle their minds, removing all fear. Once fear is gone, they will naturally abide in peace and joy, body and mind firm and unshaken. The Six Wisdoms will be bright and pure, penetrating without obstruction, and all in the world will be perceived as wondrous forms. From this, know that one may realize the true nature without severing afflictions.\n\nYou, this assembly, must not lightly show this Dharma to the unworthy. A single moment of doubt or slander will prevent rebirth for ten thousand kalpas.”",

      "translated_text": "Beware, beware most carefully.\n\nAt that time, Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We in this assembly, having heard the Great Dharma, leap with joy in body and mind, finding bliss and peace, attaining fearlessness beyond all thought. Yet some doubts remain obscure, and we dare not presume to present them. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to deign to grant us a hearing.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, if you have doubts like a net, ask freely whatever you wish. I shall distinguish and explain, revealing what has not yet been heard.”\n\nThereupon, Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Great Virtue, Dharma King, why do you say that if there are beings who wish to enter the Dharma-gate, they should apply these three methods to settle their minds and attain peace and joy? Are all beings originally possessed of a deviant mind? If they have a mind, its nature is already fixed—how then can you say that by these three methods one may settle the mind and attain fearlessness? If they originally have no mind, how can it be settled? And why now do you speak of applying these three methods to settle the mind and attain stability?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent is this question. Listen carefully, listen carefully. I shall distinguish and explain, so that all in future ages may resolve their doubts. Perfected One of Pervasive Attainment, the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising. How is the mind-Dharma of all beings like arising? Do all beings originally have arising? If there is arising, from whence does it come? Do all beings originally have no arising? If there is no arising, why do we see arising bodies? You in this assembly—do you see the body as existing or as non-existing?”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration replied: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, we in this assembly see the body as non-existent. Why? Because the prior form perishes, and the subsequent form arises.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma is likewise. It is neither existent nor non-existent, arising and perishing moment by moment. The prior mind perishes and does not become the cause of the later; the later mind arises and is not the fruit of the prior. Therefore, I say that the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if you say that the mind-Dharma of all beings is like arising, and arising-Dharma sees arising, then arising-Dharma is like the mind—can the mind be seen?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma can be seen. If you wish to see the mind-Dharma, it is like seeing arising. Arising has no fixed location; if you wish to see the mind-Dharma, it likewise has no fixed location.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if you say that the mind-Dharma is like arising, both without fixed location, how then can it be settled to attain peace and joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, can the body be settled?”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration answered: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, the body-Dharma, moment by moment, cannot be settled.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, the mind-Dharma is likewise—it cannot be settled.”\n\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration again said: “Great Virtue, Heavenly Worthy, if it cannot be settled, why did you earlier say to settle the mind and attain joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Pervasive Penetration, because one sees the body as existing, one is enabled to settle it. Once settled, one knows the mind as neither existent nor non-existent. Neither existent nor non-existent—this is called attaining the true mind, and thus one attains peace and joy. Therefore, I now apply these three methods to settle the mind and attain peace and joy.”\n\nWhen the great assembly heard the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, all awakened to understanding. With one voice, they praised it as excellent and spoke these verses:\n\nThe Dharma King, Great Compassionate Worthy of the Three Realms,\nSeated upright in body, beyond all thought—\nFor the multitudes, he expounds this subtle, wondrous Dharma,\nOpening the supreme cause for all beings’ awakening.\nThus we know afflictions are one with true form,\nUnderstanding the Dao-field as equal to ignorance.\nIn the beginner’s mind, not yet purified,\nGreat compassion employs skillful means to dispel deep darkness.\nThus the Heavenly Worthy expounds and reveals,\nThe wondrous grove of three methods enlightening the beginner’s mind.\nThe Five Precepts observe the body, the five roots become still;\nThe Three Samādhis gather the mind, the Three Poisons are removed.\nThe One Vehicle pervades the three thousand lands,\nThe Six Wisdoms are cultivated anew, the nine nights purified.\nAwakening to the illusory dream as not truly existent,\nYet the non-truly-existent Dharma is also not empty.\nThus one dwells in the Land of Peace and Joy,\nWhere neither emptiness nor illusory existence is ever absent.\nThis abiding is not apart from the human realm,\nWhere wondrous forms in the world are most marvelous.\nWhat was once unenlightened was called affliction;\nNow, in great awakening, it is named the True Immortal.\nOne body with two names, seen according to the perceiver—\nThe good sees two names as one body.\nPerfected One of Pervasive Penetration, supreme and unsurpassed,\nHolds this earnest devotion ever in mind.\nHe asks of all beings’ arising and attainment:\nDo they have a mind? Is the mind without mind? How is it fixed?\nNow, by the great compassion of the supreme secret,\nWe know beings have a mind, and the mind is like arising.\nThe arising-Dharma is neither non-existent nor existent;\nThe mind that has a mind is neither existent nor non-existent.\nPrior arising and later arising do not continue;\nHaving a mind and having no mind do not condition each other.\nSeeing the body as non-existent is like the mind-Dharma;\nSeeking the mind as non-absent is like seeing the body.\nIf one can know body and mind as neither identical nor different,\nHow can one cling to body and mind as definitely existent or non-existent?\nSpeaking of the two extremes, there is no duality;\nForgetting the one middle, where is the center?\nIn the two extremes and the middle, nothing is possessed—\nProfound and subtle, wondrous beyond all thought.\nThus body and mind can be settled,\nAnd the true mind abides forever through ten thousand kalpas.”\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy had heard the verses spoken by the great assembly, he addressed all the Perfected Ones: “You in this assembly have deeply understood the Dharma-forms in this seat, finding bliss and peace. Truly, as you have said, there is no difference. In future ages, may all beings likewise attain awakening.”\n\nAt that time, the great assembly all rejoiced, bowed their heads in reverence, received the command, and withdrew together.\n\nChapter Five: The Youth’s Questions\n\nAt that time, a youth in attendance named Wisdom Illuminated rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, bowed in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, whose subtle and wondrous radiance universally illumines the ten directions, the worlds as numerous as motes of dust, and all lands—where innumerable multitudes of Perfected Ones and sages, beyond reckoning, have gathered together in the inconceivable city. The land is level and even, the palaces rare and wondrous, accommodating motes of dust in number without crowding or constraint.”",

Encountering the radiance of this precious light, they have entered this assembly—how rare and unfathomable! Hearing this *Wondrous Grove*, we rejoice without limit. We beseech you to bestow your teaching and awaken those of the future.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the youth, saying: “Excellent, excellent, Wisdom Illuminated! You have skillfully aroused the subtle and wondrous conditions, enabling those of future ages to resolve their doubts. This inconceivable mountain is called the Hall of Great Blessing, where one departs from birth and death, and the land is pure and undefiled—beyond the perception of the Two Vehicles. Here, the Heavenly Worthies of the three times—past, future, and present—gather in assembly. A single mote of dust contains eighty thousand beings, and all is inconceivable: the palaces and couches, the hundred flavors of sweet fragrances, the garments and bedding, the flowers and fruits, the groves and trees, the bathing pools suffusing the body—all are composed of the seven treasures. Whatever is needed arrives at the thought. This land of virtue and power is beyond conception. My words today cannot exhaust its description.\n\nIn the lands of the ten directions and the three thousand worlds, all the dust-mote multitudes of Perfected Ones gather in assembly—all are superior beings, pure and undivided, their wisdom perfectly luminous, having fully understood the nature of all dharmas. Over countless kalpas, they have planted the roots of virtue. Thus, on this day, they encounter the radiant light and assemble here. Seeing me today expound the great and subtle Mahāyāna teachings, universally delivering boundless beings, they hear the name of this scripture, the *Wondrous Grove*, even a single chapter or verse. Know that such a person, though their body be but dust and sand, and their three karmic actions have committed manifold transgressions, shall all be purified and no longer suffer retribution. If any being hears the name of this scripture and recites even a single chapter or verse, wherever they are born, they shall dwell in a pure land, their clothing and food abundant, lacking nothing. Having heard this scripture, they shall not fall into the three evil destinies, nor encounter the knife mountains, sword trees, copper pillars, or burning coals; the iron beds of freezing ice and all suffering retributions shall naturally be destroyed. Wherever they go, they shall abide in bliss, and weapons, disasters, and poisonous beasts shall not harm them.”\n\nThe youth asked again: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, we pray you expound further: What practices do the Perfected Ones cultivate? By what power of mind do they perceive the nature of all dharmas, attain mastery, and penetrate without obstruction? How do they encounter this sacred scripture and hear the subtle and wondrous Dharma?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Wisdom Illuminated, the Perfected Ones’ practice is this: in all dharmas, they harbor no expectations, for their minds and natures are extinguished. Observing all forms, they do not generate attachment, knowing the eye is empty. Hearing all sounds, they do not generate attachment, knowing the ear is empty. Smelling all fragrances, they do not generate attachment, knowing the nose is empty. Tasting all flavors, they do not generate attachment, knowing the tongue is empty. Holding all treasures, they do not generate attachment, knowing the hand is empty. Walking on level ground, they do not generate attachment, knowing the foot is empty. Seeing the heavens, they do not delight, knowing there is no self. Seeing the hells, they do not fear, knowing there is no suffering. Seeing others give, they do not rejoice, knowing there is no gain. Seeing others plunder, they do not rage, knowing there is no loss. Hearing praise, they do not delight, knowing there is no fame. Facing slander, they do not resent, knowing there is no harm. Seeing the Jade Capital Mountain, they do not deem it high, for it has no ‘tall’ aspect. Seeing mounds and resting places, they do not deem them low, for they have no ‘short’ aspect. Seeing the kalpa trees, they do not deem them distant, for they have no ‘long-lived’ aspect. Seeing the hibiscus flowers, they do not deem them fleeting, for they have no ‘short-lived’ aspect. Seeing the Great Brahmā Heaven, they do not deem it vast, for it has no ‘great’ aspect. Seeing the tip of a hair, they do not deem it fine, for it has no ‘small’ aspect. Seeing raging fires, they do not deem them hot, for they have no ‘burning’ aspect. Seeing the vast seas, they do not deem them wet, for they have no ‘moist’ aspect. Seeing carvings and paintings, they do not deem them skillful, for they have no ‘artful’ aspect. Seeing the dull and inarticulate, they do not deem them foolish, for they have no ‘clumsy’ aspect. Seeing almsgiving, they do not deem it difficult, for they have no ‘wealth’ aspect. Seeing greed and stinginess, they do not deem them regrettable, for they have no ‘miserly’ aspect. Seeing all beings, they do not deem them different, for they have no ‘distinct’ aspect. Seeing the vast emptiness, they do not deem it singular, for it has no ‘non-existent’ aspect. Seeing kin and clan, they do not cling, for they have no ‘loving’ aspect. Seeing enemies, they do not despise, for they have no ‘hating’ aspect. Seeing heaven and earth, they do not deem them enduring, for they have no ‘abiding’ aspect. Seeing lightning, they do not deem it swift, for it has no ‘departing’ aspect. Seeing the sun rise, they do not deem it east, for it has no ‘emerging’ aspect. Seeing the sun set, they do not deem it west, for it has no ‘sinking’ aspect. Without west, without sinking, for there is no sun’s setting. Without east, without emerging, for there is no sun’s rising. Thus should you know: the Perfected Ones see dharmas yet do not see, for by not seeing, they dwell today in the pure land, encounter the rare and wondrous light, and hear me expound the great and subtle Mahāyāna scriptures. With single-minded faith, they comprehend and uphold them.”\n\nAt that time, a youth in attendance named Good Faith rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and with single-minded devotion gazed upon the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, your words are profoundly deep and subtly wondrous, beyond conception. If there are beings who hear this Dharma, by what power of mind may they attain awakening?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good Faith, if there are beings who encounter this scripture yet cannot fully comprehend it, they should contemplate their own bodies with wisdom: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and all faculties—are they defiled or undefiled? Do they arise from causes?”",

The land is level and even, the palaces rare and wondrous, accommodating motes of dust in number without crowding or constraint.”",

If one claims there is a self, and that the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements to form this self, one should reflect thus: the four great elements are by nature empty—how then can they combine? If the four great elements are empty yet combine to form this body, and the body arises from the four great elements, then since the four great elements are empty, this body is also empty. Why? Because it is fundamentally empty. If one claims that this body, the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements, yet the four great elements are distinct in nature—how can they combine? If the four great elements are distinct yet combine to form this body, then since the body arises from the four great elements, this body is also distinct. Why? Because it is fundamentally distinct. If one claims that this body, the eyes, ears, and all faculties arise from the four great elements, yet the four great elements do not combine—then how does this body come to be? If the four great elements combine to give rise to this body, yet they do not truly combine, then what combines to give rise to this body? Tigers, deer, snakes, and rats do not share the same nature—how then can they combine to give rise to anything? From this, one should know that this present body is like wind, like a shadow, like dew, like lightning, like an illusion, like a dream, like an echo, like a reverberation—ultimately quiescent and extinguished, utterly without cause. To know and see thus is called the contemplation of Dharma. Through this power of mind, one may generate the gates of all virtues, abide in the Three Clarities, and ever dwell in the Pure Land. In all views, the mind remains unshaken, and with single-minded wisdom, one observes all myriad kinds as wholly pure.”\n\nThe youth Good Faith, having heard this, rejoiced in his heart and marveled at what he had never before encountered. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:\n\n“What I now expound,\nAll the Heavenly Worthies proclaim:\nPast and future alike,\nAll share the power of one mind.\nThe dust-motes of the ten directions,\nAll the Dharma Kings therein—\nEach expounds the subtle and wondrous meaning,\nThe One Vehicle of the supreme scripture.\nShould even one person hear\nA single chapter or verse,\nAnd vow with resolve to uphold it,\nProclaiming it to future ages—\nSuch a good man,\nOr such a good woman,\nWherever they walk or dwell,\nNo plague or calamity shall dare harm them.\nIf one single-mindedly contemplates,\nThe five sufferings shall be utterly dispelled.\nAgain, they ask of the true adept,\nThe extraordinary causes of their practice.\nThe Dharma attained by the true person:\nObserving the body, they know it is wholly empty.\nSuffering and joy are not two,\nHatred and love are all the same.\nHigh and low share no distinct path,\nGreat and small differ not in form.\nThe sun’s rising is not its first union,\nThe sun’s setting—how could it be its final extinction?\nEast and west have no fixed place,\nRising and setting follow no single direction.”\n\n“They ask further: by what power of mind\nMay one attain this contemplation of equality?\nI reveal the contemplation of wisdom,\nWhereby all limbs and joints dissolve and merge.\nThe four great elements do not truly combine,\nAs tigers and deer do not share the same herd.\nKnowing thus the illusory and unreal,\nDew and lightning are all empty.\nUltimately without arising or ceasing,\nThe sun of the mind in Dharma contemplation shines bright.\nEver dwelling in the Pure Land,\nEternal joy knows no end.”\n\nAt that time, the youth in attendance and all the great assembly, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s subtle verses, rejoiced and leapt for joy, marvelling at what they had never before encountered. Thereupon, the entire assembly bowed their heads in unison, praising in one voice, and withdrew after making reverence.\n\nChapter Six: Following in Accordance\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy addressed Traversing All-Pervasively, saying: “In the latter age, should there be one who comprehends what I have expounded, extols its wondrous meaning, and proclaims it to those who have not yet heard, enabling them to awaken and embody its profound essence, not clinging to mere words, and knowing the nature of all dharmas to be without attachment—know that such a person has long since planted and perfected meritorious roots in the presence of immeasurable, boundless Heavenly Worthies. The people of the world, wherever such a person dwells, shall provide and offer clothing, food, bedding, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all necessities for sustaining life and healing.

This person, in a former life, once entered the jeweled city, heard my sublime and wondrous scriptures of the Great Vehicle, and was reborn in the lower realms to proclaim my true teaching. Therefore, I say that making offerings to this person is no different from making offerings to me. Why is this so? Because this person deeply understands my subtle purport, expounding the Dao in accord with what is fitting, without any attachment or stagnation. Thus, making offerings to such a person in the world brings immeasurable merit and virtue.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, what does it mean to expound in accord with what is fitting, speaking in accordance with sentient beings, without attachment?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, the Dao I expound accords with sentient beings: I speak of the One Vehicle, of the dharmas of the three times, of conditioned dharmas, of unconditioned dharmas, of worldly dharmas, of supramundane dharmas, of defiled dharmas, of pure dharmas, of transgressions and blessings, of suffering and joy, of causes and effects—such teachings are called ‘accordance with what is fitting.’ The world of sentient beings is like the illusions conjured by a magician, without any fixed nature. It is also like the visions seen in a nighttime dream, all of which are false and illusory, without any true reality. If there are sentient beings who profoundly comprehend this meaning, such persons are my true disciples, capable of being entrusted with and upholding the treasury of the Dao, ensuring it never ceases.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, in these essential and wondrous teachings that accord with the world, is there no fixed nature, no transgressions or blessings, no suffering or joy?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, the Dao I expound accords with sentient beings: I speak of transgressions as blessings, of blessings as transgressions, of suffering as joy, of joy as suffering. Therefore, the Dao I expound is without fixed certainty.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, what does it mean to speak of transgressions as blessings, of blessings as transgressions, of suffering as joy, of joy as suffering? If there is no fixed nature, how do all sentient beings cultivate and transcend the cycle of birth and death to attain true liberation?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, when I speak of transgressions as blessings, it is because all transgressions committed by sentient beings are fundamentally empty in nature, without any inherent existence. When I speak of blessings as transgressions, it is because all blessings cultivated by sentient beings involve the mind’s hope and attachment to those blessings. The same applies to teachings on suffering and joy, causes and effects. From this, you should understand that my teachings on transgressions and blessings, suffering and joy, causes and effects are also without fixed nature. If one can know that all dharmas are unfixed, the mind is without obstruction and without entanglement—this is called liberation. One no longer transmigrates through the six destinies of birth and death but abides in constant joy and purity, immovably at peace. This is what it means to expound in accord with what is fitting, speaking in accordance with the world. To expound in accord with what is fitting is to guide and draw in sentient beings without fixed nature. By being without fixed nature, sentient beings are enabled to enter a state of certainty, free from fear. They can enter the three realms as guides for the multitude, liberating all immeasurable sentient beings and leading them into constant joy.”\n\nAt that time, Traversing All-Pervasively again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I have reflected within myself that our great assembly, upon hearing these wondrous teachings, understands clearly in our minds and harbors no more doubts. However, in future ages, there will be sentient beings who, upon hearing these profound and subtle teachings, may not be able to resolve their uncertainties. The Heavenly Worthy has spoken of transgressions and blessings, suffering and joy as without fixed nature, all in accordance with sentient beings in the world. With what power of mind does one accord with the world, which is without fixed nature?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, what I now expound is permeated and cultivated by the mind of great compassion. The words, phrases, and sentences I speak in accordance with the world are all expedient means, guiding and receiving in various ways to enable liberation. Conditioned existence is illusory, the afflictions of ignorance are suffering. When one awakens to the nature of dharmas and perceives the true and real, this is called ‘accordance with sentient beings, expounding the Dao in accord with what is fitting.’”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively again asked: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, why do you arouse great compassion for all sentient beings without falsehood or deception?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, it is like someone seeking empty space. If I now speak of space, is that falsehood or deception?”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively replied: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, can empty space be spoken of?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, empty space cannot be spoken of. The space I now speak of is empty, and my speaking is also empty. From this, you should understand that the world is fundamentally illusory, without any inherent existence. When I speak of the world, I do not fall into falsehood. Why is this so? The nature of falsehood is empty, and when I speak of falsehood, my speaking is also empty. Therefore, my speaking does not fall into falsehood.”\n\nTraversing All-Pervasively addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, if all in the world is spoken of as empty, and one accords with sentient beings, what benefit is there?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Traversing All-Pervasively, it is for the sake of transformation and guidance, for the sake of liberation, for entering the gate of emptiness, for extinguishing all views, for realizing the absence of characteristics, for illuminating the absence of action. All conditioned activities are ultimately quiescent and will never arise again. Since there is no arising or ceasing, one abides immovably and constantly. Therefore, I now accord with the world through the mind of great compassion, enabling all sentient beings to attain this great benefit.”\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled rose from his seat, bowed his head in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, how does a perfected one remain unattached to worldly dharmas in the mind?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled, excellent is this question. What do you and the assembly think?”\n\nThe Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled replied: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I have reflected within myself that the conduct of a perfected one is quiescent in mind and nature, without dual characteristics.

      "translated_text": "“Now, observing the dharma, I hear good without joy, hear evil without anger, without marks of love or aversion. My mind and nature are quiescent, without hope. I observe all in the world as if a master of illusion, seeing his illusory creations—knowing them to be unreal, I am without attachment. The perfected one’s vision of all conditioned dharmas in the world is likewise: knowing them to be unreal, he is without attachment.”\n\nAt that time, the attendant acolyte named Superior Form, having heard the perfected one’s discourse, rejoiced greatly, leaping with boundless joy, his words unable to express it. It was as if a nobleman, having lost his beloved son for many days, suddenly saw him restored to life. My joy upon hearing the perfected one’s teaching is the same. Yet some dimness of doubt remains, and I cannot resolve it myself. Advancing, I bow my head and address the perfected one: “Greatly Virtuous Perfected One, you have said that the perfected one observes worldly dharmas as without dual characteristics, and because there are no dual characteristics, he is without attachment. If there were attachment, it would be illusory. But if illusory dharmas are like dreams and phantasms—since they are not truly existent—even if they are illusory, what loss is there?”\n\nThe perfected one replied: “Superior Form, you have asked me well, enabling those of the future to resolve their doubts. What I now say is this: if beings cling to conditioned dharmas, that is illusion. When the illusory mind arises, dualistic views appear. If beings can comprehend the non-duality of dual characteristics, they will know that what they see as illusory is itself without illusion. Therefore, what I now teach is this: if there are dualistic views and attachment to the world, that is illusion. Without dualistic views, one observes all illusions as not of the world. Since they are not of the world, there are no dualistic views. Without dualistic views, there is no illusion. From this, know that one who understands illusion observes all in the world as truly without loss.”\n\nSuperior Form again asked: “Greatly Virtuous Perfected One, you have said that illusion arises from dualistic views, that attachment to the world arises from the mind. But before understanding the world and the dharmas of the mind, which is the cause? Which is the effect? Is it the dharmas of the mind that give rise to the world, or is it the world that gives rise to the dharmas of the mind? If there were no dharmas of the mind, who would perceive the world? If there were no world, what would the mind perceive? If you say the dharmas of the mind perceive the world, then before the dharmas of the mind existed, there should be no world. If you say the world is what the mind perceives, then before the world existed, there should be no dharmas of the mind. These two principles I truly cannot comprehend. I pray you expound and clarify what I have not yet heard.”\n\nThe perfected one replied: “Superior Form, I now tell you: the dharmas of the mind and the world are neither cause nor effect, neither prior nor subsequent, neither one nor different, neither existent nor non-existent—yet they are also both existent and non-existent, both one and different, even cause and effect. It is like a hen that gives birth to an egg, and like an egg that gives birth to a hen. Thus, hen and egg are neither cause nor effect, neither prior nor subsequent, neither one nor different, neither existent nor non-existent—yet they are also both existent and non-existent, both one and different, even cause and effect. If you understand non-arising, there is no such question. If you seek attainment, it is a perverse question. One who asks perverse questions forever loses the vast Mahāyāna vision.\n\n“Superior Form, how can you seek the marks of life in an empty valley’s echo, or seek the sprouts of grain in scorched seeds? The dharmas of the mind and the world are likewise: ultimately and eternally extinguished, they cannot be discussed. They are like a great poison—one cannot taste them; like a raging fire—one cannot draw near. To speak of the marks of the world or the dharmas of the mind is like a blind man describing colors or a deaf man describing sounds—ultimately without cause, they cannot be discussed.”\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Truly as you have said. You have skillfully distinguished that the dharmas of the mind and the world are both without existence and cannot be spoken of—profound and essential words.”\n\nThereupon, the great assembly, having heard these words, rejoiced greatly and spoke in verse:\n\nWonderful and wondrous, the Venerable One,\nWho raised such questions.\nIf even one person hears and understands\nThe profound and subtle meaning,\nProclaiming and transmitting this great dharma,\nRevealing and awakening those to come—\nKnow that this great being\nHas planted boundless merit.\nAll beings in the world\nShould attend to such a one,\nSupplying what he lacks,\nHis merit beyond measure.\nOne who understands this profound truth\nIs a true child of my dharma,\nUpholding the wondrous forest of scriptures,\nAble to nurture supreme talent.\nUnderstanding my expedient teachings,\nThat suffering and joy have no inherent cause—\nLike a great master of illusion\nSeeing his illusory creations,\nThough conforming to worldly dharmas,\nWith wisdom, the mind is without attachment.\nDrawing forth all sentient beings,\nThey decisively enter the Mahāyāna,\nComprehending the nature of the world,\nLiberated without distinct calamities.\nNow I speak of the world\nWithout falling into illusion.\nQuestioning emptiness, one seeks form;\nDiscerning emptiness, one follows the occasion.\nPerfected One of Great Virtue,\nFor the assembly, you inquired about the mind’s conduct.\nHaving received the supreme response,\nYou declared your past practices:\nThough conforming to worldly dharmas,\nWhat you saw was without illusion.\nSuperior Form, true acolyte,\nNot yet fully understanding, raised his doubts.\nThe perfected one skillfully resolved them,\nLike ice melting away.\nThe dharmas of mind and world\nAre neither effect nor cause.\nOne who knows the blind man describes colors—\nWhy trouble to speak of an empty valley?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy praised the perfected one,\nAnd the great assembly all opened their hearts.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of the Inconceivable City, having spoken these verses, addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, we pray that your great compassion not abandon its vast resolve. Bestow the great radiance to illuminate the infinite worlds below, allowing those inferior beings to behold the precious light, dispelling their ignorant darkness, and forming karmic connections with the Dao, so that the Dao may return to its origin.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy flicked his fingers, and from his palm emerged the supreme precious light, round as a mirror, penetrating the lower realms to illuminate infinite lands—even the three evil destinies and the suffering souls of the Nine Dark Realms—all became bright and clear, perfectly pure.",
      "overlap_context": "uous Heavenly Worthy, how does a perfected one remain unattached to worldly dharmas in the mind?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled, excellent is this question. What do you and the assembly think?”\n\nThe Perfected One of Virtue Fulfilled replied: “Greatly Virtuous Heavenly Worthy, I have reflected within myself that the conduct of a perfected one is quiescent in mind and nature, without dual characteristics. If there were dual characteristics, it would be illusory.”",

The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings, replete with profound analogies, are not what the Two Vehicles could ever hear or perceive. How excellent is this gathering, never before experienced!

Now, let each of you reveal the practices of the perfected, so that these youths and all beings of future ages may comprehend the secret essentials and esoteric practices of the perfected.”\n\nAt that time, the perfected being named Wondrous Form addressed the assembly of youths: “Now, with one mind, listen attentively. We, the assembly of perfected beings, shall broadly expound the practices of the perfected in observing the nature of all dharmas, revealing what has never been heard, so that all may awaken. The practices of the perfected begin with receiving all precepts and observing all decorum, just as when good men and women in the world hear the Dharma and their minds leap with joy, free from doubt, generating resolute conviction. So too do the perfected: from kalpas immeasurable in the past to the present, in all the precepts they uphold and decorum they observe, their minds leap with joy, free from doubt, generating resolute conviction without regression. This is called the perfected’s observance of precepts in contemplating the nature of dharmas, cultivating resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Jeweled Radiance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the practices of the perfected are grounded in the Four Immeasurable Minds, firm and unshakable, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Illuminating Brilliance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all dharmas and decisively attain the unsurpassed Dao, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Universal Equality addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected guide all beings without partiality, regarding them as their own children, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Sagely Conduct addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in their right conduct, remain free from distracting thoughts and contemplate all forms without differentiation, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected enter into suffering and hardship to rescue beings without wavering, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Pervasive Penetration addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected reflect inwardly and contemplate all beings as nothing but reality itself, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Virtue Fulfilled addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in all dharmas, discern without obstruction, subdue external paths, and lead others to correctness, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Swift Salvation addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all natures as fundamentally pure and inconceivable, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected Guide addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, in body, speech, and mind, guide beings without falsehood, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Loving Kindness addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected contemplate all dharmas as entirely real, nothing apart from the true Dao, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Penetrating Form addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, when harassed by all demonic hordes, remain free from anger, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Lofty Attainment addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing beings trapped in the cycle of birth and death, feel no delight, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”",

Perfected of Skillful Transformation addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected know that the dharmas of the world possess neither abiding nor departing marks, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Serene Samādhi addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, expounding the Dharma for beings, do not conceive of dharmas, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Radiance addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with wisdom, extinguish immeasurable transgressions, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Wondrous Flower addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected see the Heavenly Worthies and the trees of merit and virtue filling the lands in the ten directions, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Great Compassion addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing the suffering of beings, do not become distant, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Luminous Wisdom addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, seeing the deluded, instruct them in severance, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nThe Perfected of Jeweled Canopy addressed the youth Good Vision: “Good Vision, if the perfected, with non-action, shelter and protect all, bringing them peace and security, this is called the perfected’s contemplation of the nature of dharmas, attaining resolute conviction.”\n\nAt that time, the innumerable youths seated in attendance, having heard the subtle, wondrous, and true Mahāyāna teachings—essential, profound, and far-reaching—each awakened, simultaneously praised them as excellent, paid their respects, and withdrew.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Contemplating the Nature of Dharmas**\n\nThen the Perfected of Liberated Life arose from his seat, bowed his head, and respectfully inquired of the Heavenly Worthy: “As was just expounded, the contemplation of the nature of dharmas by the perfected is without expectation, knowing the emptiness of dharmas. If this is the case, how do they adorn all beings to attain the Dao?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, all beings are fundamentally pure in nature, devoid of anything, akin to empty space. The nature of the Dao is also empty; since the nature of the Dao is empty, how can you ask how all beings attain the Dao? The nature of beings and the nature of the Dao are not two. The nature of beings is illusory; all illusory natures are called the nature of dharmas. Within the nature of dharmas, there is no attainment or loss, no increase or decrease. Therefore, I say that all beings attain the true mark without severing afflictions.”\n\nThe Perfected of Liberated Life again inquired: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, if as you have said, all beings naturally abide in bliss without cultivating vows and practices—”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, within the nature of dharmas, is there cultivation of vows and practices to attain bliss? The so-called bliss arises from the mind; the nature of the mind is fundamentally empty. How can there be cultivation? If there is bliss, it is called desire. Knowing the emptiness of all dharmas is true bliss.”\n\nThe Perfected again asked: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, since all beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent, why is it said that all beings, through immeasurable kalpas of cultivating merit and virtue, gather the inconceivable and dwell in pure lands?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, it is like a sorrowful person whose mind is confused, afflicted by vexation and heat. Before this person, various illusions are displayed—wooden men and women, wooden oxen and horses—arranged and performed in various magical arts. The sorrowful one, seeing these, conceives thoughts of oxen and horses, and their afflictions cease, their mind becoming at ease. I am now the same. All beings, deluded by false sorrow and poison, have not yet attained bliss.”",

      "translated_text": "Therefore, I speak of cultivating all virtues—boundless and immeasurable—only then may one be reborn in the inconceivable realm. If one knows that delusion is fundamentally devoid of substance, then every step and action of all beings is itself inconceivable. If one knows purity, freedom, and unimpededness, then every wish of the heart is freely and fully realized. Should one cultivate goodness, one shall be reborn in the wondrous lands of the Three Clarities. Such expedient means serve only to halt false delusion, for in truth, there has never been any hope for the eternal bliss of the Three Clarities.\n\nIf one desires swift attainment of the precious city of the Three Clarities and the realm of eternal bliss, one must ride the great and supreme mind of wisdom, observing the form of one’s own body: from what dharma did it arise through immeasurable kalpas? Knowing it arises from no cause, one knows there is no self. Because there is no self, therefore one’s body eternally abides in the Three Clarities’ realm of eternal bliss.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Liberated Life again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, since the lives of all beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent, illusory and unreal—like dreams, without determinacy—how is it that all good men and women, without severing the three karmas, without practicing the six perfections, without cultivating the four immeasurables, may yet attain the Dao?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, why do you ask such a question? The three karmas of all beings are called impure. Body, speech, and mind arise from nothing; even if one could cultivate them, they would still be illusory. How so? The three karmas are fundamentally pure—what cause is there to cultivate? If there is cultivation, it is because there is impurity. It is like a grave illness: one summons physicians and medicines, skilled in curing all diseases, worth a thousand gold pieces. Though they are welcomed along the road and arrive at the house, in the end, they are not the true remedy. Or like a madman speaking of empty flowers—though he discourses on their subtlety, in the end, they cannot be trusted. All beings who cultivate the body to seek the Dao are likewise.\n\nCultivating the body to seek the Dao entails two afflictions. What are these two? First, because there is evil; second, because one perceives a self. These two views are the great illnesses of the Dao. Therefore, if beings wish to seek the Dao, they must ride the great and supreme mind of wisdom, observing the form of their own body. Once they realize there is no body, the three karmas become pure of themselves. Practicing the six perfections and cultivating the four immeasurable minds—this is called following expedient means to guide and receive. It is like a traveler blocked by the scorching valley, wishing to reach the other shore but having no means to cross. Borrowing a boat, they traverse the depths; once they reach the other shore, the boat they once used is no longer needed. The six perfections and four practices are likewise. For beings who have not yet realized the shore of the unborn Dao, the six perfections are provisionally employed to pacify their minds and bring them to harmony. Once they realize there is no body and attain the ground of the Dao, the six perfections and all practices are no longer needed.”\n\nThe Perfected One of Liberated Life again said: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, the parables you have spoken are essential and profound. All the practices that beings cultivate to seek liberation—once they are liberated, nothing more is practiced. Does this mean that all who become perfected and attain the Dao practice nothing? If there is no practice, should great compassion be lost? How then does the great Dao, for all beings, constantly enact the four vast vows to liberate them from suffering?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: “Perfected One of Liberated Life, the Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, saves and liberates beings from suffering without distinction of self and other, without love or aversion, without formation or decay, without gain or loss. It is like a bridge or boat, mindless in ferrying beings, making no distinction between pure and impure, human or non-human, oxen, horses, mules, or donkeys—all pass through. The Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, practices great liberation without mind, and though liberating beings, there is no self or other, no love or aversion, no formation or decay, no gain or loss. It is like the great sea, receiving a hundred rivers without increase or decrease, without impurity or purity, without mind to discriminate, containing all things. Gold, silver, pearls, crystal, lapis lazuli, giant clams, agate, coral, amber—all treasures are encompassed within. The great treasury of the true Dao is likewise. The Great Net of the Three Clarities, the Four Brahmā Heavens, the Three Realms, the heavens and humans of the five paths, immortals, perfected beings, and great sages—none are not contained within. For this reason, it is mindless and ever-sufficient, without practice, without the marks of going or coming.”\n\nThen the Perfected One of Liberated Life exclaimed: “Venerable Heavenly Worthy, your words are subtle and wondrous, beyond thought and conception. The Dharma I have heard fills me with boundless joy, immeasurable and infinite—such as the Two Vehicles cannot hear or see.” Thereupon, the Perfected One bowed his head in reverence and spoke these verses:\n\n“Wondrous and peerless, supreme and honored One,\nYour subtle and profound Mahāyāna sutra expounds this meaning:\nAll natures are empty, unborn, and undying.\nThe Dao-nature and beings are fundamentally not two;\nWithout relying on cultivation, it is naturally attained.\nDharma-nature and illusion-nature are different names,\nYet purity, quiescence, and extinction share no distinction.\nFrom of old, we were truly sorrowful,\nNot severing afflictions, not realizing true nature.\nOnly now, in this seat, have we heard\nThis subtle and wondrous Mahāyāna Dharma—\nAt last knowing that beings are fundamentally empty and quiescent,\nEternally blissful through immeasurable kalpas.\nRising with desire to cultivate myriad practices,\nNot knowing that practice is empty, fundamentally without cultivation.\nThe great sage provisionally speaks of cultivation,\nLike a magician performing a play.\nWooden oxen and horses belong to the sorrowful one;\nThe person’s sorrow and the wooden horses are both illusory.\nKnowing delusion is fundamentally without substance,\nYet its inverted appearances are inconceivable.\nThe subtle lands of the Three Clarities you speak of\nAre expedient means to guide beings to return to truth.\nRealizing there is no cause and no self,\nOne’s own land is the Three Clarities.\nKnowing one’s body is illusion and dream,\nThe six perfections and four immeasurables are all empty declarations.\nEven if one cultivates without flaw,\nIt is still the delusion of a mind with intention.”",

Some conduct?\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, excellent is this question. The Perfected One’s perception of all conditioned dharmas is like a wise person seeing a mirage in the heat, or a great magician beholding his own illusions—knowing they are not real, the mind holds no expectations. The Perfected One’s perception of all conditioned dharmas is likewise.\n\nThe Perfected One’s perception observes the perceptions of beings;\nThe perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception—how can they be the same?\nThe Perfected One’s conduct accords with the conduct of beings;\nThe conduct of beings is precisely what the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, who have attained the Dao and realized truth, know and perceive—how can the great Dao’s conduct be the same as that of beings?\n\nThe conduct of beings is the meaning of emptiness.\nThe Perfected One’s conduct is the conduct of the Dao, the place of the Dao’s activity.\nThus, the Perfected One’s conduct accords with the conduct of beings—how can the perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception?\n\nThe conduct of beings arises from having conduct;\nFrom having discriminations, from deluded perceptions;\nFrom delusion, the mind clings to things;\nFrom clinging, perceptions differ.\nThus, the perceptions of beings differ from the Perfected One’s perception.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, what dharma does the Perfected One perceive to attain decisive understanding?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, the Perfected One’s perception sees neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned. All conditioned dharmas are entirely delusory. Knowing delusion is empty, without discrimination—this is called true perception. The unconditioned dharma is originally pure, having no existence, and thus nothing is perceived. To comprehend these two perceptions is called pure wisdom. Contemplating the nature of all dharmas as entirely empty—this is called true perception. True perception is luminous and pure—this is called pure wisdom. Therefore, the Perfected One, amid all dharmas, attains decisive understanding, for nothing is perceived.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, if this is so, do all beings who cultivate practice attain nothing?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, why do you speak thus? All beings, if they can know that there is no cause and no effect, no practice and no attainment—this is called cause and effect, this is called practice and attainment. If one arises in perceptions of having attainment, this is called wrong view, not to be approached. Having no practice and no attainment—this is called right conduct, the conduct of the Perfected One, for nothing is attained.\n\nIt is like a bright mirror reflecting all forms,\nClear and luminous, without obstruction,\nYet the mirror itself never says, ‘I can illuminate.’\nThe wondrous forest of pure wisdom, the assembly in the jeweled city—\nAll the perfected ones of the dust-mote realms,\nTheir mind-mirrors luminous and pure, for nothing is attained,\nReflect all dharmas clearly and luminously, without hindrance.\nYet the perfected ones never say, ‘I can illuminate,’\nJust like that mirror, no different.\n\nAgain, it is like clear water reflecting a hundred thousand moons,\nFor their natures are equally luminous.\nThe Perfected One’s perception is likewise:\nContemplating all things in the world,\nNothing is not pure,\nFor their natures are equally empty.”\n\nThe Youth further asked: “Venerable Perfected One, if all in the world is empty, does the Heavenly Worthy’s appearance in the world bring no benefit?”\n\nThe Perfected One replied: “Youth of Right Vision, how can there be benefit in the absence of dharmas? Do you now perceive the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions as having the mark of arising?”\n\nThe Youth replied: “Venerable Perfected One, what I now perceive has no mark of arising. Knowing all dharmas are empty, originally pure—thus the Heavenly Worthy appears in the world without the mark of arising.”\n\nThe Perfected One continued: “Youth of Right Vision, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions appear in the world to sever the delusions of all beings, proclaiming this wondrous sutra, the profound Dharma, enabling all beings to attain pure wisdom, clearly understand the nature of dharmas, without obstruction, knowing all dharmas are empty, fundamentally without delusion. Once delusion is empty, the mind’s nature is pure. Thus, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions have no mark of appearing or disappearing. For this reason, the Heavenly Worthies’ appearance in the world brings great benefit, and all beings attain right vision, abiding in peace and bliss.\n\nIt is like dreaming at night of venomous snakes,\nTheir fangs bared, approaching to devour,\nThe mind terrified, fleeing in panic,\nCrying out to the heavens, stumbling in confusion,\nAwakened by someone beside the bed: ‘Why do you cry out in your sleep?’\nSuddenly the dreamer awakens,\nStretching limbs, knowing the dream’s visions were false,\nThe mind composed, abiding in peace and bliss.\n\nAll beings dwell in the vast chamber of ignorance within the three realms,\nAll their actions like dreams, without reality.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, the great sage, proclaims this Mahāyāna wondrous sutra,\nAwakening all to attain right vision,\nPossessing all wisdom, pure wisdom perfected,\nAll abiding in peace and bliss.”",

      "translated_text": "Having attained peace and bliss, one does not generate attachment;\nWithout attachment, one gains determination, never again entering the flow;\nNever entering the flow, there is no union;\nWithout union, there is no ignorance;\nWithout ignorance, there are no formations;\nWithout formations, there is eternal extinction,\nNo arising of any marks, ultimately pure,\nWithout speech, without discourse.\nIf there is speech, it is illusory;\nYet illusory speech is itself reality.\nWhy is this so?\nIllusory speech is but script—\nThe nature of script is empty, and emptiness is reality.\nFor this reason, the Heavenly Worthy’s illusory words are all reality.\n\nAt that time, the attendant youth named Dharma Appearance stepped forward, bowed his head, and addressed the Perfected One: “Virtuous One, why do you say that when true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, they are called true persons? When contemplating the nature of dharmas, is the nature of that nature existent or non-existent? If the nature of dharmas exists, it must be eternally constant; if it is non-existent, it must be definitively empty. How can a nature that is eternally constant be called empty? How can a nature that is definitively empty be called illusory? If the nature is definitively empty yet called illusory, then such speech is itself illusory. It is like space—empty and without illusion—yet to call it illusory is to speak falsely, for space itself has no illusion. If the nature is definitively existent, how can you say that when true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, they are called true persons, and that in contemplating the nature of dharmas, they gain a determined mind? To speak of a definitively existent nature as empty is to speak of emptiness, not of the emptiness of dharma-nature. If dharma-nature is not empty yet spoken of as empty, such speech is also illusory. To speak of dharma-nature as empty when its nature is not empty—how can one contemplate dharmas and attain determination? These two interpretations remain unresolved. I humbly request your elucidation, that all present may resolve their doubts.”\n\nThe Perfected One of Compassionate Salvation addressed the youth: “Dharma Appearance, excellent is this question! Now, when I speak of contemplating the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, why do you ask whether the nature of that nature is existent or non-existent? If the nature is definitively existent, then all dharmas possessing it cannot be called empty; if the nature is definitively empty, then the emptiness of that nature cannot be called existent. To perceive the nature as existent is eternalism; to perceive it as empty is annihilationism. These two views are false views. The thirty-six views are not the true and correct vision. What I perceive is the true nature of dharma-nature—neither existent nor non-existent, neither eternal nor annihilated, neither arising nor ceasing, neither white nor black, neither blue nor yellow, neither long nor short, neither high nor low, neither one nor different, neither great nor small, neither cold nor hot, neither prior nor posterior, neither cause nor effect. For this reason, I say that true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, for it is without possession. Though I say it is not existent, it is not definitively empty; though I say it is not empty, it is not eternally existent. Because it is not definitively existent, dharma-nature is not eternal; because it is not definitively empty, dharma-nature is not annihilated. Dharma-nature is not annihilated, unlike a rabbit’s horn; dharma-nature is not eternal, unlike illusory falsity. For this reason, I say that true persons contemplate the nature of all dharmas as originally pure, for it is without possession. It is like the extinction of a lamp—unseekable, ultimately pure, and unattainable.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One: “Excellent, true adept! Swiftly you have expounded this profound and rare teaching, the foremost of realities.” The countless attendant youths all attained awakening.\n\nAt that time, a youth named Universal Illumination arose among the assembly and spoke in verse:\n\nExcellent is this wondrous seat of the forest,\nIts merit unfathomable.\nThe dust-motes of the ten directions,\nEncountering this rare light,\nWalk the empty path to the wondrous seat,\nPure and singular, the supreme truth.\nWith wisdom’s mind, they contemplate the wondrous dharma—\nThe nature of dharmas is naturally empty.\nThe conditioned dharmas of the world,\nAll are not real.\nThe wise observe their illusory nature,\nLike a magician seeing wooden puppets.\nSeeing illusion as ordinary sight,\nOrdinary people see it as truly different.\nThe great Dao of the ten directions,\nAll worlds and all beings—\nTogether they practice the foremost truth,\nYet the deluded call it otherwise.\nTrue vision comprehends all dharmas,\nClearly observing even the finest dust.\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s bodily marks—\nAll marks are originally unarisen.\nExpounding this wondrous sutra,\nAll beings realize emptiness.\nThus we know the three realms are empty,\nDreams and illusions are universally unreal.\nIgnorance forever extinguished,\nAll formations naturally dissolve.\nFrom this we know the illusory,\nNever was it not the Dao-ground.\nThe supreme and utterly true adept,\nWith pure wisdom rescues the submerged.\nSkillfully discerning the nature of dharmas,\nIts emptiness is neither existent nor non-existent.\nEternal and annihilated, originally pure—\nLike a lamp’s extinction, unseekable.\nThe Heavenly Worthy praises the rare,\nExcellent is this wondrous sutra!\nWe all awaken together,\nRejoicing in the supreme mind.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy, having heard the youth’s verse, praised him: “Excellent, Universal Illumination! Through long cultivation of pure wisdom, today you have entered the jeweled city together with all, hearing my Mahāyāna teaching and attaining awakening, comprehending the nature of dharmas, clearly understanding the world. The nature is without possession—just as you have said. Today I am joyful and at peace, free from all worry. You and all present, in future ages, proclaim my Mahāyāna wondrous sutra, that all future beings of aspiration may attain awakening, together gaining pure wisdom, free from doubt and obstruction, clearly and decisively pure, abiding in peace and bliss.”\n\nAt that time, the immeasurable assembly of attendants, all the immortals and perfected ones, and the mighty spirit-kings rose together, bowed in reverence, received the command, and withdrew.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Praise**\n\nThen, in the Jade Capital Mountain, the Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Lofty Perfection rose from his seat. Having heard the Dharma spoken by the Perfected Ones, he rejoiced with exultation and scattered immeasurable, wondrous celestial flowers upon the seat. With incense of a hundred blended treasures, he perfumed the minds of the assembly. The inconceivable city and all who had come rejoiced greatly.",

      "translated_text": "Then the Heavenly King addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “By what cause and condition have we, this great assembly, encountered this rare and wondrous scripture? Having heard the Dharma spoken by the Perfected Ones—profound and abstruse, a teaching never before known—I have reflected thus: If good men and women, all sentient beings, should hear even a single chapter or verse of this Great Vehicle’s wondrous scripture, and with wholehearted faith receive, uphold, and practice it, reciting, praising, expounding, transcribing, and copying it, such a person is a true disciple of the Great Dao. Their power and might can shatter all the enmities of birth-and-death’s demonic forces. Why is this so? The true nature spoken by the Perfected Ones is the true Dao, the correct essence, pure and equal, without any differing marks—it is called the complete destruction of all sentient beings’ boundless perverse views. If there is one who, upon hearing this teaching, gives rise to no doubt, generates resolute conviction, receives, upholds, and makes offerings to it, and expounds even a single chapter or verse to others, know that this person has planted wholesome causes for measureless kalpas, and thus in this present life clearly perceives the nature of the Dharma. Hearing this Great Vehicle’s wondrous scripture, they do not generate fear or dread. If one who hears this Great Vehicle scripture should in future lives fall into the three evil destinies, such a thing cannot occur. Having heard this scripture and rejoiced upon first encounter, their merit and virtue are boundless. Know that this person’s every step and action is the cause and condition of the Three Clarities’ eternal bliss. Wherever this scripture abides, it is protected by the immeasurable great spirits of all the heavens. If there are those who expound and recite this Great Vehicle scripture, and wherever they may be, those who come with wholehearted devotion to the Dharma seat to listen with joy—know that such persons have entered the Dharma Wheel, the inconceivable city. Wherever this scripture is present—whether in cities, villages, mountains, forests, open fields, temples, or altars—wherever it travels, all demonic outsiders and evil persons cannot inflict harm. We, this assembly today, having beheld the Heavenly Venerable radiating wondrous light and heard this essential teaching, rejoice without measure. We vow to uphold and protect this scripture, sparing neither body nor life. It is like a blind man with but one remaining eye, guarding that eye, fearing any injury. We now guard and uphold this Great Vehicle scripture in the same way, fearing any harm, daring not treat it with negligence.”\n\nThen the Heavenly King spoke these verses:\n\nWe, this immeasurable assembly,\nhave together entered the jeweled city.\nEncountering the light, we saw the rare,\nthe wondrous Great Vehicle scripture.\nIf there are those with faith,\nwho receive and uphold its chapters and verses,\nthis person’s merit and power\nwill subdue and vanquish all demons.\nWherever this scripture travels,\nno demon dares to invade.\nThose who hear the scripture and come to listen\nwill have lotus flowers bloom beneath their feet.\nWe, having heard this essential teaching,\nvow to uphold it, daring not transgress,\nas one guards a single eye,\ncherishing it, lest it be harmed.\nWe now protect the Venerable Dharma,\ntreasuring it even more than this.\nMay this Great Vehicle Dharma\nuniversally ferry the beings of the ten heavens.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable praised the Heavenly King, saying: “Excellent, excellent! You and this assembly are true upholders of the Great Vehicle, protecting and ferrying all beings. You are my true disciples, aiding me in propagating and circulating this teaching in the degenerate age, enabling all to attain awakening. You, seated here today, have mounted this wondrous cause, and in future kalpas shall surely attain the true Great Dao.”\n\nThen the Heavenly King and all the great assembly, having heard these words, felt their minds at peace, rejoicing without measure. Together they exclaimed in approval, bowed in reverence, and withdrew.\n\n*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Grove of the Great Vehicle.*",
