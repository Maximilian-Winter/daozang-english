  "full_translation": "**Title:** *Illustrated Manual of the Dragon-Tiger Palm (Lónghǔ Shǒu Jiàn Tú)*\n\n**Scripture Name:** *Illustrated Manual of the Dragon-Tiger Palm*\nOne scroll.\nAttribution unknown; likely from the Five Dynasties or Northern Song.\nSource: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngzhēn* (Cavern-True) section, *Língtú* (Numinous Diagrams) category.\n\n---\n\n**The Illustrated Manual of the Dragon-Tiger Palm**\nCombining *Shēntóng Qì* (Paramount Concordance) with *Yì* (Changes) symbolism, it establishes the supreme Dao/Way’s method. Within the *Yì*, the forms of Heaven and Earth are fully arrayed, exhausting the essence of transformation.\n\nObserve the genesis of formed things—it arises from the interplay of one *yīn* and one *yáng* in mutual response.\nThe *Tàiyáng* (Great Yang) is the father of all things; the *Tàiyīn* (Great Yin) is the mother of all things. If the *huándān* (elixir) does not conform to the Heavenly Dao/Way, it will lack any rational foundation.\n\nFire is *shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang), and *yáng* is the child of *Tàiyīn*. The child follows the father’s course; thus, the numinous vessel nurtures in secret within the medicine, hence its precedence.\n\nXu (Xu Xun) and Wei (Wei Boyang) used the *Yì* symbolic sequences as omens, as detailed in the *Qì*’s (Concordance) chapter on *Jīnshì Dàozhāng* (Golden Pivotal Scriptures), along with the *Tàiyī Yùjué* (Great Unity Jade Precepts) as follows.\n\n**The Jade Precepts (Yùjué):**\nOne stone: *Dānshā* (cinnabar) and *gǒngyín* (mercury) and *qiān* (lead) form one *shuǐ* (water), completing the *huándān* (elixir) Dao/Way.\n\n*Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Earth) are the gateways of the *Yì*, the parents of all hexagrams.\n*Qián* is Heaven, the father; *Kūn* is Earth, the mother. All things are born from *Qián* and *Kūn*, hence they are called gateways.\n\nThe two *yáo* (trigrams) of *yīn* and *yáng* exhaust the transformations, becoming the parents of the hexagrams.\n\n*Kǎn* (Abyss) and *Lí* (Fire) as enclosing boundaries: *Kǎn* is in the north; *Lí* resides in the south. *Yáng* is born from *Kǎn*; *yīn* is born from *Lí*—thus they are called enclosing boundaries.\n\nThe revolving hub and central axis: movement resolves the *Kǎn* and *Lí* hexagrams. The *Lí* hexagram is hollow within—its void is the hub; the *Kǎn* hexagram is solid within—its solidity is the axis.\n\nWithin the hollow hub, Heaven’s wheel turns, the Dipper shifts, and the wheel revolves endlessly. One *yīn* arises in the fifth month when *yáng* is at its peak; one *yáng* arises in the eleventh month within the Great *yīn*. Thus, it cycles endlessly, the hub mirroring the axis.\n\nWhen the cycles of domination are fixed and the solar hours align without deviation, then the Heavenly Dao/Way’s movements of *yīn* and *yáng* can be grasped in the palm.\n\nThe four hexagrams are the lofty keys, covering and encompassing the Dao/Way of *yīn* and *yáng*.\nThe four hexagrams—*Qián*, *Kūn*, *Kǎn*, *Lí*—were earlier explained: the two upper trigrams are *yáng*, hollow and flexing, drumming and giving rise; the lower two are *yīn*, governed by the timing of *yáng*’s stillness to effect transformation.\n\nCovering and encompassing: they encompass all between Heaven and Earth without omission.\n\nThe dragon’s reins and the tiger’s tracks—following them, the Dao/Way proceeds with the *Tàiyáng*’s affairs, as if driving horses with reins, ensuring the tracks align without error.\n\nThe calendar marks months and nodes in five or six stages: within the *Kǎn* hexagram, *yáng* is external while *yīn* is internal. One *yáng* emerges within the盛 *yīn* (flourishing *yīn*), the *yáng* Dao gradually lengthening as the *yīn*’s darkness recedes. *Yáng*’s emergence is internal; *yīn*’s dissipation is external. Thus, over six days, the fire’s alchemical stages begin and conclude.\n\n**Dragon and Tiger:**\nThe circulating *jīn jīng* (metallic essence) nourishes the ten thousand spirits, naturally granting an immortal, ever-living body. Do not emulate the world’s greedy and lustful—endlessly toiling, they become but a clump of dust.\n\n**灵药**\nThe elixir—nameless yet potent—\nOne body’s spirit-*qi* most refined.\nIt does not rely on external things,\n*Yīn* returning to check itself—thus it is perfected.\n\n**还丹**\nHeaven and Earth as furnace, the elixir within the body,\nUnfathomable *yīn-yáng*—this is the divine.\nPrimordial *qi* ascends as frost, completing nine transformations,\nThe elixir’s essence is the *Tàihé*’s vital essence.\n\n**文武**\nSpring, summer, autumn, winter shift as one,\nDragon and Tiger blend with *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*’s interplay.\n*Qián* and *Kūn* exchange day and night in harmonious union,\nChild and Horse divide the twelve hours.\n\n**神运**\nRefining the elixir requires mastery of spiritual fire,\nDo not burn with worldly fuels of wood and charcoal.\nThe Three Flowers’ fierce flames reside within you—\nWasting yourself in ceaseless toil will only consume your days and months.\n\n**黄芽**\nThe Yellow Sprout follows the *zhōnglǜ* rhythm,\nHidden in Heaven and Earth, named *Zhēnyī*.\nOnly in the *Huáchí* Pool can Spring be commanded,\nAll things take root when flower and fruit begin.\n\n**白汞**\nOn the third day, *Gēng* is born—*Duì*’s gate opens,\nBlack gold decays, revealing the white silver embryo.\nNine and six in spring and summer, three and five,\nSeven and eight in autumn and winter—cycling endlessly.\n\n**金虎**\nFire concealed in wood—*Jiǎ*’s Green Dragon,\nGold hidden in water—*Gēng*’s White Tiger.\nHeaven and Earth’s transformations lie in these two,\nMeasuring *yīn-yáng* reveals their essence.\n\n**玄曜**\nThree-legged, round, one inch in measure,\n*Yīn-yáng* emerging like *Qián* and *Kūn*’s forms.\nNo need for gold or silver to forge the cauldron—\nAt the ninth position, the hidden Dragon transforms into the Gate.\n\n**真旨**\nThe Dao speaks of it as *having* for utility,\nYet also as *not having* for function.\nFormless form within the One *qi*,\nOnly return to the origin—root and seed.\n\n**流珠**\n*Tàihé* flows through the body, named *liúzhū*,\nPrimordial *yáng*—black, round—like a pearl.\nThree Fields above and below, *Qián* and *Kūn*’s domains,\nThe High Key stirs the wind, turning the door’s pivot.\n\n**住世**\nIf you seek longevity, black is the mother,\nFlowing through the Three *Yuán*’s pure storage chambers.\nWorldly metals and stones are all *yīn* in nature,\nDecaying flesh must be refined with *yáng* elixir to supplement.\n\n**成真**\nPrimordial black ascends, transforming the ten thousand spirits,\nThe child possesses it—do not ask your neighbor.\nBreathe in *Huáchí*’s flow, ascend to the upper realm,\nHeaven’s Dao opens—an immortal body.\n\n**出世**\nThe nine-transformed elixir refines the essence’s root,\nWrapped around the mud pill to fulfill its mandate.\nDivine beings transcend emptiness, rising above the Three Realms,\nShedding the body, dissolving like a cicada’s shell.\n\n**河车**\nThe *Kūn* symbol as a chariot, stationed in the North,\n*Kǎn* water as the River, the Black Tortoise’s domain.\nHeaven and Earth must be measured at the wheel’s pivot,\nThe Five Phases ascend and descend, cycling *yīn-yáng*.\n\nThe Dragon and Tiger meet in the mother’s womb,\nTwo *qi* harmonize—milky flowers bloom.\nFocus only on the first *yáng*’s rise,\nOnly then will you know its likeness to plum blossoms.\n\n**神水**\nDivine water has always been mercury,\nBound by *Mù*’s virtue, spring’s *yáng* unfurls.\nWhen it comes from the South, it rules the Fire Phase,\nSeekers find it—only then do they grasp the truth.\n\n**砂**\nSand is born from gold, mercury is lead,\nDivine beings forbid commoners to transmit this.\nThough I speak freely of elixir arts,\nI fear Heaven’s retribution for ancient transgressions.\n\n**龙虎手鉴图竟**",
