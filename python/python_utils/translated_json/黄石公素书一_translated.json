He expounded the five eternal principles of conduct and left behind teachings that endure forever.\n\nHis work encompasses:\n- The Dao and virtue in governing the realm,\n- Techniques for preserving life and body,\n- Strategies for achieving hegemony and rectifying the state.\n\nWhen Zhang Liang obtained these teachings, he unified the world;\nWhen Zhuge Liang practiced them, he dominated the Three Rivers.\n\nAh! The sage-king understands the natural order of rites and music, his wisdom divinely bestowed. There has never been one who succeeded without aligning with these principles of Dao, virtue, and righteousness.\n\nI, Ru, a humble recluse of the mountains and valleys, have presumptuously glimpsed the sacred mysteries. My words are crude and unrefined, my understanding shallow and failing to fathom the depths. Errors are inevitable—I await future scholars for correction.\n\n---\n\n**Huangshi Gong’s *Sūshū***\n\n**Chapter 1: The Five Principles as One (五者一体章)**\n\nThe Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are inseparable.\nOne who possesses the Dao must also have virtue.\nVirtue must embrace benevolence.\nWhen benevolence is cultivated, righteousness must be practiced.\nThus, a sovereign who embodies the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness must govern through propriety.\n\nHence, the five—Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—none may be omitted.\n\nThe **Dao** is the path all follow, ensuring all things attain their natural course.\nA sovereign does not oppose the people’s welfare, allowing them to fulfill their inherent nature through proper governance.\n\n**Virtue** is what is bestowed upon people, granting them what they desire.\nThe sovereign’s path lies in generosity, not stinginess, aligning with the natural order—silent yet trustworthy.\n\n**Benevolence** is what draws people near.\nA sovereign must cherish his people as his own children, so they revere him as a loving parent.\nThis benevolence manifests as:\n- *Cī* (慈): constant care lest any suffer neglect,\n- *Huì* (惠): generous bestowal of resources, nurturing talent with appropriate aid,\n- *Cèyǐn* (恻隐): compassion for the smallest afflictions, concern for others as for one’s own children.\n\n**Righteousness** is what is fitting.\nReward the virtuous, punish the wicked, and thus achieve success in undertakings.\nRighteousness means:\n- Not withholding merit due to personal bias,\n- Not sparing the guilty because of kinship.\nOnly then can one succeed in governance.\n\n**Propriety** is the path all tread.\nRising with the dawn and resting at dusk, maintaining the order of human relationships.\nAs the sovereign’s superior, he must diligently observe rites day and night, thus transforming society—establishing hierarchy, prohibiting unlawful acts—this is called *transmitting the teaching*.\n\nAs the *Shijing* says:\n*\"A man without propriety—why not die swiftly?\"*\n\nTo be human is to embody these five; none may be neglected.\n\nThus, the wise and virtuous understand the cycles of flourishing and decline, mastering the patterns of success and failure.\nTo discern flourishing and decline is to be wise:\n- Serve a virtuous sovereign and prosper;\n- Withdraw if the sovereign is without the Dao—this is wisdom in decline.\n\nTo grasp success and failure:\n- Assist a virtuous sovereign in his excellence;\n- Never align with a wicked one, lest you share his ruin—yet remain untainted.\nThus, even in a corrupt age, you preserve yourself—this is mastery.\n\nTo perceive the signs of order and chaos, to know when to approach or withdraw:\n- If the sovereign is virtuous, the realm is orderly—approach and succeed;\n- If the sovereign is without the Dao, the realm is in chaos—depart and avoid ruin.\nThis is the logic of *approach and withdrawal*.\n\nThus, the wise withdraw into obscurity, preserving the Dao, awaiting their moment.\n*\"Potent\"* means hidden.\nThe virtuous blend into the world, revealing their teachings only to an enlightened sovereign.\nHence, *\"awaiting their moment.\"*\n\nIf the time arrives and they act, they attain the highest rank as minister.\nWhen sovereign and minister align in the Dao, they achieve great deeds—all under heaven submit to virtue, and their reputation reaches its zenith.\nIf they act without the Dao, though they may gain power, it will not endure.\n\nTo act at the right moment is to achieve unparalleled success.\n*\"Machine\"* (机) means strategy.\nA man’s schemes are like a crossbow’s trigger—if aimed correctly, nothing is missed.\nActing at the opportune moment ensures success.\nThus, a crossbow must not be fired recklessly, nor strategies employed without cause.\nA reckless discharge is folly; a misapplied scheme leads to ruin.\nOnly when timing and strategy align does success come as if by divine will.\n\nIf they fail to meet their moment, they vanish from history.\n*\"Vanish\"* means hidden.\nIf sovereign and minister do not align, they cannot assist—thus, they retreat from the world.\nThey must not seek office recklessly; if they do not serve, no calamity befalls them.\nThus, those who walk this path attain high station and enduring fame—these are the sages.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: The Dao as Life (正道如生章)**\n\n**Virtue** is sufficient to attract the distant,\nNot fixating on trifles but pursuing the grand—this is virtue.\n\n**Faithfulness** unifies the disparate,\nHeaven acts without speech, yet the seasons proceed without deviation—cold and heat never stray by a hair’s breadth.\n\n**Chapter 2: The Dao as Life (正道如生章第二)**\n\nThus, the **gentleman** models himself after **Heaven**,\n**Faithfulness** cannot be abandoned—\nEstablish his laws and measures,\nConsistent from beginning to end.\n\n**Virtue** is sufficient to win the people,\nNot hoarding wealth for himself,\nNor enriching his own person—\nOnly then can he command their loyalty.\n\n**Talent** is sufficient to discern antiquity,\nBut *talent* does not mean literary skill—\nIt means **public virtue**—\nTo emulate the fine deeds of past rulers,\nAnd to examine their flaws with discernment—\nThis is to discern antiquity.\n\n**Clarity** is sufficient to illuminate the lower ranks,\nFor the **gentleman** stands above others,\nLike a mirror on a pedestal—\nNothing escapes its reflection.\nHe can weigh the merits and faults of men,\nThus, he is called a **clear sovereign**.\nThis is the **exemplary man**.\n\nTo practice these five virtues—\nHe attains the name of **exemplary talent**.\n\n**Conduct** is sufficient to serve as a model,\nFor all his actions conform to proper **rites and norms**—\nThe people take him as their standard,\nAnd he becomes their model.\n\n**Wisdom** is sufficient to resolve doubts and suspicions,\nAvoiding doubts and shunning suspicions—\nThis is to possess **wisdom**.\n\n**Faithfulness** can keep one’s word,\nAccepting the ruler’s command,\nEven if he must cross ten thousand *li* to distant lands—\nHis **faithfulness** remains unshaken.\n\n**Integrity** is sufficient to distribute wealth,\nNot enriching himself while impoverishing others.\nThis is the **heroic man**.\nTo practice these four virtues—\nHe attains the name of **heroic warrior**.\n\nTo fulfill his duties without neglect—\nNot to abandon his post while issuing orders—\nThis is called *not neglecting*.\n\nTo stand firm in righteousness—\nServing his lord with loyalty,\nSeeing danger and giving his life to rescue—\nHis **rectitude** never wavers—\nThis is called *not faltering*.\n\nTo gain profit without seizing it recklessly,\nTo face peril without fleeing it—\nThis is the **outstanding man**.\nWhat is not the **Dao’s** profit—\nHow can one seize it recklessly?\nWhat is righteousness’ peril—\nHow can one flee it?\n\nThis is called the **outstanding man**.\n\n**Chapter 3: Seeking the People’s Will (求人之志章)**\n\nTo curb desires and restrain appetites—\nThis is how one removes burdens.\nIf a ruler indulges in a single pleasure,\nThe people abandon their duties,\nAnd vie to curry favor with what he loves.\nExcessive desires ensnare the mind—\nThus, to not indulge, to not desire,\nNaturally frees one from such burdens.\n\nTo suppress evil and curb wrongdoing—\nThis is how one repels faults.\n*Suppression* means restraining judgment,\n*Curbing* means extinguishing wicked deeds—\nThus, one’s own faults are removed.\n\nTo reject wine and moderate passions—\nThis is how one avoids defilement.\nWine and lust bring no benefit,\nOnly harm—\nThey muddy the spirit, dimming clarity,\nAnd cloud the mind, so that governance is unwise.\nA turbid spirit is like a miscalculated **divination**,\nA darkened mind fails to judge affairs with precision.\n\nTo avoid suspicion and shun doubts—\nHow can one escape calamity?\nTo be well-learned and ask diligently—\nThis is how one broadens **wisdom**.\nThe teachings of past rulers\nAre recorded in the **classics**—\nTo study widely and peruse them,\nTo perfect one’s learning.\nTo ask diligently means\nThere are things yet unclear—\nTo question thoroughly,\nTo expand one’s **wisdom**.\n\nTo uphold lofty conduct and speak subtly—\nThis is how one cultivates the self.\n*Lofty conduct* means\nTo dwell below without descending too deeply,\nTo live among the masses without standing apart—\nThis is called *lofty conduct*.\n*Subtle speech* means\nTo practice the words of past rulers,\nTheir **instructions** handed down to posterity,\nTo transform others—\nThis is called *subtle speech*.\nTo focus and act upon them,\nThis is called *cultivating the self*.\n\nTo be reverent, frugal, humble, and moderate—\nThis is how one protects himself.\nTo be reverent toward all things,\nOthers will respect him;\nTo be frugal, moderate, and gentle,\nHe ensures lasting safety.\n\nTo plan deeply and think far ahead—\nThis is how one avoids ruin.\nPlans that lack depth bring defeat,\nThoughts that do not extend bring sorrow.\nThus, the **gentleman** plans and thinks with depth and foresight,\nAnd avoids the extremes of poverty and peril.\n\nTo associate with the virtuous and befriend the upright—\nThis is how one supports the fallen.\nTo take the virtuous as kin,\nTo bind the upright as friends—\nThus, one’s person is never harmed by misfortune.\n\nTo approach others with **benevolence** and earnest action—\nThis is how one connects with them.\nTo overlook others’ faults,\nTo conceal one’s own strengths,\nTo not be arrogant toward all things,\nAnd to act with reverence—\nThus, none remain beyond his reach.\n\nTo employ capable men and utilize their talents—\nThis is how one accomplishes tasks.\nA skilled artisan wastes no material,\nA capable general discards no soldier.\nTo measure their talents and use them accordingly—\nThus, their duties are fulfilled.\n\nTo sever evil and reject slander—\nThis is how one stops chaos.\nTo close the door to slanderous speech,\nTo block the path of deceit—\nTo walk the **Dao’s** straight path,\nNaturally, there is no calamity or disorder.\n\nTo trace origins and reflect on antiquity—\nThis is how one avoids confusion.\nThe **gentleman** examines both ends and beginnings,\nNot hasty in seeking advancement beyond his predecessors—\nHe always establishes merit and attains great renown,\nThus, he avoids confusion.\n\nTo deliberate first and then act—\nThis is how one responds to crises.\nMilitary strategy demands caution,\nThus, the **art of war** says:\nIts essence lies in **preemptive planning**,\nSo that preparation is never lacking.\nWithout preemptive deliberation,\nHow can one respond to crises?\n\nTo adapt to changes and employ expedients—\nThis is how one resolves deadlocks.\nThe **gentleman’s** nature is like water,\nWhich conforms to its container—\nNot rigid, but flexible—\nHe must adapt and flow,\nThus, he can untie what is knotted.\n\nTo gather wealth without burdening the **Dao**—\nThis is how one avoids blame.\nNot to amass wealth that violates the **Dao**\nYet still to benefit the people—\nThus, there is no disaster or harm.\n\nTo be earnest and upright—\nThis is how one establishes merit.\nTo be diligent and industrious—\nThis is how one safeguards his end.\nTo never falter or be complacent,\nFrom beginning to end, consistent—\nThis is how one long preserves his noble station.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Dao of Virtue and Sovereignty (德宗章)**\n\nThe art of cultivating a steadfast mind and righteous conduct—\nNothing surpasses **strategic deliberation**,\nThe petty man relies on strength to contend,\nThe **gentleman** triumphs through **scheming**—\nThus, the worthy general conquers without battle.\nTherefore, exerting force is not as effective as **strategic success**.\n\nNo peace surpasses **restraining desire**,\nTo restrain what one desires\nSo that the mind and spirit remain unperturbed—\nWhen the mind and spirit are unperturbed,\nThe four limbs are at ease.\n\nNo priority surpasses **cultivating virtue**,\nTo **cultivate virtue** is the foremost of all actions—\nThus, **Heaven** favors none,\nOnly **virtue** does it assist.\n\nNo joy surpasses **loving goodness**,\nTo exalt and follow the **orthodox teachings**,\nTo revere and honor the **divine**—\nThis is **goodness**.\n\nNo divinity surpasses **utter sincerity**,\n**Utter sincerity** moves the **divine**—\nWhen **sincerity** arises from the heart,\nIt can even shift **Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd evoke the **spirits and gods**.\n\nNo purity surpasses **guarding against defilement**,\nTo be cautious and vigilant, free from taint—\nThis leads to **high purity**.\n\nNo fortune surpasses **knowing contentment**,\nTo follow **uprightness** and embody the **Dao**,\nNot to seek wealth and noble station through unrighteous means—\nThus, he always preserves **auspicious blessings**.\n\n「Suffering knows none greater than excessive desires—\nExcessive desires bring little gain,\nYet they weary the heart.\n\nSorrow knows none deeper than dissipated vitality—\nThe body is the dwelling of the spirit.\nWhen vitality is dissipated, the body withers,\nAnd the spirit has no home—\nThen the spirits of darkness invade.\nThough gold and jade fill the halls,\nThey cannot redeem the life,\nNor can loved ones prolong the days.\n\nIllness knows none worse than instability—\nThe noble person’s nature must have its measure,\nFor if it lacks constancy, that is disease.\n\nShort-lived fortune knows none fleeter than that gained by unrighteous means—\nIf not obtained by proper way,\nSuch fortune will not endure.\n\nDarkness knows none deeper than greed and meanness—\nDemanding favors for oneself,\nYet showing meanness to others—\nThis is the conduct of the petty,\nHence the name \"dark.\"\n\nLoneliness knows none greater than stubborn self-righteousness—\nA ruler who clings to his own views,\nAccusing others of wrong,\nWhile the wise and clear do not join in counsel,\nNor the enlightened lend their sight—\nIs he not alone?\n\nPeril knows none sharper than harboring doubt—\nIf doubt is held in mind,\nIt must not be indulged.\nTo indulge what is doubted\nIs to court death and calamity.\n\nDefeat knows none surer than excessive self-interest—\nThe public-minded have no fear,\nBut self-interest breeds ruin.\n\n**Chapter Five: On the Reverence for Righteousness**\nShallow understanding is when clarity is not concealed—\nIf wisdom is not hidden within,\nThe heart cannot reflect its light,\nAnd one may be called shallow.\n\nIgnorance of faults is self-delusion—\nThe noble person renews his virtue daily,\nYet fears he may have faults unrecognized.\nTo err and not return is confusion—\nThe sun and moon wax and wane in turn,\nAnd who among men is without fault?\nWhat harm if faults are confessed and corrected?\nYet to fear faults but not mend them\nIs to be lost in confusion.\n\nSlander through words brings ruin—\nHe who does not consider the consequences,\nWho wounds others with his speech,\nWill first invite their enmity,\nAnd in time, their vengeance.\nThus it is said: *\"The tongue is the gate to calamity.\"*\n\nCommands at odds with the heart bring ruin—\nIf decrees run contrary to the heart,\nThe people will not show respect.\n\nOrders that contradict prior laws invite destruction—\nIf laws are enacted without harmony,\nThen slander and defamation arise.\n\nAnger without authority invites transgression—\nThe noble person must not be light in his words,\nFor without awe, the petty will dare to offend.\n\nLoving to humiliate others invites disaster—\nTo degrade others before all,\nTo be despised by the multitude—\nAccumulated grudges fester within,\nAnd in time, bring ruin.\n\nTo entrust one’s rule to the humiliated is peril—\nNever to bear those who have been wronged unjustly,\nFor to do so is to invite danger.\nHe who gains power through such means\nIs ever near the brink.\n\nTo scorn those worthy of respect invites misfortune—\nIf one disdains those who should be honored,\nCalamity will surely follow.\n\nHypocrisy—when form and heart are divided—\nLeads to isolation,\nFor those whose outward appearance betrays their inner purpose\nWill find their affairs often misaligned.\nWhen few are their allies,\nThen loneliness is their fate.\n\nTo favor flatterers while distancing the loyal brings downfall—\nTo reject the words of the virtuous,\nYet heed the whispers of the deceitful—\nWhen loyal ministers flee the court,\nAnd sycophants hold sway,\nThis is the root of ruin.\n\nTo indulge in color while neglecting the wise brings folly—\nTo love beauty but not the virtuous,\nThis is the mark of a confused ruler.\n\nTo appoint unworthy men to office brings emptiness—\nWhen one lacks the talent and virtue for office,\nYet clings to its rewards,\nLike driftwood upon the waves,\nSuch rule is fleeting and vain.\n\nWhen women meddle in public affairs, disorder follows—\nWhen relatives and kin exploit public office\nFor private gain,\nThis is the seed of chaos.\n\nWhen subjects harbor foreign thoughts, they perish—\nIf the heart turns outward,\nThen loyalty wanes.\nTo lean on feeble virtue alone\nIs the sign of impending fall.\n\nWhen ruler and subjects are at odds, they scatter—\nWhen harmony between lord and ministers is lost,\nAnd discord takes root,\nThen separation and ruin are near.\n\nWhen ruler and subjects neglect each other, no great deeds are done—\nWhen lord and ministers support one another,\nTheir achievements rival Heaven and Earth.\nBut if their judgments differ,\nWhat great work can be accomplished?\n\nWhen ruler and subjects betray each other, they topple—\nTo seize power by force,\nTo trade office for wealth—\nThen both ruler and ministers face ruin.\n\nTo oppress the weak and claim victory as virtue is to invite encroachment—\nTo rely on one’s own strength,\nTo bully the lowly and claim triumph—\nThis is called aggression,\nAnd is not the way of the virtuous.\n\nTo boast of empty fame while lacking true merit is to erode one’s standing—\nTo parade false glory,\nYet perform no deeds—\nThen one’s reputation fades,\nAnd one’s path is worn away.\n\nTo belittle others while showcasing one’s own strengths is to invite disorder—\nTo display one’s own talents,\nYet criticize others’ failings,\nAnd boast in one’s own abilities—\nThis will surely bring downfall.\n\nTo enrich oneself while impoverishing others invites abandonment—\nIf one hoards wealth while neglecting others,\nThen hearts will not be united,\nAnd rebellion will follow.\n\nTo obscure great merit with petty faults is to diminish one’s worth—\nIf one hides great achievements behind small mistakes,\nThen progress will be stifled,\nAnd ambition will wane daily.\nThus it is said: *\"The petty fault obscures the grand.\"*\n\nTo reward without merit breeds resentment—\nIf the undeserving are rewarded,\nAnd the worthy grow bitter—\nThen the heart is stifled.\n\nTo punish the innocent is cruelty—\nIf the guiltless are punished,\nThen the good suffer violence.\nTo hear flattery as sweetest fare,\nYet treat honest counsel as an enemy—\nWhat ruler so distant from the Dao\nWill not meet ruin?\n\nHe who holds what he ought is secure—\nTo covet what others possess is to court destruction.\nHe who holds what is his own\nIs full yet does not overflow,\nAnd thus remains at peace.\n\nThe ruler without the Dao who demands others’ possessions\nCan only meet ruin or harm.\n\n**Chapter Six: On the Stability of Rituals**\nResentment arises from not pardoning small faults—」\n\n「Picking out minor faults and harboring resentment—\nthis is a rare virtue indeed.\n\nDisaster lies in failing to plan ahead.\nIf one does not plan ahead,\nwhen calamity strikes, what is there to regret?\n\nFortune comes from accumulating good deeds—\nHouseholds that accumulate virtue\nwill surely have lasting blessings.\n\nMisfortune arises from amassing evil.\nHouseholds that accumulate unvirtuous deeds\nwill inevitably face lingering calamities.\n\nHunger stems from neglecting the farmers,\ncold from abandoning the weavers.\nIf one follows the Dao of Heaven\nand shares the benefits of the Earth,\nwhy would there be hunger or cold?\n\nStability comes from gaining worthy people—\nIf one secures the right people,\nthey will uphold governance with loyalty,\nand thus the virtuous ruler remains at peace.\n\nPeril lies in losing the scholars.\nScholars have the power to assist the ruler,\nupholding him with sincerity.\nIf they are instead rejected by their lord,\nthen the wise will withdraw,\nand the state will face ruin and decline.\n\nWealth comes from welcoming guests,\npoverty from tardiness.\nThe wise plan in advance,\nthe foolish act only after the fact.\nWhen rulers lack steadfast principles,\nthe people grow full of doubt.\n\nThe noble one remains firm in proper conduct,\nneither yielding nor advancing without measure—\nthis is the mark of possessing **德** (*virtue/power*).\nIf the heart is restless and not steady,\nif joy and anger are unchecked,\nthen no one can fathom it,\nand thus suspicion and doubt flourish.\n\nContempting the ruler invites punishment,\ninsulting the subjects invites estrangement.\nDisdaining the ruler brings disaster,\ninsulting the subjects makes them distant.\nWhen ruler and subjects grow distant,\nthen there is no bond of loyalty.\n\nNearly unvalued, the distant are slighted.\nTo know one’s ruler,\nfirst observe his ministers.\nGood ministers in court\nwill reflect virtue back to their lord.\nA state without good ministers\nis like a cart without its axle—\nunstable and bound to collapse.\n\nHe who doubts himself cannot trust others,\nhe who trusts himself doubts no one.\nRulers often doubt themselves,\nand thus fail to heed loyal and upright counsel.\nIf one sincerely trusts himself,\nthen others will naturally respond with sincerity—\nwhy then the need for doubt?\n\nThe crooked man has no straight friends—\n*\"Crooked\"* here means perverse.\nHe who favors perversity\nmust inevitably loathe the straight,\nand thus it is said he has no straight friends.\n\nA crooked ruler will have no straight subjects.\nThere has never been a case where form is upright\nyet shadow is crooked.\nIf the ruler is not upright,\neven the subjects must bend and twist.\n\nA perilous state lacks virtuous ministers.\nFor a state to fall into disaster,\nis like a body suffering from illness.\nOne who excels in nurturing health\nwill not allow it to worsen,\nand one who excels in governing\nwill not let the state topple.\nUsing loyal and trustworthy words,\nits ruin may yet be averted;\nfollowing ill-advised schemes,\nthe state will surely perish.\nWhen a state is already in peril,\nwhat can the virtuous do to save it?\nThus it is said: *it lacks virtuous ministers.*\n\nChaos in governance comes from lacking good people.\nThe ruler shapes the people through **风化** (*cultural refinement*),\nand thus the petty will follow suit.\n\nThe deeper one’s love for the people,\nthe more urgent the search for worthy ministers.\nIn ancient times, the Duke of Zhou (*Zhōu Gōng*)\nwished to establish a great and lasting realm,\nand thus sought out the world’s virtuous ones.\nHe would interrupt his meals to welcome guests,\nand grasp his hair in eagerness to serve those in need.\nThough in high station, he pursued the world’s scholars,\nhelping them achieve great deeds,\nand his reputation endured for ten thousand generations.\nHe is called a **圣人** (*sage*).\n\nThe joy of securing worthy ministers\nlies in generous provision.\nTo catch fish, one must use fragrant bait;\nto retain scholars, one must offer rich rewards.\nUsing fragrant bait to catch fish,\nthe fish may soon be depleted.\nOffering rich rewards to retain scholars,\nthey will all come—\nand thus the world’s worthy ones gather and return.\nWorthy scholars, summoned yet not returning,\nare a sign of a state’s decline.\nIf the ruler grows benighted,\nthen the virtuous will leave the state.\n\nWelcoming them yet they do not return—\nthis is the sign of a state’s ruin.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish,\nthe virtuous scholars depart first.\nZhengzi left the State of Shang,\nConfucius left the State of Lu.\nWhere the land is thin,\ngreat things do not grow.\nWhere the waters are shallow,\ngreat fish do not swim.\nWhere the trees are bare,\ngreat birds do not nest.\nWhere the forest is sparse,\ngreat beasts do not dwell.\nAll these are metaphors:\na ruler’s virtue is not broad,\nand thus the wise find no place to rest.\n\nThe steep mountain will collapse—\na mountain without foundation,\ntoo sheer and lofty alone,\nis bound to fall.\nThis is a metaphor:\na ruler without ministers\nwill surely face political peril and ruin.\n\nThe full marsh will burst—\na marsh that does not extend\nto the breadth of rivers and seas\nwill easily overflow.\nThis is a metaphor:\na ruler of narrow capacity\nis like a marsh that overflows.\n\nHe who discards jade as if it were stone—\nis blind indeed.\nNot distinguishing jade from stone,\nnot discerning the wise from the foolish,\nis the mark of blindness.\nThe man with the **羊质虎皮** (*sheep’s nature, tiger’s appearance*) brings shame.\nNot measuring a man’s talents\nbefore employing him,\nhis virtue does not match his station.\nThis is like putting a tiger’s skin on a sheep—\ndoes it not bring disgrace to his dignity?\n\nThe garment that does not fit the collar—\nwill fall.\nIf one does not adjust the garment\nto fit the collar,\nit will surely fall.\nIf one employs people\nwithout measuring their talents,\ngovernance will be disordered.\n\nThe runner who does not watch the ground—\nwill tumble.\nThis is a metaphor:\nthe noble one’s virtue lies in careful deliberation.\nIf one does not examine and deliberate,\nthen one will surely fall into ruin.\n\nThe weak pillar invites the house’s collapse,\nthe feeble minister invites the state’s decline.\nA grand hall relies on its beams and pillars,\na wise ruler depends on his ministers.\nIf the ministers are not the right ones,\nit is like a house without beams—\nit will surely topple.\n\nCold feet harm the heart,\npeople’s resentment harms the state.\nThe state’s foundation is its people.\nA wise ruler can assuage the people’s grievances,\nconstantly observing their hearts,\nto follow what they desire.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou said:\n*\"When a state is about to fall, its people suffer first.\"*\n\nA mountain about to collapse\nfirst loses its base,\na state about to decline\nfirst sees its people hard-pressed.\nWhen roots wither and branches rot,\nthe people suffer and the state decays.\nA mountain’s foundation is its base,\na tree’s foundation is its root.\nIf one loses the foundation,\nall else cannot stand.\n\nHe who follows the same path as a overturned cart—\nwill topple,\nhe who acts in the same way as a ruined state—\nwill perish.\nWhen the previous cart has overturned,\nthe next should change its course.\nWhen a state has fallen,\nits laws should also be reformed.\nTo follow the same path again,\nis to invite one’s own ruin.\nObserving the past,\none should be cautious about the future—\nif one dislikes their traces,\nthen avoid them in advance.\nExamining the rise and fall of states,\none can see the sources of fortune and misfortune.\nThose who dislike their traces\nshould reform and avoid them,\nand thus will never be burdened.\n\nHe who fears peril is secure,\nhe who dreads ruin is preserved.\nThe noble one, though in safety,\nconsiders danger—\nand thus endures.\nIf one does not think or deliberate,\nif one indulges in desires without restraint,\nthen one invites ruin for oneself.\n\nAs for what people do,\nif they follow the Dao,\nthey will prosper;\nif they lack the Dao,\nthey will face misfortune.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou and King Wen\nsubdued the feudal lords through virtue,\nand thus the world returned to them.\nThey had armies yet did not fight,\nand still achieved victory.\nThey had cities yet did not fortify them,\nand yet faced no enemies.\nTheir descendants ruled for over eight hundred years—\nthey are called **吉君** (*auspicious rulers*).\n\nThe rulers Jie and Zhou\nindulged in their cruelty and violence,\nmaking pools of wine and forests of meat,\npiling treasures like hills.\nThey recruited warriors who could\npluck mountains or lift cauldrons,\nwho could walk on land as if it were water\nor sail on earth as if it were sea,\nwho could bend a bow or sever a rope with ease—\nthousands of such fierce men they gathered.\nYet they saw their ruin in an instant,\ntheir heads separated from their bodies,\ntheir descendants extinguished.\nThough they lacked the Dao,\nthey were briefly indulged—\nyet their shame was proclaimed for a hundred generations.\nIs this not pitiful indeed?»\n\nThe auspicious gather a hundred blessings,\nwhile the calamitous invite a hundred disasters.\nWhen a ruler practices virtue and benevolence,\nthe people rally to him, and fortune follows.\nWhen a ruler acts with cruelty and tyranny,\nthe people rise against him, and misfortune ensues.\nThis is not the work of divine or saintly intervention—\nit is the natural consequence of one’s deeds.\n\nMaster Huangshi humbly declared:\n*\"It is not my power to bring fortune or misfortune upon others,\nbut rather, I follow the actions of people and bring forth their own blessings or curses.\"*\n\nThose who strive to devise good strategies avoid evil deeds,\nand those who plan ahead escape near-term anxieties.\nA gentleman who does not seek good counsel\nis like wood that does not follow the plumb line—\nwithout foresight, how can he avoid sorrow?\n\nThe bold can be commanded to charge in battle,\nbut not to endure steadfastly.\nSteadfastness means firm resolve.\nThe resolute can be ordered to hold fast,\nbut not to overpower enemies.\nResoluteness is the depth of virtue and benevolence.\n\nThe greedy can be directed to seize and take,\nbut not to distribute wealth—\nfor once they demand riches,\nthey will surely risk their lives for them.\n\nThe frugal can be entrusted with defense,\nbut not with aggressive action—\nfor those who cling to purity and isolation\nstruggle to unite with others.\n\nThe trustworthy can be tasked with keeping promises,\nbut not with adapting to change—\nfor those bound by rigid loyalty\nlack the flexibility to respond.\n\nIf these five qualities are guided according to their strengths and tempered accordingly,\nthen all will flourish without fail.\n\n*Thus concludes the Yellow Stone Classic.*",

He expounded the five eternal principles of conduct and left behind teachings that endure forever.\n\nHis work encompasses:\n- The Dao and virtue in governing the realm,\n- Techniques for preserving life and body,\n- Strategies for achieving hegemony and rectifying the state.\n\nWhen Zhang Liang obtained these teachings, he unified the world;\nWhen Zhuge Liang practiced them, he dominated the Three Rivers.\n\nAh! The sage-king understands the natural order of rites and music, his wisdom divinely bestowed. There has never been one who succeeded without aligning with these principles of Dao, virtue, and righteousness.\n\nI, Ru, a humble recluse of the mountains and valleys, have presumptuously glimpsed the sacred mysteries. My words are crude and unrefined, my understanding shallow and failing to fathom the depths. Errors are inevitable—I await future scholars for correction.\n\n---\n\n**Huangshi Gong’s *Sūshū***\n\n**Chapter 1: The Five Principles as One (五者一体章)**\n\nThe Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are inseparable.\nOne who possesses the Dao must also have virtue.\nVirtue must embrace benevolence.\nWhen benevolence is cultivated, righteousness must be practiced.\nThus, a sovereign who embodies the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness must govern through propriety.\n\nHence, the five—Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—none may be omitted.\n\nThe **Dao** is the path all follow, ensuring all things attain their natural course.\nA sovereign does not oppose the people’s welfare, allowing them to fulfill their inherent nature through proper governance.\n\n**Virtue** is what is bestowed upon people, granting them what they desire.\nThe sovereign’s path lies in generosity, not stinginess, aligning with the natural order—silent yet trustworthy.\n\n**Benevolence** is what draws people near.\nA sovereign must cherish his people as his own children, so they revere him as a loving parent.\nThis benevolence manifests as:\n- *Cī* (慈): constant care lest any suffer neglect,\n- *Huì* (惠): generous bestowal of resources, nurturing talent with appropriate aid,\n- *Cèyǐn* (恻隐): compassion for the smallest afflictions, concern for others as for one’s own children.\n\n**Righteousness** is what is fitting.\nReward the virtuous, punish the wicked, and thus achieve success in undertakings.\nRighteousness means:\n- Not withholding merit due to personal bias,\n- Not sparing the guilty because of kinship.\nOnly then can one succeed in governance.\n\n**Propriety** is the path all tread.\nRising with the dawn and resting at dusk, maintaining the order of human relationships.\nAs the sovereign’s superior, he must diligently observe rites day and night, thus transforming society—establishing hierarchy, prohibiting unlawful acts—this is called *transmitting the teaching*.\n\nAs the *Shijing* says:\n*\"A man without propriety—why not die swiftly?\"*\n\nTo be human is to embody these five; none may be neglected.\n\nThus, the wise and virtuous understand the cycles of flourishing and decline, mastering the patterns of success and failure.\nTo discern flourishing and decline is to be wise:\n- Serve a virtuous sovereign and prosper;\n- Withdraw if the sovereign is without the Dao—this is wisdom in decline.\n\nTo grasp success and failure:\n- Assist a virtuous sovereign in his excellence;\n- Never align with a wicked one, lest you share his ruin—yet remain untainted.\nThus, even in a corrupt age, you preserve yourself—this is mastery.\n\nTo perceive the signs of order and chaos, to know when to approach or withdraw:\n- If the sovereign is virtuous, the realm is orderly—approach and succeed;\n- If the sovereign is without the Dao, the realm is in chaos—depart and avoid ruin.\nThis is the logic of *approach and withdrawal*.\n\nThus, the wise withdraw into obscurity, preserving the Dao, awaiting their moment.\n*\"Potent\"* means hidden.\nThe virtuous blend into the world, revealing their teachings only to an enlightened sovereign.\nHence, *\"awaiting their moment.\"*\n\nIf the time arrives and they act, they attain the highest rank as minister.\nWhen sovereign and minister align in the Dao, they achieve great deeds—all under heaven submit to virtue, and their reputation reaches its zenith.\nIf they act without the Dao, though they may gain power, it will not endure.\n\nTo act at the right moment is to achieve unparalleled success.\n*\"Machine\"* (机) means strategy.\nA man’s schemes are like a crossbow’s trigger—if aimed correctly, nothing is missed.\nActing at the opportune moment ensures success.\nThus, a crossbow must not be fired recklessly, nor strategies employed without cause.\nA reckless discharge is folly; a misapplied scheme leads to ruin.\nOnly when timing and strategy align does success come as if by divine will.\n\nIf they fail to meet their moment, they vanish from history.\n*\"Vanish\"* means hidden.\nIf sovereign and minister do not align, they cannot assist—thus, they retreat from the world.\nThey must not seek office recklessly; if they do not serve, no calamity befalls them.\nThus, those who walk this path attain high station and enduring fame—these are the sages.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: The Dao as Life (正道如生章)**\n\n**Virtue** is sufficient to attract the distant,\nNot fixating on trifles but pursuing the grand—this is virtue.\n\n**Faithfulness** unifies the disparate,\nHeaven acts without speech, yet the seasons proceed without deviation—cold and heat never stray by a hair’s breadth.",

restrain appetites—\nThis is how one removes burdens.\nIf a ruler indulges in a single pleasure,\nThe people abandon their duties,\nAnd vie to curry favor with what he loves.\nExcessive desires ensnare the mind—\nThus, to not indulge, to not desire,\nNaturally frees one from such burdens.\n\nTo suppress evil and curb wrongdoing—\nThis is how one repels faults.\n*Suppression* means

vitality—\nThe body is the dwelling of the spirit.\nWhen vitality is dissipated, the body withers,\nAnd the spirit has no home—\nThen the spirits of darkness invade.\nThough gold and jade fill the halls,\nThey cannot redeem the life,\nNor can loved ones prolong the days.\n\nIllness knows none worse than instability—\nThe noble person’s nature must have its measure,\nFor if it lacks constancy, that is disease.\n\nShort-lived fortune knows none fleeter than that gained by unrighteous means—\nIf not obtained by proper way,\nSuch fortune will not endure.\n\nDarkness knows none deeper than greed and meanness—\nDemanding favors for oneself,\nYet showing meanness to others—\nThis is the conduct of the petty,\nHence the name \"dark.\"\n\nLoneliness knows none greater than stubborn self-righteousness—\nA ruler who clings to his own views,\nAccusing others of wrong,\nWhile the wise and clear do not join in counsel,\nNor the enlightened lend their sight—\nIs he not alone?\n\nPeril knows none sharper than harboring doubt—\nIf doubt is held in mind,\nIt must not be indulged.\nTo indulge what is doubted\nIs to court death and calamity.\n\nDefeat knows none surer than excessive self-interest—\nThe public-minded have no fear,\nBut self-interest breeds ruin.\n\n**Chapter Five: On the Reverence for Righteousness**\nShallow understanding is when clarity is not concealed—\nIf wisdom is not hidden within,\nThe heart cannot reflect its light,\nAnd one may be called shallow.\n\nIgnorance of faults is self-delusion—\nThe noble person renews his virtue daily,\nYet fears he may have faults unrecognized.\nTo err and not return is confusion—\nThe sun and moon wax and wane in turn,\nAnd who among men is without fault?\nWhat harm if faults are confessed and corrected?\nYet to fear faults but not mend them\nIs to be lost in confusion.\n\nSlander through words brings ruin—\nHe who does not consider the consequences,\nWho wounds others with his speech,\nWill first invite their enmity,\nAnd in time, their vengeance.\nThus it is said: *\"The tongue is the gate to calamity.\"*\n\nCommands at odds with the heart bring ruin—\nIf decrees run contrary to the heart,\nThe people will not show respect.\n\nOrders that contradict prior laws invite destruction—\nIf laws are enacted without harmony,\nThen slander and defamation arise.\n\nAnger without authority invites transgression—\nThe noble person must not be light in his words,\nFor without awe, the petty will dare to offend.\n\nLoving to humiliate others invites disaster—\nTo degrade others before all,\nTo be despised by the multitude—\nAccumulated grudges fester within,\nAnd in time, bring ruin.\n\nTo entrust one’s rule to the humiliated is peril—\nNever to bear those who have been wronged unjustly,\nFor to do so is to invite danger.\nHe who gains power through such means\nIs ever near the brink.\n\nTo scorn those worthy of respect invites misfortune—\nIf one disdains those who should be honored,\nCalamity will surely follow.\n\nHypocrisy—when form and heart are divided—\nLeads to isolation,\nFor those whose outward appearance betrays their inner purpose\nWill find their affairs often misaligned.\nWhen few are their allies,\nThen loneliness is their fate.\n\nTo favor flatterers while distancing the loyal brings downfall—\nTo reject the words of the virtuous,\nYet heed the whispers of the deceitful—\nWhen loyal ministers flee the court,\nAnd sycophants hold sway,\nThis is the root of ruin.\n\nTo indulge in color while neglecting the wise brings folly—\nTo love beauty but not the virtuous,\nThis is the mark of a confused ruler.\n\nTo appoint unworthy men to office brings emptiness—\nWhen one lacks the talent and virtue for office,\nYet clings to its rewards,\nLike driftwood upon the waves,\nSuch rule is fleeting and vain.\n\nWhen women meddle in public affairs, disorder follows—\nWhen relatives and kin exploit public office\nFor private gain,\nThis is the seed of chaos.\n\nWhen subjects harbor foreign thoughts, they perish—\nIf the heart turns outward,\nThen loyalty wanes.\nTo lean on feeble virtue alone\nIs the sign of impending fall.\n\nWhen ruler and subjects are at odds, they scatter—\nWhen harmony between lord and ministers is lost,\nAnd discord takes root,\nThen separation and ruin are near.\n\nWhen ruler and subjects neglect each other, no great deeds are done—\nWhen lord and ministers support one another,\nTheir achievements rival Heaven and Earth.\nBut if their judgments differ,\nWhat great work can be accomplished?\n\nWhen ruler and subjects betray each other, they topple—\nTo seize power by force,\nTo trade office for wealth—\nThen both ruler and ministers face ruin.\n\nTo oppress the weak and claim victory as virtue is to invite encroachment—\nTo rely on one’s own strength,\nTo bully the lowly and claim triumph—\nThis is called aggression,\nAnd is not the way of the virtuous.\n\nTo boast of empty fame while lacking true merit is to erode one’s standing—\nTo parade false glory,\nYet perform no deeds—\nThen one’s reputation fades,\nAnd one’s path is worn away.\n\nTo belittle others while showcasing one’s own strengths is to invite disorder—\nTo display one’s own talents,\nYet criticize others’ failings,\nAnd boast in one’s own abilities—\nThis will surely bring downfall.\n\nTo enrich oneself while impoverishing others invites abandonment—\nIf one hoards wealth while neglecting others,\nThen hearts will not be united,\nAnd rebellion will follow.\n\nTo obscure great merit with petty faults is to

evil.\nHouseholds that accumulate unvirtuous deeds\nwill inevitably face lingering calamities.\n\nHunger stems from neglecting the farmers,\ncold from abandoning the weavers.\nIf one follows the Dao of Heaven\nand shares the benefits of the Earth,\nwhy would there be hunger or cold?\n\nStability comes from gaining worthy people—\nIf one secures the right people,\nthey will uphold governance with loyalty,\nand thus the virtuous ruler remains at peace.\n\nPeril lies in losing the scholars.\nScholars have the power to assist the ruler,\nupholding him with sincerity.\nIf they are instead rejected by their lord,\nthen the wise will withdraw,\nand the state will face ruin and decline.\n\nWealth comes from welcoming guests,\npoverty from tardiness.\nThe wise plan in advance,\nthe foolish act only after the fact.\nWhen rulers lack steadfast principles,\nthe people grow full of doubt.\n\nThe noble one remains firm in proper conduct,\nneither yielding nor advancing without measure—\nthis is the mark of possessing **德** (*virtue/power*).\nIf the heart is restless and not steady,\nif joy and anger are unchecked,\nthen no one can fathom it,\nand thus suspicion and doubt flourish.\n\nContempting the ruler invites punishment,\ninsulting the subjects invites estrangement.\nDisdaining the ruler brings disaster,\ninsulting the subjects makes them distant.\nWhen ruler and subjects grow distant,\nthen there is no bond of loyalty.\n\nNearly unvalued, the distant are slighted.\nTo know one’s ruler,\nfirst observe his ministers.\nGood ministers in court\nwill reflect virtue back to their lord.\nA state without good ministers\nis like a cart without its axle—\nunstable and bound to collapse.\n\nHe who doubts himself cannot trust others,\nhe who trusts himself doubts no one.\nRulers often doubt themselves,\nand thus fail to heed loyal and upright counsel.\nIf one sincerely trusts himself,\nthen others will naturally respond with sincerity—\nwhy then the need for doubt?\n\nThe crooked man has no straight friends—\n*\"Crooked\"* here means perverse.\nHe who favors perversity\nmust inevitably loathe the straight,\nand thus it is said he has no straight friends.\n\nA crooked ruler will have no straight subjects.\nThere has never been a case where form is upright\nyet shadow is crooked.\nIf the ruler is not upright,\neven the subjects must bend and twist.\n\nA perilous state lacks virtuous ministers.\nFor a state to fall into disaster,\nis like a body suffering from illness.\nOne who excels in nurturing health\nwill not allow it to worsen,\nand one who excels in governing\nwill not let the state topple.\nUsing loyal and trustworthy words,\nits ruin may yet be averted;\nfollowing ill-advised schemes,\nthe state will surely perish.\nWhen a state is already in peril,\nwhat can the virtuous do to save it?\nThus it is said: *it lacks virtuous ministers.*\n\nChaos in governance comes from lacking good people.\nThe ruler shapes the people through **风化** (*cultural refinement*),\nand thus the petty will follow suit.\n\nThe deeper one’s love for the people,\nthe more urgent the search for worthy ministers.\nIn ancient times, the Duke of Zhou (*Zhōu Gōng*)\nwished to establish a great and lasting realm,\nand thus sought out the world’s virtuous ones.\nHe would interrupt his meals to welcome guests,\nand grasp his hair in eagerness to serve those in need.\nThough in high station, he pursued the world’s scholars,\nhelping them achieve great deeds,\nand his reputation endured for ten thousand generations.\nHe is called a **圣人** (*sage*).\n\nThe joy of securing worthy ministers\nlies in generous provision.\nTo catch fish, one must use fragrant bait;\nto retain scholars, one must offer rich rewards.\nUsing fragrant bait to catch fish,\nthe fish may soon be depleted.\nOffering rich rewards to retain scholars,\nthey will all come—\nand thus the world’s worthy ones gather and return.\nWorthy scholars, summoned yet not returning,\nare a sign of a state’s decline.\nIf the ruler grows benighted,\nthen the virtuous will leave the state.\n\nWelcoming them yet they do not return—\nthis is the sign of a state’s ruin.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish,\nthe virtuous scholars depart first.\nZhengzi left the State of Shang,\nConfucius left the State of Lu.\nWhere the land is thin,\ngreat things do not grow.\nWhere the waters are shallow,\ngreat fish do not swim.\nWhere the trees are bare,\ngreat birds do not nest.\nWhere the forest is sparse,\ngreat beasts do not dwell.\nAll these are metaphors:\na ruler’s virtue is not broad,\nand thus the wise find no place to rest.\n\nThe steep mountain will collapse—\na mountain without foundation,\ntoo sheer and lofty alone,\nis bound to fall.\nThis is a metaphor:\na ruler without ministers\nwill surely face political peril and ruin.\n\nThe full marsh will burst—\na marsh that does not extend\nto the breadth of rivers and seas\nwill easily overflow.\nThis is a metaphor:\na ruler of narrow capacity\nis like a marsh that overflows.\n\nHe who discards jade as if it were stone—\nis blind indeed.\nNot distinguishing jade from stone,\nnot discerning the wise from the foolish,\nis the mark of blindness.\nThe man with the **羊质虎皮** (*sheep’s nature, tiger’s appearance*) brings shame.\nNot measuring a man’s talents\nbefore employing him,\nhis virtue does not match his station.\nThis is like putting a tiger’s skin on a sheep—\ndoes it not bring disgrace to his dignity?\n\nThe garment that does not fit the collar—\nwill fall.\nIf one does not adjust the garment\nto fit the collar,\nit will surely fall.\nIf one employs people\nwithout measuring their talents,\ngovernance will be disordered.\n\nThe runner who does not watch the ground—\nwill tumble.\nThis is a metaphor:\nthe noble one’s virtue lies in careful deliberation.\nIf one does not examine and deliberate,\nthen one will surely fall into ruin.\n\nThe weak pillar invites the house’s collapse,\nthe feeble minister invites the state’s decline.\nA grand hall relies on its beams and pillars,\na wise ruler depends on his ministers.\nIf the ministers are not the right ones,\nit is like a house without beams—\nit will surely topple.\n\nCold feet harm the heart,\npeople’s resentment harms the state.\nThe state’s foundation is its people.\nA wise ruler can assuage the people’s grievances,\nconstantly observing their hearts,\nto follow what they desire.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou said:\n*\"When a state is about to fall, its people suffer first.\"*\n\nA mountain about to collapse\nfirst loses its base,\na state about to decline\nfirst sees its people hard-pressed.\nWhen roots wither and branches rot,\nthe people suffer and the state decays.\nA mountain’s foundation is its base,\na tree’s foundation is its root.\nIf one loses the foundation,\nall else cannot stand.\n\nHe who follows the same path as a overturned cart—\nwill topple,\nhe who acts in the same way as a ruined state—\nwill perish.\nWhen the previous cart has overturned,\nthe next should change its course.\nWhen a state has fallen,\nits laws should also be reformed.\nTo follow the same path again,\nis to invite one’s own ruin.\nObserving the past,\none should be cautious about the future—\nif one dislikes their traces,\nthen avoid them in advance.\nExamining the rise and fall of states,\none can see the sources of fortune and misfortune.\nThose who dislike their traces\nshould reform and avoid them,\nand thus will never be burdened.\n\nHe who fears peril is secure,\nhe who dreads ruin is preserved.\nThe noble one, though in safety,\nconsiders danger—\nand thus endures.\nIf one does not think or deliberate,\nif one indulges in desires without restraint,\nthen one invites ruin for oneself.\n\nAs for what people do,\nif they follow the Dao,\nthey will prosper;\nif they lack the Dao,\nthey will face misfortune.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou and King Wen\nsubdued the feudal lords
