Scrolls*\n*Source Text: The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (正统道藏), Dunxuan Section (洞玄部), Ritual Etiquette Category (威仪类)*\n\n---\n\n**The Golden Talisman Early Morning Ritual Ceremony**\n\n*Ritual Greetings to the Master*\n*Mindful invocation as prescribed*\nGolden True Glow of Jade Mists shines forth,\nIlluminating the Three Heavens.\nFlying Clouds ascend to Vermilion Expanse,\nAll celestial beings attend in procession.\n\nMorning Radiance dawns at break,\nDispelling all shadows and gloom.\nNine Mysterious Winds resound through the void,\nFive Stars wheel in celestial dance.\nTen Thousand Spirits respond in harmony,\nNaturally attuned to the Marvelous Dao.\n\nFaint and distant forms dissolve,\nManifesting in myriad shapes.\nDark Pearls radiate luminous light,\nAuspicious blessings descend upon the sacred altar.\n\nWelcoming celestial omens, gathering joyous rites,\nRefining essence with golden elixir springs.\nDemonic kings pay homage in reverence,\nUniting in the Three Fields of Splendor.\n\n*Twenty-four Beats of the Ritual Drum*\n\nTo the **Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Beginning Dao, Three Qi of the Most High Venerable Lord Laozi**—\nSummon forth my servant body, the **Three Five Officials of Merit, Left and Right Attendants, Bearers of Incense (Golden Boys), Messengers of Speech and Flower-Sprinkling (Jade Girls), and the Thirty-Six Imperial Officials of the Five Emperors, Direct Symbols, and Direct Sun Incense Masters**.\n\n*Those who emerge* are adorned in solemn ceremonial attire,\nCrowns and sashes with trailing ribbons.\n\n*Opening the Mystic Altar to the Local Land and Domain Spirits,*\n*To the Celestial Worthies of the Realm—*\n\nI now ascend the altar to practice the Dao,\nPaying homage to the Imperial Worthies.\n\nWith profound sincerity and reverence,\nI humbly present this sealed petition.\n\nMay the **Most High Venerable’s** most sacred Dao-qi, the **Spiritual Treasure Light**, descend upon me,\nInfusing my body with its radiance,\nSo that my sincere invocation may swiftly reach the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless, the Three Pure Ones, the Most High Celestial Sovereign of the Golden Gate, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**.\n\n*Requesting the Proper Titles and Ranks*\n\nI, **Servant of Rank [Blank]**, along with the assembled officials at the altar,\nHumbly together present this sincere petition to:\n\nThe **Natural Void, the Primordial Beginning Dao of the Boundless, the Most High Venerable of the Jade Pure Realm, the Great Luo Primordial Heavenly Worthies, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Venerable Lord Laozi, the Most High Celestial Sovereign Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven, the Sovereign Emperor of the Purple Forbidden Palace, the Great Emperor of the Purple Middle Palace and Northern Pole, the Earthly Sovereign of the Black Soil, the Sacred Worthies of the Seven-Tiered Celestial City of the Mystic Capital, the Spiritual Treasure Light of the Purple Forbidden Palace, the Celestial Worthies of the Golden Gate, the Sacred Assembly of the Mylos Celestial Hosts, the Supreme Ministers and Grand Overseers, the Lesser Ministers and Grand Tutors, the Four Teachers and Five Emperors, the Twelve Celestial Officials, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dao Master of the Mystic Core, the Three Heavenly Dao Masters, the Star Palaces of the Sun and Moon, the Celestial Lodges of the Circumpolar Constellations, the Star Spirits of the Milky Way, the Native Star Lords of the Emperor and the Imperial Heir, the Sacred Officials of the Five Inner Court Deities, and the True Spirits of the Three Realms.**\n\nMay their **boundless compassion descend**,\nAnd their **glorious gaze favor us**.\n\nI have heard that the **Nine Celestial Stems bestow blessings**,\nRevealing the **unspoken virtue of spontaneous response**;\n\nMay the **Three Auspicious Scenes** descend with compassion,\nAnd reveal the principle of **inevitable response to sincere feeling**.\n\nThus do we proclaim the **august model**,\nAnd solemnly establish the **bright and clear laws**.\n\nWe, Your humble subjects, have long abided as **mere motes of dust**,\nNestling within the **true domain of the Dao**.\n\nYet who would have thought, in our **ordinary folly**,\nThat we should meet with **Imperial favor**?\n\nDonning **feathered robes and star-studded hairpins**,\nWe have repeatedly received instruction from the **Teacher’s Platform**;\nPartaking of **elixir and sharing sacred tablets**,\nWe have partaken in the **transmission of the Mystic Chamber’s scriptures**.\n\nWe vow to **bring prosperity to the nation and achieve merit**,\nTo **ward off calamities and defend against disasters**.\n\nYet we deeply fear that our **learning is shallow and understanding meager**,\nAnd that we may **transgress the precepts** though we revere the teachings.\n\nUnder the **sun’s illumination and moon’s attendance**,\nWe bask in the **weighty grace of the Sage’s benevolence**.\n\nWe have yet to repay even a **drop of dew**,\nTo repay the **boundless virtue of the Sage’s nurturing**.\n\nWith **profound anxiety and reverence**,\nHow dare we forget to **pay homage in the morning**?\n\nIn **sincere supplication and earnest prayer**,\nWe seek the **certain efficacy of mutual resonance**.\n\nOur **fasting intentions are pure and refined**,\nAnd we have already made our **public declaration**.\n\nWe hope our **sincerity may reach the Ten Thousand Saints**,\nAnd that our **voice may penetrate the Ten Directions**.\n\nReviewing what we have presented,\nWe humbly affirm the **great wish**.\n\nThe **obscure and distant**—its form transcends the **Three Realms** to honor the **Sage’s majesty**;\nThe **fathomless and silent**—its essence penetrates all **ten thousand things**, yet remains forever still.\n\nThus it can **open the way and expand the vast**,\nAnd **generate the yin and yang**.\n\nSince ancient times, it has **enduringly preserved the post-heaven** and brought **tranquility and stability**.\n\nWith **a heart of fasting**, we have **felt sincere emotion**,\nAnd the **true response** is **without limit**.\n\nWith today’s pure and clear dawn, we practice the Dao,\nAnd humbly request the Law from all worthy beings,\nAs we now light the first incense and pray—\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend unobstructed,\nDirectly offering its tribute,\nTo the **True and Supreme Dao-Treasure**, the **Great Sage of Unending Beginning**, the **Venerable Lord of Golden Gates and Jade Palaces**, the **Supreme Emperor of Heaven**, and all the **Worthy Saints**.\n\nWe, Your subjects, have **surrendered body, spirit, and fate**,\nAnd prostrate ourselves with heads to the earth,\nRelying upon the **Three Most High Venerables** and the **Saints of the Ten Directions**,\nThat the merit of this incense may bless the **Emperor’s Majesty**.\n\nWe pray that his **longevity may endure like the Southern Mountain’s**,\nAnd his life be **preserved eternally as the heavens**;\nThat he may **ever reside in the Northern Pole’s exaltation**,\nAnd **share in the Dao’s boundless duration** with the **Worthy Ones**.\n\nMay the **Three Spirits** favor him,\nAnd **divine fortune** extend to him for **countless years and ages** without end;\nMay the **Four Seas** be **at peace and unified**,\nAnd **harmonized under one rule**, sharing the **same script and civilization**.\n\nNo wild beasts shall roam unchecked,\nAnd the **palace halls** shall gather the **worthy and virtuous** as of old;\nThe people shall **return to filial piety and benevolence**,\nAnd the **world rejoice in the governance of Xi and Xun**.\n\nWarfare shall **cease and weapons rest**,\nAnd the **fields yield abundant harvests**.\nAll **government and teachings** shall bring **joy to both heaven and humankind**.\n\nThus, we now burn incense—\nTo **surrender to the Teacher, the Great Sage, and all the Worthy Ones**.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue of the True**,\nOnce attained through the Dao,\n**Preserves the heavens eternally**,\nAnd **harmonizes with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nThe **Great Brightness** arises in the East,\nWith a **mind ever humble**, serving the **Highest**.\nIts **radiant splendor** ascends in glory,\nAnd its **deepest mysteries** are revealed at dawn.\n\nNow, at this **early morning court assembly**,\nWe ascend the **altar and practice the Dao**.\n\nNow, let the assembly of the Dao gather and offer these two strands of incense.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,\nDirectly offering homage to the **Supreme True Scripture Jewel Celestial Sovereign of the Primordial Spirit Treasure**,\nThe **Purple Micro Emperor of Heaven, the August Sovereign of Yu’s Remnant Celestial Palace, and the Sacred Assembly of True Immortals**.\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** to the **Three Supreme Lords and the Ten-Directional Sacred Ones**.\n\nMay the merit of this incense be respectfully dedicated,\nTo bless the **Royal Prince** with **divinely granted wisdom and longevity**.\nMay he **prosper in the Green Palace of Spring**,\nAs the **four seas sing in praise and pay homage**.\nMay the **winds of the Purple Forbidden City be pure**,\nWith the **three celestial luminaries shining brightly upon his abode of peace**.\n\nMay his **wings be strengthened by worthy ministers**,\nAnd his **clan and branches grow ever more obedient**.\n\nNow, we burn incense—\nTo **surrender to the Teacher, the Great Sage, and all the Worthy Ones**.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue of the True**,\nOnce attained through the Dao,\n**Preserves the heavens eternally**,\nAnd **harmonizes with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nThe **Pure Clarity** shines at dawn,\nFacing the heavens beyond.\nThe **morning radiance illuminates the court assembly**,\nAnd the **sun’s brilliance opens upon the Moon Palace**.\n\nNow, at this **clear morning dawn**,\nWe ascend the altar and practice the Dao.\n\nNow, let the assembly of the Dao gather and offer these three strands of incense.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,\nDirectly offering homage to the **Supreme True Master Jewel of the Five Spirits, the Venerable Old Sovereign of Heaven**,\nThe **Purple Micro Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**,\nThe **August Sovereign of the Earth, the Imperial Soil Deity**,\nAnd the **boundless Sacred Assembly of the Great Red Celestial Palace**.\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,\nProstrate ourselves with our heads to the ground,\nAnd **rely upon the Three Supreme Lords and the Ten-Directional Sacred Ones**.\n\nMay the merit of this incense be dedicated,\nTo **flow back to the seven ancestral temples and the ancestral spirits of the clan**.\n\nMay it be granted to **ascend upon the Nine-Pure Daoic chariot**,\nTo **enter the realm of the Supreme Void**;\nTo **climb the wondrous court of Great Possession**,\nAnd **rejoice in the true and divine realm**.\n\nMay blessings extend to **ten thousand generations**,\nAnd **harmoniously aid the ancestral lineage**.\n\nNow, we burn incense—\nTo **surrender to the Teacher, the Great Sage, and all the Worthy Ones**.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue of the True**,\nOnce attained through the Dao,\n**Ascends into the Formless**,\nAnd **harmonizes with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\n**Rituals are complete—**\n**Repentance is fulfilled**.\n\n**Threefold Invocation, Threefold Rituals**\n**Twice Proclaiming the Daoic Rank,**\n**With full submission, the lowly subject of surname [Certain] and the assembled officials at the altar,**\n**With utmost sincerity and reverence, we humbly address the Supreme Lords of the Three Realms and the Ten-Directional Sacred Ones,**\n**The Jade Capital Golden Gate Celestial Emperor, the Celestial True Ones,**\n**The Sun, Moon, Stars, and all the Celestial Worthies,**\n**The Ten-Directional Teacher-Saints and their assemblies,**\n**The Three Realms’ officials and all the ritual effigies and numinous presences.**\n\nWe have heard:\n**To aid the myriad sages and flourish in excellence,**\n**To harmonize the profound and subtle in wondrous unity;**\n**To perform one good deed and invite auspicious omens,**\n**To respond in resonance like echoes and reflections.**\n\nThe **Dao’s transformative radiance shines resplendent,**\nThe **divine spirits descend in boundless discernment.**\n**When moved, the way opens; without seeking, nothing remains unanswered.**\n\nWe, the lowly, **bow to our innate sincerity of old,**\n**And aspire to repay the Dao’s nurturing power.**\n\nLike the **Great Tree of Bright Clarity,**\n**Dispersing the morning sun’s radiance across the celestial court;**\nLike the **Sage Pine’s fragrant blossoms,**\n**Wafting incense winds over the ritual feast.**\n\nWith **earnest devotion to the Celestial,**\nAnd **solemn reverence from the heart,**\nWe **align with the Imperial steps,**\n**And perform the wondrous Daoic rites.**\n\nYet **the Three Karmas and Six Dusts** remain uncleansed from past lives’ offenses;\n**The Nine Peaks and Ten Extremes** offer only glimpses of the Saints’ luminous presence.\n\n**Only through boundless forgiveness of transgressions**\n**May grace extend to all, like rivers flowing wide.**\n\n**May the Celestial Mandate endure eternally,**\n**And the Sage’s lifespan stretch unending.**\n**May all under heaven sing of the Dao-governed realm,**\n**And the seas rejoice in the governance of Non-Action.**\n\n**May arms rest in peace,**\n**And the harvests overflow in abundance.**\n\n**Next, we pray for rains to cleanse calamitous dust,**\n**For spring’s warmth to revive the Sage’s body,**\n**For virtuous roots to deepen,**\n**And the Daoic path to flourish anew.**\n\n**Universal blessings upon the Seven Ancestral Temples and the Clan’s Sacred Lineage.**\n\nWe, the **Three Teachers and Five Friends,**\n**The Seven Ancestors and Nine Mystics,**\n**Having awakened to past causes and illuminated our true nature,**\n**Ascend to the radiant expanse of the Great Vermilion Clouds,**\n**And enter the True Treasure’s central realm.**\n\nThus, **all moving, growing, flying, and creeping beings—**\n**From the vast to the minute, high to low—**\n**Equally bathed in the nurturing qi of Heaven and Earth,**\n**All benefit from the Creative Transformations’ birth-giving power.**\n\n**Crowned with the Dipper, adorned with stars,**\n**We rejoice in the mountain forests’ cultivation;**\n**Plowing fields and digging wells,**\n**We delight in the songs of the common folk.**\n\n**The ancestral state rests in peace,**\n**And the Mystic Wind flourishes evermore.**\n**Thus, above, we honor the Heavenly Sage’s boundless compassion,**\n**And below, we fulfill our subjects’ sincere surrender.**\n\n**Respectfully submitted for divine acknowledgment.**\n\n**Twelvefold Vows—**\n**Burning incense with focused spirit.**\n\n「The Fragrant Officials, celestial messengers, and the Dragon-Tiger Generals of left and right,\nalong with the attendant Spirit Officials of incense—\nlet them command me to rise at dawn, pure and clear, upon the altar,\nwhere the **Way’s** practice unfolds,\nand **qi** naturally generates the golden nectar, the **virtue/power** of the vermilion grass, and the emerald sprouts.\n\nA hundred spirits and assembled **Dao/Way** beings,\nconverging here, before the incense flame and fire furnace.\n\nMay I vow that the **Dao/Way**-tended

**Dao/Way**,\nthe **Three Pure Ones**—**Heavenly Sage**, **Earthly Sage**, and **Human Sage**—\nbefore the **Supreme Jade Emperor’s** august throne,\nthe **Golden Gate** and **Jade Sovereign** of the
