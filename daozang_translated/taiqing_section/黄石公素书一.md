**Preface to *Huangshi Gong’s *Sūshū***
By Wei Ru (魏鲁), *Shibo Xin County Magistrate*, *Junior Assistant in the Board of Music*

Huangshi Gong—descended from the celestial star of governance, a divine manifestation of the august heavens—assisted the virtuous sovereign with his counsel and aided worthy ministers in their schemes. He expounded the five eternal principles of conduct and left behind teachings that endure forever.

His work encompasses:
- The Dao and virtue in governing the realm,
- Techniques for preserving life and body,
- Strategies for achieving hegemony and rectifying the state.

When Zhang Liang obtained these teachings, he unified the world;
When Zhuge Liang practiced them, he dominated the Three Rivers.

Ah! The sage-king understands the natural order of rites and music, his wisdom divinely bestowed. There has never been one who succeeded without aligning with these principles of Dao, virtue, and righteousness.

I, Ru, a humble recluse of the mountains and valleys, have presumptuously glimpsed the sacred mysteries. My words are crude and unrefined, my understanding shallow and failing to fathom the depths. Errors are inevitable—I await future scholars for correction.

**Huangshi Gong’s *Sūshū***

**Chapter 1: The Five Principles as One (五者一体章)**

The Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are inseparable.
One who possesses the Dao must also have virtue.
Virtue must embrace benevolence.
When benevolence is cultivated, righteousness must be practiced.
Thus, a sovereign who embodies the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness must govern through propriety.

Hence, the five—Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—none may be omitted.

The **Dao** is the path all follow, ensuring all things attain their natural course.
A sovereign does not oppose the people’s welfare, allowing them to fulfill their inherent nature through proper governance.

**Virtue** is what is bestowed upon people, granting them what they desire.
The sovereign’s path lies in generosity, not stinginess, aligning with the natural order—silent yet trustworthy.

**Benevolence** is what draws people near.
A sovereign must cherish his people as his own children, so they revere him as a loving parent.
This benevolence manifests as:
- *Cī* (慈): constant care lest any suffer neglect,
- *Huì* (惠): generous bestowal of resources, nurturing talent with appropriate aid,
- *Cèyǐn* (恻隐): compassion for the smallest afflictions, concern for others as for one’s own children.

**Righteousness** is what is fitting.
Reward the virtuous, punish the wicked, and thus achieve success in undertakings.
Righteousness means:
- Not withholding merit due to personal bias,
- Not sparing the guilty because of kinship.
Only then can one succeed in governance.

**Propriety** is the path all tread.
Rising with the dawn and resting at dusk, maintaining the order of human relationships.
As the sovereign’s superior, he must diligently observe rites day and night, thus transforming society—establishing hierarchy, prohibiting unlawful acts—this is called *transmitting the teaching*.

As the *Shijing* says:
*"A man without propriety—why not die swiftly?"*

To be human is to embody these five; none may be neglected.

Thus, the wise and virtuous understand the cycles of flourishing and decline, mastering the patterns of success and failure.
To discern flourishing and decline is to be wise:
- Serve a virtuous sovereign and prosper;
- Withdraw if the sovereign is without the Dao—this is wisdom in decline.

To grasp success and failure:
- Assist a virtuous sovereign in his excellence;
- Never align with a wicked one, lest you share his ruin—yet remain untainted.
Thus, even in a corrupt age, you preserve yourself—this is mastery.

To perceive the signs of order and chaos, to know when to approach or withdraw:
- If the sovereign is virtuous, the realm is orderly—approach and succeed;
- If the sovereign is without the Dao, the realm is in chaos—depart and avoid ruin.
This is the logic of *approach and withdrawal*.

Thus, the wise withdraw into obscurity, preserving the Dao, awaiting their moment.
*"Potent"* means hidden.
The virtuous blend into the world, revealing their teachings only to an enlightened sovereign.
Hence, *"awaiting their moment."*

If the time arrives and they act, they attain the highest rank as minister.
When sovereign and minister align in the Dao, they achieve great deeds—all under heaven submit to virtue, and their reputation reaches its zenith.
If they act without the Dao, though they may gain power, it will not endure.

To act at the right moment is to achieve unparalleled success.
*"Machine"* (机) means strategy.
A man’s schemes are like a crossbow’s trigger—if aimed correctly, nothing is missed.
Acting at the opportune moment ensures success.
Thus, a crossbow must not be fired recklessly, nor strategies employed without cause.
A reckless discharge is folly; a misapplied scheme leads to ruin.
Only when timing and strategy align does success come as if by divine will.

If they fail to meet their moment, they vanish from history.
*"Vanish"* means hidden.
If sovereign and minister do not align, they cannot assist—thus, they retreat from the world.
They must not seek office recklessly; if they do not serve, no calamity befalls them.
Thus, those who walk this path attain high station and enduring fame—these are the sages.

**Chapter 2: The Dao as Life (正道如生章)**

**Virtue** is sufficient to attract the distant,
Not fixating on trifles but pursuing the grand—this is virtue.

**Faithfulness** unifies the disparate,
Heaven acts without speech, yet the seasons proceed without deviation—cold and heat never stray by a hair’s breadth.

**Chapter 2: The Dao as Life (正道如生章第二)**

Thus, the **gentleman** models himself after **Heaven**,
**Faithfulness** cannot be abandoned—
Establish his laws and measures,
Consistent from beginning to end.

**Virtue** is sufficient to win the people,
Not hoarding wealth for himself,
Nor enriching his own person—
Only then can he command their loyalty.

**Talent** is sufficient to discern antiquity,
But *talent* does not mean literary skill—
It means **public virtue**—
To emulate the fine deeds of past rulers,
And to examine their flaws with discernment—
This is to discern antiquity.

**Clarity** is sufficient to illuminate the lower ranks,
For the **gentleman** stands above others,
Like a mirror on a pedestal—
Nothing escapes its reflection.
He can weigh the merits and faults of men,
Thus, he is called a **clear sovereign**.
This is the **exemplary man**.

To practice these five virtues—
He attains the name of **exemplary talent**.

**Conduct** is sufficient to serve as a model,
For all his actions conform to proper **rites and norms**—
The people take him as their standard,
And he becomes their model.

**Wisdom** is sufficient to resolve doubts and suspicions,
Avoiding doubts and shunning suspicions—
This is to possess **wisdom**.

**Faithfulness** can keep one’s word,
Accepting the ruler’s command,
Even if he must cross ten thousand *li* to distant lands—
His **faithfulness** remains unshaken.

**Integrity** is sufficient to distribute wealth,
Not enriching himself while impoverishing others.
This is the **heroic man**.
To practice these four virtues—
He attains the name of **heroic warrior**.

To fulfill his duties without neglect—
Not to abandon his post while issuing orders—
This is called *not neglecting*.

To stand firm in righteousness—
Serving his lord with loyalty,
Seeing danger and giving his life to rescue—
His **rectitude** never wavers—
This is called *not faltering*.

To gain profit without seizing it recklessly,
To face peril without fleeing it—
This is the **outstanding man**.
What is not the **Dao’s** profit—
How can one seize it recklessly?
What is righteousness’ peril—
How can one flee it?

This is called the **outstanding man**.

**Chapter 3: Seeking the People’s Will (求人之志章)**

To curb desires and restrain appetites—
This is how one removes burdens.
If a ruler indulges in a single pleasure,
The people abandon their duties,
And vie to curry favor with what he loves.
Excessive desires ensnare the mind—
Thus, to not indulge, to not desire,
Naturally frees one from such burdens.

To suppress evil and curb wrongdoing—
This is how one repels faults.
*Suppression* means restraining judgment,
*Curbing* means extinguishing wicked deeds—
Thus, one’s own faults are removed.

To reject wine and moderate passions—
This is how one avoids defilement.
Wine and lust bring no benefit,
Only harm—
They muddy the spirit, dimming clarity,
And cloud the mind, so that governance is unwise.
A turbid spirit is like a miscalculated **divination**,
A darkened mind fails to judge affairs with precision.

To avoid suspicion and shun doubts—
How can one escape calamity?
To be well-learned and ask diligently—
This is how one broadens **wisdom**.
The teachings of past rulers
Are recorded in the **classics**—
To study widely and peruse them,
To perfect one’s learning.
To ask diligently means
There are things yet unclear—
To question thoroughly,
To expand one’s **wisdom**.

To uphold lofty conduct and speak subtly—
This is how one cultivates the self.
*Lofty conduct* means
To dwell below without descending too deeply,
To live among the masses without standing apart—
This is called *lofty conduct*.
*Subtle speech* means
To practice the words of past rulers,
Their **instructions** handed down to posterity,
To transform others—
This is called *subtle speech*.
To focus and act upon them,
This is called *cultivating the self*.

To be reverent, frugal, humble, and moderate—
This is how one protects himself.
To be reverent toward all things,
Others will respect him;
To be frugal, moderate, and gentle,
He ensures lasting safety.

To plan deeply and think far ahead—
This is how one avoids ruin.
Plans that lack depth bring defeat,
Thoughts that do not extend bring sorrow.
Thus, the **gentleman** plans and thinks with depth and foresight,
And avoids the extremes of poverty and peril.

To associate with the virtuous and befriend the upright—
This is how one supports the fallen.
To take the virtuous as kin,
To bind the upright as friends—
Thus, one’s person is never harmed by misfortune.

To approach others with **benevolence** and earnest action—
This is how one connects with them.
To overlook others’ faults,
To conceal one’s own strengths,
To not be arrogant toward all things,
And to act with reverence—
Thus, none remain beyond his reach.

To employ capable men and utilize their talents—
This is how one accomplishes tasks.
A skilled artisan wastes no material,
A capable general discards no soldier.
To measure their talents and use them accordingly—
Thus, their duties are fulfilled.

To sever evil and reject slander—
This is how one stops chaos.
To close the door to slanderous speech,
To block the path of deceit—
To walk the **Dao’s** straight path,
Naturally, there is no calamity or disorder.

To trace origins and reflect on antiquity—
This is how one avoids confusion.
The **gentleman** examines both ends and beginnings,
Not hasty in seeking advancement beyond his predecessors—
He always establishes merit and attains great renown,
Thus, he avoids confusion.

To deliberate first and then act—
This is how one responds to crises.
Military strategy demands caution,
Thus, the **art of war** says:
Its essence lies in **preemptive planning**,
So that preparation is never lacking.
Without preemptive deliberation,
How can one respond to crises?

To adapt to changes and employ expedients—
This is how one resolves deadlocks.
The **gentleman’s** nature is like water,
Which conforms to its container—
Not rigid, but flexible—
He must adapt and flow,
Thus, he can untie what is knotted.

To gather wealth without burdening the **Dao**—
This is how one avoids blame.
Not to amass wealth that violates the **Dao**
Yet still to benefit the people—
Thus, there is no disaster or harm.

To be earnest and upright—
This is how one establishes merit.
To be diligent and industrious—
This is how one safeguards his end.
To never falter or be complacent,
From beginning to end, consistent—
This is how one long preserves his noble station.

**Chapter 4: The Dao of Virtue and Sovereignty (德宗章)**

The art of cultivating a steadfast mind and righteous conduct—
Nothing surpasses **strategic deliberation**,
The petty man relies on strength to contend,
The **gentleman** triumphs through **scheming**—
Thus, the worthy general conquers without battle.
Therefore, exerting force is not as effective as **strategic success**.

No peace surpasses **restraining desire**,
To restrain what one desires
So that the mind and spirit remain unperturbed—
When the mind and spirit are unperturbed,
The four limbs are at ease.

No priority surpasses **cultivating virtue**,
To **cultivate virtue** is the foremost of all actions—
Thus, **Heaven** favors none,
Only **virtue** does it assist.

No joy surpasses **loving goodness**,
To exalt and follow the **orthodox teachings**,
To revere and honor the **divine**—
This is **goodness**.

No divinity surpasses **utter sincerity**,
**Utter sincerity** moves the **divine**—
When **sincerity** arises from the heart,
It can even shift **Heaven and Earth**,
And evoke the **spirits and gods**.

No purity surpasses **guarding against defilement**,
To be cautious and vigilant, free from taint—
This leads to **high purity**.

No fortune surpasses **knowing contentment**,
To follow **uprightness** and embody the **Dao**,
Not to seek wealth and noble station through unrighteous means—
Thus, he always preserves **auspicious blessings**.

「Suffering knows none greater than excessive desires—
Excessive desires bring little gain,
Yet they weary the heart.

Sorrow knows none deeper than dissipated vitality—
The body is the dwelling of the spirit.
When vitality is dissipated, the body withers,
And the spirit has no home—
Then the spirits of darkness invade.
Though gold and jade fill the halls,
They cannot redeem the life,
Nor can loved ones prolong the days.

Illness knows none worse than instability—
The noble person’s nature must have its measure,
For if it lacks constancy, that is disease.

Short-lived fortune knows none fleeter than that gained by unrighteous means—
If not obtained by proper way,
Such fortune will not endure.

Darkness knows none deeper than greed and meanness—
Demanding favors for oneself,
Yet showing meanness to others—
This is the conduct of the petty,
Hence the name "dark."

Loneliness knows none greater than stubborn self-righteousness—
A ruler who clings to his own views,
Accusing others of wrong,
While the wise and clear do not join in counsel,
Nor the enlightened lend their sight—
Is he not alone?

Peril knows none sharper than harboring doubt—
If doubt is held in mind,
It must not be indulged.
To indulge what is doubted
Is to court death and calamity.

Defeat knows none surer than excessive self-interest—
The public-minded have no fear,
But self-interest breeds ruin.

**Chapter Five: On the Reverence for Righteousness**
Shallow understanding is when clarity is not concealed—
If wisdom is not hidden within,
The heart cannot reflect its light,
And one may be called shallow.

Ignorance of faults is self-delusion—
The noble person renews his virtue daily,
Yet fears he may have faults unrecognized.
To err and not return is confusion—
The sun and moon wax and wane in turn,
And who among men is without fault?
What harm if faults are confessed and corrected?
Yet to fear faults but not mend them
Is to be lost in confusion.

Slander through words brings ruin—
He who does not consider the consequences,
Who wounds others with his speech,
Will first invite their enmity,
And in time, their vengeance.
Thus it is said: *"The tongue is the gate to calamity."*

Commands at odds with the heart bring ruin—
If decrees run contrary to the heart,
The people will not show respect.

Orders that contradict prior laws invite destruction—
If laws are enacted without harmony,
Then slander and defamation arise.

Anger without authority invites transgression—
The noble person must not be light in his words,
For without awe, the petty will dare to offend.

Loving to humiliate others invites disaster—
To degrade others before all,
To be despised by the multitude—
Accumulated grudges fester within,
And in time, bring ruin.

To entrust one’s rule to the humiliated is peril—
Never to bear those who have been wronged unjustly,
For to do so is to invite danger.
He who gains power through such means
Is ever near the brink.

To scorn those worthy of respect invites misfortune—
If one disdains those who should be honored,
Calamity will surely follow.

Hypocrisy—when form and heart are divided—
Leads to isolation,
For those whose outward appearance betrays their inner purpose
Will find their affairs often misaligned.
When few are their allies,
Then loneliness is their fate.

To favor flatterers while distancing the loyal brings downfall—
To reject the words of the virtuous,
Yet heed the whispers of the deceitful—
When loyal ministers flee the court,
And sycophants hold sway,
This is the root of ruin.

To indulge in color while neglecting the wise brings folly—
To love beauty but not the virtuous,
This is the mark of a confused ruler.

To appoint unworthy men to office brings emptiness—
When one lacks the talent and virtue for office,
Yet clings to its rewards,
Like driftwood upon the waves,
Such rule is fleeting and vain.

When women meddle in public affairs, disorder follows—
When relatives and kin exploit public office
For private gain,
This is the seed of chaos.

When subjects harbor foreign thoughts, they perish—
If the heart turns outward,
Then loyalty wanes.
To lean on feeble virtue alone
Is the sign of impending fall.

When ruler and subjects are at odds, they scatter—
When harmony between lord and ministers is lost,
And discord takes root,
Then separation and ruin are near.

When ruler and subjects neglect each other, no great deeds are done—
When lord and ministers support one another,
Their achievements rival Heaven and Earth.
But if their judgments differ,
What great work can be accomplished?

When ruler and subjects betray each other, they topple—
To seize power by force,
To trade office for wealth—
Then both ruler and ministers face ruin.

To oppress the weak and claim victory as virtue is to invite encroachment—
To rely on one’s own strength,
To bully the lowly and claim triumph—
This is called aggression,
And is not the way of the virtuous.

To boast of empty fame while lacking true merit is to erode one’s standing—
To parade false glory,
Yet perform no deeds—
Then one’s reputation fades,
And one’s path is worn away.

To belittle others while showcasing one’s own strengths is to invite disorder—
To display one’s own talents,
Yet criticize others’ failings,
And boast in one’s own abilities—
This will surely bring downfall.

To enrich oneself while impoverishing others invites abandonment—
If one hoards wealth while neglecting others,
Then hearts will not be united,
And rebellion will follow.

To obscure great merit with petty faults is to diminish one’s worth—
If one hides great achievements behind small mistakes,
Then progress will be stifled,
And ambition will wane daily.
Thus it is said: *"The petty fault obscures the grand."*

To reward without merit breeds resentment—
If the undeserving are rewarded,
And the worthy grow bitter—
Then the heart is stifled.

To punish the innocent is cruelty—
If the guiltless are punished,
Then the good suffer violence.
To hear flattery as sweetest fare,
Yet treat honest counsel as an enemy—
What ruler so distant from the Dao
Will not meet ruin?

He who holds what he ought is secure—
To covet what others possess is to court destruction.
He who holds what is his own
Is full yet does not overflow,
And thus remains at peace.

The ruler without the Dao who demands others’ possessions
Can only meet ruin or harm.

**Chapter Six: On the Stability of Rituals**
Resentment arises from not pardoning small faults—」

「Picking out minor faults and harboring resentment—
this is a rare virtue indeed.

Disaster lies in failing to plan ahead.
If one does not plan ahead,
when calamity strikes, what is there to regret?

Fortune comes from accumulating good deeds—
Households that accumulate virtue
will surely have lasting blessings.

Misfortune arises from amassing evil.
Households that accumulate unvirtuous deeds
will inevitably face lingering calamities.

Hunger stems from neglecting the farmers,
cold from abandoning the weavers.
If one follows the Dao of Heaven
and shares the benefits of the Earth,
why would there be hunger or cold?

Stability comes from gaining worthy people—
If one secures the right people,
they will uphold governance with loyalty,
and thus the virtuous ruler remains at peace.

Peril lies in losing the scholars.
Scholars have the power to assist the ruler,
upholding him with sincerity.
If they are instead rejected by their lord,
then the wise will withdraw,
and the state will face ruin and decline.

Wealth comes from welcoming guests,
poverty from tardiness.
The wise plan in advance,
the foolish act only after the fact.
When rulers lack steadfast principles,
the people grow full of doubt.

The noble one remains firm in proper conduct,
neither yielding nor advancing without measure—
this is the mark of possessing **德** (*virtue/power*).
If the heart is restless and not steady,
if joy and anger are unchecked,
then no one can fathom it,
and thus suspicion and doubt flourish.

Contempting the ruler invites punishment,
insulting the subjects invites estrangement.
Disdaining the ruler brings disaster,
insulting the subjects makes them distant.
When ruler and subjects grow distant,
then there is no bond of loyalty.

Nearly unvalued, the distant are slighted.
To know one’s ruler,
first observe his ministers.
Good ministers in court
will reflect virtue back to their lord.
A state without good ministers
is like a cart without its axle—
unstable and bound to collapse.

He who doubts himself cannot trust others,
he who trusts himself doubts no one.
Rulers often doubt themselves,
and thus fail to heed loyal and upright counsel.
If one sincerely trusts himself,
then others will naturally respond with sincerity—
why then the need for doubt?

The crooked man has no straight friends—
*"Crooked"* here means perverse.
He who favors perversity
must inevitably loathe the straight,
and thus it is said he has no straight friends.

A crooked ruler will have no straight subjects.
There has never been a case where form is upright
yet shadow is crooked.
If the ruler is not upright,
even the subjects must bend and twist.

A perilous state lacks virtuous ministers.
For a state to fall into disaster,
is like a body suffering from illness.
One who excels in nurturing health
will not allow it to worsen,
and one who excels in governing
will not let the state topple.
Using loyal and trustworthy words,
its ruin may yet be averted;
following ill-advised schemes,
the state will surely perish.
When a state is already in peril,
what can the virtuous do to save it?
Thus it is said: *it lacks virtuous ministers.*

Chaos in governance comes from lacking good people.
The ruler shapes the people through **风化** (*cultural refinement*),
and thus the petty will follow suit.

The deeper one’s love for the people,
the more urgent the search for worthy ministers.
In ancient times, the Duke of Zhou (*Zhōu Gōng*)
wished to establish a great and lasting realm,
and thus sought out the world’s virtuous ones.
He would interrupt his meals to welcome guests,
and grasp his hair in eagerness to serve those in need.
Though in high station, he pursued the world’s scholars,
helping them achieve great deeds,
and his reputation endured for ten thousand generations.
He is called a **圣人** (*sage*).

The joy of securing worthy ministers
lies in generous provision.
To catch fish, one must use fragrant bait;
to retain scholars, one must offer rich rewards.
Using fragrant bait to catch fish,
the fish may soon be depleted.
Offering rich rewards to retain scholars,
they will all come—
and thus the world’s worthy ones gather and return.
Worthy scholars, summoned yet not returning,
are a sign of a state’s decline.
If the ruler grows benighted,
then the virtuous will leave the state.

Welcoming them yet they do not return—
this is the sign of a state’s ruin.

When a state is about to perish,
the virtuous scholars depart first.
Zhengzi left the State of Shang,
Confucius left the State of Lu.
Where the land is thin,
great things do not grow.
Where the waters are shallow,
great fish do not swim.
Where the trees are bare,
great birds do not nest.
Where the forest is sparse,
great beasts do not dwell.
All these are metaphors:
a ruler’s virtue is not broad,
and thus the wise find no place to rest.

The steep mountain will collapse—
a mountain without foundation,
too sheer and lofty alone,
is bound to fall.
This is a metaphor:
a ruler without ministers
will surely face political peril and ruin.

The full marsh will burst—
a marsh that does not extend
to the breadth of rivers and seas
will easily overflow.
This is a metaphor:
a ruler of narrow capacity
is like a marsh that overflows.

He who discards jade as if it were stone—
is blind indeed.
Not distinguishing jade from stone,
not discerning the wise from the foolish,
is the mark of blindness.
The man with the **羊质虎皮** (*sheep’s nature, tiger’s appearance*) brings shame.
Not measuring a man’s talents
before employing him,
his virtue does not match his station.
This is like putting a tiger’s skin on a sheep—
does it not bring disgrace to his dignity?

The garment that does not fit the collar—
will fall.
If one does not adjust the garment
to fit the collar,
it will surely fall.
If one employs people
without measuring their talents,
governance will be disordered.

The runner who does not watch the ground—
will tumble.
This is a metaphor:
the noble one’s virtue lies in careful deliberation.
If one does not examine and deliberate,
then one will surely fall into ruin.

The weak pillar invites the house’s collapse,
the feeble minister invites the state’s decline.
A grand hall relies on its beams and pillars,
a wise ruler depends on his ministers.
If the ministers are not the right ones,
it is like a house without beams—
it will surely topple.

Cold feet harm the heart,
people’s resentment harms the state.
The state’s foundation is its people.
A wise ruler can assuage the people’s grievances,
constantly observing their hearts,
to follow what they desire.

The Duke of Zhou said:
*"When a state is about to fall, its people suffer first."*

A mountain about to collapse
first loses its base,
a state about to decline
first sees its people hard-pressed.
When roots wither and branches rot,
the people suffer and the state decays.
A mountain’s foundation is its base,
a tree’s foundation is its root.
If one loses the foundation,
all else cannot stand.

He who follows the same path as a overturned cart—
will topple,
he who acts in the same way as a ruined state—
will perish.
When the previous cart has overturned,
the next should change its course.
When a state has fallen,
its laws should also be reformed.
To follow the same path again,
is to invite one’s own ruin.
Observing the past,
one should be cautious about the future—
if one dislikes their traces,
then avoid them in advance.
Examining the rise and fall of states,
one can see the sources of fortune and misfortune.
Those who dislike their traces
should reform and avoid them,
and thus will never be burdened.

He who fears peril is secure,
he who dreads ruin is preserved.
The noble one, though in safety,
considers danger—
and thus endures.
If one does not think or deliberate,
if one indulges in desires without restraint,
then one invites ruin for oneself.

As for what people do,
if they follow the Dao,
they will prosper;
if they lack the Dao,
they will face misfortune.

The Duke of Zhou and King Wen
subdued the feudal lords through virtue,
and thus the world returned to them.
They had armies yet did not fight,
and still achieved victory.
They had cities yet did not fortify them,
and yet faced no enemies.
Their descendants ruled for over eight hundred years—
they are called **吉君** (*auspicious rulers*).

The rulers Jie and Zhou
indulged in their cruelty and violence,
making pools of wine and forests of meat,
piling treasures like hills.
They recruited warriors who could
pluck mountains or lift cauldrons,
who could walk on land as if it were water
or sail on earth as if it were sea,
who could bend a bow or sever a rope with ease—
thousands of such fierce men they gathered.
Yet they saw their ruin in an instant,
their heads separated from their bodies,
their descendants extinguished.
Though they lacked the Dao,
they were briefly indulged—
yet their shame was proclaimed for a hundred generations.
Is this not pitiful indeed?»

The auspicious gather a hundred blessings,
while the calamitous invite a hundred disasters.
When a ruler practices virtue and benevolence,
the people rally to him, and fortune follows.
When a ruler acts with cruelty and tyranny,
the people rise against him, and misfortune ensues.
This is not the work of divine or saintly intervention—
it is the natural consequence of one’s deeds.

Master Huangshi humbly declared:
*"It is not my power to bring fortune or misfortune upon others,
but rather, I follow the actions of people and bring forth their own blessings or curses."*

Those who strive to devise good strategies avoid evil deeds,
and those who plan ahead escape near-term anxieties.
A gentleman who does not seek good counsel
is like wood that does not follow the plumb line—
without foresight, how can he avoid sorrow?

The bold can be commanded to charge in battle,
but not to endure steadfastly.
Steadfastness means firm resolve.
The resolute can be ordered to hold fast,
but not to overpower enemies.
Resoluteness is the depth of virtue and benevolence.

The greedy can be directed to seize and take,
but not to distribute wealth—
for once they demand riches,
they will surely risk their lives for them.

The frugal can be entrusted with defense,
but not with aggressive action—
for those who cling to purity and isolation
struggle to unite with others.

The trustworthy can be tasked with keeping promises,
but not with adapting to change—
for those bound by rigid loyalty
lack the flexibility to respond.

If these five qualities are guided according to their strengths and tempered accordingly,
then all will flourish without fail.

*Thus concludes the Yellow Stone Classic.*
