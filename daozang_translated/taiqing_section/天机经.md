# 天机经

Composed circa the Tang-Song interregnum, *Yinfu Tianji Jing* (*Classic of Heaven’s Mechanism in the Yin Talisman*) is recorded in the *Tongzhi Yiwen Lue* as a single fascicle. The present edition derives from the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Taiqing Section, and also appears in *Yunji Qiqian*, juan fifteen.

**Preface** states: To possess the mechanism without the person is to fail; to possess the person without the Way is likewise to fail. Thus the *Yijing* says: “Pursuing the deer without a forester, one enters the forest alone—even a gentleman of discernment would do better to abandon the chase, lest he meet with regret.” Therefore the sage observes the season and employs his talisman, responds to the mechanism and regulates affairs, thereby wielding life and death within his palm and accomplishing great enterprises under heaven. The *Yijing* says: “The noble person conceals his instruments within, awaiting the proper moment to act.” Thus the sage preserves them in the numinous terrace, observing the shifts of mechanism. When rolled up, they enable self-mastery; when unfurled, they overcome others. When scrutinized, they have no form; when employed, they are inexhaustible. The *Yijing* says: “That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the numinous.” And the *Yin Talisman* embodies this. Thus the sage’s unfathomable talisman harmonizes all under heaven without incurring resentment.

Heaven presides over earth, the Dao reigns over virtue; therefore the sage serves earth and models himself on heaven, establishes virtue and practices the Way. He elevates the Way of heaven as the foremost principle and clarifies earth to uphold it. The *Yijing* says: “Thus he follows heaven and awaits the proper moment to act.” Therefore, when the sage intends to act, he must first observe the waxing and waning of heaven’s Way, then grasp and enact it. When action accords with the mechanism, no strategy is left unfulfilled. The *Yijing* says: “He follows heaven’s timing after heaven.”

Prosperity! The sage models himself on earth and serves heaven, establishes virtue and practices the Way. Dwelling between heaven and earth, virtue and the Dao, none who build great achievements do not rely on the *Five Thieves* to accomplish them. The *Five Thieves* are: the first steals fate, the second steals things, the third steals time, the fourth steals merit, the fifth steals the numinous—these are the arts of emperors, kings, hegemons, and the shifts of power. Thus the sage observes the mechanism and responds to it, measures the season and employs it. Was it not by following the season and responding to the mechanism, driving the *Five Thieves*, that the Grand Duke established the hegemonic canons to overthrow the Yin court and implemented the *Three Winds* to govern the Zhou house?

Therefore the sage establishes his foundation amid the principles of emperors and kings, responds to the mechanism within the shifts of hegemonic power, ordering the state and cultivating the self—here the *Five Thieves* are complete. Then all under heaven follow at the mere rustling of the wind, exhausting their natures and lives without harboring resentment or gratitude. This is called the *thief of the Way*, the *army without form*—alas, what bandit could be greater? When the *Five Thieves* reside in the heart and capture and release lie in the hand, nothing surpasses this for cultivating the self and aiding the world. The *Classic* says: “Those who perceive it prosper”—is this not fitting?

**The Self**
The human heart is the master of the body, the palace of the hun-soul, the repository of the po-soul. When one intends to employ the *Five Thieves*, nothing surpasses the heart. In all undertakings, one must align with the Way of heaven. Thus, though the cosmos is vast, one surveys it as if in the palm of the hand; though the myriad things are numerous, life and death do not depart from the art. Then one realizes that heaven and earth are not to be prized for their remoteness or depth—how much less what lies before the ears and eyes?

**The Mechanism**
The mechanism of killing is the sprout of the rise and fall of two dynasties, the omen of the life and death of ten thousand people. It arises in days when cloud and thunder are not yet harmonious, in times when the dark and yellow flow with blood. When heaven undergoes transformation, dragons emerge in the fields and serpents slither on the roads—this is the mechanism of battle, hence it is said: “Dragons and serpents rise from the land.” When humans undergo transformation, spring enforces autumn’s decrees, rewards the rebellious and punishes the loyal—this is the mechanism of collapse, hence it is said: “Heaven and earth are overturned.” The mechanisms of heaven and humanity arise simultaneously; though they undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, the mechanism of success or failure is already determined.

**Concealment**
The benevolent must be courageous, but the courageous need not be benevolent; the wise can feign foolishness, but the foolish cannot feign wisdom. Thus, when the sage’s time is favorable, he displays his skill and builds his merit; when his time is unfavorable, he appears clumsy and obscures his traces. Thus Zhuge Liang’s preface says: “The Grand Duke at eighty did not lack opportunity—he was merely discerning about his lord.” Alas! The seasons of life’s skill and clumsiness, the circumstances of insight and concealment—these enable one to observe changes, perceive mechanisms, and wield the *Five Thieves*. The reason is this: the sage’s profound insight and far-reaching vision ensure that his actions never miss the mechanism. He observes heaven, assesses people, and acts in accord with the season. Thus the *Yijing* says: “He who knows advance and retreat, survival and demise, and does not lose his correctness—is this not the sage?”

**Stillness**
The nine orifices: in heaven they are the nine stars, on earth the nine provinces, in humans the nine orifices. When the qi of the nine orifices is not upright, it is said to receive evil. Receiving evil, perception becomes biased; with biased perception, one cannot issue mechanisms or observe changes. Thus the urgency of the nine orifices lies in the *Three Essentials*. The Grand Duke said: “The ears, eyes, and mouth.” The ears, eyes, and mouth are the heart’s assistants, the gates and doors of the spirit, the pivot and trigger of wisdom, the fortune and misfortune of humans. Thus, ears without acuity cannot distinguish sounds; eyes without clarity cannot perceive mechanisms; mouths without measure cannot issue commands. If the *Three Essentials* are not refined, one cannot govern the state above or manage the household below—how much less command armies? Suspending human lives, determining the survival or demise of the state, in the space between stillness and motion, one cannot be without affairs—how could one employ them lightly?

**Humanity**
Fire is born from wood; when fire erupts, it burns the wood. States are born from treachery; when treachery deepens, the state falls into chaos. It is like the silkworm that spins its cocoon—when the cocoon is complete, it kills itself. Humans create affairs; when affairs multiply, they harm their lives. None but the utmost sage can cultivate the self and refine conduct, preventing disorder before it sprouts and governing it before it descends into chaos. A tree of ten spans begins with a handful...

A terrace of a hundred *ren* begins with the ground beneath one’s feet; if one does not fear small evils, they will surely grow into great calamities. Alas! When wood does not rub against wood, fire has no way to emerge; when a state has no chaotic governance, treachery has no way to arise. That which has a beginning and an end remains unshaken in right or wrong. Who but the sage can truly know this?

**Peace**
All things steal the essence of Heaven and Earth to take form and grow; humans steal the shapes of all things to use them; all things steal human strength to be cultivated. Each steals from the other, each gains what is fitting, yet none knows it as the transformation of the myriad things. Thus, those who wield the mechanism emulate these three affairs, employing the Dao’s theft to plunder things, while things, too, know the Dao of theft. That which is so arises from valuing the right time and seizing the right moment. Therefore, it is said: eating in accord with the season, the hundred bones are ordered; moving in response to the moment, the ten thousand transformations are at peace. To go against the time or lose the moment is to invite disaster and chaos.

**Spirit**
The Old Master said: "Having accomplished the work, one does not claim possession; acting, one does not rely on it." This is the root of preserving life and establishing virtue. As for the petty person, coveting wealth, they sacrifice themselves for profit; loving fame, they contend with force for merit. They boast of divine signs to seek a name as a spirit, and all things grow jealous of them—thus they surely lose their lives. Seeking gain, they invite loss; this is not spirit. The noble person builds great merit yet does not rely on it, guards against small disasters before they sprout, withdraws the self and advances others, defers to ability and yields to things—all things bear them up, and thus their advantage is not taken. They give rise to spirit and wisdom yet do not contend with things; all things yield to them, and they do not fall behind. Seeking loss, they invite gain—thus they attain the utmost spirit. Therefore, the Old Master said: "Those who act fail; those who grasp lose." Truly, these are his words.

**Sage**

Should a sage appear once in a thousand years, a worthy once in five hundred—such is the measure of their arising by the reckoning of sun and moon, and thus the great and small among men are determined. When a great person emerges in the world, they respond to luminous virtue and establish sagely merit; when a petty person holds sway in their time, they abandon the proper norms and give rise to calamity and disorder. Thus, the Grand Duke spoke to the Earl of the West, knowing the people’s hopes and returning to him; Zhou’s Liu Kun addressed the court from Langye, discerning the signs of the times yet not departing; the mother of Jinling took her own life, foreseeing that a bright lord would surely rise; the mother of Gua did not seek execution, seeing that the Zhao army would surely fail. Thus, the Way of Heaven and the affairs of men may be foreknown by the worthy. If one assists an unfit ruler, one is destroyed along with the nine clans. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* says: “The eldest son leads the army and founds a state to sustain the family; do not employ petty men, for they will surely throw the realm into chaos.”

Before the course of success or failure takes shape, before the pivot of life and death is set in motion, the petty man may see it, while the noble person may know it—thus, seeing is easy and knowing is difficult; seeing concerns the near, while knowing extends to the far. Those who see the pivot act swiftly to seize the moment and gain advantage, yet none preserve their allotted years. Those who know the pivot trace beginnings to their ends and thus surely preserve their nature and life.

The blind excel in hearing, for their spirit does not stray from the ear; the deaf excel in sight, for their heart does not stray from the eye. In hearing, their spirit concentrates on the ear; in seeing, their heart concentrates on the eye. Ear and eye alternate as masters in their use, and when one is employed, its advantage eclipses the other. What the heart governs, no task fails to perfect—this yields a tenfold advantage, how much more so when applied in alternation? Employing this threefold reflection, with single-minded sincerity and a plan attuned to the times, one conceals or reveals, acts or withdraws in response to the pivot. Using this to command an army ensures victory a myriad times over.

The human heart does not stir without cause: life and death arise in response to things. When things move, the heart stirs; when things are still, the heart is stilled. Is not the form of life and death found in things alone?

The eye is the gate of spirit, and spirit is the lord of the heart. Spirit’s comings and goings all roam through the eye. Thus, those who see the pivot all esteem the eye; those who know the pivot all esteem the heart.

The Dao does not bring forth spring for the sake of the myriad things—things feel spring’s *qi* and arise of themselves. Autumn does not bring death for the sake of the myriad things—things feel autumn’s *qi* and perish of themselves. In giving life, it does not rely on its grace nor seek repayment—thus its grace is great. In bringing death, it does not rely on its might nor seek fear—thus its might is great. What is taken and obtained is small; what is not taken yet obtained is great. Therefore, the sage does not take.

Whether a lord of men possesses the Dao or lacks it is the pivot of wealth, the people, order, and disorder. Whether songs and ballads are joyful or mournful is the omen of years of plenty or scarcity. When people fail to examine and perceive, Heaven and Earth send down portents: now five-colored clouds rise, now the seven luminaries alter their courses—all in response to the winds of the state, and thus it is so. When the lord of Song lost virtue, Mars lingered at the Heart; when he repented his faults, it retreated three lodges. Applying the present to the past is as clear as before one’s eyes; using that to illustrate this—does it tax one’s thoughts? Thus, the wise awaken to the beginnings of human affairs, while fools remain benighted until after celestial signs appear.

The Old Master took non-being as the mother of being, stillness as the lord of restlessness. Stillness is the state before primal *qi* divides, its form within primal *qi*—thus it gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. It is like a person of vast stillness whose heart is unperturbed, and thus can give birth to the myriad things under Heaven.

Victory is gradual growth. The Way of Heaven and Earth each grows gradually: Heaven grows the yang, Earth grows the yin. Yin and yang summon one another, alternating day and night as lord and minister, each overcoming the other in turn—thus it is said that yin and yang overcome one another. When founding a state or deploying an army, one must encroach upon the Way of Heaven, just as metal and fire contend, and without contention, neither is subdued. If even Heaven does not oppose this, how much less should men?

The *Book of Changes* says: “The firm and yielding grind against each other and give rise to change.” Since change is not perverse, it is called “following.” In nurturing the body and cultivating one’s nature, one must not act against the times—how much less should the heroes who order the state and assist the age?

The Way of the utmost sage is profound and without action. Without action, there is no pivot; without pivot, there is utmost stillness. The subtlety of pitch pipes and calendars lies in their movement, yet when their substance is emptiness and nothingness, no instrument can be applied. It is like warfare: one does not miss the pivot nor reveal the breach, so that even the wise have no means to control it.

Extraordinary devices belong to yin and yang, thus they give birth to the myriad things—just as the human heart can create the myriad affairs, it is their image. Advancing forward is the image’s form. The eight trigrams, the six jia, the secrets of ghosts and spirits, the arts of firm and yielding restraining one another—all are arrayed clearly before us in their forms.
