**The Inner Canon of Yin Dan**

*Kan* is Heaven’s Yin—where Yang first arises;
*Li* is Earth’s Yang—where Yin first arises.
Yang is not without Yin—all beyond *Kan* is Yin;
Yin is not without Yang—all beyond *Li* is Yang.

Harvest the Yang within Yin,
Fulfill the Yin within Yang,
Nurture the Yang within Yang,
Transform the Yin within Yang.

Thus, above, it follows Heaven;
Below, it conforms to mud;
Within, it aligns with the common man—
All shift their forms, and the *Qian* position is complete!

Purple Court, red lead,
Jade peaks, elixir nectar,
Cinnabar vessel, blazing light—
If the method is unerring, the three peaks are attained!

Observe its subtlety:
Two eights make the *jin* (scale),
Three eights make the *liang* (troy ounce)—
Thus, *jin* and *liang* are balanced!

Still its radiance:
Forty for *wen* (cultivation),
Sixty for *wu* (martial)—
Thus, *wen* and *wu* are complete!

One *chi* of Dragon Spring,
Two horns of Compressed Halter—
Manifesting divine essence.

Amber gathers dust,
Magnetite draws needles—
Responding to divine correspondence.

With lead to gather mercury,
With mercury to gather spirit,
With spirit to preserve form,
With *qi* to draw the medicine,
With medicine to temper the years,
With years to refine the form—
The Dao is exhausted!

Those who attain it must not speak;
Those who speak must not transmit.
If spoken and transmitted,
Disaster befalls the nine ancestors,
And the Three Officials will examine them.

**My Exegesis:**

Heaven is Yang, first arising from *Kan*;
Earth is Yin, first arising from *Li*.
Yang also contains Yin—thus, within *Kan*, Yang is inner, Yin outer;
Yin also contains Yang—thus, within *Li*, Yang is outer, Yin inner.

The secret of Yin Dan lies solely in refining Yang within Yang,
Dissolving the *wei* (outer) Yin,
To become a purely Yang being.
This is the general principle of the method.

Following Heaven requires three *yao* (stages);
Aligning with the common man requires two;
Conforming to mud requires one—
Shifting forms thus transforms Yin into Yang.

Red lead in the first furnace,
Jade nectar as the medicine,
Blazing light as the fire’s timing—
If the method is precise, it discards the old to take the new.

The method of observing subtlety:
Measure by *jin* and *liang*—
*Jin* first, *liang* secondary.
*Jin* is few in number,
*Liang* is many—
Fewness surpasses multitude in subtlety.

The method of stillness:
Warm with *wen* and *wu*—
*Wen* first, *wu* secondary.
*Wen* is not violent,
*Wu*, though violent, is not excessive—
Each adapts to its proper function.

Dragon Spring and Compressed Halter:
One odd, two paired—
Sequentially forming the body.
Paired above, odd below—
Appropriate to the material’s nature.

Amber and magnetite:
Diverse yet of one *qi*—
Mutually aiding in the medicine.

Call Yang with Yang,
Call Yin with Yin—
Resonating in *qi* and breath.

Lead enters the *xiang* (palace),
Wooden *qi* does not disperse—
Thus, "with lead to gather mercury."
Mercury gathers in the body,
Spirit thus does not scatter—
Thus, "with mercury to gather spirit."
Embrace spirit in stillness,
Form thereby endures—
Thus, "with spirit to preserve form."

First gather the medicine,
With *qi* to activate it—
The medicine follows *qi*’s arrival—
Thus, "with *qi* to draw the medicine."
The medicine enters the furnace,
Spirit internally guards—
Thus, "with medicine to temper the years."
Refining the form ceaselessly,
Transforming into golden bones—
Thus, "with years to refine the form."

The Dao reaches its limit here—
No further residue remains.
Only caution in transmission is required!

If transmission is careless,
The disaster to the nine ancestors,
The examination by the Three Officials—
These are not idle words.

I have observed *Lü Xian’s Yellow Furnace Secret* and *Shi An’s Transmission of the Yin Dan Secret*,
Which, though claiming three peaks, are in truth two.
They err in their so-called "Purple Court, red lead,"
Using flowing sand in the cinnabar vessel—
Hence, their claim of three peaks as two.

Now, my exposition of the three is complete,
And the great medicine is exhausted in speech—
For it ought to be kept secret,
Thus, its words are deliberately disordered,
As in *The Parametric Concordance*.
