**Han Feizi – Volume One**
#1 *Chū Jiàn Qín* (初見秦) – **First Meeting with Qin**

A loyal subject who lacks knowledge does not speak wisely, and one who knows but does not speak lacks virtue. For a subject not to possess virtue is deserving of death, and for a subject to speak without propriety is also deserving of death.

Though this be so, I dare to speak all I have heard, awaiting Your Majesty’s judgment on my offense.

I have heard that the realm of Qin is both shadowed and sheltered by Yan and Wei. Yan lies to the north, hence the term *shadowed*. Wei lies to the south, hence the term *sheltered*. Upending Jing and securing Qi, it subjugated Han and formed a coalition, intending to face west and challenge Qin’s strength—this I find laughable.

There are three ways to bring about downfall, yet the world may gain from them. He who knows these three ways may gain the world.

Is this not what I mean?

I have heard that:
One who attacks order with chaos perishes,
One who attacks rectitude with deceit perishes,
One who attacks harmony with rebellion perishes. #1

Now the granaries of the world are not full, and the storehouses of Qin are empty. Its soldiers and people, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, are all willing to die. They prostrate themselves, donning plumes as generals, and march to their deaths without hesitation—even a thousand may not be found, all dying by their words alone.

Blades flash before them, axes gleam behind, yet they retreat not in fear but press onward to death. It is not that the people cannot die; rather, it is that the ruler cannot command it.

When rewards are promised, they are not given; when punishments are decreed, they are not carried out. Rewards and punishments lack credibility, and thus the people do not die.

Now Qin issues commands and enforces rewards and punishments, and those with merit serve those without. It takes men from their parents’ embrace, born without ever having seen an enemy. Yet when they hear of battle, they stamp their feet in readiness, #2
Charge through blades, tread upon burning coals,
And march to their deaths without hesitation—all this is true.

To command death is different from commanding life, yet the people obey. This is because Qin values the resolve to die.

One man’s resolve to die can confront ten, ten can confront a hundred, a hundred can confront a thousand, a thousand can confront ten thousand, and ten thousand can conquer the world.

Now Qin’s territory is vast, stretching thousands of miles, and its armies number in the hundreds of thousands. Qin’s commands, rewards, punishments, terrain, and strategic advantages are unmatched in the world.

With this, Qin could conquer the world and hold it all—yet it is not enough. Thus its arms grow weary, its people exhausted, its stores depleted, its fields barren, its granaries empty, and the neighboring lords do not submit. The title of *Conqueror* is not achieved—this is no accident. Its ministers lack full virtue. #1

I dare to speak of this. Formerly, when Qi broke Jing to the south, shattered Song to the east, subdued Qin to the west, crushed Yan to the north, and dominated Han and Wei in the center, its lands were vast and its armies strong. It won battles, took cities, and issued commands to the world.

Qi’s clear waters of the Ji River and the muddy waters of the He River were sufficient as boundaries, while its grand walls and mighty defenses were enough to seal its borders.

Qi was a land of five defeated states—meaning five conquered nations. #2
Had it not won one battle, Qi would not have stood.

When Le Yi (樂毅) broke Qi at the Ji River’s west, this proves that war is the life or death of a great state.

Moreover, I have heard that:
To erase the traces of ruin without uprooting its roots is to leave a neighbor with calamity, and calamity will then persist.

This means that the remnants of defeat, if left unchecked, will breed future ruin. It is a warning to Qin: let Qi serve as a lesson.

When Qin fought with Jing’s men, it shattered Jing, raided Ying, and seized Dongting, Wuhu, and Jiangnan. The Jing king and his ministers fled in disarray, submitting to Chen in the east.

At that moment, if Qin had pursued Jing with its armies, Jing would have been utterly vanquished. Had Jing been utterly vanquished, the people would have had enough to covet, and the lands would have been fully exploited.

To the east, it could have weakened Qi and Yan, while in the center, it could have dominated the Three Jin. #3
Thus, with one decisive stroke, the title of *Conqueror* could have been achieved, and the neighboring lords could have been made to bow in homage.

Yet its ministers did not act, and Qin withdrew its armies. Instead, it made peace with the criminals of Jing, allowing them to restore their fallen kingdom, gather their scattered people, reinstate their ancestral rites, and rebuild their temples. It permitted them to rally the world against Qin, facing west once more to challenge its might—this is surely the loss of one path to *Conqueror*’s dominion.

Again, the world allied against Zhou and marched upon Hua Xia’s borders. The Great King issued a decree to break them, and the armies reached the gates of Liang. Had Liang been besieged for several decades, it would have fallen, and the fall of Liang would have meant the rise of Wei. The rise of Wei would have severed the ambitions of the Three Jin, and the severing of their ambitions would have left Zhao in peril. With Zhao in peril, Jing would hesitate and doubt, while to the east, Qi and Yan would be weakened, and in the center, the Three Jin would be dominated.

Thus, with one decisive stroke, the title of *Conqueror* could have been achieved, and the neighboring lords could have been made to bow in homage.

Yet its ministers did not act, and Qin withdrew its armies. Instead, it made peace with Wei, allowing them to restore their fallen kingdom, gather their scattered people, reinstate their ancestral rites, and rebuild their temples. It permitted them to rally the world against Qin—[facing west once more to challenge its might]. #3

「This is indeed the second way of losing the *Dao/Way* of the Conqueror. Earlier, when Lord Ráng governed Qin, he sought to accomplish the achievements of two states with the strength of just one. Lord Ráng established private domains for himself, scheming against Qin, and thus his words were not sincere when he spoke of two states. Therefore, the soldiers remained exposed for their entire lives, while the people within grew weary and exhausted, and the title of *Conqueror* was never realized—this is indeed the third way of losing the *Dao/Way* of the Conqueror.

The state of Zhao is a central realm, inhabited by a mixed populace. Zhao occupies Handan, to the south of Yan, to the west of Qi, to the north of Wei, and to the east of Han; hence, it is called *central*. It encompasses the people of four states, hence *mixed*. Its subjects are light-hearted and difficult to command. Orders are not enforced, rewards and punishments lack credibility, and its terrain is not advantageous. The rulers cannot fully utilize their people’s strength, and thus it is destined to perish. Yet Zhao did not fear the stirrings of rebellion, and mustered all its soldiers and civilians to fight at Changping, contending for Han’s Shangdang region. The Great King then shattered them, capturing Wū’ān. At that time, Zhao’s nobles and commoners were divided, and the high and low did not trust one another. Thus, Handan was unguarded, and if taken, the Great King would have seized the Yellow River’s eastern banks and left his forces there, then withdrawn westward to attack Xiūwǔ, crossing the Huá Pass and taking Shangdang. The forty-six counties of Dai and the seventy of Shangdang—without a single battle, without exhausting a single soldier or civilian—would all belong to Qin. Shangdang and Dai would have fallen to Qin without struggle, while Dongyang and the lands beyond the Hé River would have reverted to Qi without a fight, and Zhōngshān and the territories north of Hùzhuō would have belonged to Yan without resistance. Thus, Zhao’s defeat would have led to Han’s collapse, and with Han gone, Jing and Wei could not stand alone. Jing and Wei’s collapse would have meant the destruction of Han, the weakening of Wei, and the subjugation of Jing, while to the east, Qi and Yan would be weakened, and the Great King would have opened the White Horse Pass to flood Wei with his armies—resulting in the Three Jin’s annihilation and the defeat of their allies. The Great King could have remained passive, and the world would have submitted in awe; the title of *Conqueror* would have been achieved. Yet its ministers did not act, and Qin withdrew its forces, instead making peace with Zhao.

With the Great King’s wisdom and Qin’s formidable armies, to abandon the *Dao/Way* of the Conqueror and fail to secure even a portion of the land is to invite deceit from a dying state—this is the folly of the ministers. Moreover, if Zhao were to perish but does not, and if Qin were to become the Conqueror but does not, the world would already measure Qin’s ministers as incompetent. Now, Qin has again mustered its soldiers to attack Handan, yet cannot take it. Abandoning armor, weapons, and crossbows, they retreat in disarray, and the world has already measured Qin’s strength three times. Internally, the world sees our ministers’ incompetence, while externally, it witnesses the limits of our military power.

From this, I believe the world’s submission is nearly impossible. Why? Because the lords know that Qin’s armies exhaust the people, and thus their loyalty grows ever firmer. The Great King must consider this carefully.

Furthermore, I have heard it said: *"To tremble and fear, to be cautious each day—if one steadfastly follows the Dao, the world can be won."* How do I know this is true? In the past, King Zhou, as sovereign of the world, led his armies to drink from the Qí River on the left and the Yán River on the right. The waters of Qí dried up, and those of Yán did not flow, yet he still sought to challenge King Wǔ of the Zhou. King Wǔ, with his three thousand unarmored warriors, fought for one day and shattered Zhou’s realm, capturing his person and seizing his lands and people—none in the world dared to resist.

Zhībó led the combined forces of three states to attack Zhao’s Shèngzhǔ at Jìnyáng. He dammed the waters and flooded the city for three months, and the walls were nearly breached. Shèngzhǔ consulted the tortoise-shell divination and observed auspicious signs: *"Which state can be subdued?"* He then sent his minister Zhāng Mèngtán to secretly go among the enemy ranks and reveal Zhībó’s pact. With the help of two states, he attacked Zhībó, captured him, and restored Zhao’s original dominion.

Now, Qin’s lands are vast, stretching thousands of miles, with renowned armies numbering tens and hundreds of millions. Its decrees, rewards, punishments, and strategic advantages surpass all others in the world. With this, Qin could conquer the world—yet the ministers fail to break the world’s submission, to topple Zhao, to destroy Han, to subjugate Jing and Wei, and to win the favor of Qi and Yan, thereby achieving the title of *Conqueror* and making the neighboring lords bow in homage.

If the Great King truly heeds my counsel, yet still fails to break the world’s submission, to topple Zhao, to destroy Han, to subjugate Jing and Wei, or to win the favor of Qi and Yan—if the title of *Conqueror* is not achieved and the neighboring lords do not bow in homage—then I beg the Great King to behead me and display my corpse as a warning to the state, an example of a minister whose loyalty did not extend to its fullest.

**The Second Matter: Preserving Han**
Han has served Qin for over thirty years, offering its strength as a shield when needed and its wealth as a humble offering when not. It sends tribute to supply Qin’s demands, like a mat placed beneath a guest’s feet. Qin has now dispatched its elite troops to seize Han’s lands, and the resentment of the world will follow, with all the glory accruing to mighty Qin.

Moreover, Han’s contributions in tribute and service are no different from those of the counties and prefectures. Yet I have secretly heard the plans of the noble ministers: they intend to raise armies and attack Han. Zhao has already gathered its soldiers and trained its levies, desiring to add to the world’s armies—like a brooch or a pendant, linking and securing them. If Qin is not weakened, the lords will surely destroy their ancestral temples and turn westward to act against Qin, not a strategy for a single day.»

Now that Qin abandons Zhao’s troubles and instead repels Han as its own subject, the world will clearly recognize Zhao’s strategy. If Han becomes a subject of Qin, and Qin still annihilates it, then the lords will unite with Zhao to attack Qin, and the plan will succeed.

Han is a small state, yet it has endured four assaults from the world’s armies, with its ruler humiliated and its subjects suffering, all sharing in prolonged grief. It has fortified its defenses, guarded against powerful enemies, stockpiled provisions, and built city walls to secure its borders. If Qin attacks Han and cannot conquer it within a year, or even seizes just one city and withdraws, then Qin’s authority will be diminished in the eyes of the world, and the world’s armies will crush Qin’s forces.

If Han rebels, then Wei will respond in support. Zhao will rely on Qi as its base—like a mountain ridge. In this way, with Han and Wei as resources and Qi as an ally to solidify their ranks, Zhao will challenge Qin’s might, bringing fortune to Zhao and disaster to Qin.

If Qin advances but fails to take Zhao, and retreats yet cannot conquer Han, then its elite troops will be exhausted from field battles, its burdened forces will weary from internal campaigns, and those who supply provisions will be drained. Then, united with the weak and suffering, it will oppose the combined armies of the two great states—this is not the way to destroy Zhao.

If Qin follows the noble ministers’ plan—meaning, to apply their same strategy—then Qin will surely become the world’s military target. If it cannot advance or retreat effectively, it will be like a hostage for all.

Your Majesty, even if you exhaust your resources like gold and stone, and summon all your soldiers, the day when Qin conquers all under heaven will not yet come. Now, this humble servant’s foolish plan: send envoys to Jing, lavish gifts upon the officials who manage the affairs of Han, and make clear to Zhao the reasons for its deception of Qin. Offer Wei as a hostage to ease Zhao’s suspicions, then attack Zhao while it is preoccupied. Even if Zhao unites with Qi, it will not be a grave threat. Once the affairs of these two states are settled, Han can be secured by written agreement. This single move will make the fate of both states certain, and Jing and Wei will surely submit themselves.

Thus it is said: *"War is a dire instrument. Its use must be carefully considered."* To oppose Zhao with Qin’s strength, balanced by the support of Qi, yet now to betray Han without a means to secure Jing and Wei’s loyalty, is perilous. If Qin loses a single battle, then disaster will befall. Strategy is the means to resolve affairs; it must be examined with care. The strength or weakness of Han and Qin lies within this year alone.

Moreover, Zhao has long conspired with the other lords. If Qin acts and thereby weakens itself among the lords, it is a dangerous matter. To devise a plan that makes the lords harbor hostile intentions toward Qin is most perilous. The two states’ (Han and Wei) plight is not the way to grow stronger among the lords.

I humbly hope Your Majesty will carefully reconsider this matter. Once a campaign is launched and its allies hear of it, there will be no turning back. By Your Majesty’s decree, based on the book submitted by Han’s envoys, which states that Han cannot be taken immediately, this servant greatly disagrees. Qin’s possession of Han is like a man with a fatal illness in his vitals—if left untreated, it will fester and spread. If one remains in damp ground, letting the sickness linger without treatment, it will worsen until it erupts in a fatal outbreak.

If the illness is exposed to cold, it will suddenly flare up and worsen—this is certain. This illustrates that even though Qin bestows great favors upon Han, should there be an urgent matter, Han’s rebellious heart will surely reveal itself. Though Han submits to Qin, it has never ceased to be a source of trouble for Qin. Now, if there is a sudden matter requiring retaliation, Han cannot be trusted.

Qin and Zhao are at odds, Jing and Su are urging Qi, but it is unclear how this will unfold. In my view, the alliance between Qi and Zhao may not necessarily be severed by Jing and Su. If it is not severed, then this would mean attacking Zhao while responding to the two armies of Qi. Han does not submit to Qin out of righteousness, but out of coercion. Now, if Qin focuses solely on Qi and Zhao, then Han’s rebellious heart will surely erupt as a fatal illness in Qin’s vitals.

Han is plotting with Jing, and if the other lords respond to it, then Qin will again face the calamity of the Hangu Pass. Though Jing’s envoys may not come solely to preserve Han, they may prioritize their own interests over Han. Their arguments and persuasive rhetoric adorn falsehoods and deceptive schemes, aiming to lure Qin into advantage while observing Han’s best interests to gauge Your Majesty’s intentions. They seek to exploit any opportunity to enter and persuade, hoping to secure Han’s advantage.

The bond between Qin and Han is indeed close, yet Jing’s envoys are given greater weight by the two states. This is their own strategic advantage. I observe Jing’s envoys and their excessive flattery and polished rhetoric; Your Majesty must not be swayed by their deceitful arguments and overlook their treacherous intentions.

If Qin mobilizes troops without declaring their target, then Han’s officials will surely calculate how to deal with Qin, fearing they might be the next to be attacked. I therefore request permission to go and meet the Han king, bring him here, and have Your Majesty see him. Once he is inside, do not send him back, but gradually summon his ministers of state to bargain with the Han people. Then Han can be deeply humiliated.

If Your Majesty then orders Xiangwu to dispatch the soldiers from the Eastern Command to threaten the Han border without naming their destination, the Qi people will fear and follow Jing’s plan. This would mean that our troops have not even left before Han is weakened by intimidation and Qi is forced to submit through righteous persuasion.

When the other lords hear of this, Zhao will be broken in spirit, Jing will be in doubt, and there will surely be loyal strategies. If Jing does not act, then Wei is no threat, and the other lords can be consumed one by one, while Zhao can be made to stand as our enemy.

I humbly hope Your Majesty will carefully consider this servant’s humble plan and not dismiss it lightly.

Qin thus sent this servant to Han. Li Si went to deliver the decree to the Han king but was not granted an audience. He therefore submitted a letter, which read:

In the past, Qin and Han united in purpose and strength, never encroaching upon one another, and no one dared to violate this. Such has been the case for several generations. In earlier times, the Five Lords once jointly attacked Han, and Qin sent troops to rescue it. Though Han occupied the central lands, its territory could not fill a thousand *li*, yet it was able to secure its position among the lords of the world and ensure the safety of its king and ministers through the generations—all because of Qin’s enduring support.

Previously, the Five Lords jointly attacked Qin, and Han led the way, forming a vanguard to confront Qin’s army at the pass. The other lords’ forces were exhausted and desperate, with no recourse, and their campaign ultimately failed. Du Cang, Qin’s prime minister, raised an army and dispatched generals to retaliate against the world’s resentment, but failed to attack Jing. The prime minister of Jing, concerned by this, said: *"Han regards Qin’s actions as unjust and has allied with Qin as brothers to afflict the world. Yet now it has betrayed Qin, leading the vanguard to attack the pass. Han occupies the central lands, shifting its allegiance unpredictably. The other lords have collectively ceded ten Han cities to appease Qin and withdraw their forces. Since then, Han’s territory has been diminished, its army weakened, and it remains so to this day.*

*The reason for this is that Han heeded the empty words of deceitful ministers, failing to weigh the truth of the situation. Thus, even after executing those treacherous ministers, Han could not regain its former strength.*

*Now Zhao wants to gather its soldiers and troops, using Qin as its pretext, and sends envoys to borrow passage, claiming they intend to attack Qin. But their true intent must be to strike Han first and then Qin. Moreover, I have heard this saying: 'When the lips are gone, the teeth will grow cold.' Qin and Han cannot escape shared anxiety, and their mutual vulnerability is evident.*

*Wei wants to send troops to attack Han, and Qin has dispatched envoys to escort Han’s envoys. Now that Qin’s king has sent this servant here and he is not granted an audience, I fear that Your Majesty’s attendants may follow the old tactics of treacherous ministers, causing Han to again face the loss of its lands. As this servant is not granted an audience, I request permission to return and report. If Qin and Han’s alliance is severed, this servant’s mission will have failed.*

*This servant came to serve Qin’s king’s pleasure and offer convenient strategies. How could it be that Your Majesty would treat this lowly servant with such hostility? I wish only to be granted an audience, present my humble plans, and then submit to punishment if Your Majesty so desires. If Your Majesty has any regard for this servant’s words, I beg that you consider them carefully.*

*If Your Majesty executes this servant in Han, then the Han king will not be able to grow stronger. If Your Majesty does not heed this servant’s advice, then disaster will surely befall. If Qin mobilizes troops without delay, then Han’s state and its people will be in peril. If this servant is exposed in Han’s capital, then even if Your Majesty wishes to examine this lowly servant’s loyal and foolish plans, it will be too late. The borders will be ravaged, the state will be firmly defended, and the sound of battle will be heard—yet Your Majesty’s use of this servant’s plan will come too late.*

*Moreover, Han’s military strength in the world is known. Now it has again betrayed the mighty Qin. If it abandons its cities and loses its armies, then the enemy that turns its back upon it will surely attack its cities. When the cities are all lost, the troops will scatter, and when the troops scatter, there will be no army left. If the cities are firmly defended, then Qin will surely raise troops to besiege the Han king’s capital. If the roads are blocked, then the enemy will surely devise schemes to attack, and their situation will be unsalvageable. Your attendants’ plans will not be used, and I beg Your Majesty to carefully reconsider.*

*If any of this servant’s words do not align with the facts, I hope the Han king will grant me an audience to fully explain my reasoning before I am punished by the law. Qin’s king is unable to eat or enjoy his leisure, his thoughts fixed solely on attacking Zhao. He has sent this servant to speak, hoping for an audience so that we may urgently devise plans together."*

If Your Majesty does not grant this servant an audience, then the fate of the state of Han remains uncertain. Qin will surely abandon Zhao’s troubles and redirect its forces against Han. I beg Your Majesty to reconsider and grant me a reply.

**Difficulties of Speech (Third Section)**
This servant is not one who finds speech difficult, but the reason I find it difficult is this: when words flow smoothly and are polished like flowing water, rich and glossy in their eloquence, they are seen as empty and insubstantial. When speech is cautious and comparisons are disjointed, it is seen as clumsy and lacking coherence. When words are sincere and earnest, yet rigid and overly guarded, they are seen as awkward and unrefined. When speech is verbose and excessive, piling up comparisons and analogies, it is seen as hollow and useless. When arguments are subtle and concise, direct yet unadorned, they are seen as shallow and unpersuasive. When one eagerly probes the emotions of those in power, seeking to flatter and ingratiate, it is seen as slanderous and unprincipled. When speech is grand and far-reaching, profound yet inscrutable, it is seen as boastful and impractical. When one speaks of trivial household matters, enumerating petty details, it is seen as vulgar. When speech aligns with current trends, using conventional language without contradiction, it is seen as craven and sycophantic. When speech deviates from common usage, appearing strange and erratic, it is seen as fabrications. When one is quick-witted and eloquent, adorned with rhetorical flourishes, it is seen as mere sophistry. When one rejects literary refinement and speaks only of innate nature, it is seen as crude. When one cites poetry and classics, invoking ancient precedents, it is seen as mere recitation—recitation of old tales. These are the reasons why this servant finds speech so difficult and faces grave peril in doing so.

Thus, even if one’s reasoning is correct, it may not be heeded. Even if one’s principles are sound, they may not be applied. If Your Majesty remains unconvinced by this, then in minor matters, you may dismiss it as slanderous defamation, and in grave matters, you may face calamity, disaster, or even death. Hence, Ziyu was a master strategist yet was executed by Wu; Confucius was eloquent yet was besieged at Kuang; Guan Zhong was truly virtuous yet was imprisoned by Lu. Were these three not virtuous? Yet their rulers were unenlightened.

In ancient times, Tang was supremely virtuous, and Yi Yin was supremely wise. Yet even when the supremely wise spoke to the supremely virtuous, Tang required seventy attempts before accepting his counsel, and only then did he recognize Yi Yin’s worth and employ him as a humble cook. Thus, even when the supremely wise speaks to the supremely virtuous, there is no guarantee of immediate acceptance—such was Yi Yin’s case with Tang. When wisdom speaks to folly, it will surely not be heard—such was King Wen’s case with King Zhou. Hence, King Wen was imprisoned by Zhou, Yi Hu was flayed, Gui Hu was skinned alive, Bi Gan’s heart was cut out, Mei Bo was minced, Ji Wu was bound, and Cao Jiu fled to Chen. Bo Li Zi begged for his life, Fu Yao sold himself as a laborer, and was later hired as a servant—hence, "sold." Sun Bin was mutilated in Wei, Wu Qi wept bitterly at the gates of Lu, lamenting the loss of the Western River to Qin, and was ultimately dismembered in Chu. Gongzuo Zuo spoke treasonously against his own state, and Gongsun Yang fled to Qin. Guan Longfeng was beheaded, Chang Hong was torn apart—*[missing character]* split, pronounced *jie*. Yin Zhi was thrown into a pit of thorns. Sima Ziqian drowned in the Yangtze, Tian Ming was executed without cause, and Mo Zi’s followers were killed. Mozi himself and Ximen Bao died by others’ hands without resistance, Dong An died and was displayed in the market, Zai Yu was not spared by Tian Chang, and Fan Sui was broken in Wei. These ten or so men were all virtuous, loyal, and skilled in the Dao, yet they met with tyrannical and deluded rulers and died. Thus, even the wise and virtuous cannot escape death or humiliation. This is because the foolish are difficult to persuade, and thus the wise refrain from speaking.

Moreover, profound truths may offend the ears and contradict the heart—only the wise and virtuous can truly listen. I beg Your Majesty to carefully consider this.

**Loved Ministers (Fourth Section)**
When ministers are overly favored, their lives are in peril. When their authority threatens the sovereign, their lives are in peril. When ministers are too powerful, they risk usurping the throne. When the sovereign’s consorts are without distinction, the legitimate heir is endangered. When brothers do not submit to the ruler, the state is imperiled. I have heard that even a ruler of a thousand chariots, if unprepared, will have a minister of a hundred chariots at his side, ready to transfer the people’s allegiance and topple the state. A ruler of ten thousand chariots, if unprepared, will have a minister of a thousand chariots in his household, ready to undermine his authority and overthrow the state. Thus, when treacherous ministers flourish, the ruler’s path to governance declines and collapses. Therefore, the rise of powerful vassals is the ruin of the Son of Heaven, and the wealth of ministers leads to the downfall of the sovereign.

Generals and ministers who control the ruler and dominate the state are what rulers must exclude and distance themselves from. The four greatest dangers—a ruler’s wealth, his exalted status, his heavy authority, and his supreme influence—should not be sought from others or begged for; they must be secured through wise governance. Hence, if a ruler cannot harness his wealth, he will inevitably rely on others. This is what rulers must recognize.

In the past, the fall of Shang and the decline of Zhou both stemmed from the rise of powerful vassals—Zhou’s Duke Wen of Jin and Qin’s Duke Xian of Zhou. When Jin divided, it gave rise to Zhao, Wei, and Han. When Qi seized power, Chen Heng assassinated Duke Jian. All these were due to the excessive wealth of ministers. The regicides of Yan and Song were all of this kind. Thus, comparing the past to Shang and Zhou, and the present to Yan and Song, none escape this fate. Therefore, enlightened rulers must govern their ministers strictly by law, ensuring that regardless of rank, all are equal under the law.

「Test their loyalty by making them modest, meaning to bestow meager rewards and allowances. If ministers are impoverished, they are easily controlled.

Hence, do not pardon capital crimes, nor commute punishments. To pardon capital crimes and commute punishments is called *威淫* (Wei-yin, i.e., **the tyranny of lenient authority**). *淫* (Yin) means **excessive or scattered**. The ancestral altars and fields will then be in peril, and the state’s authority will become **one-sided**. When the ruler’s authority is scattered, the ministers’ authority grows—hence the term *偏* (pien, **one-sided**).

Therefore, even if great ministers receive vast stipends, they must not rely on their influence to dominate the marketplace. The marketplace is where the people gather; one fears they may exploit the crowd and harbor ambitions.

Though factions may be numerous, they must not control the soldiers. Hence, officials must not have private audiences in the state, nor private dealings in the military. Their treasuries must not lend money to their families, lest they accumulate **private wealth** (福, *fu*).

This is how enlightened rulers prevent their ministers from harboring **deviant intentions** (邪, *hsieh*).

Hence, they must not permit **four private allegiances** (四从, *ssu-tsung*), and neighboring states are considered **private dealings** (私交, *ssu-chiao*). They must not transport **unconventional troops** (奇兵, *ch’i-ping*), nor send them without proper authorization (非传非遽, *fei-ch’uan-fei-chu*). Transporting unconventional troops is punishable by death, with no reprieve.

This is how enlightened rulers prepare for **unforeseen contingencies** (不虞, *pu-yu*).

**Chapter Five on the Dao/Way**
The Dao/Way is the **origin of all things** (始, *shih*), for all things arise from the Dao/Way, hence it is called *始* (origin). It is the **standard for right and wrong** (是非之纪, *shih-fei-chih-chih*), for right and wrong are revealed through the Dao/Way, hence it is called *纪* (standard).

Thus, enlightened rulers uphold the origin to know the **source of all things** (万物之源, *wan-wu-chih-yuan*), and if they grasp the origin, they can fathom its source. They govern by the standard to discern the **beginning of success and failure** (善败之端, *shan-pai-chih-tuan*), and if they grasp the standard, they can foresee its outcome.

Hence, they maintain **emptiness and tranquility** (虚静, *hsü-ching*) to await the **mandate** (令, *ling*), for the mandate’s name comes from itself, and its affairs are self-defined. Emptiness reveals the **true nature of things** (实之情, *shih-chih-ching*), and tranquility discerns the **rightness of movement** (动者正, *tung-chih-cheng*).

Those who speak define their own **names** (名, *ming*), and those who act manifest their own **forms** (形, *hsing*). When form and name align, the ruler has no need for action, and all returns to its **natural disposition** (情, *ching*).

Hence it is said:
*"Do not reveal your desires."* If the ruler reveals his desires, the ministers will **engrave and embellish** (雕琢, *tiao-chu*) to match them.
The ministers, in turn, **engrave and embellish** (雕琢) their desires to conform to the ruler’s.

*"Do not reveal your intentions."* If the ruler reveals his intentions, the ministers will **display their own differences** (表异, *piao-i*). The ministers, in turn, **display their own differences** to conform to the ruler’s intentions.

Hence it is said:
*"Remove your preferences and your aversions; then the ministers will reveal their true nature."* Remove your old ways and your wisdom; then the ministers will **prepare themselves naturally**.

If preferences and aversions are not evident, the ministers have nothing to **imitate** (效, *hsiao*), and thus they **refrain and prepare themselves naturally** (戒而自备, *chieh-erh-tsu-pei*).

Hence, one who has wisdom but does not **deliberate** (虑, *lü*), allows all things to know their proper place. One who has virtue but does not **claim merit** (贤, *hsien*), observes the ministers’ **natural inclinations** (所因, *suo-yin*). One who has courage but does not **act in anger** (怒, *nü*), enables the ministers to **fulfill their martial strength** (尽其武, *chin-chih-wu*).

Therefore, to **remove wisdom** (去智, *chü-chih*) is to gain **clarity** (明, *ming*), for when the ruler removes his wisdom, the ministers’ wisdom naturally becomes clear. To **remove virtue** (去贤, *chü-hsien*) is to achieve **meritorious deeds** (功, *kung*), for when the ruler removes his virtue, the ministers’ actions naturally bear merit. To **remove courage** (去勇, *chü-yung*) is to foster **strength** (强, *chiang*), for when the ruler removes his courage, the ministers’ martial prowess naturally becomes strong.

When ministers uphold their duties and officials maintain their roles, the ruler **assigns tasks according to their abilities** (因能而使之, *in-neng-erh-shih-chih*), which is called *习常* (**establishing routine**).

Hence it is said:
*"Silent as if without position, yet floating as if nowhere can be found."* The enlightened ruler **acts without interference** (无为, *wu-wei*), while the ministers **stand in awe below** (竦惧, *sung-chü*).

The Dao/Way of the enlightened ruler is to **utilize ministers’ wisdom** (智者尽其虑, *chih-chih-chin-chih-lü*), yet the ruler **decides affairs accordingly** (因而断事, *chin-erh-tuan-shih*), so the ruler is **not constrained by wisdom** (穷於智, *chüng-yu-chih*). By employing the ministers’ wisdom, wisdom is **not exhausted**.

To **employ virtuous ministers according to their talents** (贤者勑其材, *hsien-chih-ch’ü-chih-ts’ai*), and the ruler **assigns them accordingly** (因而任之, *chin-erh-jen-chih*), so the ruler is **not constrained by ability** (穷於能, *chüng-yu-neng*). When there are meritorious deeds, the ruler **recognizes their virtue** (有其贤, *yü-chih-hsien*), and when there are faults, the ministers **bear responsibility for their crimes** (任其罪, *jen-chih-tsoi*), so the ruler is **not constrained by reputation** (穷於名, *chüng-yu-ming*).

Hence, though the ruler may not be virtuous, he is the **model for virtuous ministers** (贤者师, *hsien-chih-shih*). Though he may not be wise, he is the **arbiter for wise ministers** (智者正, *chih-chih-cheng*).

The ministers **bear the labor**, while the ruler **claims the success**. The ruler takes the ministers’ labor and **attributes it as his own success** (以为己功, *yü-wei-chih-kung*). This is called the **principle of the sagacious ruler** (贤主之经, *hsien-chiu-chih-ching*), for *经* (ching) means **constant law**.

The Dao/Way lies in what **cannot be seen**. The ruler’s Dao/Way must ensure that ministers **cannot be seen** (不可见, *pu-chien*). Authority must be **unfathomable** (不可知, *pu-chih*).

With emptiness and tranquility, there is no need for action, yet **flaws are revealed in darkness**. To **see without seeing**, to **hear without hearing**, to **know without knowing** (见而不见，闻而不闻，知而不知, *chien-erh-pu-chien, wen-erh-pu-wen, chih-erh-pu-chih*), yet to **know their words to act accordingly** (知其言以往, *chih-chih-yen-yi-wang*), without altering or amending, to **verify and cross-check** (参合阅, *ts’an-ho-yüeh*).

When an office has but one person, **do not allow them to communicate freely**; then all matters will be **fully revealed**. Each must **guard their duties** (守职, *shou-chih*), and **not be permitted to cross-interfere** (相通, *hsiao-t’ung). If their **intentions are mutually suspected** (情既相猜, *ching-chih-hsiao-tsoi), they will **exhaust themselves naturally** (自尽矣, *tsu-chin-yi).

They must **conceal their traces** (函掩其迹, *han-yen-chih-chih*), **hide their beginnings** (匿其端, *ni-chih-tuan*), lest the ministers **cannot forgive** (不能原, *pu-neng-yuan*). They must **remove their wisdom** (去其智, *chü-chih-chih*), **sever their abilities** (绝其能, *chüeh-chih-neng*), lest the ministers **cannot discern** (不能意, *pu-neng-i).*

They must **preserve the means by which they act** (保吾所以往, *pao-wu-sui-yi-wang*), and **cross-check their consistency** (稽同之, *chi-tung-chih*). They must **carefully hold their authority** (谨执其柄, *chin-chih-chih-ping*) and **firmly grasp it** (固握之, *ku-wo-chih*).

They must **sever all hopes of ability** (绝其能望, *chüeh-chih-neng-wang*), **shatter all intentions** (破其意, *po-chih-i*), lest people **desire to act** (人欲之, *jen-yü-chih). If the ruler **holds authority firmly** (执柄固, *chih-ping-ku), then all ministers’ intentions and hopes are **severed**.

If the ruler **does not secure his defenses** (不谨其闭, *pu-chin-chih-pih), nor **fortify his gates** (不固其门, *pu-ku-chih-men*), then **the usurping tiger will linger** (虎乃将存, *hü-nai-chiang-ch’ün*). If authority is not firmly held, the **tiger of usurpation** (篡国之虎, *chuan-kuo-chih-hü*) will **take root**.

If the ruler **does not guard his affairs** (不慎其事, *pu-shen-chih-shih*), nor **conceal his intentions** (不掩其情, *pu-yen-chih-ching*), then **the regicidal thief will arise** (贼乃将生, *chih-nai-chiang-sheng*). The thief **kills his sovereign** (弒其主, *chi-chih-chiu*) and **seizes his position** (代其所, *tai-chih-suo*). Since all people **will side with the thief** (莫不与, *mu-pu-yü*), he is called *虎* (**the tiger**).

He lurks beside his sovereign, acting as a **treacherous minister** (奸臣, *chien-chih*), and **hears his sovereign’s weaknesses** (闻其主之忒, *wen-chih-chiu-chih-t’ieh*), hence he is called *贼* (**the thief**).

To **scatter his faction** (散其党, *san-chih-t’ang*), **collect his remnants** (收其余, *shou-chih-yü*), **seal his gates** (闭其门, *pi-chih-men*), and **strip his support** (夺其辅, *t’o-chih-fu*), then the state will have **no tiger**.

To be **vast beyond measure** (不可量, *pu-ku-liang*), **profound beyond reckoning** (不可测, *pu-ku-ts’o*), yet to **unify laws and names** (同合刑名, *tung-ho-hsing-ming*), **examine and verify legal standards** (审验法式, *shen-yen-fa-shih*), and **punish those who act arbitrarily** (擅为者诛, *shan-wei-chih-chu), then the state will have **no thief**.

Thus, the sovereign has **five obstructions** (五壅, *wu-yen):
1. Ministers **blocking the sovereign** (臣闭其主, *chih-pi-chih-chiu*) is an obstruction.
2. Ministers **controlling wealth and resources** (臣制财利, *chih-chih-ts’ai-li*) is an obstruction.
3. Ministers **issuing orders unilaterally** (臣擅行令, *chih-shan-hsing-ling*) is an obstruction.
4. Ministers **acting in righteousness on their own** (臣得行义, *chih-têh-hsing-i*) is an obstruction.
5. Ministers **raising followers independently** (臣得树人, *chih-têh-shu-jen*) is an obstruction.

When ministers **block the sovereign**, the sovereign **loses his position** (失位, *shih-wei*).
When ministers **control wealth and resources**, the sovereign **loses his virtue/power** (失德, *shih-tê*).
When ministers **issue orders unilaterally**, the sovereign **loses his authority** (失制, *shih-chih*).
When ministers **act in righteousness on their own**, the sovereign **loses his reputation** (失名, *shih-ming*).
When ministers **raise followers independently**, the sovereign **loses his faction** (失党, *shih-t’ang*).

This is how the sovereign **must hold exclusive authority** (独擅, *tu-shên*), and not allow ministers to **seize control** (得操, *têh-ts’ao).

The sovereign’s Dao/Way is to **hold tranquility and withdrawal as treasures** (静退以为宝, *ching-t’ui-yü-wei-pao*). By **not meddling in affairs** (不自操事, *pu-tsu-ts’ao-shih*), he knows **what is clumsy and what is skillful** (拙与巧, *chüo-yü-chiao*). By **not calculating his own deliberations** (不自计虑, *pu-tsu-chih-lü*), he knows **what brings fortune and what brings blame** (福与咎, *fu-yü-chiu).

Hence, he **does not speak yet responds appropriately** (不言而善应, *pu-yen-erh-shan-ying*), **does not make agreements yet increases harmony** (不约而善增, *pu-yüeh-erh-shan-tsêng*). If his words are already **responded to**, he **holds the contract** (执其契, *chih-chih-ch’ih*). If his affairs are already **augmented** (增, *tsêng*), he **seizes the symbol of authority** (操其符, *ts’ao-chih-fu*).

The **seal and contract** are where **authority and punishment** converge. Thus, the ministers present their words, and the sovereign, by his words, entrusts them with affairs, demanding their fulfillment through deeds. When deeds match the entrusted affairs and the affairs match the spoken words, he grants **rewards**. When deeds do not match the entrusted affairs and the affairs do not match the spoken words, he imposes **punishment**. The **Dao/Way of a sage sovereign** is that ministers do not present their words yet still fulfill them appropriately.

Hence, the sage sovereign’s **bestowal of rewards** is **warm like timely rain**, and the people benefit from its **blessings**. His **infliction of punishments** is **feared like thunder and lightning**, so much so that even the **divine and holy** cannot **dissolve** it. Therefore, a sage sovereign **never withholds rewards** nor **pardons punishments**. Withholding rewards makes **meritorious ministers abandon their achievements**, while pardoning crimes encourages **wicked men to persist in evil**. Hence, if there is **true merit**, even those **distant and lowly** must be rewarded; if there is **true fault**, even those **close and beloved** must be punished. Punishing those close and beloved ensures that the distant and lowly do not **grow slack**, while the close and beloved do not **become arrogant**.

**Han Feizi (卷之一竟)**

The **Han Feizi** states: *"Those who attack the order with disorder perish."* #1

---

**Hanzi Xu (韓子序)**

Han Fei was one of the **princely sons of the Han state**. He delighted in the **school of penal law and merit-based governance**, yet rooted his principles in **Huang-Lao** thought. Though **tongue-tied** and unable to **eloquently debate**, he excelled in **writing**. He served alongside Li Si under Xun Qing, and Li Si believed himself **inferior** to Han Fei. #2

Seeing the **Han state’s decline**, he repeatedly **submitted memorials** urging the Han king to **adopt capable advisors**, but the king **failed to act**. Thus, Han Fei observed that **governance did not seek merit** but instead **burdened honest officials** with **frivolous tasks**. He believed that **Confucians** disrupted law with **empty rhetoric**, while **chivalrous men** violated prohibitions through **violent force**. In times of **leniency**, he favored those **praised for reputation**; in times of **urgency**, he employed **armed warriors**. What he **used** was not what he **nurtured**, and what he **nurtured** was not what he **used**. The **frugal and upright** could not **thrive among corrupt ministers**. #3

Witnessing the **changes in fortune** of past rulers, he composed *Gu Fèn* (孤愤), *Wu Du* (五蠹), *Nei-Wai Chu* (内外储), and *Shuò Nàn* (说难) — **fifty-five chapters**, **over ten thousand words**. Someone **transmitted his writings to Qin**. #4

The Qin king, upon seeing *Gu Fèn* and *Wu Du*, exclaimed: *"Ah! If I could meet this man and converse with him, I would not regret even death."* Li Si replied: *"This is the work of Han Fei."* Qin then **hurriedly launched an assault** against Han.

Initially, Han **did nothing**, but when pressed, they **sent Han Fei as an envoy to Qin**. The Qin king **took pleasure in him**, yet **did not yet employ him**. Li Si feared him, saying: *"Han Fei is a princely son of the Han state. Now that we seek to **unify the feudal lords**, he will ultimately **remain loyal to Han rather than serve Qin**—this is his **natural inclination**. If the king **does not use him** but keeps him **long in residence**, only to **return him**, this will **invite disaster** for himself. It would be better to **transgress the law** and **execute him**."* The Qin king agreed, **ordered his arrest**, and Li Si **had poison administered** to him, compelling him to **suicide early**. Han Fei wished to **present himself in person** but **could not gain an audience**. Later, the Qin king **regretted his decision**, sending someone to **pardon him**, but Han Fei was already dead. #5

**Han Feizi (卷之二 有度第六)**

The **Han Feizi** states: *"The **supreme authority of the sovereign’s position**—his **weighty majesty** and **overwhelming power**—is **unmatched**."* #6

The **Han Feizi** states: *"A state has no **constant strength**, nor **constant weakness**. When those who **uphold the Dao/Way** are strong, the state is strong; when they **act without bending the law** nor **following private interests**. When those who **uphold the Dao/Way** are weak, the state is weak. King Zheng of Chu **annexed twenty-six states**, **expanding his territory by three thousand li**, yet his people and **sacred altars** (社稷) perished with Chu’s fall. In Chu’s time of **prosperity** and its time of **ruin**, neither the people nor the **sacred altars** (社稷) changed, yet both **flourished** and **perished**—the difference lies in whether the **Dao/Way was upheld with strength or weakness**. Lord Huan of Qi **annexed thirty states**, **expanding his territory by three thousand li**, yet his people and **sacred altars** (社稷) perished with Qi’s fall. King Xiang of Yan **set the Yellow River as its border** and **Jixia as its capital**, **seized the cities of Zhaoxi and Fangcheng**—both **Yan’s vassals**—and **defeated Qi**, **subdued Zhongshan**. With Yan’s presence, neighboring states **grew heavy**; without it, they **grew light**—meaning those who **ally with Yan** (as a party) were favored, while others were slighted. Yet Yan’s people and **sacred altars** (社稷) perished with its fall. King Anli of Wei **assaulted Zhao to rescue Yan**, **seizing the land of Hedong**—once the domain of Southern Yan, now **Wei’s through Yan’s favor**. He **conquered all of Tao and Wei’s territory**, **laid siege to Lu’s capital** in private ambition, **plundered the city of Guan**—once the domain of **Guan Zhong**—and **triumphed at Qixia**. In the **affair of Suiyang**, Chu’s army **aged and fled** after prolonged resistance. In the **affair of Cai and Zhaoling**, Chu’s army was **defeated**. **Wei’s forces spread across the four quarters**, **dominating the states of the civilized world**. Yet when Anli died, Wei **perished**.

Thus, when Chu had **Zheng** and Qi had **Huan**, Chu and Qi **could become hegemons**. When Yan had **Xiang** and Wei had **Anli**, Yan and Wei **could grow strong**. Yet now they are all **ruined states**, for their **ministers and officials** all **pursue disorder** rather than **order**. Their states are **disordered and weak**, and they **abandon the state’s laws** while **privately enriching their own affairs**—meaning they **prioritize their own interests** over public duty. This is like **carrying fuel to extinguish a fire**—the disorder and weakness are **most severe**. Therefore, in the present age, if one **discards private interests** and **conforms to public law**, the people **will be secure** and the state **will flourish**. If one **discards private schemes** and **strictly follows public law**, then the **army will be strong** and the **enemies will be weak**.

Hence, if the sovereign **selects ministers** based on their **mastery of gain and loss** and **adherence to legal standards**, then the ruler **cannot be deceived by falsehoods**. If the sovereign **chooses advisors** who **weigh gain and loss with precision**, then the ruler **cannot be deceived by the lightness or gravity of matters under Heaven**. Now, if **merit is advanced through flattery**, then ministers **will abandon their lord** and **clique with inferiors**—for merit comes from flattery, and they **seek empty praise**. If **officials are appointed by factional influence**, then the people **will focus on currying favor** rather than **seeking merit through law**. For when officials are **elevated by faction**, they **pursue connections** to secure their patrons’ support. Thus, when officials **lose merit through factionalism**, the state **becomes disordered**.

If **flattery is rewarded** and **slander is punished**, then those who **love rewards and hate punishments** will **ignore public law**, **practice private schemes**, and **clique with inferiors** for mutual gain. They **forget the state’s affairs** and **pursue private alliances**, thus their **inferiors will regard them lightly**. Though their **allies and patrons may be many**, and though **factions flourish within and without**, even if they commit **great crimes**, their **cover-ups will be numerous**. When **factions multiply**, they **shield each other**, so even **great crimes go unnoticed**. Thus, **loyal ministers** **perish unjustly**, while **wicked ministers** **prosper without merit**. When **wicked ministers** **clique with like-minded allies**, **loyal ministers** are **wrongly condemned** and **wicked ministers** **gain unjust rewards**.

If **loyal ministers** **perish unjustly** without their **crimes being proven**, then **virtuous ministers** **will be suppressed**. If **ministers harm their own kind**, then **virtuous ministers** **will be suppressed**. If **wicked ministers** **prosper unjustly** without **merit**, then **wicked ministers** **will advance**. For **those of like *qi*** **seek each other out**—thus **wicked ministers** **will rise**. This is the **root of ruin**.

If this is so, then though the **ministers may be many**, the ruler **holds only the name** of sovereignty, while **reality rests in the hands of his ministers’ factions**. For **authority and power do not shift**—this is why. Therefore, the minister says: *"The courts of ruined states hold no true men."* No **men who care for the state** remain. The minister—**Han Fei himself**—speaks. When the **court holds no true men**, it is not because the **court has declined**, but because **each household seeks its own gain**, not the **state’s prosperity**; **great ministers vie for their own honor**, not the **lord’s**; **lowly ministers accept their salaries** and **nurture their connections**, not **fulfilling their duties**. This is why it is so—because the ruler **does not enforce law from above** but **trusts those below** to act for him. Therefore, the **enlightened sovereign** **uses law to select ministers**, not **self-appointment**; he **uses law to measure merit**, not **self-assessment**.

The **method of selecting ministers** and **measuring merit** is **established in the state’s ordinances**—the **foundational institutions of the realm**."

「The capable must not be exhausted, the unworthy must not be adorned, praise cannot advance them, and criticism cannot dismiss them. By measuring merit with law, the capable cannot be exhausted, nor the unworthy adorned. When law adorns men, praise cannot advance them, nor criticism dismiss them. Thus, between ruler and ministers, distinctions are clear and governance is easy—clear distinctions mean good and evil do not conceal each other.

Therefore, the sovereign’s **enforcement of law** is acceptable. **Enforcement of law** refers to **examining and confirming** what is right. The **virtuous ministers**, when serving their lord, kneel in submission with no divided loyalty; they do not dare refuse lowly tasks for the court, and thus the soldiers do not dare refuse perilous missions. If the court refuses lowly tasks, then those below will harbor resentment toward their superiors. If soldiers refuse perilous missions, then officials will harbor intentions of neglecting their duties. To act in accordance with the lord’s will, to follow the lord’s law, and to keep an open mind awaiting commands without harboring bias—this is the way.

Thus, they speak with no private words, only words for the lord. They see with no private eyes, only eyes for the lord. And the lord fully **deploys their virtue**.

For those who serve as ministers, consider them like hands: the lord uses them to tend the head, while they use their own to tend the feet. Cold and heat, cleanliness and warmth—these cannot but be shared. When cold, they share warmth; when hot, they share cleanliness. All these are done through the hands, hence the saying: *"they cannot but be shared."*

Even when **sharp tools** are pressed against the body, the hands must grasp them. When a blade is near the body, the hands will inevitably grasp it—there are no **private virtuous ministers** or **private capable officials**. **Virtuous ministers** and **capable officials** are all employed for **public use**. Hence, the people do not cross their own villages to make friends, nor do they have **affinities within a hundred li**.

Once ministers are entrusted with **public virtue**, governance becomes fair and the state orderly; the people have no divergent expectations or external ambitions, hence they do not cross villages to make friends, and thus there are no **affinities within a hundred li**.

High and low do not overstep their bounds; the **foolish and the wise** are balanced and appointed accordingly, each receiving their proper place—hence the saying: *"balanced and appointed accordingly."* This is the pinnacle of governance.

Now, those who **lightly value rank and salary**, easily abandon a failing state to seek another lord, are not called **liberal**. To abandon a failing state and seek another lord is merely the act of a **greedy heart**. Such ministers cannot be called **liberal**.

Those who **deceive with flattery**, oppose the law, betray their lord, yet persist in giving strong advice, are not called **loyal**. To oppose the law and give strong advice is to **overstep the lord’s authority**. Such ministers cannot be called **loyal**.

Those who **practice kindness and bestow favors**, yet **demand credit from below**, are not called **benevolent**. To practice kindness and demand credit is to **create merit for oneself**. Such ministers cannot be called **benevolent**.

Those who **withdraw from society** and take refuge in seclusion, yet **criticize their superiors**, are not called **righteous**. To withdraw and criticize one’s superiors is to **exalt the lord’s faults**. Such ministers cannot be called **righteous**.

Those who **engage foreign lords as envoys**, yet **drain their own state’s resources**, wait for moments of **national peril** to instill fear in their lord, saying: *"Resentment is not mine that I cannot resolve; grievances are not mine that I cannot untangle,"*—if the lord believes them and **entrusts the state to their judgment**, humiliating the lord’s prestige to aggrandize themselves, destroying the state’s strength to benefit their own households—such ministers are not called **wise**. To exploit national peril for the lord’s discredit and destroy the state for personal gain is the act of **crafty tyrants**. Such ministers cannot be called **wise**.

These five practices are **crafty sayings of a treacherous age**, yet they are what the **ancient sages** **discarded**. **Crafty sayings** seek **short-term advantage**, while the **ancient sages’ teachings** must ensure **eternal adherence**. The **ancient sages’ laws** state: *"Ministers must not create their own authority, must not create their own profits, and must follow the king’s commands. They must not commit evil and must follow the king’s path."*

In ancient times, the people of a **well-governed age** adhered to **public law**, discarded **private schemes**, and focused their intentions solely on fulfilling their duties. The people of a **well-governed age**, in all their intentions and actions, did not use them for private gain but only to await the lord’s **appointment**.

If the lord personally **inspects every official**, he will lack time and strength. Instead, he should **employ law** to examine them. Moreover, if the lord relies on his **eyes**, those below will **adorn their appearances**; if he relies on his **ears**, they will **adorn their words**; if he relies on his **thoughts**, they will **proliferate their arguments**. The **ancient sages** regarded these three methods as insufficient, hence they **restrained their own abilities**, **relied on the law’s standards**, and **carefully assessed rewards and punishments**. This is what the **ancient sages** **held as essential**.

Thus, the law is **concise yet not restrictive**. Within the **Four Seas**, the **crafty and cunning** cannot employ their deceit, the **restless and bold** cannot rely on their flattery, and the **wicked and perverse** have no foundation to stand on. Even if they are **thousands of li away**, they dare not alter their words. Though they stand **among the attendants**, they dare not **conceal the good or embellish the bad**. **Attendants** are officials in **close service**.

Though the **lowly and humble** may be **direct and honest**, even they are prevented from **overstepping their bounds**. Though they are direct and honest, they are still **assigned their proper duties**, and the **powerful and strong** dare not overstep.

Hence, governance is **never lacking**, yet the lord’s **duties are always in excess**, for the **lord’s authority and the law’s teachings** make it so. Once the **foundations of governance** are established, the **lord’s duties** remain abundant, and the **teachings of law** and **virtue** are already balanced, while the **ministers are already disciplined**—then the lord’s **authoritative deployment** does not conflict, and the law’s teachings ensure it.

The **encroachment of ministers upon their lord** is like the **shape of the earth**: it **gradually shifts**, like how the **land appears to be tilled away** over time, **slowly eroded and diminished**. The lord loses his bearings, **east and west reversed**, yet he does not realize it. Since the encroachment comes **gradually**, even when it reaches the point where the lord **loses his bearings entirely**, he still **cannot perceive it**.

Therefore, the **ancient sages established the compass** to **determine the directions of morning and evening**—the compass being the **south-pointing chariot**—to illustrate the **state’s correct law**. Hence, the **enlightened sovereign** ensures his **ministers do not wander in thought beyond the law**, nor **practice favors within the law’s scope**; he does not allow **wandering thoughts beyond the law** or **favors within the law**, all of which are measures to **prevent encroachment.**»

The movement of all things must conform to law. Law is what transcends and restrains private deviations beyond its scope. If all the actions of the ministers are governed by law, then any transgression beyond it is nothing but private scheming.

Harsh punishments are used to ensure and deter the subjects. The reason for harsh punishments is to ensure and deter the subjects. *Ensure* means to make thorough.

Authority does not delegate errors, and governance does not share decisions with ministers. Authority should be the sovereign’s to correct, so it does not delegate to ministers—governance and correction should be the sovereign’s alone. *Errors* means to place. If authority and governance are shared with ministers, then all evils will flourish. If governance and authority are shared with ministers, then the suppression of evil will be clearly demonstrated.

If law lacks credibility, the sovereign’s rule becomes perilous. If law lacks credibility, the heir cannot be established, hence the sovereign’s peril. If punishments are not decisive, evil cannot be subdued.

Thus it is said: A skilled carpenter aligns his vision with the plumb line, yet he must first use the compass and square as his measure. Though the carpenter’s eye aligns with the plumb line, it cannot be used without the compass and square as his standard. The wise ruler swiftly executes affairs in accordance with the laws of the ancient kings, yet even his wisdom cannot suffice without taking the ancient kings’ laws as his standard.

The plumb line straightens crooked wood, and the level plane shaves down high ground. *Equal* refers to leveling high ground to bring it down. The balance scale, when suspended, makes heavy things lighter and light things heavier—reducing the heavy and increasing the light until the scale is balanced. The measure for grain and stone, when set, makes abundance scarce—reducing the excess and increasing the deficit until the measure is full.

Thus, governing the state with law is simply a matter of applying and executing it. When law is applied and executed properly, governance naturally becomes balanced. Law does not favor the noble; the plumb line does not bend to crookedness. Where law is applied, the wise cannot evade it, nor the brave dare to contest it. Punishment for crimes does not spare high ministers, nor does reward for virtue neglect the commoner.

Thus, correcting the sovereign’s errors, reproving the subjects’ evils, resolving chaos and confusion, suppressing arrogance and aligning wrongdoing—suppressing the proud and arrogant, rectifying their wrongs. *Suppressing* is pronounced *chù*. No better guide for the people exists than law. Officials rely on authority to govern the people. *Rely on officials* means to make officials subordinate to oneself. To repel licentiousness and deceit, to stop fraud and falsehood, nothing is more effective than punishment.

Heavy punishments ensure that none dare exchange low status for high through nobility or use noble power to disdain the low. Precise law ensures the sovereign’s authority is exalted and unassailable, making the ruler strong and secure in his essentials—thus the ancient kings valued and transmitted it. *Transmitted* means passed down to posterity.

If the sovereign abandons law for private favoritism, then distinctions between ruler and subjects vanish.

**The Two Instruments (Chapter Seven)**
The enlightened sovereign guides and restrains his ministers through two instruments alone. *Guides* means to lead, speaking of how the Way leads. He instructs his ministers and judges them accordingly. The two instruments are punishment and virtue. What are punishment and virtue?

Punishment refers to killing and slaughter; virtue refers to rewards and honors. As a subject, one fears punishment and seeks rewards, so if the sovereign personally wields punishment and virtue, the ministers will fear his authority and seek his benefits.

Yet the deluded ministers of the world act otherwise: what they hate, they can persuade the sovereign to punish, and through deceit and flattery, they use the sovereign’s authority to inflict punishment. What they love, they can persuade the sovereign to reward, and through deceit and flattery, they use the sovereign’s favor to bestow rewards.

Now, if the sovereign does not ensure that the power of rewards and punishments originates from himself, but instead listens to his ministers and lets them execute rewards and punishments, then all the people in the state will fear the ministers and disregard the sovereign. If ministers mete out punishment, the people will fear the ministers and despise the sovereign. They will turn to the ministers and abandon the sovereign. If ministers bestow rewards, the people will turn to the ministers and abandon the sovereign. This is the sovereign’s peril of losing control over punishment and virtue.

The tiger’s power over dogs lies in its claws and teeth. If the tiger abandons its claws and teeth and lets the dogs use them, then the tiger will be subdued by the dogs. The sovereign uses punishment and virtue to restrain his ministers. If the sovereign abandons punishment and virtue and lets the ministers wield them, then the sovereign will be controlled by his ministers—subdued by his own subjects.

Thus, Tian Chang requested titles and emoluments from his lord and distributed them among the ministers, requesting the lord’s titles and emoluments to bestow upon the ministers, thereby establishing private virtue among the officials. He used large measures for grain and stone when distributing to the people, thereby establishing private favor among the commoners. This was how Duke Jian of Qi lost his virtue, allowing Tian Chang to exploit it—thus Duke Jian was assassinated.

Zi Han told the Duke of Song: "Rewards and honors are what the people delight in; the sovereign should personally administer them. Killing and punishment are what the people abhor; let me, your subject, bear this responsibility." Thus, the Duke of Song lost control over punishment, allowing Zi Han to exploit it—thus the Duke of Song was held hostage.

Tian Chang relied solely on virtue, meaning he did not combine it with punishment, yet Duke Jian was assassinated. Zi Han relied solely on punishment, meaning he did not combine it with virtue, yet the Duke of Song was held hostage.

Thus, today’s ministers, if they combine punishment and virtue and wield them, then the peril facing the sovereign is even greater than that of Duke Jian or the Duke of Song. Therefore, no sovereign who allows his ministers to wield punishment and virtue without peril or ruin has ever existed.

If the sovereign wishes to suppress deceit, he must carefully match punishments to their designated crimes. *Speaking* refers to naming, *affairs* refers to actions. If the words and deeds do not align, their correspondence cannot be known.

When a minister presents his words, the sovereign assigns him the corresponding task and holds him solely accountable for its outcome. If the outcome matches the task and the task matches the words, then reward. If the outcome does not match the task or the task does not match the words, then punish.

Thus, if ministers make grand claims but achieve little, they are punished—not for minor achievements, but for outcomes failing to match their claims. If ministers make modest claims but achieve greatly, they are also punished—not because great achievements are displeased, but because they do not match their claims. The harm of unmatched claims is greater than having great achievements, hence the punishment.

「The harm of failing to match the words is greater than having great achievements, and great achievements that #9[shock the sovereign] are also grounds for punishment.

In ancient times, the Lord of Zhao became drunk and fell asleep. The attendant who managed the crown saw that his lord was cold, so he added a robe to his lord’s body. When the lord awoke from his sleep, he was pleased, and upon waking, he realized the act.

He asked his attendants: "Who added the robe?"
The attendants replied: "The crown attendant."
The lord then punished both the robe attendant and the crown attendant together.

The robe attendant was blamed for neglecting his duty, while the crown attendant was blamed for overstepping his authority. The lord was not displeased because he disliked the cold—rather, he deemed the harm of encroaching on another’s office as greater than the cold itself.

Thus, a wise sovereign keeps his ministers in check: they may not overstep their duties to gain achievements, nor may they make claims that do not match their words. Overstepping duties results in death, failing to match claims results in punishment. Faithfully fulfilling their assigned duties and matching their words with their deeds is the true standard. By adhering to their proper duties and ensuring their words align with them, ministers cannot form factions.

A sovereign has two afflictions: favoring the virtuous may allow ministers to exploit the sovereign’s trust by seizing power. The virtuous must necessarily possess many talents and skills, thus enabling them to exploit their virtue and usurp the sovereign’s authority.

Or, reckless appointments may lead to failure and defeat. Reckless appointments refer to selecting ministers without regard to their merit, which inevitably results in failure and defeat. *Stū* (沮) means ruin and collapse. Therefore, when a sovereign favors the virtuous, ministers embellish their conduct to curry favor, and their true intentions remain concealed. Embellished conduct is mere pretense, so their inner motives are not revealed. *Xiǎn* (效) means to manifest or display. If ministers’ true intentions are not displayed, the sovereign cannot distinguish them.

Since all ministers embellish their conduct, the sovereign cannot tell true from false. Thus, the King of Yue loved valor, and his people often died lightly. The King of Chu loved slender waists, and his realm had many starving men. The Duke of Qi was jealous and fond of his women, so Jian Tiǎo (坚刁) took matters into his own hands to manage the inner quarters; the Duke of Qi loved fine flavors, so Yí Yá (易牙) steamed his own son’s head and offered it to him. Zi Qiao (子之) of Yan loved virtue, so Zi Ming (子之明) refused to accept the throne, claiming to let Zi Qiao take it instead, and thus seized power.

Hence, when the sovereign perceives evil, ministers conceal their true motives to avoid what he dislikes. When the sovereign perceives good, ministers falsely claim their abilities to seek favor. If the sovereign desires to see something, ministers’ true inclinations and behaviors provide the means to manipulate him. Ministers’ true inclinations are all aimed at seeking personal gain—when the sovereign sees their preferences, he knows where their interests lie, and thus they can exploit his desires.

Therefore, Zi Ming (子之明) relied on his virtue to deceive and take power from his lord, Jian Tiǎo (坚刁) and Yí Yá (易牙) exploited the lord’s desires to encroach upon his authority, and Zi Qiao (子哙) ultimately brought chaos to Yan. Zi Qiao (子哙) was the name of the Yan king. The Duke of Qi’s corpse was left unburied outside the gate—what was the reason for this?

The sovereign’s own preferences lend themselves to the ministers’ schemes, thereby inviting their misdeeds.»

The sovereign’s preferences and aversions, once revealed, become tools for ministers to exploit for their own gain—this is how desires invite ministers to seek advantage, thereby generating chaos. Ministers do not inherently love their sovereign; they act out of self-interest.

When the sovereign does not conceal his preferences nor obscure their origins, he unwittingly grants ministers the means to encroach upon him. By revealing his likes and dislikes, he allows them to exploit these very traits to undermine his authority. Thus, ministers would readily serve figures like Zi Ming (子之) or Tian Chang (田常).

Hence it is said: *"Abandon likes and dislikes, and ministers will show their true nature."* If the sovereign has no preferences, ministers cannot feign false abilities for his favor—truth will naturally manifest. When ministers reveal their true nature, the sovereign will not be misled.

**Yáng Quán** (扬权, *lit.* "Promoting Authority")—the eighth principle: **Yáng** (扬) means to uplift and clarify, **Quán** (权) means to measure matters and devise strategies. The great patterns of Heaven and Earth—day and night, the four seasons—are Heaven’s great **Quán** (命). The proper distinctions between sovereign and ministers, superiors and inferiors, are humanity’s great **Quán** (命).

Fragrant delicacies and tender flavors, rich wine and fatty meats, though pleasing to the palate, bring ruin to the body. Graceful demeanor and white teeth, though charming, drain vitality when indulged excessively. Acquired talents, though helpful, become perilous if misapplied—overuse leads to bodily harm, excessive indulgence wastes vital essence, and improper reliance on clever ministers endangers the sovereign. Thus, avoiding extremes preserves safety.

**Quán** (权) should not be wielded if the sovereign’s **Way** (道) remains natural and unforced. The affairs of the four directions (四方) depend on the center (中央). The four directions refer to the people, while the center refers to the sovereign. The sage holds the center, and the four directions come to serve him. If he remains empty and receptive, they will naturally align themselves.

**Yīn** (以, *lit.* "use") means to employ. The sovereign need only maintain an open heart and await their actions; then each will naturally apply their own abilities. When the four seas are contained, **Yīn** (道) reveals itself in **Yáng** (阳). The four seas are the four directions; to contain them is to let them remain unseen. If their abilities are thus, the sovereign must guide ministers’ **Yīn** (阴) to reveal his own **Yáng** (阳)—when **Yīn** and **Yáng** meet, sovereign and ministers will harmonize.

Once the left and right ministers (左右) are established, the sovereign must open the door to receive them. The left and right ministers are the **left assistant** (左辅) and **right minister** (右弼). When sovereign and ministers harmonize, these aiding ministers will stand firm—like echoes following sound, or voices resonating in unison. Then, all worthy talents from the four directions will gather.

The sovereign need only open the door to receive them, without obstruction. **Dāng** (当) means to accept. If he does not alter or shift their roles, letting the two ministers—**left assistant** and **right minister**—both fulfill their duties, then once their tasks are set in motion, if they prove capable and worthy, these are all ministers of **virtue** (贤), needing no removal. None will fail to transform and align.

This is called **treading the Way** (履理). When the sovereign can **tread the Way**, success will follow.

Things have their proper uses, talents have their fitting applications. If each is placed where it belongs, then superiors and inferiors need no forced intervention. To let a rooster guard the night or a weasel catch mice is to employ their abilities—yet the superior will have no work to do. If the superior has strengths, affairs will naturally proceed without obstruction.

To **boast** (矜) of abilities and **favor** (好) cleverness is to invite deception from inferiors. If those in high positions **boast** of their cleverness, inferiors will each embellish their own abilities to deceive them. To **cherish** (辩惠) and **love** (好生) cleverness is to exploit talents. If superiors **cherish** cleverness and **love** those who are skillful in **deception** (辩惠), inferiors will use their talents to flatter and curry favor—cleverness itself becomes a tool for **deception**.

When superiors and inferiors exchange roles, the state will inevitably fall into disarray. If superiors **boast** while inferiors manipulate, the state will not be well-ordered.

The **Way** of **unity** (一) begins with **proper naming** (名). **Yī** (一) refers to the **Way**. What can be perpetually applied, unchanged from ancient to modern times, is only **proper naming**. Thus it is said: *"The **Way** of **unity** begins with **proper naming**."* When names are correct, things are settled; when names are misaligned, things shift accordingly.

Therefore, the sage holds **unity** to remain **still** (静), letting names define themselves and affairs settle naturally. Once names and affairs are aligned, matters will naturally be settled. If the superior does not observe their forms, inferiors will naturally maintain correctness.

Following their actions, he entrusts them, letting them take charge. If he follows their actions and entrusts them, they will naturally assume their own responsibilities. Following their actions and granting them authority, they will naturally take charge. If he follows their actions and aligns with them, they will naturally settle matters themselves. The superior uses **proper naming** to guide them—all matters are left to their own definition. If the superior follows this method, then **punishments and names** will be clear and precise.

If he does not know their names, he will again examine their forms. Forms refer to affairs. By tracing affairs to seek their names, their names can be known. When forms and names correspond, he will use those who arise from them.

Those who arise from them—those who emerge through the alignment of forms and names—are the ones he will employ. If these two (forms and names) are **sincere** (诚) and **trustworthy** (信), inferiors will naturally contribute their true **emotions** (情).

**Gòng** (贡) means to present or reveal. The ruler who carefully attends to affairs will receive **Heaven’s response** (符应之命). He must not lose the **key points** (要), and then he will be a sage.

The sage’s **Way** abandons **wisdom** (智) and **cleverness** (巧). If **wisdom** and **cleverness** are not abandoned, it is difficult to maintain the **Way** as a constant. When **wisdom** and **cleverness** are present, they will inevitably lead to **deception** (诈) and deviation from the **Way**. Thus, they must be abandoned.

If common people employ them, their own lives will suffer many calamities. If the sovereign employs them, his state will face peril and ruin.

Following **Heaven’s **Way** (天之道), reversing **forms’ principles** (形之理), and **supervising** (督), **verifying** (参), and **examining** (鞠) them together, the end will return to the beginning. Once **wisdom** and **cleverness** are abandoned, the superior follows **Heaven’s **Way****, while inferiors reverse **forms’ principles**—the two together are **supervised**, **verified**, and **examined**. When their actions conclude, they return to their original state.

Remaining **empty** (虚) and **still** (静), he never uses himself first. The **Way** of the sage is always to defer to others after **emptiness** and **stillness**, never to act first by employing himself.

The sovereign’s afflictions always arise from his own beginnings. **Beginnings** (端) refer to the first matters presented. If a minister presents affairs without distinguishing their merit or demerit, always aligning with them, then this is the peril of partial listening leading to calamity.

**Trust** (信) without alignment, and all the people will follow in unison. When matters are presented, first **trust** them, but do not immediately align with them. Then select their virtuous aspects to apply in governance, and all the people will be harmonized and follow in unison.

The **Dao/Way** is vast and boundless yet without form;
**Virtue/Power** is the essence of principle yet universally pervasive.
When applied to all beings, it weighs and measures their use—
All things flourish, yet it does not rest with them.
**Virtue/Power** does not rest with things, yet things themselves find rest.

The **Dao/Way** is not confined to affairs but follows examination to issue commands,
Giving life and death in accordance with the times.
This is saying: *You should examine the **Dao/Way** to determine your responses to their petitions.*
**While** (而), *you* (汝) also.
**Life and death** (死生) is akin to **abolishment and restoration** (废兴).
It means: *When their teachings can be abolished, abolish them; when they can be restored, restore them.*

**Verify** (参) different matters by their names,
Yet ensure they converge in one principle and shared sentiment.
**Verify** the names of different matters,
And command them to be unified yet resonate with shared sentiment.
Thus it is said: The **Dao/Way** does not align with all things, yet it can give birth to all things.
**Virtue/Power** does not align with yin and yang, yet it can perfect yin and yang.
The **balance** (衡) does not align with light and heavy, yet it can discern their lightness and weight.
The **measuring line** (绳) does not align with right and wrong, yet it can rectify right and wrong.
**Harmony** (和) does not align with dryness and moisture, yet it can equalize dryness and moisture.
The sovereign does not align with the multitude of ministers.
Thus he can govern the multitude of ministers.
These six principles are the **manifestations of the Dao** (道之出).
These six principles all arise from the **Dao/Way** itself, hence it is said: *the **manifestations of the Dao** (道之出).*

The **Dao/Way** has no duality, hence it is said: *one* (一).
Thus, the enlightened sovereign values the singular **Dao/Way**,
And the **Dao/Way** is valued for its singularity.

If the sovereign and ministers do not align in the **Dao/Way**,
The inferiors should present their names and petitions.
The inferiors should present their words and reasoning to petition the sovereign.
The sovereign holds their names, while the ministers embody their forms—
When **forms** and **names** are **verified** and aligned,
Superior and inferior are harmonized and attuned.

The **Dao/Way** of listening is to let their words emerge,
Yet use them to draw inward and discern.
The **Dao/Way** of listening is such:
If there are doubts, one must speak to challenge them,
And they will then seek their principles to align with yours.

Thus, **verify** the names to establish positions,
And clarify distinctions to differentiate categories.
**Verify** the names, and the matters and positions will be self-established.
Clarify their distinctions, and the types of things will be self-differentiated.

The **Dao/Way** of listening is like being deeply intoxicated.
**Dissolving** (溶) is the appearance of leisure and ease.
When listening to speech, one should appear **dissolved** (溶) as if deeply intoxicated,
So that the speaker will fully reveal their thoughts and words will be laid bare.

Lips or teeth—
I will not be the first to speak.
If lips or teeth speak,
The more I appear **dim-witted** (惛惛),
The more they will appear **clear and bright** (昭昭).
They will then separate themselves,
And I will thereby know them.

Right and wrong radiate outward,
The sovereign does not fabricate them.

**Separation** refers to analyzing what they say.
Once they have been analyzed, I thereby know it.
The words they present—whether right or wrong—
radiate outward like spokes converging on a hub,
all arising from sincere intent below,
while the sovereign does not contrive them.

*Contrive* (構) means *to bind* (結).
**Vacuity and stillness, non-action**—this is the essence of the Dao/Way.
**Comparing and aligning things**—this is the form of governance.
Compare by aligning with things,
and arrange in fives to harmonize with vacuity.
If the roots and trunks remain unshaken,
then movements and leaks will not be lost.

*Compare* (參) is three.
*Arrange* (伍) is five.
That is, the matters presented may be examined in threes through the alignment of things,
or in fives through the harmonization of vacuity’s numbers.
Always ensure the roots and trunks are firmly planted,
unmoved and unshaken—
thus, even if movements scatter,
nothing will be lost or leaked.

When movements **dissolve** (溶),
non-action governs their transformation.
All actions, when **dissolved** (溶) in leisure,
though altered, are done without contrivance.

If you take pleasure, there will be excess;
if you take dislike, resentment will arise.
That is, when ministers present their words,
if the sovereign favors them, they will flatter and multiply their deeds.
If the sovereign dislikes them, they will harbor resentment and cease.

Thus, abandoning favor and aversion,
emptying the heart as the Dao’s dwelling,
the heart, emptied of favor and aversion,
becomes the Dao’s resting place.
The sovereign does not interfere with them,
and the people thereby receive their due.

That is, when ministers act without the sovereign’s involvement,
they gain autonomy, and their deeds will succeed,
thus earning their honor and favor.

The sovereign does not share in their governance,
but instead closes the inner gates,
observing the court from within the chamber—
measuring with the span of a *zhi* (咫) and *cun* (寸),
all things already in their proper place.
Reward those who deserve reward,
punish those who deserve punishment.

*Closing the inner gates* means sealing the heart to scrutinize ministers.
From within, observing outward—
like viewing the courtyard from a chamber.
Eight *cun* make a *zhi*.
*Cun* and *inch* measure length—
once the heart is sealed and verified,
and measured with *zhi* and *cun*,
both are complete—
then great and small, long and short,
each finds its place without confusion.
Thus, if reward is due, reward is given;
if punishment is due, punishment is meted out—
no contradictions arise.

Following their actions,
each attains their own outcome.
Good and evil will surely be met—
who would dare not believe?

Once the *gu* (规) and *ju* (矩) are set,
the three corners align.
If rewards and punishments are applied correctly to one or two matters,
people will know the rest follow the same rule—
thus, the three corners align.

If the sovereign is not **divine** (神),
the ministers will exploit the opportunity.
*Divine* refers to what is hidden and inscrutable in its workings.
Since the sovereign is not divine,
it can be measured—
and if measured, it can be exploited—
thus, the ministers will take advantage.

If their actions are improper,
the ministers will examine the norms.
When governance is flawed,
the ministers will assess it against established principles
to expose its faults.

Like heaven or earth—
this is called **layered resolution** (累解).
Heaven and earth are vast and profound,
beyond measure.
If the sovereign’s intent mirrors heaven and earth,
then even layered scrutiny will reveal no flaw.

Like earth, like heaven—
who is distant, who is close?
Heaven covers without favor,
earth bears without preference—
thus, there is neither distance nor closeness.

To embody heaven and earth—
this is the sage.

To govern the inner realm,
appoint officials without personal favor.
*The inner realm* refers to the sovereign’s secrets.
To ensure no loss in confidential matters,
do not show private favor to the appointed ministers.

To govern the outer realm,
assign one official per office.
Do not allow them unchecked authority—
how else could they usurp or combine powers?

*The outer realm* refers to the administration of officials.
To ensure governance is not lost,
assign one person per office—
two strong figures will inevitably clash,
and if an office has two, it only breeds suspicion.
One ensures specialization without excess,
so no shifting or merging occurs.

The gates of great ministers
should fear no one but themselves.
Ministers’ gates teem with people
because power and influence reside there.

The pinnacle of governance:
the ministers cannot fathom it.
The sovereign’s hidden, inscrutable nature
makes it unattainable to the ministers—
thus, this is the ultimate in governance.

When *xing* (刑) and *ming* (名) are harmonized,
the people will uphold their duties.
To abandon this and seek alternatives
is the greatest confusion.

The more cunning the people,
the more rampant the deceit.
Since the greatest confusion prevails,
deceit multiplies and evil spreads.

Thus it is said:
Do not lend to the wealthy,
nor coerce the noble.
If the sovereign lends to ministers as if they were wealthy,
or commands them as if they were noble—
these are the inverted and deluded,
who do not recognize principle.

Do not place absolute trust in one person
and thereby lose the state.
Trusting one alone
concentrates power and authority,
thus the state is lost.

A calf larger than the thigh—
difficult to run swiftly.
A minister heavier than the sovereign—
difficult to govern.

The sovereign loses their **divinity** (神),
and the tiger follows close behind.
*Losing divinity* means the sovereign becomes predictable,
like a minister who acts as a tiger,
waiting to exploit their openings.

If the sovereign remains unaware,
the tiger will become a dog.
If the sovereign fails to recognize the tiger in the minister,
the minister will conceal their ferocity,
appearing docile like a dog—
this is how they secretly plot.

If the sovereign does not act swiftly,
the dogs will multiply without end.
Once the minister masks as a dog,
and the sovereign fails to stop them,
they will recruit others to their cause,
growing their faction endlessly.

When the tigers form their pack,
they will slay their mother.
*The mother* refers to the sovereign.
Once the faction solidifies,
the tigers will turn on their source.

To be a sovereign without ministers—
what state remains?

All ministers are tigers—thus it is said there are no ministers. Without ministers, the state perishes—thus it is said, *what state remains?*

When the sovereign enforces his laws, the great tigers grow timid.
When the sovereign applies his punishments, the great tigers settle into compliance.
Once the sovereign has enforced his punishments, the tigers fear and walk the Dao, thus attaining peace.

Let the laws and punishments be trusted by dogs, and the tigers will transform into humans, returning to their true nature—
meaning the sovereign rules as sovereign, the minister serves as minister.

To govern the state, one must strike at their gatherings.
Their gatherings are the factions where they conspire; striking them scatters their factions.
If you do not strike their gatherings, they will gather more.

To secure the land, one must distribute rewards appropriately—
the land is also the state.
To govern the state, one must ensure rewards are justly given.
If rewards are not just, the disorderly will seek more.
When they demand and you give, it is like lending an axe to an enemy—
if you give what should not be given, they will use it to strike you.
To give an axe to an enemy is to lend what should not be lent—
once the enemy has the axe, your being struck is only right.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*The ruler and subjects wage war a hundred times a day.*
The position of the sovereign is precious, its advantages coveted—
those below always harbor desires.
To remain still is impossible; to take is unattainable—
these two forces clash a hundred times in a day.

The subjects conceal their private schemes, testing the sovereign above.
The sovereign must wield measure and restraint to curb them.
Since those below harbor covetous desires, they constantly conceal their schemes to test the sovereign—
thus the sovereign must wield measure and restraint to judge and cut them down.

Therefore, the establishment of measure and restraint is the sovereign’s treasure—
measure and restraint can curb those below, making them the sovereign’s treasure.

Factional alliances are the minister’s treasure.
Factional alliances can usurp the sovereign’s position, hence they are the minister’s treasure.
The minister does not kill his sovereign because his factional alliances are incomplete.

Thus, when the sovereign loses an inch, the subjects gain a fathom.
*Four fingers* are an *exhu*—
when the sovereign slightly falters in measure and restraint, the subjects gain benefits many times over.

A sovereign of a state does not enlarge his capital.
To enlarge the capital, ministers will seize it to rebel.
A virtuous minister does not honor his own family.
When a great officer honors his family, the minister will use it to elevate himself.
A virtuous sovereign does not honor his ministers.
To honor his ministers, the minister will grow in power beyond the sovereign.
If honored and enriched, they will prepare to replace him.
Once the minister is honored, enriched, and prepared, he will surely usurp the sovereign.
In peril, place the heir apparent swiftly—then calamity will have no source.
The heir apparent is the sovereign’s deputy and the state’s stronghold.
To avert danger, appoint him quickly—then the roots of disaster will cease.

To seek out and restrain those who plot within, the sovereign must personally wield measure and restraint.
Ministers scheme against the sovereign from all sides, always lurking in the capital—
now, if you seek to restrain those who plot from within, you must only ensure the sovereign personally wields measure and restraint.

The powerful must be diminished, the weak must be exhausted.
*The powerful* refers to the minister’s factions, their influence and rank high.
Their rank must be diminished to weaken them.
Diminish and exhaust them with measure—
do not let the people compare and unite, conspiring together against the sovereign.
Diminish them like the moon’s waning—
like the gradual decline of light.
It follows the principle that all that flourishes must decline—
the way of Heaven.
Exhaust them like heat—
like drawing fire until it burns without respite.
Orders must be strict, punishments swift—
exhaust the logic of penalties.
Do not slacken the bow—
one perch cannot hold two eagles.
*A bow* is drawn to shoot what should not perch—
this metaphorizes punishments and laws against officials unfit for their positions.
One perch cannot hold two eagles—they will fight, *their struggle is visible.*
Wolves and jackals in the prison—
their sheep will not multiply.
*Wolves and jackals* symbolize corrupt officials.
A household with two nobles—
their affairs will bear no fruit.
Two nobles will vie for dominance, and those serving will not know whom to follow—
thus, their affairs bear no fruit.
When husband and wife jointly rule—
the children will not know whom to obey.
The proper order is for the husband to lead and the wife to follow—
now, if husband and wife contend for rule, the children will be confused.

For the sovereign, frequently prune his branches—
do not let the branches spread unchecked.
*Branches* symbolize ministers.
*Pruning* means stripping their power.
Frequently stripping the ministers’ influence—
their factions will disperse.
Uproot their foundations, and the tree will lose its power.
Fill the deep pools—
do not let the water remain clear.
*A pool* is where water accumulates.
If the water is clear, many will gather to gaze—
just as those who align with them will multiply.
Probe their intentions, strip them of their influence.
*Probe their intentions*—
to plumb their hidden desires.

The sovereign employs them—
like lightning, like thunder.
If their awe does not extend to all,
then the sovereign’s command is divine and to be feared—
thus like thunder and lightning.

**The Nine Deceits of the Eighth Category**
In general, the ways by which ministers foster treachery are eight in number.
*Ways* means to entice.
It means that treacherous ministers either entice the sovereign’s attendants
or entice the sovereign’s subjects to accomplish their wicked schemes,
and their methods are eightfold.

**First: Sharing the Bed**
What is meant by *sharing the bed*?
It refers to noble consorts, beloved children,
and those who indulge in private pleasures and favor beautiful women.
These are the ones who bewitch the sovereign.
Under the pretext of leisurely companionship,
taking advantage of the sovereign’s drunkenness or satiety,
they seek what they desire—
this is the art of ensuring compliance.
*Taking advantage* means to exploit.
Consorts and children, by providing entertainment during the sovereign’s drunkenness or satiety,
and offering their desired favors,
have nothing the sovereign will not grant.
As ministers, they curry favor with gold and jade,
bewitching the sovereign through them—
this is called *sharing the bed*.
With treasures of gold and jade,
they curry favor with noble consorts and beloved children,
causing the sovereign to be bewitched—
once the sovereign is bewitched, their treacherous schemes can succeed.

**Second: Standing at the Side**
What is meant by *standing at the side*?

**The Eight Methods of Treacherous Ministers**

**1. Dwarfs and Jesters**
What is meant by *dwarfs and jesters*?
It refers to jesters who can sing and laugh, and dwarfs—short men.
These are the attendants who, without being commanded, respond with *"Yes, yes"* (wúwú), and without being ordered, reply with *"Yes, sir"* (nuònuò). They anticipate the sovereign’s intent, observing his expressions and complexion to foresee his will.
They advance and retreat together, respond and answer together—if the sovereign wishes to promote someone, they all promote him; if he wishes to demote someone, they all demote him. When commanded, they all reply; when questioned, they all answer.
Their words follow a single track, subtly shifting the sovereign’s heart.
As ministers, they curry favor with gold, jade, and luxuries, and in public, they commit illegal acts to corrupt the sovereign—this is called *standing at the side*.

Once treacherous ministers have used gold and jade to curry favor with the sovereign’s close attendants, and in public have committed illegal acts to gradually corrupt him, the sovereign, once accustomed to vice, will have his position made vulnerable to seizure.

**2. Father and Elder Brother**
What is meant by *father and elder brother*?
It refers to concubines’ sons and the sovereign’s beloved children—those the sovereign holds dear—and the great ministers and court officials with whom the sovereign consults on affairs. These are all those who exert their strength and offer counsel, whose words the sovereign is bound to heed.
As ministers, they curry favor with the concubines’ sons and side chambers through music, children, and concubines, and they win over great ministers and court officials with flattery and persuasive speech. They arrange matters of state, and when their schemes succeed, they are rewarded with titles and increased emoluments, thus encouraging their hearts to betray the sovereign—this is called *father and elder brother*.
*Winning over* means to control their loyalty.
It means that ministers seek to sway the hearts of great ministers through flattery and reputation, then arrange matters of state with the sovereign. Once their schemes succeed, the great ministers are rewarded with titles and emoluments, using this to encourage their disloyalty, causing them to offend the sovereign. When the sovereign is offended, a rift arises between ruler and minister, and treacherous ministers can then act upon their schemes.

**3. Nurturing Calamity**
What is meant by *nurturing calamity*?
It refers to the sovereign’s delight in beautiful palaces, ponds, and gardens, and his fondness for adorning his children, dogs, and horses to amuse his heart—these are the sovereign’s calamities.
As ministers, they exhaust the people’s strength to beautify palaces, ponds, and gardens, and impose heavy taxes to adorn children, dogs, and horses, thus amusing the sovereign while clouding his judgment. They comply with his desires while secretly amassing private gains—this is called *nurturing calamity*.

**4. Stirring the People**
What is meant by *stirring the people*?
It refers to ministers dispersing public funds to please the people, practicing minor acts of kindness to win over the common folk, so that both the court and the marketplace praise them, thereby deceiving the sovereign. When ministers distribute their favors, the sovereign’s benevolence does not reach the people below—hence, it is said to *deceive the sovereign*—and they achieve what they desire. This is called *stirring the people*.

**5. Circulating Persuasion**
What is meant by *circulating persuasion*?
The sovereign, by nature, restricts speech and discussion, rarely listening to debates. He is easily swayed by eloquent arguments.
The royal court is separated by nine layers of gates, and the worthy and talented rarely gain access—thus, speech and debate are restricted.
As ministers, they seek out the eloquent scholars of the feudal states and nurture those skilled in persuasion within the realm, instructing them to speak privately on their behalf. They craft clever, persuasive words and smooth, flowing phrases—those whose speech is clever and pleasing, as if effortlessly flowing and executable.
They demonstrate advantages and threats, instilling fear with potential harm, and employ empty, deceptive rhetoric to corrupt the sovereign, weaving together false, insubstantial words. This is called *circulating persuasion*.

**6. Displaying Might**
What is meant by *displaying might*?
The ruler relies on his ministers and the people as his source of strength. What the ministers and people approve, the ruler approves; what they disapprove, the ruler disapproves.
As ministers, they gather armed retainers and nurture those who would die for them, making their power manifest. They make it clear that those who serve them will prosper, while those who do not will perish, thus terrifying the ministers and people to advance their private schemes—this is called *displaying might*.

**7. The Four Quarters**
What is meant by *the four quarters*?
The ruler of a small state must serve a great power, and a weak army must fear a strong one. Whatever the great power demands, the small state must comply; wherever the strong army advances, the weak must submit.
As ministers, they impose heavy taxes, exhaust the treasury, and weaken the state to serve the great power, using its threats to coerce the sovereign. In extreme cases, they raise armies to gather at the borders and extort internally; in milder cases, they repeatedly send envoys to intimidate the sovereign, causing him to fear—this is called *the four quarters*.

In all these eight methods, ministers use them to achieve their treachery, and rulers are thus obstructed, coerced, and lose what they possess. They must be vigilant against them.

**The Wise Ruler’s Precautions**
Within the palace, the ruler should enjoy their beauty but not act on their entreaties, nor allow private petitions—this prevents the first treachery of *sharing the bed*.
Regarding his attendants, he must hold them strictly accountable for their words, not allowing them to add embellishments—this prevents the second treachery of *standing at the side*.
Toward his fatherly ministers and great officials, when he listens to their counsel, he must ensure they are held responsible later—if correct, they are rewarded; if incorrect, they are punished. He must not allow reckless suggestions—this prevents the third treachery of *father and elder brother*.
Regarding entertainment and luxuries, he must ensure their sources are known—he must not allow them to be arbitrarily promoted or demoted, and the ministers must suspect his intentions—this prevents the fourth treachery of *nurturing calamity*.
*Suspect* means to measure—he must not allow them to arbitrarily advance or retreat according to his whims.
In matters of virtue and benevolence, he must open the granaries, distribute grain from the stores, and amass it like a mound. Whatever benefits the people must come from the ruler, not from private ministers—this prevents the fifth treachery of *stirring the people*.
In debates and discussions, those who praise should be commended, and those who criticize should be censured. Their abilities must be verified, and their faults examined in detail.

The ruler must not allow ministers to speak on behalf of one another. This prevents the sixth treachery of *spreading deceit*.

In matters of those who possess courage and strength, military achievements must never exceed their rewards, and private brawls must never be pardoned. Private brawls refer to those who rely on their strength to engage in private fights with others in their domain.

He must not allow ministers to engage in private financial dealings. This prevents the seventh treachery of *exerting coercive power*, whereby private financial dealings are not permitted among those of courageous strength.

In dealing with the requests of feudal lords, he must grant those that follow the law, and reject those that do not. This prevents the eighth treachery of *encouraging external schemes*.

So-called *lost sovereignty* does not mean the loss of one’s territory, but rather that even if one retains it, it is not truly one’s own. A ruler may still possess his territory, yet it is not truly his own if his ministers hold authority over it. If ministers rely on external influence to control internal affairs, then the ruler’s sovereignty is lost. When ministers use external influence to govern internally while the ruler cannot assert his own power—even lifting a finger—then the ruler’s sovereignty is certainly lost.

To heed the pleas of great states, it is for the sake of rescuing the endangered. Yet the danger is more urgent when he does not heed them. If he heeds the great states, their demands will be insatiable; they will monopolize every matter, and even then, their ambitions will not be satisfied. If he does not comply with their requests, they will find pretexts to attack. Thus, it is better to refuse them, for the peril is more imminent when he does not heed them.

Hence, he does not heed them. #20 Therefore, when ministers know that he refuses, they will not seek alliances with feudal lords. The ministers’ external dealings depend on the ruler’s willingness to listen to them, hoping to establish connections. Now that the ruler does not comply with their requests, their desire for external alliances will subside. When feudal lords know that he does not listen to their ministers, they will not accept those ministers’ false accusations. #21

Feudal lords understand that if he refuses to employ their ministers, he will not be swayed by their slanderous words to deceive and harm their own rulers.

A wise ruler establishes official ranks and rewards to encourage the virtuous and those who have achieved merit. Thus it is said: The virtuous and capable should be placed in high offices and granted substantial rewards; those with great achievements should receive honored titles and heavy compensation. When appointing officials, their abilities must be assessed; when bestowing rewards, their merits must be recognized.

Therefore, the virtuous do not falsely claim ability to serve their ruler, and those with merit take joy in advancing their accomplishments, ensuring that achievements are completed and merits established.

Now, however, it is not so: The ruler does not distinguish between the virtuous and the unworthy, nor does he properly evaluate those with merit. Instead, he relies on the influence of feudal lords, who, due to their power and status, have the authority to recommend others. The ruler then employs these recommendations.

He listens to the petitions of his attendants, allowing fathers, elder brothers, and senior ministers to request ranks and rewards from above, only to sell them below for personal gain and to cultivate private factions. Thus, those with wealth buy their way into high office, and those with connections to attendants seek influence through petitions to gain prominence.

Meritorious ministers are not evaluated, and promotions or demotions in official ranks are misguided. Therefore, officials neglect their duties while pursuing external alliances, abandoning their responsibilities for personal financial gain.

Because of this, the virtuous grow slack and unmotivated, while those with merit abandon their pursuits and simplify their efforts—this is the wind that brings about the fall of a state. *Abandon* means to ruin, or in some texts, to fall.

**The Ten Faults:**

1. To practice petty loyalty is to undermine true loyalty.
2. To seek small gains is to destroy great benefits.
3. To act arrogantly, relying on self and disregarding propriety before the feudal lords, is to court self-destruction.
4. To neglect governance while indulging in music and the five tones is to invite personal ruin.
5. To be greedy, stubborn, and covetous of profit is the root of national annihilation and self-destruction.
6. To indulge in women and music while neglecting state affairs is to invite national ruin.
7. To abandon one’s inner realm for distant travels while ignoring advisors is to court personal peril.
8. To persist in error while ignoring loyal ministers and acting solely on one’s own will is the beginning of losing one’s high reputation and becoming a laughingstock.
9. To overreach internally without measuring one’s strength and rely externally on the feudal lords is to invite the weakening of one’s state.
10. To be without propriety in a small state and disregard advisors is to invite the extinction of one’s lineage.

**What is meant by petty loyalty?**
In the past, King Gong of Chu fought against Duke Li of Jin at Yiling. The Chu army was defeated, and King Gong was wounded in the eye. During the fierce battle, the marshal Zi Fan was thirsty and asked for drink. Jian Guyang presented him with a cup of wine. Zi Fan said, *"Ah, retreat! This is wine."* Guyang replied, *"It is not wine."* Zi Fan took it and drank. Zi Fan was a man who loved wine and found it sweet, unable to resist it, and thus became drunk. After the battle ended, King Gong wished to fight again and sent someone to summon Marshal Zi Fan, but Zi Fan declined due to illness. King Gong personally went to his tent, smelled the wine, and returned, saying: *"Today’s battle, I was personally wounded. My reliance was on the marshal, yet the marshal is so drunk—this is abandoning the Chu state and its people! I shall not fight again."* Thus, he withdrew his troops and beheaded Marshal Zi Fan as a great punishment. Jian Guyang offered the wine not to harm Zi Fan, but his loyal love for the king was precisely what led to his execution. Hence, it is said: *To practice petty loyalty is to undermine true loyalty.*

**What is meant by seeking small gains?**
In the past, Duke Xian of Jin wished to borrow passage through Yu to attack Guo. Xun Xi said: *"Your Highness, if you give the Chuijie jade and the Quchan chariot to Yu Gong as tribute, and ask to borrow passage, he will certainly grant it."* The duke said: *"The Chuijie jade is a treasure of my ancestors, and the Quchan chariot is my prized steed. If he accepts my gifts but refuses passage, what then?"* Xun Xi said: *"If he refuses passage, he will not dare accept my gifts. If he accepts my gifts and grants passage, then the jade is like taking it from the inner treasury and storing it outside, and the horse is like taking it from the inner stables and placing it in the outer stables. Your Highness need not worry."* The duke said: *"Very well."*

The duke then sent Xun Xi with the **Chuijie jade** and the **Quchan chariot** as tribute to the Lord of Yu, seeking passage through his lands. The Lord of Yu, covetous of these treasures, was inclined to grant it.

**Gongyiqi remonstrated**, saying: *"Do not grant it!*

*Yu’s relationship with Guo is like that of a carriage and its wheels—wheels lean upon the carriage, and the carriage leans upon the wheels. Such is the balance of power between Yu and Guo.* If you grant passage, then Guo will fall in the morning, and Yu will follow in the evening. **Do not grant it!** I beg you, do not allow this!"

The Lord of Yu did not heed him, and thus granted passage.

When Xun Xi attacked Guo, he returned three years later and launched his forces against Yu, conquering it. Then Xun Xi led the **Quchan steed** and presented the **Chuijie jade** to Duke Xian of Jin, who was pleased and said: *"The jade is still here. Though the horse’s teeth have grown longer, it remains mine."*

**Why then did Yu’s army perish and its lands diminish?** It was because the Lord of Yu **coveted small gains without foreseeing the harm**. Hence it is said: **to seek small gains is to invite the ruin of greater ones.**

**What is meant by *xīpǐ* conduct?** In the past, King Ling of Chu held the **Assembly of Shen**, where the heir-apparent of Song arrived late and was seized and imprisoned. He also **insulted** the Lord of Xu, treating him with disdain. He detained **Jing Feng of Qi**, and the **middle archer**—the middle archer was an official rank, with three tiers: upper, middle, and lower—**remonstrated**, saying: *"When gathering the feudal lords, one must not lack propriety. This is a matter of life or death for your state!*

*In the past, Jie held the **Assembly of Youzhong**, and Youzhong rebelled against him. Zhou held the **Search of Lichiang**, and the **Rong-Di** rebelled against him. Youzhong and Lichiang were both names of states.* It was due to his lack of propriety."

The duke said: *"You must consider this matter carefully."*

The lord did not heed the remonstrance, and thus carried out his own intentions. Before a year had passed, King Ling marched southward, and his ministers followed, seizing him. King Ling starved to death at the **Qianxi** (乾溪).

Hence it is said: *"To act eccentric and self-willed, to lack propriety toward the feudal lords, is to invite the calamity of self-destruction."*

What is meant by **"good of music"**?

In the past, Duke Ling of **Wei** (卫灵公) was about to go to **Jin** (晋), and when he reached the **Pu River** (濮水), he halted his chariot, released his horses, and set up lodgings to rest. At night, he heard a new drumbeat and was pleased by it. He sent someone to ask those around him, and they all reported that they did not hear it. Then he summoned **Shī Huán** (师涓) and told him: *"There is a new drumbeat, and when I asked those around me, they all said they did not hear it. Its sound seems like that of ghosts and gods. You must listen and transcribe it for me."* Shī Huán replied: *"Yes."* Then he sat quietly, strumming his zither to transcribe it.

The next morning, Shī Huán reported: *"I have obtained it, but I have not yet practiced it. May I be allowed another night to rehearse it?"* Duke Ling said: *"Yes."* Then he stayed another night to practice it, and afterward departed for Jin. Duke Ping of Jin welcomed him at the **Shìyí Platform** (施夷之台), and when the wine was flowing freely, Duke Ling rose and said: *"There is a new sound; I wish to request it to show you."* Duke Ping said: *"Good."* Then he summoned Shī Huán and ordered him to sit beside **Shī Guāng** (师旷), who took up the zither and began to play. Before the piece was finished, Shī Guāng stopped him, saying: *"This is the sound of a doomed state—it must not be completed."* Duke Ping asked: *"Where does this Dao/Way originate?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"This was composed by **Shī Yán** (师延), who created the lascivious music for **Zhòu** (纣). When King Wǔ of Zhou attacked Zhòu, Shī Yán fled eastward and, upon reaching the Pu River, cast himself into it. Thus, anyone who hears this sound must be at the Pu River."* Those who first heard this sound were destined to see their state diminished—it must not be completed.

Duke Ping said: *"I delight in music; you must allow him to finish."* Shī Huán played the piece to its end. Duke Ping asked Shī Guāng: *"What is this sound called?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"This is called **Qīngshāng** (清商)."* Duke Ping said: *"Is **Qīngshāng** not the most sorrowful?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"Not as sorrowful as **Qīngzhēng** (清征)."* Duke Ping said: *"Can **Qīngzhēng** be heard?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"No. In ancient times, those who listened to **Qīngzhēng** were all virtuous and righteous rulers. Now, my lord’s virtue is shallow—he is not worthy to hear it. If he were to listen, it would likely bring disaster."*

Duke Ping said: *"I am old, and I delight in music. I wish to try hearing it."* Shī Guāng, having no choice, took up the zither and played. After one performance, a pair of dark **xuánhé** (玄鹤) arrived in groups of eight, following the Dao/Way, and alighting at the **Lángcè’s mound** (郎册之垝). The mound was the ridge of the roof. The second performance saw them arrange themselves in ranks. The third performance saw them stretch their necks and cry, unfurl their wings and dance. The music resonated with the **gōng** (宫), **shāng** (商), and **zhēng** (征) tones, and its sound reached the heavens. Duke Ping was greatly pleased, and all who sat with him rejoiced. Duke Ping lifted his cup and stood, offering a toast to Shī Guāng, then returned to his seat and asked: *"Is there any sound more sorrowful than **Qīngzhēng**?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"Not as sorrowful as **Qīngjiǎo** (清角)."* Duke Ping said: *"Can **Qīngjiǎo** be heard?"* Shī Guāng replied: *"No. In the past, the **Huángdì** (皇帝), the Yellow Emperor, gathered ghosts and gods atop **Tàishān** (泰山), riding a chariot drawn by six **qiúlóng** (蛟龙)—**Bìfāng** (毕方) is the name of a divine creature. He harnessed them together with **bièxiá** (并辖), and **Chīyóu** (蚩尤) stood in front, while **Fēngbó** (风伯) swept forward, **Yǔshī** (雨师) sprinkled the path, and **hǔláng** (虎狼) led the way. Ghosts and gods followed behind, **téngshé** (腾蛇) coiled upon the earth, and **Fènghuáng** (凤凰) perched above. The Yellow Emperor gathered the ghosts and gods, creating **Qīngjiǎo**. Now, my lord’s virtue is shallow—he is not worthy to hear it. If he were to listen, it would likely bring ruin."*

Duke Ping said: *"I am old, and I delight in music. I wish to hear it to the end."* Shī Guāng, having no choice, played it. After one performance, dark clouds arose from the northwest. The second performance brought a great wind and heavy rain, tearing apart the curtains and screens, shattering the sacrificial vessels and grains, collapsing the verandas and tiles. Those seated fled in terror, and Duke Ping, struck with fear, hid between the verandas. The state of Jin suffered a great drought, leaving the land parched for three years. Duke Ping fell gravely ill. Hence it is said: *"If one does not diligently attend to governance but persists in indulging the **wǔyīn** (五音)—the five musical tones—then it will lead to the exhaustion of one’s own vitality."*

What is meant by **"greed and obstinacy"**?

In the past, **Zhībó Yáo** (知伯瑶)—Zhībó was a name—led the armies of **Zhào** (赵), **Hán** (韩), and **Wèi** (魏) to attack **Fàn** (范) and **Zhōngxíng** (中行), annihilating them. After resting his troops for several years, he sent someone to demand land from Hán. Duke Kāng of Hán intended not to give it. **Duàn Guī** (段规) remonstrated, saying: *"It cannot be refused."* Zhībó was a man who loved profit and was prone to sudden anger and stubbornness. If we do not give him the land when he demands it, he will surely move his troops against Hán. You must grant it to him. If we grant it, he will become accustomed—accustomed—and then he will surely develop designs to seek more elsewhere. He will then demand land from other states, and those states will likely refuse. If they refuse, Zhībó will necessarily bring his armies against them. In this way, Hán can avoid calamity and wait for the turn of events to unfold. Duke Kāng said: *"Yes."* Then he ordered his envoy to give Zhībó one **xiàn** (县) of ten thousand households.

Zhībó was pleased and sent someone to demand land from Wèi. Duke Xuān of Wèi intended not to give it. **Zhào Jiā** (赵葭) remonstrated, saying: *"He demanded land from Hán, and Hán granted it. Now he demands land from Wèi, and Wèi refuses—this is to strengthen Wèi internally while provoking Zhībó externally. If we refuse, he will surely turn his troops against Wèi. It is better to grant it."* Duke Xuān agreed, then ordered his envoy to give Zhībó one **xiàn** of ten thousand households.

Zhībó then sent someone to Zhào, demanding the lands of **Cài** (蔡) and **Gāoláng** (皋狼)—the names of cities. Duke Xiāng of Zhào refused. Zhībó then secretly made an alliance with Hán and Wèi to attack Zhào. Duke Xiāng summoned **Zhāng Mèngtán** (张孟谈) and told him: *"Zhībó is a man of deceitful schemes and hidden plots. He has sent three envoys to Hán and Wèi, and they have granted him what he demanded, while I have not. Three envoys have been sent to make secret agreements—Zhībó surely harbors other intentions."*

Duke Xiāng said, *"If Zhībó deploys his troops against me, where shall I take refuge?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"Dòng Chǎngyú was a capable minister of a simple ruler. When he governed Jìnyáng, Yǐn Duó followed his example. Yǐn Duó was a great officer of Dòng Chǎngyú. Though his remaining teachings persist, Your Grace should only settle in Jìnyáng and await developments."*

The Duke said, *"Agreed."*

He then summoned Yánlíng Shēng and ordered him to lead the military chariots and cavalry to Jìnyáng first, while the Duke himself followed. Upon arrival, he inspected the city walls and the five departments' stores—yet the walls were unfortified, the granaries held no grain, the treasuries no coin reserves, the armories no armor or weapons, and the cities no defensive provisions.

Duke Xiāng grew fearful and called for Zhāng Mèngtán, saying, *"I have examined the city walls and the five departments' stores, yet none are adequately prepared. How shall I meet this enemy?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"I have heard that the governance of the Sage is such that provisions are entrusted to the people, not stored in treasuries and armories. Their efforts lie in cultivating the teachings, not in fortifying walls. Your Grace should issue an order: let the people bring forward three years' worth of food. Those with surplus grain should deposit it in the granaries, and those with extra provisions should store them in the treasuries. Let those with spare labor—those not engaged in essential duties—be tasked with repairing the city walls."*

*"Spare labor"* (奇) is pronounced *jī* and refers to idle men.

That evening, the Duke issued his decree. By the next day, the granaries could not contain all the grain, the treasuries overflowed with coin, and the armories received no armor or weapons. Within five days, the city walls were repaired and the defenses fully prepared.

The Duke summoned Zhāng Mèngtán and asked, *"The city walls are now fortified, the defenses complete, grain and coin abundant, and weapons in excess. Yet I still lack arrows. How shall I manage?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"I have heard that when Dòng Chǎngyú governed Jìnyáng, the walls of the palace grounds were all reinforced with reeds, rush mats, and *luóchǔ* (楛楚)—a type of wickerwork—reaching heights of up to ten feet. Your Grace should use these materials."* Upon deployment, their strength proved such that even the might of *jūn gān* (菌干)—a term for hardened soldiers—could not surpass it.

The Duke said, *"My arrows are now sufficient. But what of bronze?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"I have heard that when Dòng Chǎngyú governed Jìnyáng, he ordered the palace halls to be supported with pillars made of refined copper. Your Grace should use these materials."* Upon deployment, there was ample bronze.

With orders finalized and defenses in place, the armies of the three states arrived. They ascended Jìnyáng’s walls and engaged in battle, yet could not break through for three months. They then relaxed their forces and surrounded the city, diverting the waters of Jìnyáng to flood it. After three years of siege, the inhabitants lived in hollowed-out dwellings, hung pots to cook, and their supplies and strength nearly exhausted, the officers and soldiers weakened and sickened.

Duke Xiāng told Zhāng Mèngtán, *"Our food is scarce, our resources depleted, and our officers and soldiers are feeble and ill. I fear we cannot hold out. If we surrender the city, to which state should we yield?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"I have heard this: the lost cannot be recovered, the perilous cannot be secured. Then there is no need to value cleverness. Your Grace has missed this opportunity. I beg to attempt a covert mission—slip out and meet with the rulers of Hán and Wèi."*

Zhāng Mèngtán met with the rulers of Hán and Wèi and said, *"I have heard: when the lips perish, the teeth grow cold. Now Zhībó leads the two states in attacking Zhào; Zhào is sure to fall. If Zhào falls, the two states will be next."*

The rulers of Hán and Wèi said, *"We know this to be true. Still, Zhībó is a man of coarse nature and little affection—if we plot against him and he discovers it, disaster will surely befall us. What should we do?"*

Zhāng Mèngtán replied, *"The plan is spoken by the two states and heard only by me—no one else knows."* The rulers of Hán and Wèi then secretly agreed with Zhāng Mèngtán to betray Zhībó and set a date.

That night, they sent Zhāng Mèngtán back into Jìnyáng to report the betrayal to Duke Xiāng. The Duke welcomed him with two bows, filled with both dread and joy. The rulers of Hán and Wèi entrusted the agreement to Zhāng Mèngtán, then publicly confronted Zhībó at the gate. They encountered Zhìguò outside the gate, who noticed their unusual expressions and entered to see Zhībó, saying, *"The two states appear to have some change in mind."* Zhībó asked, *"How so?"* Zhìguò’s manner was stiff, and his demeanor arrogant—unlike his usual bearing. Zhībó said, *"You are not acting as you usually do; it is best to preempt them."*

Zhībó said, *"I have made a solemn agreement with the two lords: after breaking Zhào, we shall divide its lands into three. My reason for treating them with such favor is to ensure they will not deceive me. Their armies have been stationed at Jìnyáng for three years, and now they are on the verge of seizing their advantage—why would they suddenly harbor other intentions? This must not be so. My lord, set your mind at ease and do not speak of it."*

The next morning, the two lords again came to pay their respects and departed. They encountered Zhìguò at the gate once more. Zhìguò entered and reported, *"My lord, did you inform the two lords of my words?"*

Zhībó asked, *"How do you know?"*

Zhìguò replied, *"Today, when the two lords came to pay their respects, their expressions shifted upon seeing me. Their gaze lingered on me—this must signal a change. My lord, you should kill them."*

Zhībó said, *"Enough, do not speak of this again."*

Zhìguò insisted, *"It cannot be ignored. You must kill them. If you cannot kill them, then at least draw closer to them."*

Zhībó asked, *"How shall I draw closer?"*

Zhìguò answered, *"In Wèi, the strategist was Zhào Gě, and in Hàn, it was Duàn Guī. Both were capable of swaying their lords’ decisions. My lord, you made an agreement with the two lords: after conquering Zhào, each would be granted a county of ten thousand households. If you do this, their intentions will not stray."*

Zhībó said, *"To break Zhào and divide its lands into three, and then grant each of them a county of ten thousand households—this would leave me with too little. It cannot be done."*

Seeing that Zhībó would not listen, Zhìguò left and changed his family name to Fǔ.

On the appointed night, the Zhào clan killed the officers overseeing the dikes and released the waters to flood Zhībó’s army. As the soldiers struggled to save themselves, Hàn and Wèi attacked from the flanks, while Duke Xiāng led his troops to strike from the front. The Zhī army was utterly defeated, and Zhībó was captured.

With Zhībó dead and his army destroyed, his state was divided among the three. The world mocked them.

Thus it is said: *Greed, stubbornness, and love of gain are the roots of ruined states and self-destruction.*

What of indulging in music and women? In ancient times, the Róng king sent Yóuyú to spy on Qín. The Duke of Mù asked him, *"I have heard of the Way but have never seen it with my own eyes. I wish to know what constants allow wise rulers to gain or lose their states."*

Yóuyú replied, *"I have heard it said that frugality brings gain, while extravagance leads to loss."*

The Duke of Mù said, *"I did not ask you this out of disrespect, but you answer with frugality—why?"*

Yóuyú said, *"I have heard that in ancient times, when Yáo ruled the world, he ate from earthen bowls and drank from earthen cups. Yet his dominion stretched from Jiāozhì in the south to Yōudōu in the north, and from where the sun rose to where it set—none dared defy him. When Yáo abdicated in favor of Shùn, Shùn made his food vessels from chopped mountain wood, smoothing the axe marks with files and sandpaper. The grain was sifted, and the vessels lacquered and painted. The nobles found this excessive, and thirteen states refused to submit. When Shùn passed the throne to Yǔ, Yǔ made sacrificial vessels with blackened exteriors and red-painted interiors. He used patterned silk as mats and rush mats for seating, with carved designs. His cups and ritual vessels were adorned with inlays. This was even more extravagant, and thirty-three states refused to submit. When the Xià dynasty fell and the Shāng took power, they made grand chariots with nine tassels, carved their food vessels, and engraved their cups. Their walls were whitewashed, their mats and seats intricately patterned—this was yet more extravagance, and fifty-three states refused to submit. Though all knew of these refinements, those who wished to submit grew fewer. Thus I say: frugality is the true Way."*

Yóuyú departed, and the Duke called for the court historian Liào and said, *"I have heard that neighboring states may harbor sages, who are a danger to their enemies. Yóuyú is a sage, and I fear him. What shall I do?"*

The historian Liào said, *"I have heard that the Róng king’s lands are remote and his people have never heard the music of the Central Plains. My lord, send him women and music to disrupt his governance. Then, when you request an audience through Yóuyú, he will be distracted from advising the king. Once the king and his minister grow estranged, we can act."*

The Duke agreed. He sent Liào with eight female musicians to the Róng king and, through Yóuyú, requested an audience. The Róng king accepted.

When he saw the women, he delighted in them, set out wine, and drank daily, listening to music all year. Cattle and horses perished from neglect. Yóuyú returned and advised the king, but the king would not listen.

Yóuyú then left for Qín, where the Duke of Mù welcomed him and appointed him to the highest rank. He questioned him about military strength and terrain, then used the information to launch an attack, conquering twelve states and expanding his lands by a thousand *lǐ*.

Thus it is said: *To indulge in music and women, neglecting state affairs, is the ruin of a kingdom.*

What of abandoning one’s state to wander afar? In ancient times, Tián Chéngzǐ traveled by the sea and took pleasure in it. He issued an order to his nobles: *"Let any who speak of returning be put to death."* Yán Zhàojù said, *"My lord, you take pleasure in the sea, but what if someone plots against the state? Even if you enjoy it, how long can you hold it?"*

Tián Chéngzǐ said, *"I have decreed that those who speak of returning shall die. Now you defy my order. Draw your sword and strike me!"*

Yán Zhàojù said, *"In ancient times, Jié killed Guān Lóngróng, and Zhòu killed Wángzǐ Bǐgān. Even if you kill me, it would only be the third such act. My words are for the state, not for myself."* He extended his neck and stepped forward.

The lord then put down his sword, hurried back to his carriage, and returned. Within three days, he heard that his people were plotting against him.

Tián Chéngzǐ’s ability to seize Améi was due to Yán Zhàojù’s loyalty.

Thus it is said: *To abandon one’s state and wander far is the path to self-destruction.*

What then of failing to heed the counsel of loyal ministers? In days of old, Duke Huan of Qi united the feudal lords nine times, rectified the world, and became the foremost of the Five Hegemons, with Guan Zhong as his chief advisor.

When Guan Zhong grew old and could no longer attend to affairs, he retired to his home. Duke Huan visited him and asked, *"Master Zhong, while you rest at home, if something were to happen to you—where would governance be transferred?"*

Guan Zhong replied, *"I am old and cannot be questioned further. Still, I have heard this: no one knows their ministers as the ruler does, nor their children as a father does. Your Majesty may test this by deciding in your heart."*

The duke asked, *"What of Bao Shuya?"*

Guan Zhong said, *"Unsuitable. Bao Shuya is stubborn and defiant, standing in opposition above. His rigidity would oppress the people, his obstinacy would alienate their hearts, and his defiance would render him useless to those below. His mind is incomplete—he is no fit assistant for a hegemon."*

The duke asked, *"Then what of Zhu Tuo?"*

Guan Zhong said, *"Unsuitable. All men cherish their own lives, yet you indulge in licentiousness and favor the inner quarters. Zhu Tuo would exploit this to undermine your authority. If he does not love himself, how could he love you?"*

The duke asked, *"Then what of Prince Kaifang of Wei?"*

Guan Zhong said, *"Unsuitable. Between Qi and Wei, the journey takes no more than ten days, yet Kaifang served his lord so devotedly that for fifteen years he did not return to see his parents. This is unnatural. If he does not cherish his own kin, how could he cherish you?"*

The duke asked, *"Then what of Yi Ya?"*

Guan Zhong said, *"Unsuitable. Yi Ya prepared flavors for your lordship, and there was one thing you had never tasted—human flesh. Yi Ya boiled his own son’s head and presented it to you, as you well know. No man fails to love his child, yet Yi Ya boiled his own son to serve you as a dish. If he does not love his son, how could he love you?"*

The duke asked, *"Then who is suitable?"*

Guan Zhong said, *"Xí Péng is worthy."*

As for his character, Xí Péng was steadfast within yet modest without, desiring little yet trusting abundantly. A steadfast core made him worthy of emulation, while his outward modesty qualified him for great responsibilities. His minimal desires allowed him to govern his people with equanimity, and his abundant trust enabled him to cultivate alliances with neighboring states—such a man was the ideal minister for a ruler aspiring to hegemony. Thus, my lord, you should employ him.

The duke replied, *"Very well."*

After more than a year, Guan Zhong died, and the duke ceased to use Xí Péng, instead favoring Jiān Tuó. Tuó oversaw affairs for three years, when Duke Huan of Qi made a southern expedition to Tángfú. Jiān Tuó’s attendant, along with Yi Ya, Prince Kaifang of Wei, and the senior ministers, staged a rebellion. The duke perished from thirst and exhaustion in the southern gate’s chamber, his body left unburied in the guardhouse for three months, until worms crawled from the door. Thus, though Duke Huan’s armies once dominated the world and he was the foremost of the Five Hegemons, he ultimately met his death at the hands of his own ministers, his illustrious name ruined, and became the laughingstock of the world. Why? It was because he failed to heed Guan Zhong’s counsel.

Thus it is said: To reject the warnings of loyal ministers and act solely on one’s own will is the beginning of losing one’s noble reputation and becoming an object of ridicule.

What does it mean to *"fail to assess one’s own strength internally"*? In days past, when Qin attacked Yìyáng, the state of Hàn was in dire straits. Gōng Zhòng Péng advised the Hàn ruler: *"Our alliance cannot be relied upon—why not instead use Zhāng Yí to negotiate peace with Qin?"* He proposed bribing Qin with a named city and then, in league with Qin, launching a southern assault on Chu. This would resolve our crisis with Qin while harming our relations with Chu. Qin, having harmed our ties with Chu, the ruler said, *"Excellent."* And so, with haste and preparation, he readied for his mission to the west to negotiate with Qin.

When King Chu heard of this, he grew fearful and summoned Chén Zhěn, saying: *"Gōng Zhòng Péng of Hàn is about to negotiate with Qin in the west. What should we do now?"*

Chén Zhěn replied: *"If Qin gains one of Hàn’s cities and its trained soldiers, Qin and Hàn will unite to face Chu—this is what the Qin king has long sought in his ancestral temples. The harm this will bring to Chu is certain. My lord, you must quickly dispatch trusted envoys, send many chariots, and offer rich tribute to Hàn, saying: Though my humble state is small, its soldiers are fully mobilized. I pray that the great state of Hàn will reassure Qin of our good intentions. Let them also request that your envoys enter our borders to inspect our mustered troops."* (Here, *"信"* means *"reassurance"* or *"pledge"*—a formal affirmation.)

Hàn’s envoy arrived in Chu, and King Chu, deploying chariots and cavalry along the lower road, told the envoy: *"Report to your lord that the soldiers of my humble state are now entering your borders."*

The envoy returned and informed the Hàn ruler, who was overjoyed. He halted Gōng Zhòng Péng, but Péng said: *"This cannot be done. Qin has deceived us with truth, while Chu has rescued us with empty words. To heed Chu’s false assurances and disregard Qin’s genuine threat is to endanger our state’s foundation."*

The Hàn ruler would not listen, and Gōng Zhòng Péng, enraged, returned home and refused to attend court for ten days. Yìyáng’s siege grew more desperate, and the Hàn ruler ordered his envoys to hurry reinforcements from Chu. Though messengers came and went in endless procession, no troops arrived. Yìyáng fell, and Hàn became the laughingstock of the other states.

Thus it is said: To fail to assess one’s own strength internally while relying externally on other states is to invite the ruin of one’s nation.

What does it mean to *"be small in state yet lack propriety"*? In days past, when the Jin prince Zhòng ěr fled into exile and passed through Cáo, the ruler of Cáo stripped his upper garment and lower skirt to observe him. Lí Négǔi and Shū Zhān attended before him. Shū Zhān said to the Cáo ruler: *"I observe that this Jin prince is no ordinary man. You have treated him without proper respect. If he ever returns to power and raises an army, he will surely harm Cáo. You should kill him now."*

The Cáo ruler refused. Lí Négǔi returned home in gloom, and his wife asked: *"You have come from court with a sorrowful expression—what has happened?"*

Négǔi replied: *"I have heard that misfortune, once unleashed, does not spare even those who brought it. The ruler’s blessings may not reach me, but his calamities will."*

Today, our lord summoned the Jin prince, treating him without proper respect, and I stood before him—this is why I am sorrowful."

His wife said: *"I observe that the Jin prince is destined to be a lord of ten thousand chariots, and his attendants are ministers of equal rank. Though he is now in exile and passing through Cáo, if Cáo treats him without respect, when he returns to power, he will surely punish the disrespectful—Cáo will be the first to suffer. Why do you not prepare for this in advance?"*

Négǔi replied: *"Very well."*

The Jin prince stored yellow gold in a jar, filled it with food, and placed a jade tablet on top, then sent it to the prince at night by a messenger.

The prince, upon seeing the envoy, bowed twice and accepted the food, but declined the jade tablet.

The prince then traveled from Cáo into Chu, and from Chu into Qin.

After three years in Qin, Duke Mù of Qin summoned his ministers and deliberated: *"In the past, Duke Xiàn of Jìn had dealings with me, and this was known to all the feudal lords. Unfortunately, Duke Xiàn died, separated from his ministers, and has been gone for ten years now. His successor is unworthy, and I fear his ancestral temple will fall into ruin and his altars will no longer receive sacrifices. If this remains uncorrected, it would violate the principles of forming alliances with others. I intend to support Zhòng ěr and restore him to the throne of Jìn—what do you think?"*

All the ministers agreed it was a good idea.

The duke then raised an army: five hundred chariots of armored troops, two thousand elite cavalry—*chóu*, meaning horses of equal rank, all finely trained—five thousand infantry. With this force, he escorted Zhòng ěr back to Jìn and installed him as its ruler.

After three years on the throne, Zhòng ěr led his armies and attacked Cáo. He then sent word to the lord of Cáo: *"Hang Xuán Shū outside the city, and I will execute him as a great example."*

He also sent word to Lí Néngji: *"My troops are approaching the city walls. I know you will not disobey—though I know you dare not disobey the lord, I mean that this is not your true intention. I will mark your gate, and I command my army not to harm it."* The people of Cáo, hearing this, gathered their families and took refuge in Lí Néngji’s gate—over seven hundred households in total.

This was the power of ritual propriety.

Thus, though Cáo was a small state, caught between Jìn and Chu, its lord’s peril was as fragile as stacked eggs. Yet he ruled it with disrespect, and this was why his dynasty was cut short.

Hence it is said: *"A small state without ritual propriety, and without heeding the advice of ministers, will face the fate of being cut off from the world."*

**Han Feizi, Volume Four: *Naigu* (孤愤) #11**

The scholar of Dao and method, having no faction or allies, is alone and isolated. Thus, his talents and abilities are never fully recognized.

When Biān Shēng wailed aloud while clutching his jade, and Lord Hàn Yóu lay in bed plotting while seething with resentment—

The scholar of Dao and method must possess far-reaching insight and keen discernment. Without such discernment, he cannot expose hidden motives.

The scholar of law and rectitude must be resolute and upright. Without such strength, he cannot correct deceit.

A minister who follows orders and governs according to law does not belong to the category of **"heavy men"**—those who wield influence.

**"Heavy men"** are those who act without orders, undermine law for private gain, drain the state for their families, and yet, through sheer force, compel their lord to obey them. This is what makes them **"heavy."**

When they act arbitrarily, violating principle, their very strength can bend the lord to their will—what then of the rest?

This is what **"heavy men"** are called—those whom nobles and commoners alike hold in high regard.

The scholar of Dao and method, with his keen insight and discernment, is entrusted with authority and can expose the hidden schemes of **"heavy men."**

The scholar of law and rectitude, with his resolute strength, is entrusted with authority and can rectify the deceitful actions of **"heavy men."**

Thus, when the scholar of Dao and method is in use, the **"heavy men"** must necessarily be kept in check—meaning they will surely be removed.

This makes the scholar of Dao and method and the **"heavy men"** irreconcilable enemies—one cannot exist while the other thrives.

Since they cannot coexist, the one that survives will be their enemy.

When **"heavy men"** monopolize key positions, both the outer and inner officials will serve them.

**"Outer"** refers to the hundred officials; **"inner"** refers to the lord’s attendants. All serve the **"heavy men."**

Thus, when the feudal lords do not rely on them, their affairs are not attended to, and rival states will take up their cause.

Neighboring feudal lords, when seeking official business, if they do not go through the **"heavy men,"** their requests will not be granted—hence, the **"heavy men"** face accusations from rival states.

If the hundred officials do not rely on them, their careers stagnate, and the ministers will oppose them.

If the **Lángzhōng** (郎中) do not rely on them, they cannot gain access to the lord, and thus the attendants will conceal their misdeeds.

The **Lángzhōng** are those who reside in the central hall as the lord’s attendants.

Once they rely on the **"heavy men"** to gain access to the lord, the attendants will conceal their wrongdoing for them.

The **scholars** not relying on them leads to meager stipends and humble treatment, hence the scholars engage in **talking**—**talking** refers to praising the **"heavy men"** on their behalf.

These four assistants are how corrupt ministers adorn themselves. The **"heavy men"** cannot remain loyal to the lord while advancing their enemies; those whom the **"heavy men"** hold enmity toward are the **scholars of law and technique**. The lord cannot transcend these four assistants to discern his ministers—these ministers are also the **scholars of law and technique**. Thus, the more the lord declines, the more the great ministers grow in power.

In general, those in the **current path** toward the lord seek not to be untrusted or unloved, and they are also accustomed to old ways. The **"heavy men"** who gain the lord’s trust and affection are many, and since they have long held power, they now resent the old acquaintances. If they align with the lord’s inclinations in matters of liking and disliking, it is indeed how they advance themselves. Their offices and ranks are noble and powerful, their factions numerous, and the entire state pleads their cause—**pleading** means **persuading**. The **"heavy men’s"** actions always conform to the lord’s heart, harmonizing with his likes and dislikes. Those who have already advanced themselves hold high rank and many allies, and when they have matters to attend to, the whole state pleads their cause, then the lord, lacking virtue, punishes them.

Thus, the **scholars of law and technique** who seek to approach the lord must not rely on trusted kin or the favor of old acquaintances. They must instead use their **law and technique** to correct the lord’s biased and perverse inclinations—this is contrary to the lord’s nature. Placed in lowly and humble positions, without factions or allies, how could they compete with those who are near and trusted? The **logic** does not favor them.

The state contends with those who are new and untested against those who are familiar and established—**its logic does not favor them**.

Those who oppose the lord’s intentions and contend with his preferences are at a disadvantage, for the **heavy men** and the lord share the same inclinations—**its logic does not favor them**.

Those who pit **light and humble** against **noble and weighty**—**its logic does not favor them**.

Those who face **one voice** against **the whole realm**—the **heavy men** and the realm are allies as one faction—**its logic does not favor them**.

The **scholars of law and technique**, wielding five **unfavorable logics**, are yet never granted audience. Though their appointed time has come, they still cannot see the lord.

The **men of the moment** exploit five **advantages**, yet they alone speak before him every dawn and dusk.

Since the **scholars of law and technique** cannot gain access, the **men of the moment** alone plead their cause and cry injustice.

Thus, how can the **scholars of law and technique** find a path to advance, or when can the lord attain enlightenment?

If the **scholars of law and technique** cannot advance, then how can the lord hope to awaken?

If **advantages are inherently unequal** and **positions cannot coexist**, how can the **scholars of law and technique** avoid peril?

The **scholars of law and technique**, already burdened by **unfavorable logics** and further hindered by the **heavy men’s** dominance, must inevitably face danger and fall into calamity.

Those who can be **accused of crimes** are punished by public law. If the **scholars of law and technique** have faults that can be twisted into charges, the **heavy men** will seize upon them to condemn and execute them.

Those who cannot be **implicated by law** are hunted down with private blades. If they are without fault that can be twisted, then **righteous warriors** are summoned to strike them down, to exhaust their lives.

Those who **illuminate law and technique** yet **defy the lord above** will not perish by official execution—**they must die by private blades**.

Factions and cliques **weaken the lord above** while **flattering speech** **serves private gain**—such men will surely be trusted by the **heavy men**.

Thus, those who can **claim merit and exploit** will be **elevated by rank and honor**. If they have merit that the **heavy men** can borrow for their own use, then **rank and honor will be bestowed upon them**.

Those who cannot **be lent prestige** will be **weighted by external influence**. Even if they lack merit, they can be made to appear formidable by those near the lord’s power.

Hence, those who **weaken the lord above** and **turn toward private doors** will not shine in **rank and honor**—they must instead **grow heavy with external influence**.

*Climb* means *to approach*.

Now, if the lord **acts without consultation** and **executes without verification**, he does so against the **scholars of law and technique**, knowing neither truth nor falsehood before passing judgment.

He does not **wait to see merit** before granting rank and favor—**the heavy men** advance, and even without merit, they are first awarded rank and favor.

Thus, how can the **scholars of law and technique** hope to **avoid death** while advancing their teachings, or how can the **crafty ministers** **withdraw from gain** while seizing their opportunities?

Therefore, the lord above grows ever **more debased**, while private doors grow ever **more exalted**.

Though **Yue** may be rich in lands and strong in arms, the lords of the **Central States** all recognize it as **no benefit to themselves**, saying: *"It is not within my power to control."*

Yue is a **foreign state**, even an **enemy state**.

Now, though a state may have vast territory and many people, if the lord is **obstructed and deceived**, and the great ministers **wield sole authority**, then that state is **like Yue**.

The great ministers, **holding the state in thrall**, always harbor **plots against the lord**—they turn their own country into a **foreign state**, hence it is said: *"This state is like Yue."*

The wise do not resemble Yue, yet the unwise do not differ from their own state—**they fail to discern their likeness**.

Even if ministers **wield sole authority**, transforming the state into Yue, the lord does not **recognize his own state as identical to Yue**—this is because he **does not perceive their similarity**.

The reason the lord is said to have **lost** **Qi** is not that its lands and cities were lost—**it was because the Lü clan could not control it**, while the **Tian clan exploited it**.

The reason the lord is said to have **lost** **Jin** is not that its lands and cities were lost—**it was because the Ji clan could not control it**, while the **Six Ministers seized authority**.

Now, if the great ministers **grasp the reins** and **rule alone**, yet the lord **does not know how to reclaim** them, this is the lord’s **failure to discern**.

Not knowing how to **reclaim the reins** while they remain in the ministers’ hands, the lord allows them to **rule alone**—this is the lord’s **lack of clarity**.

Now, speaking of **Qin**.

Those who **share the same affliction as the dead** cannot be **revived**; those who **share the same fate as a lost state** cannot be **preserved**.

If one **follows the footsteps of Qi and Jin**, yet desires the state to **remain secure and intact**, this is impossible.

*Follow* means *to emulate*.

In general, the **difficulty of implementing law and technique** is not confined to **great states**—even **small states** face the same.

The lord’s attendants need not be **wise**; if the lord **deems a man wise** and **listens to him**, then **consulting him with his own attendants**, it is as if **a fool were judging wisdom**.

The lord’s attendants need not be **virtuous**; if the lord **deems a man virtuous** and **honors him**, then **discussing his conduct with his own attendants**, it is as if **the unworthy were evaluating virtue**.

The wise **determine policies** before the foolish, and the virtuous **set the course** before the unworthy—then the **virtuous and wise** will **be shamed**, and the lord’s **judgments will be perverse**.

Those ministers who **seek office** will **refine their conduct** and **strengthen their integrity** to **fortify their persons**. *Refined conduct* refers to those who **cultivate their own virtue**.

The **wise** will **advance through eloquence and debate**.

The **wise** will not **accept bribes**—since they **cultivate virtue**, they **do not use wealth** to **curry favor**.

Relying on their **refined integrity**, yet **still unable to bend the law** for their purposes—since they **are refined**, they **cannot pervert the law**.

The **wise** do not **repeat their arguments**—*this seems to omit text*.

Thus, the **virtuous and wise** will **not serve the lord’s attendants**, nor **hear their petitions**.

The lord’s attendants **do not act like the Earl of Bi**—they **cannot find what they seek**, nor **receive bribes**, so the **eloquent debates** cease, and **slanderous accusations** arise.

*Eloquence* refers to the **refined integrity** of the virtuous, and *debate* refers to the **wise** in their **persuasive speech**.

The **function of governing chaos** rests with those **near and trusted**—*governing chaos* refers to the **wise** in their **eloquence and ability** to **restore order**.

「The **refined integrity** of conduct is determined by praise and blame—then the **virtuous and wise officials** will be discarded, and the **lord’s discernment** will be obstructed.

The **virtuous and wise** can **awaken the lord’s insight**—now that they are discarded and not employed, the lord’s discernment will be self-obstructed.

If **merit and achievement** are not used to **judge the virtue and wisdom** of officials, then **merit and achievement** should be used to **judge them**. *Accumulating merit* is called *achievement*.

If **collateral verification** is not used to **investigate crimes**, then **investigation of crimes** should rely on **collateral verification**. *Collateral* refers to **cross-examining witnesses**; *verification* refers to **pairing and confirming** evidence.

Yet if the lord **listens to the words** of his **attendants and trusted advisors**, then **incompetent men** will be present in the court, and **foolish and corrupt officials** will be placed in office.

Since the **attendants and trusted advisors** are all **petty men**, they **seek like-minded allies** and **echo similar voices**; thus, those they hold close are **incompetent**, and those they favor are **foolish and corrupt**. And once they have been favored and trusted, they will certainly be **employed in the court** and **appointed to offices**.

The **calamities of a great kingdom** lie in **overbearing great ministers**, and the **calamities of a lesser kingdom** lie in **excessive trust in attendants**—these are the **public afflictions** of the lord.

*Public* means **rightful**; thus, these are the **rightful afflictions** of the lord.

Moreover, when **subjects have crimes**, and when the **lord has great losses**, the **interests of the lord and subjects differ**. How does this manifest?

It is said: The lord’s **interest** lies in **tasking competent men** with office, while the **subject’s interest** lies in **remaining incompetent yet securing employment**.

The lord’s **interest** lies in **honoring those who labor** with rank and reward, while the **subject’s interest** lies in **gaining wealth and nobility without merit**.

The lord’s **interest** lies in **empowering the bold and talented**—*bold and talented men* are those with **virtue and ability**, then **employed** by the lord.

The **subject’s interest** lies in **using factional connections** to **advance private agendas**.

Thus, when **land is diminished** in the state yet **private families grow rich**, when the **sovereign is humbled** yet **great ministers grow powerful**, the lord **loses authority** while the **subjects gain dominion**, and the **lord becomes a tributary of his ministers**—*tributary* here refers to the **lord’s subservience to his ministers**, hence the **easy reversal of positions**.

The **chancellor’s office** issues **sealed appointments**—*chancellor’s office* refers to **high-ranking household officials**, and *sealed appointments* means **granting exclusive authority to appoint officials** and **issuing official symbols** of office.

This is how **subjects deceive the lord** and **facilitate their own private gain**.

*Deceive* means **to mislead**; they **fabricate schemes** to **confuse and mislead** the lord.

Thus, in the **current age**, many **powerful ministers**—those who **alter the lord’s resolve** through **deception and flattery**—are **fixed in favor**, numbering **no more than two or three out of ten**.

*Alter* refers to **changing the lord’s intentions** through **deception and flattery**; hence, **only two or three out of ten** attain such favor, so it is said **no more than two or three out of ten**.

What is the **reason for this**?

The **crimes of subjects** are **great**.

---

**臣有大罪者，其行欺主也，其罪当死亡也。**
Those who serve with grave offenses—**their deeds deceive the lord**—**their crime deserves death.**

**智士者远见，而畏於死亡，必不从重人矣。**
**Men of wisdom** perceive the distant consequences and, **fearing death**, will **never follow the powerful.**

**贤士者修廉，而羞与奸臣欺其主，必不从重人矣。**
**Virtuous men** uphold integrity and **shame to conspire with corrupt ministers to deceive their lord**—they **will never follow the powerful.**

**是当涂者之徒属，非愚而不知患者，必污而不避奸者也。**
Thus, the **favorites of the age**—their **accomplices**—are **not fools ignorant of peril**, but **corrupt and unscrupulous**, **avoiding no evil.**

**重人所为必不轨，故智士恐与同之，廉士羞与之欺主，莫有从之游者。**
The **powerful act without restraint**; thus, **men of wisdom fear association**, and **virtuous men shame to conspire with them in deceiving the lord**—**none dare join their ranks.**

**同恶相济，故与之为徒属者必污愚之人也。**
**Those who share in vice reinforce one another**; thus, **those who follow them as accomplices must be corrupt and foolish.**

**大臣挟愚污之人，上与之欺主，下与之收利侵渔，朋党言侵夺百姓，若渔者之取鱼也。**
**Powerful ministers**, **harboring foolish and corrupt men**, **deceive the lord above** and **plunder profits below**, **colluding in factions to seize the people’s wealth**—**like fishermen taking fish.**

**比周，相与阿党为比，忠信为周也。**
**Allying as "comparable"**—**they falsely claim kinship**, **calling loyalty and trust their "comparable" allies.**

**比周者，言以阿党之人为忠信与亲也。**
**"Comparable"** means **taking flatterers as loyal and trusted kin.**

**一口，惑主败法，以乱士民，雷同是非，故曰一口。**
**"One voice"**—**they confuse the lord and undermine the law**, **disrupting the people**, **echoing false judgments**—hence, **"one voice."**

**使国家危削，主上劳辱，此大罪也。**
**They endanger the state**, **weary and humiliate the lord**—**this is a grave crime.**

**臣有大罪而主弗禁，此大失也。**
**When ministers commit grave crimes and the lord fails to restrain them**, **this is a great failing.**

**使其主有大失於上，臣有大罪於下，索国之不亡者，不可得也。**
**If the lord fails above and ministers offend below**, **seeking a state that does not perish is impossible.**

**说难第十二**
**The Difficulties of Persuasion (Chapter Twelve)**

**夫说者有逆顺之机，顺以招福#5，逆而制祸，失之毫厘，差之千里，以此说之所以难也。**
**Persuasion has moments of harmony and discord**; **harmony invites fortune**, **discord averts disaster**—**a misstep by a hair’s breadth can diverge by thousands of miles**—**thus, persuasion is so difficult.**

**凡说之难，非吾知之，有以说之之难也。**
**The difficulty of persuasion lies not in my knowledge**, but in **how to persuade**—**this is the true difficulty.**

**不知而说，虽忠见疑，故曰非吾知之说之难也。**
**If I speak without knowledge**, **even loyalty will be met with doubt**—**thus, the difficulty is not in my knowledge of persuasion.**

**又非吾辩之，能明吾意之难也。**
**Nor is it my eloquence**; **the difficulty lies in making my meaning clear.**

**吾虽不自辩数，则能明吾所说之意，如此者万不一，有所以则为难也。**
**Even if I do not argue excessively**, **to make my intended meaning clear**—**such cases are rare, one in ten thousand**—**this is the true difficulty.**

**又非吾敢横失，而能尽之难也。**
**Nor is it my daring to speak boldly**; **the difficulty lies in fully conveying the intent.**

**吾之所说，其不可循理，非敢横失，能尽此意亦复难有。**
**What I say may defy reason**; **though I dare not speak recklessly**, **to fully express this intent is also difficult.**

**凡说之难，在知所说之心，可以吾说当之。**
**The difficulty of persuasion lies in knowing the listener’s intent**, **so that my words align with theirs.**

**既知所说之心，则能随心而发唱，故所说能当。**
**Once I know the listener’s intent**, **I can speak in accordance**, **and thus my words will resonate.**

**所说出於为名高者也，而说之以厚利，则见下节而遇卑贱，必弃远矣。**
**If the listener seeks high reputation**, **and I persuade with great profit**, **he will perceive my low integrity and treat me with contempt**—**he will surely reject and distance himself.**

**所说之人意在名高，今以厚利说之，彼则为己志节凡下，而以卑贱相遇。**
**The listener’s intent is on high reputation**; **if I persuade with great profit**, **he will deem my principles base** and **treat me with disdain.**

**亦既贱之，必弃遗而疏远矣。**
**Once he deems me lowly**, **he will abandon and distance himself.**

**所说出於厚利者也，而说之以名高，则见无心而远事情，必不收矣。**
**If the listener seeks great profit**, **and I persuade with high reputation**, **he will see my words as insincere and distant from practical matters**—**he will surely reject them.**

**所说之人意在厚利，今以名高说之，此则为己无相时之心而阔远事情矣。**
**The listener’s intent is on great profit**; **if I persuade with high reputation**, **he will perceive my words as lacking timely relevance and remote from practical concerns.**

**如此则必见弃而不收矣。**
**Thus, he will surely reject and dismiss my words.**

**所说阴为厚利而显为名高者也，而说之以名高，则阳收其身而实疏之，说之以厚利，则阴用其言显弃其身矣。**
**If the listener secretly seeks profit but publicly seeks high reputation**, **and I persuade with reputation**, **he will outwardly accept me but inwardly distance himself**; **if I persuade with profit**, **he will secretly use my words while publicly rejecting me.**

**所说之人，内阴为厚利，外阳为名高，今见其外说以名高，彼虽阳收其身，内实疏远，若察知其内，说以厚利，则私用其言，外明弃其身以饰其名高也。**
**The listener, inwardly seeking profit but outwardly seeking reputation**, **if I speak to his outward self with reputation**, **he may outwardly accept me but inwardly distance himself**; **if I discern his true intent and speak of profit**, **he will privately use my words while publicly rejecting me to uphold his reputation.**

**此不可不察也。**
**This must be carefully observed.**

**夫事以密成，语以泄败，未必其身泄之也，而语及所匿之事，如此者身危。**
**Matters succeed through secrecy**; **speech reveals failure**—**not necessarily by the speaker’s own disclosure**, but **if I mention what was concealed**, **my life will be in danger.**

**所说之人，其所谋事，身虽不泄谋，说者泛语言及所匿，似若说者先知其事，今以发动之，既怀此疑，其身必危矣。**
**The listener’s plotted affairs**, **though he does not reveal them himself**, **if I casually mention what was hidden**, **it will seem I knew beforehand and exposed him**—**once suspicion takes root, my life will be in danger.**

**彼显有所出事，而乃以成他故，说者不徒知所出而已矣，又知其所以为，如此者身危。**
**If he openly acts for one purpose but claims another**, **I do not merely know his outward action**—**I also know his true intent**—**thus, my life will be in danger.**

**所说之人，显出其事有所避讳，乃托以他故，而说者深知其事，既所出入知所为，所说既知情，露必有危己之心。**
**The listener, though he publicly acts with caution**, **pretends another motive**; **if I deeply understand his true intent**, **knowing both his outward and inward actions**, **he will suspect I know his hidden motives and seek to harm me.**

**规异事而当，知者揣之外而得之，事泄於外，必以为己也，如此者身危。**
**If I advise on unusual matters and hit upon the truth**, **a clever man may deduce it from external clues**, **and if the matter is revealed**, **he will assume I leaked it**—**thus, my life will be in danger.**

**说者为君规谋异事，而智谋之士当知此者，自外揣之，遂得其谋，因泄於外，君则疑己漏之，便以为不密而加诛也。**
**If I advise the lord on unusual strategies**, **a clever strategist may deduce them from external signs**, **and if the plan is leaked**, **the lord will suspect I betrayed him**—**he will then accuse me of indiscretion and punish me.**

**周泽未渥也，而语极知，说行而有功则德忘，说不行而有败则见疑，如此者身危。**
**If the lord’s favor has not yet fully settled**, **and I speak with excessive precision**, **if my persuasion succeeds and bears fruit, my merit will be forgotten**; **if it fails, I will be suspected**—**thus, my life will be in danger.**

**君之於己，周给之泽未有渥厚，遂以知之，极妙而以语之，行说有功犹忘其德，若不行有败，则羞始生焉，此正危身之道也。**
**The lord’s favor toward me has not yet fully settled**; **if I speak with excessive precision**, **if my persuasion succeeds, my merit will be forgotten**; **if it fails, shame will arise**—**this is the path to endangering myself.**

**贵人有过端，而说者明言礼义以挑其恶，如此者#6身危。**
**If a noble has a fault**, **and I openly speak of propriety and righteousness to provoke his shame**, **my life will be in danger.**

**挑，谓发扬也。**
***"Provoking"** means **exposing and magnifying it.**

**贵人或得计而欲自以为功，说者与知焉，如此者身危。**
**If a noble achieves success and seeks to claim it as his own merit**, **and I am aware of it**, **my life will be in danger.**

**强以其所不能为，止以其所不能已，如此者身危。**
**To urge what he cannot accomplish**, **or restrain what he cannot stop**—**this is dangerous.**

**不能而强，不以而止，必以不讨而兴怒，故危也。**
**To force what he cannot do**, **or halt what he cannot stop**, **will surely provoke his wrath without justification**—**thus, it is dangerous.**

Thus, when discussing great men with him, he will suspect me of **replacing him**.
*"Replacing"* means **substituting**.

To discuss great men, one must speak of their **virtue and boundless Dao**, but he will take it as **recommending another to replace him**.

When discussing lesser men, he will think I am **selling my influence**.
To discuss lesser men, one must speak of their **skills and petty talents**, but he will take it as **belittling them to sell my influence**.

To speak of what he loves will be seen as **borrowing his favor**.
This means **using what the lord loves as leverage for myself**.

To speak of what he has achieved will be seen as **testing me**.
*"Testing"* means **probing**.

To speak of what the lord hates will be seen as **testing my anger’s depth**.
To speak directly of his words will be seen as **lacking wisdom and clumsiness**.
*"Direct"* means **blunt**.

To debate minutiae will be seen as **excessive familiarity**.
*"Rice and salt"* refers to **accumulated trivialities**—to speak of **varied minor matters** will be seen as **my excessive familiarity**.

To briefly state my intent will be seen as **cowardice and hesitation**.
To **roughly outline the matter and intent** will be seen as **my fear and reluctance**, as if I dare not speak fully.

To elaborate broadly will be seen as **vulgarity and insolence**.
*"Elaborate"* means **to expound**.
If I **widely expound** on the matter without restraint, he will take it as **crude, vulgar, and disrespectful**.

This difficulty of persuasion must be understood.

The essence of persuasion lies in **adornment**—**exalting what he values and concealing what he despises**.
To persuade him, one must **know what he prizes and amplify it**, **know what he shames and suppress it**, thus aligning with his will without contradiction.

If he has **private urgency**, I must **demonstrate public duty to compel him**.
If his **intent is weak** yet he cannot stop himself, I must **adorn its virtue while minimizing its flaw**.

If persuasion succeeds but he has **private matters**, and he wishes to act urgently, I must **present public duty to urge him forward**.
Though his **private intent follows me**, yet he cannot stop it—then I **adorn the virtue of abandoning private gain**, and **frame his inability to comply with public duty as a fault**, thus **stirring him to uphold the public good**.

If his **heart is lofty** yet his ability cannot match, I must **expose his failures**, **reveal his flaws**, and **multiply his shortcomings**.
If his **persuasion relies on high public virtue** but his **capacity cannot reach it**, then I **highlight his private failings**, **expose his betrayal of the public**, and **frame his inability to act as a multitude of errors**, thus **fulfilling his lofty intent**.

If he **boasts of wisdom**, I must **cite analogous yet different cases**, **providing ample ground** for him to **borrow my persuasion**, while **pretending ignorance** to **augment his cleverness**.
If he **prides himself on broad wisdom**, I must **offer many varied yet analogous cases** to **expand his reasoning**, so he **takes persuasion from me**, while I **feign ignorance**, thus **aiding his intelligence**.

If I wish to **win his inner trust**, I must **glorify his name** while **subtly showing its alignment with private gain**.
To **gain his inner care**, I must **display the virtue’s name**, **prove he can fulfill it**, and **subtly suggest that this virtue benefits him privately**—thus, he will **truly trust and reciprocate**.

If I wish to **present dangerous matters**, I must **expose their ruin** while **subtly revealing their private harm**.
To **warn of danger**, if there are **detractors**, I must **speak openly** while **subtly hinting at private calamity**—thus, he will **test sincerity**.

To **praise others who share his path**, or to **plan matters aligned with his strategy**.
If one **shares his disgrace**, I must **greatly adorn its harmlessness**.
If one **shares his failure**, I must **clearly adorn its lack of loss**.
If I **extend praise to others who align with him**, or **plan matters that match his strategy**, and if their **actions bring him disgrace**, I must **elaborately adorn its innocence**, saying *"what harm is in this disgrace?"*
If their **plans bring him failure**, I must **clearly adorn its lack of loss**, saying *"what loss is in this failure?"*
Thus, I **position myself as a virtuous supplement**, **elevating his reputation**.

If he **boasts of his strength**, do not **measure him by difficulty**.
If he **prides himself on his origins**, I must **commend him**—do not **obstruct him with his shortcomings**.

If he **brags of decisive action**, do not **provoke his anger with past faults**.
If he **claims his strategies as wisdom**, do not **expose his past failures**.
All these are ways to **shield his weaknesses** and **nurture his sharpness**, so persuasion causes no harm.

When **intentions align without friction** and **words flow without conflict**, then **full debate may unfold**.
If **intentions are unopposed** and **words unchallenged**, then **wisdom and eloquence can flourish**.
This is the **Dao** by which one **gains proximity without suspicion** and **fully expresses oneself**.

**Yi Yin** served as steward, **Baili Xi** became a slave—both were **ways to approach their superiors**.
These two **trusted themselves to menial roles** to **seek advancement**.
Though both were **sages**, they **still could not avoid degrading themselves**—such was their **humility**.
Now, if I **use my words as a steward or slave**, yet **gain audience and transform the world**, this is **not a shame for those who seek office**.

If **time passes and favor remains shallow**, *"shallow"* means **prolonged**.

「*"Shallow"* means **prolonged**—**time** and **distance** grow vast.

**Deeply consider** yet **not suspect**, **draw forth contention** yet **not punish**—then **clearly delineate benefits and harms** to **fulfill their purpose**, and **sever connections**.
**Directly point out right and wrong** to **adorn one’s own standing**—*"directly point out"* means **speaking without evasion**.
*"Adorn one’s standing"* refers to **maintaining honor and glory** with **favor and rewards** to uphold oneself.
By this means, **mutual reliance is established**—this is how **persuasive speech succeeds**.
The **ruler** thus **remains undoubting and unpunishing** to **secure his subjects**, while the **subjects** **strive to fulfill their purpose** and **adorn their standing** to **offer loyalty**—hence, **mutual reliance**.
In ancient times, **Duke Wu of Zheng** wished to attack **Hu**, so first he **married his daughter to the Hu ruler** to **soothe his intentions**.
Then he **asked his ministers**: *"I wish to use force—who is fit to attack?"*
The **minister Guan Si** replied: *"Hu can be attacked."*
The duke, **enraged**, **executed him**, saying: *"Hu is a brotherly state—why speak of attacking it?"*
The **Hu ruler**, hearing this, **regarded Zheng as a close ally**, and thus **did not prepare defenses** against Zheng.
Zheng **ambushed Hu** and **seized it**.

In **Song**, there was a **wealthy man**. When **heaven rained down mud**, his son said: *"If we do not repair it, thieves will surely come."*
The **father of his neighbor** also spoke thus.
That night, **theft occurred**, and much of his wealth was lost—**the thief arrived that very evening**, so the loss was great.
His family **praised their son’s wisdom**, yet **doubted the neighbor’s father**.
These two **speakers were both correct**, yet the **one held dear was punished**, while the **one slighted was doubted**—the two refer to **Guan Si** and the **neighbor’s father**.
Duke Wu of Zheng **punished his dear one** to **ensure Hu would not suspect him**.
The wealthy man **doubted his slighted neighbor** because **he did not share the same concern**.
Thus, **knowing the truth is not difficult**, but **applying that knowledge appropriately is**.

**Guan Si’s words were correct**, yet he **became a sage in Jin** and **was executed in Qin**—this **must not be overlooked**.
Jin **deviously obtained** the **scholar Si Hui from Qin**, and **Guan Si presented him with a staff**, saying:
*"My plans were not adopted, yet my words were not incorrect.
Though Jin **regarded him as a sage**, Qin **later executed him for his speech**—this too was **misapplying knowledge**."*

In ancient times, **Mizi Que** was **favored by the ruler of Wei**.
By the **laws of Wei**, **stealing the ruler’s carriage was punishable by amputation**.
When **Mizi Que’s mother fell ill**, people **urged him to inform her at night**, so he **falsely claimed the ruler’s carriage** and went out.
The ruler **heard of it** and **praised his filial piety**, saying:
*"How filial! For his mother’s sake, he **forgot the amputation penalty**."
Later, when **Mizi Que’s beauty faded and favor waned**, he **fell into disgrace with the ruler**.
The ruler said: *"He **once falsely claimed my carriage**, and **once shared his leftover fruit with me**."
Thus, **Mizi Que’s conduct did not change from the beginning**, yet **he was once praised and later condemned**—this was due to **the ruler’s shifting affections**.
When the **ruler holds affection**, **wise speech brings closer favor**; when the **ruler holds aversion**, **wise speech, if not fitting, brings punishment and estrangement**.
Thus, **those who counsel and persuade must discern the ruler’s affections** before speaking.

The **dragon**, though **a serpent**, is **gentle enough to be approached and ridden**—yet beneath its throat is a **scale of resentment, a span long**.
If **anyone dares to touch it**, the dragon **will surely kill**.
**Rulers too have scales of resentment**—if **persuaders avoid touching their ruler’s resentment**, they **will be safe**.

**The And Family’s Jade (He Shi’s Gem)**
The **And family’s jade-cutter** found a **rough jade stone** in the **mountains of Chu** and **offered it to King Li of Chu**.
King Li **sent a jade expert to examine it**, who said: *"It is stone."*
The king **took the And family’s man for deceit**, and **had his left foot amputated**.
When **King Li died**, **King Wu ascended the throne**, and the And family’s man **again presented the rough jade**.
King Wu **sent a jade expert to examine it**, who **again declared it stone**.
The king **took him for deceit once more**, and **had his right foot amputated**.
When **King Wu died**, **King Wen took the throne**, and the And family’s man **clasped his rough jade and wept beneath Chu’s mountains** for **three days and three nights**.
His **tears ran dry**, and **he wept blood instead**.
The king **heard of it** and **sent someone to ask the reason**, saying:
*"Many in the world have had their feet amputated—why do you weep so bitterly?"*
The And family’s man replied:
*"I do not weep for the amputation—**I weep for the precious jade being labeled as stone**, and for the **virtuous man being called a deceiver**—this is why I weep."*
The king **then ordered the jade expert to refine the stone**, and **a treasure was revealed**.
Thus, it was **named the And Family’s Jade (He Shi’s Gem)**.

**Jewels and jade are what rulers desire most**—though the And family’s man **offered rough jade unrefined**, it **did not harm the king**.
Yet **his feet were twice amputated before his worth was recognized**—**such is the difficulty of proving one’s treasure**.
Now, **the ruler’s need for law and technique** is **not necessarily as urgent as jade**, yet he **prohibits ministers and commoners from private scheming**.
Then **those who follow the Dao** **are not yet persecuted**—it is simply that **the ruler’s rough jade has not yet been presented**.

When **the ruler employs technique**, **great ministers cannot arbitrarily decide**, and **favorites dare not sell influence**.
When **officials enforce the law**, **the corrupt flee to farming**, and **wandering scholars perish in battle**.
Thus, **law and technique become the ruin of ministers and commoners**.
The **ruler cannot overturn ministers’ opinions**, **nor suppress the people’s slander**, **but he alone can harmonize with Daoic speech**.
Then **even if those who uphold law and technique meet death**, the **Dao will still not be recognized**.

In ancient times, **Wu Qi instructed King Xiao of Chu** on **Chu’s customs**, saying:
*"Great ministers hold too much weight, and **feudal lords are too numerous**—if this continues, **the ruler will be hemmed in by his ministers**, while **the people will be oppressed**.
This is the **path that leads to poverty and weak armies**.
It would be better to **confiscate noble titles after three generations**, **abolish the hereditary ranks of officials**, and **reduce unnecessary branches of government**—thus **supporting the selection and training of talented men**."*

「When the year had passed and King Xiao of Chu died, Wu Qi was dismembered limb by limb in Chu. Shang Jun taught King Xiao Gong of Qin about *lian shi wu* (連什伍), setting penalties for failing to report crimes, burning the *Poetry* and *Books* to emphasize laws and decrees, blocking private petitions while promoting public labor, and prohibiting idle officials while elevating those skilled in tillage and warfare. King Xiao Gong implemented these measures, and the ruler was honored and secure, while the state grew wealthy and powerful. After eight years, he died, and Shang Jun was executed by chariot dismemberment in Qin.

Chu, which did not adopt Wu Qi’s teachings, fell into disorder and decline, while Qin, which followed Shang Jun’s laws, flourished in wealth and strength. The words of these two men were indeed correct, yet why was Wu Qi dismembered and Shang Jun chariot-dismembered? It was because the great ministers resented the law, and the common people hated governance. In the present age, great ministers are greedy for power, and the common people are content with chaos—even more so than in Qin and Chu’s times—while rulers lack the attentive ears of King Xiao of Chu or King Xiao Gong of Qin. Then, how could those who uphold law and technique endure the same perils as these two men did and still make their teachings known?

This is why the world remains in disorder, with no sovereigns rising as *conquerors* (霸王).

**Chapter 14: Delinquent Ministers and Usurpation (奸劫弒臣)**
All delinquent ministers seek to align with the ruler’s inclinations to gain favor and power. Thus, when the ruler has a virtue, they follow by praising it; when the ruler has an aversion, they follow by condemning it. In general, men who share the same inclinations toward acceptance or rejection will agree, while those who differ will oppose.

Now, what ministers praise is what the ruler approves—this is called *same acceptance* (同取). What ministers condemn is what the ruler disapproves—this is called *same rejection* (同舍). One has never heard of acceptance and rejection being in harmony while opposing each other; this is the way ministers gain favor and trust through flattery.

When delinquent ministers exploit the ruler’s trust to slander or praise, advancing or demoting officials, the ruler is not one who employs *skills and calculations* (術數) to govern them, nor does he verify their words through *cross-examination and evidence* (參驗). He will inevitably be deceived by past flatterers and believe the present words of those who seek his favor. This is how delinquent ministers succeed in deceiving the ruler and serving their own interests.

Thus, the ruler is inevitably deceived from above, while ministers grow ever more powerful below—these are the ministers who *monopolize the ruler* (擅主之臣). When a state has ministers who monopolize the ruler, then the common subjects cannot fully expend their wisdom and strength to present their loyalty, nor can the officials of all departments faithfully uphold the law to achieve their duties.

How can this be made clear? Men naturally seek safety and benefit while avoiding danger and harm—this is human nature. Now, if a minister fully expends his wisdom and strength to serve the ruler, striving to present his loyalty, his own family will be impoverished and his kin will suffer harm. But if he pursues private gain to exploit the ruler, using wealth and bribes to curry favor with the powerful ministers, his own family will be honored and rich, and his kin will enjoy their blessings. Who would abandon the path of safety and benefit to court danger and harm?

Governance like this is clearly flawed, yet the ruler wishes the subjects below to have no delinquency, and the officials to faithfully uphold the law—this is an impossible expectation.

Thus, the ruler’s close attendants know that loyalty and sincerity cannot bring them safety, so they say: *"I serve the ruler with loyalty and sincerity, accumulating merits and labor to seek security—this is like a blind man trying to discern the distinction between black and white, and it will never succeed."* If one follows the *Dao* (道) to transform and uphold proper principles, not seeking wealth and honor to serve the ruler and thus gain safety, this is like a deaf man trying to distinguish between clear and muddy sounds—that is even less likely to succeed.

Since neither of these paths can bring safety, how could I not resort to *comparing and flattering* (比周), *obscuring the ruler* (蔽主上), and *pursuing private gain* (奸私) to suit the ruler’s favor? This is inevitable. Likewise, the officials of all departments know that uprightness cannot bring them safety, so they say: *"I serve the ruler with purity and integrity to seek safety—this is like trying to make a square and a circle without any rules, and it will never succeed."* If I uphold the law without forming factions and govern my department properly to seek safety, this is like trying to scratch one’s head with one’s feet—that is even less likely to succeed.

Since neither of these paths can bring safety, how could I not disregard the law and pursue private gain to suit the ruler’s favor? This is inevitable.

Thus, those who prioritize private gain are numerous, while those who serve the ruler through the law are few. Therefore, the ruler is isolated above, while ministers form factions below—this is how Tian Cheng (田成) usurped and killed Duke Jian of Qi (齊簡公).

Now, one who possesses *skills and calculations* (術數) as a minister can present *measured and strategic words* (度數之言), making the ruler’s laws clear above and constraining delinquent ministers below, thereby honoring the ruler and securing the state. Thus, when *measured and strategic words* are effective in the ruler’s presence, then rewards and punishments will certainly be applied afterward.

Men’s words become clear through the *art of the sage* (聖人之術), yet they do not conform to the *common opinions of the age* (世俗之言). They follow *name and reality* (名實) to determine right and wrong, and rely on *cross-examination and evidence* (參驗) to judge speech and words.

Thus, the ruler’s close attendants know that deceit and falsehood cannot bring them safety, so they say: *"I will not abandon private gain and exploit the ruler’s favor. I will not flatter and compare to seek safety, but instead fully expend my wisdom and strength to serve the ruler—this is like carrying a weight of ten thousand *jin* (釼) and plunging into an unfathomable abyss while seeking life, and it will never succeed."* The officials of all departments also know that pursuing private gain cannot bring them safety, so they say: *"I will not serve the ruler with purity and integrity, nor uphold the law. Instead, I will use a corrupt heart to pervert the law for private gain—this is like standing at the edge of a high cliff and falling into a deep ravine below while seeking life, and it will never succeed."*

The paths of safety and danger are so clear, yet the ruler’s close attendants cannot be deceived by idle words, nor can the officials dare to exploit the people through greed. Thus, ministers can present their loyalty without obstruction, and the subjects can fulfill their duties without resentment.

This is how Guan Zhong (管仲) governed Qi and how Shang Jun (商君) strengthened Qin.

From this perspective, one can see that the sages govern the state not by relying on others to love them, but by employing methods that compel people to love them instead.»

To rely on others loving you is perilous, but to rely on what cannot but be done is secure.

The bond between ruler and minister is not one of blood or kinship. If righteousness brings advantage, then ministers will exert themselves in service. If righteousness brings no security, then ministers will act privately to curry favor above.

An enlightened ruler understands this, and thus establishes the ways of reward and punishment to demonstrate to the world—nothing more.

Thus, even if the ruler does not verbally instruct his officials nor personally seek out deceit, the state will already be well-ordered.

A sovereign is not one whose eyes are as keen as Li Lou’s nor whose ears are as sharp as Shi Kuang’s. If one relies solely on vision without its full capacity, what is seen will be little—this is no sound method. If one does not harness the power of authority but instead waits for hearing alone, what is heard will be sparse—this is no trustworthy path.

An enlightened ruler makes the world unable not to see for him, unable not to hear for him. Thus, though he resides in the secluded palace, his insight illuminates the four seas, and the world cannot deceive or conceal itself from him. Why? Because the ways of chaos are abandoned, and the power of clarity thrives.

Therefore, those who skillfully wield authority bring stability to the state, while those who fail to harness it invite danger. In ancient Qin, the custom was for rulers and ministers to disregard the law in favor of private favoritism, and thus the state fell into disorder, its armies weakened, and its ruler diminished in prestige.

Shang Jun persuaded Duke Xiao of Qin to reform the laws and customs, establishing public justice, rewarding those who exposed crimes, discouraging frivolous pursuits while favoring essential labor. At that time, the Qin people were accustomed to old ways—where crimes could be pardoned and merit could bring honor—so they lightly violated the new laws.

Thus, those who broke them faced severe and certain punishment, while informants received generous and trustworthy rewards. Consequently, no crime went undetected, and many were executed, causing widespread resentment and daily reports of grievances. Duke Xiao refused to relent and carried out Shang Jun’s laws. Only later did the people realize that crimes would surely be punished and that private deceit was rampant, so none dared transgress, and punishments were rarely applied.

Thus, the state was governed, its armies strengthened, its lands expanded, and its ruler honored. This was because the penalties for concealing crimes were severe, and the rewards for exposing them were substantial—this too was a way to make the world see and hear for him.

The methods of perfect governance have been made clear, yet scholars of the world fail to recognize them.

Moreover, the foolish scholars of this age do not understand the nature of order and chaos. They merely recite the books of antiquity, disrupting the governance of the present. Their intelligence is insufficient to avoid the pitfalls of ignorance, yet they recklessly oppose those skilled in the arts.

To heed their words is to court danger; to follow their strategies is to invite disorder. This is the greatest folly and the most severe affliction.

Those who merely discuss theory while lacking true skill are as distant from true practitioners as a molehill is from a great mountain. Yet the sages discern the true nature of right and wrong, and perceive the essence of order and chaos.

Thus, in governing the state, they uphold just laws and severe punishments, seeking to rescue the people from disorder and avert calamity for the world. They ensure that the strong do not oppress the weak, that the many do not tyrannize the few, that the elderly live out their years, that orphans grow to maturity, that borders remain unviolated, that rulers and ministers remain close, and that parents and children are preserved—free from the miseries of death and captivity. This is indeed the greatest of merits.

The foolish do not understand, yet they call it cruelty. The foolish desire order but hate the means to achieve it, loving danger while clinging to what brings it.

How do we know this? Severe punishments are what the people dislike, yet they are the means by which the state is governed. Pitying the people and lightening punishments may please them, but it is the path to ruin.

Thus, the sages who establish laws must act contrary to the world’s expectations yet align with virtue and the Dao. Those who understand this agree in principle but differ in custom. Those who do not understand differ in principle but conform in custom.

If few in the world understand, then righteousness is not upheld. To occupy a position contrary to the Dao, to be slandered by the many, to be drowned in the words of the age, and yet seek to stand before a stern sovereign and hope for safety—this is surely difficult.

This is why wise men often die unrecognized in their time.

The younger brother of King Zhuang of Chu, Spring-applied Jun, had a favored concubine named Yu. The son of Spring-applied Jun’s primary wife was named Jia. Yu wished for the king to abandon his wife, so she injured herself and wept before the king, saying: *"To be your concubine is a great fortune. Though so, serving your wife is not the way to serve you, nor is serving you the way to serve your wife. I am unworthy, and my strength is insufficient to serve two masters. It is impossible to please both, so rather than die in your wife’s hands, I would prefer to die before you. If I am granted death, and if I should later be favored by your attendants, I pray you will investigate and not let others mock you."*

The king believed Yu’s deceit and abandoned his primary wife.

Yu then wished to kill Jia and make his son the heir, so she tore her own clothes to wrap around her body and wept before the king, saying: *"I have long been favored by you, and Jia is not unaware of this. Yet now he seeks to mock me, and when I contested with him, he tore my clothes. His disloyalty could not be greater!"*

The king, enraged, killed Jia.

Thus, the wife was abandoned through Yu’s deceit, and the son was killed by it. From this, we see that even a father’s love for his son can be destroyed by treachery. The relationship between ruler and minister is not one of kinship, yet the slander of ministers is far more than the words of a single concubine—how then can we be surprised that the wise and virtuous meet violent deaths?

This is the way **Shāng Jūn** was torn apart by chariot in **Qín**, and **Wú Qǐ** was dismembered limb by limb in **Chǔ**. All ministers, when they have faults, naturally do not wish to be executed, and those without merit all desire honor and prominence. Yet the **sage**’s governance of a state rewards none without merit, while punishment is always carried out against those who bear guilt.

Thus, those skilled in **arts and stratagems** who serve as ministers are inevitably the target of deceitful courtiers, unless a wise ruler can discern and heed them. Scholars of **arts and stratagems** instruct sovereigns, not saying: *"Leverage the awe of authority to suppress the treacherous ministers,"* but only: *"Practice benevolence, righteousness, and kindness."* Sovereigns of the world praise the name of benevolence and righteousness yet fail to examine their substance, so the great suffer the ruin of their states and their own deaths, while the small lose territory and see their status diminished. How can this be made clear?

To give aid to the poor and destitute—this is what the world calls benevolence and righteousness. To pity the common people and refuse to execute or punish—this is what the world calls kindness. If a ruler gives to the poor and destitute, then those without merit receive rewards. If he refuses to execute or punish, then violent rebels grow unrestrained. When a state rewards those without merit, its people will not exert themselves against external enemies or labor diligently in the fields; instead, they all seek to trade wealth, serve the rich, pursue private gain, and establish reputations to obtain high office and generous stipends.

Thus, the number of treacherous ministers increases, and the violent rebels grow ever stronger—how could such a state not perish? Harsh punishments are what the people fear, and severe penalties are what they detest. Therefore, the **sage** presents what they fear to restrain their wickedness, and establishes what they detest to prevent their treachery, so the state remains secure and violent rebellion does not arise.

By this, I demonstrate that benevolence, righteousness, and kindness are insufficient for governance, while harsh punishments and severe penalties can bring order to a state. Without the **rod and whip** to command horses, even **Zàochéng Fǔ** could not tame them. Without the **square and compass** to measure, even **Yáng’ěr** could not make them. Without the **awe of authority and the laws of reward and punishment**, even **Yáo** and **Shùn** could not govern. Yet today’s rulers all lightly dismiss severe penalties and harsh punishments, practicing kindness instead, and thus the achievements of **conquerors and kings** are unattainable.

Therefore, a ruler who excels must clearly establish rewards and incentives to encourage the people, ensuring that they gain rewards through merit, not through benevolence and righteousness. He must enforce harsh punishments and severe penalties to restrain them, ensuring that those who bear guilt are executed, not spared by kindness. Thus, those without merit will not dare to hope, and those with guilt will not escape misfortune.

Relying on sturdy chariots and fine horses, one can traverse even steep and rugged paths. Boarding a light, swift boat and holding a convenient oar, one can forever avoid the perils of rivers. Grasping the **methods of governance and the principles of reward and punishment**, and executing harsh penalties, one can attain the achievements of **conquerors and kings**. To govern a state with established laws of reward and punishment is like traveling on land with sturdy chariots and fine horses, or sailing with a light, swift boat and a convenient oar—those who use them will succeed.

**Yī Yǐn** obtained this from **Tāng**, who became king. **Guān Zhōng** obtained this from **Qí**, who became a **conqueror**. **Shāng Jūn** obtained this from **Qín**, who grew strong. These three men all understood the **arts of conquest and kingship**, discerned the **principles of governance and strength**, and were not swayed by the empty words of the world. When they aligned with the intentions of a wise ruler, even **humble commoners** could rise to the rank of **ministers and prime**. When they took their positions and governed the state, they brought **honor to the ruler and expansion of territory**. These are the **worthy ministers**.

Tāng obtained **Yī Yǐn**, and with a hundred *lǐ* of land, established himself as **Son of Heaven**. **Duke Huán** obtained **Guān Zhōng**, and became the leader of the **Five Conquerors**, uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world once. **Duke Xiào** obtained **Shāng Jūn**, and his territory grew vast while his armies became mighty.

Thus, there are **loyal ministers** who, externally, face no threat from rival states, and internally, have no concern for rebellious courtiers. Their rule endures in the world, and their names are passed down to posterity—these are the **loyal ministers**.

As for **Yù Ràng**, who served **Zhì Bó**, he could neither enlighten the ruler with the **principles of governance and strength** to avoid calamity, nor lead his forces to secure the state. When **Duke Xiāng** killed **Zhì Bó**, **Yù Ràng** mutilated himself, disfigured his face, and sought vengeance for his master against **Duke Xiāng**. Though he sacrificed his body and ruined his appearance for the sake of his lord’s reputation, in truth, he was no more beneficial to **Zhì Bó** than the finest hair of an autumn moth. This is what I consider the **lowest kind of minister**, yet the world’s rulers regard him as loyal and exalt him.

In ancient times, there were **Bó Yí** and **Shū Qí**, who refused **King Wǔ**’s offer of the world and starved to death on **Chǒuyáng Lǐng**. Such ministers fear neither severe punishment nor covet great rewards; they cannot be restrained by penalties nor directed by rewards. These are the **useless ministers**, whom I would do without, yet the world’s rulers seek them out.

The proverb says: *"The ruler who is harsh will be pitied."* This is an irreverent statement. Though it may be so, ancient proverbs are never false, and one cannot fail to examine it. This refers to rulers who are **seized, killed, or meet violent deaths**.

When a ruler lacks **methods of governance** to control his ministers, even if he lives long and is endowed with fine qualities, the great ministers will still seize power, act arbitrarily, and make decisions for their own benefit, while fearing that **noble warriors** will use the ruler’s authority to restrain or punish them. Thus, they murder the virtuous and establish the weak, abandon the legitimate heir and install the unrighteous.

Hence, the **Spring and Autumn Annals** record: *"The **King of Chǔ**, **Zǐ Wéi**, was about to visit **Zhèng** for a marriage alliance, but before leaving the border, he heard that the king was ill and returned. Upon his arrival, he feigned concern for the king’s health and strangled him with his own headband, thereby seizing the throne."* **Cuī Zhù** of **Qí** had a beautiful wife, and **Duke Zhuāng** repeatedly visited her home. When the duke went there, **Cuī Zhù**’s followers, led by **Jià Jǔ**, attacked him.

The duke entered the chamber and requested that the throne be divided with Cui Zhu, but Cui Zhu refused. The duke then asked to be slain with his own blade in the ancestral temple, yet Cui Zhu still would not comply. At last, the duke fled, scaling the northern wall.

Jià Jǔ shot the duke, striking his thigh, and he fell. Cui Zhu’s followers then struck him with spears and killed him, installing his younger brother, **Duke Jìng**, in his place.

In more recent accounts, we see **Lǐ Duì**’s treatment of **Zhào’s ruler**: he starved the sovereign for a hundred days until death. **Nàochǐ**’s treatment of **Qí’s ruler** was even more cruel—he tore the flesh from the king’s limbs, hung them from the temple beams, and left him to die in agony.

Thus, though **Duke Lí** suffered from festering sores and physical afflictions, when compared to the Spring and Autumn era, his fate was not as dire as strangulation or a thigh wound. When compared to the recent past, his suffering was far less severe than starvation or limb dismemberment.

Therefore, those who seized and killed their rulers, the anguish of their hearts and the torment of their bodies, must have been far greater than that of Duke Lí.

From this perspective, even if Duke Lí was pitiful, it was still better than the fate of **rulers wronged by treacherous ministers**—

*Han Feizi, Chapter 4, "Enmity" (originally "Seeking"), Volume 5, "Omens of Ruin" (15th Chapter)*

---

Where the ruler does not practice filial **virtue/power** as befits his station, yet admires the **virtue/power** of commoners, where he disregards the welfare of the state and nation (*shèjì*) yet obeys the commands of his concubine—when women govern and felons hold office—**such a kingdom is doomed**.

Where ministers of high rank—father, elder brother, and grandee—receive excessive emoluments and privileges beyond their merit, where their attire encroaches upon the ruler’s prerogatives, where their palaces are lavishly supplied at the ruler’s expense yet he does not forbid it—then the hearts of his subjects are boundless, and **such a kingdom is doomed** when the subjects’ hearts are boundless.

When the ruler’s in-laws and maternal grandsons share common gates with the people, yet oppress their neighbors—**such a kingdom is doomed**.

Though these signs do not *necessarily* mean ruin, they *indicate* that ruin is possible.

For two **Emperors of Virtue** (*Yáo*) cannot reign together, nor can two **Sages of Depravity** (*Jié*) bring ruin together. The fate of **Emperors of Virtue** and **Sages of Depravity** depends on their **Dao/virtue**—whether they bring order or chaos, strength or weakness in opposition to one another.

When a tree breaks, it is because the rot has spread through its core. When a wall collapses, it is because the cracks have grown wide.
Yet even when a tree is riddled with rot, it will not break without the force of a violent wind.
Even when a wall is full of cracks, it will not collapse without a heavy downpour.
Thus, a ruler of ten thousand chariots (*wàn chéng*), though skilled in **Dao/Way** and law, can only bring ruin if the winds of fortune and misfortune strike—until then, his dominion over all under heaven remains unchallenged.

**The Three Safeguards (第十六)**
A ruler has three safeguards.
If these three safeguards are complete, the kingdom will be secure and the ruler honored; if they are incomplete, the kingdom will be in peril and the ruler’s life endangered.
What are the three safeguards?

When ministers discuss the ruler’s missteps, the errors of those in office, or matters concerning the selection of ministers, the ruler does not keep these discussions to himself but leaks them to his close attendants and capable favorites. Then, ministers who wish to speak will not dare to present their views directly to the ruler but instead first submit them to the close attendants and capable favorites. Thus, upright and honest speakers are never heard, and loyal ministers grow increasingly distant.

He does not love people solely for their benefit, but waits for their praise before showing them favor.
He does not hate people solely for their harm, but waits for their faults before punishing them.
Then the ruler’s authority is diminished, and his reliance shifts to those around him.

To avoid the burdens of self-governance, he entrusts his ministers with the power to implement his will, transferring the authority over life and death, and the control of rewards and punishments to them. **Such a ruler is vulnerable** when he does this.

This is what is meant by the three safeguards being incomplete.
When the three safeguards are incomplete, the signs of **seizure/usurpation** (*jié shā*) arise.
There are three types of **seizure/usurpation**:
**open usurpation** (*míng jié*), **opportunistic usurpation** (*shì jié*), and **legalistic usurpation** (*xíng jié*).

When ministers hold high rank, they control the state’s vital affairs, allowing no one outside their circle to act. Though there may be virtuous and capable men, those who oppose them will surely meet misfortune, while those who comply will surely receive blessing.
Then, no minister dares to be loyal to the ruler and concerned for the nation, striving for the state’s welfare and harm.
Even if the ruler is virtuous, he cannot govern alone, and if ministers do not dare to be loyal to the ruler, then the kingdom is already doomed.
This is not because the inner court is empty and the ministers few.
Rather, the ministers hold their emoluments, cultivate their connections, and pursue private gain without rendering public loyalty—**this is open usurpation**.

When ministers sell their favors and monopolize power, they feign outward compliance to outmaneuver the ruler’s inner circle. They use crafty words to manipulate the ruler’s perception of fortune and misfortune, aligning with his preferences. The ruler listens to them, lowering his own status and belittling the state to gratify them. When their schemes fail, they share the blame with the ruler, but when they succeed, they take all the credit for themselves.
If all those in office unite in their words to praise such ministers, then the ruler will never believe those who speak ill of them—**this is opportunistic usurpation**.

When ministers alone control the prisons and the administration of punishments—**this is legalistic usurpation**.

If the three safeguards are incomplete, the three types of **seizure/usurpation** will arise; if the three safeguards are complete, the three types of **seizure/usurpation** will be blocked, and the ruler will reign in **harmony**.

**The Perils of Trusting Others (第十七)**
The ruler’s greatest peril lies in trusting his subjects, for trust leads to control by them.
Ministers serve their ruler not out of kinship, but because they are bound by power and cannot refuse.
Thus, as ministers, they constantly probe the ruler’s intentions without pause, while the ruler, neglectful and complacent in his exalted position, allows this. This is why the world sees ministers **seizing/usurping** their rulers and **regicides**.

If a ruler places great trust in his son, then a wicked minister can exploit that trust through the son to achieve his own ends. Thus, **Lǐ Duì** served as regent for **Zhào Wáng** and starved his father.
If a ruler places great trust in his wife, then a wicked minister can exploit that trust through her to achieve his own ends. Thus, **Yōu Shī** served as regent for **Lì Jī**, killing **Shēn Shēng** and enthroning **Xī Qí**.

If the ruler cannot trust his wife, who is closest to him, and his son, who is his kin, then whom can he trust?
Even among rulers of ten thousand chariots (*wàn chéng*) and a thousand chariots (*qiān chéng*), their consorts and sons may harbor desires for the ruler’s early death.
How do we know this?

A wife is not bound by blood, but by love—if she loves, she is close; if she does not love, she is distant.
The saying goes: *If a mother loves, her son will embrace.*
Yet if she turns against him, her son will abandon him.
A man of fifty may still be infatuated with beauty, but a woman of thirty has already lost her allure.
If a woman of waning beauty serves a man still enamored with beauty, then she herself is treated with disdain, and her son fears he will not be named heir—this is why consorts and sons-in-law hope for the ruler’s death.

Only when the mother becomes the queen and the son becomes the ruler will her commands be unopposed and his prohibitions unbroken. The pleasures of men and women will not diminish from those of the previous ruler, and he will hold sway over ten thousand chariots without doubt—**this is the use of poison and strangulation, the dark arts of suffocation and strangulation**.

Thus, **Duān Zhū** of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* said: *A ruler’s life will not last half its natural span if he cannot guard against this.*
If the ruler does not know this, then chaos will multiply.
Hence the saying: *Those who profit from the ruler’s death are many, and the ruler is in danger.*

Thus, **Wang Liang** cherished his horses, and **King Goujian of Yue** cherished his people—for war and speed. A skilled physician sucks wounds and holds blood in his mouth, yet he is not bound by kinship; it is the lure of gain. Therefore, a carriage-maker, upon completing a carriage, hopes for his patron’s wealth and nobility, while a coffin-maker, upon finishing a coffin, hopes for his patron’s early death. It is not that the carriage-maker is benevolent and the coffin-maker malevolent—if men do not grow rich, carriages will not sell; if men do not die, coffins will not be bought. Their hearts do not hate men; their profit lies in men’s death.

So too, consorts, noble ladies, and the factions of the heir apparent thrive when the ruler dies—for if the ruler does not die, their influence will not prevail. Their hearts do not hate the ruler; their profit lies in the ruler’s death. Therefore, the ruler must not neglect to guard against those who profit from his death.

Thus, when the sun and moon are ringed by halos from without, the cause lies within. One must prepare against what one hates, for calamity arises from what one loves. Hence, an enlightened ruler does not engage in unexamined actions or consume unusual foods. He listens from afar and observes closely to discern faults within and without. He weighs differing opinions to discern factions, tests the truth of petitions through cross-verification, and holds later events accountable to prior ones. He governs by law to manage the multitude, using multiple perspectives to verify all matters. If rewards are not arbitrarily bestowed, if conduct is not transgressed, if punishments are justly meted out, and if crimes are not pardoned, then deceit and wickedness will have no place to conceal their schemes.

Excessive labor burdens the people, and when the people suffer, power and influence arise. When power and influence grow, burdens are lifted, the noble grow rich, and the people’s suffering is used to elevate the powerful—this is called *jièjiè* (借借), or borrowing influence. A minister is not the eternal benefit of the realm.

Thus it is said: If labor is light, the people will be at ease; if the people are at ease, the lower ranks will not wield excessive power; if the lower ranks do not wield excessive power, then power and influence will perish, and virtue will rest with the ruler.

Now, water’s mastery over fire is clear, yet when confined between a pot and a wok, the water boils and evaporates above while the fire rages and burns below—water loses its power to prevail. So too, though the prohibition of deceit is clear, if those who uphold the law act like the pot and wok, the law will shine only in their minds, and they will lose its power to curb deceit.

The teachings of antiquity and the records of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* show that those who commit treason by breaking the law to commit great deceit have always been high-ranking nobles. Yet laws and punishments are always directed at the lowly, so the people despair and have no one to complain to.

Great ministers surround and deceive the ruler, appearing united in private while publicly opposing each other to feign impartiality. They serve as each other’s spies, waiting for the ruler’s vulnerabilities. The ruler is obscured, with no way to hear the truth, bearing the name of sovereignty but lacking its substance. The ministers monopolize the law’s execution—such was the case with the **Zhou Dynasty’s kings**. If power and influence are lent to ministers, then the ruler and subjects will reverse positions—this is why ministers must not be granted power.

**Chapter Eighteen: Facing South**
The ruler’s faults lie in his own delegation of authority to ministers, yet he must also counterbalance those he does not trust—this reasoning will inevitably clash with those he trusts, and the ruler will be controlled by those he does not trust.

Now, those the ruler prepares against today were once those he relied upon. If the ruler cannot clarify the law to curb the power of great ministers, he will lose the trust of lesser ones.

If the ruler abandons the law and relies on ministers to counterbalance other ministers, then those who favor each other will collude and praise one another, while those who dislike each other will form factions and slander one another. When flattery and slander clash, the ruler will be confused and disordered.

A minister’s advancement depends on reputation and petitions; his power comes from violating the law; his influence comes from feigning loyalty and trust—only then can he evade restraint. These three things are the means by which ministers deceive the ruler and undermine the law.

When the ruler employs ministers, even if they are wise, they must not violate the law to act unilaterally; even if they are virtuous, they must not claim credit before earning it; even if they are loyal and trustworthy, they must not disregard the law to evade restraint—this is called *clarifying the law*.

The ruler must beware of those who entice him with matters and those who obstruct his understanding through speech—both must be scrutinized.

Ministers who easily discuss affairs demand few resources to deceive the ruler, using matters to frame him. If the ruler is enticed and does not investigate, he will grow dependent on them, and they will in turn control him through affairs—this is called *enticement*, and those enticed by affairs will be ensnared by calamity.

If their petitions are few but their demands are many, even if they achieve success, their words will not be trusted. Since untrusted words invite punishment, and successful matters warrant reward, no minister will dare to falsify speech to deceive the ruler.

The ruler’s way is to ensure that a minister’s later words do not contradict his earlier ones, nor his earlier words his later ones. Even if he achieves success, he must still bear his guilt—this is called *holding ministers accountable*.

If a minister proposes an affair and fears it may be unwise, he will first preemptively speak in favor of it, saying: *"Those who oppose this affair are jealous of its success."* If the ruler hides this statement and no longer listens to other ministers, and if other ministers fear this statement and dare not discuss affairs, then these two forces will prevail—loyal ministers will not be heard, while flatterers will hold sole authority. This is called *obstructing speech*, and those obstructed by speech will be controlled by ministers.

The ruler’s way is to ensure that ministers bear responsibility both for speaking and for remaining silent. Speech without foundation or verification is the responsibility of speech. Silence to avoid accountability while holding a high position is the responsibility of silence.

When the ruler commands ministers to speak, he must know the origin of their words to hold them to their truth. For those who remain silent, he must inquire into their choices to hold them accountable. Then no minister will dare to speak falsely, nor will any dare to remain silent—whether they speak or stay silent, they will bear responsibility.

The ruler desires to act yet does not grasp the beginning and end of matters, and instead reveals his intentions clearly. Those who act will not gain advantage but must suffer harm in return. Those who understand this will uphold principle and abandon personal desires.

When undertaking actions, there is a Dao/Way: if the input is great and the output is small, then it may be done. The confused ruler does not so calculate; he only considers the input and not the output. Though the output may double the input, he does not perceive the harm, and thus this is called *reaping the name while losing the substance*—whereby the gains are small and the harm is great.

In general, when the input is great and the output is small, it may be called "gain." Now, when the ruler expends great resources without cause and achieves only minor gains, the ministers will expend great resources to complete small tasks. When small tasks are completed, the ruler still suffers harm.

Those who do not understand governance will say: "Do not alter the ancient ways; do not change the established norms." Whether to change or not, the sage does not listen—only proper governance matters.

Thus, the ancient saying of "not altering the ancient ways" and "not changing the established norms" depends on whether the ancient ways and established norms are suitable or not. If **Yi Yin** had not altered **Yin**, and **Duke Gong** had not altered **Zhou**, then **Tang** and **Wu** would not have become kings.

If **Guan Zhong** had not changed **Qi**, and **Guo Yan** had not reform **Jin**, then **Huan** and **Wen** would not have become hegemon.

In general, people fear altering the ancient ways because they dread disturbing the people’s comfort. Not altering the ancient ways is to follow the path of chaos, while conforming to the people’s desires is to indulge in deceitful behavior.

The people are ignorant and do not recognize chaos; the ruler is weak and cannot reform. This is the failure of governance. The ruler must clearly understand governance and strictly enforce it, so even if it contradicts the people’s wishes, proper governance will stand.

This is illustrated by **Shang Jun’s** internal and external reforms, his heavy armor, and his early warnings.

Thus, when **Guo Yan** first governed, **Duke Wen** had standing soldiers. When **Guan Zhong** first governed, **Huan Gong** had war chariots. These were warnings to the people to be prepared.

Hence, the foolish and reckless people endure minor losses while forgetting greater benefits, so they suffer **tiger-like calamities** and unjust slander. Yet, even slight reforms can bring long-term ruin, so **Zou Jia** was not worthy of being a traveling envoy.

Those accustomed to chaos and complacent toward governance cannot return to order, so the people of **Zheng** could not be reformed.

**Chapter Nineteen: Ornamenting Evil**

The **Zhao** divined with a tortoise shell and cast many strategies; the omens said *great auspiciousness*, yet they attacked **Yan**—this was **Zhao**. The tortoise shell divined with many strategies; the omens said *great auspiciousness*, yet they attacked **Zhao**—this was **Yan**.

**Zuo Xin’s** campaign against **Yan** brought no success yet endangered the ancestral altars. **Zou Yan’s** campaign against **Yan** brought no success yet severed the **Dao/Way** of the state. **Zhao** first gained advantage from **Yan**, then from **Qi**, with the state in disorder yet the ruler’s prestige high. They believed they could match **Qin** in power, but this was not because the **Zhao tortoise** was divine nor because the **Yan tortoise** deceived.

**Zhao** again divined with a tortoise shell and cast many strategies, then launched a northern expedition against **Yan**, intending to plunder **Yan** to oppose **Qin**. The omens said *great auspiciousness*, but when they attacked **Daliang**, **Qin** took **Shangdang**. When their forces reached **Li**, six cities were captured. At **Yangcheng**, **Qin** seized **Ye**. **Pang Jiān** led reinforcements south, and **Dang** was utterly lost.

Thus, the ministers say: Though the **Zhao tortoise** had no distant foresight for **Yan**, it should have had near foresight for **Qin**.

**Qin**, relying on its *great auspiciousness*, expanded territory with substance and saved **Yan** in name. **Zhao**, relying on its *great auspiciousness*, lost land and suffered military disgrace, with the ruler dying in discontent—this was not because the **Qin tortoise** was divine nor because the **Zhao tortoise** deceived.

Initially, **Wei** spent years attacking eastward and exhausted **Tao** and **Wei**. In years spent attacking westward, it lost its state—this was not because **Fenglong**, **Wuxing**, **Taiyi**, **Wangxiang**, **Shètí**, **Liùshén**, **Wǔkuò**, **Tiānhé**, **Yīnqiāng**, or **Suìxīng** were in the west for those years, nor because **Kuítái**, **Húní**, **Xíngxīng**, or **Yínghuò** were in the east for those years.

Thus, it is said: Tortoise divination and ghosts/gods cannot guarantee victory; relying on left and right forces cannot ensure exclusive warfare. Yet, those who depend on them are the most foolish.

The ancient sage-kings devoted their strength to governing the people and added effort to clarifying the laws. When the laws are clear, loyal ministers will encourage proper conduct, and punishments will be sure—then evil ministers will cease.

When loyal ministers encourage proper conduct and evil ministers stop, the land will be vast and the ruler honored—this was **Qin**. When ministers form factions and cliques to conceal the proper **Dao/Way**, indulging in private schemes while the land is diminished and the ruler’s prestige low—this was **the states east of the mountains**.

Chaos and weakness lead to ruin; governance and strength lead to kingship. This is the ancient Dao/Way.

**King Goujian of Yue** relied on the tortoise of **Daming**, fought with **Wu**, and was defeated. He himself became a subject and entered service in **Wu**, then returned to his state, abandoned the tortoise, and clarified the laws while governing the people to avenge **Wu**—**Fuchai** was captured.

Thus, those who rely on ghosts/gods will be negligent toward the laws, and those who rely on other states will endanger their own. **Cao** relied on **Qi** yet did not heed **Song**; **Qi** attacked **Pan**, and **Song** destroyed **Cao**.

**Jue** relied on **Wu** yet did not heed **Qi**; **Yue** attacked **Wu**, and **Qi** destroyed **Jing**.

**Xu** relied on **Jue** yet did not heed **Wei**; **Jing** attacked **Song**, and **Wei** destroyed **Xu**.

**Zheng** relied on **Wei** yet did not heed **Han**; **Wei** attacked **Jing**, and **Han** destroyed **Zheng**.

Now, **Han** is a small state yet relies on great states. The ruler is arrogant, heeding **Qin** and **Wei** while relying on **Qi** and **Jing**—yet small states continue to perish.

Thus, relying on others cannot expand territory, yet **Han** does not see this. **Jing** attacked **Wei** and increased its forces in **Xu** and **Yan**; **Qi** attacked **Renhu** and diminished **Wei**—this was not enough to preserve **Zheng**, yet **Han** did not know.

These are all cases of not clarifying their legal prohibitions to govern their states, relying on external forces to destroy their ancestral altars.

Thus, the ministers say: If one understands the principles of governance, even a small state will be wealthy. If rewards and punishments are respected and trusted, even a few people will be strong. If rewards and punishments lack measure, though a state is large its armies will be weak—its land will not be its own, nor its people truly its own.

Without land or people, even **Yao** and **Shun** could not become kings, nor the **Three Dynasties** strong. The ruler again gives excessive rewards, and the ministers again take them without merit.

Those who abandon the laws and speak only of the achievements of ancient sage-kings and wise rulers will be held responsible by the state. Thus, the ministers say: This is the wish to emulate the ancient achievements, yet to reward today’s people with ancient rewards. The ruler gives these excessive rewards, and the ministers take them without merit.

「When the ruler errs in granting rewards, the ministers will take advantage of the situation; when the ministers accept them without merit, their achievements will not be honored. Those without merit who receive rewards will drain the state’s wealth and raise the people’s expectations, while drained wealth and raised expectations will cause the people to withhold their efforts.

Thus, excessive rewards will lose the people’s trust, and excessive punishments will make the people fearless. If rewards are insufficient to encourage, and punishments insufficient to restrain, then even a great state will be in peril.

Therefore it is said: One with little wisdom cannot be entrusted to plan affairs, and one with little loyalty cannot be entrusted to uphold the law. At the Battle of Yánlíng between the King of Chu (荆恭王) and the Duke of Jin (晋厉公), the Chu forces were defeated, and the king wounded. Amid the fierce fighting, the Chu general **Zǐfǎn** (司马子反) grew thirsty and sought drink, while his companion **Shùgǔyáng** (竖谷阳) presented a cup of wine to him. Zǐfǎn said: "Remove it, this is wine!" Shùgǔyáng replied: "No, it is not." Zǐfǎn took and drank it. For he was a man who loved wine, finding it sweet and unable to resist its taste. He drank until intoxicated and fell asleep.

The king wished to resume the battle and sought counsel, summoning Zǐfǎn. But Zǐfǎn feigned illness. The king then drove to inspect him, entering his pavilion and detecting the stench of wine before returning. He declared: "Today’s battle—my own eyes have seen our forces wounded. Our reliance was on the general, but he is thus: this is the destruction of Chu’s state and people without regard for my soldiers! I shall not fight again."

He dismissed the army and withdrew, executing Zǐfǎn as a severe example. Therefore it is said: Shùgǔyáng’s offering of wine was not to distinguish between good and evil, but simply to follow the king’s command. Zǐfǎn, in truth, was rewarded with loyalty and affection, yet this was enough only to bring about his death. This was the case of **xiǎozhōng** (小忠) undermining **dàzhōng** (大忠).

Hence it is said: **Xiǎozhōng** (小忠) is the thief of **dàzhōng** (大忠). If one were to entrust **xiǎozhōng** (小忠) with the law, they would surely pardon crimes, pardoning crimes out of mutual affection—this would bring security to the lower ranks, yet it would disrupt the governance of the people. When **Wèi** (魏) was in the midst of establishing clear laws and strict governance, those with merit were rewarded, and those with crimes were punished. Thus, they grew strong and maintained order throughout the world, their prestige extending to the four neighboring states.

But when their laws were neglected and rewards granted arbitrarily, their state daily diminished. When **Zhào** (赵) was enforcing clear national statutes and leading great armies, their forces were numerous and strong, and they subdued the lands of **Qí** (齐) and **Yàn** (燕). Yet when their national statutes were neglected and those who wielded them grew weak, their state daily diminished.

When **Yàn** (燕) was in the midst of strictly adhering to the law and impartially judging officials, their eastern borders reached **Qí** (齐), and their southern lands extended to **Zhōngshān** (中山). But once their adherence to the law was lost, their officials no longer judged impartially, their courtiers engaged in mutual contention, and judgments followed the lower ranks, then their armies weakened and their lands were carved up by neighboring enemies. Hence it is said: Those who uphold the law grow strong, those who neglect it grow weak. The distinction between strength and weakness is thus clear, yet rulers of the age do not act accordingly—so the ruin of their states is justly deserved.

The saying goes: A family with constant livelihood will not starve, though it may be poor. A state with constant law will not perish, though it may be in danger. If one abandons constant law and follows private intentions, then ministers will embellish their wisdom and abilities. When ministers embellish their wisdom and abilities, legal prohibitions cannot be established.

This is the way of **miào yì** (妄意) prevailing, while the **Dàodé** (道) of governance is discarded. The **Dàodé** (道) of governance lies in removing harmful laws, so as not to be misled by cleverness nor deceived by reputation.

In ancient times, **Shùn** (舜) entrusted his officials to decide the **Hóngshuǐ** (鸿水) flood, first commanding them to act, then executing them for their failure. **Yǔ** (禹) assembled the rulers of the feudal states at **Wèihuì** (会稽), and when the ruler of **Fángfēng** (防风) arrived late, Yǔ beheaded him. From this, we see that those who disobeyed the commands were killed, and those who arrived late were executed—thus, the ancients valued the law above all else.

Hence, the **jìng** (镜) holds clarity without bias, and good and evil are measured accordingly. The **héng** (衡) holds balance without bias, and light and heavy are weighed accordingly. To shake the **jìng** (镜) is to lose its clarity, and to shake the **héng** (衡) is to lose its balance—this is the nature of law. Therefore, the ancient sage-rulers took **Dàodé** (道) as their constant principle and law as their foundation. When the foundation is well-ordered, their name is honored; when the foundation is disordered, their name is extinguished.

In general, those with wisdom and ability will act when they have a means, and cease when they lack it. Thus, wisdom and ability alone cannot be passed on to others. But **Dàodé** (道) and law are universally complete—wisdom and ability often fail.

To hang the **héng** (衡) and know equilibrium, to set a **guī** (规) and know roundness—these are the **wànquán** (万全) ways. The enlightened ruler commands the people to adorn their conduct according to **Dàodé** (道), so as to achieve merit without error.

To discard the **guī** (规) and rely on cleverness, to discard the law and rely on wisdom—these are the ways of confusion and disorder. The disordered ruler commands the people to adorn their cleverness, unaware of the **Dàodé** (道), so their labor yields no merit.

To abandon legal prohibitions and listen to petitions, for courtiers to sell their offices to the ruler and take rewards from the people—this is how private gain lies with the ministers and power is concentrated among the courtiers. Hence, the people lack the resolve to serve the ruler with all their strength, instead striving to curry favor with him.

When the people favor currying favor, wealth and resources flow upward, and those who are skilled in flattery are employed. If this is the case, those with merit will grow ever fewer. The wicked ministers advance while the capable retreat, and the ruler becomes confused, not knowing what to do, while the people gather without knowing what to follow. **Dào** (道) is what one follows. This is the failure of abandoning legal prohibitions, neglecting merit, elevating reputation, and listening to petitions.

In general, those who subvert the law will inevitably devise deceit and rely on external things to curry favor, and they will also speak of the rare and extraordinary—this is how tyrants and disordered rulers mislead, and how ministers and worthy advisors are undermined.

Thus, when ministers praise the achievements of **Yīyǐn** (伊尹) and **Guǎn Zhòng** (管仲), they are embellishing cleverness and concealing their own lack of merit. When they praise the loyalty of **Bǐgān** (比干) and **Zǐxù** (子胥), yet these men were executed, they will instead criticize those who strongly advise, finding fault with them.

A ruler who is praised as virtuous and wise, while his ministers are condemned as tyrannical and disordered, cannot be judged by such examples. If this is the case, then prohibitions must be enforced. The ruler establishes laws, believing them to be correct, yet ministers often establish their private cleverness and declare the law to be incorrect—this is to pervert the law with their own wisdom.

From this reasoning, one knows that all human inclinations naturally seek to abandon public law and establish private cleverness.»

「To abandon law and establish private cleverness—such behavior must be prohibited, for it is the Dao of the ruler. To prohibit the Dao of the ruler, one must clearly distinguish between public and private matters, uphold the law, and eliminate private favoritism.

For orders to be carried out and prohibitions to be obeyed is the public *virtue/power* of the ruler. To act on private interests, trusting only in friends, and to make such behavior the standard for rewards and punishments—this is the private *virtue/power* of ministers.

When private *virtue/power* prevails, disorder ensues; when public *virtue/power* prevails, governance is harmonious. Hence, there must be a distinction between public and private.

Ministers possess private desires and public *virtue/power*. When they cultivate their own integrity and act in accordance with public principles and righteousness, when they hold office without self-interest, this is the public *virtue/power* of ministers. When they indulge in corrupt conduct and follow their own desires, when they seek personal comfort and familial gain, this is the private desire of ministers.

A wise ruler governs above, and ministers abandon their private desires to uphold public *virtue/power*. A disorderly ruler governs above, and ministers abandon public *virtue/power* to follow their private desires. Therefore, the ruler and ministers have divergent inclinations.

The ruler uses stratagem to retain his ministers, while the ministers use stratagem to serve their ruler—stratagem is the essence of their interaction. To harm oneself for the benefit of the state, ministers will not do it; to enrich the state for the benefit of ministers, the ruler will not act. The minister’s natural inclination is to avoid harming himself without gain, while the ruler’s natural inclination is to avoid harming the state without reward. Thus, the ruler and ministers are bound by mutual calculation.

When facing peril, they must die; when expending all their wisdom and strength, they do so for the sake of the law. Hence, the ancient kings made rewards clear to encourage the people and enforced severe punishments to instill awe. When rewards and punishments are properly applied, the people will die for the law; when the people die for the law, the military will be strong and the ruler will be honored. When rewards and punishments are not carefully administered, the people will seek gain without merit, escape punishment despite guilt, and thus the military will be weak and the ruler will be humbled.

Therefore, the ancient kings’ worthy ministers exerted all their wisdom and strength. It is said:

*The distinction between public and private must be clear, and the laws and prohibitions must be carefully examined*—this the ancient kings understood well.»

*#6 "即" (jí) is clearly a mistake for "民" (mín), corrected accordingly.*

The **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) is the essence within. The **acquisition** (得, *dé*) is the external manifestation. The **virtue/power** of the Sage does not cling to outward displays—this means that its **spiritual essence** (神, *shén*) does not indulge in external excesses. When the **spiritual essence** does not indulge in external excesses, the body remains intact, and this integrity is called **virtue/power**. **Virtue/power** is thus the preservation of the body. All **virtue/power** arises from **non-action** (无为, *wúwéi*), is perfected through **non-desire** (无欲, *wúyù*), is secured by **non-contemplation** (不思, *bùsī*), and is established by **non-dependence** (不用, *bùyòng*).

If one acts or desires, **virtue/power** will not be sustained, and **virtue/power** unsustained means it is incomplete. If one relies upon or contemplates, it will not be firm, and firmness lost means no achievement, no achievement means **virtue/power** will perish. When **virtue/power** perishes, there is no **virtue/power**; when there is no **virtue/power**, it is within the realm of **having virtue/power**. Hence it is said: *The **virtue/power** of the Sage does not cling to outward displays, and thus it possesses **virtue/power**.* The reason why **non-action** and **non-contemplation** are esteemed as **emptiness** (虚, *xū*) is that their **intent** (意, *yì*) is unrestrained.

Those who lack **skill** (术, *shù*) mistakenly regard **non-action** and **non-contemplation** as **emptiness**. But those who mistakenly regard **non-action** and **non-contemplation** as **emptiness** are always mindful of **emptiness**, thus they are constrained by the notion of **emptiness**. **Emptiness** means that the **intent** is not constrained by anything. Now, if one is constrained by the notion of **emptiness**, then one is not truly **empty**. The **emptiness** of the **virtue/power** of the Sage lies in its **non-action** without fixating on **non-action** as a constant. When **non-action** is not fixated upon as a constant, then it is **empty**, and **emptiness** brings forth abundant **virtue/power**—this is the **virtue/power** of the Sage. Hence it is said: *The **virtue/power** of the Sage is **non-action** yet nothing remains undone.*

**Ren** (仁, *rén*) refers to the joyful **intent** within to love others. It delights in others’ blessings and abhors others’ misfortunes, arising naturally from the heart without seeking recompense. Hence it is said: *The **Ren** of the Sage acts yet does nothing to demand.*

**Righteousness** (义, *yì*) is the proper conduct between superiors and inferiors, the distinctions of parent and child, the bonds of trusted friends, and the divisions of near and distant, inner and outer. Serving the lord should be proper, inferiors should be harmonious with superiors, children should serve their parents properly, the lowly should respect the noble, trusted friends should aid one another, and those close should be treated as inner while those distant as outer. **Righteousness** is thus the principle of propriety. When propriety is followed, it is called **righteousness**, and hence it is said: *The **Righteousness** of the Sage acts yet does nothing to reject.*

**Rites** (礼, *lǐ*) are the outward expressions of **intent**, the refined forms of **righteousness**, the exchanges between lord and subject, parent and child, and the distinctions among noble, worthy, and unworthy. When the **intent** is heartfelt yet not understood, one hastens with humility and reverence to clarify it. When love is genuine yet not recognized, one uses elaborate words to confirm it. **Rites** are the outward forms that clarify the inner **intent**. Hence it is said: *Rites are the outward expressions of **intent**.*

Generally, people are moved by external things, unaware that these are the **rites** of their own bodies. Commoners observe **rites** to honor others, thus their **rites** wax and wane with time. The **Dao/Way** (道, *dào*) of the **Noble Person** (君子, *jūnzǐ*) is to observe **rites** for oneself. When **rites** are observed for oneself, the **spiritual essence** becomes the highest **rites**, and though commoners may falter, the Sage’s repeated acts of reverence and respect extend even to the **rites** of hands and feet. Hence it is said: *The Sage extends his arms to uphold them.*

The **Dao/Way** accumulates into **virtue/power**, and **virtue/power** manifests as **achievement** (功, *gōng*). **Achievement** is substantial, and substance radiates **luster** (光, *guāng*). **Ren** is the **luster** of **virtue/power**. **Luster** spreads as **benefit** (泽, *zé*), and **benefit** is realized through **action** (事, *shì*). **Righteousness** is the **action** of **Ren**. **Action** is refined by **rites**, and **rites** are adorned by **ornament** (文, *wén*). **Rites** are the **ornament** of **righteousness**. Hence it is said: *When the **Dao/Way** is lost, then **virtue/power** is lost; when **virtue/power** is lost, then **Ren** is lost; when **Ren** is lost, then **righteousness** is lost; when **righteousness** is lost, then **rites** are lost.*

**Rites** are the outward expressions of **intent**. **Ornament** is the refinement of substance. The **Noble Person** seeks **intent** and discards outward expressions, prefers substance and abhors refinement. Those who rely on outward expressions to judge **intent** have a corrupt **intent**. Those who demand refinement to assess substance have a decaying substance. How can this be proven?

The **Jade of the He Family** (和氏之璧, *Héshì zhī bì*) was not adorned with five colors, and the **Pearl of the Duke of Sui** (隋侯之珠, *Suíhóu zhī zhū*) was not set with silver and gold. Their substance was supremely beautiful, and no external adornment could enhance them. Things that require adornment to be valued have inherently flawed substance. Thus, between parent and child, the **rites** are simple yet not fully illuminated, and it is said: *The **rites** are sparse.*

All things cannot flourish simultaneously—such is the **balance** (并, *bìng*) of **yin** and **yang**. Reason gives and takes—such is the interplay of **authority** (威, *wēi*) and **virtue/power** (德, *dé*). Where substance is abundant, outward expressions are sparse—the **rites** between parent and child are such. From this perspective, **rites** that are elaborate indicate a decaying substance. Therefore, those who practice **rites** are addressing the simple **intent** of others. When commoners observe **rites**, others comply with light joy, but when they do not, resentment and blame arise. Now, if one practices **rites** to address the simple **intent** of others yet also provides them with grounds for blame, how can conflict be avoided?

Conflict leads to disorder, and hence it is said: ***Rites** are the superficiality of loyalty and trust, yet they are the origin of disorder.* Those who possess **foresight** (前识, *qiánshí*) act before things unfold and move before reason demands—this is **unprompted** (无缘, *wúyuán*) **forgetting** (忘, *wàng*) the **measure** (度, *duó*) of **intent**. How can this be proven?

**Zhan He** sat in meditation, his disciples attending. A cow bellowed outside the gate, and a disciple remarked: *"It is a black cow with a white calf."*

Zhan He said: *"Indeed, it is a black cow, but the white is on its horns. If one were to examine it, it would indeed be a black cow with its horns wrapped in cloth. Using Zhanzi’s method to probe the common mind is perilously superficial—thus it is said: **‘The superficiality of the Dao.’**

Try releasing Zhanzi’s keen perception and instead let a five-foot-tall ignorant child observe it—he too would know it is a black cow with its horns wrapped in cloth. Thus, Zhanzi’s perception, though laboring over the mind and exhausting the spirit, ultimately yields the same result as the child’s—hence it is said: **‘The origin of folly.’**

Therefore, it is said: **‘Foresight is the superficiality of the Dao and the origin of folly.’**

What is called a **‘great man’** refers to the vastness of his wisdom. What is meant by **‘dwelling in substance, not in superficiality’** is to act in accordance with reality while discarding mere formality. What is meant by **‘dwelling in reality, not in superficiality’** is to follow principle without abrupt severance. What is meant by **‘rejecting that and taking this’** is to abandon formality and abrupt severance while embracing principle and genuine sincerity. Hence it is said: **‘Reject that and take this.’**

When a man faces misfortune, his heart is filled with fear and dread. Fear and dread make his conduct upright. Upright conduct sharpens his deliberation. Sharp deliberation reveals the truth of things. Upright conduct avoids misfortune. Avoiding misfortune fulfills one’s natural lifespan. Grasping the truth of things ensures success. Fulfilling one’s natural lifespan preserves life and longevity. Ensuring success brings wealth and honor. Preserving life, longevity, wealth, and honor—this is **‘blessing.’** Yet blessing originates from misfortune, hence it is said: **‘Misfortune! The foundation of blessing.’** To achieve success.

When a man attains blessing, wealth and honor come. Wealth and honor bring fine clothing and food. Fine clothing and food breed arrogance. Arrogance leads to perverse actions and abandonment of principle. Perverse actions bring untimely death. Abandoning principle ensures failure. To suffer internal ruin and external disgrace while lacking success—this is great misfortune. Yet misfortune originates from blessing, hence it is said: **‘Blessing! The hidden seed of misfortune.’**

Those who follow principle in their actions achieve nothing they cannot accomplish. Those who follow principle can attain the supreme authority of a sovereign’s exalted status, while even the smallest efforts yield the rewards of ministerial offices, generalships, and stipends. Those who abandon principle and forget proper conduct—even if they possess the exalted status of a sovereign or noble and the wealth of Yi Dun, Tao Zhu, or diviners—will still lose their people and forfeit their resources. The common folk lightly discard principle and easily forget proper conduct, unaware of how profound and vast the depths of misfortune and blessing truly are. Hence it is said: **‘Who knows its ultimate measure?’**

No one does not desire wealth, honor, preserved life, and longevity, yet none can escape the misfortunes of poverty, lowliness, untimely death, and disgrace. Two desires—wealth, honor, preserved life, and longevity—yet now they suffer poverty, lowliness, untimely death, and disgrace. This is failing to reach what one desires. To lose the path to one’s desires and act recklessly—this is called **‘delusion.’** Delusion means failing to reach what one desires. That the common folk cannot reach what they desire has been so since the division of heaven and earth until today—hence it is said: **‘The delusion of man is ancient indeed.’**

What is called **‘rectitude’** is the harmony of inner and outer, speech and action in accord. What is called **‘frugality’** is the preservation of life and death’s command, the light use of wealth. What is called **‘uprightness’** is that justice must be impartial, the heart unyielding to partiality. What is called **‘radiance’** is noble office, splendid robes, and majestic attire.

Yet a man of the Dao, though internally and externally trusted and obedient, does not suffer slander or ruin; though he dies with integrity and spends lightly, he is not shamed by insult or greedy for gain; though his conduct is just and impartial, he does not err by favoring the wicked or the private; though his status is exalted and his attire splendid, he does not boast over the lowly or deceive the poor.

Why is this? If those lost in error were willing to listen, study, and inquire, they would not remain deluded. Yet the common folk, though desiring success, instead court failure because they do not know principle and refuse to inquire or listen to those who do. The common folk refuse to inquire or listen, yet the Sage compels them with the consequences of their ruin—then they resent. The common folk are many, the Sage few; few cannot overcome many—this is the way of numbers.

To act in opposition to the world is not the path of preserving life and longevity—thus one must regulate conduct and act accordingly. Hence it is said: **‘Rectitude without harshness, frugality without mutilation, uprightness without excess, radiance without dazzle.’**

Hearing and insight are from Heaven. Movement, stillness, thought, and deliberation are from man. Man, relying on Heaven’s clarity to see, Heaven’s hearing to listen, Heaven’s wisdom to think—if vision is strained, the eyes grow dim; if hearing is overtaxed, the ears grow dull; if thought is excessive, wisdom becomes confused. Dim eyes cannot distinguish black from white. Dull ears cannot separate clear from murky sounds. Confused wisdom cannot discern the grounds of gain and loss. Dim eyes are called **‘blindness’**; dull ears, **‘deafness’**; confused wisdom, **‘madness.’** Blindness cannot avoid the dangers of daylight. Deafness cannot perceive the harm of thunder. Madness cannot escape the calamities of human laws.

What the *Classics* call **‘governing men’** is to moderate movement and stillness, to curb excessive deliberation. What is called **‘serving Heaven’** is not to exhaust the limits of hearing and insight, nor to overburden wisdom’s capacity. If one exhausts them, the spirit is overtaxed; overtaxing the spirit invites the calamities of blindness, deafness, rebellion, and madness—thus one must **‘be frugal.’** To be frugal is to cherish the spirit and conserve wisdom.

Thus it is said: **"To govern men and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality."**

The multitude’s use of **qi** is frantic; frantic use depletes **qi** greatly, and great depletion is called **‘excess’**. The Sage’s use of **qi** is tranquil; tranquil use conserves **qi** sparingly, and sparing conservation is called **‘frugality’**. **Frugality** is the **Dao/Way** that arises from **‘principle and reason’**; he who can practice **frugality** is one who follows the **Dao/Way** and submits to **reason**.

The multitude avoids calamity yet falls into disaster, still unaware of retreat, and does not submit to **principle and reason**. The Sage, though he has not yet seen the form of calamity or disaster, emptily and subtly submits to **principle and reason** in advance—thus it is said: **"He who practices frugality is one who submits in advance."**

He who knows **‘to govern men’** keeps his deliberations tranquil; he who knows **‘to serve Heaven’** keeps his senses empty. Tranquil deliberation ensures **virtue/power** does not depart. Empty senses allow harmonious **qi** to enter daily. Thus it is said: **"Accumulate **virtue/power** heavily."**

He who can ensure **virtue/power** does not depart and harmonious **qi** arrives daily is one who submits in advance. Thus it is said: **"To submit in advance is to accumulate **virtue/power** heavily."**

Accumulate **virtue/power** first, then **qi** becomes tranquil; **qi** tranquil, then harmony grows; harmony grows, then plans succeed; plans succeed, then one can command all things. Commanding all things makes war easy and victory certain; victory certain and discourse unmatched in the world, thus it is said: **"There is nothing he cannot conquer."**

There is nothing he cannot conquer because of heavy accumulation of **virtue/power**, thus it is said: **"Heavy accumulation of **virtue/power** means there is nothing he cannot conquer."**

War easy and victory certain means he can encompass the world; discourse unmatched means the people submit. To advance and encompass the world while in retreat to follow the people—his methods are distant, and thus the multitude cannot see their beginning or end. If they cannot see their beginning or end, then they cannot know his limits, thus it is said: **"There is nothing he cannot conquer, so his limits are unknown."**

In general, one may have a state yet lose it, have a life yet suffer misfortune—this cannot be called truly possessing the state or preserving one’s life. He who truly possesses the state must be able to stabilize its **society and altars** (*shèjì*); he who truly preserves his life must be able to complete his natural years—only then can it be said he truly possesses the state and preserves his life.

He who truly possesses the state and preserves his life must embody the **Dao/Way**; embodying the **Dao/Way** deepens his wisdom, and deep wisdom extends his foresight, so distant that the multitude cannot see his ultimate limits. Only Heaven can make one unaware of the limits of his undertakings; one unaware of these limits is truly able to preserve his life and possess his state, thus it is said: **"His limits are unknown."**

His limits unknown means he can possess the state. What is called **"the origin of possessing a state"**—the origin, that is, the **Dao/Way**—the **Dao/Way** that gives rise to the methods of possessing a state, hence it is called **"the origin of possessing a state."**

The **Dao/Way** that interacts harmoniously with the world—its establishment is enduring, its blessings long-lasting. Thus it is said: **"The origin of possessing a state can endure long."**

Trees have **‘flexible roots’** and **‘straight roots’**. Roots are what the *Classics* call **"foundation"** (*dǐ*). **Foundation** is what allows a tree to establish its growth. **Flexible roots** are what sustain a tree’s life. **Virtue/power** is what allows man to establish his growth. **Blessings** are what sustain man’s life.

Now, if one establishes himself in **reason**, his blessings will endure long, thus it is said: **"Deepen his roots."** If one embodies the **Dao/Way**, his life will be long, thus it is said: **"Strengthen his foundation."** Foundation strengthened means life prolonged; roots deepened means vision lasting, thus it is said: **"Deepening his roots and strengthening his foundation is the **Dao/Way** of long life and lasting vision."**

A craftsman who often changes his occupation loses his skill; a builder who frequently shifts his work loses his achievement. One man’s work, half lost each day, in ten days loses five men’s worth. Ten thousand men’s work, half lost each day, in ten days loses five thousand men’s worth.

Thus, the more one changes his occupation, the greater the loss, the more the depletion. In general, changing laws shifts benefits and harms; benefits and harms shifting means the people’s duties change—changing duties is called **‘changing occupations’**.

Hence, from the perspective of **reason**, to govern the multitude while frequently altering it leads to little success; to store great treasures while frequently moving them invites many failures; to cook small fish while constantly stirring them ruins their flavor; to govern a great state while frequently changing laws brings suffering to the people.

Therefore, the ruler who embodies the **Dao/Way** values tranquility and does not often change laws, thus it is said: **"To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish."**

When men are sick, they value physicians; when disaster strikes, they fear ghosts. When the Sage rules above, the people desire little; little desire means their **blood and **qi**** are harmonious and their movements follow **reason**; movements following **reason** mean little calamity.

He who has no internal harm from **‘ulcers, boils, or festering sores’** (*zhāojūyànzhì*) and no external harm from punishments or legal executions—his fear of ghosts is very light, thus it is said: **"When the **Dao/Way** is applied to rule the world, its ghosts are not formidable."**

The people of a well-ordered age do not harm ghosts and spirits, thus it is said: **"It is not that the ghosts are not formidable, but that the spirits do not harm men."**

Ghosts harming men is called **‘haunting’** (*suì*); men driving them away is called **‘injuring ghosts’**. The people breaking laws is called **‘the people injuring the ruler’**; the ruler punishing the people is called **‘the ruler injuring the people’**. If the people do not break laws, the ruler also does not execute punishments; the ruler not executing punishments is called **‘the ruler not harming the people’**.

Thus it is said: **"The Sage also does not harm the people."** The ruler does not harm the people, and the people do not harm the ghosts, thus it is said: **"Both do not harm each other."**

If the people dare not break laws, then the ruler internally does not need to rely on punishments, and externally does not need to exploit their wealth. The ruler internally not relying on punishments and externally not exploiting their wealth means the people multiply and thrive. The people multiplying and thriving with abundant stores—this is called **‘having **virtue/power**’**.

In general, what is called **‘haunting’** is when the **soul and vital essence** (*húnpò*) depart and the **spirit and **qi**** become disordered; **spirit and **qi**** disordered means there is no **virtue/power**. Ghosts not haunting men means the **soul and vital essence** do not depart, and the **spirit and **qi**** do not become disordered; **spirit and **qi**** not disordered is called **‘having **virtue/power**’**.

The ruler amasses abundant stores, yet the ghosts do not disturb the people’s **spirit and qi**, then **virtue/power** is fully with the people.

Thus it is said: **“Both do not harm each other, then mutual harmony is achieved.”** It speaks of **virtue/power** flourishing above and below, returning together to the people.

A **Dao/Way**-governed ruler has no grievances or feuds (*yuānchóu*) with neighboring enemies, yet within he bestows **virtue/power** and blessings upon the people. When there are no grievances with neighboring enemies, his treatment of the feudal lords is marked by external propriety and righteousness. When he bestows **virtue/power** upon the people, his governance focuses on the essentials. Treating feudal lords with propriety and righteousness means few military campaigns arise; governing the people by attending to the essentials means licentiousness and extravagance cease.

In general, horses are used greatly for two purposes: externally to supply armor and weapons, and internally to indulge in licentiousness and extravagance. Now, a **Dao/Way**-governed ruler seeks minimal use of armor and weapons externally, yet restrains licentiousness and extravagance internally. The ruler does not drive horses in battle or chase fleeing foes, nor do the people use horses to indulge in distant licentiousness or frivolous pursuits. Their accumulated strength lies solely in the fields, and the fields are cultivated with manure and irrigation—thus it is said: **“When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, horses are turned back to feed the fields.”**

If a ruler lacks the **Dao/Way**, then internally he tyrannizes and oppresses his people, while externally he invades and deceives his neighboring states. Internal tyranny exhausts the people’s resources, and external aggression provokes frequent wars. When resources are exhausted, livestock dwindles; when wars multiply, soldiers are depleted. Livestock dwindling means warhorses are scarce, and soldiers depleted means the army is in grave danger. Warhorses scarce, the ruler sends his own steeds to battle; the army in peril, he conscripts his close ministers. Horses, being the army’s greatest asset, and the term *郊* (*jiāo*) denoting proximity—now, the means to supply the army’s needs comes from the ruler’s own steeds and close ministers—thus it is said: **“When the **Dao/Way** is absent in the world, warhorses are born in the suburbs.”**

If a man has desires, his plans and gatherings become disordered; when plans and gatherings are disordered, his desires grow more extreme. When desires become extreme, wicked thoughts prevail; when wicked thoughts prevail, his undertakings grow reckless and are abandoned. Reckless abandonment of undertakings brings misfortune and calamity. Thus, observing this, misfortune and calamity arise from wicked thoughts, and wicked thoughts are provoked by what is desirable.

The types of what is desirable—when pursued, they corrupt good people into wickedness; when avoided, they bring calamity to the virtuous. When wickedness arises, the ruler invades weak states; when calamity strikes, the people suffer greatly. Therefore, the types of what is desirable cause the ruler to invade weak states and harm the people.

To invade weak states and harm the people—this is a grave offense. Thus it is said: **“No calamity is greater than what is desirable.”**

Hence, the sage does not indulge in the five colors, nor does he wallow in music and song. A wise ruler despises frivolous luxuries and rejects excessive ornamentation. Since humans lack fur or feathers, if they are not clothed, they will suffer from cold. The ruler does not cling to heaven, nor does he attach to the earth; his vital roots are his intestines and stomach. If he does not eat, he cannot live. Therefore, the heart of desire for profit cannot be avoided; if this desire is not removed, it will bring him suffering.

Thus the sage dresses sufficiently to ward off cold and eats sufficiently to fill his emptiness, then he has no suffering. Common people are not so—when they possess vast wealth as feudal lords or even a small surplus of thousands in gold, their suffering from desires is never removed. All are enslaved to it; those condemned to death are spared, yet those who do not know contentment suffer throughout their lives. Thus it is said: **“No calamity is greater than not knowing contentment.”**

Desire for profit is more severe than suffering; suffering brings illness, and illness causes wisdom and insight to decline. When wisdom and insight decline, he loses moderation and measure; when he loses moderation and measure, he acts rashly and recklessly. Rash and reckless actions lead to calamity and harm, and when calamity and harm strike, they breed within him. When they breed within him, his external suffering grows thin, yet pain and torment mix within his intestines and stomach. When pain and torment mix within his intestines and stomach, they weaken his person; weakened, he withdraws and blames himself. Withdrawal and self-blame arise from desire for profit—thus it is said: **“No blame is more severe than desire for profit.”**

The **Dao/Way** is the principle (*lǐ*) by which all things exist, and the standard by which all affairs are measured. Affairs (*lǐ*) are the patterns that complete and define all things.

The **Dao/Way** is that by which all things are completed. Therefore it is said: The **Dao/Way** is the principle (*lǐ*) that governs all things.

Things possess principles that cannot be violated; since things possess principles that cannot be violated, principles thus become the measure by which things are regulated. All things have their distinct principles, yet the **Dao/Way** exhaustively examines all principles of things, hence it must transform. Since it must transform, it has no fixed operation. Without fixed operation, life and death arise within its qi, all wisdom weighs its measures, and all affairs wax and wane. Heaven obtains it and thereby attains height; Earth obtains it and thereby attains concealment; the Big Dipper obtains it and thereby establishes its majesty; the Sun and Moon obtain it and thereby maintain their luminosity; the Five Phases obtain it and thereby maintain their positions; the stars obtain it and thereby align their courses; the Four Seasons obtain it and thereby govern their shifting qi; the Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby dominated the four quarters; the Red Pine obtained it and thereby harmonized with Heaven and Earth; the Sage obtained it and thereby perfected culture and rites.

The **Dao/Way** shares wisdom with Yao and Shun, shares madness with Jieyu, shares destruction with Jie and Zhou, and shares prosperity with Tang and Wu. When it seems near, it roams the four extremities; when it seems far, it abides at my side. When it seems obscure, its light is radiant; when it seems bright, its essence is murky. Yet it accomplishes the work of Heaven and Earth, harmonizes transformations like thunder and lightning, and all things within the cosmos rely upon it to be completed.

The nature of the **Dao/Way** is such that without regulation, it takes no form; it is soft and weak, adapting to the times, responding to principles. All things obtain it and thereby die, obtain it and thereby live; all affairs obtain it and thereby fail, obtain it and thereby succeed. The **Dao/Way** is like water: the drowning drink it and die, the thirsty drink it and live. It is like swords and spears: the foolish use them in wrath and bring calamity, the Sage uses them to punish tyranny and brings blessings. Thus, obtaining it leads to death, obtaining it leads to life, obtaining it leads to failure, obtaining it leads to success.

People rarely see a living elephant, yet they obtain the bones of a dead one and study its form to imagine its life; thus, what all people conceive in their minds is called its "symbol." Now, though the **Dao/Way** cannot be heard or seen, the Sage observes its effects and thereby perceives its form, hence it is said: "The form without form, the symbol without substance."

Principles are the distinctions of square and round, short and long, coarse and fine, firm and brittle. Thus, when principles are established, only then can things obtain the **Dao/Way**. Therefore, established principles entail existence and nonexistence, life and death, flourishing and decline. If a thing exists and then perishes, now dies and now lives, first flourishes and then declines, it cannot be called constant. Only that which exists alongside Heaven and Earth’s division and does not die or decline when Heaven and Earth disperse is called constant. Yet constant is unchanging, without fixed principles; without fixed principles, it is not within the constant. Thus, it cannot be spoken of. The Sage observes its mysterious void, employs its pervasive operation, and forcefully names it the **Dao/Way**; yet it can be discussed, hence it is said: "The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken of is not the eternal **Dao/Way**."

Human beings begin in life and end in death. The beginning is called emergence, the end is called return, hence it is said: "Emerging from life, returning to death." The human body has three hundred and sixty joints, four limbs, and nine orifices—these are its major components. The four limbs and nine orifices, thirteen in total, all their movements and stasis belong to life. To belong is to be its attendant, hence it is said: "The thirteen attendants of life." When death comes, these thirteen components all return and belong to death; death’s attendants are also thirteen, hence it is said: "The thirteen attendants of life, the thirteen attendants of death."

For those who live and live, motion is inherent; motion exhausted leads to depletion, yet motion does not cease, hence depletion does not cease, and when depletion ceases, life ends—this is called death. Thus, the thirteen components all become the domain of death. Hence it is said: "The people’s life is life and motion, motion all leads to the domain of death, to the thirteen."

Thus, the Sage cherishes spirit and values stillness, for this is far greater than the harm of rhinoceros and tigers. Rhinoceros and tigers have boundaries, their movements and stasis have their times; avoiding their boundaries and observing their times, one escapes the harm of rhinoceros and tigers. People know only of the claws and horns of rhinoceros and tigers, yet do not know that all things possess claws and horns. They do not escape the harm of all things.

How can this be explained? When timely rains gather and the wilderness lies still, yet one violates the mountains and rivers at dawn or dusk, the claws and horns of rhinoceros and tigers harm them. When one serves superiors disloyally and lightly violates prohibitions, the claws and horns of punishments and laws harm them. When one conducts oneself in the countryside without moderation and lacks measured affection, the claws and horns of strife harm them. When one indulges desires without limit and lacks moderation in movement and stasis, the claws and horns of sores and abscesses harm them. When one favors private cleverness and abandons principles, the claws and horns of nets and snares harm them.

Rhinoceros and tigers have boundaries, yet all harms have origins; avoiding their boundaries and blocking their origins, one escapes all harms. Armies and warfare are meant to prepare for harm. Even those who value life, when entering the military, must have no wrathful or contentious hearts; without wrathful or contentious hearts, there is no need for preparations against harm. This is not only for those stationed in the wilderness: the Sage moves through the world without harming others, and without harming others, there will surely be no one harming them. Without anyone harming them, there is no need to prepare against others, hence it is said: "Traveling on land, one does not encounter rhinoceros and tigers."

Entering the mountains without relying on defenses to avoid harm, hence it is said: "Entering the military without donning armor and weapons." Distancing oneself from all harms, hence it is said: "The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn, the tiger has no place to strike its claw, weapons have no place to sharpen their blades." Without defenses, there will surely be no harm—this is the principle of Heaven and Earth. Embracing the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth, hence it is said: "There is no domain of death."

Moving without encountering peril, this is called skillful life-nurturing.

Those who love their children are tender toward them, those who cherish life are tender toward themselves, and those who value deeds are tender toward their tasks.

A loving mother toward her weak child strives to bring her fortune, and striving to bring fortune removes her misfortunes. Removing misfortunes requires careful deliberation, and careful deliberation grasps the principles of affairs. Grasping the principles of affairs ensures success, and success means acting without doubt. Without doubt is called courage.

The Sage toward all affairs acts as tenderly as a loving mother toward her weak child, thus perceiving the Dao/Way that must be acted upon.

Perceiving the Dao/Way that must be acted upon brings clarity, and in undertaking affairs, there is no doubt—without doubt is called courage.

Courage arises from tenderness, hence it is said: *"Tender, hence able to be courageous."*

The Duke of Zhou said: *"If the winter’s frost does not solidify, then the spring and summer’s growth of plants will not flourish."* Heaven and Earth cannot always indulge in excess, much less can mortals.

Thus, all things must have periods of flourishing and decline, all affairs must have times of relaxation and tension, nations must alternate between civil and martial governance, and official administration must employ rewards and punishments.

Therefore, the wise who frugally use their wealth will have prosperous households, the Sage who cherishes their vital essence will have abundant vitality, and the ruler who values their soldiers will have a populous people.

A populous people means a broad realm, hence it is said: *"Frugal, hence able to broaden."*

All shaped things are easily measured and cut.

How so? Shape brings length and breadth, length and breadth bring size and smallness, size and smallness bring square and round, square and round bring firmness and fragility, firmness and fragility bring lightness and heaviness, lightness and heaviness bring whiteness and blackness.

Length and breadth, size and smallness, square and round, firmness and fragility, lightness and heaviness, whiteness and blackness—these are called *principles*. Principles established, things are easily measured.

Thus, speaking in grand assembly before acting ensures success—this the skilled deliberators know.

To create squares and circles while conforming to compass and set-square, then all affairs take form.

Yet all things have their compass and set-square; those who deliberate know to calculate these principles.

The Sage fully conforms to the principles of all things, hence it is said: *"Dare not lead the world."* Dare not lead the world, then all undertakings succeed, all deeds prosper, and deliberations surpass the age. To avoid great office without achieving it is impossible.

Holding great office is called *completing affairs and leading others*, hence it is said: *"Dare not lead the world, hence able to complete affairs and lead others."*

Those tender toward their children dare not deprive them of clothing and food, those tender toward themselves dare not abandon laws and measures, and those tender toward squares and circles dare not abandon compass and set-square.

Thus, facing soldiers with tenderness toward officers and soldiers ensures victory over enemies, and tenderness toward tools and weapons ensures fortified defenses.

Hence it is said: *"Tender in war, hence victorious; in defense, hence secure."*

Those who preserve themselves while fully conforming to the principles of all things must surely be *Heaven-born*. Heaven-born refers to the birth of the mind.

Thus, the Dao/Way of the world is fully realized in life, as if guarded by tenderness.

Ensuring all is complete and all actions are fitting is called *treasure*. Hence it is said: *"I have three treasures; hold them as treasures."*

The *Book* speaks of the *Great Dao* as the *Rectified Dao*, of *proper application* as the *Perverse Dao*, and of *grandeur* as *ornate beauty*. Ornate beauty is the division of the Perverse Dao.

When court dress becomes extravagant, lawsuits proliferate. Lawsuits proliferate, then fields lie fallow; fields lie fallow, then granaries empty; granaries empty, then the nation impoverishes. When the nation impoverishes and customs become licentious and extravagant, the arts of clothing and food perish, and people cannot help but resort to deceitful cleverness—knowing to adorn cleverness is called *wearing ornate attire*.

When lawsuits proliferate, granaries empty, and licentiousness becomes custom, the nation is wounded as if struck by a sharp blade. Hence it is said: *"Wearing a sharp blade."*

Those who adorn their cunning to this extent inevitably harm the nation, yet their private households grow rich. Private households grow rich, hence it is said: *"Wealth in goods remains."*

If a nation becomes thus, even the foolish cannot help but imitate their schemes, and petty thieves arise.

From this, great deceit spawns petty thieves in its wake—great deceit leads, petty thieves follow. The *suona* is the longest of the five tones, so when the *suona* leads, bells and strings follow; when the *suona* sings, all music harmonizes.

Now, when great deceit arises, the common people follow; when the common people follow, petty thieves harmonize. Thus, wearing ornate attire, wielding sharp blades, indulging in food and drink, while wealth in goods remains—this is called *the thief who plays the suona*.

No one, wise or foolish, lacks inclinations and aversions. Tranquility and simplicity know the origins of calamity and fortune.

Obtaining through desires and being alarmed by licentious things leads to chaos. This is so because external things lure, and indulgence in pleasures disrupts.

Tranquility and simplicity have the meaning of inclinations and aversions; peace and security know the calculations of calamity and fortune.

Yet now pleasures disrupt them, external things lure them, and when lured, they go—hence it is said: *"Plucked."*

The Sage is not thus. Establishing one’s inclinations and aversions, even seeing desired things cannot lure them—unable to lure is called *unplucked*. Unified in one’s nature, even with desirable things, the spirit does not move—when the spirit does not move, it is called *unpleased*.

Those who are descendants should embody this Dao to guard the ancestral temples. The ancestral temples not perishing is called *unbroken sacrifices*.

The body accumulates vitality as virtue, the family accumulates wealth as virtue, and the village, nation, and world all take the people as virtue.

Now, if governing the body and external things cannot disrupt the spirit, hence it is said: *"Cultivate the self, and its virtue becomes true."*

True virtue is the firm foundation of caution.

To govern a family, useless things cannot sway one’s plans, and thus resources remain abundant—hence it is said: *"Cultivate the family, and its virtue becomes abundant."*

Those who govern a village practice this moderation, and thus the families with abundance grow more numerous—hence it is said: *"Cultivate the village, and its virtue becomes enduring."*

Those who govern a state practice this moderation, and thus the villages with virtue grow more numerous—hence it is said: *"Cultivate the state, and its virtue becomes flourishing."*

Those who rule the world practice this moderation, and thus the people’s lives all receive its blessings—hence it is said: *"Cultivate the world, and its virtue becomes universal."*

Those who cultivate the self use this to distinguish between the noble and the petty.
Those who govern villages and states, and rule the world, each apply this principle to examine gains and losses—never failing one in a thousand—hence it is said:
*"Observe the self to understand the self,
Observe the family to understand the family,
Observe the village to understand the village,
Observe the state to understand the state,
Observe the world to understand the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
It is by this."*

**Chapter 21: Analogy of the Old**

When the world is in harmony, there are no urgent calamities—this is called *stillness*.
Horses are not driven, and thus it is said: *"Drive away the warhorses and use them for dung."*

When the world is in chaos, attacks never cease, and armies besiege for years without end.
Armor grows with lice and fleas, swallows nest in the pavilions, yet the soldiers do not return—
hence it is said: *"Warhorses breed in the suburbs."*

The **Zhì people** presented a pelt of the *Fēng fú* and a *Xuán bào* to Duke Wen of Jin.
Duke Wen accepted the gifts and sighed: *"This is using beauty to bring ruin upon oneself."*

A ruler who governs a state uses titles and honors as ruin—such was **Xu Yuanwang**.
A ruler who uses cities and lands as ruin—such were **Yu and Guo**.
Hence it is said: *"No guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable."*

**Zhì Bó** annexed **Fàn** and **Zhōngxíng**, then attacked **Zhào** relentlessly.
**Hán** and **Wèi** rebelled, defeated his army at **Jinyáng**, and he died east of **Gāoliáng**.
His state was partitioned, his head pickled as a drinking vessel—
hence it is said: *"No misfortune is greater than not knowing when to stop."*

The ruler of **Yú** sought to bend **Chǎn Chóu’s** chariot and take **Chuíjí’s** jade,
ignoring **Gōngyǒu’s** advice—
thus his state perished and he died—
hence it is said: *"No blame is more bitter than greed."*

A state’s survival is its norm—thus hegemony is possible.
Life is the norm for the body—thus wealth and honor are possible.
If one does not harm oneself, the state will not perish, and life will not end—
hence it is said: *"Knowing sufficiency is true sufficiency."*

After **Zhuāng Wáng of Chu** hunted triumphantly at **Hé Yōng**,
he rewarded **Sūn Shū’ào**, who requested the barren land between the **Hán** rivers,
a place of sand and stones.
By Chu’s law, land was reclaimed after two generations of officials—
yet **Sūn Shū’ào** alone retained his.
This was not for his own gain, but for the state’s—
thus his descendants were revered for nine generations without interruption.
Hence it is said: *"The well-established cannot be uprooted,
the well-embraced cannot be abandoned.
Thus, descendants preserve their sacrifices eternally."*
This is **Sūn Shū’ào**.

What is held firmly is *weighty*; what does not leave its place is *still*.
The weighty can command the light; the still can command the restless.
Hence it is said: *"Weight is the root of lightness,
stillness is the lord of restlessness."*
Hence it is said: *"The noble carries their baggage all day."*

A state is the sovereign’s baggage.
**Zhǔ Fǔ** abandoned his state—
thus, though he had the joys of **Dài** and **Yúnzhōng**,
he was already detached from **Zhào**.
**Zhǔ Fǔ**, a lord of ten thousand chariots,
made himself light to the world—
lightness is lack of power, restlessness is abandoning one’s place—
thus he died in exile.
Hence it is said: *"Lightness loses ministers,
restlessness loses the sovereign."*
This is **Zhǔ Fǔ**.

Power is the sovereign’s abyss.
A ruler’s power is heavier than that of ministers—
once lost, it cannot be reclaimed.
**Jian Gong of Qi** lost it to **Tián Chéng**,
**Jin Gong** lost it to the **Six Ministers**—
thus their states perished and they died.
Hence it is said: *"Fish cannot escape from the deep."*

Rewards and punishments are the state’s sharp tools—
in the hands of the sovereign, they control ministers;
in the hands of ministers, they overpower the sovereign.
When the sovereign sees rewards, ministers diminish them to claim virtue;
when the sovereign sees punishments, ministers exaggerate them to assert power.
When the sovereign rewards, ministers exploit his authority;
when the sovereign punishes, ministers exploit his threats.
Hence it is said: *"The state’s sharp tools must not be shown to others."*

**Yuè Wáng** entered **Wú** as a hostage and urged them to attack **Qí** to weaken **Wú**.
After **Wú’s** victory over **Qí** at **Àilíng**,
they displayed their strength at the **Jiāng** and **Jì** rivers,
and at **Huángpó**—
thus they could be controlled by the **Five Lakes**.
Hence it is said: *"To gather, one must first disperse.
To weaken, one must first strengthen."*

**Jìn Xiàn Gōng** wished to ambush **Yú**, gifting them with jade and horses.
**Zhì Bó** wished to ambush **Chóu Yóu**, gifting him a grand carriage.
Hence it is said: *"To take, one must first give."*

To begin an undertaking in the unseen
and achieve great deeds in the world—
this is called *subtle clarity*.
To dwell in weakness while valuing humility
is to overcome strength through self-effacement.
Things with form must arise from the small;
enduring actions must begin with the few.
Hence it is said: *"The world’s difficult tasks begin with ease,
the world’s great tasks begin with the slight."*
Thus, to master things, one must attend to their beginnings—
hence it is said: *"Plan for difficulty in its ease,
achieve greatness in its slightness."*

A thousand-cubit dike collapses from an ant’s hole;
a hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.
Hence it is said: *"White Guī blocks the dike’s holes,
the old man seals the crack with mud."*
Thus **White Guī** has no water calamity,
the old man has no fire disaster.
These are all who practice caution in ease to avoid difficulty,
and respect the slight to forestall the great.

**Biān Que** saw **Cài Huán Gōng** and stood in silence.
**Biān Que** said: *"Your Highness has an ailment in the skin and muscles—
if untreated, it may deepen."*
**Huán Gōng** said: *"I have no illness."*

Biān Que departed, and **Huán Gōng** said: *"Physicians delight in treating those who are not yet ill to claim their skill."* Ten days later, Biān Que returned and said: *"Your Highness’s ailment has reached the muscles and skin—if left untreated, it will deepen further."* **Huán Gōng** made no reply. Biān Que departed, and **Huán Gōng** was again displeased.

Ten days later, Biān Que returned once more and said: *"Your illness has now reached the intestines and stomach—if left untreated, it will grow worse."* **Huán Gōng** still made no reply. Biān Que departed, and **Huán Gōng** was again displeased.

Ten days later, Biān Que gazed at **Huán Gōng** and fled. **Huán Gōng** sent someone to ask him why, and Biān Que replied: *"When the illness is in the skin and muscles, it can be treated with steaming and acupuncture. When it reaches the intestines and stomach, it can be treated with purgatives and emetics. But when it penetrates to the bone marrow, it falls under the domain of the **Sì Mìng**—there is nothing that can be done. Now your illness has reached the bone marrow, and that is why I no longer seek to treat you."*

Five days later, **Huán Gōng** fell gravely ill and sent for Biān Que, but he had already fled to the state of **Qín**. **Huán Gōng** soon died.

Thus, a skilled physician treats illness when it is still in the skin and muscles—this is to contend with it while it is still slight. Yet the calamities and blessings of affairs also have their early stages, and so it is said: *"The wise act early."* In ancient times, the **Jìn** prince **Chóng Ěr**, fleeing into exile, passed through **Zhèng**. The ruler of **Zhèng** treated him without proper courtesy, and **Shū Zhān** advised him: *"This is a virtuous prince. If you honor him generously, you will accumulate virtue."* The ruler of **Zhèng** did not heed him. **Shū Zhān** again advised: *"If you do not honor him generously, then kill him—do not let this become a future calamity."* The ruler of **Zhèng** still did not listen.

When the prince returned to **Jìn** and ascended the throne, he raised an army to attack **Zhèng**, defeating them and seizing eight of its cities.

**Jìn Xiàn Gōng**, using the **Chuí Jí** jade as a pretext, sought passage through **Yú** to attack **Guó**. The minister **Gōng Zhī Qí** advised against it: *"When the lips perish, the teeth will grow cold. If **Yú** and **Guó** aid each other, it is not out of kindness. Today, **Jìn** will destroy **Guó**; tomorrow, **Yú** will surely follow."* The ruler of **Yú** did not listen, accepting the jade and granting passage. **Jìn** took **Guó** and, upon returning, turned and destroyed **Yú**.

These two ministers—**Shū Zhān** and **Gōng Zhī Qí**—were both contending in the early stages, yet their rulers did not heed them. Thus, **Shū Zhān** and **Gōng Zhī Qí** were like **Biān Que** to **Yú** and **Zhèng**, but their rulers refused to listen, so **Zhèng** was broken and **Yú** was annihilated.

Hence it is said: *"When things are stable, they are easy to preserve; when their signs are not yet manifest, they are easy to plan for."* In ancient times, **Zhòu**’s last king made ivory chopsticks, and **Jī Zǐ** feared this, saying: *"Ivory chopsticks will not be paired with earthen bowls; they will surely be matched with cups of rhinoceros horn and jade. Ivory chopsticks with jade cups will not be used for porridge of beans and millet; they will surely be paired with meats of deer, elephant, and leopard. Such feasts will not be held in thatched huts; they will surely be in nine-layered brocade halls, with lofty towers and broad chambers."* I fear the end, so I dread the beginning.

Five years later, **Zhòu**’s last king established a meat garden, set up the **páo luò** torture, climbed the **zāo qiū** mound, and overlooked the wine pool. **Zhòu**’s last king thus met his downfall. **Jī Zǐ**, seeing the ivory chopsticks, knew of the coming calamity for the realm, and so it is said: *"To see what is slight is to be clear."* **Gōu Jiàn**, enslaved in **Wú**, personally wielded weapons as **Wú**’s king’s groom, and thus was able to slay **Fū Chāi** at **Gū Sū**. **Wén Wáng**, meeting **Jìn** at the royal gate, remained composed, and **Wǔ Wáng** captured **Zhòu**’s last king at **Mù Yě**. Hence it is said: *"To hold fast to gentleness is to be strong."* The **Yuè** king’s path to hegemony did not falter from his servitude, and **Wǔ Wáng**’s kingship did not falter from his insults. Hence it is said: *"The sage does not falter, for it is because he does not falter that he remains unshaken."*

A rustic from **Sòng** found a rough jade and presented it to **Zǐ Hǎn**. **Zǐ Hǎn** refused it, and the rustic said: *"This is a treasure! It should be made into a vessel for a noble, not used by a commoner."* **Zǐ Hǎn** replied: *"You value jade as treasure, but I value not accepting your jade as treasure."* The rustic desired the jade, but **Zǐ Hǎn** did not. Hence it is said: *"To desire what is not desired is to not prize what is difficult to obtain."*

**Wáng Shòu**, carrying books as he walked, encountered **Xú Féng** on the **Zhōu** road. **Xú Féng** said: *"‘Shì’ means ‘to do.’ Doing arises from the times, and the wise have no fixed affairs. ‘Shū’ means ‘to speak.’ Speech arises from knowledge, and the wise do not hoard books. Why do you alone carry them as you walk?"* Thus, **Wáng Shòu** burned his books and danced.

Hence, the wise do not teach through words, nor do the enlightened hoard books in cases. These are the errors of the world, yet **Wáng Shòu** corrected them—this is to learn by unlearning. Hence it is said: *"To learn by unlearning is to return to what the masses err upon."*

All things have their natural forms; one should follow and guide them according to their nature, and adapt to their natural tendencies. Thus, in stillness, one establishes **virtue**; in motion, one follows the **Dao**.

A man from **Sòng** made artificial mulberry leaves from ivory for his ruler, taking three years to complete them. The leaves were so lifelike—veins and texture alike—that when mixed with real leaves, they could not be distinguished. This man thus received food and stipends from the **Sòng** court.

**Liè Zǐ** heard of this and said: *"If Heaven and Earth took three years to produce a single leaf, then things that bear leaves would be few indeed."* Thus, one should not rely on Heaven and Earth’s resources to sustain a single body, nor should one follow the **Dao**’s principles to master another’s wisdom—these are the ways of the artificial leaf. Hence, winter-plowed fields need not envy **Hòu Jì**’s harvests, nor will bountiful years blame **Zāng Guì**’s crops. With one person’s strength, **Hòu Jì** would be insufficient, but following nature, **Zāng Guì** would have more than enough. Hence it is said: *"To rely on the self-so of all things and not dare to act."*

The **kōng qiào**—the empty cavities—are the windows and doors of **spirit** and **clarity**. When the ears and eyes are exhausted by sounds and colors, and the **spirit** is drained by external appearances, the inner self has no master. If the inner self has no master, then even calamities and blessings as vast as hills and valleys cannot be discerned, and so it is said: *"Without stepping outside the door, one can know the world. Without gazing through the window, one can know the **Dao**."*

「This speaks of the **spirit**’s inseparability from its substance. **Zhao Xiang**#13 learned horsemanship from **Wang Ziqi**, but soon found himself racing with him, three times changing horses and three times finishing last. **Zhao Xiang** said: *"Your instruction in horsemanship is not yet complete."* He replied: *"The technique is complete; when applied, it leads to excess."* What is truly valued in horsemanship is that the horse’s body remains steady in the carriage, and the rider’s heart harmonizes with the horse, only then can one advance swiftly and travel far. Now, when Your Majesty finishes last, you wish to overtake me, but when you lead, you fear I will overtake you. The essence of guiding the horse and competing for distance is that there is no leading without following, nor following without leading. Yet Your Majesty’s thoughts of leading or following all depend on me—how then can you harmonize with the horse? This is why Your Majesty always finishes last.

**Bai Gong**#13 considered the rebellion, and after dismissing the court and leaning on his staff, he struck his sharp weapon against his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he remained unaware. The people of Zheng heard of this and said: *"His chin is forgotten, but what else will he forget?"* Hence it is said: *"The farther one’s actions extend, the less one’s wisdom remains."* This means that wisdom is limited in its reach—what it neglects is near at hand. Thus, the **sage** has no fixed course of action. Able to unify wisdom, it is said: *"Without action, one knows."* Able to unify vision, it is said: *"Without sight, one perceives."* Following the times to act, leveraging resources to achieve merit, utilizing the capacities of all things to reap their benefits—hence it is said: *"Without effort, one attains success."*

The **King of Chu**#10 ruled for three years without issuing orders or enacting policies. **You Si Ma**#10, the right minister, sat beside him and whispered: *"There is a bird perched upon the mound in the southern lands. For three years it neither flaps its wings nor flies nor cries, but remains silent and motionless. What is its name?"* The king replied: *"For three years it does not flap its wings, so that it may grow long feathers. It neither flies nor cries, so that it may observe the people’s conduct. Though it does not fly now, when it does, it will ascend to the heavens. Though it does not cry now, when it does, its voice will astonish the world."* You understood this, and now I have no need to explain. After half a year, he began to govern himself. He removed ten officials, appointed nine, executed five high ministers, and elevated six recluses. Thus, the state became greatly ordered. He raised an army to attack **Qi**, defeated them at Xu State, triumphed over **Jin** at the Yellow River, assembled the feudal lords at Song, and thereby became the **Hegemon** of the world. The **King of Chu**#10 did not act for petty gains, hence his great reputation. He did not reveal his intentions prematurely, hence his great achievements. Therefore it is said: *"Great vessels are fashioned late, great sounds are rare in voice."* The **King of Chu**#10 intended to attack **Yue**, but **Du Zi**#10 advised him: *"Why does Your Majesty wish to attack Yue?"* He replied: *"Their governance is chaotic and their army is weak."* **Du Zi** said: *"I share Your Majesty’s concern."* Wisdom is like the eyes: they can see a hundred paces away but cannot see their own eyelashes. Your Majesty’s army was already defeated by **Qin** and **Jin**, losing hundreds of miles of territory—this is the weakness of the army. **Zhuang Shao**#10 became a brigand within the borders, yet the officials could not suppress him—this is the chaos of governance. Your Majesty’s weakness and disorder are not inferior to Yue’s, yet you wish to attack them—this is wisdom like the eyes. The king thus halted his plans. Hence, the difficulty of knowing lies not in seeing others, but in seeing oneself. Therefore it is said: *"Self-awareness is called clarity."* **Zi Xia**#10 saw **Zeng Zi**, who remarked: *"Why do you appear so plump?"* He replied: *"Because of victory in battle."* **Zeng Zi** said: *"Why do you speak thus?"* **Zi Xia** said: *"When I reflect inwardly upon the **Dao** of the ancient kings, I am honored by it. When I observe outwardly the pleasures of wealth and nobility, I am again honored by them. These two forces contend within my breast, and I do not yet know which will triumph—hence my emaciation."* Now, the **Dao** of the ancient kings prevails, hence my plumpness. Thus, the difficulty of **will** is not in overcoming others, but in overcoming oneself. Therefore it is said: *"Self-mastery is called strength."*

The **Kingdom of Zhou** possessed a jade tablet. **Zhou You**#13 commanded **Jiao Li**#13 to demand it, but **Wen Wang**#13 did not comply. **Fei Zhong**#13 came to request it, and he gave it to him. Though **Jiao Li** was virtuous and **Fei Zhong** unprincipled, **Zhou** hated the rise of the virtuous, hence it gave the tablet to **Fei Zhong**. **Wen Wang**#13 elevated **Tai Gong**#13 at the banks of **Wei**—this was to honor him. Yet granting **Fei Zhong** the jade tablet was to love him. Therefore it is said: *"If one does not honor one’s teacher nor love one’s resources, even if one knows the great **Dao**, it is called essential subtlety."*

Tang, fearing that the world would accuse him of greed after conquering Jie, thus ceded the Mandate to Wu Guang. Yet he dreaded that Wu Guang would accept it, so he sent someone to persuade Wu Guang: *"Tang slew his lord and seeks to leave a foul reputation upon his son—thus he cedes the Mandate to you."* Wu Guang then cast himself into the River.

The Duke of Qin ordered Gan Mao to choose between becoming his attendant or his envoy. Meng Ao replied: *"My lord, it would be better to become an attendant. Your strength lies in dispatching others. Even if you become an attendant, the king will still dispatch you as his envoy. If you wear the seal of an attendant while acting as an envoy, you will hold two offices at once."*

Zi Yu met Confucius at the court of Shang’s Grand Steward. After Confucius left, Zi Yu entered and asked about the guest. The Grand Steward said: *"I have already seen Confucius—when I looked at you, you seemed no more than a flea!"* *"I shall now present him to the lord."* Zi Yu, fearing Confucius would rise in favor, told the Grand Steward: *"The lord has already seen Confucius—Confucius will surely regard you as no more than a flea!"* The Grand Steward thus refused to see him again.

When the Prince of Wei formed the alliance at Jiuli, intending to revive his claim as the Son of Heaven, Peng Xi advised the Lord of Zheng: *"Do not heed him. Great states hate the Son of Heaven; small states benefit from him. If you do not heed the great, how can Wei alone establish him?"*

When the Jin attacked Jing, Duke Huan of Qi prepared to rescue it, but Bao Shu said: *"Too hasty! If Jing does not fall, Jin will not be exhausted, and if Jin is not exhausted, Qi will not grow heavy. Moreover, the merit of rescuing the perilous does not compare to the virtue of preserving the doomed. It would be better to delay and exhaust Jin—this would truly benefit Qi. Wait until Jing falls, then restore it; such a name would be truly glorious."* Duke Huan thus did not rescue it.

When Zi Xu fled, a border guard captured him. Zi Xu said: *"The lord seeks me because I possess a fine pearl. Now that I have lost it, I shall say you swallowed it."* The guard then released him.

When Qing Feng rebelled in Qi and sought to flee to Yue, his kinsmen said: *"Jin is nearby—why not go there?"* Qing Feng replied: *"Yue is distant, and distance is advantageous for evading disaster."* His kinsmen said: *"If you do not change this resolve, you may dwell in Jin. But if you do not change it, even in distant Yue, how can you find peace?"*

When Zhì Bó demanded land from Wei Xuanzi, Wei refused. Ren Zhang said: *"Why not grant it?"* Wei Xuanzi replied: *"He requests land without cause, so I do not grant it."* Ren Zhang said: *"If he demands land without cause, neighboring states will fear him. If he is insatiable, the world will dread him. If you grant him land, Zhì Bó will grow arrogant and scorn his enemies. Neighboring states will fear him and unite against him. If they use their united forces against a reckless state, the fate of the Zhì clan will not endure."* The *Book of Zhou* says: *"To defeat him, first aid him. To take from him, first give."* My lord should grant him land to provoke Zhì Bó’s arrogance. Moreover, why should you alone risk the world’s schemes against the Zhì clan while using our state as their hostage?" Wei Xuanzi said: *"Well spoken."* He then granted Zhì Bó a city of ten thousand households. Zhì Bó rejoiced and demanded land from Zhao, who refused. He then besieged Jinyang, with Han and Wei turning against him from without, while the Zhao clan responded from within—thus the Zhì clan perished.

When Duke Kang of Qin built a terrace for three years, the people rose in rebellion, intending to use force against Qi. Ren Wang said: *"Famine summons soldiers, sickness summons soldiers, toil summons soldiers, chaos summons soldiers. Your lord builds a terrace for three years—now the Chu people rise to attack Qi. I fear their attack on Qi is but a pretense, while their true intent is to ambush Qin. It would be better to prepare."* He stationed troops at the eastern border, and the Chu forces halted their march.

When Qi attacked Song, Song sent Zang Sunzi Nan to seek aid from Chu. Chu was delighted and agreed to help, greatly rejoicing. Zang Sunzi Nan returned in sorrow, and his charioteer asked: *"You sought aid and obtained it—why do you now wear a sorrowful expression?"* Zang Sunzi Nan said: *"Song is small, and Qi is great. If Chu aids small Song but angers great Qi, this is the reason for my sorrow. Yet Chu rejoices, and they will surely test my resolve. If I am steadfast and Qi is exhausted, this is Chu’s gain."* Zang Sunzi Nan then returned, and Qi seized five cities from Song while Chu’s aid never arrived.

When Duke Wen of Wei sought passage through Zhao to attack Zhongshan, Duke Xiu of Zhao nearly refused. Zhao Ke said: *"My lord errs. If Wei attacks Zhongshan and fails, Wei will be exhausted, and exhaustion will make Wei light—if Wei is light, Zhao will grow heavy. If Wei captures Zhongshan, it will not be able to cross Zhao to possess it. Thus, the state that uses force is Wei, yet the state that gains the land is Zhao. My lord must grant passage. If you grant it with great joy, they will know you benefit from it and will surely halt their march. It would be better to lend them passage, feigning reluctance."*

Yiqi Zi Pi served Tian Chengzi. When Tian Chengzi fled Qi and went to Yan, Yiqi Zi Pi carried his baggage and followed. At Wangyi, Yiqi Zi Pi said: *"Have you not heard of the serpent of the dried marsh? When the marsh dried, the serpent prepared to move. A small serpent said to the great one: ‘If you go and I follow, people will think only one serpent moves. Surely someone will kill you. It would be better if we linked together and I rode upon you—people will think you are a divine sovereign.’ So they linked and crossed the public road, and all who passed avoided them, saying: ‘A divine sovereign!’ Now you are handsome, and I am ugly. You are treated as my honored guest, a lord of a thousand chariots. You are treated as my envoy, a minister of ten thousand chariots. It would be better for you to be my attendant."* Tian Chengzi thus carried his baggage and followed him to an inn, where the innkeeper treated him with great respect, offering wine and meat. The people of Wen did not receive guests, and when asked: *"Are you a guest?"*

「对曰：主人。问其巷人而不知也，吏因囚之。君使人问之曰：子非周人也，而自谓非客何也？
对曰：臣少也诵诗曰：普天之下，莫非王土；率土之滨，莫非王臣。今君，天子，则我天子之臣也，岂有为人之臣而又为之客哉？故曰主人也。」
**Translation:**
*"He replied: ‘I am the host.’ When asked by the neighborhood officials, he did not know them, and so they had him arrested. The lord sent someone to inquire, saying: ‘You are not a subject of Zhou, yet you claim not to be a guest—why is that?’*
*He replied: ‘As a youth, I recited the *Shijing*: “Under the whole heaven, there is no land that is not the king’s territory; along the borders of the land, there is no subject who does not belong to the king.” Now, you are the sovereign, so I am a subject of the sovereign—how could I be a subject of one and yet a guest of another?’ That is why I said, ‘I am the host.’”*
*The lord then ordered his release.*

「韩宣王谓樛留曰：吾欲两用公仲、公叔，其可乎？」

「对曰：不可。晋用六卿而国分，简公两用田成、阚止而简公杀，魏两用犀首、张仪而西河之外亡。今王两用之，其多力者树其党，寡力者借外权。群臣有内树党以骄主，有外为交以削地，则王之国危矣。」
**Translation:**
*"He replied: ‘It is not permissible. When Jin employed the six ministers, the state was divided. Duke Jian of Qi (简公) simultaneously employed **Tian Cheng** (田成) and **Kan Zhi** (阚止), and Duke Jian was killed. Wei simultaneously employed **Xi Shou** (犀首) and **Zhang Yi** (张仪), and lost all lands beyond the **Xi River** (西河). Now, if Your Majesty employs both, the more powerful will rally their factions, while the weaker will seek external alliances. Some ministers will foster internal cliques to defy their lord, others will forge foreign ties to diminish the realm—then Your Majesty’s state will be in peril.’"*

「对曰：桀以醉亡天下，而康诰曰：毋彝酒者，彝酒，常酒也；常酒者，天子失天下，匹夫失其身。管仲、隰朋从於桓公而伐孤竹，春往冬反，迷惑失道。管仲曰：老马之智可用也。乃放老马而随之，遂得道。行山中无水，隰朋曰：蚁冬居山之阳，夏居山之阴，蚁壤一寸而仞有水。乃掘地，遂得水。以管仲之**圣** (wisdom/virtue), 隰朋之**智** (wisdom), till their limits of knowledge, they did not hesitate to learn from the old horse and the ants—yet now, people do not know to use their humble minds to learn from the **sages** (圣人), is this not excessive?’」
**Translation:**
*"He replied: ‘King Jie lost the **dharma** (天下) through drunkenness, and the **Kang Gao** (康诰) admonished: “Do not drink to excess, for excessive drinking is habitual drinking; habitual drinking will cause the sovereign to lose his **dharma** and a commoner to lose his life.” When **Guan Zhong** (管仲) and **Yi Peng** (隰朋) followed Duke Huan of Qi (桓公) in attacking **Gu Zhu** (孤竹), they set out in spring and returned in winter, lost and bewildered in their path. Guan Zhong said: ‘The wisdom of the old horse can be utilized.’ So he released the old horse and followed it, and thus found the way. Traveling through the mountains without water, Yi Peng remarked: ‘Ants dwell on the sunny side in winter and the shady side in summer; where their mound is one inch thick, there is water nearby.’ So they dug the earth, and thus found water. With **Guan Zhong’s virtue** (圣) and **Yi Peng’s wisdom** (智), even when they reached the limits of their knowledge, they did not hesitate to learn from the old horse and the ants—yet now, people do not know to use their humble minds to learn from the **sages** (圣人), is this not excessive?’"*

「有献不死之药於荆王者，谒者操之以入，中射之士问曰：可食乎？曰：可。因夺而食之。王大怒，使人杀中射之士，中射之士使人说王曰：臣问谒者曰可食，臣故食之。是臣无罪，而罪在谒者也。且客献不死之药，臣食之，而王杀臣，是死药也，是客欺王也。夫杀无罪之臣，而明人之欺王也，不如释臣。王乃不杀。」
**Translation:**
*"There was one who presented an **elixir of immortality** (不死之药) to King Jing of Chu (荆王). The **attendant** (谒者) took it and entered, and the **archer** (中射之士) asked: ‘Is it edible?’ The attendant replied: ‘It is.’ The archer then seized and ate it. The king flew into a great rage and ordered the archer’s execution. The archer sent someone to plead with the king, saying: ‘I asked the attendant whether it was edible, and he said it was, so I ate it. I am without fault, while the blame lies with the attendant.’ Moreover, the guest presented an **elixir of immortality**, yet I ate it and the king would execute me—this would make it a **poison of death** (死药), and the guest would be deceiving the king. To kill a guiltless subject and yet reveal that someone deceived the king—it would be better to pardon me. The king then did not execute him."*

To fetch water from the sea when a fire has broken out—though the sea may be vast, the fire would surely not be extinguished; distant water cannot quench nearby flames.

**Translation:**
*"When **King Zhou** (纣) made **ivory chopsticks** (象箸), **Ji Zi** (箕子) was alarmed, fearing that ivory chopsticks would not harmonize with **clay food vessels** (土簋)—and so there would surely be **rhinoceros and jade cups** (犀玉之杯). With jade cups and ivory chopsticks, they would surely not contain **beans and millet** (菽藿)—and so there would surely be **tusked elephants, leopard skins, and tiger pelts** (旄象豹胎). With such skins, they would surely not wear **coarse hemp garments** (短褐) nor dwell beneath **thatched roofs** (茅茨之下)—and so there would surely be **nine-layered silken robes** (锦衣九重) and **lofty towers with spacious halls** (高台广室).’"*

«When one **judges by this** (称此) to **seek** (以求), then the **world will have no end** (天下不足矣).

The **Sage** (圣人) **perceives the subtle to know its sprouting** (见微以知萌), **sees the beginning to know its end** (见端以知末), and thus, **seeing the ivory chopsticks** (见象箸) and **fearing** (而怖), **knows the world’s insatiable desires** (知天下知不足也).

**King Wu of the Zhou** (周公旦) had already **defeated the Shang** (已胜殷), and was about to **attack the states of Shang and Ge** (将攻商、盖). **Xin Gong Jia** (辛公甲) said: **«Great difficulties are hard to attack, but small ones are easily subdued; it is better to subdue the many small ones to coerce the great one»** (大难攻，小易服，不如服众小以劫大). Thus, he **attacked the Nine Yi tribes** (乃攻九夷), and **Shang and Ge submitted** (而商、盖服矣).

**King Zhou** (纣) **made it a habit to drink all night** (为长夜之饮), **fearing that he might lose the day** (惧以失日), yet **none of his attendants knew the reason** (问其左右尽不知也). He then ordered them to **ask Ji Zi** (乃使问箕子).

Ji Zi **replied to his disciples** (为其徒曰): **«To be the ruler of the world and yet have an entire kingdom lose track of the day—this is perilous indeed!** (为天下主而一国皆失日，天下其危矣). **If an entire kingdom does not know this, yet I alone do—then I am in grave danger!** (一国皆不知而我独知之，吾其危矣).» He **excused himself with the claim of drunkenness** (辞以醉而不知).

A **man from Lu** (鲁人) was skilled at **weaving straw sandals** (身善织屦), his wife at **recognizing fine silk headbands** (妻善识缟), yet they **migrated to Yue** (而徙於越). Some said to them: **«You shall surely fall into poverty!** (子必穷矣).» The man from Lu asked: **«Why so?** (何也？)» They replied: **«Straw sandals are meant for wearing, yet Yue people go barefoot. Fine silk headbands are meant for coronation, yet Yue people wear their hair unbound.** (屦为履之也，而越人跣行。 缟为冠之也，而越人被发). **With your strengths suited to a land that does not use them, you wish to avoid ruin—how can this be?** (以子之所长，游於不用之国，欲使无穷，其可得矣).»

**Chen Zhen** (陈轸) was **held in high esteem by the King of Wei** (贵於魏王#2), yet **Hui Zi** (惠子) said: **«He must surely be adept at currying favor with his attendants!** (必善事左右). **If you plant a willow upright, it grows; if you plant it sideways, it still grows; even if you break it and plant it again, it grows.** (夫杨横树之即生，倒树之即生，折而树之又生). **Yet if ten men plant it while one pulls it up, even the willow cannot grow.** (然使十人树之而一人拔之，即无生杨至). **With ten men nurturing something so easily grown, yet unable to withstand one person—why is this?** (以十人之众，树易生之物，而不胜一人者何也？) **The difficulty lies in planting it, while removing it is easy!** (树之难而去之易也). **Though Chen Zhen may excel at cultivating favor with the king, those who wish to remove him are many—he is in danger indeed!** (子虽工自树於王，而欲去子者众，子必危矣).»

**Lu Ji Sun** (鲁季孙) had just **assassinated his lord** (新弒其君), and **Wu Qi** (吴起) **took service there** (仕焉). Some said to Wu Qi: **«When a man dies, his blood first flows, then his nose bleeds, then his body turns cold, then it turns to ash, then to dust—once returned to dust, there is nothing more to be done!** (夫死者，始死而血，已血而衄，已衄而灰，已灰而土，反其土也，无可为者矣). **Now Ji Sun has just begun with the blood—his end is yet unknown!** (今季孙乃始血，其毋乃未可知也).» Wu Qi **thereupon left for Jin** (因去之晋).

**Wei Si Mi** (隰斯弥) **visited Tian Cheng Zi** (见田成子), and Tian Cheng Zi **invited him onto a viewing platform to survey the land** (与登台四望). **Three sides were barren** (三面皆畼), but when they **looked south**, the trees of Wei Si Mi’s home **obscured the view** (隰子家之树蔽之). Tian Cheng Zi **said nothing** (田成子亦不言). Wei Si Mi returned and **ordered his servants to cut them down** (使人伐之), but after only a few strokes of the axe (斧离数创), he **stopped them** (隰子止之). His attendant asked: **«Why halt the axe so often?** (何变之数也？)» Wei Si Mi replied: **«There is an old saying: ‘He who knows the fish in the depths is doomed to misfortune!’** (古者有谚曰：知渊中之鱼者不祥). **Tian Cheng Zi is about to undertake a great affair** (夫田子将有事), **and I have shown him my knowledge of trifles—this will surely bring me danger!** (事大，而我示之知微，我必危矣). **Not cutting the trees is no crime** (不伐树未有罪也), **but knowing what others do not speak of—this is a grave offense!** (知人之所不言，其罪大矣).» He **refrained from cutting them** (乃不伐也).

**Yang Zi** (杨子) **passed through a lodging in the eastern part of Song** (过於宋东之逆旅), where the **innkeeper had two concubines** (有妾二人), **the ugly one favored** (其恶者贵), and **the beautiful one neglected** (美者贱). Yang Zi **inquired about this** (问其故), and the **innkeeper’s father answered** (逆旅之父答曰): **«The beautiful one is beautiful in herself, yet I do not know her beauty; the ugly one is ugly in herself, yet I do not know her ugliness»** (美者自美，吾不知其美也，恶者自恶，吾不知其恶也). Yang Zi **told his disciples** (谓弟子曰): **«To act with virtue yet abandon the mind of virtue—where can one go without failing to excel?** (行贤而去自贤之心，焉往而不美).»

A **man from Wei** (卫人) **instructed his son upon marrying him off** (嫁其子), saying: **«Accumulate wealth for yourself in secret!** (必私积聚). **To leave as a widow is common** (为人妇而出，常也), **but to return as a widow is a stroke of luck!** (其成居，幸也).» His son **thereupon secretly accumulated wealth** (其子因私积聚), but his mother-in-law **thought him too greedy and drove him out** (其姑以为多私而出之). The son **reflected on his actions twice as much as when he was married** (其子所以自反者倍其所以嫁). His father **did not blame himself for teaching his son wrongly** (其父不自罪於教子非也), yet **he knew his own wealth had increased** (而自知其益富). **«Nowadays, ministers who hold office are all of this sort!** (今人臣之处官者皆是类也).»

**Lu Dan** (鲁丹) **three times advised the lord of Zhongshan** (三说中山之君), yet the lord **did not accept** (而不受也). Lu Dan **thereupon scattered fifty pieces of gold to bribe the lord’s attendants** (因散五十金事其左右), and **when he returned**, before he could even speak, the lord **offered him food** (复见，未语，而君与之食). Lu Dan **left without returning to his lodging** (出), and **departed Zhongshan** (遂去中山). His **charioteer said** (其御曰): **«He returned to see you, yet you began to treat him well only now—why did you leave him?** (反见，乃始善我，何故去之？)» Lu Dan replied: **«If one praises me through others, they will surely condemn me through others!** (夫以人言善我，必以人言罪我). **Before I even left the borders, the prince already hated me, saying:** ‘He came from Zhao to **spy on Zhongshan** (间中山).’ **The lord then searched for me and found fault with me!** (未出境，而公子恶之曰：为赵来间中山。 君因索而罪之).»

**Tian Bo Ding** (田伯鼎) **loved men of virtue and preserved his lord** (好士而存其君), while **Bai Gong** (白公) **loved men of virtue yet brought chaos to Jing** (好士而乱荆), their **love of virtue being the same** (其好士则同), yet **their results differing** (其所以为则异). **Gong Sun You** (公孙友) **self-mutilated his foot to gain honor from Bai Li** (自刖而尊百里), and **Zhi Diao** (竖刁) **self-mutilated his genitals to speak with Duke Huan** (自宫而谓桓公), their **self-inflicted punishments being the same** (其自刑则同), yet **their motives differing** (其所以自邢之为则异).

**Hui Zi** (慧子) said: **«Those who flee eastward, their pursuers also flee eastward—though their fleeing eastward is the same** (往者东走，逐者亦东走，其东走则同), **their reasons for fleeing differ** (其所以东走之为则异).» Thus it is said: **«Men who share the same pursuits must be carefully examined!** (故曰：同事之人，不可不审察也#3).»

**From the *Sayings of the Grove* (说林下), the twenty-third entry:**

**Bo Le** (伯乐) **taught two men to observe horses**, and they **went together to inspect the horses in the stables of Duke Jian** (相与之简子厩观马). One man **pointed out a horse with a high-stepping gait** (一人举踶马), and the other **followed behind, tracing its movements** (其一人从后而循之). After **three strokes to its hindquarters** (三抚其尻), the horse **did not lift its feet** (而马不踶). The first man **thought he had failed in his observation** (此自以为失相). The second man said: **«You have not failed in your observation!** (子非失相也). **This horse has a swollen shoulder and a knotted knee!** (此其为马也，踒肩而肿膝). **He who observes horses must lift the hindquarters while bearing the weight on the forelegs—yet a knotted knee cannot bear the weight!** (夫踶马者也，举后而任前，肿膝不可任也，故后不举). **You are skilled at observing a high-stepping gait, yet clumsy at bearing the weight of a knotted knee!** (子巧于相踶马而拙于任肿膝). **In affairs, there are always essentials that must be fulfilled—yet you cannot bear the weight of what is essential, and this is a wisdom known only to the wise!** (夫事有所必归，而以有所肿膝而不任，智者之所独知也).»

**Hui Zi** (惠子) said: **«Place a monkey in a cage, and it will behave like a pig!** (置猿于柙中，则与豚同). **Thus, when circumstances are not favorable, it is not the proper way to display one’s abilities!** (故势不便，非所以逞能也).»

**General Wei Wen Zi** (卫将军文子) **visited Zeng Zi** (见曾子), yet **Zeng Zi did not rise to greet him but instead invited him to sit on the mat** (曾子不起而延于坐席), **and arranged his own body in the inner chamber** (正身于奥). Wen Zi **told his charioteer** (谓其御曰): **«Zeng Zi is a fool indeed!** (曾子，愚人也哉). **He must think me a virtuous man—yet how can a virtuous man fail to show respect?** (以我为君子也，君子安可毋敬也？) **Or does he think me a violent man—yet how can a violent man be insulted without fear?** (以我为暴人也，暴人安可侮也？)» Zeng Zi **did not alter his conduct** (不僇命也).»

There was a kind of bird called *Zhuó Zhuó* (翢翢), which had a heavy head and a drooping tail. When it wished to drink from the river, it would always tip over, so it held its feathers in its beak to drink. **A man who cannot drink enough is like this bird—he must not neglect to seek his feathers.**

The *bì* (鳣) resembles a snake, and the silkworm resembles a *liú* (蠋). Men see a snake and are startled, see a *liú* and their hair stands on end. Yet a fisherman carries the *bì*, and a woman picks up silkworms; where profit lies, they all become bold, like *Bī* (贲) and *Zhū* (诸).

**Master Bo Le** (伯乐) taught those he hated to judge **thousand-li horses** (千里之马), and those he loved to judge **poor, slow horses** (驽马). **Thousand-li horses are rare**, and their profit is slow, but poor horses are sold daily, with swift profit. This is what the *Zhou Shū* (周书) called **"lower words but higher use"** (下言而上用)—**deceit.**

Huan He (桓赫) said: **In the art of carving, the nose should not be made too large, nor the eyes too small.** The nose can be made small if it is too large, but it cannot be made large if it is too small. The eyes can be made large if they are too small, but they cannot be made small if they are too large. **So too in undertaking actions: if one does what cannot be undone, few mistakes will occur.**

**Chonghou** (崇侯) and **E Lai** (恶来) knew that they were unfit for **King Zhou’s punishment** (纣之诛), yet they did not see **King Wu’s destruction of him** (武王之灭之也). **Bi Gan** (比干) and **Zi Xu** (子胥) knew their lord would certainly perish, yet they did not foresee their own deaths. **Thus it is said: Chonghou and E Lai knew the heart but not the circumstances; Bi Gan and Zi Xu knew the circumstances but not the heart.** The **Sage** (圣人) is fully prepared.

**The Grand Minister of Song** (宋太宰) was **noble in virtue** (贵) yet **ruled with severity** (主断). **Ji Zi** (季子) was about to visit **Lord Song** (宋君), and **Liang Zi** (梁子) heard of it. He said: **"If you speak, you must be able to sit with the Grand Minister for three rounds; otherwise, you will not escape."** Ji Zi then **argued that the Grand Minister’s virtue was excessive and the state’s governance was too lenient** (因说以贵主而轻国).

**Yang Zhu’s younger brother** (杨朱之弟), **Yang Bu Yi** (杨布衣), went out in **plain white garments** (素衣), and when the rain came, he took off his white clothes, put on his **black garments** (缁衣), and returned. His dog did not recognize him and barked at him. Yang Bu Yi grew angry and was about to strike it, but Yang Zhu said: **"Do not strike it, brother. You would also be surprised if you did this."** He said: **"If I had sent you out with white clothes and you returned in black, would you not be astonished?"**

**Hui Zi** (惠子) said: **Yi** (羿) held the bow and arrow, drew the string, and aimed—yet the **people of Yue** (越人) all rushed to **hold the target** (持的). **A weak man** (弱子) **drew the bow**, and **a tender mother** (慈母) **entered the room and shut the door.** **Thus it is said: If Yi’s skill is certain, the people of Yue will not doubt him. If it is uncertain, even a tender mother will flee with her weak child.**

**Duke Huan of Qi** (桓公) asked **Guan Zhong** (管仲): **"Is there a limit to wealth?"** Guan Zhong replied: **"Water has a limit—where there is no water. Wealth has a limit—where it is already sufficient."** **Men cannot stop themselves at what is enough, yet how can they lose the limit of wealth?**

Among the wealthy merchants of **Song** (宋), there was **Jian Zhi Zi** (监止子), who **quarreled with another over the purchase of a rough jade worth a hundred gold pieces** (争买百金之璞玉). He **pretended to drop it and break it**, then **paid the hundred gold pieces** and **repaired the flaws**, gaining an extra thousand in profit. **There are matters where success brings ruin, and the wise avoid undertaking them—this is the profit of delay.**

A man wished to **recommend himself to King Jing of Chu** (见荆王) by **claiming he could catch deer with his bare hands** (撽鹿). When he saw the king, the king made him his charioteer, and he failed to catch the deer. **The king’s own charioteer then caught it**, and the king praised his skill. The man then said: **"The king’s other charioteers are jealous of me."** **King Jing of Chu** (荆王) ordered **Prince Zhi** (公子) to **attack Chen** (陈), and an old man sent him off, saying: **"Jin is strong—you must be cautious."** The prince replied: **"Why do you worry, old man? I will break Jin for you."** The old man said: **"Very well. I will wait outside Chen’s southern gate."** The prince asked: **"What is this?"** The old man said: **"I laugh at Gou Jian** (勾践)—**how easily men can be like this! Yet he alone struggles for ten years in difficulty—why?"**

**Emperor Yao** (尧) **offered the realm to Xu You** (许由), but Xu You fled, abandoning his **leather cap** (皮冠) with his household servants, who hid it. **To abandon the realm yet have one’s servants hide even one’s leather cap—this is to not truly know Xu You.**

Three lice **quarreled among themselves** (相与讼). A fourth lice passed by and asked: **"What are you quarreling about?"** The three replied: **"We are disputing over fertile, moist land."** The fourth said: **"You should not fear the arrival of the sacrificial season or the drying of the straw—why worry?"** Then the three **gathered together and sucked their mother dry**, killing her. The pig’s flesh was **salted and preserved** (臞), so men did not kill it. There is a kind of worm called *huí* (蛔) or *huáng* (蚢), which has **two mouths in one body**, and they **fight over food, biting each other until they die.** **Thus, those ministers who quarrel over matters and lose their state are all like these worms.**

**If a palace has whitewashed vessels** (垩器), and there is **a cleansing agent** (涤), then **the vessels can be made spotless** (絜矣). **So too in one’s conduct: without a place to cleanse and refine, few faults will remain.**

**Prince Jiu** (公子纠) was about to cause **chaos**, so **Duke Huan of Qi** sent a messenger to observe him. The messenger reported: **"He smiles but does not rejoice; he looks but does not see—he will certainly cause chaos."** **Duke Huan of Qi then had him killed.**

**Gong Sun Hong** (公孙弘) **cut his hair short** (断发) and became **King Yue’s charioteer** (越王骑). **Gong Sun Xi** (公孙喜) had someone **sever their relationship** (绝之) by saying: **"I will not consider you my brother."** Gong Sun Hong said: **"I cut my hair short. You severed your neck and yet were used by men to lead armies, attack, and conquer—what would you say to me?"** **In the battle of Zhou Nan** (周南之战), Gong Sun Xi died.

A man lived next to a **fierce neighbor** (悍者), and wanting to **sell his home** (宅) and **avoid him**, he was told: **"That neighbor’s wealth will soon be exhausted—just wait for him."** The man replied: **"I fear that he will use my wealth to fill his own coffers."** **So he left.** **Thus it is said: One should not disregard the subtle signs of things.**

**Confucius** (孔子) said to his disciples: **"Who can guide Zi Gong to abandon his love of profit?"** Zi Gong replied: **"I, Ci, can do it."** **Confucius then tested him**, and he did not waver. Confucius said: **"Tolerant indeed! He is not swayed by profit."** **Discerning indeed! Human nature has its constancy.** **The crooked remains crooked, and the straight remains straight.**

**Confucius said: Zi Gong is not like a hare.** **In the crisis of Bai Gong** (白公之难), Zi Gong died. **Thus it is said: The straight in conduct is crooked in desire.**

**Zhong Xing Wen Zi** (晋中行文子) fled into exile. As he passed through a **county town** (县邑), his followers said: **"This is the stingy man, your old friend. Why do you not rest here?"** **Let us wait for the rear carriage.** Wen Zi replied: **"I used to love music. This man once gave me a broken zither."**

「I love adornments,」 he said. **«This man gave me a jade pendant.** **He is one who rouses me from my errors.** **But if he seeks favor from me, I fear he will use me to seek favor from others.** **So I parted from him.** **Indeed, he later collected Wen Zi’s rear carriage with two chariots and presented them to his lord.**

**Zhou Zhao** (周躁) said to **Gong Tu** (宫他): **«Tell the King of Qi for me:** **Let him use the resources of Qi to aid me in Wei, and I shall use the affairs of Wei to serve the King.**」 Gong Tu replied: **«That cannot be done.** **This would show that Wei has no resources, and the King of Qi would surely not aid one who has none, while harboring resentment toward one who does.** **You would do better to say:** **If the King desires what I offer, I shall make Wei submit to his rule.** **The King of Qi will then see you as one who possesses Wei, and he will surely rely on you.** **This way, you will have Qi’s support, and through it, both Qi and Wei will be yours.**」

**Bai Gui** (白圭) said to the **Ordering Minister of Song** (宋令尹): **«Your lord is old and governs himself well. The Master (公) has no need to act.** **Now, however, your lord is young and relies on others while seeking fame.** **It would be better to praise the King of Chu’s filial devotion.** **Then your lord will not strip the Master of his position, but will instead hold him in great respect, allowing the Master to always use Song’s strength.**」

**Guan Zhong** (管仲) and **Bao Shu** (鲍叔) said to each other: **«The lord is in great disorder. He will surely lose his kingdom.** **Among the princes of Qi, the one who can be supported is either Prince Jiu (公子纠) or Prince Bo (小白).** **We must both serve one of them, and the one who reaches him first will be the one he follows.**」 Guan Zhong then followed Prince Jiu, while Bao Shu followed Prince Bo. The people indeed killed the lord, and Prince Bo entered first to become the ruler. The people of Lu captured Guan Zhong and offered him to Prince Bo, who spoke and reconciled him. Hence the proverb: **«Even if Wu Xian is skilled in divination, he cannot divine his own fate.** **Even if the Qin physician is skilled in removing arrows, he cannot remove his own.** **With Guan Zhong’s wisdom yet awaiting Bao Shu’s aid, this is the vulgar saying of a slave selling his own fur without success, or a scholar praising his own eloquence without being believed.**»

When the **Chu King** (荆王) attacked **Wu** (吴), Wu sent **Nu Wei Jue** (沮卫蹶融) to offer provisions to the Chu army, and the general said: **«Bind him and kill him to strike the drums.**」 He asked: **«Have you come to divine (卜) for us?**」 He replied: **«Yes, I have.** **Is the divination auspicious?**」 He said: **«It is auspicious.**」 The Chu soldiers asked: **«Why then does the general wish to strike the drums with your death?**」 He replied: **«That is precisely why it is auspicious.** **The Wu envoy has come, and I saw that the general was angry.** **If the general is angry, he will dig deep trenches and build high ramparts.** **If the general is not angry, he will grow lax.** **Now, if you kill me, the Wu will surely be on their guard.** **Moreover, the divination is not for one envoy alone.** **To kill one envoy and preserve an entire state—why would it not be called auspicious?** **If the dead have no knowledge, then striking the drums with my death will be of no benefit.** **If the dead have knowledge, then at the time of battle, I shall make the drums not sound.** **The Chu will thus not kill me.**」 The Chu did not kill him.

**Zhi Bo** (智伯) was about to attack **You Yu** (仇由), but the path was impassable. He cast a great bell and sent it to You Yu’s lord, who was greatly pleased and cleared the path to welcome him. **Chi Zhang Man Zhi** (赤章曼枝) said: **«That cannot be done.** **This is how the small serves the great, but now the great comes to you.** **You will surely follow him, and you cannot welcome him.**」 You Yu’s lord did not listen and welcomed him. Chi Zhang Man Zhi then cut the axle and drove the bell away, reaching **Qi** (齐) in seven months, and You Yu was destroyed.

After **Yue** (越) had defeated **Wu** (吴), it again demanded soldiers from **Chu** (荆) to attack **Jin** (晋). **Zuo Shi Yi Xiang** (左史倚相) said to the Chu King: **«When Yue defeated Wu, its elite warriors died, its sharp troops were exhausted, and its great general was wounded.** **Now it again demands soldiers to attack Jin, showing that it is not weakened.** **It would be better to raise our army and share in the spoils of Wu.**」 The Chu King said: **«Good.**」 He then raised his army and followed Yue. The Yue King grew angry and prepared to strike them, but the minister **Zhong** (种) said: **«That cannot be done.** **Our elite warriors are dead, our great general is wounded.** **If we fight, we will surely not prevail.** **It would be better to bribe them.**」 He then gave them the southern slopes of **Lu Mountain** (露山), five hundred *li* in extent, as a bribe. The Chu did not attack.

When **Chu** (荆) attacked **Chen** (陈), **Wu** (吴) came to its aid, and the armies were separated by thirty *li*. It rained for ten days, and stars appeared at night. Zuo Shi Yi Xiang said to **Zi Qi** (子期): **«If it rains for ten days, the armor will be damp and the troops will gather.** **The Wu will surely come.** **We should prepare for them.**」 He then fortified the defenses for Chen, but they were not yet complete when the Wu arrived, saw the Chu fortifications, and retreated. Zuo Shi said: **«The Wu have retreated sixty *li*. Their nobles will rest, and their commoners will eat.** **If we march thirty *li* and strike them, we will surely defeat them.**」 He followed this advice and broke the Wu army.

**Han** (韩) and **Zhao** (赵) were at war with each other. The **Han Lord** (韩子) requested soldiers from **Wei** (魏), saying: **«I wish to borrow your army to attack Zhao.**」 **Wei Wen Hou** (魏文侯) replied: **«I and Zhao are brothers. I cannot comply.**」 Zhao then requested soldiers from Wei to attack Han, and Wen Hou said: **«I and Han are brothers. I dare not comply.**」 The two states, unable to obtain soldiers, grew angry and returned. They then realized that Wen Hou had used them to create conflict, so they both went to court him. When **Qi** (齐) attacked **Lu** (鲁), it demanded the **Zan Tripod** (谗鼎), and Lu sent it. The Qi said: **«It is false (属).**」 The Lu said: **«It is true (真).**」 Qi said: **«Let Le Zheng Zi Chun come, and we will listen to him.**」 The Lu Lord requested Le Zheng Zi Chun, who replied: **«Why not send the true tripod?**」 The Lord said: **«I love it.**」 He replied: **«I also love my lord’s trustworthiness.**»

When **Han Ji** (韩咎) was set to be king but his position was not yet secure, his younger brothers were in **Zhou** (周), and Zhou wished to honor him but feared that Han Ji would not be established. **Qi Wu Hui** (綦毋恢) said: **«It would be better to send him a hundred chariots.** **If he is established, he will say that it was a warning.** **If he is not established, he will say that you came to aid his rebellion.**」

**Jing Guo Jun** (靖郭君) was about to fortify **Xue** (薛), but many guests advised against it. Jing Guo Jun said to the **attendants** (谒者): **«Do not announce my visitors.**」 A man from Qi who wished to see him said: **«I request permission to speak three words.** **If I exceed three words, I request to be boiled.**」 Jing Guo Jun then saw him, and the guest rushed forward, saying: **«The sea has great fish.**»

The guest then turned and left. Jing Guo Jun said: **«I wish to hear your reasoning.**» The guest replied: **«I do not dare to jest with death.**» Jing Guo Jun said: **«I beg you to speak for me.**» The guest answered: **«Have you heard of the great fish of the sea?**»
Net cannot stop them, hook cannot ensnare them—when they are cast about, they lose the water, and the ants and tiny insects find their advantage.

Now, the state of **Qi** is also your sea, my lord. You have long possessed **Qi**—why would you seek **Xue** instead?
Even if you fortified **Xue** to the heavens, it would be of no use once you lost **Qi**.

Jing Guo Jun said: **«Well spoken.**» He then abandoned his plan and did not fortify **Xue**.

The younger brother of the **King of Jing** (荆王) was in **Qin**, but **Qin** refused to release him. A skilled archer said: **«If you give me a hundred *jin* of gold, I can bring him out.**»
He then loaded a hundred *jin* of gold into **Jin** (晉) and sought out **Chu Xiang** (叔向), saying: **«The younger brother of the King of Jing is in Qin, but Qin refuses to release him. I beg you to entrust this hundred *jin* of gold to Lord Chu Xiang.**»

Chu Xiang accepted the gold and presented it to **Jin Ping Gong** (晉平公), saying: **«Now we can fortify the city of Huqiu (壶丘).**»
The duke asked: **«Why so?**»
He replied: **«The younger brother of the King of Jing is in Qin, but Qin refuses to release him. This shows that Qin despises the King of Jing, and they will certainly not dare to forbid us from fortifying Huqiu.
If they forbid us, we will say: ‘Release the younger brother of the King of Jing for us, and we will not fortify.’
If they comply and release him, we can gain **virtue/power** (德) from the King of Jing.
If they do not release him, it means they persist in their hostility, and they will certainly not dare to forbid us from fortifying Huqiu.**»
The duke said: **«Well spoken.**» He then fortified Huqiu and told the **Qin public** (秦公): **«Release the younger brother of the King of Jing for us, and we will not fortify.**»
Qin then released him, and the King of Jing was greatly pleased, offering a hundredfold return of the gold as a gift to **Jin**.

The ancients had short sight in seeing themselves, hence they used mirrors to observe their faces.
The wise have limited self-awareness, hence they use the **Dao/Way** to correct themselves.
Thus, mirrors bear no blame for failing to reveal flaws,
and the **Dao/Way** incurs no resentment for clarifying errors.
Eyes without mirrors cannot properly align the brows and beard,
nor can bodies without the **Dao/Way** discern confusion and deception.
Ximen Bao’s nature was hasty, so he wore a girdle of *wei* (韋) to temper himself.
Dong An Yu’s temperament was sluggish, so he wore a bowstring to quicken his resolve.
Hence, to use one’s surplus to complement one’s deficiency,
and to extend one’s strengths to overcome one’s weaknesses—
this is what is called a **wise ruler** (明主).

There are three principles of trust in the world:
One, that **virtue/power** (智) has limits in what it can accomplish alone;
Two, that strength has limits in what it can lift alone;
Three, that might has limits in what it can overcome alone.
Thus, even with Yao’s wisdom, without the aid of many,
great deeds cannot be established.
Even with Wu Ge’s mighty strength, without human assistance,
he cannot lift himself.
Even with Bi and Yu’s prowess, without law and technique,
they cannot attain longevity.
Hence, there are things in the world that cannot be obtained,
and undertakings that cannot be completed.
Wu Ge could lift a thousand *jun* (钧) but struggled with his own body,
not because his body was heavier than a thousand *jun*,
but because the circumstances were unfavorable.
Li Zhu could discern objects a hundred *bu* (步) away but struggled to see his own brows and lashes,
not because a hundred *bu* was distant and lashes nearby,
but because the **Dao/Way** made it so.
Hence, a **wise ruler** does not exhaust Wu Ge for his inability to lift himself alone,
nor does he constrain Li Zhu for his inability to see himself clearly.
By leveraging favorable circumstances and seeking what the **Dao/Way** permits,
his efforts are few yet his achievements great.

Circumstances have their fullness and emptiness,
undertakings their advantages and disadvantages,
things their births and deaths.
If a ruler displays joy or anger for these three,
then even the most steadfast subjects will turn their hearts away.
The **virtue/power** (智) of the worthy and the sage is profound in discerning shallow and deep.
Hence, a **wise ruler** examines others,
but does not allow others to examine him.
When the **virtue/power** (智) of Yao is understood—
that he could not achieve greatness alone—
and the limitations of Wu Ge’s strength,
and the constraints of Bi and Yu’s might,
then the **Dao/Way** of safeguarding through law and technique is complete.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: On Stability and Peril**
Stability has seven methods; peril has six.
**Methods of Stability:**
1. Rewards and punishments follow what is right and wrong;
2. Calamity and blessing follow what is good and evil;
3. Life and death follow the laws and measures;
4. There are virtuous and unvirtuous people, yet no favoritism or hatred;
5. There are foolish and wise people, yet no unjust praise or blame;
6. There are small and large matters, yet no arbitrary judgment;
7. There is trust, yet no deceit.

**Paths to Peril:**
1. To carve and cut within the confines of the measuring line;
2. To carve and cut beyond the reach of the law;
3. To benefit others at their expense;
4. To delight others in their misfortune;
5. To endanger others in their security;
6. To love those not close, and to reject those not distant.

If this is done, then people will lose their reason for cherishing life,
and forget their grounds for fearing death.
If people do not cherish life, the ruler will not be revered;
if they do not fear death, his commands will not be obeyed.
Thus, he who makes the world’s cleverest conform to propriety,
and exhausts their strength in balancing scales—
when active, they prevail; when still, they are secure.
In governing the world, he makes people cherish life for doing what is right,
and love their bodies for avoiding what is wrong.
When petty men are few and gentlemen are many,
then the ancestral altars endure and the state remains long in peace.

Even on a fleeing chariot, there is no Zhong Ni (仲尼);
even in a capsized boat, there is no Bo Yi (伯夷).
Hence, proclamations are the state’s chariots and boats.
Stability brings forth **virtue/power** (智) and integrity,
while peril sparks contention and vulgarity.
Thus, the laws of a stable state
are like food for the hungry and clothing for the cold—
they require no coercion yet naturally take hold.
The ancient kings entrusted governance to written records,
and their **Dao/Way** was harmonious,
so later generations followed them.
If one were to remove hunger and cold,
even Bi and Yu could not enforce it.
To abandon what is natural,
even if one follows the **Dao/Way**, it would not stand.
What the strong and courageous cannot achieve,
the ruler above cannot secure.
If the ruler above does not exhaust himself in self-criticism,
and if his measures are without flaw,
then he will not slight the law.
The law is the foundation of the state—
if he treats it lightly, then achievements will not be realized,
and reputation will not be earned.

In ancient times, the physician Bian Que treated his patients by piercing their bones with a knife.
The sage, in saving a perilous state,
uses loyalty to pierce the ears of those in opposition.

Piercing the bone, so though the pain is slight upon the body, the enduring benefit lies within the self.
Rubbing the ears, so though the opposition is slight in the heart, the lasting blessing rests upon the state.
Thus, the gravely ill benefit from enduring pain,
and the resolute ruler gains fortune by rubbing the ears.

Enduring pain, so Bian Que’s skill is fully realized.
Rubbing the ears, so Zilu does not falter.
This is the art of longevity and security.

If one cannot endure pain when sick, then Bian Que’s skill is lost.
If one does not rub the ears in peril, then the Sage’s intent is abandoned.
Thus, lasting benefit will not soon descend,
and merit and fame will not soon be established.

The sovereign does not demand of himself the virtue of Yao,
yet expects of his ministers the loyalty of Zilu—
this is to hope that all will be like Bì Gān,
and if all are like Bì Gān, then the ruler will not lose his position,
and the people will not perish.

Without measuring one’s strength yet seeking the success of Tiān Chéng,
and hoping that all will be like Bì Gān,
then the state cannot achieve even a single moment of peace.
To abandon Yao and Shun and enthrone Jié and Jiè
is to let people fear their weaknesses while rejoicing in their strengths.
Losing what one excels at means the state achieves no merit,
and clinging to what one lacks means the people take no joy in life.
To govern with no merit while ruling over those who take no joy in life
is impossible among the common people.

Thus, the ruler cannot command the subjects,
and the subjects cannot serve the ruler.
Safety and peril lie in right and wrong, not in strength and weakness.
Survival and ruin lie in substance and emptiness, not in numbers and fewness.

Thus, though Qi was a great state with ten thousand chariots,
its reputation and reality did not match—
the ruler was hollow within his own domain,
not filling the space between reputation and reality,
so the ministers could usurp the sovereign.

Killing the Son of Heaven without distinguishing right and wrong,
rewarding those without merit,
favoring flatterers and deceivers,
punishing the innocent,
and forcing those of natural integrity to twist their backs—
to value deceit over sincerity,
and to condemn natural virtue—
the small prevails over the great.

The enlightened ruler strengthens his resolve within,
so he does not falter externally.
If one does not lose what is near to right,
then ruin from what is distant will not come.
Thus, when Zhou overthrew Shang,
they gathered the remnants in the courtyard,
ensuring Shang left nothing behind in the court,
so Zhou did not dare covet even a single autumn hair at the border—
how much less would they dare to usurp the throne?

The enlightened ruler’s **Dao/Way** is loyalty to law,
and his law is loyal to the heart,
so when he governs, he relies on law,
and when he departs, he reflects upon it.

Yao required no bonds of glue and lacquer in his age,
yet his **Dao/Way** prevailed.
Shun needed no place to insert a needle in future generations,
yet his virtue endured.

To establish the **Dao/Way** in the distant past
and transmit virtue to ten thousand generations—
this is called the enlightened ruler.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Guarding the Dao**

The sage-kings’ laws were such that their rewards were sufficient to encourage the virtuous,
their authority was sufficient to overcome violence,
and their precautions were sufficient to ensure the laws were complete.

In times of governance, officials of merit held high rank,
those who exerted themselves received rich rewards,
and those who gave their all had their names recorded.
The growth of virtue was like spring,
and the decline of vice was like autumn,
so the people strove to exert themselves to the utmost
and took joy in giving their all—
this is called the ruler and subjects harmonizing.

When ruler and subjects harmonize,
those who use their strength strive to the limits of measure and balance,
and their efforts reach the utmost in their stations.
Soldiers risk death in battle,
yet wish to be like Bì and Yǔ.
Those who guard the **Dao/Way** all harbor hearts of jade and stone,
and die with the resolve of Zilu.

If those who exert themselves act with the utmost in their stations,
fight like Bì and Yǔ,
and guard with the resolve of jade and stone,
then the ruler can rest securely while his realm remains intact.

The ancients who excelled in defense
used what was precious to prohibit what was trivial,
and what was difficult to stop what was easy.
Thus, the noble and the petty both stood upright,
and the thief Zhí and the historians Zēng and Shǐ were all honest.

How do we know this?
The greedy thief does not venture into the river to pick up gold,
for if he did, his life would not be preserved.
Bì and Yǔ, if they did not measure their enemies,
would not earn their reputation for courage.
Zhí, if he did not calculate what was possible,
would not achieve his gains.

The enlightened ruler’s prohibitions
ensure that Bì and Yǔ do not suffer defeat in what they cannot overcome,
and that Zhí does not meet harm in what he cannot take.
Thus, if one can prohibit what Bì and Yǔ cannot violate,
and guard what Zhí cannot seize,
then the violent will restrain themselves,
and the wicked will return to righteousness.
The great warrior will be sincere,
and the mighty thief will be upright.
When this is achieved, the world will be just and fair,
and the common people’s hearts will be upright.

If the ruler abandons the law and loses the people,
he will be in greater peril than Bò Yí’s refusal to take what was not his,
yet he will not escape the fate of Tiān Chéng and Zhí’s treachery.

Today, there is no Bò Yí in the world,
yet deceitful men do not cease to exist,
so laws and measures are established.
If measures are trustworthy, then Bò Yí will not lose what is right,
and Zhí will not dare to act wrongly.
If laws are clearly defined, then the worthy cannot usurp the unworthy,
the strong cannot oppress the weak,
and the many cannot tyrannize the few.

To entrust the world to Yao’s laws,
then the upright will not lose their place,
and the deceitful will not seek fortune through trickery.
To deposit a thousand gold pieces with Yì’s arrows,
then Bò Yí will not perish,
and Zhí will not dare to take them.
Yao was enlightened in preventing deceit,
so the world had no wickedness.
Yì was skilled in never missing his mark,
so the thousand gold pieces were not lost.
The wicked did not live long,
and Zhí’s schemes came to nothing.
Thus, the records do not mention Zǎi Yú,
nor do they mention the Six Ministers.
The annals do not record Zilu,
nor do they praise Fú Chā.
The strategies of Sūn and Wú were abandoned,
and Zhí’s treachery was suppressed.

The ruler enjoys comfort within the jade hall,
yet faces no danger of glaring eyes and gnashing teeth in greedy seizure.
The minister rests with folded arms within the fortified city,
yet faces no calamity of clutching and snatching with pursed lips.

To tame tigers without cages,
to restrain deceit without laws,
to block falsehood without seals—
this is the concern of Bì and Yǔ,
and the difficulty of Yao and Shun.

Thus, cages are not set to guard against mice,
but to enable the timid to tame tigers.
Laws are not established to guard against Zēng and Shǐ,
but to enable mediocre rulers to stop Zhí.
Seals are not prepared for Tàishēng,
but to prevent common people from deceiving one another.

It is not only to wait for Bì Gān’s death in loyalty,
nor to rely on treacherous ministers being without deceit—
but to hold what the timid can tame,
and grasp what the mediocre ruler can guard.

「In the present age, for a sovereign to devise loyal strategies and for the world to bind together with virtue, no benefit is greater than this. Thus, a ruler has no schemes of losing his state, and loyal ministers have no plots of losing their lives. When he knows that honor must be bestowed upon those who hold high positions, men will exert their utmost at the scales of governance, and die in loyalty for their duties.

Understanding the plight of Bì and Yǔ, he does not exchange life for death, and recognizing the greed of Zhí and Shǐ, he does not trade his own person for wealth. Then, the Dao of guarding the state is fully realized.

**Chapter 27: The Use of People**
The wise of antiquity in employing people would surely follow the Way, conform to human nature, and clearly distinguish rewards and punishments. Following the Way means expending little effort yet achieving great results; conforming to human nature means minimizing penalties yet ensuring orders are obeyed; and clearly distinguishing rewards and punishments means that Bì Yǐ and Zhí Shǐ will not cause chaos. Thus, the separation between right and wrong is manifest.

The ministers of state will strive to serve the country and uphold their positions, demonstrate their capabilities in their offices, and exert their utmost at the scales of governance to fulfill their duties. Subjects will all be suited to their abilities, surpass their official ranks, and lighten their burdens, yet harbor no lingering strength of resistance nor bear the guilt of holding multiple offices before their sovereign.

Thus, there will be no internal rebellions born of hidden resentments, nor external calamities like the disaster at Mǎfú. A wise ruler ensures that duties do not overlap, so there will be no litigation. He assigns officials without granting them multiple roles, so their skills will flourish. He does not make people share in different functions, so there will be no disputes. When disputes cease and skills excel, the strong will not overpower the weak, nor will opposites clash in form. Then, none in the world can harm one another, and governance reaches its peak.

To abandon the *fǎshù* and rely solely on the heart’s governance, even Yáo could not rectify a single state. To discard the *guījǔ* and measure with arbitrary intent, Xī Zhōng could not craft a single wheel. To neglect the *chǐcùn* and allow discrepancies in length, even Wáng Ěr could not half-hit the mark. If a mediocre ruler adheres to the *fǎshù*, and clumsy artisans follow the *guījǔ* and *chǐcùn*, then nothing will be lost in ten thousand cases.

A sovereign who can abandon what even the virtuous and skilled cannot achieve, yet uphold what the mediocre and clumsy can never fail in, will exhaust the people’s efforts and establish his fame. A wise ruler establishes rewards for what can be done and punishments for what can be avoided. Thus, the virtuous will encourage rewards without fearing the fate of Zhū Xū, and the unworthy will commit fewer crimes without facing the punishment of being flayed and their backs sliced. The blind will walk on level ground without falling into deep ravines, and the foolish will guard stillness without being trapped in perilous dangers. Thus, the bonds of favor between ruler and subjects will be firmly established.

The ancients said: *"His heart is difficult to fathom, and his joys and anger are hard to discern."* Thus, they use visible signs to guide the eyes, drumbeats to instruct the ears, and laws to teach the heart. If a sovereign abandons these three clear methods and instead acts upon an unfathomable heart, then anger will accumulate above, and resentment will gather below. To govern with accumulated anger against accumulated resentment is to invite twofold peril.

The wise ruler’s signs are easily seen, so his decrees are firmly established. His teachings are easily understood, so his words are put to use. His laws are easily followed, so his commands are obeyed. When these three are in place and the ruler has no private intentions, then the subjects can follow the laws to govern themselves, act in response to the signs, cut according to the measure, and sew by the marked threads. Thus, the ruler will suffer no harm from private threats, and the subjects will face no punishment for their ignorance or clumsiness.

Hence, the upper echelons will be enlightened with little anger, and the lower ranks will be loyal with few crimes. It has been said: *"Actions without calamity are beyond even Yáo."* Yet the world has never been without affairs. A sovereign who does not lightly bestow rank and wealth, nor easily alter fortune, cannot be relied upon to rescue a perilous state. Thus, a wise ruler enforces integrity and virtue, and attracts the righteous.

In the past, Jiè Zǐtú had no rank or wealth, yet his virtue followed Wén Gōng. He endured neither hunger nor thirst, yet his benevolence extended to cutting his own flesh to feed others. Thus, the sovereign bound his virtue, and his name was inscribed upon the ancestral tablets. The sovereign delights in making people exert their efforts for the public good, yet suffers when private interests usurp authority.

Subjects find comfort in receiving office according to their abilities, yet grieve when one person bears two roles. This is to burden one body with two duties. Thus, a wise ruler removes the subjects’ sufferings and establishes what the sovereign finds joyous, and the mutual benefits between ruler and subjects are never greater than this.

If a ruler does not examine the faults within his own household, lightly punishes grave offenses, severely punishes minor crimes, harbors long-standing resentments over trivial mistakes, indulges in prolonged scorn for fleeting pleasures, or habitually disdains others for petty gratification—if he rewards crimes with virtue, punishing those who bring misfortune yet instead repaying them with virtue—this is like severing a hand and replacing it with jade. Thus, the world sees the calamity of losing one’s life.

If a sovereign establishes difficult tasks yet does not punish those who fail, private resentments will rise. If a subject is deprived of his strengths yet burdened with impossible tasks, hidden resentments will take root. If labor and suffering are not soothed nor sorrow and grief are not pitied, then in joy he will praise the unworthy, and both the virtuous and unworthy will be rewarded. In anger, he will slander the noble, and Bì Yǐ and Zhí Shǐ will be dishonored together. Thus, ministers will rebel against their sovereign.

If the King of Yān harbors internal hatred for his own people while outwardly showing favor to the people of Lǔ, then Yān will be neglected while Lǔ will not embrace its subjects. Those who see hatred will not exert their efforts nor strive for merit, and those who see favor will not risk their lives nor abandon their own sovereign to serve another. Thus, ministers become like cracks in a wall, and the sovereign stands alone. To serve a sovereign with ministers like cracks in a wall is to court grave danger.

To abandon proper ritual and act arbitrarily, though one may hit the mark, the result will be clumsy. To discard laws and decrees yet rage in anger, though one may execute criminals, the wicked will not be deterred. Crime will be attributed to one party, while calamity falls upon another, and hidden resentments will form.

Thus, in a state of utmost governance, there are rewards and punishments yet no private joys or angers, so the Sage is at his peak. There are penalties and laws, yet none die from their sting, so the wicked submit. When arrows strike their mark and rewards and punishments align with justice, then Yáo would rise again and Yì would stand once more.

Thus, the ruler above will face no calamities like those of Yīn or Xià, and the subjects below will suffer no fates like that of Bì Gān. The ruler will rest with a high pillow, and the ministers will take joy in their duties. The Dao will cover the heavens and earth, and virtue will reach to the ten thousand generations.

If a sovereign does not block the cracks in his own household, yet toils over the muddy walls of his state, violent rains and fierce winds will surely destroy them. If he does not remove the perils close at hand, yet admires the loyalty of Bì and Yǔ, if he does not guard against the dangers within his own walls, yet fortifies his distant borders with gold—then his state will be in peril.»

「Do not employ the counsel of nearby worthies while instead forming alliances with the great powers of distant lands. When sudden tempests arise, Bì and Yǔ would be too late to offer aid, and distant alliances would fail to arrive in time—no calamity could be greater than this.

In the present age, those who sincerely advise the sovereign must avoid making the King of Yān delight in the people of Lǔ, must not emulate ancient worthies in modern times, and must not expect the people of Yuè to rescue the Central States from drowning. Only then will the ruler and subjects grow close, internal governance take root, and external reputation flourish.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Four Foundations of a Sage Ruler’s Achievements and Reputation**
The sage ruler establishes achievements and secures reputation through four means: first, the alignment with *heavenly timing* (天时); second, the harmony with *human sentiment* (人心); third, the mastery of *skills and abilities* (技能); and fourth, the wielding of *authority and position* (势位). Without heavenly timing, even ten Yáo could not coax a single grain to grow in winter. To act against human sentiment, even Bì and Yǔ could not compel all to exert themselves.

Thus, when one attains heavenly timing, endeavors flourish spontaneously; when one secures human sentiment, encouragement arises without prompting; when one leverages skill and ability, urgency emerges without haste; and when one commands authority and position, reputation is achieved without exertion. Like water flowing or a boat floating, the sage ruler adheres to the Way of Nature and issues commands that never fail. Hence, he is called the *Enlightened Sovereign*.

One may possess talent yet lack authority—even the worthy cannot then restrain the unworthy. Place a ruler’s staff atop a high mountain, and it overlooks a thousand *ren*-deep ravine; the staff is not long, but its position is elevated. Jié, as the Son of Heaven, could command all under Heaven—not because he was virtuous, but because his authority was supreme. Yáo, as a commoner, could not rectify even three households—not because he was unworthy, but because his station was low. A thousand *jūn* of weight will float with a boat, while a single *zhū* will sink without it—not because the former is lighter or the latter heavier, but because of the presence or absence of supporting force. Thus, the short staff dominates the heights through position, and the unworthy subdue the worthy through authority.

The sovereign bears the collective strength of all under Heaven, hence his security. When all hearts unite in supporting him, his eminence is assured. Ministers fulfill their strengths and exhaust their abilities, hence their loyalty. When the sovereign, through his eminence, governs loyal ministers, enduring joy arises, and achievements and reputation are realized. For reputation and substance depend on each other, and form and shadow arise together—thus, the sovereign and minister share the same desires yet differ in their roles.

The sovereign’s affliction lies in having no response, hence the saying: *A single hand clapping, though swift, makes no sound.* The minister’s woe lies in lacking unity, hence the saying: *The right hand draws a circle, the left a square—neither can succeed.* Therefore, in a perfectly governed state, the ruler is like a drumstick, the minister like a drum, the craftsman like a chariot, and affairs like the horses—thus, when men have surplus strength, they readily respond, and when craftsmen possess surplus skill, they readily accomplish tasks.

Those who achieve great deeds lack not in strength, those who draw near lack not in trust, and those who secure reputation lack not in authority. If the near are already close yet the distant remain unaligned, then reputation fails to match reality. Even if a sage’s virtue equals that of Yáo and Shùn, and his conduct matches that of Bó Yí, yet if his station does not elevate him in the world, his achievements will not stand, and his reputation will not endure. Thus, the ancients who accomplished great deeds relied on the masses lending their strength, the near aiding in completion, the distant praising in renown, and the eminent supporting through authority. Only then could the enduring achievements of Tàishān stand firm in the state, and the radiant reputation of Rì and Yuè persist in Heaven and Earth. This is how Yáo secured his reputation by ruling from the south, and Shùn fulfilled his achievements by deferring to Yáo from the north.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Grand Framework of the Ancients**
The ancients who preserved the grand framework observed the heavens and earth, contemplated rivers and seas, followed the contours of mountains and valleys, and aligned with the reach of sun and moon, the passage of the four seasons, and the movement of clouds and winds. They did not burden the mind with excessive scheming nor the self with private bias. They entrusted governance to law and method, entrusted right and wrong to rewards and punishments, and entrusted weight and measure to scales and balances. They did not defy natural principle, nor harm human nature. They did not scrutinize minutiae like seeking flaws in a hair’s breadth, nor probe deeply like washing away filth to uncover hidden faults. They did not extend the measure beyond its line nor contract it within—nor did they hasten beyond the law nor delay within it. They upheld established principles, followed natural order, and let fortune and misfortune arise from the Dao and its methods, rather than from personal inclinations. Honor and disgrace rested with the self, not others.

Thus, they brought about the age of utmost tranquility, where laws were as fleeting as morning dew, simplicity remained unbroken, hearts harbored no grievances, and tongues uttered no idle words. Hence, chariots and horses did not weary on distant roads, banners did not falter in great marshes, the common folk did not perish in raids, the mighty did not shorten their lives in battle, the bold did not seek fame in records, nor were deeds inscribed on bronze tripods or annual annals left empty. Therefore, it is said: *No benefit surpasses simplicity, no blessing endures like peace.*

If a master carpenter with a thousand years’ lifespan wielded a hook, measured with a compass and plumb, and sought to rectify Tàishān, or if Bì and Yǔ donned the *Gān Jiāng* sword to unify the people, though they exerted their utmost skill and reached the height of their lifespans, Tàishān would not be straightened, nor the people unified. Thus, the ancient rulers of all under Heaven did not command the master carpenter to exhaust his skill in defacing Tàishān’s form, nor did they order Bì and Yǔ to wield their might in harming the people’s nature. They followed the Dao and preserved the law, allowing the virtuous to take joy while great deceivers were checked. Tranquil and at ease, they aligned with Heaven’s command and upheld the grand framework. Thus, they ensured no one transgressed the law, and no fish faced ruin from water.

Therefore, all under Heaven lacked nothing. If the ruler does not ascend to Heaven, the people below will not be fully sheltered; if the heart does not rest like earth, all things will not be securely borne. Tàishān does not favor or reject—thus it attains its height. The rivers and seas do not discriminate against small contributions—thus they attain their fullness. Hence, the great person embodies the heavens and earth, and all things are complete; their mind traverses mountains and seas, and the state grows rich. Above, there is no venom of wrath, below, no hidden resentment—above and below return to simplicity, taking the Dao as their dwelling. Thus, enduring benefits accumulate, great achievements are established, reputation is secured in the present, and virtue endures in the future—this is the pinnacle of governance.»

#5 *"千将"* is clearly a mistake for *"干将"* and should be corrected.

**Chapter Nine of *Hanfeizi*: *Nèicǔ Shuō* (Inner Reservoir Discourses) – *Qī Shù* (Seven Arts) #30**
*Cǔ* means "to gather." This gathers all the strategies that are the sovereign’s inner schemes, hence the title *Nèicǔ Shuō*.

The sovereign employs seven arts and discerns six subtleties.

The seven arts are:
1. **Crowdsourced Verification (Zhòng Duān Cān Guān)** – *Duān* means "straightforward." To seek truth from the masses, one must cross-verify and observe.
2. **Unwavering Punishment to Manifest Authority (Bì Fá Míng Wēi)**,
3. **Faithful Rewards to Exhaust Capability (Xìn Shuǎng Jìn Néng)**,
4. **Unified Hearing and Delegated Accountability (Yī Tīng Zé Xià)** – If the sovereign listens to only one perspective, there will inevitably be errors. If accountability is not uniformly enforced, merit will remain obscured.
5. **Ambiguous Edicts and Deceptive Commands (Yí Zhào Guǐ Shǐ)** – By issuing ambiguous orders and employing deceptive tactics, the subjects dare not conceal their true intentions.
6. **Feigning Ignorance to Probe (Jié Zhī Ér Wèn)**,
7. **Reversing Statements and Inverting Facts (Dào Yán Fǎn Shì)** – Either reversing their words or inverting their deeds will expose all deceit.

These seven are the sovereign’s tools.

If observation and hearing are not cross-verified, truth will not be heard. Not cross-verifying means listening to only one person, and thus the truthful will have no way to speak. If listening is filtered through factions, ministers will obstruct the sovereign’s judgment. If the sovereign’s hearing is as narrow as a factional gate, it will be blocked by his ministers.

The tale of the dwarf’s dream of a stove illustrates this: the dwarf dreamed of a stove, claiming it had a man standing guard, yet no one else saw it. This mocks Duke Ling’s partiality toward Zǐ Xué.

Duke Zhāo’s reliance on a single advisor led to his confusion. When the duke consulted on matters, he did so without gathering diverse opinions, hence his confusion. Confucius, when addressing the entire state, aligned with the faction of Sūn Shū, effectively making the state a single man’s domain—thus the duke’s confusion was justified.

The people of Qi, deceived by a single advisor, believed the River Spirit was a giant fish. This mirrors Huìzi’s warning that a sovereign’s schemes, when not cross-verified, lose half their value—when all advisors echo the same opinion without question, they become a clique, hence the loss of half the truth.

These five cases all stem from the sovereign’s failure to cross-verify and avoid factional listening.

The danger lies in Chú Sūn’s starvation due to trusting a single advisor: Chú Sūn relied solely on the dwarf Gàn Niú, leading to his own starvation and the execution of his two sons. This parallels Jiāng Yǐ’s critique of Chu’s customs, where the taboo against speaking of others’ kindness allowed Bái Gōng to incite rebellion.

Duke Sì’s ignorance of governance—meaning he lacked the knowledge of ruling—led to his downfall. He feared his favored ministers would conspire against him, so he elevated others to counter them. But this only strengthened their factions, making his original favorites even more entrenched.

Thus, the enlightened sovereign accumulates iron-like defenses—building a fortress of iron to guard against all possible losses, ensuring no harm to his body. He accumulates doubt as his mind, exhausting all possibilities to guard against deceitful ministers, ensuring no treachery arises.

Yet even a single market’s claim—*"There is a tiger in the market!"*—should not be believed #1, let alone three people’s word. **Cross-verification is paramount.**

If a sovereign favors too many, the law cannot stand. If authority is weak, the subjects will encroach upon their superiors.

Thus, when punishments are not strictly enforced, prohibitions cannot be upheld. This is illustrated by **Bozi’s governance in Shiyì**: when Bozi arrived in Shiyì, he established laws like deep ravines, and so the state of Zhao became well-ordered.

It is also seen in **Zi Chan’s instruction of You Ji**: Zi Chan taught You Ji to enforce laws rigorously through the **Law Historians**, ensuring strict judgments.

Hence, **Confucius praised the killing frost**: when Confucius spoke to Duke Ai about the killing frost not harming the grass, he meant that it was fitting to kill—yet it did not—because it was not the proper time.

Yet the **Yin dynasty’s law punished those who fled from burning ashes**, and when **Jiang Ziya** was about to depart, he did so because the king did not entrust him with the sole authority over rewards and punishments.

**Gongsun Yang** also emphasized minor offenses: he believed that if minor crimes were not punished, there would be no way to deter major ones, so he first punished the minor offenses. Hence, even though the gold of **Lishui was unguarded**, and stealing it was punishable by dismemberment, people still continued to steal it—until some were caught and executed, at which point even major crimes ceased.

Similarly, the **fire at Jizai went unchecked**: when the fire at Jizai burned and no one intervened, it was because the laws were not enforced.

**Cheng Huan** knew that excessive benevolence weakens a state: he recognized that the king’s excessive kindness would inevitably weaken the state of Qi.

**Bu Pi** foresaw that mercy would lead to the downfall of the **Wei king**: he knew that the king’s compassion would ultimately destroy himself.

**Guan Zhong understood this**, so he executed the dead.

Knowing the necessity of governance, he strictly prohibited extravagant burials—those who disobeyed had their corpses mutilated.

**Sìgōng understood this too**, so he bought back the **xūmǐ (corvée laborers)**. Sìgōng knew that a state must punish, so when a *xūmǐ* fled, he bought back an entire district to execute him.

**Punishment must be certain**—if rewards are meager, deceitful subjects will be disregarded; if rewards are substantial, honest subjects will risk death for them.

This is illustrated in **Wenzi’s analogy of beasts and deer**: beasts and deer seek only the finest grass, just as subjects gravitate toward those who offer the greatest rewards.

Thus, **King Goujian burned his palace**: he burned his own residence to test whether people would obey orders to save the fire, verifying their loyalty.

**Wu Qi leaned on his chariot’s axle**: he rewarded those who moved the axle to demonstrate his sincerity and trustworthiness.

**Li Kui settled disputes through archery**: he wanted people to excel in archery, so he judged cases as if they were archery contests.

**Song Chong’s gate policy led to many deaths**: when mourners in Chong’s gate starved themselves, the ruler granted them official positions, leading to many deaths by self-neglect.

**Goujian understood this**, so he **displayed the severed head of a tiger (nì)** to inspire bravery.

**Zhao Zhao understood this**, so he hid his worn trousers: he offered great rewards to encourage people to act like **Bì and Zhū**—even women would gather silkworms and fishermen would catch fish without fear, for the reward outweighed the difficulty.

This is the effect of **obtaining profit while forgetting hardship**.

**Rewards must be substantial.**

「When a ruler listens to only one voice, wisdom and folly are indistinguishable. If he adheres to a single principle without reconsidering and verifying it, wisdom and folly will not be discerned.

**Holding subordinates accountable prevents ministers from conspiring.** If every ability and shortcoming of his subjects is singled out for blame, then ministers will not dare to mix truth with deceit.

**This is illustrated by the case of the Duke of Zhao seeking to annex the state of Zheng.** The Duke of Zhao demanded Zheng’s territory, claiming it as his own, but did not consider that Zheng itself had once taken land from the state of Liang. Meanwhile, the people of Zheng also demanded Liang’s territory, claiming it as their own. This was the flaw of **listening to only one voice**.

**Like the story of the South Gate Archers.** When the South Gate Archers played together, no one was held responsible for their individual skill, so they could all blend in without distinction. The harm in this lies in **Shen Zi’s use of Zhao Shao and Han Que as test subjects.** Shen Zi, when requesting soldiers for Zhao, first had Zhao Shao and Han Que test the Zhao ruler’s resolve, then revealed their true intentions and ultimately succeeded in their private schemes.

**Thus, the Marquis of Wu proposed dividing the land east of the Yellow River**, but the King of Han wanted to take it to provoke the three rival states—this was not a sound plan. The Marquis of Wu urged the king to proceed with the order, while **Ying Hou plotted to relax control over Shangdang.** Ying Hou’s scheme to weaken Shangdang was also not a sound plan, yet the King of Qin followed it. These three cases are all examples of the harm of **listening to only one voice**.

**When favors are repeatedly granted but not acted upon, deceit will flourish.** If a ruler frequently shows his favor to certain individuals but does not actually employ them, outsiders will assume he approves of their actions, and they will eventually dare to act deceitfully, like deer straying from the herd.

**This leads to questioning others without revealing one’s own schemes.** If a ruler appears to inquire about others while secretly knowing their intentions, then even those who are not clever will seem to possess wisdom. If his understanding of a single matter is profound, all hidden deceits will be exposed.

**This is illustrated by the Duke of Zhao’s grasp of a single claw.** The Duke of Zhao feigned losing a claw to test the sincerity of his ministers. Thus, he uncovered the truth behind the **Southern Gate’s ox trampling the crops**, and all the offenders from the three districts were revealed.

**The Duke of Zhou searched for the crooked staff**, and the Duke of Zhou deliberately lost his jade hairpin to seek praise for his divine insight. **The Grand Steward of Shang debated cow dung**, using absurd reasoning to gain a reputation for thorough investigation. The ruler who **tests with favors** will find those who profit from them.

**Using one’s own wisdom to question others brings the unwise forward.** If a ruler employs his own intelligence to probe others, even those who lack wisdom will appear to be wise.

**If his understanding of a single matter is deep**, all hidden deceits will be transformed and exposed. This is seen in the Duke of Zhao’s **grasp of a single claw**.

**Using reversed speech to test suspected deceit reveals hidden schemes.** If a ruler deliberately distorts his words and reverses his actions to test those he suspects, he will uncover their deceit. Thus, **Yang Shan’s guard of the wooden stake** exposed the truth by feigning neglect of the stake, revealing the king’s suspicions. **Dai Que’s false mission for Qin** deceived the Qin ruler to test his hatred. The people of Qi, intending to cause disorder, feigned driving away those they loved to see if the ruler would remain unaware. **Zi Zi’s white horse ploy** involved falsely claiming a white horse to verify the sincerity of his ministers. **Zi Chan’s separation of litigants** divided the disputants to easily obtain the true emotions of both parties. **Duke Ji of Qi’s passing through the market crossroads** knew that those who paid gold to pass would reveal his reputation for listening and investigating. **Reversed speech seven.**

**The Right Classic states:** One.»

During the reign of Duke Ling of Wei, **Mi Zi Xia** was favored and held absolute sway over the state. A dwarf who had an audience with the duke said:

*"Your servant’s dreams have become humble."*

The duke asked, *"What did you dream?"*

The dwarf replied, *"I dreamed of a hearth—this was to see Your Majesty."*

The duke grew angry and said, *"I have heard that those who meet with a sovereign dream of the sun. Why, when seeing me, do you dream of lightning?"*

The dwarf answered, *"The sun illuminates the entire world, and no single thing can block it. This means no one can obscure the sovereign’s radiance. Therefore, those who meet with a sovereign dream of the sun.

But a hearth—when one person stands before it, none behind can see. If one person obscures the light of favor, then none behind can see it. *Flame* means *burn*—today, is there not someone who burns before the sovereign? This is a censure of Mi Zi Xia for monopolizing and obscuring the sovereign’s clarity. Then, even if your servant dreams of a hearth, is it not justified?"*

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, *"The vulgar saying goes: ‘Do not consult the many, or you will be misled.’ If one acts without consulting the many, one will surely be confused. Now, when I deliberate with my ministers, my state grows only more disordered. Why is this?"*

Confucius replied, *"When an enlightened ruler consults his ministers, one knows and one does not. When one knows and another does not, this allows for repeated scrutiny and censure. Thus, with the enlightened ruler above and ministers offering honest counsel below, this is the way.

But today, no minister dares to speak against the *Ji* family’s path. The entire state has been transformed into one mind, and the state already unified—then you may judge right and wrong. Even if you consult all within the borders, you will still not escape disorder. The people within the borders also align with the *Ji* family, so consulting them is useless."*

**Reversed speech, one.**

When **Yan Zi** was on a diplomatic mission to Lu, Duke Ai asked, *"The saying goes: ‘Do not consult three, or you will be misled.’ If one acts without consulting three, one will surely be confused. Yet when I deliberate with the entire state, Lu does not fall into disorder. Why is this?"*

Yan Zi said, *"The ancient saying ‘Do not consult three, or you will be misled’ meant that if one person errs and two correct, three are sufficient to represent the many. Hence, ‘Do not consult three, or you will be misled.’

But today, the ministers of Lu number in the thousands and hundreds. Though they speak in unison for the *Ji* family’s private interests, the many who speak are still but one voice. How can there be three?"*

There was a man of Qi who said to the King of Qi, *"The River Spirit is a great deity. Why does Your Majesty not attempt to meet with it? I beg leave to arrange for Your Majesty to encounter it."*

Thus, he constructed a grand altar upon the river and had the king stand there with him. After a while, a large fish stirred, and he declared, *"This is the River Spirit!"*—truly believing the words of one man, hence this folly.

Zhang Yi wished to use the combined strength of Qin and Han to attack Qi and Jing, while Hui Shi sought to lay down arms. If Qi and Jing were to serve as allies, Qin and Han would not dare to strike, and thus the war could be averted. The two men argued, and all the ministers and attendants sided with Zhang Zi, declaring the attack on Qi and Jing advantageous, while none supported Hui Zi’s words. The king indeed heeded Zhang Zi’s advice, dismissing Hui Zi’s counsel as unfeasible. The matter of attacking Qi and Jing was settled, and when Hui Zi entered to see him, the king said, *"Master, do not speak further."* The attack on Qi and Jing was indeed beneficial, and all the state agreed. Hui Zi then remarked, *"This must be examined carefully."* If the attack on Qi and Jing were truly beneficial, and all the state deemed it so, what a multitude of wise men! If the attack on Qi and Jing were truly disadvantageous, yet all the state deemed it beneficial, what a multitude of fools! In all deliberation, there must be doubt. Doubt arises only after careful consideration. When there is genuine doubt, half may deem it favorable, half unfavorable. If doubt is sincere, then half may find it favorable, half unfavorable. Now, if all the state deems it favorable, the king has lost half his judgment. Without those who raise doubt, half his wisdom is lost. Those who seize power naturally lose half their judgment. Without anyone to raise doubt, great thieves may scheme at will. Tian Cheng and Zhao Gao succeeded in their treasonous ambitions—because no one doubted them.

Zhong Sun served as Ru’s minister, wielding great authority and decisive power. Among those he favored was a man named Shù Niú, who also held sway over Zhong Sun’s commands. Zhong Sun had a son named Rén, and Shù Niú envied him, desiring to kill him. He arranged for Rén to play with Ru’s lord, who bestowed a jade armband upon him. Rén bowed in acceptance but dared not wear it, instead sending Shù Niú to request permission from Zhong Sun. Shù Niú deceived him, saying, *"I have already requested it for you; you may wear it."* Rén thus wore the armband, and when Zhong Sun saw him, he flew into a rage and killed Rén. Rén’s elder brother was named Bǐng, and Shù Niú again envied him, desiring to kill him. Zhong Sun commissioned a bell for Bǐng, and when it was finished, Bǐng dared not strike it, so he sent Shù Niú to request permission from Zhong Sun. Shù Niú refused to ask, instead deceiving him again, saying, *"I have already requested it for you; you may strike it."* Bǐng thus struck the bell. Zhong Sun heard this and said, *"Bǐng struck the bell without requesting permission—angry, I banish him."* Bǐng fled to Qi and lived there for a year. Shù Niú then sought to apologize to Zhong Sun, who sent Shù Niú to summon him. Shù Niú did not call him but reported, *"I have already summoned him, yet Bǐng, enraged, refuses to come."* Zhong Sun was furious and ordered his death. When the two sons had perished, Zhong Sun fell ill. Shù Niú then alone tended to him, excluding others, and forbade any woman from entering, saying, *"Zhong Sun does not wish to hear the voices of others."* He starved him to death, and when Zhong Sun was dead, Shù Niú did not announce the mourning, instead transferring his household treasures and fleeing to Qi. To heed only what one trusts, and see one’s sons and fathers slaughtered by others—this is the calamity of failing to weigh opposing views!

Jiāng Qǐ, as the king’s envoy to the state of Jing, said to the Jing king, *"When I entered Your Majesty’s realm, I heard of a custom in your state: ‘A gentleman does not conceal another’s virtues or speak of another’s faults.’ Is this truly so?"* The king replied, *"It is."* Then Jiāng Qǐ asked, *"If so, how could the rebellion of Bái Gōng have posed such danger?"* If one does not speak of another’s faults, Bái Gōng’s treachery would have succeeded, and thus the danger. If such were truly the case, then I would have died in vain. To conceal faults is to invite calamity—what crime is there greater? The heir apparent valued his concubine as his own ear, cherishing Shì Jī, yet fearing she might exploit his affection and obstruct his path. Thus, he elevated a lesser concubine to rival Shì Jī, saying, *"Let them balance each other."* The heir knew how to avoid obstruction but had not yet mastered the art.

To prevent the low from criticizing the high, the low must not be allowed to participate in discussions with the high. If the low commit crimes, they must be blamed for their involvement in deliberations with the high. Yet if one must wait until power is equalized before seeking opposing views, then when both are equally matched, it is precisely the time to engage in mutual discussion. This only strengthens the obstructionist ministers. If both factions conspire together, the obstruction becomes even more severe—this is the heir’s failure to master the art.

The heir’s obstruction began thus. Now, when arrows come, they have a direction—*xiāng*, meaning a fixed point. If arrows come from a particular direction, one should gather iron to defend that *xiāng*. That is, to concentrate iron in one place to defend a single point, is to leave gaps in one’s armor. If arrows come from all directions, then one should build an *iron chamber* to defend against them fully. That is, complete armor—from head to foot, all covered in iron—thus called an *iron chamber*. To defend fully means the body will not be harmed. Hence, if one defends fully against all directions, the body remains uninjured, and if one fully opposes treachery in all its forms, there will be no deceit.

The king should also fully oppose his ministers, all those he must guard against and suspect, and thus deceit will be cut off. Páng Gōng asked the prince of Tai, *"If one man says the market has a tiger, would Your Majesty believe him?"* The prince replied, *"I would not."* *"If two men say the market has a tiger, would Your Majesty believe them?"* *"I would not."* *"If three men say the market has a tiger, would Your Majesty believe them?"* The prince said, *"I would believe them."* Páng Gōng said, *"It is clear the market has no tiger, yet three men’s words make it so."*

Now the distance from Handan to Wei is farther than to the market, yet those discussing my ministers far exceed three men. I wish Your Majesty would investigate this.

Páng Góng returned from Handan but never gained audience again.

Dòng Gūzhī served as the governor of Zhào’s Upper Lands, traveling through the mountains near Shíyì. The ravine was deep, its cliffs sheer as walls, a hundred *zhang* in height. He asked the nearby villagers and attendants: *"Has anyone ever entered this place?"* They replied: *"None have."* *"Have even infants, the deaf, the mad, or the wayward ever entered?"* They replied: *"None have."* *"Have cattle, horses, dogs, or pigs ever entered?"* They replied: *"None have."* Dòng Gūzhī sighed deeply and said: *"Now I know how to govern! If my laws are without pardon, like entering this ravine means certain death, then no one would dare transgress. Why would disorder arise?"*

Zǐchǎn served as chancellor of Zhèng. As he lay dying, he told Yóují: *"After my death, you must govern Zhèng. You must rule with strictness."* Fire takes shape in severity, so few are burned. Water takes shape in weakness, so many drown. You must enforce your punishments with strictness and not let weakness drown your rule. Thus, after Zǐchǎn’s death, Yóují could not bear to enforce severe punishments, and the youths of Zhèng banded together to rob, taking refuge in the Guànzé marshes, threatening to become Zhèng’s ruin. Yóují led his chariots and cavalry to battle them for a day and night, barely overcoming them. Yóují sighed deeply and said: *"Had I followed my master’s teachings earlier, I would not now regret this."*

Duke Aí of Lǔ asked Zhòngní: *"The Spring and Autumn Annals record: ‘In the twelfth month of winter, the frost did not kill the beans.’ Why is this recorded?"* Zhòngní replied: *"This records what should have been killed but was not."* When what ought to be punished is not punished, the plum and apricot bear fruit in winter. Heaven loses its Way, and even grasses and trees violate the seasons—how much more so for rulers? When a ruler loses the Way, his subjects should overstep him. Under the Yīn dynasty’s laws, those who discarded ashes in the streets were punished. Zǐgòng thought this excessive and asked Zhòngní about it. Zhòngní said: *"This shows he knew the Way of governance."* Discarding ashes in the streets would surely cover people, scattering dust and blinding them. When people are covered, they grow angry, and anger leads to fighting, which would destroy three extended families. Fighting would lead to mutual injury—this is the way to destroy three families, even if it were the state of Jīn. Moreover, grave crimes are what people hate, yet discarding ashes is what people easily neglect. If people avoid what is easy and do not stray from what they hate, this is the Way of governance.

Another account says: Under the Yīn dynasty’s laws, those who discarded ashes on the public thoroughfare had their hands cut off. Zǐgòng said: *"The crime of discarding ashes is light, yet the punishment of amputation is severe. Why were the ancients so harsh?"* Harshness means cruelty. He said: *"Discarding ashes is what people easily neglect, and amputation is what they hate. If people avoid what is easy and do not stray from what they hate, the ancients deemed it easy to enforce, hence they did so."*

The chancellor of Zhōngshān, Lèchí, sent a hundred chariots to Zhào, selecting his clever and capable clients to lead the expedition, commanding those who would guide the troops along the road, assigning them their ranks. Halfway through the journey, chaos erupted. Lèchí said: *"I took you for a man of wisdom, appointing you to lead this expedition. Now you cause disorder mid-journey—why?"* The client excused himself and left, saying: *"You do not understand governance. Those who can be coerced by authority and motivated by rewards can be governed. Now, your ministers are your lesser clients, and your words are those of a lesser man. To follow the young over the old, to govern the noble through the base, yet not hold the reins of reward and punishment to control them—this is why disorder arises. If you were to test this by promoting their capable men to high office and executing those unworthy, why would there still be disorder?"*

The laws of Gōngsūn Lǔ were severe for minor offenses. Grave crimes are what people avoid, while petty transgressions are what people easily abandon. If people abandon what is easy and do not stray from what is grave, this is the Way of governance. If petty transgressions are not committed, grave crimes will not arise—thus, people remain guiltless and disorder does not emerge. Now, grave crimes are lightly punished, and petty crimes are evaded, so guiltless people do not arise, and disorder does not cease.

Another account says: Gōngsūn Lǔ said: *"If punishments are severe for minor offenses, minor offenses will not occur, and grave crimes will not be committed. If people do not commit minor offenses, grave crimes naturally do not arise."* This is called *"using punishment to eliminate punishment."* With light punishments, grave crimes are removed.

In the lands of Kè Nán, beside the Lìshuǐ River, gold was mined. Many secretly dug for it. The prohibition against mining gold was strictly enforced: those caught were publicly flayed and displayed in the market, in great numbers, blocking the river’s flow. Additional guards and barriers were set up, forcing people away from the water. Yet the theft of gold did not cease. Though the punishment of flaying was severe, it did not stop them, for they were not certain to be caught. If those who commit crimes are not always apprehended, people will seek ways to escape punishment and lightly commit grave crimes. Hence, it is said: *"I would give you the world but kill you—no ordinary person would do this."* Though possessing the world is a great gain, no one would do it because they know death is certain. If apprehension is not certain, even flaying will not stop the theft of gold. If death is certain, even the world would not be sought.

The people of Lǔ burned the Jízé marshes. A north wind blew, and the fire leaned southward, its flames spreading south—hence it was called *yǐ*. Fearful of burning the capital, Duke Aí was terrified and personally led the troops to extinguish the fire, but his attendants fled, chasing wild beasts, and the fire was not quelled. He then summoned Zhòngní, who said: *"Those who chased the beasts took pleasure in it and faced no punishment, while those who fought the fire suffered without reward—this is why the fire was not extinguished."* Duke Aí said: *"Well spoken."* Zhòngní said: *"In an emergency, there was no time to offer rewards, so grant rewards to all who fought the fire. But the state cannot afford to reward everyone. Instead, let us now enforce punishments."*

Duke Aí said: *"Well said."* Then Zhòngní issued an order: *"Those who failed to fight the fire shall be punished as if they had fled northward in battle. Those who chased wild beasts shall be punished as if they had entered the forbidden grounds."*

The order had not yet been fully proclaimed when the fire was already extinguished.

Chéng Huān said to the King of Qí: *"Your Majesty is too merciful, too unwilling to punish."*

The King said: *"To be too merciful and too unwilling to punish—is that not a virtue?"*

Chéng Huān replied: *"This is the virtue of a subject, not the conduct of a sovereign. A subject must be merciful to be trusted with counsel, and unwilling to punish to be approachable. But if he is not merciful, he cannot be trusted with counsel; if he punishes too harshly, he cannot be approached."*

The King said: *"Then where should I be merciful and where should I not be?"*

Chéng Huān replied: *"Your Majesty is too merciful to Xué Gōng, yet too unwilling to punish the Zhū Tián clan. Being too merciful to Xué Gōng means the great ministers are not held in esteem. If they are indulged in arrogance and extravagance without cultivating virtue and righteousness, the people will despise them, and thus Your Majesty’s authority will not be revered. Being too unwilling to punish the Zhū Tián clan means that fathers and brothers break the law. If the great ministers are not held in esteem, the military will weaken externally, and if fathers and brothers break the law, governance will falter internally. A weak military externally and chaotic governance internally—these are the roots of a state’s ruin."*

King Huì of Wèi said to Bǔ Pí: *"What do you think of my reputation?"*

Bǔ Pí replied: *"I have heard that Your Majesty is benevolent and kind."*

The King, delighted, said: *"Then what great achievements will follow?"*

Bǔ Pí replied: *"Your Majesty’s achievements will lead to ruin."*

The King said: *"Benevolence and kindness are acts of virtue—how can practicing them lead to ruin?"*

Bǔ Pí replied: *"The merciful are unwilling to punish, and the kind are quick to bestow. If one does not punish wrongdoing, and rewards without merit, even ruin would not be unexpected."*

In the state of Qí, elaborate burials were the fashion—silks and linens were exhausted in shrouds, and fine woods in coffins and outer cases. Duke Huán was troubled by this and consulted Guān Zhòng, saying: *"If all silks and linens are used for burial shrouds, there will be none left for clothing; if all fine woods are used for coffins and outer cases, there will be none left for fortifications. Yet people persist in extravagant burials—how should I prohibit them?"*

Guān Zhòng replied: *"People act either for fame or for gain. Thus, I decree: Those whose coffins and outer cases exceed proper measure shall have their corpses mutilated, and those responsible for the funeral shall be punished."*

Since mutilating the dead brings no honor, and punishing those in mourning yields no gain, why would anyone persist in such practices?

In the time of the heir to the throne of Wèi, a convict named Xū Mí escaped to Wèi and was employed by King Xiāng of Wèi’s physician. The heir of Wèi, hearing of this, sent envoys to offer fifty *jīn* of gold to buy him back, but after five attempts, King Xiāng refused. The heir then offered the city of Zuǒ Shì in exchange.

Zuǒ Shì was the name of a walled city. The ministers and attendants remonstrated: *"Is it proper to trade an entire city for a single convict?"*

The heir said: *"This is not for you to understand. Disorder begins with small matters, and chaos grows from great ones. If small offenses are not corrected, greater chaos will arise. If laws are not enforced and punishments are not certain—if crimes are punished arbitrarily—then it is said that punishments are not fixed. Even if ten Zuǒ Shì were lost, it would be of no benefit. But if laws are upheld and punishments are certain, even the loss of ten Zuǒ Shì would be of no harm."*

King Xiāng of Wèi, hearing of this, said: *"The sovereign wishes to govern but is not obeyed—this is an omen of misfortune."* He then loaded the convict and sent him as a gift.

Though Xū Mí was a convict, the city was not taken in exchange.

---

King Wén of Qí asked Wén Zǐ: *"How should one govern a state?"*

Wén Zǐ replied: *"The Dao of rewards and punishments is a sharp tool. The sovereign must hold it firmly and must not display it to others. If one were like me, they would be like a deer—only drawn to the offering of fresh grass. A deer is drawn to fresh grass, and ministers are drawn to heavy rewards. Thus, the sharp tool of rewards and punishments must not be revealed to others.*

The King of Yuè asked the minister Wén Zhǒng: *'I wish to attack Hào. Is this possible?'*
Wén Zhǒng replied: *'It is possible. My rewards are heavy and trustworthy, my punishments severe and certain. If you wish to test this, why not set fire to the palace?'*
So he set fire to the palace, and no one came to save it. He then issued an order: *'Those who save the fire shall die—rewarded as if they had defeated an enemy. Those who save the fire and do not die shall be rewarded as if they had won a battle. Those who do not save the fire shall be punished as if they had surrendered.'*
Men blackened their bodies, wrapped themselves in wet clothes, and rushed into the flames—three thousand on the left, three thousand on the right. This proved the certainty of victory.

Wú Qǐ served as the governor of Wèi Wǔ Hóu’s Western River region. There was a small Qin outpost near the border, and Wú Qǐ wished to attack it. If left, it would greatly harm the farmers. He said, *'This outpost harms the fields, so it must be removed.'* But removing it would weaken the ability to mobilize troops. Since it was a minor matter, he leaned a single cart axle outside the North Gate and proclaimed: *'Whoever moves this to the South Gate shall be granted the finest fields and residences.'* No one moved it. Then someone did move it, and he was rewarded as promised. Next, he placed a sack of red beans outside the East Gate and proclaimed: *'Whoever moves this to the West Gate shall be rewarded as before.'* The people competed to move it. He then ordered the officials: *'Tomorrow, we shall attack the outpost. Whoever first climbs it shall be appointed a high-ranking minister and granted the finest fields and residences.'* The people rushed to obey, and the outpost was taken in a single morning.

Lǐ Kuā served as the governor of Wèi Wén Hóu’s Upper Lands and wished the people to excel in archery. He issued an order: *'Those with disputes shall settle them by shooting at a target—the target being the object of their dispute. The one who hits wins; the one who misses loses.'* The order was given, and the people eagerly practiced archery day and night without rest. When they fought against the Qin, they defeated them greatly, for the people were skilled in battle and archery.

In Sòng, a man from Chóngmén Lane served his parents with such extreme mourning that he wasted away. The ruler took this as proof of his filial devotion and appointed him an official teacher. The following year, ten or more people died from excessive mourning. If a child mourns their parents so deeply that they can be rewarded for it, how much more should the ruler reward the people? If a ruler does not reward merit, then no great deeds will be accomplished.

The King of Yuè, planning to attack Wú, wished the people to disregard death. He went out and saw an enraged rhinoceros, and he bowed to it in salute. His attendants asked: *'Why do you salute this?'*
The king replied: *'Because it has such qi.'*
The next year, those who offered their heads to the king numbered ten or more annually. From this, it is clear that praise can move people to kill themselves.

When the King of Yuè saw the enraged rhinoceros and bowed to it, his charioteer asked: *'Why do you salute it?'*
The king replied: *'The rhinoceros has such qi—how could I not salute it?'*
The scholars heard this and said: *'The rhinoceros has qi, yet the king salutes it. How much more should those with true courage be honored!'*
That year, men began presenting their heads in self-offering.

When the King of Yuè prepared to avenge Wú and tested his people’s training, he burned a tower and drummed, commanding the people to rush into the fire—reward awaiting them in the flames. Though fire kills, those who rushed into it feared nothing, for they were certain of reward. He did the same by the river, commanding them to rush into the water—reward awaiting them there. In battle, he ordered men to sever heads and disembowel themselves without hesitation—reward awaiting them in war. How much greater, then, would be their willingness to advance the worthy by law, for the aid in this is far greater still! Advancing the worthy grants reward, without the dangers of fire or water, so who would not do it? Those who do not advance the worthy do so only because the ruler does not reward them.

Hán Zhāo Hóu had a worn-out pair of trousers hidden away. His attendant said: *'Your Grace is also unkind—you do not give these to your servants but hide them.'*
Zhāo Hóu replied: *'This is not for you to understand. I have heard that an enlightened ruler’s every frown and smile must be weighed—worrying that they may not be well-placed, encouraging what is good, and never acting recklessly. A frown must have cause, and a smile must have cause. Now, these trousers—how much more so than a frown or smile! If a frown or smile must not be given without reason, how much more so these trousers, which must not be given without merit!'*
The trousers and a frown or smile are far apart—I must wait for those who earn reward, so I store them away, not yet having given them.

The *mǐ* resembles a snake, and the *zhú* resembles a candle. Men are terrified by snakes and shudder at candles. Yet women gather silkworms, and fishermen handle *mǐ*—for where profit lies, they abandon what they fear, all becoming as brave as Mèng Bēn.

Because the *mǐ* and silkworms yield profit, men grasp and gather them, all displaying the courage of Mèng Bēn.

The King of Wèi said to the King of Zhèng: *'Once, Zhèng and Liáng were one state. Later, they separated. Now, I wish to reclaim Zhèng and reunite it with Liáng.'*
The King of Zhèng was troubled and called his ministers to devise a response to Wèi. A prince of Zhèng said to the king: *'This is easily answered. You should say to Wèi: "If Zhèng can be reunited with the old Wèi, then my humble state would also wish to reclaim Liáng and reunite it with Zhèng."'*
The King of Wèi then ceased his demand.

The King of Qi’s court musician required three hundred players to perform the *sú* (panpipes). Nánguō Chǔshì, a reclusive scholar, requested permission to play for the king. The king delighted in him and provided him with rations as if he were one of the three hundred.

The King of Qi died, and King Min of Qi ascended the throne, delighting in hearing the *sú* played one by one. The reclusive scholar fled.

The Lord of Hàn Zhāoshòu said: *"The number of those who play the sú is great; I have no way to know who among them is truly skilled."*

Tián Yán replied: *"Let the king hear them one by one."*

Zhào sent someone to persuade Shēn Zǐ of Hàn to request soldiers, intending to attack Wèi. Shēn Zǐ was afraid to speak of this to his lord, fearing that the lord might suspect him of seeking personal gain—this is what is meant by *shì* (market). If he refused, he feared that Zhào would hold it against him, so he had Zhào Shào and Hàn Yǎo secretly observe the lord’s reactions before reporting them. The changes in his lord’s demeanor could be discerned, hence the term *dòng mào* (reactions). Internally, he understood the Lord of Hàn’s intentions, while externally, he secured a favor from Zhào. After requesting the soldiers, if the lord agreed, the favor would certainly be granted. If he did not agree, Shēn Zǐ would still persist in the request, yet he would not dare to accept the favor, thus ensuring Zhào’s obligation. When the armies of the three states arrived, the King of Hàn said to Lóu Huǎn: *"The armies of the three states are deeply entrenched. I wish to cede Hédōng in exchange for peace—what do you think?"* (Here, *jiǎng* means to yield under pressure, hoping to retain the matter for later negotiation, though ultimately it would revert, much like a debate—hence the term *jiǎng*.)

Lóu Huǎn replied: *"To cede Hédōng would be a great expense. To deliver your state from calamity would be a great deed."*

「This is the duty of your father and elder brothers, my lord. Why not summon **Gōngzǐ Shì** and consult him?

The king summoned **Gōngzǐ Shì** and told him his thoughts. Shì replied: *"Whether you yield or do not yield, both will bring regret."*

If the king now cedes Hédōng to negotiate peace, and the three states withdraw, he will surely say: *"The three states were bound to leave anyway; I merely gave them three cities to send them off."* The three states would leave on their own, and yet he would still give them cities—this would mean he had given away three cities for nothing, and these are words of regret.

If he does not yield, the three states will still invade Hàn, and then the state must mobilize its full strength. The king will certainly regret it deeply, saying: *"I did not offer the three cities."* If he does not yield, the three states will invade and Hàn must surely muster its full strength, and the king will regret it, saying: *"I did not offer the three cities—that is why!"*

Thus, I say: *"Whether the king yields or does not yield, both will bring regret."*

The king said: *"You speak of my regret. I would rather lose the three cities than face regret—only when in peril will I regret."* I have now made my decision not to negotiate peace.

(Here, *jiǎng* refers to the matter of negotiating peace having been settled.)

**Yìng Hóu** said to the **Qín King**: *"Your Majesty has seized Rǎn Yè, Lántián, and Yángxià, cut off Hénèi, and besieged Liáng and Zhèng. The reason you have not yet achieved universal dominion is that Zhào has not yet submitted. Relinquishing Shàngdǎng would be like abandoning a single city—discarding one prefecture alone. But if you use the troops guarding Shàngdǎng to threaten Dōngyáng, then Hán Dān would be in peril like a flea in one’s mouth. Your Majesty could then bow to the heavens and rule all under heaven, but later, they would strike at you with their armies. (Here, *zhòng* means to harm or wound.) Yet, Shàngdǎng’s security and ease come at a great cost. Its location is extremely perilous, and I fear that even if you were to abandon it, the king would not heed my advice. What should I do?"*

Now, Shàngdǎng is secure and prosperous, yet its location is fraught with danger. Even if one wished to abandon it, I fear the king would not listen.

The king said: *"I must certainly abandon it and relocate its troops to threaten Dōngyáng."* I have now definitively decided.

Five. **Páng Jìng**, a county magistrate, sent merchants on their way, then summoned the **Gōngdàfū** to return them. The **Gōngdàfū** also sent men to trade. Without clear orders, they were sent away repeatedly, and in the end, they were all dispatched on their journeys. (Here, *bù mìng* means they were sent without explicit command, and *zuì* means they were finally dispatched—both parties could not fathom the reasoning behind it.)

The merchants thought that the county magistrate and the **Gōngdàfū** had some agreement, yet they did not trust one another, and thus no deception arose.

The **Gōngdàfū**, though informed that the merchants were sent without explicit command (*bù mìng*), still did not believe it, so they dared not deceive.

**Dài Huān**, the **Dàzāi** of Sòng, sent a man at night saying: *"I have heard that for several nights there have been men riding in a **fán chē** arriving at Lǐ Shǐ’s gate. Be vigilant and observe them for me."* The man returned and reported: *"No **fán chē** was seen, but there were men carrying bamboo shoots and speaking with Lǐ Shǐ. Later, Lǐ Shǐ accepted the bamboo shoots."* He was sent to spy on the **fán chē**, but in reality, they were carrying bamboo shoots. The original order was to spy on those carrying bamboo shoots—Lǐ Shǐ would surely change his words.

**Zhōu Zhǔ** lost his jade hairpin, and ordered his officials to search for it. After three days, they could not find it. The officials were then ordered to search again and found it in the chamber of a household servant. **Zhōu Zhǔ** said: *"My officials are not diligent in their duties."* (This means: they are not diligent in attending to my affairs.) Having searched for three days without finding the hairpin, I ordered them to search again, and they found it without delay. Thus, the officials were all filled with dread, believing their lord to be **shén míng** (divinely insightful).

The **Tàizāi** of Shāng sent his junior minister to the market, then turned back and asked him: *"What did you see in the market?"* The minister replied: *"I saw nothing."* The **Tàizāi** said: *"Even so, what did you see?"*

The junior minister replied: *"Outside the South Gate of the market, there were many ox-carts, but they were only passable."* The **Tàizāi** then admonished the messenger, saying: *"Do not dare to inform anyone about what I asked you."* He then summoned the market officials and reproached them: *"Why is there so much ox dung outside the market gates?"*

The market officials were greatly astonished that the **Tàizāi** knew so swiftly, and thus they feared his insight.

**Six.**
The **Zhāozhōu** of Hàn pretended to lose one of his fingers, searching for it with great urgency. His attendants then cut their own fingers to imitate it, but the **Zhāozhōu** discerned that they were not sincere in their loyalty.

Cutting fingers, not sincere.

The **Zhāozhōu** sent a groom to the county market, and when the messenger returned, he asked: *"What did you see?"* The messenger replied: *"I saw nothing."* The **Zhāozhōu** said: *"Even so, what did you see?"* The messenger answered: *"Outside the South Gate, there was a yellow calf eating the crops along the left side of the road."* The **Zhāozhōu** then told the messenger not to dare reveal what he had asked, and issued an order: *"When the crops are being harvested, I forbid oxen and horses from entering the fields of my people—even if ordered to do so by my decree. Yet the officials do not take this as their duty, and many oxen and horses still enter the fields. Quickly report their numbers to me, and if you cannot find them, I will impose severe punishment."* Thus, the three districts reported the incidents and stopped them. The **Zhāozhōu** said: *"This is not all."* He went again to investigate, and finally found the yellow calf outside the South Gate. The officials, recognizing the **Zhāozhōu**’s keen discernment, all feared his scrutiny and dared not act wrongfully.

The **Zhōu Zhǔ** issued an order to search for a crooked staff, and the officials sought it for several days without success. The **Zhōu Zhǔ** then secretly sent someone to find it, who discovered it without delay. He then said to the officials: *"I know that you are not diligent in your duties."* The crooked staff was easy to find, yet the officials could not obtain it. I sent someone to seek it, and it was found without delay—how can you be considered loyal? The officials then all feared his scrutiny, believing their lord to be **shén míng**.

**Seven.**
The **Yángshān Jūn** served as prime minister of Wèi, and when he heard that the king suspected him, he falsely slandered **Qú Shù** to test the king’s reaction. **Qú Shù** was the king’s favorite, and when he was falsely slandered, he would be enraged and reveal the king’s suspicions.

**Dùn Chǐ** heard that the **Wén Wáng** of Qí hated him, so he feigned being a messenger from Qín to test this.

The king, not suspecting the Qín messenger, would surely accept the report.

A man of Qí who wished to cause chaos feared that the king would know, so he falsely drove away the king’s favorite, causing him to flee, and thus the king would know.

The king, knowing that the favorite had been driven away, would not suspect him of causing chaos.

**Zǐ Zhī** served as prime minister of Yān, and while seated, he pretended to say: *"The white horse that ran out of the gate—what was it?"* His attendants all said they had not seen it. One man ran to chase it and reported: *"There is one."* With this, **Zǐ Zhī** knew whether his attendants were sincere and trustworthy.

The one who falsely reported seeing the white horse was not sincere and trustworthy.

When there were litigants disputing before him, **Zǐ Chǎn** separated them and did not allow them to communicate. He then relayed their words in reverse to discern the truth.

If one party uses these words to inform the other, and the other party uses them to inform this one, then the true nature of the litigants’ claims will be known.

The **Sìgōng** of Wèi sent someone as a guest passing through the border market, where the officials harshly obstructed him. The guest then bribed the border officials with gold, and they allowed him to pass. The **Sìgōng** said to the officials: *"At a certain time, there was a guest passing through, and I gave you gold. You then sent him away."* The border officials were greatly alarmed and recognized the **Sìgōng** as one of keen discernment.

The **Six Subtleties**:

1. **Power lent to inferiors** (where the **Dao**/Way is borrowed by those below),
2. **Contrasting private and public interests** (where external gain diverges from internal),
3. **Trusting in false semblances** (where reliance is placed upon deceptive analogies),
4. **Contradictory benefits and harms** (where advantage and detriment invert),
5. **Internal dissension through ambiguous counsel** (where doubt breeds strife within),
6. **Exploiting rival states to undermine the sovereign** (where enemies are provoked to abandon their posts).

These six are the matters the sovereign must observe.

**Power** cannot be lent to others—when the ruler loses it, the minister gains a hundredfold.
Thus, when a minister is lent **power**, his strength increases, and with increased strength, he controls both internal and external affairs, thereby obstructing the sovereign’s **Dao**/Way.
This principle is found in the ancient teachings of **Lǎo** (Laozi) and **Zǐchān** (Zichan).

**Losing fish** (i.e., failing to discern true loyalty).
Therefore, the sovereign speaks at length, while his attendants sell their favors with flattery.
The danger lies in the **būchóng** (buxiong, low-ranking officials) offering harsh counsel.

**Lìgōng** (Ligong, Duke Li of Qi) spoke with the **Zhōuhòu** (Zhouhou, Marquis of Zhou), yet the people of **Yān** (Yan) were struck down by arrows.
**Power lent to inferiors** (1): When the interests of the sovereign and minister diverge, ministers lack loyalty, and while the minister’s gain is established, the sovereign’s **virtue/power** is extinguished.
Thus, treacherous ministers summon enemy forces to purge internal rivals, fabricate external affairs to deceive the sovereign, and pursue their private interests without regard for the state’s calamity.
This is seen in the case of the **Wèirén** (Weiren, wife of the Duke of Wei) praying to her husband.

Hence, **Dàizǎi** (Daisai) plotted against his kin, while the **Sānquán** (Sanquan, Three Marquises) attacked **Zhāogōng** (Zhaogong, Duke Zhao of Lu).
**Gōngchǒu** (Gongchou) invited the **Qí** (Qi) army within, while **Zhāihuáng** (Zhaihuang) summoned the **Hán** (Han) forces.
**Tàizǎi** (Tai Zai) counselled **Dàfù** (Dafu) **Zhǒng** (Zhong), and **Dàchéng Níú** (Dacheng Niu) instructed **Shēnbùxié** (Shenbuhai).
**Sīmǎ Xǐ** (Simaxi) reported to the **Zhào Wáng** (Zhao Wang), and **Lǚ Cāng** (Luyang) advised **Qín** and **Chǔ**.
**Sòng Shí** (Song Shi) dispatched a letter to the **Wèi Jūn** (Wei Jun), and **Bái Guī** (Baigui) taught **Bàoqiǎn** (Baoqian) to expel others.
**Contrasting private and public interests** (2): False analogies lead the sovereign to miss punishment while great ministers fulfill their private schemes.
Thus, the **Ménrén** (Menren) abandoned their water rights, and **Yíshè** (Yishe) was executed.
**Jìyáng** (Jiyang) falsely claimed his own authority, and two men were punished.
**Sīmǎ Xǐ** (Simaxi) killed **Xuān Qián** (Xuanqian), and **Jìxīn** (Jixin) died.
**Zhèng Xuè** (Zhengxue) spoke of foul odors, and the **Xīnrén** (Xinren) was castrated.
**Fèi Wújì** (Feiwuji) instructed **Qī Yuǎn** (Qiyuan), and the **Lìngyīn** (Lingyin) was executed.
**Chén Xū** (Chenxu) killed **Zhāng Shòu** (Zhangshou), and **Xīshǒu** (Xishou) fled.
Hence, the burning of **chú** (straw) and **lì** (grain) led to **Zhōngshān** (Zhongshan)’s punishment, while the killing of **lǎo rú** (old scholars) earned **Jìyáng** (Jiyang) rewards.
**False semblances** (3): When an affair arises with some benefit, the sovereign must examine it, but if it brings harm, he must investigate its reversal.
Thus, the enlightened sovereign’s judgments are: if the state is harmed, he scrutinizes the benefactor; if a minister is harmed, he examines the reversal.
This is seen when **Chǔ**’s army approached and **Chén Xū** (Chenxu) plotted, or when **shǔ zhòng** (glutinous millet) grew expensive and the **lǐn liè** (granary officials) were overthrown.

Hence, **Zhāoxíxù** (Zhaoxixu) seized the **Fàn Máo** (Fanmao) merchant, while **Xīhóu** (Xihou, Duke Xi of Lu) inspected his successor.
**Wén Gōng** (Wengong, Duke Wen of Jin) issued a decree on roasted meat, while **Yáng Hóu** (Yanghou, Duke Yang of Lu) petitioned to establish the **Emperor** (Dì).
**Contradictory benefits and harms** (4): The **power** of ambiguous counsel is the source of disorder.
Thus, the enlightened sovereign must be cautious of it.

Hence, **Lìjī** (Liji) of **Jìn** (Jin) killed **Tàizǐ Shēng** (Taizi Sheng), while the **Zhèng Fūrén** (Zheng Furen) employed poison.
**Zhōu Yú** (Zhouyu) of **Wèi** (Wei) killed his lord **Wán** (Wan), and **Gōngzǐ Gēn** (Gongzi Gen) seized **Dōng Zhōu** (Dongzhou).
**Wángzǐ Zhí** (Wangzi Zhi) was greatly favored, yet **Shāng Chén** (Shangchen) rebelled.
**Yán Suì** (Yansui) and **Hán Mò** (Hanmo) clashed, and **Āihóu** (Aihou, Duke Ai of Jin) was killed by bandits.
**Tián Cháng** (Tianchang), **Gēn Zhǐ** (Genzhi), **Dài Huān** (Daihuan), and **Huáng Xǐ** (Huangxi) opposed, and the **Sòng Jūn** (Song Jun) and **Jiǎn Gōng** (Jiangong, Duke Jian of Qi) were slain.

This principle is seen in **Hú Tú** (Hutu) praising two **good** (hǎo) men, or in **Zhèng Zhāo** (Zhengzhao) questioning the **unborn** (wèishēng).

**Internal dissension through ambiguous counsel** (5): The enemy’s aim is to **exploit** (yín) **discernment** (chá) and **induce** (jiù) **weakness** (mǐ).
If the sovereign does not observe, the enemy will be abandoned and left in place.
Thus, **Wén Wáng** (Wenwang, Duke Wen of Jin) relied on **Fèi Zhòng** (Feizhong), while the **Qín Wáng** (Qinwang) feared **Chǔ**’s envoys.
**Lí Qiě** (Liqie) dismissed **Zhòng Nǐ** (Zhongni), but **Yú Xiàng** (Yuxiang) obstructed **Gān Mào** (Ganmao).
Hence, **Zǐ Bǔ** (Zibu) declared his intentions, and **Yú Cháng** (Yuchang) was employed.
**Internal beauty** (mèirén) was feigned, and **Yú** and **Guó** (Yu and Guo) perished.
A false letter was sent, and **Cháng Hóng** (Changhong) was killed.
**Chicken’s entrails** (jī shāo) were used, and **Yù Jié** (Yujie) was exterminated.

**Exploiting rival states to undermine the sovereign** (6): The enlightened sovereign cuts off such schemes within while applying them externally.
He aids the light and supports the weak—this is called **temple assault** (miào gōng).
If **ambiguous counsel** (cānwù) is employed internally and **espionage** (guān tīng) is practiced externally, then the enemy’s deceit will succeed.
This principle is seen in the **Qín** **jūnróu** (dwarfs) warning **Huì Wén Jūn** (Huiwen Jun).

Hence, **Xiāng Cǐ** (Xiangci) spoke of attacking **Yè** (Yan), while **Sì Gōng** (Sigong) granted him a seat of honor.
**Temple assault** (miào gōng) is recorded in the **Spring and Autumn Annals** (Chūnqiū).

The weighty ministers are the sovereign’s depths.
Ministers are the fish within those depths.
Once the fish is lost in the depths, it cannot be recovered.
When the sovereign loses his weighty ministers to his ministers, they cannot be reclaimed.

The ancients found direct speech difficult, hence they spoke in parables of fish.

Rewards and punishments are sharp instruments.
The sovereign wields them to control his ministers,
while ministers seize them to dominate the sovereign.
Thus, when the sovereign first reveals his rewards,
ministers sell them as virtue;
when the sovereign first reveals his punishments,
ministers sell them as authority.
Hence it is said:
*The state’s sharp instruments must not be displayed to the people.*

Jing Guo Jun served as Qi’s prime minister.
When he spoke at length with old friends, those friends grew wealthy;
when he embraced his attendants, they grew powerful.
Speaking at length with the commander of the guard was but slight favor,
yet it sufficed to make him rich—
what then of the power of officials?

In the time of Duke Li of Jin, the Six Ministers held great power.
Xu Tong, Chang Yu, and Yao Jiao advised:
*"When great ministers grow too powerful,
they vie with the sovereign for influence,
curry favor abroad, sow discord below,
and ultimately coerce the sovereign—
yet a state that does not perish from this has never existed."*

The duke replied, *"Well spoken."*
He executed three of the ministers.

Xu Tong, Chang Yu, and Yao Jiao again advised:
*"When men of equal guilt are punished selectively rather than utterly,
you invite resentment and exploit divisions among them."*

The duke said, *"I spared them out of mercy—
I could not bring myself to destroy them all."*

Yao Jiao replied:
*"Your mercy will be their ruthlessness."*

The duke did not heed him.
Three months later, the ministers rebelled,
killed Duke Li, and divided his lands.

Zhou Hou served as Chu’s prime minister.
Though powerful, he made decisions for the king,
who grew suspicious and questioned his attendants.
They answered in unison: *"None—it is as if from a single mouth."*

The people of Yan, unperturbed, bathed in dog dung.
A man of Yan had a wife who secretly consorted with a scholar.
Her husband returned early from abroad, and the scholar was just leaving.
The husband asked: *"Who is this guest?"*
His wife replied: *"There is no guest."*
He questioned his attendants, and they answered in unison: *"None—it is as if from a single mouth."*

The wife said: *"The master is easily deceived."*
She bathed him in dog dung.

Another account:
A man of Yan named Li Ji often traveled far.
His wife secretly consorted with a scholar.
Li Ji caught them in the act, but the scholar was inside.
The wife, distressed, told her maidservant:
*"Command the young master to rush out naked and disheveled,
and we will pretend not to see."*

The young master followed her plan,
bursting out in haste.
Li Ji asked: *"Who is this man?"*
The household all replied: *"None."*

Li Ji said: *"Do I see a ghost?"*
The woman replied: *"Yes."*
He asked: *"What should I do about it?"*
She said: *"Take one hundred thousand arrows of the five natures’ qi and bathe it."*
Li Ji said: *"Very well."* So he bathed the scholar with the arrows.
Another account says he bathed the scholar in orchid-infused water.

---

Second:
A man of Yan and his wife prayed together, and the diviner said: *"Let me without cause receive a hundred bundles of cloth."*
His husband asked: *"Why so little?"*
The diviner replied: *"More of this, and you will use it to buy a concubine."* The king of Jing wished to exile the noble sons to the neighboring states. Dai Xie said: *"This cannot be done. If noble sons are exiled to the neighboring states, those states will surely honor them. They will say: ‘The exiled son is honored, and if honored, he will certainly become a factional ally of the state that honors him.’ This is teaching your sons to seek favor abroad—it is not advantageous."*

The three sons of the House of Sun of Lu conspired together to seize Duke Zhao of Lu, and they thus seized his state and usurped its authority. The three sons of the House of Sun of Lu were strong, and Duke Zhao attacked the House of Seasonal Sun. The House of Sun’s elder brother and the House of Sun’s younger brother then plotted together, saying: *"Shall we save him?"*
The charioteer of the House of Sun’s younger brother said: *"I am but a household servant—how should I know the affairs of my lord? Whether there is a House of Seasonal Sun or not, which benefits me more?"*
They all replied: *"Without a House of Seasonal Sun, there will be no House of Sun’s younger brother."*
If that is so, then we must save him.
Thus, they struck the northwest corner of the gate and entered. The elder brother of the House of Sun saw the banner of the House of Sun’s younger brother enter and also came to save him. The three houses united, and Duke Zhao was defeated, fleeing to death at Qian Hou.

Gongchou served King Han, and he had great merit with Qi. Gongzhong was highly esteemed by the king, and Gongchou feared that the king would favor Gongzhong. So he made an alliance with Qi and Han to attack Wei. Gongchou then brought the Qi army into Zheng, using it to coerce the Zheng lord and to secure his own position, while keeping faith with the two allied states.

Zhi Huang was a minister of the Wei king, yet he was close to King Han. He summoned the Han army and ordered them to attack Wei, then requested permission to build a fortification for the Wei king to enhance his own standing.

King Yue of Yue attacked King Fu Chai of Wu. King Fu Chai humbly apologized and submitted, and King Yue wished to grant him forgiveness. Fan Li and the Great Official Zhong said: *"This cannot be done. In ancient times, Heaven gave Yue to Wu, but Wu did not accept it, so Heaven turned against Fu Chai—this was Heaven’s retribution. If Yue is given to Wu, accept it with two bows—this cannot be forgiven."*

The Grand Steward Huai sent a letter to the Great Official Zhong, saying: *"When the cunning hare is exhausted, the fine dog is boiled. When the enemy state is destroyed, the scheming minister perishes. Why does the Great Official not release Wu and instead worry about Yue?"*
The Great Official Zhong received the letter, read it, and sighed deeply, saying: *"Kill him, and Yue and Wu will share the same fate."*

Dacheng Niu, following Zhao, told Shen Bu Hai of Han: *"Because Han honors me in Zhao, I ask that Zhao honor you in Han—this way, you will have two Hans, and I will have two Zhaos."*

Sima Xi was a minister of the Zhongshan lord, yet he was close to Zhao. He often secretly revealed Zhongshan’s schemes to the Zhao king.

Lü Cang was a minister of the Wei king, yet he was close to Qin and Jing. He subtly incited Qin and Jing to attack Wei, then requested permission to negotiate peace to enhance his own standing.

Wei’s General Song Shi and the Jing general, Wei Jun, were two generals of their respective states. When the two states were embroiled in conflict, the two men were both leading armies. Song Shi sent a letter to Wei Jun, saying: *"When the two armies face each other, our banners are in sight—do not engage in battle. If battle is fought, both sides will not survive. This is the matter of our two lords; there is no private grudge between us. The wise act by avoiding each other."*

Bai Gui served as the prime minister of Wei, while Puo Qian served as the prime minister of Han. Bai Gui said to Puo Qian: *"You use Han to support me in Wei, and I will use Wei to support you in Han. When I am in power, I will benefit Wei; when you are in power, you will benefit Han."*

---

Third:
A middle-ranking official of Qi named Yi She was serving wine to the king. Drunk, he left and leaned against the gate of the palace attendants. The gatekeeper, having lost a foot and a knee, knelt and begged: *"Does the noble lord have no intention of granting me a remnant servant’s position?"*
Yi She said: *"Begone!"*
The gatekeeper, having lost a foot and a knee, retreated. When Yi She left, the gatekeeper secretly poured water down the gate of the palace attendants, letting it flow to the ground, resembling the appearance of someone drowning. The next day, the king went out and scolded him, saying: *"Who drowned here?"*
The gatekeeper replied: *"I did not see it."*
Although so, yesterday the middle-ranking official Yi She stood here.
The king thus executed Yi She and killed him.

Two ministers of the Wei king were not well-treated by the Duke of Jiyang. The Duke of Jiyang then falsely claimed that someone had forged the king’s orders and plotted to attack him. The king sent someone to question the Duke of Jiyang, saying: *"Who conspired against you?"*
The duke replied: *"There is no one who dared conspire against me."*
Although so, you have often been ill-treated by these two ministers—this is not enough to reach such a point.
The king questioned his attendants, and they replied: *"Indeed so."*
The king thus executed the two ministers.

Ji Xin and Yuan Yan bore a grudge against each other. Sima Xi, newly hostile to Ji Xin, secretly ordered someone to kill Yuan Yan. The lord of Zhongshan believed it was Ji Xin’s doing, and thus executed him.

Among the king of Jing’s beloved concubines was Zheng Yue of Zheng. The king, newly having obtained a beautiful woman, Zheng Yue then instructed her, saying: *"The king greatly enjoys when people cover their mouths in his presence—because you are close to him, you must cover your mouth."*
The beautiful woman entered to see the king, standing close to him, and thus covered her mouth. The king asked about her reason, and Zheng Yue said: *"This is indeed because she fears the king’s odor."*
When the king sat with Zheng Yue and the beautiful woman, Zheng Yue first secretly warned the attendants, saying: *"When the king speaks, quickly obey and respond."*
The king said: *"Beautiful woman, come forward."*
She stood close to him and repeatedly covered her mouth. The king, in confusion, angrily said: *"Sever her nose!"*
The attendants then exposed the blade and severed the beautiful woman’s nose.

Another account says:
The king of Wei sent a concubine to the king of Jing, who greatly delighted in her. The king’s wife, Zheng Yue, knowing that the king loved her, also delighted in her and loved her more than the king himself did. She chose the finest clothes and ornaments for her. The king said: *"My wife knows that I love this new concubine. She delights in her and loves her even more than I do—this is how filial sons nourish their parents, and loyal ministers serve their lords."*

The wife knew that the king did not suspect her of jealousy, so she spoke to the new concubine and said: *"The king greatly delights in and loves you, yet he hates your nose. When you see the king, always cover your nose, then the king will long cherish you."*

Thus, the new concubine obeyed her, and whenever she saw the king, she always covered her nose.

The king asked his wife: *"Why does the new concubine always cover her nose when she sees me?"*
She replied: *"She does not know you well."*
The king insisted on an answer, and she said: *"Recently, she once remarked that she dislikes the smell of me."*
The king, in anger, said: *"Sever her nose!"*
The wife then instructed the attendants: *"When the king speaks, quickly obey and respond."*
The attendants exposed the blade and severed the concubine’s nose.

Fèi Wújí, a close associate of the Minister of Jing, was in enmity with Zhāng Shòu. When Zhāng Shòu was newly appointed, he did not favor Fèi Wújí, so he secretly had someone kill Zhāng Shòu. The king of Wei blamed Fèi Wújí, and thus he was executed.

In Zhōngshān, there was a disgraced prince whose horses were very thin and whose carriages were in disrepair. Some of his attendants bore personal grudges against him, so they petitioned the king: *"The prince is very poor, and his horses are thin. Why not increase their feed?"*
The king refused, and the attendants secretly ordered the nighttime burning of the hay barn. The king blamed the disgraced prince, and thus he was executed.

The state of Wèi had an elderly scholar (*lǎo rú*) who was not favored by the Prince of Jìyáng. There was a guest who held a private grudge against the elderly scholar, so he slandered him, causing the Prince to have him killed. He then presented this as a virtue to the Prince of Jìyáng: *"Your servant did so because he did not favor you, and thus I have killed him for your sake."*
The Prince of Jìyáng, unaware, rewarded him.

Another account says:
The Prince of Jìyáng had a minor concubine (*shào shìzǐ*) who was not recognized. One who wished to gain his favor secretly had the elderly scholar dig for medicinal herbs (*yào*) at the Mǎ Lí mountain, and the minor concubine desired to claim this deed as her own. She entered to see the prince and said: *"The king of Qí sent the elderly scholar to dig for medicinal herbs at the Mǎ Lí mountain. In name, it is digging for herbs, but in truth, it is spying on your state. You should kill him, and this will be a pretext for Qí to blame you."*
The servant said: *"I beg to assassinate him."*
The prince said: *"As you wish."*

Thus the next day, he obtained the scholar in the shadow of the city walls and assassinated him. The Prince of Jìyáng returned to favor him even more.

**Fourth account:**
Chén Xū was a minister of the King of Wèi, yet he was well-loved by the King of Jīng. He urged Jīng to attack Wèi, then secretly requested to act as Wèi’s envoy to mediate, thereby leveraging Jīng’s strength against Wèi.

During the reign of the Duke of Hàn Zhāo, the price of glutinous millet (*shǔ zhǒng*) was once extremely high. The Duke ordered the granaries to be covered, but the officials stole the millet seeds and sold them in great quantities.

When Zhāo Xī Yù was using Jīng’s forces, there was someone who set fire to the granaries and storehouses, but he did not know who it was. Zhāo Xī Yù ordered the officials to seize and interrogate those selling reeds (*máo*), and they turned out to be the arsonists.

During the reign of the Duke of Hàn Lǐ, the cook presented food, and there was raw liver (*shēng gān*) in the soup. The Duke summoned the cook’s assistant and rebuked him, saying: *"How could you dare to place raw liver in my soup?"*
The assistant knelt and confessed, saying: *"I secretly wished to remove the senior cook."*

**Another account states:**
Duke Lǐ was bathing, and there was a pebble (*lì*) in the water. The Duke said: *"If I were to dismiss the senior attendant, would there not be someone to take his place?"*
His attendants replied: *"There would be."*
The Duke called for him and said: *"Why did you place a pebble in my bath?"*
He responded: *"If you dismiss the senior attendant, then I may replace him, and so I placed the pebble in your bath."*

During the reign of Duke Wén, a minister presented roasted meat (*zhì*), and the hair from the meat was still attached. The Duke summoned the cook and reproached him, saying: *"Do you wish me to choke? Why did you leave the hair on the roasted meat?"*
The cook knelt and bowed twice, pleading: *"I have three crimes for which I deserve death: First, I sharpened the knife with a whetstone (*yuán lì*), and though its edge was as keen as Gān Jiāng, it could slice meat cleanly—yet the hair would not sever. This is my first crime. Second, I used a wooden skewer to pierce the sliced meat, yet no hair was visible. This is my second crime. Third, I carried the hot brazier (*fèng chì lú*), and though the charcoal was blazing red, the meat was cooked while the hair remained untouched. Could there not be a slight illness in me that you have not yet detected?"*
The Duke said: *"Well done."*

The Duke then summoned the court officials and reproached them, and indeed, they were guilty—he executed them.

The Duke said: *"When Jin Ping Gong entertained guests, the minor official presented roasted meat with hair still attached. Ping Gong hastily ordered the cook’s execution, forbidding any appeal. The cook cried out to Heaven: ‘Alas! I have three crimes—do I not even know I am to die?’*

Ping Gong asked: *"What do you mean?"*

The cook replied: *"My knife’s edge was sharp enough to sever bone and flesh with the wind, yet it could not cut the hair—that is my first death. I roasted the meat over mulberry charcoal until the flesh turned red and white, yet the hair did not burn—that is my second death. When the meat was fully cooked, I blinked and looked again, yet the hair still clung to the meat—my eyes could not see it—that is my third death. Could it be that someone in this court secretly harbors resentment toward me? Would it not have been better to kill me sooner?"*

The ruler of Zheng had already established a crown prince, yet he favored a beautiful concubine and wished to replace the heir with her son. The queen, fearing this, poisoned the ruler and killed him.

King Cheng of Chu had appointed Shang Chen as crown prince, but later wished to replace him with Gongzi Zhi. Shang Chen, unaware of this, asked his tutor, Pan Chong: *"How can I verify this?"*

Pan Chong replied: *"Serve the wine to Jiang Qian but do not show proper respect."*

The crown prince followed this advice. Jiang Qian then called out to the servants: *"The king intends to depose you and install Zhi as heir!"*

Shang Chen said: *"It is true."*

Pan Chong asked: *"Will you serve him faithfully?"*

The prince said: *"I cannot."* *"Can you make him a feudal lord?"* he asked. *"I cannot."* *"Can you undertake great deeds?"* he said: *"I can."*

Thus, he raised the arms of his encamped soldiers and attacked King Cheng. King Cheng begged for the chance to eat bear's paw and die, but his request was denied, and he was slain by force.

In the state of **Han**, **Magua** served as the minister to **Lord Ai**. **Yan Sui** was greatly favored by their ruler, and the two men deeply harmed each other. Yan Sui then had someone assassinate Han Magua in the court, but Han Magua fled to the ruler and embraced him, so Yan Sui killed Han Magua and seized the lordship of Ai.

In **Qi**, **Tian Heng** served as the minister. **Ken Zhi** was greatly favored by **Duke Jian**, and the two men schemed against each other. Tian Heng exploited private favors to take his state, killing Duke Jian and seizing control of the government.

**Dai Huan** served as the **Taisai** of **Song**, while **Huang Xi** was greatly favored by their ruler. The two men competed for influence and deeply harmed each other, and Huang Xi killed the Song ruler and seized his power.

**Huxu Tu** remarked: *"When a ruler favors his inner concubines, the heir-apparent is in danger; when he favors his outer ministers, the ruling officials are in danger."*

The lord of **Zheng** asked **Zheng Zhao**: *"What of the heir-apparent?"*
Zheng Zhao replied: *"He is also in danger."*

「Zheng Zhao replied: *"The heir-apparent has yet to be truly born."*

The lord asked: *"The heir-apparent has already been designated, yet you say he has yet to be born—why is that?"*

Zheng Zhao answered: *"Though the heir-apparent has been designated, the ruler’s fondness for beauty remains unchecked. If he loves another’s child, he will certainly favor that child, and favoring that child will mean he will surely wish to make it his successor. That is why I say the heir-apparent has yet to be truly born."*

**Chapter Six**

King Wen of Zhou cultivated the favor of **Fei Zhong** and wandered near the side of **King Zhou of Shang**, instructing him to remonstrate with **King Zhou** and disrupt his resolve.

The king of **Jing** sent envoys to **Qin**, and the Qin king treated them with great honor. The king said: *"When a rival state has a virtuous man, it is a cause for concern. Now Jing’s envoy is highly virtuous—this troubles me."* His ministers remonstrated: *"With Your Majesty’s wisdom and virtue, and the strength of our state, we should welcome Jing’s virtuous envoy. Why not secretly retain him and use him as an external agent? Jing will surely execute him."* The king said: *"Good."*

**Confucius** governed **Lu**, and the Way thrived without lost items being picked up. **Duke Jing of Qi** was troubled by this. **Li Qie** advised Duke Jing: *"Removing Confucius is like blowing away a speck of dust. Your Majesty, why not welcome him with high honors and gifts, and send the daughters of **Duke Ai of Lu** to distract him with their beauty?"* Duke Ai, upon receiving the music, would surely neglect his governance. Confucius would surely remonstrate, and his remonstrance would be rejected in Lu, causing him to leave. Duke Jing said: *"Excellent."* He then ordered Li Qie to send the daughters of Duke Ai along with the finest music to Duke Ai. Duke Ai, delighted by the music, neglected his governance. Confucius remonstrated, but was not heeded, and so he departed for **Chu**.

The king of **Chu** asked **Gan Xiang**: *"I wish to send you to Qin as an envoy and make you their prime minister—is this possible?"* Gan Xiang replied: *"It is not."* The king asked: *"Why not?"* He said: *"In my youth, I served **Shi Ju**, the gatekeeper of Shangcai. Shi Ju neither served the lord nor his family, but was infamous for his harshness. I obeyed him willingly. The **Wise King of Chu** and **Zhang Yi’s eloquence**—when I served them, I secured ten high offices and was pardoned from all crimes. This proves my virtue."* The king said: *"If you are to be prime minister of an enemy state and yet retain your virtue, how is this not possible?"* Gan Xiang replied: *"Earlier, when Your Majesty sent **Shao Hua** to **Yue**, he was able to destroy Yue in five years. The reason was that Yue was in chaos while Chu was in order. Now, if Your Majesty knows how to use me in Yue, yet sends me to Qin, is this not too hasty and forgetful?"* The king asked: *"Then what should be done?"* Gan Xiang replied: *"Better to make me prime minister of a friendly state."* The king asked: *"Which friendly state could you serve as prime minister?"* Gan Xiang replied: *"**Gong Li**—he is rarely favored, but in time will become a noble minister. He wears the king’s robes, holds the **Du Ruo** grass, and grasps the jade armband, attending court. Moreover, he can be used to sow discord in Qin."*

When **Wu** attacked **Jing**, **Zi Chu** sent someone to declare in Jing: *"If **Zi Qi** is used, we will strike him. If **Zi Chang** is used, we will abandon him."* The people of Jing, upon hearing this, used **Zi Chang** and dismissed **Zi Qi**. The Wu army attacked, and thus conquered them.

**Duke Xian of Jin** attacked **Yu** and **Guo**, sending them **Qu Chan’s chariots**, **Chui Ji’s jade**, and the daughters of **Duke Ai of Lu**, to honor them and disrupt their governance. **Shu Xiang’s slander of Bian Hong** led him to write a letter: *"Bian Hong told Shu Xiang: ‘You should tell the Jin lord that the time we agreed upon is suitable—why not hurry and send troops?’ He then pretended to leave the letter at the Zhou court and quickly departed."* The Zhou king, believing Bian Hong had betrayed them, executed him and killed him.

**Duke Huan of Zheng** wished to secretly attack **Kuai**, first inquiring about the names of its strong and wise ministers, selecting the finest lands of Kuai to bribe them, and granting them titles and offices in writing. He then set up altars outside the city gates, as if preparing for an alliance, and sealed the pact with a **sacrificial chicken** (□). Kuai’s lord, suspecting internal strife, executed all his virtuous ministers. Duke Huan then secretly attacked Kuai and conquered it.

**E Order** (邺令), **Xiang Ci**, secretly cultivated favor with the **Duke of Zhao’s** attendants. When the Duke of Zhao plotted to secretly attack E, Xiang Ci would always hear of it first and report it to the **King of Wei**. The King of Wei prepared defenses, and the Duke of Zhao would retreat.

**Chapter Seven**

The **Qin court dwarf** was skilled in **Jing**, and secretly cultivated favor with **Jing’s** king’s attendants, while also being highly trusted by **Duke Huiwen of Qin**. When Jing had any plot, the dwarf would always hear of it first and inform Duke Huiwen.

During the reign of **Duke Si of Wei**, there was a man among his ministers who was skilled in **Jing**. The county magistrate had a **worn-out bed** (席蓐甚), and Duke Si, upon returning, sent someone to give him a new bed, saying: *"I heard that your bed is now worn out, so I give you a new one."* The county magistrate was greatly startled, believing his lord to be divine.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: External Sayings—Left, Part One**

The **Way of the Enlightened Ruler** is like **You Ruo’s** response to **Prince Mi of the State of You**.

The Enlightened Ruler, when listening to words, admires their eloquence; when observing actions, values their distance from the world. Thus, his ministers and people speak in **obscure and lofty** terms, and their conduct is detached from the world.

This is illustrated in **Tian Yu’s** reply to the **King of Jing**.

Hence, **Mozi** made the **wooden pigeon** (木鸢) and **Ou Ji** built the **Hall of Wu**.

**Medicinal wine and elixirs** are used to test a ruler’s **unique insight**—whether he is a **wise and sagely sovereign**.

The **ruler’s** way of listening to words is not based on their practical use, then speakers will offer **persuasive arguments about white horses** (棘刺白马之说). If he does not rely on **proper standards** (仪的) for judgment, then **archers** will all claim to be like **Yi** (羿).」

The **Ruler’s** way of speaking is all like **Yan Wang’s** learning of the **Dao/Way**, yet those who engage in long-winded discourse are like the **people of Zheng** quarreling over years.

Thus, words may be **subtle and minute**, difficult to discern yet devoid of practical purpose, so **Lǐ Kǎi, Huìzǐ, Sòngzǐ, and Mòzǐ** all drew diagrams to clarify them.

Arguments may be **profound and vast**, yet lacking in substance, so **Wèi Shèn’s** *"Chariot of Pan"* and **Zhān Chē’s** *"Ghostly Apparitions"* were mere illusions.

Words that are **obdurate yet hollow**, lacking in genuine efficacy, are why **Mùzi’s** followers and **Mò Dì** (墨翟) all held firm to their **empty gourds** (坚瓠).

Moreover, **Yu Qīng** praised the carpenter, yet the house collapsed; **Fàn** praised the craftsman, yet the bow snapped.

Therefore, to seek **sincerity**, one must not merely rely on **rewards and remuneration** (归饷).

**Three.** When one acts on behalf of others, they demand **reputation**; when acting for oneself, they seek **practical results**. Hence, father and son may harbor **grudges and discord**, yet the **hireling** (庸作者) is offered **delicious broth** (美羹). This is seen in **Wén Gōng’s** preemptive declaration and **Gōu Jiàn’s** self-proclaimed **imperial majesty** (如皇).

Thus, **Huan Gōng** concealed his **anger at the State of Cai** (蔡) and attacked **Chǔ**; **Wú Qǐ** harbored resentment toward **Liáo Shí** (廖实) and suffered **self-inflicted wounds**.

Yet the **hymns and odes** of the **ancient kings**, the **inscriptions on bells and tripods**, were all **Pan’s** (潘吾) **empty traces** and **Mount Hua’s** **superficial display**. What the **ancient kings** truly sought was **profit**, and what they truly employed was **strength**.

The **proverb of Dù** (筑杜) states: *"Look at the words, not the speaker."* (目辞说)

If we **grant permission** to scholars to **adorn their speech** like the **ancient kings**, would that not be **unfitting for the present age**?

If it cannot be **changed**, then the **people of Xíng County** (郑县人) obtained **chariot privileges** (车厄), the **people of Wèi** (卫人) assisted **Yì** (弋), and **Bù Zǐ’s** wife was given **defective garments** (写弊袴), yet these were **minor matters**.

The **ancient kings’** words had some that were **minor in deed yet grand in public perception**, and some that were **grand in deed yet minor in public perception**—one cannot **predict their true worth**.

This is seen in the **Song people’s** *"unbinding of books"* and the **Liáng people’s** *"reading of records"*. Hence, the **ancient kings** had the **Yǐng Book** (郢书), yet the **later generations** multiplied **superficial interpretations** (燕说).

The **heavens** do not **align with the affairs of states** nor **consult the ancient kings**, but all seek those who **measure and assess** (取度者).

**Four.** Where **profit** lies, the people will **gather**; where **renown** shines, the scholars will **die for it**.

Thus, if **meritorious deeds** lie **outside the law** and **rewards** are **added**, then the **ruler** will not **trust** that the people below will **obtain their profit** from it.

If **renown** lies **outside the law** and **praise** is **added**, then the scholars will **pursue renown** while the **common folk** will **abandon their ruler** below.

Hence, **Zhōng Zhāng** and **Xū Jǐ** served as officials, yet the people of **Zhōng Mò** (中牟) **forswore their fields** and **followed the literary scholars**, halving their **taxable households**.

**Píng Gōng** endured **pain in his feet** and **lame legs** yet dared not **damage his seat**—the **officials of Jìn** (晋) who **sought refuge** (辞仕) were like **hammers** to the state.

These **three scholars**, when **speaking according to the law**, were merely **official records**; when **acting in accordance with duty**, they were like **ordinary citizens**. Yet the **ruler’s** **honors** were **extremely grand**.

If **speech deviates from the law** and **actions stray from duty**, then they are **beyond the common people**—how then could the **ruler** honor them? **Honors should be abolished**.

Moreover, **scholars who dwell in learning**, when the state is **at peace**, do not **exert their strength**; when there is **calamity**, they do not **don armor**. If honored, they **boast of their cultivation** and **agricultural and martial prowess**; if not honored, they **challenge the ruler’s authority**.

How can the **ruler** **benefit** from scholars who **dwell in learning**?

Thus, the **enlightened kings** **assessed** **Lǐ Cǐ** and **viewed Zhōngshān**.

**Five.** The **poem** says:
*"Not to **personally labor** nor **take things seriously**,
then the **common people** will not **trust**."*

---

**Chapter Five (continued).**

The **ruler** should **honor** Fù Yuè with **unwoven purple robes** and **bestow upon him the sash of a high official** like Zhèng Jiǎn and Sòng Xiāng, **rewarding him with respect and authority over agricultural and martial affairs**. If the **ruler** does not **clearly define distinctions** nor **demand sincerity**, but instead **personally labors** and **occupies a lowly position**, moreover **acting as a commoner’s errand-boy**, **sleeping in humble lodgings**, and **wearing coarse garments**—then **such conduct is unworthy of a sage**.

Kǒng Qiū did not know this, so he was **compared to the lowly Mèng Zhòng**. Zōu Jūn did not know this, so he **first punished himself**. The **Way of the enlightened ruler** is like Shū Xiàng’s **hunting song** and Zhāo Hòu’s **listening to the music of the Pei people**. **Six.** The **poem** says:

*"Small trust fulfilled, great trust arises—
thus the **enlightened ruler** accumulates **trust** (xìn).*
If **rewards and punishments lack sincerity**, then **prohibitions and commands will not be obeyed**. This is seen in **Fù Yuè’s attack on Yuán** and **Jī Zhèng’s relief of famine**.

Therefore, **the enlightened ruler demonstrates trust**—like Zēng Zǐ’s **slaughtering of the pig**—so that his subjects may believe him. **Disasters arise** when **Zhōu Lì** **strikes the warning drum** and **Lǐ Kuí** **mockingly unites the two states**.

**One.** Mì Zǐ Jiàn governed **Dān Fù**. Yǒu Ruò saw him and said: *"Why do you appear so gaunt?"* Mì Zǐ replied: *"The **ruler** does not know my worth, yet he commands me to govern **Dān Fù**. The **official duties** are urgent, and I worry over them, so I am gaunt."* Yǒu Ruò said: *"In ancient times, Shùn struck the **five-stringed drum**, sang the **Song of the South Wind**, and the world was governed. Now, with **Dān Fù’s trifling matters**, you govern it and yet still worry. How would you govern the world?"*

Thus, **one who possesses skill** should **guide** (yù) him, **remaining seated in the ancestral hall**, **resisting the allure of women’s beauty**, yet **not harming governance**. **One who lacks skill** may **wear himself out** in **personal labor**, yet **still gain no benefit**.

The **King of Chǔ** said to **Tián Chóu**: *"Mò Zǐ is a **renowned scholar** (xiǎn xué). His **person** is acceptable, but his **speech is excessive yet unpersuasive**—why is this?"* Tián Chóu replied: *"In ancient times, the **Marquis of Qín** gave his daughter in marriage to a **Jìn prince**, commanding **Jìn** to adorn her with **elaborate attire** and **seventy attendants** in **embroidered garments**. When they arrived in **Jìn**, the people **cherished the attendants** while **disdaining the princess**. This may be called **skill in marrying attendants**, yet it cannot be called **skill in marrying a princess**.*

A **Chǔ man** sold his **pearls in Zhèng**, placing them in a **wooden box** (mùlán) **adorned with fragrant cypress and nutmeg**, **embellished with jade and gemstones**, **decorated with rose quartz**, and **bound with kingfisher feathers**. The **Zhèng people bought the box** but **returned the pearls**. This may be called **skill in selling the box**, yet it cannot be called **skill in selling pearls**.*

Now, **the world’s scholars** all **pursue eloquent rhetoric and ornamental speech**, and **rulers admire their words** while **forgetting their practical use**. Mò Zǐ’s **teachings** **transmit the Way of the former sages** and **discuss the words of the wise**, **proclaiming them to the people**. If he **persuaded through rhetoric**, then **people might admire his words** while **forgetting their true meaning**, **allowing ornamentation to harm utility**. This is **of the same kind** as the **Chǔ man selling pearls** and the **Marquis of Qín marrying his daughter**—thus his **speech is often unpersuasive**.

Mò Zǐ crafted a **wooden pigeon** (mùyuān), and it took **three years** to complete. Yet it **flew for only one day** before **failing**. His **disciples said**: *"Master, your **skill** is great—you can make a wooden pigeon fly!"* Mò Zǐ replied: *"I am not as **adept as a wheelwright**. A wheelwright uses **a short span of wood**, expends **no more than two days’ labor**, yet **bears the load of thirty stone** and **extends its far-reaching power** for **many years**. Now, I spend **two years** to make the pigeon, yet it **fails after one day**. Hùi Zǐ heard of this and said: *"Mò Zǐ is **highly skilled**, skilled in making **wheels**, clumsy in crafting **wooden pigeons**."*

The **King of Sòng** and **Qí** were **enemies**, so he **built the Wǔ Palace**. **The singer Gǔ** performed, and **those who marched stopped**, while **those who built did not tire**. The **king heard of his summoning** and **granted him rewards**. Gǔ replied: *"Your servant’s teacher, **Shè Jī**, sings **even better than I**."* The **king summoned Shè Jī** to perform, and **those who marched did not stop**, while **those who built knew weariness**. The **king asked**: *"Though the marchers did not stop and the builders grew weary, your teacher’s song was not as **effective as yours**—why?"*

Gǔ replied: *"Your Majesty **measure his merit**—I sing **four beats**, while Shè Jī sings **eight**. As for **their firmness**, I sing **five inches**, while he sings **two inches**. **Fine medicine tastes bitter**, yet **wise men take it** because they know it **cures their ailments**. **True words may grieve the ear**, yet **enlightened rulers listen** because they know it **brings success**."*

A man from Song once petitioned to craft a **mother monkey** from the tip of a thorn for the King of Yan. He claimed that one must observe it only after three months of fasting. The King thus kept him with three carriages of provisions.

The royal attendants and smiths spoke to the King: *"Your Majesty, we have heard that a sovereign should not go ten days without fasting for the sake of leisure. Now we know that Your Majesty cannot long fast to observe this useless artifact, so he sets the term as three months. All who carve must use a tool smaller than what they carve. Now this man is cold-hearted—he has no tool to carve with. This is impossible. Your Majesty must examine it."*

The King imprisoned and questioned him, and indeed found him lying, so he executed him.

The man said to the King: *"Those who speak without measure are many in their thorn-tip theories."*

---

The King of Yan delighted in subtle craftsmanship. A man from Wei said: *"I can carve a mother monkey from the tip of a thorn."* The King was pleased and kept him with five carriages of provisions. The King said: *"Let me see the guest carve the thorn-tip mother monkey."* For the sovereign to observe it, he must abstain from the palace for half a year, drink no wine, eat no meat, and only view it at dawn when the rain had cleared and the sun emerged—then the thorn-tip mother monkey could be seen. The King of Yan thus kept the man from Wei but could not observe his work.

A smith from Zheng beneath the palace told the King of Yan: *"I am a carver. All delicate things must be carved with a tool, and what is carved must be larger than the tool. Now the thorn-tip cannot contain a blade—it is difficult to carve the thorn-tip."* The King said: *"Let me see the guest’s ability to carve or not."* The King said: *"Good."* He asked the man from Wei: *"Do you carve with a tool?"* He replied: *"With a tool."* The King said: *"I wish to see it."* The guest said: *"I shall fetch it from my dwelling."* He then fled.

The man was a skilled debater from Song, one who argued *"A white horse is not a horse"* and wore the robes of the scholars from Qi’s Jixia Academy. When riding a white horse past a checkpoint, he would turn to pay the tax on the white horse. Thus, with empty words, he could deceive an entire kingdom, but when tested on facts, he could not even fool a single person.

A newly sharpened arrow, drawn in a bow, though shot blindly, will never miss a hair’s breadth—yet one cannot return it to its original place, nor can it be called a skilled archer, for there is no fixed target. Set a target five inches wide at ten paces’ distance, and even Yi or Feng Meng cannot guarantee a hit—this is because there is a fixed target. Difficult things have measures, while easy things do not. With a fixed target, Yi and Meng consider five inches a feat, but without one, hitting a hair’s breadth blindly is called clumsy. Thus, without measure, sophists multiply their arguments, but when measure is applied, even the wise fear failure and dare not speak recklessly.

Now, the sovereign listens to speech without applying measure, praises the eloquence without measuring its merit, and commends actions without examining their substance—this is how the sovereign is long deceived, and how the speakers are long nourished.

There was a guest who taught the King of Yan the **Way of Immortality**. The King sent men to learn it, but before they could complete their studies, the guest died. The King grew furious and executed them. He did not realize the guest had deceived him, nor that punishing the students was too late.

To believe in impossible things and punish the innocent—this is the harm of failing to discern.

Moreover, what a man most urgently needs is his own life. If he cannot ensure his own immortality, how can he ensure the King’s?

A man from Zheng argued over age with another. One said: *"I am the same age as Yao."* The other replied: *"I am the same age as the elder brother of the Yellow Emperor."* They could not settle the dispute, so they agreed that the one who exhaled last would win.

A guest painted a **gourd** for the Duke of Zhou. It took three years to complete, and when the Duke observed it, it resembled a lacquered gourd. The Duke of Zhou grew angry, and the painter said: *"Build a wall ten *pán* high, carve a window eight *chi* wide, and observe it at sunrise."* The Duke did so, and upon gazing, he saw the gourd transform into dragons, snakes, birds, beasts, chariots, and horses—all creatures fully formed. The Duke of Zhou rejoiced greatly. Though the gourd’s craftsmanship was indeed subtle and difficult, its use was no different from a plain lacquered gourd.

A guest painted for the King of Qi, who asked: *"What is hardest to paint?"* He replied: *"Dogs and horses are difficult."* *"What is easiest?"* He answered: *"Ghosts and spirits are easiest."* Dogs and horses are known to all—seen daily before one’s eyes, yet their likeness cannot be replicated, hence the difficulty. Ghosts and spirits have no form, do not appear before one, hence their ease.

There was a recluse in Qi named Tian Zhong. A man from Song named Qu Gu saw him and said: *"I have heard of your virtue—you do not rely on others for food."* Now, I have a method for growing **bottle gourds**—hard as stone, thick with no holes. I present them to you."* Zhong said: *"What makes a gourd valuable is its capacity to hold things. Now it is thick with no holes, so it cannot be split to contain objects, nor can it bear weight like stone, so it cannot be split to pour liquids. I have no use for it."* The man said: *"Indeed, I was about to discard it. Now, Tian Zhong does not rely on others for food, yet he also brings no benefit to his state—he is like this useless gourd."*

Yu Qing was building a house and told the craftsmen: *"This house will be tall."* The craftsmen replied: *"This is a new house—its plaster is wet and its beams are green."* Yu Qing said: *"No. Wet plaster is heavy, and green beams are bent. To bear heavy plaster with bent beams, this house should be low. But as time passes, the plaster dries and the beams straighten. Dry plaster is light, and straight beams are firm—thus, bearing light plaster with straight beams, this house will indeed be tall."* The craftsmen conceded, built it as such, and the house collapsed.

Another account:
Yu Qing was about to build a house, and the craftsmen said: *"The timber is green and the plaster is wet. Green timber is bent, and wet plaster is heavy—bearing heavy plaster with bent beams, even if it stands now, it will surely collapse in time."*

「Yu Qing said: *"If the timber is dry, it will be straight; if the plaster is dry, it will be light. Now if we truly obtain dryness, day by day the lightness and straightness will increase—though it endure long, it will surely not collapse."* The craftsmen conceded, and built it as such, but after some time, the house indeed collapsed.

Fan Qi said: *"A bow bends when stretched to its limit, not at its beginning."* When the craftsmen stretched the bow, they bent the bow for thirty days before stepping on the string, and then violated the tension in one day. This was to restrain it at the beginning and exhaust it at the limit—how could it not bend? But the way of stretching a bow is not like this. One should bend the bow for one day and step on the string, then release the tension over thirty days. This is to exhaust it at the beginning and restrain it at the limit. The craftsmen were exhausted, and did so, and the bow broke.

The words of Fan Qi and Yu Qing are both elegant and persuasive in speech, yet contrary to the reality of the situation. The ruler was pleased by their arguments but did not heed them, and this is why disaster befell. To reject those skilled in practical arts while admiring the empty eloquence of rhetorical beauty is to abandon the craftsmen who build houses and stretch bows.

Thus, when rulers consider state affairs, they do not grasp the principles of craftsmen in building houses or stretching bows—yet when scholars are exhausted like Fan Qi and Yu Qing, their words are mere empty rhetoric, which prevails without utility, or practical truth, which is unyielding yet useless. Rulers often favor empty rhetoric over sound counsel, and this is why chaos ensues.

In our age, there are no shortage of Fan Qis and Yu Qings, yet rulers are swayed by them without end. This is to honor those who bring ruin and defeat while treating the skilled as mere craftsmen. Unable to apply their expertise, the houses collapse and the bows break. Those who know governance cannot implement their methods, and thus the state falls into disorder while its ruler faces peril.

When infants play together, they use dust as food, plaster as soup, and wood as a drum. Yet by evening, they must return home—white dust for food and plaster for soup can be used for play but not for sustenance. To praise the traditions of ancient times with empty rhetoric, to debate the virtues of the sage-kings without being able to govern the state properly, is also like play that cannot be applied to actual governance.

Those who emulate virtue and righteousness yet bring weakness and chaos are the Three Jin. Those who do not emulate them yet achieve strength and order are Qin. Yet Qin was strong but did not become an emperor—its governance was not yet complete.

Three: When a man is still an infant, his parents feed him simply, and when he grows up, he complains. When a son reaches maturity and his provisions are meager, his parents grow angry and reproach him. Father and son are the closest of kin, yet one curses while the other complains—both are driven by self-interest and not by consideration for the other.

When a laborer sells his strength and a farmer scatters his seeds, the owner spends his household resources and offers fine food, and when the laborer adjusts his clothing and seeks easier money, it is not because he loves the laborer—he merely says, *"This is how it is; the farmer will plow deeply, hoe thoroughly, and cultivate diligently."* When the laborer applies his utmost effort and the farmer straightens the furrows and aligns the ridges at the proper time, it is not because he loves the owner—he merely says, *"The soup will be delicious, and the money will be easy."* This is how they nurture their labor and cultivate their fields, with the affection of a father and son, yet their hearts are attuned only to their own benefit—all are driven by selfish motives.

Thus, when people act and give, if their hearts are focused on profit, the Yue people will easily be pacified. If their hearts are focused on harm, then even father and son will turn away and resent one another.

Wen Gong of Jin attacked Song, and first proclaimed: *"I have heard that the ruler of Song is without the Dao/Way, he scorns and insults the elders, distributes wealth unfairly, and his commands are not trusted. I come to punish him for the people."* The Yue people attacked Wu, and first proclaimed: *"I have heard that the Heavenly King built a tower like the Ru Huang, dug deep pits, exhausted the common people, and drained their wealth, using up their strength. I come to punish him for the people."*

Cai Nü became the wife of Duke Huan of Qi. Duke Huan took her on a boat, and she rocked the boat violently. Duke Huan was greatly frightened and forbade her, but she did not stop. He grew angry and expelled her. Later, he recalled her and remarried her. Duke Huan was enraged and prepared to attack Cai, but his senior advisor remonstrated: *"To use a bedding joke to justify attacking another state is inconsistent with governance and military affairs. I beg you not to use this as a pretext."* Duke Huan did not listen, and the senior advisor said: *"If it is unavoidable, then the Zhen Mao of Chu have not paid tribute to the Son of Heaven for three years now. You might as well raise an army to attack Chu for the Son of Heaven. If Chu submits, then return and attack Cai, saying: 'I came to punish Cai for the Son of Heaven because Cai did not send troops to assist. Now I will annihilate it.'"*

This is righteous in name yet advantageous in reality. Therefore, there must be the pretense of punishing for the Son of Heaven, while in truth it is vengeance.

Wu Qi served as a general for Wei and attacked Zhongshan. Among the soldiers, there were those afflicted with carbuncles, and Wu Qi knelt to suck the pus from their wounds. The mother of one of the injured soldiers stood weeping, and someone asked: *"The general treats your son this way—why do you still weep?"* She replied: *"Wu Qi once sucked the wound of his own father, and his father died. Now my son is also about to die. That is why I weep."*

The ruler of Zhao ordered craftsmen to install hooks and ladders on Pan Wu, carving human footprints into its surface—three feet wide, five feet long—and inscribed: *"The ruler often ascends here."* The king of Qin Zhao ordered craftsmen to install hooks and ladders on Huaxia Mountain, using the pith of pine and cypress for chessboards, with arrows eight feet long and pieces eight inches long, and inscribed: *"Zhao Wang once played chess with the Heavenly God here."*

Wen Gong returned to his state, and upon reaching the Yellow River, he ordered his attendants to discard the ritual food baskets and bedding, and to follow only those whose hands and feet were calloused, and whose faces were dark and weathered. Cai Fan heard of this and wept at night. The duke said: *"I have been exiled for twenty years and now have returned to my state. Cai Fan heard of this and did not rejoice but wept—does he not wish me to return?"* Cai Fan replied: *"The ritual food baskets are for eating, and the bedding is for sleeping. Yet the ruler discards them."*

The hands and feet calloused, the face dark and weathered—these are those who labor and earn merit—yet the lord places them behind him. Now, I have those who follow me, and my grief is too great to bear, hence my weeping.

Moreover, many were the ministers who used deceit and falsehood to help me return to my state, yet I still despise myself—how much more so should I despise you? I bow twice and take my leave.

Wen Gong restrained him and said: *"The proverb says: 'When building the ancestral shrine, one kneels and places it, and with solemn cap and robes performs the rites.' Now you have taken it with me, yet you do not help me govern it; you have placed it with me, yet you do not help me worship it—how can this be?"* He untied the left rein of his chariot and swore an oath by the Yellow River.

There was a man from Zheng County named Yi Zi, who told his wife to make him trousers. His wife asked: *"What should these trousers be like?"* He replied: *"Like my old ones."* So his wife destroyed the new cloth to make them like the old trousers.

A man from Zheng County found a chariot yoke but did not know its name, so he asked another: *"What is this called?"* The other replied: *"This is a chariot yoke."* Soon he found another and asked again: *"What is this called?"* The other replied: *"This is a chariot yoke."* The questioner grew furious and said: *"Just now you said 'chariot yoke,' and now you say 'chariot yoke' again—what is this multitude? This woman deceives me!"* He then fought with him.

A man from Wei who assisted in hunting would, when birds approached, first wave his quiver to startle them, so that the birds would not settle and he could not shoot them.

A wife from Zheng County went to market and bought a turtle, which she carried home. Passing the Ying River, she thought it was thirsty, so she released it to drink—and thus lost her turtle.

When a younger man serves an elder in drinking, the elder drinks while the younger also drinks. *(One version says:)* *"When the elder drinks, the younger drinks too."*

A man from Lu who took pride in imitation saw an elder drink wine without finishing it, so he spat after drinking. He too spat in imitation.

One version says: A man from Song who also wished to emulate virtue saw an elder drink without leaving any wine, not merely refilling his cup but draining it completely. The *Book of Documents* says: *"Bind him with sashes."* A man from Song who was well-mannered thus wore double sashes to bind himself. Someone asked: *"Why do you do this?"* He replied: *"The *Book of Documents* says so—it is indeed so."* The *Book of Documents* also says: *"After carving and polishing, return to simplicity."* A man from Liang who was refined in his actions and speech, in all his affairs followed propriety, and said it was difficult—yet lost the true meaning. Someone asked: *"Why do you do this?"* He replied: *"The *Book of Documents* says so—it is indeed so."*

A man from Ying sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Yan. Writing at night with dim firelight, he told the man holding the candle: *"Raise the candle."* By mistake, the scribe wrote *"Raise the candle"* instead of *"Hold the candle."* The Prime Minister of Yan received the letter and praised it, saying: *"Raise the candle—this means to honor brightness. Honoring brightness means promoting and entrusting the worthy."* The Prime Minister reported this to the king, who was greatly pleased, and the state prospered. Though the state prospered, this was not the original intent of the letter. Today, many scholars who are promoted resemble this case.

A man from Zheng was about to buy sandals. First, he measured his own feet and placed the measurement beside him. Upon reaching the market, he forgot to bring it. After obtaining the sandals, he said: *"I forgot to bring my measurement."* He returned home to fetch it, but by the time he returned, the market had closed, and he could not get the sandals. Someone asked: *"Why didn’t you try them on with your feet?"* He said: *"I trust the measurement more than my own feet."*

Wang Deng served as the magistrate of Zhongmou and reported to Duke Xiang of Jin: *"In Zhongmou, there are two scholars named Zhong Zhang and Xu Ji. Their conduct is impeccable, and their learning is vast. Why not promote them?"* The duke said: *"You have seen them—I will make them Middle Great Officers."* The Prime Minister’s aide advised: *"The Middle Great Officer is a high rank in Jin. To receive it without merit contradicts the intentions of Jin’s officials. Does Your Grace listen with your ears but not see with your eyes?"* Duke Xiang said: *"I have already listened with my ears and seen with my eyes regarding Deng. Deng’s recommendations are also heard and seen—this is the endless cycle of relying on ears and eyes."* Wang Deng was thus granted two Middle Great Officer positions in a single day, given fields and houses. Half the people of Zhongmou abandoned their farms and sold their homes to follow him in studying.

Chu Xiang served as Duke Ping’s charioteer. When the duke’s calf ached and his foot cramped, he could not bear to leave his seat. All of Jin heard of it and said: *"Chu Xiang is a virtuous man—Duke Ping honors him so much that he endures cramps rather than leave his seat."* Those in Jin who sought office or aspired to emulate Chu Xiang became like a hammer striking the state.

There was a man named Qu Gong from Zheng County who, upon hearing of an enemy, died in fear. When he heard of himself, he revived.

Zhao’s Prime Minister sent Li Ci to scout whether Zhongshan could be attacked. Upon returning, Li Ci reported: *"Zhongshan can be conquered. If Your Majesty does not attack soon, you will be surpassed by Qi and Yan."* The Prime Minister asked: *"Why can it be attacked?"* Li Ci replied: *"Their ruler favors reclusive scholars in caves, showering them with gifts—dozens of them from humble alleys and narrow lanes—and honors plain-clothed scholars by the hundreds with respectful ceremonies."* The Prime Minister said: *"By your words, this is a virtuous ruler—how can he be attacked?"* Li Ci said: *"Not so. When a ruler honors reclusive scholars and holds them in court, the soldiers grow lax in battle formations. When scholars are honored above commoners, farmers neglect their fields. Soldiers lax in battle mean weak arms, and farmers neglecting their fields mean a poor state. A state that is weak against enemies and impoverished within will not survive—conquer it, why not?"* The Prime Minister said: *"Excellent."* He raised an army and attacked, and Zhongshan was thus destroyed.

「The Duke of Qi favored wearing purple, and the entire state followed suit, so much so that during his time, for every five plain garments, not even one purple one could be found. The Duke was troubled by this and said to Guan Zhong: *"I love purple robes, and purple is highly valued. But the common people all wear purple without end—what should I do?"*

Guan Zhong replied: *"Why not try not wearing purple yourself?"* He then instructed the Duke’s attendants: *"I greatly detest the smell of purple."* When any of the Duke’s courtiers wearing purple approached, the Duke would say: *"Step back! I hate the smell of purple."* The Duke said: *"Very well."* From that day on, no attendant wore purple, and the next day, no one in the court wore purple. By the third day, no one in the entire state wore purple.

**One.**

The King of Qi favored purple robes, and his people all followed suit. In the state of Qi, for every five plain garments, not even one purple one could be found. The King was troubled by the high cost of purple. He told Fu Yue: *"The Book of Poetry says: ‘If you do not personally lead, the common people will not believe.’ Now, Your Majesty wishes the people not to wear purple, yet you yourself still wear purple robes in court. When any minister wearing purple approaches, you say, ‘Move farther away! I loathe the stench.’"* From that day on, no attendant wore purple, and that month, no one in the court wore purple. By that year, no one in the entire state wore purple.

**Two.**

The Duke of Zheng said to Zi Chan: *"Our state is small and hemmed in between Chu and Jin. Now our city walls are incomplete, and our armor and weapons are inadequate. We cannot rely on this to face unexpected threats."* Zi Chan replied: *"I have already secured the outer defenses, and the inner governance is firmly established. Though our state is small, it is not in danger."* The Duke said: *"Do not worry then."* Thus, after the Duke’s death, the state remained unharmed. Zi Chan served as the Duke’s minister, and the Duke said to him: *"You do not enjoy drinking wine, the sacrificial vessels are not grand, the bells and drums with the zither and sheng do not sound—my affairs are not in order, the people are unsettled, and the commoners are not well-governed. Plowing and warfare are not harmonious, and this is your fault."* Zi Chan said: *"The minister has his duties, and the ruler has his duties. Each should attend to their own."* Zi Chan withdrew and implemented his governance for five years. The state had no thieves or bandits, no lost goods were picked up from the roads, and no one dared to pluck the fruit from the peach and plum trees shading the streets. Needles and knives left on the road could be retrieved after three days, and for three years, the people did not suffer from hunger.

**Three.**

The Duke of Song fought the Chu at the upper reaches of the Zha Valley. The Song soldiers had already formed their ranks, but the Chu had not yet crossed the river. The Right Marshal, Gou Qiang, urged the Duke forward, saying: *"The Chu forces are numerous while ours are few. I beg Your Majesty to strike them while half of them are still in the river, before they have fully formed their ranks—we will surely defeat them."* The Duke replied: *"I have heard that a gentleman does not inflict repeated wounds, does not seize those with gray hair, does not drive men into perilous positions, does not corner men in narrow places, and does not attack unless the enemy’s ranks are fully formed. Now the Chu have not yet crossed the river, and we strike them—this violates righteousness."* He ordered: *"Let the Chu finish crossing and form their ranks before we sound the drums and advance."* The Right Marshal said: *"Your Majesty does not care for the Song people; their very lives are at risk. You only speak of righteousness."* The Duke said: *"If you do not follow the ranks, I will execute you for disobedience."* The Right Marshal returned to his ranks, but the Chu had already formed theirs. The Duke then sounded the drums, and the Song forces were routed. The Duke was wounded in the thigh and died three days later. This was the calamity of aspiring to uphold righteousness through personal conduct. If a ruler must rely on personally demonstrating virtue and righteousness before the people will obey, then should we not have the ruler himself plow the fields and march in battle formation like wild geese? Only then would the people be willing to plow and fight—yet would the ruler not then be in constant peril? And would the ministers not then be in constant fear?"*

**Four.**

The Duke of Qi toured the Shao Sea. A courier came from the capital to greet him, saying: *"My illness is severe, and I fear Your Majesty will come after me."* The Duke quickly rose and sent another courier. The Duke said: *"Hurry the carriage to the next station, and have the carriage driver, Zhuzi Han Gong, take the reins."* After traveling several hundred steps, the Duke thought the driver was not moving swiftly enough and seized the reins himself. After driving a few hundred more steps, he thought the horses were not advancing quickly enough and abandoned the carriage entirely, running ahead. Because he valued the swiftness of the next station’s carriage and the skill of Zhuzi Han Gong, he believed that his own carriage was inferior. Thus, he preferred the inferior.

**Five.**

The Duke of Wei wished to reward his officials with land and titles. He said to Meng Jiangjun: *"I wish to reward my officials."* Meng Jiangjun said: *"If Your Majesty wishes to reward your officials, why not first try studying the laws of governance?"* The Duke read the laws for over ten scrolls before falling asleep. He said: *"I cannot read these laws."* If one does not personally grasp the instruments of power yet wishes to do what ministers should do, then sleeping is only fitting.

**Six.**

Confucius said: *"For a ruler, it is like a vessel; for the people, it is like water. When the vessel is square, the water is square; when the vessel is round, the water is round."*

The Duke of Zou favored wearing long tassels, and his attendants all followed suit, making them highly prized. The Duke was troubled by this and asked his attendants, who replied: *"Your Majesty favors them, and the common people also wear them widely—thus they are prized."* The Duke then cut his own tassels short and went out, and soon no one in the state wore long tassels. The Duke could not issue a decree to govern the people’s attire and forbid it; instead, he cut his tassels short to set an example for them. This is like first punishing the people to establish authority over them.

**Seven.**

Shu Xiang went hunting, and those with many kills received more rewards, while those with few kills received less. The Duke of Han said to Shenzi: *"The laws are very easy to enforce."* Shenzi replied: *"Laws reward those who achieve results and confer office upon those who demonstrate ability. Now Your Majesty establishes these laws yet listens to the requests of your attendants—this is why they are difficult to enforce."* The Duke said: *"From today onward, I understand how to enforce laws. Why should I listen to you?"* The next day, Shenzi requested a position for his elder brother, and the Duke said: *"This is not what I learned from you. If I listen to your request, would I not ruin my own principles? I will not use your request."* Shenzi withdrew to his residence and begged for punishment.

**Eight.**

The Duke of Jin attacked Yuan, carrying ten days’ rations and setting a ten-day deadline with his officers. When ten days had passed and Yuan still had not fallen, he sounded the retreat and withdrew his forces. A soldier who had escaped from Yuan said, *"Yuan would have surrendered in three days."*

The ministers and attendants advised, *"The people of Yuan have exhausted their strength and food. Your Highness might as well wait."* The Duke replied, *"I set a deadline with my officers, and if I do not keep it, I betray my word. To gain Yuan but lose my trust—I will not do it."* He withdrew his forces.

When the people of Yuan heard this, they said, *"A ruler like this—his trust is unshakable. How could we not submit?"* And so they surrendered. The people of Wei, hearing of this, said, *"A ruler like this—his trust is unshakable. How could we not follow?"* And so they too submitted.

Confucius heard of it and recorded it, saying: *"The conquest of Yuan and the submission of Wei came from trust."*

The Duke of Jin asked Ji Zheng, *"How does one rescue the starving?"*
Ji Zheng replied, *"Trust."*
The Duke asked, *"What is trust?"*
Ji Zheng said, *"Trust in reputation. Trust in reputation means that ministers uphold their duties, neither good nor evil exceeding their bounds, and all affairs proceed without neglect. Trust in actions means not missing the seasons, and the people do not overstep. Trust in virtue means that near and far are encouraged to come, and those distant return."*

Wu Qi, when leaving, met an old friend who invited him to eat. The old friend said, *"Very well, I will return and prepare."* Wu Zi said, *"Wait for me to eat."* The old friend did not come until evening, so Wu Qi waited without eating. The next morning, he sent someone to find him, and only then did they eat together.

The Duke of Wei made an appointment to hunt with the forest warden. The next day, a sudden fierce wind arose, and his attendants urged him not to go. The Duke refused, saying, *"I cannot. If I abandon my appointment because of the wind, I betray my trust. I will not do it."* He drove his chariot forward himself, enduring the wind, and dismissed the forest warden.

Once, Zeng Zi’s wife went to market, and their child followed, weeping. She said, *"Go back. When I return, I will kill a pig for you."* When she returned from the market, Zeng Zi prepared to slaughter the pig, but his wife stopped him, saying, *"I was only joking with the child."* Zeng Zi said, *"The child does not understand jokes. A child has no knowledge and learns from its parents. If parents deceive them, it is teaching them to deceive. If a father deceives his child and the child does not trust its mother, this is not proper instruction."* He then cooked the pig.

King Li of Chu, upon hearing an alarm, had drums set up to summon the people for defense. Drunk from drinking, he struck them in play, and the people were greatly alarmed. He sent someone to say, *"I was drunk and playing with my attendants. I struck them by mistake."* The people then relaxed. After several months, an actual alarm sounded, but the people did not respond. He then established a clear signal, and the people trusted it.

Li Kui warned his two generals: *"Be vigilant! The enemy may strike at any moment—day or night."* He repeated this warning three times, but the enemy never came, so the generals grew careless and no longer trusted Li Kui. After several months, the Qin army attacked, nearly seizing their forces. This was the harm of broken trust.

Another account says: Li Kui fought the Qin, telling the left general, *"Hurry forward! The right general has already advanced."* Then he galloped to the right general, saying, *"The left general has already advanced."* The left and right generals replied, *"We have advanced."* Thus, they all rushed forward. The next year, when they fought the Qin again, the Qin army ambushed them, nearly seizing their forces. This was the harm of broken trust. *(End of the Zuo Tradition.)*

There were litigants who came to dispute, and Zi Chan separated them so that they could not exchange words directly, instead conveying their statements to him and letting him understand their intent.

Hui Si Gong sent someone to falsely accuse a market official, who scolded and detained him. The official then used the matter to extort gold from him, whereupon he released the man.

Hui Si Gong said to the market official: *"At that time, there was a traveler who gave you gold, so I sent him away."*

The market official was greatly terrified, believing Hui Si Gong to be perspicacious.

*(End of the Left Discourses of the External Reservoirs, Chapter 33 of the Han Feizi)*

One. When a person is put to death for a crime, they do not blame the ruler, for the punishment is just. The King of Shàng punished the sitting child of Zi Gāo by amputating his feet. Though the King inflicted the punishment, he had a heart of reluctance, and the punished one bore him gratitude in return and repaid his virtue. When a subject is rewarded for their merits, they do not feel virtuous toward the ruler, for the reward is just. Zhái Huáng, holding the right contract, rode in a carriage. His merits were sufficient to earn honor, so he rode in the carriage without shame. King Xiāng did not understand, for he did not know that great merits deserved great rewards. Thus, Zhāo Mào drove five carriages and wore humble sandals. Mào repelled Qin to the west and stopped Qi to the east—his achievements were great—yet the King only granted him five carriages. Great achievements but meager rewards are like a wealthy man wearing coarse shoes. If a ruler does not exceed his proper authority, and a subject does not falsely claim their abilities, then the subject will become a lost man like Zhōu of Shāoshì.

Two. To rely on power but not on trust, to rely on trust but sometimes not be trustworthy—this is the case. Thus, Dōng Guō Yá discussed Guān Zhòng. The Duke wanted to monopolize the state’s authority, and Yá argued that though Zhòng was loyal, if he were not, he would be a danger. The Duke therefore ordered Zhòng to handle external affairs, while Yí Péng managed internal affairs. To rely on stratagem but not on trust, thus Hún Xuān was not trusted by Wén Gōng. Jìn Wén Gōng, relying on the sincerity of Jī Zhèng, made him the Chief of Yuán and said: “You must never betray me.” Xuān replied: “If a ruler does not govern his subjects with stratagem but relies on their not betraying him, how can he expect them to remain loyal?” Thus, a ruler who possesses stratagem must reward sincerely to exhaust their abilities, and punish severely to forbid their misdeeds. Even if they have mixed methods, they will still gain their advantage. Mixed methods are those that are not steadfast but rather inconsistent. Yáng Hù, the minister of Jiān, showed his subservience. Hù rode in carriages and wore fine clothes, yet when he incurred the King’s displeasure, his three associates seized and expelled him. Hù claimed he had no private motives, but the King responded with matters of private favoritism, saying he had acted against the state’s interests—like a man who plants bitter orange and thorn trees only to suffer their prickles himself. When factions ally and subjects pursue their own desires, the ruler becomes isolated. When the ministers collectively select a subject, and the lower officials do not conspire, then the ruler is enlightened. Yáng Hù intended to be like Zhào Wǔ’s worthy minister and Jié Hú’s impartial one. These two men were selected by the ruler for their fairness, neither avoiding his own son nor his enemies. Hù claimed he would be the same, but his actions revealed otherwise.

Three. If the ruler and minister lose their proper relationship, then King Wén would boast of his own virtue while wearing humble footwear. Though the ruler may have a teacher, the minister should also be cautious; lesser ministers should serve as attendants and advisors. King Wén did not understand this principle, and his attendants were not trustworthy. This was also a loss of worthy ministers. He falsely claimed that all those he honored were his teachers, which was a vain display of his virtues and a cover-up of his mistakes. If one does not alter the proper distinctions between formal court audiences and informal gatherings, then Jì Sūn will remain in perpetual mourning and fall victim to an assassin. A formal court audience should be solemn, but an informal gathering should be relaxed—if one does not differentiate, then Jì Sūn will be harmed in the end.

Four. Where profit is forbidden and forbidding profit, even the divine cannot succeed. If one forbids what should be allowed and allows what should be forbidden, even the divine cannot succeed, let alone the unenlightened. Where praise is given for guilt and blame is cast for merit, even Yáo cannot govern well. If one praises what should be punished and blames what should be rewarded, even Yáo cannot govern well, let alone someone who is not Yáo. To build a gate but not let people enter is like having no gate at all. To grant profit but not let people advance is like not granting profit at all. This is how chaos arises. If gates do not allow entry and profit does not lead to advancement, chaos will surely follow. If the ruler of Qí does not listen to his attendants but instead keenly observes his ministers, he will not need to spend much gold. If the ruler of Wèi does not listen to those who praise, he will not need to waste jade and tortoiseshell. Xīmén Piáo’s request to restore the governance of Yáo was sufficient to prove this. Initially, when governing Yáo, he did not favor his attendants, so the ruler took away his position. Later, when he did favor them, the ruler welcomed and honored him. From this, one can understand that attendants can harm the state. It is like the thief who steals a baby’s fine robe and the associate who steals a noble’s clothes to adorn themselves. The thief’s child does not shame his father for stealing, because the stolen robe is used to flaunt his own status. The associate’s child does not shame his father for his theft, because the stolen clothes are used to honor others. When people flatter and curry favor, their misdeeds are the same. Zǐ Chuò’s attendants drew circles and squares—one could not simultaneously draw both perfectly. This illustrates that relying on attendants’ words cannot yield worthy ministers. To drive away ants and flies with bones and fish respectively is like using gentle words to instruct attendants, which only makes them more obsequious. How can one avoid the worries of Huan Gōng, who listened to his attendants’ demands for officials but had none to give? Or the troubles of Xuān Wáng, who did not discern that his Chief of Horses was stealing fodder but only worried about the horses’ emaciation?

Five. If a subject takes humility and frugality as their conduct, then titles will not suffice to encourage rewards. If favor and glory are without measure, then subjects will encroach and overstep. This is illustrated in Miáo Bīn Huáng’s criticism of Xiàn Bó and Kǒng Zǐ’s discussion of Yàn Yīng. Xiàn Bó, as a minister, did not let his wife wear silk, and Yàn Yīng was the same, so they were not considered great in subduing their inferiors. Thus, Zhòngní praised Guān Zhòng and Sūn Shū Yǒu. Zhòng had three grand feasts, for his excessive extravagance. Yǒu had coarse cakes, for his extreme frugality. Yet their manner of entering and exiting varied, revealing their ministerial status. Yáng Hù’s responses showed his subservience, and Jiān’s ruler’s way of dealing with his ministers was flawed. Hù claimed that in Qi, he had three men who would support him, but when he incurred the ruler’s displeasure, these three men seized and expelled him. Hù claimed he had no private motives, but the ruler responded with matters of private favoritism, accusing him of acting against the state’s interests—like a man planting bitter orange and thorn trees only to suffer their prickles himself. When factions ally and subjects pursue their own desires, the ruler becomes isolated. When the ministers collectively select a subject, and the lower officials do not conspire, then the ruler is enlightened. Yáng Hù intended to be like Zhào Wǔ’s worthy minister and Jié Hú’s impartial one. These two men were selected by the ruler for their fairness, neither avoiding his own son nor his enemies. Hù claimed he would be the same, but his actions revealed otherwise.

The ruler thus regarded him as one who planted bitter orange and thorn trees, not a proper way to instruct the state.

Hù said that those he selected would harm himself, just like the man who planted bitter orange and thorn trees—this is the very opposite of instructing ministers to act impartially. **Sixth Point:**

When the public domain is diminished, the ruler fears upright speech;
when private actions prevail, public merit is scarce.

This is illustrated by **Wénzǐ’s** upright speech and **Wǔzǐ’s** use of the rod.

Wǔzǐ and Wénzǐ, father and son, favored upright speech.
Wǔzǐ declared: *"He who loses upright speech will endanger himself and bring ruin upon his father."*

Zǐ Chǎn gave loyal counsel, but **Zǐ Guó** grew angry.
Guó said in his anger: *"Those who give loyal counsel must surely be estranged from the ministers, and then face grave peril alongside their father."*

Liàng Chē acted according to law, yet **Chéng Hóu** seized his seal.
Chē served as **Zhèng’s** magistrate; his sister broke the law, and he punished her.
**Zhào Hóu** deemed this unkind, and removed him from office.

Guān Zhòng governed with impartiality, yet the people slandered and resented him.
Zhòng did not repay **Fēng Rén’s** kindness but only valued the worthy, so the people resented and slandered him. **First Point:**

When **Kǒngzǐ** was serving as **Wèi’s** minister, his disciple **Zǐ Gāo** was the jailer.
Gāo amputated a man’s feet, and those he punished stood guard at the gate.
A man who bore ill will toward Kǒngzǐ at **Wèi’s** court said: *"Nǐ desires to rebel!"*
Wèi’s ruler sought to arrest Kǒngzǐ, but Kǒngzǐ fled, and all his disciples escaped—except Gāo, who followed him out.
**Zhōu Wēijī** (危) pulled him into a side chamber and helped him flee, though the guards could not catch them.

At midnight, Gāo secretly asked Wēijī: *"I could not violate the ruler’s laws to spare your feet—this was the time for you to repay my vengeance. Why then did you spare me?"*
*"How did I earn this from you?"*

Wēijī replied: *"I severed your feet—it was my fault, and I deserved it. There was no other way."*
*"Yet when the public jail was deciding your fate, the ruler tilted the laws, favoring you over me in speech, and his desire to spare you was intense—but I knew this.
When the judgment was finalized, the ruler was displeased, and his discontent showed in his expression—I saw this and knew it again.
This was not out of private favor toward me, but from his inherent benevolent nature. This is why I took joy in it and honored his virtue."*

**Zhōu** (危) walked with difficulty, hence the saying *"pèng Wēijī"* (朋危).

**Tiánzǐ Fāng** traveled from **Qí to Wèi**, and saw **Zhái Huáng** riding in a grand carriage with light horses.
Huáng had already boarded the carriage, and now he also had swift steeds.
Fāng thought it must be **Wén Hóu**, so he shifted his route to avoid him, believing Huáng was alone.
Alone: meaning without companions.

Fāng asked: *"Why do you ride in such a carriage?"*
Huáng replied: *"The ruler was planning to attack Zhōngshān, and I recommended Zhái Jiǎo, so the plan succeeded.
When he attacked, I recommended Yuè Yáng, and Zhōngshān was taken.
After taking Zhōngshān, he worried about governing it, and I recommended Lǐ Kè, so Zhōngshān was well governed.
Thus, the ruler bestowed this carriage upon me."*
Fāng said: *"The honor for your service is still too slight."*

When **Qín and Hán** attacked Wèi, **Zhāo Mǎo** (昭卯) spoke in the west, and **Qín and Hán** withdrew.
When **Qí and Jīng** attacked Wèi, Mǎo spoke in the east, and **Qí and Jīng** withdrew.
**Wèi Xiāngwáng** rewarded him with the rank of a five-chariot general, feeding his ambition as a general.
Mǎo said: *"Bó Yí was honored as a general and buried beneath Chóuyáng Shān, yet the world says: 'Though Bó Yí was virtuous and renowned for his kindness, to bury him as a general is to leave his limbs uncovered.'
Now I have halted the armies of four states, yet the king grants me only five chariots—this is to acknowledge my merit as if I had gained victory but was given only a single sandal.
Utilitarian gain."*

The man of trade gains profit double that of victory—yet now with meager rewards for great deeds, it is as if the victor were given only a straw sandal.

Confucius said: *"The capable official cultivates virtue; the incompetent official sows resentment. The *liáng* (槩) is the measure of balance; the official is the balance of law. The ruler of a state must not lose this balance."*

Minor-Shi Zhou was a man of ancient integrity, purity, and sincerity. He served as Zhao Xiang Wang’s chief strongman and wrestled with Zhongmu Xuzi, but was not his match. He then spoke to Xiang Wang to replace himself, saying: *"I serve the lord with my strength, but now Xuzi surpasses me in strength. If I do not speak to replace myself, others may speak for me, and I fear this would bring guilt."*

Xiang Wang said: *"Your position is what others desire—why speak of replacing yourself with Xuzi?"*
Zhou replied: *"I serve the lord with my strength, and now Xuzi’s strength exceeds mine. If I do not speak to replace myself, I fear others will speak for me, and I will be held guilty."*

This was a crime of concealing merit.

Another account: Minor-Shi Zhou served as Xiang Wang’s charioteer. Upon reaching Jinyang, he wrestled with the strongman Niuzi but lost. Zhou spoke to the lord: *"The reason Your Majesty employs me as charioteer is for my strength, yet now there is one stronger than me. I wish to recommend him for advancement."*

Secondly: When Qi Huan Gong was about to appoint Guan Zhong, he ordered the ministers: *"I shall appoint Guan Zhong as Zhongfu. Those who approve should enter the gate to the left; those who disapprove, to the right."* Dongguo Ya stood in the center and did not move. The duke said: *"I have ordered that those who approve enter to the left, and those who disapprove to the right. Why do you stand in the center?"*
Ya replied: *"Does Guan Zhong’s wisdom make him capable of planning for the world?"*
The duke said: *"He is capable."*
*"Does his decisiveness make him daring in great matters?"*
The duke said: *"He is daring."*
Ya said: *"Your Majesty knows that Guan Zhong is wise and daring in great matters—why entrust him with the reins of the state? With his ability and Your Majesty’s authority to govern Qi, will it not be perilous?"*
The duke said: *"Well spoken."* He then ordered Yi Peng to govern internally while Guan Zhong managed externally, coordinating their efforts.

When Jin Wen Gong fled, Ji Zheng carried his wine vessel and followed. They lost their way and separated. Ji Zheng, starving, stood by the roadside, too ashamed to eat. When Wen Gong returned to his state and led an army to attack Yuan, capturing and taking it, Wen Gong said: *"He who endured hunger and shame to preserve the wine vessel would never betray me. Thus, I appoint him as the governor of Yuan."*

The minister Hun Xuan heard this and criticized it: *"Because Ji Zheng did not move the wine vessel, you trust he would not betray you—is this not lacking in strategy?"*

Thus, the enlightened ruler does not rely on others not betraying him, but on making betrayal impossible. He does not rely on others not deceiving him, but on making deception impossible.

Yang Hu argued: *"If the lord is virtuous and wise, serve him with sincerity; if he is unworthy, feign loyalty to test him."* Banished from Lu, suspected in Qi, he fled to Zhao, where Zhao Jian Wang welcomed and appointed him as prime minister. The officials said: *"Yang Hu excels at seizing control of states—why appoint him?"*
Jian Wang replied: *"Yang Hu seeks to take; I seek to defend. If I defend well, he cannot gain advantage."* He then seized Wei and used Yang Hu as a shield. Yang Hu dared not act deceitfully and served Jian Wang well, strengthening the state nearly to hegemony.

Ru Ai Gong asked Confucius: *"I have heard that anciently there was Kui with one foot—was this truly so?"*
Confucius replied: *"No, Kui was not one-footed. Kui was one of fierce anger and ill will, and most people disliked him. Nevertheless, he escaped harm because of his sincerity—people said, 'Only this one foot remains.' Kui was not one-footed; he was one in sincerity."*

Ai Gong said: *"If this is so, then sincerity is indeed sufficient."*

Another account: Ai Gong asked Confucius: *"I have heard that Kui had one foot—is this true?"*
Confucius replied: *"Kui was a man—why would he have one foot? He had no other differences, but excelled in music. Yao said, 'Kui is one and sufficient,' and appointed him as the Master of Music. Thus, the superior man says: 'Kui is one and sufficient,' not that he had one foot."*

When Jin Wen Gong fought with Chu at Huangfeng Ridge, his shoe strap came loose, and he tied it himself. His attendants said: *"Should we not have someone do this for you?"*
The duke replied: *"I have heard that the superior lord’s companions are those he fears; the mediocre lord’s companions are those he loves—able to respect and obey him, hence worthy of love. The inferior lord’s companions are those he scorns—light in talent and insolent. Though I am unworthy, the retainers of my ancestors remain, making this difficult."*

San Zhou Wen Wang attacked Chong, reaching Fenghuang Market, where his sock strap came loose, and he tied it himself. Taigong Wang said: *"Why do you do this?"*
The king replied: *"Those above me are my teachers; those at my level are my friends; those below me are my servants."*

Now the ministers are all those of my ancestors, so there is no one I can command.

The Lord Ji of the Zisun clan loved virtuous men, maintaining a dignified demeanor throughout his life. His residence, attire, and bearing were always as if in court. Yet when the Lord Ji grew negligent and made mistakes, he would temporarily abandon his dignity. But he could not sustain this, so his guests came to view him as lax and easy to deceive, and they conspired against him, ultimately killing the Lord Ji.

Thus, the virtuous avoid excess and extremity.

Nan Gong Jingzi asked Yan Zhuju: *"The Lord Ji nurtured Confucius’ disciples—those he received in court attire and seated with him numbered in the tens—yet he met with bandits. Why?"*

Yan Zhuju replied: *"In the past, King Cheng of Zhou kept jesters and dwarfs close to indulge his whims, yet consulted them on state affairs. This allowed him to fulfill his desires across the land. Now the Lord Ji nurtures Confucius’ disciples—those he receives in court attire and seats with him number in the tens—yet consults jesters and dwarfs on state affairs. Hence, he met with bandits."*

Thus it is said: *"It is not about who one associates with, but with whom one consults."*

Confucius was seated before Duke Ai of Lu, who granted him peaches and millet gruel. The duke said: *"Please eat."*

Zhongni first ate the gruel and then the peaches. The attendants all covered their mouths and laughed. The duke said: *"The gruel is not for eating—it is to cleanse the peaches."*

Zhongni replied: *"I understand. Millet is the most honored of the five grains, used as the primary offering when sacrificing to the ancestral kings. Among fruits and vegetables, there are six categories, and peaches are the least honored, unfit to enter the ancestral temple. What I have heard is that the noble use the humble to honor the exalted, not the exalted to honor the humble. Now to use the most honored grain to cleanse the least honored fruit—that is to honor the lower with the higher. I consider this contrary to propriety, so I dare not place it before the ancestral offerings."*

Jian Zhu said to his attendants: *"The carriage cushions are too fine. Though a hat is humble, one must wear it on one’s head; though shoes are noble, one must tread upon them. Now the cushions are so fine—what more noble thing could I tread upon? Shoes are what one treads upon. If the cushions are too fine, then there is no finer shoe to tread upon. When the lower is made too fine, the upper is depleted—if the cushions are fine, then the shoes must also be fine, and if the shoes are fine, the garments must be finer still. If one seeks fineness without end, the ruler above will only have greater expenditures. This is the root of unrighteousness."*

Fei Zhong advised King Zhou: *"King Wen of the West, King Chang, was virtuous. The people rejoiced in him, and the feudal lords attached themselves to him. He cannot be allowed to live—if not killed, he will become a calamity for the Yin dynasty."*

King Zhou said: *"Your words are those of a righteous ruler. How can he be killed?"*

Fei Zhong replied: *"Though a hat may be worn out, it must still be worn on the head; though shoes may be of five colors, they must still be trodden upon. Now King Chang, though a subject, practices virtue and the people turn toward him. Surely he will flourish? If the people do not serve their lord because he is virtuous, he cannot be allowed to live. Moreover, if a lord kills his minister, what greater crime is there?"*

King Zhou said: *"Ren and righteousness are what the ruler uses to exhort the people. Now Chang loves ren and righteousness—how can he be killed?"*

Since his three counsels were not heeded, he perished.

Duke Xuan of Qi asked Kuang Qian: *"Are scholars well-versed in many things?"*

Kuang Qian replied: *"No."*

The duke asked: *"Why not?"*

Kuang Qian answered: *"The well-versed seek to excel, and those who excel must kill the inferior. To kill the inferior is to kill what is honored. Scholars consider this harmful to righteousness, so they do not seek to excel."*

The duke asked again: *"Do scholars hunt?"*

Kuang Qian replied: *"No. Hunting is harming the lower for the sake of the upper—this is harming the ruler from below. Scholars consider this harmful to righteousness, so they do not hunt."*

The duke asked again: *"Do scholars play the zither?"*

Kuang Qian replied: *"No. The zither uses small strings to produce great sounds and large strings to produce small sounds—this reverses the order of great and small, noble and humble. Scholars consider this harmful to righteousness, so they do not play."*

Duke Xuan said: *"Excellent."*

Confucius said: *"Rather than have the people flatter those below, it is better to have them flatter those above. Flattering those below breeds factions, while flattering those above breeds humility and reverence."*

Jù the Tall was a recluse of Qi, and Jiàn the Frail was a recluse of Wei. The rulers of Qi and Wei were unenlightened, unable to govern their realms personally, and thus heeded the words of their attendants. Hence, the two men spent their wealth to seek office.

Ximen Bao served as the magistrate of Yè, maintaining strict integrity and purity, taking no private gain—even the finest hairs of grain were untouched by him. Yet he treated his attendants with extreme simplicity, not currying favor with the ruler’s favorites. His attendants thus conspired against him, slandering him.

After a year, when the annual tribute was presented, the ruler confiscated his seal. Ximen Bao requested it back, saying: *"In the past, I did not know how to govern Yè. Now I have learned. I wish to request the seal again to govern Yè. If I fail, I beg to be punished with the axe and the cangue."*

Wen Hou, unable to bear it, returned the seal. Ximen Bao then heavily taxed the people and curried favor with the ruler’s favorites. After another year, when the tribute was presented, Wen Hou welcomed him and bestowed honors. Ximen Bao replied: *"Last year, when I governed Yè for you, you took my seal. Now I have governed for your favorites, and you honor me. I cannot govern anymore."* He then returned the seal and departed.

Wen Hou refused to accept it, saying: *"I did not know you before, but now I do. I wish you to exert yourself for me."* He did not accept the seal Ximen Bao returned.

In Qi, a son of a dog-thief and a son of a crippled man played together and boasted. The thief’s son said: *"My father’s fur cloak still has its tail."* Meaning his father’s cloak still had the stolen dog’s tail attached.

The crippled man’s son said: *"My father never loses his trousers in winter."* For a man with a missing foot, trousers would not be worn, so he suffered no loss even in the coldest season.

Zi Chuo said: *"No one can draw a square with their left hand and a circle with their right. Using meat to drive away ants only makes them multiply; using fish to drive away flies only attracts more."*

Duke Huan of Qi said to Guan Zhong: *"There are few officials, yet many demands. I am troubled by this."*

Guan Zhong replied: *"My lord, do not heed the petitions of your attendants. Grant offices only to those who demonstrate competence and bestow rewards according to merit, then no one will dare demand office—what cause for worry would my lord have?"*

Han Xuanzǐ said: *"My horses and mules have plenty of grain and beans, yet they remain emaciated. I am troubled by this."* Zhou Shi responded: *"If you feed them all the grain you have, even if they do not grow fat, they will not starve. If you claim to give them much but actually provide little, even if they do not starve, they will not grow fat either. Since you do not discern their true condition and yet sit in worry, how can your horses grow fat?"*

Duke Huan asked Guan Zhong about appointing officials. Guan Zhong said: *"In discerning legal arguments and maintaining purity in financial matters, and in understanding human nature, I am not as skilled as Xian Shang. I recommend appointing him as the Grand Judge. In conducting oneself with solemn decorum and treating guests with proper rites, I am not as capable as Xi Peng. I recommend appointing him as the Grand Host. In cultivating wasteland and managing estates—where 'ren' means the taxable yield—no one is better than Ning Wu. I recommend appointing him as the Grand Steward of Agriculture. In forming battle arrays and making soldiers regard death as returning home, no one surpasses Gongzi Chengfu. I recommend appointing him as the Grand Marshal. In speaking boldly and offering direct counsel, no one equals Dongguo Ya. I recommend appointing him as the Counselor. These five men are sufficient to govern Qi. If you wish to achieve hegemony, I am here."*

Meng Xianbo served as minister of Lu, yet his hall floor grew with wild herbs, thorns overgrew his gate, his meals lacked variety, he sat on a single mat, had no concubines in silk, kept no grain for horses, and traveled without a carriage. Chunyang heard of this and told Miao Feihuang, who criticized him: *"This is using your lord’s rank and emoluments to curry favor with the people."* Later, when Meng Xianbo was elevated to the rank of upper minister, Chunyang went to congratulate him. At the gate, the horses were unfed, and Chunyang asked: *"Why do you have only one horse and one carriage?"* Meng Xianbo replied: *"I observe that the people still bear signs of hunger, so I do not feed my horses. Many elderly walk on foot, so I do not keep a second carriage."* Chunyang said: *"I came first to congratulate you on your promotion, but now I congratulate you on your frugality."* As he left, he told Miao Feihuang: *"I join you in congratulating Meng Xianbo on his frugality."* Miaozi said: *"What is there to congratulate? Rank, emoluments, and insignia distinguish merit and separate the worthy from the unworthy. According to the laws of Jin, an upper great officer is entitled to two carriages and two chariots, a middle great officer to two carriages and one chariot, and a lower great officer to a single chariot—this clarifies the hierarchy. Moreover, ministers must oversee military affairs, so they must maintain chariots and horses, align soldiers and cavalry, to prepare for warfare. In times of crisis, this prepares for the unexpected; in times of peace, it supplies court affairs. Now you disrupt the governance of Jin, deplete preparations for emergencies, and achieve frugality only to purify your private reputation. Is Meng Xianbo’s frugality commendable? His words, though fitting for punishment, are praiseworthy. What is there to congratulate?"*

Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi and said: *"I am honored, yet I am poor."* Duke Huan said: *"Let me grant you three estates."* Guan Zhong replied: *"Now I am wealthy, yet I am still lowly."* The duke then seated him above the high and national ministers. Guan Zhong said: *"Now I am exalted, yet I am still distant."* The duke then established him as Zhongfu. Confucius heard of this and criticized: *"His extravagance and arrogance oppress the sovereign."*

When Guan Zhong’s father passed away, he returned in a carriage with a red canopy and green robes, set up drums for his return, and played music upon arriving home. His courtyard displayed a tripod, and his household had three estates. Confucius said: *"What a great minister! His extravagance oppresses the sovereign."*

Sun Shu’ao served as minister of Chu, riding in a simple cart, with a mare, coarse rice cakes, vegetable soup, dried fish, a winter lambskin robe, and summer hemp clothing, his face bearing signs of hunger. Confucius said: *"What a great minister! His frugality oppresses the people."*

Yang Hu fled Qi for Zhao. The ruler asked: *"I have heard you are skilled at nurturing talent."* Yang Hu replied: *"When I lived in Lu, I recommended three men, all of whom became prime ministers. When I incurred guilt in Lu, they all searched for me. In Qi, I recommended three men: one gained proximity to the king, one became a county magistrate, and one became a border official. When I was accused in Qi, the one near the king did not see me, the county magistrate arrested me in chains, and the border official pursued me to the border—though he did not catch me, he stopped there."* Yang Hu said: *"I am not skilled at nurturing talent."* The ruler smiled and said: *"He who plants citrus and orange trees enjoys their sweetness and fragrance. He who plants bitter orange and thorny plants reaps what harms others. Thus, the virtuous man is cautious about whom he nurtures."*

When the magistrate of Zhongmu was vacant, Duke Ping of Jin asked Zhao Wu: *"Zhongmu is the pivot of the three states—Zhao, Qi, and Yan—and the shoulder and hip of Handan. I wish to find a capable magistrate. Who should I appoint?"* Zhao Wu replied: *"Xing Bozi is suitable."* The duke asked: *"Is he not your enemy?"* Zhao Wu said: *"Personal enmity does not enter the public gate."* The duke asked again: *"Who should be appointed magistrate of Zhongfu?"* Zhao Wu replied: *"My son is suitable."* Thus it is said: *"In recommending outsiders, one does not avoid enemies; in recommending family, one does not avoid one’s own."*

Zhao Wu recommended forty-six men. When he died, each took their proper guest position, demonstrating such impartial virtue.

Duke Ping asked Chunyang: *"Which minister is most virtuous?"* Chunyang replied: *"Zhao Wu."* The duke said: *"You favor your teacher."* Chunyang, being Zhao Wu’s subordinate, stood as if his clothes were too heavy, spoke as if his words were forced, yet the men he recommended numbered in the dozens, all fulfilling his intentions. The state greatly relied on him, yet when Zhao Wu’s descendants fell into misfortune, they did not seek refuge with the duke. Thus, I dare say he was virtuous.

Jie Hu recommended his enemy to the ruler as minister, believing he might be pardoned. The enemy, upon appointment, went to pay his respects, thanking Jie Hu for his recommendation.

Jie Hu then drew his bow, sent an arrow, and struck him, saying: *"I recommended you to the ruler, but the ruler did so because he believed you could fulfill the role. As for my private grudge against you, I did not bring it before the ruler to shield you from my enmity. Thus, private grudges do not enter the ruler’s hall."*

Jie Hu recommended Xing Bo Liu as the governor of Shang Party. Liu went to thank him, saying: *"You pardoned my offense; how dare I not bow twice in gratitude?"* Jie Hu replied: *"I recommended you because it was the ruler’s will, but my grudge against you is private. You have gone now, yet my grudge against you remains as before."*

A man from Zheng County sold a piglet. When asked its price, he said: *"The Dao/Way is that when evening comes, I will have leisure to tell you."*

Fan Wenzi loved straightforward speech, so Jie Hu struck him with a staff, saying: *"Those who speak bluntly are not tolerated by others. If they are not tolerated, they endanger their own lives—not just their own lives, but also their fathers’."* Fan Wenzi was the son of Zi Guo.

Zi Guo was loyal to the Duke of Zheng, but Zi Guo’s father, Zi Guo, warned him: *"He who stands apart from other ministers and alone remains loyal to the ruler—if the ruler is virtuous and wise, he may listen to you; if not, he will not. Whether he listens or not is uncertain, yet you have already distanced yourself from the other ministers. Distanced from the other ministers, you will surely endanger your own life—not just your own life, but also your father’s."* #1

Liang Che Xin, as the magistrate of Ye, had his sister visit him. When evening came and the gate closed, she climbed over the city wall to enter, and Liang Che Xin had her feet cut off. #2

Zhao Cheng Hou believed this showed no mercy, so he took away his seal and stripped him of his magistracy. #3

When Guanzhong was bound and taken from Lu to Qi, he grew hungry and thirsty along the way. Passing by the sealed-off territory of Jiwu, he begged for food from the Jiwu official. The official knelt and fed him with great respect, then secretly said to Guanzhong: *"If fortune favors you and you reach Qi alive and are employed, how will you repay me?"* Guanzhong replied: *"If you speak as you do, I will be used by the ruler in a virtuous way. If I can make my labor be fairly rewarded, how will I repay you?"* The official held a grudge against him. #4

---
#1 *Grudge/Resentment* (怨) against the ruler’s judgment.
#2 *Climbed over the wall* (踰郭) to enter secretly.
#3 *Stripped him of his magistracy* (兔之令) – here, "兔" (tù) is used in the sense of "to remove" or "deprive."
#4 *Sealed-off territory* (绮乌封人) – refers to the Jiwu official overseeing a restricted region.

The ruler’s means of governing his ministers are threefold:

1. **When authority is insufficient to transform them, remove them.**
   The blind musician **Shī Guāng’s** reply and **Yàn Zǐ’s** counsel both demonstrate how easy it is to wield authority yet how difficult it is to uphold the **Dao**. This is like chasing wild beasts—one has not yet addressed the root of the harm. The harm that can be removed lies in **Zǐ Xià’s** interpretation of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.
   A master of authority cuts off evil in its budding stage. Thus, **Jì Sūn** yielded to **Confucius** in seizing the moment of influence, and how much more so should **Guān Zhòng** act in service to the ruler? Therefore, **Tàigōng Wàng** slew the mad **Gòng**, yet **Zāng Gěi** did not ride the swift steed. **Sì Gōng** understood this, hence his chariot hunt. **Xuē Gōng** knew it, hence his gambling with the two musicians. These all understood the reversal of harmony and discord, thus the enlightened ruler’s governance lies in nurturing them.

2. **The sovereign is the pivotal axis of profit and harm, with many arrows aimed at him, making him vulnerable.**
   Thus, when his likes and dislikes are revealed, his ministers take advantage, and the sovereign is deceived. When words are freely exchanged, ministers find it hard to speak truthfully, and the sovereign loses his discernment. This is illustrated in **Shēn Bù’s** *Six Cautions* and **Táng Yì’s** analogy of hunting.
   The danger lies in the annual requests of the **Guó Nián** and the **Xuān Wáng’s** sighs. Clarity comes from **Jìng Guō Shì’s** offering of ten jade ear pendants and the whispers of **Xī Shǒu** and **Gān Mào** through their secret tunnels. **Táng Xuē Gōng** knew the art, hence his inquiry about the jade cup. **Zhāo Hòu** mastered it, hence his solitary audience. The sovereign’s path lies in **Shēn Bù’s** exhortation to decisive judgment.

3. **There are reasons why strategies fail.**

「If you do not kill the dogs, the wine will turn sour.
For a state also has dogs—indeed, its ministers are all like field mice gnawing at its foundations.
A sovereign without the second punishment of Yao or the response of King Zhuang to his son will still face the fate of the old woman’s decision in Cai—
those who prize virtue cannot first measure it by the method of teaching songs, as Wu Qi abandoned his beloved wife, and Duke Wen severed the head of Dian Ji—all defying natural sentiment.
Thus, those who can make men pluck out their own boils must first be those who endure their own pain.

**Chapter One of the Right Canon:**
If rewards and praise do not inspire, and punishments and slander do not deter,
and these four measures are applied without change—then remove them.

When Duke Jing of Qi visited Jin, he drank with Duke Ping.
The blind musician Shi Kuang sat beside him.
At the beginning of the feast, Duke Jing asked Shi Kuang of governance:
*"Master Shi, how shall I instruct me?"*
Shi Kuang replied: *"Your Highness must only be benevolent to the people."*

Mid-feast, as the wine flowed, and he prepared to leave, Duke Jing asked again:
*"Master Shi, how shall I instruct me?"*
*"Your Highness must only be benevolent to the people."*

Duke Jing returned to his lodging, and Shi Kuang saw him off, asking once more:
*"Your Highness must only be benevolent to the people."*

Duke Jing returned to his state, pondering, still half-drunk, and grasped Shi Kuang’s meaning.
Prince Wei and Prince Xia—Duke Jing’s two younger brothers—were deeply beloved by the Qi people.
Their households were wealthy and noble, and the people favored them, rivaling the royal court.
These were threats to my position!
Now, those who say I must be benevolent to the people—do they mean I must compete with my brothers for the people’s favor?

Thus, upon his return, he opened the granaries and taxed the wealthy to aid the poor,
dispersed surplus treasury funds to orphans and widows,
emptied the storehouses of stored grain and the treasury of surplus wealth,
and sent unmarried palace women into marriage.
He set a stipend of seventy bushels of rice for the aged,
and sold his virtue and benevolence to the people—already competing with my brothers.

Two years passed, and the two princes fled.
Prince Xia escaped to Chu, Prince Wei to Jin.

Duke Jing strolled with Yan Zi at Shao Hai, ascending the Piao Qin terrace and gazing back at his realm:
*"Ah, how grand and majestic it is! How splendid and imposing!
Who in future generations will possess such a state?"*

Yan Zi replied: *"Perhaps the Tian Cheng family?"*

Duke Jing said: *"This is my state, yet you say the Tian Cheng family possesses it—why?"*

Yan Zi answered:
*"The Tian Cheng family deeply wins the people’s hearts.
To those above, they petition for titles and stipends, granting them to high ministers.
To those below, they lend large measures of grain and salt, but collect in smaller ones.
When slaughtering an ox, they take only one bowl of meat, feeding the rest to their attendants.
At year’s end, they take only two bolts of cloth for themselves, clothing the rest to their followers.
Thus, timber prices do not rise in the mountains,
and fish, salt, turtles, and shellfish from the marshes are not more costly than those from the sea.
Your Highness imposes heavy taxes, while the Tian Cheng family bestows lavish gifts.
During Qi’s great famine, starving corpses lined the roads beyond count—
yet no father and son who dragged themselves to Tian Cheng’s gates failed to survive.
Thus, the people of Zhou and Qin sang:
*‘Oh, cease your toil! Wrap yourselves in warmth!
Go and return to Tian Chengzi!’
As the poem says:
*‘Though you lack virtue, let us sing and dance for you.’*
Now, the Tian Cheng family’s virtue has made the people sing and dance in devotion—
thus, their hearts belong to them.
Hence, I say: Perhaps the Tian Cheng family?"*

Duke Jing wept, saying: *"Is this not tragic?
I have this state, yet the Tian Cheng family possesses it.
What shall I do now?"*

Yan Zi replied: *"Your Highness, why worry?
If you wish to take it from them, then honor the virtuous and distance the unworthy,
settle disorder and ease punishments,
relieve the greedy and indigent, and care for orphans and widows,
extend kindness and provide for those in need—
then the people will return to you.
Even if there were ten Tian Cheng families, what could they do to you?"*

Some say: *"Duke Jing did not know how to wield power,
and Shi Kuang and Yan Zi did not know how to remove threats.*
The hunter relies on the comfort of his carriage and the speed of six horses,
with Wang Liang guiding the reins—
then his body labors not, yet he easily overtakes light game.
But if he abandons the carriage’s advantage, discards the six horses and Wang Liang’s skill,
and chases the beast on foot—
even Lou Ji’s swiftness could not catch it.
Relying on fine horses and sturdy chariots ensures abundant game.
The state is the sovereign’s chariot, and power is his horses.
To govern without wielding power to restrain ministers who usurp punishments or hoard affection,
and instead compete with the world in virtue—
this is like abandoning the chariot and running on foot.
Thus, it is said:
Duke Jing was a sovereign who did not know how to wield power,
while Shi Kuang and Yan Zi were ministers who did not know how to remove threats."*

Zi Xia said:
*"The Spring and Autumn Annals record ten instances of ministers killing their sovereigns and sons killing their fathers—
none were the result of a single day’s accumulation, but came gradually.
All deceivers act for long before their schemes take root,
and when their roots take hold, their power grows,
and when their power grows, they can kill.
Thus, enlightened rulers cut them off early.
Now, Tian Chang’s rebellion has already shown signs,
yet Your Highness does not punish him.
Yan Zi did not urge his sovereign to restrain encroaching ministers,
but instead had him practice benevolence—
thus, Duke Jian received his calamity.
Hence, Zi Xia said:
*The wise wielders of power cut off deceit in its budding stage."*

When Ji Sun governed Lu, Zi Lu was magistrate of Hei.
Lu mobilized the people in early spring to dig the Chang Gou canal.
At that time, Zi Lu used his private grain ration to make porridge,
and invited the laborers to eat at Wu Fu’s crossroads.
Confucius heard of this and sent Zi Gong to overturn the porridge and smash the bowls, saying:
*"The ruler of Lu has his people—why do you feed them?"*

Zi Lu, furious, rolled up his sleeves and entered to confront him:
*"Does the Master blame me for practicing benevolence and righteousness?"*

「What I learned from the Master was benevolence and righteousness—
benevolence and righteousness are the means to share all that is under heaven with the people and to align their interests with those of the world.
Now, you use my private grain ration to feed the people—how can this be justified?
Confucius replied:
*"Your nature is wild, and I know you well.
You have merely not yet reached it, but this is your fundamental lack of understanding of ritual propriety.
By feeding them, you claim to love them—
yet ritual is the measure by which the Son of Heaven loves all under heaven,
the feudal lords love their domains,
the great ministers love their offices,
and the scholars love their families.
To exceed what one ought to love is called encroachment.
Now, the ruler of Lu has his people, yet you presume to love them—
this is your encroachment, is it not false?"*

Before he finished speaking,
Ji Sun’s envoy arrived and reproached him:
*"Ji Sun mobilized the people and employed them,
while you, Master, had your disciple command the laborers to feed them—
do you intend to deprive Ji Sun’s people of their labor?"*

Confucius then drove his carriage and left Lu.

Though Confucius was virtuous,
Ji Sun was not the ruler of Lu—
yet with the station of a subject,
he assumed the authority of a sovereign,
preemptively restraining what had not yet taken form,
so that Zi Lu could not enact his private benevolence
and harm could not arise.
How much more so for a sovereign!

With Duke Jing’s power to restrain Tian Chang’s encroachment,
there would surely be no fear of hostage-taking or regicide.

When Tai Gong Wang sealed his eastern domain in Qi,
there was a recluse by the sea named Kuang Yu (狂矞) and Hua Shi (華士),
two brothers who declared:
*"We do not serve the Son of Heaven,
nor befriend the feudal lords.
We till the land and eat its yield,
dig wells and drink their water—
we ask nothing of others.
We have no title of nobility,
no lord’s stipend,
and we do not seek office but labor instead."*

Tai Gong Wang arrived at Ying Qiu (營丘),
ordered his officials to seize and execute them,
and made their heads the first offering.

When Zhou Gong Dan heard of this from Lu,
he urgently dispatched a messenger to inquire:
*"These two brothers are virtuous men.
Today, you feast the nation and execute the virtuous—why is this?"*

Tai Gong Wang replied:
*"These two brothers declared:
'We do not serve the Son of Heaven,
nor befriend the feudal lords.
We till the land and eat its yield,
dig wells and drink their water—
we ask nothing of others.
We have no title of nobility,
no lord’s stipend,
and we do not seek office but labor instead.'

Yet, those who do not serve the Son of Heaven
are those who cannot be made to submit to him.
Those who do not befriend the feudal lords
are those who cannot be directed by them.
To till the land and eat its yield,
dig wells and drink their water—
asking nothing of others—
is to say that they cannot be swayed by rewards or punishments.

Now, if they cannot be made to submit,
to whom shall I entrust the rule of my domain?
If they do not bear arms yet seek glory,
nor till the fields yet claim renown,
they are not the means by which a state can be instructed.

Take this horse here—
though it resembles a fine steed,
when driven it does not advance,
when turned back it does not straighten,
when urged left it does not turn left,
when urged right it does not turn right—
even the lowly commoner would not trust his feet to it.
The commoner entrusts his feet to such a steed
because it can chase gains and ward off dangers.
But if it cannot be ridden to these ends,
even the lowly commoner would not trust his feet to it.

You, like the horse that resembles a deer,
are worth a thousand gold pieces in appearance,
yet though a thousand-gold horse may exist,
no deer is worth even one gold piece in service.
The horse serves humanity,
while the deer does not.

Now, as for Ru Er (如耳),
he is a minister of a great state,
yet his heart is not with Wei—
though he be eloquent and wise,
he cannot be employed by me.
Thus, I do not appoint him."

When Xue Gong (薛公) served as minister to Duke Zhao of Wei,
there were two favored attendants named Yang Hu (陽胡) and Pan (潘),
who were held in high regard by the king,
yet not by Xue Gong, who was troubled by this.

Thus, he summoned them to play a game of *博* (a board game),
gave them a hundred gold pieces,
and ordered them to play with their brothers.
Soon, he increased the stakes to two hundred gold pieces.

While the game was in progress,
a messenger announced that the son of Ji (季) was at the gate.
The duke angrily stroked his weapons
and instructed the messenger:
*"Kill him.
I have heard that Ji’s son does not serve me."*

Before the order was carried out,
Ji Yu (季羽) was at his side and said:
*"No, that is not correct.
I have heard that Ji serves you well,
though his person may be unheard of."*

The duke then halted the execution
and instead honored the guest with great ceremony:
*"Earlier, I heard that Ji’s son did not serve me,
so I intended to kill him.
But now, if he truly serves me,
how could I forget Ji?"*

He then ordered the granary to present a thousand *dou* (石) of grain,
the treasury to offer five hundred gold pieces,
the private stables to give two fine steeds and two sturdy chariots,
and further commanded Yan Jiang (奄) to lead twenty beautiful concubines
to bestow upon Ji as well.

The **Lè Zǐ** then addressed his companions, saying:
*"Those who serve the lord must benefit him,
while those who do not serve him must be harmed.
What do we fear in not serving him?"*
Thus, they eagerly urged one another and acted accordingly.

The **Xué Gōng** wielded the power of a subject
but employed the strategies of a sovereign,
yet still could not escape harm—
how much less could one who erred against the sovereign?

*"A tamed crow, when its lower jaw is severed,
must rely on others for food—
how could it remain tame?"*
So too, an enlightened ruler governs his ministers:
he ensures they cannot but profit from the lord’s rewards,
nor escape the title of serving above.
How could they refuse?

**Shēn Zǐ** said:
*"When the lord’s wisdom is evident,
men prepare against him.
When his wisdom is unclear,
men are confused by him.
When his knowledge is apparent,
men are deceived by him;
when his knowledge is hidden,
men conceal themselves from him.
When his desires are absent,
men observe him;
when his desires are present,
men bait him.
Thus it is said:
'I know not how to govern him—
only *wuwei* can guide him.'"*

**Shēn Zǐ** further said:
*"Speak with caution,
and men will know you.
Act with caution,
and men will follow you.
If you reveal your knowledge,
men will conceal themselves from you;
if you hide your knowledge,
men will test you.
If you are wise,
men will praise you;
if you are ignorant,
men will act freely.
Thus it is said:
'Only *wuwei* can guide him.'"*

**Tián Zǐ Fāng** asked **Táng Yì Jū** about hunting:
*"What must one be cautious of?"*
He replied:
*"The crow surveys you with hundreds of eyes,
while you observe it with two—
be diligent in guarding your provisions."*
**Tián Zǐ Fāng** said:
*"Well said!
You add to hunting—
I add to ruling a state."*

The **Zhèng Lǎngzhě**, hearing this, remarked:
*"Tián Zǐ Fāng knows how to seek provisions,
but has not yet found the means to do so.
The way of *xūwú-wújiàn* is discerning."*

**Qí Xuān Wáng** asked **Táng Yì Zǐ** about hunting:
*"What is most precious in hunting?"*
**Táng Yì Zǐ** replied:
*"Diligence in guarding provisions."*
The king asked:
*"What does 'diligence in guarding provisions' mean?"*
He answered:
*"The crow surveys you with tens of eyes,
while you observe it with two—
how could you not be diligent in guarding provisions?"*
Thus, it is said:
*"It lies in guarding the *kāng*."*

The king said:
*"Then, how should one rule the world to achieve this?"*
*"Now, the sovereign surveys a single state with two eyes,
while the state surveys the sovereign with ten thousand eyes—
how then can he guard his own provisions?"*
He replied:
*"The Zhèng Lǎngzhě once said:
*'The way of *xūjìng-wúwéi-wújiàn* may suffice for this.'"*

The ram of the state was heavy in the favor of the Lord of Zheng, and hearing of the Lord’s displeasure, he attended a banquet and first said to the Lord:
*"Your servant, alas, has committed a fault. If the Lord would deign to inform me, I would amend it, and thus avoid the death penalty."*

A guest advised King Xuan of Qin, and the king, pleased, sighed deeply. His attendants, drawing the king’s attention to the guest, said, *"First inform the guest of this virtue."* (Thus the king did.)

When Jinguo Jun served as prime minister of Qi, the queen died, and the king did not yet know whom to appoint. He therefore presented jade ear pendants to discern his choice.

Another account says:
When Xue Gong served as prime minister of Qi, the wife of King Wei of Qi died, and among her ten sons, all were favored by the king. Xue Gong wished to know whom the king intended to establish as the new wife, so he requested permission to place one of them as such.

If the king consented, then the proposal would succeed and be honored in the appointment of the wife. If the king refused, then the proposal would fail and be slighted in the appointment of the wife. Desiring to first ascertain the king’s intended choice to encourage him to appoint her, he thus made ten jade ear pendants, beautifying one among them, and presented them to the king. The king distributed them among the ten sons, and the next day, when they were seated, he observed which pendant was most prized and urged the king to appoint that son’s mother as the new wife.

Gan Mao served as prime minister to King Hui of Qin, who favored Gongsun Yan and, in private, said to him: *"I intend to appoint you as my prime minister."* Gan Mao’s attendant, Dao Xue, overheard this and reported it to Gan Mao.

Gan Mao entered to see the king and said: *"The king has found an able prime minister—I dare to congratulate him with two bows."* The king said: *"I have entrusted the state to you; how could I find another able prime minister?"* Gan Mao replied: *"You intend to appoint Xi Shou."* The king asked: *"How did you hear this?"* Gan Mao answered: *"Xi Shou told me."* The king, angered that Xi Shou had revealed the matter, banished him.

Another account says:
Xi Shou was a great general in the world, a subject of the King of Liang. The King of Qin wished to obtain him and govern the world with him, but Xi Shou said: *"Yan is my lord’s subject; I dare not abandon my lord’s state."* After a year, Xi Shou incurred guilt before the King of Liang and fled to Qin, where the king greatly favored him.

Zhuli Ji was a general of Qin, fearing that Xi Shou would replace him, he dug a hole near where the king often spoke privately. Soon, the king indeed conferred with Xi Shou, saying: *"I wish to attack Han; what do you think?"* Xi Shou replied: *"Autumn would be the time."* The king said: *"I entrust my state to you; you must not divulge this."* Xi Shou turned and bowed twice, saying: *"I accept the command."* Thus, Zhuli Ji also listened through the hole, and the court officials all said: *"The army will march in autumn, attacking Han, with Xi Shou as general."* On that very day, the court officials all knew it. On that very day, all within the borders knew it.

The king summoned Zhuli Ji and said: *"Why are you in such a hurry? What did you hear?"*
Zhuli Ji replied: *"It seemed to be Xi Shou."*

The king said: *"I have spoken with no one but Xi Shou. What is Xi Shou like?"*
Zhuli Ji replied: *"Xi Shou is a wandering scholar, newly arrived after incurring guilt. His heart is solitary, and his words were spoken to invite criticism from the crowd."*

The king said: *"Indeed."* He sent someone to summon Xi Shou, but he had already fled to the territories of other lords.

**Tangxi Gong** said to Duke Zhao of Liang: *"If there were a jade cup worth a thousand gold pieces, but it had no bottom, could it hold water?"*
Duke Zhao replied: *"No."*

*"If there were a clay vessel that did not leak, could it hold wine?"*
Duke Zhao replied: *"Yes."*

Tangxi Gong said: *"Clay vessels are the most humble, yet if they do not leak, they can hold wine. Even if there were a jade cup worth a thousand gold pieces, the most noble yet without a bottom, it could not hold water if it leaked. Then, who would pour the liquid for you?"*

*"If a ruler leaks the words of his ministers, it is like a jade cup without a bottom. Even if he possesses sage wisdom, he cannot fully apply it, for it leaks. Thus, the state suffers."*

Duke Zhao said: *"Indeed."* After hearing Tangxi Gong’s words, Duke Zhao thereafter, whenever he wished to announce a great matter to the world, would never fail to lie alone in fear that his dreams would reveal his plans and inform others of his intentions.

---

One day, Tangxi Gong saw Duke Zhao and said: *"If there were a white jade cup without a bottom, and a clay cup with a bottom, and you were thirsty, which would you drink from?"*
Duke Zhao replied: *"From the clay cup."*

Tangxi Gong said: *"The white jade cup is beautiful, yet you do not drink from it—is it because it lacks a bottom?"*
Duke Zhao replied: *"Indeed."*

Tangxi Gong said: *"If a ruler leaks the words of his ministers, it is like a white jade cup without a bottom."* Whenever Tangxi Gong visited, Duke Zhao would lie alone in bed, fearing that his dreams would reveal secrets to his wives and concubines.

**Shen Zi** said: *"One who sees alone is called discerning, one who listens alone is called perceptive. Only those who can make decisions alone can truly rule the world."*

There was a wine seller in Song whose measures were perfectly even, who treated guests with great care, whose wine was excellent, and whose banner hung high. Yet his wine did not sell, and it turned sour. People wondered why, so they asked those who knew, including the elder Yang Qian. Qian said: *"Is your dog fierce?"*

*"If the dog is fierce, why does the wine not sell?"*
*"Because people fear it."*

Some sent their young attendants with money and carrying jugs to purchase from the wine seller, but the dog would bark and bite them. This was why the wine turned sour and did not sell.

*"A state also has its dogs. A virtuous scholar carries his wisdom and seeks to enlighten the ruler of a great realm, but powerful ministers act like fierce dogs, barking and biting him away. This is why the ruler’s wisdom is obstructed, and virtuous scholars are not employed."*

Thus, Duke Huan of Qi asked Guan Sheng: *"What is the greatest affliction in ruling a state?"*
Guan Sheng replied: *"The most grievous affliction is the temple mice."*

Duke Huan asked: *"Why are temple mice such a grievous affliction?"*
Guan Sheng replied: *"Have you seen the temple trees?"*
*"Trees are painted and erected in the temple, and mice burrow between the layers, digging holes to shelter themselves. If you fumigate, they fear the fire will consume the wood; if you flood, they fear the paint will crack. This is why temple mice are not easily eliminated."*

*"Now, the ministers at a ruler’s side—when they go out, they wield their influence to profit from the people; when they return, they conspire to conceal their misdeeds from the ruler. They spy on the ruler’s intentions and report them to outsiders, while both external and internal factions vie for power. The officials and attendants all consider this wealth. If the ruler does not execute them, the laws are disordered; if he executes them, the ruler is endangered. They hold power and profit from it—these are also the temple mice of the state."*

*"Thus, when ministers monopolize authority and issue arbitrary prohibitions, those who benefit themselves are rewarded, while those who do not are harmed. This is also the fierce dog."*

*"If the ministers act as fierce dogs to bite away the virtuous scholars, and those at the ruler’s side act as temple mice to obstruct his wisdom, then his plans cannot succeed. The ruler will not be aware, and in such a case, how can the ruler avoid stagnation, and how can the state avoid ruin?"*

---

One day, the wine seller of Song was a man of the **Zhuang clan**, whose wine was always excellent. Yet someone sent a servant to purchase wine from him, but the dog bit the servant, so the servant dared not return. Instead, he bought wine from another family.

When asked: *"Why did you not purchase wine from the Zhuang clan?"*
The servant replied: *"Today, the Zhuang clan’s wine is sour."*

Thus it was said: *"Do not kill the dog, or the wine will turn sour."*

Duke Huan of Qi asked **Guan Zhong**: *"What is the greatest affliction in ruling a state?"*
Guan Zhong replied: *"The most grievous affliction is the temple mice."*

*"Temple trees are painted and erected, and mice take shelter within the layers. If you fumigate, the wood burns; if you flood, the paint cracks. This is why temple mice are so troublesome."*

*"Now, the ministers at a ruler’s side—when they go out, they wield their influence to profit from the people; when they return, they conspire to conceal their misdeeds from the ruler, using flattery and slander to deceive him. If the ruler does not execute them, the laws are disordered; if he executes them, the ruler is endangered. They hold power and profit from it—these are also the temple mice of the state."*

*"Thus, when ministers monopolize authority and issue arbitrary prohibitions, those who benefit themselves are rewarded, while those who do not are harmed. This is also the fierce dog."*

*"If those at the ruler’s side act as temple mice and those in power act as fierce dogs, then his wisdom cannot prevail."*

Emperor Yao wished to pass the realm to Shun, but **Gun** advised: *"This is unauspicious! Who would pass the realm to a commoner?"*
Yao did not heed him, raised an army, and executed Gun at the outskirts of Yushan.

**Gonggong** also advised: *"Who would pass the realm to a commoner?"*
Yao did not heed him, and again raised an army to execute Gonggong in the city of You.

Thus, no one dared to speak against passing the realm to Shun.

**Zhongni** (Confucius) heard of this and said: *"Yao’s wisdom and Shun’s virtue were not difficult to achieve. The difficulty lay in this: when one reached the point of executing those who gave counsel, he would still pass the realm to Shun. This was the true difficulty."*

---

*"Not to let one’s doubts undermine one’s discernment is difficult."*

Duke Zhao of Liang established a law called the **Mao Men Decree**: *"If any minister, great officer, or prince enters court and the horses’ hoofs trample the steps, the court officials shall behead the carriage and execute the driver."*

---

*"Thus, the crown prince entered court, and the horses’ hoofs trampled the steps. The court officials beheaded his carriage and executed his driver. The crown prince, enraged, entered and wept before the king, saying: ‘You must surely execute and slay the court officials for me!’
The king replied: ‘The law exists to honor the ancestral temples and uphold the state. Therefore, those who can establish laws and follow orders with reverence for the state are the state’s loyal ministers—how could I execute them?’
To violate the law and disregard orders while failing to honor the state is for a minister to defy his sovereign and for the subjects to revere those who set themselves above the law. When a minister defies his sovereign, the ruler loses his authority; when subjects revere those who set themselves above the law, the high position becomes perilous. If authority is lost and the high position is in danger, the state cannot be preserved. How could I leave such a legacy for my descendants?’
Thus, the crown prince returned and fled, dwelling in exile and sleeping under the open sky for three days before kneeling in the north and repeatedly begging for his life. [Later account:]

The King of Chu urgently summoned the crown prince. The law of Chu forbade carriages from approaching the **Mao Men** (茅门).
Heavy rain fell, and the courtyard was flooded. The crown prince drove his carriage to the **Mao Men** anyway.
The court official said: ‘The carriage is not allowed to approach the **Mao Men**; this is against the law.’
The crown prince replied: ‘The king summoned me urgently, and I could not wait for the flood to subside.’
He drove forward. The court official raised his weapon and struck the horses, overturning the carriage.
The crown prince entered and wept before the king, saying: ‘The courtyard was flooded, so I drove my carriage to the **Mao Men**. The court official declared it unlawful and struck my horses, overturning my carriage. The king must surely execute him!’
The king said: ‘In the past, there was an elder sovereign who did not cross the threshold, and now there is a successor who does not obey the law—this is shameful. This is truly a minister who upholds the law.’
He then elevated the court official’s rank by two levels, opened a rear gate for the crown prince to exit, and forbade him from returning.

The successor of the Duke of Wei said to **Bo Yi** (薄疑): ‘You consider my realm too small to serve in, yet I can empower you to serve. I beg you to advance in rank and let you become the chief minister.’
He then granted Bo Yi ten thousand *qing* (顷) of land.
Bo Yi said: ‘My mother doubts me, believing that I am capable of what even the ministers of a great state cannot achieve.’
Yet, when Bo Yi’s mother had doubts about household matters, she would consult a soothsayer named **Cai Yu** (蔡妪), whom she deeply trusted and entrusted with family affairs. If Bo Yi’s mother agreed with his words, she would follow them; but if she had already spoken to the soothsayer, she would still seek confirmation from **Cai Yu**.
Thus, when assessing Bo Yi’s wisdom and ability, it was said that he could advise even the ministers of a great state, yet he was still unable to sway his mother.
When considering his filial piety, he was still unable to resolve doubts with his mother without consulting **Cai Yu**.
Now, Bo Yi stands before a sovereign, not his mother, and yet sovereigns all have their **Cai Yu**—those whom they hold in high regard. Those held in high regard by a sovereign are capable of private influence. The words of those who exercise private influence are beyond the reach of the law, while Bo Yi’s words are within the law. Private influence and the law are incompatible; they cannot coexist. [Later account:]

When the Duke of Wei journeyed to **Jin** (晋), he said to Bo Yi: ‘I wish for you to accompany me.’
Bo Yi replied: ‘My aged mother is still with me; I must first return home and consult her.’
The Duke of Wei personally invited Bo Yi’s mother, who said: ‘Bo Yi is your minister. If you have the intention to let him go, that is very good.’
The Duke of Wei said: ‘I have asked your permission, and you have consented to my request.’
When Bo Yi returned to speak to his mother, he said: ‘The Duke of Wei’s love for me—how does it compare to yours?’
She replied: ‘It is not as deep as my love for you.’
‘The Duke of Wei’s virtue in honoring me—how does it compare to yours?’
She replied: ‘It is not as great as my virtue in honoring you.’
After Bo Yi and his mother had decided on family matters and reached a conclusion, she would still consult the soothsayer **Cai Yu** before making a final decision. Now, the Duke of Wei has followed Bo Yi’s counsel and set out, yet even if Bo Yi and his mother had agreed, they would still be thwarted by another **Cai Yu**, and thus Bo Yi could not remain as a minister for long.

When teaching singing, one first instructs the students to loudly call out the **Gong** (宮) note and then corrects it, before gradually refining the **Zheng** (徵) note. If the voice does not return to clarity, it cannot be called teaching. [Later account:]

When teaching singing, one first measures the **Gong** (宮) note by rule, quickly calling out the central **Gong** (中宮), then slowly calling out the central **Zheng** (中徵). If the quick call does not hit the central **Gong** (宮), or the slow call does not hit the central **Zheng** (徵), it cannot be called teaching.

**Wu Qi** (吴起), a native of the **Zuo** (左氏) clan of **Wei** (卫), made his wife weave cloth to a narrow width, contrary to the standard measure.
Wu Qi ordered her to adjust it, but his wife replied: ‘Yes.’
After finishing, he measured it again, and it still did not conform to the standard.
Wu Qi grew furious, and his wife responded: ‘I initially followed your instructions, but I could not adjust it.’
Wu Qi banished her. His wife then sought her brother’s help to reclaim entry, and her brother said: ‘Wu Qi is a man of principle. His adherence to the law is such that he seeks to apply it to achieve great deeds for a great state. He must first practice it within his own household before enforcing it elsewhere. You, his mother, nearly lost your place within it.’
Wu Qi’s wife’s younger brother was held in higher regard by the Duke of Wei, so he used the duke’s influence to plead with Wu Qi. Wu Qi refused, and thus he left Wei and entered **Jing** (荆, Chu).

[Later account:]
Wu Qi showed his wife the loom and said: ‘Measure the cloth for me according to this standard.’
After she had woven it and presented it, the cloth was of superior quality.
Wu Qi said: ‘I ordered you to weave the cloth according to this standard, yet now it is of superior quality—why is this?’
His wife replied: ‘The effort and resources I expended were equal, but I applied greater care to its quality.’
Wu Qi said: ‘This was not what I instructed. Go and change your clothes.’
His father went to plead for her, but Wu Qi said: ‘My household does not tolerate idle words.’

The Duke of **Jin** (晋) asked **Hu Yan** (狐偃) and said: ‘I have prepared rich feasts in the hall, with wine and meat gathered in the palace. The wine is not strained, the fresh meat is not evenly sliced, and I slaughter one cow to distribute throughout the state. All the rewards of a year’s labor are used to clothe the soldiers. Is this sufficient to inspire the people to fight?’
Hu Yan replied: ‘It is not sufficient.’
The Duke of Jin said: ‘I have lifted the tolls on markets and lightened punishments. Is this sufficient to inspire the people to fight?’
Hu Yan replied: ‘It is not sufficient.’
The Duke of Jin said: ‘For those among my people who have lost relatives, I personally order the palace attendants to oversee funeral rites. If they are guilty of wrongdoing, I pardon them; if they are poor and cannot afford it, I provide the means. Is this sufficient to inspire the people to fight?’"
Hu Yan replied: ‘It is not sufficient.’

Hu Yan replied: ‘It is not sufficient. These are all measures to preserve life, but war is about killing. The people follow you because you preserve their lives, yet you then lead them to slaughter—you have lost the very reason they follow you.’

The Duke of Jin asked: ‘Then what *would* suffice to inspire the people to fight?’

Hu Yan replied: ‘Make it so that none dare avoid battle.’

The Duke of Jin said: ‘How can one ensure that none dare avoid battle?’

Hu Yan replied: ‘By enforcing rewards and punishments with absolute certainty—that will suffice to inspire them to fight.’

The Duke of Jin asked: ‘How severe must the punishments be?’

Hu Yan replied: ‘No favoritism toward kin or nobles—apply the law even to those you cherish.’

The Duke of Jin said: ‘Excellent.’

The next day, he issued an order for the people to till the fields at Pu Lu, setting noon as the deadline. Those who failed to meet it were to be tried by military law. Among those who arrived late was a favorite of the Duke’s, a man named Dian Jie. The officials petitioned for his punishment, and the Duke wept in sorrow.

The officials said: ‘We must carry out the law.’

They beheaded Dian Jie and displayed his corpse to the people, demonstrating the Duke’s resolve. Thereafter, the people trembled in fear, saying: ‘The Duke holds even Dian Jie—so esteemed and dear—as nothing when it comes to enforcing the law. What hope then is there for us?’

Seeing that his people were now ready to fight, the Duke of Jin raised his armies to the east, conquering Yuan. He attacked Wei, shifting its fields eastward, and seized Wulu. He struck Yang, defeated Guo, and subdued Cao. He marched south to besiege Zheng, then withdrew to its ramparts. He lifted the siege of Song and returned to clash with the Chu forces at Chengpu, defeating them utterly. He then established the Jian Tu Alliance and upheld the principles of Hengyong. In a single campaign, he achieved eight victories—all because of this: no other reason, no extraordinary means. He followed Hu Yan’s counsel and used Dian Jie’s execution as an example.

For when a boil festers, if you do not lance it to the bone and marrow, the pain will overwhelm the mind until it cannot endure. Only by doing so can you force a man to grind a half-inch whetstone against it. So too with governance: if the ruler does not know the people’s suffering, how can they be made to bear it?

To govern his state, one must not hesitate to heed the wise and punish treacherous ministers.

Treacherous ministers are always held in high regard.
Those held in high regard are always those whom the ruler holds most dear and loves.

Those whom the ruler holds most dear and loves—this is like clinging to the distinction between "firm" and "white."
With nothing but the commoner’s station, to seek to sever the ruler’s deep attachment to what he cherishes—this is like trying to persuade someone to sever their own left flank to please their right thigh: the body would surely die, and the persuasion would never take hold.

**One.**
When rewards and punishments are shared, prohibitions and commands fail to take effect. When ministers control them, they are said to be "shared." How do we know this? We see it in the cases of **Zàofù** and **Yúqí**. Though skilled in driving horses and able to endure thirst, when they grew greedy for a pig and drank to excess, they lost control. **Zǐhǎn** was made responsible for providing food, yet he failed to enforce discipline—so much so that the entire state feared him, and he eventually usurped the ruler. This was akin to the power derived from controlling the distribution of food. **Tián Dàn** managed the royal gardens and pools, arbitrarily granting rewards, and people flocked to him, leading him to assassinate **Jiǎn Gōng**. This too was a case of power arising from control over gardens and pools.

Thus, the rulers of **Sòng** and **Jiǎn** were slain. The danger lies in **Wáng Liáng** and **Zàofù** sharing the reins, or **Tián Lián** and **Chéng Xuè** sharing the zither. Though **Wáng** and **Zàofù** were indeed skilled charioteers, if they allowed others to hold the reins, the horses would not advance. Though **Tián Chéng** was a master musician, if another were allowed to pluck the strings, the melody would fail. So too when ministers share in rewards and punishments.

**Two.**
Strength and order arise from law, while weakness and chaos stem from favoritism. When laws are bent, disorder follows. If a ruler understands this, he will uphold rewards and punishments without relying on mere benevolence toward his subjects. Nobility and emoluments arise from merit; when merit is established, nobility follows. Executions and punishments arise from guilt; when guilt is proven, punishment follows. If ministers understand this, they will exert themselves to the utmost in loyalty to their ruler. When the ruler transcends mere benevolence and ministers transcend mere loyalty, then true kingship can be achieved.

**Zhāoxiáng** knew the ruler’s inclinations, yet he only sought to apply reason in his reproaches. The common people should merely follow their lord’s commands, requiring no excessive affection—thus, when the ruler fell ill and prayed for recovery, **Zhāowáng** held him accountable for the **Èr Jiǎ** incident, yet did not open the royal gardens. When **Yìng Hóu** wished to distribute vegetables and fruits to relieve the starving, **Zhāowáng** deemed it improper to reward without merit, and so stopped him.

**Tián Wěi** understood the minister’s nature, urging him only to establish merit—since private loyalty to the ruler was unnecessary. Hence, he instructed **Tián Zhāng**, saying: *"Enriching the state enriches oneself; benefiting the ruler benefits oneself."* Yet **Gōngyí** declined the fish, believing that accepting it for violating the law would mean losing it entirely, and thus refused.

**Three.**
A wise ruler learns from external affairs, and since external matters must succeed, **Sū Dài** was right not to trust **Qí Wáng**. Because **Sū Dài** ordered **Yàn Wáng** to entrust matters solely to him, the king did not do so, and thus failed to achieve hegemony.

A ruler must also discern the intentions of scholars, for those who reside in obscurity yet seek prominence will deceive. Thus, **Pān Shòu** spoke of **Yǔ’s** sentiments to flatter **Zǐ**, telling **Yàn Wáng** that **Yǔ** had passed his throne to **Yì**, only to have **Qǐ** seize it. The king then exalted **Zǐ** all the more.

If a ruler remains unaware, then how can he know that others may borrow his authority? Should he fear that his kin might share his garments, or that his ministers might borrow his power? If he knows that all men know themselves, he will not share his carriage with those who do not wear his garments, nor his household with those of the same clan—for fear they might exploit their kinship. How much more so with ministers borrowing the ruler’s authority?

**Wú Zhāng** understood this, so he feigned compliance, yet died while still relying on sincerity. **Zhào Wáng** hated the "tiger’s eye" and obstructed the ruler’s way, just as the royal gardener hated the tiger’s eye and had it removed. When courtiers spoke of **Píngyáng Jūn’s** eyes being worse than the tiger’s, the king ordered the speaker executed—just as **Zhōu’s** envoy rejected **Wèi Hóu** because his given name, **Bìqiáng**, was the same as the imperial title, and only allowed him to enter after he changed it.

**Four.**
A ruler is one who upholds the law, demands results, and establishes merit. Though officials may be corrupt, there are upright citizens who remain steadfast in their principles—such as the **Three Virtuous Men of Yīn** and **Lóng Fòng of Xià**. Yet there has never been a case of a corrupt official being alone in his governance. If **Zǐshuài** enforces order, who would dare to disobey? Thus, a wise ruler governs officials, not the people. When officials are governed, the people will be governed as well.

This is illustrated by the roots of a tree and the halter of a net: shaking the roots moves all the branches, pulling the halter opens all the meshes. When officials are upright, the state is governed. Hence, even the **shèifu** responsible for extinguishing fires must be held accountable.

Those who extinguish fires—if an official carries a bucket and runs to the blaze, his effort is that of one man alone. But if he wields a whip to command others, he mobilizes ten thousand. A wise ruler wields the **contracts (qì)** in the same way. Thus, when encountering a skilled horseman like **Zào Jiāo** facing a startled horse, pulling the horse and pushing the carriage would not advance them, but if another took the reins and held the whip, the horses would gallop forward.

Hence, the principle lies in straightening the crooked and leveling the uneven, in bending the warped and making the straight straight. If not, disaster follows—as when **Nào Chǐ** used **Qí’s** execution of **Mǐn Wáng**, or **Lǐ Duì** used **Zhào’s** famine to starve **Zhǔfù**.

**Five.**
By following the natural order of affairs, success comes without labor—thus **Zī Zhèng** sat on the chariot’s pole and sang of ascending the high beams. The danger lies in **Zhào Jiǎnzhǔ** consulting with tax officials about levies, where the ruler, desiring taxation, asked the officials about rates, yet failed to set clear limits himself, merely saying, *"Do not make them too light or too heavy."* The officials then arbitrarily enriched themselves. **Bó Yí**’s words led to the people being well-fed across the state. **Jiǎnzhǔ** rejoiced, yet the treasury was empty, while the people starved and corrupt officials grew rich.

Thus, **Huán Gōng** inspected the people, and **Guān Zhòng** examined the decaying wealth and the abandoned women. The duke, upon seeing a starving man and an elderly man without a wife, reported to **Zhòng**, saying: *"When the state has rotting wealth, the people starve; when the palace has abandoned women, the elderly have no wives."* Otherwise, as in **Yánlíng**, where the horses could not advance, **Zàofù** wept upon seeing it—obstructed by the decorations in front and the harness behind, unable to move forward or backward, and thus straying to the side. **Zàofù** wept at the sight, just as misplaced rewards and punishments inevitably lead to ruin.

**End of the Chapter.**

Zào Fǔ controlled the four horses, galloping swiftly in circles to indulge his desires in them. Whatever his will desired, the horses would follow without hesitation. His indulgence in the horses lay in his mastery over the reins and whip. With the reins and whip firmly in command, the horses did not disobey.

Yet when the horses were startled by the **#6出彘** (wild boar), Zào Fǔ could not restrain them, not because the reins and whip were insufficiently strict, but because his authority was undermined by the **#6出彘**. The **#6出彘** also made the horses something to be feared, hence the saying *"authority was undermined by the **#6出彘**."* The Prince of **Yúqī** served as the **bìngjià** (marriage escort) for the **Zhào** Duke, but he did not use the reins and whip, instead choosing to indulge the horses’ desires and monopolizing the advantage of fodder and water. Yet when the horses passed the **pǔchí** (ponds and fields), the **bìngjià** failed, not because the advantage of fodder and water was lacking, but because his **virtue/power** (德) was divided among the **pǔchí**.

Thus, **Wáng Liáng** and **Zào Fǔ**, though the finest charioteers in the world, could not make the horses move even ten *lǐ* when **Wáng Liáng** held the left reins and **Zào Fǔ** held the right, each issuing commands and whips—this was because of the divided authority. **Tián Lián** and **Chéng Qiào**, though the finest musicians in the world, could not compose a melody when **Tián Lián** played the upper strings and **Chéng Qiào** played the lower—this was also because of the divided effort.

How could the **Dao/Way** (道) of **Wáng Liáng** and **Zào Fǔ**, who were so skillful, succeed in controlling the horses if their authority was divided? How could the **Dao/Way** (道) of the ruler succeed in governing if he shared power with his ministers? The **Zhào** Duke said: *"Let me test your charioteering in the fields."* Zào Fǔ drove his carriage into the fields, and the horses, seeing the **pǔchí**, bolted, unable to be restrained. Though Zào Fǔ had long trained the horses to endure thirst, when they saw the **pǔchí**, they broke free and ran, and even Zào Fǔ could not control them. Now, **Jiǎn Gōng** had long restrained his people with laws, yet **Tián Chéng Héng** (田成恒) took advantage of them, just as **Tián Chéng Héng** tilted the **pǔchí** and tempted the thirsty people.

Another account says:
The Prince of **Yúqī** served as the **bìngjià** for the **Sòng** Lord in the pursuit of a thousand-*lǐ* horse race.

The carriage was already harnessed, and he examined the markings on the driver’s hands.
Just as he was about to depart, he urged the horses forward, but the wheels were bound by cords, which pulled them back, and the horses turned away.
He then released the cords and set them free, but the pig escaped from the hole, and the horses recoiled and retreated; though he urged them forward with the whip, they could not advance.
The horses reared and bolted, and though he tried to control them with the reins, he could not keep them straight.

Another account says:
**Sìchéng Zǐ Hǎn** told the **Sòng** Lord: *"To grant rewards and bestow favors is what the people delight in—let Your Majesty personally oversee these matters.
To impose punishments and execute criminals is what the people abhor—let me take responsibility for these."* Thus, the Lord executed commoners while **Zǐ Hǎn** was put to death for his crimes, and the Lord declared, *"This matter was decided by **Zǐ Hǎn**."*

After a year, the people came to know that the power of life and death rested with **Zǐ Hǎn**, and so the entire realm turned to him.
Thus, **Zǐ Hǎn** coerced the **Sòng** Lord and seized control of governance—**the law could not restrain him**.
Hence it is said that **Zǐ Hǎn** was the one who let the pig out, while **Tián Chéng Héng** was the one who tilted the **pǔchí**.

Now, if **Wáng Liáng** and **Zào Fǔ** were to share a chariot, each holding one rein as they entered the gates, the team would surely falter and the **Dao/Way** would not reach its destination.
If **Tián Lián** and **Chéng Xiào** were to share a zither, each plucking one string, the harmony would be ruined and the melody would fail to complete itself.

Two:
When **Qín Zhāo Wáng** was ill, the commoners bought cattle in their neighborhoods and prayed for the king’s recovery at home.
**Gōngsūn Shù** came out to see them, then entered to congratulate the king: *"The commoners have all bought cattle in their neighborhoods and prayed for Your Majesty’s recovery."*
The king sent someone to inquire about it, and indeed, it was so.
The king said: *"Bestow two ranks of reward upon them."*

The **punishment** is a **disparagement**. The king **rewarded** them with two ranks.

Indeed, those who prayed without being commanded were showing their love for me.
If they loved me, then I should **change the law** and align my heart with theirs—otherwise, the law would not stand.
If the law does not stand, then this is the path to **chaos and downfall**.
Yet instead of following this path, the king **punished** them with two ranks and then **rewarded** them to govern again.

Secondly:
When **King Xīn of Qín** was ill, the commoners prayed for him, and after his recovery, they sacrificed oxen to fulfill their prayers.
**Yàn Jué**, a **courtier**, and **Gōngsūn Yǎn** came out to see them and asked in surprise: *"This is not the time of the seasonal sacrifices—why are you slaughtering oxen and worshipping the ancestral mounds?"*
The commoners replied: *"The sovereign was ill, so we prayed for him. Now that he has recovered, we sacrifice oxen to fulfill our prayers."*
**Yàn Jué** and **Gōngsūn Yǎn** were **pleased** and went to see the king, bowing and congratulating him: *"Your Majesty has surpassed **Yáo** and **Shùn**!"*
The king was startled and asked: *"What do you mean?"*
They answered: *"**Yáo** and **Shùn**, their people did not even reach the point of praying for them. Now, Your Majesty was ill, and the people prayed with oxen, then slaughtered oxen to fulfill their prayers. Therefore, your subjects humbly believe that Your Majesty has surpassed **Yáo** and **Shùn**!"*
The king then asked why they came from certain neighborhoods, and **punished** their **ward leaders** and **five-family elders** with two ranks each.
**Lǚ** (屯) is also a **punishment**.
**Yàn Jué** and **Gōngsūn Yǎn** remained silent and dared not speak.

After several months, the king was **drunk on wine** and enjoying himself, so **Yàn Jué** and **Gōngsūn Yǎn** said to him: *"Earlier, your subjects humbly believed that Your Majesty had surpassed **Yáo** and **Shùn**, not merely daring to flatter you. **Yáo** and **Shùn**, when they were ill, their people did not even reach the point of praying for them. Now, Your Majesty was ill, and the people prayed with oxen, then slaughtered oxen to fulfill their prayers. Yet now you **punish** their ward leaders and five-family elders with two ranks each—your subjects humbly find this strange."*

The king said: *"Why do you not understand this?*
Those people serve me not because I love them, but because of my **power and authority**."*

「Chapter 2. **Releasing power and severing ties with the people**—this is also a form of punishment.
I abandon my **power and authority** to let the people drift away from me,
so if I do not **virtue/power** them with love, the people will not serve me.
Thus, I have completely abandoned the **Dao/Way** of love.

When there was a great famine in **Qín**, **Yìng Hóu** (應侯) petitioned: *"The grasses of the Five Parks (五苑) are sprouting—meaning the plants grow from the earth.
Vegetables, acorns, dates, and chestnuts are sufficient to sustain the people.
I request that they be distributed."*

King **Zhāoxiāng** (昭襄王) of **Qín** said: *"Our **Qín laws** state that the people receive rewards for their merits and punishments for their crimes.
If we distribute the grasses of the Five Parks, we would be rewarding both those who have merit and those who do not.
To reward both those with merit and those without is the **Dao/Way** of chaos.
If distributing the Five Parks leads to chaos, it is better to abandon the dates and vegetables and maintain order."*

**Another account says:**
*"If you order the distribution of the Five Parks’ vegetables, dates, acorns, and chestnuts—sufficient to sustain the people—
this would cause the people to compete for rewards, whether they have merit or not.
To create chaos by rewarding the living is worse than letting the people perish to maintain order.
Thus, the officials should abandon this plan."*

**Tián Wéi** (田鮒) instructed his son, **Tián Zhāng** (田章):
*"To enrich oneself and one’s family, one must first enrich the state and the ruler.
To enrich one’s family, one must first enrich the nation."*

**Another account says:**
*"Tián Wéi taught his son, Tián Zhāng:
‘When a ruler sells official positions and titles,
and a minister sells his wisdom and strength,
they rely on themselves, not on others.
**Gōngyí Xiū** (公仪休) served as chancellor of **Lǔ** while loving fish.
All across the state, people competed to buy fish and present it to him,
but Gōngyí’s son refused to accept it.
His younger brother remonstrated:
‘Master, you love fish yet refuse to accept it—why?’
He replied:
‘Because I love fish, I refuse to accept it.
If I accept fish, I must inevitably show favoritism to those who give it to me.
Showing favoritism would violate the law,
and if I violate the law, I would be removed from my position as chancellor.
Even if I love fish, I cannot guarantee that those who give it to me will always provide it,
nor can I guarantee my own supply of fish.
But if I do not accept fish, I can maintain my chancellor’s office indefinitely,
and though I love fish, I can still ensure a lasting supply for myself.
This demonstrates that relying on others is worse than relying on oneself,
and that others providing for you is worse than you providing for yourself.’"*

**Chapter 3.**
*"When you served as chancellor of **Yàn** (燕), you were honored yet refused authority.
**Sū Dài** (苏代), as an emissary from **Qí** (齐) to **Yàn**, was asked by the king:
‘How is the ruler of **Qí**?’
He replied:
‘He will never become a hegemon (霸).’
The **Yàn** king asked:
‘Why?’
He answered:
‘In the past, when **Huan Gōng** (桓公) was hegemon,
he entrusted domestic affairs to **Bào Shū** (鲍叔) and foreign affairs to **Guǎn Zhòng** (管仲).
**Huan Gōng** wore his hair unbound and attended to women,
spending his days leisurely in the marketplace.
Now, the ruler of **Qí** does not trust his great ministers.’
Thus, the **Yàn** king increased his trust in you.*

**Another account says:**
*"Sū Dài, as an emissary from **Qín** to **Yàn**, saw that if he did not praise you, he would not be able to complete his mission and return.
Moreover, his tribute and gifts would not be granted.
So when he saw the **Yàn** king, he praised the ruler of **Qí**.
The **Yàn** king asked:
‘If the ruler of **Qí** is so virtuous, will he not become king of all under heaven?’
Sū Dài replied:
‘He cannot even save his own state—how could he become king?’
The **Yàn** king asked:
‘Why?’
He said:
‘His distribution of favors is not equitable.’
The **Yàn** king asked:
‘Why will his state perish?’
He replied:
‘In the past, **Qián Gōng** (桓公) of **Qí** loved **Guǎn Zhòng**,
elevating him to the rank of *Zhòng Fù* (仲父),
entrusting domestic affairs to him and foreign affairs to his judgment.
The entire state followed him,
so he achieved one restoration of order under heaven (一匡天下)
and nine alliances among the feudal lords (九合诸侯).
Now, the ruler of **Qí** distributes his favors unequitably—
this is why I know his state will perish.’
The **Yàn** king said:
‘Now I entrust authority to you,
but the world has not yet heard of it.’
The next day, he publicly announced your appointment as chancellor and listened to your counsel.

**Pān Shòu** (潘寿) told the **Yàn** king:
‘Your Majesty should not do as I did—
you should instead grant the entire state to you.
The reason people call **Yáo** (尧) virtuous is that he ceded the **Mandate of Heaven** (天下) to **Xǔ Yóu** (许由),
who certainly refused it.
Thus, **Yáo** gained the reputation of ceding the **Mandate of Heaven** while in reality not losing it.
If Your Majesty grants the state to me,
I would certainly refuse it—
then Your Majesty would gain the reputation of ceding the state to me,
just as **Yáo** did.
Thus, the king of **Yàn** entrusted the entire state to you,
and you were greatly honored.’"*

**Another account says:**
*"Pān Shòu was a **recluse** (岩穴之士).
The **Yàn** king sent envoys to invite him.
When Pān Shòu saw the **Yàn** king, he said:
‘I fear that you will treat me as **Yì** (益) was treated.
The people feared that **Yì** would seize the **Mandate of Heaven** after **Yǔ** (禹) died,
so **Yǔ’s** descendants attacked **Yì** and established **Kāi** (启).
Now, Your Majesty trusts and loves me,
and you intend to pass the state to me.
All the **Tàizǐ’s** (太子) men have already taken their seals and left,
while none of my men remain in the court.
If Your Majesty, by misfortune, abandons the officials,
I would be like **Yì** as well.’
Thus, the **Yàn** king recalled the seals of office,
and from the rank of *sān bǎi dàn* (三百石) and above,
all officials pledged allegiance to you,
and you were greatly honored.

*"Now, the ruler’s means of self-reflection are the **scholars and followers** (士徒) of the feudal lords,
but today, the scholars and followers of the feudal lords are all factions of private doors.
The ruler’s means of self-examination are the **recluses and hermits** (岩穴之士),
but today, the recluses and hermits are all attendants of private doors.
What is this?
The resources of the state have been seized by you."*

Thus, **Wú Zhāng** said: *"The sovereign should not feign hatred or love for his subjects. If he feigns love, he cannot later hate; if he feigns hatred, he cannot later love."*

The **Yàn king** wished to pass the realm to **Zǐzhī**. When he consulted **Pàn Shòu**, the latter replied: *"Yǔ loved Yì and entrusted the world to him, yet later appointed Shìrén as his minister. When Yǔ grew old and deemed Shìrén unfit to rule, he passed the world to Yì—yet all power remained with Shìrén. Later, Shìrén and his faction attacked Yì and seized the world. Thus, Yǔ’s name passed the world to Yì, but in truth, he allowed Shìrén to take it himself. This shows Yǔ was inferior to Yáo and Shùn."*

Now, Your Majesty wishes to pass the realm to **Zǐzhī**, yet all officials are men of the **Tàizǐ**. This is to name it a transfer, yet in truth, it allows the **Tàizǐ** to take it himself.

The **Yàn king** thus recalled the seals of office, and all officials from the rank of *sān bǎi dàn* and above pledged allegiance to **Zǐzhī**, making him greatly honored.

**Wú Zhāng** then said: *"I have heard of the ancient rites: one does not ride in the same carriage as those of differing attire, nor share a household with those of differing lineage. How much less should the sovereign borrow another’s authority while excluding their influence!"*

**Wú Zhāng** told King **Chuān of Hàn**: *"The sovereign must not feign love for his subjects—once he does, he cannot later hate them. Nor must he feign hatred—once he does, he cannot later love them. If signs of feigned love or hatred appear, flatterers will exploit them to slander or praise, and even a wise sovereign cannot undo the damage, let alone one who relies on sincerity to borrow influence."*

The **Zhào king** strolled in his garden when his attendants presented a **pí** (菟) and a tiger, which they killed and displayed. The tiger’s eyes twitched angrily around its sockets. The king said, *"How detestable! The tiger’s eyes!"* The attendants replied, *"The eyes of **Píngyáng Jūn** are far more detestable than these. Seeing this tiger does no harm, but if one sees **Píngyáng Jūn’s** eyes like this, death will follow."* The next day, **Píngyáng Jūn** heard of this and had the speaker killed, yet the king did not punish him.

When the **Wèi lord** attended court at **Zhōu**, a **Zhōu official** asked his title. He replied, *"The lord of the feudal domains."* The **Zhōu official** rebuked him: *"Feudal lords may not share the title of the Son of Heaven. The title of one who opens and governs lands belongs to the Son of Heaven."* The **Wèi lord** then changed his reply: *"The lord who destroys the feudal domains."* **Kǒng Zǐ** heard of this and said: *"How distant are the restraints of propriety! Even empty titles are not lent to others—how much less real authority!"* The title *"Opens the domains"* does not guarantee the ability to govern them, hence it is called *"empty."*

**Shaking a tree** by plucking each leaf individually is laborious and incomplete, yet striking its trunk causes all leaves to tremble. Striking is to agitate violently. Standing by a precipice and shaking a tree startles the crows, who fly high, and terrifies the fish, which dive deep.

A skilled netter pulls the main rope—if one must pluck each mesh before catching fish, the effort is great and the task difficult. But by pulling the rope, the fish are already ensnared. Thus, officials are the fundamental ropes of the people, and so the sage governs through officials, not the people directly. Governing officials is like pulling the rope; managing the people is like setting the nets.

When saving a fire, ordering officials to carry jars and buckets is the work of one man, but wielding a whip and commanding others is to control thousands. Thus, the sage does not personally attend to minor matters, and the enlightened sovereign does not involve himself in trifles.

When **Zàofù** was plowing, a father and son in a carriage passed by. The horses panicked and refused to move. The son dismounted to lead the horses, and the father and son urged **Zàofù** to help push the carriage. **Zàofù** set aside his tools, loaded them, and took the son’s place in the carriage. Only then did he adjust the reins and whip—yet the horses still panicked. If **Zàofù** could not control them, even if he exerted himself to push the carriage, the horses would still not move.

Now, the sovereign labors in governance, yet entrusts authority to those of virtue and skill. Skill is the reins and whip of the realm. With skill, the sovereign rests in ease while achieving imperial achievements.

The **chuí** (椎) and **duàn** (锻) are used to flatten what is uneven; the **bàng** (榜) and **tíng** (檠) are used to straighten what is crooked. The sage’s laws are like these—used to flatten the uneven and straighten the crooked.

When **Dùnchǐ** served **Qí**, he severed **Mǐn Wáng’s** sinews; when **Lǐ Duì** served **Zhào**, he starved **Zhǔfù** to death. These two rulers could not wield the **chuí-duàn** and **bàng-tíng**, so they died in disgrace and became objects of ridicule.

Thus, it is said: *"When entering **Qí**, one hears only of **Dùnchǐ**, not of the **Qí king**; when entering **Zhào**, one hears only of **Lǐ Duì**, not of the **Zhào king**."* Therefore: *"If the sovereign does not wield skill, his authority is weak, and his ministers usurp his name."*

When **Tián Yīng** served as **Qí’s** chancellor, a man advised the king: *"If Your Majesty does not personally review the annual accounts within days, you cannot discern the officials’ deceit, gains, or losses."* The king agreed. **Tián Yīng** heard this and immediately requested an audience to present the accounts. The king was about to listen when **Tián Yīng** ordered the clerks to prepare the official seals, weights, and measures. The king reviewed them but found the records overwhelming, so he stopped eating. Later, when he resumed his seat, he did not eat again that evening. **Tián Yīng** then said: *"These are matters the ministers dare not neglect day or night. If Your Majesty reviews them in one evening, the ministers will be encouraged to excel."* The king agreed. Soon, however, he fell asleep, and the officials secretly shaved the seals and altered the weights and measures. When the king reviewed them again, chaos began.

**Wǔ Líng Wáng** entrusted governance to **Huì Wén Wáng** and made **Lǐ Duì** chancellor. Since **Wǔ Líng Wáng** did not personally wield the power of life and death, he was held hostage by **Lǐ Duì**.

Five. When **Zī Zhèngzǐ** attempted to pull the carriage up the steep slope of **Gāo Liáng**, he could not manage it. **Zī Zhèngzǐ** then squatted on the yoke and sang, halting those in front and urging those behind, and the carriage ascended.

Had **Zī Zhèngzǐ** lacked the skill to influence others, even if his own strength had been exhausted to the point of death, the carriage would still not have ascended. Yet now, without his body enduring hardship, the carriage ascended because he possessed the skill to influence others.

**Zhào Jiǎn Zhǔ** imposed taxes, and the officials requested permission to adjust their severity. **Zhào Jiǎn Zhǔ** replied: *"Do not make them too light, nor too heavy."* Heavy taxes benefited the ruler above, while light ones favored the people below. The officials, having no private gain, thus remained impartial.

**Bó Yí** suspected and told **Zhào Jiǎn Zhǔ**: *"Your realm is well-fed."* **Zhào Jiǎn Zhǔ**, delighted, asked: *"How so?"* **Bó Yí** answered: *"The royal treasury is depleted above, while the common people suffer hunger below—yet the corrupt officials grow wealthy."*

**Qí Huán Gōng** disguised himself and toured among the people’s homes. He encountered an elderly man who was self-sustaining, and the king inquired as to why. The man replied: *"Your servant has three sons, but our family is too poor to marry them off. My labor has not yet earned enough to repay even a single day’s wages."*

Upon returning, **Qí Huán Gōng** told **Guǎn Zhòng**, who said: *"If the stores are filled with rotting wealth, the people will starve. If the palace harbors unmarried women, the common folk will have none to wed."*

The king replied: *"Well said."* He then decreed that all unmarried women in the palace be sent away and ordered the people: *"Let men take wives at twenty and women be married at fifteen."* Another account states:

**Qí Huán Gōng**, in disguise, traveled among the people. He found a man named **Lùmén Jì**, aged seventy, yet without a wife. The king asked **Guǎn Zhòng**: *"Is there an elderly man without a wife among the people?"* **Guǎn Zhòng** answered: *"There is **Lùmén Jì**, now seventy years old, who has no wife."* The king asked: *"How can we ensure he has one?"* **Guǎn Zhòng** replied: *"I have heard that if the ruler accumulates wealth, the people and subjects will inevitably suffer want below. If the palace harbors unmarried women, there will be elderly men without wives."* The king replied: *"Well said."* He then commanded that all palace women who had not been bedded be married off and ordered: *"Let men take wives at twenty and women be married at fifteen."* Thus, within the palace, no women were left in despair, and among the people, no men were without wives.

**Yán Líng Zhuó Zǐ** rode in a carriage adorned with **Cānglóng** (Azure Dragon) and **Tiǎowén** (Filet) embellishments—meaning it was intricately decorated. The **gōushì** (hooks) at the front were adorned to restrain the horses, while the **cuòchā** (crossbars) and **guànchī** (sleeves) at the rear were decorated with gold. If the horses wanted to advance, the **gōushì** would hold them back; if they wanted to retreat, the **cuòchā** and **guànchī** would be applied, forcing them to veer aside. **Zhòufù** (the charioteer) passed by and wept, saying: *"The governance of ancient rulers was also thus."* Rewards were meant to encourage, yet their brilliance was overshadowed by corruption; punishments were meant to restrain, yet their severity was undermined by praise. The people stood bewildered, not knowing the true intent. When rewards were spoken of, they were tainted by corruption; when punishments were spoken of, they were accompanied by praise. Hence, the people did not understand their purpose.

This was also the reason why **sages** wept. Another account states:

The **延陵卓子** rode the **Chánglóng** (Azure Dragon) chariot alongside the **Zháiwén** (Zhai’s decorated) chariot, with horses bearing Zhai’s markings. At the front were the **cuòshì** (overlapping shackles), and at the rear were sharp **chā** (hooked blades). If the horses wanted to advance, they were pulled back by the **cuòshì**; if they wanted to retreat, they were prodded with the **chā**. The horses could neither push forward nor retreat, so they veered aside and galloped free, whereupon **Zhòufù** (the charioteer) drew his sword from below and severed his own feet.

**Zhòufù** saw this and wept, refusing to eat for the entire day. Then, gazing heavenward, he sighed and said:

*"The whip is meant to urge them forward, yet the **cuòshì** is placed at the front to restrain them; the hook is meant to make them retreat, yet the sharp **chā** is placed at the rear. Now, the ruler rewards his subjects for their **qīngjié** (purity and integrity), yet banishes them for failing to please his favorites; he praises their **gōngzhèng** (impartiality and justice), yet discards them for not obeying his commands. The people stand in fear, bewildered and unsure of their purpose—this is why the **sages** weep.

The ancient sages in their conduct sometimes acted contrary to reason, and Master Han established principles to challenge them. Duke Wen of Jin was about to engage in battle with the Chu, so he summoned his uncle, Cui Fan, and asked him: *"I am about to fight the Chu, whose forces outnumber ours. What should I do?"*

Cui Fan replied: *"I have heard that elaborate rites are for the virtuous gentleman, yet they do not exhaust loyalty and sincerity. Rites are elaborate and intricate, hence 'elaborate rites.' Only loyalty and sincerity can be cultivated through rites, hence 'they do not exhaust loyalty and sincerity.' In battle, there is no limit to deceit and guile. Without deceit, victory cannot be secured, hence 'there is no limit to deceit and guile.' My lord, you should rely on deceit alone."*

Duke Wen declined Cui Fan’s counsel and instead summoned Yong Ji, asking him the same question: *"I am about to fight the Chu, whose forces outnumber ours. What should I do?"*

Yong Ji answered: *"Burning forests to hunt is a temporary, expedient measure. Though the beasts may be many now, they will not last forever. If you deceive the people, you gain only a fleeting advantage, but in the end, there will be no more trust. If you rely on deceit to gain advantage, you will inevitably corrupt the people with deceit and guile, so there will be no more loyalty and sincerity."*

Duke Wen said: *"Well spoken."* After dismissing Yong Ji, he adopted Cui Fan’s strategy against the Chu, defeating them. Upon his return, he conferred ranks, placing Yong Ji above Cui Fan. The ministers protested: *"In the Battle of Chengpu, it was Cui Fan’s strategy that prevailed. How can you reward the one who spoke but place him below the one who acted?"*

Duke Wen replied: *"This is beyond your understanding. Cui Fan’s words were a measure for the moment, but Yong Ji’s words were for the benefit of ages to come."* Confucius, hearing of this, remarked: *"Duke Wen’s dominion was indeed fitting! He knew both the expedient of the moment and the benefit of ages."*

Some objected: *"Yong Ji’s response did not suit the duke’s question. When answering, one should consider the urgency and scale of the matter. If the question is grand, yet the answer is petty, the wise ruler will not accept it. Here, the duke asked about facing superior forces, yet Yong Ji spoke of future consequences—this was not the proper response."*

*"Moreover, Duke Wen did not grasp the expedient of the moment nor the benefit of ages. If he won the battle, his state would be secure, his army strong, and his reputation established. Even if there were future consequences, nothing surpasses this. How could the benefit of ages not follow? If he lost, his state would perish, his army weaken, and his name fade. The harm of today’s defeat outweighs any concern for the benefit of ages. The benefit of ages depends on today’s victory, and today’s victory depends on deceiving the enemy. Deceiving the enemy secures the benefit of ages. Thus, it is said that Yong Ji’s response did not suit the duke’s question."*

*"Furthermore, Duke Wen did not understand Cui Fan’s words. When Cui Fan spoke of 'no limit to deceit and guile,' he did not mean deceiving one’s own people—he meant deceiving the enemy. The enemy is the state we attack; even if there are future consequences, what harm is there?"*

*"If Duke Wen honored Yong Ji first because of his merit, then the victory over Chu and the defeat of their army were due to Cui Fan’s strategy. If it was for his wise words, then Yong Ji merely warned of future consequences—this was no virtue. Cui Fan, however, combined both. Cui Fan said that elaborate rites for the virtuous gentleman do not exhaust loyalty and sincerity—loyalty is to love one’s subjects, sincerity is to not deceive the people. Who could speak better than this? Yet he also said that deceit and guile are necessary in military strategy. Cui Fan had both wise words and battlefield victory, so he had two merits, while Yong Ji had none and was rewarded first. Was Duke Wen’s dominion not indeed fitting?"*

*"Confucius did not understand how to reward merit. If Confucius did not understand how to reward merit, how could he rashly praise 'fitting'?"*

There was a farmer from Mount Li who encroached on his neighbor’s fields. Shun went to till there, and within a year, the boundaries were properly marked. *Because they emulated each other’s humility, they were corrected.*

There were fishermen along the riverbank who clashed over their fishing platforms—*platforms being the raised areas in the water where fishermen stood*. Shun went fishing there, and within a year, they yielded precedence to the eldest.

There were potters among the Eastern Yi whose wares were poorly made. Shun went to work among them, and within a year, their vessels became sturdy. Confucius sighed and said: *"Plowing, fishing, and pottery-making were not Shun’s duties, nor were they the affairs of a great sage. Yet Shun took them up to rectify their flaws. Truly, Shun was a man of perfect virtue and benevolence! He personally toiled in hardship, and the people followed him—thus, the sage’s transformative power."*

Someone asked the Confucian scholars: *"At that time, where was Yao?"* The man replied: *"Yao was the Son of Heaven."* Then they asked: *"If Confucius considered Yao a sage, how does Shun’s conduct fit?"* If Yao, as a sage on high, governed with clarity, why were there still three men acting wickedly? If Shun’s transformative power was needed, then Yao must have failed in his governance. If Shun was virtuous, he replaced Yao’s clarity; if Yao was a sage, he negated Shun’s transformative power—both cannot coexist.*

There was a man from Chu who sold both shields and spears, praising them thus: *"My shield is unbreakable—nothing can pierce it."* And of his spear: *"My spear is unerring—nothing it strikes can it not pierce."* Someone asked: *"If you strike your shield with your spear, what happens?"* The man could not answer. A shield that cannot be pierced and a spear that can pierce anything cannot coexist in the world.

Now, Yao and Shun cannot both be praised—it is like the paradox of the shield and the spear. Moreover, Shun’s rectification took only a year, yet three years passed, and three men persisted in their flaws. Shun’s life was finite, as was his time. The world’s flaws could not be exhausted, yet he chased the inexhaustible with the finite—his efforts were few.

「Rewards and punishments must be enforced throughout the realm, and the decree was: *"Those who meet the standard are rewarded; those who fail are put to death."* The orders changed from morning to evening, and from evening to morning, and in ten days, the whole land was transformed. Why wait a full year?

Even Shun did not rely on this to persuade Yao to follow his own methods, but instead took personal action—was he not lacking in skill?

Moreover, one who takes bodily suffering as a means to transform the people is a challenge even for Yao and Shun. But a ruler of mediocre virtue finds it easy to indulge in arrogance while in power. If one seeks to govern the realm, abandoning what is easy for mediocre rulers and instead pursuing what is difficult for Yao and Shun, one cannot be said to be fit for politics.

When Guan Zhong was ill, Duke Huan of Qi went to inquire about him and said: *"Comrade Zhong, alas, you have succumbed to your fate. How shall I inform my humble self?"* Guan Zhong replied: *"Without your words, I would have already paid my respects to you. May I suggest that you dismiss the eunuch Ji Dan, remove Yi Ya, and distance yourself from the son of Wei, Kai Fang?"*

Yi Ya prepared the ruler’s favorite flavors; the ruler had never tasted human meat, so Yi Ya steamed his own son’s head and presented it to him. Now, no man fails to love his own child—if he does not love his own child, how could he love his ruler? The ruler expanded his desires and favored his concubines; Ji Dan managed the inner quarters from within the palace. No man fails to love his own body—if he does not love his own body, how could he love his ruler? Kai Fang served his ruler for fifteen years; between Qi and Wei, he could not even spare a few days to return home, abandoning his mother for long periods in office. His mother did not love him—how could he love his ruler?

I have heard it said: *"Falsehoods cannot endure, and hollow pretenses will not last long."* This means that deceitful schemes cannot persist in the long term. I wish you would dismiss these three men.

Guan Zhong died, yet Duke Huan did not act on his advice. When Duke Huan died, worms emerged from his corpse, and he was left unburied. Some said: *"The words Guan Zhong used to admonish Duke Huan were not the speech of a wise man."* The reason to dismiss Ji Dan and Yi Ya was that they did not love their own bodies, but instead catered to the ruler’s desires. If they did not love their own bodies, how could they love the ruler? Then again, if a subject exhausts his efforts to the point of death for his lord, he also does not love his own body. Guan Zhong intended to say that such a subject should not be employed. If one does not love his efforts to the death, how could he love the ruler? This would mean the ruler is dismissing loyal subjects. Moreover, if one judges that a subject does not love his own body to determine whether he does not love his ruler, then it is as if Guan Zhong were using his own inability to die for Prince Jiu to measure Duke Huan’s inability to die for him. Thus, Guan Zhong himself would also fall into the category of those to be dismissed.

The way of an enlightened ruler is not so. Instead, he sets forth what the people desire to elicit their service, hence offering noble titles and wealth to encourage them. He presents what the people abhor to restrain their deceit, hence establishing penalties and punishments to awe them. If rewards are trustworthy and punishments are certain, then the ruler can raise meritorious deeds among his subjects while their deceit is not tolerated by him. Those who have merit are rewarded, and naturally, the deceitful will not find favor. Even if there were a Ji Dan, what could he do to the ruler?

Moreover, a subject exhausts his efforts to the death to bargain with his ruler, while the ruler bestows titles and wealth to bargain in return. The relationship between ruler and subject is not that of father and son, but rather a matter of calculation and exchange. The ruler assesses the subject’s strength, while the subject assesses the ruler’s offerings. If the ruler is just, then the subject will exert his full strength, and deceit will not arise. If the ruler is unjust, then the subject will, on the one hand, obstruct the ruler’s clarity, and on the other, foster his own private interests.

Guan Zhong did not clearly explain this principle to Duke Huan. He merely suggested dismissing the three men, so it is said: *"Guan Zhong lacked foresight."* When Duke Shengzi was besieged at Jinyang, upon breaking the siege, he rewarded five men for their service, with Gao He as the first among them. Zhang Mengtan said: *"In the matter of Jinyang, He had no great merit, yet you reward him first—why?"* Duke Shengzi replied: *"In the matter of Jinyang, my state was in peril, and the altars of the land were nearly destroyed. My ministers all had thoughts of arrogance and disdain, but only He did not abandon the rites of ruler and subject. Therefore, I honored him first."*

Confucius heard of this and said: *"How well Shengzi knows how to reward! Reward one man, and no subject in the land dares to disregard propriety."*

Some said: *"Confucius does not understand how to reward well."* A truly skilled ruler in rewards and punishments ensures that no official dares to encroach upon another’s duties, and no subject dares to disregard propriety. If the ruler establishes his laws above while the subjects harbor no deceitful intentions below, then this can be called skilled in rewards and punishments. If Shengzi had issued no orders and enforced no prohibitions at Jinyang, then Shengzi would have no state, and Jinyang would have no ruler—who then would guard it?

Now, at Jinyang, Shengzi knew that the Zhi clan had surrounded him, that the mortar and hearth had produced tortoises, yet the people had no thoughts of rebellion. This was the virtue of close bonds between ruler and subject. Shengzi possessed the blessing of harmonious ruler-subject relations and held the methods of issuing orders and enforcing prohibitions, yet there were still subjects who were arrogant and disdainful—this was because Shengzi failed in his punishments.

For a subject, if he rides with his lord and achieves merit, he is rewarded. Now, He merely did not indulge in arrogance and disdain, yet Shengzi rewarded him—this was a misapplication of reward.

The lord had no arrogance, and He alone conformed to the proper conduct of a subject—this was not a case of rewarding virtue without merit.

A wise ruler does not bestow rewards upon those without merit, nor does he impose punishments upon those without guilt. Now Shengzi did not execute the arrogant and disdainful subjects, yet he rewarded He, who had no merit—where then was Shengzi’s proper application of reward?

Hence it is said: *"Zhongni did not know how to properly reward."*

During the time of Duke Ping of Jin, he feasted with his ministers. As the wine flowed freely, he sighed and exclaimed: *"There is no greater joy than being a ruler, for one’s words are never defied!"*

Shi Kuang was seated before him, plucked his zither and struck it against the wall, causing the duke to hastily pull aside his robes and avoid it, while the zither shattered against the wall.

The duke asked: *"Who struck the Master’s zither?"*
Shi Kuang replied: *"Just now, there was a petty man speaking at your side, so I struck it."*
The duke said: *"It was I."*
Shi Kuang said: *"Yǎ!"* (a sound of disapproval). *"This is the sigh of lamentation."*

This was not the speech of a true ruler. The duke’s attendants requested to remove him.
The duke said: *"Release him, and let this be a warning to me."*

Some said: *"Duke Ping lost the Way of the ruler, and Shi Kuang lost the conduct of a subject."*

To punish a subject not for his deeds but for his words—this is how a ruler treats his subject. To not reprove a subject’s words when he fails in conduct, but instead to dismiss him when his good counsel is unheeded—this is how a subject treats his ruler.

Now Shi Kuang did not reprove Duke Ping’s conduct, yet he acted as if to punish him like a ruler. He raised the zither and struck it near his body, thus reversing the proper order of ruler and subject and losing the conduct of a subject.

For a subject, if the ruler has faults, he should reprove them. If his reproof is not heeded, he should lightly regard his rank and salary in awaiting the ruler’s fate—this is the conduct and righteousness of a subject.

Now Shi Kuang did not reprove Duke Ping’s faults, yet he raised the zither and struck it near his body. Even a stern father would not do this to his son, yet Shi Kuang did it to his ruler—this was a most rebellious act.

The subject committed a grave rebellion, yet Duke Ping rejoiced and listened to him—this was losing the Way of the ruler.

Hence, Duke Ping’s actions cannot be clearly justified, for they made the ruler overindulgent in listening and unwise to his faults. Shi Kuang’s conduct also cannot be clearly justified, for it allowed a deceitful subject to seize the opportunity of giving counsel and to adorn the way of assassinating the ruler.

It cannot be said that both were clear in their actions—this was a case of two faults.

Hence it is said: *"Duke Ping lost the Way of the ruler, and Shi Kuang also lost the conduct of a subject."*

During the time of Duke Huan of Qi, there was a recluse named Xiaochén Jì. Duke Huan went to see him five times but could not obtain an audience.

Duke Huan said: *"I have heard that men of humble station do not lightly accept rank and salary, nor can they be exchanged for the lord of a thousand chariots. The lord of a thousand chariots, if he does not cherish virtue and righteousness, also cannot be served by men of humble station."*

Thus, he went a fifth time and finally obtained an audience.

Some said: *"Duke Huan did not know virtue and righteousness."*

Now, virtue and righteousness mean to grieve over the harm of the world and to hasten toward the calamities of a single state, without shunning humiliation—this is virtue and righteousness.

Hence, Yi Yin, seeing China in chaos, became a minister to Tang. Bǎilì Xī, seeing Qin in chaos, became a slave to Duke Mu of Qin. Both grieved over the harm of the world and hastened toward the calamities of a single state, without declining humiliation, and so they were called virtuous and righteous.

Now Duke Huan, with the power of a thousand chariots, descended to a commoner, intending to share in worrying over the state of Qi—but Xiaochén did not comply. This showed Xiaochén’s disregard for the people, and to disregard the people cannot be called virtue and righteousness.

Virtue and righteousness mean not to lose the conduct of a subject, nor to disrupt the proper order of ruler and subject. Therefore, within the four boundaries of the state, those who hold the *huì* (ritual assembly) and attend court are called subjects, while officials and ministers who receive their duties are called *míng* (minions).

Now Xiaochén was among the common people, yet he opposed the ruler’s desires—so he cannot be called virtuous and righteous.

Virtue and righteousness were not in him, yet Duke Huan honored him, allowing Xiaochén to have wisdom and ability while evading Duke Huan—this was to conceal himself.

If one cultivates virtue and conceals himself, he should not be employed as a subject—so it is fitting to punish him. If he had no wisdom or ability yet falsely boasted and flaunted himself before Duke Huan, this was deceit, and he should be put to death.

Xiaochén’s actions were either deserving of punishment or of execution. Duke Huan could not grasp the principle of ruler and subject, yet he honored one who should be punished or executed—this was teaching the people of Qi to treat their ruler lightly and disrespectfully, which was not the way to govern.

Hence it is said: *"Duke Huan did not know virtue and righteousness."*

In the campaign of Mí Jīng, Jin attacked Qi. Mí Jīng was the name of a mountain.

Han Xianzi was about to execute a man, and Zhi Xianzi heard of it. He drove his carriage to save the man, but by the time he arrived, he had already been executed.

Zhi Xianzi then said: *"Why not use him as a sacrificial victim?"*
His servant replied: *"You did not dare to save him earlier, why speak now?"*
Zhi Xianzi said: *"How dare I not separate the slander?"*

Some said: *"Zhi Xianzi’s words should not be lightly examined—this was not separating slander."*

The man whom Han Xianzi executed—if he was a criminal, then he could not be saved, for saving a criminal would cause the law to fail, and if the law fails, the state becomes disordered.

If he was not a criminal, then to encourage him to die as a sacrificial victim or to be used as a sacrificial victim was to compound the injustice—he had already been unjustly executed, and now to make him die as a sacrificial victim was another compounded injustice.

To compound injustice is how the people come to harbor resentment, and if the people resent, the state is in danger.

Zhi Xianzi’s words—if they did not bring about danger, then they caused disorder, and they should not be lightly examined.

Moreover, if the man whom Han Xianzi executed was indeed a criminal, why should Zhi Xianzi separate the slander? If he was not a criminal, then he had already been executed, yet Zhi Xianzi arrived—this was allowing Han Xianzi’s slander to become established, while Zhi Xianzi arrived too late.

When Zhi Xianzi said *"to use him as a sacrificial victim,"* this was insufficient to separate the slander of executing a man, yet it created another slander of sacrificial victims.

The sacrificial victim was not deserving of the injustice, yet another slander was added. This was separating slander.

In ancient times, Zhou executed the *páo luò* (searing punishment), and Chonghou and È Lái said to cut off the shins of those who crossed the river—why should Zhi Xianzi separate the slander of Zhou?

This was aiding in falsehood and adding to the slander.

Moreover, the people’s expectations of their ruler are great. If Han Xianzi could not obtain them, then executing him was not just.

The people also hoped that Zhi Xianzi would succeed. They hoped that Zhi Xianzi would correct Han Xianzi’s faults. Now that Zhi Xianzi has failed in both, the people have lost all hope in their ruler. If the ruler hears of evil deeds, what else can they hope for?

Thus it is said: Zhi Xianzi’s words did not separate slander—they only added to it. Moreover, when Zhi Xianzi went to rescue Han Xianzi from guilt, he deemed Han Xianzi wrong, yet he did not explain why he was wrong, but instead urged him to make a sacrificial offering. This only made Han Xianzi unaware of his own faults.

When a ruler causes the people to lose all hope, and a minister makes another unaware of his mistakes, I do not see how Zhi Xianzi separated slander.

Huan Gong released Guan Zhong from his bonds and made him his chancellor. Guan Zhong said: *"Your servant has been honored, yet I remain lowly."* The duke said: *"Let me place you above Gao and Guo."* Guan Zhong said: *"Your servant is now noble, yet I remain poor."* The duke said: *"Let me grant you a household of three returns."* Guan Zhong said: *"Your servant is now wealthy, yet I remain distant."* Thus, the duke established him as Zhongfu.

Xiao Lue said: Guan Zhong believed that being of low status made him unfit to govern the state, so he requested to be placed above Gao and Guo. He believed that poverty made him unfit to enrich the state, so he requested a household of three returns. He believed that being distant made him unfit to govern the close, so he was given the title Zhongfu. Guan Zhong was not greedy—he sought what would benefit governance.

Some said: If one commands a lowly official like Zang Ge to deliver orders to ministers and officials, none dare disobey. This is not because the ministers are lowly while Zang Ge is honored, but because the ruler’s authority is absolute. If Guan Zhong governed without relying on Huan Gong, that would be disloyal—it would mean issuing his own commands. A state without a ruler cannot be governed. If he relied on Huan Gong’s prestige and issued orders in his name, that is how Zang Ge’s authority would be established. Why wait for the honors of Gao, Guo, or Zhongfu before acting?

In the present age, the *dūchén* (imperial overseers) are lowly officials. When they issue decrees, they do not avoid the noble nor seek the lowly. Though these officials are lowly, when they deliver imperial commands, they are not shunned because of their status. Thus, when their actions are just, even a commoner trusts them as much as a minister. When their actions are unjust, even a high official bows to the will of the people.

Now Guan Zhong did not seek to honor the ruler or clarify the laws, but instead pursued greater honors and titles. This was not Guan Zhong’s greed for wealth and rank—it was his ignorance of proper governance. Thus it is said: Guan Zhong had flawed conduct, and Xiao Lue’s praise was excessive.

**Han Xuan Wang** asked Yue Liu: *"I wish to employ both Gong Zhong and Gong Chu—is this acceptable?"* Yue Liu replied: *"In the past, Wei employed both Lou and Di and lost the Western River. Lou was slow, and Di was treacherous. Chu employed both Zhao and Jing and lost Yan and Ying. Zhao and Jing were two powerful clans. Now, if Your Majesty employs both Gong Zhong and Gong Chu, they will surely compete for influence and seek private gain with neighboring states, showing favor to their own interests. This is called ‘external trade’—it will bring misfortune to the state."*

Some said: *"In the past, Qi Jing Gong employed both Guan Zhong and Bao Shu, and Shang Tang employed both Yi Yin and Zhong Hui. If a ruler employs two ministers, it is a cause for concern in the state. Then Huan Gong would not have become hegemon, and Shang Tang would not have become king."*

The ruler who employed Nao Chi was struck dead in the Eastern Temple, and the ruler who employed Li Dui was starved to death. A ruler with skill will not be troubled by employing two ministers, but one without skill will face contention and private dealings, or even tyranny and assassination. Now Yue Liu, lacking skill, advises the ruler to abandon employing two ministers in favor of one. If he does not face the misfortune of losing the Western River, Yan, or Ying, he will surely suffer the fate of death by starvation. Thus, Yue Liu’s counsel was not wise.

**Difficulties of the Second Kind, No. 37**

Jing Gong passed by Yan Zi’s residence and said: *"Your home is small, near the market. I wish to relocate you to the gardens of Yu Zhang."* Yan Zi bowed twice and declined, saying: *"Your servant is poor and depends on the market for food. I must go there early and late—I cannot live far away."*

Jing Gong laughed and said: *"Your family is familiar with the market—do you know what is expensive and what is cheap?"* At that time, Jing Gong was excessive in his punishments, so Yan Zi replied: *"Sandals are expensive, and shoes are cheap."* Jing Gong asked: *"Why?"* Yan Zi answered: *"Because punishments are frequent."* Jing Gong then recalled an old man who had returned and said in alarm: *"Am I being tyrannical?"* Thus, he reduced punishments by five.

Some said: Yan Zi’s claim that sandals were expensive was not sincere—he only wanted to use this excuse to stop the excessive punishments. He was questioned and responded without deep thought. In a disordered state, the issue is not whether punishments are excessive but whether they are just or unjust. This is the danger of failing to discern proper governance.

Punishments, when just, should not be many; when unjust, they should not be few. Even if few, unjust punishments are still excessive. To argue that punishments are too many without considering their justice is the flaw of lacking skill. Armies defeated in battle are punished by the thousands and hundreds, yet they still do not stop fleeing. If punishments for restoring order are applied as if fearing they are insufficient, yet evil persists, then Yan Zi’s argument—focusing only on the number of punishments—is reckless.

To spare even the lowly grass harms the grain harvest. To show kindness to thieves harms the virtuous. Now, if one relaxes punishments and practices leniency, it benefits the wicked and harms the good. This is not the way to govern.

**Qi Huan Gong**, after drinking to excess, lost his hat and was ashamed, refusing to attend court for three days. Guan Zhong said: *"This is not a disgrace for a ruler. Will Your Majesty not rectify it through governance?"* The duke said: *"I will make it right."* He then opened the granaries, gave alms to the poor, reviewed the prisoners, and pardoned minor offenders. After three days, the people sang:

*"Oh Duke, why not lose your hat again?"*

Some said: Guan Zhong removed Huan Gong’s disgrace from the eyes of the common people, only to create a greater disgrace among the virtuous.

To compel **Huan Gong** to open the granaries and give alms to the poor, to review the prisoners and pardon minor offenders—this is not righteousness, nor can it be used to atone for disgrace. If righteousness must be performed only after the loss of one’s hat, then **Huan Gong**’s righteousness was not for the sake of his hat. Though this may atone for the disgrace of losing the hat in the eyes of the common people, it also leaves the disgrace of unrighteousness upon the virtuous.

Moreover, opening the granaries and giving alms to the poor is to reward those without merit. Reviewing prisoners and pardoning minor offenders is to fail to punish wrongdoers. To reward without merit, the people will grow lazy and hope for favors from above; losing the hat brings alms, so they always hope to lose the hat again. To fail to punish wrongdoers, the people will not be deterred and easily turn to wickedness—this is the root of chaos. How can it atone for disgrace?

In ancient times, **Wen Wang** encroached upon **Meng**, subdued **Jū**, and seized **Fáng**, three acts of aggression that made **Zhòu** detest him. **Wen Wang** then grew fearful and requested to be granted the land of **Luò Xī** and the state of **Chì Rǎng**, both of which were a thousand *lǐ* in extent, in exchange for lifting the punishment of *páo luò* (searing with fire and boiling in oil). All under heaven rejoiced. **Confucius** heard of this and said: *"How virtuous was **Wen Wang**! He lightly gave up a thousand *lǐ* of land to lift the punishment of *páo luò*. How wise was **Wen Wang**! By yielding a thousand *lǐ* of land, he won the hearts of all under heaven."*

Some said: *"Confucius deemed **Wen Wang** wise, but was he not mistaken?"* The wise know the places of calamity and avoid them, so their persons are not harmed. Was it because **Wen Wang** failed to win the hearts of the people that **Zhòu** hated him? Then even if he sought the people’s hearts to lift the hatred, it would still be acceptable. **Zhòu** hated him because he had gained the hearts of the people, yet **Wen Wang** again lightly gave up land to win their hearts—this only deepened their suspicions. It was inevitable that he would be bound and imprisoned in **Yǒu Lǐ**. The elder **Cháng** of **Zhèng** once said: *"To embody the **Dao**, one must act without imposing one’s will."* This was most fitting for **Wen Wang**, as it would not make the people suspect him. Confucius deemed **Wen Wang** wise, but his reasoning did not reach this level.

**Píng Gōng** of **Jìn** asked **Shù Xiàng** (Chuzi): *"In ancient times, **Huan Gong** of **Qí** united the nine **Hú** (clans) and rectified the **Dao** under heaven. Was this the power of the ruler, or the power of his ministers?"* **Shù Xiàng** replied: *"Guan Zhong was skilled at apportioning, while **Bīn Xū Wú** was not skilled at cutting and sewing—his words on increasing or decreasing were like those of a woman’s needlework, mending seams. **Zhì Péng** was skilled at pure embroidery—his words on embellishment were like those of a woman’s embroidery. When the garment was finished, the ruler raised it and wore it—this was also the ministers’ power, what power did the ruler have?"*

**Shì Guān** (the Blind Musician) struck his *qín* (zither) and laughed. The duke asked: *"Master **Shì Guān**, why do you laugh?"* **Shì Guān** replied: *"I laugh at **Shù Xiàng**’s response to Your Majesty. For one who serves as a minister, it is like a cook blending flavors and presenting them to the ruler. If the ruler does not eat them, who dares to force them upon him? Let me illustrate: the ruler is the soil, the ministers are the plants. Only when the soil is fertile can the plants grow luxuriantly—this is the ruler’s power, what power do the ministers have?"*

Some said: *"Both **Shù Xiàng** and **Shì Guān** spoke with partiality. To unite the nine **Hú** and rectify the **Dao** under heaven was the greatest achievement, not solely the ruler’s power nor solely the ministers’ power. In ancient times, **Gōng Zhī Qí** served **Yú**, and **Xī Nég Jiān** served **Cáo**—though both ministers were wise, their words struck true, and their deeds were effective, yet **Yú** and **Cáo** both perished. Why was this? It was because they had ministers but lacked rulers. Moreover, **Jiǎn Shū** served **Gān** and **Gān** perished, then served **Qín** and **Qín** became dominant—this was not because **Jiǎn Shū** was foolish toward **Gān** and wise toward **Qín**, but because **Qín** had a ruler while **Gān** lacked ministers. If it was not the ministers’ power, then why did **Huan Gong** prosper with Guan Zhong but decline with **Zhù Diào**? If it was the ruler’s power, then why did **Zhòu** not bring chaos when **Zhù Diào** served him?"*

In ancient times, **Wén Gōng** of **Jìn** admired the beauty of a **Qí** woman and forgot his duty to return. **Jiù Fàn** (Ziang) and **Qī Fàn** (Ji Fan) repeatedly remonstrated him, so he was able to return to **Jìn**. Thus, **Huan Gong** united the **Hú** through Guan Zhong, while **Wén Gōng** became dominant through **Jiù Fàn** and **Qī Fàn**—yet **Shì Guān** still said it was the power of the ruler. It is not so!

In the case of the five **Bá** (Hegemons), their ability to achieve success and renown under heaven was always due to both the ruler and the ministers having power. Therefore, it is said that both **Shù Xiàng** and **Shì Guān** spoke with partiality.

During the time of **Huan Gong** of **Qí**, a **Jìn**ese guest arrived. The officials requested permission to accord him proper rites, and **Huan Gong** said: *"I have three things to tell **Zhòng Fù** (Guan Zhong)."* The officials repeatedly asked, and each time, he said: *"Tell **Zhòng Fù**."* The jester laughed and said: *"How easy it is to be a ruler! The first thing is **Zhòng Fù**, the second thing is **Zhòng Fù**, and the third is **Zhòng Fù**. **Zhòng Fù** is the name of a musician—*yōu*, *pái yōu*, and *lè* (ease, leisure, and music)."*

**Huan Gong** said: *"I have heard that a ruler labors in seeking the people and rests in employing them. I already found **Zhòng Fù** with great difficulty—after obtaining him, why should it not be easy?"*

Some said: *"What **Huan Gong** answered the jester was not the speech of a ruler. If being a ruler means laboring in seeking the people, then why is seeking the people laborious? **Yī Yǎn** (Yi Yin) considered himself a minister serving **Tāng** (King Tang), while **Bǎi Lǐ Xī** (Bai Li Xi) considered himself a captive serving **Mù Gōng** (Duke Mu). Captives endure humiliation, and ministers bear shame—yet they endure these to serve their sovereigns. This is the urgent concern of the worthy for the world. Therefore, a ruler need only not oppose the worthy, and seeking the worthy is not difficult for a sovereign. Moreover, offices and ranks are established to employ the worthy, and titles and rewards are given to honor merit. When offices and ranks are set forth and titles and rewards displayed, the worthy will come of their own accord—what labor is there for the ruler? Employing the people is also not what brings ease, for a sovereign must employ them with measures and standards, using laws and punishments to guide their actions. If they conform to the law, they proceed; if they do not, they stop."*

If deeds match their words, reward them; if not, punish them.
Use laws and punishments to restrain ministers, and measures and standards to govern the people below.
This is not to be neglected—how then can a ruler find rest?

Seeking the worthy is not labor, employing the people is not ease, yet Duke Huan said, *"I labor in seeking the worthy and find ease in employing the people."* This is incorrect.

Moreover, Duke Huan obtaining **Guan Zhong** was not difficult—Guan Zhong did not die for his former lord before serving Duke Huan, and **Bao Shu** lightly relinquished his office and talents to entrust him. That Duke Huan obtained Guan Zhong was clearly not difficult.

After securing Guan Zhong, why should he have changed so swiftly?

Guan Zhong was not **Zhou Gong Dan**, who ruled as regent for seven years for King Cheng, passing authority when the king came of age—not for the sake of the world, but for his duty.

He who does not seize the throne while the heir lives would never abandon a dead lord to serve his enemy. One who abandons a dead lord to serve his enemy would never hesitate to seize the throne while the heir lives. One who does not hesitate to seize the throne while the heir lives would never hesitate to usurp his lord’s state.

Guan Zhong was a minister of **Prince Jiu**, plotting to assassinate Duke Huan but failing. His lord died, yet he served Duke Huan—his choices cannot be compared to Zhou Gong Dan’s.

If Guan Zhong were a great worthy, he would have been like **Tang** and **Wu**, who were ministers of **Jie** and **Zhou**. When Jie and Zhou rebelled, Tang and Wu overthrew them. Now Duke Huan sits in their place, acting as Jie and Zhou did over Tang and Wu—Duke Huan is in danger.

If Guan Zhong were unworthy, he would have been like **Tian Chang**, a minister of Duke Jian of Qi who killed his lord. Now Duke Huan sits in his place, as Duke Jian did over Tian Chang—Duke Huan is again in danger.

Guan Zhong was clearly not Zhou Gong Dan, yet whether he was like Tang and Wu or Tian Chang remains uncertain. Serving as Tang and Wu brought the peril of Jie and Zhou; serving as Tian Chang brought the chaos of Duke Jian.

After obtaining **Companion Zhong**, where could Duke Huan find safety?

If Duke Huan trusted Guan Zhong and knew he would not deceive him, then Guan Zhong was a minister who would not deceive his lord. Yet even if he knew Guan Zhong would not deceive him, Duke Huan entrusted him so completely that he relied on **Fian Dao** and **Yi Ya**, letting corpses rot unburied while maggots crawled from them—Duke Huan clearly did not know whether his ministers deceived him or not. Yet he trusted them so utterly, hence the saying: *"Duke Huan abandoned his lord."*

**Li Dui** governed Zhongshan, where the **Erling** officials submitted excessive reports of revenue. Li Dui said:
*"Eloquent speech that, when heard, does not conform to righteousness is called **tiao speech**—a hasty, deceitful thing.
Revenue without the benefits of mountains, forests, marshes, or valleys is called **tiao wealth**—a fraudulent abundance.
A gentleman does not listen to **tiao speech** or accept **tiao wealth**. You may now withdraw."*

Some said: *"Master Li framed his words thus: 'Eloquent speech that, when heard, does not conform to righteousness is called **tiao speech**. Eloquence lies in the speaker, persuasion in the listener—speech is not the listener, so eloquence is not persuasion. What is meant by "not conforming to righteousness" does not necessarily mean the listener must be blamed for what he hears.

The listener is either a petty man or a gentleman. A petty man has no righteousness and cannot measure it; a gentleman measures it and would not be persuaded by deceit.
When it is said that eloquent speech, when heard, does not conform to righteousness, it must be insincere speech.
Revenue without effort is not to be trusted—it is excessive, like **li** or **yang**, both meaning "abundant and unnatural."
Though revenue is excessive, what can be done?
If one attends to the harmony of yin and yang in undertakings, plants trees in accordance with the seasons, avoids early or late planting, and prevents cold or heat disasters, then revenue will be abundant.
If one does not let minor tasks hinder major duties, does not let private desires harm public affairs, if men fully engage in farming and women diligently weave, then revenue will be abundant.
If one attends to the principles of breeding livestock and understands the suitability of the land, if the six kinds of livestock thrive and the five grains flourish, then revenue will be abundant.
If one is skilled in strategy and familiar with terrain, if boats, carriages, and machines allow minimal effort for maximal gain, then revenue will be abundant.
If one facilitates commerce at markets and passes, can exchange what one has for what one lacks, if merchants come and foreign goods remain, if expenditures are frugal, clothing and food are moderated, and palaces and tools are sufficiently provisioned without indulging in luxuries, then revenue will be abundant.
All abundance comes from human effort.
If the heavens act rightly—wind and rain timely, cold and warmth balanced—and the land does not expand, yet there are years of plenty, then revenue will be abundant.
Human effort and natural work—both bring abundance, not the benefits of mountains, forests, marshes, or valleys.
To call revenue without such benefits **tiao wealth** is ignorant speech.

**Zhao Jianzi** besieged the outer walls of **Wei**, with **xi shields** and **xi rams** placed where arrows and stones could reach. Jianzi used the rams as pillows and lay down himself.
When the drums sounded, the soldiers did not rise. Jianzi threw down his embrace and said: *"Alas, my soldiers are exhausted!"*
The **Chengren** **Zhu** passed by in his **fu helmet** and replied: *"I have heard that it is not only the soldiers who are exhausted—it is also the lord’s inability to use them.
In the past, our ancestor **Xian Gong** conquered seventeen states and subjugated thirty-eight. He won twelve battles—this was the people’s strength.
When Xian Gong died, Duke Hui ascended, indulging in licentiousness and violence, favoring concubines, and letting Qin encroach until we retreated seventeen *li*—this too was the people’s strength."*

When Duke Hui died, the **Wen Gong** succeeded him. He besieged **Wei** and took **Yè**, and at the **Chéngpú Battle**, he defeated the **Jīng** five times, earning a name of honor throughout the lands—this too was the strength of the people.

Yet there are also rulers who cannot use them—soldiers are not exhausted.

Thus, **Jianzi** removed the **xi shields** and **xi rams**, standing where arrows and stones could reach. When the drums sounded, the soldiers charged, and they won a great victory.

**Jianzi** said: *"Gaining a thousand chariots of armored troops is not as valuable as hearing the words of the **Chéngren Zhu**."*

Some said: *"The **Chéngren** has not yet explained how this is so. He spoke of Duke Hui’s defeat through these people and Wen Gong’s hegemony through them, yet he has not shown how one should use them.

A ruler who can reward generously and punish decisively does not necessarily abandon the shields and stand personally where arrows and stones fly. **Jianzi** cannot yet swiftly remove the **xi shields** either.

**Yán Qīn** was surrounded, yet he lightly risked arrows and stones—this is what a filial son does for his parents. A filial son risks arrows and stones to save his parents because of love. Among a hundred filial sons, only one would dare to risk arrows and stones to save his parents. Among a hundred men, none would risk arrows and stones to save their parents—this is how rare filial piety truly is.

Now, if one assumes that when a man’s own body is in danger, others can still fight, then all the sons of the hundred clans above would be excellent filial sons who love their parents—this is the **Chéngren’s** falsehood. Those who can be filial to their parents are already rare, one in a hundred. How much rarer would they be in serving their lord among the hundred clans?

This is false.

All men love profit and hate harm. If rewards are heavy and trustworthy, men will lightly risk battle. If punishments are severe and certain, men will not retreat even when defeated. Leading troops, hundreds will not fail once. Men universally love profit and fear punishment.

A general who leads troops does not act beyond what all men naturally do, yet he achieves the feat of never losing a man among a hundred—men do not yet know the **Dao** of using troops.

The Duke Mu of Lu asked Zǐsī, saying: *"I have heard that the son of the Páng□ clan is unfilial—how was his conduct?"*

Zǐsī replied: *"A noble man honors the worthy to elevate virtue and commends the good to inspire the people. As for faults in conduct, these are matters known to the vulgar. I do not know."*

When Zǐsī left, Zǐfú Lì Bó entered and was asked about the son of the Páng□ clan. Zǐfú Lì Bó answered: *"His faults are three—all things the Duke has never heard of."* From that time onward, the Duke held Zǐsī in high regard while demeaning Zǐfú Lì Bó.

Some said: *"The Lu royal house was seized by the Jì clan for three generations—was this not inevitable? A wise ruler seeks the good and rewards it, seeks deceit and punishes it—this is how one attains it. Those who report the good are those who delight in aligning with the ruler’s virtue. Those who report deceit are those who delight in aligning with the ruler’s malice. This is where praise and reward exert their force. Both reporting the good and reporting deceit should be rewarded. Not reporting deceit is to differ from the ruler while secretly aiding the wicked below—this is where blame and punishment should apply. Now, Zǐsī did not report the faults, yet the Duke honored him, while Lì Bó reported deceit, yet the Duke demeaned him. Men universally prefer honor and despise disgrace, so the Jì clan’s rebellion flourished unchecked, and this was not reported to the Duke—this is how the Lu rulers were overthrown. Moreover, this was the custom of the ruined kings, the reason the people of Qǔ and Lu took pride in it, yet the Duke alone honored it—was this not perverse?"*

When Duke Wén fled, Duke Xiàn sent the palace attendant Bì to attack him at Púchéng. Bì severed his sacrificial vessel, and Wén fled to Zhì. When Duke Huì ascended the throne, he again sent Bì to attack him at Huìdòu, but failed. When Wén returned to the state, Bì sought an audience.

The Duke said: *"At Púchéng, the order was for one night’s stay, yet you arrived immediately. At Huìdòu, the order was for three nights, yet you arrived in one—how could you be so swift?"*

Bì replied: *"The Duke’s command was unchanging: to remove the Duke’s evils. If I could not endure that, what were the people of Pú and Zhì to me? At that time, the Duke was a man of Pú and Zhì, with no subject’s duty toward him—what were they to me? Now that you have ascended the throne, are you not like Pú and Zhì?"*

Moreover, Duke Huán of Qí placed Shègōu as minister to assist Guān Zhòng. The Duke received him. Some said: *"The houses of Qí and Jìn were extinguished—was this not inevitable? Duke Huán could use Guān Zhòng’s merit and forget the grudge of Shègōu. Duke Wén could heed the palace attendant’s words and abandon the crime of severing the sacrificial vessel. Huán and Wén could contain these two men. Later rulers were not as enlightened as these two, and later ministers were not as virtuous as these two. Disloyal ministers served unclear rulers. If the ruler did not know, there were Yàn Cāo and Zǐyú. There were Zǐhǎn and Tián Cháng’s treachery. If the ruler knew, he would use Guān Zhòng or the palace attendant to resolve it. The ruler would certainly not punish them, yet would take credit for the virtue of Huán and Wén—this is to harbor enmity while failing to discern clearly, relying on borrowed resources. If one assumes virtue without caution, even without heirs, is this not enough?"*

Moreover, the palace attendant’s words were merely a pretense of loyalty. When the Duke’s command was unyielding, this was loyalty to the Duke. To serve a later ruler after the Duke’s death without shame and yet still claim loyalty—this is not true loyalty unless one dies for it. Now, Huì died in the morning and served Wén in the evening—how could the palace attendant’s loyalty be measured?

A man set up a hidden trap for Duke Huán, saying: *"One danger, two dangers, three dangers—what are they?"* Duke Huán could not shoot, so he told Guān Zhòng. Guān Zhòng replied: *"The first danger is to favor jesters while distancing the worthy. The second danger is to exile the state’s people to the seas. The third danger is to delay naming a heir until the ruler is old."*

Duke Huán said: *"Good."* Without waiting for an auspicious day, he performed the ancestral rites to install the heir.

Some said: *"Guān Zhòng’s hidden trap was not achieved. The use of ministers does not depend on proximity or distance. Jesters and dwarves are naturally what a ruler enjoys with his guests. To favor jesters while distancing the worthy and call this governance is not truly difficult. To hold power yet fail to use what one possesses, and to not abandon the state when it is in turmoil—this is to restrain a whole state with one man’s strength. One who restrains a whole state with one man’s strength will rarely prevail. A ruler who can illuminate distant deceit and perceive hidden treachery, and whose orders are carried out, even if the ministers are distant as the seas, the state will surely have no internal rebellion. Thus, exiling the state’s people to the seas without rebellion is not truly difficult."*

King Chéng of Chǔ installed Shāng Chén as heir, yet also wished to install Gōngzǐ Zhí. Shāng Chén rebelled and killed Chéng. Gōngzǐ Zhāi, the son of the Zhou heir, and Gōngzǐ Gēn, who was favored, rebelled in the Eastern lands, splitting into two states. These were not the evils of delaying the heir.

If power is not divided, the lesser branches are humble, and favor is without basis, even if one is a high minister, delaying the heir is acceptable. Thus, delaying the heir while the lesser branches do not rebel is not truly difficult.

What is truly difficult is to borrow others’ strength to establish one’s own position without allowing it to harm oneself—this may be called the first danger. To not allow concubines to become two queens—this is the second danger. To not allow favored sons to endanger the legitimate heir, and to listen solely to one minister without daring to corner the ruler—this is what may be called the third danger.

Yè Gōngzǐ Gāo asked Confucius about governance. Confucius said: *"Governance lies in pleasing the near and attracting the distant."* Duke Aí of Lu asked Confucius about governance. Confucius said: *"Governance lies in selecting the worthy."* Duke Jǐng of Qí asked Confucius about governance. Confucius said: *"Governance lies in regulating expenditures."*

When the three rulers left, Zǐgōng asked: *"The three rulers asked the Master about governance, yet the Master’s answers differed—why was this?"*

Confucius said:
*"The city of Yè has a vast capital but a small state, and its people harbor disloyalty in their hearts. Therefore, governance lies in pleasing the near and attracting the distant—this is to teach the people to cherish favors. When governance relies on kindness alone, those without merit receive rewards, while those guilty escape punishment. This is why such laws fail. When laws fail, governance descends into chaos, and chaos leads to the ruin of the state and the people. This is not something one should pursue.

Moreover, if the people harbor disloyalty, it is because the ruler’s wisdom has its limits. If one does not emulate Yè Gōng’s clarity yet still advocates pleasing the near and attracting the distant, it is like abandoning the means by which one could restrain them, instead competing with kindness to win their hearts—this is not the way of one who can wield authority.

Even the virtue of Yáo, the most sagacious of the Six Sovereigns, could not prevent Shùn from seizing power and encompassing all under his rule. If a ruler lacks the means to restrain his subjects yet relies on Shùn’s virtue to retain his people, is this not a lack of means?

A wise ruler detects minor deceits before they grow, so the people dare not hatch grand conspiracies. He punishes small crimes before they fester, so the people dare not commit great rebellions. This is what is meant by addressing difficulties in their earliest forms and great matters in their smallest beginnings.

Now, if those with merit are always rewarded, the rewarded will not feel gratitude toward the ruler—they will see it as the result of their own efforts. If those who commit crimes are always punished, the punished will not harbor resentment toward the ruler—they will see it as the natural consequence of their deeds. When the people recognize that punishments and rewards stem solely from their own actions, they will strive for personal gain rather than accept favors from the ruler. Even the lowest of subjects may possess this understanding. How then can one speak of a people who cherish kindness?

A wise ruler’s subjects face no conflicts of interest. If one advocates pleasing the near and attracting the distant, it is better to abandon such counsel. Duke Aí of Lu had ministers who blocked outsiders from approaching and internally conspired to deceive their ruler, causing the ancestral temples to go unmaintained and the sacrificial rites to be neglected—these were undoubtedly his three ministers. Yet Confucius advised him to *select the worthy*, not to assess their actual deeds, but to choose those whom he personally deemed worthy. If Duke Aí had known of his three ministers’ external obstruction and internal deceit, they would not have lasted a single day in power. Since Duke Aí did not truly *select the worthy* but instead chose those he subjectively deemed worthy, the three ministers were able to hold their positions.

Yān Zǐ Guǎ was deemed worthy by his son but not by Sūn Qīng, and so he met his end in disgrace. Fú Chā was wise in appointing Guān Pí but foolish in trusting Zhū Xú, and thus his kingdom was extinguished by Yùe. Duke Aí of Lu did not need to *know the worthy*—yet Confucius advised him to *select the worthy*, risking the same fate as Fú Chā and Yān Zǐ Guǎ.

A wise ruler does not personally promote his ministers; instead, they advance through mutual recommendation. He does not claim personal virtue; instead, merit is demonstrated through deeds. One observes them in office, tests them in action, and evaluates them by their results. Thus, ministers govern impartially without favoritism, concealing neither the worthy nor advancing the unworthy. If this is so, why should the ruler labor over *selecting the worthy*?

Duke Jǐng of Qí bestowed estates of a hundred chariots, yet Confucius advised him to *regulate expenditures*—this would prevent the ruler from indulging in the extravagance of a Wèi Zhī while alone practicing frugality above, yet still risking poverty. If a ruler feeds his mouth and belly from a thousand *lǐ* of land, even Jié and Zhòu would not dare be extravagant. The state of Qí spanned three thousand *lǐ*, yet Duke Huán of Qí nourished himself from half of it—this was more extravagant than Jié and Zhòu, yet he became the leader of the Five Hegemons, for he understood the balance between excess and restraint.

If a ruler cannot restrain his subjects, it is called *banditry*. If he cannot adorn his inferiors while adorning himself, it is called *chaos*. If he cannot regulate his inferiors while regulating himself, it is called *poverty*.

A wise ruler ensures no one holds private gain, punishing those who deceive to eat. Those who exhaust their strength in service and return profit to the ruler will surely be heard, and those heard will surely be rewarded. Those who act in filth for private gain will surely be known, and those known will surely be punished. Thus, loyal ministers exhaust themselves for the public, commoners exert their strength for their families, and officials strive to the utmost for their superiors, refining themselves in integrity and frugality.

Duke Jǐng’s extravagance was not the state’s calamity. Even if he were as extravagant as this, it would not be the state’s calamity—so long as governance follows these principles. Therefore, advising him to *regulate expenditures* was not his most urgent concern.

With a single response to the three rulers, all three could have been free of calamity—this is what is meant by *knowing the people*. If one knows the people clearly, one restrains them in their earliest transgressions. If one restrains them in their earliest transgressions, deceit will not accumulate. If deceit does not accumulate, there will be no internal conspiracies. If there are no internal conspiracies, public and private interests will be distinct. If public and private interests are distinct, factions will disperse, and the evils of external obstruction and internal conspiracy will vanish.

If one knows the people clearly, one will discern their sincerity. If one discerns their sincerity, punishments and rewards will be clear. If punishments and rewards are clear, the state will not be impoverished. Therefore, it is said: *With one response, the three rulers would have been free of calamity—this is what is meant by knowing the people.*

Hán Zǐ wrote that Duke Huán’s extravagance, though comparable to Jié and Zhòu, did not diminish his virtue, and he immortalized this in his writings as a lesson—how utterly contrary to reason! That he did not meet his end in the Qin prisons may well have been due to this.

Zǐ Chǎn of Zhèng, as he left his palace in the morning, passed through the district of the rope-makers and heard a woman weeping. He patted his charioteer’s hand and listened closely. After a while, he sent an official to arrest and question her, and it was revealed that she had strangled her husband.

The next day, his charioteer asked: *"How did you know?"*
Zǐ Chǎn replied: *"Her voice was one of fear."*

In general, when people are with those they love, they first worry when they fall ill, fear when they face death, and grieve when they are gone. Now, this woman wept not in grief but in fear over one already dead—this is how I knew she had committed a crime.

Some said: *"Zǐ Chǎn’s governance was surely overzealous."*

「If one relies on personal wisdom rather than established laws and measures, one is indeed said to be overzealous. When crime must await the reach of one’s ears and eyes before it is known, then the number of criminals detected in Zhèng would surely be few.

Not entrusting officials with fixed responsibilities—*典* (diǎn) meaning "master" or charge—is to hold them solely accountable for results without regard for proper procedure. Not discerning the systematic governance of *参伍之政* (cānwǔ zhī zhèng), failing to uphold just standards of *度量* (dùliàng), and instead depending on sheer cleverness to outthink and detect crime—is this not a sign of lacking true skill?

Moreover, though the world is vast and human understanding limited, few cannot overcome many, nor can limited wisdom fully grasp all things. Thus, one must govern by aligning with the inherent nature of things—like using the *Dragon* to subdue *scaled insects* or the *Fèng* (phoenix) to control *winged birds*. When the multitude below is vast and the few above are limited, the few cannot fully know the many—so one must rely on people to understand people. Thus, the body need not labor while governance is effective, and wisdom need not be strained to detect crime.

Hence, the saying of the people of Sòng goes: *"If a sparrow flies past Yì (the legendary archer), he will surely hit it,"*—but this is false. Though Yì was skilled in archery, he could not always hit two sparrows in flight, so the claim is exaggerated. If he spread a net across the entire world, then no sparrow would escape. Likewise, detecting crime requires a vast net—one must not miss even a single instance. If one neglects proper governance and instead uses one’s own limited perception as bow and arrow, then Zǐ Chǎn’s judgment was indeed false.

Lǎo Zǐ (Laozi) said: *"To govern the state with cleverness is to be a thief to the state."*—This surely refers to Zǐ Chǎn.

Qín Zhāo Wáng (King Zhao of Qin) asked his attendants: *"Now, how do Hàn (Han) and Wèi (Wei) compare in strength to when they first rose?"*
His attendants replied: *"They are weaker than before."*
*"Now, how do Wèi Qi (魏齐) and Hàn Kāng (韩康) compare to the former Mèngxiáng (孟尝) and Máng Kuàng (芒卯)?"*
They answered: *"They are not as strong."*
The King said: *"Yet Mèngxiáng and Máng Kuàng, though powerful, could not harm me. Why should Hàn and Wèi now?"*
His attendants replied: *"Indeed so."*
Zhōngqī (中期) then plucked his zither and spoke: *"Your Majesty’s assessment of the world is mistaken. When the Six Jìn (六晋) were at their height, Zhī (知) was the strongest, annihilating Fàn (范) and Zhōngxíng (中行), then joining Hàn and Wèi to attack Zhào (赵), drowning their city—only three walls remained above water before it sank. Zhī Bó (知伯) led the charge, with Wèi Xuān Zǐ (魏宣子) driving the chariot and Hàn Kāng Zǐ (韩康子) as the side-riding officer. Zhī Bó said: ‘At first, I did not know water could destroy a state, but now I do.’ He declared, ‘The Fén Shuǐ (汾水) could drown Ānyì (安邑), and the Jiàng Shuǐ (绛水) could drown Píngyáng (平阳).’ Wèi Xuān Zǐ elbowed Hàn Kāng Zǐ, and Kāng Zǐ stepped on Xuān Zǐ’s feet—their elbows and feet met atop the chariot—yet Zhī was divided at Jìnyáng (晋阳) below. Though you are strong now, you are not yet as mighty as Zhī was. Though Hàn and Wèi are weak now, they are not yet as helpless as they were at Jìnyáng below. This is the time when the world is using elbows and feet to harm one another—may Your Majesty not alter this course."*

Some said: *"King Zhao’s inquiry was indeed mistaken, and his attendants’ and Zhōngqī’s responses were also flawed. In governing a state, a wise ruler must rely on its inherent strength. If that strength cannot be harmed, then even the mightiest cannot prevail against it—how much less could Mèngxiáng, Máng Kuàng, Hàn, or Wèi? If that strength can be harmed, then unworthy men like Wèi Qi and Hàn Kāng, or even Hàn and Wèi themselves, could still inflict damage. Thus, whether harm is done or not depends solely on oneself—why ask at all? If one depends on the belief that one cannot be harmed, then what difference does it make whether strong or weak? To ask how one can be harmed while relying on that belief is fortunate indeed."*

Shēn Zǐ (申子) said: *"To lose through calculation and seek through trust is to invite suspicion."*—This surely refers to King Zhao.

Zhī Bó had no restraint—he followed Hàn Kāng and Wèi Xuān, plotting to drown their state with water. This is why Zhī Bó’s state fell and he met his death, his head made into a drinking cup. Now King Zhao asks who is stronger, as if he fears those who might use water against him. Though his attendants are not the sons of Hàn and Wèi, how could there be matters of elbows and feet, yet Zhōngqī says not to change the course? This is empty talk.

Moreover, Zhōngqī’s position as keeper of the zither and bells—if the strings are out of tune and his playing unclear—then his duty is misplaced. This is how Zhōngqī served King Zhao. Though Zhōngqī was skilled at fulfilling his role, he did not satisfy the King, yet he spoke of what he did not truly know—was this not reckless?

His attendants answered that Hàn and Wèi were weaker now and did not match the former Mèngxiáng and Máng Kuàng—this was acceptable. But when they said *"Indeed so"* (甚然), it was flattery.

Shēn Zǐ said: *"Governance should not exceed one’s authority; even if one knows, one should not speak."* Now Zhōngqī, though unknowing, still spoke of it. Hence, it is said that King Zhao’s question was mistaken and his attendants’ and Zhōngqī’s responses were all flawed.

Guān Zǐ (管子) said: *"When one sees what can be praised with clear evidence and what can be punished with visible form, if rewards and punishments are given based on what is seen, even what is unseen will dare not be done. When one sees what can be praised without clear evidence and what can be punished without visible form, if rewards and punishments are not given based on what is seen, and one seeks to govern what is unseen, it cannot be achieved."*

Some said: *"In grand halls and formal courts, all are reverent. In private chambers alone, even trusted ministers like Zēng (曾) and Shǐ (史) may grow lax. Observing what makes people reverent is not a true measure of conduct. Furthermore, rulers above are often adorned by those below. If one’s likes and dislikes are shaped by what is seen, then ministers will surely embellish crimes to deceive their lord. Even a wise ruler cannot penetrate distant deceit—if one waits to observe their polished behavior before determining rewards and punishments, will this not lead to flaws in governance?"*

Guān Zǐ said: *"Speak of governance in the chamber and fill the chamber with its virtue; speak of it in the hall and fill the hall with its virtue—this is how one becomes the sovereign of the world."*

Some said: *"What Guān Zǐ means by ‘speak of governance in the chamber and fill the chamber with its virtue’ is not merely about idle words of feasting and amusement—it must refer to great matters. For a ruler, the greatest matters are not mere cleverness but the laws and measures themselves. Laws are the codified records and statutes set in official halls and disseminated among the people."*

「The *术* (art of governance) is what is kept hidden within one’s breast, used to align with myriad circumstances and subtly control the ministers. Hence, laws must be made manifest, while *术* should remain concealed.

Therefore, a wise sovereign speaks of laws, and even the humblest within the court knows them—it is not just those in the hall who are filled with their virtue. When employing *术*, even those closest and most beloved cannot hear it, so they cannot fill the chamber. Yet Guān Zǐ still says, *"speak of governance in the chamber and fill the chamber, speak of it in the hall and fill the hall,"*—this is not the speech of laws and *术*.

**Difficulties, Chapter Four, Part Thirty-Nine:**
When Sūn Wénzǐ of Wèi visited Lǔ, the Duke of Lǔ ascended the carriage with him. Chū Sūn Mùzǐ hurried forward and said, *"When the feudal lords meet, my lord has never allowed the Duke of Wèi to precede him. Now you do not yield even one rank to my lord, and I do not know what offense you have committed—pray, restrain yourself for a moment."*

Sūn Wénzǐ gave no reply, nor did he show any sign of remorse. Mùzǐ withdrew and told others, *"Sūn Wénzǐ will surely perish. A subject who does not yield to his lord, yet persists in his offense without repentance, is the root of ruin."* Some said, *"When a feudal lord loses the Dao/Way, the feudal lords punish him—thus we have Tāng and Wǔ. When a feudal lord loses the Dao/Way, the great ministers punish him—thus we have Qí and Jìn. If a subject punishes his lord, he will surely perish, then Tāng and Wǔ would not have reigned, and Jìn and Qí would not have been established."*

Sūn Wénzǐ was the lord of Wèi, yet when visiting Lǔ, he did not yield to the Duke of Lǔ as a subject should. The subject’s lord had faults, so the subject had cause to act. He did not perish under a lord who had faults, but under a subject who had cause to act—this is not discerning. Lǔ could not execute the great ministers of Wèi, yet the Duke of Wèi did not know how to punish a subject who was deceitful and unrepentant. Sūn Wénzǐ had these two failings, yet as a subject, he perished—his reason for ruin was that he failed to secure his lord’s favor.

Some said, *"The distribution of virtue and power between lord and subject is fixed. If a subject can seize power from his lord, it is because he has gained the favor of the ministers. Hence, one who takes what is not his rightful share will be stripped by the many, while one who declines what is his rightful share will be granted by the people."* Thus, Jié (Jìè) sought the daughter of Mín Shān, and Zhòu (Jiè) demanded the heart of Bǐ Gān, and the world abandoned them. Tāng changed his name by altering his body, and Wǔ received the mandate from Jìn, yet the whole land submitted. Zhào Jié fled to the mountains, and Tián Wài fell in battle, yet Qí and Jìn followed them. Then, the reason Tāng and Wǔ reigned and Qí and Jìn were established was not because of their lords, but because they gained the favor of the people and then treated their lords as such. Now, without having what is rightfully theirs, yet acting as if they already possess it, is to invert virtue and defy the Dao.

To invert virtue leads to the ruin of their undertakings. To defy the Dao gathers resentment. Yet why does the Duke of Lǔ not perceive these causes of ruin and defeat? Yáng Hǔ of Lǔ desired to attack the Sān Guān (Three Great Houses), but failing, he fled to Qí. Duke Jǐng of Qí honored him. Bào Wénzǐ advised against it, saying, *"Do not honor him. Yáng Hǔ was favored by the Jì Shì (House of Jì) and sought to attack Jì Sūn (House of Jì’s descendants). He coveted their wealth. Now you are wealthier than Jì Sūn, and Qí is greater than Lǔ—Yáng Hǔ will surely employ all his deceit."*

Duke Jǐng then imprisoned Yáng Hǔ. Some said, *"A family with a thousand gold pieces, if its son is not virtuous, shows how urgent the people’s pursuit of profit is. Duke Huán of Qí was the foremost of the Five Hegemons (Wǔ Bā), yet he killed his brother to seize the throne—his profit was immense. Between lord and subject, there is no kinship as between brothers. If one seizes power by force and then rules the myriad chariots, enjoying great profit, then which minister would not be like Yáng Hǔ? Matters succeed through cleverness and subtlety, yet fail through bluntness and clumsiness. The ministers have not yet rebelled because their preparations are not yet complete. All ministers have the heart of Yáng Hǔ, yet the lord above does not know—this is cleverness and subtlety. Yáng Hǔ coveted the world and sought to attack his lord—this is bluntness and clumsiness. If Duke Jǐng did not execute Yáng Hǔ for his clumsiness, then Bào Wénzǐ’s advice was in error. The loyalty or deceit of a subject lies in the actions of the lord. If the lord is wise and stern, the ministers will be loyal; if the lord is weak and lenient, the ministers will be deceitful. To know the subtle is wisdom; to show no mercy is sternness. Yet Duke Jǐng did not know of Qí’s clever ministers, yet he punished Lǔ’s instigator of rebellion—is this not reckless?"*

Some said, *"Loyalty and greed differ in their hearts. Thus, Gōngzǐ Mùyí declined the invitation from Sòng, yet Chǔ Shāng Chén killed his father. Zhèng Qùjì gave his younger brother the throne, yet Duke Huán of Lǔ killed his elder brother. Wú Bó united all under him, yet he used the laws of Duke Huán to rule the people—these were all lacking in steadfastness and integrity. Moreover, if a lord is wise and stern, the ministers will all be loyal. Yáng Hǔ caused rebellion in Lǔ, yet failing, he fled, and Qí did not execute him—this is to condone rebellion. A wise lord knows how to execute Yáng Hǔ to quell the rebellion—this is the wisdom of discerning subtleties. The saying goes: *"The feudal lords treat states as kin."* If the lord is stern, Yáng Hǔ’s crime cannot go unpunished—this is the sternness of showing no mercy. Then, executing Yáng Hǔ is the way to make the ministers loyal. Yet Duke Jǐng did not know of Qí’s clever ministers, and thus he discarded the punishment of a clear instigator of rebellion. He blamed what had not yet happened, yet did not punish the obvious crimes—this is reckless. Now, to execute Lǔ’s instigator of rebellion to threaten the ministers with deceitful hearts, yet also to gain the favor of Jì, Mèng, and Shū Sūn, how is Bào Wénzǐ’s advice reversed?"*

When Duke Zhāo of Zhèng intended to appoint Gāo Qúyí as a minister, Duke Jǐng of Zhèng disliked him, and though he repeatedly advised against it, he was not heeded. When Duke Jǐng ascended the throne, fearing that Gāo Qúyí would kill him, on the day of Xīn Mǎo, he assassinated Duke Jǐng and installed his son Dǎn.

The *junzi* (noble ones) said, *"Duke Jǐng knew what he disliked."* Gōngzǐ Yǔ said, *"Gāo Bó will surely be slaughtered—he has repaid evil to an extreme degree."* Some said, *"Gōngzǐ Yǔ’s words are not also reversed? Duke Jǐng’s meeting with misfortune was because he repaid evil too late. Yet Gāo Bó’s dying late was because he repaid evil to an extreme degree. A wise lord does not harbor lingering anger—he has anger, yet does not act upon it, and then he raises it again. Hence, it is said: *"to harbor lingering anger."*」

To harbor lingering anger makes the minister’s crime seem light in calculation, while acting upon it brings peril to the sovereign. Hence, the **Língtái** (灵台) feast—when Duke Wèi of Wèi was enraged yet did not punish, **Chǔ Shī** (褚师) instigated rebellion. The **yú** (鼋) soup—when the **Zhèng** (郑) lord was enraged yet did not punish, **Zǐ Gōng** (子公) assassinated the sovereign.

The *junzi* (noble ones) act upon knowing what they dislike, not to an extreme degree, but to demonstrate its clarity. Though they did not punish, the consequences led to death, thus proving their knowledge of what was disliked, and showing their lack of **quán** (权). The sovereign is not merely insufficient in foresight to avoid calamity—sometimes he is also unable to decide and act. Duke Zhèng saw the evil and the crime yet did not punish, allowing **Qúyí** (渠弥) to harbor resentment and fear death while gambling on luck, so he was not swift in killing. This was because Duke Zhèng’s retribution for evil was not extreme.

Some said: "The one who repaid evil to an extreme degree was the great punishment for minor crimes. The great punishment for minor crimes was the height of **yù** (狱). The disaster of **yù** (狱) did not lie in the act of punishment itself, but in the multitude of those seeking vengeance. Hence, Duke Lì of Jìn exterminated the **Sān Jiāo** (三郄) yet found joy, while **Zhōngxíng** (中行) rebelled. Duke Zǐdōu of Zhèng killed **Bó Jiān** (伯晅) yet consumed the tripod and sparked disaster. King Fú of Wú punished **Zǐ Xú** (子胥), allowing **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) of Yùe to rise as a hegemon.

Thus, Duke Wèi’s exile and Zhèng’s **Líng** (灵) assassination were not due to **Chǔ Shī**’s survival or **Gōngfù**’s (公父) lack of punishment, but because they were not yet deserving of anger yet showed signs of it, not yet deserving of punishment yet held the intent of it. Though anger was justified by their crimes, punishment did not align with public sentiment—what harm could come from lingering resentment?

If one has committed a crime before ascending the throne, yet after taking office punishes past offenses, this is why the **Hú** (胡) of Qí perished. The sovereign’s actions, when carried out by his ministers, still leave lingering consequences—how much more so when a minister acts as the sovereign does?

If punishment is unjust yet done with the intent of thoroughness, it is as if he has made an enemy of the world—then even if he meets his end, is it not deserved?

In the time of Duke **Líng** (灵) of Wèi, **Mǐxí** (弥子瑕) was favored in the state. A **zhùróu** (侏儒) who had seen the duke said: *"My dreams are shallow, my lord."* The duke asked: *"What dream?"* The **zhùróu** replied: *"I dreamed of a stove—this means I will see you."* The duke was enraged and said: *"I have heard that a sovereign’s dreams involve the sun. Why would seeing me be a dream of a stove?"* The **zhùróu** said: *"The sun shines upon all under heaven—no single thing can obstruct it. A sovereign governs the entire state—no one can block his vision. Hence, to see a sovereign, one dreams of the sun.

But a stove, when one person warms himself by it, means others cannot see. Is it that one person warms the sovereign? Then though I dream of a stove, is it not also acceptable?"* The duke said: *"Well spoken."* He then removed **Yōng Kuì** (雍鉏) and demoted **Mǐxí**, employing **Sīkōng Gǒu** (司空狗) instead.

Some said: The **zhùróu** cleverly used dreams to convey the sovereign’s **dào** (道). Yet Duke Líng did not understand the **zhùróu**’s words. Removing **Yōng Kuì**, demoting **Mǐxí**, and employing **Sīkōng Gǒu** meant he discarded what he loved and used what he deemed virtuous. Duke Zǐdōu of Zhèng favored **Qìng Jiàn** (庆建) yet obstructed him; Duke Zǐ Kuài of Yàn favored **Zǐ Zhī** (子之) yet obstructed him. To discard what one loves and use what one deems virtuous does not guarantee that one person will not obstruct the sovereign. An unworthy one obstructing the sovereign is insufficient to harm the virtuous—yet now, without further understanding, the sovereign allows a virtuous one to obstruct himself, and thus he must be in danger.

Some said: **Qū Dào** (屈到) loved **jí** (芰), King Wén of Zhōu loved **chángpú** (菖蒲) and **yú** (菹)—these were not proper flavors, yet both sages esteemed them. The flavors they loved were not necessarily beautiful. Duke Líng of Jìn delighted in **Shēn Wúxù** (参无恤), and Duke Zǐ Kuài of Yàn favored **Zǐ Zhī**—these were not proper ministers, yet both sovereigns honored them. Those they deemed virtuous were not necessarily virtuous. If one honors the unvirtuous as if they were virtuous, it is the same as loving and employing them. If one truly knows virtue and employs it, it differs from using what is loved.

Hence, King Zhuāng of Chǔ employed **Shū Sūn** (叔孙) and became hegemon, while **Shāng Xīn** (商辛) employed **Fèi Zhōng** (费仲) yet perished—these were cases of employing the virtuous yet achieving opposite results. Duke Zǐ Kuài of Yàn, though he employed the virtuous yet acted like one who loved, was still far from **Mǐxí**’s (弥子瑕) folly. Thus, the **zhùróu**’s words were not yet fully understood.

The sovereign obstructed yet did not realize his obstruction—only after seeing it did he know. Thus, he demoted the obstructing minister, which was an act of further understanding. It was said: *"If one does not further understand yet allows a virtuous one to obstruct himself, he must be in danger."* Yet now, with further understanding, even if a virtuous one obstructs him, he will not be in danger.

*End of Chapter 40 of the "Difficulties of Power" (难势) from the* **Hán Fēi Zǐ** (韩非子).

Shēn Zǐ said: *"When the flying dragon rides the clouds and the soaring snake glides through the mist, yet when the clouds disperse and the mist clears, the dragon and snake become like the mole cricket and ant—this is because they have lost their means of ascent. Thus, a virtuous person who bows to one unworthy is because his power is light and his position low. An unworthy person who can subdue the virtuous is because his power is heavy and his position exalted. When Yáo was a commoner, he could not govern even three people, yet when Jié was a sovereign, he could bring chaos to all under heaven. From this, I know that power and position are sufficient to rely upon, yet virtue and wisdom are not sufficient to emulate."*

*Now, a weak crossbow may shoot arrows high, but it is because of the wind’s force. A person of unworthy character yet whose commands are obeyed is because he gains support from the multitude. Yáo taught among the commoners yet the people did not listen, but when he ascended the throne and faced south as sovereign over all under heaven, his commands were obeyed, his prohibitions enforced.* From this, it is clear that virtue and wisdom are not sufficient to subdue the people, yet power and position are sufficient to restrain even the virtuous.

In response, Shēn Zǐ said: *"When the flying dragon rides the clouds and the soaring snake glides through the mist, I do not say that the dragon and snake are without relying upon the power of the clouds and mists. However, if one selects the virtuous yet depends solely upon power, is that sufficient for governance? Then I have not yet seen it. If there is the power of the clouds and mists, yet the dragon and snake cannot ride or glide, it is because the dragon and snake lack the proper talent. Now, Jié and Zhòu ascended the throne and ruled all under heaven, wielding the sovereign’s might as their clouds and mists, yet they could not prevent the world from descending into great disorder—this is because Jié and Zhòu lacked the proper talent. Moreover, if one were to use Yáo’s power to govern the world, how would that differ from Jié’s power, which brought chaos? Power is not something that can necessarily compel the virtuous to use it in accordance with their own nature, nor prevent the unworthy from wielding it. If the virtuous use it, the world is governed; if the unworthy use it, the world descends into chaos. Among human inclinations, the virtuous are few and the unworthy are many, yet with the advantage of power and threat, those who use it to bring chaos outnumber those who use it to govern. Power is inherently conducive to governance yet also advantageous for chaos—thus the Book of Zhou states: 'Do not add wings to a tiger, lest it fly into the city and devour its people.' To ride upon the unworthy yet wield power is to add wings to a tiger. Jié and Zhòu built lofty towers and deep pits to exhaust the people’s strength, and used the torturer’s stake to harm their nature—yet Jié and Zhòu could enforce their four cruelties, for the sovereign’s might lent them wings. If Jié and Zhòu were commoners, they would not even have succeeded once before meeting their execution.’*

*Power nourishes the hearts of tigers and wolves, fostering deeds of violence and chaos—this is the world’s greatest affliction. In the matter of governance and chaos, power has its roots and branches, yet to speak only of power’s sufficiency to govern the world reveals a shallow understanding. A fine horse harnessed to a sturdy chariot, if driven by Zāng Huò, would be laughed at, yet if driven by Wáng Liáng, it would cover a thousand li daily. The chariot and horse are not different, yet one achieves a thousand li while the other is mocked—this shows the vast difference between skill and clumsiness. Now, if we take the state’s position as the chariot, power as the horse, decrees as the reins, and punishments as the whip, then Yáo and Shùn driving it would govern the world, while Jié and Zhòu driving it would bring chaos—this also shows the vast difference between virtue and unworthiness. To seek speed and distance yet not know how to entrust the task to Wáng Liáng, to seek profit and remove harm yet not know how to entrust the task to the virtuous and capable—this is the affliction of not recognizing analogies. Yáo and Shùn are indeed the Wáng Liáng of governance among the people."*

The interlocutor replied: *"If one relies solely on power to govern the state, and insists that governance must await the virtuous, that is incorrect. Power is something that, once established, transforms countless things under a single name. Power must arise from natural circumstances, then there is no need to speak of it as something set by man. What I speak of as power is what man establishes. Now, Yáo and Shùn obtained power and governed, while Jié and Zhòu obtained power and brought chaos—I do not say that Yáo and Jié were incorrect. However, this was not something that a single person could establish. If Yáo and Shùn were born into the sovereign’s position, even with ten Jiés and Zhòus they could not bring chaos—that is power governing. If Jié and Zhòu were born into the sovereign’s position, even with ten Yáos and Shùns they could not govern—that is power bringing chaos. Thus it is said: 'When power governs, chaos cannot prevail; when power brings chaos, governance cannot be achieved.' This is the natural power, not something man can establish. If what I speak of is power that man can wield, then virtue has no role to play! How can one prove this is so?"*

The interlocutor said: *"A man who sells both a spear and a shield praises the shield, saying, 'Its strength is unmatched—nothing can pierce it.' Then he praises the spear, saying, 'My spear’s sharpness is unmatched—nothing it cannot pierce.' When asked, 'If you pierce your shield with your spear, how will it fare?' the man cannot respond. The shield that cannot be pierced and the spear that can pierce anything cannot both be true in name. The power that cannot be restrained by virtue yet the Dao that cannot restrain power—this is the paradox of the spear and shield. It is clear that virtue and power cannot coexist. Moreover, Yáo, Shùn, Jié, and Zhòu emerge once in a thousand generations—this is like comparing shoulders and following footsteps in their birth. The world’s governance does not cease in between. What I speak of as power is the middle ground: those who neither reach the heights of Yáo and Shùn nor descend to the depths of Jié and Zhòu. If one adheres to the law and occupies a position of power, governance is achieved; if one abandons the law and forsakes power, chaos ensues."*

Now to abandon power and forsake the law while waiting for Yáo and Shùn—only when they arrive will governance be achieved—this is to have a thousand generations of chaos followed by one of order. To cling to the law and occupy power while waiting for Jié and Zhòu—only when they arrive will chaos ensue—this is to have a thousand generations of order followed by one of ruin. To have order for a thousand years and ruin for one, or ruin for a thousand years and order for one—this is like riding a swift steed and dividing the reins, the distance between the two being vast indeed.

To abandon the hidden and the measured laws, to discard the standards of measure and number, and yet command Xī Zhòng to forge a chariot—he could not even complete a single wheel. Without rewards to encourage and punishments to deter, relinquishing power and abandoning the law, even if Yáo and Shùn were to persuade at the door and debate with the people, they could not govern even three households. Thus, the efficacy of power is clear, yet to say that one must always await the virtuous is also untenable.

Moreover, to fast for a hundred days waiting for roasted meat is to starve the hungry to death. Now to await the virtue of Yáo and Shùn before governing the people of the present age is like waiting for roasted meat to save the starving—this is absurd.

They say a fine horse and sturdy chariot, yet if Zàng Gé drives it, he will be laughed at, but if Wáng Liáng drives it, he can cover a thousand *lǐ* in a day. I do not accept this. To await a man skilled in swimming from Yuè to save a drowning man from Zhōngguó—even if the Yuè man is skilled in swimming, the drowning man will still perish. To await an ancient Wáng Liáng to drive today’s horses is like the Yuè man’s attempt to save the drowning—its futility is clear.

A fine horse and sturdy chariot, with a relay station every fifty *lǐ*, even an average driver can pursue swiftness and achieve distance—thus, a thousand *lǐ* can be covered in a day. Why must one wait for an ancient Wáng Liáng? Moreover, if driving is not done by Wáng Liáng, then it must be ruined by Zàng Gé. If governance is not achieved by Yáo and Shùn, then it must be ruined by Jié and Zhòu. This is not like sweetening honey with *Lái Tíng* locusts—it is like mixing bitter and sweet without measure. This is a tangled web of arguments and lost reasoning, a debate of two extremes that cannot be reconciled—how can it be used to challenge the principles of governance?

The guest’s arguments did not reach this level of discussion.

**Chapter 41: On Debate**
A questioner asked: *"Where does debate arise?"*
The reply was: *"It arises from the ruler’s lack of clarity."*

The questioner said: *"How does the ruler’s lack of clarity give rise to debate?"*
The reply was: *"In a well-governed state, the most honored words are those of the ruler’s commands, and the most suitable affairs are those governed by law. Words cannot hold two honors, nor can laws serve two purposes—thus, those whose speech and actions do not conform to laws and commands must be prohibited. If there are no laws and commands yet one can deceive, adapt, create profit, and manipulate affairs, the ruler must adopt their words and demand their results. If their words are correct, they receive great rewards; if not, they face severe punishment. Thus, the foolish fear punishment and dare not speak, while the wise have no means to argue—this is why there is no debate."*

In chaotic times, it is not so. When the ruler issues orders but the people criticize them through literature, when officials enact laws yet the people privately alter them, the ruler hesitates in enforcing his laws while honoring the clever actions of scholars—this is why the world sees so much literary debate.

Speech and action must be aimed at practical utility. To sharpen an arrow and shoot at random, though it may strike the finest hair, cannot be called skillful shooting—there is no fixed target. Set a target five *cùn* wide at a distance of ten *bù*, and even Yì and Péng Mén cannot guarantee a hit without a fixed rule. Thus, with fixed rules, Yì and Péng Mén’s precision with a five-*cùn* target is skillful, but without them, hitting a hair by random chance is clumsiness.

Now, if the ruler listens to speech and observes actions without measuring them by public utility, even if the words are meticulously examined and the actions steadfast, it is like shooting at random. Thus, in chaotic times, what is considered perceptive is what is difficult to understand, and what is considered eloquent is vast learning. In observing actions, to withdraw from society is seen as virtue, and to defy the ruler is seen as resistance. The ruler delights in clever and perceptive speech, honors virtuous yet defiant actions—thus, those who establish laws and set standards of conduct, distinguishing between just and unjust arguments, are not corrected. Hence, those wearing scholar’s robes and carrying swords are many, while farmers and warriors are few. Empty, rigid words prevail, and constitutional laws fade away.

Thus it is said: *"When the ruler lacks clarity, debate arises."*

**Chapter 42: On Fields**
Xú Qú asked Tián Jiū:
*"I have heard that wise men do not serve beneath their superiors while seeking a ruler, and sages do not rely on merit to approach their superiors. Yet Yángchéng Yìqú, a capable general, was dismissed by Máo Bó. Gōngsūn Dǎn Huí, a sage advisor, was imprisoned in Zhōubù. Why is this?"*

Tián Jiū replied:
*"There is no other reason—it is because the ruler lacks measure and the sovereign lacks strategy."*

Moreover, have you not heard that the楚 general Sòng Jī lost his position, and the魏 advisor Féng Lí led to his state’s ruin? These two rulers were dazzled by empty words and eloquent arguments, failing to test their generals with Máo Bó or consult their advisors with Zhōubù—thus, they suffered the misfortunes of losing their positions and states. From this, it is clear that without testing by Máo Bó or consulting with Zhōubù, how can this be the preparation of an enlightened ruler?

Tángxī Gōng said to Hán Zǐ:
*"I have heard that observing rituals and practicing humility is the way to preserve oneself. Cultivating conduct and withdrawing wisdom is the path to fulfillment. Now, Master, you establish laws and set measures—yet I privately fear this endangers your person and risks your downfall. How can this be proven?"*

What I have heard from the ancient sovereigns’ strategies is this: *"Chǔ did not use Wú Qǐ, yet its chaos was diminished; Qín implemented Shāng Jūn, yet it became wealthy and strong. Though the words of these two men were correct, Wú Qǐ was dismembered and Shāng Jūn was torn apart by chariot—this was due to their misfortune in not encountering the right age or ruler. Encountering fortune cannot be guaranteed, and misfortune cannot be avoided. To abandon the path of preservation and fulfillment while indulging in perilous and reckless actions—I privately see no benefit for Master in this."*

Hanzi said: *"I fully comprehend Master’s words. Indeed, governing the realm and regulating the people’s livelihood is no simple task. Yet the reason we abandon the teachings of the ancient kings and adopt the methods of a lowly subject is that establishing laws and setting measures is the way to benefit the people and facilitate the common folk’s welfare.

Thus, though we risk the misfortune of serving a chaotic ruler or a dim-witted sovereign, we must still strive to harness the people’s resources for their benefit—this is the conduct of benevolence and wisdom. To fear the misfortune of serving a chaotic ruler or a dim-witted sovereign while avoiding the harm of death, yet neglecting the people’s resources for personal gain, is the behavior of greed and vulgarity. I cannot bear to adopt such vulgarity, nor dare I abandon the path of benevolence and wisdom.

The ancient kings had the intention of rewarding loyal ministers, yet in reality, they often harmed them greatly.

**Chapter 43: On Laws**
The questioner asked: *"Between Shen Buhai and Gongsun Yang, whose teachings are more urgent for a state?"*
The reply was: *"This cannot be measured. If a person does not eat for ten days, they will die; if the extreme cold comes and they have no clothing, they will also die. If asked which is more urgent for a person—clothing or food—then both are indispensable, both being means of sustaining life.

Now, Shen Buhai spoke of *shu* (strategic arts), while Gongsun Yang established *fa* (laws).
*Shu* refers to appointing officials based on their suitability, holding them accountable by their titles, wielding the power of life and death, and assessing the abilities of ministers—this is what the sovereign must grasp.
*Fa* refers to enacting statutes in the offices, ensuring punishments resonate in the people’s hearts, rewarding those who diligently uphold the laws, and punishing those who transgress them—this is what ministers must emulate.

Without *shu*, the sovereign falters above; without *fa*, the ministers rebel below. Both are indispensable, both being tools of imperial rule.

The questioner asked: *"What harm comes from relying solely on *shu* without *fa*, or solely on *fa* without *shu*?"*
The reply was: *"Shen Buhai served Duke Zhao of Han. Han was a branch state of Jin. The old laws of Jin had not yet faded, yet Han’s new laws were already emerging. The orders of the former ruler had not been fully implemented when those of the latter were already issued. Shen Buhai did not monopolize the laws nor unify the statutes, so deceit flourished. Thus, if the benefit lay in the old laws and earlier orders, he would advocate for them; if in the new laws and later orders, he would do the same. When the old and new laws conflicted, and the earlier and later orders clashed, even if Shen Buhai repeatedly urged Duke Zhao to employ *shu*, deceitful ministers would still find ways to manipulate words.

Thus, though Han possessed the strength of a great state, over seventy years passed before it achieved hegemony—because though *shu* was applied above, the laws were not meticulously refined in the offices.

When Gongsun Yang governed Qin, he established collective responsibility among officials and demanded accountability, linked households in groups of five for mutual surveillance, and made rewards substantial yet trustworthy while punishments severe and inevitable. Thus, the people exerted themselves tirelessly without rest, faced enemies boldly without retreat, and so Qin became wealthy and its army strong.

Yet without *shu* to detect deceit, its wealth and strength only benefited the ministers. When Duke Xiao of Qin died and King Hui ascended the throne, Zhang Yi betrayed Qin to aid Han and Wei. When King Hui died and King Wu ascended, Gan Mao betrayed Qin to aid Zhou. When King Wu died and King Zhao Shou ascended, Rang Hou attacked Han and Wei before turning east to assault Qi, yet after five years, Qin gained not an inch of territory and instead fortified the enclosure of Tao. Ying Hou attacked Han for eight years before securing the fief of Ru Nan. Since then, all who served Qin were of the sort like Ying and Rang.

Thus, when Qin won battles, its great ministers grew in power; when it gained land, private fiefs were established. The ruler lacked *shu* to discern deceit. Though Gongsun Yang refined his laws tenfold, the ministers merely exploited those resources. Thus, though Qin rode its strength for decades, it never attained imperial rule—because the laws were not meticulously refined in the offices, and the ruler lacked *shu* above.

The questioner asked: *"If the ruler employs Shenzi’s *shu* while officials implement Shangjun’s *fa*, would that suffice?"*
The reply was: *"Shenzi did not fully master *fa*. Shenzi said: ‘Do not overstep one’s office, even if one knows the truth, one must not speak.’ Governing without overstepping one’s office is acceptable, but knowing the truth yet remaining silent is not speaking out against wrongdoing. The sovereign, with the vision of a single state, sees clearly; with the hearing of a single state, hears keenly. If one knows yet remains silent, how can the sovereign rely on such counsel?

Shangjun’s laws stated: ‘For every severed head, one advances a rank; for those desiring office, they must achieve the rank of five *dan* (bushels of grain stipend). For two severed heads, one advances two ranks; for those desiring office, they must achieve the rank of one hundred *dan*. Thus, promotions in office correspond to the merit of severed heads.’ Now suppose there is a law: ‘Those who sever heads shall become physicians or artisans.’ Then houses would remain unfinished and illnesses would not be cured. Artisans are skilled with their hands, while physicians administer medicines. Yet applying the merit of severed heads to these roles is mismatched to their abilities.

Now, governing officials requires wisdom and ability, yet severing heads is a matter of courage and strength. Applying the merit of courage and strength to govern officials of wisdom and ability is like assigning those who sever heads to become physicians or artisans. Thus it is said: *Both Shenzi and Gongsun Yang were imperfect in their mastery of law and strategy.*

**Chapter 44: Resolving Doubts**
In governing broadly, it is not merely about rewards and punishments being just. Rewarding those without merit or punishing the innocent is not true clarity. Rewarding the meritorious and punishing the guilty without error is already within human capability—it is not what generates merit or stops wrongdoing.

Thus, the highest method of preventing deceit is to regulate the heart; the next is to regulate speech; the next is to regulate actions."*

**Chapter 44: Resolving Doubts (continued)**

Nowadays, all speak of honoring the sovereign and securing the state through *virtue/power* (仁義), wisdom, and ability, yet they fail to recognize that those who debase the sovereign and endanger the state also rely on *virtue/power* (仁義), wisdom, and ability. Therefore, the sovereigns of the Dao/Way distance themselves from *virtue/power* (仁義) and wisdom, and instead govern through law.

Thus, their reputation spreads wide and their name commands awe, the people are well-ordered and the state secure—this is because they know the method of using the people. All *strategy* (术) is what the sovereign employs to enforce control; law is what officials model themselves upon. Yet, if even the *ministers* (郎中) of the court daily hear the Dao/Way outside the palace gates, and if commoners within the borders daily see the law, this is not truly difficult.

In ancient times, the House of You had *Huxu* (有扈氏) who lost proper measure, *Gongtou* (讙兜氏) with a lone male heir, the *Sanmiao* (三苗) had *Chengju* (成驹), *Jie* (桀) had *Houchi* (侯侈), *Zhou* (纣) had *Chonghouhu* (崇侯虎), and *Jin* (晋) had *You Shi* (优施). These six were ministers who brought ruin to their states.

To affirm what is false and deny what is true, to harbor internal treachery against their lord, to feign prudence while plotting harm, to distort righteous paths and pursue private gain—these are the actions of ministers who cling to their lord while undermining his governance, who favor inferiors while scheming against superiors. They do not hesitate to employ external forces to disrupt internal affairs. Such ministers, though *ancient sage-kings* (先古圣王) could not endure them, are yet found in this age. Who would dare use them?

As for *Guan Longfeng* (关龙逢), *Wangzi Bidang* (王子比干), *Sui Jiliang* (随季梁), *Chen Xie* (陈泄冷), *Chu Shenxu* (楚申胥), and *Wu Zixu* (吴子胥)—these six ministers all fiercely contended and gave strong counsel to their lords, even when it meant opposing them. If their words were heeded and their deeds followed, they acted like teacher and disciple. But if their words were not heard and their actions not taken, they would assail their lord with reproach, and even lay down their lives to prove their point. Though their families might be destroyed and their limbs scattered, they would not falter. Such ministers, even *ancient sage-kings* (先古圣王) could not tolerate them. In this age, who would dare employ them?

Yet there were *Xu You* (许由), *Xu Ya* (续牙), *Jin Boyang* (晋伯阳), *Qin Dian* (秦颠颉), *Wei Qiao* (卫侨如), *Hufuji* (狐不稽), *Chongming* (重明), *Dong Bulijie* (董不识), *Bian Sui* (卞随), *Wu Guang* (务光), *Bo Yi* (伯夷), and *Shu Qi* (叔齐)—these twelve ministers, though, all saw no joy in personal gain, nor fear in facing danger. Some refused the offer of the world even when given to them, and though they bore the name of suffering humiliation, they did not delight in the pleasures of grain. To see no joy in gain, even if the lord bestows lavish rewards, he cannot sway them. To face danger without fear, even if the lord applies harsh punishments, he cannot intimidate them. These are called *uncommandable* (不令) subjects.

These twelve perished—some buried alive in caves, others withered to death in the wilderness, some starved in mountains and valleys, others drowned in streams and springs. Even *ancient sage-kings* (先古圣王) could not make them their ministers; in this age, who would dare use them?

Now, there were *Zhou Huazhi* (周滑之), *Zheng Wangsun Shen* (郑王孙申), *Chen Gongsun Ning* (陈公孙宁), *Yi Xingfu* (仪行父), *Jing Gan* (荆竿) *Yin Shenhai* (尹申亥), *Sui Shaoshiji Yue* (随少师越), *Zhong Gan* (种干), *Wu Wangsun E* (吴王孙额), *Jin Yang Chengxie* (晋阳成泄), *Qi Shu Tiao* (齐竖刁), and *Yi Ya* (易牙)—these twelve ministers all sought petty gain while disregarding law and *virtue/power* (義). When advancing, they concealed the virtuous and the able, casting shadows upon their lord. When in retreat, they sowed chaos among the officials, bringing calamity. They all aided their lord and shared his desires; if they gained even a single word of favor from the king, they would not hesitate to destroy the state and slaughter the people.

Even if such ministers were under a *sage-king* (圣王), there would still be fear of losing them; how much more so under a feeble and disordered lord, who could avoid such ruin? Those who serve thus are all met with death and the downfall of their states, becoming the laughingstock of the world. Hence, *Zhou Weigong* (周威公) was killed and his state divided in two; *Zheng Ziyang* (郑子阳) was killed and his state split into three; *Chen Linggong* (陈灵公) died at the hands of *Xia Zhengshu* (夏征舒氏); *Criminal King Ling* (刑灵王) perished on the *Ganxi* (乾溪) plain; *Sui* (随) was extinguished by *Jing* (荆); *Wu* (吴) was swallowed by *Yue* (越); *Zhi Bo* (知伯) was annihilated beneath *Jinyang* (晋阳); and *Huan Gong* (桓公) lay unburied for seven days.

Thus it is said: *Flatterers and sycophants are known only by sage-kings, while disordered lords draw them near—hence, they lead to death and the ruin of the state.*

Thus, the sage-kings and enlightened rulers act differently: when recommending officials from within, they do not spare their kin; when recommending officials from without, they do not spare their enemies. If one is worthy, they promote him; if one is unworthy, they punish him. Therefore, the virtuous advance while the wicked retreat, and with a single act they can bring the feudal lords into submission.

Consider their records: Emperor Yao had Dan Zhu, yet Shun had Shang Jun; Emperor Ku had Wu Guan, King Tang had Tai Jia; King Wu had Guan and Cai. These five kings’ condemned subjects were all their own close relatives—yet why did these kings destroy their bodies and break their families? Because they harmed the state, injured the people, and violated the laws.

Observe whom they raised: some were found among the mountains, forests, marshes, and caves; others were in prisons, shackled in chains and ropes; still others were engaged in butchering, chopping firewood, feeding cattle, or slaughtering oxen. Yet the enlightened rulers did not shame them for their lowly status, for their ability could illuminate the laws, benefit the state, and aid the people—thus they were promoted, securing their own safety and exalted reputation.

Disordered lords act otherwise: they do not understand their ministers’ intentions or actions, yet entrust them with the state. Thus, the lesser ones suffer name and territory erosion, while the greater ones see their states perish and their lives end—all because they fail to discern how to use their ministers.

They have no measure to judge their ministers, only relying on the common people’s praise or blame. If the crowd praises one, they delight in him; if the crowd condemns one, they resent him. Hence, ministers who shatter families and harm their lords, foster internal factions and ally with external cliques to earn favor, secretly conspire to strengthen their own positions, and falsely bestow ranks and riches upon one another—saying:

*"Those who aid me shall I benefit, those who oppose me shall I harm."* The crowd, greedy for gain and intimidated by power, follows their lead. If they truly rejoice, they can profit themselves; if they harbor grudges and anger, they can harm themselves. The people flock to them while the citizens abandon their lords, filling the state with their praise. When this reaches the ruler, he cannot discern their true motives and thus deems them virtuous.

These ministers further employ cunning deceivers: outwardly, they pretend to be favored envoys of the feudal lords, provided with carriages and horses, entrusted with auspicious symbols and seals, bolstered by eloquent arguments, and supplied with wealth and silks. They make the feudal lords indulge in flattery, subtly advancing private agendas under the guise of public discourse.

The envoys they send are rulers of other states, and the advisors they employ are the ruler’s own attendants. The inner and outer factions speak in unison with the ruler’s entourage, using the same insinuating words. The greater ones do not hesitate to humble themselves and exalt their positions to serve them, while the lesser ones offer high ranks and abundant wealth to secure their loyalty.

When wicked ministers hold heavy ranks and gather more factions, they become even more rebellious and persuasive, saying:

*"What the ancients called sage-kings and enlightened rulers were not those who merely upheld seniority or weakness, nor those who followed order. Rather, they were those who fostered factions, gathered allies, and overthrew their lords to seize power for themselves."*

They ask: *"How do you know this?"* And the answer comes:

*"Shun overthrew Yao, Yu overthrew Shun; Tang exiled Jie, King Wu attacked Zhou; these four rulers were ministers who killed their lords, yet the world praises them. Examine their motives: they were driven by greed for power. Assess their actions: they wielded violent and chaotic forces. Yet these four rulers, through their broad strategies, earned the world’s acclaim as great. Through their self-promotion, they were honored as enlightened. Thus, their power was sufficient to dominate the world, their influence enough to overshadow all—so the world followed them."*

They further say:

*"In our time, we hear of Tian Chengzi taking Qi, Si Chengzi Han taking Song, Tai Zai Xin taking Zheng, the Shans taking Zhou, Yi Ya taking Wei, and the three sons of Han—Wei, Zhao, and Jin—dividing Jin. These six men were ministers who killed their lords and seized states. Wicked ministers, hearing this, furrow their brows and raise their ears, believing it true. Thus, they foster internal factions and seize external cliques, gauge the times to act, and with a single stroke take the state. Moreover, within they use factions and threats to kill their lords, and without they exploit the feudal lords’ favor to arrogantly undermine their states. They hide their true intentions, manipulate justice, suppress their lords, and obstruct the officials—such cases are innumerable. Why is this? Because the lords fail to discern how to choose their ministers."*

The records state:

*"Since the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, tens of states have perished, and many ministers have killed their lords to seize power—half the ruin comes from within, half from without. Even those who exhaust all the people’s strength to destroy states and kill their lords are still counted as virtuous rulers. But those who pervert the laws, alter their positions, preserve the people while ruining the state—these are the most grievous afflictions of all.*

For a ruler, if he truly understands his ministers’ words, then even if he indulges in hunting, racing chariots, striking bells, and dancing girls, his state may yet endure. If he does not understand his ministers’ words, then even if he practices frugality, toils diligently, wears coarse cloth, and eats simple food, his state will still perish.

Take the case of Zhao’s ancestral lord, Jing Hou: though he did not cultivate virtue or conduct, he loved unrestrained indulgence, seeking comfort for his body and pleasure for his senses. In winter, he exhausted himself with hunting; in summer, he wallowed in licentiousness. He spent nights reveling, feasting for days without pause, and had wine poured into the mouths of those who could not drink. He beheaded those who failed to bow properly or respond with reverence. Yet, despite such excessive living and wanton punishment, Jing Hou ruled his state for decades, his armies never faltered against enemy states, his lands never diminished by neighboring powers. Within, there was no disorder among the sovereign and his hundred officials; without, no troubles from the feudal lords or neighboring states. He understood how to employ his ministers.*

The lord of Yan, Zi Kuai, a descendant of Shao Gong Si, controlled thousands of square miles of land and commanded tens of thousands of soldiers. Yet he did not seek the pleasures of his children, nor did he listen to the sounds of bells and chimes. Within, he did not indulge in filth or pollute his halls and pavilions; without, he did not exhaust himself with hunting or falconry. Instead, he personally worked the unharvested fields to improve the irrigation. His labor for the people and his care for the world were so profound that even the ancient sage-kings and enlightened rulers could not match his diligence."*

Yet Zi Kuai died and his state perished, seized by his son, and the world mocked him. Why was this so? Because he did not understand how to employ his ministers.

Thus it is said: There are five forms of deceit among ministers, yet the ruler does not know them. For those who rule, there are those who lavishly spend wealth and bribes to gain favor, those who indulge in feasts and rewards to sway the masses, those who cultivate factions and flatter clever scholars to arrogantly assert themselves, those who grant pardons and absolve crimes to wield their authority, and those who flatter the common people with extravagant speech and grand attire to dazzle their senses. These five are what the enlightened ruler suspects, and what the sage sovereign prohibits.

Abandoning these five, then deceitful schemers dare not stand respectfully to speak, and those whose words exceed their deeds—those who do not conform to the law—dare not falsely claim loyalty to discuss matters. Thus, the ministers, when at rest, cultivate their virtue, and when in action, fulfill their duties. Without the ruler’s command, they dare not act rashly in speech or falsely in deed. This is how the sage-king shepherds his ministers.

The sage sovereign and enlightened ruler do not probe their ministers with suspicious objects. If there is no retraction when suspicion is raised, such cases are rare in the world.

Thus it is said: A concubine may have a son resembling the heir, a secondary wife may have a concubine resembling the primary wife, a courtier may resemble the chancellor, and a minister may be favored like the ruler himself. These four are the dangers of a state.

Thus it is said: When inner favorites rival the queen, when outer favorites rival the prime minister, when illegitimate sons rival the heir, and when great ministers rival the ruler, these are the paths to chaos. Therefore, the *Zhou Records* states: Do not exalt concubines while belittling wives, do not exalt illegitimate sons while belittling the heir, do not exalt mediocre ministers while equating them to high-ranking officials, nor exalt great ministers to rival their ruler. If these four parallels are broken, then the ruler has no schemes and the subjects have no strange notions. If these four parallels are not broken, then the ruler’s person and state will perish.

The forty-fifth chapter of *Guai Shi* states: The three principles by which the Sage governs are: *li* (benefit), *wei* (authority), and *ming* (reputation). Benefit is what gains the people; authority is what enforces commands; reputation is the shared path of ruler and subjects. Without these three, even the most urgent matters may be neglected.

Now, though benefit exists, the people are not transformed; though authority exists, the subjects do not obey; though offices have laws, governance does not align with reputation. Though these three exist, why does the world alternate between order and chaos?

The ruler’s cherished rewards contradict what he uses to govern. Establishing titles is meant to distinguish rank, yet those who slight their superiors and avoid audiences are called virtuous. Authority and benefit are meant to enforce commands, yet those who disregard benefit and scorn authority are called weighty. Laws are meant to govern, yet those who disregard laws for private gain are called loyal. Offices and ranks are meant to encourage the people, yet those who seek fame and avoid office are called heroic. Punishments are meant to wield authority, yet those who scorn laws and avoid capital crimes are called brave.

The people’s obsession with reputation is extreme, and their pursuit of benefit is thus—how could those who hunger and suffer not endure hardship to vie for reputation in the world? Therefore, the reason the world is disordered is not the fault of the subjects; the ruler has lost his Way.

He constantly values what brings chaos while devaluing what brings order. Thus, the desires of the subjects are always contrary to what the ruler uses to govern.

Now, if a subject obeys his ruler, the ruler’s priority is clear. Yet those who are sincere, upright, and single-hearted are called destitute. Those who uphold the law, obey commands, and judge carefully are called foolish. Those who respect their ruler and fear punishment are called cowardly. Those who speak appropriately and act moderately are called unworthy. Those without private schemes or secret learning, who listen to officials and follow instruction, are called vulgar. Difficulty in granting is called upright. Difficulty in giving is called virtuous.

«Difficulty in restraint is called *Qí* [齐]. To have a decree yet not listen or comply is called *yǒng* [勇]. To lack profit for one’s ruler is called *yuàn* [愿].

To have few desires and broad benevolence, practicing *virtue/power* [德] in moderation, is called *rén* [仁]. To be grave, dignified, and self-respecting is called *zhǎngzhě* [长者].

To study privately and form groups is called *shītú* [师徒]. To dwell in quietude and repose is called *yǒusī* [有思]. To forsake *virtue/power* [仁] and pursue profit is called *jí* [疾].

To be treacherous, impulsive, and fickle is called *zhì* [智]. To act for others before oneself, to be widely loved and called *shèng* [圣], and to embrace all under Heaven with universal compassion is called *shèng*.

To speak of the great principles yet be impractical, and to act contrary to the world, is called *dàrén* [大人]. To hold low rank yet remain unyielding to one’s ruler is called *jié* [杰].

If those below gradually act thus—within, they disturb the people; without, they cause inconvenience. The ruler ought to restrain their desires and erase their traces, yet does not. Instead, he honors them, thus teaching those below to disrupt and those above to be misled for the sake of harmony.

What governs the realm is *punishment* [刑罚], yet those who practice private *righteousness/virtue* [义] are now honored. The state’s stability depends on *tranquility and order* [安静], yet those who are impulsive, treacherous, and flatterers are entrusted.

Within the four borders, obedience stems from *trust and virtue/power* [信与德], yet those who are deceitful, scheming, and subvert are employed. Decrees are enacted, and authority is established through *reverence, frugality, and listening to one’s ruler* [恭俭听上], yet those who dwell in rigid, unworldly ways are exalted.

The granaries are filled through the fundamental labor of *farming* [耕农], yet those who engage in *luxurious embroidery and trivial scribblings* [綦组锦绣刻书] are deemed prosperous. Renown is achieved, and cities are fortified through *warriors* [战士], yet those who are orphaned and starving beg at the Way’s side, while idle drinkers and sycophants ride in carriages and wear silk.

*Rewards and stipends* [赏禄] are meant to exhaust the people’s strength and ease their deaths, yet those who conquer and take by force labor without receiving due reward, while those who practice divination, read omens, and engage in petty fortune-telling are granted lavish praise.

The ruler wields the *measures and standards* [度量] to monopolize the power of life and death, yet those who uphold the measures and standards wish to serve with loyalty yet are not permitted to be seen, while those who employ clever speech and profit-driven arguments to deceive the world are repeatedly favored.

To adhere to the law with direct speech, to ensure punishments correspond to crimes, to follow the *plumb line and ink line* [绳墨], and to exterminate the wicked—this is how the ruler governs, yet such officials are increasingly distanced.

Those who flatter, curry favor, and follow desires to endanger the world are kept close. All taxes and labor are exacted to prepare for difficulties and stock the granaries, yet soldiers flee their duties, conceal their service, and take refuge under powerful patrons to avoid *corvée taxes* [傜赋], numbering in the tens of thousands of whom the ruler knows nothing.

Indeed, the fields and houses are granted to *encourage warriors and soldiers* [战士卒], yet those who are dismembered and left to rot in the wild have no home to shelter them, and their bodies die while their lands are seized.

Meanwhile, concubines and favored women, great ministers and courtiers without merit, select houses to dwell in and fields to eat from.

Rewards and profits originate solely from the ruler, whom they monopolize, yet warriors of integrity gain no office, while idle officials are held in esteem. If the ruler teaches thus, how can rank remain noble? How can position remain secure?

Those who hold low rank yet scorn the law are those who do not follow decrees, harbor *doubt* [二心], and lack private study, yet rebel against the world. If the ruler does not restrain their actions or dismantle their factions, but instead honors them, the officials are at fault.

The reason *shame and propriety* [廉耻] were established was to bind those below. Now, scholars and officials do not blush at filth or disgrace yet seek office, and women of private virtue enter official doors without proper order.

Honorable titles and rewards are meant to be grave, yet warriors who fight with merit are poor and lowly, while sycophants and idle favorites receive promotions.

*Sincere names and trustworthy reputation* [名号诚信] are meant to spread authority, yet the ruler conceals and obstructs them.

Close associates and favored women move freely together, and ministers control appointments and transfers of others. The officials are at fault.

Great ministers and officials conspire with those below, comparing strategies even if they do not act according to the law. Though their *virtue/power and profit* [威利] lie with the people, the ruler is debased while the ministers grow heavy.

Indeed, the purpose of establishing laws and decrees is to abolish private schemes. When laws and decrees are enforced, private ways are abolished. Private schemes are the source of disorder, yet scholars have *doubt* [二心], study privately in secluded places, harbor deep schemes, and either oppose the world or mislead those below—some grandly, some subtly.

If the ruler does not restrain them but instead honors those who transform *names into reality* [以名化之以实], this is how the idle gain prominence and the unworthy grow rich.

Thus, scholars with *doubt* [二心] will inevitably harbor deep schemes, feign knowledge, and slander laws and decrees to seek their own ends, opposing the world.

All who disrupt the ruler and rebel against the world are scholars with *doubt* [二心]. Therefore, the original saying declares: What brings order is the law; what brings chaos is private scheming. When the law is established, none can act privately.

Thus it is said: Those who follow the *Dao/Way* [道] of private scheming bring chaos; those who follow the *Dao/Way* [道] of the law bring order. If the ruler lacks the *Dao/Way* [道], then the wise have private arguments, and the virtuous have private intentions.

When the ruler has private favors, those below have private desires. Groups of *sages and clever schemers* [圣智] arise, crafting words and arguments to oppose the law and present them to the ruler. If the ruler does not restrain them but instead honors them, this teaches those below not to listen to the ruler or follow the law.

Thus, the virtuous gain renown yet remain distant, while the wicked rely on rewards to grow rich. The virtuous gain renown yet remain distant, while the wicked rely on rewards to grow rich—this is how the ruler is overcome by those below.»

「Thus, the ruler’s authority is undermined by those below, and the state falls into chaos.

**Original Context (for continuity):**
The ruler who fails to govern with strict standards and just punishments invites rebellion. When clever schemers manipulate the ruler, the virtuous withdraw, the wicked prosper, and the state collapses—**this is how the ruler is overcome by those below.**»

「To fear death is difficult, yet those who submit to defeat are called *honorable* by the world as "men who cherish life." Those who study the Dao and establish doctrines are *renegades* who abandon the law, yet the world honors them as "scholars of literature." Those who wander and live in luxury, seeking food, are *parasites* of the people, yet the world honors them as "men of talent." Those who twist their words to gain knowledge are *deceitful*, yet the world honors them as "men of eloquence and wisdom." Those who wield blades to assault and kill are *brutish and reckless*, yet the world honors them as "men of daring valor." Those who shelter criminals and harbor deceit are *deserving of death*, yet the world honors them as "men of integrity."

These six types of people are those whom the world praises.

Yet those who rush into danger and die for their convictions—*men of righteous resolve*—the world scorns them, calling them "fools who lack calculation." Those who hear little but follow orders, upholding the law, are *law-abiding* people, yet the world scorns them as "crude and unsophisticated." Those who labor with strength to earn their food are *productive* people, yet the world scorns them as "men of limited ability." Those who are upright and pure in conduct, yet live in humble circumstances, are *honest and thrifty*, yet the world scorns them as "fools in appearance." Those who value life and ponder matters carefully are *respectful* of their superiors, yet the world scorns them as "cowardly and intimidated." Those who thwart criminals and suppress deceit are *wise* in serving their superiors, yet the world scorns them as "men who provoke slander."

These six types of people are those whom the world condemns.

The six *deceitful and harmful* types bring no benefit, yet the world praises them as such. The six *virtuous and useful* types contribute to wealth and strength, yet the world condemns them as it does. This is what is meant by *Six Reversals*.

Commoners follow private gain and are praised accordingly; rulers heed empty reputation and honor them in turn. Where honor is bestowed, advantage follows. The people follow private harm and denounce them; rulers are ensnared by common opinion and degrade them. Where degradation is imposed, harm follows.

Thus, titles and rewards are given to those who act from private malice and deserve punishment, while condemnation and harm are inflicted upon those who act from public virtue and should be rewarded. Seeking to enrich and strengthen the state in this way is impossible.

The ancients had a saying: "To govern is like washing hair—though some hair may be discarded, the act must be performed." They loved the expense of discarding hair but forgot the benefit of long hair, not understanding the principle of *balancing priorities*.」

The **plucking of boils** is painful, and **taking medicine** is bitter. Yet, because of the weariness from suffering, if one does not pluck the boils nor take the medicine, the body will not recover and the disease will not cease.

Now, when **superiors and inferiors** interact, there is no **filial affection** as between father and son, yet they wish to use **moral conduct** to restrain inferiors. This will inevitably lead to **obstruction** in their relations.

Moreover, when **parents** regard their **children**, they rejoice if a son is born and kill the daughter if one is born. These both come from the parents’ embrace, yet the son receives praise while the daughter is slain—because they consider the future **convenience** and calculate **long-term advantage**. Thus, even **parents** treat their children with **self-interested calculation**, yet **clay figures** have no filial affection?

Now, scholars in discussing **rulers** all abandon the **heart of seeking advantage** and advocate the **Dao of mutual love**, demanding that rulers exceed **parents’ love** for their children. This is a **misunderstanding of the principles of恩 (benevolence) and诈 (strategic deception)**, hence a **slanderous accusation**. Therefore, **enlightened rulers** do not accept it.

The **Sage’s governance** relies on **clear laws and prohibitions**. If laws and prohibitions are manifest, then **officials and institutions** will be established. If **rewards and punishments** are not **partial**, then the people will **comply**.

When **officials govern well**, the state grows **wealthy**, and wealth brings **strong armies**, thus completing the **achievements of a霸王 (Hegemon-King)**. The **Hegemon-King** is the **greatest advantage** for a ruler. When a ruler **holds this advantage** to govern, his **appointment of officials** is based on **merit**, and his **rewards and punishments** are without **partiality**.

If the people **understand this clearly** and **exert their utmost strength** even unto death, then **military victories and noble titles** can be secured, and when **titles and wealth** are attained, the **pursuit of prosperity and honor** is fulfilled. **Prosperity and honor** are the **greatest advantages** for subjects. When subjects **hold this advantage** in their endeavors, they **face dangers even unto death**, their **strength is fully expended**, and they **do not harbor hopes of personal gain**.

This is why it is said: **"If the ruler is not仁 (benevolent), the subject is not忠 (loyal), then one cannot achieve the Hegemon-King’s glory."**

**Deceit must be known** to **prepare defenses**, and **must be punished** to **stop its spread**. If it is **unknown**, then deceit **flourishes**; if it is **not punished**, then deceit **persists**.

If **light valuables** are displayed in **secluded places**, even **Zengzi and Shiyin** might **doubt them**. If **a hundred gold pieces** are hung in the marketplace, even **great thieves** will not take them. If deceit is **unknown**, then **Zengzi and Shiyin** might **doubt the valuables** in secluded places; if it is **known**, then **great thieves** will not take the gold hung in the marketplace.

Therefore, in **enlightened governance**, the ruler **multiplies vigilance** and **heightens penalties**, ensuring the people **comply with laws** rather than **halt from廉 (moral scruples)**.

**Mothers love their children more than fathers**, and **fathers’ commands** carry **ten times the weight** of **mothers’ affection**. **Officials’ authority** over the people **exceeds even that of fathers**, for their commands are **a million times stronger**.

**Mothers accumulate affection** while their **commands are exhausted**; **officials employ威严 (awe and majesty)**, and the people **obey**. Thus, the **strategies of威 (awe) and爱 (affection)** can be **resolved** accordingly.

Moreover, when **parents** seek **advantages** for their children, they **act to ensure their safety and prosperity**, and **guide them to avoid crimes**. When **rulers** regard the people, they **demand their deaths** in times of **difficulty** and **exhaust their labor** for **peace and stability**.

**Parents** use **deep affection** to **bind their children** to **safety and prosperity**, yet the children **disobey**. **Rulers** use **no affection** but **demand the people’s deaths and labor**, yet their **commands are followed**. **Enlightened rulers** understand this, so they **do not cultivate benevolent affection** but **augment the power of awe and majesty**.

Thus, when **mothers’ love is excessive**, their children **often fail**; this is **excessive affection**. **Fathers’ love is sparse**, yet their **discipline with penal rods** produces **many virtuous children**; this is **strict governance**.

Now, when **household members** manage their **property**, they **endure hunger and cold** together, **strengthen themselves** through **bitter toil**. Even if they **encounter military conscription or famine**, those who enjoy **warm clothes and fine food** are **certainly from a harmonious household**. If they **share concern in clothing and food**, and **extend kindness in leisure and joy**, yet in times of **famine or disaster** they **sell wives and children**, these are **certainly from a broken household**.

Thus, **law as the Dao** brings **immediate suffering** yet **long-term advantage**. **Benevolence as the Dao** offers **temporary pleasure** but **ultimate ruin**. The **Sage weighs the light and heavy**, **discards minor advantages**, and **pursues the greatest benefit**—therefore, he **applies the law’s discipline** while **abandoning the people’s reliance on benevolence**.

Scholars’ words all speak of **"light punishments"**, but this is the **method of chaos and destruction**. The **essential nature of rewards and punishments** is to **encourage good and restrain evil**.

**Generous rewards** make what is **desired swiftly attainable**, and **severe punishments** make what is **prohibited urgently avoided**. Those who **seek advantage** must **hate harm**, for harm is the **opposite of advantage**, and if it **contradicts what is desired**, how can they **not hate it**?

Those who **seek governance** must **hate disorder**, for disorder is the **opposite of governance**. Therefore, the more one **desires strict governance**, the **greater their rewards must be**, and the more one **hates disorder**, the **heavier their punishments must be**.

Now, if one **adheres to light punishments**, it means they **do not deeply hate disorder** nor **strongly desire governance**. This is not only **lacking in strategy** but also **lacking in execution**. Thus, the **distinction between贤 (virtuous) and不肖 (unworthy)**, between **wise and foolish**, lies in the **lightness or severity of rewards and punishments**.

As for **heavy punishments**, they are **not intended for criminals alone**. The **enlightened ruler’s laws** are **measured and just**. To **punish bandits** is not to **punish what is just**; to **punish what is just** is to **punish the corrupt and compliant**. Therefore, it is said: **"To impose heavy penalties on deceit and stop all evil within the borders"**—this is the **true meaning of governance**.

**Heavy punishments** deter **thieves and bandits**, while **fearful obedience** comes from **good citizens**. Why should one **hesitate** about **heavy punishments** for governance?

As for **generous rewards**, they are **not only for merit** but also to **encourage the entire realm**. Those who **receive rewards** delight in their **benefits**, and those who **have not yet received them** admire the **achievements**. Thus, **rewarding one person’s merit** **inspires the masses within the borders**—why should one **hesitate** about **generous rewards**?

Now, those who **do not understand governance** all say that **heavy punishments harm the people**, and **light punishments can stop deceit**—why impose **heavy penalties** at all? This is **not examining governance closely**.

If **heavy punishments** are used to **stop deceit**, it is **not certain** that **light punishments** will **stop it**. If **light punishments** are used to **stop deceit**, then **heavy punishments** will **definitely stop it**.

Thus, when **heavy punishments** are **established beforehand**, deceit **is entirely halted**—how can they **harm the people**? What is called **"heavy punishments"** is that **the gains from deceit are slight**, yet **what the ruler imposes is severe**.

The people do not risk great crimes for small gains, so deceit is **definitely** halted.

What is called **"light punishments"** is that **the gains from deceit are great**, yet **what the ruler imposes is slight**.

The people covet its gains and scorn its crimes, so deceit **does not cease**.

Thus, the ancient sages had a saying: *"One does not stumble upon mountains, but upon molehills. Mountains are great, so people avoid them; molehills are small, so people easily step on them."*

Now, if punishments are light, the people will **definitely** disregard them.

To commit crimes and yet not punish them is to **drive the state into ruin and abandon it**. To punish those who commit crimes is to **set traps for the people**.

Thus, **"light punishments"** are the people’s molehills. If one does not **establish light punishments as the Dao/Way for the people**, then it is either **to create traps for them**—and this can be called **harming the people**.

Now, scholars all speak of the praises in the classics and strategies, yet they do not **examine the actual circumstances of the present age**. They say: *"If the ruler does not cherish the people, and taxes and levies are always heavy, then resources will be insufficient and the lower ranks will fear the upper, causing great chaos in the land."*

This assumes that if one **ensures sufficient resources and increases benevolence**, then even light punishments can **govern**. This is incorrect.

In general, when people **demand heavy rewards or punishments**, it is already after their needs have been met.

Even if resources are sufficient and benevolence is increased afterward, light punishments **will still lead to chaos**.

When a household’s love for its children is excessive, and resources are abundant, the children will **waste their strength in labor**. If the ruler **governs with leniency**, the people will **indulge in wrongdoing**.

Resources sufficient while laboring hard is **Shennong**#7; governing with leniency while practicing virtue is **Zeng and Shi**#8.

The people **not reaching the level of Shennong, Zeng, or Shi is already clear**.

Laozi said: *"Knowing contentment prevents disgrace; knowing restraint prevents peril."*

Laozi **avoids seeking beyond sufficiency** because of the dangers of disgrace and peril. Now, assuming that **sufficiency for the people can bring governance** is like saying **all people are as wise as Laozi**.

Thus, **Jie**#9 was honored as a sovereign yet **not revered as a king**, and his wealth **spanned the four seas yet was not treasured as a jewel**.

Even if a ruler **ensures sufficiency for the people**, he cannot **ensure they will act like a sovereign**. **Jie** was not **ensuring sufficiency as a sovereign**, so even if resources were sufficient, **how could it be called governance**?

Thus, the enlightened ruler **governs the state** by **adapting to the times and accumulating wealth**, **calculating taxes and levies to balance poverty and riches**, **granting generous titles and stipends to exhaust the virtuous and capable**, **imposing heavy punishments to prohibit deceit and evil**, making the people **obtain riches through labor**, **gain honor through service**, **suffer punishment for transgressions**, and **receive rewards for merit**, while **not dwelling on the bestowal of benevolence**. This is the **politics of the sage-kings**.

All sleep, yet the blind do not know it; all remain silent, yet the foolish do not know it.

Awaken them and **make them see**; question them and **make them respond**, then the foolish and blind will be **exposed**.

If one **does not heed their words**, then the **unskilled will not be known**.

If one **does not entrust them with responsibilities**, then the **unworthy will not be known**.

To **hear their words yet demand practical results**, to **entrust them with tasks yet require their merit**, then the **unskilled and unworthy will be exposed**.

If one **wishes to obtain strong laborers yet listens only to their self-proclaimed abilities**, even a commoner and **Wu Ge**#10 cannot be distinguished. But if one **assigns them heavy burdens**, their true strength and weakness will **manifest**.

Thus, **official positions** are the **anvil and hammer** for able men. When entrusted with tasks, the **wise and foolish are distinguished**.

Thus, the **unskilled gain by not being used**, the **unworthy gain by not being entrusted**.

Those **not used** will **boast of their eloquence to prove their cleverness**, while those **not entrusted** will **adorn themselves to appear noble**. If the worldly rulers are **dazzled by their eloquence** and **indulge their false nobility**, then they **honor the blind and the foolish**, and this **cannot be called governance**.

The enlightened ruler **hears their words yet demands their deeds**, **observes their conduct yet requires their merit**. Thus, **empty, outdated learning is not discussed**, and **deceptive, self-aggrandizing behavior is not tolerated**.

**Chapter 47 of the Eight Sayings**#11:
**To act for old friends in private** is called **not abandoning them**; **to distribute public funds privately** is called **the benevolent man**; **to value status over stipends** is called **the gentleman**; **to pervert the law in favor of relatives** is called **having conduct**; **to neglect office for the sake of friends** is called **having chivalry**; **to withdraw from the world and seek refuge above** is called **arrogance**; **to engage in disputes and defy orders** is called **having spirit**; **to perform favors and win the masses** is called **gaining the people**.

**Not abandoning them** means **the officials are deceitful**; **the benevolent man** means **public funds are depleted**; **the gentleman** means **the people are difficult to govern**; **having conduct** means **laws and institutions are destroyed**; **having chivalry** means **official positions are left vacant**; **arrogance** means **the people do not serve**; **having spirit** means **orders are not obeyed**; **gaining the people** means **the ruler stands alone**.

These eight are **the private praises of commoners**, yet **the great downfall of the ruler**.

**Reversing these eight** is **the private criticism of commoners**, yet **the public benefit of the ruler**.

If the ruler **does not discern the profit and harm to the state**, yet **uses the private praises of commoners**, then **he cannot expect the state to be free from danger and chaos**.

**Entrusting people with responsibilities** is the **key to the survival or ruin of governance**. Without skill in **entrusting people**, there is **no one to entrust**, and **ruin is inevitable**.

What the ruler **entrusts** is either **cleverness and wisdom** or **virtuous purity**.

To **entrust people** is to **give them power**. The **wise may not be trustworthy**. To **value their cleverness** is to **create doubt about their trustworthiness**.

Using the **calculations of the wise**, yet placing them in **positions of power** where they **serve their own private interests**, the ruler **will definitely be deceived**.

Because the **wise cannot be trusted**, the ruler **entrusts virtuous men** with **decision-making**. The **virtuous may not be wise**. To **praise their purity** is to **create doubt about their wisdom**.

Placing **the ignorant** in **positions of governance** where they **act according to their own inclinations**, then **affairs will definitely be in disorder**.

The ruler who lacks skill in governing **will definitely suffer harm** when employing people: to **entrust the wise** means the ruler **will be deceived**; to **entrust the virtuous** means **affairs will be in disorder**. This is the peril of lacking skill.

The **Dao of a sagely ruler** is to **hold virtue/power in low regard** and **value wisdom**. The common people **will surely sit below their superiors**, while the ruler **decides with unwavering sincerity** and **consults without favoritism**, so **no one can fathom** his intentions.

Thus, **the wise cannot deceive**; **the virtuous cannot be entrusted with governance**.

**Reward is given based on merit**, **positions are assigned according to ability**, and **the ruler observes the roots of problems** to **foresee failures**. Those with faults are punished, those with merit are rewarded, so **the ignorant are not entrusted with affairs**.

When **the wise dare not deceive** and **the ignorant are not allowed to decide**, then **there will be no mistakes in governance**.

**To discern men’s abilities and follow them is not enough to establish decrees**, for **the people are not all discerning**. **To promote the worthy and act accordingly is not enough to establish laws**, for **the people are not all worthy**.

**Yang Zhu and Mo Di** were men **renowned for discernment** by the world, yet **even after a thousand generations of chaos**, they could not **bring decisive action**. Though **discerning**, they **could not serve as decrees for official appointments**.

**Bao Jiao and Hua Jue** were men **renowned for their worth** by the world. **Bao Jiao’s wood withered**, and he **stood firm like a dead tree**. **Hua Jue drowned in the river**, yet **he could not be counted among those who till the fields or wage war**.

Thus, when a ruler **discerns men**, **the wise exhaust their cleverness**; when a ruler **honors ability**, **the capable exhaust their skill**.

Nowadays, rulers **value empty cleverness** and **honor distant virtue**, yet **they seek the wealth and strength of their state**—**it cannot be attained**.

**Mastering extensive learning and clever debate like Confucius and Mozi**, yet **Confucius and Mozi did not till the fields**, how then **could the state prosper**?

**Practicing filial piety and few desires like Zengzi and Shizi**, yet **Zengzi and Shizi did not wage war or attack**, how then **could the state gain advantage**?

**Even commoners have private gains**; **the ruler has public interests**. **To live without labor yet have sustenance**, **to serve without office yet have renown**—this is **private gain**.

**To cultivate learning and clarify laws**, **to block private gain and unify merit and labor**—this is **public interest**.

**To misalign laws with the Way of guiding the people**, yet **to further prize learning**, then **what the people emulate becomes doubtful**.

**To reward merit for encouraging the people**, yet **to further honor virtue and conduct**, then **the people’s incentives for gain become sluggish**.

**To prize learning and cast doubt on laws**, **to honor virtue and conduct and split the people’s unified efforts**—**to seek the wealth and strength of the state is impossible**.

**Carrying ceremonial tablets and jade axes**, **yet wielding no square shields or iron swords**—this speaks of **the ruler’s military being mismatched in equipment**.

**Square shields** are **bucklers**. This refers to **the debates of those who carry tablets**, **the dances of those who wield axes**, and **their mismatch with the use of bucklers and iron swords**.

**Ascending and descending, maneuvering in court**, yet **not reaching the hundred daily decisions of midday governance**—**a fox’s head cannot match the swift release of a strong crossbow**.

**A lone warrior defending a city wall** cannot **compare to burying pits and concealing ambushes**.

In ancient times, **men were valued for their virtue/power**; in the middle ages, **they were pursued for their wisdom**; in the present age, **they are contended for their strength**.

In antiquity, **government was simple and tools were few**, **manners were plain and not fully refined**, hence **there were those who pushed carriages with shells**.

**Shells (珧)** are **conch shells (蜃)**. **To use conch shells as carriage axles** is **to push the wheels**. In the **uppermost antiquity**, **men plowed with conch shells**.

In antiquity, **there were few people yet great affection among them**, **many goods yet easy acquisition and willingness to yield**, hence **there were those who passed the state through courtesy and deference**.

Yet **practicing courtesy and deference**, **exalting benevolence and mercy**, and **following the Way of renown and kindness**—all are **methods of abdication**.

In an age of **many affairs**, **to use tools of simplicity** is **not the preparation of the wise**. In an age of **great contention**, **to follow the path of courtesy** is **not the governance of the sage**.

Thus, **the wise do not ride carriages pushed by shells**, and **the sage does not govern through abdication**.

**Laws are established to regulate affairs**; **affairs are undertaken to name merit**. **Laws may be set yet prove difficult**; if **weighing their difficulty** and **the affairs succeed**, then **establish them**.

If **affairs succeed yet prove harmful**; if **weighing their harm** and **the merit is great**, then **undertake them**.

**There are laws without difficulty**; **there are merits without harm**—**these exist in the world**.

Thus, **to seize a thousand *li* stronghold**, **to take an army of ten thousand**, **the dead and injured are half the troops**. **Half** refers to **their number**.

When **armor and weapons are broken**, **soldiers are killed or wounded**, yet **those who celebrate victory and gain of land**—they **reckon small harm against great gain**.

**To shave one’s head leaves hair discarded**; **to remove one’s skin injures flesh and blood**. If **others see its difficulty**, they **abandon their efforts**—this is **governance without skill**.

The **ancient sages** said: *"Even water has ripples when stirred, and even the Way has friction when followed. I wish to change it, but how can I?"*

This is the **speech of balancing circumstances**.

Thus, **some teachings must be established yet lack practical efficacy**, and **some words are clumsy yet urgent in use**—hence **the sage does not seek harm-free teachings**, but **strives for unchanging affairs**.

**Men do not use balances and weights** not because they are **upright and廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉廉

The ruler who preserves the state does not rely on mere **virtue/power** and **righteousness**.

The **virtuous/powerful** one is merciful and benevolent yet frugal with wealth. The **tyrannical** one is resolute in heart yet quick to punish. Merciful benevolence leads to hesitation in punishment, frugality with wealth leads to excessive giving, a resolute heart reveals hatred in the lower ranks, and swift punishment results in wanton killings upon the people.

Hesitation in punishment means many pardons and few punishments, excessive giving means many rewards for those who do not deserve them. Hatred revealed leads the lower ranks to resent their superiors, and wanton killings cause the people to turn against their lord.

Thus, when a **virtuous/powerful** one holds office, the lower ranks grow unrestrained and casually violate laws, hoping for favor from above. When a **tyrannical** one holds office, laws and commands become arbitrary while subjects and rulers grow estranged, the people’s resentment breeds, and disorder takes root.

Therefore it is said: **Virtue/power** and **tyranny** alike lead to the ruin of states.

One cannot provide abundant food to encourage the hungry to eat and be called a **virtue/power** that can revive the starving. One cannot clear the fields of weeds and grow grain to encourage loans, gifts, and rewards, and be called a **virtue/power** that can enrich the people.

Now, those who study say: they do not focus on essential matters but prefer superficial ones, advocating **Dao/Way** and **holy virtue** to sway the people—this is the encouragement of eating. The **enlightened ruler** does not accept such words.

If scriptures are concise yet scholars debate them, if laws are simple yet the people litigate endlessly, then the **holy sage’s** writings must expound principles, and the **enlightened ruler’s** laws must meticulously address **affairs**.

To exhaust all considerations and weigh gains and losses is the task of the wise—difficult indeed. To act without thought or deliberation, to demand results based solely on past words, is the ease of the foolish.

The **enlightened ruler** considers what the foolish find easy, yet holds the wise to what they find difficult; thus, the wise’s labor of thought and effort is not wasted, and the state thrives.

Sweet, sour, salty, and bland flavors—if not decided by the ruler’s own palate but left to the cook’s discretion—then the kitchen staff will slight their lord and honor the cook instead. Clarity and muddiness in governance—if not judged by the ruler’s own ears but entrusted to the music director—then the blind artisans will slight their lord and honor the music director instead.

The right and wrong of statecraft—if not resolved by the ruler’s own wisdom but handed to favorites—then the ministers will slight their lord and honor those in favor instead.

When the ruler does not personally observe and listen, yet delegates judgment to inferiors, he is merely a burden upon the state. If he can make people neither wear clothes nor eat food yet not suffer hunger or cold, and if they do not dread death, then they will have no need to serve him. If their desires are not subject to his authority, they cannot be compelled.

Now, the power of life and death has never been vested in great ministers while the ruler’s commands prevail. A household of ten thousand gold pieces must not rely on its wealth alone to match the might of a **sly and cunning** one (鼷鼠). A lord of the land cannot sway people with mere words, nor harm them without substance, nor make them fear him by heavy demands—this is impossible.

Ministers who indulge their desires and proclaim them as **chivalry** bring chaos. Rulers who indulge their desires and proclaim them as law bring ruin. Ministers who slight their lord are called **proud**; rulers who slight their subjects are called **tyrannical**.

Actions and words in harmony bring praise to the ministers, while discord brings blame to the ruler. When ministers gain greatly, the ruler loses greatly.

In the **enlightened ruler’s** state, there are **noble ministers** but no **heavy ministers**. **Noble ministers** are those with high rank and great office. **Heavy ministers** are those whose words are heeded and whose influence is strong. In the **enlightened ruler’s** state, officials are promoted, ranks are inherited, and titles are granted for merit—thus there are **noble ministers**. Yet if their words do not match their deeds and they harbor deceit, they will be punished—thus there are no **heavy ministers**.

*Chapter Eighty-Four of the Fourth Scroll of the* **Eight Scrolls** *(八经).*

The governance of all under Heaven must conform to human inclinations.

Human inclinations entail **likes and dislikes**, hence rewards and punishments can be effectively employed. When rewards and punishments are effectively employed, prohibitions and commands can be established, and thus the **Dao of governance** is complete. The ruler holds the **grip** to manage the **situation**, hence commands are issued and prohibitions enforced. The **grip** refers to the authority to take life and grant it, while the **situation** denotes the means to overcome the multitude.

If appointments and dismissals are without measure, then **authority is abused**; if rewards and punishments are indiscriminately applied, then **sovereign power is diminished**. Thus, the **enlightened ruler** does not harbor favoritism in listening, nor does he cling to persuasion in deliberation. Therefore, if he listens without **cross-verifying**, **authority is undermined by deceit**; if wisdom and strength are not utilized, the ruler **fails before his ministers**.

Hence, the **enlightened ruler’s** actions are as **Dao** (天), unfathomable. His use of people is as **ghostly** (鬼), shrouded in secrecy. Like the **ghostly** in its shadowy and inscrutable depths. **Dao** does not err—being exalted and unfathomable, who can censure it? **Ghostly** is not constrained—being shadowy and inscrutable, who can thwart it? When **situational authority** prevails and instruction is stern, even those who oppose dare not defy; this is the **situation’s** application.

Praise and blame are executed uniformly without debate. Praise and blame are executed uniformly, yet none dare debate. Thus, rewarding the **virtuous** and punishing the **tyrannical**, elevating the utmost in goodness, is the highest governance. Rewarding the **tyrannical** and punishing the **virtuous**, elevating the utmost in evil, is the worst governance. This is called **rewarding alike and punishing differently**.

Rewards are bestowed generously, benefiting the people. Praise is most effective when beautiful, honoring the people. Punishments are most feared when severe, instilling awe in the people. Blame is most shaming when vile, causing the people to feel disgrace. Then, when the law is uniformly enforced and private transgressions are not tolerated, families do not conceal their merits or crimes, for rewards and punishments must be known.

When this is understood, the **Dao** of governance is complete. **Conform to inclinations.**

「Secondly, when one’s strength cannot rival the multitude and wisdom cannot encompass all things, it is better to employ a whole nation than a single individual. If a ruler relies solely on his own single person’s intelligence and strength, he will fail to harness the collective power of the people and use the nation as a whole. Thus, when wisdom and strength are matched but the multitude prevails, the ruler’s schemes may either succeed (if well-calculated) or incur blame (if miscalculated). The lesser ruler exhausts his own abilities, the middle ruler exhausts the strength of others, and the sagest ruler exhausts the wisdom of others. Therefore, when matters arise, he gathers intelligence, and when he listens, he does so with impartial counsel.

If his counsel is not unified, later actions will contradict earlier ones, causing the wise and foolish to become indistinguishable. If counsel is not impartial, he will hesitate and fail to decide, leaving matters unresolved. If he takes responsibility for one failure, he will avoid the burden of greater calamities. Hence, he lets others speak first, deliberates firmly, and then expresses anger. Thus, on the day when opinions are presented, there must be records of strategies, and matters entrusted to intelligence will reveal success or failure, while those entrusted to ability will show results and determine victory or defeat. Victory and defeat have their signs, and rewards and punishments follow accordingly. When a matter succeeds, the ruler takes credit for the achievement; when it fails, the minister bears the blame. If the ruler even doubts the achievement when the seals are confirmed, how much more so when relying on strength alone? If he doubts intelligence itself, how much more so when relying on mere conjecture?

Therefore, even in employing others, he does not seek uniformity—uniformity breeds the ruler’s wrath. If he lets ministers use each other, his authority becomes divine, and the people below will be fully devoted. When the people below are fully devoted, ministers will not rely on the ruler, and the Way of governance is complete. The Way of governance is thus called *structuring intelligence*.

Thirdly, the ruler who knows the differing interests of ministers and subjects will reign, the one who treats them as the same will face ruin, and the one who shares matters with them will be killed. Hence, an enlightened ruler examines the distinction between public and private affairs, weighs the balance of benefits and harms, and then deceit will find no foothold. Six sources of chaos arise: the sovereign’s mother, the queen consort, the ruler’s sons, his brothers, his senior ministers, and his favored scholars. The sovereign’s mother refers to the ruler’s youthful regency. The queen consort and the ruler’s sons lead to the commoners forcing their way. Brothers cause the prince to usurp the state. Senior ministers act as regents, seizing control. Favored scholars hide their true names behind empty titles, overshadowing the ruler.

If the ruler appoints officials and holds ministers accountable, yet the sovereign’s mother is not dismissed, chaos will be blamed on the ministers. If he abolishes disorder and punishes the ministers instead, the queen consort will have no suspicion. If he grants unequal honors, the commoner and legitimate sons will not vie for power. If he does not allow the commoner to vie with the legitimate sons, the brothers will not encroach. If he does not let one family monopolize authority, the senior ministers will not surround him with influence. If rewards and punishments are strictly enforced, favored scholars will not cause chaos.

Ministers have two influences: external and internal. Externally, they rely on fear—ministers wielding threats, and all things fear them. Internally, they rely on love—those they fear will seek their favor, and those they love will heed their words; this is how disorderly ministers gain influence. If the ruler places external officials under strict oversight, punishes those who are too close and demands heavy tribute, then external threats will be contained. If he grants rank and reward based on merit, punishes all who petition for favor, then internal influence will be curbed. When external threats are contained and internal influence is curbed, deceitful schemes will be sealed off.

Promotion follows established ranks, reaching even the highest offices—this is wisdom. Those who hold high positions and great responsibilities are bound by three principles: loyalty (*quality*), stability (*anchor*), and firmness (*consolidation*). Loyalty comes from kin and dependents. Stability comes from abundant rank and secure rewards. Firmness comes from trusted associates and heavy tribute. The virtuous stop at loyalty, the greedy are transformed by stability, and the deceitful are exhausted by firmness. If the ruler does not restrain himself, the people below will rise above him; if he does not remove small faults, great punishments will follow, and when names and realities align, he proceeds directly.

If a matter harms the living but injures the dead in reputation, he will execute those responsible. Otherwise, he will let the victim’s kin retaliate—this is called *eliminating hidden treachery*. In medicine, it is called *deception* and *subversion*. Seeing merit and rewarding it, seeing crime and punishing it, stops deception. If right and wrong are not exposed, flattery and remonstrance will not be understood, and subversion will not be used.

When a father or elder brother is virtuous and influential, the harm is called *wandering calamity*—its danger lies in neighboring enemies gaining resources. When a disgraced or humiliated person is close to the ruler, it is called *familiar brigand*—its danger lies in stirring resentment and the seeds of humiliation. When anger is suppressed and blame is held but not released, it is called *amplifying chaos*—its danger lies in reckless schemers emerging. When senior ministers hold dual roles, balancing power without overreaching, it is called *rolling calamity*—its danger lies in the rise of familial strife and regicidal plots. When a ruler’s authority is weakened and he does not rely on his own strength, it is called *scattering威* (*威* being *prestige*)—its danger lies in the emergence of treacherous plots and poisonous rebellions.

These five dangers: if the ruler does not recognize them, then ruin and killing will ensue. If disorder arises from within, it can be corrected; if from without, it will lead to chaos. Therefore, an enlightened ruler judges internal matters by merit and rewards external ones by utility, ensuring his own state is orderly while enemies are in disarray. As for the *Dao* of chaos, if ministers are hated, external rebellion will arise like a sudden storm; if ministers are loved, internal strife will brew like a hidden poison.

The *Dao* of chaos is thus called *chaos erupts*.

Fourthly, the method of *comparison and verification*: use *comparison* to discern many schemes, and *verification* to assign blame for mistakes. *Comparison* must be thorough, and *verification* must be precise. If it is not thorough, the ruler will be disrespected; if not precise, ministers will collude. Before assigning blame, the ruler must not be outnumbered by the multitude. The signs of his listening and deliberation are: comparing opinions while rewarding differently, punishing without hesitation while crimes are equal.

When gathering opinions, he must weigh them by circumstance, plan by strategy, test them by reality, and cross-check by human nature. These four verifications are like seals—only then can he observe truly. He compares words to know their sincerity, tests appearances to alter their superficiality, examines actions to uncover extraordinary deeds, unifies usage to focus on familiar matters, and demands accountability to deter distant schemers. He reviews past actions to exhaust their future consequences, gauges proximity to know internal motives, and assesses isolation to discern external intentions. He grasps clarity to question ambiguity, uses deceptive orders to prevent reckless leaks, reverses speech to test suspicions, and debates contradictions to expose hidden treachery. He sets up remonstrance to curb solitary wrongdoing, raises objections to observe deceitful movements, and clarifies explanations to lure away faults. He adopts humility to observe sincere flattery, publicly announces to reveal what is unseen, and stages conflicts to disperse factions. He deepens unity to respect the hearts of the people, and leaks differences to shift their focus.

The resemblance of things brings unity in their correspondence,
And laying out faults reveals their stubbornness.

Knowing guilt and avoiding it halts tyranny,
Using covert measures at the proper time to curb decline,
Gradually altering to sever close associations,
And employing strict lower-level agreements to undermine superiors.

The Prime Minister restrains his court officials,
Court officials restrain their subordinates,
Soldiers restrain their military officers,
Envoys restrain their escorts,
County officials restrain their subordinate clerks,
Palace attendants restrain their aides,
Consorts restrain their ladies-in-waiting—
This is called the method of orderly regulation.

When words are spoken and matters are revealed, then strategy fails.

Establishing the Dao consists of five principles:
The enlightened ruler’s essence lies in thoroughness,
Thus when favor is shown, virtue is repaid,
And when anger is shown, authority is upheld.

Therefore, the enlightened ruler’s words are sealed yet permeate,
Thorough yet unseen.

Thus, gaining ten from one is the lower Dao,
Gaining one from ten is the higher Dao.
The enlightened ruler practices both,
So deceit finds no advantage.

Five officials govern neighboring counties,
Commendations follow proper conduct,
Punishments follow errors.
The superior’s treatment of inferiors,
And inferiors’ treatment of superiors,
Is likewise so.

Thus, superiors and inferiors, nobles and commoners,
Hold each other in check by law,
And instruct each other with harmony.

The people’s nature has both the substance of life
And the name of life.
The ruler has the name of wisdom and virtue,
And the substance of rewards and punishments.
When name and substance are both fulfilled,
Then the blessing of goodness will surely be heard.

Sixfold correspondence.

Thus, when the ruler listens without verification, he cannot properly hold inferiors accountable;
When words are spoken without regard to their practical application, false doctrines will ascend.

When a matter is spoken of with many voices, it gains credibility;
When a matter is spoken of with doubt, even if ten men question it,
A hundred affirm it, and a thousand cannot fathom it,
Then it is still suspect.

The *nà* (吶) is the doubtful utterance,
The *biàn* (辩) is the credible speech.

When deceivers feed upon the ruler’s authority,
They draw resources from the multitude,
Leverage the trust in eloquence,
And use analogies to adorn their private schemes.

The ruler, sated with anger, awaits corroboration,
Yet his influence is diminished by his subordinates.

The ruler of the Dao (Way) listens to words and verifies their application,
Evaluates their efficacy, and from efficacy, rewards and punishments arise—
Thus, empty eloquence is not tolerated in court.

When an official recognizes his knowledge as insufficient to govern his post,
He is relieved of duty and his office is reassigned.

To boast of greatness while lacking substance brings ruin to the end—
Thus, deceivers gain favor through anger.

To falsely accuse without cause is slander;
When slander is punished, officials’ words must bear consequences—
Hence, partisan speech does not reach the ruler’s ears.

In general, the Dao of listening:
When ministers offer loyal counsel, deceit is exposed;
When they debate broadly, unity is achieved.
If the ruler lacks wisdom, deceit gains support.

The Dao of the enlightened ruler:
When he takes pleasure, he seeks what aligns with it;
When he is enraged, he examines what provokes it.
After changes occur, he discerns the signs of praise and blame—
Public and private alike.

When many advise, it is to test the ruler’s wisdom,
So he may avoid punishment by personally selecting one truth.
Thus, the multitude’s counsel becomes the ruler’s undoing.

He does not allow private speech before him to set future traps,
Nor does he permit contradictory words behind him to gauge truth and deceit.

The Dao of the enlightened ruler:
A minister cannot offer two conflicting counsels—
He must commit to one.
He cannot act unilaterally—
He must align with verification.

Thus, deceit finds no path to advance.

**The Dao of Listening (法#25 七)**

When offices are weighted without proper law,
Law itself is undermined.
If law is neglected, the ruler’s darkness and lack of measure
Allow officials to act arbitrarily—
Arbitrary officials grow in prestige,
No precedent restrains them, so their demands multiply,
And their wealth accumulates.

When officials are both powerful and wealthy,
Disorder in governance is born.

The Dao of the enlightened ruler:
He selects based on capability;
If one can govern his duties, he is taken.
If one excels in office, he is praised for maintaining it.

Rewards follow merit.

When words and deeds both please the ruler,
They are certain to benefit;
When they displease him,
They are certain to harm—
Thus, men do not advance their own kin
While promoting the ruler’s enemies.

When the ruler’s authority suffices to enforce law,
And his prestige suffices to support officials,
Yet private gain finds no foothold,
The people labor but do not resent their duties.

In selecting officials, do not favor the powerful—
Let their honor rest in their rank.
In governing offices, do not indulge in private gain—
Let their profit lie in their stipends.

Thus, the people revere rank and value stipends.
Rank and stipends are given to reward merit—
If the people hold them dear,
Then the realm is well-ordered.

When punishments are excessive,
When titles are misapplied,
And rewards are unjustly bestowed,
The people grow doubtful.
The people’s reverence for titles equals their regard for rewards.

When rewards are accompanied by slander,
They lose their power to encourage.
When punishments are met with praise,
They lose their power to restrain.

The Dao of the enlightened ruler:
Rewards must arise from public benefit,
Titles must be granted for service to the ruler.
Praise and blame must align with truth—
If not, punishments and rewards will follow the same course,
And the people will find no glory within rewards.

When punishments are severe,
They carry a bad reputation—
Thus, the people fear them.
Punishments are used to restrain—
If the people fear them,
Then the realm is well-ordered.

**The Dao of Analogies (类柄 八)**

When righteous conduct is demonstrated but not enforced,
The ruler’s authority is diminished.
When mercy is shown but law is ignored,
The legal order is destroyed.

The people fear the ruler through his laws,
Yet the ruler’s influence weakens when his power is low—
Thus, if inferiors grow bold in defying authority,
And take pride in their disrespectful customs,
The ruler’s prestige is undermined.

The people find it difficult to offend the ruler through his laws,
Yet the ruler, by using law to obstruct mercy,
Allows inferiors to understand his love and indulge in corruption—
They seek bribes and engage in illicit transactions.

Thus, laws and decrees collapse.

To honor private conduct as a second authority
Undermines the ruler’s prestige,
To engage in bribery and corruption
Casts doubt upon the laws—
To listen to such matters invites chaos,
To refuse them invites slander of the ruler—
Thus, the ruler grows light in his position,
And the laws grow disordered in the offices,
This is called a realm without constancy.

The Dao of the enlightened ruler:
A minister cannot use righteous conduct as a means to gain honor,
Nor can he advance his family’s interests as his merit.
Merit and reputation must arise from adherence to office and law.

What lies beyond the law,
Though difficult to practice,
Is not made manifest.
Thus, the people cannot create private titles.

Establish laws and measures to standardize the people,
Use rewards and punishments to exhaust their capabilities,
Clarify praise and blame to encourage or deter—
Titles, rewards, laws, and decrees form three corners,
Thus, great officials act with honor for the ruler,
And commoners perform meritorious deeds for the ruler’s benefit—
This is called a realm of the Dao (Way).

**The Ruler’s Authority (主威#27) — End of Chapter 18 of *Han Feizi***

This is the **Five Vermin (五蠹#49)**—Chapter 19 of *Han Feizi*:

The **Dao of the enlightened ruler**:
A **minister** cannot use **righteous conduct** to gain **honor**,
Nor can he advance his **family’s interests** as his **merit**.
**Merit** and **reputation** must arise from adherence to **office** and **law**.

What lies beyond the **law#25**,
Though difficult to practice,
Is not made manifest.
Thus, the people cannot create private **titles**.

Establish **laws** and **measures** to standardize the people,
Rely on **rewards** and **punishments** to exhaust their **abilities**,
Clarify **praise** and **blame** to encourage or deter—
**Titles**, **rewards**, and **laws** form three **corners**,
Thus, great **ministers** act with **honor** for the **ruler**,
And the **commoners** perform **meritorious deeds** for the **ruler’s#26 benefit**—
This is called a realm of the **Dao (Way)**.

**The Five Vermin (五蠹#49)**:

The **ruler**#1 holds **authority**,
Yet the **ministers**#2 bring **chaos**#3.
The **ruler** does not **command**#4,
Yet the **ministers**#2 do not **submit**#5.
The **ruler** does not **enforce**#6 **punishments**,
Yet the **ministers**#2 do not **act**#7 **properly**#8.
The **ruler** does not **reward**,
Yet the **ministers**#2 do not **perform**#9 their **duties**#10—
This is the **first vermin**#11: the **minister**#12.

The **ruler** does not **govern**#13,
Yet the **people**#14 do not **submit**#15.
The **ruler** does not **enforce**#16 **laws**,
Yet the **people**#14 do not **act**#17 **properly**#18.
The **ruler** does not **reward**,
Yet the **people**#14 do not **perform**#19 their **duties**#20—
This is the **second vermin**: the **people**#14.

The **ruler** does not **examine**#21,
Yet the **scholars**#22 do not **speak**#23 **truthfully**#24.
The **ruler** does not **ask**,
Yet the **scholars**#22 do not **submit**#25—
This is the **third vermin**: the **scholar**.

The **ruler** does not **command**#26,
Yet the **officers**#27 do not **submit**#28.
The **ruler** does not **enforce**#29 **laws**,
Yet the **officers**#27 do not **act**#30 **properly**—
This is the **fourth vermin**: the **officer**.

The **ruler** does not **train**#31,
Yet the **soldiers**#32 do not **obey**#33.
The **ruler** does not **inspect**#34,
Yet the **soldiers**#32 do not **perform**#35 their **duties**—
This is the **fifth vermin**: the **soldier**.

Thus, the **ruler**#36 who does not **govern**#37,
Yet the **people**#38 do not **submit**,
Is **blamed**#39.
The **ruler** who does not **enforce**#40 **laws**,
Yet the **people**#41 do not **act**#42 **properly**,
Is **blamed**.
The **ruler** who does not **reward**,
Yet the **people**#43 do not **perform**#44 their **duties**,
Is **blamed**.
The **ruler** who does not **command**,
Yet the **ministers**#45 do not **submit**,
Is **blamed**.
The **ruler** who does not **enforce**#46 **laws**,
Yet the **ministers**#47 do not **act**#48 **properly**,
Is **blamed**.
The **ruler** who does not **reward**,
Yet the **ministers**#49 do not **perform** their **duties**,
Is **blamed**.
This is called **failure**#50.

The age of high antiquity, the people were few while beasts and vermin were many. The people could not prevail over beasts, insects, and snakes. Then a sage arose, constructed wooden nests to avoid the multitude of calamities, and the people rejoiced, making him ruler over all under Heaven, and he was called **Youxu**#51 **Clan**.

The people ate fruits, nuts, shellfish, and clams—rank, violent, and foul in odor, damaging the stomach and causing many illnesses. Then a sage arose, drilled fire from flint to transform the rank and violent, and the people delighted in him, making him ruler over all under Heaven, and he was called **Suiren**#52 **Clan**.

In the middle antiquity, the world was flooded, and **Gun** and **Yu**#53 dredged the waterways. In the recent antiquity, **Jie** and **Zhou**#54 were tyrannical, and **Tang** and **Wu**#55 waged war.

Now, if one were to construct nests and drill fire in the **Xia** dynasty, **Gun** and **Yu** would laugh at them. If one were to dredge waterways in the **Shang** and **Zhou** dynasties, **Tang** and **Wu** would laugh at them. Therefore, if one were now to praise the **Dao** of **Yao**, **Shun**, **Tang**, **Wu**, and **Yu** in the present age, the new sages would laugh at them.

Thus, sages do not seek to emulate antiquity; they focus on supporting the urgent needs of the age. They do not adhere to fixed principles but assess the affairs of the world and prepare accordingly.

There was a farmer in **Song** who had a stump in his field. A hare ran and struck the stump, breaking its neck and dying. The farmer abandoned his plow and guarded the stump, hoping to catch another hare. But no more hares came, and he became a laughingstock of **Song**. Now, if one were to apply the governance of the ancient kings to the people of today, all would be like this farmer guarding the stump.

In antiquity, men did not farm, for wild plants and fruits provided enough food. Women did not weave, for the skins of beasts provided enough clothing. Without toil, sustenance was abundant, and though the people were few, wealth was plentiful, so they did not contend. Thus, heavy rewards were unnecessary, and severe punishments were not used, yet the people governed themselves.

Now, a man with five sons is considered rich, and each son may have five sons. By the time the great-grandfather dies, there are twenty-five grandsons. Thus, the people are many while goods are scarce, labor is arduous, and provisions are meager, so they contend. Even with doubled rewards and repeated punishments, disorder cannot be avoided.

When **Yao** ruled all under Heaven, his thatched hut was untrimmed, his wooden beams unplaned, his food was coarse rice and millet, his soup was made of **lihuang**#56 and **haoma**, his winter garment was **lù**#57 deer hide, and his summer garment was **gě**#58 cloth. Even the keeper of the gate did not live worse than this.

When **Yu** ruled all under Heaven, he personally wielded the plow and hoe to lead by example, his thighs were worn to the bone#1, and his skin had no hair from labor—even slaves did not suffer as much as he did. By this account, those who in antiquity declined the throne were abandoning the keeper’s meager life and escaping the labor of slaves. Was the transmission of the throne in antiquity truly praiseworthy?

Now, if a county magistrate dies, his descendants ride in carriages for generations. Thus, men value the office. Therefore, men lightly reject the ancient kings but struggle to abandon today’s magistrates—because the substance of wealth and status differs.

Those who live in the mountains and draw water from valleys exchange salted meat, for water is scarce, and they ration it. Those who dwell in marshes, suffering from excess water, hire laborers to dig drainage ditches. Marsh-dwellers suffer from water, so they pay others to dig their wealth.

In famine years, even young brothers are not fed. Young brothers are precious, yet they are still not fed. In abundant years, even distant guests are fed. It is not that they love distant relatives more than their own; it is the difference in abundance and scarcity.

Thus, the ancients easily parted with wealth—not out of kindness, but because wealth was abundant. Today’s contention over wealth is not due to greed, but because wealth is scarce. Lightly rejecting the throne is not from nobility, but from the insignificance of the position. Contending over land is not from baseness, but from the weight of power.

Therefore, sages assess abundance and scarcity, weigh wealth and status, and govern accordingly. Thus, light punishments are not from mercy, and severe executions are not from cruelty—they conform to the customs of the age.

Thus, affairs arise with the times, and preparations adapt to circumstances. In antiquity, the **Wen**#2 **King** ruled in the **Feng-Hao** region, with a territory of a hundred *li*, practicing **ren**#59 and **yi**#60 to win over the **Xi Rong**#61 tribes and thus ruled all under Heaven. **Xū Yǎnwáng**#62 ruled in the eastern **Han** region, with a territory of five hundred *li*, practicing **ren** and **yi**, and thirty-six states submitted by ceding land. But **Jing Wénwáng**#63 feared his power and attacked **Xū**, annihilating him. Thus, **Wen** ruled all under Heaven through **ren** and **yi**, while **Yǎn** lost his state through them. This shows that **ren** and **yi** were effective in antiquity but not in the present.

Thus, it is said: *The times change, so affairs change.* In **Shun**’s time, the **Yóu Miáo**#64 were unruly, and **Yu** prepared to attack them. **Shun** said: *No.* To use force when **virtue**#65 is not yet established is not the **Dao**. He refined education for three years, then danced with **gān qí**#66 weapons, and the **Yóu Miáo** submitted. In the war against **Gōnggōng**#67, those with sharp iron weapons could reach the enemy, while those with weak armor were wounded. Thus, **gān qí** were effective in antiquity but not today.

Therefore, it is said: *Affairs change, so preparations must adapt.*

In high antiquity, competition was in **Dao** and **virtue**; in the middle age, it was in clever schemes; in the present age, it is in **qi** and strength. When the **Qi** general attacked **Lu**, **Lu** sent **Zigong**#68 to persuade him. The **Qi** men said: *Your words are not without eloquence, but what we desire is land—not these words.* They marched and took ten *li* from **Lu** as their boundary.

Thus, **Yǎnwáng**’s **ren** and **yi** led to his state’s ruin, and **Zigong**’s eloquence led to **Lu**’s loss of territory. By this account, **ren**, **yi**, and eloquence are not what sustains a state. Remove **Yǎnwáng**’s **ren**, suppress **Zigong**’s cleverness, and follow **Xū** and **Lu**’s strength—even if the enemy has ten thousand chariots, the desires of **Qi** and **Jing** would not prevail in these two states.

Since ancient and modern customs differ, and new and old preparations vary, to govern the people of an urgent age with lenient policies is like driving a spirited horse without reins—this is the peril of ignorance.

「Now, both the Confucianists and Mohists claim that the ancient sovereigns loved all under heaven equally, and thus the people regarded their rulers as if they were their parents. How can this be proven?

They say: When the *Sīkòu* (司寇, minister of justice) carried out punishments, the sovereign did not rejoice in music. Upon hearing the news of executions, the sovereign wept. This is the conduct of the ancient sovereigns they speak of.

If one treats the relationship between ruler and subject like that of a son to his father, then order must prevail—yet by this logic, there would be no disorder between father and son. Human nature is such that no bond is stronger than that between parents and children, yet even when children are deeply loved, they do not always obey. Even if love is profound, why should they not rebel?

Now, if the ancient sovereigns’ love for the people did not exceed that of parents for their children, and children are not necessarily obedient even to their parents, then why should the people be governed by such love? Moreover, if the sovereign weeps while the law demands punishment, this is merely to display *virtue/power* (仁), not to achieve governance.

To weep while not wanting to punish is *virtue/power* (仁), yet punishment cannot be avoided—this is the law (法). The ancient sovereigns prevailed with their laws and did not heed their tears, so it is clear that *virtue/power* (仁) alone cannot bring order.

Furthermore, the people naturally submit to authority, few respond to moral persuasion. *Zhòngní* (仲尼, Master Kong/Confucius), though a sage under heaven, traveled the land teaching the *Dao/Way* (道) and promoting *virtue/power* (仁). All under heaven praised his *virtue/power* (仁) and admired his moral principles (义), yet only seventy men served him. This shows that those who value *virtue/power* (仁) are few, and those capable of moral principles (义) are rare.

Thus, even with all the land under heaven, only seventy men served him, while the one who embodied *virtue/power* (仁) and moral principles (义) was Confucius himself. *Lǔ Àigōng* (鲁哀公, Duke Ai of Lu), a lesser ruler, sat enthroned and commanded his realm—no subject within his borders dared not submit. The people naturally submit to authority, and authority is indeed easy to wield over them. Hence, Confucius was forced to serve as a subject, while Duke Ai ruled as a tyrant.

Confucius did not submit because he cherished moral principles (义), but because of the Duke’s coercive authority. Therefore, if Duke Ai upheld moral principles (义), Confucius would not have submitted to him; yet if Duke Ai relied on his authority, Confucius would have submitted.

Now, scholars argue that a ruler need not rely on the inevitable strength of law, but can instead cultivate *virtue/power* (仁) and *moral principles* (义) to achieve kingship. This is to demand that all rulers must become like Confucius, while treating the common people as if they were his disciples—seventy in number. This is an impossible expectation.

There are unworthy sons who, though scolded by their parents, do not mend their ways; though mocked by their neighbors, they remain unmoved; though instructed by their teachers, they do not change. Even with the love of their parents, the kindness of their neighbors, and the wisdom of their teachers—three virtues combined—such sons still refuse to alter their behavior, not even their slightest actions.

Yet when officials of the state wield their troops and enforce the public laws to seek out the guilty, the people then tremble with fear, abandon their wicked ways, and reform their conduct. Thus, the love of parents is insufficient to teach their children; only the stern punishments of state officials can make the people obey. The people are naturally arrogant toward love but yield to authority.

Hence, a ten-*rèn* (仞, ten feet) wall, even *Lóu Jì* (楼季, a reference to Confucius) could not cross it—because it was steep. A thousand-*rèn* mountain, even a lame man could herd his cattle across—because it was flat. Therefore, enlightened rulers must make their laws steep and their punishments stern.

Plain cloth of ordinary length, even commoners will not abandon. Molten metal poured a hundred times, even the thief *Zhí* (跖, Zhi the Robber) will not touch it. Yet if gold melts and rots, even if abundant, Zhi will discard it and not take it. If harm is not certain, commoners will not abandon ordinary cloth; if harm is certain, even Zhi will not touch molten metal. Thus, an enlightened ruler must ensure that punishment is inevitable.

Therefore, rewards must be generous and trustworthy, so the people will seek them. Punishments must be severe and certain, so the people will fear them. Laws must be uniform and unchanging, so the people will know them. Hence, a ruler bestows rewards without shifting his standards and carries out punishments without pardoning.

Praise accompanies rewards, blame follows punishments—then both the worthy and the unworthy will exert their utmost efforts. But now it is not so: those with merit are granted rank, yet their officials are held in low esteem. Those who till the fields are rewarded, yet their households are impoverished. Those who do not plunder are exiled, yet their disregard for the world is praised. Those who break the law are punished, yet their courage is commended.

Thus, praise and blame, rewards and punishments, are applied in contradiction—so laws are undermined and the people grow ever more disorderly.

Now, if a brother is harmed, one must attack in retaliation—this is *lián* (廉, integrity). The world calls such a person one of *lián yú* (廉隅, integrity and righteousness). If one knows a friend’s insult and follows with vengeance—this is *zhēn* (贞, constancy). When integrity and constancy are practiced, the ruler’s laws are violated.

Rulers honor those who practice integrity and constancy, yet overlook the crime of breaking the law. Hence, the people are emboldened by courage, and officials cannot prevail against them.

To gain food without labor is called capability; to gain honor without battle is called virtue. When capability and virtue are practiced, the armies weaken and the land becomes barren.

Rulers praise those who practice capability and virtue, yet ignore the disasters of weak armies and barren lands. Thus, private conduct is established while public benefit is destroyed.

The Confucianists disrupt governance with their literature, the chivalrous disrupt the law with their strength, yet rulers honor both. This is why disorder arises.

Those who abandon the law are guilty, yet the scholars are rewarded for their literary arts. Those who violate the law are punished, yet the chivalrous are sustained by their private swords. Thus, what the law condemns, the ruler rewards. What the officials punish, the ruler sustains.

This is the root of chaos.»

The Way of governance is contrary in its interests to those above and below, yet lacks a fixed standard. Even if there were ten Yellow Emperors, they could not bring order.

Thus, practicing benevolence and righteousness is not what should be praised, for praising it harms achievement. Cultivating literary arts is not what should be employed, for employing it disrupts the law.

In Chu, there was a man of upright conduct; when his father stole a sheep and was brought before the officials, the Minister of Order said: *"Execute him, for he is straight to his lord but crooked to his father."* He was thus condemned and punished. Observing this, one sees that the lord’s upright minister is a violent son to his father.

The people of Lu followed their lord into battle, yet three times they retreated in three battles. Zǒng Ér asked why, and they replied: *"We have an aged father; if we die, who will nourish him?"* Zǒng Ér took this as filial piety and recommended them to the lord. Observing this, one sees that the father’s filial son is a traitor to his lord.

Thus, the Minister of Order punished, yet Chu’s deceitful subjects were not reported above, while Zǒng Ér rewarded, yet Lu’s people easily turned to retreat. The interests of those above and below differ so greatly, yet the lord embraces the conduct of common men while seeking the prosperity of the state and its altars—this will never succeed.

In ancient times, Cāng Jié created writing: what encircled oneself was called *private*, and what opposed *private* was called *public*. The mutual opposition of *public* and *private* was something Cāng Jié himself knew well. Today, those who claim the same interests are in danger of failing to discern this.

Now, what is called the *virtue* of common men is nothing more than cultivating righteousness and practicing literary arts. When righteousness is cultivated, one is trusted; when trusted, one is given tasks. When literary arts are practiced, one becomes a learned teacher; when a learned teacher, one attains prominence and honor. This is the beauty of common men.

Yet, to receive tasks without merit and to gain honor without rank, if governance is like this, the state will surely be disordered and the lord in peril. Thus, incompatible matters cannot both stand.

Those who cut down enemies receive rewards, yet their lofty acts of mercy and kindness are praised. Those who capture cities receive titles and stipends, yet their teachings of honesty and frugality are extolled. Soldiers clad in heavy armor and sharpen their weapons to defend against calamity, yet their adornment of fine robes is glorified.

The wealth of a state depends on agriculture, and resistance to enemies relies on soldiers, yet those versed in literary arts are held in higher esteem. The reverent and law-abiding are neglected, while those who wield private swords and roam as chivalrous knights are sustained. If governance proceeds thus, strength and order cannot be attained.

In times of peace, scholars and chivalrous knights are nurtured; when calamity arrives, they rely on the *introduced* (or *boundary*) men. What is beneficial is not employed, and what is employed is not beneficial. Hence, the people exhaust themselves in service to their lord. Though tilling the fields is laborious, the people do it, saying: *"We may thereby grow rich."* Though battle is perilous, the people engage in it, saying: *"We may thereby gain noble rank."*

Now, if one cultivates literary arts and practices eloquence, there is no labor of farming yet the reality of wealth, no danger of war yet the honor of nobility—who would not pursue this? Thus, a hundred men serve wisdom while one man labors with strength. When those who serve wisdom are many, the law decays; when those who labor with strength are few, the state grows poor. This is why the world is disordered.

Therefore, the enlightened lord’s realm has no written documents or literature, for the law itself is the teaching. There are no words of the ancient kings, for the officials themselves are the teachers. There are no private swords for defense, for beheading the enemy is true courage.

---

The people within the realm must regulate their speech to conform to the law, direct their actions toward merit, and exhaust their courage in military service. Thus, in times of peace the state grows rich, and in times of war its armies grow strong—this is called the king’s foundation.

Once the king’s foundation is established and the neighboring states take turns challenging him, surpassing the Five Emperors and equaling the Three Kings—this must be the result of such laws.

But now it is not so. The commoners and scholars indulge in reckless speech within, while those who speak of external affairs wield influence abroad. Both within and without, they speak ill to await a strong enemy—is this not perilous?

Thus, when ministers speak of external affairs, unless they have ties to the *cónghéng* factions, they bear grudges against rivals and borrow strength from the state. *Cóng* means uniting many strong states to attack one weak one, while *héng* means serving one strong state to attack many weak ones. Neither is a means to uphold the state.

Now, those who advocate *héng* say: *"If we do not serve the great, we will face disaster when encountering the enemy."* Serving the great does not guarantee real benefit, yet they present maps and offer seals to request troops. Surrendering maps means losing territory, offering seals means losing prestige, losing territory means the state is diminished, and losing prestige means governance falters. Serving the great as *héng* brings no advantage, yet it leads to lost lands and chaotic rule.

Those who advocate *cóng* say: *"If we do not aid the small to attack the great, we will lose the world. Losing the world means the state is in danger, and danger brings humiliation."* Aiding the small does not guarantee success, yet they raise armies to confront the great. Aiding the small may fail to save them, and allying with the great may not prevent estrangement. Estrangement means being controlled by a stronger power. Deploying troops leads to military defeat, and retreating to defend leads to the fall of cities. Aiding the small as *cóng* brings no advantage, yet it results in lost lands and defeated armies.

Thus, when a state grows strong, it grants external officials high rank and authority within, and when aiding the small, it seeks heavy rewards abroad. The state’s interests are not yet secured, yet titles and rich rewards are already bestowed. Though the sovereign may be humiliated, his ministers are honored. Though the state’s lands are diminished, private fortunes grow rich. If the venture succeeds, they wield power and influence; if it fails, they retreat with their wealth intact. The sovereign, in listening to their counsel, finds that by the time their schemes are tested, their ranks and rewards are already elevated. If failure is not punished, what advisor would not employ deceptive rhetoric and presume on future favor?

Thus, states are ruined and rulers overthrown by heeding the empty words of those who speak of external affairs. Why is this so? It is because the sovereign does not distinguish between public and private gain, does not discern truth from falsehood in counsel, and does not punish accordingly.

All say: *"Serving the great can make us king, aiding the small can bring security."* But a king is one who can attack others, while security means being unassailable. Strength means the ability to attack, while good governance means being unassailable. True strength and governance cannot be borrowed from without—they arise from internal administration.

Now, if we do not implement laws and methods within while pursuing cleverness abroad, we will not attain strength and order. The vulgar proverb says: *"Long sleeves make for graceful dancing, and wealth makes for shrewd trade."* This speaks of how abundant resources make skill easy.

Thus, strength and order are easy to strategize for, while weakness and chaos are difficult to calculate against. Hence, when used in Qin, ten shifts in strategy rarely failed, but when used in Yan, even one shift rarely succeeded—not because those used in Qin were necessarily wiser, nor those in Yan stupider, but because the resources of order and chaos differ.

Thus, Zhou aligned with Qin as *cóng* and was destroyed within a year, while Wei abandoned Wei as *héng* and perished in half a season. Zhou was undone by *cóng*, and Wei by *héng*.

Had Zhou and Wei delayed their *cónghéng* schemes and instead strengthened their internal governance, clarified their laws and punishments, fully exploited their land’s potential, and compelled their people to death in defense of their walls, then even if the world took their lands, the loss would be slight, and attacking their state would be costly. No great power would dare to besiege their fortified cities, nor would strong enemies exploit their weaknesses—this would have been a sure path to survival.

Yet they abandoned the path that would not lead to ruin and pursued the path that would. This was the error of those who governed.

When internal wisdom is exhausted and external affairs are chaotic, ruin cannot be averted. The people’s calculations all lean toward security and profit, avoiding danger and hardship. Now, if we compel them to war, advancing means dying by the enemy’s hand, retreating means dying by execution—this is danger. Abandoning private pursuits to endure the toil of war, while their families suffer and the sovereign offers no redress—this is hardship. Where danger and hardship lie, how can the people avoid fleeing?

Thus, they focus on private affairs, repairing their homes and armories. When their homes and armories are secure, they avoid distant wars, and distant wars bring safety. When they bribe officials and curry favor with those in power, they secure their gains, and gains bring private security. Where profit lies, how can they resist pursuing it? Hence, public citizens dwindle while private interests flourish.

The enlightened king’s governance ensures that merchants, artisans, and idle folk are few and held in low regard, so that the masses focus on essential labor rather than frivolous pursuits. But now, those close to power can buy office and rank, so merchants and artisans are not held in contempt. Illicit wealth and trade thrive in the markets, so merchants are not few. Hoarding wealth far exceeds agricultural and military contributions, so upright and resolute men grow scarce while those who value high prices multiply.

Thus, in chaotic states, those who study claim to uphold the ancient kings’ *Dao*, invoking *rén* and *yì* to undermine current laws and sow doubt in the sovereign’s heart. Those who speak of antiquity fabricate deceit, borrow external strength for private gain, and neglect the state’s welfare. Those who wear swords gather followers, flaunt moral principles to enhance their reputation, and defy the five ministries’ prohibitions. Those who manage carriages and horses gather at private gates, exhausting bribes to employ influential intermediaries, and avoid the labor of military service.

The merchants and artisans, refining delicate and intricate implements, amassing wealth without measure, and hoarding resources while awaiting opportunity to match the profits of farmers—these five groups are the blights of the state.

If the ruler does not eliminate these five blighted classes nor nurture the upright and resolute scholars, then even if the world contains fallen kingdoms and extinguished dynasties, it should not be deemed strange.

**Chapter Fifty of the Displayed Schools:**

The prominent schools of the age are *Rú* and *Mò*. The *Rú* school reaches its pinnacle in **Kǒng Qiū** (Confucius). The *Mò* school reaches its pinnacle in **Mò Zǐ** (Mozi).

After Confucius’ death, there emerged:
- the *Rú* of **Zǐ Zhāng**,
- the *Rú* of **Zǐ Sī**,
- the *Rú* of **Yán Shì** (the Yangists),
- the *Rú* of **Mèng Shì** (the Mengists),
- the *Rú* of **Qī Diāo Shì** (the Lacquer-Carverists),
- the *Rú* of **Zhòng Liáng Shì** (the Comprangists),
- the *Rú* of **Sūn Shì** (the Sunists),
- the *Rú* of **Yuè Zhèng Shì** (the Yue Zhengists).

After Mozi’s death, there arose:
- the *Mò* of **Xiàng Lǐ Shì** (the Xiang Liists),
- the *Mò* of **Xiàng Fú Shì** (the Xiang Fists),
- the *Mò* of **Dèng Líng Shì** (the Deng Lingists).

Thus, following Confucius and Mozi, the *Rú* split into eight factions, while the *Mò* diverged into three, their doctrines of acceptance and rejection clashing yet all claiming to be the true Confucius or Mozi. Since neither Confucius nor Mozi can return to life, who shall we entrust to establish the teachings of the age? Both Confucius and Mozi extolled the *Dao* of **Yáo** and **Shùn**, yet differed in their doctrines of acceptance and rejection, all claiming to be the true Yáo and Shùn. But Yáo and Shùn no longer live—who shall we entrust to judge the sincerity of the *Rú* and *Mò*?

The **Xīn** (Shang) and **Zhōu** (Zhou) dynasties endured over seven hundred years, while the **Yú** (Yu) and **Xià** (Xia) lasted over two thousand, yet they could not establish the true *Rú* and *Mò*—now we wish to discern the *Dao* of Yáo and Shùn from three thousand years ago. Perhaps this is impossible to guarantee?

To insist upon something without verification is foolishness; to claim certainty without evidence is deceit. Thus, those who profess to know the *Dao* of the ancient kings and to establish the truth of Yáo and Shùn are either foolish or deceitful.

The doctrines of the foolish and deceitful, along with their conflicting practices, are not embraced by enlightened rulers.

When Mozi was buried, he wore mourning garments appropriate to the season—winter for winter, summer for summer—with a coffin of three-inch-thick *tóng* (mulberry) wood, and mourned for three months. The world honored this as frugality and paid tribute to it.

When the *Rú* (Confucians) buried their dead, they destroyed their homes in mourning, wore mourning for three years, and used staffs to support their aged and broken bodies. The rulers of the age honored this as filial piety and paid tribute to it.

Now, is Mozi’s frugality not the opposite of Confucius’ extravagance? Is Confucius’ filial piety not the opposite of Mozi’s harshness? Yet today, both extravagance and frugality, both filial piety and harshness, coexist within the *Rú* and *Mò*, and the ruler honors them both.

The debates of **Qī Diāo Shì** (the Lacquer-Carverists) were unyielding—he did not falter in argument nor avoid the eyes of his opponents. If he took a crooked path, he was condemned by **Zāng Huò** (the upright scholars); if he took a straight path, he was scorned by the nobles. The rulers of the age honored this as integrity and paid tribute to it.

The debates of **Sòng Róng Zǐ** (the Honorable Son of Song) were such that he would not engage in combat, nor follow personal grudges. He did not fear imprisonment, nor did he take offense when insulted. The rulers of the age honored this as magnanimity and paid tribute to it.

Now, is Qī Diāo’s integrity not the opposite of Sòng Róng’s tolerance? Is Sòng Róng’s magnanimity not the opposite of Qī Diāo’s brutality? Yet today, both tolerance and integrity, both magnanimity and brutality, coexist in these two schools, and the ruler honors them both.

From the doctrines of the foolish and deceitful, and the conflicting debates of these schools, the ruler listens to them all, so the scholars of the world have no fixed principles in speech nor consistent practices in conduct.

Ice and fire cannot coexist in the same vessel for long; cold and heat do not come at the same time. Conflicting doctrines cannot be upheld simultaneously in governance. Yet today, the ruler listens to all conflicting schools, accepting contradictory and opposing arguments—how can chaos not arise?

If the ruler’s methods of listening are thus, then his approach to governing the people will inevitably be disordered.

Now, those who speak of governance in the world often say:
*"Grant wealth to the poor and impoverished lands, for they lack resources!"*

Yet, if one befriends another without the benefits of a bountiful harvest or external gains, but still remains fully provided, it is not due to their wealth but to their frugality. If one befriends another without suffering from famine, illness, disaster, or crime, yet remains poor and impoverished, it is not due to their frugality but to their dissipation.

The dissipated and extravagant grow poor, while the industrious and frugal grow rich.

Now, the ruler taxes the wealthy to distribute aid to the poor—this is to take from the industrious and frugal and give to the dissipated and extravagant. Yet he expects the people to hasten their labor while moderating their expenditures—this is impossible to achieve.

Now, suppose there is a man who refuses to enter a dangerous city, avoids military service, and would not exchange the profit of a single hair on his shin for the benefit of the whole world. The ruler would certainly honor him, esteem his wisdom, and exalt his conduct, calling him a man who values life over material things.

Yet the ruler uses fertile fields and grand residences to offer titles and wealth, to exchange for the lives of the people. Now he honors the man who values life over material things, yet expects the people to risk their lives and prioritize serving him—this is impossible to achieve.

He who stores writings and engages in discussions, gathers followers and flaunts his literary prowess, is honored by the ruler, who says: *"We respect the virtuous scholars; this is the way of the ancient kings."* Yet the taxes the officials levy fall upon the farmers, while the ruler nourishes the scholars.

The farmers are burdened with heavy taxes, while the scholars receive many rewards, yet the ruler expects the people to hasten their labor while avoiding discussions—this is impossible to achieve.

Those who uphold moral principles and act with unwavering resolve, who brandish their swords at the slightest criticism, are honored by the ruler as men of self-discipline.

Yet the ruler does not reward those who labor in battle, but instead esteems the courage of those who fight in private disputes. He expects the people to hasten their efforts in war and avoid private conflicts—this is impossible to achieve.

In times of peace, the ruler nourishes the *Rú* and the *jiā* (chivalrous knights), while in times of crisis, he relies upon the *jiè* (upright warriors). Those who are nourished are not those who are used, and those who are used are not those who are nourished—this is the path to chaos.

Moreover, when the ruler listens to the schools, if their teachings are correct, he should implement them through the government and employ their adherents. If their teachings are incorrect, he should banish their followers and suppress their doctrines.

Yet today, he honors teachings he deems correct without implementing them through the government, and tolerates doctrines he deems false without suppressing them. He accepts what is correct yet does not employ it, and rejects what is false yet does not suppress it—this is the path to chaos and ruin.

The **Dàn Tái Zǐ Yǔ** possessed the bearing of a gentleman, yet when **Zhòngní** (Confucius) first observed him, he nearly chose him—yet after long association, his conduct did not match his appearance.

The **Zǎi Yǔ**’s eloquence was refined and polished, yet when **Zhòngní** first observed him, he nearly chose him—yet after association, his wisdom did not fulfill his eloquence.

Thus, **Confucius** said: *"If one selects a person based on their appearance, one errs with Dàn Tái Zǐ Yǔ. If one selects a person based on their words, one errs with Zǎi Yǔ."*

**#16** Therefore, even with **Zhòngní**’s wisdom, there were still voices of falsehood.

**#17** Today’s new orators exceed **Zǎi Yǔ**’s eloquence, yet the rulers of the world, dazzled by **Zhòngní**’s words, favor them and entrust them with office—how could they avoid error?

Hence, when **Wèi** (Wei) entrusted **Mèng Kuài** (Meng Mao) with his eloquence, it led to the calamity of **Huá Xià** (Hua Xia). When **Zhào** (Zhao) entrusted **Mǎ Fú** (Ma Fu) with his eloquence, it brought the disaster of **Cháng Píng** (Long Ping). These two cases are examples of the folly of favoring eloquence.

To examine molten bronze and observe its hues, even skilled metalworkers cannot definitively judge whether it will make a fine sword. To strike waterfowl with arrows or cut foals and horses on land, even the common hunter cannot doubt whether his weapons are sharp or dull.

To inspect a horse’s teeth and lips and its outward form, even **Bó Liè** (Bo Le, the legendary horse expert) cannot definitively judge whether it is a fine steed. To test a horse by mounting it and observing its performance, even the common hunter cannot doubt whether it is swift or strong.

To observe one’s bearing and attire, or listen to their words, even **Zhòngní** cannot definitively judge whether they are a true gentleman.

To test them in office and assess their achievements, even the common folk cannot doubt their competence or folly.

Thus, the wise ruler’s officials—his ministers and generals—must arise from the ranks of the **zhōubù** (state officials) and **sùwǔ** (common soldiers).

If those with merit are rewarded, then titles and emoluments become abundant, and the people are all the more encouraged. If promotions and succession in rank are given, then offices grow grander, and governance becomes all the more refined.

If titles and emoluments are abundant and offices are well-governed, this is the **Way** of the king.

A thousand-li stretch of flat stone cannot be called wealth, nor a million **xiàngrén** (army of a hundred thousand) be called strength. The stone is not small, nor the numbers few—but they cannot be called wealth or strength, for the stone does not produce grain, and the **xiàngrén** cannot be made to confront the enemy.

Now, the **shāngguān** (mercenary officials) and **technical/artistic** (技艺) men also do not till the land to eat, so the land that is not tilled is akin to the flat stone. The **rú** (gentlemen) and **xiá** (chivalrous knights) do not bear military burdens, yet if they are honored and elevated, the people are not made to serve—this is like the **xiàngrén** being used for purposes other than war.

Those who know the calamities of flat stone and the **xiàngrén**, yet do not recognize that the calamities lie in the **shāngguān** and **rú-xiá** as the land that is not tilled and the people not made to serve, are ignorant of their kindred failings.

Hence, even if the kings of rival states expound my principles, I will not give tribute and submit to them. Even if the feudal lords within the **Guān Zhōu** (Pass Region) do not follow my conduct, I will still compel them to present their captives and attend my court.

Thus, when strength is abundant, others come to pay homage; when strength is meager, one must pay homage to others. Therefore, enlightened rulers strive to cultivate strength.

A stern household has no fierce bandits, yet a benevolent mother may have a wayward son. From this, I know that stern authority can curb violence, but abundant virtue is insufficient to stop disorder.

When the Sage governs a state, he does not rely on people being inherently good for me, but rather on their inability to act wickedly. Relying on people being inherently good, there would be no more than one in ten within the borders; relying on their inability to act wickedly, an entire state can be made orderly.

Those who govern must employ the many and discard the few. Thus, they do not seek virtue but rather laws.

If one must depend on arrows that straighten themselves, there would be no arrows for a hundred generations. If one must depend on wheels that form themselves, there would be no carts for a thousand years. Yet if arrows that straighten themselves and wheels that form themselves truly existed, why does the world still use carts and shoot game? It is because of the **Dao** of *yǐnbā* (hidden brackets/artificial means).

Even if someone has arrows that straighten themselves and wheels that form themselves without relying on *yǐnbā*, skilled artisans would not value them. Why? Because the rider is not a single person, nor is the shooter a single arrow.

If a wise ruler does not rely on rewards and punishments while expecting citizens to be inherently good, he will not be esteemed. Why? Because state laws cannot be abandoned, and the subjects he governs are not just one person.

Therefore, rulers of discernment do not follow the occasional goodness of others, nor do they pursue the path of what is merely expedient. Occasional, I mean, as in chance occurrences.

Now, if someone tells a ruler: "If you command your son to be both wise and long-lived, the world will surely call you mad." Wisdom is innate; longevity is fate. Innate qualities and fate are not things one learns from others, yet to persuade people with what they cannot achieve is why the world calls this madness.

If called impossible, then it is a misguided instruction. Instruction, too, is innate. To teach with benevolence is to instruct with wisdom and longevity—such words are rejected by rulers who understand governance.

Thus, even if one praises the beauty of **Máo Shì** (Mao Qiqiao) and **Xī Shī** (Xi Shi), it is of no benefit to my face. Using cosmetics and rouge only enhances their original allure. Speaking of the benevolence and righteousness of former kings is of no use in governing.

Enlightening my laws and punishments, ensuring they are strictly followed, is like applying cosmetics and rouge to the state. Therefore, wise rulers hasten to aid their people and delay their praise, never speaking of benevolence and righteousness. Today, soothsayers and shamans bless people, saying: "May you live a thousand autumns and ten thousand years."

The sound of "a thousand autumns and ten thousand years" is deafening to the ears, yet a single day’s life cannot be guaranteed by others—this is why people disregard soothsayers and shamans.

Now, the scholars of the world instruct rulers, not speaking of what can be done to govern today, but rather of the achievements of past governance. They do not examine the workings of official laws or investigate the motives of deceitful and wicked men, yet they all speak of ancient traditions and praise the accomplishments of former kings.

The **Rú** (Confucians) embellish their words, saying: "If you heed my teachings, you can become a conqueror and king." This is the soothsaying of the scholars—rulers who understand governance do not accept it.

Thus, wise rulers implement practical measures, discard what is useless, and do not speak of benevolence and righteousness. They do not listen to the words of those who study.

Now, those who do not know governance will always say: "Gain the hearts of the people." If gaining the hearts of the people were sufficient for governance, then **Yī Yǔ** (伊尹) and **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) would have no purpose. They would simply listen to the people and that would be all.

The people’s wisdom is as useless as the mind of an infant. If an infant’s head is not shaved, its belly aches; if the head wound is not treated, the pain worsens. If not treated with *yōngyí* (boils and sores), the condition worsens further. If one *yǐnbā* (presses and forces) the boil to burst and exposes it, another person must hold the infant, and even a tender mother would treat it, yet the infant still cries without ceasing. The infant does not know that its minor suffering leads to greater benefit.

Now, if a ruler presses the people to till the fields and cultivate crops to enrich their livelihoods, yet calls this cruelty. If he enforces strict punishments to curb evil, yet calls this harshness. If he levies taxes and collects grain to fill the granaries and prepare for famine and military campaigns, yet calls this greed. If he ensures that every subject within the borders knows martial discipline and does not privately dissolve into weakness, if he unites their strength to engage in fierce combat to capture enemies, yet calls this brutality—these four measures are what bring stability to the state, yet the people do not know to rejoice in them.

Seeking **Saints** and **Tōng** (universally enlightened) scholars is because the people’s wisdom is insufficient to be relied upon for governance. In ancient times, **Yǔ** (Great Yu) drained the rivers and dredged the floods, yet the people gathered bricks and stones to strike him. They sought to harm him. **Zǐ Chǎn** (子产) opened uncultivated land and planted mulberry trees, yet the people of **Zhèng** (郑) slandered and criticized him. Yu benefited the whole world, and Zǐ Chǎn preserved Zhèng, yet both were condemned by the people. The people’s wisdom is indeed insufficient for governance.

Therefore, to promote scholars while seeking wise and virtuous ones, or to govern with the aim of pleasing the people, are both sources of chaos—these are not paths to true governance.

Thus, the **Han Feizi** concludes.

**Han Feizi, Chapter Twenty: On Loyalty and Filial Piety (Fifth-One)**

The world universally regards the Dao of filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, and obedience as correct, yet none truly discern and practice it properly—thus the world is in chaos.

All follow the Dao of Yao and Shun as correct and model themselves after it, yet this leads to regicide and filial disobedience.

Yao, as a ruler, failed to rule his ministers; Shun, as a minister, failed to serve his ruler; Tang and Wu, as ministers, killed their sovereigns, executed their corpses, and yet the world praises them—this is why the world remains disordered to this day.

What is called a "wise ruler" is one who can cultivate his ministers. What is called an "accomplished minister" is one who clarifies laws and regulations, manages offices, and upholds his ruler. Yet Yao, though he believed himself wise, could not cultivate Shun; Shun, though he believed himself accomplished, could not uphold Yao; Tang and Wu, though they believed themselves righteous, killed their sovereigns—these are the ways of both wise rulers and accomplished ministers.

Thus, to this day, sons seize their fathers’ households, and ministers seize their rulers’ states. When a father yields to his son, or a ruler yields to his minister, this is not the way to establish proper hierarchy and order.

What I have heard is this: when a minister serves his ruler, a son serves his father, and a wife serves her husband, if these three relationships are in harmony, the world is governed; if they are reversed, the world is in chaos. This is the constant Dao of the world, and even kings and accomplished ministers cannot alter it.

If a ruler, though unworthy, does not dare to encroach, then order is maintained. Yet today, rulers promote the wise without fixed principles, which is contrary to the Dao. Yet the world still regards this as governance. Thus, the Tian Clan overthrew the Lü Clan in Qi, and the Dai Clan overthrew the Zi Clan in Song—these were all accomplished and wise men, not foolish or unworthy ones.

Thus, abandoning fixed principles to promote the wise leads to chaos, and disregarding laws to rely on cleverness leads to peril. Therefore, it is said: *"Follow the law, do not exalt the wise."*

The Records say: *"Shun saw his blind father, and his expression was distressed."* Distressed means sorrowful. Confucius said: *"At that time, how perilous it was! The world trembled, and those who followed the Dao could neither be sons to their fathers nor ministers to their rulers."*

I say: Confucius did not truly understand the Dao of filial piety, loyalty, and obedience.

Then, does the Dao require that one, when advancing, cannot be a minister to his ruler, and when retreating, cannot be a son to his father?

A father desires an accomplished son to enrich his impoverished household and alleviate his suffering. A ruler desires an accomplished minister to govern his chaotic state and elevate his diminished status. Yet if an accomplished son does not serve his father, the father’s household remains in hardship. If an accomplished minister does not serve his ruler, the ruler’s position remains in peril.

Thus, even if a father has an accomplished son and a ruler has an accomplished minister, it is only to bring harm—how can it bring benefit?

What is called a "loyal minister" does not endanger his ruler, and a "filial son" does not defy his parents. Yet Shun, through his virtue, seized his ruler’s state, and Tang and Wu, through their righteousness, expelled and killed their sovereigns—these are all cases where virtue endangered the ruler, yet the world praises them.

The ancient "heroic worthies" did not serve their rulers when advancing nor maintain their families when retreating—they were those who, when advancing, defied their rulers, and when retreating, defied their parents.

Moreover, to not serve one’s ruler when advancing and to not maintain one’s family when retreating is the path of chaos in turbulent times, leading to the extinction of lineages.

Thus, to praise the virtuous Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu as heroic worthies is the art of bringing chaos to the world.

Gǔsǒu exiled Shun, and Xiàng, as Shun’s brother, killed him—exiling one’s father and killing one’s brother cannot be called *ren* (benevolence). To marry the two daughters of the Emperor of Heaven and seize the world cannot be called *yì* (righteousness). Without *ren* or *yì*, it cannot be called *míng* (enlightened).

The *Odes* say:
*"Under the vast heavens, there is none not the sovereign’s land;
Along the shores of the earth, there is none not the sovereign’s subject."*

If we take the *Odes* literally, then Shun, when outside, was a minister to his ruler, and when inside, was a minister to his father, a servant to his mother, and a husband to his ruler’s daughters.

Thus, heroic worthies do not maintain their families in times of chaos, leading to the extinction of lineages, and externally they rebel against their rulers, leaving their rotting bones and decaying flesh scattered across the land and rivers, not shunning stepping in water or fire, compelling the world to emulate them—this is why the world universally desires early death rather than a long life of suffering, all because they abandon the world’s order and fail to govern it properly.

What the world calls "heroic worthies" are those who separate themselves from the masses, act differently from others, and practice the doctrine of *tiándàn* (serene indifference) while speaking in *huǎnghū* (vague and confused) terms.

I say: *Tiándàn* is a doctrine of uselessness, and *huǎnghū* is speech without law. When words arise from lawlessness and teachings arise from uselessness, the world follows them in confusion.

I say that human life must serve one’s ruler and nourish one’s parents—one cannot practice *tiándàn*. Those who speak must use loyal, sincere, and lawful discourse—one cannot speak in *huǎnghū* terms.

The speech of *huǎnghū* and the doctrine of *tiándàn* are the arts of confusing the world.

A filial son serves his father not to compete for his father’s household.

A loyal minister serves his ruler not to compete for his ruler’s realm.

A son who constantly praises another’s parents by saying, *“So-and-so’s parents rise before dawn and retire late, toiling tirelessly to enrich their descendants and servants,”* is slandering his own parents. A minister who constantly extols the virtues of former kings and wishes for their return is defaming his current ruler.

If one does not praise another’s parents, he is called unfilial, yet if one does not praise another’s ruler, the world calls him virtuous—this is how disorder arises.

Thus, a minister should not speak of the excellence of Yao and Shun, should not praise the conquests of Tang and Wu, nor should he speak of the lofty deeds of heroic worthies. Instead, he should exhaust his efforts in upholding the law and focus his heart on serving his lord—that is the way of a loyal minister.

In ancient times, the common people were forgetful, dull, and ignorant—*dài* (forgetful) being a description of those who lose their sense of propriety. Thus, they could be swayed by empty titles.

Now, the people are cunning and clever, desiring self-interest and refusing to obey their superiors. The ruler must first encourage them with rewards before they will advance, and then threaten them with punishment before they will refrain from retreat.

Yet the world says: *“Yu You declined the throne, so rewards are insufficient to encourage virtue. Zhi the robber courted death for profit, so punishments are insufficient to deter crime.”*

I say: There are those who, before obtaining the throne, do not seek to rule—Yu You is one such. There are those who, after obtaining the throne, do not seek to rule—Yao and Shun are such. There are those who destroy their integrity for wealth, court punishment for gain, and forget their own death—Zhi the robber is such.

These two extremes are aberrations of nature, and they should not be the measure by which to govern the state or use the people.

Governance is the governance of the constant. The Way is the Way of the constant. Clever words about aberrations are the ruin of governance.

The highest caliber of men in the world cannot be encouraged by rewards, and the lowest cannot be restrained by punishments. Yet if one does not set rewards for the highest and punishments for the lowest, the Way of governing the state and using the people is lost.

Thus, ministers of the age often speak not of the laws of the state but of *cónghéng* (alliances and strategies). Those who speak of alliances say: *“If alliances succeed, one will become a hegemon.”* Those who speak of strategies say: *“If strategies succeed, one will become a king.”* Though the talk of alliances and strategies in the Eastern lands never ceases, yet no hegemon or king arises from it—empty words cannot bring about true governance.

A true king acts alone and is called a king. Thus, the Three Sovereigns did not rely on alliances to establish order, nor did the Five Hegemons await strategies to discern the Way—they simply governed internally to regulate externally.

**On the Peril of the Ruler**
The reason a ruler’s person is in danger and his state falls is that his great ministers are too powerful, and his attendants too formidable.

By “powerful,” I mean those who act without law, wield state authority for private gain. By “formidable,” I mean those who monopolize influence and weigh decisions lightly.

These two must be carefully observed.

A horse’s ability to bear heavy loads and pull carriages over long distances comes from its sinews and strength. A ruler of ten thousand chariots or a lord of a thousand chariots subdues the world and conquers the feudal lords through his might and authority—might and authority are the sinews and strength of the ruler.

If great ministers seize authority and attendants monopolize power, then the ruler loses his strength. A ruler who loses his strength cannot retain his state—there is not one in a thousand who can.

A tiger or leopard’s ability to overpower men and dominate beasts comes from its claws and teeth. If one were to deprive a tiger or leopard of its claws and teeth, men would surely dominate it.

Now, those who wield great power are the ruler’s claws and teeth. If a ruler loses them, he is like a tiger or leopard stripped of its fangs.

The ruler of Song lost his claws and teeth to Zi Han, and Duke Jing of Qi lost his to Tian Chang. Yet they did not act swiftly to remove them, so they met with death and their states fell.

Now, rulers without skill all claim to know the mistakes of Song and Duke Jing, yet they fail to recognize their own errors or examine the patterns of these events.

Moreover, those who practice the Way of law and technique cannot coexist with ministers in power. How do I know this?

When a ruler has skilled advisors, great ministers cannot dominate decisions, and attendants dare not sell their influence. When the power of ministers and attendants wanes, the ruler’s Way becomes clear.

But it is not so now. Those in power monopolize influence, act arbitrarily for private gain, and their attendants form factions to suppress outsiders. Thus, skilled advisors have no opportunity to advance, and the ruler has no chance to deliberate.

Therefore, even if one has skill, it is not necessarily used, and power cannot be shared—how can skilled advisors avoid peril?

Thus, a ruler cannot merely reject the schemes of great ministers or abandon the petitions of his attendants; he must align himself with the Way and speak truly.

Then how can skilled advisors risk death to offer counsel?

This is why the world remains disordered.

An enlightened ruler bestows rank and reward according to merit, assigns offices according to ability, and ensures that those he promotes are truly virtuous and those he employs are truly capable. When virtuous and capable men advance, private entreaties cease.

Those who earn great rewards must have rendered great service, and those who hold high office must have great ability. Thus, mercenaries will not cling to private valor but strive to repel enemies, and those who seek office will not be hindered by private connections but focus on integrity.

This is how virtuous and capable men are gathered while private factions are dispersed.

Now, attendants are not necessarily wise, yet the ruler may know of someone’s wisdom and listen to him. When that person enters, he debates with the attendants, and the ruler, listening to the attendants rather than judging wisdom, is like one who consults fools on matters of intelligence.

Those in power are not necessarily virtuous, yet the ruler may know of someone’s virtue and honor him. When that person enters, he debates with those in power, and the ruler, listening to their words rather than using the virtuous, is like one who consults the unworthy on matters of virtue.

Thus, the wise are forced to strategize with fools, and the virtuous must compete with the unworthy. When will virtuous and wise men find opportunity to serve, and when will the ruler’s clarity be unobstructed?

Now, the wise are constrained to devise strategies for foolish men, and the virtuous must vie with the unworthy. When will the virtuous and wise find opportunity to serve, and when shall the ruler’s clarity be unobstructed?

In times past, Guan Longfeng remonstrated King Jie, and his four limbs were mutilated. Wangzi Bidān admonished King Zhou, and his heart was pierced. Zichu was loyal and upright to Lord Fu Chai, yet he was executed at Shǔ Luò. These three men, as subjects, were not without loyalty, nor were their remonstrances ill-timed. Yet they could not escape the calamity of death because their rulers failed to discern the words of the virtuous and wise, and instead were ensnared by the folly of the unworthy.

Now, if the ruler does not employ those skilled in law and strategy, but instead listens to the unworthy and foolish ministers, who among the virtuous and wise would dare to risk the peril these three men faced and offer their counsel? This is the cause of the world’s chaos.

**Precept 53:** If laws are enforced without deviation, then officials will have no opportunity for corruption. When laws are balanced, officials will be without deceit. Laws having been established, do not sell them with flattering words.

To reward merit, the people will speak little. To reward virtue, the people will speak much.

To administer justice with flexibility and partiality, ruling by the five *li* is the way of kings. The king must verify the five *li* before deciding guilt and punishment—this is the true way of kingship. To rule by the nine *li* is the way of the strong, for they are both kings and powerful. Those who rely on past precedents will be diminished.

*Host* means to entrust. If laws are entrusted without proper oversight, they will surely be eroded.

To govern with punishments, to wage war with rewards, and to bestow generous stipends upon those skilled in strategy. If those who oversee the markets are held accountable for their transgressions, then the markets will be free of deceit.

When goods are abundant and the populace numerous, but agriculture slackens while corruption flourishes, the state will surely be diminished.

If the people have surplus food, yet it is taken from them in the form of *sù* (grain tax), and if titles are granted without regard to merit, then the populace will grow weary and negligent. Though the rewards may be small, if they are not justly earned, they cannot be sustained.

To grant titles and stipends without consideration of merit is to render them unsustainable. A state that awards titles and stipends based on merit—this is called fostering wise counsel and valor in battle—will have no rival.

A state that awards titles and stipends based on merit will see those who excel in governance grow few in number, and words of obstruction will be silenced. This is called removing governance with governance, silencing speech with speech, and awarding titles and stipends based on merit. Thus, such a state will be mighty, and none under heaven will dare to invade it.

When armies are deployed, they must take victory. When victory is achieved, it must be held. To muster troops without attacking is to invite disaster.

In matters of the court, minor offenses should not be magnified, and titles should be granted based on merit. Though there may be objections in the court, none should be allowed to interfere. This is called governance by fixed rules.

To attack with force, one must expend one to gain ten. To attack with words, one must expend ten to lose a hundred. A state that favors force is difficult to assault. A state that favors words is easy to attack.

To excel in ability is to overcome one’s harm. To lighten the burdens of the people while cultivating the Dao and directing their surplus strength toward the heart, none will bear the responsibility of holding office for the ruler, nor will there be hidden resentments. Thus, those who excel will not interfere with one another, and there will be no litigation.

To prevent officers from holding multiple positions, their skills will flourish. To ensure that people are not rewarded for the same merit, there will be no contention. This is called making the state easy to attack.

Heavy punishments and sparse rewards, with the ruler cherishing the people, yet the people dying for rewards. Many rewards and light punishments, with the ruler not cherishing the people, yet the people not valuing them.

When profits are taken from one source alone, the state will have no rival. When profits are taken from two sources, half the troops will be ineffective. When profits are taken from ten sources, the people will not defend it.

To impose severe punishments on minor offenses, minor offenses will not arise; to impose light punishments on severe offenses, severe offenders will not come. This is called removing punishments with punishments.

If crimes are severe yet punishments are light, light punishments will breed more offenses—this is called inviting punishments with punishments. Such a state will surely be diminished.

**Precept 54:** The governance of the people by the sage is measured by their nature, not indulging their desires, but aiming solely at their benefit. Thus, when he imposes punishments upon them, it is not to harm the people, but to cherish their foundation.

When punishments prevail, the people are tranquil. When rewards are excessive, corruption arises. Therefore, in governing the people, punishments must prevail—this is the priority of governance. Excessive rewards are the root of disorder.

The nature of the people is to delight in chaos and not to embrace the law. Thus, the wise ruler in governing his state must make rewards clear so that the people are encouraged to perform meritorious deeds, and punishments severe so that the people adhere to the law. Encouraging meritorious deeds means public affairs will not be transgressed; adhering to the law means corruption will not take root.

Therefore, in governing the people, one must suppress corruption before it arises. In waging war, one must win the hearts of the people. Suppressing corruption at its source is governance; winning the hearts of the people in battle is victory. The sage governs the people by first addressing governance, and first waging war by winning the hearts of the people.

If a ruler governs by first attending to governance, his state will be strong. If he wages war by first winning the hearts of the people, he will be victorious. A state that first attends to governance and unifies the people’s hearts, that raises the public while ignoring private matters, that grants rewards for meritorious deeds while corruption does not arise, that clarifies the law while governance is not burdensome—such a state will be strong. A state that cannot do these four things will be weak.

The reason a state becomes strong is governance. The reason a ruler is honored is authority. Thus, the wise ruler has authority and governance, while the disordered ruler also has authority and governance, but their accumulation differs, leading to divergent outcomes.

Therefore, the wise ruler wields authority while upholding severity, unifies governance while his state is orderly. Thus, the law is the foundation of kingship, and punishment is the means by which the ruler cherishes the people.

The nature of the people is to abhor labor and delight in ease. Ease leads to neglect; neglect leads to disorder; disorder leads to chaos. If rewards and punishments are not implemented across the land, they will surely be obstructed.

Thus, if one seeks to achieve great merit but finds it difficult to inspire effort, great merit cannot be attained. If one seeks to enforce governance but finds it difficult to change established habits, the people’s disorder cannot be rectified.

Therefore, governance of the people has no fixed rule—only governance itself is the rule. Laws that adapt with the times bring order; governance that suits the world brings merit.

If the people are simple and governed by naming conventions, order will prevail. In a knowing age, maintained by punishments, they will obey. If governance does not change with the times, disorder will arise. If governance cannot adapt to the people’s abilities, the state will be diminished.

Thus, the sage’s governance of the people must adjust laws with the times and adapt prohibitions to the people’s capacities.

To surpass others in land-based strength is to achieve wealth. To surpass others in raising strength against enemies is to achieve power. A state that does not obstruct its power will attain kingship.

Thus, the **Dao of Kingship** lies in what is heard and what is obstructed. He who blocks deceit will surely achieve kingship, for the **King’s strategy** does not rely on the world’s chaos not arising—it relies on its impossibility of arising. To rely on the world’s chaos not arising and yet establish governance is to court decline; to rely on its impossibility of arising and enforce law is to flourish. Therefore, the virtuous ruler governs his state by adhering to the **art of the unassailable**.

When titles are honored, the sovereign is held in esteem, so rewards and ranks are bestowed upon merit, and thus wickedness finds no foothold. Those who excel in strength hold noble ranks, and noble ranks elevate the sovereign—an exalted sovereign will surely achieve kingship. A state that does not value strength but relies on private scholars will see its ranks debased, its sovereign humbled, and thus decline is inevitable.

Therefore, the **principles of establishing a state and utilizing the people** are this: if a ruler can close off external threats, suppress private factions, and rely on his own virtue, then kingship may be attained.

**Chapter 55: On Establishing Distinctions**

A state where the ruler is vast and the sovereign is exalted has never failed to be one where laws are severe and commands reach throughout the realm. Thus, the ruler who establishes ranks and rewards must ensure that laws are strict and weighty.

When a state is well-governed, the people are at ease; when affairs are disordered, the nation is in peril. Heavy laws align with human nature, while light prohibitions lose their efficacy. Moreover, the people’s very lives are their own to expend—no one fails to give their utmost to attain their desires. Yet what they love or hate is determined by the sovereign: the people love wealth and rank but hate punishments. The sovereign wields their affections to guide the people’s strength, so the efficacy of governance must not be neglected.

Yet when prohibitions are light and governance falters, it is because punishments and rewards are misapplied. If governing the people does not adhere to law, then even well-doing becomes meaningless—this is to have no law at all. Thus, the principle of order and chaos demands that distinguishing punishments and rewards be urgent.

All who govern a state have laws, yet some perish while others endure. Those that perish fail to distinguish punishments and rewards. Governors who do distinguish them may still err by treating them as mere differences rather than true divisions. Only the enlightened ruler truly divides them, so his people revere the law and fear prohibitions, desiring only to avoid guilt and daring not to share in rewards. Thus it is said: *The people obey without need of punishments or rewards.*

Therefore, in a perfectly governed state, the primary concern is to stop deceit. How so? Its laws penetrate human nature and align with governance. Then how does one eliminate subtle deceit? By ensuring that people scrutinize each other’s intentions. How does one enforce mutual surveillance? Through **neighborhood mutual liability**—when one in a neighborhood commits a crime, guilt is imputed to all. If prohibitions still fail to deter because they do not implicate the self, then fear of punishment is lost, and the hunt for deceit becomes futile. Those with deceitful intentions cannot forget it when many watch. Thus, one must be cautious of oneself while observing others. To expose hidden deceit, those who report faults are rewarded, while those who conceal them face severe punishments and connected crimes. Thus, deceitful types are uncovered. Deceit cannot thrive when private accusations and mutual liability are enforced. *Li* (任) means *guarantee*—those who guarantee their neighbors are held accountable, hence *mutual liability*.

The most enlightened governance relies on **fixed measures, not personal favor**. Thus, in a well-ordered state, if one does not rely on reputation, governance will be flawless, and the realm will be harmonious—this is the power of fixed measures. A failing state allows soldiers to act arbitrarily within its borders without restraint, for it relies on personal favor without fixed rules. Self-attack is the work of men; attacking others is the work of measures. Therefore, an enlightened state abandons rhetoric and relies on law.

Extraordinary deeds that follow prescribed measures are difficult to discern, just as over-punishment for mere words is hard to justify. Thus, punishments and rewards become confused. What is meant by "following measures is hard to discern"? It refers to deceitful merit. What is meant by "over-punishment for words is hard to justify"? It refers to unjustified accusations. If one judges by appearances without seeing hollow merit, or measures emotions without uncovering deceitful roots, how can both not err? Thus, empty scholars establish reputations within while empty talkers scheme without, so the foolish, cowardly, brave, and wise become entangled in false **Dao**, deceiving the world. Hence, laws are ignored, and punishments are not applied to the guilty. If this is so, how can punishments and rewards avoid confusion?

Thus, when governance reaches its limits, its principles lose their measure. The loss of measure is not the law’s fault—it is because fixed laws are abandoned in favor of cleverness. If laws are discarded and cleverness relied upon, how can those entrusted with affairs fulfill their duties? If duties and affairs do not align, how can laws avoid failure, and punishments avoid excess? Thus, rewards and punishments bring chaos, the path of the state goes astray, and the failure to distinguish them becomes evident.
