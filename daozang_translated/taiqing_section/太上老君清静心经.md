The Supreme Lord Lao said:
The Dao is fundamentally one of purity and turbidity, one of stillness and movement. Purity and stillness are its root; turbidity and movement are its branches. Thus, yang is pure and yin is turbid; yang moves and yin is still. The male is pure and the female is turbid; the male moves and the female is still. Descending from root to branch, the myriad things are born. Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement. If one can attain purity and stillness, the world will hold them in highest esteem.

The spirit of humanity favors purity, yet the mind disturbs it; the human mind favors stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the mind will naturally become still. If one can settle the mind, the spirit will naturally become pure. Then the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will vanish. Those who cannot achieve this fail because their minds are unsettled and their desires undispelled.

Those who can dispel them observe inwardly the mind—yet the mind has no mind; observe outwardly the form—yet the form has no form; observe afar the things—yet things have no things. When these three are unattainable, only emptiness is seen. Observing emptiness, emptiness too is empty; emptiness has no emptiness. Since there is no "nothingness," even "no nothingness" is absent. Profoundly and eternally quiescent, quiescence has no quiescence. Without quiescence, quiescence is absent—all is thoroughly void. How then could desires arise?

Since desires do not arise, the mind is naturally still. With the mind naturally still, the spirit is undisturbed. With the spirit undisturbed, one abides in constant purity and stillness. Abiding in constant purity and stillness, one merges with the Dao. To merge with the true Dao is called "attaining the Dao."

Though called "attaining the Dao," in truth there is nothing attained. Since nothing is attained, it is forcibly named "attainment." For the transformation of sentient beings, the expedient path is opened.

The Supreme Lord Lao said:
The Dao can be attained because it resides within one’s own mind. When the mind attains the Dao, the Dao does not cause attainment. This is the Dao of self-attainment, not to be named "attainment." Thus, it is said that in truth there is nothing attained.

The Supreme Lord Lao said:
The Dao cannot be attained because one perceives a mind. Having perceived a mind, one then perceives a body. Having perceived a body, one then perceives the myriad things. Having perceived the myriad things, attachment arises. With attachment, afflictions arise. With afflictions, deluded thoughts arise. Once deluded thoughts arise, they touch the emotions and lead to confusion, plunging one into the turbid sea, drifting through birth and death, suffering the torments of hell, forever severed from the Dao.

If one abides in constant purity and stillness, one naturally attains the Dao.

Thus, a gāthā is spoken:

The wondrous workings of the Heavenly Worthy are ever before the eyes,
Every movement of body and mind is naturally so.
Cease the moving mind and observe where it moves—
Where it moves is boundless, its edges clearly seen.
Yet boundaries, by nature, are fundamentally empty;
Not by observing the mind is emptiness attained.
Awakening to causes and conditions as devoid of self-nature,
One effortlessly enters the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Within and beyond the palace, radiance shines bright;
The myriad dharmas, perfect within the One Dao, are level.
The pure mind, like a mirror, gleams unobstructed;
Unobstructed and mindless, the mind is free.
The level Dao is equal, without distinction;
Who then assigns heaven and hell?
With the spirit inwardly quiescent, neither lacking nor full,
Good and evil, like emptiness, have no place to arise.
Only because ordinary beings hold divergent views
Do they forcibly erect divisions upon the earth.
Though divisions bring a thousand kinds of suffering,
Each examined closely has no sovereign lord.
Examining closely, no lord means no origin;
Only this dependent arising is the meeting point.
Though meeting occurs within, it is ever unmet;
Let go of meeting, practice non-action, and allow things to flow.
If there is one who knows the meaning of this scripture,
Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down,
Who can recite it with sincere mind and deeply uphold it,
They will eradicate measureless karmic obstructions and all evil,
And their enemies will attain harmony, free from suffering.
External demons and heterodox paths will be subdued by the Dao.
To all sentient beings seeking deliverance from calamity,
Let each purify themselves and faithfully receive and practice this teaching.

**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Pure and Tranquil Mind concludes.**

"Those who attain this awakening may transmit the sagely Dao."

The two following passages beginning with *"Lao Jun yue"* (The Supreme Lord Lao says) correspond to the section in the *Scripture of Pure Tranquility* that reads: *"The superior person engages in no contention; the inferior person delights in contention,"* and so forth, though the wording differs considerably.

The subsequent verses beginning with *"Thus, he spoke in gatha"* do not appear in the *Scripture of Pure Tranquility.*
