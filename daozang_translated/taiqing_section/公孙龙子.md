**Gongsun Longzi, Fascicle One**
By Gongsun Long of Zhao

**1. Jifu (Traces of the Ancients)**
*Fu* means "to gather." The traces of discourses and debates are collected in this fascicle, hence its title.

Gongsun Long was a debater of the Warring States period. Distressed by the chaos of names and realities, he drew upon his innate talents to compose the discourse *Shoubai* ("Defending Whiteness"). Borrowing objects as metaphors, he argued for whiteness to clarify distinctions.

All things possess inherent capacities, which the sage employs. Yet when diverse talents vie in debate, each clinging to its strengths, they distort right and wrong, subverting the upright with sophistry. Thus, rewards and punishments no longer issue from the Son of Heaven, while power and fortune fall to usurping ministers.

Gongsun Long lamented the absence of an enlightened ruler and the divergence of names from their true referents. He thus employed *zhiwu* (pointing at things) to confound right and wrong, and through the *baimalun* ("white horse") parable, harmonized self and other, hoping to awaken contemporary lords and rectify names and realities.

He asserted that a "white horse" is not a "horse." The term *white* designates color, while *horse* designates form. Color is not form, nor is form color. To speak of color is to exclude form; to speak of form is to exclude color. To conflate them as a single thing is erroneous.

If one seeks a white horse in a herd, none may be found—only horses of black or other hues. Yet these cannot be called white horses. If they cannot be called white horses, then the sought-after horse vanishes. If it vanishes, then a white horse is ultimately not a horse.

Through this argument, he sought to rectify names and realities and transform the world. Though the bodies of horses do not differ, their colors—yellow or white—do. By mutually refuting such distinctions, right and wrong become indistinguishable. Thus, he employed this debate to rectify names and realities.

Gongsun Long met Kong Chuan at the residence of Lord Pingyuan of Zhao. Kong Chuan said: "I have long heard of your lofty principles and wished to become your disciple. However, I cannot accept your claim that a white horse is not a horse. If you abandon this doctrine, I will gladly become your disciple."

Gongsun Long replied: "Your words are perverse. The reason I am known is precisely because of the *baimalun*. If I were to abandon it, I would have nothing to teach. Moreover, those who seek me as a teacher do so because their wisdom and learning are inferior to mine. If you demand that I abandon my teaching before becoming my disciple, this would be teaching before taking a teacher—a reversal of proper order. Such a demand is absurd.

Furthermore, the claim that a white horse is not a horse aligns with Confucius’ own principles. Confucius said: *'It is necessary to rectify names.'* I use the white horse to rectify names and realities, and thus Confucius would approve.

I have heard that the King of Chu drew his *Fanruo* bow and carried his *Wanggui* arrows to hunt dragons and rhinoceroses in the Yunmeng marshes, only to lose his bow. His attendants offered to search for it, but the king said: *'Stop. A man of Chu has lost his bow; a man of Chu will find it. Why search further?'*

When Confucius heard this, he said: *'The King of Chu is benevolent and righteous, yet he falls short. He should have said, "A man has lost his bow; a man will find it." Why specify Chu?'*

In this, Confucius distinguished between the King of Chu’s notion of *man* and his own. The king, having lost his bow, sought only to benefit Chu and could not extend his concern to all under Heaven. Thus, his benevolence and righteousness were incomplete.

Rulers who favor their own faction resemble those who, in seeking a white horse, admit only white horses. The King of Chu’s *man* referred only to the people of Chu, whereas Confucius’ *man* encompassed all under Heaven. Thus, if one abandons *white* in seeking a horse, all horses will come. If one forgets *Chu* to benefit all people, the world will respond in kind.

Confucius distinguished the King of Chu’s *man* from his own, yet you deem my distinction between a white horse and a horse perverse. You study the Confucian arts yet reject what Confucius himself would approve. If you demand that I abandon my teaching before becoming my disciple, even a hundred such demands would leave me unable to face you as your teacher."

Kong Chuan had no reply.

Though the teachings of the sages differ, their ultimate aim is the same. Petty scholars, confined to their own doctrines, cannot grasp the broader truth. They cling to what they know and revile what they do not understand. Thus, even if one were a hundred times more worthy, Gongsun Long could not face him as a teacher—just as one who seeks only a white horse loses much.

Gongsun Long was a retainer of Lord Pingyuan of Zhao. Kong Chuan was a descendant of Confucius. When they met, Kong Chuan said to Gongsun Long: "I dwell in Lu and have long heard of your wisdom and conduct, wishing to study under you. Yet the only thing I cannot accept is your claim that a white horse is not a horse. If you abandon this doctrine, I will become your disciple."

Gongsun Long replied: "Your words are perverse. My teaching is precisely that a white horse is not a horse. If I were to abandon it, I would have nothing to teach. To study under me after demanding I abandon my teaching is absurd.

Moreover, those who seek me as a teacher do so because their wisdom and learning are inferior to mine. If you instruct me to abandon the *baimalun* before becoming my disciple, this would be teaching before taking a teacher—an improper order.

Your demand resembles King Qi’s question to Yin Wen: *'I greatly esteem scholars, yet Qi has no scholars. Why is this?'*

Yin Wen replied: *'May I ask what Your Majesty means by "scholar"?'*

The king had no answer. Yin Wen continued: *'Suppose there were a man who serves his lord with loyalty, his parents with filial piety, his friends with trust, and his village with harmony...'* "

"Is one who possesses these four virtues to be called a *shi*?" The King of Qi replied, "Excellent. This is truly what I mean by a *shi*."

Yin Wen asked, "If Your Majesty were to obtain such a man, would you be willing to take him as a minister?"

The king said, "This is what I desire, yet it cannot be attained."

At that time, the King of Qi favored courage. The sage’s way of employing men is to use each according to his abilities, making no arbitrary distinctions. The king, however, sought *shi* based on his own preferences—just as one who clings to whiteness in demanding a horse, how could he obtain a true *shi*?

Thereupon, Yin Wen said, "Suppose this man, in the midst of a vast court and great assembly, were insulted yet dared not fight back. Would Your Majesty take him as a minister?"

The king said, "A great *shi*? To be insulted and not fight is shameful. If he is shamed, I would not take him as a minister."

Yin Wen said, "Yet though he does not fight when insulted, he has not lost his four virtues. This man has not lost what makes him a *shi*. Yet Your Majesty would take him as a minister in one case and not in another. Then is the *shi* you spoke of earlier no longer a *shi*?"

The King of Qi had no reply.

Yin Wen said, "Suppose a ruler governs his state: if a man does wrong, he condemns him; if he does no wrong, he also condemns him. If a man has merit, he rewards him; if he has no merit, he also rewards him. Yet he resents that the people do not govern themselves well. Is this acceptable?"

The King of Qi said, "It is not."

Yin Wen said, "Your servant has observed how Your Majesty’s officials govern Qi—their methods are just like this."

The king said, "If I govern the state as you describe, even if the people do not govern themselves well, I dare not resent them. Yet is my intention not yet fully aligned with the Way? The thoughts in my mind have not yet reached the great Dao."

Yin Wen said, "How could I dare speak without explanation? Since I have said Qi’s governance is flawed, how could I not explain the reason?"

"Your Majesty’s decree states: 'Those who kill shall die; those who injure shall be punished.' If a man fears Your Majesty’s decree and, when insulted, does not dare fight, he is preserving Your Majesty’s decree. Yet Your Majesty says, 'To be insulted and not fight is shameful.' To call it shameful is to condemn him. Though he has done no wrong, Your Majesty condemns him, thus removing his name from the register and refusing to take him as a minister. To refuse him as a minister is to punish him. This is to punish one who is without fault.

"Moreover, when Your Majesty shames those who do not dare fight, you must honor those who do. If honoring those who dare fight is right, then Your Majesty must take them as ministers. To take them as ministers is to reward them. Yet they have no merit, and Your Majesty rewards them. What Your Majesty rewards, your officials execute; what the law condemns, you approve. Rewards and punishments, right and wrong—these four contradictions are all in error. Even ten Yellow Emperors could not govern thus."

The King of Qi had no reply.

"If a ruler disregards the law, the state has no governance. Thus, even if ten Yellow Emperors were to arise, they could not save such chaos. Therefore, I say your words resemble those of the King of Qi. You know how to challenge the claim that a white horse is not a horse, yet you do not understand the reasoning behind the challenge. This is like knowing the name of loving *shi* but not examining their categories. To examine the good and bad of *shi* is to classify their abilities and employ them accordingly.

**White Horse Discourse II**

Is it acceptable to say that a white horse is not a horse?

It is acceptable.

To expound subtle words and clarify the kingly Way, one must establish guest and host, engage in exchange, and take a single thing as the origin of myriad transformations. Through discourse, one rectifies the errors between self and other. Thus, the example of the white horse is used to blend similarities and differences.

Why is this so?

A horse is that by which form is named; white is that by which color is named. That which names color is not that which names form. Therefore, it is said: a white horse is not a horse.

Horse-form is an analogy for the forms of all things, all of which are materials for use. Horse-color is a comparison to the categories of all things, each with its own closeness and distance.

If one nurtures all things, the world will be preserved. If one treats people with partiality, the realm will rebel. For example, if one separates color from the naming of a horse, all horses will respond. If one clings to whiteness in seeking a horse, only a white horse will be obtained. Thus, to name form while adhering to a single white color is not to name all horses.

It is said: to have a white horse cannot be called having no horse. Yet to say one cannot be called having no horse is not to say it is a horse. Since there is a white horse, one cannot say there is no horse. Then is a white horse not a horse?

If having a white horse means having a horse, why is the white not a horse?

White and horse are joined, yet white is not horse. Why is this?

If one seeks a horse, yellow and black horses may both be obtained. If one seeks a white horse, yellow and black horses cannot be obtained. Generally, things that are close are few, while those that are distant are many—like the singularity of white among all colors.

Thus, if one separates white in seeking a horse, yellow and black horses will all arrive. If one names a horse by its whiteness, all other colors are excluded. The principle of harmonious governance is likewise.

If a white horse were a horse, then what is sought would be one and the same. If what is sought is one and the same, then white does not differ from horse.

If a white horse were considered a horse, it would merely be one horse, its material no different from other horses.

This is like a ruler’s private favorites: they are merely one person, their worth no different from others.

Human hearts do not remain loyal to one ruler, just as horse-forms are not confined to one color. Thus, if a ruler loves himself, others will attach to him; if he distances himself, they will rebel. How can one favor one’s own kin and distance the world?

If what is sought is not different, why is it that yellow and black horses may or may not be acceptable?

Acceptable and unacceptable—their opposition is clear.

Thus, yellow and black horses are one, and can respond to "having a horse," but cannot respond to "having a white horse." This proves that a white horse is not a horse.

If yellow and black horses are each one horse, not different from horse, yet cannot respond to all horses nor to a white horse, why is this?

White is not yellow; yellow is not white. The five colors are mutually distinct—this is evident."

The ruler, having shown partiality in his treatment of others, will find that others too act with partiality and rebel against him—how then would they willingly heed his commands? Thus, one who insists on "having a white horse" cannot thereby obtain all horses—this is evident.

It is said: To claim that a horse possessing color is not a horse would mean that since the world has no colorless horses, the world would have no horses at all—is this acceptable? Those who assert that a horse with color is not a horse must acknowledge that all horses in the world have color—how then can there be no horses? It is like saying that because all people have kin and strangers, one cannot say there are no people.

It is said: Horses inherently have color, hence there are white horses. If horses had no color, there would only be "horse" and nothing more—how then could there be white horses? Thus, "white" is not "horse." For example, horses all have color, hence there are white horses. If horses fundamentally had no color and there were only "horse," then what would constitute a white horse? It is like saying that people are born of specific lineages, hence there are distinctions between Hua and Yi. If there were fundamentally no clans and only "people," how could there be kin and strangers? Thus, "white" is itself white, not horse. A white horse is the combination of horse and white. Horse and white together form a white horse, hence it is said that a white horse is not a horse. Since white is not horse, white and horse are two distinct things. To combine two things into one body cannot be referred to solely as "horse." Thus, using "horse" to illustrate "white" demonstrates that a white horse is not a horse.

It is said: A horse not yet combined with white is horse; white not yet combined with horse is white. Combining horse and white is then called a white horse. To name something by what it is not combined with is untenable. Hence, to say that a white horse is not a horse is also untenable. This is the guest presenting the host’s doctrine and challenging it.

Horses form a category with other horses; white forms a category with other whites—hence they are "combined." Horses do not combine with white to form horse; white does not combine with horse to form white—hence they are "not combined." To combine horse and white and call it a white horse is to forcibly use white as the name for horse, which is unjustifiable. Thus, to claim that a white horse is not a horse is untenable. The host’s position above is untenable, and the guest’s challenge below is also untenable.

It is said: To assert that having a white horse is having a horse—would it then be acceptable to say that having a white horse is having a yellow horse? It is said: It would not be acceptable. The host presses the guest: If you definitively claim that a white horse is a horse, can a white horse then be considered a yellow horse? The guest replies: It cannot. The host says: To treat having a horse as distinct from having a yellow horse is to distinguish the yellow horse from the horse. Distinguishing the yellow horse from the horse is to treat the yellow horse as not a horse. Since you treat a white horse as a horse, yet a yellow horse cannot be a white horse, it is clear that a yellow horse is not a horse. Those who hold such a position have never not erred. To treat a yellow horse as not a horse while treating a white horse as a horse is like a bird entering a pond or a coffin and outer coffin being placed apart—this is the world’s most perverse and chaotic speech.

Yellow and white are colors; all horses are forms. To forcibly treat color as form is like a bird entering a pond. Yellow horses and white horses are equally horses, yet to select white and discard yellow is like placing a coffin and outer coffin apart. Just as a coffin and outer coffin depend on each other, like teeth and cheeks that rely on one another—when the cheek is lost, the teeth grow cold—so too they cannot be placed apart. The four barbarians guard the outer lands, while the Central States rely on the inner—inner and outer depend on each other, and the world is at peace. If one shows partiality to the Central States and distances the barbarians, the barbarians will rebel. If one mobilizes troops to attack distant lands, the people will be unable to bear the burden, and the Central States will fall into chaos. With internal division and external rebellion, the coffin and outer coffin placed apart, even those the ruler favors cannot alone support him. Thus, to discard yellow and select white is the height of perversity and disorder.

It is said: That a white horse cannot be called "not having a horse" refers to separating white. Yet this separation means that a white horse cannot be called "having a horse." Thus, what constitutes "having a horse" is solely having "horse," not having a white horse. Therefore, "having a horse" cannot be called "having a horse-horse." The guest says: To treat white as separate from having a horse is to separate from reality and claim it is not a horse. However, since horse-form and horse-color are firmly connected, they form two horses sharing one body, which cannot be called "horse-horse"—hence the combined term "white horse."

It is said: "White" is not fixed to what it whitens—it can be disregarded. All things universally possess the color white, hence it is said that white is not fixed to any one thing. Since white is not fixed to horses, and horses are not exclusively white, to forget color in seeking a horse is to have all horses respond. To forget partiality in cherishing others is to have the whole world cherish you. A white horse refers to white being fixed to what it whitens. What is fixed to white is not white itself. White fixed to a horse is the white of the horse—how can it be white on its own? A horse makes no distinction in color, hence yellow and black can both respond. To simply say "horse" is to make no distinction among colors. With no selection, all horses respond; with no exclusion, all colors are present. Thus, the sage, with a serene and empty mind, governs all things with vacuity—hence nothing is not harmonized, and principle is fully realized.

A white horse, however, makes distinctions in color—yellow and black horses are excluded by their color, hence only a white horse can respond. To discard yellow and select white is to have all horses guard their own colors, each distinct and excluded—hence only a white horse responds. If a ruler favors his own kin and distances the world, the world will each guard their own distance, becoming distinct and rebelling. With the whole world in rebellion, who will heed the ruler’s commands? Only his favored ones? Yet those favored alone will only increase disaster, unable to bring peace—they will only bring chaos.

What has no exclusion is not what has exclusion—hence it is said that a white horse is not a horse.

He who does not select white does not exclude yellow—if color is not excluded, then color and horse are not separable. Thus it is said: what has no exclusion is not what has exclusion.

All yellow and white in horses are like closeness and distance among men: if one favors the close and distances all others, the distanced will rebel. When the distanced break away and rebel, even the close cannot stand alone. Hence it is said: a white horse is not a horse.

Therefore, the sage empties the mind to penetrate all things, unifying all principles. He holds the six directions within his breast, yet his spirit鉴 remains abundant; he illuminates the ten thousand images within a square inch, yet his spirit grows ever more still. Thus he dwells among the close without attachment to closeness, abides among the distant without distance. Though he does not select closeness or distance, he does not abandon closeness or distance—thereby the four seas share kinship, and the ten thousand states are threaded as one.

**Book Two of the Gongsun Longzi**
*By Gongsun Long of Zhao*

**Discourse on Pointing to Things, III**

Nothing is not pointed to, yet pointing is not pointing.
Things and I differ in capacity, yet nothing is not mutually pointed to—hence it is said: nothing is not pointed to. Mutual pointing is mutual affirmation and negation. When this and that mutually displace one another, affirmation and negation merge into one, returning to no-pointing—hence it is said: yet pointing is not pointing.

If the world had no pointing, nothing could be called a thing. Pointing is always affirmation and negation, which is why nothing is not pointed to. The nature of all things necessarily involves mutual affirmation and negation. If the world had no things of affirmation and negation, there would not be a single thing that could be called a thing—thus there are things. Precisely because they mutually affirm and negate, nothing is not pointed to.

If pointing does not exist in the world, can things be called pointing?
Nothing is not pointed to, yet it is also said that pointing is not pointing—how can the world be leveled so that things may be called pointing? All things falsely point to one another, hence all pointing is not pointing.

Pointing is what the world does not have; things are what the world has. To take what the world has as what the world does not have is impermissible. The world does not have a single day without things, nor a single thing that is not fitting—thus to forcibly take things as pointing is impermissible.

If the world has no pointing, things cannot be called pointing.
The reason the world has no affirmation and negation is that each thing fits its own fitting and cannot be called affirmation or negation—hence there is no affirmation or negation. What cannot be called pointing is not pointing. For example, water and fire differ in nature, each fitting its own use—since there is no affirmation or negation, how can they be called affirmation or negation?

That pointing is not pointing means nothing is not pointed to.
Even those things that are not pointing falsely point to one another. If the world has no pointing and things cannot be called pointing, this is not because there is non-pointing. That things cannot be called pointing means there is no affirmation or negation. Not only is there no affirmation or negation—there is also no absence of affirmation and negation. Hence it is said: there is no non-pointing.

That there is no non-pointing means nothing is not pointed to.
That nothing is not pointed to means pointing is not pointing. Since there is no absence of affirmation and negation, the ten thousand things all mutually affirm and negate—hence it is said: there is no non-pointing, and nothing is not pointed to.

Without affirmation or negation, and without absence of affirmation or negation, both are forgotten—thus all day there is affirmation and negation, yet no affirmation or negation. Hence it is said: nothing is not pointed to, yet pointing is not pointing.

That the world has no pointing arises from things each having names, not being pointing.
Things have their realities and each has its name. For instance, Wang Liang was skilled at driving, Li Shou at reckoning—each thing has its own use, like ears and eyes, neither of which can be dispensed with. Thus they need not be affirmation or negation.

To call what is not pointing "pointing" is to include what is not pointing.
If all things are not pointing, yet some are called pointing, this is because the things of this and that mutually affirm and negate, yet affirmation and negation are not fixed—hence they are not pointing.

To take the absence of pointing in what is not pointing as the absence of non-pointing is impermissible.
"Zhi" means fitting. "What is not pointing" refers to things; "absence of non-pointing" refers to pointing. To take things as fitting pointing is impermissible.

Moreover, pointing is what the world encompasses.
Some things have two names of affirmation and negation, or this and that mutually point to one another—all are called encompassing. If the world has no pointing, things cannot be said to have no pointing. That they cannot be said to have no pointing means there is no non-pointing.

The names of affirmation and negation arise from things mutually contrasting—hence it is said: things cannot be said to have no pointing. Precisely because the ten thousand things have no pointing, and also no absence of pointing, it is said: there is no non-pointing.

That there is no non-pointing means nothing is not pointed to.
To speak of no affirmation or negation arises from nothing not being pointed to. Thus the sage seeks man within affirmation and negation and thereby obtains the man without affirmation or negation.

Pointing is not non-pointing; pointing and things are not pointing.
To call it pointing is not to say there is no pointing. Since pointing cannot finely distinguish with things to become pointing, it is not pointing.

If the world had no things to point to, who would directly call it non-pointing?
If the world had no things, who would directly call it pointing? If the world had neither things nor pointing, it would be utterly still—who would call pointing non-pointing? Who would call pointing pointing?

If the world had pointing but no things to apply pointing to, who would call pointing non-pointing?
Who would directly call the absence of things non-pointing? If there were pointing but no things to which pointing could be applied, who would call pointing non-pointing?

Who would claim that the absence of things makes pointing non-pointing? Clearly, pointing was originally non-existent.

Moreover, pointing inherently is non-pointing—why must it depend on things to become pointing? Through reciprocal inference, pointing itself is non-pointing; how then could it become pointing in relation to things?

It is evident that the myriad things, each distinct in its myriad forms, exist as themselves, each with its own fitting place, without right or wrong. Thus, the sage remains profoundly silent, serene and indifferent, forgetting right and forgetting wrong, neither discarding any ability nor neglecting any thing.

**Discourse on Transformation and Change, Chapter Four**

Is there a one within two?
There is no one within two.
For example, white and horse are two things; they cannot be combined into one to form two.

Does two have a right?
Two has no right.
Does two have a left?
Two has no left.
Left and right cannot be combined into a single position. Two cannot be merged to form a right, nor can two be merged to form a left—this clarifies that two necessarily lacks the Way of becoming one.

Can the right be called two?
It cannot.
Can the left be called two?
It cannot.
The right cannot be divided to form two, nor can the left be divided to form two—this clarifies that one lacks the Way of becoming two.

Can left and right together be called two?
They can.
Left and right occupy different positions, so they can be called two.

Can change be called non-change?
It can.
One cannot be called two, nor can two be called one—this is certain.
Things possess the Way of transformation; thus, they cannot be called unchanging.

Can the right, when accompanied, be called change?
It can.
"Accompanied" means the right shifts to the left, so that one thing transforms into a different kind—like a kun fish becoming a peng bird, loyalty turning to treachery, existence and destruction lacking constancy, fortune and misfortune unsettled. All are instances of one thing transforming into another kind. Thus, the right is used to illustrate that a hundred changes do not alter the one.

Is change merely singular?
The kun and peng are two things, only becoming two through change—how then can one not become two?

The right.
When the kun transforms into the peng, one thing becomes another, just as the right shifts to the left—yet it remains the former right.

If the right truly changes, how can it still be called the right? If it does not change, how can it be called change?
When the right shifts to the left, how can it still be called the right?
Knowing that one thing is still one thing, how can it be called change?
This clarifies that two can become one, and one can become two.

If two has neither left nor right, then what are the left and right of two?
A sheep combined with an ox is not a horse. Suppose the sheep stands on the left and the ox on the right, together forming one thing—it cannot be called solely a sheep, nor solely an ox. Lacking a name, it cannot be called a horse when combined. Thus, two things cannot become one—this is clear.
An ox combined with a sheep is not a chicken.
When things transform into other things, like left and right exchanging positions, an ox on the left and a sheep on the right is neither ox nor sheep, nor is it a chicken.

What is the reason?
The sheep and ox are merely different: the sheep has teeth, the ox does not. Yet to say the sheep-ox is not a sheep or not an ox is not yet possible.
They do not both possess [teeth], yet they share some resemblance.
The ox’s lack of teeth is not a deficiency; the sheep’s possession of teeth, compared to the ox, is an excess.
To call the sheep’s excess "not a sheep" is not yet possible.
Yet the sheep’s possession of teeth is not an excess! Thus, the ox’s lack of teeth, compared to the sheep, is indeed a deficiency.
To call the ox’s deficiency "not an ox" is also not yet possible.
All these are observed in their natural state, each sufficient in its own measure and equally fitting.
Thus, the ox naturally resembles an ox and is an ox; the sheep naturally resembles a sheep and is a sheep.

The sheep has horns, the ox has horns.
Yet to say the ox is like a sheep, or the sheep is like an ox, is not yet possible.
They both possess [horns], yet their resemblance differs.
"Is like" is still "is."
To say the ox is a sheep or the sheep is an ox because both have horns is not yet possible.
That they both possess horns is natural, yet the kinds of sheep and ox differ—they cannot be equated.

Sheep and oxen have horns; horses do not.
Horses have tails; sheep and oxen do not.
Thus, it is said: a sheep combined with an ox is not a horse.
"Not a horse" means lacking a horse.
Lacking a horse means the sheep is not two, the ox is not two—yet sheep and ox together are two.
Thus, to say "sheep" and "ox" is not a horse is acceptable.
If one generalizes in this way, it is still a matter of differing kinds.
Like left and right, it is still a generalization.
The disparity between horse and ox-sheep is so great that it is not a horse—how could it only not be a horse? Moreover, within sheep and oxen, there is no horse.

A sheep is one and cannot be made two.
An ox is one and cannot be made two.
Thus, one sheep and one ox together make two—this is acceptable.
Sheep and oxen cannot be called a horse. If sheep and oxen were called a horse, then two could become three.
Thus, only by having no horse is this acceptable. The reason for using sheep and oxen as examples is to illustrate the impossibility of this kind, thereby establishing the distinction between left and right.
Once the distinction between left and right is established, the positions of above and below become clear.

Oxen and sheep have fur; chickens have feathers.
If a chicken’s foot is counted as one, its feet number two—two as one, thus three.
If an ox or sheep’s foot is counted as one, its feet number four—four as one, thus five.
Oxen and sheep have five feet; chickens have three feet. Thus, it is said: an ox combined with a sheep is not a chicken.
"Not" means there is reason it is not a chicken.
Earlier it was said "sheep combined with ox," now it is said "ox combined with sheep"—this variation in phrasing illustrates left and right, shifting positions to clarify ruler and minister, where exchanging roles gives rise to disorder.

People say: sheep have feet, oxen have feet, chickens have feet—yet if their feet are not counted, it seems each has only one foot.

Yet when their feet are counted in full, oxen and sheep each have four, while chickens have two—adding to the earlier "one foot," oxen and sheep each possess five feet. Thus, oxen and sheep differ from chickens. Hence it is said they are not chickens. It is not that oxen and sheep are chickens, but rather that within oxen and sheep there is no chicken; therefore, they are not chickens.

To offer a chicken in place of a horse—better the horse. Whether useful or not, their lack of resemblance is clear. To cite this is to confuse names, a reckless act. The horse serves as an analogy for order, the chicken for chaos; thus, when weighing horse against chicken, one would rather choose the horse. For the horse possesses the talent for state service, while the chicken does not—how clearly they are not of the same kind. Therefore, when a ruler elevates the untalented to share rank with the talented, confounding name and reality, this is called reckless promotion.

It is said: another argument. Blue with white is not yellow; white with blue is not azure.
It is asked: how so?
It is said: blue and white do not belong together, yet they are joined—this is opposition. They do not adjoin, yet they adjoin—this does not harm their directions.

Earlier, left and right were distinguished through sheep and oxen, together forming one body, yet sheep and oxen each obstruct one thing, not filling one another. Thus, another object is introduced for distinction.

Blue does not become blue through white, nor does white become white through blue; hence they do not belong together. Blue is the color of water, its direction in the east. White is the color of metal, its direction in the west. East and west are opposite yet face each other. The east reaches its extremity in the east, the west in the west—hence they do not adjoin. Yet east and west never fail to meet, and their meeting does not harm their directions; thus, adjoining does not harm their directions.

That their directions are not harmed means they are opposite yet face each other, each occupying its proper place, like left and right without blending. *Lí* is the mixing of colors. East and west are directly opposite yet face each other, each in its proper place, abiding like left and right without intermingling—thus their directions are not harmed.

Therefore, to unify them as blue is impossible, to unify them as white is impossible—how then could there be yellow? Yellow is correctness itself, a proper act; it is like the ruler and minister in the state, hence strength and longevity arise.

Blue and white each remain in their places without harming one another; thus, they cannot be merged into one and called blue, nor merged into one and called white. If even in the dispute between blue and white they cannot be unified as blue or white, how could yellow arise?

Yet though yellow is absent from blue and white, the world assuredly does not lack yellow. Yellow is a primary color; the world assuredly possesses yellow. Those who speak thus use white to represent the ruler, blue to represent the minister, and yellow to represent the state. When ruler and minister each uphold their proper roles, the state grows strong and the ruler enjoys long life.

Moreover, if blue blends with white, yet white does not prevail—this is wood overcoming metal. When wood overcomes metal, it becomes azure; azure is not a proper act. White is the Dao of the ruler; blue is the Dao of the minister. Blue blending with white means powerful ministers usurp command, mingling with the ruler’s Dao. When the ruler’s Dao is mingled, the ruler does not prevail.

Thus it is said: yet white does not prevail. The ruler’s control over the minister is like metal overcoming wood—this has long been so. Yet when white does not prevail and is blended by blue, this is wood overcoming metal, meaning the minister eclipses the ruler. When blue dyes white, its color becomes azure. When a minister eclipses the ruler, the Dao is in chaos. The reason the ruler’s Dao falls into chaos is that the ruler is not perfectly upright.

Blue and white do not belong together, yet they are joined; they do not overcome each other, so both become distinct. When they contend and become distinct, their color is azure. Blue and white are things that do not belong together, yet now they are mixed and do not overcome each other.

Not overcoming means blue dyes white, yet white is not entirely diminished—this is blue not overcoming white. The pure white substance, dyed by blue, is white not overcoming blue. To call it blue yet white is not extinguished, to call it white yet dyed by blue—this is white not overcoming blue. To call it blue yet white is not obliterated, to call it white yet dyed by blue—colors appear together, hence it is said both become distinct.

White contends and becomes distinct; when blue contends with white, the color is commonly called azure. Between azure and yellow, better yellow. Yellow is like the horse, is it not of the same kind? When weighing yellow against azure, one would rather choose yellow, for yellow is the color of central correctness. The horse is a talent for state service—central correctness and state talent are indeed of the same kind. Thus, one would rather choose yellow to resemble the horse. The horse is an analogy for central correctness.

Azure is like the chicken, is it not of the violent kind? Azure is an improper color; the chicken is a useless fowl. Thus, they are of the same kind—violent. When blue and white contend, their color azure, white still does not prevail over chaos. Violence means ruler and minister contend, both becoming distinct. When both become distinct, there is obscurity, not a proper act. The reason governance turns violent and chaotic is that ruler and minister contend for clarity. When ruler and minister contend for clarity, above and below fall into obscurity, decrees are unclear, and they cannot uphold what is proper. Not a proper act means name and reality do not correspond; blended colors appear—hence it is said both become distinct.

When both become distinct, the Dao is lost, and there is nothing by which to uphold correctness. Names are what designate reality; reality is what responds to names. Of the greatness of the Two Modes, the multitude of the myriad things, the honor of ruler and father, the lowliness of minister and child, the hundred offices and various bureaus, the hierarchy of high and low, the implements and resources—each has its fixed name. When the sage governs them, upholding correctness without error, then earth is leveled and heaven is completed, honor and lowliness fall into order, affairs flourish without effort, and teaching spreads without words.

If names deviate from reality, then reality does not respond to names. The superior grows negligent, the subordinate turns violent, and the hundred measures fall into chaos—hence it is said that blended colors appear. When blended colors appear, ruler and minister contend for clarity, internal unity dissolves, and external rebellion arises.

The decline of the correct Dao lies in the mismatch of names and reality. When names and reality do not correspond, there is no means to return to correctness—this is the loss of the Dao.

**Discourse on Hard and White, Fifth**

Is it permissible to speak of a hard-white stone as three?
No.
Is it permissible to speak of it as two?
Yes.
Why?
Without hardness, what is grasped is whiteness—its enumeration is two. Without whiteness, what is grasped is hardness—its enumeration is two.

Hardness, whiteness, and stone—three things form a single body, yet they are not called three. When a person looks at the stone, they see only its whiteness and not its hardness; thus, what is named in sight corresponds to two things: whiteness and the stone. Hence, it is said: without hardness, what is grasped is whiteness—its enumeration is two. When a hand touches the stone, it knows only its hardness and not its whiteness; thus, what is grasped corresponds to two things: the stone and hardness. Hence, it is said: without whiteness, what is grasped is hardness—its enumeration is two.

If one obtains what is white, it cannot be said there is no whiteness. If one obtains what is hard, it cannot be said there is no hardness. Yet when applied to this stone, how is it not three?
*(Note: "之石" means "this stone.")*
Since hardness and whiteness share a single body, they cannot be said to lack hardness or whiteness. If both hardness and whiteness are obtained, why not call it three?

When sight fails to obtain hardness but obtains whiteness, there is no hardness. When touch fails to obtain whiteness but obtains hardness, there is no whiteness. Hardness is not what the eye sees—hence it is said there is no hardness. Whiteness is not what the hand knows—hence it is said there is no whiteness.

If the world had no whiteness, one could not see the stone. If the world had no hardness, one could not speak of the stone. Hardness and whiteness in stone do not exclude one another—can they be said to conceal three?

Whiteness is a color. By lodging in one color, all other colors may be known. There is no object in the world possessing multiple colors that does not derive its color from color itself—hence it is said: if the world had no stone, one could not see the stone.

Hardness is a substance. By lodging in one substance, all qualities such as firmness and softness may be known. The substances of the myriad things differ, yet each is named according to what it receives. There is no object in the world without substance, and things must rely on substance to be solid—hence it is said: if the world had no hardness, one could not speak of the stone.

Stone is a form. By grasping the form of stone, the forms of all other things may be known. There is no object in the world without form, and things must rely on form to cohere.

Thus, color, form, and substance complete one another within a single body and do not separate. Hence, it is said: hardness and whiteness in stone do not exclude one another.

Yet what the eye sees and the hand touches each obtains only two, not all three. Though a person cannot obtain all three, it cannot be said there are no three—hence it is asked: can they be said to conceal three? The answer is no.

It is said: there is self-concealment, not concealment by something else. The eye can see things but not hardness—thus hardness is concealed. The hand can know things but not whiteness—thus whiteness is concealed. This is not due to any deliberate act but arises naturally—hence it is called self-concealment. Both conceal themselves, not because something else conceals them. The meaning is not substantive; touch obtains only two, yet the three are truly concealed.

It is said: its whiteness, its hardness, and the stone must mutually fill one another. How then can they be said to conceal themselves?
*(Note: "盈" means "full.")*
Its whiteness must fill the midst of hardness and whiteness. Its hardness must also fill the midst of whiteness and stone. And the stone must fill the midst of hardness and whiteness—hence it is said they must mutually fill one another. That two things fill one another is certain. How then can this be called self-concealment?

It is said: obtaining whiteness and obtaining hardness—what is seen and what is not seen are separate. If not seen, they do not fill one another—hence they are separate. Separation is concealment.

Things each have their names, and names each have their realities. Thus, obtaining a white stone means obtaining the reality of whiteness. Obtaining the name of hardness means obtaining the reality of hardness.

Yet when one looks at the stone, they see the reality of whiteness but not the reality of hardness. Not seeing the reality of hardness means hardness is separate from whiteness. Hence, it is said: what is seen and what is not seen are called separate. Thus, what is known and what is not known are also separate.

In the case of the stone, hardness and whiteness are two, making three names with realities that do not fill one another. When names do not fill one another, they are fundamentally separate. Being fundamentally separate and not seen, they are called concealed.

The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: Gongsun Long caused confusion, and Kong Chuan debated him at the home of the Lord of Pingyuan of Zhao, saying it concealed three—this refers to the arguments in this discourse.

It is said: the stone’s whiteness, the stone’s hardness—what is seen and what is not seen, two and three—are like length and breadth filling one another. Is this not an enumeration?

*(Note: "修" means "long.")*
Though whiteness has its own reality, it is the whiteness of the stone. Though hardness has its own reality, it is the hardness of the stone. Thus, hardness and whiteness—two things—together with the stone make three. What is seen and what is not seen share a single body; their hardness and whiteness, long and broad, all equally fill the stone. Is this not enumerating three names and uniting them in one reality?

It is said: when a thing is white, its whiteness is not fixed. When a thing is hard, its hardness is not fixed.

The indeterminate encompasses all—why single out the stone? All things universally possess whiteness, so whiteness is not fixed to the stone. If hardness and whiteness are not fixed to the stone alone, do they not also extend indeterminately to all things? Since all things cannot fix them, how could they be uniquely bound to the stone as one body?

It is said: following the stone, without it there is no stone. Without the stone, there is no ground to claim "white stone." That which does not separate is fundamentally so, without end.

The guest’s objection to the host states: by following the stone, one knows all things share the same body with hardness, hence "following the stone." That which is called hardness—without hardness, there is no stone. The name depends on hardness to be established. Without the stone, there is nothing to take as white; the name depends on the stone to reveal whiteness. These three things rely on one another to form a single body, thus it is said hardness and whiteness do not separate. If hardness, whiteness, and the stone do not separate, then all things and hardness are fundamentally inseparable, without end.

It is said: in the stone, one is the stone, two are hardness and whiteness, yet both reside in the stone. Thus, there is knowing and not knowing, seeing and not seeing. Therefore, knowing and not knowing separate, seeing and not seeing conceal. Since they conceal, who says they do not separate?

By hand touching the stone, one knows hardness but not whiteness—thus knowing and not knowing separate. By eye gazing at the stone, one sees whiteness but not hardness—thus seeing and not seeing conceal. Concealed by the eye, yet the eye does not perceive hardness—who says hardness is not concealed? Whiteness eludes the hand, unknown to the hand—who says whiteness does not separate?

It is said: the eye cannot perceive hardness, the hand cannot perceive whiteness. One cannot say there is no hardness, nor can one say there is no whiteness. Their functions differ, and nothing can replace them. Hardness and whiteness are bounded within the stone—how can they separate?

The eye can see, the hand can grasp; the eye and hand each have their distinct roles, hence "their functions differ." The eye cannot inherently see hardness—can the hand replace the eye to see hardness? The hand cannot inherently know whiteness—can the eye replace the hand to know whiteness? Thus, "nothing can replace them." Hardness and whiteness are enclosed together without separation—how can one claim they separate yet do not separate?

It is said: hardness has not yet become hardness with the stone, nor has it universally become hardness with things. Yet hardness must be hardness in what is not hard. Stone and things are hard, yet nothing in the world is like hardness—yet hardness conceals itself. Hardness is not only hard in the stone but also hard in all things. Thus, it is said hardness has not become hardness with the stone but extends to all things; it does not become hardness with all things yet must be hardness in itself. Nothing in the world is like this independent hardness that can be seen, yet one cannot say there is no hardness—hence "hardness conceals itself."

Whiteness inherently cannot make itself white—how then can it make stone and things white? If whiteness must be white, then it is white without needing to make things white. Yellow and black are the same. If the stone does not exist, how can one obtain "hard white stone"? Thus, they separate. Separation arises from this.

If the world had independent hardness, it would also have solitary whiteness. Thus, whiteness inherently cannot make itself white—how then can it make stone and things white? If whiteness must be able to make itself white, then it would not depend on things to be white. How could this apply only to hardness and whiteness? Yellow, black, and other colors are all the same. If stone and things must depend on color to be seen, and color cannot make itself its own color, then stone also cannot reveal itself as stone. Nothing in the world is visible without color—thus, "the stone does not exist." If the stone does not exist, where can hardness and whiteness reside? Hence, "how can one obtain 'hard white stone'?" Through repeated mutual revelation, hardness and whiteness separate from all things.

Is there something that causes them to separate? Nothing does not separate naturally by virtue of this. Thus, "it arises from this."

Force and knowledge are indeed inferior to following this. "Indeed" means "truly fails." If one does not follow the natural separation of hardness and whiteness but instead applies force and knowledge to separate them, one will truly fail. Thus, it is better to follow the natural separation.

Moreover, whiteness is seen by the eye with fire, yet fire does not see. If fire does not see, then fire and the eye do not see—yet the spirit sees. If the spirit does not see, then seeing separates. "Spirit" refers to the essence of the mind. People say the eye can see things, yet the eye sees by means of fire—thus the eye cannot see, and only through fire can it see. However, fire is not what sees whiteness, so neither the eye nor fire sees. Yet seeing occurs—then who sees? The spirit sees. The spirit’s seeing of things must rely on fire and the eye to see. If even fire and the eye cannot see, how can they assist the spirit in seeing? Thus, the spirit also cannot see. Tracing the seer, one ultimately cannot grasp its reality—then who is the one who sees? Hence, "seeing separates."

Hardness is known by the hand, and the hand by striking. The striking and the hand know yet do not know, while the spirit knows yet does not know. Spirit—this is what is called separation. Separation in the world is thus solitary and correct.

If the hand, striking, and spirit do not attain knowledge, then what they know becomes even more unknown. Knowing yet not knowing—what can the spirit do? The spirit is the master of life and the essence of the mind. Yet ears and eyes have distinct abilities, the hundred limbs different functions, and the thousand transformations—all are governed by the spirit.

Yet they merely rely on the capacities of ears and eyes, allowing the hundred limbs to function naturally—unable to make ears see or eyes hear, feet grasp or hands walk. Even with a single object, one cannot perceive its whiteness while knowing its hardness, nor know its hardness while perceiving its whiteness—how much less so for the vastness of the six directions and the multitude of the ten thousand things? Thus it is said: "Spirit! Spirit! It is without knowledge." The spirit knows yet does not know—this is what is called *separation*.

Extending this to examine all under heaven, what thing is not *separated*? Thus, each thing is *separated*, never intermingling. Each pursues its own transformations, never depending on another. Not depending on another, it does not borrow from that to complete this; not *separated*, it does not cling to this to disorder that. Therefore, the sage, in accord with things, becomes obscure; in accord with affairs, attains stillness. In accord with affairs and still, all under heaven rests in peace. In accord with things and obscure, all things fulfill their natures. When all things fulfill their natures, self and other become equally intimate, and all under heaven rests in peace. Then names and realities cease to exist.

**On Names and Realities, Sixth Chapter**

Heaven and earth, along with all they produce, are called *things*. The forms of heaven and earth, and all that they generate, are all termed *things*. When a thing acts as a thing within its proper bounds, this is called *reality*. Selecting materials to construct halls and temples, equipping courts with chariots, robes, vessels, and implements; seeking worthies to fill positions; attending to inner and outer officials, state offices—all without excess or deficiency, each fitting its proper place—this is called *reality*.

When reality fulfills its proper place without neglect, this is called *position*. Reality is fulfillment: the size of vessels and implements, the ranks of the many and the few, the high and the low—when vessels receive their proper materials, people are capable in their offices, government affairs are without lack, and the noble and base are in order—this is called *position*. To exceed one’s position is not *position*. Appointing officials beyond their rank, vessels and implements exceeding their regulations, some usurping the above, others overflowing below—all are not their proper *position*.

When position is in its proper place, this is called *correctness*. Selecting materials for vessels and implements, assigning tasks and rewards or punishments—there are distinctions of noble and base, and differing measures for the spiritual and the common. When these align with their true nature without usurpation or excess, this is called *correctness*.

Using what is *correct* to correct what is not *correct*—if one doubts what is *correct*, using *correctness* to rectify the *incorrect* will make all that is *incorrect* become *correct*; but if the *incorrect* disrupts the *correct*, all will be thrown into doubt.

What is *correct* corrects its *reality*; correcting its *reality* is correcting its *name*. Confucius said: "It is essential to rectify names." Thus, when its *reality* is *correct*, all *correctness* is *correct*. When its *name* is *correct*, then there is only response in its *this* and *that*. "Only" is a term of response. To correct a *name* is to apply the name appropriately to the reality of *this* and *that*; thus, seeking reality through the name, *this* and *that* will both respond to their names.

To call *that* and *that* does not respond to *that*—then the calling of *that* does not proceed. *Calling* is issuing commands. To issue orders and summon *that*, yet *that* does not respond—this means the division is not fitting for *that*, so the command cannot proceed. To call *this* and the action does not respond to *this*—then the calling of *this* does not proceed. The command is not fitting for *this*, so the command for *this* cannot proceed.

Whether it is fitting or not—when it is not fitting, it causes disorder. To issue commands that are not fitting yet believe them to be fitting is even more unfitting. Thus, it is said: "whether it is fitting or not." Because the command is not fitting, the multitude of things do not respond, and the command is rendered ineffective. Because it is not fitting.

Resenting that things do not respond to commands and using power and position to coerce them—then all under heaven will take what is not fitting as fitting, thereby causing further disorder.

Thus, *that*—when *that* is fitting for *that*, it responds to *that*, and the calling of *that* proceeds. *This*—when *this* is fitting for *this*, it responds to *this*, and the calling of *this* proceeds. When it is fitting and thus fitting, this is *correctness*. Issuing commands to *this* and *that* that fit the names and realities of *this* and *that*—thus all respond and commands proceed. As for being fitting, all under heaven is naturally *correct*.

Thus, *that*—therefore *that* is limited to *that*; *this*—*this* is limited to *this*—this is *permissible*. The name of *that* is limited to the reality of *that*, and the name of *this* is limited to the reality of *this*; when the names and realities of *this* and *that* do not overflow, this is called *permissible*. When *that* and *this* are both *that* and *this*, or *this* and *that* are both *this* and *that*—this is *impermissible*. If the name of *that* overflows into the reality of *this*, calling *that* as if it were similar to *this*; or if the name of *this* overflows into the reality of *that*, calling *this* as if it were the same as *that*—both are *impermissible*.

Now, *names* and *realities* are called. Knowing that *this* is not *this*, knowing that *this* is not in *this*—this is clarity in not calling. Knowing that *that* is not *that*, knowing that *that* is not in *that*—this is not calling.

Names are for designating realities; thus, in all government affairs, rewards, punishments, and names—when they correspond to reality, this is good. For example, knowing that a great achievement is not this person’s achievement, or that a small achievement is not worthy of reward for this person—then neither is rewarded. Knowing that a great crime is not that person’s crime, or that a small crime is not worthy of punishment for that person—then neither is punished.

How perfect were the enlightened kings of antiquity! They examined names and realities and were cautious in their designations. How perfect were the enlightened kings of antiquity!

When Gongsun Long composed his discourses, he used things to debate, thereby elucidating the greatest principles of the kingly Way. Of what is called great in the kingly Way, nothing is greater than rectifying names and realities. Confucius said: "Only names and vessels must not be lent to others." Thus, names, titles, vessels, and realities are what the sage most carefully attends to.

Names are for naming affairs and things to implement teaching. Realities are for realizing affairs and things to complete teaching.

Names that fail to correspond are not things. Yet without names, things cannot communicate themselves. Things are not names, yet without things, names cannot clarify themselves. Thus, names are established based on realities, and realities are made known through names. When names align with realities, the teaching of names flourishes greatly, the achievements of realities are fully realized, and the kingly Way thereby matches Heaven in its greatness. For this reason, the enlightened kings of antiquity carefully examined names and realities and were cautious in their implementation. *The Lower Scroll of the Gongsun Longzi concludes.*
