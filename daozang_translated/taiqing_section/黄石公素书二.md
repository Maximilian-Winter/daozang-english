**Preface:**
The Yellow Stone Master’s *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) consists of **six chapters**. According to the *Records of the Former Han* (Xiàn Hàn), this text was the one the Yellow Stone Master imparted to Jiāng Zǐfáng at the Yǐqiáo Bridge. Many assume it to be *The Three Strategies* (Sānlüè), but this is the error of the transmitters.

During the chaos of the Jin dynasty, bandits raided Jiāng Zǐfáng’s tomb, and within a jade pillow, they found this book—**1,336 words in total**—with a secret injunction forbidding its transmission to those who are **not aligned with the Dao**, **not attuned to the sacred**, **not reverent of the Holy**, or **not virtuous**. If one does not belong to such a person, they will suffer misfortune; if one obtains it but does not pass it on, they will also suffer misfortune.

**Ah! How grave and weighty this is.**

The Yellow Stone Master obtained *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) and transmitted it to Jiāng Zǐfáng, yet Jiāng Zǐfáng did not fully grasp its teachings and thus buried it. Five hundred years later, bandits unearthed it, and from then on, *Essentials of the Dao* began to circulate among mortals. Yet what was transmitted was merely the Yellow Stone Master’s words, and can his intent truly be exhausted by speech?

I have often reflected: the Dao/Way of Heaven and humanity has never ceased to mutually benefit one another, and the ancient sages all devoted their hearts to it. Yáo revered the Heavenly Vault (Hào Tiān), Shùn harmonized the Seven Celestial Administrations (Qī Zhèng), Yǔ honored the Nine Regions (Jiǔ Chóu), and the sage Fùyuē expounded the Heavenly Dao. Wén Wáng emphasized the Eight Trigrams (Bā Guà), Zhōu Gōng established the Heavenly and Earthly Four Seasons’ Offices (Sìshí Guān), and further appointed the Three Ministers (Sān Gōng) to reconcile the balance of yin and yang. Kǒngzǐ sought to transcend words, while Lǎozǐ grounded it in the eternal and boundless (Cháng Wúyǒu).

The *Yīn Fú Jīng* (Scripture of the Yin Symbol) states:
*"The cosmos lies within the palm, all transformations arise from the body. When the Dao reaches this level, even ghosts and spirits cannot evade my mastery—how much more so the matters of punitive governance and measures!"*

The Yellow Stone Master was a reclusive sage of the Qín. His words are concise, his meaning profound—even the sages Yáo, Shùn, Yǔ, Wén Wáng, Fùyuē, Zhōu Gōng, Kǒngzǐ, and Lǎozǐ could not surpass this. Thus, the Yellow Stone Master, knowing that the Qín would fall and the Hàn would rise, entrusted this book to Jiāng Zǐfáng. Yet could Jiāng Zǐfáng truly comprehend its entirety? His mastery was but partial, applying only a few of its precepts.

The book says: *"Cunning schemes leaked to the outside lead to ruin."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor (Gāo Dì) to honor Hàn Xìn.
The book says: *"Small grudges are unforgivable; great grudges must be resolved."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to grant titles to Yōng Yì.
The book says: *"Decisions made by the unvirtuous are perilous."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, advising the High Emperor to abandon the封封 (fēngfēng) of the Six Kingdoms.
The book says: *"Deploying stratagems and exercising authority resolves deadlocks."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, summoning the Four Worthies (Sì Hào) to establish the Emperor Huì.
The book says: *"No greater fortune exists than contentment."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, choosing to remain and封封 (fēngfēng) himself.
The book says: *"Severing desires and restraining appetites removes burdens."* Jiāng Zǐfáng employed this, abandoning worldly affairs and following Chìsōngzǐ.

Alas! Though he discarded its dross and sediment, Jiāng Zǐfáng’s partial use was still enough to destroy the Qín and the Yǐng, while establishing the Emperor of Pèi. How much greater the effects would have been if he had applied it fully and delved into its depths!

Since the Hàn dynasty, the study of章章 (zhāngzhāng) exegesis and文词 (wéncí) rhetoric has flourished, yet those who truly grasp the Dao have grown exceedingly rare. Figures like Zhēng Zhūliè, Wáng Měng, Fáng Qiáo, and Kuī Dù, though hailed as eminent ministers of their time, never truly understood the grand Dao of the ancient kings. This is why *Essentials of the Dao* was forbidden to transmission to those **not aligned with the Dao**, **not attuned to the sacred**, **not reverent of the Holy**, or **not virtuous**.

The Dao is the interplay of presence and absence (Lí Yǒu Lí Wú); the sacred is the transcendence of fixed definitions (Fēi Yǒu Fēi Wú); reverence for the Holy is the mastery of presence within absence (Yǒu Ér Wú); and virtue is the cultivation of absence within presence (Wú Ér Yǒu). Without these four qualities, even if one recites this book by rote, they cannot truly embody its teachings.

**Yellow Stone Master’s *Essentials of the Dao* (Sūshū) – Annotated by Zhāng Shāngyīng of the Sòng dynasty.**

**Chapter One: On the Origin of the Dao**

The Dao cannot be said to have a beginning.
Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety—these five are one in essence.
Separated in application, they become five; unified in essence, they return to one.
One unifies the five; the five manifest the one.
The Dao is what people tread upon, yet it is such that all things are unaware of its path.
The Dao’s influence pervades all things—vast and great.
A single breath, a single word, a single movement or stillness, a single act of eating or drinking—whether in the grandness beyond the eight strings of the *qín* or the minutiae within the dust of the *mángyè* plant—where is there that is not the Dao?

Benevolence is insufficient to name it, so the benevolent see it and call it benevolence.
Wisdom is insufficient to exhaust it, so the wise see it and call it wisdom.
The common folk are insufficient to perceive it, so it is said: *"It is used, yet they know not."*

Virtue is what people attain, allowing all things to fulfill their desires.
Desire is what is sought.
If one seeks and does not attain, it is not the utmost of virtue.
To seek from the compass and square, one attains only the square and the circle.
To seek from the scales, one attains only lightness and heaviness.
But to seek from virtue—there is no desire that is not fulfilled:
Sovereign and minister, father and son attain it and thus become sovereign and minister, father and son;
Insects and grasses attain it and thus become insects and grasses.
The great become great through it, the small become small through it.
Nearly, it encompasses the self; distantly, it encompasses all things.
There is no desire that is not fulfilled.

Benevolence is what people hold dear—possessing compassion, kindness, and pity to nurture life’s fulfillment.
Benevolence’s essence is like Heaven: Heaven covers all without exception;
Like the sea: the sea contains all without exception;
Like rain and dew: rain and dew nourish all without exception.
Compassion, kindness, and pity—these are how benevolence is applied.
If one is not personally dear to all under Heaven, yet all under Heaven naturally hold them dear.
There is not a single person who does not receive their due,
Nor a single thing that does not attain its life.
The *Classic of Documents* says: *"Even the birds and beasts, fish and turtles, are all as they should be."*
The *Book of Odes* says: *"Thick the reeds grow along the path—let cattle and sheep not trample them."*
This is the utmost of benevolence.

Righteousness is what is fitting for people—rewarding the good and punishing the evil to establish deeds and affairs.
Where principle resides is called righteousness.
Following principle and making judgments in order—this is how righteousness is enacted.
Rewarding the good and punishing the evil are the principles of righteousness.
Establishing deeds and affairs are the judgments of righteousness.

Propriety is what people tread upon—arising early and retiring late to fulfill the order of human relationships.
Propriety is the act of treading.
Whatever is trodden upon morning and evening without losing its order is propriety.
In speech, movement, sight, and hearing—even in sudden actions—where do licentiousness, eccentricity, or excess arise from?
Desire is the foundation of being human; none of these five can be omitted.
*Laozi* says:
*"When the Dao is lost, then virtue;
When virtue is lost, then benevolence;
When benevolence is lost, then righteousness;
When righteousness is lost, then propriety."*
*"Lost"* means dispersed.
The Dao disperses into virtue,
Virtue disperses into benevolence,
Benevolence disperses into righteousness,
Righteousness disperses into propriety.
Though the five never cease to serve one another,
Their essence remains undispersed—only the Dao’s subtlety preserves this.
*Laozi* speaks of their essence, hence:
*"Propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust, yet the beginning of chaos."*
The Yellow Stone Master speaks of their application, hence:
*"None can be omitted."*

The worthy and virtuous understand the ways of flourishing and decline,
Are versed in the patterns of success and failure,
Discern the dynamics of order and chaos,
And grasp the principles of retreat and advancement.
Flourishing and decline have their Dao,
Success and failure have their fate,
Order and chaos have their momentum,
Retreat and advancement have their logic.
Thus, they retreat in seclusion, embracing the Dao,
Awaiting their moment.
The Dao is like a boat;
Time is like water.
With the advantage of a boat and oars but no river or sea to navigate,
Its utility remains unseen.
But when the time arrives and they act,
They can attain the highest ranks of the realm;
When the opportunity arises and they move,
They can achieve unparalleled deeds.
If they do not meet their moment, they perish in obscurity.
If their cultivation is profound and they act at the right time,
Their opportunity is swift—how could it be subject to deliberation?
Thus, their Dao is lofty, and their reputation endures through the ages.
A lofty Dao ensures that their name grows heavier in later generations.

**Chapter Two: On the Rectitude of the Dao**

The Dao cannot be said to be unrectified.
Virtue is sufficient to win the distant—
*"Win"* means the heart is pleased and sincerely submits.
Trust is sufficient to unify the disparate,
Righteousness is sufficient to gain the masses—
If one’s conduct and actions are fitting, the people will approve, and thus they will be gained.
Talent is sufficient to discern antiquity,
Clarity is sufficient to illuminate those below—
This is the excellence of a person.
Conduct is sufficient to serve as a model,
Wisdom is sufficient to resolve doubts—
At moments of suspicion, only wisdom can judge.
Trust can make one uphold agreements,
Integrity can make one distribute wealth fairly—
This is the prowess of a person.
To fulfill one’s duties without neglect—
As when Confucius served as a minor official overseeing fields.
To adhere to righteousness without yielding—
When faced with profit and harm, resolutely upholding righteousness—this is not yielding.
To encounter suspicion without evading it improperly—
The Duke of Zhou did not avoid suspicion in his regency;
The Duke of Shao had suspicions;
Confucius did not avoid seeing Lady Xi;
Zilu had suspicions.
To endure suspicion without evading it improperly—this is only for the most enlightened.
To encounter profit without seizing it improperly—
This is the excellence of a person.

The excellent are stern to others.
The prowessful are elevated above others.
The outstanding surpass others.
Those with virtue, trust, righteousness, talent, and clarity—these are the deeds of the excellent.
Those with conduct, wisdom, trust, and integrity—these are the deeds of the prowessful.
As for the outstanding, their talent and conduct suffice to name them.
Yet the outstanding surpass the prowessful,
And the prowessful surpass the excellent.

**Chapter Three: On Seeking a Person’s Aspirations**

Aspirations cannot be sought recklessly.
Cutting off desires and restraining appetites—
This is how burdens are removed.

Human nature is originally pure and tranquil, unencumbered by bonds.
Yet cravings and desires drag one away, ensnaring the self in external things.
To suppress and eliminate what is harmful—
This is how one atones for faults.
To atone means to sever and remove them entirely.
Only when suppression reaches its utmost and harm is utterly eliminated
Can faults be fully atoned.

To abstain from wine and avoid licentiousness—
This is how one remains unstained.
Licentiousness depletes vital essence, and when essence is exhausted, the spirit suffers.
Wine impairs the spirit, and when the spirit is injured, the essence is harmed.
To avoid suspicion and distance doubt—
This is how one avoids error.
If one’s path is without suspicion and one’s heart without doubt,
Then affairs will not go awry.

To study extensively and question diligently—
This is how one broadens knowledge.
To possess the innate nature of sages and worthies yet fail to cultivate it through learning—
This is merely laziness.

To uphold lofty conduct and subtle speech—
This is how one refines oneself.
Conduct must be lofty yet unyielding; speech must be subtle yet not ostentatious.

To be reverent, frugal, modest, and restrained—
This is how one preserves oneself.
To deliberate deeply and plan far ahead—
This is how one avoids ruin.
Guan Zhong’s strategies could unite the feudal lords,
Yet he faltered in the Way of the Sage-King.
Shang Yang’s strategies could strengthen a state,
Yet he faltered in benevolence and righteousness.
Huan Kuan’s strategies could amass wealth,
Yet he faltered in nourishing the people.
All who meet ruin lack true calculation.
To associate with the virtuous and befriend the upright—
This is how one supports the faltering.
Those who rejoice in praise cannot be true friends.
To practice forgiveness and cultivate sincerity—
This is how one interacts with others.
To embody the utmost clarity and yet adhere to the Middle Way—
This is how sages and worthies interact with others.
The utmost clarity belongs only to sages and worthies;
The Middle Way is what all people share.

To appoint the capable and employ the skilled—
This is how one accomplishes tasks.
Adaptability is talent; utility is skill.
Those with talent may be entrusted but not commanded;
Those with skill may be commanded but not entrusted.
This is the natural progression in using people.

To censure vice and repel slander—
This is how one stops chaos.
Slanderous speech and wicked deeds are the roots of disorder.

To examine antiquity and verify the present—
This is how one avoids confusion.
By following the progress of the ancients and inferring their intentions,
One may test the affairs of the present—how could there be confusion?

To establish standards first and measure afterward—
This is how one responds to emergencies.
With a single measure in hand, all lengths in the world are contained within it.
When urgent matters arise and must be addressed without end,
It is because standards and measurements are fixed.

To adapt to changes and employ expedients—
This is how one resolves deadlocks.
There are fixed principles and flexible adaptations,
Fixed norms and expedient measures.
When fixed principles cannot be applied,
One adjusts and returns to them.
When fixed norms cannot be utilized,
One employs expedients and returns to them.

To restrain speech and conform to circumstances—
This is how one avoids blame.
The virtuous speak or remain silent according to the time,
Act or withdraw according to the Way.
They restrain their words so their excellence is unseen,
They conform to circumstances so their intentions remain hidden—
Thus they avoid blame.

To be steadfast and unyielding—
This is how one achieves great deeds.
To be diligent and virtuous—
This is how one preserves one’s end.

The steadfast cannot be shaken;
The unyielding cannot be deflected.
The diligent are ever striving;
The virtuous are ever refining.
To achieve great deeds, nothing surpasses steadfastness;
To preserve one’s end, nothing surpasses avoiding fault.

**Chapter Four: On the Foundation of Virtue and the Dao**

The foundation cannot be separated from virtue and the Dao.
The art of firm resolve and sincere action
Cannot be surpassed in breadth by extensive deliberation.
Deliberation must be extensive.
Nothing is more secure than enduring insult.
The supreme Dao is vast and unobstructed—
What insult could there be?
Nothing precedes virtue in cultivation.
Externally, it perfects things;
Internally, it perfects the self—
This is the cultivation of virtue.

Nothing brings greater joy than loving what is good.
Nothing is more divine than utmost sincerity.
To be without limits is to be divine.
Human divinity aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Yet one cannot match their divinity—
For one lacks utmost sincerity.

Nothing is clearer than comprehending things.
The *Records* say:
*"Clarity and purity within oneself,
One’s vital breath and spirit as divine."*
Thus, when all things come,
How could they evade your perception?

Nothing is more auspicious than contentment.
The auspiciousness of contentment is doubly auspicious.
Nothing is more bitter than excessive desires.
The Dao of the sage is serene and desireless.
Toward things, it responds when they come and does not cling when they depart—
Never harboring desires.
Among the ancients with excessive desires,
None surpassed Qin Shi Huang and Han Wu.
They desired wealth for their states,
Strength for their armies,
Grandeur for their achievements,
Nobility for their names,
Splendor for their palaces,
Beauty for their consorts,
Submission for the barbarians,
And immortality through alchemy.
Yet their states grew poorer,
Their armies weaker,
Their achievements humbler,
Their names duller,
Until finally they failed to obtain what they sought,
Leaving behind only regret and humiliation—
This is the suffering of excessive desires.
Those who govern states should certainly avoid excessive desires,
But for the virtuous in cultivating the self,
How could their restraint be insufficient?

Nothing is more sorrowful than scattered essence.
What the Dao generates is called *One*.
Purity is called *essence*.
What essence emits is called *spirit*.
In its hidden state, it is without birth, without death,
Without before, without after,
Without yin, without yang,
Without motion, without stillness.
In its manifestation through form, it becomes
Clarity, wisdom, intelligence, and cognition.
All ranks of blood and qi receive it.
When used correctly, it gathers and does not scatter;
When used perversely, it scatters and does not gather.
If the eyes indulge in color, essence scatters through color;
If the ears indulge in sound, essence scatters through sound;
If the mouth indulges in flavor, essence scatters through flavor;
If the nose indulges in scent, essence scatters through scent.
If scattering continues unchecked,
How could it endure long?

Nothing is more ailment than instability.
Heaven and Earth endure because they have constancy.
If humans lack constancy, is this not sickness?

Nothing is shorter than improper gain.
What is obtained unjustly will surely be lost unjustly.

Nothing can be long-lasting if obtained improperly.
Nothing is more obscure than avarice and baseness—
To sacrifice one’s body for material things is the height of folly.

Nothing is more solitary than self-reliance—
Jie and Zhou of old trusted in their own talents,
Zhi Bo in his strength,
Xiang Yu in his courage,
Wang Mang in his cunning,
Yuan Zai and Lü Qi in their guile.
Self-reliance breeds arrogance in one’s **qi**, causing virtue to fail to enter the ears;
If virtue fails to enter, solitude and helplessness follow.
When their downfall comes, the world competes to destroy them.

Nothing is more perilous than entrusting with doubt—
Han doubted Han Xin yet employed him, and Xin nearly rebelled.
Tang doubted Li Huai Guang yet employed him, and Huai Guang ultimately turned traitor.

Nothing is more ruinous than excessive self-interest.
Rewards not given for merit, punishments not meted out for crimes,
Favoring flatterers while hating the honest,
Nurturing kin while distancing the worthy—
The small leads to the resentment of individuals,
The great arouses the wrath of the world.
This is the path of self-interest’s destruction.

**Chapter Five: Upholding Righteousness**

To follow and act upon righteousness is **Dao**.
To reveal wisdom outwardly brings darkness—
The **Dao** of the sages is inner clarity and outer obscurity.
Only those lacking in wisdom reveal it outwardly,
And thus their **Dao** becomes obscured.
Ignorance of one’s faults is a great veil—
The sage has no faults to acknowledge,
The worthy’s faults are manifest and thus understood.
Ignorance of one’s faults, how profound is that blindness!

Those who stray and do not return are ensnared—
Drunkards know not the harm they do to their nature,
Lustful men know not the harm they do to their **qi**,
The greedy know not the harm they do to their resolve.
Humans are born without delusion;
It is the ensnared who bring it upon themselves.

To invite calamity through speech is disaster—
Speak and act in harmony, and the **Dao** lies within while disaster rests with others;
Speak without acting, and the **Dao** lies with others while disaster rests within.

Orders contrary to the heart are futile—
The heart issues commands, commands execute the heart.
If later contradicts earlier, destruction follows—
Inconstant decrees, a heart without trust, lead to abandoned affairs.

Anger without authority invites transgression—
King Wen did not raise his voice or change his expression,
Yet the four quarters feared him.
Thus Confucius said:
*"The people fear not his anger, but the **Dao** of his ax and spear."*

To delight in humiliating others brings ruin—
One may seek a reputation for honesty,
Yet place others in positions of fault,
And thus invite the path of calamity.

To dishonor those one employs brings peril—
When a man is spoken of as lost,
Danger follows close behind.

To disrespect those one should revere is ominous—
By age, it is the teeth;
In court, it is rank;
Among the worthy and unworthy, it is **virtue**.
All three may be revered—
Outward respect is for teeth and rank,
Inner respect is for **virtue**.

Those who outwardly conform yet inwardly diverge are solitary,
Those who favor slander while distancing loyalty are doomed—
Slanderers skillfully divine the ruler’s intent and strike true;
Loyalists confront the ruler’s faults and remonstrate.
Those who align with intent are often pleased,
Those who oppose it are often enraged—
Thus, Zi Xu was slain and Wu fell,
And Qu Yuan was exiled, leading to Chu’s ruin.

To draw near to vice while distancing the worthy is stupor—
A woman’s audience in the public square brings chaos,
As seen in the calamities of Princess Taiping and Wei Shifu.

To appoint private individuals to office brings superficiality—
Shallow superficiality cannot bear the weight of high office,
As with the likes of Niu Jianke becoming Chancellor.

To overbear those below and seek victory is encroachment—
When name fails to match reality, exhaustion follows.
Lu Zan said:
*"Name approaches the void, and thus is weighty in governance;
Profit approaches reality, and thus is light in **virtue**.
Yet reality is the means to achieve name,
Name is the means to govern reality—
When name and reality support each other, neither depletion nor scarcity will come."*

To neglect oneself while blaming others brings no resolution,
To enrich oneself while impoverishing others brings abandonment—
The sage always excels in saving others without abandoning them,
In nurturing things without discarding them.
Self-enrichment is self-satisfaction,
Not the Confucian ideal of *"cultivating one’s own virtue and benevolence."*
To enrich oneself while impoverishing others,
And thus the talents of the people will be cast aside.

To reject merit for fault brings loss—
When the multitude outwardly differs, ruin follows—
Misplaced appointments, obstructed emotions,
Flattery and private favor both advancing,
Each with divergent hearts—
Seeking survival without ruin is impossible.
Once employed but not trusted, one is estranged—
To employ the worthy yet distrust them,
Is to lose their loyalty.
This is the *"harm to the hegemon"* of Guan Zhong.

To grant rewards with stingy demeanor brings discouragement—
Stinginess in rewards discourages the meritorious,
As with Xiang Yu’s *"sparing the seal."*
To promise much yet give little breeds resentment—
The expectation is lost.
To welcome and then reject is discord—
Liu Zhan welcomed Liu Bei yet turned him away.
To bestow lightly while expecting much brings no return—
Heaven and Earth are not kind,
Yet treat all things as fodder for the slaughter;
The sage is not kind,
Yet treats the people as fodder for the slaughter.
They cover and bear them,
Nourish and give life to them—
Why demand they repay?
To prize nobility while forgetting humility brings no endurance—
When the **Dao** suffices within oneself,
Nobility and humility cannot bring honor or shame.
Nobility is fixed, humility is fixed—
Only the petty man, suddenly elevated to high station,
Forgets his lowly origins,
And thus his endurance is brief.

To dwell on past wrongs while discarding new merits is ominous—
To gnash one’s teeth over a grudge from a minor offense,
Or to cherish a single meal’s kindness—
This is the measure of a common man.
Those with resolve for the world,
Though they harbor enmity from the past,
Will employ them if their talents are great;
Though they bear resentment from old scores,
Will employ them if their merits are great.
Han Gaozu ennobled Hou Yingyi,
For his merits.
Tang Taizong appointed Wei Zheng as Chancellor,
For his talents.
To employ men without proper alignment brings near-calamity—
Forced employment does not retain loyalty,
As with Cao Cao’s forced employment of Guan Yu,
Who ultimately turned to Liu Bei—
This is the *"not retaining"* of it.
To choose officials for others brings chaos—
To lose what one is strong in brings weakness,
For there are those strong in **virtue**,
Those strong in favor,
Those strong in power,
And those strong in arms.

Emperor Yao and Shun ruled with **virtue** and grew strong,
While Jie and Zhou lacked **virtue** and grew weak.
Tang and Wu flourished by gaining the people’s support and grew strong,
While King You and King Li lost the people’s support and grew weak.
The Zhou Dynasty thrived by harnessing the power of the feudal lords and grew strong,
But lost that power and grew weak.
The Tang Dynasty prospered with its *fubing* (府兵) system and grew strong,
Yet lost it and grew weak.
In matters of governance, what is good strengthens,
And what is evil weakens.
In personal conduct, innate nature strengthens,
While emotions weaken.

Decisions made by the unvirtuous are perilous—
The unvirtuous delight in others’ misfortune and rejoice in calamity.
Secrets leaked in treachery lead to defeat,
And excessive taxation with meager distribution brings decline.
*Decline* means *eroded*—
As Master Wen Zhong said:
*"In lands where taxation is heavy,*
*The treasury is likewise eroded."*

When soldiers are impoverished and courtiers grow rich, the state decays—
Courtiers fan the flames of intrigue, hoping for chaos in the land.
Soldiers risk their lives, defending the borders against peril.
If wealth flows to one while another starves, military strength wanes.

When bribery is openly practiced, justice is obscured—
Private usurps public, crooked distorts straight.
To dismiss good counsel while remembering faults breeds tyranny—
Tyranny breeds resentment.
To entrust the unworthy and trust the unworthy brings corruption—
*Corruption* means *drought*—
Those who govern with **virtue** gather the people,
While those who rule with harsh laws scatter them.
*Law* originates from moral intent, with compassion at its core.
Thus, the sage kings supplemented **virtue** with law,
Not relying solely on punishment.

Therefore it is said:
*"Govern with **virtue** and the people unite,
Rule with harsh laws and they scatter."*

If minor merits go unrewarded, great achievements will not stand.
If small grievances are not pardoned, great resentment will arise.
Rewards that do not win hearts, punishments that do not meet justice, breed rebellion—
When the people’s hearts are not won, rebellion follows.
Rewarding the unworthy, punishing the innocent, is cruelty—
Cruelty is what should not be imposed.

To heed slander and praise it, to hear counsel and resent it, leads to ruin.
He who holds what is his own is secure,
While the greedy who covet others’ possessions bring ruin.
To possess what is rightfully yours brings ease and stability—
This is the *Anli* chapter’s sixth principle.
Resentment stems from unforgiven minor offenses,
Calamity arises from unprepared planning.
Fortune comes from accumulated goodness,
Disaster from accumulated evil.
Goodness accumulated brings fortune,
Evil accumulated brings disaster.
Without goodness or evil, there is neither fortune nor disaster.

Hunger arises from neglecting agriculture,
Cold from idleness in weaving.
Security comes from having the right people,
Peril from losing the worthy.

Wealth comes from welcoming prosperity—
The frugality of Emperor Yao, Li Kui’s land reforms,
King Goujian’s decade of preparation, and Han’s *pingzhen* system
All were means to invite abundance.
Poverty comes from squandering opportunity.

When the ruler lacks constancy in policy,
The people grow suspicious.
Unstable temperaments—
Unchecked anger and joy—
Fuel mutual distrust, leaving none at ease.
Disrespecting superiors invites punishment,
Insulting inferiors invites estrangement.
Disrespecting superiors is without ritual,
Insulting inferiors is without benevolence.
Nearly placed officials are scorned,
Distant officials are likewise belittled.
As Huainan King said:
*"Dismissing Pingjin Hou is like plucking a hair."*

Self-doubt breeds mistrust—
This is *obscurity*.
Self-confidence without mistrust—
This is *clarity*.
The misguided lack true friends—
Li Fengji’s associates were the likes of Bajuan and Shiliuzi.
A crooked superior breeds a crooked subordinate—
Yuan Di’s ministers were Honggong and Shixian.
A declining state lacks the worthy,
A chaotic polity lacks the virtuous.
It is not that the worthy and virtuous do not exist—
They cannot be employed.

Those who love deeply seek the worthy with urgency,
And those who delight in the worthy nourish the people well.
People cannot love themselves—
They rely on the worthy to love them.
People cannot nourish themselves—
They rely on the worthy to nourish them.
When a state is poised to dominate,
The worthy all flock to it—
Zhao killed Wuyu, so the Master turned back at the river.
When a state is doomed to fall,
The worthy flee first—
As Miczi left Shang, and Confucius left Lu.

Barren lands do not yield great crops,
Shallow waters do not hold great fish.
Bare trees do not shelter great birds,
Sparse forests do not harbor great beasts.
These four things illustrate:
When people are shallow, there is no **virtue**,
When a state is shallow, there are no loyal and worthy.

Tall mountains crumble from below,
Full marshes overflow.
These two things warn against excess—
Excessive height and excessive fullness.

To discard jade for stone is blindness—
The sighted and the blind are the same.
A tiger’s skin over a lamb’s nature brings shame—
Fine appearance without substance is as good as none.
Clothing without a collar sags downward,
Running without watching the ground leads to a fall.
Weak pillars cause the house to collapse,
Weak ministers cause the state to topple.
*Weakness* means insufficient strength for the task.

Cold feet harm the heart—
People’s grievances harm the state.
The harmonious *qi* of the feet rises to govern the limbs,
While the heart reigns as sovereign.
When *qi* is harmonious, the sovereign’s heart is at ease,
When *qi* is discordant, the sovereign’s heart is injured.

Before mountains crumble, the base weakens first,
Before a state decays, the people suffer first.
From ancient times to now,
No state with abundant people and flourishing prosperity
Has ever decayed while its people thrived in ease.

When roots wither, branches rot,
And the people are exhausted, the state is ruined.
The Great Wall’s construction brought ruin to Qin,
The Grand Canal’s labor brought ruin to Sui.
To follow the path of a toppled cart leads to ruin,
To emulate a fallen state leads to annihilation.
Han Wu sought Qin’s excesses and nearly toppled—
Yet he avoided ruin through late remorse and repentance.
Jie and Zhou perished by indulging in women,
And King You’s Baosi mirrored their fate.
Han fell due to eunuch influence,
And Tang’s *zhongwei* (中尉) followed the same ruin.
What has already arisen must be observed,
What is about to arise must be preempted,
And what is detestable must be avoided in advance.
What has already arisen—
Observe it and depart.
What is about to arise—
Anticipate and eliminate it.
What is detestable—
To rush toward it is worse than abandoning it entirely;
To act recklessly is worse than...

Restrain the heart and remain unmoved.
Those who fear peril find security,
Those who fear ruin find survival.

What mortals pursue,
If aligned with the Dao brings fortune,
If contrary to the Dao brings calamity.
The fortunate are where a hundred blessings converge,
The wretched are where a hundred misfortunes assail—
Not by divine decree, but by the natural order.

Those who follow the Dao do not seek blessings,
Yet blessings come to them unbidden.
Those without the Dao fear misfortune the more,
Yet misfortunes assail them all the more.
Is there some divine sovereign ordaining this?
No—it is the natural way.

Diligence in good counsel brings no ill deeds,
Lack of foresight invites near woes.

Men of shared purpose find kindred spirits—
Shun with the Eight Elements and Eight Virtues,
Tang with Yi Yin,
Confucius with Yan Hui.

Men of shared virtue share their burdens—
King Wen’s brothers Hou and San,
King Zhou’s father and teachers,
King Wu’s minister Zhougong,
Guan Zhong’s mentor Bo Shu.

Men of shared malice conspire—
Zhou’s ministers numbering in the millions,
Zhi’s disciples numbering nine thousand.

Men of shared love seek one another—
Those who love profit seek tax collectors,
Those who love martial prowess seek warriors,
Those who love courage seek those who delight in harm,
Those who love immortality seek alchemical adepts,
Those who love omens seek forgers of portents.
All such loves are but the partiality of desire,
The blindness of nature.

Men of shared beauty envy one another—
Women like Wu Zetian, Wei Zifuren, Xiao Liangdi,
Men like Zhao Gao, Li Si.

Men of shared wisdom plot together—
Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Zhai Rang, Li Mi.

Men of shared rank destroy one another—
Power grinds power to dust.
Men of shared gain resent one another—
Harm begets retribution.

Like sounds resonate, like qi responds.
The Five Phases, the Five Qi, the Five Tones
pervade all things—
nature’s own resonance.

Kindred natures depend upon one another,
Kindred principles draw near.
In shared trials, they aid one another.

The Six Kingdoms united in alliance to resist Qin—
the *Zhuge* [i.e., Zhuge Liang] who connected with Wu to oppose Wei did so not from virtue or righteousness,
but merely to share in shared trials.

Those of shared Dao/Way complete one another.
When Han succeeded Qin, the empire lay exhausted and depleted,
and Xiao He cultivated governance through stillness and tranquility.
As he neared death, he feared the generals—all eager for glory and action—
were unfit to grasp the Way of governance.
Only Cao Shen, who had once governed in Qi following the *Huang-Lao* [Yellow Emperor-Laozi] tradition,
avoided unnecessary action, so he summoned Cao Shen to succeed him as Chancellor.

Those of shared skill regulate one another—
Li Ji’s betrayal of Bian Que, Feng Meng’s treachery against Hou Yi.
*Gui* [regulation] means to oppose.

Those of shared ingenuity vie to surpass one another—
as Gongshu Ban attacked nine times, Mo Zi repelled nine times.
This is the inevitable outcome of numbers—
it cannot defy principle.

From shared aspirations onward, all actions may be foreseen.
The wise recognize this:
to act in accord with principle is to follow,
to act against principle is to resist.

To abandon oneself while instructing others is to resist;
to rectify oneself while transforming others is to follow.
The teacher relies on words,
the transformer relies on the Dao/Way.

The *Laozi* says:
*"When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and robbers multiply."*
This is the resistance of teaching.

*"I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves;
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity."*
This is the following of transformation.

Resistance is hard to follow,
following is easy to enact;
hard to follow leads to chaos,
easy to enact brings order.

The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is simple and easy—
so too the Dao/Way of the Sage.

Follow the sun and moon to mark day and night,
follow yin and yang to govern life and death,
follow mountains and rivers to shape high and low—
this is the simplicity of Heaven and Earth.

Follow the barbarians by keeping them at bay,
follow the Central States by embracing them,
follow the virtuous by ennobling them,
follow the petty by employing them,
follow good and evil by rewarding and punishing,
follow the customs of the Nine Regions in taxation,
follow human relationships in their proper order—
this is the simplicity of the Sage.

Wu Ge was not without strength—
yet when he grasped a bull’s tail to force it forward,
he could not make it move a single step in a day.
But when a sapling branch was threaded through its nose
and a three-foot rope bound its neck,
even a child could lead it.

The wind sweeps across the great marshes unrestrained—
it is because its course follows the natural order.

Thus may one govern the body, the family, the state—
the principle is one, though the scale differs.

The *Huangshi Gong*’s *Su Shu* concludes.

This fivefold principle is called **"employing them according to their talents."**

#27 *"Xiao Liangdi"* (蕭良娣), the *Siku Quanshu* version reads *"Zhang Liangdi"* (張良娣).
#28 The *Siku Quanshu* version omits the phrase *"five sounds"* (五聲).
#30 The *Daozang* version originally lacked the character *"xing"* (行); now restored according to meaning and the *Siku Quanshu* version.

#31 *"Thus"* (如此), the *Siku Quanshu* version reads *"Examine the body and act accordingly"* (詳體而行).
