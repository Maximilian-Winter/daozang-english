**Preface to *Reading the Mysterious***
When I was young, I had heard of the *Taixuan Jing* but had never seen it. I had only observed Yangzi’s *Self-Preface*, which praised the *Taixuan Jing* highly.

Later, when Ban Gu wrote his *Transmission*, he said: Liu Xin once observed the *Taixuan Jing* and told Yang Xiong, “You have only labored in vain.” Today’s scholars seek wealth and profit, yet they still cannot fully grasp the *Yijing*, so what can they do with the *Taixuan Jing*? I fear that future generations will treat it like an overturned jar of fermented soybeans. Xiong laughed but did not respond.

Some scholars criticized this, saying that since Xiong was not a sage, his composing a classic was like the rulers of Wu and Chu in the Spring and Autumn period, who usurped the title of king—an offense deserving of extermination. Gu preserved these words, and though his intent surpassed that of Xin, he did not acknowledge the *Taixuan Jing* as being as excellent as Yangzi claimed.

I too privately wondered why Yangzi did not endorse the *Yijing* but instead created the *Taixuan Jing*. The *Yijing* exhaustively encompasses the principles of Heaven and humanity. How could Yangzi surpass it, yet compose another book? Moreover, I did not know its purpose, so I also did not believe Yangzi was suited to author the *Taixuan Jing*.

Later, as I studied the *Yijing*, I found its profundity and obscurity difficult to grasp. I thought the *Taixuan Jing* must be a work by a virtuous scholar—simpler in meaning and easier in text than the *Yijing*. Those who ascend the Jiao Mountains must first traverse the lowlands; those who journey to the distant seas must first follow the Yangtze and Han rivers. Thus, I wished to begin with the *Taixuan Jing*, gradually progressing to the *Yijing*, hoping to attain even a distant glimpse of its depths.

After years of seeking, I finally obtained a copy. At first, its meaning was murky and indistinct, barely comprehensible. I then devoted myself to careful study, excluding all distractions, and read it dozens of times, comparing its beginning and end, gradually discerning its general outline. Then, sighing deeply, I placed the book down and exclaimed: Ah! Was Yangzi truly a great scholar?

After Confucius’ passing, who else could have known the Dao of the Sage if not Yangzi? Mencius and Xunzi are hardly worthy of comparison, let alone the rest. The *Taixuan Jing* reveals the manifest as it reaches humanity and the profound as it exhausts the divine; it encompasses the vast as it embraces the cosmos, and delves into the minute as it enters hair and thread. It unifies the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and humanity into one, scraping away at its roots to reveal its origin, nurturing all things as their primal mother. Like the earth bearing weight without sinking, like the sea yielding water without depletion. Though there may be those who practice the Dao in the world, none can surpass this in ease.

Examining it from the undifferentiated origin, the *Taixuan* was already born. Observing it in the present, the *Taixuan* is not without effect. Pursuing it to the end of Heaven and Earth, the *Taixuan* cannot be extinguished. Questioning it with the nature of all things reveals no gaps; probing it with the forms of spirits and gods finds no contradiction; aligning it with the Six Classics shows no inconsistency. Even if the Sage were to return, upon seeing the *Taixuan*, he would surely smile with delight, deeming it the fulfillment of his own heart.

Thus, it is clear that the *Taixuan* serves to complement the *Yijing*—not as a separate work competing with it. How shallow He Qin and Gu Xi knew it, yet how profound their misjudgment!

Some say: *"The principles of the Yijing differ from those of the Taixuan. Yangzi did not follow the Yijing but created his own system. How then does the Taixuan complement the Yijing?"*

Moreover, if the Taixuan shares the same Dao as the Yijing, then why have the Yijing at all? Why the Taixuan?

I reply: The hunter’s tools serve to capture game—whether by net or by arrow, what difference does it make? Books serve to convey the Dao: the Yijing is the net, the Taixuan is the arrow. What harm is there?

If one rejects the arrow to rely solely on the net, your pursuit of the Dao will be stifled. Besides, Yangzi composed the *Fayan* to align with the *Analects*; he wrote the *Taixuan* to align with the *Yijing*. If you abandon the *Fayan* yet wish to discard the *Taixuan*, are you not confused?

The Dao of the *Fayan* and the *Analects*—do they truly differ? The relationship between the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing* is the same.

When a great hall is about to collapse, one beam may prop it up, but nothing secures it like many beams. When the Great Dao is about to fade, one book may clarify it, but nothing illuminates it like many books. If a scholar can devote himself entirely to the *Yijing*, that is indeed sufficient. Yet the *Yijing* is Heaven itself, and the *Taixuan* is its ladder. Would you ascend to Heaven and abandon its ladder?

Earlier scholars have expounded the *Taixuan*, and their interpretations are numerous. Yet Yangzi’s writing is rich in exegesis, pointing toward depths so profound that the *Taixuan* itself is the most difficult to grasp. Thus, I doubt whether earlier scholars fully captured Yangzi’s intent. The world must have those who can truly comprehend it—I shall study it until old age.

**On the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing*:**
At their core, the *Yijing* and the *Taixuan* share the same Dao but differ in method.

The *Yijing* employs two symbols: Yang and Yin.
The *Taixuan* employs three: One, Two, and Three.

The *Yijing* has six ranks; the *Taixuan* has four tiers:
The highest is called *Fang* (方), followed by *Zhou* (州), then *Bu* (部), and finally *Jia* (家).
This is what the *Benzhuan* refers to as "threefold modeling and fourfold division," culminating in eighty-one.

The *Yijing* combines eight trigrams to form sixty-four hexagrams.
The *Taixuan* arranges One, Two, and Three across *Fang*, *Zhou*, *Bu*, and *Jia* to produce eighty-one chapters.

Each *Jia* chapter shifts with every variation—three chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Zhou* (周), and *Lian* (礥).
Each *Bu* shifts every three chapters—nine chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (闲), and *Shang* (上).
Each *Zhou* shifts every nine chapters—twenty-seven chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (羡), and *Cong* (从).
Each *Fang* shifts every twenty-seven chapters—eighty-one chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Geng* (更), and *Jian* (减).

Beyond eighty-one chapters, no further addition is possible—thus, it is called the Dao of Nature.

The *Yijing* has six lines per hexagram, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines.
The *Taixuan* has nine *zan* (赞) per chapter, totaling seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*.

The Diagram states: *"The Taixuan has two Dào—one arising from Three, one generated by Three.*
*The Three that arise: Fang, Zhou, Bu, Jia.*
*The Three that generate: the threefold division of yang-qi, forming three layers, culminating in nine camps.*
*This is the same origin but separate manifestation—the fundamental pattern of Heaven and Earth."*

The *Ben Chuan* states: *"The雄潭 contemplates the revolving Heaven, modeling it in threefold divisions and quartering it, culminating at eighty-one—this refers to the *Taixuan* chapters. Again, it says: 'Lateral divisions of threefold modeling and nine foundations, culminating at seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*—this refers to the *Taixuan zan*.' Chapters are akin to hexagrams, while *zan* are akin to lines.

Again, it says: 'Those who observe the *Yijing* name the hexagrams they see; those who observe the *Taixuan* count its strokes to determine it.' The *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are not hexagrams but numerical patterns. Thus, the *Yijing*’s six lines per hexagram each bear words, while the *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are supplemented by nine *zan*, governing what follows below. Therefore, chapters and *zan* proceed along separate paths, not interdependent. Both must be reckoned by days.

The *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* arises from *Zhongfu*, and excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, and *Kan*—their twenty-four lines govern the twenty-four *qi*#9, while the remaining sixty hexagrams each span six days and seven fractions, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. *Zhongfu*’s initial line marks the start of the winter solstice. *Yi*’s upper line marks the end of the great snow. Thus, it cycles and returns to its beginning.

The *Taixuan*’s eighty-one chapters, each with nine *zan*, total seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*. Every two *zan* combine into one day—one for day, one for night—yielding three hundred sixty-four days and a half. Adding the *Zhuolei* two *zan* completes three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. The first *zan* marks the start of the winter solstice, while the *Zhuolei* two *zan* mark the end of the great snow. It too cycles and returns to its beginning.

All *Taixuan* chapters follow the *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* sequence but vary in nomenclature. The first is *Zhongfu*; the cyclical return is *Fu*; *Li* and *Xian* correspond to *Lun*; *Shao* to *Qian*; *Li* to *Kui*. The rest follow this pattern. Thus, the *Taixuan* chapters declare: *"Eighty-one chapters, all affairs are divinely verified. The *Ce* says: 'Perform the *Xun Cheng* ritual, aligning with the Dipper’s encounter. The calendar marks the years, and the grains flourish in season.' All this is as stated.*

The *Yijing* has *Yuan*, *Heng*, *Li*, and *Zhen*; the *Taixuan* has *Wang*, *Zhi*, *Meng*, *Qiu*, and *Ming*. These five are the *Taixuan*’s virtues. *Wang* is the north, corresponding to *Zhen* in the *Yijing*. *Zhi* is the east, corresponding to *Yuan*. *Meng* is the south, corresponding to *Heng*. *Qiu* is the west, corresponding to *Li*#10. *Ming* is formless. Thus, the *Taixuan* text states: *"Wang and Meng reach their extremes, Zhi and Qiu command each other; emerging from Ming and returning to Ming, new and old alternate."*

Since the *Taixuan* begins at the winter solstice, it divides *Zhen* into *Wang* and *Ming*. *Wang* is the period after the winter solstice; *Ming* is before the great snow.

The *Yijing*’s *Great Correlation* number is fifty, with forty-nine in use. The *Taixuan*’s Heaven and Earth strategies are eighteen each, totaling thirty-six. Earth omits three, using thirty-three. The *Yijing* casts with four; the *Taixuan* casts with three. The *Taixuan* casting method: divide one hexagram in half, then use three casts per unit—one as *sou*, one as *huan*. Combine the remainder with *tiao*, and after one *tiao*, count the rest: seven as one, eight as two, nine as three. The *Yijing* has seven, nine, eight, and six—called the four symbols. The *Taixuan* has one, two, and three—called the threefold models. Both are the numerical foundations of hexagram chapters.

The *Yijing* has *Tuan*, the *Taixuan* has chapters. *Tuan* is the hexagram’s text; chapters likewise summarize the meaning of a single chapter. The *Yijing* has lines, the *Taixuan* has *zan*. The *Yijing* has symbols, the *Taixuan* has *Ce*. *Ce* interprets the *zan*. The *Yijing* has *Wenyan*, the *Taixuan* has *Wen*. *Wen* elucidates the Five Virtues, alongside the central chapter’s nine *zan*—akin to *Wenyan*.

The *Yijing* has *Xici*, the *Taixuan* has *Chui*, *Ying*, *Lian*, *Tu*, and *Gao*. These five expound upon the *Taixuan zan*—akin to *Xici*. The *Yijing* has *Shuo Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Shu*. *Shu* discusses the symbols of the nine *zan*—akin to *Shuo Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Xu Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Chong*. *Chong* sequences the eighty-one chapters, resolving yin and yang oppositions—akin to *Xu Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Za Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Cuo*. *Cuo* interweaves and expounds upon the eighty-one chapters. Though paths diverge, they converge; myriad thoughts unite in harmony, all rooted in the *Taiji*, Two Principles, Three Talents, Four Seasons, and Five Phases, returning to Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety.

**Annotations from *Ji Zhu* of *Yangzi Taixuan Jing Xu* by Song Zhong (Han Five Business Official):**
Song Zhong first composed *Jie Gu* for the *Taixuan*, Wu Yu Lin’s Governor Lu Ji authored *Shi Zheng*, Jin Shangshu Lang Fan Wang wrote *Jie Zan*, Tang Menxia Shilang Pingzhangshi Wang Ye annotated the *Jing* and chapters, *Ce*, Song Xing Du Guan Langzhong Zhi Zhao Wen Guan Song Weigan comprehensively commented, Qinzhou Tian Shu Yu Chen Jian authored *Yanxuan*, and Sifeng Yuanwailang Wu Mi wrote *Yinyi*.

「During the *Qingli* era, Guang Shi first obtained and read the *Taixuan*, composing *Du Xuan* ["Reading of the *Xuan*"].
Since then, he sought and gathered these several works, all of which he acquired,
and further wrote *Shuo Xuan* ["Explanations of the *Xuan*"].
Exhausting his vital *qi* and straining his spirit over thirty years,
he still could not penetrate their defenses.
Given the depth of his dedication, abandoning them seemed regrettable,
so he followed the *Fayan* ["Speaking of the *Fa*"],
and compiled the *Jizhu* ["Collected Commentaries"] for it.
Truly he did not measure his own capacity,
yet perhaps future scholars may find some use in his efforts.

As for those who simply say "Song," they refer to Zhongzi;
those who say "Xiao Song," refer to the *Zhaowen Langzhong*.

and the *Jin* Fan Wang’s *Jizhu* on the *Taixuan Jing* (as per the *Ming* Wan Yutang’s edition of the *Song* text,
hereafter referred to as the *Fan* edition),
where Lu Ji expounds on the *Xuan*: *"Its lost aspects are rectified through elucidation"*—thus altered.

**Collected Commentaries on the *Taixuan Jing*, Volume One?**」

**Collected Commentaries on the *Taixuan Jing*, Volume Two**

One *Zhou* and two *Fang*, one *Shi* and three *Tong*:
The *Yin* *Shi* is wood, aligning with *Meng*.

The *Yang* *Qi* begins to emerge, and things take form but are yet unknown.
*Fan* says: At the *Lichun* node, all things sprout in their initial forms, branches and leaves not yet unfurled, hence called *Tong*.
*Guang* says: The *Yang* *Qi* faintly appears upon the earth, hence "begins to emerge."

**#11** *Zheng* [Explanation of *Zheng*]:
*Zhuan* does not awaken, meeting me in *Menghun*.
*Ce* says: *Zhuan* does not awaken, lest it remain utterly obscured.
One represents *thought at its beginning*—yet at night, the *Zhuan* person does not awaken to learning and ultimately returns to *Menghun*.

**#12** *Error* at the *Lingshi*, *Zhao* at the *Guizi*, emerging from mud and entering fat.
*Ce* says: *Error* at the *Lingshi*, *Zhao* at the *Guizi*—this compares to the *Guang*’s *Dao*.
*Wang*’s edition renders *Guizi* as *Yuanguiz*, and his note states: "Illuminated by the *Yuanguiz*, the auspicious signs of fortune or misfortune are drawn."
This is clearly a textual error. *Zhao* is synonymous with *Zhao* (illuminate).
*Bi* is pronounced *pinmei* (repeatedly).
Mud symbolizes stagnation; fat, the source of clarity.
Two represents *thought in its midst*—yet at day, though one can seek clarity in darkness, like divining with the *Lingshi* and *Guizi* to resolve doubts, emerging from stagnation and entering brightness, hence "comparing to the *Guang*’s *Dao*".
*Bi* also means "near." *Cuo* refers to the intricate divination of *shi* (yarrow stalks) to perform *shi* (fortune-telling).

**#13** The *Dongchen* shines, yet cannot act.
*Ce* says: If the *Dongchen* shines, why does it not proceed?
The *Xiaosong* edition renders *why does it not proceed* as *why cannot it proceed*, and I follow the other editions.
Three represents *thought at completion*—like the east where light has already dawned, and one could act, yet cannot, symbolizing those who fail to learn and lose time.

**#14** Sometimes it follows, sometimes precedes, the husband—
first bestowing its light. #1
*Ce* says: Sometimes it follows, sometimes precedes, the husband—
this is the *Guang*’s greatness. #2

**#15** *Meng* seeks the *Ru* with brushwood,
its gain is not beautiful.
*Ce* says: *Meng* seeks the *Ru* with brushwood—
its gain is not joyous.

**#16** Wide opening of curtains and screens,
to welcome guests from afar.
*Ce* says: Wide opening of curtains and screens—
this is surveying all the lights.
Curtains and screens are what obscures light.
Six represents *uppermost fortune*, and also *abundance*—
like a ruler receiving scholars from all directions, without concealment.
*Shun* hosted guests at the four gates, illuminating the four eyes, and attaining the four ears.

**#17** Cultivating the *Zhu*, comparing to the *Zhu* scholar. #4
*Ce* says: The cultivation of the *Zhu*—
there is nothing to be done.
*Zhu* is pronounced like *zhu* (stump).
*Xiu* means "long."
*Zhu* refers to a tall stature.
Seven represents seventy—age has grown long,
yet at day’s night, though tall in stature,
its wisdom compares to that of a *Zhu* scholar,
still not free from ignorance.
This symbolizes occupying the *Junzi*’s station yet following the *Xiaoren*’s *Dao*.

**#18** Sometimes struck, sometimes pierced,
cultivating its *Xuanjian*,
yet it fails.
*Ce* says: Struck and pierced—
this is decline from excess.
*Ce* (pierce) is pronounced *qi* (seven).
Not learning and thus being foolish,
leading to decay and old age,
falling into misfortune,
hence "sometimes struck, sometimes pierced."
Yet at day’s light,
if still capable of learning,
cultivating its *Xuanjian*,
it may yet transform misfortune into fortune.
*Jin Ping Gong* asked *Shi Guang*:
"My age is seventy, and I wish to learn—
fear it is already too late."
*Shi Guang* replied:
"Youthful love of learning is like the radiance of the sun at dawn;
Mature love of learning is like the brightness of day;
Old age love of learning is like the glow of a candle.
The glow of a candle—
who can compare to the darkness of night?"
*Uppermost Nine*:
The *Tong* deer collides with the rhinoceros,
its head is ashen.
*Ce* says: The *Tong* deer collides with the rhinoceros—
this is returning to its own burden.
The other editions render *burden* as *scenery*, but I follow the *Xiaosong* edition, pronounced *li* (force).
*Wang* says: At the extreme of *Tong*,
in the night’s position,
in the deepest *Menghun*,
those who cannot reflect upon themselves.
The *Tong* deer is a deer without horns.
*Guang* says: It is like being pulverized. #5
Nine is at the extreme of *Tong*, encountering the utmost misfortune.
Like the *Tong* deer colliding,
its head is crushed, #6
not measuring its own strength—
the depth of its foolishness.

**One *Zhou*, Two *Fang*, Two *Shi*, One *Jia* Added:**
The *Yang* *Shi* is metal, aligning with *Yi*.

**One *Zhōu*, Two *Fāng*, Two *Shì*, One *Jiā* Added:**

The *Yáng* **qi** flourishes and grows—
things thereby increase and multiply,
day by day spreading and nurturing.

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions render *Yáng qi* flourishes and grows* as *Yáng qi* this flourishes and grows*, the *Wáng* and *Xiaosong* editions as *Yáng* this flourishes and grows*; I follow the *Fàn* edition.
The *Lù*, *Fàn*, and *Wáng* editions render *increase* as *adorned increase*; I follow the *Sòng* and *Xiaosong* editions.
The *Sòng*, *Xiaosong*, *Lù*, and *Wáng* editions render *while* as *like*; I follow the *Fàn* edition.

**First (hexagram) line:** *Hearing* (augury) *increase*—
growth in silence, unseen by others.
**Cè** says: *Hearing* (augury) *increase* in silence—
this is knowing the inner.
The *Wáng* edition renders *hearing* as *interval*; I follow the other editions.
*Silence* should be read as *silent reflection*.

One is the beginning of thought,
and should be marked with a stroke.
The virtuous person listens to the **Dao**/Way,
to increase their **virtue/power**,
and silently reflects upon it,
not revealing it outwardly.

**Second line:** It does not increase its **Fāng** (method/aspect),
but increases its brightness—
*obscured* (darkness).

**Cè** says: To not increase its **Fāng** (method/aspect),
merely to adorn the outer—
this is vain display.
**Fàn** says: **Fāng** is the **Dao**/Way.
*Obscured* is *dimmed*.
**Wáng** says: To not increase the **Dao**/Way,
yet outwardly boast and seek to enhance brightness,
one’s own light is obscured instead.
**Guāng** says: The virtuous person increases and refines the **Dao**/Way,
and honor follows naturally.
The petty person abandons the inner to adorn the outer,
seeking brightness while only growing more dim.

**Third line:** Wood halts its growth—
gradual increase.
**Cè** says: Wood halts, then gradually increases—
it cannot be covered.
The *Fàn* edition renders *covered* as *increased*; I follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Wáng* editions.
**Wáng** says: *Covered* means *concealed*.
**Guāng** says: The virtuous person’s learning,
like wood whose roots halt in the soil where it grows,
while its branches and leaves gradually lengthen.
The virtuous person halts at the **Dao**/Way they guard,
while their **virtue/power** grows ever new.
*The Law of Speech* says: Someone asks: “Wood grows gradually.”
It replies: “Wood that halts below and grows above—
is that not wood?
It is also like water.”

**Fourth line:** The *Yáo* (binding) is not overcome,
yet it may increase—
*wearing* it as a burden.

**Cè** says: The *Yáo* (binding) is not overcome—
this can lead to ruin.
Four is the position of *lowered fortune*,
and corresponds to night.
To enjoy fortune without **virtue/power**,
like one weak yet burdened with increase,
is to be certain of failing in their task.

**Fifth line:** The *Zé* (marsh) expands its form,
all nourished, their blessings shared alike.
**Cè** says: The *Zé* (marsh) expands its form—
this is greatness in humility.
**Wáng** says: Like the marsh spreading below,
where all nourishment gathers.
**Guāng** says: Five is the height of increase.
All share in enhancing it—
how else could it be so widely spread,
if not through humility?

**Sixth line:** A *red chariot* (augury) divides the *torch*—
one reading: *Increase me three thousand* (fortunes).
The virtuous rejoice; the petty grieve.
**Cè** says: The *red chariot*’s increase—
this is not fitting for the petty.

**Seventh line:** It increases its height,
sharpens its edge—
the *hill* (augury) stands firm.

**Cè** says: To increase its height and sharpen its edge—
this is the realm where both increase and decrease occur.
Seven is the upper body,
and the foundation for misfortune—
a place of dread.
The *Jiā* (line) nature is to increase;
if it increases without restraint,
it will surely suffer harm.

Seven should be marked as the *trigram* **Zhuì** (gradual),
the **Dao**/Way of the virtuous.
Thus, they can each time cultivate self-restraint,
to preserve their stability.

The reason a *hill* tilts is its sharpness.
If one can each time increase its height,
yet also sharpen its edge,
making it gentle and sloping,
then it will never tilt.
This is the *hill*’s true **Dao**/Way.
*Zhèng Kāo Fù*’s three commandments—
now even more reverent.
The first commandment, he bent his back;
the second, he stooped his body;
the third, he bowed his head.

**Eighth line:** It combines *shells* (augury) to serve—
benefiting in the going, harm in the coming.
**Cè** says: It combines *shells* (augury) to serve—
this is rejoicing now, ruin later.
*Harm* is pronounced *xuē* (to shave).
*Shells* are *wealthy resources*.
*To serve* is *menial labor*.
To use wealthy resources for menial labor,
greed without end.
Though benefiting in the going,
harm comes in the coming—
thus, it is rejoicing now, ruin later.

**Uppermost Nine:**
*Lofty and towering*, it does not collapse—
relying on the *supporting marsh*.
**Cè** says: *Lofty and towering*, it does not collapse—
this is the gathering of many virtuous.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions render *supporting marsh* as *yǐng yōng* (unclear), I follow the *Fàn*, *Wáng*, and *Xiaosong* editions.
*Lofty* is pronounced *cuī* (to depart).
*Supporting* is pronounced *yǒng* (two).
*Marsh* is pronounced *mǐ* (to conceal).
*Gathering* is pronounced *qú* (channel).

**Fàn** says: *Supporting marsh* is the *foot of the mountain*.
**Wáng** says: *Gathering* is the appearance of *support*.
**Guāng** says: Nine is at the extreme of increase,
encountering the utmost misfortune.
Yet it escapes blame,
for the many virtuous serve as its aid.
Like a high mountain that does not collapse,
relying on the *supporting marsh* as its foundation.

**One *Zhōu*, Two *Fāng*, Two *Shì*, Two *Jiā*, Two *Bù* Sharpened:**

**Yin Family Earth, measured by gradualness.**

**First Sharpness (Hexagram 5):**
Entering the fifth rank, thirty-one degrees and thirteen seconds;
responding to the *Rain Water* qi.
The Yang qi is lofty and sharp—
all things in their generation
are single-minded and undivided.
*Lofty* (*cén*): pronounced *chú zān* (plow-pin).
*Lofty* (*cénrán*): the appearance of sharpness.
The Dao of sharpness values singularity.

**First line (yín):**
The crab’s encircling retreat,
later the earthworm drinks from the Yellow Spring.
**Commentary:** The crab’s encircling retreat—
its heart is not singular.
**Fàn** says: *Encircling retreat*—the form of many legs.
**Wáng** says: *Encircling retreat*—encompassing abundance.
**Wú** says: *Encompassing abundance*—the appearance of restless agitation.
**Guāng** cites *Xúnzǐ*:
*The earthworm lacks sharp claws or strong bones,
yet it eats the dust above and drinks from the Yellow Spring below—
all because its mind is singular.*
The crab walks on six legs yet wields two claws,
and without the holes of snakes and tortoises has nowhere to shelter—
its mind is restless.
One is the beginning of thought,
and corresponds to night,
when family nature is sharp,
thus this symbol arises.
*Dì* (kneel): *qù wěi* (abandoned), meaning *foot*.

**Second line (yáng):**
Sharp and singular—
nothing it does not reach.
**Commentary:** The reach of sharp singularity—
it must grasp the Dao.
Two is the midpoint of thought,
and corresponds to day,
thus it is said: *Sharp and singular—
nothing it does not reach.*
All possess one virtue:
*"Virtue is singular—
in action, nothing is unauspicious;
virtue is two or three—
in action, nothing is auspicious."*
**Xúnzǐ** says:
*"He who walks the crossroads does not arrive,
he who serves two lords is not contained.
The eye does not see two things and yet is clear,
the ear does not hear two things and yet is keen.
The flying snake has no feet,
the five-skilled dormouse is exhausted.
The *Shī* says:*
*The cuckoo in the mulberry,
its seven younglings.
The virtuous gentleman’s bearing is singular—
his bearing is singular,
his heart is knotted.*
Thus the gentleman binds himself to singularity."*

**Third line (yín):**
Mad sharpness—
drift.
**Commentary:** The drift of mad sharpness—
it cannot dwell in singularity.
Three is the end of thought,
and corresponds to night.
*Mad*—to advance without singularity.
Drifting without foundation,
success is unseen.
*The Yì* says:
*"Advancing like a weasel-mouse—
perseverance brings peril."*

**Fourth line (yáng):**
Sharp in season—
nothing is unprofitable.
**Commentary:** Sharp in season—
it finds its due.
Four is the beginning of fortune,
and corresponds to the *huà* (drawing),
for sharpness that meets its time—
thus nothing is unprofitable.

**Fifth line (yín):**
Sharp to the east, forgetting the west;
seeing its back, not seeing its heart.
**Commentary:** Sharp to the east, forgetting the west—
it cannot turn aside.
*Back*—the exterior.
*Heart*—the interior.
Five is peak fortune,
and corresponds to night,
when the petty man knows gain but not loss,
sees profit without heeding harm,
greedily pursues the front while abandoning the rear,
discards the interior to chase the exterior.

**Sixth line (yáng):**
Sharp at *chǒu* (the multitude),
containing the five tracks and ten thousand *zhòng*,
persevering.
**Commentary:** Sharp at *chǒu*—
fortune and rank are boundless.
*Chǒu*—the multitude.
Six is supreme fortune,
yet also extreme abundance,
corresponding to the *huà* (drawing),
for the sharpness of its beauty.
The gentleman’s advancement
seeks only to harmonize the multitude—
thus it can contain the five tracks and ten thousand *zhòng*
without losing its rectitude.
In ancient times, *xú* was measured by tracks.
*A track*—the space between two wheel ruts,
eight *chǐ* wide.
Ten *dù* make a *zhòng*.
*A zhòng*—six *hú* and four *dòu*.
Five tracks—explaining breadth;
ten thousand *zhòng*—discussing multitude.

**Seventh line (yín):**
Sharp at profit—
shame and evil arrive.
**Commentary:** Sharp at profit—
humiliation lies in one direction.
**Fàn** says: *Shame*—humiliation.
**Guāng** says: Seven is the beginning of calamity,
and corresponds to night,
when the petty man, sharp at profit,
incurs humiliation and evil.
*Direction*—toward.
Humiliation lies in one direction—
speaking of how one incurs shame
through a single pursuit of profit,
without considering righteousness.

**Eighth line (yáng):**
Sharpening its sharpness,
rescuing its failures.
**Commentary:** Sharpening its sharpness—
fearing it may turn to disaster.
Eight is the midpoint of calamity,
and corresponds to day,
when the gentleman, seeing gain, considers righteousness,
looks ahead while looking back,
though sharpening its sharpness,
yet always rescues its failures—
thus it avoids disaster and blame.

**Ninth line (yáng):**
Lofty and precipitous cliffs—
*tuò*.
**Commentary:** Lofty and precipitous cliffs—
sharpness at its extreme must collapse.
*Tuò*: *zhí ěr* (straight).
**Fàn** says: *Tuò*—to fall.
*Jīng*—referring to *jīngróng* (towering).
*Qiào*—steep.
Towering and steep, about to fall below—
thus it is said *tuò*.

**One *Fāng*, Two *Zhōu*, Two *Bù*, Three *Jiā* Reach.**
**Yang Family Water #8, measured by *Tài*.**

**Initial One (yīn):**
Entering at the first day—
**She East Wall.**
Yang-qi branches, sprouts, and tendrils emerge—
All things attain their reach.

**Song** says:
What branches off is called *méi*,
What sprouts from *méi* is called *tiáo*.
Speaking of yang-qi stirring outward—
All things receive their principle,
None entangled by hooks yet fail to reach.

**Lu** says:
*Branches, sprouts, tendrils emerge*—#9
This speaks of yang’s boundless dissemination,
None left unpenetrated.

**Initial One (yáng):**
Midnight’s lone clarity—
Piercing, unyielding.
**Commentary:** Midnight’s lone clarity—
Inner illumination without bounds.
*Jiǒng*—*jiǒngtú nòngqiè*.
**Fan** says: *Jiǒng*—to traverse.
*Qū*—to exhaust.
**Guāng** says: One—
The subtlest of thought,
Thus called *midnight’s clarity*.
At the day’s dawn,
The gentleman’s inner light is silent yet knowing,
Piercing all directions without bound.

**Second Two:**
Confused in the belly, clarity in the eyes.
**Commentary:** Confused in the belly, clarity in the eyes—
Because the Dao is not illuminated.
**Song and Lu** originally said "not illuminated by the Dao,"
Now following **Fan**.
**Guāng** says: Two—
The midpoint of thought,
Yet at night,
Inner clarity obscured,
Then outward sight is also unexamined.
Thus, failing to illuminate the Dao,
Yet relying on external perception—
No benefit.
*Yǐ*—to use.
Why confused in the belly, clear in the eyes?
Because the Dao’s use is not illuminated.

**Third Three:**
Sapling wood, its tendrils flowing—
Its virtue may reach to the gourd’s calyx.
**Commentary:** Sapling wood, its tendrils flowing—
Inner benevolence measuring outward.
*Liàng*—*lì zhāng qiè*.
**Fan** says: *Wéiliú*—branches and sprouts descending.
The gourd’s calyx clings to the earth;
If wood does not lower its tendrils,
Then it cannot be bound and led upward.
**Guāng** says: *Bāo*—same as *páo*.
Three—
The advancing person,
Near fortune, at day’s dawn.
The virtuous: what one wishes to establish, one establishes for others;
What one wishes to reach, one reaches for others—
Not hoarding its beauty.
Like wood lowering its branches to reach below,
Thus gourds and calyxes are bound and led upward.
The *Odes* say:
*"South stands the twisted wood,
Sweet gourds hang in clusters."*

**Fourth Four:**
Small gain, small reach—
Great confusion, flat and flat—
No salvation.
**Commentary:** Small reach, great confusion—
Lone clarity in a corner and a direction.
*Biān*—*bì miǎn qiè*.
**Lu** says: Lone clarity in a corner and a direction—
Speaking of not knowing the four-way reach.
**Guāng** says: *Biānbiān*—narrow and confined.
Four—
Low fortune, at night,
Thus small gain.
The petty man knows only a corner and a direction,
Not the great Dao,
His gains are narrow,
Unable to save what he loses.
**Pénchéng Kuò** served in Qi;
Mencius knew he would die.
Saying: *"His talents are small,
He has not heard the gentleman’s great Dao—
Enough to kill his body, but nothing more."*

**Fifth Five:**
Reaching the central thoroughfare—
Great and small, no confusion.
**Commentary:** Reaching the central thoroughfare—
The Dao’s four-way passage.
Five—
Central harmony, also clarity,
At day’s dawn,
The peak of reach.

**Six Six:**
Great reach, no boundaries—
Do not neglect ditches and levees—
**Opposition.**
**Commentary:** Great reach, no boundaries—
Cannot follow one-sidedly.
*Zhěn*—*zhī rén qiè*.
Six—
Extreme greatness, past the midpoint, at night,
Thus *great reach, no boundaries*.
*Zhěn*—field boundaries.
*Xù*—what marks field boundaries.
*Zuò*—to govern.
The gentleman’s Dao must have altars and halls.
Like vast fields without boundaries—
If levees and ditches are not maintained,
Governance within becomes neglected.
Cannot follow one-sidedly—
Fields are vast; this way loses that.

**Seventh Seven:**
Reaching to acupuncture and incision—
What precedes is lost, what follows is relied upon.
**Commentary:** Reaching to acupuncture and incision—
Ultimately not abandoned.
*Biān*—*bǐ yàn qiè*.
**Wang** says: Though there be the pain of acupuncture and incision,
Ultimately gain the cure’s benefit.
*Lài*—benefit.
**Guāng** says: *Biān*—stone used to probe disease.
Seven—
The knife, also the start of calamity,
At day’s dawn.
The gentleman reaches to changes—
Knowing calamity’s approach,
Severing attachments, discarding evil,
Like acupuncture and incision removing disease.
Though some is lost,
Later gains its benefit—
Not a wasted cure.

**Eighth Eight:**
Confused in the eyes, clear in the belly.
**Commentary:** Confused in the eyes, clear in the belly—
Outer deception of the inner.
Two is in the inner body,
Thus *clear in the belly*.
Eight is in the outer body,
Thus *confused in the eyes*.
Deceived by external things,
With inner clarity,
Though the heart knows it false,
Yet cannot restrain itself—
Thus it ends in ruin.

**Ninth Nine:**
Reaching to blame—
**Authentic, ending in praise.**
**Commentary:** Reaching to blame, ending in praise—
Withdrawing well by the Dao.
Nine—
Calamity’s end, at day’s dawn.
The gentleman knows calamity’s extremity,
Guarding correctness and withdrawing,
Not losing his good name.

---
**One *Fāng*, Two *Zhōu*, Three *Bù*, One *Jiā* Exchange**
**Yin Family Fire**, also measured by *Tài*.
Yang exchanges with yin, yin with yang.
Things ascend to the Hall of Clarity—
*Yūyū huánghuáng*.
**Small Song** originally: *"Yin and yang exchange in harmony,
Endless grace."*
Now following other editions.
*Yū*—sounds like *yù*.
**Song** says: At the seventh division, the hexagram is *Tài*.
Ascending yang at Three—
Already above the earth.
**Lu** says: Below the earth is the Yellow Palace,
Thus above the earth is the Hall of Clarity.
*Yūyū huánghuáng*—restful and beautiful.
**Wang** says: *Yūyū huánghuáng*—the appearance of brilliant clarity.

**Initial One (yīn):**
Dark exchange with the spirit—
Not solemn in its authenticity.
**Commentary:** Dark exchange, not authentic.
Holding deceit, containing shame.
*Sī*—same as *zhāi*.
**Fan** says: *Míng*—obscurity.
Exchanging with ghosts and spirits,
Must be solemn and respectful.
*Sī*—fasting.
*Zhēn*—sincerity.
Exchanging with ghosts and spirits,
Though in darkness,
Without sincerity,
The spirits do not bless.
**Guāng** says: One—
The beginning of thought,
At night,
Thus this symbol.

「Second Two: Dark exchange with sincerity, bright and clear.
**Xie** says: Sincere dark exchange—trustworthy communion with the numinous.
Two is the midpoint of thought#14 and corresponds to day;
The virtuous one can thus exchange with ghosts and spirits in bright sincerity.

Third Three: Exchange with wood and stone.
**Ce** says: Exchange with wood and stone—unable to benefit others.
Three is the completion of intent#15, the first external exchange, occurring at nightfall.
To exchange with the foolish as with wood and stone—
No mutual benefit can be gained.
**Confucius** said: Do not befriend those not as good as yourself.

Fourth Four: Difficult to approach, reeking with incense, entering the gate of loss.
**Ce** says: Coming and going with incense—conducting exchanges with the spirits.
Wang’s original text reads *fú* (福) for *shén* (神), now following other editions.
**Wang** says: *Xūnxūn*—the appearance of multitude.

Fifth Five: Exchange with parrots and gibbons, gaining no honor.
**Ce** says: Exchange with parrots and gibbons—aligning with beasts.
Parrots, though speaking, do not depart from birds;
Gibbons, though speaking, do not depart from beasts.
Five occupies the position of maturity, yet corresponds to night#18—
Exchanging with things without propriety.
To seek honor without ritual—how can it be attained?#19
The *Shijing* says#20:
*"The rhinoceros horn cup is filled,
Sweet wine, thoughts of gentleness.
Their exchange was not arrogant,
Ten thousand blessings come seeking."*

Sixth Six: The great feast is vast and splendid, the small feast exchanges within it.
I have sacred viands, and I share them with you.
**Ce** says: The exchange of great and small—awaiting the virtuous with radiant brilliance.
The original editions of Song, Lu, and Wang read *gégé* (阁阁) for *hónghóng* (闳闳); now following Fan’s edition.
Fan and Wang’s editions read *xiǎo* (殽) for *yáo* (肴); now following Song, Lu, and Wang’s editions.
Fan’s edition sometimes reads *sàn* (散) for *xiǎo* (殽).
*Quān* (圈) is pronounced *qiú* (求晚切).
**Wang** says: *Quān*—the vessel for prepared dishes.
The way of awaiting the worthy shines brightly—
The peak of exchange.
**Guang** says: *Quān*—nurturing and storing leisurely.
*Hónghóng*—vast in appearance.
*Líng*—excellent.
*Yáo*—the body of the offering.
The character *xiǎo* (殽) should be *yáo* (肴).
*Yáo*—to eat.
The great feast speaks to the wealthy virtuous,
The small feast to those without rank.
Six is abundance and corresponds to the evening.
The virtuous, with their blessings, rejoice to share with the worthy.
The *Yijing* says: *"I have fine wine, I share it with you."*

Seventh Seven: Exchange with birds and mice, depleting the millet.
**Ce** says: Exchange with birds and mice—mere deception and waste.
Seven is ruin and corresponds to night.
To exchange with the wrong people—only waste remains.
The *Fayan* says: *"Frequent associations,
Worse than [blank]#24,
This is but robbing praise and food."*

Eighth Eight: Spear and halberd coming and going, with sincerity—no regret.
**Ce** says: Spear and halberd coming and going—military action cannot be abandoned.
Eight is the midpoint of calamity; exchanges not made with benevolence but with arms,
Thus it is said: spear and halberd coming and going.
Yet it corresponds to the evening of the day—
The virtuous use arms to suppress chaos and curb tyranny,
Employing them only when unavoidable.
Not deviating from the proper way, hence no regret.
The rod and flog cannot be relaxed in the home,
Punishments cannot be abolished in the state,
Military campaigns cannot be halted under Heaven—
Their use has beginnings and ends, their conduct has order and sequence.

Upper Nine: Exchange in warfare#21—unauthentic.
Overthrown at the city, fierce and devouring.
**Ce** says: Exchange in warfare#22—how can it be pursued?
Nine is the extremity of calamity, corresponding to night.
The petty exchange in victorious warfare#23,
Not in accordance with the proper way—
Those who overturn states and ruin families.
Attacking *Jié* with *Jié*#25,
Their virtue not differing,
Then only the fierce devour the weak—
No superiority or inferiority exists.
One region, two states, three departments, two families—
*Rǎn* (耎), same as *ruǎn* (软).»

The **Yang** family’s wood, aligned with *Xū* (需).
Entering *Rǎn* (耎) at the first day, called **"Sheltering Kuí"** (舍奎).
Entering the second nine, eight *fēn* twenty seconds, called **"Subsequent Descent of Lóu"** (次降娄).

At the **Awakening of Insects** (*Jǐngzhé*), the Dipper (*Fùxiàng*) aligns with the *Mǎo* position, the *Lǜ* (律) resonates with *Jiá Zhōng* (夹钟).
The **Yang qi** can be firm yet yielding, can act yet rest, retreating when encountering difficulty.
Difficulty—this is the *dàn* (旦) cutting.
On the first day, the **red sprouts** are sharp and pointed, advantageous to advance by withdrawing.
**Ce** says: The red sprouts sharp and pointed—withdraw to move.
**Fàn** says: The red sprouts—when grass and trees first sprout their buds.
**Guāng** says: When buds first emerge, they must first curve and bend#24—like the virtuous withdrawing to advance themselves.

On the second day, **softening the heart**, illness arises.
**Ce** says: Softening the heart—there is no courage within.
The second is **thought within**, and it corresponds to night.
The family’s nature is softness, and its disease is the lack of courage.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals Transmission* says: *"Ren without martial virtue cannot achieve its purpose."*

On the third day, **softening the knees**, guarding its limits.
Though not unrestrained, ultimately there is no defiance.
**Ce** says: Softening the knees—the body cannot be unrestrained.
Knees—same as *xī* (膝).
Defiance—*fú* (拂), pronounced *fú-wù*.
**Wáng** says: Defiance—*lì* (戾).
**Guāng** says: The third pertains to the lower body, hence "softening the knees."
Though it cannot act freely, it ultimately does not violate the proper Way.

On the fourth day, **softening the throat**, three years without swallowing.
**Ce** says: Softening the throat, swallowing lost—timing and measure are missed.
Throat—pronounced *wā* (哇), *yú-jiā* cutting.
Swallowing—*nuò* (噣);

*"The petty man does not heed his beginning, hidden in the extremity of calamity, now only *yǒu yǒu* in wait for Heaven’s salvation. Heaven will but further descend calamity upon him—hence, *tiān pū zhī sǎng*."*

*"One region, three states, one department, one household follow—*
*Yáng family’s water, follow as it comes.*
*Yáng yuè, at the yuàn, at the zé, at the tián, at the yuè—*
*Things aspire with their feet.*

**First:** *Rén yōu fēi zhī, yuè míng suí zhī, jī.*
**Cè yuē:** *Rì fēi yuè suí, chén yìng jī yě.*
*Fēi, fù yě. Jī, shǐ yě.*
*"One for the beginning of thought—hence, *yōu míng*.*
*The moon, newly past the new moon, follows the sun in secret,*
*Like a wife following her husband.*
*When the ruler acts, his thoughts first arise in mind,*
*And virtuous ministers respond in harmony without deliberation."*

**Second:** *Fāng chū xù xù, péng cóng ěr chǒu.*
**Cè yuē:** *Fāng chū péng cóng, bù zhī suǒ zhī yě.*
*Xù xù, rì chū zhī mào.*
*Chǒu, lèi yě.*
*"Two for the middle of thought, yet at night.*
*The petty man’s heart is confused, about to manifest externally,*
*Like the sun just rising, *xù xù* in radiance.*
*Wavering in thought, unsure of its course—*

**Cè yuē:** *Wū cóng zhī wáng, hé zú péng yě.*
*Wáng běn péng zuò míng, jīn cóng zhū jiā.*
*Kuāng, yǔ kuāng tóng.*
*"The Sage cultivates virtue, and people follow naturally.*
*To wail for followers is insufficient virtue."*

*"If virtue is bestowed upon a husband and wife,*
*then they lose their mates,*
*and their desires remain unfulfilled.*

*The *Yì* says:*
*'The maiden carries the empty basket,*
*The scholar flays the sheep without blood,*
*No benefit is gained.'*

**Fifth:** *From the Water hexagram, the line of fullness.*
**Cè yuē:** *From the Water hexagram, the line of fullness—*
*It does not exceed its bounds.*

*the principle of spontaneity.*
*Five, having attained its place at midday,*
*is the master of following.*
*Things that follow, like water in its channel,*
*the channel being *Kǎn* (Abyss).*

*embodies the *Zhōng* (Middle/Moderate) *Way.*

**Sixth:** *Following their eyes,*
*losing their hearts.*
**Cè yuē:** *Following their eyes,*
*losing their hearts—*
*this is to seek excessive following.*
**Wáng yuē:** *Following the pleasures of ear and eye,*
*while neglecting the tranquility of mind and body.*
*Greatly indulging their desires,*
*this is the path of ruin.*
**Guāng wèi:** *Sixth, though central,*
*falls at night—*
*those who pursue external desires while abandoning inner virtue.*

**Seventh:** *Repelling their evil,*
*following their virtue,*
*as *xiónghuáng* (雄黄) transforms corrupt flesh into pure.*
**Cè yuē:** *Repelling evil, following virtue—*
*this is to rescue the dire.*

*sometimes supported by staff,*
*sometimes by embrace.*
**Cè yuē:** *Advancing with *zhuó* (欋) and *sū* (疏) restraint,*

*and *zhì* (制) is *chè* (掣);*

**Eighth:** *Advancing into the depths,*
*the Sage uses a boat.*
**Cè yuē:** *Advancing into the depths,*
*using a boat—*
*this is to follow the Way.*
*In *Fàn* (范), it reads:*
*'Advancing into the depths, yet the boat is used,'*
*now adopted from other scholars.*
*The depths symbolize perilous difficulty.*
*Eighth marks calamity’s peak,*
*hence, *advancing into the depths*.*
*Using a boat,*
*the depths can be crossed;*
*relying on the Way,*
*difficulties can be traversed.*
*One province, three states; one division, three families explain:*
*The *Yáng* (阳) family—Wood,*
*aligned with *Jiě* (解)."*

**First:** *Upon entering the **Shí (释)**, three lines follow,*
*twenty-six divisions, eleven seconds,*
*the **Spring Equinox** *Qi* **responds.**
*The **Yáng (阳)** *Qi harmonizes with **Zhèn (震)***—
*dynamic, rounded, and warm,*
*all things under **Shí (释)** wither and dry,*
*while their shells are loosened.*
*Loosened is synonymous with **shed (脱)**.*

**Cè (测) says:** *Harmonizing with **Shí (释)**—*
*the **Zhèn (震)** *line is dynamic yet formless,*
*the **Yáng (阳)** *Qi is rounded and warm.*
*At the start, the first line is motion without name,*
*and success is attained.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Motion without name,*
*cannot be named.*

**Rán (范) says:** *Rounded, the form of **Yáng (阳)**.*
**Sòng (宋) says:** *Dynamic—*
*the motion of **Zhèn (震)**.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Warm—*
*the radiance of **Yáng (阳)** *Qi.*

*The first line: dynamic yet without form,*
*it is **Qiú (酋)**—*
*meaning **success (成功)**.*
*One marks the beginning of thought,*
*and aligns with **Hùa (画)**.*
*The Sage moves at the slightest stir,*
*nurturing all things,*
*while the common folk see only **success (成功)**,*
*yet cannot name its source.*
*Thus it is said:*
*"Dynamic yet without name,*
*it is **Qiú (酋)**."*

**Second:** *Motion at **Xiǎng (响)** and **Jǐng (景)**.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Motion at **Xiǎng (响)** and **Jǐng (景)**,*
*is not worthy of observation or listening.*
*Echo (**Xiǎng**) follows sound,*
*while shadow (**Jǐng**) follows form—*
*both are movements beyond one’s control.*
*The second line marks the midpoint of thought,*
*and aligns with **night (夜)**.*
*The petty follow others in their motion,*
*like echoes and shadows,*
*thus it is not worthy of observation or listening.*

**Third:** *Wind stirs, thunder rises,*
*following its lofty grandeur.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Wind stirs, thunder rises,*
*this is motion with purpose.*
*Original texts from **Sòng (宋)** and **Lù (陆)** read:*
*"Following its lofty **Zōng (宗)**,"*
*while **Wáng (王)** reads:*
*"Following its **Dào (道)**."*
*Now adopting **Rán (范)**'s text:*
*"Following its lofty grandeur."*
*The third line marks the completion of thought,*
*and aligns with **day (昼)**.*
*The Sage’s actions now manifest externally,*
*like wind and thunder nourishing all things,*
*thus their **virtue/power (功业)** grows ever loftier and grander.*

**Fourth:** *Motion at the hills and mounds,*
*losing the favor of allies.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Motion at the hills and mounds,*
*is to lose the peril of descent.*
*Hills and mounds signify height,*
*while allies signify the lowly.*
*The fourth line marks the beginning of fortune,*
*and aligns with **night (夜)**.*
*The petty’s motion seeks only elevation,*
*ignoring those below,*
*thus they do not escape isolation and danger.*

**Fifth:** *Harmonizing with **Shí (释)**,*
*the **Zhī (脂)** of **Yáng (阳)**—*
*the **Yí (夷)** of four lands.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Harmonizing with **Shí (释)**,*
*the **Zhī (脂)** of **Yáng (阳)**,*
*the people rejoice without bound.*
*Original texts from **Sòng (宋)** and **Lù (陆)** read:*
*"Harmonizing with **Shí (释)**,*
*the **Zhī (脂)** of the people,"*
*while **Wáng (王)** and **Xiǎo Sòng (小宋)** read:*
*"Harmonizing with **Shí (释)**,*
*the **Zhī (脂)**."*
*Now adopting **Rán (范)**'s text.*
*Rejoice is synonymous with **delight (悦)**.*
**Rán (范) says:** *Harmonizing with **Zhī (脂)**,*
*illustrating **moisture and accord (濡协)**.*
**Yí (夷)** means **level (平)**.*
**Guāng (光) says:** *The fifth line resides at the peak of moderate harmony,*
*and aligns with **day (昼)**.*
*The Sage, having attained their position,*
*spreads their **virtue/power (德)** to harmonize the four lands,*
*all of which become **level and joyous (夷怿)**.*

**Sixth:** *Shaking at the court,*
*losing harmony and rectitude.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Shaking at the court,*
*harmony and rectitude both perish.*
*The sixth line is within the second **tì (体)**,*
*near the fifth line,*
*the court is its symbol.*
*Indeed, **virtue/power (德)** softens the central lands,*
*while **punishments (刑)** awe the distant barbarians.*
*Using **virtue/power (德)** to embrace those near,*
*brings harmony;*
*using **awe (威)** to deter those far,*
*brings rectitude.*
*Now, shaking at the court,*
*loses its proper place,*
*thus harmony and rectitude both perish.*

**Seventh:** *Shaking with shaking,*
*unassailable,*
*cleansing their shame.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Shaking with shaking,*
*unassailable,*
*this is to dissolve shame without restraint.*
*The seventh line marks the beginning of calamity,*
*and aligns with **day (昼)**.*
*The Sage possesses **virtue/power (德)** of unassailable might,*
*none dare to insult them,*
*thus they can wash away their shame.*

**Eighth:** *Shaking at what is advantageous,*
*overturned, fallen, and dead.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Shaking at what is advantageous,*
*advantage and death go hand in hand.*
*The petty move at the sight of profit,*
*and fall into the depths of calamity,*
*profit and death accompany them,*
*yet they do not realize it.*

**Ninth:** *Now in prison behind the valley,*
*finally freed from bonds.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Now in prison behind the valley,*
*this is the release from affliction.*
**Sòng (宋)** and **Lù (陆)** originally read:
*"behind the **Pí (皮)**,"*
*now adopting **Rán (范)**'s text.*
*Freed is synonymous with **shed (脱)**.*
*Valley means **birth (生)**.*
*The ninth line marks the exhaustion of calamity,*
*thus now in prison.*
*Within **Shí (释)** and aligning with **day (昼)**,*
*it is behind the valley.*
*One province, three states; two divisions, one family explain:*
*The **Yīn (阴)** family—Metal,*
*aligned with **Dà Zhùang (大壮)**.*
*Metal signifies **repulse (拒)**.*
*The **Yáng (阳)** *Qi strengthens within,*
*able to repulse the **Yīn (阴)** and drive them back.*
*The first line: repulse within the good,*
*losing rectitude and law.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Repulse within the good,*
*the center does not **reflect (宵)**.*
**Rán (范)** originally read:
*"**reflect (省)**,"*
*now adopting the common texts.*
**Wú (吴) says:** *Reflect is synonymous with **resemble (肖)**,*
*citing the **Hànshū (汉书)** for "people resembling heaven and earth."*
**Sòng (宋) says:** *Reflect means **law (类)**;*
*law means **model (法)**.*
**Guāng (光) says:** *The origin of good and evil*
*lies in thought.*
*The first line marks the beginning of thought,*
*and aligns with **night (夜)**,*
*repulsing the good while admitting the evil,*
*thus losing proper rectitude and law.*

*The second line marks the midpoint of thought,*
*and aligns with **day (昼)**,*
*repulsing the evil while admitting the good,*
*thus **hidden rectitude (幽正)** is attained.*

**Second:** *Repulse within the evil,*
*hidden rectitude.*
**Cè (测) says:** *Repulse within the evil,*
*hidden rectitude is profound.*
**Rán (范)** originally read:
*"**rectitude and law (贞类)**,"*
*now adopting the common texts.*
*Hidden signifies*
*that which lies concealed within the heart.*

**Third:** *The hem repels the belt-hook,*
*it is **Yú (渝)**—*
*unrestrained.*
**Cè (测) says:** *The hem repels the belt-hook,*
*there is no means to govern it.*

**Second:** The *Song* and *Lu* versions read *"making and governing"* (制作制), while the *Wang* version reads *"drawing"* (掣). The present text follows the *Fan* version.
**Fan** says: *"Revolutionary leather belts are called **é** (鞶)."*
**Hook** (钩) is what attaches the writing brush.
**Wang** says: *"The **é** and hook are what bind one’s robes, yet they repel and resist—thus it is **Yú** (渝), a deviation from propriety."*
**Guang** says: *"The third hexagram resides in the lower body, hence it is called **shang** (裳).*
*The third line marks the lower-upper position and aligns with **night (夜)**—when a subject repels the sovereign’s commands, refusing restraint, change must follow.*

**Fourth:** *The completion of repulsion—*
*the **Zhen** of birds.*
**Cè** says: *"The completion of repulsion in birds—*
*the proper alignment of law and position."*
**Fan** says: *"**Bì** (毕) means **wǎng** (罔), i.e., net."*
**Guang** says: *"The fourth line marks the beginning of **lù** (禄) and aligns with **day (昼)**—*
*when the virtuous first attain their station.*
*With station comes the power to enforce law,*
*to distinguish right from wrong and restrain violence."*

**Fifth:** *The glue and lacquer dissolve,*
*the bow cannot shoot,*
*the horn and wood separate.*
**Cè** says: *"The glue and lacquer dissolve—*
*faith is not bound.*
*Shoot (射) also rhymes with *food (食)."*
**Wang** says: *"No bond is stronger than glue and lacquer.*
*If the horn and wood of the bow are repelled and separated,*
*how can it shoot?"*
**Guang** says: *"The fifth line embodies **xìn** (信)—*
*as glue, as lacquer, as bow and arrows.*
*Repulsion (格) signifies things resisting and failing to unite.*
*The bow unites horn and wood with glue and lacquer,*
*thus it can shoot.*
*The sovereign unites subjects with trust,*
*thus they can be commanded.*
*The fifth line, though a petty person in a position of power,*
*cannot bind things with trust—*
*hearts above and below grow estranged,*
*hence: the glue and lacquer dissolve,*
*the bow cannot shoot,*
*the horn and wood separate."*

**Sixth:** *The metal breathes, the stone melts,*
*the small departs, the great arrives.*
**Cè** says: *"The metal breathes, the stone melts—*
*beauty is greatness."*
**Fan** says: *"**Yì** (奕) means *great.*"*
**Wang** says: *"What breathes is metal, what melts is stone,*
*what is lost is the smallest,*
*what is gained is radiant greatness."*
**Guang** says: *"**Xī** (息) means *to generate.**
*To generate metal and melt stone—*
*the symbol of repelling evil with virtue.*
*The sixth line marks the upper **lù** (禄) and aligns with **day (昼)**—*
*when the Dao of the virtuous flourishes,*
*and petty men are diminished,*
*hence: the small departs, the great arrives."*

**Seventh:** *Repulse its precious kind—*
*the tortoise and jade bring peril.*
**Cè** says: *"Repulse its precious kind—*
*there is no means to defend oneself."*
**Jì** (緺) is pronounced *wā* (蛙).
**Fan** says: *"The tortoise is the seal, the **jì** is the sash."*
**Guang** says: *"The virtuous align themselves with virtue,*
*thus preserving their blessings and station.*
*The seventh line is the sash,*
*and the beginning of calamity,*
*aligning with **night (夜)**—*
*when petty men repel virtue*
*and refuse to receive it.*
*To repel virtue is to repel blessings and station.*
*Abandoning virtue and losing station—*
*what greater peril is there?"*

**Eighth:** *Repulse its firm **é** (鞶)—*
*the virtuous find their time,*
*the petty man—*
*worry and distress.*
**Cè** says: *"Repulse its firm **é**—*
*justice cannot prevail."*
*The *Wang* version reads **"pán" (盘)** for **é**,*
*but the present text follows the common versions.*
**[Tì] (忧否)** is pronounced *tì*.
**Uppermost (上九):** *Its eyes are girded,*
*its horns are raised,*
*its body is not bowed—*
*struck.*
**Cè** says: *"Girded eyes, raised horns—*
*self-inflicted harm."*
**[Jiāo] (矫)** is pronounced *jiāo*.
**Fan** says: *"**Pū** (扑) means *to strike.*"*
**Wang** says: *"Girded eyes are wide eyes.*
*Raised horns are high horns."*
**Guang** says: *"Repulsion (格) is the use of strength to resist.*
*The ninth line, at its peak, exhausts strength,*
*reaches the end of misfortune,*
*and aligns with **night (夜)**.*
*Petty men widen their eyes and raise their horns*
*to resist others,*
*not humbling their bodies,*
*thus they are struck by others*
*and harm themselves.*

*One region, three states, two departments, two households,*
*Yí (夷) and Yáng (阳) families,*
*earth of the **Zhǔn** (准) and **Yù** (豫) regions.*

**Entering Yí in threes, the sun lodges in the stomach.**
**Yí**—harm, also leveling.
If not harmed by things, then it cannot be level.

The old *Zhǔn* and *Dàzhuàng*—incorrect.
When **Yáng**-*qi* is harmed,
**Yīn** lacks remedy for **huì**,
Things then become level and easy.
**[Tì]**—pronounced *tì*.
**Huì**—pronounced *huì* (as in *hù-huì*).
**Sòng** says: **[Tì]**—to remove.
**Lù** says: When **Yáng**-*qi* is strong,
It harms **Yīn**, and **[tì]** removes it.
**Huì**—disease.
When harmed by **Yáng**, it is disease.
All things without **Yīn** harm are thus level and easy.

**Guāng** says: **[Tì]**—to shave the head.
The ancients call it *kūn* (for adults), *tì* (for children).
When **Yáng**-*qi* shaves and trims all **Yīn**,
**Yīn** cannot self-heal its disease,
Then things attain birth and growth, level and easy.

**First line:** *Zǎi yōu èr*, holding **Yí** within.
**Cè** says: *"Zǎi yōu èr, holding **Yí**—*
*ease within."*
**Fàn** says: *Zǎi*—beginning.
**Guāng** says: *Yī*—the start of thought, at day.
The beginning of contemplation, yet still hidden.
*Èr*—right and profit.
When the two contend, the virtuous take right and abandon profit.
Holding the **Tǎn-Yí** heart,
Nurturing the boundless *hé*-*qi*,
Self-attained within,
Seeking nothing from without.

**Zǐ Xià** said: *"I conquered in battle, thus I grew fat."*
*The Fǎyán* says: *"The joy of **Jūhuí** with gold in one’s embrace—external;
The joy of the **Yánshì** child—internal."*

**Second line:** **Yīn-Yí**, presuming at **Tiānwǎng**.
**Cè** says: *"**Yīn-Yí** presuming at **Tiānwǎng**—*
*loose yet not lost."*
**Lù** says: Though **Tiānwǎng** is loose,
It does not lose evil.
**Guāng** says: *Èr*—**wǎng**, again *èr*—thought’s midpoint, at night.
The petty conceal their guilt,
**Yīn** harmed by things,
Believing none can know.
Yet presuming at **Tiānwǎng**,
Heaven will surely punish them.
**Lǎozǐ** says: *"**Tiānwǎng** vast and wide,
Loose yet never misses."*

**Third line:** **Róu**, the infant’s cry—
Three days without **gǎ**.
**Cè** says: *"The infant’s cry—*
*harmony within."*
(Sòng, Lù, and Wáng manuscripts read *gǎ* as *yōu*; here following Fàn’s *gǎ*.)
**Hào**—pronounced *hào* (as in *hú-dāo*).
**Tàn**—pronounced *tàn* (as in *suǒ-jià*).
**Ài**—pronounced *ài* (as in *yú-qiú*).
**Wáng** says: *Yōu*—reversed *qi*.
**Guāng** says: *Gǎ*—voice altered.
*Sān*—fulfilled intent, at day.
The virtuous, thick with virtue,
Level and easy.
Like the infant, though three days of wailing,
Its voice unaltered—
Harmonious and yielding.
**Lǎozǐ** says: *"The newborn cries all day yet never hoarse,
Harmony’s peak."*

**Fourth line:** **Yí** its teeth,
Or gluttony’s retinue.
**Cè** says: *"**Yí** its teeth—*
*food not savored."*
**Yù**—pronounced *yù* (as in *jū-jù*).
**Wáng** says: Teeth leveled, nothing to eat.
*Tú*—empty, like void.
Some feed with deceit,
Yet gluttony’s retinue remains empty.
**Guāng** says: *Sì*—bone, tooth,
Also fortune’s start, at night.
The petty, greedy for office,
Self-harming—
Thus *"**Yí** its teeth."*
Teeth harmed, though fine food exists,
They cannot eat—
Only gluttony’s retinue is fed.

**Fifth line:** **Zhōng-Yí**, without fail.
**Cè** says: *"**Zhōng-Yí**’s utility—*
*its Way is manifold."*
(Sòng and Lù manuscripts read *"lì qí duō"*;
here following Fàn and Wáng’s *"qí dào duō"*.)
**Wáng** says: Level to govern things.
Where things gather, what failure could there be?
*Wǔ* at center, body upright, rightful—
Thus its level ease.

**Guāng** says: *Wǔ* at peak position, at day,
If one levels the heart to await things,
Then things, near or far, all turn to it.
*The Yì* says: *"Simple and unadorned,
And all under Heaven’s order is attained."*

**Sixth line:** **Yí** at the hut,
Its dwelling mound is empty.
**Cè** says: *"**Yí** at the hut—*
*its virtue lost."*
Virtue—the virtuous’ constant abode.
*Liù* past center, at night,
The petty begin to harm their virtue,
Lose their secure dwelling.

**Seventh line:** **Gānróu gānruò**,
Separating wood, **ài**, metal—**Yí**.
**Cè** says: *"**Gānróu**—*
*yield overcomes strength."*
(Sòng and Lù manuscripts read *"gānróu"* as *"zhuàng"*;
Fàn’s *"gānróu àijīn"* as *"ruò shèng qiáng"*#34.
Wáng’s *"gānróu"* as *"ruò shèng qiáng"*#35.
Small Sòng’s *"zhuàng gānróu"* as *"ruò shèng qiáng"*#36.
Here following Wáng’s *"gānróu"*, Sòng/Lù’s *"ruò shèng qiáng"*.)
**Ài**—pronounced *ài* (as in *yú-fèi*).
**Wáng** says: Though overfull,
Yet rightful, at the boundary,
Attaining **Yí**’s Way—
Thus yielding-weak things level the firm and rigid.

**Guāng** says: Separating wood—
Like drawing rope to dry a well.
**Ài** metal—
Like sharpening a blade on a whetstone.
Yielding overcomes strength,
Ultimately leveling.

**Eighth line:** **Yí** its horns—**lì**.
**Cè** says: *"**Yí** its horns—*
*injury through threat."*
The petty use threat and harm themselves—
A path to peril.
*Bā*—mid-calamity, at night.

**Ninth line:** **Yí** at **[ ]**—
Utility, reverent of sickness and age.
**Cè** says: *"**Yí** at **[ ]**’s *zhēn*—*
*retiring the chariot to the village."*
**Lù** says: *"Retiring from office to return to kin."*
**Wáng** says: Revering decay, sickness, and elders—
The way of *zhēn*.
**Guāng** says: *Jiǔ*—ninety, also extremity.
The virtuous, aged, decline from office,
Self-placing in level ease.
The worthy, through age and sickness, return—
What the ruler should revere.

**One region, three states, two departments, three households—**
**Lè**, pronounced *luò*.

The **Yīn** family’s water—
also governs **Yù**’s domain.

Entering the **Lè** sequence, seventh in rank.
Three parts, eighteen seconds—
daily aligned with **Dà Liáng**,
responding to **Qīngmíng**’s qi.

The Dipper stands at **Chén**,
the pitch-pipe tuned to **Gūxǐ**.

**Yáng** first emerges from the hidden depths,
layered things receiving harmony and softness—
all things rejoice and delight.
**Nào**—*nùjiào* (harmony).
At **Qīngmíng**’s onset, **Yáng** first stirs,
unfurling from obscurity.
Layered accumulations all attain harmony and softness,
thus rejoicing.

**First day:** Solitary joy, gentle and intimate,
reaching not far.
**Cè** says: *"Solitary joy, gentle and intimate—*
*licentious within."*
**Fàn** says: *"Gentle and intimate—*
*the appearance of solitary joy."*
**Guāng** says: *"One marks the beginning of thought,*
*falling upon night—*
*the petty man takes solitary joy in himself,*
*yet cannot share it with others."*

**Second day:** Joy unknowable#37,
**Chén** in heaven.
**Cè** says: *"Joy unknowable—*
*by season and year."*
**Lù** says#38: *"It means practicing virtuous governance,*
*bringing people joy.*
*Like the seasons,*
*making people unaware of its workings#39."*

**Third day:** Neither feasting nor solemn,
*guāyǎzé*, *hàotáo yǐhù*.
**Cè** says: *"Neither feasting nor solemn—*
*ritual and music abandoned."*
**Wáng**’s original text reads *hāo*,
now following the others.
**#**, ancient *diào* (five), *diào* (two).

「Yǎ, pronounced *eh* (as in "heh"). **Zé**, pronounced *zéi* (as in "zei").

**Wáng** says: *"Guāyǎzé*—all are sounds of joyous laughter."*

**Guāng** says: *"Yàn (feasting), is tranquility. **Yǎ (solemn)**, is correctness. The third day marks the completion of intention while in darkness—abandoning ritual and music, drowning in licentiousness and dissipation. Abandoning ritual, one cannot find tranquility; abandoning music, one cannot find correctness. Though they guāyǎzé, if they seek only fleeting, immediate pleasure, how far is their suffering from them? It lies just beyond the door, no farther."*

From the *Shī·Yúzhào* (Book of Poetry: "The Fishes and Reeds"), it censures King Yōu’s words: *"All things lose their nature, the king dwelling in Hào and Jīng, shall find no joy in himself."*#

The fourth day: *"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts."*#
**Cè** says: *"Stroking bonds and severing cords—truly a heart at ease. Bonds, the same as *system* (系). Cords, pronounced *shuāng* (as in 'thread'). To stroke, is to depart. Cords, are the central threads in the weft of a net."*#
The fourth day marks *tiáochàng* (harmony), while in daylight. The virtuous man follows the Dao/Way, finding joy in forgetting his cares, external things unable to burden him, and none are more free than he.#
Thus it says: *"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts."*

The fifth day: *"Bell and drum clamor—clamor—pipes and strings sigh—sigh—perhaps to follow its decline."*#
**Cè** says: *"Bell and drum clamor—joy followed by sorrow. Sigh—both pronounced *cuò* (as in 'wrong'). Sigh-sigh, the sound of fading thoughts."*#
The fifth day marks the petty man indulging in great fortune, unrestrained in his licentious pleasures. Joy to its extreme must bring sorrow; prosperity to its peak must decline.

The sixth day: *"Great joy without interruption, people and spirits, birds and beasts all find their delight."*#
**Cè** says: *"Great joy without interruption—none are left without embracing it."*#
**Dàn** (as in "charm"), pronounced *púgān* (as in "to float").
**Wáng** says: *"The sixth day resides in a position of greatness, at the time of daylight, as the leader of the group. Without interruption means that between heaven and earth, all things find joy, and people, spirits, birds, and beasts each fulfill their nature and float in delight."*
**Guāng** says: *"Dàn (float), is joy."*#
The sixth day marks *lóngfú* (abundant blessings), *shèngduō* (great prosperity), and *jímǎ* (ultimate greatness). The virtuous man of the *Tàipíng* (Great Peace) era benefits all things, with no distinctions—people, spirits, birds, and beasts all find their place, and what joy is greater than this? The fourth day marks *xiàlù* (lower fortune), benefiting only oneself; the sixth day marks *shànglù* (higher fortune), benefiting all under heaven.

The seventh day: *"Men laugh, ghosts laugh, heaven’s appointed term."*#
**Cè** says: *"Men laugh, ghosts laugh—celebrating the completion of joy."*#
The *Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *bēi* (low) instead of *bì* (completion); now following **Fàn**’s version.
**Yāo** (term), pronounced *yúxiāo* (as in "nightfall").

The **King** says: *"Yào (term), is yuē (restraint/limit)."*
**Guāng** says: *"Xī (laugh), is an exclamation of joy."*

The seventh day marks *huòshǐ* (beginning of calamity), yet it falls at night.
The petty man, when his joy reaches its peak, invites calamity—both men and ghosts exclaim in lament, unaware that the great decree is near its end.

The eighth day: *"Laughter and exclamations, self-fear, no guilt nor misfortune."*
**Cè** says: *"Laughter and exclamations in self-fear—ultimately self-preservation."*

The **King** says: *"The Dao of joy is nearing its extreme, yet one still lingers within calamity. This is the perilous path.*
Yet if one holds a position of day, excels in rectifying faults, then even amid laughter and exclamations of mirth, one can still self-fear—thus there will be no guilt nor misfortune."

The ninth day, highest: *"The brink of extreme joy, sorrow without waiting for the day to shift—then the resources for weeping arise."*
**Cè** says: *"The brink of extreme joy—truly something to repent."*
**Jī** (brink), pronounced *jī* (as in "machine").
**Zī** (resources), pronounced *chēn* (as in "anger"), is the swelling of flesh.
**Lù** says: *"Jī (brink), is danger."*
The **King** says: *"At the extreme of joy, yet still at night—sorrow comes immediately, thus the weeping and exclamations of lament.*
**Guāng** says: *"The three [days] warn against excess in thought; the five [days] warn against excess in fortune; the nine [days] warn against excess in calamity.*
The overarching principle is that joy cannot be pushed to its extreme, urging one to remain ever mindful and reflective throughout."*

---

**One family in three states and three departments contends for the Yang family’s fire—litigation.**
The **Yang** *qì* (qi) spreads evenly, neither partial nor biased.
Things involved in litigation each follow their proper order.
**Shì** (spread), pronounced *shì* (as in "style").
**Shī** (apply), pronounced *shì* (as in "sauce").
**Pō** (bias), pronounced *pǔhé* (as in "universal").
**Yí** (order), is what is fitting.
The **Yang** *qì* spreads evenly and balanced—all things vie to advance, seeking to fulfill their proper order.
The *Shī* (Book of Poetry) says: *"By proper order, all things are born, each attaining its fitting place."*#41

The first day: *"Contend not to contend—subtle and hidden."*
**Cè** says: *"Contend not to contend—this is the Dao’s inherent nature."*
**Lù** says: *"Sù (subtle), is zì (natural quality)."*
The **King** says: *"Contend not to contend—this means to contend before things take form, unseen in their traces."*
**Guāng** says: *"The first day marks the beginning of thought, yet it falls at day.*
The virtuous man holds the Dao’s inherent nature, contending in the realm of non-contention. Externally, no trace appears, yet nothing can overcome him."*

The second day: *"Threaten the river—emaciated and shamed."*
**Cè** says: *"The emaciated shame of threatening the river—what can it achieve?"*
**Hè** (threaten), pronounced *hūjià* (as in "call off marriage").
**Zhuó** (emaciated), pronounced *qíqú* (as in "both together"), is lean.
**Zī** (shame), is the same as *hù* (rely on).
To reject others with words is called *hè*.
When the river overflows, who can reject it?
Yet an emaciated and shamed man, not measuring his strength, dares to threaten it with words—how inadequate is this?
The *Shī* (Book of Poetry) says: *"Return with your fierce threats."*#42

The third day: *"Contend in archery, earnest and earnest."*
**Cè** says: *"Contend in archery, earnest and earnest—this is the virtuous man yielding to his neighbor."*
**Fàn**’s version reads *qú* (earnest) instead of *yín* (archery’s earnestness); now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.
**Shè** (archery), pronounced *shènyè* (as in "divine night").
**Yín** (earnest), pronounced *yín* (as in "silver").
The **King** says: *"The virtuous man’s contention is only in archery."*
**Yín yín** (earnest and earnest), is the appearance of utmost diligence.
To yield to one’s neighbor is akin to yielding in deference, and its meaning reads *yín* as *qiǎn* (earnestly).
**Guāng** says: *"Yín (earnest), is the same as qú (deference)."*
**Qú qú** (deference and deference), is the appearance of respectful yielding.
Confucius says: *"The virtuous man has no contention.*
If there must be contention, let it be in archery."
With bows and deference, ascending; descending to drink, its contention is that of the virtuous.

The fourth day: *"Contend for petty gains, not attaining sincerity."*
**Cè** says: *"If petty gains are unceasing, the proper path grows dim."*
The **King** says#42: *"Contend not by the Dao, yet contend for petty gains—it is fitting that one does not attain the path of sincerity."*#43

The fifth day: *"Contend in the thoroughfare, gains without measure."*
**Cè** says: *"Contend in the thoroughfare—this is contention at the midpoint."*
**Fàn** says: *"The fifth day is at the central position, hence called thoroughfare."*
**Dù** (thoroughfare), is the ninefold path.
**Guāng** says: *"The fifth day marks central harmony, yet falls at day.*
The virtuous man holds the Dao’s key, the convergence of governance, responding to changes without measure—nothing can contend with him."*

The sixth day: *"Arms and shoulders like calves, thighs and legs swollen—this is bodily illness."*
**Cè** says: *"Arms and shoulders like calves—this is the minister’s excessive power."*
**Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *jìng* (calves) instead of *jìng* (shinbones), with the meaning pronounced *dié* (swelling).
Now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Fàn** versions.
**Fàn**’s version reads: *"Arms and shoulders like calves"*—now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.
**Fàn** says: *"Branches grow larger than the trunk; ministers exceed their sovereign—both are illnesses."*
**Guāng** says: *"Arms and shoulders like calves—this means arms are as large as shinbones, unmanageable."*
**Chēn** (swollen), pronounced *chēn* (as in "anger"), is the swelling of flesh.
The sixth day, with its **Yīn** essence, surpasses the midpoint and reaches its peak—like a minister’s overpowering strength, which the sovereign cannot control.
**Jiǎ Yì** (Jia Yi) says: *"The world suffers from great swelling; a shinbone’s bulk nearly matches the waist, a finger’s size nearly matches the thigh."*

The seventh day: *"Contend for the trunk and spear, offering sacrifices at the King’s procession."*
**Cè** says: *"The contention of the trunk and spear—this is guarding the sovereign’s person."*
**Wáng**’s version reads *"contend at the spear"* instead of *"contend for the trunk and spear"*—**Cè** says *"contend at the spear"*—now following all versions.
*Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *"offering sacrifices to the King at the procession"* instead of *"offering sacrifices at the King’s procession"*—now following **Fàn** and **Wáng** versions.
**Zhuó** (spear), is the same as *zhuì* (helmet).
**Xíng** (procession), pronounced *hùláng* (as in "door").

The seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity—
its use of arms is for contention.
Thus it says: *"Contend for the trunk and spear, helmet and shield."*

To contend with arms, not for private gain but for the public cause—
what greater fortune could there be?

The *Odes* say:
*"The prime chariot leads with ten teams,
to open the way."*

The eighth hexagram: *"The wolf’s jaws are full,
but arrows lie behind."*
**Cè** says: *"The wolf’s jaws are full—
it heeds no danger."*

**Wáng** says: *"When the wolf devours its prey,
its jaws are full in contention,
yet it knows not of the arrows behind."*

**Guāng** says: *"The wolf’s nature is greedy,
striving to fill its jaws,
yet unaware of the arrows behind—
like petty men who seize profit
while heedless of their peril."*

The celestial constellation *Húshǐ* (Wolf’s Arrow) lies behind the Wolf.

The ninth hexagram, at the peak:
*"Two tigers gnash their teeth—
he who knows retreat is whole."*
**Cè** says: *"Two tigers gnash their teeth—
they know where to pull back."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *"know where to control"* instead of *"know where to pull back"*—
**Fàn**’s version also reads *"control"*—
now following **Wáng**’s version.

*"Pull back"* is pronounced *chè* (as in *"measure"*).

**Wáng** says: *"The utmost of contention
is like tigers fighting, gnashing their teeth—
there must be death or injury.
If one fears harm and withdraws in retreat,
then one may preserve what is whole.
One cannot persist in contention,
so at its height, the symbol shows self-retreat.
The reason one can know the way of retreat
is because the Yang is at its zenith."*

**Guāng** says: *"Pull back"* means *"to draw back."*

One region, three states, three departments, two households—
the Wood family of the Yin clan,
aligned with *Guà* (the hexagram of *Snakes*).

「When entering the *Mù* (務) hexagram, the second line is: *"Day rests at Mǎo (昴)."*#

The **Yáng** *qi* (陽氣) strives in its undertakings,
and all things conform to its will while gathering their affairs.
When the **Yáng** *qi* strives in its undertakings and brings forth things,
all things follow its will and rejoice in themselves,
gathering their affairs without hesitation.

The first line:
*"At the outset, there is no fixed direction—
even the petty man may act upon it—
**wǎng** (罔)."*
**Chè** (测) says:
*"At the outset, there is no fixed direction—
this is not the petty man’s proper concern."*
**Fàn**’s version reads *"At the outset, it begins without fixed direction,"*
now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.
The *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions lack the character *"man"* (人),
now following **Fàn**’s version.
The first line represents the beginning of contemplation,
and one may respond to change without fixed direction.
Yet during the day’s night (the hour of *Mǎo*),
this is not the petty man’s proper undertaking,
so it says: *"Even the petty man may act upon it—
**wǎng** (罔),"* meaning *"without proper measure."*

The second line:
*"Freshly seeking treasures of its own,
pure and refined in its fragrance,
the noble man proceeds with purpose."*
**Chè** says:
*"Freshly seeking treasures of its own—
this is self-illumination."*
**Wáng**’s version reads *"fragrance"* (芳) as *"rectitude"* (方),
and *"proceeds"* (行) as *"virtuous"* (臧),
now following the other versions.
The second line represents the middle of contemplation,
and it corresponds to the day.
The noble man refines and purifies his heart,
preparing to act with resolve.

The third line:
*"Without restraint or retreat,
its heart rots and decays."*
**Chè** says:
*"Without restraint or retreat—
its body is incomplete."*
The *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions read *"its body is incomplete"* (其体不全) as *"its body is whole"* (其体全),
now following **Fàn**’s and *Xiǎo Sòng* versions.
**Chè** (掣) is pronounced *chè* (尺制切).
The third line represents the end of contemplation,
and it corresponds to the night,
when the petty man is moved by fleeting emotions,
losing his heart and damaging his body.

The fourth line:
*"Seeing arrows rise on their own,
benefiting from the companionship of feathers,
it covers the carriage and loads it."*
**Chè** says:
*"Arrows reach the carriage—
this is their proper course."*
The *Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *"Seeing arrows reach the carriage"* (见矢及盖) as *"Seeing arrows reach the carriage"* (见矢及盖车),
**Fàn**’s version reads *"Arrows reach the carriage"* (矢及盖),
now following **Wáng**’s version.
**Fàn** says:
*"Arrows rise on their own—
this is the power of feathers."*
Feathers unite with the arrow’s shaft,
and then they may fly.
Just as the ruler and minister act in harmony,
they drive the wind and transform customs.
The carriage carries its load,
just as the noble man aids the world in its affairs.

The fifth line:
*"The weaver’s labor
is not as beneficial as the silkworm’s cocoon."*
**Chè** says:
*"The weaver’s labor—
it brings no benefit to others."*
The silkworm’s cocoon (*suō* 緰) is pronounced *xū* (息浪切),
meaning *"raw silk or cloth."* **Wáng** alters it to *"cloth"* (褕), pronounced *yáo* (遥).
**Fàn** says:
*"Though the spider produces silk,
its labor is not used by people,
so it is less beneficial than the silkworm’s single cocoon."*
**Guāng** says:
*"The fifth line represents weaving, making cloth, and raising silkworms—
the petty man’s affairs are not his own,
laboring without reward,
so this symbol arises."*
**Lǚ Ào** (旅獒) says:
*"If one does not engage in what is harmful to others
and does what is beneficial,
then the labor is properly rewarded."*

The sixth line:
*"Flowering fruit, fragrant and abundant,
its use is virtuous and proper."*
**Chè** says:
*"Flowering fruit is fragrant,
its use is virtuous—
this benefits the current year."*
**Fàn**’s version lacks the character *"fruit"* (实),
now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.
The sixth line represents the utmost of contemplation,
the completion of undertakings.
The completion of undertakings
is nothing greater than fulfilling one’s **virtue/power** (德).
When flowers and fruit both flourish,
the year is at its peak,
then what use is not virtuous and proper?

The seventh line:
*"Losing its fragrance,
there is nowhere to go."*
**Chè** says:
*"Losing its fragrance—
**virtue/power** (德) begins to decline."*
**Fàn** says:
*"The seventh line represents lost resolve,
so **virtue/power** (德) declines."*

The eighth line:
*"Central and yellow,
free from calamity,
**zhēn** (貞)."*
**Chè** says:
*"Central and yellow, free from calamity—
harmony and rectitude prevail."*
**Wáng** says:
*"The eighth line sits at the point of excess,
nearly inviting calamity.
Yet it finds its proper place in the middle,
dwelling in the upper body’s center,
this is the way of attaining central yellow,
free from blame and regret."*
**Guāng** says:
*"The eighth line represents calamity at its peak,
yet it aligns with the proper course.
The noble man takes harmony and rectitude as his undertaking,
so even calamity does not harm him."*

The ninth line:
*"Undertakings completed, self-destruction;
rains completed, they fall in ruin."*
**Chè** says:
*"Undertakings completed, self-destruction—
this is not their proper fate."*
Ruined (*duì* 队) is the same as fallen (*zhuì* 坠).
**Wáng** says:
*"At the utmost of undertakings,
losing its proper place in the night,
the completed work,
though achieved, is bound to fail.
Like the **Yīn** (阴) completing the rain’s fall,
this is an inevitable outcome—
can it be prevented?"*
**Guāng** says:
*"All things strive to create,
yet undertakings completed inevitably fail—
this is why.
The petty man, when his work is done,
becomes arrogant and indolent,
unable to fulfill his natural destiny."*

---
One region, three states, three departments, three households’ affairs:
The **Yáng** (陽) family of the **Yīn** (阴) clan,
also aligned with *Guà* (蛊).
The **Yáng** *qi* (陽氣) greatly exhorts and clarifies its roles,
and all things stretch forth in earnest,
each exerting its utmost strength.

**Fàn**’s version reads *"exhorts"* (勖) as *"overtakes"* (冒),
now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.
Stretch (*shēn* 信) is the same as extend (*shēn* 伸).
It speaks of the **Yáng** *qi* exhorting all things,
as the black oil and kernels of fruits
each fulfill their proper functions.
All things extend themselves,
exhausting their strength,
and follow their own affairs.
Undertakings (*shì* 事) are what one strives to create;
affairs (*shì* 事) are each fulfilling their proper roles.

The first line:
*"Affairs without affairs,
the utmost of affairs without fail."*
**Chè** says:
*"Affairs without affairs—
this is the way of acting."*
**Wáng** says:
*"All affairs are properly ordered,
why should there be any action at all?
Simply rectify their roots.
Yet when the **Yáng** *qi* is at its zenith during the day,
at the start of affairs,
one may rectify their roots."*

**Guāng** says:
*"The first line represents the beginning of contemplation,
the source of purity of heart,
the root of all affairs.
The noble man clears his source,
rectifies his root,
and then there are no affairs he cannot manage."*#
**Lǎo Zǐ** says:
*"Without action, yet nothing remains undone."*

The second line:
*"Affairs lie at the pivot,
neither consulting nor divining,
losing its wise symbol."*
**Chè** says:
*"Neither consulting nor divining—
its wisdom is lost."*
Divining (*zōu* 诹) is pronounced *zǐ hóu* (子侯切) or *zǐ yú* (子于切).
Wisdom (*zhì* 知) is the same as intelligence (*zhì* 智).
A symbol (*fú* 符) is the auspicious token one guards.
The second line represents the middle of contemplation,
so it says: *"Affairs lie at the pivot."*
The pivot is where honor and disgrace,
safety and danger,
are decided.
When affairs are at the pivot,
contemplation has yet to unfold—
one should seek counsel from the virtuous,
to find the proper course.*

But on that very night, foolish and self-reliant,
he neither consults nor divines,
thus losing his wise symbol.

Emperor Yao sought counsel from the masses,
Shun took joy in accepting others’ virtues as his own,
and Confucius asked questions in every matter.

The third line:
*"Time departs and returns,
no space for delay."*
**Chè** says:
*"Time departs and returns—
it does not lose its course."*
The *Wang* text omits the character *container* (容), following the *Song*, *Lǚ*, and *Fàn* editions.
The third line represents *completed intent*.
When contemplation is complete,
one must center his will and act.
If one misses the moment,
regret comes too late—
thus it says: *"Time departs and returns,
no space for delay,"*
speaking of how gain and loss
lie in a hair’s breadth.

The fourth line:
*"Male and female affairs,
no substitution of characters."*
**Chè** says:
*"Male and female affairs—
this is not their proper duty."*
**Wang** says:
*"If it is not their affair,
it must lead to misfortune."*
For a male to attend to female affairs
is a grave dereliction—
why not substitute the character *nurture* (育)?
The fourth line exceeds its proper measure at night,
contrary to its due place,
hence the saying.

**Guāng** says:
*"If a man substitutes for a woman’s duties, his household will suffer misfortune;
if a subject usurps the ruler’s authority, the state will fall into disorder.
This makes clear that each affair has its proper constant."*

The fifth line:
*"Attend to one’s own affairs,
the king grants him sustenance."*
**Chè** says:
*"Attend to one’s own affairs—
this is the duty one is tasked with."*
**Wang** says:
*"Grant" (假) means "to bestow upon."*
**Guāng** says:
*"To attend to one’s own affairs means
to attend to what one ought to attend to.
Each holds his proper station,
thus the king bestows upon him sustenance—
receiving blessings and emoluments."*

The sixth line:
*"Bearing great responsibility alone,
when it arrives, no aid comes."*
**Chè** says:
*"Bearing great responsibility alone—
how can it be borne?"*
The sixth line exceeds the midpoint and reaches its extreme,
where strength is small yet the burden is heavy—
thus it says: *"Bearing great responsibility alone."*
The matter is about to arrive,
thus collapse and ruin cannot be averted.

The seventh line:
*"The elder supports the orphaned,
the young boy carries the pitcher."*
**Chè** says:
*"The elder supports the orphaned—
the young boy knows his place."*
**Wang** says:
*"Though the seventh line exceeds its measure,
it finds its proper place in the day,
not losing the suitability of its affairs.
Thus the elder has the duty of supporting the orphaned,
and the young boy also knows to carry the pitcher to provide nourishment."*

The eighth line:
*"Female affairs for males,
ten years without instruction."*
**Chè** says:
*"Female affairs for males—
the household will never prosper."*
The *Fàn* edition reads *"male and female affairs"* (男女事), but we follow the *Song*, *Lǚ*, and *Wang* editions.
**Wang** says:
*"Exceeding its proper measure,
yet losing its place at night.
Contrary to the suitability of affairs,
this is a female substituting for male duties.
Ten years—
the extreme of numbers.
Without instruction—
incorrigible."*
**Guāng** says:
*"If a woman takes on male duties,
the household will not prosper;
if a subject encroaches upon the ruler’s authority,
the state will not flourish.
Beyond ten years,
strength and influence are already established,
and cannot be undone.
Thus the female does not accept male instruction,
nor does the subject obey the ruler’s commands."*

The ninth line:
*"Arriving at *ear-obedience*, it stops,
its affairs are steadfast."*
**Chè** says:
*"Arriving at *ear-obedience*, it stops—
hearing in reverse, acting in accord."*
*Arrive* (到) is the same as *reverse* (倒).
*Stop* (止) is the same as *foot* (趾).
The ninth line represents the end of calamity while in the day,
able to accept loyal counsel and rectify faults,
not losing the proper order.
Loyal words, though harsh to hear, benefit action;
good medicine, though bitter, benefits the ailment.

**Collected Commentary on the *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经), Volume Three**

**Two *Fāng* (方), One *Zhōu* (州), One *Bù* (部), One *Jiā* (家) Further Corrections**
*"Further"* (更), *jū* (居), *hēng* (亨) rhyme.

The *Yīn* (阴) family is *shuǐ* (水, water), with the *Gé* (革) rhyme.

On the first day of *Rùgēng* (入更), at one *fēn* (分) and nine *miǎo* (秒), the *Gǔ* (谷) and *Liáng* (梁) *qì* (气) align.
On the eighth day, the *Shè* (舍) day concludes as *Tiān* (天) ends.

The *Yáng* (阳) *qì* (气) having ascended,
its transformative influence shifts and alters forms,
and all things undergo change in their essence.

*Song* (宋) says:
*"In the heavens, it is called *fēi* (飞, soaring)."*

On the first day,
the *Mínghuà* (冥化) *pǔzhēn* (否贞) aligns with *xìng* (性, nature).
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The *Mínghuà* (冥化) *pǔzhēn* (否贞) aligns—
the *Shǎogēng* (少更) phase begins."*
*"Shǎo"* (少), *shāo* (照) rhyme.

One marks the beginning of *sī* (思, contemplation),
and corresponds to the night.
In youthful immaturity,
one becomes accustomed to improper ways,
like inherent nature itself,
and such habits cannot be altered again.

*Jiǎ Yì* (贾谊) says:
*"Early formation resembles inherent nature,
habits become as natural as spontaneity."*

The *Shǎogēng* (少更) phase is when
the Dao/Way transforms during youthful immaturity.

On the second day,
the *Shí* (时) *qī* (气) of seven and nine,
the *Zhěn* (轸) influence shifts its Dao/Way.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The *Shí* (时) *qī* (气) of seven and nine—
it does not deviate from its proper course."*
Seven denotes the peak of *Yáng* (阳, yang),
Nine denotes the decline of *Yáng* (阳, yang).
*Zhěn* (轸) means *lún* (轮, wheel).

Two marks the midpoint of *sī* (思, contemplation),
and corresponds to the *huà* (画, division).
The virtuous person harmonizes *yáng* (盈, fullness) and *kū* (虚, emptiness),
adapting to the *shèng* (盛, flourishing) and *kuī* (衰, waning) of the times,
like a wheel turning endlessly,
responding to changes without fail,
never deviating from the perfect course.

On the third day,
the *Huà* (化) *bái* (白) in *ní* (泥, mud),
*Zī* (淄).
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The *Huà* (化) *bái* (白) in *ní* (泥, mud)—
its transformation becomes obscured."*

*Wáng* (王) says:
*"In all matters of change and transformation,
the value lies in converting evil to virtue.
Now, instead, it becomes muddy and *Zī* (淄),
losing the proper essence of transformation."*

*Guāng* (光) states:
*"*Zī* (淄) means *hēi* (黑, black)."*
Three marks the upper phase of *sī* (思, contemplation),
and corresponds to the night.
To dwell with those who are not virtuous,
is like staining white objects in mud—
all become black together.

On the fourth day,
the small gains of transformation,
its application brings no disadvantage.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The small gains of transformation—
what the people aspire to."*

*Wángběn* (王本) originally had six additional characters below *"bùlì"* (不利): *"wǒ pǔ fēi qí yǒu chǐ"* (我否非其有耻),
but these are now omitted in favor of other editions.
Four marks the beginning of *fú* (福, blessings),
and corresponds to the day—
the small gains of transformation.
Small gains in transformation align with the people’s hopes,
and its application brings no disadvantage.

On the fifth day,
the *tóngniú jiǎomǎ* (童牛角马) phase,
neither of today nor of antiquity.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The *tóngniú jiǎomǎ* (童牛角马) phase—
a deviation from heavenly order."*

*Wáng* (王) says:
*"Five occupies the peak position yet corresponds to the night—
this is the Dao/Way of transformation reaching its height,
finding no proper place."*

The cow is made to revert to its calfhood,
the horse is made to lose its horns,
neither of today nor of antiquity—
there is no such thing.

*Guāng* (光) states:
*"Hornless is called *tóng* (童)."*
When the petty person holds high position,
they arbitrarily alter laws and ordinances,
reversing the natural order of heaven.
This neither suits the present age,
nor conforms to antiquity—
it is like those of the *Liú Xīn* (刘歆) and *Wáng Máng* (王莽) ilk.

「Sixth, the phase of *rùshuǐ zàichē* (入水载车) and *chūshuǐ zàiháng* (出水载杭) —
it is fitting for the *Wáng* (王) to transform.

*Cè* (测) says:
*"The emergence and withdrawal of the chariot and the boat—
this is the Dao/Way of transformation."*

All other schools lack the *Wáng* (王) character;
now I follow the *Fàn* (范) edition.

*Háng* (杭) is the same as *háng* (航) —
a boat.

Watercraft and land chariots are the natural order of things.
Just as new shoes must be worn on the feet,
and though a hat may be worn out,
it must still be placed on the head.

*Shāng Wǔ* (商武) and *Zhōu Wǔ* (周武) reached their limits,
harmonizing with Heaven and following the people,
as sovereign and ministers exchanged roles—
this was the natural course of transformation,
which could not be avoided.

Seventh, *gēng bù gēng* (更不更) —
to feign transformation while actually causing harm.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"Feigning transformation without transformation—
this is the inability to govern oneself properly."*

The original editions of all schools read *"able to govern oneself properly"* (能自臧也),
but now I follow the *Wáng* (王) edition.

Seven marks the beginning of calamity,
yet corresponds to the night.
The decay of *súhuà* (俗化) is due to
failing to transform when transformation is needed—
thus, no transformation occurs.

*Dǒng Zhòngshū* (董仲舒) said:
*"To govern without implementing policies,
the most severe cases must be transformed and altered—
only then can order be restored."*

Eighth, *sìmǎ xiāngxiāng* (驷马跙跙) —
the four horses stumbling, yet able to transform their guidance.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The four horses stumbling in *sìmǎ xiāngxiāng* (驷马跙跙)—
transforming their guidance is indeed good."*

The *Fàn* (范) edition reads *"transforming their guidance"* (而更其御),
but now I follow the *Sòng* (宋), *Lù* (陆), and *Wáng* (王) editions.

*Xiāng* (跙) is pronounced with the tone of *cái* (才) and the *qiè* (切) rhyme.

*Fàn* (范) says:
*"Stumbling (*xiāngxiāng* 跙跙) means disarray."*

*Wáng* (王) says:
*"When one holds high position during the day,
they should transform according to the Dao/Way.
The four horses stumbling (*xiāngxiāng* 跙跙) —
their movement does not advance.
Transforming with proper guidance (*liáng yù* 良御),
only then does it suit its purpose."*

*Guāng* (光) states:
*"Eight is the midpoint of calamity,
thus it is called *sìmǎ xiāngxiāng* (驷马跙跙),
to symbolize the instability of the state.
Yet it corresponds to the day’s brightness,
hence it says ‘transform their guidance’ (更其御).
Transforming guidance symbolizes
replacing incompetent officials with virtuous ones
to govern the state properly."*

Uppermost Nine, *bùzhōng qí dé* (不终其德) —
not completing one’s virtue/power,
and within three years, being replaced.
*Cè* (测) says:
*"The unfinished replacement—
this cannot endure long."*

The *Fàn* (范) edition lacks the *"long"* (久) character,
but now I follow the *Sòng* (宋), *Lù* (陆), and *Wáng* (王) editions.

Nine marks the extreme of calamity,
yet corresponds to the night.
The petty person does not complete their virtue/power,
becoming arrogant and indulgent,
losing their position—
others will replace them.

The *Yáng* (阳) family’s fire phase aligns with this decision.
The two *fāng* (方) regions, one *zhōu* (州), and one *bù* (部) —
two *jiā* (家) schools break the sequence.
」

The **Yang** qi is strong within and firm without,
its movement capable of decisive action.
*The Fàn* edition reads *"able to have shameful decisions,"*
*The Wáng* edition reads *"able to make decisions."*
I follow the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.

**Initial Nine (1):**
The heart is severed, the axe extinguished,
its measuring cords and squares obscured.
*The Cè* says:
*"Severing the heart, extinguishing the axe—
self-governance within."*
One marks the beginning of thought,
yet corresponds to day.
Able to internally sever by law within the heart,
while no trace is seen by others.

**Second Nine (2):**
Obscured severance—
the ears are stopped.
*The Cè* says:
*"Obscured severance—
doubt within the heart."*
Two marks the middle of thought,
yet corresponds to night.
The mind is shrouded in darkness,
unable to decide—
though fine counsel exists,
it knows not what to follow.
Listening is not keen—
hence, *"the ears are stopped."*

**Third Nine (3):**
Severing its deafness,
profitable for purifying filth.
*The Cè* says:
*"Severing its deafness—
profitable counsel."*
*The Wáng* says: *"Deafness"* refers to nasal illness.
*Guāng* says:
Three marks the completion of intent,
yet corresponds to day.
Able to sever obstructions,
admitting wise counsel.

**Fourth Nine (4):**
Severing my *"no"*—
eating what is shameful.
*The Cè* says:
*"Severing my 'no'—
eating what is shameful."*
Four marks lower blessings,
yet corresponds to night.
Occupying a position unfit,
receiving blessings unearned—
unable to sever and depart—
truly shameful.

**Fifth Nine (5):**
The great belly is severed,
its thighs detached.
*The Cè* says:
*"The great belly severed—
just severance."*
*The Wáng* edition reads *"thighs"* as *"clothing"*;
I follow the other editions.
Five marks the manifestation of clarity,
yet corresponds to the *huà* (画).
Severance at its peak—
the great belly cannot contain deceit.
Its thighs detached—
the essence remains.

**Sixth Nine (6):**
Severance without severance—
your enemy is not distant,
only then comes the axe.
*The Cè* says:
*"Severance without severance—
guilt falls upon oneself."*
Six exceeds the midpoint,
yet corresponds to night.
When one should sever but does not,
enmity draws near—
inevitably receiving humiliation.

**Seventh Nine (7):**
*Gēng* severs *Jiǎ*—
my heart is vast,
only then comes refinement.
*The Cè* says:
*"Gēng severs Jiǎ—
justice severs benevolence."*
*The Fàn* says:
*"Gēng"* is justice,
*"Jiǎ"* is benevolence.
*"Kǒng"* means *"extreme,"*
*"shuò"* means *"great,"*
*"shuò"* also means *"beauty."*
*Guāng* says:
*"Gēng"* is metal, representing justice,
*"Jiǎ"* is wood, representing benevolence.
Seven marks the blade—
the symbol of punishment.
The virtuous sever benevolence with justice,
abandoning the minor for the major,
only then achieving governance’s beauty.
*The Shū of Xià* says:
*"Threaten to overcome their affection,
truly aiding them."*

**Eighth Nine (8):**
The bold and stunted assault—
the thief is shrouded in severance.
*The Cè* says:
*"The thief’s severance—
arbitrary judgment."*
*The Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *"assault"* as *"[phonetic],"* sound altered;
I follow the other editions.
*The Wáng* edition omits *"guài"*;
I follow the two *Xiǎo Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* editions.
*"Zhū"* sounds *"zhū"* (株).
*"Fá"* sounds *"fá"* (伐).
*The Fàn* says:
*"Without the Way is 'stunted,'*
*contradicting principle is 'assault.'"*

**Uppermost Nine (9):**
The axe’s edge is fluttering,
profitable for the carpenter’s sincerity.
*The Cè* says:
*"The fluttering axe—
profitable for征乱 (zhēngluàn)."*
Nine marks war and the axe,
again the extreme of calamity—
hence, *"the axe’s edge is fluttering."*
The carpenter wields the axe to fell wood;
the virtuous uphold justice to quell chaos.

---
**The *Yǐn* family’s Wood aligns with this decision.**
*Poised resolve* is achieved—
*guài* flourishes in the royal court,
thus *poised resolve* also bears the symbol of speech.
The **Yang** qi is now strong—
resolute and daring in action,
all things trust its will.
*"Shēn"* is synonymous with *"shēn"* (伸, "extend").

*The Sòng* says:
*"Good without flexibility is 'strong.'"*

**Initial Nine (1):**
Threat is harbored, the void is filled.
*The Cè* says:
*"Threat harbored, the void filled—
virtue and the Way are lost."*
One marks the beginning of thought,
yet corresponds to night.
The petty person harbors threat within,
relying on force to extinguish righteousness.

**Second Nine (2):**
Poised resolve in heart and vitals—
sincerity.
*The Cè* says:
*"Poised resolve in heart and vitals—
internal firmness and rigidity."*
Two marks the middle of thought,
yet corresponds to day.
The virtuous uphold correctness,
firm and unyielding.

**Third Nine (3):**
Threat is donned upon the head,
the virtuous lack it, the petty possess it.
*The Cè* says:
*"Threat donned upon the head—
the petty’s strength."*
Three marks the completion of intent,
while rigidity and resolve appear externally—
hence, *"threat donned upon the head."*
If the virtuous occupy it,
they deem themselves insufficient;
if the petty occupy it,
they deem themselves excessive.

**Fourth Nine (4):**
The virtuous are pleased with their tools,
their speech gentle yet resolute.
*The Cè* says:
*"The virtuous pleased with their tools—
speech is measured."*
*The Fàn* edition reads *"people"* for *"speech"*;
I follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Wáng* editions.
Four marks lower blessings,
yet corresponds to day.
The virtuous’ words all follow measure,
applied like tools—
gentle yet not weak,
resolute yet not obstinate.

**Fifth Nine (5):**
Without tilling yet reaping grain,
poised resolve in selecting blessings.
*The Cè* says:
*"Without tilling yet reaping grain—
blessings unearned."*
*The Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Wáng* editions read *"selecting"* as *"supporting"*;
I follow the *Fàn* edition.
Five corresponds to the night of day.
Without virtue yet enjoying great blessings—
rigidity and fruit apply only to choosing blessings.
Thus: *"Without tilling yet reaping grain,
poised resolve in selecting blessings."*
*The Shījīng* says:
*"Neither plowing nor harvesting—
how do you take three hundred measures of grain?"*

**Sixth Nine (6):**
Poised resolve in beams and pillars,
profitable for stabilizing the great lord.
*The Cè* says:
*"Poised resolve in beams and pillars—
the state’s strength is mighty."*
Six marks upper blessings,
yet corresponds to day.
The state’s great ministers—
loyal, strong, and resolute—
capable of bearing their duties,
stabilizing the realm.

**Seventh Nine (7):**
The *gōng-yáng*’s resolve—
its cry is unlike.
*The Cè* says:
*"The gōng-yáng’s resolve—
speech is unlawful."*
*The Fàn* says:
*"Gōng-yáng"* is the great ram.
*Guāng* says:
*"Yáng"* is a *"very"* thing,
*"lèi"* means *"good."*
Seven marks the stage of calamity,
yet corresponds to night.
The petty are rigid and extreme,
speech without discrimination,
heedless of measure.

**Eighth Nine (8):**
Poised resolve in *huò-zhēn* calamity,
where the **virtuous** one earns renown.
*The Cè* says:
*"Poised resolve in *huò-zhēn* calamity—
it cannot be concealed or obscured.*
The *Sòng* and *Lù* versions render *yǎn* as *dū*, while the *Wáng* version renders it as *què*; here we follow the *Fàn* version.
*Nuò*, pronounced as *Pǔ-kǒu* (蒲口) cutting.
The *Wáng* says:
*"Eight resides within calamity,
so its resolve is poised in *huò*.
Yet it corresponds to the *wéi* (位) position and to day,
not losing its constancy—
this is what earns the **virtuous** one renown."*
*The Guāng* says:
*"The **virtuous** one upholds constancy,
encountering calamity with unyielding resolve—
though the body may be slain,
renown cannot be buried."*
*Yǎn*, to cover.

**Uppermost Nine (9):**
The *zì* boar’s resolve—
its tusks are poised.
It shoots forth with a drawn bow.
*The Cè* says:
*"The *zì* boar’s resolve—
it is hunted by officials."*
The *Wáng* version renders *lì* (吏) as *rén* (人); here we follow the other households.
*Zì*, standing—*xǐ* (喜).
The *Wáng* says:
*"Residing in the extreme position of poised resolve,
and corresponding to night,
if like the wild boar’s resolve in its tusks,
it will surely meet the fate of a drawn bow’s arrow."*
*The Guāng* says:
*"Zì*, the great boar.
The petty, in their extreme resolve, invite calamity—
like the boar’s resolve in its tusks,
sufficient only to provoke hunting and slaughter."*

---
**Annotations (to be removed unless requested):**
# *Huò-zhēn* (祸贞) – Likely refers to a state of crisis or adversity (*huò*) where constancy (*zhēn*) is tested.
# *Wéi* (位) – Position or station (here, likely referring to the *yáng* (阳) hexagram’s position in the *shàng* (上) half).
# *Zì* (豨) – A wild boar; *xǐ* (喜) suggests a joyful or aggressive stance.
# *Yǎn* (蔀) – To cover or obscure; *dū* (都) and *què* (却) are variant readings.
# *Dào* (道) – Not present in this section, but retained in prior conventions.
# *Qi* (氣) / *Dharma* (佛教) – Not present in this section, but retained in prior conventions.
# *Lì* (吏) – Officials or functionaries; *rén* (人) is a variant reading.
# *Sòng, Lù, Wáng, Fàn, Guāng* – Commentarial traditions (e.g., *Sòng* for Song dynasty scholars, *Guāng* for *Guāngyùn* 光尹).

The **Way** enters the **Array** in the fourth position, thirty-eight divisions and thirty-two seconds, the sun’s course truly sinks, and the **Summer Qi** responds.

The **Ladder** stands in the **Peril** position, the **Lü** pitch of the **Compass Bells** is central.

The **Array**, a regulated march. Though the **Yang Qi** dominates in its great activity, a subtle **Yin** rests below, the **Array** is formed yet desiring departure.

Lü says: The **Yin Qi** rests below, so the **Yang** is bound in the **Array**, its resolve set on departure.

The first day: A **Dark Array**, no visible march.
Mèng says: The **Dark Array** is unseen, the heart already straying outward.
One is the beginning of contemplation, yet it occurs in daylight.
The **Noble One**, perceiving subtleties, harbors a hidden resolve to depart, though none know it.

The second day: The **Wildfowl** are distressed upon the ice, winging toward the southern wind, inwardly cherishing their **Pairs**.
Mèng says: The **Wildfowl’s** distress is a burden of sorrow, finding no comfort.
The *Sòng* and *Lü* readings render *惨* as *掺*, but now follow the *Fàn* and *Wáng* readings.
**Pairs**, pronounced *shí-líng* or *shí-líng* (variant).
Wáng says: **Wildfowl**, meaning **Geese**. Having lost their companions, they are distressed by the cold ice, then wing toward the southern wind, inwardly cherishing their **Pairs**, sorrowful yet finding no comfort.
**Pairs** refers to the four **Geese** in flight.
Guāng says: In *Fāngyán* (Regional Speech), flying birds are called **Pairs**, **Geese** are called **Pairs**—meaning **mates** or **companions**. **Geese** flee cold and seek warmth, migrating from north to south, just as people depart from danger to seek safety. The second day is the middle of contemplation, occurring at night.
The **Lesser One**, indulging in favor and wealth, cannot avoid calamity in its subtlety, like the **Goose** that inwardly cherishes its **Pairs** yet cannot journey far.

The *Yì* (Changes) says: **Bound Retreat** brings sickness—**Peril**.

The third day: **Advancing** in resolve, or **receiving** its joy.
Mèng says: **Advancing** in resolve meets what brings comfort.
The third day is the upper stage of contemplation, occurring in daylight.
Though bound in travel, **advancing** fulfills its resolve, hence it **receives** its joy.

The fourth day: The **Black-Cock** flies at dawn, shattered in the north;
**Ming-ming** they harmonize, yet never cease their feeding.
Mèng says: What reliance can the **Black-Cock’s** dawn flight have?
The *Sòng* and *Lü* readings render *踤* as *夸*, while *Wáng* renders it as *跨*; now follow the *Fàn* reading.
**Black-Cock**, same as *鹍*, pronounced *gǔ-hún*.
**Tread**, same as *萃*, also pronounced *cí-xù*.
Wáng says: The great **Crow** flies at dawn, yet it should have sought the **Yang** for its own safety.
Instead, it reverses toward the north, losing its direction.
Though they harmonize with **ming-ming**, they never abandon their intent to feed.
Having lost its **Way**, what benefit can it find?

The fifth day: The **Great Wildfowl** is bound in **Zī** (variant: *Zhī*),
Feasting with **yí-yí** contentment.
Mèng says: The **Great Wildfowl** bound in **Zī** signifies a great commander achieving its resolve.

The sixth day: Passing through six **Crossroads**, circling nine **Paths**, yet no restraint on its **Marching Merchants**.
Mèng says: Passing through six **Crossroads** is the affair of **Merchants**.
Wáng says: Six **Crossroads**, nine **Paths**—there is no place it does not traverse.
Those who labor yet seek profit are the peculiar affairs of the **Lesser Ones**.
Guāng says: Six signifies abundance and multiplicity, occurring at night.
The **Lesser Ones** wander throughout the land, with no restraint on their movement, not for the sake of the **Way**.
Their resolve is merely to pursue profit, differing in no way from **Merchants**.

The seventh day: The **Array** lacks **Pairs**,
Profit in **Campaigning**—**Fault**.
Mèng says: The **Array** lacks **Pairs**, calamity is near.
The *Sòng*, *Lü*, and *Wáng* readings render *离* as *lì*, but now follow the *Fàn* and minor *Sòng* readings.
**Pairs**, same as *俪*, pronounced *lì*.
The eighth day: The **Late Middle** scatters its **Tracks**, weeping upon the **Path**, its journey sent forth.

Mèng says: The **Late Middle** scatters its **Tracks**, sending it to its death.
The *Fàn* and *Wáng* readings render *泣于之道* as *泣于道*; now follow the *Sòng* and *Lü* readings.

The ninth day: The **Array** is bound at **Dusk**.

The **Array** at **Dusk**—still may be avoided.

The **King** says: In the **Way** of the **Array**, one should act first.
Now occupying the extreme position, it has lost the **Way** of avoiding difficulty.
Yet, when in position at **Day**, like one preparing to avoid calamity in the murky hour,
though late, it may still be avoided.

**Guāng** says: Nine marks the end of calamity, yet it is at **Day**.
The **Noble One**, when encountering the extremity of calamity,
prepares and departs—though the time is late, it is better than lingering in ease and not leaving.

**Two Regions, One Province, Two Prefectures, Two Families, the Multitude**
**Yin-Family Earth**, following the **Master**.

Entering the Multitude, the fourth day: **Day-Rest** at *Zhuì* and *Zhì*.
The eighth day: **Day-Rest** at *Shēn*.

**Yang-qi** is indeed lofty, the **Heart** harmonized—
All things flourish and expand, the Multitude is vast.
*Shēn*, same as *shēn* (to extend).
*Mǎo*, pronounced *hù* (to adorn).
**Lü** says: *Mǎo*, beautiful appearance.

The first day: **Dark Soldiers** begin—**Fire** enters the **Ear**.
Farming ceases, the **Grain-Valley** is abandoned;
The **Corpse** will be arrayed upon the **Field**.

**Mèng** says: The beginning of **Dark Soldiers**—
At its start, it is not yet preserved.

The **King’s** text renders *毅* as *gǔ* (wheel), now following all other readings.

The **King** says: *Bān*, to deploy.

**Guāng** says: One, with its obscurity, marks the beginning of **Soldiers**—
The onset of war has already sprouted, yet it has not yet taken form, hence "the beginning of **Dark Soldiers**."
For **Soldiers** are an inauspicious instrument—
When people hear of them, they are startled and alarmed, hence "the **Fire** enters the **Ear**."
Farming halts its plowing, to provide provisions and supplies.
Feeding the **Horse** with *yì* (strength), for the **General’s** use.

The **Corpse** arrayed upon the **Field**—
This speaks of many dead.

The second hexagram:
**Soldiers** without blades,
The army without formation,
The **Lynx** comes as a guest—**gentleness**.

**Mèng** says: **Soldiers** without blades—
Their **virtue/power** subdues without measure.

The **King** renders *麟* as *lín* (neighbor), now following all other readings.
*陈* (formation) is pronounced *zhèn* (straight blade).

**Fàn** says: The **Lynx** is a beast,
With horns that do not strike.

The **King** says: The second hexagram resides in the lower body’s center,
Yet also holds the position of day.
It gains the favor of the multitude,
Thus **Soldiers** do not clash blades,
The army does not set formations,
Yet strong neighboring enemy states come as guests.

**Guāng** says: The second hexagram is the midpoint of **Thought**,
And aligns with day.
The **Noble** cultivates **virtue/power** in the heart,
And all under heaven submit in turn—
**Soldiers** have no need to strike,
Thus the army has no need of formation.
*Guests* are those who come from without.
The **Lynx** comes as a guest—
Symbolizing martial might yet unused.
*Gentleness* means no harsh coercion.

The third hexagram:
The army laden with carts,
The elder crushes his kin,
Within, he treads upon the **Flaw**.

**Mèng** says: The army laden with carts—
Temple battles, internal wounds.

The **Sòng** and **Lù** readings render *丈* as *dà* (great) and *孥* as *nú* (crossbow),
The **King** renders *摧* as *tuī* (push) and *孥* as *nú* (slave).
Now all follow **Fàn’s** readings.

The third hexagram marks the end of **Thought**.
Before battle, internal scheming has already begun.
Carts are bound and entangled,
Overturning what they bear.
The *elder* is the head of the household.
*Kin* refers to wife and children.
Planning proves as flawed as the elder’s own self-destruction.
Defeat comes not from without—
It stems from internal discord already sown,
Thus the enemy gains the advantage.

**Sūnzǐ** says: To lose before battle, in temple calculations,
Is to lack foresight.

The fourth hexagram:
The **Tiger** roars, shaking the hall,
The **Leopard** subdues its private passions—**restraint**.

**Mèng** says: The **Tiger** roars, shaking the hall,
Like an eagle taking flight.
The **King** renders *胜* as *téng* (soar), now following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** readings.
The **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** readings render *私* as *mì* (secret), now following the **King’s** reading.
*虓* is pronounced *xiāo* (angry cry).
*振廞* is pronounced *zhènyīn* (stirring).
*否* is pronounced *pǐ* (blocked).

**Fàn** says: *虓* is the sound of rage.
*Shaking the hall* depicts extreme fury.

The **King** says: Positioned among the multitude yet near the honored seat,
This is the duty of generalship.
Holding the position of day,
Skilled in leading the masses,
Like the **Tiger’s** roar, stirring and rising.
**Guāng** says: The fourth hexagram is the lower **Luck** in position—
One who wields the multitude.
The **Tiger** and **Leopard**, both symbols of martial ferocity.
Though the warrior rages like a **Tiger**,
His might is tempered like an eagle’s flight.
Yet he does not use force to settle disputes or vent anger,
Mastering his private desires,
Thus he may be used yet remains unused.
*The Law of Speech* says:
*"Asked of martial virtue, it was answered: ‘Conquest.’*
To conquer one’s private heart is called conquest."

The fifth hexagram:
**Drums** clash *jiējiē*,
Like **Bear** or **Dragon**.
**Mèng** says: **Drums** clash *jiējiē*—
Relying on strength to rule.
*躆* (drum) is the same as *踞* (sit), should read *剧* (excessive).
The fifth hexagram resides in the peak position yet aligns with night,
Relying on strength for victory—
This is insufficient to subdue all under heaven.

The sixth hexagram:
Great **Soldiers** like thunder and lightning,
Shaking the ears,
Yet bend to fill the belly—**submission**.

**Mèng** says: Great **Soldiers** like thunder and lightning—
Their awe-inspiring might knows no bounds.
The **King** renders *维* as *hòu* (await), now following all other readings.
*诎* is the same as *屈* (yield).

「Submission of the belly—
This is akin to submitting one’s heart.

The sixth hexagram reaches its greatest height while corresponding to day.
The **King’s** armies do not seek to slaughter and maim;
They merely instill dread.
Thus, like thunder and lightning,
They strike with awe-inspiring might,
Forcing hearts to submit.
The *Shijing* [Classic of Poetry] states:
*"The lands of Xu tremble in fear,
Like thunder, like lightning—
The lands of Xu tremble in fear."*

The *Baihu Tong* [White Tiger's Discourse] says:
*"War is to instill dread."*

The seventh hexagram:
**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray,
**Weapons** clash with a sinister din.
The **army** is burdened with grief,
Weeping and sighing.
**Mèng** says:
**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray—
This reflects the people’s deep resentment.
The *Fan* and *Wang* readings of *dry* (钺) as *ge* (戈) are now corrected to follow the *Song* and *Lu* readings.
*絓* (flutter) is pronounced as in *Hù* (户).
*唁* (weeping) is pronounced *Yàn* (彦).
*Sighing* is pronounced *Mòjiā* (莫佳).
**Fan** says:
*"To mourn the living is called *yàn* (唁), and to peer secretly is called *mòjiā* (窃视称 )."*
**Guang** states:
*"The seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity while corresponding to night,
A sign of the army’s defeat and ruin.
**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray,
**Weapons** clash with a sinister din—
This depicts the chaos of defeat.
The **army** represents the multitude.
When a husband dies and a wife is pregnant,
The people’s sorrow is most acute.
The multitude weeping in mourning,
Both crying and peering secretly at their rulers,
Express their resentment and hatred."*

The eighth hexagram:
The **army** grows weary,
**Victory** is seen in sickness,
Not in corpses or fallen chariots.
**Mèng** says:
*"The **army** grows weary—
This means no bloodshed is required.
*衰衰* (weary) depicts exhaustion and decline.
The eighth hexagram signifies **stagnant illness**, **consumption**, **peeling away**, and **calamity within**,
Yet corresponds to day.
It represents the ability to exhaust and weaken an enemy state,
Bending their strength without battle."*

The ninth hexagram:
**Axe-blades** are chipped,
Their handles broken—
They can halt, but cannot strike.
**Blood** is shed.
**Mèng** says:
*"Chipped blades and broken handles—
The **army** is ill-equipped to advance.
**Wang** says:
*"To advance will only bring self-inflicted bloodshed."*
**Guang** states:
*"The ninth hexagram marks the extreme of military use,
The culmination of misfortune—
Pursuing war without knowing when to stop."*"

*"Two lands, one state, two departments, three families—**sealed**,
The **Yang Family’s** water, **measured**."*

The ninth hexagram:
**Sealed** is **measured**—
The **Way** of the **Yang Family’s** water.

*"**Sealed** means **comparison** and **proximity**, as well as **completeness** and **perfection**.
**Yang qi** is close to Heaven, all things flourish and thrive—
Everything is **sealed** without gaps.
**Wang** originally wrote *caì* (咸) as *shèng* (盛), but now follows other scholars.
**Wang** says:
*'Flourish and thrive'—a description of greatness.
All things, riding the **Yang qi**, are great and perfect—
**Completeness** and **perfection** without flaw.
**Guang** states:
*'**Yang qi** ascends and is close to Heaven—
The utmost height.'*

*First line: Peering without gaps—
The gateway to great obscurity.*
**Mèng** says:
*'Peering without gaps—
**Sealed** without direction.'*
**Sòng** states:
*'All matters are **sealed**, hence the description of "without direction."'*
**Guang** says:
*'The first line marks the beginning of contemplation,
And corresponds to day.
The virtuous one focuses their mind on **sealed** matters,
To establish deeds and secure achievements—
No one can peer into their intentions.'*
The *Yì* says: *"If even minor matters are not **sealed**, then harm will arise."*#

*Second line: Neither **sealed** nor **comparison**,
Yet my heart is merely **traveling**.*
**Mèng** says:
*'Neither **sealed** nor **comparison**—
This is to stray from one’s native place.'*
**Comparison** (比) is pronounced *bǐ* (频寐切).
The virtuous one loves what is near to embrace what is distant,
While the petty one does the opposite.
The second line marks the middle of contemplation,
And corresponds to night.
Unable to embrace what is near,
Yet laboring their heart for what is distant.
**Traveling** (次) means to lodge at an inn.
To stray from one’s native place,
Yet seek to lodge at an inn—
This is abandoning what is near for what is distant.*
The *Shī* says:
*"No fields of my own, only weeds flourishing—
The distant, unthought-of, weigh heavy on my heart."*

*Third line: **Sealed** in what is close,
Beneficial for nurturing others.*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Sealed** in what is close—
This is the ultimate benefit.'*
The third line marks the upper stage of contemplation,
And corresponds to day.
The virtuous one loves their own kin,
And thus knows how to love others’ kin—
Extending their heart to include all,
Hence it is said: "Beneficial for nurturing others."*

*Fourth line: **Sealed** in what is foul and turbulent,
Three days without tasting the **soup**—*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Sealed** in what is foul and rank—
This is the passage of minor evils.'*
**Wang** says:
*'**Sealed** in what is foul and rank—
This is the **virtue/power** of embracing what is evil.'*
**Guang** states:
*'The fourth line marks external lodging and corresponds to night—
This is the one who associates with those who are not virtuous.
Associating with those who are not virtuous,
Over time, one will transform into them.
Confucius said:
*"To dwell with those who are not virtuous,
Is like entering a fishmonger’s stall—
If one stays long without noticing the stench,
They will come to regard it as their own.
Minor evils, if not removed,
Will gradually become familiar,
And one will eventually align with them.*
**Soup** (殽) is a mixture of flavors.
**Lodging** (次) means to lodge at an inn.*

*Fifth line: **Sealed** and **measured** without flaw,
In harmony with Heaven.*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Sealed** and **measured** without **altar**—
This is to merge with Heaven’s function.'*
**Crack** (罅) is pronounced *xià* (呼嫁切).
**Harmony** (嫔) is pronounced *pín* (频).
**Wang** says:
*'Residing in the center with uprightness,
Obtaining their proper position and corresponding to day.
As a wise ruler in their time,
They embrace what is truly close.
Hence it is said: "**Sealed** and **measured** without flaw"—
This means without gaps.
Thus, their achievements align with Heaven’s.'*
**Guang** states:
*'"**Sealed** and **measured** without flaw"—
The ruler and subjects, the people—
All are **sealed** in closeness,
Without any gaps.'*

*Sixth line: **Comparison** with great evil,
Perhaps it will bring added sorrow.*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Comparison** with great evil—
This is to match opposites.*
The sixth line marks the end of fortune and nearing misfortune,
Hence they **compare** with great evil,
And perhaps it will bring added sorrow.
Those not of my kind,
Their hearts must differ.
Matching with opposites,
Only invites self-inflicted burden.*
The *Yì* says: *"**Comparison** with those who are not of one’s kind."*

*Seventh line: **Sealed** with a small mouth and **gills**,
The great ruler has no successor.*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Sealed** with a small mouth and **gills**—
This is relying on the ruler’s reach.'*
**Wang** originally omitted the *wú* (无) character,
While **Xiǎo Sòng** omitted it as *qí* (其).
Now follows the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Fàn** versions.
**Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions have *féng* (逢) instead of *dá* (达),
But now follows the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Wang** versions.
**Gills** (鳃) is pronounced *sāi* (苏来切).
**Ruler** (君) means to lodge at an inn (次),*
*And the eighth line is entered.
At **16° 7'**, the **qi** of **Great Fullness** responds.*

*Those who are **close**—
This means mutual love and deep affection.
The **Yang** side embodies **ren** (仁) and love,
Perfecting **zhēn** (真) with sincerity and earnestness,
All things are **close** and harmonious.
**Yang qi** is pure and refined,
Hence it is said: "Perfecting **zhēn**."*

*First line: **Close** not to their own flesh,
Their intentions are **clashing**.*
**Mèng** says:
*'**Close** not to their own flesh—
This is a heart at ease.'*
**Wang** originally omitted the *qīn* (亲) character,
Now follows the **Èr Sòng**, **Lǚ**, **Fàn**, and **Ràng** versions.
**Wang** says:
*'At the beginning of **closeness**, yet losing their proper position and corresponding to night,
This is straying from the **Way** of **closeness**.
Not their own flesh—
This refers to those who are distant,
Not truly **close** in flesh and blood,
Yet are **close** to them—
Their intentions will **clash**,
And not align.
Their hearts are mutually guarded,
Straying from the **Way** of **closeness**.
**Guang** states:
*'The first line marks the beginning of contemplation,
And corresponds to night—
This is **closeness** that is not truly **close**.
Though outwardly **close**,
Their inner intentions do not match,
And they will ultimately separate.
**Ease** (闲) means obstruction or lack of communication.'*

*Second line: Trust within,
Their intentions are **close** to **affection**.*
**Mèng** says:
*'Trust within—
No one can intervene.'*
**Fàn** version has *ròu* (肉) instead of *nèi* (内),
And *wén* (闻) instead of *jiàn* (间);
**Wang** version has *ròu* (肉) instead of *nèi* (内),
And *xián* (闲) instead of *jiàn* (间);
Now follows the **Sòng** and **Lǚ** versions.
**Wang** says:
*'**Close** to **affection** (戚)—
This is to take (资) what is **close**.
Their intentions are solely taken from what is **close** and attached.*
**Guang** states:
*'The second line marks the middle of contemplation,
And corresponds to day.
The virtuous one embodies sincerity in deep **closeness**,
Hence it is said: "Trust within."*

Next follows the third hexagram:

**Third line:**
The silkworm moth’s offspring belong not to it,
Yet the mantis takes them—
No resistance is met.

**Mèng** says:
*The silkworm moth’s offspring belong not to it—
It has lost its own body.*

The **Wang** version reads *"no resistance is met"* as *"蠃侮"* (shāng wǔ), now following the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Fàn** versions.

**Phonetic glosses:**
*蜾* (guǒ), *蠃* (láng guǒ), *螟* (míng), *蛉* (líng), *属* (zhī yù).
*The silkworm moth* refers to the silkworm’s larvae.
*The mantis* is the *Chuánlú* insect.
*属* means "to attach."
*近侮* is akin to "warding off insult."

The third line marks the end of contemplation,
And corresponds to night.
The petty person cannot attach to their kin
To ward off external threats,
Thus causing estrangement and aligning with others.
Like the silkworm moth failing to raise its own young,
Only to have them taken by the mantis.

As the *Shī* says:
*The silkworm moth’s offspring,*
*The mantis carries them away.*
Teach your children well,
And let them emulate this.

---

**Fourth line:**
Guests are honored with propriety,
Feasts are measured and orderly.

**Mèng** says:
*Guests are honored with propriety—
Host and guest unite in harmony.*

**Wang** says:
*几几* (jī jī) means "ordered by law."

**Guang** states:
The fourth line marks flourishing clarity,
And corresponds to day.
The virtuous one uses ceremonial feasting
To foster bonds of kinship and affection.
Guests are honored not for the food,
But because propriety is observed.
Confucius said:
*"I ate at the home of Shàoshī,*
*And was filled.*
*Shàoshī fed me with propriety."*

Host and guest unite—
Both act with decorum.

---

**Fifth line:**
Generosity without substance,
Those who cling will flee.

**Mèng** says:
*Generosity without substance—
It lacks kindred and direction.*

**Wang** says:
Though the fifth line is central,
It is misplaced and corresponds to night.
When generosity should be given but is not,
Those who cling to it will abandon it.
**Guang** states:
Unable to honor those who should be honored,
Or to show generosity where it is due,
It drives away those who are near,
Leaving one isolated and perilous.
As **Zǐ Tàishū** said:
*"Jìn is no longer a neighbor—*
*Who would say otherwise?"*

---

**Sixth line:**
Generosity in generosity,
The virtuous one wields the Dipper.

**Mèng** says:
*The virtuous one’s generosity—
Boundless in gathering people.*

The sixth line marks abundance and corresponds to day,
For it honors those who should be honored
And shows generosity where it is due.
The virtuous one enriches the near and draws the distant,
Nurtures the close and attracts the distant.
Like the Dipper at the center,
With all stars revolving around it,
Thus it is said: *The virtuous one wields the Dipper.*

---

**Seventh line:**
Lofty in station, yet trivial in deeds,
Base in execution.

**Mèng** says:
*Lofty in station, base in deeds—
Virtue cannot sustain it.*

The **Sòng** and **Lǚ** versions read *"周"* (zhōu) for *"从"* (cóng),
While the **Fàn** version reads *"同"* (tóng).
Now following the **Wang** version.

*庳* (bì) is pronounced *"便是"* (biàn shì) or *"必至"* (bì zhì), also *"卑"* (bēi).

**Wang** says:
The seventh line occupies an overfull position,
Misplaced and corresponding to night,
Though its station is lofty,
Its actions are trivial and base.

---

**Eighth line:**
Dried meat clings to the bundle,
Yet the resentment has already formed—
The virtuous one departs.

**Mèng** says:
*The clinging of dried meat—
It lacks my worth.*

The **Sòng** and **Wang** versions read *"脯"* (fǔ) for *"肺"* (fèi),
*"乾"* (qián) for *"干"* (gān),
And *"往"* (wǎng) for *"行"* (xíng).
The **Wang** version reads *"腑"* (fǔ) for *"附"* (fù).
Now following the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions.

*糇* (hóu).
**Fàn** says: *"削"* (xuē) is *"肺"* (fèi).
*肺附* is like the lung clinging to wood.
**Wang** says:
Though there is the clinging of dried meat as kin,
The resentment of the bundle has already formed—
Thus the virtuous one departs.

As the *Shī* says:
*The people’s loss of virtue,*
*The bundle’s resentment grows.*

**Guang** states:
*肺附* illustrates how kin cling to their clan leader.
Though the people are humble,
They should still share the *jiān hóu* (dried meat and grain)
To aid their kin.
The clinging of dried meat is the thinnest of bonds,
Yet even this should be honored with provisions—
How much more so when the resentment is justified?
This is why **Wēizǐ** returned to **Zhōu**.

---

**Ninth line (topmost):**
Youthful kin are unfaithful.

**Mèng** says:
*Youthful kin are unfaithful—
They revert to their roots.*

**Sòng** says: *"荄"* (zhì) means *"exhausting one’s roots."*

**Wang** says:
At the extreme of kinship,
Misplaced and corresponding to night,
Like the foolish and senile,
Those they are close to will never be upright.

---
**Appendix:**
Two regions, one state, three departments, two families—
**Yáng** family, **Mù** (wood).

The **Yáng**-qi (阳气) is fully manifest in the external,
While the subtle **Yīn** (阴) is gathered inward.

**Lù** says:
*"The subtle **Yīn** is gathered inward, exhausting the roots of all things."*

**Initial One (初一):**
*Small gathering without remission,*
*Favorable for governing and stabilizing the people, rectifying the state.*
**Mèng** says:
*Small gathering without remission—*
*This is the proper **Dao/Way** (道).*
*Remission* (贷), *read as "huò"* (货, *tǔ dé* cut).

From **One** to **Three** (三),
*Subtle and yet to take root,*
*Hence all bear the image of smallness.*
**One** (初一) corresponds to the *stroke of day* (日之画),
*Where the noble one practices modest gathering with constancy,*
*Not burdening the people with remission of taxes,*
*Thus favorable for governing and stabilizing the people, rectifying the state.*
**One** (初一) also says:
*"Remission"* (贷) should be read as *"huò"* (货, *tǔ dé* cut).

**Second (次二):**
*Blackened gathering, ever so slight,*
*I am not upright.*
**Mèng** says:
*Blackened gathering, ever so slight—*
*This is not for illumination.*
*Xiao Song* (小宋) originally read *截* (jié) for *铁* (tiě), while *Wang* (王) read *寝* (qǐn).
*Now following Song, Lu, and Fan* (范), we read *铁* (tiě).
*铁* (tiě), *read as "xī lián"* (息廉).
**Fàn** (范) says:
*铁铁* (tiě tiě), *means "slight" or "small."*
*Illumination* (光) refers to:
*Blackened* (墨) means *greed* (贪).
The petty one is greedy in gathering,
Taking delight in trifling gains,
Gradually descending into what is not upright—
This is not the way to bring forth illumination and beauty.

**Third (次三):**
*Seeing smallness, do not use it,*
*With me, to nurture the sparse.*
**Mèng** says:
*Seeing smallness, do not use it,*
*Await my fullness.*
**Wáng** (王) says:
*Three* (次三) *holds its proper position at midday,*
*Fitting for the gathering of **Yīn** (阴).*
*Seeing smallness, do not use it—*
*This is because with me, the growth is flourishing,*
*Thus reaching the stage of nurturing and spreading vastness.*
*Illumination* (光) says:
*When things are yet subtle and small,*
*The noble one cultivates them,*
*Awaiting their fullness,*
*And then takes them.*

The *Rites* (礼) state:
*"Do not pluck, do not break eggs, do not kill the fetus,
Nor cut down the young—*
*Grass and trees must first wither and fall,*
*Then one may enter the mountains and forests.*
*All this is of the same intent."*

---

**Fourth (次四):**
*Gathering profit with minor punishments,*
*Small advances, great withdrawals.*
**Mèng** says:
*Gathering profit with minor punishments—*
*This is because governance is in retreat.*

*(The text of) the *Rites* (政) is established as correct,*
*Now following the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng editions.*

**Fifth (次五):**
*Store the **Yīn** (阴) and spread it forth,*
*The cocoon’s purity in the fields.*
**Mèng** says:
*Store the **Yīn** (阴) and nurture its purity—*
*This is to avoid disrupting the seasons.*

**Yīn** (阴) is *joy* (乐).
**Purity** (纯) is *beauty* (美).
Fifth (五) is the stage of the cocoon,
And it holds the position of *flourishing* (盛) while corresponding to *drawing* (画).

*(The Way) does not act in haste,*
*Life is born at its proper time,*
*Its use is measured with moderation—*
*Thus the six livestock thrive and multiply,*
*And the silkworms yield abundant beauty.*

**Sixth (次六):**
*Lamenting and extending, yet failing to heed,*
*Creating great beginnings—*
*The petty man does not guard against ruin.*
**Mèng** says:
*The warning of lamenting and extending—*
*This is because he does not recognize subtleties.*

*(The Wáng edition reads) "Lamenting and extending, yet failing to heed,"*
*Now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.*

**Lamenting** (闵) and **extending** (绵) are minor appearances.
**Beginning** (元) is *origin* (始).
Sixth (六) is in the gathering phase,
Exceeding the midpoint and corresponding to night—
*The harbinger of resentment.*

Resentment begins in small things,
Yet grows to great.
The petty man does not guard against ruin,
Thus resentment reaches him,
And he does not even realize it.

**Seventh (次七):**
*The husband is drawn to the chariot,*
*The wife becomes the stripper of **chá** (茶),*
*Profit for the king’s sisters,*
*Not for the public realm—*
*This is perilous.*

**Mèng** says:
*Drawn to the chariot, stripping **chá** (茶)—*
*These are the means of gathering profit.*

**Lù** says:
*Means* (资) *is* ***wealth** (财).

*The husband and wife gather wealth,*
*Profit for the household, not for the state.*

**Wáng** says:
*Drawn to the chariot* (牵于车) *is heavy labor with meager gain;*
*Stripping **chá** (茶)* (剥荼) *is bitter herbs with little reward.*
*It can suffice for private chambers,*
*Profit for the king’s sisters,*
*Yet is insufficient to support the public realm.*

**Light** (光) says:
*The *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) states that the sisters of the king’s father are called *king’s sisters* (王姑).*

**Eighth (次八):**
*Great gathering, great reversal.*
**Mèng** says:
*The reversal of great gathering—*
*The gathered profits are not right.*

*(The Lù, Fàn, and Wáng editions read) "reversal" (颠) as "peak" (巅),*
*Now following the two Sòng editions.*

**Wáng** says:
*Eighth (八) resides at the extreme of gathering,*
*Yet loses its proper position, corresponding to night—*
*The stage of great gathering.*
*Amidst calamity,*
*To seek great gathering,*
*One must surely face the disaster of reversal and collapse.*

**Ninth (上九):**
*Gathering at the proper time,*
*Profit in guarding against extreme calamity.*
**Mèng** says:
*Gathering at the proper time—*
*How can this be criticized?*

**Wáng** says:
*Guarding* (圉) *is the same as* ***driving/warding** (御).

**Light** (光) says:
*Ninth (九) is the stage of extreme calamity,*
*Yet corresponds to midday.*
*The noble one, in times of abundance,*
*Implements heavy gathering—*
*The people do not regard it as tyranny,*
*This is how one prepares in advance for years of famine,*
*And wards off this extreme disaster.*

*(Criticized* (几) *should be read as* ***mocked/reproached** (讥).

*Though gathering is heavy,*
*If done at the proper time,*
*There is no reproach.*

Mencius condemns:
*Dogs and pigs devouring human food yet unaware of restraint,*
*And the land having starving corpses yet unaware of relief.*
*In these two cases,*
*One state, one district, three families—*
*The **Yīn** (阴) family hoards gold,*
*Following the *Kàn* (乾) family’s measure.*

The **Yáng** (陽) *qi* is pure and rigid, **Kàn** (乾) **Kàn** (乾).
All things are strong and flourishing#20.
*(Range and Wang originally read* **chún** (純) *as* **tǒng** (統) *; now following Song and Lu’s readings.)*

**First** (初) **one** (一), *Strong within* **fǒu** (否) *is steadfast#35—*
*No use may be made of it.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*Strong within* **fǒu** (否) *is steadfast—*
*It cannot be conspired with.*
*(Fǒu, pronounced as* **fāng jiǔ** (方久) *.)*

**One** (一) *is the beginning of thought,*
*And corresponds to night.*
*Its strength is unbridled yet unaligned,*
*Hence no use may be found.*

**Second** (次) **two** (二), *The phoenix bird takes flight,*
*Polishing its plumage;*
*The noble one, at the* **chén** (辰) *hour,*
*Endures no warding.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*The phoenix bird takes flight—*
*The noble one finds the proper time.*
**Fàn** (范) says:
*Warding* (圉) *is restraint.*
**Guāng** (光) says:
*The* **chén** (辰) *hour is the time.*
**Two** (二) *is the middle of thought,*
*And corresponds to day.*
*The noble one finds the proper time,*
*Strong in righteousness,*
*None can restrain him.*
*Like the phoenix’s flight,*
*Its plumage refined and long,*
*None can control it#21.*

**All** (凡) *who are in the middle*
*Bear the likeness of finding position and time.*

**Third** (次) **three** (三), *The pillar does not align,*
*The beam does not rise,*
*The great hall is slight.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*The pillar does not align—*
*It cannot establish a firm foundation.*
**Three** (三) *resides at the head of the lower body,*
*And bears the burden above,*
*The likeness of the beam and pillar.*
*At the night of day,*
*The commoner is not strong but weak,*
*Unable to fulfill its duty.*
*If it cannot fulfill its duty,*
*Then the state’s foundation will collapse.*

**Fourth** (次) **four** (四), *Then it is wise and clear,*
*Assisted on both sides.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*Then it is wise and clear—*
*The ministers now come forward.*
*(Song, Lu, and Wang originally read* **sāo** (搔) *as* **zhuā** (橿) *; Xiao Song as* **qiáng** (强) *; now following Fan’s reading.)*
*(Wang originally read* **fāng** (方) *as* **yǒng** (永) *; now following other readings.)*
**Fàn** (范) says:
*Four* (四) *is in its course,*
*The numbers of course mutually support.*
**Xī** ( ) *is flourishing.*
**Wáng** (王) says:
*Xī* ( ) *is indeed the appearance of mutual support.*
**Wú** (吴) says:
*The character* **xī** ( ) *should be* **jiāng** (姜) *with the radical* **shǒu** (手) *; the character books have no such form, but with the radical* **mù** (木) *its sound is* **jiāng** (姜).*
*Since* **four** (四) *is metal,*
*And the metal family heads with metal,*
*It is said that the numbers of course mutually support,*
*Not taking* **qiáng** (强) *as support.*
**Guāng** (光) says:
*Four* (四) *is the likeness of unobstructed flow,*
*And corresponds to day.*
*The noble one possesses the virtue of wisdom and clarity,*
*Hence the ministers now come forward,*
*Assisting on both sides,*
*Thus making it strong.*

**Fifth** (次) **five** (五), *The noble one is strong and flourishing by virtue#22,*
*The commoner is strong and flourishing by force#23.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*The commoner is strong and flourishing#24—*
*Finding position brings even greater fault.*
**Wáng** (王) says:
*Five* (五) *resides in the ruler’s position,*
*Yet loses the proper time, corresponding to night.*
*Without the ruler’s virtue,*
*It is the commoner’s strength and flourishing#25.*
*Strong and flourishing by force#26,*
*It must bring about* **diān** (颠) *and peril.*

**Sixth** (次) **six** (六), *Conquering my strength and flourishing,*
*With Heaven, it knows no bounds#28.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*Conquering my strength and flourishing—*
*The great beauty lacks foundation.*
*(Wang originally read* **wú jī** (无基) *as* **wú jiāng** (无疆) *; now following Song, Lu, and Fan’s readings.)*
**Sòng** (宋) says:
*Without foundation—*
*It means without boundaries,*
*Speaking of vastness and remoteness.*
**Wáng** (王) says:
*Six* (六) *is strength,*
*The master of finding position, corresponding to day.*
*If it can conquer strength and flourishing,*
*And fortify its own virtue,*
*Then the ruler’s way grows ever brighter,*
*Hence reaching Heaven with no end.*
**Guāng** (光) says:
*From five onward, it is* **xiāo** (消) *;*
*Six exceeds the middle yet corresponds to day.*
*The noble one can harmonize with the times,*
*Conquering its own strength,*
*Thus attaining vast blessings,*
*And knowing no bounds with Heaven#32.*

**Seventh** (次) **seven** (七), *Metal is rigid, flesh is soft,*
*Blood flows in the fields.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*Metal is rigid, flesh is soft—*
*The law is too severe.*
*(Wang originally omitted the character* **liú** (流) *; now following other readings.)*
**Seven** (七) *is ruin and loss,*
*And corresponds to night.*
*The commoner applies the law too severely,*
*Severing soft flesh with rigid metal—*
*None can resist it.*
*Blood flows in the fields,*
*The extreme of cruelty#33.*

**Eighth** (次) **eight** (八), *Strengthen its decline,*
*Encourage its weakness.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*Strengthen its decline—*
*It strives to strengthen itself.*
**Eight** (八) *is illness and stagnation,*
*And corresponds to day.*
*The noble one can strengthen decline and encourage weakness,*
*Not sinking into ruin itself.*
**Upper nine** (上九), *Great mountain uprooted,*
*The beam and pillar broken,*
*Its person is* **diān** (颠) *and* **jué** (蹶) *.*
**Zhè** (测) says:
*The mountain uprooted, the beam broken—*
*It ends in ferocity.*
*(Wang originally read* **tài shān bá** (太山拔) *as* **dà zhī bá** (大枝拔) *; now following other readings.)*
**Wáng** (王) says:
*At the extreme of strength,*
*Yet losing position, corresponding to night,*
*It is strong yet overbearing.*
**Guāng** (光) says:
*The commoner’s strength and flourishing are excessive#33,*
*The mountain uprooted, the beam broken#34,*
*It brings about its own* **diān** (颠) *and* **jué** (蹶) *.*

**Two states, two districts, one department, one family—** *The* **yīn** (阴) *family holds water,*
*Also measured by* **Kàn** (乾).

「**睟** (Zhuàn), same as **粹** (cuì).
**Lù** (陆) says: *乾* (Kàn) is pure.
**粹** (cuì) is refined. The **yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) is **zhuàn** (袀) and **zhuàn** (睟) in purity and clarity, all things flourish in radiance, preserving their resplendent **yáng** (阳).
*(Wang originally read **zhuàn** (袀) as **chū** (初), now following other readings.)*
**袀** (zhuàn), same as **jūn** (均).
**Sòng** (宋) says: *保* (bǎo) means to secure.
At this time, the **yīn** (阴) *qi* (气) withdraws and hides below, while the **yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) is **zhuàn** (袀) and **zhuàn** (睟) in purity and clarity. Thus, all things—whether high or low—flourish in radiance, securing their vitality, and embody their **yáng** (阳) *virtue/power* (德).

**Lù** (陆) says: *袀睟* (zhuàn zhuàn), akin to *pure and refined* (纯粹).

**First line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) within, pure without blemish.
**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) within, pure without blemish.
One signifies the beginning of thought, and corresponds to day.
The virtuous person maintains purity and refinement in heart, clear and unadulterated, thus able to gather all principles and accomplish myriad tasks.

**Second line**, *dim and impure* (冥驳) *concealing* (冒) *睟* (Zhuàn), within.
**Zhè** (测) says: *冥驳冒睟* (dim and impure concealing refinement), internally flawed.
**Zhuì** (瘱), pronounced as *yú jì* (於计).
**Zhuì** (瘱), pronounced as *yú jì* (於计).
**Lù** (陆) says: *瘱* (Zhuì) means to hide.
**Fàn** (范) says: *瘱* (Zhuì) means shame.
**驳** (Bó) means impure.
**Guāng** (光) says: The second line signifies thought in its middle, yet corresponding to night.
The petty person, amidst dimness and obscurity, conceals impure and mixed thoughts—though outwardly they may deceive others, their heart remains inwardly ashamed.

**Third line**, *eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss, reverent* (恭).
**Zhè** (测) says: *目上耳下* (eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss), the peak of insight and discernment.
*(Wang originally omitted the word *恭* (reverent), now following other readings.)*
The third line signifies thought at its end, yet still corresponding to day.
The virtuous person’s thoughts, if pure and refined, attain boundless clarity—*eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss*. Though they do not rely on this, they remain solemn and vigilant, thus preserving their refinement.

**Fourth line**, petty persons *covet* (慕) *睟* (Zhuàn), yet lose their *luck and uprightness* (禄贞).
**Zhè** (测) says: Petty persons *covet* (慕) *睟* (Zhuàn), yet fail to attain it.
**Wáng** (王) says: Losing position and corresponding to night, their path is already impure.
Though they covet the pure and refined Dao, they lose their fortune, uprightness, and integrity.

**Fifth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) in the *mysterious yellow* (幽黄), *uprightness and origin* (元贞) without measure.
**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) in the *mysterious yellow* (幽黄), the true and just principle.
**Lù** (陆) says: *则* (Zé) means law.
**Wáng** (王) says: Dwelling in the center and embodying uprightness, attaining position corresponding to day, this is the master of *睟* (Zhuàn).
Pure and great virtue shining clear, *睟* (Zhuàn) in the mysterious depths, yet bearing the *yellow center’s* (黄中) harmonizing principle. The origin and uprightness are boundless, their Dao without measure, ineffable.

**Guāng** (光) says: *元* (yuán) is the longest of the good.
The fifth line signifies *central harmony* (中和), yet still corresponding to day.
The virtuous person, though hidden, does not lose the Dao of central harmony—thus they are refined. Guarding their origin and uprightness, they respond to all tasks without fail.
Like the earth’s virtue, it too completes all things through mysterious yellow, origin, and uprightness.

**Sixth line**, *great* (大) *睟* (Zhuàn) *bears* (承) *faults* (愆), *perilous* (易).
**Zhè** (测) says: *大睟承愆* (great refinement bears faults), the petty person cannot preserve it.
*(Wang originally read: Great refinement bears faults, the petty person cannot preserve it. Zhè says: The Dao of great refinement, the petty person cannot preserve it. Now following other readings.)*
**Wáng** (王) says: The sixth line dwells in a position of excess, the greatest of *睟* (Zhuàn); yet losing position and corresponding to night, thus bearing faults.
**Guāng** (光) says: Lines five and above are *dissolving* (消), the sixth exceeds the center and corresponds to night, unable to preserve its purity and refinement.
For even white jade is prone to flaws, and clear water easily stained—thus, the great refinement is not what petty persons can fully preserve; they must inevitably bear faults and errors.

**Seventh line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *at dawn* (辰) *bears faults* (愆), the virtuous person *mends faults* (补愆).
**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) *at dawn* (辰) *bears faults* (愆), skilled at mending errors.
**Wáng** (王) says: The seventh line dwells at the beginning of misfortune, the fault of the *睟* (Zhuàn) *time*. Yet with position attained and corresponding to day, they do not lose the virtue of the noble, thus able to mend faults without blame.
**Guāng** (光) says: Faults in time, only the virtuous can mend them to complete their refinement.
The *Shī* (《诗》) says: *The grand robes have gaps, only Zhòngshānfǔ* (仲山甫) *mends them.*

**Eighth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *in evil, without good.*
**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) *in evil, without good*, ultimately unassailable.
**Wáng** (王) says: Losing position and corresponding to night, pure in evil virtue, then good has no way to enter.
**Guāng** (光) says: The eighth line is *rapidly stagnant* (疾瘀) and corresponds to night—those entirely pure in evil, how can they be aided?

**Upper ninth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *at its end, ever as the beginning* (永初), upright.
**Zhè** (测) says: The uprightness of *睟* (Zhuàn) *at its end*, truly praiseworthy.
**Wáng** (王) says: The ninth line dwells at the extreme of the hexagram, yet attains position corresponding to day—this is the ability to preserve its purity and refinement, never losing the uprightness of the beginning.
**Guāng** (光) says: The ninth line is the peak of refinement, able to be cautious at the end as at the beginning, fully preserving its purity and uprightness.

**Two states, two districts, one department, two families flourish—**
*The* **yīn** (阴) *family holds fire,*
*Also measured by* **Dàyǒu** (大有).

---

**Entering the state of flourishing, second in sequence**—the thirty-third division, thirty seconds, corresponds to the day of *Chúnshǒu* (Blind Pheasant), aligning with the *qi* of *Mángzhǒng* (Grain in Beard).

The Dipper stands at the noon position, and the musical pitch is *Ruìbīn* (Reui-pin).
**Yang-qi** (Yang *qi*) ascends in overwhelming abundance, filling all things with its fullness, as if they were entirely satisfied.

**The original character *窴* (Yuàn) is pronounced *tián* (like "field").** The *Sòng* (Song) commentary states: *窴然* (Yuànrán), "fullness." On the first line: *Flourishing yet not silent* (盛不墨), *loses the virtue of darkness* (失冥德).
**Zhè** (测) says: *Flourishing yet not silent* means the center does not restrain itself.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* (Lu) texts originally read *终* (Zhōng, "end") instead of *中* (Zhōng, "center"), but now follow the *Fàn* (Fan) and *Wáng* (Wang) readings. *Lù* says: *克* (Kè), "to overcome." Unable to overcome its own desires.
**Wáng** says: The first line, dwelling at the onset of flourishing yet corresponding to night—*flourishing yet unable to silence itself*, a state that loses its virtue of darkness.
Thus, *it forfeits the virtue of its hidden and profound nature*.
**Guāng** (光) says: *Mò* (墨), "law/measure." In the *Way* of flourishing, the difficulty is not achieving it, but *how to dwell within it*. The first line is *contemplating the beginning* (思始), yet it corresponds to night. *Flourishing without law to restrain itself*, it thus *loses its virtue of concealment and subtlety*.

**Second in sequence**—*not leaning on its own power* (作不恃), *overcoming Great Possession* (克大有).
**Zhè** says: *Not leaning on its own power*, *it aligns with the virtue of the Mysterious* (称玄德).
**Wáng** says: Dwelling in the time of flourishing, yet attaining the position of *drawing* (画)—*clear in the natural Way*, it has the *function of action* (作为之功), yet does not *rely on that function*. Thus, it can reach *Great Possession*.
**Guāng** says: The second line is *contemplating the center* (思中), yet corresponding to day. *Acting yet not relying*, *doing yet not possessing*. *It is only because it does not possess* that it can achieve *Great Possession*.
(*Chēng* (称), "fit/appropriate.")

**Third in sequence**—*embracing profit, its chest full of satisfaction* (怀利满匈), *not beneficial for the public* (不利于公).
**Zhè** says: *Embracing profit, its chest full of satisfaction*, *it does not favor private interests*. The third line is *contemplating the upper* (思上), yet corresponding to night. The *gentleman* (君子) is guided by *righteousness* (义), while the *petty man* (小人) is guided by *profit* (利). The petty man, in seeking flourishing, only *pursues profit* (营利). Thus, it is said: *embracing profit, its chest full of satisfaction*. *Profit for the private* (利於私), *this is harm for the public* (斯害於公).

**Fourth in sequence**—*small flourishing, subject to subjects* (小盛臣臣), *the gateway to great flourishing* (大人之门).
**Zhè** says: *Small flourishing, subject to subjects*, *it serves the virtuous and wise* (事仁贤).
(*The original text reads "人" (rén, "person"), but follows the Sòng, Lù readings.* The fourth line is the *beginning of prosperity* (福始), hence *small flourishing*. *臣臣* (Chénchén), *a state of self-humility and lowliness*. In the initial phase of small flourishing, the gentleman can *humble himself* (自卑贱), *attending to the virtuous and wise* (承事仁贤), thus *leading to great flourishing*. For those who become *great persons* (大人), there is none who does not emerge through this *Way*, hence it is called *the gateway to great flourishing*.

**Fifth in sequence**—*what prosperity fills the shoulders* (何福满肩), *lifting calamity, swaying and swaying* (提祸挥挥).
**Zhè** says: *What prosperity lifts calamity*, *this is the petty man’s Way*.
(*The Sòng text originally reads *掸掸* (Shànshàn), but now follows the Fàn, Wáng readings.* *何* (Hé), pronounced *húkě* (like "how").
**Wáng** says: *掸* (Shàn), pronounced *chán* (like "entangling"), *its meaning taken from the image of entanglement that does not depart*. (*Chén* notes: *掸*#35, pronounced *dān* (like "red"), also *túdān*#36.) The fifth line dwells at the *peak of flourishing* (盛位), hence it is said: *what prosperity*. *Prosperity reaching its peak* (福至盛), hence *fills the shoulders*. *Extreme flourishing must reverse* (极盛必反), hence *lifting calamity*. **Guāng** says: All praises corresponding to night are the *Way of petty men*. *For petty men to enjoy great prosperity*, calamity must follow, hence: *what prosperity fills the shoulders, lifting calamity, swaying and swaying*.

**Sixth in sequence**—*the light bestowed by Heaven* (天赐之光), *the mighty strength of great opening* (大开之强), *for At-Qian there is joy* (于谦有庆).
**Zhè** says: *The light bestowed by Heaven*, *the humility of Great Possession* (谦大有).
(*The Fàn and Wáng texts originally read *赐* (Cì, "bestow"), but now follow the Sòng, Lù readings.* The sixth line is *flourishing to its greatest extent* (盛多极大), yet corresponding to day. The gentleman *receives Heaven’s bright command* (受天明命), *greatly opening the upper realm* (大启上宇). *Extreme flourishing is difficult to dwell within*, hence *humility* (谦) must be used, *then there is joy*.

**Seventh in sequence**—*riding the fire, cold springs arrive* (乘火寒泉至).
**Zhè** says: *Riding the fire, cold springs arrive*, *calamity does not ensue*.
(*The Fàn text originally reads: *riding the fire, springs arrive*, *calamity does not approach*. Now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.*)
**Wáng** says: In the time of flourishing, the seventh line *dwells beyond fullness*, yet also shares the *fire number* (火数) with the original stem. The *overwhelming force of two fires* (二火之盛), *ascending fiercely* (炎炎上干), is *detested by the sixth line*, hence *cold springs are about to arrive*, with the *fear of being extinguished*.
**Guāng** says: The seventh line is the *beginning of calamity* (祸始), yet corresponding to night. *Riding the fire* is the *peak of flourishing*. *Cold springs arriving* means *extinction is imminent*.

**Eighth in sequence**—*drawing from the full brilliance* (挹于满荧), *nearing the danger of later collapse* (几后之倾).
**Zhè** says: *Drawing from the full brilliance*, *it is nearly unavoidable*.
(*The Sòng and Lù texts originally read *拘* (Jū, "restrain"), but now follow the Fàn and Wáng readings. The Wáng text originally lacked the *荧* (Yíng) character, now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings. The Fàn text originally read *几危也* (Jīwēi yě, "nearing peril"), now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.* *几* (Jī), pronounced *jī* (like "machine") or *qí* (like "border").
**Wáng** says: *Attaining the position of day*, *skilled in dwelling within flourishing and fullness* (善於处盛满), yet able to *draw from the fullness*—*it nears the danger of later collapse, yet does not collapse*, *for it avoids ruin through humility and restraint*. Dwelling at the *peak of flourishing*, *without the Way of drawing from fullness*, *it is nearly unavoidable*.

**Ninth line, uppermost**—*extreme flourishing cannot be saved* (极盛不救), *calamity descends from Heaven* (祸降自天).
**Zhè** says: *Extreme flourishing cannot be saved*, *Heaven’s Way reverses*.
The ninth line dwells at *the extreme of flourishing* (盛极), *the day’s night*—*the end of calamity’s course* (逢祸之穷), *a state where extreme flourishing must decline*.

---
**Two states, two districts, one department, three families dwell**
**The Yang family holds wood** (阳家木),
**Measured by *Jiārén* (Family of Man)** (准家人).

**The Yang state, vigorous and resplendent** (阳方躆肤赫赫),
*is the fortress and ramparts of all things* (为物城郭),
*all things thrive within it* (万物咸度).
(*The Fàn text originally reads *万物咸得度* (wànwù xián dédù, "all things attain thriving"), now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.*)
(*Lù* says: *Lù* (躆), "the appearance of fullness and vigor." The Yang state *is the fortress and ramparts*, *all things dwell within it*, hence: *all things thrive*. **Wáng** says: *Fortress and ramparts* (城郭) are *external symbols*. **Guāng** says: *Fú* (肤) should also be read as *Lù* (躆).)
(*Lù* (躆), *Lù* (躆), *a form of vigorous and forceful movement* (动作强梁貌).)

**The Yang state, which shelters all things**, is said to nurture and defend them,
*so that the Yin qi does not harm them*.
**Thrive (度)**, should be read as **attain (得)**.
**#38 (躆躆)**, an ancient form of *residence (宅)*.
**Residence (宅)**, means *dwelling (居)*.

**First (初一)**, neither praise nor blame,
*successfully upholding one’s own family*.
**#39 (测)** states: *Neither praise nor blame*—
*this is the constant Dao*.
**One (一)** is the lowest rank of dwelling in a family,
*the symbol of descendants*,
*and corresponds to the day’s brightness (昼)*.
**To uphold the constant Dao**,
*without blame or praise*,
*is the master of preserving the family*.

**Second (次二)**, the family lacks a *vessel (壶)*,
*the wife serves her mother-in-law*,
*or washes and anoints her*.
**#39 (测)** states: *The family lacks a vessel*—
*there is no means to pass it on*.
*The vessel*—
*that which receives from above to nourish below*.
**If the family lacks a vessel**, then the lower does not provide sustenance.
**Two (二)** is the middle rank of the lower body,
*the symbol of the wife*.
*The wife*—
*that which receives from the mother-in-law*.
**Now instead, the mother-in-law serves her**,
*washing and anointing her*,
*and bearing the laborious and humiliating tasks*,
*thus disrupting order above and below*—
*no greater inversion exists*.

**Third (次三)**, the order of elders and juniors is established,
*the son assists his father*.
**#39 (测)** states: *The son assists his father*—
*thus he can prosper*.
*The Fàn text originally reads* **long and young sequence (长幼序序)**,
*now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings*.
**Wáng** states: *When one attains position, it is the day’s brightness*—
*thus, the dwelling has proper ranks*,
*elders and juniors each hold their place*,
*and the son can undertake his father’s affairs*.
**Guāng** states: *Three (三)* is the upper rank of the lower body,
*and corresponds to the day’s brightness*.
*The young can serve the old*,
*and the son can fulfill his father’s duties*.

**Fourth (次四)**, seeing a *wild boar (豕)* in the hall,
*the dog bounds it repeatedly (击之迒)*.
**#39 (测)** states: *Seeing a wild boar in the hall*—
*its form is not auspicious*.
**Derè (迒)**, pronounced *gāng*, also *hù-láng* (户郎).
**System (系)**, is the same as *tie (系)*.
**Derè (迒)**, *the tracks of a beast*.
*The dog and the wild boar*—
*both are unclean things*.
*The hall*—
*the place of the honored*.
**Four (四)** is the middle rank of the lower body,
*and yet it corresponds to the night*—
*a small person’s Dao*.
**The proper Dao for a family**,
*is to rectify oneself*,
*and then one can govern the family*.
**Now, four (四)** is in the hall,
*its own wild boar conduct present*,
*then those below will also act like dogs*,
*bounding forward in its tracks*—
*it cannot be restrained*.
**Auspicious (庆)**, means *good (善)*.

**Fifth (次五)**, the *stern and prow of vessels (舳舻)* are harmonized and settled,
*benefiting wealth and propriety*.
**#39 (测)** states: *The stern and prow are harmonized*—
*it follows its boundaries*.
**Zhú (舳)**, *straight-six* (直六).
**Lú (舻)**, *fall-Hu* (落胡).
**Wáng** states: *It does not lose its dwelling*—
*and yet nothing is too distant to reach*—
*the meaning of being on a vessel*.
**Five (五)**, having attained its proper position in the day’s brightness,
*is the master of the dwelling*—
*one who, when departing, will surely succeed*.
**Thus, the stern and prow are harmonized and settled**,
*and there is benefit in wealth and propriety*—
*does it not uphold the Dao of the dwelling?*
**Guāng** states: *Zhú (舳)*—
*the rear of a boat where the steering oar is placed*;
**Lú (舻)**—
*the front of a boat where the paddle is fixed*.
*Five (五)* is in the highest rank of dwelling,
*and corresponds to the day’s brightness*—
*a junzi who can govern his family*.
**If the stern and prow are harmonized and settled**,
*then the multitude relies on it for tranquility*;
**If superiors and inferiors are in accord**,
*then the family relies on it for governance*.
*Wealth*—
*the blessing of the family*.
*Wealth that does not lose its rectitude*—
*this is what makes it beautiful*.
**Its (其)**, should be read as **none (无)**.

**Sixth (次六)**, its *well and hearth (井灶)* are cast outside,
*three years and it sees betrayal*.
**#39 (测)** states: *Its well and hearth are cast outside*—
*three years and it does not enjoy (sustenance)*.
**Wáng** states: *Three years*—
*the end of a numerical cycle*.
**Guāng** states: *The well and hearth*—
*the resources for drink and food*,
*the essential duties of the family*.
**If they are cast outside**, then how can the family sustain itself?
**Six (六)** is beyond the middle and corresponds to the night—
*a small person who cannot harmonize his clan*,
*and instead drives them away*—
*not exceeding three years before kin all rebel*.
**Not enjoy (不享)**—
*not obtaining drink and food*.

**Seventh (次七)**, the *aged father harnesses the cart (老父擐车)*,
*the young maiden lifts the vessel (少女提壶)*,
*benefiting the father and the family*.
**#39 (测)** states: *The aged father harnesses the cart*—
*its form is now solemn*.
*The Wáng text reads* **consider (考)** as *at (于)*,
*now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings*.
**Propose (拟)**, pronounced *huàn*.
**Harness (擐)**, means *pierce (贯)*.
*Piercing the cart’s pole with his hand to move it*—
*this is how things are carried*.
*Lifting the vessel*—
*receiving from above to nourish below*.
**Consider (考)**, means *complete (成)*.
**Seven (七)** is the upper rank of the dwelling,
*the symbol of the honored and lowly*.
*The aged father*—
*the most honored in the family*.
*The young maiden*—
*the most lowly in the family*.
*The honored can bear the multitude*,
*the lowly can receive from above*—
**thus it benefits in completing the family**.
*To govern the family*—
*one cannot do so without solemnity*—
**thus its form is solemn and majestic**,
*and only then can it bear the multitude*.
*The **Yì** states: *The Family of Man, resounding and bright*—
*regret, peril, and auspice*.
*The wife and children, laughing and cheerful*—
*end in sorrow*.
**Propose (拟)**—

**Eighth (次八)**, its *table (几)* is overturned,
*its legs doubled (朼)*,
*and its family does not prosper*.
**#39 (测)** states: *Its table overturned, its legs doubled*—
*the family’s affairs are not flourishing*.
*The Sòng and Lù readings* both have *female (牝)* for *leg (朼)*,
*Wáng has male (牡)*,
*now follows the Fàn reading*.
*The family*—
*Sòng and Lù read* **nine families (九家)**,
*Fàn and Xiǎo Sòng read* **table family (几家)**.
*According to the text*—
*ancient* **its (其)** *was written as* **not (丌)**,
*thus the error arose*.
*Now follows the Wáng reading*.

「**Legs (朼)** are the same as *bì* (匕).
When the *table (几)* must bear above, *bì* must be single—this is the natural order.
Eight is the midpoint of calamity and belongs to night; to overturn its *table* means the young do not uphold the old, and the superior finds no rest.

To double its *bì* is for the family not to be governed by its elders, while those who wield authority multiply.
**Edible (旨)** means *good*.
When the young fail to uphold the old and the elders do not govern the lowly, the family’s Dao is in ruin—thus it is not good.

**Upper Nine (上九)**, a stump sprouts suckers—its lineage does not perish.
*The divination states*: A stump sprouts suckers—its kind thrives.
*Sucker (蘖)*—read as *yúlìè* or *wǔgé*.
*Lineage (种)*—read as *zhāngyǒng*.
Wáng says: Nine resides in excess, a symbol of withered decay, yet it holds its proper position by day—thus it is a stump that sprouts suckers.
Guāng says: When wood is cut and regrows, it is called a sucker. #43
Nine marks the extreme of calamity—the family is already extinct.
Yet it falls upon the day’s night, meaning there remains a remnant lineage, capable of reviving the family.

**Two Regions, Two Prefectures, Two Departments, One Family Law**
The Yin family’s metal aligns with *Jǐng* (井).
To change a city but not its well—no loss, no gain—symbolizing orderly movement between wells by law.
In Yáng Gāo County, its laws are upheld; all things emulate its standards, none failing to conform.
*County (县)*—pronounced *xuán*.
Sòng says: *Mò (墨)* refers to the measuring lines of law.
Guāng says: At this time, the Yang qi reaches its peak, and all things mirror it, none escaping its governance.

**First (初一)**, establishing law without law.
*The divination states*: Establishing law without law—it is insufficient.
Wáng says: At the outset of making law, yet it fails its proper position by night—unworthy of emulation.
Guāng says: One signifies the beginning of thought, hence *establishing law*.
*The Law of Speech (法言)* says: *Mó* not modeling, *fàn* not ranging—how much harm has been done!

**Second (次二)**, modeling law with moderation—successful.
*The divination states*: Modeling law with moderation—what all share.
*Modeling (摹)* is the same as *mó*.
*Modeling* is like *making*.
Two signifies central thought, yet it falls by day.
To make law with moderation is only then effective.
*The Great Plan (洪范)*: The Royal Extremity—what all follow.

**Third (次三)**, the plumb-line fails to be upright—losing its compass and square.
*The divination states*: The plumb-line fails to be upright—its use is flawed.
*Pǔ (甫)* means *good*.
*Shuǎng (爽)* means *erroneous*.
If one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others?

**Fourth (次四)**, the plumb-line and square—none dare defy my implementation.
*The divination states*: The plumb-line and square—this is personal conduct.
The gentleman first cultivates himself.
When his conduct is upright, orders need not be given for them to follow.

**Fifth (次五)**, deceptive and deceptive—jar with a hollow belly, well overflowing—yet none may drink.
*The divination states*: Jar with a hollow belly—this is not the Way of learning.
Sòng and Lù originally read *bīn* as *míng*; now follows the Fàn and Wáng reading.
*Plait (繘)*—pronounced *jú*.
*Hollow (窴)*—pronounced *tián*.
*Overflowing (潢)*—pronounced *huáng*.
Lù says: *Fāng (方)* means *Dao*.
Wáng says: A jar with a hollow belly cannot hold.
A well overflowing—this is the appearance of excess water.
Yet none may drink—this is because the method of drawing is wrong.
Guāng says: *Plait (繘)* is the rope for drawing.
*Deceptive and deceptive (谲陆陆)*—the sound of the rope descending.
If the jar’s belly fills first, water cannot enter.
Though the well overflows, none may drink.
The scholar who is empty receives others gladly.
Fifth resides at the well’s peak yet falls upon the night—petty men grow proud and full, unable to accept others.

**Sixth (次六)**, at the threads and the cords—demonstrate the pure radiance.
*The divination states*: At the threads and the cords—the great governance is clear.
Wáng says: To demonstrate the Dao of upright radiance, so that none are confused.
Guāng says: Six resides in the upper blessing, applying its law—able to govern the threads and cords of the world, demonstrating the pure radiance to others.

**Seventh (次七)**, a dense net cast into the abyss—unfavorable to scales.
*The divination states*: A dense net cast into the abyss—tyrannical laws are spread.
Wáng says: Seven resides in excess, yet falls by night.
To make laws too dense, nets hanging in the depths—fish cannot rest, laws applied to the state—people find no ease.
Guāng says: Seven is both *net* and *ruin*—falling upon the night’s day, laws are harsh and the people are terrified.
Thus it is said: A dense net cast into the abyss—unfavorable to scales.

**Eighth (次八)**, rectify the guilty—drive them to righteousness.
*The divination states*: Rectify the guilty—drive them onward.
*Drive (驱)* is the same as *lí*.
Sòng says: Drive the people to righteousness.
Wáng says: Eight resides in the upper body’s center, yet falls by day.
Able to apply its law, rectifying the guilty to bring none to wickedness.
Guāng says: *Gé (格)* means *to reach*.
To rectify the guilty and reach the wicked—this is the excellence of punishment.
Shùn says: Punishment aims at no punishment.

**Upper Nine (上九)**, the well lacks its rim—water flows straight—neither ravine nor valley—ending in transgression.
*The divination states*: The well lacks its rim—law is wantonly indulged.
Wáng’s reading of *fěixī fěigǔ* as *lìxīn fěixī*—now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn reading.
*Rim (干)*—pronounced *hán*.
Fàn says: The rim checks and supports the well; drainage has its time.
Wáng says: At the extreme of law yet falling by night—this is lawlessness.
A state without law—people easily transgress.
A well without its rim—water overflows.
Guāng says: Nine marks the extreme of calamity, yet falls by night.
Law is wantonly indulged without restraint—equivalent to lawlessness.
The people’s will is confused, knowing not what to follow, thus they transgress and end in chaos.
Like a well without its rim, water flows straight—neither ravine nor valley—yet pours recklessly, ending in error.

**Two Regions, Two Prefectures, Two Departments, Two Family Laws**
The Yang family’s earth aligns with *Xián* (咸).*

The **Sixth Entry** follows in sequence, marking **eighteen divisions and five seconds**, corresponding to the **Summer Solstice qi**. Hence, it aligns with *Lí* (離).

When **Yang qi** reaches its peak above, **Yin’s omens** begin to stir below—**above and below resonate in harmony**.
*"Omens"* (信) are akin to **auspicious signs**.

On the **first day**, the **Six Stems** align as *Luó* (羅), the **Five Branches** as *Lí* (離).
The **Divination** states: *"Six Stems as Luó"*—**clinging to the Lord of Lí**.

On the **second day**, above follows the **Lunar Stations** (歷), below harmonizes with the **Lü** (律).
If misaligned, it is **not so**.
The **Divination** states: *"Above follows the Stations, below harmonizes with the Lü*—**this is not genuine**."
Fàn’s original text reads *"kěn"* (肯), now following the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.
*"Harmonize"* (和) is pronounced *húwò* (胡卧).
*"Stations"* (歷) refers to the **Twelve Celestial Stems** (十二辰).
*"Lü"* (律) refers to the **Twelve Pitch Pipes** (十二管).
The **Celestial Stem** establishes the **Twelve Stems** above, while the **Lü** arranges the **Twelve Pipes** below—**above and below resonate in harmony**.
If they do not align, there is **no resonance**.

On the **third day**, **one vertical and one horizontal**—**the Celestial Net** (天網) is woven.
The **Divination** states: *"One vertical and one horizontal"*—**the warp and weft are arrayed**.
*"Vertical"* (从) is pronounced *róng* (容切).
*"Arrayed"* (，陈) is pronounced *lángwú* (郎吴) or *lángyán* (郎岩).
Fàn says: *"Arrayed"*—**a vast and expansive appearance**.

The King says: **"The Celestial Net"** (天網) embodies the meaning of **being sparse yet not leaking**.

**Master Guang** states: The **third day** (三) corresponds to **Thought** (思) above, and **daytime** (昼) is when. The **virtuous person** (君子) can **weave the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth** (经纬天地).

**Li** (离) signifies **cultural refinement** (文明), and also bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象).

On the **fourth day** (四), **"I lift my nets and traps"** (援我罘罟), **"entangling snares spread across the fields"** (絓罗于野至). The **Divination** states: **"Lifting nets and traps"** (援次罘罟) is **unable to act with benevolence** (不能以仁). **"Lift"** (援) is pronounced *yuán* (爰切). **"Net"** (罘) is pronounced *fú* (浮切). **"Entangling"** (絓) is pronounced *húguà* (胡卦切). The **fourth day** (四) marks when **yang-qi** (陽氣) is about to **extinguish** (熄), while **yin-qi** (陰氣) is about to **arise** (生); **virtue** (德) departs and **punishment** (刑) arrives. Again, **Li** (离) bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象), hence the saying **"I lift my nets and traps"** (援我罘罟), **"entangling snares spread across the fields"** (絓罗于野). **"Arrive"** (至) speaks of matters **drawing near**, as in the saying **"treading frost"** (履霜), **"solid ice arrives"** (坚冰至).

On the **fifth day** (五), **"the dragon soars in Heaven"** (龙翰于天), **"its scales tremble with solemnity"** (贞栗其鳞). The **Divination** states: **"The dragon’s trembling"** (龙翰之栗) signifies **uttermost fear of collapse** (极惧坠). **"Soar"** (翰) is pronounced *huán’ān* (胡安切). The King says: **Residing in the center** (居中) and **embodying rectitude** (体正), **obtaining its proper position** (得位) and **marking the time for response** (当画), it is the **master of correspondence** (应之主), hence the **symbol of the dragon flying in Heaven** (龙飞于天). **Master Guang** states: **The dragon** (龙) is used to **discuss yang** (论阳). **"Soar"** (翰) means **to fly** (飞). The **fifth day** (五) is **pure yang** (纯阳), the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), hence the saying **"the dragon soars in Heaven"** (龙翰于天). When the **virtuous person** (君子) stands at the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), he **must not fail to be upright** (不可不正) and **must not fail to be solemn** (不可不惧), hence the saying **"its scales tremble with solemnity"** (贞栗其鳞).

On the **sixth day** (六), **"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven"** (炽承于天), **"the ice begins to sprout from Earth"** (冰萌于地). The **Divination** states: **"Ascending Heaven, sprouting from Earth"** (承天萌地) signifies **the beginning of yang’s retreat** (阳始退). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **"blazing yang"** (炽承) as **"ascending yang"** (烝云), where **"ascending"** (烝) is the ancient form of **"blazing"** (炽), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **"Blazing"** (炽) is the **peak of yang** (陽之盛). **"Ice"** (冰) is the **ultimate of yin** (陰之极). The **sixth day** (六) falls at the **start of the Summer Solstice** (夏至之初), the **juncture of yang’s peak and yin’s rise** (陽极陰生之际); **the Way of the petty man grows long** (小人道长), while **the Way of the virtuous person diminishes** (君子道消), hence the saying: **"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven"** (炽承于天), **"the ice begins to sprout from Earth"** (冰萌于地). **The subtle warnings of reverence and caution** (敬戒之微) are fully contained here.

On the **seventh day** (七), **"the sun strengthens its decline"** (日强其衰), **"response flourishes with solemnity"** (应蕃贞). The **Divination** states: **"Strengthening its decline"** (自强其衰) is **to hate the proliferation of ruinous influences** (恶败类). **"Hate"** (恶) is pronounced *wùgù* (乌故切). The **seventh day** (七) marks the **beginning of calamity** (祸始) and **the time for response** (当画). The **virtuous person**, if he **can strengthen his declining Way** (能自强其衰), will **find many responding to him** (则应之者蕃多) and **will not lose his rectitude** (而不失其正).

On the **eighth day** (八), **"at the peak of yang, summoning yin"** (极阳征阴), **"response follows without delay"** (不移日而应). The **Divination** states: **"At the peak of yang, summoning yin"** (极阳征阴) is **the response to its manifestation** (应其发). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **"summoning"** (征) as **"subtle"** (微), and **"response"** (应) as **"time"** (时), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **When governance reaches its peak, disorder is summoned** (治极召乱), **when greatness reaches its peak, decline is summoned** (盛极召衰), **when fortune reaches its peak, calamity is summoned** (福极召祸), hence the response **without delay** (不移日而应).

On the **ninth day** (上九), **"at the ultimate of Li"** (元离之极), **the virtuous person responds with the Great Millet** (君子应以大稷). The **Divination** states: **"At the ultimate of Li"** (元离之极) is **unable to be restrained** (不可遏). **Fàn’s reading** (范本作) takes it as **"unable to be restrained"** (不可遏), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings** (今从宋、陆、王本). **Master Lù** (陆) says: **"Restrained"** (遏) means **to stop** (止). The **King** (王) says: **"Great"** (大) signifies **the sun approaching its setting** (日将暮). **Master Wú** (吴) says: **"Millet"** (稷) is pronounced and shares meaning with **"Wu"** (吴). **Master Guang** (光) states: **"Li"** (元离) is **Great Clarity** (大明). At the **ultimate of Great Clarity** (大明之极), **greatness at its peak must decline** (极盛必衰). The **virtuous person responds to the times** (君子应时), **aligning with their waxing and waning** (与之消息), hence the saying **"the virtuous person responds with the Great Wu"** (君子应以大吴).

**Collected Commentary on the *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经) Scroll Four: Two Directions, Two States, Two Divisions, Three Families in Welcome**

**Collected Commentary on the *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经) Scroll Four: Two Directions, Two States, Two Divisions, Three Families in Welcome**

---

**The Yin Family: Water, Aligned with *Xián* (咸)**
Water of the Yin Family is also aligned with *Xián*.
When welcoming in the second position, it is the day of *Shèyú Guǐ* (舍舆鬼).
Yin *qi* takes form below, and all things ascend to meet it.
*Sù* (溯), pronounced *sù*, as in *sù* (素).
Song [Commentary] says: *Sù* means "to turn toward."

**First Position:**
When welcoming others without proper response—no proper omen, only evil.
Cè [Commentary] says: Welcoming others without proper response means it is not something to be joined with.
Wang [Commentary] says: At the beginning of welcoming, if one loses proper position at night, welcoming without the correct method.
When things are not as they should be, and one responds by welcoming them, one loses the proper path and falls into evil.
Guāng [Commentary] says: Welcoming aligns with *Xián*.
*Xián* means "to be moved by."
The first position is the beginning of thought, corresponding to night—being moved by external things that are not proper responses.

**Second Position:**
The *jiāo* (蛟) hides in the depths, and the *líng* (陵) transforms its eggs.
People may speak in secret, and the common folk agree with it.
Cè says: The transformation of the hidden *jiāo* is the manifestation of sincere intent.
The *Wángběn* sometimes reads *yǒu* (有), while the *Xiǎo Sòngběn* sometimes reads *rén yīnyán* (人言或阴) or *rényán yīn* (人言或阴); now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.
*Hé* (和), pronounced *wò* (胡卧切).
Fàn [Commentary] says: The *jiāo* hides in the water, lays eggs on high banks, then returns to the depths—*qi* responds and interacts, and only then does it split and transform.
Guāng says: The second position is the middle of thought, corresponding to day.
When a sage’s sincerity reaches its peak, nothing remains impenetrable.
The *Yì* says: *"The cuckoo cries in the Yin, and its young respond in harmony."*

**Third Position:**
The subtle and refined *qi* moves back and forth; omens and spirits are aware first.
Cè says: The movement of subtle *qi* is an omen of misfortune.
The third position is the end of thought, corresponding to night.
At the juncture of heaven and humanity, when *qi* and omens interact, if humans stray from the Dao, omens and spirits become aware first.

**Fourth Position:**
The lower garment has a child’s clothing, men’s eyes are like pearls, women sneeze with hooked breath—auspicious.
Cè says: The lower garment having a child’s clothing is the Yin responding to the Yang.
The *Wángběn* reads *shèng* (盛) for *gǎn* (感); now following the other editions.
*Rú* (襦), pronounced *rú* (儒), meaning short clothing.
*Hàn* (啑), pronounced *jiǎ* (色甲切). The *Wú* edition reads *tì* (嚏), pronounced *dì* (帝).
**Fifth Position:**
Yellow rides on *Pǐ* (否)—auspicious.
Cè says: Yellow riding on *Pǐ* is not to be partnered with.
*Pǐ* (乘), pronounced *shí* (时证切).
Wang says: Though the fifth position is central, it is in the Yin at night, improper and riding on the middle position—thus, "Yellow rides on *Pǐ*, auspicious."
Guāng says: Improper in position, insufficient for union.

**Sixth Position:**
The Dark and Yellow meet in welcoming; their intentions are mutually responsive.
Cè says: The Dark and Yellow meeting in welcoming is responding by kind.
Fàn says: Heaven is Dark, Earth is Yellow.
When Heaven and Earth meet in welcoming, winds and rains adjust in season;
When ruler and minister meet in welcoming, governance and teaching follow measure.
Guāng says: The sixth position is the utmost extent, the peak of responsiveness.
From Heaven and Earth down to all things, from ruler to subject, from husband to wife, from friend to friend—none do not respond by kind.

**Seventh Position:**
Far [is] ——, near [is] *pǒu* (掊), welcoming *fù* (父) unexpectedly meets.
Cè says: Far ——, near *pǒu*—losing the kind of father.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* reads ——; now following the other editions.
——, pronounced *hòu* (许候切), meaning angry, glaring.
*Pǒu* (掊), pronounced *hòu* (普后切), meaning to strike.
*Jiā* (迦), same as *xiè* (邂), pronounced *xiè* (蟹).
*Hòu* (逅), pronounced *hòu* (后), meaning to meet unexpectedly.

**Eighth Position:**
Blood is seen entering the gate; bowing to welcome in the central courtyard.
Cè says: Blood seen entering the gate is using virtue for self-defense.
The Sòng and Lù editions read *jiāo* (椒) for *jiān* (捬); now following the Fàn and Wáng editions.
*Jiān* (捬), pronounced *fǔ* (府), meaning to defend.
The eighth position is the midpoint of misfortune, hence "blood is seen entering the gate"—those who cause harm have arrived.
At the day’s noon, one who can defend with virtue, welcoming and repelling in the central courtyard—things cannot harm, hence "defending welcome in the central courtyard."

**Ninth Position:**
Moisture welcomes at the bed’s foot, accumulating at walls and houses.
Cè says: Moisture welcoming at the bed’s foot is ruin within.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* and *Wángběn* read *zé* (泽) for *shī* (湿); now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.
The Fàn and Wáng editions read *fǎn* (罦) for *lěi* (累); now following the Sòng and Lù editions.
Fàn says: *Fǎn* means "to cover."
Now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions for *diān* (颠), though the *Wángběn* reads *yuàn* (愿).
*Lěi* (累), pronounced *ruì* (良瑞切).
The ninth position is the extreme of misfortune, corresponding to night.
It is through which petty men and women can overturn states—not the work of a single day or night, but a gradual process.
Like moisture welcoming at the bed’s foot, seeping upward to accumulate at walls and houses, beyond remedy.
Examining the origins of ruin, it arises from within.

Two regions, two states, three departments, one household encountering
**Yang Fire**—corresponds to *Guà* (姤).
Upon entering, meeting the first day, the sun rests at *Liǔ* (柳).
Yin-qi begins to arrive, Yang-qi begins to depart, their comings and goings meeting.

**First day:** *Yōu* (幽) meets *Shén* (神) and *Shī* (师), the omen is *zhēn* (贞).
**Cè** says: *Yōu* meeting *Shén* is the thought of attaining principle.
**Wáng** says: At the start of *Yōu*, the spirit meets but has not yet manifested—it is the symbol of a hidden communion with the divine.
**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, and it corresponds to day.
With sincere devotion, one attains communion with *Shén* and *Shī*, even if it manifests in dreams, yet it does not lose its rectitude—just as when King Zhōu dreamed of Fù Yuè.
Dreams are matters difficult to verify.
Yet when sincerity reaches its peak, even dreams may be verified—how much more so when consulting with advisors and receiving blessings?

**Second day:** *Chōngchōng* (冲冲) child meets, an ambiguous decree.
**Cè** says: *Chōngchōng* child is the unworthy son.
The *Fàn* edition reads *bù shòu dìng* (不受定) for *bù dìng* (不定), now following the other editions.
**Wáng** says: To meet without intention is *chōngchōng*.
A child is a term for one in ignorance and confusion.
Thus, what certainty can there be in what it meets?
This is so because it is out of place, corresponding to night, and does not meet appropriately.
The unworthy son is clearly one without understanding.

**Third day:** Neither going nor coming, attaining the virtue of *shì* (士) and *nǚ* (女).
**Cè** says: Neither going nor coming is the proper conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.
The *Fàn* and *Wáng* editions read *bù wǎng bù lái bù qiú* (不往不来不求), but **Cè** says *bù wǎng bù qiú* (不往不求); now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.
**Sòng** says: *Zé* (则) means law.
**Guāng** says: Those who boast and self-promote are the shameful conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.
Thus, neither going nor coming yet meeting naturally is the proper conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.

**Fourth day:** [Blank], the *Duì* (兑) person meets rain—**calamity**.
**Cè** says: The *Duì* person meeting rain is self-inflicted ruin.
**Wáng** says: [Blank], the appearance of boldness without propriety.

**Fifth day:** Hunting meets beasts, none forbid it.
**Cè** says: Hunting meets beasts—this is truly worth emulation.
Five is the peak of fortune, and it corresponds to day.
As when hunting meets beasts, if captured, who can resist taking them?

**Sixth day:** *Bǐ* (俾) the spider weaves its snares, meeting a bee.
Though the gain is great, one cannot follow.
**Cè** says: The spider’s snares bring harm near at hand.
The bee is the same as *fēng* (蜂).
**Fàn** says: To command the spider to weave snares and catch a bee.
The bee is a stinging insect, thus unable to be controlled.
Though it may seem profitable, one cannot follow and take it.
**Guāng** says: Six is the highest blessing, yet it corresponds to night.
The petty man, seeing gain, is eager to seize it, yet cannot attain his desire.

**Seventh day:** Shaking its horns, the lord and father meet insult—this is not the proper command.
**Cè** says: Shaking its horns is the straight path in action.
Seven is the beginning of calamity, and it corresponds to day.
If the lord and father unfortunately meet insult, then the virtuous man shakes his horns, follows the straight path, and dies—it may not be the proper command, yet dying righteously leaves no choice.

**Eighth day:** Two *sì* (兕) battle, one loses its horn—unable to prevail, suffering loss.
**Cè** says: Two *sì* battling means losing a horn and suffering loss.
Victory, *shì* (诗证切).
Loss, *sàng* (息浪切).
Eight is the midpoint of calamity, and it corresponds to night.
As when two *sì* meet and battle, one loses its horn, it cannot prevail and suffers death.
The horn symbolizes the warrior who resists insult.
**Ninth day:** Someone takes its horn, meeting below and damaging the foot.
**Cè** says: Someone takes its horn—how can it be withstood?
The *Fàn* and *Wáng* editions read *dǐ qí jiǎo* (抵其角) for *huò shì qí jiǎo* (或氏其角); now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.
*Dǐ* (抵), *dū lǐ* (都礼切).

---
Two regions, two states, three departments, two households at the stove:
**Yin Wood**—corresponds to *Dǐng* (鼎).
Entering the stove, the ninth position, twenty-eight degrees twenty-eight seconds, the sun’s course at *Jūn Huǒ* (鹑火), the *xiǎo shǔ* (小暑) *qì* responds.
The *Dòu* constellation aligns with *Wèi* (未), the *lǜ* (律) resonates with *Lín Zhōng* (林钟).
The *Dǐng* boils abundantly to nourish sages and worthies, thus the stove abounds with symbols of nurturing the virtuous.
Though Yin may pour and scatter, Yang still holds and harmonizes it.
*Hé* (龢), an ancient form of *hé* (和); same below.
**Sòng** says: The stove harmonizes Yin and Yang, thus sometimes it pours, sometimes it harmonizes—thus it is so.
**Guāng** says: Yin scatters, Yang harmonizes—this is the symbol of cooking.

**First day:** The stove lacks substance, begging from neighbors.
**Cè** says: The stove lacks substance—it has an empty name.
**Wáng** says: At the start of the stove’s position, out of place and corresponding to night, it lacks substance.
Having lost the way of cooking, it cannot provide food, thus it begs from neighbors.
**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, yet it corresponds to night—the petty man, inwardly lacking substance, steals others’ virtues to make a name for himself.

**Second day:** The yellow *Dǐng* stands firm, its interior spacious—neither drinking nor eating, yet sincere and without harm.
**Cè** says: The yellow *Dǐng* stands firm—its central integrity is virtuous.
**Wáng** says: The *Dǐng* is the stove’s vessel.
*Jiè* (介) means standing alone.
Its spacious interior signifies broad tolerance and receptivity.
**Guāng** says: Two is in the lower body’s center and corresponds to day, a position of *fāng jǔ* (方沮), yet not yet attaining lower blessing.
The virtuous man guards the middle path, retreats to cultivate himself, and does not take food lightly.
Nourishing his resolve inwardly, he does not covet externals, thus though he neither drinks nor eats, his sincerity truly harms nothing.

**Third day:** The stove lacks firewood, yet gold flows nearby.
**Cè** says: The stove lacks firewood—it is unused.
*Pín* (濒), pronounced *pín* (频).

**Fourth day:** The *Gē* (鬲) is filled with food, attaining its labor and effort.
**Cè** says: The *Gē* filled with food is timely nourishment for me.
*Gē* (鬲), pronounced *lì* (历).
**Wáng** says: *Gē* is the smaller cooking vessel.
**Guāng** says: A *Dǐng* with a broad base is called *Gē*.
Four is the lower blessing, and it corresponds to day.
The virtuous man uses blessings to nourish the worthy, even if little, yet attains their labor and effort.

**Fifth day:** The *Dǐng* is large enough for libation—yet neither solemn nor orderly.
**Cè** says: The *Dǐng* large enough for libation—feasting without sincerity.
*Qí* (齐), pronounced *cè* (侧) and *qiè* (皆).
**Wáng** says: There is no intent of grand feasting with solemnity.
**Guāng** says: *Shāng* (觞), should be read *shāng* (商), meaning "to cook."
Five occupies the position of abundance, and thus can nourish the worthy, hence it is said: The *Dǐng* is large enough for libation.
Yet if, though it corresponds to the day’s night, one cannot treat the scholars of the world with propriety, then all scholars will refuse to return.

The *Hong Fan* says: "All those who are upright, when they have grown rich, will then govern the people."

**Sixth day:** The five flavors are blended, harmonized like fine soup—this is the feast of the great sage.
**Cè** says: The feast of blended flavors—this is the duty of the prime minister.
**Wáng** originally wrote *měi* (美) as *gēng* (羹), but the *Xiǎo Sòng* version reads: "Five flavors harmonized, rich as fine soup," now following the *Sòng, Lù, and Fàn* editions.
**Wáng** says: The duty of the prime minister is to blend the five flavors; when the great sage finds the right person, he feasts them accordingly.
**Guāng** says: Six is the highest blessing, corresponding to day.
The virtuous man assists the state, offering what is right and rejecting what is wrong, advancing the worthy and removing the unworthy, harmonizing governance like blending flavors into fine soup, and presenting it to the ruler.
If the ruler then feasts them, the world will be in great order.

High King Zǒng’s command says: If you make the blended soup, you must use salt and plum sauce.
The Three Dukes serve the ruler, bearing the symbol of the *Dǐng*.

**Seventh day:** The cow’s fat is properly rendered, yet without washing the axe before boiling, the sickness of *Ōu* and *Yù* will come.
**Cè** says: The cow’s fat and *Ōu-Yù*—this is an unclean resolve.
*Fāng* (肪), pronounced *fāng* (方).
*Ōu* (欧), pronounced *wū-hòu* (乌后).
*Yù* (鴂), pronounced *cuī-dōu* (衰都).
**Fàn** says: *Ōu-Yù* is the sound of vomiting.
**Wáng** says: *Pí-niú* (脂牛) is a fat cow.
**Guāng** says: *Fāng* (肪) is fat. *Ōu* (欧) is to vomit. *Yù* (鴂) is when the heart dislikes something and one vomits.
The fat of a fat cow is used to illustrate fine blessings.
Though the ruler may nourish scholars with fine blessings, if he does not approach them with sincere and pure resolve, the scholars will surely despise him.
Seven marks the beginning of calamity, the omen of losing the hearts of the worthy.

**Eighth day:** Eating its leftovers, though one calls out, it is not ruined.
**Cè** says: Eating its leftovers—this is to cover one’s virtue.
*Wěi* (委), pronounced *yú-wěi* (於伪).
*Jiào* (噭), same as *jiào* (叫).

**Ninth day (uppermost):** The stove’s fire is extinguished—this is the family’s calamity.
**Cè** says: The stove’s fire extinguished—this is the state’s traitor.
The stove’s fire extinguished illustrates not nourishing the worthy.
Those who do not nourish the worthy are self-made traitors to their state.
Examples include: Jiè killing Guān Lóngróng, Zhòu killing Bǐ Gān, Fú Chā killing Wú Yuán, and Xiàng Yǔ driving Fàn Zēng—they are all of this kind.

*(Note: The final line appears fragmented; "二方二州三部三家大 阳家金，准丰" may require further contextual clarification for precise translation.)*

**Hexagram 34: *Dà* (大) – The Great**

**Initial Line:**
*Yīn* emptiness within, *yáng* swelling without—
Things conform like a basin and its lid.
*Fàn* and *Wáng* originally read "within" for the first part; now following *Sòng* and *Lǔ*.
*Fàn* originally read "swelling" as *féng* (逢); now following *èr Sòng*, *Lǔ*, and *Wáng*.
*Sòng* says: *Péng* (蓬) means "to fill."
*Guāng* says: *Yǔ* (與) means "all."
All things like a basin and its lid—
Outer grandeur vast, inner emptiness.

---
**First (initial) line:**
The abyss profound and overflowing—
Encompassing without bounds, obscure.
**Cè** says: The abyss profound and overflowing—
A treasure wrapped without measure.
*Wáng* reads *guǒ* (裹) as *huái* (怀); now following all other texts.
*Hǎng* (潢), pronounced *huáng* (黄).
One: water, also the beginning of thought, corresponding to day.
The noble’s heart, like the abyss profound and overflowing,
Embraces all without exclusion—
Thus its greatness.
Residing in the lowest body, obscure—
Hidden yet unseen.

---
**Second line:**
Enlarge his thoughts, his person burns in the furnace.
**Cè** says: Enlarging his thoughts—
His mind is injured by excess.
*Lú* (炉), pronounced *lǜ* (虑).
*Wáng* says: In times of greatness, misplaced at night,
Contrary to what is fitting—
Yet he strives to broaden his thoughts,
But his wisdom cannot encompass all,
And he harms himself in return.
*Lú* is a grinding tool.
Over-grinding brings injury.
*Guāng* says: Two is the middle of thought, corresponding to night.
A petty man with small wisdom yet grand schemes.

As the *Shī* says:
*"No plowing of the fields, only weeds grow tall and proud.
No thought for distant men, laboring with weary heart."*

---
**Third line:**
Great yet not self-aggrandizing—
Beneficial to achieve greatness.
**Cè** says: Great yet not self-aggrandizing—
Building from the small.
*Wáng* says: In proper position at day,
Thus he does not exalt himself,
Preserving humility,
Using the small to accumulate,
And thereby attaining true greatness.
*Guāng* says: Three is the upper of thought, corresponding to day.
The noble’s ambition vast, his heart modest—
Thus he fulfills his greatness.

---
**Fourth line:**
Enlarge his gates and outer precincts—
His blade lost, a hollow cry.
**Cè** says: Enlarging his gates and outer precincts—
Replacing substance with renown.
*Wáng* says: Sound without substance—
Thus it is called a "hollow cry."
*Guāng* says: Gates are external, precincts distant.
The blade is for severing.
A "cry" is the spread of name.
Four is external excess, corresponding to night.
A petty man neglects his inner self,
Yet labors to enlarge his outer facade—
Abandoning the near for the distant.
His blade lost, he cannot sever.
Though his name resounds far,
His essence remains hollow.

---
**Fifth line:**
Encompassing the barren yet centered—
Overcoming.
**Cè** says: Encompassing the barren yet centered—
Subduing the Nine *Yí*.
*Wáng* reads *jiǔ* (九) as *sì* (四); now following all other texts.
*Fàn* says: *Kè* (克) means "able."
*Guāng* says: Five occupies the central position, corresponding to day.
The Sage upholds the Great Middle Way,
Capable of embracing all under Heaven.

---
**Sixth line:**
The great loses the small,
The many loses the few.
**Cè** says: The great loses the small—
Calamity arises from the subtle.
*Wáng* reads *cè* (测) as *huò zhōng fā* (祸中发); now following all other texts.
*Fàn* says: Six is water.
Water’s loss lies in its crevices.
Affairs arise from the minute;
Calamity begins subtly.
*Guāng* says: Six is the middle of excess, corresponding to night.
The onset of great loss.

---
**Seventh line:**
Great extravagance and remoteness—
Self-diminished by the *gū*,
Yet sometimes benefited by *bū*.
**Cè** says: Extravagance and remoteness self-diminished—
Able to censure himself.
*Gū* (觚), the odd and solitary.
*Bū* (餔), pronounced *bó gū* (博孤).
*Fàn* says: *Gū* is law.
*Guāng* says: *Shē* (奢), like *tuō* (哆).
*Yú* (迂), distant.
*Bū*, food.
Seven is the beginning of calamity, corresponding to day.
Greatness already excessive, reaching distant extravagance.
The noble, perceiving the subtle,
Knows calamity is near,
And with law restrains himself—
Thus he receives further blessings and provisions.

---
**Eighth line:**
Abundant walls, steep foundations—
Three years without reinforcement, they collapse.
**Cè** says: The steepness of abundant walls—
Their collapse is not delayed.
*Zhǐ* (址), same as *zhǐ* (趾).
*Fàn* says: *Fēng* (丰), great.
*Qiào* (峭), steep.
*Zhǐ*, the foot—meaning the base.
Three, completion.
Great walls with steep foundations,
If not reinforced year after year,
Risk crumbling.
Just as the noble’s Way—
If its roots are not nurtured,
Its branches will surely perish.
*Guāng* says: Eight is within calamity, corresponding to night.
The petty man, unaware of impending ruin,
Seeks only to magnify himself,
Neglecting his foundation.

---
**Ninth (terminal) line:**
Greatness completed yet diminished—
*Pǐ* departs beyond Heaven.
**Cè** says: Greatness completed yet diminished—
The small becomes the great’s resource.
*Wáng* originally lacked *yǐ* (以); now following all other texts.
*Sòng*, *Lǔ*, and *Fàn* read *zī* (资) as *zhì* (质); now following *Yú* and *Wáng*.
Two regions, three states, one department, one family—*kuò* (廓).
*Yīn* family, water—also *fēng* (丰).
Entering *kuò*, the fourth line: the seven stars of day.
*Yīn* qi buried yet pondered,
*Yáng* yet expansive and vast.
*Sòng* and *Lǔ* originally read "obscured and hidden"—
Now following *Fàn* and *Wáng*.
*Chén* says: *Yì* (瘗), pronounced *kǔ xié* (苦协).
*Yīn* ( ), pronounced *hé* (合).
Thus *yì* is written as .
*Wú* says: *Yì*, pronounced *yú jì* (於计), meaning "stillness."
Thus the character should follow #6.
*Sòng* says: , meaning "to gather."
At this time, *yīn* qi responds by concealing itself below,
While *yáng* qi remains robust and vast above.
The diagram says: "Empty within, vast without—this is *kuò*."
*Fàn* says: *Yì*, to harmonize.
, to unite.
*Wáng* says: *Yīn* qi still weak,
Buried and harmonized.
, the ancient *shè* (歙) character.
*Guāng* says: *Yīn* qi concealed and unified,
Enclosing all things,
While *yáng* qi yet strives to expand—
Thus *kuò*.
*Kuò* means to stretch and enlarge.

On the first day, *kuò* expands and spreads, yet its foundation is not set aright.
**Cè** says: *Kuò* expands and spreads—its foundation is already tilted.

**Wáng** says: At the outset of *kuò*, one loses one’s proper place at night. Though it expands and spreads, it cannot correct its beginning.

**Guāng** says: One (the first day) is the thought of origin, yet it falls to night.
The petty man strives to expand and spread, yet fails to establish his foundation, hence his actions are prone to collapse.

On the second day, gold beams and jade pillars support the *kuò*—fortified within the city.
**Cè** says: Gold beams and jade pillars—proliferating and upright support.

**Fàn** says: Gold and jade are both of fine quality.

**Wáng** says: Two resides in the lower body’s center, occupying its proper place by day.
Gold and jade as beams and pillars—this is the attainment of worthy ministers.
Beams and pillars are the tools of *bǎn zhù* (板筑, rammed-earth construction).

**Guāng** says: The tools of *bǎn zhù*—the side is called *gàn* (干), the lintel *chuí* (桢).
Two is the thought of the middle, yet it falls to day.
The noble one can use worthy and wise ministers as support, expanding his virtue to defend himself.

On the third day, *kuò* has no heir, its chamber a stone maiden.
**Cè** says: *Kuò* has no heir—how then can there be descendants?

**Wáng** says: To take a stone maiden as wife—there is no way to continue the line.

**Guāng** says: Three is the thought of the upper, yet it falls to night.
The petty man’s thoughts expand and spread, yet he cannot sustain them, hence *kuò* has no heir.
To take a stone maiden as wife—this means seeking a spouse and finding only a stone maiden.

On the fourth day, he expands his gates and doors, using *yù* (圉) to repel bandits and barbarians.
**Cè** says: To expand his gates and doors—this is great enterprise.
Originally *yù* was used to mean "to defend," but the *Wáng* text reads *yòng gù* (用固), and the *Xiǎo Sòng* text reads *yòng yù* (用御)#7. Now following the *Sòng* and *Lǔ* texts.
*Yù* is the same as *yù* (御, to defend).

Fourth is the external "other," yet it falls to day.
The noble one expands his rites and propriety to defend against the petty, hence: "Expands his gates and doors, using *yù* to repel bandits and barbarians."

On the fifth day, the Heavenly Gate opens wide, expanding the hall’s steps—yet there are flaws in its birth.
**Cè** says: The Heavenly Gate opens wide—his virtue cannot fill the hall.
The *Wáng* text reads *huī dāng* (恢当) instead of *huī táng* (恢堂), and the *Èr Sòng*, *Lǔ*, and *Wáng Cè* texts lack the *táng* (堂) character. Now following the *Fàn* text.

Fifth is within the *kuò* family yet occupies the peak position, hence: "The Heavenly Gate opens wide, expanding the hall’s steps"—speaking of openness and exaltation.
Yet during the day’s night, the petty cannot enjoy this great fortune, his virtue failing to fulfill his station, inevitably leading to errors and downfall.

On the sixth day, *wéi fēng wéi chóng* (维丰维崇), the myriad ministers *féng féng* (冯冯), their virtue rising.
**Cè** says: *Wéi fēng wéi chóng*—this is true peace.
The *Wáng* text reads *yù* (欲) instead of *zī* (兹). Now following the other texts.
*Féng* is the ancient form of *píng* (凭).
*Féng féng*—abundant and flourishing.

Sixth is the utmost greatness, yet it falls to day.
The noble one expands his virtue to achieve true peace.
Abundant and towering, all states submit in obedience, *féng féng*—teeming and thriving, like swift steeds converging from all directions.

On the seventh day, its exterior is vast and *gē* (杚), yet its interior is lost.
The noble one retreats to the wilds, the petty man enters the hall.
**Cè** says: Its exterior is vast and *gē*—there is no one within.
The *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* texts read *kū* (扢)#8. Now following the *Sòng*, *Lǔ*, and *Wáng* texts.
The *Sòng* and *Lǔ* texts read *zhì shì* (至室), while *Wáng* reads *zài shì* (在室). Now following the *Fàn* text.

**Chén** says: *Kū* (扢), pronounced *qì* (讫), meaning "to rub."
**Wáng** says: *Gē* is a *dǒu gài* (斗概, beam end).
**Wú** says: *Kū* is the same as *gài* (概), pronounced *kē ài* (柯爱).
The *Shuōwén* (说文) reads *gù mò* (古没), meaning "level."
**Guāng** says: *Gē* should be read as *gē* (圪), pronounced *yú yǐ* (鱼乙), meaning "tall and robust."

Seventh is within the *kuò* family yet occupies the upper body, hence: "Its exterior is vast and *gē*—speaking of its expansive and towering grandeur."
Yet during the day’s night, the petty man, though in a position of greatness, grows arrogant, distancing the worthy while nearing the unworthy—chaos arises from within, hence: "Yet its interior is lost, the noble one retreats to the wilds, the petty man enters the hall."

Another saying: *Kū* (扢), pronounced *xǔ qì* (许讫), meaning "joy."

On the eighth day, it expands its exterior, empties its interior—profitable for drumming and *zhēng* (钲).

「The *Zè* commentary states: When the exterior is expansive and the interior is empty, then it can be heard.

The eighth hexagram resides in the exterior and corresponds to the day.
The noble one expands the exterior to manifest **virtue/power**, empties the interior to receive all things, thus enabling their name to be heard afar.
It is like the drum and *zhēng* (a ceremonial bell) — both expand outward and are hollow within, yet produce sound.
The noble one’s **virtue/power** lies in the exterior, and when it is broad and expansive, it is solely for the sake of their reputation.

The ninth hexagram, at its peak, reaches the extreme of expansiveness in *gāoyōng* (高庸), and for three years, there are no children.
The *Zè* commentary states: To reach the extreme of expansiveness in *gāoyōng*, it will ultimately have no one to serve.
*Yōng* (庸) is the same as *táng* (塘, pond/dike).
The *Guāng* commentary says: When residing at the highest extreme yet corresponding to night,
The petty man strives to make their walls and dikes grandly expansive yet lacks any children or laborers within.
High without people, regret is inevitable.

The *Guāng* commentary further states: The ninth hexagram resides at the uppermost extreme, yet corresponds to night.
The petty man is obsessed with building lofty, expansive structures yet does not know when to stop, hence: "Expansive at *gāoyōng*."
Unable to lower their ambitions and connect with those beneath them, the lower ones will rebel, hence: "For three years, there are no children."

---
**Two sides, three states, one section, two families:**
The *Yáng* (陽) family is associated with fire, akin to *hǎn* (涣, disperse).」

「The *Yáng* (陽) family takes *hǎn* (涣) as *huàn* (焕, radiant), thus naming its first section **Wén** (文).

Upon entering **Wén**, the ninth hexagram, it is said: *"Day abandons its splendor."* (舍张)
Yin (陰) gathers its substance, while Yang (陽) disperses its form.
Form and substance intermingle, and all things shine brightly.

The first line: *"Pure and unadorned"* (祫).
What is *màn* (缦)? It is *yùzhēn* (玉贞, jade-like purity) #9.
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Pure and unadorned"* (拾何缦), for form is within.
*Màn* (缦), pronounced *huì* (会), is akin to *zhuì* (缋, embroidered silk).
*何* (何), pronounced *bèi* (被, to cover), is *màn* (缦) without adornment.
The ninth line marks the beginning of thought, and it corresponds to daytime.
The sage cultivates inner form and outer substance, like applying embroidered designs to a plain garment (衿) and covering it with unadorned silk (缦服).
Pure yet containing subtle patterns, like the true nature of jade—its beauty is perfect. (纯素含章, 如玉之正, 美之至也)
The *Zhōngyōng* (中庸) says: *"Wearing brocade yet valuing plainness, for one fears the ostentation of its patterns."* (衣锦尚絅, 恶其文之着也)

The second line: *"Form flourishes, substance is lacking."* (文蔚质否)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Form flourishes, substance is lacking"* (文蔚质否), for they cannot coexist harmoniously.
The *Guāng* commentary further explains: *"Arising"* (蔚) means delicate and intricate in appearance.
The second line represents the midpoint of thought, yet corresponds to night.
Though the petty man’s form may be ornate, his substance cannot truly match it.
*Níng Yíng* (宁嬴) of the *Fù* (父) section #10 says: *"Ornate yet lacking substance—where resentment gathers."* (华而不实, 怨之所聚也)

The third line: *"Great form yet more substance, trust seems insufficient."* (大文弥朴, 孚似不足)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Great form yet more substance"* (大文弥朴), for substance has excess.
The *Guāng* commentary further clarifies: *"Primal"* (弥) is here taken as *"zhēn"* (珍, treasured), and *"pǔ"* (朴) as *"pú"* (璞, uncarved jade), following the readings of *Sòng* (宋), *Lù* (陆), and *Fàn* (范).
*Náfù* (孚) means great trust.
The third line represents the end of thought, yet corresponds to daytime.
The sage’s great form appears simple, yet his trust is profound—seeming insufficient yet truly boundless.

The fourth line: *"Adorned like *bīn* (彬), striped like *fěi* (斐), patterned like *bīn* (彬) and *fěi* (斐) as tiger and leopard."* (斐如邠如, 虎豹文如)
It is not what Heaven bestows, hence: *"Lacking."* (匪天之享, 否)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Adorned like *bīn* (斐邠) yet lacking"* (斐邠之否), what is there to praise?
*Bīn* (邠) is akin to *bīn* (彬, harmonious).
*Fěi* (否), pronounced *bǐ* (鄙, vulgar), is here taken as *"fěi"* (斐, striped).
*Fàn* (范) says: *"Tigers and leopards are prized for their patterns."* (虎豹之兽, 以其文贵)
*Fěi* (斐) and *bīn* (邠) describe form in its most elaborate state. (文盛貌也)
The *Guāng* commentary further explains: The fourth line is at the midpoint yet corresponds to night, akin to tigers and leopards—using form to harm oneself, not what Heaven bestows, hence: *"Lacking."* (盖同虎豹, 以文害其躬, 匪天所享, 故曰否也)
*Xiǎng* (享) means to face or turn toward.

The fifth line: *"Shining like *biāo* (彪), resplendent with form, distinguished with virtue, and adorned with plainness."* (炳如彪如, 尚文昭如, 车服庸如)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Shining like *biāo* (彪)"* (彪如在上, 天文炳也).
The *Guāng* commentary further clarifies: *"Resplendent with form"* (尚文昭如) is taken as *"shàng wén zhāo rú"* (尚文昭如), following the readings of *Sòng* (宋), *Lù* (陆), and *Fàn* (范).
The *Guāng* commentary explains: The fifth line resides at the central position, with a proper place corresponding to daytime, as the master of form and virtue, radiantly observable.
*Shàng wén zhāo rú* (尚文昭如): The sage-king values and displays the form of rituals and virtue, making them clearly distinguishable.
*"Adorned with plainness"* (车服庸如): It speaks of using carriages and garments to display the virtuous deeds of the worthy, for the greatest use of form is found here.
The *Shùn Diǎn* (舜典) says: *"Spread their words in speech, test their virtue with deeds, and adorn them with carriages and garments according to their merit."* (敷纳以言, 明试以功, 车服以庸)

The sixth line: *"Vast form without measure, unrestrained at the river."* (鸿文无范, 恣于川)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Vast form without measure"* (鸿文无范), for one acts at will.
*Fàn* (范) means law or standard.
The *Guāng* commentary further explains: *"Wild geese flying"* (鸿雁之飞) may resemble script or patterns, yet they lack any law or standard #11; encountering a river, they simply act as they please.
The sixth line exceeds the central position yet corresponds to night.
The petty man’s form is without law and acts arbitrarily.

The seventh line: *"The pheasant’s misfortune, yet the rooster covers the valley."* (雉之不禄, 而鸡盖谷)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"The pheasant’s misfortune"* (雉之不禄), for it is difficult to nurture in seclusion.
The *Guāng* commentary further clarifies: The seventh line, though exceeding fullness, is in its proper place and corresponds to daytime.
Like the *zhái* (翟) or pheasant, which possess patterns yet harbor an unyielding and upright nature (耿絜之性), refusing to be tamed by others, hence: *"Misfortune"* (不禄), for they never match the rooster’s devotion to feeding on the grain of the valley.
*Jì* (荩) means to advance or progress.
The *Guāng* commentary explains: The seventh line is at the outer position yet corresponds to daytime.
The sage has form yet remains upright and uncompromising, avoiding the world and not seeking office.
The seventh line is the stage of calamity, hence the worthy retreat.

The eighth line: *"Carved and striped, the grain and cloth vanish in due time, and form becomes chaotic."* (雕签, 谷布亡于时, 文则乱)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"Carved and striped"* (雕韱之文), for it is merely a waste of time.
The *Guāng* commentary further explains: The eighth line is near the extreme yet loses its proper place and corresponds to night.
If one pursues elaborate carvings and striped patterns, wasting time without substance, causing the grain and cloth to vanish in due course, then the harm of such form is chaos itself.

The ninth line: *"At the extreme of form, dense and intricate, easily transforming into *fúfú* (黼黻)."* (极文密密, 易以黼黻)
The *Guāng* commentary states: *"The extreme of form is easily transformed"* (极文之易), for it should be replaced with substance.
The *Guāng* commentary further explains: The ninth line resides at the extreme of form yet obtains its proper place and corresponds to daytime, able to change the harm of extreme form.
The utmost refinement of form reaches *mìmì* (密密, dense and intricate).
Yet when it becomes too delicate and minute, it can be transformed, making it like *fúfú* (黼黻, ritual patterns) which have proper order.
The *Guāng* commentary explains: The ninth line represents the exhaustion of harm yet corresponds to daytime #12; hence this image.
*Fú* (黼) is white and black, while *fú* (黻) is black and blue.
Though *fúfú* (黼黻) are patterns, compared to elaborate carvings and striped designs, they are truly substance.

**Two sides, three states, one section, three families of Rites:**
The *Yīn* (陰) family is wood, akin to *lǚ* (履, tread/conduct).
Upon entering **Rites** (礼), the fourth hexagram, it is said: *"Six divisions, three sections, great summer’s energy responds."* (六分三秒, 大暑气应)
Yin is below, while Yang is above; the upper and lower positions are correct, and things have proper rites.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* (小宋) reading of *"Yang in the upper"* (阳在上) is taken as *"Yang increases"* (阳益高); here, it follows the readings of the other families.

The first line: *"Treading at the tip of the foot, honoring one’s ancestors."* (履于跂, 后其祖祢)

「测曰：履于跂，退其亲也。宋、陆本歧作跛，今从范、王本。
王曰：居礼之初，失位当夜，是始而乖礼者也。履于跂，非敬之道也。
光谓：跂，举踵也。一居下体之下，履之至卑者也，乃欲举踵强高，居下而僭上之象也。凡臣之事君，犹事父也；事大君，犹事祖也。在下位而礼僭於上，是犹退其祖父使居己后也，不亦悖乎？

次二，目穆穆，足肃肃，乃贯以棘。
测曰：穆穆、肃肃，敬出心也。
王曰：棘，取赤心也。
光谓：穆穆、肃肃，皆恭谨貌。二为思中，而当昼。外貌之恭，必贯之以诚，然后善也。

次三，画象成形，孚无成。
测曰：画象成形，非其真也。
王曰：忠信，礼之本。既乖於本，何礼之有？
光谓：三为思末而当夜，饰外貌而无内实者也，故曰画象成形，孚无成。

次四，孔雁之仪，利用登于阶。
测曰：孔雁之仪，可法则也。
虞曰：雁飞成行，孔雀亦成行也。
光谓：孔雀有文章，雁有行字，皆威仪之象。阶，谕进而登位也。四为下禄，而当昼。君居位有威可畏，有仪可象，其下畏而爱之，则而象之。是以其教不肃而成，其政不严而治也。

次五，怀其违，折其匕，过丧锡九矢。
测曰：怀违折匕，贬其禄也。
王本过丧锡九矢作过鬯锡，今从诸家。
范、小宋本贬其禄作贬天禄，王本作败其禄，今从宋、陆本。

次六，鱼鳞差之，乃大施之，帝用登于天。
测曰：鱼鳞差之，贵贱位也。
范、小宋本大作矢，今从宋、陆、王本。六为极大，而当昼。君子制礼，使贵贱有序，差若鱼鳞。执此道而大施之於天下，天下莫不治也。帝者用此，则可以格于皇天矣。

次七，出礼不畏，入畏。
测曰：出礼不畏，人所弃也。七为祸始，而当夜。小人逾越礼法而不顾者也。由其不畏，所以入畏，谓陷刑戮也。《书》曰：弗畏入畏。

次八，冠戚，履全履。
测曰：冠戚履贱，不可不上也。
二宋、陆、王本全作金，今从范本。
范本冠戚，明不可上也。王本冠戚，不可不上也。今从小宋本。
范曰：戚，以谕败也。冠虽败，宜加之首；履虽全，宜践之足。
光谓：八在上体而为祸中，冠败之象也。当日之昼，故下不能陵也。

上九，戴无首，焉用此九？
测曰：无首之戴，焉所往也？焉，於虔切。九，阳之盛也。礼主卑让，故虽天子，必有礼也。九为亢极而当夜，上无所戴，高而必危。譬如戴冠而无首，焉用此盛极之位哉？

二方三州二部一家逃
阳家金，准遁。」

The **Yin-Qi Chapter** grows strong, the **Yang-Qi** retreats in concealment, and all things are on the verge of decline.

The **Song** says: This refers to the waxing and waning of all things with the **Yang’s** flourishing and decline.

At the seventh division, the hexagram becomes **Retreat (Tùn)**.
The subtle **Yin** within is about to emerge from the earth.

The **King** says: *Chapter* means clear, strong, and great.

**First (Initial), Escape the Smooth Water, Erase Its Tracks.**
The **Zè** says: Escape the smooth water—no tracks are left behind.
The first is the beginning of contemplation, occurring in daylight.
The **Junzi** avoids calamity before it sprouts, flees evil before it takes form, and restrains it at the very start of deliberation. If no one sees its tracks, how could misfortune ever reach them?
It is like fleeing into water—water follows and smooths out, sealing its marks, so no one can perceive its traces.

**Second, The Heart Trembles, Feet in Gold Sandals, No Will to Enter the Ravine.**
The **Zè** says: The trembling heart—its resolve is not firm.
The **Fàn** text reads *惕*, the **King’s** text reads *惕*, noting that *惕* is the ancient character; here, we follow the **Song** and **Lù** texts.
The **Song** and **Lù** texts read *含* for *金*, while the **King’s** text reads *望*; here, we follow the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo-Sòng** texts.
The **Song** says: *Jiāng* means "to proceed," unable to resolve the heart with principle before acting.
The **Guāng** says: *Jīn* symbolizes firmness and endurance.
The second is the midpoint of contemplation, occurring at night.
Though the petty person sees disaster approaching, trembling in fear, they cannot resolve themselves with principle. Clinging to their honors and emoluments, they linger and do not depart, unaware that the ravine lies beneath their feet—soon they will stumble and fall.
Confucius said: *"To see what is right and not do it is cowardice."*

**Third, Trembling at the Thighs, Whipping the Horse, Bandits Glance at the Door, Fleeing for Gain.**
The **Zè** says: Trembling at the thighs and whipping the horse—disaster is near at hand.
The **Fàn** text reads *望* as *望*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **King’s** texts.
The **Chén** says: *望* is the ancient character for *望*.
The **Song** says: *Near at hand* means the bandits are already close.
The **Guāng** says: The third is the end of contemplation, occurring in daylight.
*To flee* is what is fitting.
Trembling at the thighs—fear.
Whipping the horse—desire for swift departure.
Bandits glance at the door—disaster is imminent.
At this moment, it is advantageous to flee.

**Fourth, The Towering Tree is Shaken, Flying Birds Pass Over, Some Alight and Descend.**
The **Zè** says: Birds of the towering tree—if they wish to stop, they descend.
The **Song**, **Lù**, and **King’s** texts read *枞* for *摐*; here, we follow the **Fàn** text.
*Or alight and descend*—the **Song** and **Lù** texts read *止之*, while the **Fàn** text reads *或降*; here, we follow the **King’s** text.
The **Fàn** says: *Shaking upward* is called *摐*.
A tree shaken upward is where birds do not gather, so they pass and depart.
The **Guāng** says: *摐* depicts tall and dense growth.
The fourth is the lower emolument, occurring at night.
The petty person’s resolve to retreat is not steadfast; encountering fine emoluments, they halt and do not depart, thus not escaping calamity.

**Fifth, Seeing the *Zhuàn* in the Forest, the Otter Enters the Abyss—an Auspicious Omen.**
The **Zè** says: Seeing the *Zhuàn* and the otter—deep retreat from disaster.
The **Fàn** text reads *鹭* as *鹭*, while the **King’s** text reads *鹭*; here, we follow the **Song** and **Lù** texts.
The **King’s** text reads *利征* for *征*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** texts.
*Zhuàn* is the ancient character for *年*; another reading is *鹰*.
*Zhuàn* is pronounced *cí-xù* (慈恤).
The **Song** says: *Zhuàn* harms birds; the otter harms fish.
The **Wú** says: *Zhuàn*—to tread.
The **Guāng** says: The fifth is the middle emolument, occurring in daylight.
Though the **Junzi** holds a high position and enjoys rich emoluments, seeing petty men wielding power in court and knowing they will bring chaos, they depart.

**Sixth, Many Fields but No Harvest, Exhausting My Labor.**
The **Zè** says: Many fields but no harvest—labor is spent in vain.
The **Song** and **Lù** texts read *会* for *费*; here, we follow the **Fàn** and **King’s** texts.
*功* is pronounced *hù-jiā* (户佳).
The **Fàn** says: *Who will eat?* is *功*.

The **King** says: The sixth hexagram, when overfull, loses its position at night, and does not know how to escape appropriately.

If one cultivates fields in the hexagram of Many Fields, yet does not manage them properly, only consuming food and labor without benefit.

The **Guāng** says: The sixth hexagram is the highest emolument, representing abundance and extremity, yet it occurs at night.

The petty man’s virtue is thin though his position is high, his strength is little though his responsibilities are heavy. Though he may possess abundant resources, he cannot govern them well—accomplished men all abandon him and flee, consuming food and labor in vain. How could he achieve success?

**Seventh, Seen in Bonds, Only Then Able to Fly.**
The **Zè** says: Seen in bonds—almost not enough to rise high.

*Jǐ*, pronounced *jī* (as in *jì*).
The **Song** says: *Jǐ* means "near."

Already seen in bonds, barely escaping, this is why it is said to be near. The **King** says: In times of fleeing danger, the seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity—one who flees only after the time has passed, hence "seen in bonds."

Yet when in position during the day, one can preserve ultimate well-being, hence "only then able to fly," escaping his misfortune.

The **Junzi**, though entangled in constraints, does not dwell in a chaotic realm. Ultimately, he must withdraw and distance himself, hence "only then able to fly."

**Eighth, The Neck Added to the Snare, Bound by Its Cord.**
The **Zè** says: The neck added to the snare—no self-effort remains.

The **King** says: *Měng*, the same as *yì* (wing).
The eighth hexagram loses its position at night, unable to avoid misfortune, hence the head is caught in the snare.

Though it flaps its wings within the net, there is no possibility of flight. The **Guāng** says: *Měng* is the arrow used in hunting.

The eighth hexagram is the midpoint of calamity, occurring at night, unable to flee far from disaster. The snare is already on the neck—though it struggles and tugs at the cord, how could it escape? Only self-exhaustion remains.

**Ninth, It is advantageous to flee, limping and halting; the thief’s virtue clings to the city.**
The **Zè** says: The thief’s virtue clings to the city—why flee at all?
The **King**’s text reads *virtue-thief*, the small **Song** text reads *thief-obtains*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** texts.

The **Chén** says: *Pǐ*, pronounced *píng* (as in *bīng*), also *pú-xián* (蒲贤).
The **Zìshū** says: *Pǐ* means hardened calloused skin.

Two regions, three states, two departments, two families of the Tang dynasty—**Yīn** family earth—also corresponds to *dùn* (遁).

**Lù says:** The *Táng* is a great dispersion—all under Heaven flee.
Flee is also dispersion.
**Guāng says:** *Táng* is like *dàngdàng*—unrestrained, with the sense of loss.
Yin-qi comes here, Yang-qi departs—things sway *dàngdàng*.
**Sòng says:** *Zī* means "to augment."
**Lù says:** *Dàngdàng* is the appearance of emptiness exhausted.

**First (crawl):** *Táng* within—do not act; perilous.
**Cè says:** *Táng* within—no steadfastness.
One is the beginning of thought, yet it falls to night.
Within, there is nothing to hold—movement brings danger.

**Second (treading):** *Táng* in darkness—advantageous to use eastward campaigning.
**Cè says:** The advantage of *Táng* in darkness is to seek the Bright Way.
Darkness is obscurity.
East is where the sun rises.
Two is the middle of thought, dwelling in the lower body’s depths—thus *Táng* in darkness.
Its heart is swaying, lost in where to go.
Yet in the sun’s day, the superior person seeks the Bright Way to advance himself.

**Third (abrupt):** *Táng* in whiteness—untrue, losing *lónglíng*.
**Cè says:** Losing *lónglíng*—not yours to lose.
**Wáng says:** *Lónglíng*—the sound of jade.

**Fourth (youthful):** *Táng* without destination—Dao and virtue as refuge.
**Cè says:** *Táng* without destination—only virtue grants.
Destination—*dīnglì* (丁历) cut, same below.
Refuge—*bìyì* (必益) cut.
Grant—*yúlǚ* (余吕) cut.
**Wáng says:** Four obtains position in daylight, fitting *Táng*’s nature—swaying, without destination or refusal, taking Dao and virtue as refuge.
Knowing where to go—*Táng*’s excellence.
Refuge—lord.
**Guāng says:** Destination—inevitability.
Four is smooth and flourishing, yet in daylight.
Confucius said: The superior person in the world has no fixed destination, no refusal—only virtue aligns with him.
Thus it says *Dao and virtue as refuge*—speaking of its highest eminence.

**Fifth (dashing):** Fleeing deer, cradling the shrew—gain not even *zī*.
**Cè says:** Fleeing deer, cradling the shrew—insufficient achievement.
**Fàn, Wáng** texts read *xīzúgōng* (奚足功), now following **Sòng, Lù** texts.
**Wú says:** *Qú* (鼷)—*hùjī* (户鸡) cut, a small mouse.
**Wáng says:** Five occupies the peak position, should be the leader, yet loses position at night.
Without the virtue of lordship, swaying and unguarded, confused between profit and harm.
Chasing deer in flight, yet turning to the shrew-mouse—what is gained is insufficient as provision.
*Zī*—same as *zī* (资).

**Sixth (gentle):** *Táng* not self-sufficient—substituting Heaven’s rank and rewards.
**Cè says:** *Táng* not self-sufficient—no private capacity.
**Wáng says:** Obtains position in daylight, as *Táng*’s lord—swaying, without private gain, not seeking self-sufficiency, sharing Heaven’s blessings with all—thus able to substitute Heaven in bestowing rank and rewards.
A sage ruler in his time, dwelling in *Táng*’s excellence—none surpasses this.
**Guāng says:** Six is upper reward, abundant and flourishing, yet in daylight.
The superior person does not monopolize Heaven’s blessings but shares them with all worthy.

**Seventh (oppressing):** Hunt the three flights—brightly manifest in campaigning, yet all day not returning—lost.
**Cè says:** Hunt the three flights—destination without guidance.
**Wáng says:** Dwelling in excess, yet losing position at night.
Unclear in the Way, self-inflicting peril and ruin.
Like hunting one flight yet seeking three—nowhere to turn.
Self-illuminated yet wandering until evening, swaying and confused—what good remains?
**Guāng says:** Seven is lost aspiration, yet at night.
The petty man wavers in virtue, losing this for that, swaying without steadfastness, laboring in vain.
From youth to old age, ultimately gaining nothing.

**Eighth (binding):** *Táng* collects rewards—spirit of the community halts its weeping, some receive their *mù*.
**Cè says:** *Táng* collects rewards—yet again lost.
*Fù*—*fúmù* (符目) cut, same below.
**Wáng says:** Obtains position in daylight, skilled in *Táng*’s Way—thus able to reclaim its rewards.
**Guāng says:** Eight is calamity’s midpoint, yet fortune and rewards have scattered.
Yet in the sun’s day, able to revive decline and restore ruin—thus *Táng* collects rewards.
The spirits of land and grain, once more receiving blood-sacrifice, thus halt their weeping.
The people, already withered, yet again receive nourishment—thus some receive their *mù*.

**Ninth (shedding):** Bright pearl shot at flying flesh—what is gained does not compensate.
**Cè says:** Bright pearl shot at flesh—expenditure unmatched.
*Dàng*—*dīnglàng* (丁浪) cut.
**Fàn says:** Flying flesh—birds and owls.
The pearl is heavy, the owl light—seeking the light with the heavy, thus no compensation.
**Wáng says:** Nine occupies the extreme peak, yet loses position at night—swaying, heard in the great reckoning.
Like shooting a pearl at a sparrow—what is gained does not replace what is lost.
**Guāng says:** Nine is calamity’s extremity, yet at night.
The petty man indulges desires to excess, swaying and forgetful.

Two regions, three states, two departments, three families—constant.
**Yáng** family water—corresponds to *héng* (恒).

「Entering the *Cháng* (常) phase, the twenty-third day of the twenty-sixth degree—*Lìqiū* (立秋) aligns with the *qi* (气). The day corresponds to **Qúntǎo** (鹑尾), the **Fùxiàng** (斗) constellation marks the **Shēn** (申) position, and the **Yízhé** (夷则) musical pitch resonates.

**Ninth (shedding):** The day relinquishes its **Yì** (翼).
By **Yīn** (阴) one discerns the **Bì** (辟) [as **Bì**, pronounced *bì*, or "wall"#17], by **Yáng** (阳) one discerns the **Jūn** (君) [as "sovereign"].
The **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) [as "minister"] **Dao** (道) is immutable across the ten thousand ages.
**Bì** (辟), when read as **Jūn** (君), is "sovereign."

**Song** (宋) says: **Bì** (辟) is the **Jūn** (君).
This is the beginning of **Lìqiū** (立秋).
As autumn succeeds summer, it is the **Dao** (道) of Heaven.
Thus at this time, **Yīn** (阴) knows to serve as **Chén** (臣), **Yáng** (阳) knows to act as **Jūn** (君).
**Guāng** (光) says: As autumn succeeds summer, as **Yīn** (阴) succeeds **Yáng** (阳), as **Chén** (臣) succeeds **Jūn** (君)—this is the symbol.

**First (day):** Wearing the **Dàishén** (戴神) [as "donning the divine"] **Mò** (墨) [as "black ink"], stepping on the **Lǚlíng** (履灵) [as "treading the sacred"] **Shì** (式) [as "pattern"], with one to govern ten thousand, yet never failing in **Wú** (吴) [as "harmony"].
**Cè** (测) says: Wearing **Dàishén** (戴神) **Mò** (墨) is to embody one form.
**Wáng** (王) and **Wú** (吴) both say: **Jì** (稷) is the same as **Wú** (吴).
**Mò** (墨) and **Shì** (式) are both **Fǎ** (法) [as "principles"]—the **Shén** (神) and **Líng** (灵) [as "divine and numinous"] are revered.
One is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs during the day.
The **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as "noble one"]’s heart clings to one principle as the constant **Fǎ** (法), responding to all transformations of the ten thousand things, yet never lacking in **Wú** (吴) [as "harmony"].
The *Yì* (易) [as *Book of Changes*] says: "All movement under Heaven is governed by steadfast adherence to the One."
**Second (day):** The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微) [as "subtle"], **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) [as "female steadfastness"] **Lì** (厉) [as "perilous"].
**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微), the **Nǚ** (女) [as "female"] is not steadfast.
**Wáng** (王) originally wrote **Chángnèi** (常内) **Wēi** (微), but now follows the other schools.
**Wáng** (王) says: During the **Cháng** (常) phase, one should uphold the proper **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣), **Fùfù** (夫妇) [as "husband and wife"].
The second day loses its position at night#18—this is the **Cháng** (常) phase subtly yielding to a lowly **Nǚ** (女) [as "female"] within.
The symbol of unsteadfastness is near danger, hence **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) **Lì** (厉) [as "perilous"].

**Third (day):** The day upholds its **Dé** (德) [as "virtue/power"], three years without eating.
**Cè** (测) says: The day upholds its **Dé** (德), the **Jūn** (君)’s **Dao** (道) is clear.
Three is self-so, yet it occurs during the day.
The day upholds its **Dé** (德), thus escaping the calamity of meager nourishment.
The **Jūn** (君) upholds his **Dé** (德), thus avoiding the guilt of reckless usurpation.
**Yīyǐn** (伊尹) admonished **Tàijiǎ** (太甲), composing the *Xián yǒu yī Dé* (咸有一德).

**Fourth (day):** The month does not uphold, sometimes losing it in **Xíng** (行) [as "conduct"].
**Cè** (测) says: The month does not uphold, the **Chén** (臣) loses his **Xíng** (行).
**Xíng** (行) is read as it is written.
The month has waxing and waning, hence it does not uphold.
**Xíng** (行) is the **Dao** (道).
Four is **Wàitā** (外佗) [as "external excess"], yet it occurs at night.
If the **Chén** (臣)’s **Dé** (德) is not constant, he loses the **Dao** (道).

**Fifth (day):** Its **Cóng** (从) [as "following"] and its **Héng** (横) [as "crossing"], the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth.
**Cè** (测) says: Its **Cóng** (从) and its **Héng** (横) are the constants of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣).
**Cóng** (从), pronounced *róng* (容).
**Fàn** (范) says: Heaven follows Earth’s crossing—this is their constant **Dao** (道).
**Wáng** (王) says: The fifth day occupies the middle position, as the master of **Cháng** (常).
Obtaining its position during the day, it follows and crosses the **Jīngwéi** (经纬) [as "vertical and horizontal principles"], all in accord with the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth, attaining the immutable **Dao** (道) across the ten thousand ages.
**Guāng** (光) says: Five is the **Zhōnghé** (中和) [as "central harmony"], the peak of **Cháng** (常).
The **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) is their **Jīngwéi** (经纬).

**Sixth (day):** Obtaining seven and nine, the **nuò** (懦) [as "weak"] and **náo** (挠) [as "flexible"] overcome the **gāng** (刚) [as "rigid"], unable to uphold the **Cháng** (常).
**Cè** (测) says: Obtaining seven and nine is to abandon **Shèng** (盛) [as "peak"] and ride upon **Cuī** (衰) [as "decline"].
Seven is the peak of **Yáng** (阳).
Nine is the decline of **Yáng** (阳).
The sixth day passes the middle and occurs at night—abandoning peak and riding decline.
The petty man is weak, bending and corrupting his rigidity, unable to guard his constant **Dao** (道).

**Seventh (day):** **Tāotāo** (滔滔) [as "flowing"] **wǎnglái** (往来) [as "movement"], with **Cháng** (常) decline as **Rú** (如) [as "pattern"], able to uphold the **Zhēn** (贞) [as "steadfast"].
**Cè** (测) says: **Tāotāo** (滔滔) **wǎnglái** (往来) is to uphold the proper **Dao** (道) in response to the improper.

**Eighth (day):** The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) [as "illness"] yet not **Jí** (疾), the **jiù** (咎) [as "fault"] is formed yet not **Jí** (诘) [as "rectified"].
**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) yet not **Jí** (疾)—it cannot self-govern.
Eight is the midpoint of calamity, yet it occurs at night.
The **Cháng** (常) **Dao** (道), long practiced, now has weariness—hence **Chángjí** (常疾).
If one who is ill knows his illness, it may still be treated.
If one does not know his illness yet abhors hearing of it#20, then it is certainly incurable#21.
The petty man does not know his calamity yet abhors hearing of it, until the **xiōngjiù** (凶咎) [as "grievous fault"] is formed#22—it cannot be rectified again.

**Upper Ninth (day):** **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾), **Wūyī** (巫医) [as "diviners and healers"] do not fail.
**Cè** (测) says: **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾)—able to self-heal.
**Wáng** (王) says: The ninth day occupies the extreme peak, yet obtains its position during the day—one who can **Jí** (疾) his **Jí** (疾).
Good at self-admonition, thus the **Wūyī** (巫医) [as "diviners and healers"] do not fail in treating him.
**Wūyī** (巫医) refers to wise counselors.
**Guāng** (光) says: The ninth is the end of calamity, yet it occurs during the day.
The **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as "noble one"] can reflect on misfortune and preemptively guard against it, receiving loyal advice and seeking wise counsel to aid himself—thus calamity may be resolved.

Two regions, three states, three departments, one family—**Dù** (度) [as "measure"].
**Yīn** (阴) family **Huǒ** (火) [as "fire"], corresponds to **Jié** (节) [as "regulation"].
**Fǎ** (法) [as "principles"] serve as models, **Dù** (度) [as "measure"] serves as the standard.
**Yīn** (阴) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Zào** (躁) [as "agitated"], **Yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Shě** (舍) [as "retreating"].
**Zào** (躁) and **Zào** (躁) **Shě** (舍) and **Shě** (舍), each attains its **Dù** (度).
**Shě** (舍), pronounced *shě*, or read as it is written.
**Sòng** (宋) says: **Zào** (躁), movement.
**Shě** (舍), concealment.
**Wáng** (王) says: **Shě** (舍), cessation.
**Guāng** (光) says: **Zào** (躁) refers to **Yīn** (阴) advancing in vigor.
**Shě** (舍) refers to **Yáng** (阳) withdrawing.
The **Zào** (躁) grows more **Zào** (躁), the **Shě** (舍) grows more **Shě** (舍)—each guards its constant **Dù** (度).

**First (day):** The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost.
**Cè** (测) says: The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost—it cannot achieve success.
One is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs at night.
The petty man’s measure in the heart has already strayed and been lost—how could he achieve success?
The *Shāngshū* (商书) [as *Book of Documents*] says: "If one anticipates danger and sets traps, then going to inspect and rectify according to **Dù** (度) will release [the situation]."

**Second (day):** The **Zé** (泽) [as "benefits"] does not **Shě** (舍) [as "retreat"], **Míng** (冥) [as "obscure"] within the **Dù** (度).
**Cè** (测) says: The **Zé** (泽) does not **Shě** (舍)—only then can it be proper.

**Third (day):** The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差) [as "erratic"], the **Dà** (大) **Lǎi** (攋) [as "collapse"] is the stage.
**Cè** (测) says: The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差), the great **Dù** (度) is **Qīng** (倾) [as "tilting"].
Small **Sòng** (宋), **Chén** (陈), and **Wú** (吴) manuscripts originally read **Tā** (獭) [as "otter"], but **Wáng** (王) read **Qīng** (倾), and now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts.
**Fàn** (范) manuscripts read **Chāchā** (差差) as **Zhīchā** (之差), but now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts.
**Lǎi** (攋), pronounced *lài* (赖).
**Guāng** (光) says: **Lǎi** (攋) is "ruin and fracture"#28.

The **Third (day)** is the completion of thought, and the time is night.
Thought not in accord with **Dù** (度) will lead to erratic and failed matters.
Hence it is said: Small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差), the great **Lǎi** (攋) is the stage of ruin—
for though what is lost may be small, what is destroyed will be great.

**Fourth (day):** **Gànzhēng** (干桢), advantageous for city construction.
**Cè** (测) says: The advantage of **Gànzhēng** (干桢) lies in its **jīngyíng** (经营).
The **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts read *gān* (干) as *gàn* (干#29); now follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lǚ** (陆) manuscripts.
The **Fourth (day)** is the bestowal of blessings below, and the time is day.
When the **junzi** (君子) has attained his station,
he must always use **fǎdù** (法度) as his **Gànzhēng** (干桢),
thus he can safeguard his people and undertake great **jīngyíng** (经营).

**Fifth (day):** **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干), ruin to his undertakings.
**Cè** (测) says: **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干) means he cannot have peace.
**Wáng** (王) says: One who has lost his station at night cannot be the leader of the people.
A **cái** (才) that is **Gàn** (干) yet not truly **Gàn** (干) will inevitably topple all he has undertaken.
**Guāng** (光) says: A man who lacks **Dù** (度) leaves the people without order—
just as **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干) will destroy what he has undertaken, bringing no stability.

**Sixth (day):** Great **Dù** (度) **jiǎnjiǎn** (检检), manifesting **xiàng** (象) to Heaven, and setting its standard.
**Cè** (测) says: Great **Dù** (度) **jiǎnjiǎn** (检检) is the **chéngxiàng** (垂象) of rectitude.
**Fàn** (范), same as **Fàn** (范).
**Wáng** (王) says: The **Sixth (day)**, occupying the most exalted position,
is the greatest **Dù** (度)—one who attains his station at day.
He who is clear in **fǎzhì** (法制) and uses **Dù** (度) to examine things
will take Heaven’s **xiàng** (象) and set its **fǎ** (法) for the world.
**Guāng** (光) says: The **junzi**’s establishment of **fǎdù** (法度)
is not drawn from his own heart.
Instead, he observes **xiàng** (象) in Heaven
to set a standard for the world,
hence it is said: Heaven demonstrates **xiàng** (象), and it sets its standard.
The *Yì* (易) says: Heaven demonstrates **xiàng** (象), the sage follows it.

**Seventh (day):** Without **Dù** (度), **guī** (规) is not applied—ghosts will mock it.
**Cè** (测) says: Without **Dù** (度), **guī** (规) is not applied—ghosts will laugh and ridicule.
**Zǐ** (訾), pronounced *zhǐ* (紫), also read as *jí* (即) *yí* (移).
**Wáng** (王) says: The **Seventh (day)**, residing in excess,
loses its station at night—hence it is not **Dù** (度).
**Dù** (度) is the one who establishes **guīzhì** (规制).
**Zǐ** (訾) is mockery and ridicule.

「Praise says: Ghosts mock, *Cè* says: Those who keenly observe.
The **幽明** (Yōumíng—"dark and bright," i.e., the unseen and the seen) share in laughter,
hence the parallel phrasing reveals its meaning.

**Guāng** (光) says: The **Seventh (day)**, marked by ruin and decay, falls at night.
The **xiǎorén** (小人—"petty/ignoble person") grows arrogant and extravagant,
not restraining himself by **fǎdù** (法度—"law and measure"),
so the ghosts mock and ridicule him, and disaster will befall him.

Those who keenly observe—none surpass the ghosts.
Among the foolish of humanity, some may not yet know it,
but the ghosts first perceive the coming calamity.

**Eighth (day):** The **stone** (石) does not lose its **chì** (赤—"redness"),
a steadfast person’s essential virtue.

**Cè** (测) says: The **stone** (石) does not lose its **chì** (赤—"redness"),
and thus one may entrust him with great matters.

**Yào** (要), pronounced as *yáo* (一遥切).
**Fàn** (范) says: The stone cannot lose its firmness,
the cinnabar cannot lose its redness.

**Wáng** (王) says: The **Eighth (day)**, at the end of **Dù** (度—"measure"),
secures its station at dawn—one who must uphold his **Dù** (度—"measure")
and never alter it.

**Guāng** (光) says: **Yào** (要) means "to bind by agreement."
The **Eighth (day)**, though in the midst of disaster, stands at dawn.
The **junzi** (君子), even amid calamity and chaos,
does not change his **Dù** (度—"measure"),
holding fast to his resolve with unyielding clarity—
unmovable, unshakable.
Hence, one may make a binding agreement with him,
saying: "To entrust him with a hundred *lǐ* (里—"li, a unit of distance") of command,
to place him as guardian of the six *chǐ* (尺—"feet") of an orphan."

**Ninth (day):** The **accumulation of errors** (积差) is forgiven,
yet ten years pass without return.

**Cè** (测) says: The **accumulation of errors** (积差) is forgiven,
but no further progress can be made.

**Fàn** (范) originally wrote "difference" (差) as "goodness" (善),
but now follows the readings of the *Èr Sòng* (二宋—"Two Song editions"),
*Lù* (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.
The **Wáng** (王) edition writes "ten" (十) as "seven" (七),
but now follows the consensus of other editions.
**Lù** (陆) says: **Zào** (造) means "to reach/attain."
**Wáng** (王) says: At the extreme of **Dù** (度—"measure"),
losing its station at night—one who has utterly abandoned **Dù** (度—"measure").
He accumulates his errors and deviations,
gradually drifting farther astray.
"Forgiven" (贷) means leniency and delay,
coming too late in time.
Though seven years may pass—how long!—
his **Dù** (度—"measure") can never be restored.

**Guāng** (光) says: "Forgiven" (贷) should be read as *tuōdé* (吐得切),
same as **tè** (忒—"exceedingly, overly"),
the utmost degree of error.
The *Yì* (易) says: "To return in confusion is inauspicious."
Even ten years of campaigning cannot conquer it.
The two **Sòng** (宋) editions, **Lù** (陆), **Fàn** (范), and **Wáng** (王)
all liken it to the **Héng** (恒—"constancy") hexagram.
**Wú** (吴) says: "Constant head" (常首),
likening it to the **Héng** (恒—"constancy") hexagram.

The **Seventh (day)**, marking the start of autumn.
**First (day):** Corresponds to the **226th day**,
advancing the **Yì** (翼—"auxiliary") by **15°**,
aligning with the **Héng** (恒—"constancy") hexagram in the *Yì* (易) for the day's significance.
**Fourth (day):** The next **auxiliary** (翼), likening it to the **Jié** (节—"propriety") hexagram.
**First (day):** Having already advanced **Yì** (翼—"auxiliary") by **2°**,
now reaching **Yǒng** (永—"enduring").

The **Seventh (day)**, corresponds to the **238th day**,
advancing **Yì** (翼—"auxiliary") by **9°**,
aligning with the **Tóngrén** (同人—"harmony with others") hexagram in the *Yì* (易) for the day's significance.
Now following this.

**Yīn** (阴—"dark, feminine, passive") uses **wǔ** (武—"martial, force") to take,
**Yáng** (阳—"bright, masculine, active") uses **wén** (文—"cultural, refinement") to give.
The **Dao** (道—"Way") may endure forever.

**Sòng** (宋) says: **Yīn** (阴—"dark, feminine, passive") is the **qì** (气) of punishment,
hence it is spoken of in terms of **wǔ** (武—"martial, force").
**Yáng** (阳—"bright, masculine, active") is the **qì** (气) of **virtue/power** (德),
hence it is spoken of in terms of **wén** (文—"cultural, refinement").
**Wǔ** (武—"martial, force") supplements **wén** (文—"cultural, refinement"),
and **wén** (文—"cultural, refinement") supplements **wǔ** (武—"martial, force"),
the **Dao** (道—"Way") of **yīn** (阴) and **yáng** (阳) in taking and giving—
hence its **Dao** (道—"Way") can endure forever.

**First (day):** Without **tì** (替—"replacement") or **shuàng** (爽—"freshness, clarity"),
the enduring principle of the eldest son.

**Cè** (测) says: Without **tì** (替—"replacement") or **shuàng** (爽—"freshness, clarity"),
it is the eternal continuation of the **Dao** (道—"Way").

**Wáng** (王) edition writes **tì** (替) as **lì** (历—"to pass through"),
saying it is an ancient **jiàn** (僭—"usurp") character,
but now follows the readings of **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Fàn** (范) editions.
**Cháng** (长), pronounced as *zhīzàng* (知丈切).
**Yǒng** (永) means "long-lasting, enduring,"
having the symbol of succession.
**Tì** (替) means "to abandon, to discard."
On the first day of dawn, one who attains the **Dao** (道—"Way") of endurance.

The **institutions of the ancient kings** (先王之制),
establishing the **dí** (嫡—"legitimate heir") to endure,
to secure the **Zōngmiào** (宗庙—"ancestral temples") and **chóngshèjì** (社稷—"altars of soil and grain"),
without replacement or loss of clarity—
the eternal law for ten thousand generations.
No **Dao** (道—"Way") of endurance surpasses this.

**Second (day):** Harboring within himself **tì** (替—"replacement") and **shuàng** (爽—"freshness, clarity"),
he will forever lose the **Zhēnxiáng** (贞祥—"auspicious virtue").

**Cè** (测) says: Harboring within himself **tì** (替—"replacement") and **shuàng** (爽—"freshness, clarity"),
how can such stability endure?
On the second day, at night, he loses the **Dao** (道—"Way") of endurance.

A **confused and deluded ruler** (昏惑之君),
violating propriety by favoring a concubine,
replacing the legitimate heir with a bastard,
harbors within himself the **qì** (气) of **tì** (替—"replacement") and **shuàng** (爽—"freshness, clarity").
If he treats his eldest son in this manner,
he will forever lose the **Dao** (道—"Way") of upright goodness.

**Third (day):** Enduring his **Dao** (道—"Way"),
yet still without blame.

**Cè** (测) says: Enduring his **Dao** (道—"Way"),
truly it may be preserved.
The **Third (day)**, marking the completion of intention,
stands at dawn.
The **junzi** (君子) has already established his **Dao** (道—"Way") and deeds,
yet has not yet ascended to fortune and rank.
If the **junzi** does not fear lack of position,
but fears how he establishes himself,
constantly renewing his **Dao** (道—"Way"),
enduring without weariness—
though he may not yet attain blessings and prosperity,
what blame is there?

**Fourth (day):** The son does not follow his proper order,
the guest precedes, and the host forever loses his rightful place.

**Cè** (测) says: The son does not follow his proper order,
this is not the **Dao** (道—"Way") of endurance.
**Wáng** (王) says: The **Fourth (day)**, near the **Fifth (day)**,
yet occupies a **yīn** (阴—"dark, feminine, passive") position in **yáng** (阳—"bright, masculine, active"),
and falls at night—
he loses the **Dao** (道—"Way") of what may endure.
If the son does not occupy his proper place in order,
then sacrifices and guests will forever lack a host.
Hence, the guest precedes, and the host forever loses his rightful place.

**Fifth (day):** The **three bonds** (三纲) are attained at the central peak,
Heaven forever grants its blessings.

**Cè** (测) says: The endurance of the **three bonds** (三纲),
its **Dao** (道—"Way") is long.
**Wáng** (王) says: Occupying the center and embodying correctness,
as the head of the household,
securing his station at dawn,
possessing the **virtue/power** (德) of a ruler—
he can make the **three bonds** (三纲) all attain their proper place within him.
Heaven aids him, hence his blessings endure forever.

**Guāng** (光) says: The **three bonds** (三纲) are:
the ruler as the bond for his subjects,
the father as the bond for his children,
the husband as the bond for his wife.
The **Fifth (day)**, marking central harmony,
stands at dawn.
The ruler establishes the **three bonds** (三纲) to found the **Huángjí** (皇极—"Supreme Polarity"),
forever preserving Heaven’s blessings.

**Sixth (day):** Greatly enduring in blessings,
he reverses the **empty court** (虚庭),
entering the **dark obscurity** (酋冥).

**Cè** (测) says: Greatly enduring in blessings,
blessings turn to ruin.
**Fàn** (范) edition writes "entering the **dark obscurity** (入于酋冥)" as "entering the **obscurity** (入酋冥)",
the *Xiǎo Sòng* (小宋—"Lesser Song") edition reads "at the **obscurity** (於酋冥)",
but now follows the readings of **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.
The **Sixth (day)**, exceeding the center and falling at night.
The **xiǎorén** (小人—"petty/ignoble person"), relying on the endurance of blessings,
becomes proud and licentious, boastful and arrogant.
When blessings reach their end, disaster follows.
Hence, he reverses the **empty court** (虚庭),
speaking of gaining nothing.
Entering the **dark obscurity** (酋冥),
speaking of his ignorance of remorse and fear—
once disaster has already befallen,
he reaches the utmost of **obscurity** (冥).

**Seventh (day):** The **old wood** (老木) produces shade,
enduring its own form.

「**Kūn** (昆—"to gather/cluster"), pronounced *shì lì* (时吏切).
**King Wén** (王) says: The seventh hexagram marks the completion of the **Kūn** cycle, its symbol being **old wood** (老木).

Yet when it holds its position during the day, it attains the **perfecting Dao** (永道), hence it generates **Kūn** (莳).
**Kūn** (莳) refers to the **lateral growth** (旁生) of planting.
Once it bears **blossoms and leaves** (华叶), it further attains **prolonged duration** (长久),
beginning with **nothingness** (无今有), hence it is said to **entwine what does not exist** (缠其所无).

**Eighth (day):** The **perfecting Dao** (永) lacks **proper measure** (轨),
and **disaster** (凶亡) ensues, flowing onward to the future.
**Zhōu** (测) says: The **perfecting Dao** lacking **proper measure** (永不轨),
its **fate is exhausted** (命剂).
**Jì** (剂), pronounced *cái zhì* (才诣切).
**Sòng** (宋) says: **Jì** (剂) means **to trim** (翦).
**King Wén** says: Dwelling in the position of **extremity** (极之位),
while the **yin** (阴) occupies the **yang** time (阳时) and it is night—
this is an act where the **perfecting Dao** (永) does not follow **proper measure** (法).
How much less can it avoid bringing **disaster** (凶亡) to itself alone?
The **disaster** (凶亡) will then **flow into the future** (流于后).

**Guāng** (光) says: The eighth hexagram is the **midpoint of calamity** (祸中),
and it falls at night.
The **petty/ignoble person** (小人) persistently acts without **proper measure** (不法).
Once his body meets **disaster** (凶亡), the **remaining misfortunes** (余殃) will **flow into the future** (流后).

**Uppermost ninth (day):** The **perfecting Dao** (永) concludes with **docile submission** (驯首).
**Zhōu** says: The **perfecting Dao** concluding with **docile submission** (永终驯首),
this is the **enduring virtue of harmony** (长恺悌).
**Xún** (驯) means **to comply** (顺).
**Kǎi** (恺) means **joy** (乐).
**Tì** (悌) means **ease** (易).
The ninth line, at the **end of the perfecting Dao** (永终), falls during the day.
The **Dao of the noble person** (君子之道) is **enduring, joyful, and easy** (永长乐易),
and he **treats the end as the beginning** (慎终如首若一).
Thus, the **perfecting Dao** is **fulfilled** (全).

---
**The two directions, three regions, three divisions, and three families** (二方三州三部三家) **all gather** (昆).
**Kūn** (昆), pronounced *hù gǔn* (户衮切), or as the character itself.
**Yin-family metal** (阴家金) also aligns with **the people** (同人).
**Lù** (陆) says: **Kūn** (昆) also means **to align** (同).
The **yin** (阴) is about to **depart** (离), while the **yang** (阳) still **gathers** (昆).
The **Dao of gathering** (昆道) still aligns.

**Sòng** (宋) says: The **yin-qi** (阴气) is about to **kill** (杀),
hence it **departs and scatters all things** (离散万物).
The **yang-qi** (阳气) is about to **converge** (藏),
hence all things **return and align** (同归).
**King Wén** says: The **yin-qi** (阴气) governs **killing** (杀),
and it **departs from all things** (离万物).
The **yang-qi** (阳气) embodies **benevolence and love** (仁爱),
still **gathering and aligning** (犹尚昆而同之).

**First (day):** **Gathering in darkness** (昆于黑),
he does not know **light** (白).
**Zhōu** says: **Gathering in darkness** (昆于黑),
this is not to be called a **person** (人).
**Sòng** says: **White** (白) means **wisdom** (智).
**Black** (黑) means **folly** (愚).
**Guāng** says: **Darkness** (黑) signifies **filth and turbidity** (垢浊),
**light** (白) signifies **purity and integrity** (廉洁).
The first hexagram marks the **beginning of contemplation** (思始),
and it falls at night.
The **petty/ignoble person** (小人) aligns himself with **filth and turbidity** (垢浊),
and does not recognize **purity and integrity** (廉洁) as **beauty** (美).

**Second (day):** **White and black intermingle** (白黑菲菲),
three **beasts** (禽) share one **horn** (角) with **aligned tails** (同尾).
**Zhōu** says: Three **beasts** (禽) sharing one **horn** (角),
this brings no **harm to the heart** (害心).
**Fěi** (菲), pronounced *fū wěi* (敷尾切), is the same as **fěi** (斐).
**King Wén** says: It holds its position during the day.
**White and black intermingling** (白黑菲菲) signifies the **distinction between clarity and obscurity** (分别明白之义).
Three **beasts** (禽) refer to **three people** (三人).
One **horn** (角) with **aligned tails** (同尾) means **beginning and end are all aligned** (终始皆同),
with no **contrariness or divergence** (无乖异).

**Guāng** says: **Intermingling** (菲菲) describes the **appearance of white and black blending** (白黑相杂貌).
A **horn** (角) is what **repels assaults** (拒斗) at the head.
A **tail** (尾) is the **end of the body** (体之终).
The second hexagram marks the **midpoint of contemplation** (思中),
and it falls during the day.
The **noble person** (君子) interacts with others,
**pure yet not piercing** (廉而不刿),
**obscure yet not defiling** (浊而不污).
In **intermingling harmony** (菲菲), they **coexist without disorder** (群居而不乱).
One **horn** (角) signifies **united defense against insult** (共御侮).
**Aligned tails** (同尾) signify **preserving the end** (全其终).

**Confucius** says: The **noble person aligns yet does not conform** (君子和而不同).

**Third (day):** **Gathering in light** (昆于白),
he **loses what does not align with darkness** (失不黑),
with **boundless alignment at the tail** (无际一尾) and **three horns** (三角).
**Zhōu** says: **Gathering in light** (昆白) and **not aligning with darkness** (不黑),
this is **lacking mutual affinity** (不相亲).
The **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) editions read **际** (际) as **chú** (除),
but now follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lù** (陆) editions.

**Fourth (day):** A **bird** (鸟) **entrusts its nest** (托巢) to the **withered grass** (菆),
a **person** (人) **entrusts his life** (寄命) to the **public** (公).
**Zhōu** says: A **bird entrusting its nest** (鸟托巢),
the **public** (公) will have no **poverty** (无贫).
The **Fàn** (范) and **Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) editions read **菆** (菆) as **cóng** (丛),
but now follows the **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.
**Chóu** (菆) is the ancient form of **cóng** (丛).
**Sòng** says: **Public** (公) means **equitable** (均).
**Guāng** says: The **public** (公) embodies the **Dao of great unity** (道大同),
with no **distinction of self and others** (无彼我也).
The fourth hexagram marks the **lower position of gathering** (下禄),
and it falls during the day.
If the **noble person** (君子) can **extend the heart of great unity** (推大同至公之心)
to **treat others** (以待人),
then all will **return and entrust their lives** (皆归往而寄命).
Hence, it is said: The **public** (公) will have no **poverty** (无贫).

**Fifth (day):** The **valley** (谷) **loses its spacing and order** (失疏数),
and the **crowd consumes** (众牦) the **jade** (玉).
**Zhōu** says: The **valley losing its spacing and order** (谷失疏数),
how can it **fulfill its equitable measure** (奚足旬)?
The **Fàn** (范) and **Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) editions read **谷失疏数** (谷失疏数) as **谷不谷** (谷不谷),
**losing its spacing and order** (失疏数).
The **Wáng** (王) edition reads **毂不毂** (毂不毂),
**losing its spacing and order** (失疏数).
Now follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lù** (陆) editions.
**Gǔ** (谷) and **gǔ** (毂) are ancient characters interchangeable.
**Lù** says: **Xún** (旬) means **equitable** (均).
**King Wén** says: The fifth line dwells in the **position of preeminence** (盛位),
and should act as the **master of things** (物主).
Yet the **yang** (阳) occupies the **yin position** (阴位) and it is night—
it does not attain the **Dao of harmonious blending** (混同之道).
The **hub** (毂) is **surrounded by spokes** (为众辐所凑).
Since the fifth line has **lost the Dao** (失道),
it cannot **encompass all things**.
Hence, it is said: The **hub loses its function** (毂不毂).

The **lightness of the crowd’s consumption** (众耗之轻),
when accumulated, becomes **great** (成多),
and will inevitably lead to **the jade being ruined** (毁玉之患),
as when **many mouths melt gold** (众口铄金).

**Guāng** says: The **hub** (毂) receives the **spokes** (辐),
and **spacing and order must be equitable** (疏数必均),
only then can it **rotate and function** (运行).
The fifth line, though a **petty/ignoble person** (小人),
dwells in the **position of preeminence** (盛位).
Without the **heart of great unity** (至公之心),
his **likes and dislikes are private** (好恶任私).
Hence, **slander and deceit** (谗慝) advance together,
and the **crowd consumes the jade** (众牦毁玉).

**Sixth (day):** **Gathering at the well and marketplace** (昆于井市),
**wagons of the same script align on the same tracks** (文车同轨).
**Zhōu** says: **Gathering at the well and marketplace** (昆于井市),
this signifies **unity in rank and order** (同一伦).
The **well and marketplace** (井市) are where **people congregate** (人所聚).
The sixth hexagram marks the **height of abundance** (盛多) during the day.
The **Dao of the noble person** (君子道) is **profound in virtue and abundant** (隆德盛),
and the **four seas converge** (四海会向).
**Script is unified** (书同文), **wagons share the same tracks** (车同轨),
with no **far or near** (无有远迩),
all **blending into one category** (混为一类).

**Seventh (day):** The **cover is lopsided and does not shelter** (盖偏不覆),
the **late rain does not rescue** (晏雨不救).
**Zhōu** says: The **cover is lopsided and does not shelter** (盖偏不覆),
this signifies **virtue not being equitable** (德不均).
**Fù** (覆), pronounced *fū jiù* (敷救切), same below.
**Yàn** (晏), means **late** (晚).
Rain that comes **late** (晚) means
the **young plants flourish** (稚者昌) while the **established ones are harmed** (植者伤).
The seventh hexagram marks **decay and loss** (败损) during the night.
The **petty/ignoble person’s virtue** (小人之德),
cannot achieve **great unity** (大同),
his **intentions are skewed** (用心颇僻),
with **favoritism and prejudice** (有爱有恶).
Like a **lopsided cover** (盖偏),
there will be **things left unsheltered** (物有不覆者).
Like **late rain** (雨晚),
there will be **crops left unrescued** (禾有不救者).

**Eighth (day) and second (day) of Kūn:** **Gathering in peril and adversity** (二昆于危难),
now **turning to shelter and safety** (乃覆之安).
**Zhōu** says: **Safety in peril and adversity** (危难之安),
this is the **fruit of prior benevolence** (素施仁).
The eighth hexagram marks the **midpoint of calamity** (祸中),
**exhaustion and peeling away** (为耗为剥落),
and carries the **symbol of peril and adversity** (有危难之象).

Thus, during the day of **Kūn** (昆),
the **noble person** (君子) naturally practices the **Dao of universal unity** (昆同之道),
spreading **benevolent love** (泛爱) and **embracing the multitude** (容众),
treating all with **equal regard** (一视同仁).
Therefore, in times of **peril and adversity** (危难之际),
he can **shelter and protect** (庇覆於物) all things,
bringing them to **safety and ease** (使之就安).

**Ninth line (day):** **Kūn** at the point of **death** (昆于死),
abandoning the **bandit** (寇) and discarding him.
**Zhōu** says: **Kūn** at death (昆于死),
this is to **abandon one’s own body** (弃厥身).
**遗** (遗), pronounced with the *yǒu* (醉) rhyme.

**King Wáng** (王) says: To **abandon one’s body** (弃身) and **discard the bandit** (遗寇),
this is the **height of misfortune** (凶之甚).
**Guāng** (光) remarks: **Evil deeds differ in kind** (为恶不同),
yet all lead to **chaos and disorder** (同归于乱).
The **ninth line** (九) stands at the **extreme of calamity** (祸极),
and corresponds to the **night** (当夜),
thus bearing this **symbol** (象).

---

**The Fivefold Division of the Day (三方一州一部一家减):**
**Yang** (阳) **family** (家) **Water** (水), **harmonizing with decline** (准损).
**First line (day):** **Decline enters** (入减), **beginning at one** (初一),
forty-one **degrees and seventeen seconds** (分一十七秒),
aligning with the **Lesser Heat** (处暑) **qi** (气).

**Second line (day):** **The day relinquishes its sorrow** (日舍轸).
**Yin** (阴) **qi** (气) **wanes** (息),
**Yang** (阳) **qi** (气) **fades** (消).
When **Yin prevails and Yang wanes** (阴盛阳衰),
all things **grow subtle and faint** (万物以微).
The **King Wáng** (王) text reads: **Yin wanes, Yang fades** (阴息阳消),
while the **minor Sòng** (小宋) text reads: **All Yin wanes** (群阴息),
**Yang fades** (阳气消).
Now following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Fàn** (宋、陆、范) texts.

**First line (day):** **Good decline, no decline** (善减不减),
**obscurity** (冥).
**Zhōu** says: **Good decline, no decline** (善减不减),
this is **constant self-abnegation** (常自冲).
**Lǚ** (陆) says: **Suāng** (冲) means **emptiness** (虚).
**Guāng** (光) remarks: **One** (一) marks **the beginning of reflection** (思始),
yet corresponds to the **day** (当昼).
Constantly **abasing oneself in humility** (自谦冲),
this is **good decline** (善减).
The **self-abased** (自损者),
others **benefit them** (益之),
thus there is **no decline** (不减).
**One** (一) is **lowest of the low** (下下),
**good decline** (善减) as **humility** (谦),
**no decline** (不减) as **benefit** (益),
both rooted in **obscure depths** (冥昧之中),
where **none can see** (人莫得而见),
hence the term **obscure** (冥).

**Second line (day):** **Decline of the heart** (心减),
**self-abased from within** (自中),
to **manifest in form upon the body** (以形于身).
**Zhōu** says: **Decline of the heart, form upon the body** (心减形身),
this is **inner constraint** (困诸中).
The **Sòng and Lǚ** (宋、陆) texts read **form as punishment** (刑),
now following the **Fàn and Wáng** (范、王) texts.

When a person **advances in virtue and cultivates their path** (进德修业),
they must **first strengthen their heart** (必自强於心),
then **display it outwardly** (然后显着於外).
**Two** (二) marks **the midpoint of reflection** (思中),
yet corresponds to the **night** (当夜).
**Intent** (志) **declines first** (先减矣),
how then can **virtue and deeds** (德业) **increase** (何从而益)?
This is **constraint from within** (是其中先自困).

The **Master** (子) said to **Rǎn Qiú** (冉求):
*"Those lacking strength* (力不足者),
*fail midway* (中道而废),
*yet you persist in your designs.*" (今汝画)

**Third line (day):** **Decline in one’s bearing** (减其仪),
**advantageous to use brightness** (利用光) **on the steps** (于阶).

「The **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining in one’s bearing** (减其仪) is **self-restraint** (欲自禁也).
**Three** (三) marks the **interaction between lower and upper** (下上),
**the culmination of reflection** (思终),
**and the advancement of the people** (进人).
Residing in the upper position **brings excess pride and arrogance** (则多骄盈),
**culminating in reflection** (思终) **manifests outwardly** (形於外#2).
When one’s bearing is declined, it is **self-deprecation and restraint** (自贬损，禁约也).
The **steps** (阶#3) are **the means of advancement** (所以进也#4).
Through self-deprecation yet attaining advancement, there is **radiance and splendor** (有光辉也).

**Fourth line (day):** **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾),
**lowering one’s station** (贬其位).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾) is **unfit to govern the multitude** (无以莅众也).
The **Fàn** (范) text renders 艾 as 乂, now following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Wáng** (宋、陆、王) texts.
艾 and 乂 share the same pronunciation.
**Fàn** (范) states: 乂 is **governance** (治也#5).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **Four** (四) represents **lowering in fortune** (下禄),
yet corresponds to the **day** (当昼).
The **petty person** (小人) who **lacks diligence in governance** (不勤於为治),
**cannot govern the multitude** (无以临众#6),
and thus **cannot preserve their station** (则不能保其禄位矣).
Hence it is said: **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾),
**lowering one’s station** (贬其位).

**Fifth line (day):** **Declining the yellow constancy** (减黄贞),
**the lower supporting the upper** (下承于上),
**tranquility** (宁).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining the yellow constancy** (减黄贞) is **the proper way of the subject** (臣道丁也).
The **Fàn** (范) text reads **declining its yellow constancy** (减其黄贞),
now following the other texts.
**Sòng** (宋) states: 丁 means **appropriate** (当也).
**Wáng** (王) says: **One attains station during the day** (得位当昼),
**able to decline in serving the master** (能为减主),
**and also gains the central yellow** (又得黄中),
**the path of upright constancy** (贞正之道),
**where all people converge** (众所咸归),
hence the lower supports the upper, and **tranquility is achieved** (而获安宁之福也).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **Five** (五) is **the peak of harmony** (中和莫盛乎),
hence it is said **yellow** (黄).
**Uprightness in station** (以阳当位) is why it is called **constancy** (贞).
When **prosperity reaches its peak** (夫盛极),
**it must decline** (则衰),
**and decline is inevitable** (不可不减).
If the subject **employs this path to support their superior** (臣用此道以承其上),
then **they may attain their own tranquility** (乃可自安),
hence it is said: **The way of the subject is appropriate** (臣道当也).

**Sixth line (day):** **Gathering in obscurity** (幽阐积),
**neither closed nor spread** (不缄不施),
**unyielding like stone** (石).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **Obscurity not spread** (幽阐不施) is **the waters not level** (泽不平也).
施 is pronounced as **shī** (失豉切).
**Fàn** (范) states: **Six** (六) is **water** (水),
hence **gathering in obscurity** (积幽).
**Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) says: **Great openness is called 阐** (大开曰阐).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **Six** (六) and **the family’s nature** (家性) are both **water** (水),
hence it is said **obscurity** (幽).
**Six** (六) represents **lowering in fortune** (上禄),
hence it is said **阐** (阐).
It also signifies **abundance and extremity** (又为盛多为极大),
hence it is said **gathering** (积).
The **Noble Person** (君子) should **augment the few and diminish the many** (当裒多益寡),
**adjusting to things and spreading evenly** (称物平施).
Now, **neither diminishing nor spreading** (今乃不减不施),
**their obstinacy is like stone** (其顽如石),
hence it is said: **the waters are not level** (泽不平也).

**Seventh line (day):** **Declining their affliction** (减其疾),
**reducing their care** (损其恤),
**harshness does not reach** (厉不至).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining their affliction** (减其疾) is **avoiding peril** (不至危也).
**Fàn** (范) states: **恤** (恤) means **grief** (忧也).
**厉** (厉) means **peril** (危也).
**Wáng** (王) says: **Seven** (七) **resides in overfullness** (居过满),
**the path of peril** (危之道也).
Yet **one attains station during the day** (而得位当昼),
**able to decline their afflictions** (是能自减其疾患),
**reduce their grief** (损其忧戚),
then **harshness has no way to reach** (则厉无从而至矣).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **Seven** (七) is **the beginning of calamity** (祸始),
yet corresponds to the **day** (当昼),
**lying in the realm of the declining family** (在於减家),
hence this **symbol** (故有是象).
The *Yì* (易) says: **Reduce their affliction,
so that they may swiftly have joy** (损其疾，使遄有喜).

**Eighth line (day):** **Flowing waves** (浏涟涟),
**declining at the source of life** (减于生根).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **The decline of flowing waves** (浏涟之减) is **the roots being destroyed** (生根毁也).
The **Wáng** (王) text lacks the **下涟** (下涟) character,
now following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Fàn** (宋、陆、范) texts.
浏 is pronounced as **liú** (音留) or **lìjiǔ** (力久切).
涟 is pronounced as **lián** (音连).
**Fàn** (范) states: **Eight** (八) is **wood** (木).
**Wood begins to decline in autumn** (秋木始衰).
**浏** (浏) is **dripping** ().
**涟涟** (涟涟) is **the appearance of dripping** (垂之貌).
**Dripping** () is an ancient form of **流** (流).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **Eight** (八) is **wood** (木),
**the sinking of heaven** (沈天),
**lingering sickness** (疾瘀),
**consumption** (耗),
**and peeling away** (剥落).
**The sinking of heaven** (沈天) refers to **the transition between autumn and winter** (秋冬之交).
**Wood’s vitality** (木之所以生者) depends on **its roots** (根也).
**Its flourishing** (所以荣者) relies on **its nourishing fluids** (滋液也).
Now, **the nourishing fluids drip downward** (今滋液下流),
**yet the roots, the source of life, are declined** (涟涟，然减其资生之根),
**how then can it still flourish?** (则何以复能盛荣乎?)

**Uppermost ninth line (day):** **The culmination of decline** (减终),
**advantageous to ascend the Western Mountain** (利用登于西山),
**and overlook the great river** (临于大川).
The **Diviner** (测) said: **Ascending in the culmination of decline** (减终之登) is **truly achievable** (诚可为也).
**Fàn** (范) states: **Being in the West signifies metal** (在西为金),
hence it is said **Western Mountain** (西山).
**Metal generates water** (金生水),
hence it is said **great river** (大川).
**Guāng** (光) explains: **When things reach their extreme** (物极则反),
**the culmination of decline must increase** (故减终必增).
**Ascending the mountain and overlooking the river** (登山临川) is **to stand high over the low** (以高临下也#7).
**The West** (西) is **the completion of things** (物之成).
**Standing high over the low** (夫登高临下) is **rarely without peril** (鲜有不危),
yet **declining in this position makes it achievable** (以减处之，故可为也).

**Three regions, one state, two families** (三方一州一部二家唫).
**Yin family, fire** (阴家火),
**corresponding to the negative** (准否).」

The **Chen** (陈) pronunciation is **Qín** (钦), also **Qín** (琴), pronounced as *jùjǐn* in both Small Song and Wu dialects. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: "To speak urgently, the same as *jǐn* (噤)." We follow this today.

Lu (陆) says: **"Lì"** (唫) means "closed and sealed." When **Yin** (阴) does not transform, and **Yang** (阳) does not act, all things are sealed.

In general, when **Yang** (阳) applies its essence and **Yin** (阴) shapes its form, all things come to life. But during the **Chùshǔ** (处暑) season, when **Yin** (阴) does not transform and **Yang** (阳) does not act, all things are sealed.

On the first day, **"Lì"** (唫) does not give, and men dwell like women. **Cè** (测) says: **"Lì"** (唫) does not give, which is contrary to human nature. **"Yǔ"** (予) is the same as **"yǔ"** (与). **Wáng** (王) says: **"Lì"** (唫) is to close oneself off and not engage with others, like a man imitating a woman’s seclusion. **Guāng** (光) says: One is the beginning of thought, occurring at night, dwelling in the depths below. The **junzi** (君子) contemplates the **Dao** (道) and seeks to extend it to others, yet now he is sealed and does not engage—like a man dwelling as a woman does.

A solitary person without kin will be shunned by all, hence it is said, "contrary to human nature."

On the second day, **"lì"** (唫) is in the blood, nourishing the **Qián** (乾) bones. **Cè** (测) says: **"Lì"** (唫) in the blood makes one emaciated yet fattened. **Fàn** (范) originally wrote **"zāi"** (臞), pronounced *yūfù*, but all other versions write **"zāi"** (臞), with Small Song pronouncing it *jù* and Wu *qú*; we follow this. **Wáng** (王) says: **"Lì"** (唫) in the blood nourishes the **Qián** (乾) bones, fearing emaciation and seeking to fatten oneself. **Guāng** (光) says: Two is the middle of thought, occurring in the day, able to accumulate **virtue** (德) to beautify the body. The *Dàxué* (大学) says: *"Wealth moistens the house, **virtue** moistens the body."*

On the third day, the face does not engage, the mouth **chā** (唭), and **"lì"** (唫) has no words. **Cè** (测) says: The face does not engage, and human conduct is faint. **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) omit the mouth radical; we follow Small Song, Lu, and the second Song versions. **Chā** (唭) is pronounced *qùlì*, and **"yù"** (唭) is pronounced *yújì*. **Fàn** (范) says: **Chā** (唭) is sound without words. **Wáng** (王) says: Human conduct nearly reaches extinction. **Guāng** (光) says: Three is the end of thought, and also the completion of intention. Once thought is complete, speech and appearance can engage with others. But if the family nature is sealed, even during the day, it remains closed and unengaged—human conduct nearly vanishes. The *Yì* (易) *Jié* (节) hexagram, line two, says: *"Not going out of the gate or courtyard—disaster."*

On the fourth day, **"lì"** (唫) is in the grains, neither thriving nor common, burdening the old and the clan. **Cè** (测) says: **"Lì"** (唫) in the grains means they cannot be shared.

On the fifth day, neither central nor supervising, the stingy decay of rot and worms. **Cè** (测) says: Neither central nor supervising—this **"lì"** (唫) is wrong. Small Song says: *"Salaries await the worthy, yet granaries overflow with rotting grain—still they are stingy with their **lì** (唫)—this is wrong."* **Guāng** (光) says: **"Dū"** (督) is also **"zhōng"** (中). The **junzi** (君子) accumulates and knows how to disperse; if it should be sealed, then seal; if it should be applied, then apply. In the fifth position of abundance, the family nature is sealed, straying from the middle way during the day—thus rotting yet still stingy.

On the sixth day, springs and sources flow abundantly, sealed in hills and gardens. **Cè** (测) says: The sealing of springs and sources is not to be criticized. The second Song, Lu, and **Wáng** (王) versions write **"yì"** (议) instead of **"jī"** (讥); we follow **Fàn** (范). **Fàn** (范) says: Six is water, hence springs and sources. Hills and gardens are used to illustrate elevation. **Guāng** (光) says: Six is the peak of abundance, the utmost. To store water in high places and wait for the time to apply it means its reach is far. Today’s sealing is the means for tomorrow’s blessings—thus it is not to be criticized.

---

The seventh day, stinginess affects the body, and the yellow flesh is ruined.
**Cè** says: Stinginess affecting the body is harm to bone and flesh.
The **Wáng** version renders "yellow flesh" as "yellow bone and flesh," but we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** versions.

Seven represents decay and ruin, and it is also the time of night.
Yellow is the central point.
Bone and flesh reside in the center, hence "yellow flesh."
**Qi** and blood nourish the body; if stinginess does not extend to the four limbs, then bone and flesh are ruined.
Enlightenment and blessings bind kin; if stinginess does not extend to the nine clans, then inner and outer relations are estranged.

The eighth day, stinginess meets misfortune; prayers with an ox resolve it.
**Cè** says: Stinginess encountering misfortune is the proper cost.
**Fàn** says: The ox is a great expense.
**Wáng** says: Though excessive stinginess invites disaster, one can pray with an ox to avert calamity.
**Guāng** says: Eight is the midpoint of misfortune, hence "stinginess meets disaster."
The night’s omen is thus: "Prayers with an ox resolve it."
To not spare expense in resolving disaster is the right way.

The ninth day, stinginess brings no rain; faith lies in dried meat.
**Cè** says: Stinginess without rain—what can be hoped for?
**Fàn** says: Faith is trust.
**Wáng** says: Nine is the extreme of stinginess, yet it is night.
Yin and Yang are both closed, hence no rain.
**Guāng** says: When nourishment is exhausted and no hope remains, it is indeed true that flesh dries into jerky.
This speaks of the ruler’s blessings failing, and the people suffering.

Three regions, one state, and one clan guard together:
The Yang family guards wood—this is also the principle of negation.
The Yin guards the door, the Yang guards the gate; nothing disturbs them.

The first day, closing the doors and windows, guarding what is original.
**Cè** says: Closing the doors and windows is a good way to hold what one has.
The **Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions render "closing the doors and windows" as "closing the bright windows," but we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** versions.
**Fàn** says: Doors and windows are companions and associates.
**Guāng** says: The *Yì* says: "Wandering to and fro, companions follow your thoughts."
When the mind is moved by something, the thing responds in kind.
Windows are for observing the outside.
Original is the beginning.
The *Lèjì* says: "Man is born and remains still, this is Heaven’s nature; moved by things, he acts, this is human nature."
One is the beginning of thought and the time of night; able to close the enticements of external companions and guard the original nature of what one possesses.

The second day, lost in self-guard, not as effective as the first’s holding.
**Cè** says: Lost in self-guard, there is no proper means.
**Sòng** says: *Yì* (以) is *yòng* (use).
Without proper use, self-guard is all there is.
**Wáng** says: The second day guards its confusion, the first guards its way, hence the second is not as effective as the first.
**Guāng** says: Two is the midpoint of thought, yet it is night; enticed by external things, lost in confusion, and failing to guard what it should.
The *Shū* says: "Only the people are born with abundance; because of things, they change."

The third day, neither loss nor gain, coming and going in silence.
**Cè** says: Neither loss nor gain is guarding one’s original state.
Three is the stage of human progress, self-composure, and fulfilled intent—night’s omen.
Virtue is completed within; able to guard without losing it.
The coming and going of external things—what loss or gain do they bring me?
Silent and fulfilled? Trust without words.
The *Yì* says: "Neither loss nor gain, coming and going in harmony."

The fourth day, the **Guān** (艮) symbol guards.
**Cè** says: The **Guān** symbol’s guard is strict and without leniency.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** versions render "the **Guān** symbol guards" as "the **Guān** (贝) symbol guards itself," while the **Xiǎo Sòng** version writes "the **Guān** (貌) symbol guards," but we follow the **Wáng** version.
**Sòng** says: *Guān* (贝) is pronounced *gǒu* (狗).
**Lù** says: *Guān* ( ) is prohibition and restraint.
The **Guān** symbol, like a dog, cannot discern what is proper, only restraining.
**Fàn** says: The **Guān** symbol is likeness, like a straw dog.
**Guāng** says: *Guān* (贝) is pronounced *gǒu* (狗); it should read "the **Guān** (艮) symbol is a mistake for *gǒu* (狗)."
The **Guān** symbol, like a dog, is akin to saying "the **Guān** symbol like a dragon."

The fifth day, guarding the center with harmony, binding the lords with sincerity.
**Cè** says: Guarding the center with harmony is the nature of the lords.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** versions render "binding the lords with sincerity" as "binding the center with one’s sincerity," while the **Wáng** version renders "binding the lords with sincerity" as "binding the lords with their sincerity," but we follow the **Fàn** version.
**Fàn** says: Five is the Son of Heaven; guarding the way of central harmony, the proper sovereign over all lords.
**Guāng** says: Sincerity is alignment.
None excel in central harmony as much as Five.
Guarding the way of central harmony, to bind the lords with sincerity, is the standard by which the lords are called and aligned.

The sixth day, chariot wheels halted, jade and jasper dusted.
**Cè** says: Chariot wheels halted means no contact with neighbors.
The **Wáng** version renders "no contact with neighbors" as "exchange with neighbors," but we follow the other versions.
**Yùn** (轫), pronounced *rěn* (而振).
**Xiǎo Sòng** says: **Yùn** (轫) is the wooden block that hinders chariot wheels.
In rituals for lords, weapons are not used; the lords themselves are the proper tools for order.
Losing sincerity in guarding, no contact with neighboring states, chariot wheels halted and not moving, jade and jasper gathering dust and unused.
**Guāng** says: The family nature is guarding; six exceeds the center and is night—a case of guarding too much.

The seventh day, the many Yang do not guard, the males’ sincerity.
**Cè** says: The many Yang’s guard is guarding sincerity and trust.
The **Wáng** version omits "do not guard," but we follow the other versions.

The eighth day, the mortar lacks its pestle, and its pestle is raised.
Heaven is dark and does not rain, the bright day destroys the heat.
**Cè** says: The mortar lacks its pestle—this is guarding poverty.
**Wáng** says: A mortar without a pestle means guarding without any use.
The pestle is raised and does not descend—guarding without any fulfillment.
**Guāng** says: Its pestle is raised—there is no grain to pound.
Heaven is dark and does not rain; there is no nourishment to hope for.
Eight is the midpoint of misfortune, of depletion, hence this symbol.

The ninth at the top: **With Tu** there is guarding, and he speaks at Lu’s head—no peril.
**Cè** says: With **Tu** there is guarding, hence it is ever renewed.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** versions read *has Tu has guarding*, while **Cè** reads *its Tu its guarding*; we follow the **Fàn**, **Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions.
**Tu**, pronounced *tú*.
**Sòng** says: *Què* means "to surpass."
**Fàn** says: **Tu** is white. **Lú** is black. Nine is the West, hence white.
**Guāng** says: **Tu** is the flourishing of thatch, its color white.
Nine marks the end of calamity and faces the day—one who repents his misfortune.
Thus, he contemplates the old and wise with white hair, guarding his former Dao,
and declines the black-haired, deceitful men of false speech—
so the state does not fall into peril.
The *Qín Shì* says:
*"The brave warriors, their strength exhausted, yet I still have them.
The valiant fighters, their archery and charioteering unerring, yet I do not desire them."*

**Yǐn** family gold, conforming to **Xùn**.
Entering **Xùn**, five degrees, eighteen minutes thirty-four seconds—white dew qi responds.
The day follows the Star of Longevity, the Dipper in the **Yǒu** position, the **Nán Lǚ** pitch.
**Lù** says: **Xùn** is "enter."
**Yù** is also "enter."
**Wáng** says: **Yù** means "to gather."
**Guāng** says: **Xùn** is the rooster, hence the image of many flying crows gathering.

When **Yīn** comes, it acts contrary; when **Yáng** goes, it acts in harmony. Things retreat, descend, and assemble.
The **Sòng**, **Lù**, **Wáng** versions read *"Yáng goes with harmony"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.
**Sòng** says: **Yīn** comes from below, hence it is called "contrary."
**Yáng** goes from above, hence it is called "harmony."
**Guāng** says: When **Yīn** rises, it harms things, hence "contrary."
When **Yáng** descends, it nurtures things, hence "harmony."

The first day: **Raging** surges in darkness, gathering his resolve.
Though he might wish to wander freely, Heaven does not grant it.
**Cè** says: **Raging** surges in darkness—Heaven has not yet favored him.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** versions read *"gathers his resolve"* as *"with gathering resolve"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.
The **Fàn** version reads *"wander freely"* as *"adroitly at ease"*—we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, **Wáng** versions.
**Wáng** says: *Zī* is the ancient form of *zī* (to nourish).
**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, and it faces night.
The petty man harbors evil intent, raging and surging in the murky depths, gathering his resolve inwardly.
Though he might wish to wander freely, Heaven does not nourish it.

The second day: Gathering in darkness, he shoots true.
**Cè** says: Gathering in darkness—this is upright yielding.
The **Wáng** version reads *"upright yielding"* as *"upright bow"*—we follow the other versions.
Yielding is the same as *yǔ* (to give).
Two is the midpoint of thought, facing the day.
The virtuous man has a good heart, also gathering inwardly in the murky depths.
Like shooting—his resolve is upright, and when he releases, it never misses. Hence, *"shoots true."*
Upright yielding means "only the upright is yielding."

The third day: Gathering to eat, **zhuó zhuó**.
**Cè** says: Gathering to eat, **zhuó zhuó**—beneficial as dancing.
**Zhuó**, pronounced *zhǔ*.
**Fàn** says: **Zhuó zhuó** is the appearance of swift eating.
**Wáng** says: **Zhuó zhuó** exhausts the grain—extreme greed.
Desiring swift benefit, like dancing to the rhythm.
**Guāng** says: Three is the completion of intent, facing night, near fortune.
The petty man, seeing fortune, is greedy and strives to seize it, leaving nothing untried.

The fourth day: Gathering his wings, beneficial to act.
**Cè** says: Gathering his wings—friends assist.
Four is lower fortune, also external "other," facing the day’s light.
Like crows gathering their wings, beneficial to act.
The scholar gains friends’ aid, beneficial for advancement.

The fifth day: Gathering his belly, avoiding the grain fields.
**Cè** says: Gathering his belly—this is not how one gains renown.
The **Fàn**, **Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *"avoiding the grain fields"* as *"avoiding the golden grain fields"*—we follow the **Sòng** and **Lù** versions.
The **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *"renown"* as *"advancement"*—we follow the **Lù** and **Wáng** versions.
Five is central fortune, also the belly, facing the night—
he can only gather his blessings for himself.
Thus, *"gathering his belly."*
One who hoards for himself will surely be deprived—
this is the way to avoid fortune, much less fame.

The sixth day: Yellow heart, vast wings—gathering to the heavens.
**Cè** says: Yellow heart, vast wings—beneficial to gain support.
The **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng** versions read *"beneficial"* as *"harmonious"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.
Six is middle-high, hence called yellow.
**Hóng** is the bird that flies highest.
Six is also abundant and flourishing, dwelling in the peak of fortune, facing the day.
The virtuous man takes the Middle Way as his heart, with many supporters.
Like the vast wings of the **Hóng**, his flight knows no bounds.

The seventh day: Gathering the snare, **zhuó zhuó**.
**Cè** says: Gathering the snare, **zhuó zhuó**—suffering separation and harm.
**Zhuó**, pronounced *zhuó*.
**Fàn** says: Seven is the cord, the arrow.
The arrow uses a cord—this is the snare.
**Guāng** says: Seven is the stage of calamity, facing night, hence suffering separation and harm.

The eighth day: Its **fàn**, severing its **jiān**—peril.
**Cè** says: **Fàn**, severing **jiān**—dangerous yet fulfilled.
**Fàn** is the same as *huī* (to swing).
**Jiān**, pronounced *xiàn*.
**Wáng** says: In daylight, one can still be in danger—
though not reaching ultimate calamity, it is extreme peril.
**Xiǎo Sòng** says: **Fàn** is an overturned cart.
**Jiān** is a net.
**Guāng** says: Eight is the midpoint of calamity, facing the day, hence escape is possible.

The ninth at the top: Its horn—maintaining to subdue his kin.
**Cè** says: Its horn—exterminating his kind.

---

**抵**, pronounced *zhǐ* (as in "paper").

**Fàn** says: **抵** is to strike.
**Wáng** says: Its horn#25, used to repel things—
things that share the same hatred.
**Guāng** says: Nine is extermination, ultimate calamity, ferocity, the horn,
and it faces the night.
Though calamity rages unceasing, reaching its utmost extremity,
it still seeks victory through ferocity, hence the destruction of one’s kin.

**Three regions, one state, two departments, two clans gathered**—
**Yáng**-clan’s earth, conforming to **Cùi** (Gathering).
Entering the gathering, the seventh day, discards the horn.
The *Yì* (Book of Changes) says: **Cùi**, the **Wáng** (King) feigns a temple.
Thus, the gathering abounds with spirits and gods.

**Yīn**-**qì** (vital breath) collects and gathers,
**Yáng** (brightness) does not restrain or rule—
things gather and exalt one another.
**Chóng** (exalt), also means to gather.

The first day: Spirits and gods are without form—**líng** (numinous).
**Cè** says: Spirits and gods without **líng** (numinous power), their forms are unseen.
**Xiàn** (seen), pronounced *xiàn* (as in "acclaim").
**Wáng** says: Spirits and gods take formlessness as **líng** (numinous).
**Chén** says: The gathering—**Yīn**-**qì** (vital breath) collects.
All things decay and decline; form returns to formlessness,
things return to their roots.
What is rootless? Is it not **líng** (numinous)?
The **jīng qì** (refined vital breath) becomes things,
wandering spirits as transformations—
when gathered, they become things;
when scattered, they are formless.
Thus, spirits and gods take formlessness as **líng** (numinous).

**Guāng** says: One is the lowest of the low,
also the water—
a symbol of profound darkness.
The second day: **Yàn cùi xī xī** (Gathered like swallows, joyous and merry).
**Cè** says: **Yàn cùi xī xī**, indulging in licentious revelry.
**Fàn**’s original text had *yàn* (transgression), **Xiǎo Sòng** as *yàn* (transgression),
now following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.
Two is the midpoint of thought, the common folk#26;
facing the night.
Gathering in darkness and reveling in excess,
overindulgence leads to transgression.

The third day: **Zōng qí gāo nián** (Revering the high years), the gate of spirits.
**Cè** says: Revering the high years—
spirits await respect.
**Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original texts all read *Zōng qí gāo xīn* (Revering the high virtue),
now following **Fàn**’s original text.
**Fàn** says: Three is the gate.

The fourth day: Dragging a sheep to offer at the **cóng shè** (shrine groves),
holding the **guī** (jewel-axe) to reverence its left thigh—**yě** (wild).
**Cè** says: Dragging a sheep at the grove,
insufficient for honor.
**Fàn**’s original text had *xìn bì qí zuǒ gǔ* (reverence and ward off its left thigh),
**Cè** says: Insufficient for labor,
now following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.
**Xìn** (reverence), same as *shēn* (to extend).
The sheep is the **zhōng shèng** (central sacrificial victim).
Shrines follow groves and forests—
the lesser spirits.
Holding the **guī** (jewel-axe), a solemn rite.
The reverence should extend the right thigh.
Four is the night of the day,
though there be blessings and riches,
they cannot be utilized—
like dragging a sheep to merely display at the shrine groves,
insufficient for honor.
Holding the **guī** (jewel-axe) and bowing,
it extends the left thigh,
thus failing to escape vulgarity.

The fifth day: **Dǐng xuè zhī yòu** (The tainted blood of the cauldron),
**jiǔ zōng zhī hào** (the delight of nine clans),
thus the later has trust.
**Cè** says: The tainted blood of the cauldron,
trusting the **Wáng**’s (King’s) command.
**Wáng** says: **Yòu**, same as *yòu* (to blaze),
meaning the sacrificial firewood.

**wáng** (perishing).
**Cè** says: The madness of fearing spirits,
exceeding the proper measure.
**Fàn**’s original text had *mèi* (to obscure);
now following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.

The **King** says: *Mí* (眯) means the eyes see nothing#28.
Madness and blindness while seeking licentious rites—then it is in darkness.

The seventh: **Sǒng cuì at the mound and tomb.**
**Cè** says: **Sǒng cuì** at mound and tomb—rites are not abandoned.
The **King** says: **Sǒng** means reverence.
**Guāng** says: Seven is high, is rites, and marks the beginning of calamity, yet it is daytime.
With reverence gathered at mound and tomb, it is the symbol of burial rites.

The eighth: **The screech-owl in the forest, trampling the many birds.**
**Cè** says: The screech-owl in the forest—what all gather upon.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** texts read *guā* (呱), the **Wáng** text reads *fèi* (吠); now following the **Fàn**, **Xiǎo Sòng** texts.
*Guā*, pronounced *jiāo* (交切), with multiple tones.
The **King** says: The screech-owl—evil bird.
Gathered in the forest—surely it will be hissed by the many birds.
**Guāng** says: Eight is the midpoint of calamity, yet it is night.
The petty man’s evil reputation has already taken root, like the screech-owl in the forest, where the many birds must gather and hiss at it.

The ninth: **Drooping tears, dripping from the nose, gathering the family’s assembly.**
**Cè** says: Drooping tears dripping from the nose—time’s command is severed.
**Xiǎo Sòng** says: *Huì* (汇) means kindred.
**Guāng** says: Nine is the extreme of calamity, is extermination.
Like the noble man who, though born with virtuous power, dies in sorrow.
When **Zhào Wénzǐ** completed his hall, he said: *"Sing here, weep here, gather the clans here"*—this is what is meant.

Three regions, one state, two departments, three families, and the accumulation#29 of **Yīn** family water—like **Dà Chù** (Great Accumulation).
**Yīn** is about to close in greatness, while **Yáng** remains slightly open.
Mountains, rivers, marshes, and swamps—all things return here.
The **King** says: Mountains and marshes are where all things are stored and hidden.
**Guāng** says: When **Yīn** is strong and **Yáng** is weak, all things reach the end of **Yáng** and return to be hidden in mountains, rivers, marshes, and swamps, piled within them.

The first: **Dark accumulation of *pǐ* (否), forming the foundation of light.**
**Cè** says: Dark accumulation of *pǐ*—beginning in evil.
The **Sòng** and **Lù** texts read *"beginning in evil"* as *"already in evil"*, the **Fàn** text lacks *"already"*, and the **Xiǎo Sòng** text lacks *"already"*—now following the **Wáng** text.
The **Wáng** text reads *zī* (资) for *jī* (基); now following the other texts.
*Pǐ* is pronounced *bǐ* (鄙).
**Fàn** says: *Pǐ* means not good.
**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, yet it is night.
The petty man accumulates evil in darkness and invites punishment in light, so the hidden evil becomes the foundation for clear retribution.

The second: **Accumulation unused until it reaches great use—then the noble man steadies his heart.**
**Cè** says: Accumulation unused—it cannot be measured.
*Dù* (度) is pronounced *dài* (待洛切)#30.
**Fàn** says: *Jiè* (介) means great.
**Sòng** says: Accumulation long unused—virtuous power deeply hidden—when the time comes, it reaches great use.
**Guāng** says: Two is the midpoint of thought, yet it is daytime.
The noble man accumulates virtue within, constrained in low station, unused by the times.
Yet if the accumulation does not cease, its use must be great.
The noble man merely broadens his virtuous heart—he does not eagerly seek use.

The third: **Accumulating stones that do not eat—wasting labor and effort.**
**Cè** says: Accumulating stones that do not eat—nothing can be gained.
Three is the upper thought, yet it is night.
Wasting the heart on uselessness, laboring in vain—like accumulating stones that cannot be eaten, toiling without gain.

The fourth: **The noble man accumulates virtue until it reaches the carriage-ears.**
**Cè** says: The noble man accumulates virtue until it flourishes.
The **Xiǎo Sòng** text reads *"until it flourishes"* as *"until great flourishing"*—now following the other texts.
The **King** says: *Fán* (蕃) means progeny, pronounced *fú* (附袁切).
**Xiǎo Sòng** says: *Fán* means carriage-ears, pronounced *fú* (敷袁切).
**Guāng** says: Carriage-ears are the two crossbars.
To reach the carriage-ears—speaking of its full accumulation being visible.

The fifth: **The hidden does not fill, the thief does not profit.**
**Cè** says: The hidden fills, the thief profits—it only harms itself.
The **Wáng** text reads *jiǎn* (减) for *cáng* (藏); now following the other texts.
*Cáng* is pronounced *cú* (徂浪切).
Five occupies an exalted position, receiving great fortune, yet does not practice virtue and charity, but accumulates without end—just enough to profit the thief.
The **Qín** accumulated the **Ào Cāng** for the resources of **Chǔ-Hàn**; the **Sūi** accumulated at **Luòkǒu** for **Lǐ Mì’s** use—all are of this kind.

The sixth: **Great fullness and generous bestowal—obtaining people without arrogance.**
**Cè** says: Great fullness and generous bestowal—people come to it.
The **Wáng** text reads *fāng* (方) for *kàng* (亢); now following the other texts.
*Shī* (施) is pronounced *shì* (式豉切).
The **King** says: Six occupies a position of prosperity, obtaining the time of day.
The accumulation is greatly full, yet able to bestow greatly, aiding all things.
Thus, people all turn to it—its way is boundless.
**Guāng** says: Wealth dispersed gathers people—thus it obtains them.
*Kàng* means rival.
The *Shī* says: *"None rival, only the people."* Thus, it is without rival in the world.

The seventh: **Protruding and prominent, jade and silk arrayed—deciding to invite bandits.**
**Cè** says: Protruding and prominent—this is the thief’s invitation.
The **Fàn** text reads *shōu* (收) for *zhāo* (招); the **Wáng** text reads *kuài* (快) for *jué* (决)—now following the **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng** texts.
*Kuī* (魁) means the head emerges.
*Yán* (颜) means it is conspicuous.
*Bān* (班) means to array.
Seven marks the beginning of calamity, yet it is night.

**Cè** says: Accumulating virtue invites calamity—it is not one’s own fault.
The **Xiǎo Sòng** text reads *zhǎn* (展) for *chén* (辰); now following the other texts.
*Chén* means time.
A family that accumulates evil must have lingering retribution.
Eight is the midpoint of calamity, yet it is night.
Though the body accumulates virtue and suffers the calamity of the times, it is the guilt of their ancestors.

The ninth: **The petty man accumulates wrong until it reaches his descendants.**

「The eighth: **Accumulating virtue invites calamity—it is the fault of one’s forebears.**
**Cè** says: Accumulating virtue invites calamity—it is not one’s own guilt.

The ninth: **The petty man accumulates wrong until it extends to his descendants.**
**Cè** says: The petty man accumulates wrong, and calamity is thereby deferred. The *Wáng* text renders *miáo* (苗) as *wáng* (亡), while the *Xiǎo Sòng* text renders it as *dí* (笛), pronounced like *dí* (迪). Now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* texts.
*Miáo* (苗), anciently written as *wěi* (委), signifies deferred consequences.

Fàn says: In cases where evil is great, calamity will extend even to the descendants.
Guāng says: When wrong is accumulated to its extreme, calamity reaches its full measure—deferred and deferred, it thus drags on to affect the descendants. #31

**Three regions, one state; three departments, one family adorned.**
The *Yáng* family’s fire—corresponding to *Bēn* (贲).
Upon entering adornment, the eighth hexagram, **thirty-six degrees with fifteen seconds**, the *Qiūfèn* (秋分) *qi* aligns, hence it also corresponds to *Duì* (兑).
*Duì* signifies speech and tongue, thus adornment displays the symbols of excessive words.

The *Yáng* (阳) adorned in white, the *Yīn* (阴) in black—each fulfills its role, and adornment marks their entering and exiting.
The *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* texts render *jué* (厥) as *qí* (其). Now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* texts.
*Sòng* says: When *Yīn* *qi* emerges, it governs above, hence white is used for adornment.
When *Yáng* *qi* enters, it governs below, hence black is used for adornment.
*Lù* says: *Yīn* governs the west, hence white; *Yáng* retreats to the north, hence black.
*Wáng* says: White signifies manifestation, black signifies concealment.
White and black divide in form—their adornment is thus revealed.

The first: **Speech without words—words without speech.**
**Cè** says: Speech without words—silent yet trustworthy.
The *Wáng* text omits *zàncí* (赞辞) and reads only *yán bù yǐ yán* (言不以言). Now following the other texts.
One signifies the beginning of thought, and it is daytime.
The virtuous man inwardly upholds his utmost sincerity, submerged in profound silence, regarding speechlessness as true speech.
This is so because silent trustworthiness is the essence of speech.
Confucius said: What does Heaven speak?
The four seasons proceed in their course, and all things are born.

The second: **Adornment without substance—first the fine words, then the loss of proper conduct.**
**Cè** says: Adornment without substance, first the fine words—this is the loss of sincerity.
The *Wáng* text renders *zhēn* (贞) as *zhēn* (真). Now following the other texts.
*Wáng* says: Without its foundation, seeking adornment, though it may begin with elegant words, it will ultimately lose its proper conduct.
Guāng says: Two signifies the midpoint of thought, yet it is night.
The petty man lacks inner sincerity, merely indulging in outward adornment.
At first, his words and appearance may seem trustworthy and beautiful, but in the end, he loses his true conduct.
Conduct refers to the manifestation of virtue in outward form.

The third: **He spits forth a yellow tongue, grasps a yellow brush—advantageous to see the wise.**
**Cè** says: The advantage of a sharp tongue and brush—this is the advantage of discerning people.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *tǔ huáng shé* (吐黄舌) as *tǔ huáng qiú shé* (吐黄酋舌), and the *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* texts render *qián* (钳) as *gān* (柑). Now following the *Wáng* text.
*Qián* (钳) is pronounced *jūlián* (渠廉).
*Zhī* (知) is used interchangeably with *zhì* (智).
*Qián* (钳) means to hold.
*Yù* (聿) means brush.
The virtuous man speaks and writes, never straying from the central path—only the wise can understand this, while the foolish are unworthy of discussion.
*The Fǎyán* (法言) says: Speech is the voice of the heart.
Writing is the drawing of the heart.
Voice and drawing reveal form—the virtuous and the petty are thus distinguished.

The fourth: **A sharp tongue, blustering and clamorous—this is the proper conduct of the merchant.**
**Cè** says: The proper conduct of blustering and clamorous speech—this is advantageous to the merchant.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *lì shé wāwā* (利舌哇哇) as *shé wāwā* (舌哇哇), while the *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* texts render it as *lì kǒu wāwā* (利口哇哇). Now following the *Wáng* text.
*Wā* (哇) is pronounced *wūjiā* (乌佳).
*Wáng* says: Merely adorning words with empty rhetoric to dazzle and sell—this is the proper conduct of the merchant, not the virtuous man’s true path.

---

**The Fifth:** Speech humbles like water, yet its essence is the **Heavenly Vagina** (天牝).
**Cè** says: Humble speech like water—it can wash away impurities.
Now following the **Wáng** text, where *tàn* (牝) is rendered as *bǐ* (比).
The *Xiǎo Sòng* text states: Though firm in principle, one can empty the heart to receive sound counsel, heeding advice like flowing water—what would not be embraced?
**Guāng** says: *Tàn* (牝) means "valley." The **Heavenly Vagina** refers to the **sea**.
Five holds the exalted position yet aligns with daytime, humbling itself to accept others' words.
Thus, people vie to tell it of the **Dao** (善道), like water flowing into the sea.
The sea, though low, receives all streams, and so achieves its vastness;
The **virtuous ruler** (君), though humble, gathers all goodness, and so achieves his **sainthood** (圣).

**The Sixth:** Speech has no retraction—it soars like the wind, the **Great Person** (大人) a thunderous gust.
**Cè** says: Speech that cannot be retracted—this is also to exalt it.
The **Great Person** refers to one in a noble position.
Six passes the midpoint yet aligns with night, marking one who errs in speech.
A single misspoken word cannot be undone by four horses’ tongues—hence, "speech has no retraction."
Though one cleanses it, the more foul it becomes—this is the **mouth** (口) #32.
Even if one tries to suppress it, it has already soared—hence, "it soars like the wind."
Moreover, power and blessings lie within oneself—when words issue forth, swift as wind and thunder, they bring life or ruin to all things.
How can one not be cautious?

**The Seventh:** When the time for speech is not ripe, words are faint, and the **superior** (上) grows suspicious.
**Cè** says: If the time for speech is not ripe, how can it be clear?
The *Xiǎo Sòng* text omits the *bù* (不) character; now following the other families.
*Jiàn* (见) is pronounced *xián biàn* (贤遍).
**Fàn** says: *Dīng* (丁) means "proper" or "due."
A faint wind is all that can be done—it cannot be clear and evident.
**Guāng** says: Seven marks the beginning of calamity, yet aligns with daytime.
The **virtuous man** (君子) serving under a **tyrannical ruler** (暴君) cannot speak directly, so he uses faint words, a gentle wind.
If he speaks clearly, the ruler will surely doubt him.
Confucius said: The **virtuous man** (君子) must first be trusted before offering counsel.
If he is not trusted, his words will be taken as slander against himself.

**The Eighth:** Murmuring like cicadas, ceaselessly, blood flows from the mouth.
**Cè** says: Murmuring like cicadas—this is self-inflicted harm.
*Chuì* (蛁) is the same as *tiáo* (蜩).
*Yōng* (喁) is pronounced *yǒng* (颙).
**Wáng** says: *Tiáo* (蜩) is the insect that chirps incessantly.
**Guāng** says: *Yōng yōng* (喁喁) is like *zhūn zhūn* (谆谆).
Eight marks the midpoint of calamity, yet aligns with night.
When the ruler does not accept counsel, the minister forcefully presses his words, risking either humiliation or punishment.
Like the cicada’s ceaseless chirping, though blood flows from the mouth, who would listen?
It only harms oneself.

**The Ninth (Upper):** A **white tongue** (白舌) speaks *yú yú* (于于), bent at its root, the **virtuous man** (君子) loses faith.
**Cè** says: A **white tongue** speaking *yú yú*—this is truly a lasting way.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render **Cè**’s words as: "A **white tongue** (信舌不白)."
**Wáng** renders *yú yú* (于于) as *gān gān* (干干), and **Cè** says: "This marks speech that is not trusted."
The *Xiǎo Sòng* text reads: "A **white tongue** (白舌不白), bent at its root."
Now following the **Fàn** text.
*Fǒu* (否) means "contradict," pronounced *fāng jiǔ* (方九).
*Yú yú* (于于) describes a **bent** or **submissive** posture.
Nine marks the extreme of calamity, yet aligns with daytime.
The **virtuous man** (君子) in an age of **non-Dao** (无道), when his words are not believed, should only bend his tongue and keep silent.
This is truly a lasting way.
The *Yì* (易) says: "If words are not trusted, even the mouth will be exhausted."
Three families, one state, three departments, and two households have doubts.
Wood and **accommodation** (贲) are also aligned.
This doubt is like the **wind** (巽) or **thunder** (震)—the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** texts all take it as the **wind** (巽), while **Fàn** takes it as **thunder** (震).
Both are incorrect.
When **yin** and **yang** clash, all things are injured and scattered—this is doubt.
*Dǐng* (硙) is pronounced *wǔ duì* (午对).
**Sòng** says: When things clash and are scattered, it is called *dǐng*.
At this time, **yin** and **yang** clash, their proportions balanced, and day and night equal.
**Lù** says: *Diāo* (雕) means "injured," and *lí* (离) means "scattered."
When **yin** is low yet dominant, and **yang** is exalted yet neglected, this is doubt—this is injury and scattering.

**The First:** Doubt is restless—**virtue/power** (德) and **truth** (贞) are lost.
**Cè** says: Doubt that is not upright—how can it be settled?
The *Xiǎo Sòng* text renders *huí* (徊) and *chuàng* (恛) as *jǔ* (呬), with the pronunciation *xū lì* (虚利).
*Jǔ jǔ* (呬呬) means "laugh."
Now following the other families.
**Fàn** renders *bù zhèng zhī yí* (不正之疑) as *yí kǎi* (疑怬失贞).
Now following the other families.
*Chuàng* (恛) is pronounced *huí* (回).
**Fàn** says: *Shǐ* (矢) means "straight."
**Wáng** says: *Chuàng chuàng* (恛恛) describes a **confused** and **chaotic** state.
**Guāng** says: One marks the beginning of thought, yet aligns with night.
The **petty man** (小人) has no upright heart, filled with doubt yet hesitant to decide, ultimately settling on nothing.

**The Second:** Doubt turns inward—**trust** (孚) is near.
**Cè** says: Doubt turns inward—this is turning from **clarity and tranquility** (清静).
Two marks the midpoint of thought, a **repetition** (反复), yet aligns with daytime.
The **virtuous man** (君子) with doubt should screen out desires and interests, balance away love and hatred, quiet his heart, and reflect upon himself.
If it is **righteousness** (义), he will act; if not, he will abandon it.
With this to resolve doubt, how far can it be?

**The Third:** Doubt is forcefully illuminated—**receptive compassion** (慈闵) is met, yet it troubles the heart’s root.
**Cè** says: Doubt is forcefully illuminated—this is **darkness** (冥) within the heart.
**Fàn** renders *qiáng* (强) as *qiǎng* (强), now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** texts.
*Qiáng* (强) is pronounced *qí liǎng* (其两).
**Wáng** says: Though in doubt, one forcefully illuminates—this is **darkness** (暗) yet **forceful clarity** (强明).
It is fitting that such **receptive compassion** (慈闵) troubles the heart’s **root** (祖).
**Guāng** says: Three marks the completion of thought, yet aligns with night, hence this symbol.
Confucius said: "To know is to know; to not know is to not know—this is wisdom."
The *Qǔ Lǐ* (曲礼) says: "In doubtful matters, do not **question** (质)."
**Cè** says: Doubt is considered—this is **consulting the past** (旧) first.

---

**Wáng** says: When the heart holds doubts, yet examines and verifies the ancient texts to clarify them, then doubts will surely be resolved.

**Guāng** says: Four is the **"external"** (外它), the **"clear and flowing"** (条畅), yet aligns with day, hence this symbol.

Ancient texts and old persons alike may be consulted.
When one consults and encounters true sincerity and trustworthiness, then it is fitting to follow them.

Confucius said: **"Doubt, ponder, and inquire."**

Next, **Five**: **Hūn** (赨) and **Huáng** (黄), doubting the **center of *Jīn*** (金中).
**Cè** says: *Hūn* (赨) and *Huáng* (黄) in doubt—this is **perversion seizing the upright** (邪夺正).

The *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *hūn* (赨) as *xià* (吓), which does not appear in the character dictionaries;
**Fàn** renders it as *fáng* (妨); now following the **Wáng** and **Chén** texts.
*Hūn*, pronounced *tú dōng* (徒冬).

**Fàn** says: *Hūn* is the **crimson** (赤).
**Wáng** says: *Hūn* is the **vermilion** (彤), same as *tóng* (彤).

Though in a position of prestige, yet dwelling in darkness and aligning with night,
one cannot discern and resolve the doubts.
The vermilion and yellow hues, yet doubting them for *Jīn* (金).
The *Xiǎo Sòng* (小宋) says: *Hūn* (赨), pronounced *xióng* (雄), is the **雄黄** (*xiónghuáng*, orpiment).
The *hūn* (赨) and *huáng* (黄) hues are radiant and resplendent—
one doubts there might be traces of *Jīn* (金) within them.

**Guāng** says: Five occupies the **honored position** (尊位), yet aligns with night.
In doubt yet unable to clarify, the **greatly deceptive** (大佞) resembles loyalty—
thus perversion can seize the upright.

Next, **Six**: **Oaths of sincerity** (誓贞) may be heeded, yet doubts may still hold **truth** (诚).
**Cè** says: *Oaths of sincerity* (誓贞) may be heeded—this clarifies the **Sovereign’s command** (王命).

**Wáng** says: Six attains its position and aligns with day,
able to resolve all doubts.
With **proclamations and oaths** (诰誓) to set things right,
all may heed and discern what confounds them.
Even if doubts persist and understanding has not yet dawned,
there is the **Way of sincere clarity** (诚明之道) to penetrate them—
then all **foolishness and confusion** (愚迷) will be dispelled.
This is the **reiteration of the Sovereign’s command** (申明王命)
to **cut through the masses’ doubts** (断众疑).

**Guāng** says: All things bear **doubts** (疑),
hence one must **swear oaths** (誓) to them.
When oaths are **upright** (正), then all may heed them.
Yet if people still **doubt** (疑) the oaths,
then one must **reiterate them with utmost sincerity** (申之以至诚).
**Sincerity** (诚) makes them follow;
**lack of sincerity** (不诚) makes them not follow.

「Six is the uppermost fortune (上禄), hence it is called **Sovereign’s Command** (王命).

Next, **Seven**: Ghostly apparitions (鬼魂) harbor doubts (疑), sighing and wailing (嚘鸣).
Catching birds of the **proclaimed wood** (弋木之鸟) or foxes from the **marked holes** (射穴之狐),
inverts the senses—**eyes see as ears** (反目耳), and **ears hear as eyes** (厉).
**Guāng** says: Ghostly apparitions (鬼魂) are vague (恍惚), flickering between presence and absence (若有若无), truly deserving of doubt (疑).
**Black not as crow** (莫黑匪乌), **red not as fox** (莫赤匪狐)—these are distinctions easily made.
**Eyes see, ears hear** (目视耳听) is the natural order of things.
Seven signifies **losing one’s resolve** (失志), **decay** (消), **ruin and harm** (败损), and occurs at night.
Since one’s own **illumination is obscured** (己既不明), many are **bewildered** (惑).
Whether they be **ghosts or spirits** (若鬼若魂), unable to discern, one can only sigh in lament (叹嗟而已).
Though crows and foxes are easily distinguished, still there may be **mistakes or omissions** (或得失), leaving doubt unresolved.
If one’s own **ears and eyes** (己之耳目) are not even trusted,
then to **see with ears and hear with eyes** (反以耳视而目听) is truly perilous (宜其危矣).

Next, **Eight**: **Inverted doubts** (颠疑) meet with **obstructive guests** (遇干客), three years without hunting.
**Guāng** says: When **inverted doubts** (颠疑) encounter guests (客), it is an occasion of utmost reverence (甚足敬也).
**Hunting** (射) is pronounced *yì*.
**Fàn** says: **Hunting** (射) here means **satiation** (厌).

At the **uppermost Nine**, **doubt without trust** (疑无信) leads to **drawing the bow like a deer** (控弧拟麋), resulting in **nothingness** (无).
**Guāng** says: **Doubt without trust** (疑无信), when carried to its extreme (终), yields no **fate or name** (所名).
The **Sòng, Lǔ, Fàn, Wáng** commentaries all originally read *九疑无信*, now following the **Wáng and small Sòng** versions.
**Fàn** says: **Without trust** (无信) means **nothing worthy of trust** (无所信).
**Drawing the bow like a deer** (控弧拟麋) and **nothingness** (无) further emphasize the **depth of doubt** (疑之甚).

**Guāng** says: Nine represents **doubt at its peak** (疑极), hence this **symbol** (象).
If doubt persists without resolution (终疑不决), then **no fate or name** (成名) will be attained.

**Three directions, one state, three departments, three families observe** (三方一州三部三家视):
The **Yáng family** (阳家) sees **gold** (金), following the **observations of the *Zhuan* texts** (准观).
The **Yīn family** (阴成) sees **the forming of vital essence** (魄), the **Yáng family** (阳成) sees **the forming of ancestral spirits** (妣),
and all **manifestations of things** (物之形貌) are visible.

**Wáng** says: At this time, the **forms of all things are fully manifest** (万物形貌已成), all visible.
**Guāng** says: The **Yīn of autumn equinox** (秋分之阴) is like the **moon taking shape** (月成魄).
**Mǐ** (妣) should be read as **配** (match), with the pronunciation *pǐ-jì* (匹计切).
At the **midpoint of Yīn and Yáng** (阴阳中分), **pairing is complete** (成配偶).

**First day (初一)**, **concealing one’s illumination** (内其明), not using its **radiance** (光).
**Guāng** says: **Concealing one’s illumination** (内其明) means **self-examination in darkness** (自窥深).
**Fàn** says: **Inner reflection without remorse** (内省不疚), then what **worries or fears** (忧惧) can there be?

**Guāng** says: One (一) marks the **beginning of contemplation** (思始), occurring at **day’s dawn** (当昼).
**Retreating vision inward** (收视内明), not relying on **external radiance** (外光).

Next, **Second day (次二)**, **the noble sees within** (君子视内), **the petty sees without** (小人视外).
**Guāng** says: The petty **seeing outward** (视外) cannot **perceive the heart** (见心).
**Body’s flourishing or decline** (身之荣悴), **people’s virtue or lack thereof** (人之贤不肖)—none escape this truth.

Next, **Third day (次三)**, **observing virtue** (视其德) can **support the Sovereign’s realm** (可以干王之国).
**Guāng** says: **Observing virtue** (视德) to **uphold the state** (干), ensures **completeness and integrity** (乃能有全).
Three (三) signifies **intent fully formed** (成意), and also **advancing others** (进人), occurring at **midday** (当日之昼),
when **virtue is manifest and externalized** (德成而外形).
Hence, the **Sovereign observes virtue’s scale** (王者视德之大小),
assigning **rank and position** (任以爵位) to serve as **the pillars of the state** (为国家之桢干).

Next, **Fourth day (次四)**, **powdering the forehead** (粉其题), **moistening the mustache** (雨其渥须),
**the vision is without charm** (视无姝).
**Guāng** says: **Powdering the forehead and moistening the mustache** (粉题雨须) is **unbearable to behold** (不可忍瞻).
The **Sòng and Lǔ** versions lack the word *忍*, the **small Sòng** version lacks *可*,
now following the **Fàn and Wáng** versions.

**Wáng**’s version reads *顺* (顺), meaning **facial expression altered** (面权).
The **small Sòng** version reads *面无色* (面无色), pronounced *mì-jué* (匹迥切), meaning **face without hue** (面无色).
Now following **Fàn**’s version.
**题** (题), pronounced *fěn-biàn* (粉变切), means **forehead** (额).
**面** (面), pronounced *mì* (匹), means **face** (面).
**姝** (姝), pronounced *chūn-jū* (春朱切), means **beautiful** (好).
**Fàn** says: **题** (题) is the **forehead** (额).
**面** (面) is the **face** (面).
**姝** (姝) means **beauty or grace** (好).

「Guāng says: The fourth **color (sè)** is **white (bái)**, which signifies **low rank and fortune (xià lù)**, **external but not intrinsic (wài tāi)**, and is the adornment of **petty people (xiǎo rén)** who embellish their outward appearance to gain fortune. **Prolonged pretense must fail (wěi jiǔ bì bài)**, just as **powdering the forehead (fěn tí)** and encountering rain causes the **mustache to cling with dampness (wū xū)**,—how could others find it pleasing (hǎo) when they see it?

The fifth **color (sè)** is **luan-fèng (鸾凤) in riotous display (fēn rú)**, and its **virtue/power (dé)** shines **brilliantly (huī rú)**. **Guāng says:** *Luan-fèng in riotous display (鸾凤纷如)* means **virtue/power radiant and pure (dé guāng hào)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *huī (晖)* as *shí (时)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**.

The fifth **color (sè)** occupies the **highest rank (zūn wèi)**, receives **great blessings (shèng fú)**, yet is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)**. When the **Sovereign’s virtue/power shines (zhōng dé huī rú)** and **auspicious omens (jiā ruì)** gather, then the *luan-fèng* appear in abundance. **Jiā Yì (贾谊)** says: *The phoenix soars at a thousand rèn (仞), gazing upon the radiant virtue/power and descending (览德晖而下之).*

The sixth **color (sè)** is **white chariot with emerald canopy (sù chē cuì gài)**, which is **harmful to vision (wéi shì zhī hài)**, yet **pure (zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *White chariot with emerald canopy (素车翠盖)* is merely **loveliness of outward appearance (tú hǎo wài)**. The sixth **color (sè)** signifies **high fortune (shàng lù)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** without virtue/power (dé) yet holding fortune (lù) are **lovely without but ugly within (wài hǎo nèi chǒu)**, like riding a **white chariot (sù chē)** while displaying an **emerald canopy (cuì gài)**—their outward appearance seems splendid, but inwardly they lack refinement. **The pure (zhēn)** must be **judged with upright vision (dāng yǐ zhèng shì)**, then their **beauty and ugliness will be self-evident (zhī hǎo chǒu fēn fēn)**.

The seventh **color (sè)** is **to observe its flaws (shì qí xiá)**, yet **without impurity (wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *To observe its flaws (视其瑕)* means **one can correct oneself (néng zì jiāo)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *wú (无)* as *wǎng (罔)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: The seventh **color (sè)** occupies a **position of excess (guò mǎn zhī dì)**, yet one still holds rank at **day (dāng zhòu)**—this is the ability to **examine one’s flaws in accordance with the times (yīn shí ér zì shì qí xiá)**, to **guard against faults before they arise (jiè yú wèi méng)**, so that **blame and regret do not take root (guā zǔi bù shēng)**, and thus **impurity never appears (gù wéi wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *This is why the seventh **color (sè)** is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)***—it marks the **beginning of calamity (huò shǐ)**.

The eighth **color (sè)** is **feicui (翡翠) in flight (yú fēi)**, **detaching its wings (lí qí yì)**; the **fur of the fox (hú máo)** becomes **one’s own undoing (gōng qí zéi)**. **Guāng says:** *Feicui and fox fur (翡翠狐鼠)* are **loveliness in form (hǎo zuò)**, yet **a cause for blame (jiù)**. **Má (鼦)**, pronounced *dū liáo (都聊)切*, is the same as *diāo (貂)*. **Fàn (范)** says: **Each uses its patterned fur (wén máo)**, yet **both bring about disaster (shì shēn zhī huò)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Wǎng (罔) detaches its wings (lí qí yì)*. **Guāng says:** *The eighth **color (sè)** is the **midpoint of calamity (huò zhōng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **External beauty (wài guān zhī měi)** becomes **a personal misfortune (shì shēn zhī zāi)**. **Mèngzǐ (孟子)** says: *A man like Běnchéng (盆成) may have some talent (xiǎo yǒu cái)*, yet **if he has not heard the Great Dao/Way of the Noble (dà dào)**, then **it is enough to ruin his life (bì zhì shēn ér wéi yǐ)**.

The ninth **color (sè)** is **the sun setting its light (rì méi qí guāng)**, **glowing in the east (bīn yú dōng fāng)**, **observing its origins (yòng shì qí shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *The sun setting and glowing in the east (rì yù bīn dōng)*, **finally turning back to its beginning (zhōng gù shǐ)**#38. **Fàn (范)** says: *Bīn (贲)* means **yellow-white hue (huáng-bái sè)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *The sun as it sets glows in the east (rì zhī jiāng méi bīn dōng fāng)*. **Guāng says:** *The ninth **color (sè)** is the **end of vision (shì zhī zhōng)**, yet it appears at **day (dāng zhòu)**. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** cultivates **virtue/power (dé)** and establishes **achievements (lèng gōng)**, **treating the end as the beginning (shèn zhōng rú shǐ)**. As the sun sets, it **reflects back upon the east (fǎn zhào dōng fāng)**. **The *Yì* (易) says:** *To observe one’s steps (shì lǚ)*, **to examine omens (kǎo xiáng)**, **and to return to their roots (qí xuán yuán jí)** is **ultimately auspicious (shǐ zhuān yuán jí)**. **The three regions, two states, one department, and one family (sān fāng èr zhōu yī bù yī jiā)** are submerged in **yin (yīn)**, **water (shuǐ)**, and **observation (guān)** is also appropriate here.

The fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the sun abandoning its family (rì shě shì)**. **Yīn (沈)** means **to descend or sink (xià shì)**. The **other versions (jū jiā)** assume this to be **yīn duì (沈兑)**, but this is incorrect. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** proceed separately, yet **both yearn for the other (xiāng sī)**. Their **intentions lie in the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**. **Sòng (宋)** says: *Xiāng (怀)* means **to ponder (sī)**. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** have long been distinct, yet **they both converge in autumn (qiū zhōng)**, **mutually yearning (xiāng sī)**, so their **intentions are both fixed upon the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**.

The first **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **not hearing the pure (bù wén zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (沈耳于闺)* means **losing the essence of virtue/power (shī dé tǐ)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The first **color (sè)** is the **ear (ěr)**, **which is submerged in water (shuǐ zhōng)**, hence **sinking (yīn)***. **Guāng says:** *The first **color (sè)** is the **lowest of low (xià xià)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** delight in **sinking their ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **listening secretly (qián tīng)**, **to uncover others’ hidden affairs (yǐ xià rén zhī yǐn sī)**, yet **they do not hear the Noble’s upright Dao/Way (zhēn dào)**. **Even if they fill their ears with tassels (chuí liáng chōng ěr)**, **they still cannot perceive hidden truths (wù wú yǐn qíng)**.

The second **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **sinking vision to self-perception (yīn shì zì jiàn)**, **superior to the one-eyed’s glance (xiàn yú miǎo zhī miǎn)**. **Guāng says:** *Sinking vision’s perception (沈视之见)* attains **true beauty (dé zhèng měi)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The second **color (sè)** is the **eye (mù)**, yet **it belongs to the sinking family (yīn jiā)**, hence **sinking vision (yīn shì)***. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Miǎo (眇)*; **one-eyed and blind (yī mù máng)**. **Miǎn (眄)** is **oblique vision (yé shì)**. **Guāng says:** *The second **color (sè)** is **mid-thought (sī zhōng)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **Sinking vision (yīn shì)** within oneself **perceives both good and evil (zì jiàn shàn è)**, **attaining its true beauty (dé qí zhèng měi)**. It is **superior to petty people (xiàn yú xiǎo rén)**, who **cannot inwardly reflect (bù néng nèi xǐng)** yet **spy on others’ right and wrong (páng kuī tā rén zhī shì fēi)**. Like **the one-eyed (miǎo mù)**, **they themselves are unclear (jǐ zé bù míng)**, yet **they delight in oblique vision (hǎo yé shì)**.

The third **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink in beauty (yīn yú měi)**, **losing the true arrow (shī zhēn shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink in beauty (沈于美)* means **acting like the deaf and blind (zuò lóng máng)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *Shǐ (矢)* means **straightforwardness (zhí)**. **Guāng says:** *The third **color (sè)** is **upper thought (sī shàng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** **are drowned in the beauty of sounds and colors (yīn yì shēng sè zhī měi)**, **losing their upright nature (shī qí zhèng zhí zhī xìng)**. **Lǎozǐ (老子)** says: *The five tones (yīn) make one’s ears deaf (ér lóng), the five colors (sè) make one’s eyes blind (mù máng)*. This means **what one hears and sees is not truly perceived (suǒ wén jiàn jiē bù dé qí zhèng)**, **like the deaf and blind (rú lóng máng)**.

The fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. Like the **phoenix chick (fèng xià)**, **it does not feed unless it finds the right place (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, then **it gathers (rán jié yǐ)**. **The fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. As the **phoenix chick (fèng chú)**, **it gazes downward at the four lands (xiàng dī yú sì fāng)**, **and only feeds on bamboo and grain (fèi zhú shí)**, **selecting the place where it can feed (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, **then gathering (rán jié yǐ)**.

The fifth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (gāo xiáng)**, **sinking its belly (yīn qí fù)**, **delighting in foul gruel (hǎo è jiù)**. **Guāng says:** *The carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (高翔)* is **found in rotten grain (zài fǔ liáng)**. The **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions read *jiù (粥)* as *shéng (绳)*, but now following the **Fàn (范)** and **Wáng (王)** versions. **Wú (吴)** says: *Jiù (粥)* is an ancient form of *yù (育)*. **Guāng says:** *The *Guānzǐ (管子)* says: *A woman does not abandon her husband (fù)*#42. **Jiù (粥)** shares the same **heart (xīn)** as *yù (育)*, with **good and evil (hǎo è)** read as the character itself. The fifth **color (sè)** holds **eminent rank (zūn wèi)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **It looks upward yet its aspirations are low (wàng gāo ér zhì q

As the carved eagle and fierce crow,
though its flight soars high,
it gazes downward at the rotting rat—
its intent fixed on seizing it
to fill its belly.
At first it seems virtuous,
yet ends in depravity—
thus it delights in *yù* (孕) yet spurns *yù* (育).

Next, the sixth:
Grain seen as piled treasure,
beneficial when rightly bestowed upon the king.
**Guāng says:** Grain piled high—
its Dao is manifest.
The **Fàn (范)** and **Wáng (王)** versions read *sù (粟)* as *piào (票)*;
now following the **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions.
The **Fàn (范)** version reads *lěi (累)* as *lěi (累)*;
now following the other editions.

Next, the seventh:
**Lí** like **Lóu** (离娄),
with crimson flesh and owl-like wings.
**Lì** says: **Lí** and **Lóu** with crimson flesh—
their food is unwholesome.
The seventh hexagram:
Red in use, resembling feathers.
Again, the seventh signifies lost resolve,
and occurs at night.
Though vision is as keen as **Lí** and **Lóu**,
seeing crimson flesh and taking it,
one gains only the foul bird.
To eat without choosing one’s fortune—
this is the path of peril.

Next, the eighth:
**Pàn** obtains its medicine,
beneficial for auspicious movement.
**Guāng says:** **Pàn** obtains its medicine—
auspicious for advancing.
The **Fàn (范)** and **Xiǎo Sòng (小宋)** versions read *lì zhēng (利征)* as *zhēng lì (征利)*;
now following the **Sòng (宋)**, **Lǔ (陆)**, and **Wáng (王)** versions.
The eighth hexagram is at the midpoint of calamity,
yet occurs in daylight—
thus it obtains medicine and auspicious movement.

At the top, the ninth:
Blood like **Gāng (刚)**,
sinking into the brow—
before death, then mourning.
**Guāng says:** Blood like **Gāng (刚)**, sinking into the brow—
it ends in ruin through greed.
The **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions read *xuè rú gāng (血如刚)*, *shěn yú méng (沈于颡)* as *rú xuè rú gāng (如血如刚)*, *shěn yú zhī méng (沈于之颡)*;
the **Wáng (王)** version reads *rú xuè rú gāng (如血如冈)*, *shěn yú zhī méng (沈于之颡)*;
the **Xiǎo Sòng (小宋)** version reads *rú xuè rú gāng (如血如冈)*, *shěn yú méng (沈於颡)*;
now following the **Fàn (范)** version.
**Wáng (王)** says: The path of peril and annihilation (#43),
arriving in succession—
thus before death, then mourning.
**Guāng** says: Blood—
like fat and moisture.
**Gāng (刚)** should be read as **Gāng (冈)**.
*Sinking*—
it bears the symbol of fishing profit.
The ninth hexagram is the extreme of calamity,
the exhaustion of resources,
the brow.
Fishing profits without end,
draining the people’s fat and moisture,
piling up like hills and ridges,
until it sinks into the brow, unaware—
thus peril and annihilation follow in turn.

Three regions, two states, one department, two families within—
**Yáng** family, **Huǒ** (Fire),
**Zhǔn** returns to **Méi** (darkness).

「Upon entering the inner [region], the third [division]—
thirteen degrees and twenty-two seconds [of celestial longitude],
the Sun aligns with **Dà Huǒ** (大火, the Great Fire star).

The **qi** of **Hán Lù** (寒露, Cold Dew) responds,
the **Dòu** (斗, Big Dipper) establishes its **shù** (戍, Station) position,
and the **lǜ** (律, musical pitch) corresponds to **Wú Shè** (无射, No Shooting).

Yin withdraws from within and remains without,
Yang withdraws from without and remains within—
the **completion** (既) of all things.

**Sòng** (宋) says: **Completion** (既) means **exhaustion** (尽).

On the first day, **cautious with one’s spouse** (谨于媐),
first **auspicious**, then **peaceful** (宁).

**Cè** (测) says: **Cautious with one’s spouse** (谨于婴),
it refers to **governing female affairs** (治女政).

The **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) versions of *governing female affairs* (治女政) read *shǐ nǚ zhèng* (始女政),
now following the **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆) versions.

**Mǎi** (媐), an ancient form of **fēi** (妃, consort) or **chóu** (仇, rival).

**Fàn** (范) says: [媐] means **match** (匹).

To be **cautious with one’s spouse** (谨其妃匹),
the **Dao** of male and female aligns,
and the **proper order** (正室) of households is established.

**Guāng** (光) says: **Inner** (内) symbolizes the **household and family** (室家).

At the **beginning** (初) of dwelling within,
thus the **two warnings** (二戒) are given.

In the *Book of Changes* **[Hexagram] □** **[Line] Jiā Rén** (家人, Family),
the first nine: **Leisurely at home** (闲有家), **regret vanishes** (悔亡).

On the second day, **erroneous within** (邪其内主),
**wandering far** (迂) in the **yellow groves** (黄林).

**Cè** (测) says: **Erroneous within** (邪其内主),
far from **peace** (宁).

The **Fàn** (范) version reads *nǎi* (乃) instead of *hú* (乎),
now following the **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) versions.

**Fàn** (范) says: **Inner** (内) **main** (主) refers to the **wife** (妇).
**Wander** (迂) means **far** (远).
**Yellow** (黄) means **central** (中).

**Xiǎo Sòng** says: The **bed** (床) is where one finds **rest** (安).

**Line Three**: *"You conduct yourself with propriety yet weep"* (尔仪而悲), *"the pit beneath my western stair"* (坎我西阶).

**Cè** says: *"You conduct yourself with propriety yet weep"* (尔仪而悲) — this is the **filial sentiment for one’s mother-in-law** (代母情).

**Fàn** says: *"The pit"* (坎) means **sorrow** (忧).
In the **ceremony of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之道), the **bride ascends the western stair** (妇升西阶).
There is the **virtue of substituting for one’s parents** (代亲之义), hence the **weeping** (故悲).

**Wáng** says: *"Conduct"* (仪) means **matching** (匹).
**Xiǎo Sòng** cites *The Rites of Marriage* (**《昏义》**) thus:
*"At dawn"* (厥明), the **father-in-law and mother-in-law** (舅姑) **feast the bride** (共飨妇), **offering the ritual libation of one cup** (以一献之礼奠酬#44).
The **father-in-law and mother-in-law descend first from the western stair** (舅姑先降自西阶), the **bride descends from the eastern stair** (妇降自阼阶), **to signify substitution** (以着代).

**Line Four**: *"Delighting in trifles, delighting in peril"* (好小好危), *"losing her coarse robe"* (丧其缊袍), **dangerous** (厉).

**Cè** says: *"Delighting in trifles, delighting in peril"* (好小好危) — this is **unworthy of honor** (不足荣).

The **Fàn** version reads *yùn* (蕴) instead of *yùn* (缊), the **Wáng** version reads *bǎo* (饱) instead of *páo* (袍); now following the **Sòng** and **Lù** versions.

**Line Five**: *"The dragon sinks into the mud"* (龙下于泥), *"the virtuous person gains advantage by taking a wife"* (君子利用取媐), *"meeting the common and the equal"* (遇庸夷).

**Cè** says: *"The dragon sinks into the mud"* (龙下于泥) — **yang descending into yin** (阳下阴).

The **Wáng** version reads *fū* (肤) instead of *yōng* (庸); now following the other versions.
*"Taking"* (取) is the same as *"to wed"* (娶).

**Fàn** says: *"The dragon"* (龙) **illustrates yang** (以谕阳).
**Yang descending into yin** (阳下于阴) is the **meaning of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之义).

**Guāng** says: In the **ceremony of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之礼), the **groom drives the carriage three circuits** (婿御轮三周) — this is **yang descending into yin** (阳下阴).
**Yōng** (庸) means **obtaining the norm** (得其常).
**Yí** (夷) means **equality** (等夷).

**Sixth Hexagram:**
*"At dusk, the bird flies and tucks its wings inward.
Though it would fill the palace, its mate is unseen."*
**Cè** says: *"At dusk, tucking its wings"*—it cannot restrain itself.
**Wáng** says: The sixth position is at its peak yet loses its proper place at night, contrary to the principle of dwelling within.
*"At dusk, the bird flies"*—it has no fixed abode.
*"Tucks its wings inward"*—it cannot restrain itself within.
*"Though it would fill the palace"*—its desire is boundless.
*"Its mate is unseen"*—it loses the way of pairing, gaining nothing in the end.

**Seventh Hexagram:**
*"On a crumbling wall, weeds sprout.
A white-haired man takes his young wife—prosperity."
**Cè** says: *"Weeds on a crumbling wall"*—things rejoice in finding their kind.
*(Wáng version reads *xiù* [秀] for *yǒu* [莠]; now following other versions.)*
*(Fàn, Xiǎo Sòng versions read *wù* [勿] for *wù* [物]; now following Sòng, Lù, and Wáng versions.)*
**Hù** (皬) is pronounced *hú-jué* [胡觉].
**Fàn** says: *"White but impure"* is called *hù*.
**Guāng** says: The seventh marks the beginning of calamity, yet occurs in daylight—declining yet reviving.
*"Prosperity"* means *wealth*.
*"Things rejoice in finding their kind"*—creatures delight in their own.
The *Yì* says: *"A withered willow bears grain,
An old man takes a young wife—
No misfortune remains."*

**Eighth Hexagram:**
*"Within, he cannot conquer his wife,
Bringing ruin to household and state,
Wading deep waters, unmeasured."
**Cè** says: *"Cannot conquer his wife"*—a state’s sin.
*(Fàn version reads *bùkěcè* [不可测] for *bùcè* [不测]; now following other versions.)*
**Fàn** says: *"Conquer"* means *overcome*.
**Ninth (Uppermost) Line:**
*"Rain descends to earth—
It cannot stop, cannot pass.
**Cè** says: *"Rain descends to earth"*—proper moderation of moisture.
*(Three regions, two states, one department, three families depart—
The Yin house’s wood, aligned with *Wúwàng* [无妄]).*

「The Han scholars interpreted *Wúwàng* [无妄] as "no further expectations," so Yángzǐ [扬子] thus criticized their reading.

**Cè** [测] says: *"Meng* [妄] means *reckless action*; *wàng* [望] means *not what one expects*—this takes both meanings together.

When *Yin* [阴] departs from its *Yáng* [阳], and *Yáng* departs from its *Yin*, all things flourish and disperse in wild confusion.
*Tì* [倜] (pronounced *zhāngliú* [张留]) and *chàng* [倡] (pronounced *chāng* [昌]).
At this time, *Yin* and *Yáng* are both departing, their roles yet undetermined, and all things are in wild confusion, unsure of their place.

**Wáng** [王] says: *Tì* [倜] is the same as *zhuó* [侜], meaning all things are rampant and scattered.

**First (Lowermost) Line:**
*"Depart from this* **Língyuān** [灵渊], *abandon that* **Kūyuán** [枯园].
**Cè** [测] says: *"Depart from this* **Língyuān** [灵渊]"—not by the virtue of humility, but by arrogance.
**Fàn** [范] says: *One* [一] represents *water*, which is lowest in rank, hence *"Língyuān"* [灵渊].
To depart from the low is to seek the high—this is not the Dao of humility.

**Xiǎo Sòng** [小宋] says: *"Kūyuán"* [枯园] is like *"high above"* [高上].
**Guāng** [光] says: *"Kūyuán"* [枯园]—when trees wither, it is because the land is high and lacks nourishment.

*One* [一] is the beginning of *thought* [思], occurring at *night* [夜].
The common folk, weary of lowliness, think of the high, desiring to depart from this and follow that—this will surely bring calamity.

**Second Line:**
*"Depart from that* **Kūyuán** [枯园], *abandon this* **Língyuān** [灵渊].
**Cè** [测] says: *"Abandon this* **Língyuān** [灵渊]"—this is the radiance of the humble Dao.
*Two* [二] represents *thought in the middle*, occurring at *day* [昼].
The sage considers those beneath him, hence the radiance of humility.

**Third Line:**
*"He raises his steps,
To the hall with dew upon them."
**Cè** [测] says: *"Raising his steps with dew"*—this is reckless action.
*(Fàn [范], Xiǎo Sòng [小宋] originally read *mengshēng* [妄升]; Wáng [王] read *ānxíng* [安行]; now following Sòng [宋] and Lù [陆] versions.)*
Dew clinging to one’s garments is an omen of misfortune and disgrace.
*Three* [三] is the fulfillment of *intent*, occurring at *night* [夜].
The common folk, seeing high rank, strive toward it,
Unwittingly stepping into misfortune and disgrace.

**Fourth Line:**
*"Depart from son and father,
Depart from minister and lord."
**Cè** [测] says: *"Depart from son and father"*—this is not what one expects.
*(Fàn [范] originally read *qù yú fùzǐ* [去于父子]; now following Xiǎo Sòng [小宋], Lù [陆], and Wáng [王] versions.)*
**Wáng** [王] says: *Four* [四] has already attained its proper place and occurs at *day* [昼].
To depart from it is fitting.
Departing from the son to follow the father,
Departing from the minister to follow the lord—
This aligns with the order of reverence and subordination,
And thus no blame or regret arises.

**Guāng** [光] says: *Four* [四] is the beginning of *fortune*, occurring at *day* [昼].
To depart from the low and attain the high is fortune beyond expectation,
Hence it is said *"not what one expects."*

**Fifth Line:**
*"He grasps his garments,
To the courtyard where there are* **mí** [麋].
**Cè** [测] says: *"Grasping his garments with* **mí** [麋]"—this is also cause for dread.
**Xiǎo Sòng** [小宋] says: *"Grasp"* [攓] is pronounced *qiān* [愆], meaning to lift.
**Guāng** [光] says: *"Grasping his garments and moving"*—there are thorns and brambles in the courtyard.
A *mí* [麋] deer wandering in the courtyard is a sign of a ruined state.
Fear and dread arise from these emotions,
And *five* [五] represents *garments*, holding an elevated position but occurring at *night* [夜].
He is about to depart from his station and lose his state—how could he not fear?

**Sixth Line:**
*"He himself departs from* **chéng** [成], *heaven bestows its name upon him."
**Cè** [测] says: *"He himself departs from* **chéng** [成]"—this is the virtue of *retreating without lingering*.
*(Xiǎo Sòng [小宋] and Lù [陆] originally read *chéng* [城]; now following Fàn [范] and Wáng [王] versions.)*
*Rǎng* [攘] is the ancient form of *ràng* [让].
*Yí* [遗] is pronounced *yuè* [醉].
**Fàn** [范] says: *Six* [六] is the position of *uppermost blessing*, and the nature of his family is to depart.
When his work is complete, he retires—thus heaven bestows his name upon him.

**Seventh Line:**
*"He departs from* **dézhēn** [德贞], *three deaths do not cease."
**Cè** [测] says: *"Depart from* **dézhēn** [德贞]"—this is the end of shameful ruin.
**Fàn** [范] says: *"Lìng* [令]" means *good*.
**Wáng** [王] says: *Seven* [七] is in a position of excess and has already lost its place, occurring at *night* [夜].
*Guāi* [乖]—it is fitting to depart from it.
To depart from what is *evil* is nothing compared to abandoning one’s *virtue, power, and uprightness* [德贞].
Thus, even though three deaths may come,
There remains the name of *"not ceasing"* [不令]—it is not extinguished.
*Three* [三] here means *many*.

**Eighth Line:**
*"The moon is high in its arc,
The fire is near its suspension—
One cannot stir, stirring brings* **qiān** [愆].
**Cè** [测] says: *"The moon arcs, the fire suspends"*—this is cause for fearing blame.
*Jī* [几] is pronounced *qí* [祈] or *jī* [居衣].
*Suspension* [县] is the ancient form of *xuán* [悬].
**Fàn** [范] says: *"The moon is high in its arc"*—this is beyond the twenty-day mark.
*Fire* [火] refers to *Dàhuǒ* [大火].
When the fire is near suspension, the year is drawing to a close.
*Eight* [八] is the position of *old age and infirmity*, corresponding to eighty years in one’s lifespan.
As the moon wanes when stirred, and the fire’s days decline,
He retires from office, leaving his *chēng* [成] (accomplished work) behind,
And entrusts his teachings to the younger generation—
He cannot stir recklessly, lest he bring calamity.

Guang says: *"Within the fire, cold and heat withdraw.*
Eight marks decay, like peeling—
As when a man grows old and frail,
He should remain still, not stir.

*Upper Nine*: Seeking myself, I find none—
I turn toward the west-north.
Cè says: *"Seeking myself, how can I endure?"*
Little Song cites *Xuántú* [玄图]: *"No yang is born like the Child—
West-north, and the Child’s beauty is spent."*

Guang says: *"West-north is the yin position;
Nine marks exhaustion, annihilation—
At the peak of departure, facing night.
Already gone, so I seek in vain.
Like the sun and the year,
Moving from west into north—
How can they endure long?"*

Three regions, two states, two departments, one household grow dark.
The Yang family’s gold aligns with *Míngyí* [明夷].

Entering darkness, the seventh rank—
The sun lodges in *Fáng* [房].
Yin ascends upon yang, yang descends into yin—
All things lose their brightness.
*Hom* [丧], pronounced *xīlàng* [息浪].

Wang says: *"All things rely on yang for brightness;
When yang descends, they lose their light."*

*First Rank*: Like the void, yet alone seeing *yōuzhēn* [幽贞].
Cè says: *"Like the void, yet alone seeing—
This is the central illumination."*

Wang says: *"In the dark and dim,
Yet occupying the proper position,
Thus: ‘Like the void, yet alone seeing.’
Guarding oneself in the depths of obscurity,
Without losing its rectitude."*

Guang says: *"One marks ‘thought below,’
Also ‘below below,’
Fitting the sun’s position,
Thus able to see *yōuzhēn*."*

*Second Rank*: Blind, advancing into *pǐ* [否].
Cè says: *"Blind, advancing into *pǐ*—
Brightness does not see the Way."*

*Pǐ*, pronounced *fāngjiǔ* [方久], differs from *bù* [不同].
Wang says: *"In darkness and dimness,
Yet losing the proper position for night—
Further darkened.
Then, blindly advancing,
There must be fear of stumbling."*

Guang says: *"Two marks ‘thought in the middle,’
Yet facing night,
Thus this symbol arises."*

*Third Rank*: Yin moves, yang follows—
Favorable to action, not ominous.
Cè says: *"Yin moves, yang follows—
Matters extend outward."*

Wang and Range’s text reads *"must"* (*bì* [必]), now following Song and Lu’s *"action"* (*zuò* [作]).

*Fourth Rank*: Its kind grows dark—
Losing the *jīnkuì* [金匮].
Cè says: *"Its kind grows dark—
Laws and measures decay."*

Range says: *"Four is metal.
Yet in its course,
In an age of darkness,
Thus: ‘Its kind grows dark.’"*

Guang says: *"Laws and measures uphold the state,
Like the *kuì* [匮] securing gold.
Within a single state,
There may be darkness and brightness—
Laws and measures may still be upheld.
But if darkness prevails and is further obscured,
Conforming to flattery, clustering like one,
Then laws and measures decay.
Four marks ‘lower fortune,’
‘External otherness,’
Yet facing night—
Thus this symbol arises."*

*Fifth Rank*: The sun stands central,
The moon reaches its peak—
The virtuous man hides himself, does not enter *qióng* [穷].
Cè says: *"Sun central, moon at its height—
Brightness fears being blunted."*

Wang says: *"Five marks central harmony,
Yet also occupies the proper position.
At the sun’s zenith and moon’s fullness,
Yet restraining excess,
Hiding his traces.
Having grasped the principles of waxing and waning,
Flexion and extension,
His Way does not reach exhaustion."*

*Sixth Rank*: The *Xuānnǎo* [玄鸟] bears sorrow—
Brightness descends into obscurity.
Cè says: *"The *Xuānnǎo* bears sorrow—
It will descend into dimness."*

Wang says: *"The *Xuānwū* [玄乌], the knowing crow.
Six is at peak fullness,
Yet loses the proper position for night—
A symbol of departing brightness toward obscurity."*

Little Song says: *"The *Xuānwū* is *yǐ* [乙].*
Guang says: *"Six marks *kuòtiān* [廓天],
Venturing into early autumn—
Thus this symbol arises."*

*Seventh Rank*: *Tí* [提] the brightness—
Or follow its path.
Cè says: *"*Tí* the brightness—
Virtue will follow its course."*

Song and Lu’s text reads *"shèng"* [睄], pronounced *xījǐng* [息井], meaning *"provincial"* (*shěng* [省]), or *"awaken"* (*xǐng* [醒]).
Little Song pronounces it *miǎo* [眇], meaning *"one-eyed"* (*yīmáng* [一目盲]).
Song and Lu’s *"tí"* reads *"dí"* [𠫗], pronounced *dōulí* [都黎].
All other commentaries omit *"virtue"* (*dé* [德]).
Range’s text reads *"shèng tí míng dé"* [睄提明德], mistakenly following Cè.
Range says: *"*Shèng* [睄] and *shào* [哨]—
Blindness of the eyes."*
Meaning aligns with *miǎo* [眇].
Now following Wang’s text.

---

**Wang’s text** omits the *"follow"* (*zūn*) character in *Cè*’s commentary. Now following the other commentaries.

**Wang says#57:**
*"Shèng* [睄]—
The ancient term for *xiāo* [宵] (night).*
When the seventh line attains its proper position, it should be day.
Yet within the night, *tí* [提] the brightness shines forth on its own,
or follows its course—
thus it does not lose the *Dao/Way* (*dào*).

*Tí* [提] the brightness—
refers to the kind of *candle* (*zhú* 烛).

**Guang says:**
*"The seventh line represents *consumption* (*xiāo* 消) or *decay* (*bài sǔn* 殆损),
and bears the symbol of night,
yet it corresponds to the day’s position,
hence it is called *tí* [提] the brightness.

*Virtue/Power* (*dé* 德)—
refers to those with *bright virtue* (*míng dé* 明德).
In times of darkness and confusion,
those with bright virtue will lead the masses,
and all will follow them.
Like a candle in the night,
all will follow its light.

**Eighth Rank:** *Shì* [视] not its true form,
*plucking* (*yí* 夷) its right eye—
*ruin of the state* (*miè guó* 灭国), *loss of the family* (*sāng jiā* 丧家).

**Cè says:**
*"Shì* [视] not its true form, *plucking* (*yí* 夷) its eye—
the state will suffer loss."

All other texts render *true* (*zhēn* 真) as *straight* (*zhí* 直).
Now following **Song and Lu’s text**.
All other commentaries render *yí* [夷] as *pluck* (*shì* 视直夷目),
but now following **Range’s text**.

**Range says:**
*"Yí* [夷]—
*injury* (*shāng* 伤)."
**Guang says:**
*"The eighth line represents *severe illness* (*jí yū* 疾瘀) or *exhaustion* (*hào* 耗),
and yet it corresponds to night,
hence this symbol arises.

**Ninth Rank:** *Huì míng míng* [晦冥冥]—
*advantageous for the unenlightened* (*bù míng* 不明) in *constancy* (*zhēn* 貞).

**Cè says:**
*"The advantage of *huì* [晦] and *míng* [冥]—
it cannot stand alone in brightness."

**Song, Lu, and Wang’s texts** render *"the advantage of *huì míng míng*"* as *"*huì* in the upper and lower"* (*huì zài shàng xià* 晦在上下).
**Little Song’s text** renders it as *"*huì míng míng*"* (*晦冥冥*).
Now following **Range’s text**.

The ninth line reaches *huì*’s extreme,
yet corresponds to day.
The *gentleman* (*jūnzǐ* 君子) may employ *huì* (obscurity) as his method,
and thus it will be sufficient.

The *Yì* (*Book of Changes*) says:
*"When internal troubles arise yet one can steadfastly uphold the will,
Jiūzǐ [箕子] used this."*

It also says:
*"Jiū’s *Míng Yí* [明夷], advantageous in constancy."*

**Three regions, two states, two departments, two families** of *mèng* [瞢].

*Mèng* [瞢]—
ancient term for *mèng* [梦] (dream), also pronounced *mò dēng* [莫登].

**Yáng**’s family *tǔ* [土] (earth) also aligns with *Míng Yí* [明夷].
**Entering Pǔ**’s commentary, the sixth rank—
**31°13′**#59, corresponding to the *Qi* of *Frost’s Descent* (*Shuāng Jiàng Qì* 霜降气).

**Eighth Rank:** *Rì shě xīn* [日舍心].
*Huì* [晦]—
*outer darkness* (*wài àn* 外暗);
*Mèng* [瞢]—
*inner confusion* (*yīn hūn* 内昏).

Some say:
*"Huì* twice—
*blind* (*máng* 盲) *negation* (*pǐ* 否), not inner confusion.
*Mèng* twice—
*bright* (*míng* 明) *abdomen* (*fù* 腹), *lost in the sky* (*rǎn tiān* 睒天), not outer darkness."

It says#60:
*"The constant has no steadfast *virtue/Power* (*dé* 德),
the *restraint* (*jié* 节) has no restraint.
If the line and the hexagram oppose each other,
it is contrary.
*Blind* (*máng* 盲)—
contrary to *bright* (*míng* 明).
*Bright* (*míng* 明)—
contrary to *confused* (*mèng* 瞢).
The *yīn* (*yin*) line portends *south*,
the *yáng* (*yang*) line portends *north*.
When things lose their *bright constancy* (*míng zhēn* 明贞),
none escape *confusion* (*mèng* 瞢).

**Wú’s text** renders *portends* (*zhēng* 征) as *extends* (*yán* 延),
saying *zhēng* is the ancient term for *yán*.
**Wang’s text** renders it as *approaches* (*jìn* 近)—
a mistake.
**Lu says:**
*"The *yáng* (positive) line in the south
means all things gather to be seen at *Lí* [离].
Now it is in the north,
hence it is called *mèng* [瞢]."

**First Rank:** *Mèng fù rǎn tiān* [瞢腹睒天]—
*not seeing its boundaries* (*bù dǔ qí zhēn* 不睹其畛).

**Cè says:**
*"Mèng fù rǎn tiān* [瞢腹睒天]—
*no ability to see*."

**Range’s text** renders *"*mèng fù* [瞢腹]"* and *"*míng fù* [明腹]"* as *"repeated"* (*fù* 复).
It renders *boundaries* (*zhēn* 畛) as *sorrow* (*zhěn* 轸)—
now following **Song, Lu, and Wang’s texts**.

*Rǎn* [睒]—
pronounced *shī rǎn* [失冉].
*Zhēn* [畛]—
pronounced *zhāng rěn* [章忍], also *zhēn* [真].

**Range says:**
*"Rǎn* [睒]—
*glimpse* (*kuī* 窥)."
**Wang says:**
*"Rǎn* [睒]—
*temporary vision* (*zàn shì* 暂视)."

When the line loses its proper position, corresponding to night,
its heart and abdomen are in confusion,
temporarily gazing at the sky—
how could it know the boundaries?

**Guang says:**
*"The sky is vast beyond measure,
yet difficult to discern.
The first line represents the *beginning of contemplation* (*sī shǐ* 思始),
and yet it corresponds to night,
hence this symbol arises.

**Second Rank:** *Míng fù rǎn tiān* [明腹睒天]—
*seeing its roots* (*dǔ qí gēn* 睹其根).

**Cè says:**
*"Míng fù rǎn tiān* [明腹睒天]—
*only the center is bright*."

**Range says:**
*"The second line represents the *eyes* (*mù* 目),
hence it is *bright* (*míng*).
*Làn* [烂]—
*bright* (*míng*).
**Wang says:**
*"Attaining its proper position and corresponding to the day,
it reveals the brightness within the abdomen,
gazing upward at the sky—
it must surely investigate its fundamental roots."*

**Guang says:**
*"The second line represents the *midpoint of contemplation* (*sī zhōng* 思中),
and yet it corresponds to the day,
hence this symbol arises.

**Third Rank:** *Shī huò dǎo shè* [师或导射]—
*its target* (*qí zhì* 其埻) *like a piglet* (*tún* 豚).

**Cè says:**
*"Shī huò dǎo shè* [师或导射]—
*no means to execute*."

**Wang’s text** renders *dǎo* [导] as *zūn* [遵]#61—
now following **Song, Lu, and Range’s texts**.
**Wang and Little Song’s texts** render *tún* [豚] as *dùn* [遁]—
ancient characters were interchangeably used.

*Zhì* [埻]—
pronounced *yǐn* [尹].

**Range says:**
*"Shī* [师]—
*a blind guide* (*gǔ shī* 瞽者).
*Tún* [豚]—
*to flee* (*dùn* 遁).
*Zhì* [埻]—
*the mark of the target*."

**Guang says:**
*"The third line represents the *height of contemplation* (*sī chóng* 思之崇),
as *advancing* (*jìn rén* 进人) or *stocks and arms* (*gū gāng* 肱股),
yet it corresponds to night.
Like a blind guide instructing others in shooting,
it must surely distance its target,
and cannot hit.
*Tún* [豚]—
*just as ‘distant’* (*yuǎn* 远) is meant.

**Fourth Rank:** *Jiàn zhēn bù mí* [鉴贞不迷]—
*advantageous for the people* (*yú rén yú zī* 于人攸资).

**Cè says:**
*"Jiàn zhēn bù mí* [鉴贞不迷]—
*truly trustworthy*."

**Range says:**
*"The fourth line represents *metal* (*jīn* 金),
hence it is *mirror* (*jiàn* 鉴).
The upright mirror—
though it does not mislead itself,
how much more so when it aids the virtuous in governance?
*Zī* [资]—
*to take*."

**Wang says:**
*"Attaining its proper position and corresponding to the day,
it is the one who can rectify the mirror,
without confusion.
Not only does it rectify itself,
but it also serves as a resource for others.
*Zī* [资]—
*to take its brightness*."

**Fifth Rank:** *Bèi míng fǎn guāng* [倍明反光]—
*encountering* (*chù* 触) *Móng* [蒙] *in confusion* (*hūn* 昏).

**Cè says:**
*"Bèi míng fǎn guāng* [倍明反光]—
*betrayal by the people*."

**Song and Lu’s texts** render it as *"*people’s peril*"* (*rén suǒ jīn* 人所濒),
**Range’s text** renders it as *"*people may frequent*"* (*rén kě pín* 人可频),
**Little Song’s text** renders it as *"*people’s frequenting*"* (*rén suǒ pín* 人所频).
Now following **Wang’s text**.

**Wang says:**
*"Fǎn* [反]—
ancient term for *fǎn* [返] (to return).
The fifth line is in the *proper position* (*chéng wèi* 盛位),
yet it dwells in *yin* (negative), corresponding to night—
*lost and not recovering*,
hence it bears the symbol of *turning away from brightness*."

**Song and Lu’s texts** render *"*frequent*"* as *"*maō* [姽]"*.
**Little Song’s text** renders *"*yù* [且]"* as *"*qí* [其]"*,
and *"*maō*"* (*qí yī* 其腰) as *"*yī* [腰]"*,
pronounced *yú* [居] *yí* [宜] (cutting),
meaning *slender-waisted beauty* (*xì yāo měi fù* 细腰美妇).
Now following **Range and Wang’s texts**.

*Maō* [姽]—
pronounced *niú wěi* [牛委]#63.

**Translation:**

*"Maō* [姽]—
pronounced *guǒ* [果] *wǔ* [五] *èr* [二] (cutting).
**Range says:**
*Maō*—small in appearance.

**Wang says:**
Sixth line in the *yin* position;
also corresponds to *huà* [画] (the *guà* hexagram),
when *máng* [瞢] (darkness) is dominant—
it governs those lost in confusion, setting them aright.
*Mángmáng* [瞢瞢] *lí* [离]—
from darkness to clarity.
*Yíng* [荧]—small light;
there is bewilderment.
*Yǐ* [且]—weakness.
**Light says:**
From darkness to clarity—
without vigor, it cannot prevail,
hence it is unsuited to *yíng* and *yǐ*.
Seventh line: *máng* [瞢] *hǎo* [好], revealing what is detested.
**Light says:**
The detested in *máng* is not obscured.
**Range’s text** reads *"not obscured"* (*zhuó bù mèi* 著不可昧),
**Wang’s text** reads *"obscured"* (*zhuó mèi* 著昧).
Now following **Song and Lu’s texts**.

Eighth line: *hūn* [昏] *chén* [辰] benefits the moon,
small *zhēn* [贞], not yet reaching the stars.
**Light says:**
*Hūn chén* benefits the moon—
still worthy of aspiration.
**Range’s text** reads *"not yet reaching"* (*wèi jì xīng* 未及星),
**Wang’s text** reads *"not yet"* (*mò yǒu jì xīng* 末有及星).
**Song says:**
The moon follows the sun,
so it remains worthy of longing.

Upper ninth line: *shí* [时] *cuōcuō* [蹉蹉],
not attaining its blessings.
For men: broken *jì* [笄];
for women: changed *kuài* [哿].
**Light says:**
Not attaining blessings—
men die, women lament.
**Wang’s text** reads *suàn* [算] for *jì*.
**Wang** takes *cuō* [磋] as ancient *jiē* [嗟].
*Kuài* is *jiā* [珈], pronounced *jiā* [加].

**Three regions, two states, two departments, three families:**
*Yang* family—water, *zhǔn* [准] in *kùn* [困].
Entering *qióng* [穷] at the ninth line,
the sun rests at the tail.
*Yīn* qi blocks the *yǔ* [宇] (heavenly expanse),
*Yang* loses its place—
all things reach their utmost exhaustion.
**Little Song’s text** reads *"grouped yīn"* (*qún yīn* 群阴) for *yīn* qi,
**Wang and Little Song’s texts** read *"exhausted"* (*qióng chù* 穷处) for *qióng jù* [穷遽].
Now following **Song, Lu, and Range’s texts**.
The *liù hé* [六合] (six extremes) is called *yǔ* [宇].

First line: *qióng* its *qióng*,
and the people favor the middle.
**Light says:**
*Qióng* its *qióng*—
emotion resides in the center.

Second line: *Qióng* not *qióng*,
and the people do not center.
**Light says:**
*Qióng* not *qióng*—
deceit may flourish.

Third line: *Qióng* seeks *dá* [达].
**Light says:**
*Qióng* seeks *dá*—
the teacher is in the heart.
**Wang’s text** reads *sī* [思] for *shī* [师],
**Little Song’s text** reads *zhōng* [中] for *xīn* [心].
Now following **Song, Lu, and Range’s texts**.
Third line signifies completion,
advancing the person—
those in *kùn* who study it
can exhaust their minds,
and thus nothing remains unreached—
what need for a distant teacher?

Fourth line: *Tǔ* [土] not harmonized,
*shù* [木] *kē* [科] *tuǒ* [椭].
**Light says:**
*Tǔ* not harmonized—
a disease among the people.
*Tuǒ*—pronounced *tú hé* [徒和].
**Wang says:**
*Kē tuǒ*—wood’s affliction.
**Light says:**
Fourth line is *xià lù* [下禄] (lower fortune),
yet it corresponds to night.
The petty gain position,
exhausting the people for self-indulgence.
When the people are exhausted, the state is in peril—
like barren soil, the roots are diseased.
**Yǒu Zǐ** says:
If the people lack, who shall have abundance?

Fifth line: *Gēng* [羹] without *sàn* [糁],
its belly *kǎnkǎn* [坎坎],
not losing its *fàn* [范].
**Light says:**
Food without *sàn*—
yet it does not stray from rectitude.
**Range’s text** reads *"praise"* (*zàn* 赞) and *"Light"* (*guāng* 光) both as *"gēng without sàn"* (*gēng wú sàn* 羹无糁).
Now following **Song, Lu, and Wang’s texts**.
*Sàn*—pronounced *sāng gǎn* [桑感].
**Wang says:**
Holding the central position,
it is the master of *qióng* (exhaustion),
not straying from the propriety of *qióng*.
*Gēng* without *sàn*—
its belly hollow and impoverished,
yet it does not lose the model of the sage.
The beauty of dwelling in *qióng* is unmatched.
**Chén** says:
*Sàn*—broken rice.

Sixth line: *Shān* [山] without *jiǎo* [角],
*shuǐ* [水] without *lín* [鳞],
*kùn* [困] offends the body.
**Light says:**
*Shān* without *jiǎo*—
exhausting the people.
Burning mountains for hunting,
draining marshes for fishing—
though gains may be plentiful,
there will be none to follow.
Heavy taxation exhausts the people,
and when the people are exhausted,
they rebel—disaster will surely strike the ruler.

Seventh line: *Zhèng* [正] its foot,
*dì* [蹛] at *bì yú* [狴狱],
seen in three years.
**Light says:**
*Zhèng* its foot—
danger turned to safety.
*Bì*—pronounced *bì* [弊].
**Wang says:**
*Dì*—same as *dié* [跌].
Holding position yet encountering *huà* [画],
*zhèng* foot meets *dié*.
This exhaustion is not self-invited.
*Lù* [录]—lenient recording, read as *lǜ* [虑].
Exhaustion without losing rectitude—
it is fitting that danger yields to safety.
**Little Song** says:
*Dì*—pronounced *dài* [带], meaning *tà* [蹈].
**Light says:**
*Bì*—a prison.
Seventh line avoids blame yet incurs disaster,
hence this symbol.

Eighth line: *Shè* [涉] through frost and snow,
*léi* [累] the *tóu* [项] at *xī* [膝].
**Light says:**
*Léi* the *tóu* at *xī*—
also insufficient for life.
**Song and Lu’s texts** read *dǐng* [顶] for *tóu*.
Now following **Range, Wang, and Little Song’s texts**.
*Xī*—same as *xī* [膝].
**Wang says:**
Losing position at night,
unable to steady its foot,
wading through frost and snow,
encountering peril.
*Léi* the *tóu* at *xī*—
the severity of imprisonment.

Upper ninth line: *Pò* [破] *bì* [璧], *huǐ* [毁] *guī* [圭],
saying *"zào* [灶] produces *wā* [蛙]",
*tiān* [天] brings calamity through others.
**Light says:**
*Pò bì huǐ guī*—
meeting misfortune.
**Range’s text** reads *á* [鼋] for *wā*,
pronounced *měng* [猛].
Now following **Song, Lu, and Wang’s texts**.
*Wā*—pronounced *wū wā* [乌娲].
**Wang says:**
The time has reached its extreme,
unable to return to openness—
though holding position at day,
it is not spared from calamity.
*Pò bì huǐ guī*—
losing its treasures.
*"Zào* produces *wā*"—
nothing left to eat.
Great calamity from others—
blame is not self-made.
**Light says:**

**Translation:**

*"Pò bì huǐ guī*—though his person is precious,
he meets with misfortune in his time.
The extremity of calamity,
the utmost of adversity—
thus this symbol arises.

**Collective Commentary on *The Great Mystery Classic*, Volume Six**
*Three Directions, Two Provinces, Three Departments, One Household—Severance*

**Yin House, Fire Phase** (aligned with *Bao*):
When *yin qi* severs, *yang* form is executed—
in seven days, near exhaustion.

*Song* and *Lu* editions read *xíng* (刑, "punishment"); here, following *Fan*, *Wang*, and *Xiao Song* editions.

*Xiao Song* edition reads *qún yīn* (群阴, "collective *yin*").
*Song* says: *"Shā"* (杀) means *"shuāi"* (衰, "to decline"), sharp and precise.
*Wang* says: When *yin qi* prevails, it slays all things.
*Yang* form decays, thus it is executed—
slain by *yin qi*.

Read as written.

**First Day:** Sever its ears and eyes, its heart and belly—*calamity*.
*Ce* says: Sever its ears and eyes—
the inner lacks the outer.

*Wang* edition reads *zhōng wài wú* (中外无, "inner and outer nonexistent"); here, following *Song*, *Lu*, and *Fan* editions.

Ears and eyes are what guard the heart and belly.
Severed, the heart and belly are in peril.
One—*thinking* begins—
and the night follows.

The petty man hates loyalty, fears counsel,
self-destroying his wisdom.

**Second Day:** Sever its warts and excrescences—*advantageous, without filth*.
*Ce* says: Sever its warts and excrescences?
It cannot grow great.

*Wart* (*yōu*), pronounced *yōu*.
*Excrescence* (*zhuì*), pronounced *zhī-yīn*.

*Wang* says: Warts and excrescences are the body’s evils.
Severed and removed, they no longer grow.
*Guang* says:

The second day’s *thinking* reaches the *drawing*—
the noble one attacks his own vices,
preventing them from growing great.

The third day: Sever nose to feed mouth—
losing its *qi*-master.
*Ce* says: Severing the nose to lose the master—
to diminish without honor.
The *Yu* edition reads *food* as *sweetmeat*; here, following *Lu*, *Fan*, and *Wang* editions.

*Fan* says: The nose is the master of *qi*-breath.
*Wang* says: Severing it improperly is like severing the nose to feed the mouth.

The fourth day: Butchering evenly, balanced.
*Ce* says: Butchering evenly, balanced—
it can achieve completion.
*Wang* says: The fourth day marks the height of ministers,
yet it faces the *drawing*—
butchering things with equitable *virtue*.
*Guang* says: The fourth day is the beginning of lower blessings,
when the noble one first attains position.

The fifth day: Sever its thighs and arms—
losing its war-horses.
*Ce* says: Severing its thighs and arms—
losing great ministers.
The *Song* and *Lu* editions read *forget* as *t*; the *Wang* edition reads *none*—
here, following the *Fan* edition.
*Wang* says: The fifth day holds the ruler’s position,
yet it faces the *night*.
Without the ruler’s *virtue*,
it is severing its thighs and arms to seek order—
properly losing what it rides upon.

*Guang* says: War-horses are what bear the yoke and flank the axle,
bearing heavy loads and traveling far—
also symbols of great ministers.

The sixth day: Severing without wounding—
feasted by the four quarters.
*Ce* says: Severing without wounding—
the Dao can be divided.
The sixth day holds a position of prosperity,
yet it faces the *day*.
Distributing its Dao, teaching without end,
nurturing the people boundlessly—
the four quarters lack nothing,
yet the Dao suffers no loss.

The seventh day: Purple *zhuó* and *yú* clouds,
companions encircling the sun—
its sickness cannot be severed.
*Ce* says: Purple *zhuó* and *yú* clouds—
they do not know to be carved away.
The *Song* and *Lu* editions read *not advantageous to carve*—
here, following the *Fan* edition.
The *Wang* edition reads *companions* as *bright*—
here, following the *Song*, *Lu*, and *Fan* editions.
*Yú*, pronounced *yú-lǜ* (余律切).
*Wang* says: Purple *zhuó* is ominous *qi*.
*Yú* clouds are the *qi* of a sunbeam piercing the sun.
*Guang* says: The seventh day is ruin and loss,
yet it faces the *night*.
Like petty men forming factions to deceive their ruler,
becoming a calamity for the state—
the ruler cannot sever and remove them.

The eighth day: Sever its *dù*—
obtaining my heart’s sickness.
*Ce* says: Severing its *dù*—
beneficial to the state.
The *Wang* and *Small Song* editions read *dù* as *yú*—
here, following the *Song*, *Lu*, and *Fan* editions.
*Benefit*, pronounced *bù-biān* (步边切).
The eighth day is the midst of calamity,
yet it faces the *day*.
Able to sever and remove deceitful *dù*,
obtaining what my heart detests.

The ninth day: Sever flesh to take bone—
extinguished in blood.
*Ce* says: Severing flesh and extinguishing blood—
it cannot preserve itself.
The extreme of severing—
the people are already exhausted,
the ruler cannot preserve himself—
thus, extinguished in blood.

Three regions, two states, three departments, two houses—
*Yang* family, *Gèn* wood.

The *yin* ceases things above, the *yang* ceases things below—
both above and below cease.

The *Small Song* edition reads: *"Great Yin ceases things above,"*
but here we follow the other editions.
The *Song* commentary says:
*"At this time, things above are obstructed by *yin* qi,
below they return to *yang* qi,
each ceasing in its place and not moving further."*

**First hexagram:** Ceasing at Ceasing—
inner clarity, no blame.
*Ce* says:
*"Ceasing at Ceasing—
wisdom is sufficient and clear."*

The *Small Song* edition reads *"Ceasing at Inner"*—
here we follow the other editions.
One is the beginning of thought, yet aligned with *Cease*’s proper place.
He who ceases where ceasing is appropriate
then his inner clarity remains unblamed.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Gèn ceases—
ceasing in its proper place."*

The *Great Learning* says:
*"Knowing where to cease, only then is there steadfastness.
Steadfast, only then can one be tranquil.
Tranquil, only then can one find ease.
Ease, only then can one deliberate.
Deliberate, only then can one attain."*

Things have roots and branches, affairs have ends and beginnings.
Knowing what comes first and last—
then one draws near to the Dao.

**Second hexagram:** The chariot’s axle halts,
the horse’s head ceases.
*Ce* says:
*"The chariot’s axle halts—
it cannot proceed."*

The *Fan* edition reads *"The chariot’s axle, the horse ceases"*—
here we follow the *Song*, *Lu*, and *Wang* editions.
*Wu* says:
*"Axle (*rèn*)—pronounced *rèn-yín* (而振切)—
the blocking wood of the wheel."*

*Guang* says:
*"Two is the midpoint of thought, yet it faces night.
The petty man’s wisdom is insufficient to discern principle—
to cease is permissible, but to act is perilous."*

**Third hexagram:** Bar its gates and doors,
using ceasing to restrain mad *guǒ*.
*Ce* says:
*"Bar its gates and doors—
repelling what is improper."*

The *Wang* edition reads *"repelling"* (*yù*) as *"enclosing"* (*yù*),
but here we follow the *Fan* edition.
*Guang* says:
*"Guǒ—delusion.
Repelling—also ceasing."*

Three is the gate, again the height of thought,
again the completion of intent, yet it faces day.
The superior man deliberates thrice before acting—
if madness and delusion are improper, they cannot be concealed.
Thus, at the time of completion, one must be cautious before acting.

**Fourth hexagram:** Ceasing at *tóng* wood,
seeking its sparse grains.
*Ce* says:
*"Ceasing at *tóng* wood—
its seeking is exhausted."*

The *Fan* edition reads *"seeking its exhaustion"*—
here we follow the *Song* and *Lu* editions.
*Wang* says:
*"Tóng wood—
that which stands bare, without branches or trunk."*

*Sparse grains—*
the edible grasses and plants.
*Guang* says:
*"Four is the lower *lù* (fortune), yet it faces night.
The petty man seeks fortune but lacks the proper way—
he will surely gain nothing."*

**Fifth hexagram:** The pillar stands firm in *Lú*,
the cover covers the chariot,
the nave aligns with the spokes.
*Ce* says:
*"The pillar and cover, the nave—
nobility in the center."*

The *Fan* edition reads *"nave"* (*gǔ*) as *"valley"* (*gǔ*)—
here we follow the two *Song*, *Lu*, and *Wang* editions.
*Valley* and *nave* are anciently interchangeable characters.
*Wang* says:
*"Deliberate—steady.
As the pillar steadies in the *Lú*’s center,
finding its proper place to cease.
The cover’s cover rests upon the chariot;
the chariot moves, yet the cover does not.
The nave aligns its spacing,
to gather the spokes.
Though the spokes move, it remains ever at the center.
All these use ceasing as their function.
Five occupies the center, attaining its position,
excellently embodying the Dao of ceasing—
thus taking its symbol."*

*Guang* says:
*"Lú—
the round shelter of grass.
First, a pillar is planted at the center to steady it.
The cover has a *dòu* (fighting vessel) to hold the bow.
The wheel has a nave to align the spokes."*

The mind’s resting place,
long holding fast to its center—
thus these three are precious.

Next, the sixth: square wheels, slender axles,
the carriage jolting.
**Zè** says:
*"Square wheels jolting—
their own trembling returns."*

The *Fàn* edition reads *lián* (broad) for *liǎn* (slender); we follow the other editions.
The *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* editions read *kǎnkē* (坎轲) for *kǎnkē* (坎坷); we follow the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.
Both *kē* (坷) and *kē* (轲) are pronounced *kě*.

**Wáng** says:
*"Square wheels must stop;
slender axles must sway.
Using them to travel—
the carriage jolts violently,
yet never finds its way."*

**Guāng** says:
*"Six is upper fortune,
abundance and excess,
yet it belongs to night.
The petty man advances without the Dao—
though he rests in a position of splendor,
he will never find peace."*

Next, the seventh: the carriage laden with its *zhuì*,
the horse stumbling in its stride—
resting in constancy.
**Zè** says:
*"The carriage laden, the horse stumbling—
its movement can be corrected."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *jiǎo* (侥) for *zhuì* (傂); the *Fàn* edition reads *zhuì*; we follow the *Xiǎo Sòng* edition.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *lín* (怜) for *lín* (邻); we follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* editions.
*Zhuì* is pronounced *zhī* in Chén, *chí* in Wú.
*Zhuò* (擸) is pronounced *liángxié* (良涉切); some editions mistakenly write it as *liè* (猎), a scribal error.
**Fàn** says:
*"Zhuì—wheels."*
*"Zhuò—overstep."*

**Wáng** says:
*"Zhuì—what is bound.
Zhuò—what is hung.
The laden carriage, the stumbling horse—
it is fitting to halt and seek rectitude."*

**Guāng** says:
*"Seven is lost aspiration,
decay and ruin,
and it belongs to day—
thus the laden and stumbling.
The virtuous halt at danger,
and thus do not lose their rectitude."*

Next, the eighth: the good bow reverses,
the bad bow reverses.
The good horse rears,
the bad horse rears.
The snapped string breaks the carriage—
it will never rest.
**Zè** says:
*"The bow reverses, the horse rears—
it can never be used."*

The *Wáng* edition reads *"the good bow reverses, the good horse rears, the bad horse rears."*
The *Sòng* edition reads *"the good bow reverses, the bad bow reverses, the good horse rears, the bad horse rears."*
The *Fàn* edition reads *hèn* (恨) for *hěn* (很); we follow the other editions for *hěn*, and the *Fàn* for the rest.
*Pàn* (弸) is pronounced *bóméng* (薄萌切).
**Sòng** says:
*"The snapped string breaks the carriage—
thus it cannot be used."*

**Fàn** says:
*"Pàn—string.
Yǎn—rest."*

**Wáng** says:
*"The bow’s reversal—
it cannot shoot.
The horse’s rearing—
it cannot be guided.
Yet if one forces their use,
there will be snapped strings and broken carriages—
it will never rest in peace."*

**Guāng** says:
*"Though the bow be good yet prone to reverse,
though the horse be good yet prone to rear—
it can never be used.
What then of the bad?
Eight is misfortune’s core,
peeling away,
and it belongs to night.
The petty man, perverse and obstinate,
does not know when to halt."*

From *Xúnzǐ*:
*"The bow must first be tuned before seeking strength;
the horse must first be broken before seeking excellence;
the scholar must first be trustworthy before seeking wisdom."*

Next, the ninth: broken at the stump,
collapsed at the grinding stone—
resting.
**Zè** says:
*"Broken wood, grinding stone—
the virtuous halt here."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *biān* (砭) for *duì* (砋), pronounced *yàn* (验切);
the *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *xiàn* (硟), pronounced *xiān* (仙);
the *Wáng* edition reads *duì* (砋), pronounced *zhǐ* (止), saying *"the stone for pounding silk."*
We follow this.
**Wú** says:
*"Duì—pronounced *kǎi* (恺), obstruction."*

**Guāng** says:
*"Nine is limit,
is stone,
the exhaustion of misfortune,
and it belongs to day.
When the Dao of the virtuous cannot proceed,
then they must halt."*

**Three regions, two states, three departments, two families—firm.**
The *Yīn* family is metal, also corresponding to *Gèn*.
At the beginning of firmness, one *fēn* and twenty *máo*—
the sun’s course splits wood,
the winter solstice’s *qi* responds.
The Dipper stands in the *Hài* position,
the musical pitch *Zhōng* resonates with *Zhōng*.

**Lù** says:
*"Gèn is mountain and stone,
also wood with many knots—
all depict firmness."*

The *Yīn* form is calloused and dense;
the *Yáng* loses its thread—
all things contend in strength.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *xiàng* (貌) for *xíng* (形), *chāng* (昌) for *mào* (冒); we follow the other editions.
*Pián* (胼) is pronounced *bùtián* (部田切).
*Sàng* (丧) is pronounced *xìlàng* (息浪切).
**Sòng** says:
*"Pián—abundance.
Xù—endeavor."
Meaning: at this time, the *Yīn* *qi* is robust and abundant,
while the *Yáng* loses its endeavor,
and cannot act.
Thus all things, relying on the *Yīn* *qi*, contend—
meaning strength.*

**Fàn** says:
*"Pián—fixed."*

**Wáng** says:
*"Pián-mào—dense and abundant.*
At the first day,
the swirling stone is fixed within—
unchangeable constancy.
**Zè** says:
*"The swirling stone is fixed within—
it cannot be transformed."*

The *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *jiān pán* (坚盘) for *pánshí* (盘石);
the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *bùzhēn* (不贞) for *bùhuàzhēn* (不化贞);
the *Wáng* and *Xiǎo Sòng* editions read *bùhuà qí zhēn* (不化其贞);
the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *"swirling within the fixed—
it cannot be transformed."*
We follow the *Fàn* edition.

**Guāng** says:
*"One is the lowly man,
the beginning of thought,
and it belongs to night.
The petty man is stubborn and foolish,
his heart like the swirling stone’s firmness—
unchangeable, unable to enter rectitude."*

Confucius said:
*"Only the utterly foolish are unmoved."*

Next, the second: firm and white as jade,
its inner nature transforms—
constancy.
**Zè** says:
*"Firm and white as jade—
it can be transformed."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions omit the *huà* (化) character;
the *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *zhuàng* (状) for *xíng* (形);
we follow the *Fàn* and *Wáng* editions.
Two is the middle of thought,
and it belongs to day.
Though the virtuous heart be firm and pure as jade,
when they see goodness, they change;
when they have faults, they amend—
their inner transformation renews daily,
seeking rectitude.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Resting on stone—
not even a day—
constancy brings good fortune."*

Next, the third: firm yet not overbearing,
or its center may drain.
**Zè** says:
*"Firm yet not overbearing—
it cannot maintain harmony."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *líng* (陵) for *líng* (凌); we follow the *Fàn*, *Wáng*, and *Xiǎo Sòng* editions.
**Sòng** says:
*"Harmony—centrality."*

**Fàn** says:
*"In the month of firm ice,
today it does not overbear—
perhaps the *Yáng* *qi* drains within."*

**Guāng** says:
*"Three is completed intention,
and it belongs to night.
The petty man’s heart is not firm;
good and evil war within him,
his virtue wavers—
he has a beginning but no completion,
unable to practice steadfast thought,
faithfully holding to the center."*

Like ice that seeks to harden on the outside
while its *yáng* *qi* leaks within—
it can never truly take form.

Next, the fourth: the small wasp buzzes busily,
its *shān* and *yǐng* unsealed.
**Zè** says:
*"The small wasp buzzes busily—
this is its lineage."*

The *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *yíng* (荧) for *yíng* (营), omitting *zài* (在).
The *Wáng* edition reads *fèn* (分) for *jiè* (介).
**Wú** says:
*"Wasp—same as *fēng* (蜂)."*
**Fàn** mistakenly writes *pén* (盆).
*Shān* (螮) is pronounced *dūjì*.
*Yǐng* (蛡) is pronounced *shù* or *yì*.
We follow the majority for *fēng*, and *yíng* and *jiè* from the *Fàn* edition.
**Sòng** says:
*"Lineage—root."*
**Fàn** says:
*"Shān—virtue.
Yǐng—state."*
**Wáng** says:
*"Shān—the wasp’s brood.
Yǐng—its nest."*
**Guāng** says:
*"Shān—same as *dì* (蒂), meaning the wasp’s nest’s base.
Jiè—great.
Shān is used to speak of virtue,
yǐng to speak of state.
The fourth is lower fortune,
and it belongs to day.
The superior man cultivates virtue to preserve his station.
A state does not depend on size,
but on diligent virtue to fortify its root.
It is like the small wasp buzzing to build its nest—
it must first make its base.
The nest does not depend on size,
but if the base is firm, it will not fall."*

Next, the fifth: the *yǐng* is large, the *shān* small—emptiness.
**Zè** says:
*"The *yǐng* large, the *shān* small—
the state is hollow."*

**Fàn** says:
*"When a state is small but virtue great,
the people are numerous and prosperous;
when a state is great but virtue small,
the people are hollowed out."*
**Guāng** says:
*"None surpass the fifth in central harmony,
yet it falls to night.
The petty man enjoys great fortune but cannot hold it.
Though a state be vast, if virtue is thin,
like a wasp’s nest large but its base small—
its fall will not be long.
Emptiness—this speaks of outward strength,
while inwardly there is nothing."*

Next, the sixth: the *qiān shān* weaves delicately,
suspended over the Nine Regions.
**Zè** says:
*"The *qiān shān* suspended—
the people thrive thereby."*
The *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *shā* (纱) as *yōu* (幽), meaning "subtle appearance," but we follow the majority.
*Tiě* (铁) is the same as *xiān* (纤).
*Xuán* (悬) is the same as *xián* (县).
**Wáng** says:
*"Shā—same as *miǎo* (眇)."*
**Guāng** says:
*"The sixth is high fortune,
abundance, extreme greatness,
and it belongs to day.
The Son of Heaven holds firm virtue—
one man’s blessing,
ten thousand people rely upon it,
like the delicate base suspending a great nest."*

Next, the seventh: firmness topples, striking the mound.
**Zè** says:
*"Firmness topples, striking the mound—
it does not know its path."*
*Diān* (颠) means "top."
The seventh is lost resolve,
ruin, descending the mountain,
and it belongs to night.
The petty man is strong yet ignorant,
like using his firm top to advance,
colliding with the mound—
he does not know where to go.*

Next, the eighth:
Firmness brings calamity—
only the *jiě* *huò* can rectify it.
**Zè** says:
*"Firmness brings calamity—
this is the use of straightness and rectitude."*
*Huò* (祸) is the same as *hù* (怙).
*Jiě* (解) is the same as *xièzhì* (獬豸).

The King says:
*"**Jiě** (解) is the beast that strikes the perverse."*

**Zè** (测) explains:
*"Eight is calamity at its peak, striking during the day—
it relies upon its firmness yet provokes disaster."*

Yet the **Way** of the virtuous lies in striking the perverse;
though firm and stepping into calamity,
they do not lose their rectitude.

Next, the ninth:
Firmness brings calamity—
only the **jiě** **huò** (解祸) can rectify it.
**Zè** says:
*"Firmness brings calamity—
this is the use of straightness and rectitude."*
**Huò** (祸) is the same as **hù** (怙).
**Jiě** (解) is the same as **xièzhì** (獬豸).

---

The King says:
*"**Jiě** (解) is the beast that strikes the perverse."*

**Guāng** (光) states:
*"Eight is at the height of calamity, striking during the day—
it is one who leans upon firmness yet incurs disaster."*

Yet the **Way** of the virtuous lies in striking the perverse;
though firm and stepping into calamity,
they do not lose their rectitude.

Next, the upper ninth:
Bees burn their wings,
perishing upon the corpse.
**Zè** says:
*"Bees burn their wings—
their reliance is lost."*
*(The text of Sòng (宋) and Lù (陆) reads: "Bees consume their wings," but we follow Fàn (范), Wáng (王), and Xiǎo Sòng (小宋) here.)*
**Shāng** (丧) is pronounced *xī wàng* (息浪).
Fàn (范) says:
*"**Shī** (尸), the master."*
**Guāng** states:
*"Wings (**yì** 翊), should be read as **yǐ** (翼)."*
Nine is calamity’s utmost,
striking during the night.
The petty man’s firmness in vice
reaches the point of ruining his house—
like bees burning their own nest,
losing their master.

The *Yì* (易) says:
*"A bird burns its nest—
three directions, three states, one family becomes yang."*
*(The yang family perishes, the water is exhausted—
this follows the pattern of *Jì* (既济).)*
Upon entering the ninth, the day is called *"Shě Jī"* (舍箕).
The **yin-qi** is now pure,
the **yang-qi** concealed within the **Líng** (灵).
Things achieve completion in form.
*(Fàn’s text reads: "The yin-qi is now exhausted," while Xiǎo Sòng reads: "The great yin is now pure"—
we follow the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng texts here.)*
Sòng says:
*"The earth is called **Líng** (灵)."*
Lù says:
*"Pure (**qīng** 清), means cold."*
**Guāng** states:
*"The yang-qi hides within the earth,
**Gǎng** (港) is the master of things.
Things depend upon it to achieve completion,
thus attaining their form."*

First, the one:
If completion is like ruin,
its use will not cease—
**míng** (冥).
**Zè** says:
*"If completion is like ruin,
this is why it does not fail."*

Wáng’s text reads only one *"gǎi"* (改),
but we follow the other versions.
Wáng says:
*"At the start of completion,
though in proper position during the day,
if the work is like ruin,
and one does not boast of its success,
then its use will not cease—
and **míng** (冥) will align with the **Dao**."*

**Guāng** states:
*"One is thinking downward,
striking during the day.
The **Way** of the virtuous,
though silent, shines forth daily.
**Míng** (冥) is hidden yet not displayed.
The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) says:
*'When success is achieved, do not dwell upon it.*
*He who does not dwell upon it,
will not be abandoned by it.'*"*

Next, the two:
Completion is slight, yet change is repeated—
not yet complete yet already in peril.
**Zè** says:
*"Completion is slight yet change is repeated—
it cannot fulfill itself."*

Wáng’s text has only one *"gǎi"* (改),
but we follow the other versions.
Wáng says:
*"Having lost its position at night,
though completion is still slight,
if it is changed again,
then the matter will surely not complete,
and danger will ensue."*

**Guāng** states:
*"Two is reversal,
striking during the night.
The petty man’s heart is not steadfast,
and thus he will never succeed.
The *Yì* (易) says:
*'Jìn advances like the weasel or rat—
rectitude is perilous.'*"*

Next, the three:
Completion leaps yet contracts,
completion flies yet does not pursue.
**Zè** says:
*"Completion leaps yet contracts—
the virtue of completion is strong."*

Wáng says:
*"When the matter is already complete,
it leaps forward yet again,
then contracts and retreats—
knowing self-restraint and caution,
it advances without fault."*

**Guāng** states:
*"Three is completion in intent,
striking during the day.
The virtuous, when facing affairs, are cautious—
leaping and contracting, undecided.
This is so because,
when the matter is complete,
it is like a bird taking flight—
no longer able to be driven back,
thus advance and retreat must be measured with care.
The *Yì* (易) says:
*'Or leaps into the abyss—
no fault.'*"*

Next, the four:
On the verge of completion, arrogance leads to ruin.
**Zè** says:
*"The arrogance of one on the verge of completion—
this is a flaw in the **Way** of completion."*

Wáng says:
*"Having lost its position at night,
this is one on the verge of completion,
yet arrogant—
it will surely ruin its success.
The **Way** of success
hates arrogance and self-aggrandizement."*

**Guāng** states:
*"Four is the decline of fortune,
thus it is on the verge of completion.
Striking during the night,
hence it is arrogant.
At the **Kuìqiū** (葵丘) gathering,
Qi Huánggōng (齐桓公) was arrogant and boastful,
and nine states rebelled against him."*

Next, the five:
Completion stands alone in the center—
greatness.
**Zè** says:
*"Completion stands alone in the center—
it can dwell in the middle."*

*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: "Completion is able to stand in the center," but we follow the other versions.)*
Five is the utmost of **harmony** and **center**,
striking during the day—
the **Son of Heaven**’s work is complete,
alone wielding the **Huángjí** (皇极),
to govern the four quarters,
a radiant virtue and achievement.*

Next, the six:
Completion is **arcane** and **fragmented**,
using completion to gain calamity.
**Zè** says:
*"The arcane fragmentation of completion—
it does not act with humility."*

*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: "Completion is arcane and fragmented, fragmented," but we follow the other versions.)*
*(Fàn’s text reads: "humility (**qiān** 谦)" as "yielding (**ràng** 让)," but we follow Sòng, Lù, and Wáng here.)*
Wáng says:
*"Six dwells in fullness yet loses its position at night,
though it is the chief of completion,
it harbors fragmented and petty actions within—
it will surely fall from its success and incur calamity."*

**Guāng** states:
*"Six is the utmost of completion,
striking during the night.
When great success is achieved,
many desire to share in its glory.
The one who leads it,
having already exhausted their greatness,
must distribute even the minutiae to others,
and thus all will rejoice.
If they wish to retain both greatness and small,
they will be hated by the multitude,
and instead, through their success,
they will gain calamity."*

Next, the seven:
Completion is **obstructed**—
**repair** (补).
**Zè** says:
*"The repair of completion’s obstruction—
it is indeed difficult to uphold."*

*(Sòng and Lù’s text reads: "depend on (**yī** 依)," but we follow Fàn and Wáng here.)*
Fàn says:
*"Seven is lost resolve,
hence it is obstructed.
The **Way** of the virtuous
is good at repairing faults,
thus when there is obstruction,
they repair it."*

Wáng says:
*"Beneath completion,
it is difficult to uphold—
one must consider the **Way** of repairing errors."*

Next, the eight:
The time for completion is ripe yet not achieved—
**Heaven** descends **perilous rectitude**.
**Zè** says:
*"The time for completion is ripe yet not achieved—
it alone loses the center."*

Wáng’s text reads *"zhǐ"* (止) instead of *"wáng"* (亡),
but we follow the other versions.
Fàn says:
*"Eight is wood,
the harvest of autumn."*

**Guāng** states:
*"The petty man,
when the time for completion is ripe yet not achieved,
lacks the **virtue** to complete it,
losing the center of time,
thus **Heaven** descends blame
and he loses rectitude."*

Upper ninth:
Completion reaches **exhaustion** and enters ruin—
**destroying** completion,
the virtuous do not complete.
**Zè** says:
*"Completion reaches exhaustion and is destroyed—
the virtuous bring it to an end."*

*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: "The petty man destroys completion," but we follow the other versions.)*
Nine is the **end of exhaustion**,
striking during the day.
The sun at its zenith then declines;
the moon at its fullness then wanes—
completion reaches exhaustion and enters ruin,
the natural order of things.
Ruination then destroys its completion.
The virtuous, knowing that completion must be ruined,
constantly restrain and diminish themselves,
so as not to reach completion,
thus ensuring their lasting fortune and blessings.*

「Yǒng Yóu Jī#12 departs a hundred paces from willow leaves and shoots them,
a hundred strikes and a hundred hits—
one man stands beside him, saying: *"Well done!
You do not rest on this virtue#13—
soon your qi#14 will falter and your strength will weary,
your bow will snap and your arrows will bend,
not a single strike will hit,
and your hundred shots will all come to naught."*
This is the type of case described.

**Three regions, three states, one section, two families#15—
The Yin family#16 and the Fire family#17,
corresponding to the hexagram **Shì Hè#18**.
Fàn and Wáng read it as *zhìmì*—
dense and secret.
Chén reads it as *guī*—
closed doors, with the pronunciation *zhìlì*.
Wú says: *wù*—
also like *zhì*, same as *zhì*.
Lù says: *hè* means "to join,"
and *shì* also refers to **Yin and Yang harmonizing#19**.
When **Yin and Yang clash#20**,
joining into one, their calamity floods all things.
Sòng says: *"At this time, the Yin clings and ascends in a closed manner above,
while the Yang clings and declines in a guarded manner below,
the lower and upper both close and guard—
their joining is dense as one."*

Guāng says: *"Clash (dì), like exceeding beyond measure."*

First line: **A circle piercing a square, a round peg in a square hole#21—
within, there is **disunity and discord#22**.
Shì says: *"A circle piercing a square, a round peg in a square hole—
within, they lose their harmony."*
The pronunciation: *yǔ* (for 杌), *niè* (for 棿), *kuǎn* (for 窾).
Fàn says: *"Water in the Fire family,
mutually restraining each other.
Like a round peg in a square hole,
the circle and square do not fit."*

Guāng says: *"Shì (合) means 'to join.'
One is the beginning of thought,
and it occurs at night—
its heart does not harmonize."*

Second line: **Unbroken continuity#23**.
Shì says: *"The unbroken continuity of **Shì (合)**—
one becomes two."*
Fàn says: *"Two Fire families join,
their continuity is dense as one."*
Guāng says: *"Two is the middle of thought,
and it occurs during the day.
Their joining is without interruption—
two as one."*
The *Yì* says: *"Two persons with the same mind,
their strength can cleave metal."*

Third line: **A dragon assaults a place not its own,
its light vanishes in the chamber#24**.
Shì says: *"A dragon assaults a place not its own—
it loses its natural course."*
Wáng and Xiǎo Sòng’s versions lack the *dragon* character,
we follow Sòng, Lù, and Fàn’s versions.
Wáng says: *"Assault (xí) means 'to enter.'"*

Fourth line: **The stench of fat extinguishes the nose,
beneficial for virtuous beauty and integrity#25**.
Shì says: *"The integrity where the nose is extinguished—
there is no place for fragrance."*
Sòng and Lù’s versions read: *"no place for the square,"*
Fàn and Xiǎo Sòng’s versions read: *"no place for labor."*
We follow Wáng’s version.

Corresponding to **Shì Hè#18**,
there is the image of **eclipses#26**.
Four is the beginning of **fortune#27**,
and it occurs during the day.
When food and drink arrive,
one first perceives **stench and fragrance#28**.
Seeing what is obtained, one must ponder its meaning—
one must not lose what is upright.

Fifth line: **Gnawing bone breaks teeth,
a full jar#29**.
Shì says: *"Gnawing bone breaks teeth—
this is great greed for profit."*
Five is the **midpoint of fortune#30**,
and it occurs at night—
the petty man greedily pursues profit and harms himself.
The *Yì* says: *"To gnaw the meat of a sacrifice,
one encounters poison."*

Sixth line: **Drinking sweat, gulping with a sound of *hōng-hōng*#31,
obtaining its **smooth and nourishing essence#32**.
Shì says: *"Drinking sweat with a sound of *hōng-hōng*—
the Dao/Way#33 is fully indulged."*
Wáng’s version reads *hōng-hōng* as *shǔn-shǔn*.
Xiǎo Sòng’s version reads *sweat* as *wū*#34,
with the pronunciation *wū* (污).
*Gulping* (吭) is read as *yǐn*#35,
with the pronunciation *shānyuè* (山劣反),
meaning *yǐn-yǐn*—
small drinking.
*Fully indulged* is read as *dàodé shì*#36.
We follow Sòng, Lù, and Fàn’s versions.
Fàn says: *"Sweat is moisturizing.
Much moisturizing makes the gulping sound *hōng-hōng*."*
Guāng says: *"Six is the peak of abundance,
the utmost extreme.
What the virtuous indulge is the Dao/Way#33—
though they take much, it does no harm."*

Seventh line: **Its differences—
front joins, back separates#37**.
Shì says: *"Its differences—
its joining and separating."*
Seven is **dissipation#38**,
**ruin and loss#39**,
and it occurs at night—
thus **Shì (合)** is dense from here onward,
before joining and after separating.

Eighth line: **Supporting its fracture,
covering its defect,
the person shines and is **resolute and courageous#40**.
Shì says: *"Supporting the fracture and covering the defect—
it can still be beneficial."*
Sòng and Lù’s versions read *覆* (廅) as *lú*,
we follow Fàn and Wáng’s versions.
Chén’s pronunciation: *廅* as *wūhé* (乌合切).
Xiǎo Sòng: *resolute and courageous* (偈) is pronounced *jié*.
Fàn says: *"To shelter and protect its flaws,
to cover its defects."*
Wáng says: *"To support and assist its fractures,
to cover and conceal its defects."*
Xiǎo Sòng says: *"Resolute and courageous (偈) refers to **bravery and valor#41**."*
Guāng says: *"Eight is **exhaustion#42**,
**peeling away and decline#43**,
and it occurs during the day—
thus there is this image."*

Upper ninth: **Yin and Yang begin to open,
their changes turn **dark to light and light to dark#44**.
Shì says: *"Yin turns dark and Yang turns light—
the extreme then reverses."*
Fàn’s version reads: *"Yin and Yang begin to open,
the extreme then reverses."*
Wáng’s version reads: *"Yin and Yang dark to light,
the extreme is reversal."*
Xiǎo Sòng’s version reads *open* (启) as *qǐ*,
with the pronunciation *qǐ*.
*Dark* (赤) is read as *yān*#45,
with the pronunciation *wūxián* (乌闲反).
Shì says: *"Yin dark and Yang light—
the extreme is reversal."*
We follow Sòng and Lù’s versions.
The pronunciation: *shì* as *wǔhé* (五禾切).»

Wáng says: **"** *Yǐ* **is an ancient character for *huà* (化).**
Wú says: *"** *Wū* **is *huà* (化)."**
Guāng says: **"** *Yǐ* **is the symbol of Yin and Yang being blocked and uncommunicative.**
When things reach their extreme, they reverse—thus they change again and open, generating all things, sprouting red and white.

**Three regions, three states, one department, and one family have lost their Yang.**
The Wood family of the Yang line is measured against *Dàguò* (大过).
**Entering, losing sequence four, twenty-six minutes eleven seconds;**
the *xiǎo xuě* (小雪) qi responds.
**Yin grows great as a thief, and Yang cannot prevail—**
things sink into the unfathomable.
Sòng says: *"This means that at this time, Yang is robbed and attacked by Yin and cannot reclaim anything."*

**First line: Piercing the void, the blade is extinguished.**
Shì says: *"Piercing the void, the blade is extinguished—*
this is deep contemplation from the subtle.
**The subtle is the incipient movement, the precursor of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.**
**One is the subtle essence of thought—**
before the birth of the spirit, it is the first principle, and it occurs during the day.
Though a gentleman may sometimes err,
if he deeply contemplates and plans ahead,
correcting from the subtle signs before they manifest,
it will leave no trace—
like piercing the void with a blade,
though the blade is extinguished, there is no injury."*

**Second line: Contemptuous of virtue, the subtle is lost.**
Shì says: *"The loss of contemptuous virtue—*
this is failing to revere the subtle."
The Sòng, Lù, and Fàn versions read *zhēng* (征) for *wēi* (微); we follow Wáng’s version.
**Contemptuous (*miǎo*)—**
like distant and small.
**Two is the midpoint of thought, hence ‘contemptuous of virtue.’**
The mechanisms of gain and loss are both subtle and refined,
yet at night, the petty man cannot be cautious of the subtle,
leading to great loss."

**Third line: Concluding and conforming, anxious and reverent,**
**in his heart, he takes it as his ancestor.**
Shì says: *"Concluding and conforming—*
this is the ability to self-correct."
Wáng says: *"Concluding (*zú*) is finality;*
conforming (*cóng*) is submission.
Anxious (*xù*) is worry;
reverent (*sǒng*) is respect."
At the time of loss, occupying the correct position during the day,
one who concludes by submitting to the Great Way,
worries over past mistakes,
and adds reverence—
this is taking it as the guiding principle of the heart.
Guāng says: *"Three is the completion of intent during the day,
thus there is this image.
One corrects before it manifests;
three corrects after it is complete."*

**Fourth line: Trusting in excess, not eating,**
**until he hides in the shadows.**
Shì says: *"Trusting in excess, not eating—*
this is losing the rectification of fortune."
Fàn’s version reads *"rectifying fortune"* (*zhèng lù* 正禄); we follow Sòng, Lù, and Wáng’s versions.
Wáng says: *"At the time of loss, occupying the wrong position at night,
unable to rectify his mistake,
he trusts in his erroneous conduct and does not eat.
‘Until he hides in the shadows’ means all day long.
To go all day without eating is to risk losing one’s life.
‘Eating’ also metaphorically means fortune, hence Shì’s reciprocal phrasing."
Sòng says: *"The sun’s decline is ‘hiding in the shadows,’*
the sun’s setting is ‘concealed.’"
Guāng says: *"Four is the lower fortune, yet it occurs at night,
thus there is this image."*

**Fifth line: The yellow-haired child is central,**
**and he prospers.**
The gentleman uses this to **purify his faults.**
Shì says: *"The yellow-haired child is central—*
this is rectifying excess through purification."
**Child (*ér*)**—pronounced *wǔ qǐ* (五稽切).
Fàn says: *"Yellow-haired refers to old age with yellow hair,*
a sign of the child-teeth."
Sòng says: *"Hair turning white and then black is called yellow,*
teeth falling out and regrowing are called child-teeth."
**Prosper (*fān*)**—like a fence.
One who maintains centrality and rectitude
can erect a protective boundary.

**Sixth line: His granaries are full, his fields overgrown.**
**He consumes the fruit, but does not nourish the roots.**
Shì says: *"Granaries full, fields overgrown—*
this is failing to cultivate the foundation."
Fàn says: *"Not cultivating virtue while occupying high fortune,*
granaries full and fields overgrown,
the people exhausted, consuming only the fruit,
suffering at the roots—
the foundation is not secure, and the loss is severe."
Guāng says: *"Six is the upper fortune, abundance, and extremity,
yet it occurs at night, thus there is this image.
When the people are well-fed, the ruler is well-fed—
this is like nourishing the roots while consuming the fruit."*

**Seventh line: If sick, take medicine; if bewitched, consult the shaman.**
Shì says: *"Sickness treated with medicine, bewitchment with divination—*
disaster can be averted."
Fàn says: *"The shaman appeases the offense;*
when the offense is removed, the illness is cured,
and divination is used to bestow blessings."
Guāng says: *"Seven is the descent of disaster,*
separating from calamity but encountering misfortune,
and it occurs during the day, thus there is this image."*

**Eighth line: The hen crows at dawn,**
**the female has horns, the fish grows wood.**
Shì says: *"The hen crows at dawn—*
this is the reversal of correctness."
Fàn says: *"The hen should not crow at dawn.*
The female should be docile, not have horns;
the fish should dwell in water, not grow wood—
the loss is severe."
**Upper ninth: The passing of the sun and moon,**
**rectification at the corpse.**
Shì says: *"Rectification at the corpse—*
this is not far off."
Fàn says: *"The Way of the gentleman, executed in the world,
though he dies, still endures.
Though aged, the sun and moon have passed;
his gains and losses, though in the coffin,
are still remembered for self-rectification."
Wáng says: *"The admonitions of the ancients are profound—*
even if rectification comes after death,
it is still not far off."
Guāng says: *"The mistakes of life, corrected in death by warning descendants,
are still not far off."
When the King of Chu was dying,
he instructed the Prime Minister to present the *sù* (筫) cup and expel the Marquis of Shen.
Liú Xiàng says: *"Thus he awakens his descendants and future generations,
which is better than dying without enlightenment."
**Sù**—not found in the character dictionary.
**Marquis of Shen**—a mistake in the *Xīn Xù* (新序); he was a minister of King Wén of Chu.

**Three regions, three states, two departments, and one family are severely affected.**
The **Yin family’s Metal** is also measured against *Dàguò* (大过).

「Entering the **extreme** phase, fourfold#13, the day rests upon the Southern Dipper.
The King says: *"Extreme" (劇) is the utmost of excess and deviation.*
Guāng says: *"Dàguò (大过), the age of sagging beams and pillars;
**Extreme** (劇), also the omen of disunion and chaos.
When Yin reaches its utmost, it weeps upon the Yang—
without **introduction** (介), the omen of disunion’s extremity.
The *Wáng* and *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscripts read *"位"* (position) for *"泣"* (weep).
The *Fàn* manuscript omits the *"於"* (at).
The *Wáng* manuscript reads *"分"* (divide) for *"介"* (introduction).
The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"俦"* (companion) for *"信"* (trust); the *Xiǎo Sòng* reads *"仍"* (follow), pronounced *"惹"* (provocation). We follow the *Sòng* and *Lù* manuscripts.
*"俦"* (companion), pronounced *"俦"* (companion).
*Sòng* says: *"Weep upon the Yang"*—to make the Yang weep.
Meaning: at this time, the Yin-qi is at its utmost, overwhelming and weakening the Yang, causing it to weep, and no longer possessing even the slightest **introductory virtue** (介) for all things.
Guāng says: *"俦"* (companion) is the ancient form of *"类"* (kind).
All things that receive Yang and live are the Yang’s **kindred** (类).
Once Yin exhausts its utmost influence, all the Yang’s kindred suffer the extreme calamity of disunion.

**First phase:** Bones oppress the flesh—**obscure**.
*Cè* says: *"Bones oppress the flesh"*—the **inner conduct** of the virtuous is harmed.
The *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* manuscripts read *"骨景其肉"* (bones illuminate the flesh), **obscure within**.
We follow the *Wáng* and *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscripts.
Bones and flesh are **affectionate** substances.
One is the **beginning of thought**, and it occurs at night.
The root of calamity and disorder arises from within,
like bones binding and oppressing the flesh—**hidden and unseen by people**.

**Second phase:** Blood flows in **eclipse**—**disasterous omens**.
*Cè* says: *"Blood flows in eclipse"*—the **virtuous one is internally wounded**.
The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"君子伤之"* (the virtuous one is wounded by it); we follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, *Wáng* manuscripts.

**Third phase:** Wine arises, **virtue is lost**, ghosts **glance** at their dwellings.
*Cè* says: *"Wine arises, virtue is lost"*—**unable to govern**.
The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"持"* (hold) for *"将"* (govern); we follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, *Wáng* manuscripts.
*"睒"* (glance), pronounced *"失冉"* (shī rǎn).
The King says: *"睒"* (glance) means **to gaze**.
**Fourth phase:** Feasting at the **extreme**, parents arrive with **leftovers**, **harmonious**.
*Cè* says: *"Feasting at the extreme with harmony"*—**submission to blessings**.
The *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscripts originally read *"采"* (harvest); we follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, *Wáng* manuscripts.
*"馂"* (leftovers), pronounced *"俊"* (jùn).
*"若"* (harmonious), pronounced *"于为"* (yú wéi).
*Fàn* says: *"馂"* (leftovers) are **cooked food**.
*"若"* (harmonious) means **submission**.
Guāng says: The **fourth phase** is **lower blessings** and occurs by day.
The virtuous one serves in a chaotic age, seeking blessings to feed their parents,
without failing in submission.

**Fifth phase:** Venturing into the wild, seeing **desolation**, with tigers herding pigs, **seizing** breeches and **short robes**.
*Cè* says: *"Venturing into the wild, seeing desolation"*—**nowhere to place one’s feet**#14.
The *Wáng* manuscript reads *"唐"* (Tang) for *"虎"* (tiger); we follow the other manuscripts.
*"虚"* (desolation) is the same as *"墟"* (ruins).
*"攓"* (seize), pronounced *"愆"* (qiān).
*"绔"* (breeches) is the same as *"袴"* (trousers).
*"襦"* (short robe), pronounced *"儒"* (rú).
The King says: *"Venturing into the fields and seeing barren hills."*
Guāng says: The **fifth phase** is **middle blessings**, occurring at night.
The petty man rides the chaos of the age, residing in a position of splendor,
engaging in greed and violence to plunder the people—
like tigers herding pigs, leaving the people **nowhere to place their hands or feet**.

**Sixth phase:** The four states are filled—**settling**.
*Cè* says: *"The four states are filled"*—**seeking a secure dwelling**.

**Seventh phase:** **Anxious and abundant**, donning the **face of calamity** while **grieving**.
*Cè* says: *"Anxious and abundant"*—**bearing the comparison of calamity**.
The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"半"* (half) for *"丰"* (abundant); the *Wáng* reads *"牛"* (ox), the *Xiǎo Sòng* reads *"羊"* (sheep); we follow the *Sòng* and *Lù* manuscripts.
*"麃"* (anxious), pronounced *"普表"* (pǔ biǎo).
*"丰"* (abundant), pronounced *"敷容"* (fū róng).
*"较"* (comparison), pronounced *"角"* (jué).

**Eighth phase:** **Jars** piled upon **baskets**, **omens of withering**#15.
*Cè* says: *"Piled upon jars"*—**their duties are urgent**.
The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"瓶累于繘"* (jars piled upon baskets), **their duties are urgent**.
We follow the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Wáng* manuscripts.
*"繘"* (baskets), pronounced *"余律"* (yú lǜ).»

**Ninth (uppermost) line:** The sea’s waters swarm aloft, exhausted at Heaven’s pivot.
*Cè* says: *"The sea’s waters swarm aloft"*—**utterly beyond speech**.

The *Fàn* manuscript reads *"蔽"* (obscured) for *"弊"* (exhausted); the *Wáng* and *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscripts read *"落"* (fall) for *"语"* (speech). We follow the *Èr Sòng* and *Lù* manuscripts.
The *Wáng* manuscript reads *"天"* (Heaven) as *""* (omitted); we follow the other manuscripts.

**Three regions, three states, two departments, two households**—**tamed by the Yang family**, aligned with *Kūn*.
*Sòng* says: *"Kūn"*—**compliance**.
*"驯"*—also **compliance**.
When *Yīn* qi is supremely compliant, the chaos is undifferentiated, its source unseen.

*Sòng* says: *"This speaks of Yīn’s fulfillment, when compliance is complete, and the time returns to Yang. Its work is undifferentiated, without beginning or end, its roots unseen."*

**First day:** Yellow Spirit’s hidden virtue—**compliant**.
*Cè* says: *"Yellow Spirit’s hidden virtue"*—**compliance with rectitude**.
The *Tǔ* family’s essence is **yellow**#17, the birth of the divine is **Spirit**, the lowest of the low is **hidden**, the day’s proper time is **rectitude**.
At the **beginning of contemplation**#18, **these four virtues**#19 are present—**compliant yet rectifying**.

**Second day:** Its **fat**—**the toil of women**; without stillness, **life perishes**.
*Cè* says: *"The loss of fat"*—**incapable of purity**#20.
The *Sòng* and *Lù* manuscripts read *"绳"* (cord); the *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscript reads *""* (omitted).

**Third day:** The **female’s rectitude** is ever **benevolent**, guarding its root.
*Cè* says: *"The female’s rectitude is ever benevolent"*—**never forgetting its source**.
The *Yì* says: *"Constant in virtue, rectitude—**the woman prospers**."*
Kūn is **Mother**; the three natures delight in **emotion and kindness**, and it governs **many children** while presiding over **drawing**#23, hence *"the female’s rectitude is ever benevolent."*
It is said that **constant benevolence** is the **proper path** for women.
Three is **Wood**, **thought ascending**, **fulfilling intent**, **self-so**; it is **able to never forget its root**.

**Fourth day:** **Yielding to toil**, it does not match the **five’s splendor**.
*Cè* says: *"Yielding to toil"*—**cutting down virtue**.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscript reads *"not as the five-five’s splendor"*, now following the other texts.
Wang says: *"Splendor"*—**virtue encompassing a thousand**.
Guāng says: Four is **low fortune**, yet it presides over **night**.
The **petty man** serving his lord **cuts down his merits**, not matching the **five’s luminous embrace**, daring not to **boast of himself**.

**Fifth day:** The **luminous pouch, vast embrace**, its virtue **precious and central**.
*Cè* says: *"The luminous pouch, vast embrace"*—**daring not to boast**.
The Wang manuscript reads *"虚"* (emptiness) for *"灵"* (luminous); now following the other texts.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscript reads *"灵括巨橐"* (luminous binding, vast pouch); now following the other texts.
Wang says: *"Precious"*—**what is valued by things**. *"Central"*—**obtaining the meaning of balance**.
Guāng says: Five is **pouch**, **embrace**; Earth, as a thing, **contains and expands with radiance**, hence *"luminous pouch, vast embrace."*
Five occupies the **position of fullness**, yet presides over **drawing**.
The **noble** as a subject, though **high in rank and great in merit**, does not **boast**; thus it has this symbol.
The *Yì* says: *"Yellow robes—**great good fortune**."*

**Sixth day:** The **pouch loses its binding**, spilling **precious vessels**.
*Cè* says: *"The pouch loses its binding"*—**the subject’s mouth overflows**.
The *Xiǎo Sòng* manuscript also reads *"橐"* (pouch); now following the other texts.
Six is **cave**, **passage**; **exceeding the center** while presiding over **night**.
The **petty man** cannot **contain virtue** to follow the king’s affairs, like a pouch **losing its ties** and spilling **precious vessels**.
The *Yì* says: *"If the subject is not discreet, he loses himself."*

**Seventh day:** **Square and firm**, transgressing **rectitude**, advantageous for the subject’s **rectitude**.
*Cè* says: *"Square and firm, transgressing rectitude"*—**guarding proper conduct**.
Seven is **Lǐ**, **guilt**, **transgressing**, yet presiding over **drawing**.
The **noble** serves above, **offering what is right and removing what is wrong**, acting with **square firmness**; though there may be **transgression**, nothing is **hidden that loses its rectitude**—this is the **proper path** for a subject; hence it is **advantageous**.

**Eighth day:** **Compliant yet not rectified**, it does not **preserve its life**.
*Cè* says: *"Compliant yet not rectified"*—**lacking unity**.
Eight is **disease and stagnation**, **decay and peeling**; yet it presides over **night**.
The **petty man** serving above **hesitates before and behind**, **right and wrong**, **yes and no**, **only complying with the lord**, unable to **guard the Way and maintain unity**, hence it does not **preserve its life**.

**Ninth day:** **Compliant in righteousness**, forgetting life, **relying on Heaven’s rectitude**.
*Cè* says: *"Compliant in righteousness, forgetting life"*—**receiving the mandate is certain**.
Nine is the **exhaustion of calamity**, yet presides over **drawing**.
The **noble** serves his lord with **loyalty unto death**, **no second thoughts**; **compliant in righteousness**, forgetting life—what he relies on is **Heaven’s rectitude alone**.

---
**Three regions, three states, two departments, three generals**
The **Yin family’s water**, aligning with *Wèi Jì*.
The **general enters**, descending to **eighth**, the day to **Shén Jì**, the **Great Snow** in resonance with *qi*.

The **Fight Star** stands in **Zǐ**, the **Lü** in **Yellow Bell**.
Lù says: *"General"*—**Yin and Yang reach their peak, then reverse**; just as *Fù*, *Shēng*, and *Jì Zhì* follow.
It is said: *"Things cannot be exhausted,"* hence it is followed by *Wèi Jì*—its meaning is the same.
**Yin’s qi** completes things **above**; **Yang’s mandate** begins **below**, ready to **replenish**.

The Wang manuscript reads *"如"* (as); now following the other texts.
Sòng says: *"At this time, Yin completes things above; those who have fulfilled their function withdraw, so Yang’s qi begins anew below."*

**First day:** The **general constructs deceit**, **original peril**.
*Cè* says: *"The general constructs deceit"*—**danger takes command**.
Fàn says: *"Peril"*—**danger**.
*"Original"*—**beginning**.
Wang says: *"At the start of the general’s term, yet out of place at night, constructing deceit."*
Taking **danger as foundation**, hence *"takes command"*.
Guāng says: One is **thought’s beginning**, yet presiding over **night**, hence this symbol.

**Second day:** The **general has no flaw**, **original clarity**.
*Cè* says: *"The general has no flaw"*—**easy to follow**.
Fàn says: *"Clarity"*—**purity**#21.
Wang says: *"Obtaining position while presiding over drawing, the general few in faults, hence ‘the general has no flaw.’"*
The **essence of two** is pure and clear, hence *"original clarity"*.
Beginning without flaw, **later it will be easy to continue**.
Guāng says: Two is **thought’s middle**, yet presiding over **drawing**#22, hence this symbol.

**Third day:** **Furnace and potter’s wheel**—**disaster**; advantageous to **halt and use**.
*Cè* says: *"Furnace and potter’s wheel"*—**internal injury from transformation**.
The Sòng and Lù *Cè* reads *"钧不化"* (wheel does not transform); now following Fàn and Wang’s texts.
Fàn says: *"Smelting"* is **furnace**, *"pottery"* is **wheel**.
Wang says: *"Furnace and wheel"*—**the beginning of creation**.
Beginning yet **not by its proper method**, advantage lies in **quick cessation**.
The **general’s path grows strong**, yet **out of place at night**, a **general not acting by principle**.
Guāng says: *"Disaster"*—**unfavorable**, pronounced *bǐ*.
Three is **fulfilling intent**, yet presiding over **night**, hence this symbol.

**Fourth day:** The **general flies and gains wings**, advantageous to **ascend to Heaven**.
*Cè* says: *"The general flies and gains wings"*—**its aid is strong**.
Four is **low fortune**, **external**, yet presiding over **drawing**.
The **noble obtains position**; **people assist him**; like a **general flying and gaining wings**.

**Fifth day:** The **great bird flies**, **plucking its feathers**.
Though feathers are many, they **cannot reach their destination**.
*Cè* says: *"The great bird plucks its feathers"*—**unreliable aid**.

The **Sage** says: *"Five dwells in a place of prominence, ought to be the foremost lord, yet loses position at night, contrary to what is proper. Like a great bird about to take flight, yet plucking its six wings—though feathers be many, how could it ever fly?*

**Guāng** says: *"The Duke of Jìn’s words to Pínggōng: ‘I have over three thousand guests in my service—can I still be said to neglect the worthy?’*

**Gùsāng** #23 says: *"The wild goose soars to the heavens, relying on its six wings alone. The down beneath its belly, the fur upon its back—if even a handful were removed, its flight would neither rise nor fall. Does not your lordship’s retinue consist of these six wings, or merely the down and fur of belly and back?"*

**Sixth day:** The sun loses its brilliance, the noble begins to decline.
*Cè* says: *"The sun loses its brilliance"*—**its radiance is at its peak**.
The **Sòng and Lǔ** manuscripts read *"shànglóng"* (ascend/flourish) for *"shuāngjiàng"* (decline), while the **Wáng** manuscript also reads *"lóng"* for *"jiàng"* (decline). I follow the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.
**Xiǎo Sòng** reads *"shī"* (lose) as *"wú"* (brute), which I follow among the other manuscripts.
**Fàn** says: *"Jiàng"* means **to descend**. Five is the **midday sun**, hence six is the **waning sun**. *"Lièliè"* means **abundance**. The sun’s heat is greatest only after midday, hence *"lièliè"* is spoken of.

**Guāng** says: *"Shī"* is homophonous with *"yì"* (waning), pronounced *tújié*. Six is **high fortune**, yet exceeding midday and presiding over **drawing**, though possessing great abundance, the noble knows it must decline, able to humble itself—thus its radiance remains unwaned.

**Seventh day:** The boat **lurches**, the carriage **stumbles**—its harm is not distant.
*Cè* says: *"The boat lurches, the carriage stumbles"*—**harm is near**.
The **Wáng** manuscript reads *"gōng"* (arm) for *"chuán"* (boat) and *"yuǎn"* (distant) for *"é"* (far), which I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ,** and **Fàn** manuscripts here.
*"Zhuǎ"* is pronounced *qùxiè*.
*"Bá"* is pronounced *púbó*.

「**Fàn** says: Seven is **the loss of aspiration**. The boat and carriage are the means of governance; the worthy are also the means to govern the world. The one who loses aspiration is the master of calamity, hence the **lurching and stumbling**; abandoning the means of governance brings self-harm, so the danger is not distant.

**Guāng** says: Seven marks the **beginning of disaster** and corresponds to **night**, hence this symbol. When a state is about to fall, it first abandons its worthy advisors.

**Eighth day:** The **young** are in the **abyss**, the **elder** abandons the boat.
**Cè** says: The elder abandons the boat—**to rescue the drowning world**.
**Fàn** says: The young refer to the **common people**. In times of calamity, as though in an abyss, the elder abandons the boat to save them.
**Guāng** says: Eight is **the midst of disaster**, yet corresponds to **day**, hence this symbol.

**Ninth day:** The **scarlet silkworm** clings to the **dead mulberry**, its cocoon not **yellow**.
**Cè** says: Clinging to the dead mulberry and not yielding yellow—**the silkworm’s labor is ruined**.
The **Fàn** manuscript reads *"clings to the dead mulberry, not yellow"* as *"clings to the dead mulberry"* and *"its cocoon not yellow"*, while the **Wáng** manuscript reads *"dead mulberry, not yellow"*, and I follow the **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts here.
**Fàn** says: When the silkworm first emerges, its **bristles** are red like those of the aged, hence the **scarlet**.
**Wáng** says: Nine dwells at the **ultimate peak**, yet loses its position and corresponds to **night**, with nowhere to turn. The **scarlet silkworm** is the **ailing silkworm**. But clinging to the **dead mulberry**, how could it ever form its cocoon? **Not yellow** means **unfruitful**.

**Threefold calamity in three states and three regions**—**one household’s ruin**#25.
**Dàn** (danger) is pronounced *nǎi* (to endure).
**Yang** household calamity is measured by **obstruction**; **Yīn** *qi* is **threefold difficulty**, with water **congealing** and earth **cracking**, while **yang** is weak in the abyss.
The **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *"Yīn qi fāng nǎn"* (difficulty of **Yīn** *qi*) as *"Tài yīn nǎn"* (ultimate **Yīn** difficulty), and I follow the other manuscripts here.
**Xiǎo Sòng** says: When **Yīn** reaches its **ultimate extremity**, **yang** *qi* arrives with **reassurance**, and **Yīn** fears **yang**, causing **great peril and difficulty**. At the very start of the first day:

**First day:** **Calamity** befalls me, **obscure and formless**.
**Cè** says: **Calamity** befalls me, **obscure and formless**—**it is yet unseen**.
The **Fàn** manuscript reads *"it is not yet seen"*, and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts here.
**Calamity** is the symbol of **obstruction and suppression**. One is the **slightest hint of thought**, yet it corresponds to **day**. **Obstructing and suppressing** disaster and evil when they are still **unseen**—what greater **illness** could there be?

**Second day:** **Frozen** at the **ice ford**, the **wild horse** drags the **wood**#28.
**Cè** says: The **wild horse** drags the **wood**—**reckless birth**.
The **Fàn** manuscript omits *"at"* and reads *"drags"* as *chǔ* (to hold), and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts here.

**Third day:** **Firm in the center**, **calamity** arises from **extraordinary forces**.
**Cè** says: **Firm in the center**, **never to be toppled**.
The **Wáng** manuscript reads *"toppled"* as *gù* (to look back), and I follow the other manuscripts here.
Three is **the completion of intent**, yet it corresponds to **day**. The **heart** can **fortify and endure**, obstructing and suppressing **extraordinary forces**.

**Fourth day:** The **egg cracks the stone**, **ruined**#29.
**Cè** says: The **egg cracks the stone** and is **ruined**—**the calamity of the lowly**.
The **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts read *"calamity"* as *zá* (mixed), and I follow the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.
**Ruined** is pronounced *túwàn* (to play idly).
**Wáng** says: In times of **calamity**, losing its position and corresponding to **night**, one does not know the **way of calamity**. Hence, when the **egg cracks the stone**, it is **ruined**, and **unfruitfulness** is certain.

**Fifth day:** **Calamity** without **interval**, though great, it is **not laborious**.
**Cè** says: **Calamity** without **interval**—**the heart is sealed and closed**.
**Wáng** says: Obtaining its position in the center, it becomes the **master of calamity**. It can **block and seal** the onset, leaving no **interval**, so that disaster has no way to enter. Even in the midst of **great calamity**, one avoids harm without exertion.

**Sixth day:** The **great carriage** moves **heavily**#30, **upward** on the **mountain**, **downward** into the **river**.
**Cè** says: The **great carriage** moves **heavily**—**upward and downward, obstructed**.
The **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts read *"heavily"* as *chuánchuán*.
**Wú** says: **River** is pronounced *biān* (ford), but the **Fàn, Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts read *"obstructed"* as *yù* (to block), and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ** manuscripts here.
**Wú** says: **To block** is pronounced *kǔhǎi* (bitter sea).
**Yù** is pronounced *érzhèn* (to shake).
**Fàn** says: **Heavy movement** is the **appearance of delay**.
**Wáng** says: Six dwells in **abundance and fullness**, yet loses its position and corresponds to **night**, unable to avoid **calamity’s proper course**.

**Seventh day:** **Pulling up the stone**, **strength is exhausted** in the effort.
**Cè** says: **Pulling up the stone**—**seizing the moment**.
The **Fàn** manuscript reads *"exhausted"* as *jìn* (to finish), and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts here.
**Pulling** is pronounced *zhìrén* (the person).」

「The **Sòng** says: **"Time"** refers to the **day** (daytime).
**Fàn** says: **Stone** is used to signify **difficulty**. **川川**—the **appearance of difficulty** (or calamity).

**Wáng** says: When **Yin-qi** reaches its extreme, even if frozen and solidified like **congealed ice**, there is **fearful dread** (戁) and **injury** (恐) from **external assaults**. Though **Yang-qi** is still faint, it will **collide** (邸) with the **obscure** (冥) and **encounter** (触) its **darkness** (昧), revealing its **strength** (膂力) within. As **Yin-qi** reaches its peak and **Yang-qi** begins to rise, the **symbol** (象) reflects **toil and exertion**.

**First line:** **Toil in deliberation**, **obstructed integrity** (否贞).
**Cè** says: **Toil in deliberation** and **obstructed integrity**—**the center is not upright** (中不正也).
The **Fàn, Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts lack the character **"deliberation"** (谋), which I adopt from the **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts here.
**Wáng** says: At the **beginning of toil**, yet **losing position** (失位) as **night**, it is **toil without adherence to the Dao/Way** (勤而不以其道者也). **Obstructed integrity** means **not upright** (不正之谓也).
**Guāng** says: **One** marks the **start of thought**, the **beginning of toil and exertion**. As it belongs to the **toil family** yet aligns with **night**, hence this **symbol**.

**Second line:** **Toil with favor**, **exertion earnest and sincere** (勤悾悾), the **noble one finds harmony** (君子有中).
**Cè** says: **Toil with favor** and **earnest exertion**—**it encompasses all emotions** (有诸情也). **悾悾**—pronounced *kōng* (empty), akin to **reverent** (款款).
**Wáng** says: **Two** **gains position** (得位) as **day**, **adhering to the Dao/Way of toil**. **Toil with favor**—**exertion that is not wasted** (勤不虚施者也). **悾悾**—**reverent and sincere**, **unflagging in toil** (勤之而款款, 不倦其勤者也). Moreover, **the noble one’s harmony** (君子之中道) is attained, so what **fault or regret** (咎悔) could possibly arise?
**Guāng** says: **Harmony** (中)—**sincere devotion** (至诚). **Two** marks the **midpoint of thought**, aligning with **day**. The **noble one** **fulfills loyalty** (尽忠) toward others; **favor and toil** (恩斯勤斯) are sincere and **earnest** (悾悾), not merely superficial expressions.

**Third line:** **Bound and constrained** (羁角), **my lament is incessant** (泣呱呱), **yet lacking embrace and support** (未得襁扶).
**Cè** says: **Bound and constrained**—**unable to fulfill its mandate** (不得命也).
The **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *"yet lacking"* (未得) as *"yet without"* (未有), which I follow from the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Fàn** manuscripts here. The **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts read *"support"* (扶) as *"staff"* (杖), which I follow from the **Wáng** manuscript here.
**呱呱**—the sound of weeping.
**Wáng** says: **Male** (角) and **female** (羁)—**ornaments for children**. **吾吾**—**restless and aimless**. **呱呱**—**cries**. **襁**—to **embrace**; **扶**—to **hold**. If a child **cries in distress** (吾吾然无所归之貌), yet **cannot be embraced or held** (不得长者抱持之) by elders, even if **toiling in sorrow**, it will **never find resolution**. This illustrates **three**, when **toil and difficulty** (劳苦) are at their height, yet **losing position** (失位) as **night**, **with nowhere to turn**; hence the **symbol**.

**Fourth line:** **Toil in strength**, **abandoning subservience** (放陪), **forgetting sustenance** (忘食), the **great person achieves victory** (大人有克).
**Cè** says: **Toil in strength**, **forgetting sustenance**—**the virtue/power of the great person** (大人德).
The **Fàn** manuscript reads *"subservience"* (陪) as *"doubling"* (倍), which I follow from the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts here.
The **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts read *"virtue/power"* (德) as *"attainment"* (得), which I follow from the **Fàn, Wáng, and Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.
**放**—pronounced *fǔwàng* (to abandon).
**Wáng** says: As **toil in the Dao/Way** grows **profound**, yet **gains position** (得位) as **day**, **without losing its proper course** (不失其宜). This is when, **amidst toil and difficulty**, one can **strengthen its efforts** (勤其力), **abandoning subservience** (放乎陪隶之事), and **forgetting the rewards of sustenance** (忘其禄食之报). Only **the great person** (大人) can **achieve this**, leading to **success**.

**Guāng** says: **Four** marks the **lower rank of sustenance**, yet **aligns with day**; hence this **symbol**.

**Fifth line:** **Frenzied and stumbling** (狂蹇蹇), **calamity is near** (祸迩), **fortune is distant** (福远).
**Cè** says: **Frenzied stumbling**—**fortune is far away** (远乎福也).
The **Sòng, Lǔ, and Fàn** manuscripts read *"frenzied"* (狂) as *"to go"* (往), which I follow from the **Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.
**Wáng** says: **Five** **dwells in a position of abundance**, yet **loses position** (失位) as **night**. **Toil** (勤) **greatly departs from its proper course** (大失其宜), hence the **symbol of frenzy and stumbling**. **Fortune is distant** (福远), **while calamity is near** (祸迩).

**Sixth line:** **Toil achieves success**, **approaching the heavens** (几于天).
**Cè** says: **Toil achieves success**—**heavenly aid arrives** (天所来辅).
The **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts read *"approaching the heavens"* (几于天) as *"heavenly nearness"* (天夹).
**Sòng** says: **夹**—**nearness**.
**Lǔ** says: **夹**—**harmony**.
The **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *"heavenly nearness"* (天夹), which I follow from the **Fàn** manuscript here.
**Wáng** says: **Six** **dwells in a position of abundance**, yet **gains position** (得位) as **day**; hence, **"toil achieves success"** (勤有成功). **几**—**nearness**.

**Seventh line:** **Toil drags, yet not by the nose**, **but by the tail** (于尾), **exhausted** (弊).
**Cè** says: **The exhaustion of toil**—**its Dao/Way is contrary** (其道逆也).
**Fàn** says: **Dragging an ox by the tail** (牵牛不其鼻, 而尾) **causes exhaustion**; hence, **toil is exhausted** (故劳弊也).

Guāng says: **"Seven"** is **a rope**, is **a cord**, and also **lost resolve**—yet it corresponds to night, hence this symbol.

**Eighth line:** **Toil is restless** (踖踖), **the heart is weary** (心爽), **the blindfolded ox refuses to move** (蒙柴不却).
**Cè** says: **Toil wearies the heart**—**it is a sacrifice to the state**.

**Tread** (踖), pronounced *wú zī xī* (吴资昔切), **Xiao Sòng** reads it as *què* (鹊).

**Ninth line, at the apex:** **His toil, his toil!** **He carries a chariot into the abyss**, **drags a boat up the mountain**.
**Cè** says: **His toil, his toil!** **Toil finds no reward**.
**Wáng** says: **Nine dwells in the extreme height**, yet **loses its proper time** (当夜), **toiling without the Dao/Way**.

**Three directions, three states, three regions, three households**—**nurturing the Yang family’s gold**, **aligned with the chin** (准颐).
**At the end of Nine**, **heaven’s measure of qi remains**, **yet still has sixty minutes, twenty-four seconds**.
**Tread** (踦) **should be forty minutes sixteen seconds**, **Excess** (赢) **should be twenty minutes eight seconds**.
**Yin swells upon the wilds**, **Yang nurtures all things**, **their hue is red below**.
**Sòng and Lǔ** read **弸 (弸)** as **胎 (tāi)**, **Wáng** as **殆 (dài)**; **Xiao Sòng** reads **赤 (chì)** as **殷 (yīn)**, now following the **Fàn** manuscript.
**弸 (弸)** has no entry in the character dictionaries.
**弧 (hú)**, pronounced *pú méng* (蒲萌切).
**芦 (lú)**, pronounced *chén wú hóu* (陈吴侯切), in **Wú** as *fú* (敷).
**Fàn** says: **弸 (弸)**—**fullness at its peak**.
**蓲 (蓲)**, **concealment**. **When things first emerge**, their color is red.
**This refers to the time when Yin-qi swells to its extreme in the fields** (於田野), **so Yang conceals itself**, and all things are red below.
**Lǔ** says: **蓲 (蓲)**, pronounced like **沤 (yōu)** in **沤菅 (yōu jiān)**.
**It speaks of Yang nourishing the roots of all things**, making them all red.

**Guāng** says: **弸 (弸)**, **fullness**.

**First line:** **Hide the heart in the abyss**, **nurture its sacred root**.
**Cè** says: **Hide the heart in the abyss**—**the spirit does not stray**.
**Xiao Sòng** reads **美厥灵根 (měi jué líng gēn)** as **美厥灵元 (měi jué líng yuán)**, now following the other manuscripts.
**Guāng:** **One is thinking of the lower realm**.
**Preserving the spirit and securing the root**—**this is how one nurtures life**.

**Second line:** **Silent nourishment of evil**, **the origin contains no integrity**.
**Cè** says: **Silent nourishment of evil**—**the heart is corrupt**.
**Fàn** manuscript reads **匪 (fěi)** as **否 (pǐ)**, now following **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng**.
**Wú** says: **墨 (mò)**, same as **默 (mò)**.
**函 (hán)**, pronounced *hú nán* (胡男切).
**Wáng** says: **Losing its position at night**, **losing the proper way of nurturing**, **silently following the crooked path**.
**Guāng** says: **元 (yuán)**, **beginning**. **Two is thinking of the middle**, yet **it corresponds to night**.
**The wickedness of the petty man**, though not yet manifest in speech or action, **nurtures his evil inclinations**; **internally harboring what is not upright**, he can never enter the path of the noble.

**Third line:** **Manure the mound to fertilize it**, **nurture its roots and shoots**.
**Cè** says: **Manure the mound to fertilize it**—**the center shines brightly**.
**荄 (tì)**, pronounced *gǔ āi* (古哀切).
**Wáng** says: **Obtaining its position at day**, **skilled in the Dao of nurturing**, hence the symbol of **manuring the fertile mound** to **nurture the roots and shoots of grasses and trees**. **Thus their growth and flourishing can be awaited without delay**.

**Fourth line:** **The swallow eats sparingly**, **its resolve is firm**, **advantageous to go on a trading expedition**.
**Cè** says: **The swallow eats sparingly**—**its resolve is in reliance**.
**Xiao Sòng** reads **在 (zài)** as **有 (yǒu)**, now following the other manuscripts.
**扁 (biǎn)**, pronounced like **篇 (piān)**.
** (jué)**, pronounced *jū huò* (居蠖切).
**贾 (gǔ)**, pronounced like **古 (gǔ)**.
**Sòng** says: **赖 (lài)**, **advantage**.
**Guāng** says: **Four is lower fortune**, yet **it corresponds to night**.
**The petty man obtains his position**, his resolve is in **seeking advantage for self-nurturing**. **Like the swallow flying in a sparse manner**, **eating merely to survive**. **This is merely the way of the merchant**.

**Fifth line:** **Yellow heart within the belly**, **white bones grow flesh**, **sincere virtue does not return**.
**Cè** says: **Yellow heart within the belly**—**upper virtue aligns with Heaven**.
**Fàn** manuscript reads **上德 (shàng dé)** as **上得 (shàng dé)**, now following **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng**.
**Sòng** says: **It speaks of upper virtue like Heaven’s bestowal**.
**Guāng** says: **Yellow**, **the middle**. **Bone**, **the withered thing**. **Sincere**, **the thorough trust**.
**Five is fortune’s center**, yet **it corresponds to day**, **the master of nurturing**.
**Firmly holding the middle**, **to nurture all under Heaven**, even **white bones can grow flesh**, **how much more so for people?** **How much more so for birds, beasts, grasses, and trees?**
**Its virtue is like Heaven’s**—**clouds move, rain descends**, **governing the four quarters**, **and no creature can repay such virtue**.

**Sixth line:** **Repeatedly, daily three meals**, **the sacrificial ox’s omen**, **fat but not advantageous**.
**Cè** says: **Repeatedly fed**, **fat without substance**.
**Wáng** manuscript omits **次次 (cì cì)**, **Xiao Sòng** reads **沉沉睢睢 (chén chén suī suī)**, also saying **fat and lost in substance**, now following **Sòng, Lǔ, and Fàn**.
**Wú** says: **次 (cì)**, same as **趑 (zī)**, pronounced *zī*.
**Fàn** says: **次次**, **the appearance of unrest**.
**The ox already divined**, **awaiting fattening before use**, hence **no substance**.
**Lǔ** says: **Six dwells in overfullness**, **loses its position at night**, **nurturing too excessively**, **yet not appropriately**.
Hence the symbol of **daily three meals**, **to enrich its food**, like the **sacrificial ox of the ancestral temples**, **fed beyond measure**, **already answering the divined omen**, yet **the fatter it grows**, **the more it harms its body**.
**Guāng** says: **Six is upper fortune at night**, hence this symbol.

**Seventh line:** **The young boy leads the elephant**, **the woman is fierce**, **the noble nurtures his illness**.
**Cè** says: **Leading the elephant to nurture illness**—**they do not correspond**.
**Sòng and Lǔ** read **徽 (huī)** as **微 (wēi)**, now following the other manuscripts.
**Wáng** says: **Seven dwells in the overfull position**, **near danger**.
Yet **obtaining its position at day**, **the noble in it is auspicious**, **the petty man and woman in it are inauspicious**. **Like the young boy leading the elephant**, **his strength cannot control it**, **necessarily bringing peril**.
Only the noble **knows the limits of time**, **nurturing his illness with the Dao**, thus **can he attain final auspiciousness**.
**One auspicious, one inauspicious**, **two paths opposed**, hence **they do not correspond**.

**Guāng** says: **徽 (huī)**, **a great rope**, meaning **to tether and bind**.

「**Měng**—**a fierce beast**. Seven brings ruin and misfortune, **the onset of calamity**, hence **illness**.
When the time is day, **it belongs to the noble**. **Over-nurturing it brings fortune’s peak and disaster’s arrival**.
The petty man, **not measuring his strength**, yet still **clings stubbornly to his cultivation**.
The noble **knows the limits of time**, **harmonizing with its waxing and waning**, **like tending an illness**—thus **no blame attaches**.

**Next, Eight**: **a lodged obstruction**, **untamed**, **poisonous sickness erupts**, **ghosts ascend the mound**.
**Cè says**: **The eruption of the lodged sickness** **returns to the tomb**.
Eight is **the heart of disaster**, **at night**.
The petty man **persists in his nurturing without cease**, **like a bone lodged in the throat**, **unable to dislodge it**, **thus inviting great calamity**.
Like **poisonous sickness erupting**, **beyond remedy**.

**Uppermost Nine**: **Stars align as the year aligns**, **returning to the beginning’s succession**.
**Cè says**: **Stars aligning as the year aligns**—**completing the nurturing of the start**.
The **Rán** manuscript reads **"completing the start’s nurturing"**—now following the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts.
Nurturing at **Uppermost Nine**, **dwelling at the end of the *Zàn***,
The sun **reaches its limit in the next hexagram**, the moon **in its cycle**, the stars **revolve in heaven**, the year **shall renew its beginning**.
**Completing the nurturing of the start**, **beginning to succeed the end**, **cycling endlessly**—this is **how the Dao of Heaven is boundless**.

**Zàn of the One: Water.**»

「**Zàn of the Two: Fire.**
**Zàn**, insufficiency also. The **year** is **fixed at three hundred sixty-five days plus one-fourth of a day**.
**Xuán** has seven hundred twenty-nine **Zàn**, corresponding to three hundred sixty-four days and a half.
Its insufficiency is half a day, which is called **Zàn of the Two**.
**Zàn**, pronounced *jù-yí* (居宜切).

**Frozen** ascends to the **crimson sky**, **dusk** descends into the **dark spring**.
**Cè says**: *"Frozen ascends to the crimson sky"*—**this marks the beginning of the yin**.
**Fàn says**: *"Frozen"* is **the utmost cold**; **yet the sky** is **the utmost height**.
*"Dusk"* is **the utmost heat**; **yet the spring** is **the utmost depth**.
**Frozen** is at the **sky’s zenith**, hence it marks the **beginning**.
**Guāng says**: *"Crimson"* is **the peak of yang**; *"dark"* is **the extreme of yin**.
**All things reach extremes and reverse**—since the **beginning of time**,
**Yin and yang** mutually **generate**#38,
**Day and night** mutually **follow**#38,
**Good and evil** mutually **lean against**,
**Order and chaos** mutually **persist**,
**Gain and loss** mutually **multiply**,
**Fortune and misfortune** mutually **contradict**#39—
**these are all the natural principles of Heaven and humanity**.

**Yíng Zàn of the Two: Fire.**
**Yíng**, excess also. Beyond the **three hundred sixty-five days** of the **year**, there is an excess of one-fourth of a day, which is called **Yíng Zàn**.
**One insufficiency, one excess**—**the Zàn of the Two** are what they **produce**.
**Cè says**: *"One insufficiency, one excess"*—**the cycles never cease**.
The **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts read *"Zàn of the Two"* as *"Zàn of the Odd"* (踦奇), and the **Fàn** manuscript reads *"cycles"* (儃) as *"meditation"* (禅); now following the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts.
*"Cycles"*, anciently *"meditation"* (禅), pronounced *shèn* (时战切).
**Lǔ says**: *"When yin reaches its extreme and yang arises, they mutually cycle and replace each other without end."*
**Guāng says**: *"The calculations of insufficiency and excess*#35#36—**even Heaven and Earth cannot equalize them."*
**Only when they are unequal** can **transformation and change** occur, **endlessly generating**.
Thus it is said: *"Twenty-nine days of insufficiency*#27#35#36, **and the moon shifts to the next cycle**;
*Twenty-seven days of insufficiency*#27#35#36, **and it completes the Heavenly revolution**.*
Then there are **the dark and new moons**, **the ten celestial stems**, **the twelve terrestrial branches**,
Then there are **the six divisions of pregnancy**—this is **how they endure forever**.

**Chapter Seven: Commentary on the *Tàixuán* Scriptures – *Shànglíng* Xu Hàn’s Annotations**
**Preface to *Xuānshǒu* (The Mysterious Origin)**

The main text has already been presented earlier; the preface is omitted to avoid repetition.

The **mysterious patterns** of the **cosmic whole**—
One yin and one yang interweave,
Yet harmonized by the **Three**—this is how they function.

The **Mysterious** encompasses **Three Systems**,
And within them, one yang governs one system,
Giving rise to all things.

From the **regions, states, districts, and households**,
Each follows the **One, Two, or Three**—
This is called **the dispersion of the Three Positions**.

It is said: *"Arrange the Nine Nines,*
To calculate the birth of all things."

The **Nine Circuits** flow cyclically with voids,
Establishing divisions to disperse—
Life perpetuates without end.

**Praise to the Supreme Principles**—
This is the **opening discourse**.

Now it gathers names,
Systematizing the **Mysterious lineage**.

**The Mysterious Origin**—
The opening text is scattered beneath the scriptures and is omitted here to avoid repetition.

The *Yì* divides the **hexagrams** to govern the calendar:
Each line represents one day,
And sixty hexagrams complete the **360-day cycle**.

**Kǎn, Lǐ, Zhèn, and Duì** serve as the **Four Cardinal Directors** in their seasons.

The **solstices and equinoxes** mark the four seasons,
Each line representing one **qi**,
And four hexagrams completing the **24 seasonal qi**.

The *Commentary* states:
*"The *Jiǎzǐ* hexagram-qi begins with *Zhōngfá*."*

Seven parts of the **80% day**—
This is the **beginning of the Mysterious Scriptures**.

*Zhōngfá* governs the **first sign of Winter Solstice**—
The so-called *"earthworms knotting."*

From the **first day of the cycle** to the **third day of the revolution**,
It is then **received by *Fù* (Repetition).**

*Fù* governs the **second sign**—
The so-called *"deer antlers shedding."*

From the **fourth day of the revolution** to the **sixth day of *Lún* (Abundance)**,
It is then **received by *Tún* (Difficulty).**

*Tún* governs the **third sign**—
The so-called *"waters and springs moving."*

From the **seventh day of *Lún*** to the **ninth day of *Xián* (Dispersion)**,
The **three hexagrams’ qi** are now complete.

Each hexagram has a remainder—
Seven parts of the **80% day**—
Overlapping and interwoven to form the whole.

At the year’s end, the **sixty hexagrams** govern the **Eighty-One Mysterious Origins**,
And the **Mysterious qi** permeates thus.

Therefore, some hexagrams recur—
For the **qi’s numbers** flow between Heaven and Earth,
Encountering obstacles that remain unresolved,
Or erupting chaotically without control—
Thus the hexagrams mirror these phenomena.

They accumulate and connect sequentially,
Hence the **twenty-one Origins** share similarities.

Scholars who dismiss the **four-seasonal hexagrams**
And claim *"Lǐ corresponds to separation, Zhèn to doubt, Duì to stagnation, Kǎn to diligence"*
Fail to grasp the **calendar’s true function**.

**Preface to *Xuāncōng* (The Mysterious Collision)**

The main text has already been presented earlier; the preface is omitted to avoid repetition.

One day, one **daytime**, one **nighttime**—
Uniting the **Dao of day and night** in understanding,
This is the **divine clarity of the Sun**,
Hence its symbols are modeled after it.

By day, the **yang** promotes the **Five Blessings** in ascending order,
By night, the **yin** descends through the **Six Extremes**.

Ascension and descent are interdependent,
Thus the **Origins** are established to measure **transformations**.

One and Six form the **North**,
Two and Seven form the **South**—this is the **vertical axis**.

Three and Eight form the **East**,
Four and Nine form the **West**—this is the **horizontal axis**.

The **Central Five** mark the **Pole**,
Also serving as the **vertical axis**.

The **Six *Jiǎ* (Stems)** strike between them,
While the **Sun** moves inversely,
Meeting the **Big Dipper**—
For the Dipper moves in order.

The Dipper aligns with the **month** to establish the **four seasons**,
And the **Sun** meets it once,
Completing **366 days** in the year.

When **years, months, days, and times** remain unaltered,
All grains flourish—
Thus the **Mysterious Collision** governs the world,
Illuminating the **bright**, nurturing the **talented people**,
And bringing **peace and prosperity** to households.

**The Mysterious Collision (Text)**
The **divination text** is scattered beneath the various **praises** and is omitted here to avoid repetition.

Xu Hàn’s annotations are incomplete.
**The Mysterious Collision**.»

The **Central** marks the **beginning of Yang**,
The **responding** gives rise to **Yin**.

**Zhou** returns to **virtue**;
**Ying** opposes **punishment**.

**Steep sorrow** is **great**,
**Encountering** is **small desire**.

**Loneliness** is solitary, yet the **hearth** is neighborly.

**Yang** is **virtue**,
**Yin** is **punishment**.

**Virtue** is first **arduous**, then **easy**,
**Punishment** is first **beneficial**, then **obstructed**.

Great sorrow and solitude—
**Uprightness** has not yet prevailed.

Small desire and neighborliness—
**Benefit** is just emerging.

**Minority** is **subtle**;
**Majority** is **abundant**.

**Steadfastness** is **internal return**;
**Expansiveness** is **external deviation**.

Internal sorrow and external solitude,
Yet failing to **subtle** it—then **harm** occurs.

To **subtle** it is to **return** and **touch**—
This is the **Way** of Heaven.

Encountering the **hearth** and becoming **abundant**,
**Expanding** yet **increasing emptiness**—then **loneliness**.

Uprightness cannot prevail,
Yet **many causes** give rise to it.

Families without the **‘also’** character—only the **Song** edition has it.

**Above**, **touching** the **plain**;
**Text**, **many causes**.

**Many causes** must be **adorned** and **curved** to completion—
Thus it is **text**.

When **plain** is **tied** and **straightened**, **substance** prevails.

**Dryness** is **madness**;
**Rite** is **rectitude**.

**Hunting** brings **approach**,
**Fleeing** brings **loss**.

To **dry** without **yielding**—
The **madness** of **seizing**—not the **rectitude** of **rite**.

Yet the **Noble One** sometimes **dries**,
Only to **save the world**.

As **Mencius** says:
*"To flatter the great, they scorn you—*
This is the speech of the **mad**."

**Approach** should be **gradual**,
**Loss** should be **swift**.

**Above**, **dryness** generates **madness**,
**Ying**, **excess** generates **curvature**.

The **Records** say:
*"Rite is shaped by the land."*

From **response** to **rite**, it is fully realized in **royal governance**.

Yet if **uprightness** cannot prevail, one **flees**—
This is the **joy of retreat**.

**Rite** and **text** arise from **external deviation**,
Then **strengthen the world**.

Families without the **‘also’** character—**Song** has it.

**Excess** is **private curvature**;
**Tang** is **public** without **desire**.

**Difference** is **error**;
Yet **constant grain**.

From **excess**, private curvature—
**Movement** errs and **oversteps**.

From **Tang**, public without desire—
**Guarding constancy** and **abundance**,
Thus the **cultivator of heart** takes warning.

**Tang** is the **great heart**.
**Constancy** is the **Way** of **ten thousand ages** of **lord and subject**.

The **preface** of **Ru Lǐ Gōng** on the **lord and subject’s Way** says:
*"From this beginning, the year shall have [its harvest]."*

The **Noble One** has **abundance**,
**Transmitting** to descendants.

Speaking of **constant abundance** in **responding** to things by **kind**,
And the year having its **autumn**.

**Rite** withdraws the self to **publicize** the world,
Until the **phases of fleeing** and **Tang** have passed,
Yet the **rectitude** of **lord and subject** does not change.

Then **rite** is seen—
The **strengthening** of the world’s **function**.

This is called **retreat as progress**,
**Publicizing private** to fulfill its **private**.

**Youthful** and **few**—
**Preeminent** yet **without lack**.

**Few** is **excessive**;
**Without lack** is **moderation**.

**Youthful**—**benefit** returns in **excess**.
**Measure**—**skill** in **holding abundance**.

**Increase** begins to **flourish**,
And **endures** to **lengthen**.

**Sharp** holds **oneness**,
And **Kun** achieves **great harmony**.

**Reaching** daily **benefits** its **kind**;
**Reduction** daily **diminishes** its **gathering**.

**Exchange** is **following**;
**Lip** is **not communicating**.

**Lip**—**awe**;
**Guarding**—**unassailable**.

**Song** has the **‘also’** character,
And **‘guarding above’** also has it—families lack it.

**Rui** emerges,
**Xī** retreats.

**Following** is **dispersing**;
**Plummeting** is **gathering**.

Families have the **‘also’** character—**Ding** lacks it.

**Advancing** is **many schemes**;
**Accumulating** is **many riches**.

**Madness** and **simplicity** support **Ying**,
**Excess** and **brightness** err and **miss**—
Returning to their **true nature**, the **youthful** bring **auspice**.

**Youthful** with **few**—
**Excessive** yet **rarely erring**.

From **youthful** to **increase**,
**Pure virtue** flourishes.

Holding **oneness** and **reaching** it,
Exchanging with **kind**—then **movement** arises.

Thus **awe** must be present,
And **excess** expelled,
**Error** warned against,
While **Ying** and **Rui** preserve **virtue**.

The **Commentary** says:
*"To have and act upon it—*
Then **ease** takes it—
**Hao Tian** should not take from here."

**Following**—its people **divide** things likewise,
**Unfolding** thoughts to **dispel** moral **patterns**.

Advancing with **many schemes**,
Yet none dare **set** within **oneness**—
**Extending** it to **reach** its **ultimate** is all.

The **Great Learning’s** governance,
By which the world is **pacified** and **joyous**—
This is its **essence**.

**Losing rectitude** and **fleeing**,
**Forgetting worry** and **Tang**—
Yet **constancy** and **measure** are not **replaced**,
The **function** of **rite**.

**Measure** holds **abundance**,
Until **lengthening** and **great harmony**,
Then **changing** to **reduction**,
**Lip** with all things,
**Returning** and **guarding** itself.

**Guarding** yet **not firm**,
Then **entering** to **accumulate**—
The **common people’s** affairs.

The **decadent Zhou** poetry says:
*"Like a merchant’s threefold gain—*
The **Noble One** recognizes this,
**Adapting** to the times."

When **greed for profit** prevails,
And **virtue and righteousness** decline,
Then what the world **relies on** to act
Is only **adornment**—
Not **reaching** **harmony**,
Thus **truth** shines **bright** across the world.

Hence **emptiness** and **deception** confuse the people,
**Right** and **wrong** are in **chaos**,
Causing the **outer** to be **dazzled** by **decay and separation**,
While the **inner** loses its **calm stillness**—
The world **tilts**.

This is the **age** of the **Noble One’s** **deep concealment**.

The world’s **birth**—
**One** of **order**, **one** of **chaos**—
Its **Way** is thus.

**Release** is **extension**;
**Adornment** is **decay**.

Things **approach** to **shed burdens**,
**Pushed** to **release**;
**Substance** decays, yet **adornment** is **achieved**.

**Extension** arises from the **inner**,
**Adornment** is **externally** set.

Human **truth**—
**Accumulated force** over time **hangs**, **resolves**, and **shines forth**,
Coming to its time **unbeknownst**.

**Gathering** is **decayed accumulation**,
Thus the **aged** warn against **obtaining**.

**Format**—**liking** is **affirmation**;
Yet **doubt**—**disliking** is **negation**.

**Liking** is already **settled**,
**Doubt** is **negation** yet **persuaded**—
**Liking** and **disliking** are **fixed**,
Called **formatting things** to **take** this.

**Level** and **flat**—**viewing** the **tilted**.

**Level**—each **finds its own flatness** and **ease**.
**Viewing**—**mutual tilting**.

The **Spring and Autumn Commentary** says:
*"Yet there is **observation**."*

**Holding level** and **cautious of tilting**,
Can **cultivate virtue**,
Can **nurture life**.

**Joy**—**uplifting**;
**Submergence**—**hidden storage**.

**Contention**—**scholar’s equality**;
**Inner**—**woman’s womb**.

Things **halt** at their **level**,
Then **joy** in their **emergence** and **contend** in their **guard**.

**Scholar’s equality**—**public’s ultimate**.

「**Woman’s womb**—the **ultimate of private affection**.

**Public triumph**,
Then all things **reveal themselves mutually**.
**Private triumph**,
Then all things **withdraw from each other**.

**Diligence** brings **joy**—
Scholars translate **joy** as *yí* (喜), Xu (许) and Huang (黄) as *xǐ* (憙).
**Departure** brings **sorrow**.
Song has no *shì* (事) character—
*Shàng* (尚) is **pursuit**,
*Huì* (晦) is **restraint**.

**Change**—**mutual transformation and laughter**;
**Obscurity**—**prolonged worry**;
**Disruption**—**excessive matters**;
**Exhaustion**—**no joy**.

From **joy** and **contention** arise **diligence** and **pursuit**,
From **change** and **harmonization** comes **rectification** for the **world**,
Only **level and tilting** can be **mastered**—
The **great person** alone can **bear this**.

I **judge decisively**,
Then the **multitude listens**,
And **matters converge**.

**Harmony and ease** flow through things,
Yet **exhaustion** is **unattainable**—
This is **joy**.

**Joy** must have **diligence**,
**Diligence** must have **remorse**,
**Pursuit** must have **change**,
When **change** occurs, **judgment** and **rectification** prevail.

**Resolute and daring**—
**To temper softness** with **severity**.

**Displacement**—**relocating settlements**;
**Restraint**—**no movement**.

**Multitude**—**warmth and gentleness**;
**Firmness**—**cold and rigidity**.

**Resolute** in **great affairs**,
**Displacement** seeks **departure**—
Like **Zhou’s encampment** at **Luoyi**—this is **rectification**.

When the **four directions’ folk** gather in **great harmony**,
It is the **symbol of warmth and gentleness**.

**Flourishing and decline** reach their **extremes**,
A **necessary destiny**.

Thus, **above**—**resolute and daring**—**actions are taken**,
**Below**—**the multitude follows with ease and harmony**,
While **displacement** lies within.

**Governance** should **peak at King Cheng’s grandeur**,
Yet **plan for King Ping’s declining era**,
**Displacement** awaits the **opportune moment**—
This is why **Duke Zhou** alone **perceived the subtle threads**.

**Softness restrained**—**no movement**,
**Firmness upheld**—**to stabilize the tilt**.

**Secrecy**—**unquestionable**;
**Completion**—**irrevocable**.

**Daring with resolve**—**displacement**,
While **warmth and gentleness** align with **secrecy**,
Ascending by **kindred**.

**Softness tempered by severity**—**restraint**,
**Cold rigidity preserving its completion**,
Descending by **examination**.

**Secrecy** is **uninterrupted**—**human nature**;
**Completion** is **irrevocable**—**heavenly mandate**.

**Human nature**—
**Resolute yet unharmful**,
**Naturally inclined to kindness**.

**Heavenly mandate**—
**Severity tempered yet unbroken**,
**Capable of nurturing life**.

**Kindness**—**kindness in virtue**;
**Severity**—**severity in grace**.

**Restraining** gains **fortune**,
**Losing** brings **misfortune**.

**Strength**—**virtue without weariness**;
**Excess**—**evil without cessation**.

**Vigilance**—**the **Sovereign’s Way**;
**Submission**—**the **Minister’s safeguard**.

**Flourishing** yet **approaching decline**,
**Kindness** must come **before restraint**,
**Restraint** must come **before strength**.

Then the **Sovereign’s Way** is **rectified**,
**Peaking in an era of prosperity**,
**Establishing law for all under heaven**.

Having **received completion**#3,
**Losing excess** yet **returning to submission**,
**Preserving what is gained**.

Then **yin** transforms with **aging change**,
**Yang** comes with **non-conformity**,
**Struggle** and **labor**—
The **subtle struggle** of **aging**.

Scholars translate **struggle** as *yǎn* (也),
Song as *shì* (事).

**Residence**—**attaining one’s station**;
**Hardship**—**encountering obstruction**.

**Attaining station**,
Then **no hardship** can **prevail**.

**Trust**—
One who **conforms to the Way** achieves **trust**,
**Hardship**—**awaiting the time** alone.

**Law**—**easily shared with all under heaven**;
**Labor**—**toil without reward**.

From **centrality to levelness**,
The **great person’s rectification**.

From **joy to law**,
The **sage’s governance**.

**Law** is **shared with all under heaven** alone,
Thus **easy**.
Yet if it were **not easy**,
Who could **harmonize with all under heaven**?

**Labor** follows **heaven’s Way**,
**Exertion** without **toil**—**reward** without **suffering**.

**The Way** not in its **proper time**,
**Toil without reward**—
Then **only cultivation** remains.

**Cultivation** receives **abundant surplus**,
The **noble cultivates auspiciousness**,
The **petty cultivates malevolence**.

Eighty-one chapters,
Seven hundred twenty-nine **cultivations**.
**Matters** of **kindred**—
**Celebration** or **calamity**—
This is **abundant surplus**,
And **cultivation** receives it as **seed**,
**Auspiciousness** and **malevolence** flourish.

**Mystic interweaving**—
**Centrality** begins **cyclical motion**,
**Excess** curves **resolute uprightness**.

**Fragmented** and **ornate** **ways**—
Sometimes **pure**, sometimes **variegated**.

**Centrality** and **cyclical motion**—**Dao/Way and virtue**,
**Excess** and **resolute uprightness**—**timely affairs**.

**Centrality** generates **Dao/Way**,
**Cyclical motion** returns **virtue**.

**Excess**—**confused by cyclical motion**,
**Resolute uprightness**—**guarding centrality’s exterior**.

**Uprightness** produces **vigilance**,
**Curvature** produces **ornateness**.

**Strength**—**vigorous**,
**Weakness**—**frail**.

Sometimes *ruǎn* (傒) has *shì* (事) above it.

**Accumulation**—**many**,
**Scarcity**—**few**.

**Vision**—**to see**,
**Obscurity**—**to be blind**.

**Youth**—**without knowledge**,
**Flourishing**—**with surplus**#4.

**Departure** leaves the **old**,
Yet **the new** is **approaching**.

**Youth’s ignorance**,
Like **vision** amid **blindness**,
Though sometimes **obscured**,
**Vision** remains within.

To **make clear and bright**,
Simply **unfurl it**.

**Flourishing with surplus**,
Reverses to **scarcity**.

**Frailty with weakness**,
**Scarcity without accumulation**—
This is the **mask of scarcity**,
Yet **not yet departed from unity**.

**Departure** leaves the **old** while **the new** approaches—
**Learning’s support**.

**Great**—**external**,
**Contracted**—**internal**.

**Advance**—**progress**,
**Retreat**—**withdrawal**.

**Joy**—**idleness and ease**#5;
Ancient *dàng* (荡) as *tì* (逖).

**Labor**—**stumbling and struggling**.

**Perception**—**thoughts harmonized**;
**Exhaustion**—**thoughts strained**.

Song translates **Perception** as *sī* (思) **harmonized**,
**Exhaustion**—*sī* (思) **strained**.

**Morning qi** is **sharp** and **active**,
**Evening qi** **returns to ease** and **internal repose**.

Scholars translate **qi** as *xí* (席),
Lin as *xì* (夕).

**Self-loathing**—**difference**;
**Self-adornment**—**ornament**.

**Difference**—**internal discord** is **evil**,
**Ornament**—**external display** is **beauty**.

**Rectification** does not **tolerate**,
Yet **Kun** is **broad and yielding**.

**Increasing days** **benefit**,
**Decreasing days** **harm**.

**Submission**—**obeying orders**,
**Rebellion**—**contradicting**.

**Relaxation**—**gentleness**,
Yet **rigidity**—**unyielding**.

**Rigidity** like **leather soles**,
**Loses gentleness and harmony**.

**Sound** ascends—
**Leather soles** belong to **ascension**.

Huang translates as *yǐn* ().

**Levelness and ease**—**simple**,
Yet **hardship**—**obstructed and stubborn**.

---
#3: *Chéng* (成) – *Completion/fulfillment*
#4: *Shèng ér yǒu yú* (盛而有余) – *Abundant and overflowing*
#5: *Yì* (佚) – *Idleness/ease*; *Dì* (逖) – *Ease/comfort*
#6: *Yì* (佚) – *Idleness/ease*; *Dì* (逖) – *Ease/comfort*
#7: *Yì yì* (佚逖) – *Idleness and ease* (repeated for emphasis)

**Cutting through doubts** yet lingering in uncertainty—
**Flee**, there is **avoidance**; **contend**, there is **interest**.
**Advance**, **desire**—*Huang* reads *yǔ* (迂).
**Stop**, **desire**—*Huang* reads *zhì* (鸷).

**Advance** not **straight**—**harm** ensues,
**Stop** not **sharp**—**clarity** is lost.

Thus the **virtuous** in **advancing** find **ease**—
The **Dao** stretches far;
In **stopping**, they are **stern**—
**Virtue** stands **victorious**.

**Vastness**—**boundless**,
**Endeavor**—**unconflicted**.

**Respond** to the **present**,
**Measure** by the **ancient**.

**Respond** and **follow** the times—
Only what **now** suits;
**Measure** by **patterns**—
**Ancient** ways suffice.

**Greet**—**knowing** what comes **before**,
**Endure**—**seeing** what comes **after**.

**Follow**—**dragged along**,
**Hold**—**steadfast**.

**Struggle**—**extracting** from **difficulty**,
**Severity**—**no** **mercy**.

When **subtle yang** first stirs,
Even in **deepest yin**, it **extracts** from **difficulty**.
When **pure yin** **severs** **yang**,
Its **end** is **unforgiving**.

**Tang**—**vast and open**—
Yet **secluded** and **obstructed**.

**Renew**—**crafting** anew;
**Constant**—**relying** on the **old**.

**Loss**—**great** **ruin**;
**Retreat**—**small** **gain**.

**Kitchen**—**loves** **profit**;
**Law**—**hates** **harshness**.

**Ritual**—**comprehensive**,
Yet **dwelling**—**confined**.

**Gather**—**empty** **endeavors**;
**Multiply**—**solid** **achievements**.

**Gather** by **yin’s** **withdrawal**—
Thus its **endeavors** are **empty**;
**Multiply** by **yang’s** **spread**—
Thus its **achievements** are **solid**.

**Empty**—**easily** **consumed**,
**Solid**—**hard** to **overcome**.

The **Ode** of **King Wu** proclaims:
*"Truly, you are the **just** and **faithful** teacher."*
This is **solid** **multitude**.

Receiving **armies** from **Muye’s** **camp**,
**Deer Terrace’s** **wealth**,
**Jiuqiao’s** **grain**—
These are **empty** **gatherings**.

**All** **unite** the **two**,
Yet **secrecy** **fulfills** the **one**.
**Two**—**human** **affiliation**;
**One**—**Heaven’s** **pure** **essence**.

Ten thousand things **take form**,
Their **secrecy** **unbroken**—
All **manifest** therein.

**High**—**aspiring** **mind**,
**Low**—**humble** **mind**.

**Sociable**—**many** **friends**,
**Reserved**—**few** **associates**.

**Sharp**—**slanderous**,
**Blind**—**hesitant**.

*Slander*—*Song* reads *zàn* (谗).
*Hesitant*—*Zǔ* (剪) *gǎn* (跙).
*Gǎn*—*Cǎi* (才) *yǔ* (与) **cut**.

Ancient scholars say:
*Slanderous* and *hesitant*—
**Movement** **stagnates**.

With **blindness** **foresight**,
Thus its **steps** are so.

**Near**—**clinging** to **distant**,
**Sever**—**drawing** **blood**.

**Encounter**—**meeting** **difficulty**,
**Prepare**—**waiting** for **opportunity**.

**Exert**—**self** **exhausted**,
**Nurture**—**self** **sustained**.

**Completion**—**labor** **finished**,
**Unchangeable**.

*Fan Wang*’s *Xuan* [*Error*] ends with:
**Confrontation**—**contrary**,
Yet **Kun**—**harmonious**.
**Increase**—**benefit**,
**Decrease**—**loss**.

**Completion**—**labor** **finished**,
**Unchangeable**.

*Song Zhong* supplements these.
Yet some say *Lu Ji* originally had **Completion** first,
Now cross-referencing the *Secret Treasury*’s *Lu* text—
**None** exist.
Recently, *Song Weiguan* obtained an ancient text,
Also missing these five stanzas.
Yet today’s text again has:
**Confrontation**—**unendurable**,
Yet **Kun**—**broad and yielding**.
**Increasing days** **benefit**,
**Decreasing days** **harm**—
**Unknown** whence derived.

Thus alone deleting *Song Zhong*’s four supplements,
The rest **doubtful**—
**Dare not** remove,
Awaiting scholars’ **investigation**.

**Mysterious**—*zhān* (摛), **expanding**—
**Mysterious**—**penetrating** ten thousand forms **unseen**.
**Nurtured** by **emptiness** yet **born** of **principles**—
**Divine** and **settled**.

**Uniting** ancient and modern to **open** **categories**,
**Expanding** **yin-yang** to **release** **qi**.

**Separate** and **unite**—
**Heaven** and **Earth** **complete**.
**Heaven** **revolves**, **yang** and **yin** **interact**.
**Return** to **origin**—
**Beginning** and **end** **settled**.

**One** **birth**, **one** **death**—
**Nature** and **life** **refined**.

**Heaven** **divides** **yang** **above**,
Thus **sun**, **moon**, **Five Stars** **adorn** it—
All **yin** **within**.

**Gazing** upward to **patterns**,
**Gazing** downward to **emotions**.
**Discerning** **nature**, **knowing** **fate**,
**Tracing** **origins**, **seeing** **ends**.

**Three** **Principles**—**shared** **nature**,
**Thick** and **thin** **contrasting**.

**Round**—**sturdy** and **flexible**,
**Square**—**stingy** and **parsimonious**.

**Exhale**—**fluid** **form**,
**Inhale**—**doubtful** **shape**.

Thus **enclosing** **Heaven** is called **Space**,
**Opening** **Space** is called **Duration**.
**Enclosing** **Heaven**—**Space**;
**Opening** **Space**—**Duration**.

**One** **yang**, **one** **yin**—
**Heaven’s** and **Earth’s** **transformation**.
**Sun** and **moon** **passing**—
**One** **cold**, **one** **hot**.

**Music** **forms** **things**,
**Calendars** **record** **time**.
**Music** and **calendars** **intertwine**—
**Sages** **plan** thereby.

**Day**—**cherished**,
**Night**—**despised**.

**One** **day**, **one** **night**—
**Yin** and **yang** **distinguished**.

**Night**—**extreme** **yin**,
**Day**—**extreme** **yang**.

**Female**, **male**, **pure**—
**Expanding** **auspicious** and **inauspicious**.

Thus **sovereign**, **minister**, **father**, **son**,
**husband**, **wife**—**distinguished**.

Hence **sun** **moves** **eastward**,
**Heaven** **moves** **westward**.
**Heaven** and **sun** **interweave**,
**Yin** and **yang** **cycle**.

**Death** and **life** **entangled**—
**Ten thousand things** **ensnared**.

Thus **Mysterious** **gathers** **Heaven’s** **unified** **connections**.
**Connections**—*Zhang* and *Lin* read *yùn* (运).
**Linking** by **kindred**,
**Divining** by **patterns**.

**Illuminating** **Heaven’s** **dazzling** **clarity**,
**Refining** **Heaven’s** **obscure** **depths**—
**Only** the **Mysterious** does so.

*Obscure*—*Shìwén* reads *wǔ* (膴), **dim**.
Now only **lower** *bié* reads *wǔwǔ*,
Others read *huìhuì*.

**Mysterious**—
**Obscuring** its **position**, **blurring** its **boundaries**,
**Deepening** its **mounds**, **fading** its **roots**,
**Displaying** its **achievements**, **concealing** its **means**.

Thus **Mysterious** **stands** **distant** before **all**,
**Vast** and **expansive**,
**Deep** and **profound**,
**Faint** and **vanishing**.

**Harmonizing** all—**Mysterious**.

**It is humanity that scatters** **it**—
**Knocking at its gate**, **opening its doors**, **striking its keys**—
**Only then does it respond**.
**How much less** when it **denies**?

**For those who cultivate the Mysterious**—
**Knocking at its outer gate**, **no response**.
**Opening its inner doors**, **no response**.
**Striking its keys in secret**, **only then does it respond**.
**How much less** for those who **do not cultivate**?

**Entering ever deeper**, **seeking ever more sparsely**—
**Then the Mysterious responds**.
**Not that the Mysterious responds to seeking**,
**But that the utmost refinement communicates**.

What **humans** **desire yet lack** is **virtue**;
What **humans** **abhor yet possess in excess** is **vice**.
The **Noble One**, **strengthening what is lacking**,
**Diminishing what is in excess**—
**Thus approaches the Dao of the Mysterious**.

**Gazing upward**, it **resides above**;
**Gazing downward**, it **peeks below**;
**Straining forward**, it **lies ahead**;
**Turning back**, it **vanishes behind**.
**Attempting to evade it is impossible**—
**Silently attaining its place**—
**This is the Mysterious**.

**Daily strengthening virtue** while **diminishing vice**,
**To perfect virtue and instrumentality**—
**That is all**.

**If the Mysterious**, then **await its silent accord**.
**Approaching the Dao**,
**What is lacking is filled and flourishes**,
**What is in excess is removed and does not obscure**—
**Thus entering the Mysterious’ equilibrium**.

**Therefore, the Mysterious**—
**Its use is consummate**.

**Seeing and knowing**—**this is wisdom**;
**Gazing and loving**—**this is benevolence**;
**Judging and deciding**—**this is courage**;
**Encompassing and applying broadly**—**this is fairness**;
**Able to pair with all things**—**this is harmony**;
**Unbound by attachments**—**this is sagacity**;
**Timing and untiming**—**this is fate**.

**The Void Form**—
**The Way through which ten thousand things pass**—
**Is called the Way**.

**The Void Form**—*Zhang* and *Ding* read *xūwúxíng*,
*Song*, *Lin*, *Xu*, and *Huang* read *xūwúxíng*.
**The Way through which**—*Song* reads *tōng*.
**Is called the Way**—*Song* and *Xu*, *Huang* originally include *zhī* ("that"),
*Zhang* and *Ding* omit it.

**Following without revolution**—
**The principles of the world attained**—
**Is called virtue**.

**Following without revolution**—*Lin* reads *yīnyuán*.
**Principles generate clusters**—*Ding* and *Song* read *hún*.
**Encompassing love**—**this is benevolence**.

**Ranking and measuring** **appropriateness**—
**This is righteousness**.

**Upholding virtue, benevolence, and righteousness** **and applying them**—
**This is achievement**.

**Illuminating Heaven’s function**, **clarifying all things**—
**This is Yang**.

**Obscuring the Formless**, **deep beyond measure**—
**This is Yin**.

**Yang knows Yang but not Yin**,
**Yin knows Yin but not Yang**.
**Knowing Yin and knowing Yang**,
**Knowing cessation and knowing action**,
**Knowing obscurity and knowing clarity**—
**Who but the Mysterious?**

**From obscurity, unfolding all kinds**,
**To clarity, illuminating the world**—
**This is the Mysterious’ technique**.

**From obscurity, deep and faint**,
**To knowing Yin and knowing Yang**—
**This is the Mysterious’ Dao**.

**In the Mysterious**,
**Seeing and knowing**,
**Gazing and loving**,
**Judging and deciding**,
**Encompassing and applying broadly**,
**Able to pair with all things**,
**Unbound by attachments**—
**Then timing and untiming govern the states**,
**And one acts throughout the world**,
**Upholding virtue, benevolence, and righteousness** **in achievement**,
**Aligning with the August Heaven**.

**Measuring it**—**this is balance**;
**Leveling it**—**this is equilibrium**.

**Making the turbid clear**, **the perilous level**—
**Detached from sincerity**, **it must cling to deceit**;
**Detached from deceit**, **it must cling to sincerity**.
**Sincerity and deceit clash**—
**Then the Dao of the Noble and the petty man is clearly distinguished**.

**The Mysterious**—
**It balances and measures**.

**The high it lowers**, **the low it raises**,
**The abundant it takes from**, **the empty it gives to**.
**The clear it confirms**, **the doubtful it raises**.

**Planning it**—**this is thought**;
**Establishing it**—**this is action**;
**Persuading it**—**this is eloquence**;
**Completing it**—**this is trust**.

**Speaking of the Mysterious’ rectitude**,
**Exceeding human affairs**—**thus**.

**Heaven**—
**Vastly displaying its divine mystery**;
**Earth**—
**Stably displaying its clarity**.

**Heaven and Earth** **fix their stations**,
**Divine and bright qi communicate**—
**One, two, three**.

**Positions each distinct in rank**,
**Circulating through the Nine Regions**,
**Beginning and end continuously linked**,
**Above and below without corners**.

**Examining the patterns of Dragon and Tiger**,
**Observing the principles of Bird and Tortoise**—
**Applying them to governance**,
**Striking at the *Tai*’s beginning and end**,
**To harmonize the *Xuanji*’s order**,
**And rectify the *Yùhéng*’s equilibrium**.

**Square and round** **grinding each other**,
**Hard and soft** **interacting**.

**When full, it enters decay**,
**When exhausted, it renews**.
**Having substance, having emptiness**,
**Flow and cessation without constancy**.

**Speaking of the Mysterious’ alignment with the Seven Governors**,
**To mirror Heaven and Earth**—**thus**.

**Heaven and Earth established**,
**Thus nobility and humility are ordered**.
**The Four Seasons progress**,
**Thus parent and child succeed**.
**Calendars and measures are set forth**,
**Thus ruler and subject are rightly aligned**.
**Constant and variable intertwine**,
**Thus all affairs are distinguished**.
**Substance and form manifest**,
**Thus presence and absence are clear**.
**Auspicious and inauspicious appear**,
**Thus good and evil are evident**.
**Void and substance surge**,
**Thus all things are entangled**.
**Yang not reaching its extreme, Yin does not sprout**,
**Yin not reaching its extreme, Yang does not emerge**.
**Extreme cold generates heat**, **extreme heat generates cold**.
**Trusting the Dao leads to bending**,
**Bending the Dao leads to trust**.

**In its motion**, **daily creating what is not**,
**And delighting in what is new**.
**In its stillness**, **daily diminishing what is done**,
**And reducing what is accomplished**.

**Thus probing with the *kè*** (刻),
**Comparing with the *guǐ*** (晷),
**Reversing its sequence**,
**Turning its Way**—
**To reveal the unseen Form**,
**To draw the unspun thread**,
**And connect with all kinds**.

**Above, it suspends Heaven**,
**Below, it sinks into the abyss**,
**Fine, it enters the reeds** (秽),
**Broad, it encompasses the *zhěn*** (轸).

**Its Dao**—**obscure and deep**—
**Fills what is full**—*Ding* and *Song* read *yāyíng*.

**Preserving while perishing**,
**Faint yet manifest**,
**Beginning while ending**—
**Near the Mysterious, the Mysterious draws near**;
**Far from the Mysterious, the Mysterious withdraws**.

**Like Heaven, vast and blue**,
**Present in the east, south, west, and north**,
**Gazing upward, none are absent**,
**Yet when lowered, it is unseen**.
**Does Heaven truly depart from humanity?**
**It is humanity that departs from it**.

**The Winter Solstice and the hours after midnight**—
**Symbols of nearing the Mysterious**.

**Advancing yet unexhausted**,
**Going yet unreached**,
**Empty yet unfilled**—
**Thus called nearing the Mysterious**.

「The Summer Solstice and the hours after midday—
**Symbols of withdrawing from the Mysterious**.

Advancing to its utmost and then receding,
Proceeding to exhaustion and then returning,
Filled to capacity and then diminished—
Thus called withdrawing from the Mysterious.

When the sun turns southward, all things die;
When the sun turns northward, all things live.

When the Dipper** (斗) turns northward, all things grow **empty** (虚);
When the Dipper turns southward, all things grow **full** (盈).
The sun’s southern turn—
**Rightward in motion, leftward in return**;
The Dipper’s southern turn—
**Leftward in motion, rightward in return**.

Sometimes left, sometimes right,
Sometimes death, sometimes life—
**The Mysterious and the numinous** conspire together,
**Heaven and Earth** thus align,
**Heaven’s numinous** and **Earth’s spirit** (灵).

**The Mysterious Dao** is such—
Thus, through human affairs and transformations of things,
It **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**,
**Unified without division**,
And the Mysterious stands as its **apex** (宗).

On the Summer Solstice, the sun reaches its southernmost point at **Eastern Well** (东井);
On the Winter Solstice, the sun reaches its northernmost point at **The Ox Driver** (牵牛).
The Dipper **governs the four seasons**,
Each establishing its own direction.
The sun **traverses the western sky and returns eastward**,
The Dipper **reaches the eastern sky and returns westward**.

All things depend upon it—
When full, the signs of death appear;
When empty, new life emerges.
The Mysterious **scatters as one yin and one yang**,
Its **movements**—left and right—**meet in opposition**.
Thus, it **unifies the Mysterious and the numinous**,
And **returns to the primal wholeness of the Mysterious**.

It is said, **"Heaven’s numinous and Earth’s spirit"**,
Meaning **unified yet not chaotic**,
**The Mysterious** **illuminates** **Heaven and Earth’s transformations**,
**Encompassing all without obstruction**.

(In some texts, *zhāng* and *dīng* read *wàng* instead of *nèi*.)
**The beginning and the end**—**profound and luminous**—
**Exalt the Mysterious and the numinous**,
**The Great Yang** **rides upon the yin**,
All things **comprehensively included**,
**Circulating through the Nine Voids** (九虚),
And **weaving fate and fortune** (祸福).

In the **twelve beginnings** (十二始),
All affairs **unravel their threads**,
Thus there are **one, two, three**,
To **weave and measure** (絓罗),
And the Mysterious Dao **illuminates** them.

**The Five Phases** (五行) **originate from the Dipper**,
With **nine positions** **repeatedly applied** (重施).
Above and below **interact in sequence**,
And **the Ugly** (丑) **lies within**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Heaven’s Garden** (天园) **spreads across the four directions**,
**Central Planting** (极植) **established at the heart**,
**Movement governed by stillness** (动以历静),
**Time measured in twelve**,
To **found the Seven Celestial Officials** (七政)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

The Dipper **shakes Heaven and advances**,
The sun **defies Heaven and retreats**,
Sometimes **shaken**, sometimes **defiant**—
To **establish the Five Epochs** (五纪)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Planting and measuring** (植表) **cast their shadows** (施景),
**Willow and Mulberry** (榆与株) **marked by their cuts** (切).

**The water clock’s rate** (漏率) **is measured by the gnomon** (刻),
**Dusk and dawn** (昏明) **are gauged at the midpoint** (考中),
The **observers use the gnomon** (以戒)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Cold bamboo** (冷竹) **as the tube** (管),
**Ash from the hearth** (室灰) **as the marker** (候),
To **investigate all undertakings** (揆百度).
When the **undertakings are set**,
The **people are aided without delay**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**East and west as the weft** (纬),
**South and north as the warp** (经),
**Warp and weft intersecting**,
**Distinguishing perverse and orthodox** (邪正),
**Revealing auspicious and inauspicious** (吉凶)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Digging wells** (凿井) **to draw clear water** (澹水),
**Boring fire** (钻火) **and carving wood** (难木),
**Melting metal and molding clay** (流金陶土),
To **blend the Five Refined Arts** (五美).
The **resources of the Five Refined Arts**,
To **nourish all bodies** (资百体)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Odd numbers** (奇) **measure yang**,
**Even numbers** (耦) **measure yin**,
**Odd and even** **pushed and performed**,
To **calculate all under Heaven**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**Six beginnings** (六始) **as the laws** (律),
**Six intervals** (六间) **as the harmonics** (吕),
When **laws and harmonics** are **coordinated**,
The **twelve** are **tuned**,
And **daytime and nighttime** are **measured**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**The Eighty-One Divisions** (八十一所) **of the states and families**,
**Marked as lower, middle, and upper**,
To **represent the Four Seas**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

**One division** (一辟),
**Three ministers** (三公),
**Nine officials** (九卿),
**Twenty-seven great officers** (二十七大夫),
**Eighty-one elemental officials** (八十一元士)—
**Few govern the many**,
**None govern the nonexistent**—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

In ancient times, **there were no thunder sacrifices** (不霆) **nor divinations** (不虞),
(In some texts, *lèi* is read *yú* instead of *pèi*—
Sound: *yú*, others read *lèi*.)
**Slowing their contemplations** (慎其思虑),
**Not relying on fortune-telling or augury** (匪筮匪卜),
When **auspicious and inauspicious** **intermingled**,
The **sages** then **crafted the Yarrow Stalk and tortoise shell**,
**Piercing the essence** (钻精) **and leaning upon the spirit** (倚神),
**Clasping knowledge** (箝知) **of rest and auspice** (休咎)—
The Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.

Thus, to **know what is unknowable**,
One **approximates it through the trigrams and hexagrams** (卦兆),
To **fathom depths and trace distances**,
One **seeks it through contemplation** (思虑).
Of these two, which **establishes the essence**?
The **essence** in **fortune-telling and divination**,
**The spirit moves its changes**;
The **essence** in **contemplation**,
**Plans align with their fittingness**;
The **essence** in **upright establishment**,
**None can overthrow it**;
The **essence** in **having what is guarded**,
**None can seize it**.
Thus, to **unravel the tangled threads** (抽天下之蔓蔓)
And **dispel the chaotic mixtures** (散天下之混混)
Under Heaven—
Who but the **essence** could accomplish this?

**Illuminating from self-measurement** (莹自度数),
**Radiant in all methods** (晖於诸法),
And **chiefly relying on the utmost precision** (至精者),
It **returns to the One**.

The **observers**,
**Value adherence to natural patterns** (循) **and embodying spontaneity** (体自然).
When their **adherence is vast**,
Then their **embodiment is robust** (壮);
When their **adherence is slight**,
Then their **embodiment is meager** (瘠).
When their **adherence is straight**,
Then their **embodiment is complete** (浑);
When their **adherence is crooked**,
Then their **embodiment is scattered** (散).
Thus, they **do not fear what they possess**,
Nor **force what they lack**.
Like the **body itself**,
**Adding causes excess** (赘),
**Removing causes deficiency** (亏).
Thus, **substance is guided by nature** (质斡),
**Embellishment by human affairs** (华藻)—
Can it be **augmented or diminished**?

(The original reads: *"华藻在乎人事也，其可损益与？"*
Some texts omit *人事*, reading instead: *"华藻其作其字"*—
The **allowance** and **yellowing** **are as they are**.)

The **One** is **used to trace beginnings** (摹始)
And **measure depths** (测深),
The **three threes** (三三) **to exhaust endings** (尽终)
And **reach the utmost heights** (极崇),
The **two twos** (二二) **to align affairs** (参事)
And **grasp the central way** (要中).
**Human affairs mirror this**,
**Dedicating to its work** (务其事)
**Not its words** (不务其辞),
**Multiplying its changes** (多其变)
**Not its forms** (不多其文).

**Without coordination**, its **intentions are unclear** (其指不详),
**Without centrality**, its **responses are narrow** (其应不博),
**Without completeness**, its **work is confined** (其事不散),
**Without depth**, its **meaning is unseen** (其意不见).
Thus, **forms reveal the substance** (文以见乎质),
**Words reveal the emotions** (辞以睹乎情).
By **observing its application of words**,
One **sees what its heart desires**.

Such are the **words of the Mysterious Dao**.
**Exalting the Nine Degrees** (九度):
**One-One** (一一),
**One-Two** (一二),
**One-One-Two** (一一二),
**Two-One** (二一),
**Two-Two** (二二),
**Two-Three** (二三),
**Three-One** (三一),
**Three-Two** (三二),
**Three-Three** (三三).

**One-One** is the **beginning**; **Three-Three**, the **apex**; **Two-Two**, the **center**.
This is the **unalterable natural measure**—
a model for **divination’s calculations**.

The **Dao** has **roots and continuity**, **transformation and change**.
Following roots and continuity—**harmony with the Dao’s spirit**;
Transforming and changing—**adapting to the times**.
Thus, **rooted yet transformative**, the **Heavenly Dao is realized**;
**Transformative yet rooted**, the **Heavenly Dao is tamed**.

Things **do not arise without roots**, nor **fulfill without transformation**.
Thus, **knowing roots but not transformation**, things **lose their standard**;
**Knowing transformation but not roots**, things **lose their balance**.
Transformation **untimely**, things **lose their foundation**;
Roots **unprincipled**, things **lose their order**.

**Rooting and transforming**—
the **measures of statecraft**.
The **movement of measures**—
the **effects of success and failure**.

**Adaptability**—
the **mysteries of the Dao**.

Roots **mirror water and wood**,
Transformation **mirrors metal and fire**.

Establishing **Heaven’s threads**—
**Yin and Yang** are called;
Shaping **Earth’s weaves**—
**Compliance and Resistance** are called;
Manifesting **human conduct**—
**Obscurity and Clarity** are called.

**Yin and Yang**—**uniting their distinctions**;
**Compliance and Resistance**—**weaving the threads**;
**Obscurity and Clarity**—**discriminating their essence**.

Yin without Yang—**no union in application**;
Threads without weaves—**no fulfillment in meaning**;
Clarity without Obscurity—**no distinction in virtue**.

**Yin and Yang**—**to draw forth emotions**;
**Compliance and Resistance**—**to refine principles**;
**Obscurity and Clarity**—**to illuminate affairs**.

**Drawing emotions**—**the refined Dao**;
**Refining principles**—**the illuminated conduct**;
**Illuminating affairs**—**the path of the virtuous**.

**Opening to its name**—
the **mysteries’ speech**.

From the **center as Yang**, encircling as **Yin**,
to **extreme the eighty-one heads**.

Nine positions at the **center**,
threads and weaves intersecting—
things **manifest their meaning** as they encounter time.

**Obscurity and Clarity**—
the **matters of day and night**.

**Coming and going**, **permeating**—
entering the **Gate of Loss**.

**What is gained and what is lost**—
**gaining blessings, losing calamities**.

Heaven and Earth:
**Blessings align**, calamities **reverse**;
Mountains and rivers:
**Blessings settle low**, calamities **rise high**;
Human conduct:
**Blessings are upright**, calamities **are perverse**.

Thus, the **virtuous**—
**internally upright, externally tamed**,
**always yielding to others**—
therefore **their actions gain blessings and avoid calamities**.

Blessings **do not arise from ugliness**,
calamities **do not persist from goodness**.
**Ugliness and goodness**—
the **virtuous thus clearly distinguish**.

Blessings **end in joy**, calamities **begin in sorrow**.
What Heaven and Earth **value** is called **blessing**;
what **ghosts and spirits** **favor** is called **blessing**;
what **human conduct** **delights in** is called **blessing**;
what they **despise and abhor**—all are called **calamity**.

Thus, the **more one despises blessings**, the **greater the calamity**.
The **calamities of daytime** are few—**pure in clarity**;
the **calamities of night** are many—**pure in obscurity**.
Those **scattered between day and night**—
their **calamities and blessings mix**,
for they are **neither purely obscure nor purely clear**.

**Refining to illuminate affairs**—
to make people **know the return of calamities and blessings**.

**太玄数卷第八 玄数**

**Kunlun**—**Heaven and Earth’s birthplace**—**produces the stalks**,
**three sacred essences** **refined**—**to number**.

Dispersing the **mysterious in three layers** to establish **families**,
**comparing the Two Principles** to **perceive affairs**.

**Encounters and unions**—
**naming their patterns** and **extending their command**.

**Precision**—**the threads of doubt**—**its substance revealed**.
**The Oracle says**: *"Assume the Great Mysteries"*.

**Assuming the Great Mysteries**—**truth and sincerity**,
**doubting the substance**—**divine and spirit-like**.

**Rest**—**encountering Yang**, stars and times **align in speech**;
**Blame**—**encountering Yin**, stars and times **contradict in speech**.

**Divination has its Dao**:
**Without precision, do not divinate**,
**without doubt, do not divinate**,
**without order, do not divinate**,
**without its omens, do not divinate as if divining**.

**Divine brilliance**—**soaring beyond** (three characters repeated).
**Thirty-six**—**the stalks are viewed**.

Heaven **divides by three**, completing **six**—
thus **eighteen stalks**.

Heaven **does not act alone**, Earth **does not complete alone**—
**doubling their roots**, Earth **lacks three** to **match Heaven’s eighteen**.

**Separate one** and hang it **on the left small finger**,
**dividing the rest in half**.

With three stalks gathered, the remainder is grouped under **艻** [same as *扐*].
After one **艻**, recount the rest in sevens—seven as one, eight as two, nine as three—
thus six counts exhaust the **stalks’ Dao**.

**Encountering** has **lower, middle, upper**:
Lower is **thought**,
Middle is **fortune**,
Upper is **calamity**.
Thought, fortune, and calamity each have lower, middle, upper—
by day and night, their **rest and blame** are distinguished.

Heaven divides by three, thus one, two, three **weave into six**.
Multiply six by three to make **eighteen**.
Heaven acts, Earth completes it—
thus doubled, they form **thirty-six**.
This is the **divine brilliance**—**soaring beyond** (three characters repeated).

Earth lacks three to match Heaven’s eighteen—
thus the stalks use **thirty-three**.

The **Mysterious Divination** hangs one stalk—**most precise**;
dividing and gathering three times—**most variable**;
grouping the remainder under **艻**—**returning to the odd**.

After one **艻**, recounting the rest yields seven, eight, or nine—
thus day’s one, two, three.

Heaven completes six, so six counts exhaust the **stalks’ Dao**—
numbers reach their limit, symbols find their fullness.

Obtain **direction**, seek **province**, obtain **department**, seek **house**—
this is **dispersing the obscure through three layers** and establishing **house**—**fourfold**.

Extreme one becomes two, extreme two becomes three, extreme three becomes **推** [*tuī*],
**推** three becomes **嬴赞** [*yíngzàn*].
*Chapter, Xu*, and *Ding* variants read **推** three as **赢赞**—
*嬴* or *赢* are interchangeable.
*赞嬴* enters **表**, *表嬴* enters **家**, *家嬴* enters **部**, *部嬴* enters **州**, *州嬴* enters **方**.
*Fàn Zhǔ* notes: *玄* may be *去* [omitted].
*Lù Yún* says: Should read *玄*.
Now all versions read *玄*, except *Sòng* as *去*, *Chapter* as *入玄*.
Numbers arise from *玄*, extend to extremes, then return to *玄*.
This is how the Sage harmonizes the people’s **fortune and calamity**,
washing the heart in secrecy—
thus interspersed within the **divination method**.

In ancient times, **Yú** divided the nine provinces,
assigned tributes by soil, and bestowed upon **Yáo** the **black jade tablet**,
declaring his success—
symbolizing this very principle.

**One follows, two follow, three follow**—**Great Rest**.
**One follows, two follow, three contradict**—
beginning and middle **Rest**, ending in **blame**.
**One follows, two contradict, three contradict**—
beginning **Rest**, middle and end **blame**.
**One contradicts, two follow, three follow**—
beginning **blame**, middle and end **Rest**.
**One contradicts, two contradict, three follow**—
beginning and middle **blame**, ending in **Rest**.
**One contradicts, two contradict, three contradict**—**Great Blame**.

Divination has four aspects: **stars, times, numbers, speech**.
Morning uses **classics**, evening uses **weft**.
Observe beginning and middle, decide by the end.
Day signifies **Rest**, night signifies **blame**.
And by **stars, times, numbers, speech**—
harmony or contradiction,盛衰—
their categories align to determine the matter.

Morning uses **classics**: one, five, seven;
Evening uses **weft**: three, four, eight;
Morning and evening combined: two **classics**, one **weft**, using two, six, nine—
this is the **three tables**.
Morning symbolizes **Heaven**, evening **Earth**, the middle **Human**.

One, five, six advance to **seven**,
Three, four, seven advance to **eight**,
Two, six, eight advance to **nine**.
Observing beginning and middle, deciding by the end—
examining accumulated extremes and grasping their changes.

Thus the remaining **艻** numbers:
One portends **seven**, three portends **eight**, two portends **nine**.

Divination may yield **ending Rest but reversing blame**,
or **ending blame but reversing Rest**—
it depends on carefully observing the questioned matter,
cross-referencing with **stars, times, numbers**.

If not a matter of **loyalty and sincerity**, fortune may shift to misfortune—
this is the **divination law**.

**Three eights** are **Wood**, the **East**, **Spring**.
Days: **Jia, Yi**; hours: **Yín, Mǎo**.
Sound: **Jué (角)**, color: **green**, taste: **sour**, odor: **rancid**, form: **bent and trustworthy**.
Generates **Fire**, overcomes **Earth**.
Seasonally generates, stores in the **spleen**.
The **lung** extends upward to cover the **kidney**,
descends low to conceal the **heart**,
resides centrally to embody **sovereign virtue**,
while **spleen (left)** and **liver (right)** support the **Five Phases** in position.

*The Monthly Ordinances* decree:
Spring sacrifices to the **spleen**, summer to the **lung**,
Central (autumn?) sacrifices to the **heart**, autumn to the **liver**,
Winter to the **kidney**—
this is the **Mysterious Correspondence**.

Thus the **lung** stores **qi**—**Fire**;
the **kidney** stores **essence**—**Water**;
the **heart** stores **spirit**—**Earth**;
the **spleen** stores **thought**—**Wood**;
the **liver** stores **blood**—**Metal**.

As **bodies**, they are:
**Spleen (Earth)**, **Lung (Metal)**, **Heart (Fire)**, **Liver (Wood)**, **Kidney (Water)**;
As **positions**, they **nourish and govern**, **minister and domesticate**.

Not aligning with others—**one alone**—
the **Mysterious Virtue’s** symbol.

**Preserve intent (志)**, **preserve sound (音)** [or *store*].
Wood preserves **intent**—**uprightness**;
Metal preserves **ether (魄)**—**campaigning**;
Fire preserves **soul (魂)**—**transformation**;
Water preserves **essence**—**concealment**;
Earth preserves **spirit**—**transmutation**.
**Intent** is **Water**, yet stored in **Wood**;
**Ether** is **Earth**, yet stored in **Metal**;
**Soul** is **Wood**, yet stored in **Fire**;
**Spirit** is **Fire**, yet stored in **Earth**.
All entrust themselves to their **generative source**.

As *Laozi* says:
*"Weaken the intent, strengthen the bones,
empty the heart, fill the belly."*
Only the **perfectly unified** remain undivided.

**Nature** is **benevolence**, **emotion** is **joy**.
**Affairs** appear **proper**, **conduct** is **reverent**,
**solemn**, **austere**, **drought**.
*The Hong Fan* records:
*"Rain and drought follow weft,
heat and cold, wind follow classics."*

**Mysterious numbers** classify by their **true names** alone—
not by **clashing qi** intermingling.

**Emperor Tàiwú**, **God Gōumáng**—
**stars** follow their positions.
**Shì, Fáng, Xīn, Wěi, Jī**—
positions **Yín, Mǎo**.
Their **categories** include:
**scales**, **thunder**, **drums**, **resounding sound**, **novelty**, **restlessness**, **door**, **window**.

「The **Tàixiàng** (甲象) scales as **lín** (鳞),
in orderly ranks, their abundance grows.
When pushed to their utmost, they **zhèn** (震) and transform into **léi** (雷)—thunder,
into **gǔ** (鼓)—drums,
into **huīshēng** (恢声)—resounding echoes.

Their emergence marks **xīn** (新)—novelty,
their obstruction yields **zào** (躁)—restlessness.
The grand becomes **hù** (户)—door, and exits,
the small becomes **yǒu** (牖)—window, and flows through.
All things:
to exit, they must pass through **hù** (户),
to enter, they must pass through **mén** (门).
**Hù** (户) is **odd** (奇),
**mén** (门) is **even** (偶).

The **zào** (灶) stove and **tì** (惕) hearth nurture by **liú** (流通)—circulation,
while the **zhōngliú** (中溜) central hearth
**chōng** (冲) and **xū** (虚) to clear the **hán** (函)—enclosure,
illuminating **tiān** (天)—Heaven,
and receiving all **liú** (流).
Thus, this **fú** (福)—blessing is gathered,
and the family master presides over it.

When doors and stoves open and close in change,
this is **wéi** (纬)—the **subtle, responsive** (纬) principle;
when the stove’s circulation and central hearth maintain constancy,
this is **jīng** (经)—the **fundamental, enduring** (经) principle.

Therefore, *The Yueling* (月令) states:
*"In spring, sacrifice to the **hù** (户)—door;
in summer, sacrifice to the **zào** (灶)—stove;
in the center, sacrifice to the **zhōngliú** (中溜)—central hearth;
in autumn, sacrifice to the **mén** (门)—gate;
in winter, sacrifice to the **xíng** (行)—circulation."*

Their **categories** (类) align with the **Wǔwù** (五物)—five elements,
harmonizing with the **Mysterious Numbers** (玄).
To **sì** (嗣)—inherit,
to **chéng** (承)—uphold,
to **yè** (叶)—follow,
to **xù** (绪)—continue.
**Zhèn** (震) as the **chángzǐ** (长子)—eldest son’s transformation.

To become **hù** (户) and **yǒu** (牖),
then the family is established.
To **shè** (赦)—pardon,
to **jiě** (解)—release,
and to bear **duōzǐ** (多子)—many offspring.
The **shuì** (税) of witheredness and the **jiè** (枯) of decay,
the **shì** (释) of shedding and the **jiǎ** (甲) of scales—
these are the **zhèn** (震) element’s functions,
mirrored in state affairs.

**Méngshēng** (萌生) sprouting and **yùnzì** (孕字) bearing—
the season’s bounty flourishes.
To **chū** (出)—emerge,
to **yǔ** (予)—bestow.
The **Emperor** (帝) emerges from **zhèn** (震),
spreading **virtue/power** (德) and **bestowing benevolence** (施惠),
while all things take form accordingly.
To **shè** (赦)—pardon and **jiě** (解)—release,
is to emerge and bestow.

To **zhú** (竹)—bamboo and **cǎo** (草)—grass,
to **guǒ** (果)—fruit and **shí** (实)—kernel.
**Xiùbá** (秀拔) refined and **pú** (拔) towering, they become **zhú** (竹)—bamboo;
**zīmàn** (滋蔓) spreading and **wàn** (蔓) creeping, they become **cǎo** (草)—grass.
**Shǒuliǎn** (首敛) concentrated at the head, they become **guǒ** (果)—fruit,
all **mùqì** (木气)—wood **qi**.
Fruit becomes **shí** (实)—kernel,
and the kernel’s form suggests rebirth.

To become **yú** (鱼)—fish:
water nurtures **línshǔ** (鳞属)—scaled creatures,
a symbol of **fánxī** (蕃息)—proliferation and growth.
From bamboo and grass to fish,
all belong to the **duōzǐ** (多子)—many offspring category.

To become **shūqì** (疏器)—perforated vessels.
*The Yueling* (月令) states:
*"In spring, their vessels are perforated to allow passage."*
**Kè** (刻) carved and **lòu** (镂) hollowed,
symbolizing the **tǔ** (土) element’s unrestricted emergence.
Perforated vessels **zhì** (致) harness human effort
to correspond with **tiānshí** (天时)—Heaven’s seasons.

To become **tián** (田)—field and **guī** (规)—boundary:
**Xǔ** (许) and **Huáng** (黄) as boundaries form fields,
**Sòng** (宋) and **Guō** (郭) as fields define boundaries.
**Mù** (木) governs **tǔ** (土).
To become **tián** (田)—field,
**mù** (木) takes charge, and the **jìguān** (稷官) officials expand their cultivation.
To become **guī** (规)—boundary,
it mirrors the **yuán** (元) principle’s **yùnmù** (运木)—circulation of wood.
**Tǔ** (土) rests upon the wood’s **jī** (稽)—foundation,
symbolizing the exertion of effort in spring
to harmonize with Heaven’s bounty.

To become **máo** (矛)—spear:
**Jùbīng** (句兵) weapons bend without piercing.
**Gēshì** (戈氏) **yīn** (罇) and **máoshì** (矛氏) **tuì** (镦).
The **máo** (矛) is **dūn** (敦)—thick, symbolizing **rén** (仁)—benevolence.
To become **qīngguài** (青怪)—strange and green:
**Zhèng** (正) governs the state,
**qí** (奇) is used in warfare.
When the **Wǔxíng** (五行)—five elements
**fǎncháng** (反常)—reverse their usual order,
each displays its **yì** (异)—unusual aspect.

To become **bì** (鼽)—nasal congestion:
**yīnqiú** (音求)—sound seeks resonance.
When **spring’s xíng** (行) overlaps with **autumn’s lìng** (令),
people suffer **bì** (鼽)—nasal congestion,
as **jīn** (金) **zhì** (沴) overcomes **mù** (木).
To become **kuáng** (狂)—madness:
**fúgōngfúsù** (弗恭弗肃)—lacking reverence and solemnity,
the excess of **dòngdàng** (动荡)—turbulence.
**Sìjiǔ** (四九) the **fourth phase of the ninth month** (四九) corresponds to **jīn** (金),
to the **west** (西方),
to **autumn** (秋).
**Dì** (日) **gēngxīn** (庚辛),
**shènyǒuxiǔ** (辰申酉).
**Shēngshāng** (声商)—sound of the **Shāng** (商) tone,
**sèbái** (色白)—white hue,
**wèixīn** (味辛)—pungent flavor,
**xiùxīng** (臭腥)—fishy odor,
**xínggé** (形革)—leathery form.
It **shēng** (生) produces **water** (水),
**shèng** (胜) overcomes **wood** (木).
**Shíkè** (时杀)—seasonal restraint,
**cánggān** (藏肝)—conceals the liver,
**cúnpò** (存魄)—preserves the **pò** (魄)—etheric soul.
**Xìngyì** (性谊)—nature of **yì** (谊)—harmony,
**qíngnù** (情怒)—passion of anger.
**Shìyán** (事言)—affairs of speech,
**yòngcóng** (用从)—conduct of compliance,
**sùyì** (撝乂)—solemn and **yì** (乂)—restrained.
**Zhèngyǔ** (征雨)—summons rain.
**Dìshǎowú** (帝少吴),
**Shénsuǎnshōu** (神蓐收),
**xīngcóngqìwèi** (星从其位)—stars follow their positions.
**Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Shì, Shēn** (胃、昴、毕、氏、参),
**wèishēnyǒuxiǔ** (位申酉).
Their **categories** (类) include **máo** (毛)—hair.
**Jīn** (金) **géhuǒ** (革火)—transforms fire,
and **shōu** (收)—concentrates it,
its **qì** (气) disperses and spreads.
To become **máo** (毛)—hair,
**gēngxīn** (庚辛) **xiàng** (象)—symbolism prevails.
To become **yī** (医)—physician,
**wūzhù** (巫祝)—shaman and diviner,
and **měng** (猛)—fierce.
**Tángrén** (唐人) avoided taboo,
often rewriting **hǔ** (虎)—tiger as **měng** (猛).
This character likely should be **hǔ** (虎),
though no original text confirms it.

To become **jiù** (旧)—old,
and **míng** (鸣)—sound.
**Yī** (医) attacks **jí** (疾)—illness,
**wūzhù** (巫祝) invoke the **bèibùxiǎng** (被不详)—unclear mysteries,
both skilled in **gé** (革)—transformation.
To become **měng** (猛)—fierce,
it is **hǔ** (虎)—tiger,
a **jiǎmáo** (甲毛) category of scales and hair.
The **hǔ** (虎) tiger transforms into **yìlóng** (异龙)—strange dragon,
its **jīnjiù** (因旧) reliance on the old
brings **bǐng** (炳)—radiance.
All things, once fully formed, **míng** (鸣)—resound,
as the tiger’s roar echoes through the wind—
the **shèng** (盛)—peak of sound.
The physician’s **gé** (革)—transformative work
restores the **jiù** (旧)—old order,
while shamans and diviners excel in **míng** (鸣)—resonance.
When things are **zhèng** (正)—proper, they mark **xīn** (新)—new;
when things are **lǎo** (老)—aged, they mark **jiù** (旧)—old.
All movement is **mù** (木)—wood,
all sound is **jīn** (金)—metal.
**Dòngjiá** (动夬) turbulent movement becomes **zào** (躁)—restlessness,
**shēngyáng** (声扬) resonant sound becomes **míng** (鸣)—resonance.
Resonance upholds **jié** (节)—order.
To become **mén** (门)—gate,
**shān** (山)—mountain,
**xiàn** (限)—boundary,
**biān** (边)—edge,
**chéng** (城)—wall,
**gǔ** (骨)—bone,
and **shí** (石)—stone:
with **firmness** (坚) and **establishing order** (立节),
they become **mén** (门)—gate,
**shān** (山)—mountain,
**xiàn** (限)—boundary,
**biān** (边)—edge,
**chéng** (城)—wall.
**Jīn** (金) restrains with **fāng** (方)—rectangle.
**Biān** (边) are the **sìfāng** (四方)—four directions,
**chéng** (城) the **sìyíng** (四营)—fortified enclosures,
to create **xiǎn** (险)—defense.
Thus, externally they symbolize **xiàn** (限)—boundary,
**biān** (边)—edge,
and **chéng** (城)—wall.
Internally, they symbolize **gǔ** (骨)—bone.
Bone arises from **firmness** (坚),
this is **mùqì** (木气)—wood **qi**.
Yet all things’ **firmness** (坚) is shaped by **jīn** (金),
so wood’s essence is **bái** (白)—white.
The **jīn** (金) category becomes **gǔ** (骨)—bone,
its extreme is **shí** (石)—stone.

To become **huánpèi** (环佩)—ornaments,
**shǒushì** (首饰)—head adornments,
**zhòngbǎo** (重宝)—precious treasures,
and **dàduō** (大哆)—great **duō** (哆).
*(Note: The **Dīng** (丁) and **Sòng** (宋) versions omit this line.)*

To become **kòuqì** (扣器)—vessels with metal-rimmed mouths.
**Kòu** (扣), pronounced as **kǒu** (口),
adorns vessels’ mouths with **jīn** (金)—metal.
*(Note: Likely the **extreme** (极) of firmness and **shuō** (说)—appeasement,
with **quality** (质) set and **ornament** (文) arising.)*
**Huánpèi** (环佩) are the **jié** (节)—nodes of the body.

含有畏

「It is **rigid yet timely in killing** (刚而时杀),
so its **emotion** (情) is **anger** (怒).

**Rites** (礼) and **things** (物) gather in **auspicious meetings** (嘉会相见),
so its **emotion** (情) is **joy** (乐).

**Wisdom** (智) stands alone, not merging with **things** (物),
yet **endlessly rescues** (善救不已),
so its **emotion** (情) is **sorrow** (悲).

The *Book of Documents* (《书》) says:
*"The human heart is ever perilous (人心惟危),
the Dao-heart ever subtle (道心惟微).
Only the refined, the singular (惟精惟一),
can steadfastly uphold the middle (允执厥中).
When the middle is not lost (中不失),
then it is the means to **settle peril** (定危).
When the middle shifts (中动),
it becomes the **emotion of fear** (恐惧之情)—
as when **Earth** (二五) is **overthrown** (震), this is already so."*

When the **heart** (心) is **shaken by things** (震于物)
and lacks steadfastness (无守则者),
it is not the **true nature of emotion** (情之正).

**Contemplation** (事思) and **enlightenment** (用睿),
**assisting the Sage** (撝圣),
**harnessing the winds** (征风)—

**Emperor** (帝) **Yellow** (黄) **the Yellow** (帝),
**Divine Sovereign** (神) **Hou** (后) **Tu** (土),
**Stars** (星) follow their **positions** (从其位).

**Jiao** (角) and **Kang** (亢) are positioned at **Chen** (辰),
**Kui** (奎) and **Lou** (娄) at **Xu** (戌),
**Dou** (斗) and **Niu** (牛) at **Chou** (丑),
**Jing** (井) and **Gui** (鬼) at **Wei** (未).

It is akin to **nakedness** (裸),
**sealing** (封),
though **Song** (宋) renders it as **sealing** (封)
and **mounds** (垄).

It is like a **vessel** (瓶).

It is a **palace** (宫),
a **residence** (宅),
a **central channel** (中溜).

It is **internal affairs** (内事),
**weaving** (织),
**clothing** (衣),
**garments** (裘).

It is **cocoons** (茧),
**down** (絮).

It is **beds** (床),
**mattresses** (荐).

**Nakedness** (裸) lacks scales, feathers, or fur—
the **body** (体) is **central** (中) and **bare** (而已).

The **Divine** (神) has no fixed form,
and the **Dao** (道) has not yet begun to **seal** (封).
Once **sealed** (封已),
this **boundary** (疆) and **territory** (界) arise.

Once **sealed** (封已),
it is like a **vessel** (瓶)—no more.

A **vessel** (瓶) **congeals Earth** (凝土) to become an **instrument** (器);
a **palace** (宫) **excavates Earth** (凿土) to become a **chamber** (室).

A **residence** (宅) is where one **dwells** (居).
Between the **palace** (宫) and **residence** (宅),
the **central channel** (中溜),
there are **internal affairs** (内事).

**Earth** (土) accumulates **yin** (阴),
and its **work** (功) completes **things** (作成物),
**discerning patterns** (识法) and **weft and warp** (经纬),
to make **clothing** (衣) and **garments** (裘)—
all **internal affairs** (内事).

**Nakedness** (裸) **contemplates** (思) how to **warm itself** (所以自燠),
thus **cocoons** (茧) **seal themselves** (自封),
mirroring the **human heart for clothing** (人衣裘之心).

**Hiding** (藏) within **clothing** (衣裘)
yet still **insufficient** (不足),
it **seeks** (因) **cocoons** (茧) and **down** (絮).

It **creates its own central channel** (自为中溜),
using **emptiness** (虚) and **transformation** (变) to **communicate** (通),
**benefiting life** (利用生).

To **beds** (床) and **mattresses** (荐),
it **settles its true nature** (宁厥正),
the **ultimate of stability** (安厚之极).

It is **domestication** (驯),
**embracing** (怀),
**abdominal organs** (腹器).

It is **fat** (脂),
**lacquer** (漆),
**glue** (胶).

It is **bags** (囊),
**wrappings** (包).

**Domestication** (驯) is the **way of women** (妇道).
**Embracing** (怀) is the **way of mothers** (母道).
With **embracing** (怀),
it becomes **abdominal organs** (腹器).

The **congealing of moderation** (中和之凝)
is **fat** (脂),
**lacquer** (漆),
**glue** (胶).

When **preserved and combined** (保合),
it becomes **bags** (囊) and **wrappings** (包).
This is how the **way of mothers** (母道) **completes things** (成物).

It is **chariots** (舆),
**axles** (毂).

It is **cultivation** (稼),
**parsimony** (啬).

It is **food** (食),
**sharing** (与).

It is **coffins** (棺),
**lids** (椟), though **Song** (宋) renders it as **coffin** (椁).

It is **crossroads** (衢),
**gatherings** (会),
**metropolises** (都).

It is **measurement** (度),
**scale** (量).

It is **earthworks** (土工),
**bows and arrows** (弓矢).

**Chariots** (舆) **carry** (载) with **rectitude** (方),
**axles** (毂) **operate centrally** (中运).

It is **cultivation** (稼),
**parsimony** (啬).

It is **food** (食),
**giving** (与).

It is **coffins** (棺),
**lids** (椟), symbolizing **Earth’s bearing and movement** (象地载之运).

The *Book of Documents* (《书》) says:
*"Earth **cultivates** (爰稼) **grain and harvests** (穑).*
**Food** (食) **realizes itself** (以自实),
and **nourishes life** (腴其生),
thus **death** (死) arises.
**Coffins** (棺) are what **humans return to Earth** (人之所以及於土) with.

All **hundreds of transformations** (百昌) **emerge from Earth** (生於土),
and **return to Earth** (反於土),
so that **life’s return to its origin** (生之生於本) is like **lids** (椟).

**Life and death** (死生) **cycle endlessly** (往复),
like **crossroads** (衢).
**Crossroads** (衢) are **pathways of convergence** (会通).

Four **directions** (达) converge,
and the **center** (中) is their **metropolis** (都).
**Measurement** (度) and **scale** (量) are **meticulously applied** (法谨),
and **earthworks** (土工) **depend on it** (资之).

**Governance** (治) of a **state** (国) reaches **bows and arrows** (弓矢)—
this is the **ultimate** (极).

Thus it is said:
*"The **movement of the Five Weapons** (五兵之运) is the **end of virtue** (德之末)."*

The **sprouting of things** (物之萌生),
**separating from concealment** (离潜),
**emerging and hiding** (发伏),
is like the **arrows of a bow** (弓之矢),
the **string of a bow** (弓之彀),
**wandering through the center** (率游於中央).

It is akin to **yellow monstrosities** (黄怪),
**foolishness** (愚),
**dazzling blindness** (牟).
**Song** (宋) says **dazzling blindness** (牟) should be **blindness** (瞀).

**Evil** (妖) does not **arise on its own** (不自兴),
it comes from **humans reversing virtue** (由人反德).

**Foolishness** (愚) is a **disease of the heart** (心之疾).
**Dazzling blindness** (牟) is **interchangeable with confusion** (与蒙通),
a **fault of muddled impurity** (零浊之咎).

The **mysterious calculations** (玄数) of the **Five Phases** (五行)
**illuminate** (昭) the **patterns of things** (事类),
thus the *Great Treatise of the Yellow River* (《洪范》) **orders the Five Phases** (五行为序).

**Deeply knowing** (深知) the **Five Phases** (五行)
allows one to **discuss the Dao** (论道),
to **establish rites** (制礼)—
not merely to **revere their divinations** (特尚其占).

When the **Five Phases** (五行) **take effect** (用事), **kingship** (王) arises,
and **kingship** (王) **generates mutual relations** (所生相).
Thus when **kingship** (王) **declines** (废),
the **one who overcomes kingship** (胜王) **is imprisoned** (囚),
and the **one kingship overcomes** (王所胜) **dies** (死).

In **sound** (声),
**Gong** (宫) is the **Sovereign** (君),
**Zheng** (征) is **affairs** (事),
**Shang** (商) is the **minister** (相),
**Jue** (角) is the **people** (民),
**Yu** (羽) is **things** (物).

In **music** (律吕),
**Yellow Bell** (黄钟) **generates** (生) **Forest Bell** (林钟),
**Forest Bell** (林钟) **generates** (生) **Grand Subduing** (太簇),
**Grand Subduing** (太簇) **generates** (生) **Southern Reeds** (南吕),
**Southern Reeds** (南吕) **generates** (生) **Maoshi** (姑洗),
**Maoshi** (姑洗) **generates** (生) **Responding Bell** (应钟),
**Responding Bell** (应钟) **generates** (生) **Rui Bin** (蕤宾),
**Rui Bin** (蕤宾) **generates** (生) **Great Reeds** (大吕),
**Great Reeds** (大吕) **generates** (生) **Equable** (夷则),
**Equable** (夷则) **generates** (生) **Intermediate Bell** (夹钟),
**Intermediate Bell** (夹钟) **generates** (生) **None Shooting** (无射),
**None Shooting** (无射) **generates** (生) **Central Reeds** (仲吕).

**Affairs** (事) **transform and converge** (变通),
**ministers** (相) **govern and regulate** (宰制),
**people** (民) **are born and harmonized** (生而和),
**things** (物) **are hidden and transformed** (藏而化).

The **Sovereign** (君) **remains central without action** (中心无为),
to **guard the utmost rectitude** (守至正),
so all **sounds** (凡声),
**heavy** (重) do not **exceed Gong** (不逾宫),
and **light** (轻) do not **fall below Yu** (不过羽).

**Eighty-one** (九九八十一) is **Gong** (宫),
**three parts minus one** (三分去一) is **Fifty-four** (五十四) for **Zheng** (征);
**three parts plus one** (三分益一) is **Seventy-two** (七十二) for **Shang** (商);
**three parts minus one** (三分去一) is **Forty-eight** (四十八) for **Yu** (羽);
**three parts plus one** (三分益一) is **Sixty-four** (六十四) for **Jue** (角).

This is the **Yellow Bell’s** (黄钟) **method of balancing the Five Sounds** (均五声法).

The **Twelve Pitches** (十二律) each **adopt their own numbers** (各以其数) as **Gong** (宫),
and **reduce or augment** (损益) to **generate Zheng, Shang, Yu, Jue** (生征、商、羽、角),
thus **completing sixty sounds** (为六十声).

The **Yellow Bell’s** (黄钟) **tube** (管) is **nine inches** (九寸),
**three parts minus one** (三分去一) **produces Forest Bell** (下生林钟);
The **Forest Bell’s** (林钟) **tube** (管) is **six inches** (六寸),
**three parts plus one** (三分益一) **produces Grand Subduing** (上生太簇);
The **Grand Subduing’s** (太簇) **tube** (管) is **eight inches** (八寸),
**three parts minus one** (三分去一) **produces Southern Reeds** (下生南吕), **five inches and one-third** (五寸三分寸之一);
The **Southern Reeds** (南吕) **generate Maoshi** (上生姑洗), **seven inches and nine-tenths** (七寸九分寸之一);
The **Maoshi** (姑洗) **generate Responding Bell** (下生应钟), **four inches and twenty-seven-hundredths** (四寸二十七分寸之二十);
The **Responding Bell** (应钟) **generate Rui Bin** (上生蕤宾), **six inches and eighty-one-hundredths** (六寸八十一分寸之二十六);
The **Rui Bin** (蕤宾) **generate Great Reeds** (又上生大吕), **eight inches and two hundred forty-three-hundredths** (八寸二百四十三分寸之百四);
The **Great Reeds** (大吕) **generate Equable** (下生夷则), **five inches and seven hundred twenty-nine-hundredths** (五寸七百二十九分寸之四百五十一);

The **Equable** (夷则) **generates Intercalary Bell** (夹钟), **seven inches and two thousand one hundred eighty-seven-hundredths** (七寸二千一百八十七分寸之千七十五);

The **Intercalary Bell** (夹钟) **generates Unshot** (无射), **four inches and six thousand five hundred sixty-one-hundredths** (四寸六千五百六十一分寸之六千五百二十四);

The **Unshot** (无射) **generates Middle Reeds** (中吕), **six inches and ten thousand nine hundred sixty-three-hundredths** (六寸万九千六百八十三分寸之万二千九百七十四).

For indeed, the numbers of **augmentation and diminution** (损益) do not exceed **three**, and the numbers of **generation and derivation** (生取) do not exceed **eight**.

Thus, it **harmonizes the two extremes** (统和二极) and **narrates the eight winds** (述行八风).

From **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳) are all **yang cycles** (阳纪);
**Great Reeds** (大吕), **Intercalary Bell** (夹钟), and **Middle Reeds** (中吕) are the **yin tones within yang** (阳中之阴声).

From **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥) are all **yin cycles** (阴纪);
**Rui Bin** (蕤宾), **Southern Reeds** (南吕), and **Responding Bell** (应钟) are the **yang tones within yin** (阴中之阳声).

Thus, from **Zi** to **Si**, all are **generated downward** (下生);
From **Wu** to **Hai**, all are **generated upward** (上生).

In music, if **Huangzhong** (黄钟) is the **gong** (宫), then **Linzhong** (林钟) is the **zheng** (征), **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **shang** (商), **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **yu** (羽), and **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **jiao** (角);

If **Linzhong** (林钟) is the **gong** (宫), then **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **zheng** (征), **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **shang** (商), **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **yu** (羽), and **Yingzhong** (应钟) is the **jiao** (角);

If **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **gong** (宫), then **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **zheng** (征), **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **shang** (商), **Yingzhong** (应钟) is the **yu** (羽), and **Ruibin** (蕤宾) is the **jiao** (角).

In all, the **five tones** (五声) and **six lü twelve pipes** (六律十二管) **cyclically become the gong** (旋相为宫).

By **three transformations** (三变通), this is what is recorded as **"spreading the Five Phases across the Four Seasons, harmonizing to then give birth to the months"** (播五行於四时，和而后月生).

The **Five Phases** (五行) **alternately reign** (更王用事), one **rectifies and conquers** (一正胜), and **harmonizes with generation** (而参以生和), this is what the *Yijing* calls **"the nature and disposition of what is beneficial and upright"** (利贞之性情).

The numbers of **Zi and Wu** (子午) are **nine**, **Chou and Wei** (丑未) are **eight**, **Yin and Shen** (寅申) are **seven**, **Mao and You** (卯酉) are **six**, **Chen and Xu** (辰戌) are **five**, **Si and Hai** (巳亥) are **four**.

Thus, there are **forty-two lü** (律四十二), and **thirty-six lü** (吕三十六).

Combining the numbers of **lü and lü**, some **return** (或还) and some **do not** (或否), totaling **seventy-eight** (凡七十有八), and the number of **Huangzhong** (黄钟) is established.

All these are **derived from Huangzhong** (皆生黄钟).

**Zi and Wu** (子午) are the **Celestial and Earthly** means of **establishing the Supreme Pole** (天地之所以经皇极), and the number **nine** (九数) is **fulfilled** (缊焉).

Yet their **decline reaches Si and Hai** (杀至于巳亥), and the **lü** (律) **integrates the numbers of Zi, Wu, Yin, Shen, Chen, and Xu** (综子午寅申辰戌之数) to make **forty-two**, while the **lü** (吕) **integrates the numbers of Chou, Wei, Mao, You, Si, and Hai** (综丑未卯酉巳亥之数) to make **thirty-six**.

Combined, they total **seventy-eight** (凡七十有八).

Yet the numbers of **lü and lü**, **Huangzhong alone returns to nine** (黄钟独还得九), while the others do not.

Thus, **Huangzhong is the master of lü and lü** (黄钟为律吕之宗).

The number of **Huangzhong** is **eighty-one** (黄钟之数八十有一), yet it is **established at seventy-eight** (而立於七十有八).

Thus, **three are left void** (虚其三), as the **mystery of all wonders** (以为众妙之玄).

The reason for using **nine** (所以用九者也) is to **triple three** (参三焉), and the **twelve zodiacal branches** (十有二辰) stop at **four**, thus **establishing the square** (则以立方而已矣).

All these **measurements derive from Huangzhong** (皆由黄钟者).

From the **breadth of ninety grains** (九十黍之广) **length is generated**, and from the **pipe of nine inches** (九寸之管) **measure is generated**.

From its **weight of one thousand two hundred grains** (一千二百黍之重) as **twelve zhu** (十二铢), **weights and measures are generated** (而生权衡也).

The numbers of **Jia and Si** (甲巳) are **nine**#1, **Yi and Geng** (乙庚) are **eight**, **Bing and Xin** (丙辛) are **seven**, **Ding and Ren** (丁壬) are **six**, **Wu and Gui** (戊癸) are **five**.

**Tones are generated from the days** (声生於日), **lü from the zodiacal branches** (律生於辰).

**Tones are straight by nature and quality** (声以情质), **lü are narrated by harmony and sound** (律以和声).

When **tone and lü accord**, the **eight kinds of sound are born** (声律相协，而八音生).

The **Celestial numbers are five**, the **Earthly numbers are five**, and the **five positions** (五位) **mutually attain harmony**, each having its **resonance** (各有合), thus the **ten days** (十日) are as such.

**Celestial and Earthly sincerity** (天地中孚) is **manifested in Jiazi** (象见甲子).

**Jia** is the **first origin** (一元也).

One becomes **three**, three becomes **nine**, and the numbers are **exhausted** (而数究焉).

Thus, the number of **Jia** is **nine**, and the number of **Ji** is also **nine**#2, following their **harmony** (从其合也).

The number of **Jia** is **nine**, descending to **Yi**, **Bing**, **Ding**, and **Wu**;

The number of **Ji** is **nine**#3, descending to **Geng**, **Xin**, **Ren**, and **Gui**.

The numbers **reach their limit at five**, thus the **days govern by their cycles** (是故日以冲运也).

**Jia and Yi** (甲乙) are **jiao** (角), **Bing and Ding** (丙丁) are **zheng** (征), **Geng and Xin** (庚辛) are **shang** (商), **Ren and Gui** (壬癸) are **yu** (羽), **Wu and Ji** (戊己) are **gong** (宫)#4.

Thus, **tones are generated from the days** (声生於日), the **qi of Heaven** (天之气);

**Lü are generated from the zodiacal branches** (律生於辰), the **law of Earth** (地之法).

**Tones are rectified by nature and quality** (声直之以情质), **lü are narrated by harmony and sound** (律述之以和声).

Thus, the sounds of **metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, leather, and wood** (金石丝竹匏土革木) are born, and **tone can be harmonized to form culture** (声可和而成文).

This is because **each day has its resonance** (凡以日各有合故也).

The **Nine Heavens** (九天):
One is **Central Heaven** (中天), two is **Excess Heaven** (羡天), three is **Following Heaven** (从天), four is **Changing Heaven** (更天), five is **Blinking Heaven** (睟天), six is **Boundless Heaven** (廓天), seven is **Reduced Heaven** (减天), eight is **Sunken Heaven** (沈天), nine is **Completed Heaven** (成天).

The **Nine People** (九人):
One is **lowly person** (下人), two is **common person** (平人), three is **ascending person** (进人), four is **low fortune** (下禄), five is **middle fortune** (中禄), six is **high fortune** (上禄), seven is **lost aspiration** (失志), eight is **sick and stagnant** (疾淤), **Song reads as stagnant-sick** (宋作淤疾), nine is **extreme** (极).

The **Nine Movements** (九行) are by **action**, according to **beginning, middle, and end** (据始、中、终);

The **Nine Earths** are by **position**, according to **lower, middle, and upper** (据下、中、上);

The **Nine People** are by **observation of motion**, according to **thought, fortune, and calamity** (据思、福、祸).

Two and seven are **eyes** (目);
Three and eight are **nose** (鼻);
Four and nine are **mouth** (口);
Five and five are **back** (后).

The **Nine Manifestations** (九体) and **Nine Affinities** (九属) reveal the count of solar terms (日辰之数). The descending sequence from the **Nine Differences** (九差) is indeed the natural order.

The **Nine Sequences** (九序):
One is **First of First** (孟孟),
Two is **First of Middle** (孟仲),
Three is **First of Last** (孟季),
Four is **Middle of First** (仲孟),
Five is **Middle of Middle** (仲仲),
Six is **Middle of Last** (仲季),

The **Nine Affinities** govern the **Nine Manifestations** and **Nine Orifices** (九窍), for the **Manifestations** and **Orifices** are the foundation upon which human **Affinities** are established. The **Nine Matters** govern the **Nine Sequences** and **Nine Years**, for the **Sequences** and **Years** are the means by which human **Matters** are conducted.

The **Sequences** advance in cycles of three years, completing ten.

The **Mysterious Calculations** (玄算) for divination:
**Family** (家), one is placed as one, two as two, three as three;
**Division** (部), one does not increase, two increase by three, three increase by six;
**State** (州), one does not increase, two increase by nine, three increase by eighteen;
**Direction** (方), one does not increase, two increase by twenty-seven, three increase by fifty-four.

*The Law of Speech (法言)* states:
*The Book of Changes (易)*, a work of numbers, can be counted. What can be counted is also what is complete. The *Book of Documents (书)* lacks more than half its content, yet scholars unfamiliar with it cannot grasp its essence, for there are no numerical principles to establish its categories and forms. The **Mysterious Calculations** allow the diviner to know the order of the **First Praises** (首赞) concerning the day and stars, thus maintaining the celestial order (经天) and human relationships (彝伦) without confusion.

If one obtains a **Direction**, a **State**, a **Division**, and three **Families** in divination, then the **Family** is placed as three, and the **Direction**, **State**, and **Division** are all without increase, totaling three. This is the order of the **First Praise** (玄首之次), three in count. All increases are derived from the initial **Family** numbers.

To seek the **Praise of Manifestation** (表之赞), place the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtract the **Great Beginning** (太始) divination count, reduce by one and multiply by nine, then add the **Praise**. Subtract half of the **Mysterious Name** count, and one obtains the **Praise** subtracted from the Winter Solstice count.

Even is the night of the obtained day, odd is the day of the obtained day. Xu (许) and Huang (黄) read this as *ming* (明), Song (宋) and Guo (郭) read it as *dé* (得).

Placing the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtracting the **Great Beginning** count and reducing by one means subtracting the first **Praise** of the placed **Mysterious Name**. Multiplying by nine means each **Praise** is counted nine times. Subtracting the first **Praise** of the **Mysterious Name**, one then calculates the **Praise** to be added. One **Praise** increases by one, two by two, three by three.

To seek the day, subtract the **Mysterious Name** count from the **Praise**, then halve it: two **Praises** make one day, hence an even **Praise** is the night, and an odd **Praise** is the day.

If divination yields a response, from the center to the response, totaling forty-one, then place forty-one, reduce by one and multiply by nine, resulting in three hundred sixty. Add the obtained **Praise**, subtract half of three hundred sixty, and one obtains one hundred eighty, which is the count subtracted from the Winter Solstice.

Increase by one to get three hundred sixty-one, an odd **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the day. Increase by two to get three hundred sixty-two, an even **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the night.

To seek the star, begin with **The Ox of the Net** (牵牛). When the **Mysterious Calculations** are exhausted, that is the day. From the Winter Solstice, **The Ox of the Net** moves one degree per day, completing one degree per day.

Thus, when the star degrees are exhausted, one obtains the degree where the day resides.

*Great Mysterious Calculations* (太玄文) Volume Nine, *Mysterious Calculations* (玄文).

The **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. The **Vague** is the north, winter, where form has not yet emerged. The **Direct** is the east, spring, where substance exists but lacks adornment. The **Covered** is the south, summer, where things grow long and may all be grasped and worn. *Xu* and *Huang* read it as **Load** (载), *Zhang* and *Ding* as **Wear** (戴), *Guo* as **Wear** (戴).

The **Mature** is the west, autumn, where all things take shape and are completed. When form exists, it returns to the formless, hence the **Dark**. Therefore, all things are **Vague** in the north, **Direct** in the east, **Covered** in the south, **Mature** in the west, and **Dark** in the north.

Thus, the **Vague** is the dwelling of the **Having**; the **Direct**, the foundation of **Adornment**; the **Covered**, the master of **Decay**; the **Mature**, the repository of **Life**; and the **Dark**, the storehouse of **Illumination**.

The **Vague** shelters its **Qi**; the **Direct** encounters its kind. The **Covered** reaches its peak in growth; the **Mature** examines its completion. *Fan* notes: "Examine things to make them fully realized." The main text reads **Close** (亲), but this is an error by the copyist. *Song* and *Guo* read it as **Completion** (就). The **Dark** reflects its depths.

The **Vague** and **Covered** reach extremes; the **Direct** and **Mature** admonish each other. Emerging from the **Dark** and returning to the **Dark**, the new and the old alternate. *Zhang* reads it as **Loan** (贷).

Yin and Yang succeed one another; clarity and turbidity intermingle. Those who advance are promoted; those who succeed are retired. When used, they are **debased**; when timely, they are **noble**. The celestial patterns and earthly substances remain unaltered in their positions.

The **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. From the **Vague** come speech, action, and blessings or calamities. In the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed.

Action leaves a trace; speech has sound; blessings bring **Strength** (膊). *Yin* **Shàn** (剸) means "to cut flesh"; also read as *Yin* **Shùnguǎn** (竖衮). Calamities manifest in form—this is the **Direct**.

If there is the **Direct**, one may be **Covered**; if **Covered**, one may reach **Maturity**; if **Mature**, one returns to the **Dark**. Therefore, in the **Vague**’s time, all may be regulated—thus the eighty-one schools arise from the **Vague**.

The heavens shine brilliantly from the **boundless** (无畛). *Yin* **Xuàn** (炫) is read as *Hu* **Yàn** (胡绚). The **radiant** (熿熿) emerges from the **limitless** (无垠). *Yin* **Guāng** (熿) is read as *Hù* **Guāng** (户光), the same as **Resplendent** (煌).

Thus, in the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven conceals itself in **depth**, stirs to **reveal**, exalts to **overlook**, regulates to **restrain**, and concludes in **obscurity**. Its depths are unfathomable; its brilliance is boundless.

Hence, the sage hides in **depth** to properly honor the spirits, stirs to **reveal** to inspire the people, shines brightly to **encompass** and illuminate, regulates to **restrain** to make all tremble—*Yin* **Nǐlì** (牛力) or *Yin* **Nǐ** (拟)—and conceals in **obscurity** to remain hidden.

The sage who embodies these five aspects is thus called the **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**.

Someone asks: Why does *Kunlun* **Pāngbó** (昆仑旁薄) relate to **obscurity** (幽)?

It is said: The sage, like the heavens and earth, contemplates and encompasses all things. Within *Kunlun*, form has not yet manifested externally; dwelling alone in joy, pondering alone in sorrow—joy is unbearable, sorrow is insurmountable—hence it is called **obscurity**.

Why does the spirit contend in the **mysterious** (玄)?

It is said: The petty person’s heart is mixed, seeking to manifest externally, and uses Yin and Yang to contend over auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Yang contends over auspiciousness; Yin contends over inauspiciousness.

The wind reveals the tiger; the clouds reveal the dragon. The sage acts, and all things harmonize. The dragon emerges from within—why is this so?

It is said: The dragon is where **virtue/power** (德) first takes form. If Yin does not reach its extreme, Yang does not arise; if chaos does not reach its extreme, **virtue/power** (德) does not manifest.

The sage cultivates **virtue/power** (德) to await the time, neither acting before its due nor lagging behind. When movement and stillness are subtly discerned, without losing their principles—who but the sage can do this?

Thus, the beginning and end may be used as **ordinary** (庸).

The *Kù* is empty with no cause—greatly receiving life and fate—why is this so?

It is said: The petty person cannot embrace emptiness or dwell in lowliness; they are **level and common** (庳), yet cannot be **overlooked**. Empty yet able to be **filled**, lacking yet able to **have**, relying on causes to **act**—thus they greatly receive life and fate without **avoidance** (辟), hence the *Kù* is **obscured** (否). All versions read it as "without **speech or avoidance** (无辞辟)," but *Ding* and *Zhang* omit the **speech** (无辞) character.

The day aligns with the heavens—why is this so?

The Sage rides in station,
as chariot and as steed—
the chariot’s **rim** (*lǎn*)[^1] and the horse’s **tail-hair knot** (*jiè*)[^2]
can traverse the world—
thus it is advantageous to be the **master**.

The moon withholds its embrace,
yet shines brighter in the West—
why is this so?

It is said: The petty person is **full and overflowing**.
Those who **self-destroy** from emptiness—
water **fades** into the depths,
trees **wither** to their roots,
mountains **wither** and grow lean,
marshes **swell** with fat.
The **virtuous** perceive this, yet the multitude knows not.

Why does the **head** (*qiú*)[^3] **enclose** the **true** (*zhēn*)?
It is said: **Ren** (*rén*) abhors **non-ren**,
**proper conduct** (*yì*) abhors **non-conduct**.
The Sage’s **generosity** suffices to **nourish the many**,
his **harmony and softness** suffice to **settle all things**.
Heaven and Earth contain all things—
what cannot be contained by Heaven and Earth
is only the **un-ren** and **un-conduct**.

Thus, water **encloses the true**.

Yellow not yellow—
why is this so?

It is said: The petty person **loses the central norm**.
All **ones** mark the **beginning**—
all **ones**, *Zhang* reads as **"say"** (*wèi*).
All **threes** mark the **end**—
the **two** obtain the **middle**?[^4]

The **virtuous** in **mystery** (*xuán*) are **upright** (*zhèng*), in **fortune** (*fú*) are **effusive** (*chōng*), in **calamity** (*huò*) are **resolute** (*fǎn*).
The petty in **mystery** are **deviant** (*yé*), in **fortune** are **arrogant** (*jiāo*), in **calamity** are **desperate** (*qióng*).

Thus, the **virtuous** in proper station **thrive** (*chāng*), in improper station remain **good** (*liáng*).
The petty in proper station **flourish** (*héng*), in improper station **perish** (*sàng*).
Even the **Eight** (*bā*—the Eight Trigrams) though in proper station,
still **revert** (*fù*) to the **constant** (*cháng*)—how is this so?

**Preternatural** (*diān*) **spirits** (*líng*), their **qi-forms** (*qìxíng*) **inverted** (*fǎn*), why is this so?
It is said: They are **severed** (*jué*) and **extreme** (*jí*) in the **upper** (*shàng*).
**Extreme** in the **upper** then **transforms** (*yùn*), severed in the **lower** (*xià*) **brings about reversal** (*diān*).

The **spirits** already **reversed** (*diān*), how can their **qi-forms** (*qìxíng*) **remain** (*zài*) without **inversion** (*fǎn*)?

The **virtuous** are those who reach **high age** (*gāo*) and **extreme times** (*jí shí*).

The **yang** is **extreme** in the **upper**, the **yin** is **extreme** in the **lower**.
**Qi-forms** (*qìxíng*) **err** (*kuàng*), **spirits** (*guǐ*) and **gods** (*shén*) **obstruct** (*zǔ*).
The **accomplished** (*xián*) **fear**, the petty **rely** (*hù*).

**Kunlun** (*kūnlún*) **flanks** (*páng*) **thinness** (*bó*), **excessive** (*tài*) **tolerance** (*róng*).
**Divine** (*shén*) **combat** (*zhàn*) in **mystery** (*xuán*), **mutual assault** (*xiāng gōng*).
The **Dragon** (*lóng*) **emerges** (*chū*) from the **center** (*zhōng*), **following** (*shì*) **its course** (*cóng*).

**Hollow** (*qū*) **emptiness** (*xū*) **denies** (*pǐ*), **unfairness** (*bù gōng*).
The **Sun** (*rì*) **aligns** (*zhèng*) in the **Heaven** (*tiān*), **radiance** (*guāng*) **penetrates** (*tōng*).
The **Moon** (*yuè*) **lacks** (*quē*) its **clasp** (*bó*), **waxing and waning** (*shǔn yíng*).
The **head** (*qiú*) **encloses** (*bāo*) the **true** (*zhēn*), **conforming** (*fǎ*) to the **virtue** (*dé*).

Yellow not yellow—
**losing** (*shī*) the **central norm** (*zhōng jīng*).
**Preternatural** (*diān*) **spirits** (*líng*) **inversion** (*fǎn*), **exhausting** (*qióng*) the **Heavenly** (*tiān*) **sentiment** (*qíng*).
**Mountain** (*gāng*) **erect** (*zhí*) **veiled** (*méng*) by the **head** (*qiú*), **praising** (*zàn*) the **group** (*qún*) in **darkness** (*míng*).
**Kunlun** (*kūnlún*) **flanks** (*páng*) **thinness** (*bó*), **resources** (*zī*) **and** (*huái*) **heart** (*wéi*) **lack direction** (*wú fāng*).
**Divine** (*shén*) **combat** (*zhàn*) in **mystery** (*xuán*), **deviance** (*yé*) and **uprightness** (*zhèng*) both **proceed** (*xíng*).
The **Dragon** (*lóng*) **emerges** (*chū*) from the **center** (*zhōng*), **law** (*fǎ*) and **degree** (*dù*) **cultivated** (*wén míng*).
**Hollow** (*qū*) **emptiness** (*xū*) **denies** (*pǐ*), **ministerial conduct** (*chén dào*) **improper** (*bù dāng*).
The **Sun** (*rì*) **aligns** (*zhèng*) in the **Heaven** (*tiān*), **riding** (*chéng*) the **unyielding** (*jiàng*) **of** (*zhī*) **Heaven** (*qián*).
The **Moon** (*yuè*) **lacks** (*quē*) its **clasp** (*bó*), **to observe** (*guàn*) **eclipse and return** (*xiāo shì*).
The **head** (*qiú*) **encloses** (*bāo*) the **true** (*zhēn*), **able** (*néng*) **to bear** (*rèn*) **punishment** (*xíng*) and **virtue** (*dé*).

**Able** (*néng*) **to bear** (*rèn*), **original** (*běn*) **capacity** (*néng*) **as** (*zuò*) **scrape** (*kāi*)—
*Zhang* reads as **"scrape"** (*kāi*), lacking the **able** (*néng*) character.
All **originals** (*zhū běn*) **deny** (*pǐ*).

Yellow not yellow—
**cannot** (*bù kě*) **align** (*yì*) with it.

**Preternatural** (*diān*) **spirits** (*líng*) **inversion** (*fǎn*), **times** (*shí*) **then have** (*yǒu*) **extremes** (*jí*).
**Mountain** (*gāng*) **erect** (*zhí*) **veiled** (*méng*) by the **head** (*qiú*), **thus exhausting** (*nǎi qióng*) the **divine realm** (*shén yù*).

What the **Heaven** (*tiān*) and **Earth** (*dì*) **cherish** (*guì*) is called **life** (*shēng*).
What **things** (*wù*) **revere** (*zūn*) is called **human** (*rén*).
The **greatest human principle** (*dà lún*) is called **governance** (*zhì*).
What **governance** (*zhì*) **relies upon** (*yīn*) is called **division** (*bì*).

**Exalting** (*chóng*) **Heaven** (*tiān*) and **universal** (*pǔ*) **Earth** (*dì*), **partitioning** (*fèn*) **groups** (*qún*) and **paired** (*ǒu*) **things** (*wù*), **making** (*shǐ*) them **not lose** (*bù shī*) their **order** (*tǒng*)—
none **more effective** (*mó ruò*) than **division** (*bì*).

**Heaven** (*tiān*) **divides** (*bì*) from the **upper** (*shàng*), **Earth** (*dì*) **divides** (*bì*) from the **lower** (*xià*), the **Sovereign** (*jūn*) **divides** (*bì*) from the **center** (*zhōng*).

**Gazing upward** (*yǎng tiān*) at **Heaven** (*tiān*), yet **Heaven** (*tiān*) does not **weary** (*qì*)—
*qì* and *qì* are the same.
**Gazing downward** (*fǔ dì*) at **Earth** (*dì*), yet **Earth** (*dì*) does not **be idle** (*dài*).
**Weary** (*qì*) not **Heaven** (*tiān*), **idle** (*dài*) not **Earth** (*dì*).
**Weary** (*qì*) and **idle** (*dài*), yet **able** (*néng*) in **their affairs** (*shì*)—
ancient and modern **none** (*wèi*) have **marked** (*zhǔ*) this.

Thus, the **Sage** (*shèng rén*) **upholds** (*áng*) **Heaven** (*tiān*) and is **constant** (*cháng*).
**Exhausts** (*qióng*) the **divine** (*shén*), **digs** (*jué*) **transformation** (*biàn*).
**Extremes** (*jí*) **things** (*wù*), **exhausts** (*qióng*) **sentiment** (*qíng*).

**Aligns** (*pèi*) with **Heaven** (*tiān*) and **Earth** (*dì*) in **their forms** (*tǐ*), **with spirits** (*guǐ*) and **gods** (*shén*) in **their essences** (*líng*), **with yin** (*yīn*) and **yang** (*yáng*) in **their transformations** (*huà*), **with the Four Seasons** (*sì shí*) in **their sincerity** (*chéng*).
**Views** (*shì*) **Heaven** (*tiān*) and **Heaven** (*tiān*) **obeys** (*xún*), **views** (*shì*) **Earth** (*dì*) and **Earth** (*dì*) **obeys** (*xún*), **views** (*shì*) the **divine** (*shén*) and the **divine** (*shén*) **obeys** (*xún*), **views** (*shì*) **times** (*shí*) and **times** (*shí*) **obey** (*xún*).
**Heaven** (*tiān*), **Earth** (*dì*), **divine** (*shén*), and **times** (*shí*) all **submissive** (*xún*), yet **evil** (*è*) **enters** (*rù*) **rebellion** (*nì*)?

The *Poem* (*Shī*) says:
*"The august Sovereign maintains **division** (*bì*), **law triumphs** (*fǎ shèng*).*
**Central** (*zhōng*) is the **virtue** (*dé*) of the **Sovereign** (*jūn*), yet **division** (*bì*) **governs** (*tǒng*) **uprightness** (*zhèng*).
This is what is called **Great Beginning** (*tài shǐ*), from which the **transformations** (*yùn*) of **Heaven** (*tiān*) and **Earth** (*dì*) **commence** (*qǐ*).

**Mystery** (*xuán*) **praise** (*zàn*) **research** (*yán*), **commence** (*qǐ*), **cut** (*qiè*).
**Praise** (*zàn*) of **mystery** (*xuán*), sometimes **with qi** (*qì*), sometimes **with kindred** (*lèi*), sometimes **with affairs** (*shì*) **in their** (*zhī*) **exhaustion** (*jué*).

**Exhaustion** (*jué*), pronounced as *wěi*.
**Examine** (*jiǎn*) **its surname** (*xìng*), **investigate** (*shěn*) **its family** (*jiā*).
**Observe** (*guàn*) **its encounters** (*zāo yù*), **labor** (*lè*)—
**its affairs** (*shì*), **detailed** (*xiáng*) in **numbers** (*shù*).
**Meeting** (*féng*) the **divine** (*shén*), **Heaven** (*tiān*) **obeys** (*xún*).
**Touching** (*chù*) **Earth** (*dì*), **fields** (*tián*) **obey** (*xún*).
Then the **sentiment** (*qíng*) of **mystery** (*xuán*) is **obtained** (*dé*).

Thus, **head** (*shǒu*) is **Heavenly nature** (*tiān xìng*).
**Chōng** (*chōng*), **opposite** (*duì*) its **uprightness** (*zhèng*).
**Cuò** (*cuò*), **interwoven** (*jiā*).
*Cuò* (*cuò*), pronounced as *bìng* or *bìng* (普耕切).

**Measure** (*cè*), **by which** (*suǒ*) **to know** (*zhī*) its **sentiment** (*qíng*).
**Zhān** (*zhān*), **to extend** (*zhāng*).
**Yíng** (*yíng*), **to illuminate** (*míng*).

**Numbers** (*shù*) for **categories** (*pǐn*) and **patterns** (*shì*), **ornaments** (*wén*) for **adornment** (*zǎo shì*).
**Qiè** (*qiè*), **to imitate** (*nǐ*).
**Tú** (*tú*), **to symbolize** (*xiàng*).
**Gào** (*gào*), **its path** (*yú*) **of departure** (*wǎng*).

**Heaven** (*tiān*) **first bestows** (*zào jiàng*) **life** (*shēng*) upon **the people** (*mín*), **making** (*shǐ*) their **appearance** (*mào*) **move** (*dòng*), **mouths** (*kǒu*) **speak** (*yán*), **eyes** (*mù*) **see** (*shì*), **ears** (*ěr*) **listen** (*tīng*), **hearts** (*xīn*) **think** (*sī*).
**There are laws** (*yǒu fǎ*), then **formation** (*chéng*) occurs.
**There are no laws** (*wú fǎ*), then **formation** (*chéng*) does not occur.

**Sincerity** (*chéng*) **has** (*yǒu*) **not-sincerity** (*bù chéng*), *Fàn* and *Sòng* read as *"sincerity has no awe"* (*bù wēi*), *Dīng* reads as *"not fear"* (*bù xìng*), *Huáng* reads as *"not-sincerity"* (*bù chéng*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of laws** (*jīng*).

**Cloth** (*yī*) as **garment** (*yī*), **lapel** (*rèn*)—
*rèn* pronounced as *shān* (所交切).
**Skirt** (*cháng*) **with folds** (*zhé*) **and** (*fú*) **width** (*fú*).
*zhé* pronounced as *bì* (音壁).

The **garment** (*yī*) and **skirt** (*cháng*) **institution** (*zhì*), all **originals** (*zhū běn*) read as *"institution"* (*zhì*), *Sòng* only says *"garment and skirt"* (*yī cháng*) **institutes** (*zhì*) **the world** (*shì tiān xià*).
Nearly **original** (*jìn běn*) reads as *"institution"* (*zhì*).
**To institute** (*zhì*) **the world** (*tiān xià*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of laws** (*jīng*) **in the** (*zhī*) **Eight** (*sān bā*).

**Strips** (*bǐ*) **of** (*zhé*) **writing** (*zá*) as **armor** (*jiǎ*), **hat** (*guàn*) **of** (*jūn*) **pride** (*qiāo*) as **spear** (*jǐ*).
**Wearing armor** (*bèi jiǎ*) **and** (*hé*) **spear** (*jǐ*), **pride** (*qiāo*)—
*jūn* pronounced as *jù* (巨巾切), **spear shaft** (*máo dǐng*).

**To threaten** (*wēi*) **without reverence** (*bù kè*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of laws** (*jīng*) **in the** (*zhī*) **Four** (*sì*) **Nine** (*jiǔ*).

**Respectful** (*zūn*) **respectful** (*zūn*) as **Sovereign** (*jūn*), **low** (*bēi*) **low** (*bēi*) as **minister** (*chén*).
The **Sovereign** (*jūn*) and **minister** (*chén*) **institution** (*zhì*), **upper** (*shàng*) and **lower** (*xià*) **with boundaries** (*jiè*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of laws** (*jīng*) **in the** (*zhī*) **

The **ghosts and spirits** (*guǐshén*) **waste and ravage** (*hàohuāng*), **their forms** (*xiǎng*) **are without** (*wú*) **boundaries** (*fāng*).
They **know no winter nor summer** (*wú dōng wú xià*), **their sacrifices** (*jì*) **are without measure** (*wú dù*).
Thus, the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) **established** (*zhuó*) **them with rites** (*sìdiǎn*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **One** (*yī*) **Six** (*liù*).

**Timing the heavens** (*shí tiān*), **strengthening the earth** (*lì dì*).
**The five grains** (*wěi jiǔ*) **and the six kinds of food** (*wěi shí*), **thus cultivating** (*jiàn zuò jiàqǐng*) **the Five Cereals** (*wǔxià*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **Five** (*wǔ*) **Five** (*wǔ*).

In ancient times, **tortoiseshell** (*bǎo guī*) **was treasured** (*bǎo*) **and cowrie shells** (*huò bèi*) **were currency** (*bì*).
Later generations of **scholars** (*jūnzǐ*) **exchanged** (*yì*) **them for gold coins** (*jīnbì*), **to facilitate** (*yǐ tōng*) **the state** (*guójiā*) **and rely upon** (*wàn mín yǐ lài*) **the people** (*mín*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **thoughts** (*sī*).

All versions read **"thoughts and deliberations"** (*sīlǜ*), but **"deliberations"** (*lǜ*) seems to be a superfluous character.
**Establishing lords and opening kingdoms** (*jiàn hòu kāiguó*), **dissolving titles and ranking officials** (*huàn jié bān zhì*).
**To attract the myriad blessings** (*yǐ yǐn bǎi lù*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **blessing** (*fú*).

**Vexation** (*yuè yǎn*) **without order** (*bù lìng*), **the use of the Five Punishments** (*wéi yòng wǔ xíng*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **calamity** (*huò*).

**Holding the jade tablet** (*bǐng guī*), **wearing the jade conch** (*dài bì*), **displaying the ranks of the myriad ministers** (*lù cù qún bì*).
**Lù** pronounced as *lì jū* (力居切), **to array in order** (*chén xù*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **Eighty-One** (*bāshí yī*) **Chapters** (*shǒu*).

**Thornwood** (*jí mù*) **as shuttle** (*zhù*), **carved wood** (*xiāo mù*) **as spindle** (*zhóu*).
Once the **shuttle and spindle** (*zhùzhóu*) **were set in place** (*jì shī*), **the people obtained** (*mín dé yǐ*) **warmth** (*yàn*).
**Imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **warp and weft** (*jīngwěi*).

**Carving and cutting** (*diāo gē*) **the gourd** (*páo*), **bamboo** (*zhú*), **leather** (*gé*), **wood** (*mù*), **clay** (*tǔ*), **metal** (*jīn*), **striking stones** (*jī shí*) **and plucking silk** (*dàn sī*).
**To harmonize the world** (*yǐ hé tiānxià*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **Eight Winds** (*bā fēng*).

**Dīng** lacks the **"carving"** (*diāo*) character; other versions have only **"cutting"** (*gē*).
**Zhāng** reads **"engrave"** (*kè*).
**The *Shìwén*** (《释文》) reads **"then"** (*zé*), pronounced as *xuān*.

It says **"carving"** (*diāo*) is **one** (*yī*) **variant of "cutting"** (*gē*), **Sòng** and **Xǔ** read **"carving and cutting"** (*diāo gē*).
**Diāo** pronounced as *diāo*, **likely the same ancient character** (*gǎizì tóng*).

**Yin and Yang interweaving** (*yīn yáng xiāng cuò*), **men and women not crossing paths** (*nánnǚ bù xiāng shè*).
**People and things** (*rén wù*) **each follow their own kind** (*rù jué wéi huì*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **emptiness and abundance** (*xū yíng*).

**Sun and Moon interchanging** (*rì yuè xiāng hú*), **stars and constellations not colliding** (*xīng chén bù xiāng chù*).
**Sounds and rhythms** (*yīn lǜ*) **diverging in order** (*chā liè*), **odd and even** (*jī ǒu*) **contrasting in essence** (*yì qì*).
**Father and son differing in appearance** (*fù zǐ shū miàn*), **brothers not twins** (*xiōng dì bù luán*).
**Luán** pronounced as *shēng huàn* (生患切) and *suǒ juàn* (所眷切), **twins** (*shuāngshēng zǐ*).
**Sòng** reads **"breed"** (*zī*).

**No two emperors alike** (*dì wáng mò tóng*), **imitation** (*qiè nǐ*) **of the** (*zhī*) **year** (*suì*).

Those who gnash with teeth are hornless in youth,
Those who fly are two-footed in their limbs—
Without horns or wings, they are shaped by **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Way** (*dào*),
**Imitating** (*qiè nǐ*) the **nine days** of equal division.

To preserve what is seen and know what is hidden,
To approximate the near and infer the distant,
To probe the **Dao**’s boundless depths and fathom the **Divine’s** mysteries,
**Imitating** the **shadows and measures** (*guǐ kè*).

One bright, one obscure—
Falling into **rigidity**, falling into **softness**,
Those who know **yin** act in reverse,
Those who know **yang** flow with it—
**Imitating** the **day and night**.

Above and below, both seeking—
Following **Heaven’s** measure;
Past and future, both recounting—
Following **Heaven’s** method;
None dare alter or forge—
Following **Heaven’s** **flaws** (*chǒu*)—
**Imitating** the **Heavenly Principle** (*Tiān Yuán*).

**Heaven and Earth**, divine siblings, conform to the *Yì*’s law—
Endless, unceasing, the past concludes while the future begins,
**Imitating** the **Wú** (罔), **Zhí** (直), **Méng** (蒙), **Qiú** (酋), **Míng** (冥).

Thus, to **imitate** water in the river, water finds its tameness;
To **imitate** conduct in **virtue/power** (*dé*), conduct finds its center;
To **imitate** speech in **law**, speech finds its rectitude.
When speech is rectified, there is no rejection;
When conduct is centered, there is no deviation;
When water flows顺 (*shùn*), there is no ruin.
Without ruin, it endures;
Without deviation, it is observed;
Without rejection, it is heeded.
To be heeded is the **Sage’s** ultimate attainment;
To be observed is the **Sage’s** **virtue/power** (*dé*);
To endure is the **Way** of **Heaven and Earth**.

*(Chapter heading: "Business" [业])*

Thus, in ancient times, when the **Sages** undertook their works,
They **imitated** **Heaven** above, **Earth** below, and **humanity** within.
**Heaven and Earth** formed the **case** (*hán*), **Sun and Moon** fixed their brilliance,
The **Five Phases** encompassed **flaws** (*chǒu*), the **Five Peaks** dominated the mountains,
The **Four Seas** lengthened the rivers, the **Five Classics** grasped the **squares** (*jǔ*).
When **Heaven** rebels, **Earth** rebels, **humanity** rebels,
Then the great affairs of the world are perverted.

The **Mysterious’s** praise-words are all **imitations**.
**Qi** generates **kinds**, **kinds** generate the **hurried** (*jié zú*) of affairs—
Truly, they follow the **Three Models** (*sān mó*).
Observing all the **imitations**’ (*qiè nǐ*) purposes,
One may glimpse the **praise’s** intent,
Though not exhausting their **gatherings** (*huì*), one attains **comparative meaning** (*bǐ yì*).

Reflect with **emptiness** (*xū*), weigh **calamity and blessing** to adapt—
Like **gold coins** circulating through the world.
Assembling all **lords** (*bì*), **imitating** the **eighty-one heads** (*shǒu*),
Then only the **essence** (*tǐ*) remains.
The **Mysterious Ultimate** (*Xuán Jī*) is supreme—
Presiding over this **emptiness and abundance** (*xū yíng*), within a single **day and night**,
Yet the **year’s** cycles are complete, the **Way**’s shifts differing yet never conflicting.
But the **essence** has great and small—
Thus the **imitations** have **Mysterious Chapters** (*Xuán Zhāng*).
The **Mysterious**, with two heads, equally divides the **nine days**—
Profit cannot be monopolized; this is **Heaven’s Way**.

The **Mysterious Classic’s** symbolic words
Truly **imitate** the **shadows and measures** (*guǐ kè*), **day and night**,
And number the **Heavenly Principle** (*Tiān Yuán*).
The **Heavenly Principle** is where the **cycles**, **chapters**, and **statutes** converge.

The *Yì* says:
*"Exhausted, it transforms; transformed, it flows; flowing, it endures."*
**Wú** and **Méng**—truly the **divine siblings**.
Beginning and end, unceasing—
This follows the *Yì* thus.

**The Ninth Chapter of the *Tàixuān Wén*’s *Qiè Nǐ* concludes.**
#1 *"Day"* (*rì*) originally *"Say"* (*yuē*), corrected per the **Fan** edition.
#2 *"Un"* (*wèi*) originally *"End"* (*mò*), corrected per the **Fan** edition.

---
**The Tenth Chapter of the *Tàixuān Tú*’s *Gào* begins.**
**The *Xuán Tú***

**The Third Transformation of the *Xuán Tú***

The **One Primordial** covers the **Three Directions**—
Each **Direction** mirrors the **Nine Provinces**,
Branches bear the **Multitudes of Departments**,
Divisions govern the **Clans of Families**—
All affairs dwell within.

The **Yin Essence** aligns with the **Northern Dipper**,
While **Day and Moon** trace their **boundaries**.
**Yin and Yang** interweave in **hidden exchange**,
The **Four Seasons** lurk in **latent abode**.
The **Five Phases** move in **concealed courses**,
The **Six Extremes** blend in **harmony**,
The **Seven Mansions** pivot on the **axis**.

**Taming the Profound**, the **Nine Nines** manifest—
**Six Jia** internalized, **Lü** and **Yue** in **hidden resonance**.
**Law and Measure** conceal their **cycles**.

*The Diagram’s Image* extols the **Primordial Form**,
Praising the **fulfillment of success**.

**First**, the **Central Excess** follows—
A hundred **plants** sway in **procession**,
Then **heaven is questioned**.
*Question* (*xùn*) is homophonous with *Swift*.
**Thunder** shakes the **procession’s side**,
**Zhen** resounds—*Zhen* pronounced as *Jin*.
*The procession’s side*—Ding’s *yú* reads *yǔ*.

**Yin** praises the **gentle subtlety**,
**Uprooting** from the **Primordial**.
The **East stirs the Azure Dragon**,
Its **light departs from the Abyss**.
**Crushing** all **ten thousand things**,
**Heaven and Earth** renew their **procession**.
*—* The **cut** (*tuī*) is **urgent** and **piercing**.

**Central**, the **Expanded Vision**—
**Heaven’s weight** shines **double-bright**,
**Thunder and Wind** dazzle in **radiance**,
Moving with **all things in season**.
The **Yin Chief** dominates the **West-North**,
The **Yang** lingers in the **East-South**.
Though **internal responses** exist,
**External resistance** meets **rigid constancy**.
The **Dragon** stands firm in **Heaven**,
Its **length** boundless—
**Southward conquest** brings **disaster**,
**Encountering the Shattered Light**.
*Chapter* reads *"Encounter the Shattered Light"* (*yù hū bēng guāng*),
*Sòng* reads *"Encounter at the Shattered Light"* (*yù yú bēng guāng*).

**Final**, the **Diminished Depth**—
**Heaven’s Root** returns **inward**,
**Qi** refines, **essence** condenses.
**Surveying** all **multitudes**,
Each **bows in hardship**.
**Deeply merging** with **Yellow Purity**,
**Broadly containing** all **life**,
The **Great Handle** clouds **in motion**,
**Timely overseeing** the **Earth’s design**.
**Perverse schemes** ascend in **absorption**,
Then **tame the numinous spirits**,
**Encompassing** **beginning and end**—
**Heaven, Earth, and Human** virtues all **rigid and constant**.

This is the **third transformation** of the *Xuán Tú*.
**Directions, Provinces, Departments, Families**—
**One, Two, One-Two, Four**—
While the **Primordial** dwells within—
This is called **"Five merging with the Void."**

**Thunder shakes** #1;
*The procession’s side* is **Lún**—
The **Pheasant’s cry** in **late winter** responds.

**Yin** praises the **gentle subtlety**,
**Uprooting** from the **Primordial**—
The **Great Cluster’s qi**.
The **East stirs the Azure Dragon**,
Its **light departs from the Abyss**—
Then **dissolution** follows.

At the **rigid constancy’s hour**,
The **Dragon** seeks only **proliferation**—
**Conquest** then brings **disaster**.

**Heaven’s Root** returns—
The **One’s reversal**,
From **difficult cultivation**.
**Deeply merging** with **Yellow Purity**—
Then **restored to the Center**.
The **Great Handle** clouds **in motion**,
**Timely overseeing** the **Earth’s design**—
The **Dipper’s revolution** aligns the **Five Celestial Stems**.
**Perverse schemes** ascend in **absorption**,
Then **tame the numinous spirits**—
Thus **praising fulfillment of success**,
**Planning and seizing**—
Nothing remains unattained.

Hence, it **tames the numinous spirits** without **contradiction**,
**Encompasses** **beginning and end**—
All **virtues** are **rigid and constant**.

**Heaven’s field** is its **Way**,
**Earth’s** its **threads**.
*Rú* (*zhì*), pronounced *zhí-zhǐ*.
*The Odes* say:
*"Split the firewood, stack it up"* #2—
Meaning **follow its principle**.

**Yin and Yang** intermingle in **proximity**,
Some **male**, some **female**.
**Heaven’s Way** forms **rules**,
**Earth’s Way** forms **measures**.
**Rules** move in **circular process**,
**Measures** rest in **stability**.
**Circular process** thus attains **numinous clarity**,
**Stability** thus gathers **kindred types**.
**Kindred types** thus **enrich**,
**Numinous clarity** thus **ascends to nobility**.

The **Primordial**—
**Heaven’s Way**, **Earth’s Way**, **Human Way**—
**Combining the Three Ways**, it is named **Heaven**.
The **Way of Sovereign and Minister, Father and Son, Husband and Wife**.
**Extending** the **Way of Sovereign and Minister, Father and Son, Husband and Wife**,
It **unites with Heaven**.

The **Primordial** has **two Ways**:
*Sòng* reads: *"The Primordial with **one Way**,
**Three births**, **one origin**,
**One generating three**."*
**One origin**—
**Directions, Provinces, Departments, Families**.
**One generating three**,
**One originating three**—
**Directions, Provinces, Departments, Families**.
**Three births**—
**Triple-parting the Yang Qi**,
Forming **three layers**, extreme as **nine encampments**.
This is **"same root, divergent ends."**
*Fàn* reads: *"Same root, divergent births."*
*Chapter* reads *"say"* (*yuē*), *birth* (*shēng*).
*Lín* reads *birth* (*shēng*), *same root* (*tóng běn*), *divergent ends* (*lí shēng*).

**The Essence of Heaven and Earth**.
**Laterally communicating** **above and below**—
All **things converge**.
**Nine encampments** flow **circularly**—
**Beginning and end** are **rigid and constant**.
**Beginning** in the **eleventh month**,
**Ending** in the **tenth month**,
**Luo** repeats **nine courses**,
Each **forty days**.

**Sincerity within** resides in the **Center**,
**Propagated outward** resides in the **Excess**,
**Cloud-motion, rain-bestowal** resides in the **Following**,
**Changing nodes, shifting degrees** resides in the **Reversion**,
**Precious light, pure completeness** resides in the **Vision**—
*Pure completeness*—*Chapter* reads *"pure gold"* (*chún jīn*).
**Void within, vast without** resides in the **Expansion**,
**Trimming, retreat, consumption** resides in the **Diminution**,
**Descending, concealing** resides in the **Depth**—
*Queue* (*duì*) pronounced *duì* (as *zhuì*).
**Examining the terminal nature** resides in the **Completion**.

Thus, **One to Nine**—
The **Yin-Yang ebb-and-flow’s calculation**—
Reversed and displayed:
**Child**—**Yang** is born in the **eleventh month**,
**Yin** terminates in the **tenth month**—visible.
**Wu**—**Yin** is born in the **fifth month**,
**Yang** terminates in the **fourth month**—visible.
**Generating Yang** is none greater than **Child**,
**Generating Yin** is none greater than **Wu**.
**West-North**—**Child’s** beauty is **exhausted**,
**East-South**—**Wu’s** beauty is **extreme**.

Thus, **contemplate the Heart at One**,
**Reflect repeatedly at Two**,
**Fulfill intent at Three**,
**Unfurl clarity at Four**,
**Manifest brilliance at Five**,
**Reach grandeur at Six**,
**Decay and loss at Seven**,
**Peeling and falling at Eight**,
**Extinction at Nine**.

**Generating the numinous** is none earlier than **One**,
**Central harmony** is none greater than **Five**,
**Arrogance and excess** are none more constrained than **Nine**.

「**Arrogance (倨)**, pronounced *jù*, means proud.
**Swiftness (勋)**, pronounced *xūn*, means hasty.

Guo Yuanheng’s commentary: **Excess (剧)** is used instead of *勋*.

As for **One (一)**, it is the subtle beginning of contemplation.
**Four (四)** is the foundation of fortune.
**Seven (七)** is the threshold of misfortune.

**Three (三)** is the peak of contemplation,
**Six (六)** is the zenith of fortune,
**Nine (九)** is the exhaustion of misfortune.

**Two (二), Five (五), and Eight (八)** are the midpoints of the three phases—fortune advances, misfortune withdraws.

**Nine (九)** is the void where the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** are arranged, the **Noble (君子)** and the **Petty (小人)** alike using it as their **palace (宫)**.

From **One (一)** to **Three (三)**, one endures poverty and lowliness while the heart labors.
From **Four (四)** to **Six (六)**, one attains wealth and nobility with honor and height.
From **Seven (七)** to **Nine (九)**, one avoids calamity but falls into ruin.

Below **Five (五)**, one follows the **principle of nurturing (作息)**;
Above **Five (五)**, one follows the **principle of diminishing (作消)**.

When the count is high, one sees nobility but is truly depleted;
When the count is low, one sees lowliness but is truly abundant.

All (作) is either **void and excess (虚饶)** or **substance and excess (实饶)**—
**Nurturing (息)** and **diminishing (消)** are intertwined,
Nobility (贵) and lowliness (贱) are exchanged.

Fortune arrives while misfortune departs;
Misfortune arrives while fortune flees.

**Xu (许)** and **Huang (黄)** omit the line *"Fortune arrives..."*.
**Song (宋)** and **Ding (丁)** place *"Misfortune arrives..."* above.

Here, we follow the **Zhou (章)** text.

The **Dao/Way (道)** is profound yet lowly, extreme yet elevated.
**Day (昼)** and **night (夜)** alternate—**marriage (夫妇)** is their bond.
**End and beginning (终始)** generate each other—**parent and child (父子)** perpetuate this.
**Sun and Moon (日月)** unite and separate—**ruler and minister (君臣)** fulfill their duty.
**First and last (孟季)** follow order—**senior and junior (长幼)** observe their boundaries.
**Pairs (两两)** complement each other—**friends (朋友)** gather thus.

One **day (日)** is made of one **daytime (昼)** and one **nighttime (夜)**.
One **Yin (阴)** and one **Yang (阳)** generate all **ten thousand things (万物)**.

When daytime counts are high and nighttime counts are low,
The **Zhou (章)** text also notes extended day and shortened night—**divergence (衍)**.

**Song (宋)** states: *"Daytime counts are high, nighttime counts are low."*
**Symbol (象)** observes the Moon’s waxing and the Sun’s waning.

When the **Noble (君子)** acts with radiance and the **Petty (小人)** acts in obscurity,
The **Dao/Way (道)** of the **Noble (君子)** is complete,
While the **Dao/Way (道)** of the **Petty (小人)** is lacking.

To **begin (始)** with the **Three (三)** is structured—**position (位)** is thus established.
To **generate (生)** with the **Three (三)** is boundless—**Qi (气)** thus creates and transforms.

The **Three (三)** divide **Yang Qi (阳气)** into **beginning (始), middle (中), and end (终)**.
The **Nine Heavens (九天)** revolve in cycles—
**Beginning (始)** at the **first day of the eleventh month (十一月朔旦)**, the **Winter Solstice (冬至)**,
While the **middle (中)** aligns with it.

After **forty-five days (四十日半)**, the **Great Cold (大寒)**, then **Xian (羡)** aligns with it.
Again after **forty-five days (四十日半)**, **Awakening of Insects (惊蛰)**, then **Cong (从)** aligns with it.
Then **Grain Rain (谷雨)**, **Xiao (賥)** aligns with it;
**Lesser Fullness (小满)**, **Kuo (廓)** aligns with it;
**Lesser Heat (小暑)**, **Jian (减)** aligns with it;
**Dewey Heat (处暑)**, **Chen (沈)** aligns with it;
**Autumnal Equinox (秋分)**, **Cheng (成)** aligns with it;
**Established Winter (立冬)**, completing the **Qi (气)** of the cycle.

The **Nine Heavens (九天)** total **three hundred sixty-four and a half days (日)**, and thus the year is fulfilled.

When the **day (日)** advances **forty-five days (四十日)**, its halves diverge—**this is how Heaven’s revolutions (运)** occur.

**Three (三)** are divided into **four (四)**, reaching **eighty-one (八十一)**;
**Nine (九)** are arranged in **three (三) and six (六)**, reaching **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)**.

Thus, from **beginning (始), middle (中), and end (终)**,
To **contemplate (思), fortune (福), and misfortune (祸)**,
To exhaust the **calculations of Yin and Yang (阴阳消息之计)**.

**Profound (玄)** encompasses **three hundred sixty-four nights (夜)** and **three hundred sixty-five days (昼)**,
This is **daytime counts high, nighttime counts low—Yang in excess, Yin in depletion (阳饶而阴乏)**.

**One (一)** and **Six (六)** share the same **root (宗)**;
**Two (二)** and **Seven (七)** are **companions (朋)**;
**Three (三)** and **Eight (八)** form **harmony (友)**;
**Four (四)** and **Nine (九)** follow the same **Dao/Way (道)**;
**Five (五)** guards itself with **Five (五)**.

**Profound (玄)** has **one ruler (规), one measure (矩), one cord (绳), one standard (准)**,
To conform to the **crossing Dao/Way (横天地之道)**,
To tame the **numbers of Yin and Yang (阴阳之数)**,
To emulate their **numinous brilliance (神明)**,
To illuminate their **profound darkness (幽昏)**.

Then the **Dao/Way (道)** of the **eight directions (八方)** can be discerned.

**Three (三)** and **Eight (八)** form the **ruler (规)**;
**Four (四)** and **Nine (九)** form the **measure (矩)**;
**Two (二)** and **Seven (七)** form the **cord (绳)**;
**One (一)** and **Six (六)** form the **standard (准)**.

With **boundaries (界)** distinguished and **corners (辨)** divided,
The **Dao/Way (道)** of the **eight directions (八方)** can be discerned.

**Profound (玄)** has the **number of Six Nine (六九)**,
**Strategy (策)** uses **Three Six (三六)**,
**Ceremony (仪)** uses **Two Nine (二九)**.
**Profound (玄)** employs **eighteen (十有八)** in its calculations!

The **essence of Tai (泰积)** begins with **eighteen strategies (十有八策)**,
Ends with **fifty-four (五十有四)**.

Combining the **beginning (始)** and **end (终)** strategies,
Half of it is **Tai’s center (泰中)**.

The **strategies of Tai’s center (泰中)** are **thirty-six (三十有六)**,
Used to govern **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)**,
Totaling **twenty-six thousand two hundred forty-four strategies (策)** for the **Tai cycle (泰积)**.

**Seventy-two strategies (策)** make one day,
Totaling **three hundred sixty-four and a half days (日)**,
Filling the **year (岁)** and aligning with its **days (日)** while governing the **calendar (历)**.

Thus, from **Child (子)** to **Chen (辰)**,
From **Chen (辰)** to **Shen (申)**,
From **Shen (申)** to **Child (子)**, crowned with **Jia (甲)**,
And **Zhou (章), Hui (会), Tong (统), Yuan (元)** all vanish together with **eclipses (月食)**—this is the **Profound Dao/Way (玄之道)**.

**Ding (丁)** and **Song (宋)** state: *"Vanish with eclipses (月食没), the fullness of the **Profound Dao/Way (玄道)**."*
**Zhou (章)** states: *"Vanish with **moon’s occultation (月蚀)**—this is the fullness of the **Profound Dao/Way (玄之道)**."*

Heaven uses **Six (六)** as **nodes (节)**—**Yin within Yang (阳中之阴)**.
Earth uses **Nine (九)** to **govern gatherings (制会)**—**Yang within Yin (阴中之阳)**.
**Yin and Yang (阴阳)** transform and interact—**thus utility and life (利用生)** arise.

**Strategy (策)** mirrors **Heaven’s numbers (天数)**,
Earth **conforms (仪)** to Heaven and **matches (匹)** it,
Humans **observe the law (法)** therein.

Thus, its numbers begin with **eighteen strategies (十有八策)**,
End with **fifty-four (五十有四)**.

The **numbers of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (天地人数)**,
**Begin and end (始终)** in alignment,
And **Profound (玄)** takes **eighteen strategies (十有八)** as its **root (宗)**.

Thus, combining **fifty-four (五十有四)** to make **seventy-two (七十有二)**,
This is the **strategy (策)** of one **day (日)** and one **night (夜)**.

And one **year (岁)** mirrors this,
So **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)** are governed by **Tai’s center (泰中)** at **thirty-six (三十有六)**.

Each **cycle (赞)** has **thirty-six strategies (策)**,
Accumulating to **twenty-six thousand two hundred forty-four strategies (策)** to complete the year.

**Zhou (章), Xian (羡), Cong (从)** from **Child (子)** to **Chen (辰)**,
**Geng (更), Meng (睟), Kuo (廓)** from **Chen (辰)** to **Shen (申)**,
**Jian (减), Chen (沈), Cheng (成)** from **Shen (申)** to **Child (子)**—
These are the **four phases (方)** of one year.

And **four thousand six hundred seventeen years (岁)** mirror this pattern.

**Nineteen years (十九岁)** form one **Zhou (章)**,
**Twenty-seven chapters (二十七章)** form one **Hui (会)**,
**Three gatherings (三会)** form one **Tong (统)**,
**Three cycles (三统)** form one **Yuan (元)**.

**Tong (统)** totals **one thousand five hundred thirty-nine years (岁)**,
**Jiazi (甲子)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Heaven’s cycle (天统)**,
**Jiachen (甲辰)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Earth’s cycle (地统)**,
**Jia Shen (甲申)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Human’s cycle (人统)**—
Mirroring the **Profound (玄)**’s **three phases (三方)**.

When eclipses vanish together with the moon, the **Tong (统)** encompasses **eighty-one chapters (章)**, the **Yuan (元)** encompasses **nine gatherings (会)**, and each gathering exhausts the count of lunar eclipses.

Lunar eclipses are the **fullness of numbers (数之盈)**.
Lu Ji (陆绩) said: *"Divide the total of one **Yuan (元)** by nine gatherings, and it will be fully exhausted."*

When the **intercalary division (闰分)** of one **chapter (章)** is complete, when the lunar eclipses of one **gathering (会)** are exhausted, when the **new moon divisions (朔分)** of one **Tong (统)** are complete, and when the **six Jia (六甲)** of one **Yuan (元)** are fulfilled—

The **Profound (玄)** reveals:
The **Profound (玄)** generates **two divine forms (神象二)**,
The **two divine forms** generate **the standard (规)**,
The **standard** generates **three models (三摹)**,
The **three models** generate **nine foundations (九据)**.

The **Profound (玄)** refines once and attains **Heaven (天)**, hence it is called **Nine Heavens (九天)**.
*(Later editions read "nine" instead of "have." Earth and Human follow the same.)*
Refined twice, it attains **Earth (地)**, hence it is called **Nine Earths (九地)**.
Refined thrice, it attains **Human (人)**, hence it is called **Nine Humans (九人)**.

Heaven completes in **three foundations (三据)**, hence it is called **Beginning, Middle, End (始、中、终)**.
Earth takes form in **three foundations**, hence it is called **Below, Middle, Above (下、中、上)**.
Human manifests in **three foundations**, hence it is called **Thought, Fortune, Calamity (思、福、祸)**.

*"Below inhales, above exhales"*—**hūhéqiè (呼合切)**, as in *"yìn (歠)"* in the *Shuōwén (说文)*.
It traverses the **Nine Voids (九虚)**;
Through **small and great threads (小索大索)**, it revolves **nine degrees (九度)**.

The **Profound (玄)** is the **leader of the divine (神之魁)**.
Heaven’s **Profound (玄)** is unseen,
Earth’s **Profound (玄)** is formless,
Human’s **Profound (玄)** is the **heart and abdomen**.

Heaven’s **mystic orifice (奥)** is the **west-north (西北)**, where **dense transformations refine essence (郁化精)**.
Earth’s **mystic orifice** is **Huángquán (黄泉)**—*(later editions read "Huángyuān (黄渊)")*—
This is the **hidden soul and glory (隐魄荣)**.
Human’s **mystic orifice** is **thought and deliberation (思虑)**, containing the **ultimate essence (至精)**.
*(Later editions read "合 (harmony)" instead of "含 (contain)")*.

Heaven’s **vault (穹)** is arched and encircles below,
Earth’s **flanks (旁薄)** lean upward,
Human **dwells (处)** in between.
*(Later editions read "苠 (jì)" instead of the obscured character.)*

Heaven is **pure and unrestrained (浑)**, hence its motion is ceaseless.
Earth is **decayed and still (颓而静)**, hence its generation is not delayed.
Human is **tamed by Heaven and Earth (驯乎天地)**, hence its actions are inexhaustible.

Heaven and Earth oppose each other,
The sun and moon **intersect (相刿)**,
Mountains and rivers **flow toward each other (相流)**,
Light and heavy **float in balance (相浮)**,
Yin and yang **weave (相绩)**,
Superior and inferior **do not transgress (不相黩)**.

Thus, Earth is **hollowed (坎)** while Heaven is **stern (严)**,
The moon **hurries (遄)** while the sun **lingers (湛)**.

The **Five Phases** alternately reign,
The **Four Seasons** never peak together.
The sun **shines brightly (昱)** in the day,
The moon **shines brightly (昱)** in the night;
**Mǎo (昴)** ascends in winter,
**Fire** ascends in summer.

South and north **fix their positions (定位)**,
East and west **communicate qi (通气)**,
All things **intertwine within (错离)**.

The **Profound (玄)** manifests **one virtue (一德)** and generates **Five Births (五生)**,
It manifests **one punishment (一刑)** and generates **Five Subductions (五克)**.
*(Later editions include "玄" before "一刑.")*

The **Five Births** do not **exhaust each other (不相殄)**,
The **Five Subductions** do not **contradict each other (不相逆)**.
Not exhausting allows **succession (相继)**,
Not contradicting allows **governance (相治)**.
Succession is the **Way of parent and child (父子之道)**,
Governance is the **treasure of ruler and subject (君臣之宝)**.

From the **Profound Darkness (玄冥)**, **divine light (神光)** emerges,
Hence the **two divine forms (神象二)**.
The **two movements (二运)** are boundless,
Thus the **standard (规)** is generated.
The **standard** is **modeled threefold (三摹)**,
And **Heaven’s Profound (天玄)**, **Earth’s Profound (地玄)**, and **Human’s Profound (人玄)** are attained.

A **model (摹)** must have **foundations (据)** to establish itself,
Hence the **nine foundations (九据)** extend to **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十有九)**.

The **nine praises (九赞)** are the **three ultimate Ways (三极之道)**.

Heaven’s **mystic orifice (奥)** in the west-north
Refines **hidden essence (化精)** in the **chaotic void (混沌无端)**.
Earth’s **mystic orifice** in **Huángquán (黄泉)**
Ensures **nothing is absent within (信无不在乎中)**,
Where **all things’ refined qi (精气)** hides.
This is the **hidden soul and glory (魄荣)**, the **time of obscurity (罔之时)**.

What is called **"conceal Heaven to become Heaven (潜天而天)"**,
**"conceal Earth to become Earth (潜地而地)"**—
This is the **ultimate of these orifices (极此奥)**.

The **Profound (玄)** is thus manifested,
Yet humans seek to **craft it (造之)**.
If not abandoning **material things (遗物)** and **separating from humanity (离人)**,
And if **refined thought (精思)** does not **transcend (超诣)**,
Then none can enter.

**Suǒ (摛)** said:
*"To defy is impossible, silence attains its essence (默则得其所)."*
This is the **Profound essence (玄要)**.

When the **Profound (玄)** is attained, **divine clarity (神明)** generates it,
Then **all changes of motion and stillness (动静之变)** are **Profound affairs (玄事)**;
**Rest and calamity, beauty and ugliness (休咎好丑)** are all **Profound laws (玄法)**.

When Heaven and Earth **open and close (阖辟)**,
All things **arise together (并兴)**,
Yet the **Profound remains unmoved (玄不动)**.
If **carved and etched (若雕若刻)**,
**Generations transform endlessly (生生化化)**,
Yet the **Profound does nothing (玄无为)**.
To **analyze desires and guide wisdom (析愿迪哲)**,
To **command deceit and destroy depravity (诏奸陨慝)**,
To **organize all measures (百度厘举)**—
Yet the **Profound does not resist (玄莫违)**.

From **beginning to end (始终)**, they **intertwine (相纠)**,
From **ancient to present (古今)**, they **oscillate (相荡)**,
The **Tong and Yuan are endless (统元无尽)**,
Yet the **Profound does not pass (玄不逝)**.

Is this not what is said:
*"All things are complete within me,
The Dao-heart is only subtle (道心惟微)?"*

The **Non-dual (不二)** is the **constant of the Profound (玄之常)**;
The **dual (凡二)** is the **variation of the divine (神之变)**.

The **Profound** records the **"Book of the Dipper (斗书)"**—*(later editions read "Profound Dipper Book (玄日斗书)")*—
Yet the moon is not recorded,
Always **full (常满)**, to **counter the void (以御虚)**.
*(Later editions include "日 (sun)" before "常满.")*

When a year is **complete and serene (宁悉)**, the **season is diseased (年病)**.
In **nineteen years (十九年)**, there are **seven intercalations (七闰)**—
This is **Heaven’s compensation (天之偿)**.

Yang **moves and exhales (动吐)**,
Yin **stills and inhales (静翕)**;
The **Way of Yang is always abundant (阳道常饶)**,
The **Way of Yin is always deficient (阴道常乏)**—
This is the **Way of Yin and Yang (阴阳之道)**.
*(Later editions read "阳动而吐，阴静而翕.")*

When Heaven is **strong and healthy (强健)**, it **soars high (侨躆)**—
*"Sōu (侨)"* is pronounced *"qú xiāo (渠消)"* (high),
Or it may be read as *"luó (蹻)"* (reside outside), *"jū biǎo (居表)"*.
*"Dù (躆)"* is pronounced *"jù (据)"*.

A day and night **self-renew with surplus (自复而有余)**.
The sun has **south and north (南有北)**,
The moon has **forward and return (往有来)**.
If the sun **neither goes south nor north (不南不北)**,
Then there is **no winter nor summer (无冬无夏)**;
If the moon **neither goes forward nor returns (不往不来)**,
Then the **full and new moons do not form (望晦不成)**.

The **Sage observes** the **variations of hidden and revealed (脁朒侧匿)**—
*"Zhuì (脁)"* is pronounced *"chù liǎo (敕了)"*.
*(Later editions omit "朒," reading only "脁.")*
And **regulates the sequence of solar and lunar gender (日月雌雄之序)**,
Establishing it **without end (经之於无已)**.

Thus, the **Profound** **weaves the celestial threads (鸿纶天元)**,
**Binding (娄)** and **restraining (钳)** what is to come—
*(Later editions read "拙将来者乎" instead of "钳之.")*
*"Hù (乎)"* may also be read as *"yě (也)"*.

**Three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter (三百六十五度四分度之一)**
Complete the **circuit of Heaven (周乎天)**.
A year of **twelve months** advances **three hundred fifty-four degrees and a tenth (凡行三百五十四度而十度四分度之一)**
And enters the **following year (入於嗣岁)**.

「The so-called *intercalary month* (**閏**, *rùn*) is the accumulation of this *oddity* (**奇**, *qí*).

When the movement does not reach the **full measure of Heaven’s degrees** (**天度**, *tiāndù*), then this year is **deficient** (**病**, *bìng*).
Therefore, an **intercalary month** is added to compensate for it.
In **nineteen years**, seven **intercalary months** (**七閏**, *qī rùn*) are applied,
And thus the **year is made complete** (**岁宁悉**, *suì níngxī*).

The **Profound Dao** (**玄经**, *Xuánjīng*) mirrors the **year’s progression** (**岁**, *suì*), hence it is said:
*"Eighty-one chapters"* (**八十一首**, *bāshíyī shǒu*), and all **matters of the year are perfected** (**岁事咸贞**, *suìshì xiánzhēng*).
When **completeness is without deficiency** (**宁无不安**, *níng wú bù’ān*) and **perfection is without excess** (**悉无不足**, *xī wú bùzú*), this is the **fulfillment of the canon** (**章之成**, *zhāng zhī chéng*).

*"Zhuì"* (**脁**, *zhuì*) refers to the **Moon’s swift movement** (**月行疾**, *yuè xíngjí*);
*"Nǎi"* (**朒**, *nǎi*) refers to the **Moon’s slow movement** (**月行迟**, *yuè xíngchí*).
When the **waning phase is visible in the west**, it is called *"Zhuì"* (**晦见于西谓之脁**, *huì jiàn yú xī wèi zhī zhuì*);
When the **new moon is visible in the east**, it is called *"Nǎi"* (**朔见于东谓之朒**, *shuò jiàn yú dōng wèi zhī nǎi*).

*"Sè"* (**侧**, *sè*) and *"Nì"* (**匿**, *nì*) refer to **deviations from its proper course** (**失正行**, *shī zhèngxíng*).
When **the Great is without bounds** (**大无方**, *Dà wúfāng*) and **the Easy is without fixed times** (**易无时**, *Yì wúshí*), then **it becomes the realm of spirits and ghosts** (**神鬼**, *shén guǐ*).
*(Later editions read "大无方无时，然后为鬼神" instead of "大无方，易无时，然后为神鬼也," omitting the "也" and treating "神鬼" as "鬼神.")*

The **Divine** **concludes at the Six Canons** (**神终乎六宗**, *shén zhōng hū liù zōng*).
*(Later editions: "游" [yóu] for "宗"; "斿" [zhuì] in Huang’s text—likely an ancient variant.)*
**The vital essence animates all things** (**魂魂万物**, *hún hún wànwù*), ever **moving and surging** (**动而常冲**, *dòng ér cháng chōng*).

Thus, the **Profound Dao’s discourse** (**玄之辞**, *Xuán zhī cí*) is:
**Deep** to **plumb the depths** (**沉以穷乎下**, *chén yǐ qióng hū xià*);
**Light** to **reach the heights** (**浮以际乎上**, *fú yǐ jì hū shàng*);
**Curve** to **attain straightness** (**曲而端**, *qū ér duān*);
**Scatter** yet **to gather** (**散而聚**, *sàn ér jù*).
Its **greatness** is not **fully tasted** (**美也不尽於味**, *měi yě bù jìn yú wèi*);
Its **magnitude** is not **exhausted in its expanse** (**大也不尽其汇**, *dà yě bù jìn qí huì*).

**Above and below are interconnected** (**上连下连**, *shàng lián xià lián*), yet **not confined to one direction** (**非一方也**, *fēi yī fāng yě*).
**Near and far have no fixed measure** (**远近无常**, *yuǎn jìn wú cháng*), proceeding **according to kind** (**以类行也**, *yǐ lèi xíng yě*).
Sometimes **abundant**, sometimes **sparse** (**或多或寡**, *huò duō huò guǎ*), yet all **affairs are adapted to clarity** (**事适乎明也**, *shì shì hū míng yě*).

Thus, those who speak well of **Heaven and Earth** use **human affairs** (**善言天地者以人事**, *shàn yán tiāndì zhě yǐ rénshì*);
Those who speak well of **human affairs** use **Heaven and Earth** (**善言人事以天地**, *shàn yán rénshì yǐ tiāndì*).

**Full and new moons** **alternate in succession** (**明晦相推**, *mínghuì xiāng tuī*), while **Sun and Moon** **progress beyond measure** (**而日月逾迈**, *ér rìyuè yú mài*).
**Year after year** **swells in resonance** (**岁岁相荡**, *suìsuì xiāng dàng*), and **Heaven and Earth** **are ever more nurtured** (**而天地弥陶**, *ér tiāndì mí táo*).

This is what is meant by **the Divine and the Bright are inexhaustible** (**之谓神明不穷**, *zhī wèi shén míng bù qióng*).
The **root origin** is **difficult to follow** (**原本者难由**, *yuánběn zhě nányóu*);
The **later branches** are **easy to conform to** (**流末者易从**, *liú mò zhě yì cóng*).

Thus, those who uphold the **Six Canons** are praised for **filial piety** (**有宗祖者则称乎孝**, *yǒu zōngzǔ zhě zé chēng hū xiào*);
Those who order **sovereign and minister** are praised for **loyalty** (**序君臣者则称乎忠**, *xù junchén zhě zé chēng hū zhōng*).
This is the **true proclamation of the Great Instruction** (**实告大训**, *shí gào dà xùn*).

The **Profound Dao’s discourse** is **to exhaust the Divine** (**玄之辞以尽神而已**, *Xuán zhī cí yǐ jìn shén ér yǐ*).
The **Divine generates loyalty and filial piety** (**玄神生忠孝**, *Xuán shén shēng zhōngxiào*);
**Loyalty and filial piety generate benevolence and righteousness** (**忠孝生仁义**, *zhōngxiào shēng rén yì*).

Who would not **practice benevolence** (**孰不为仁**, *shú bù wéi rén*)?
Who would not **embrace righteousness** (**孰不为义**, *shú bù wéi yì*)?

「Thus, its foundation is such that it can remain undiluted. When the **Dao of day and night** (*zhòuyè zhī dào*) is unclear, the affairs of **the Junzi** (*君子*) and **the petty person** (*小人*) become intertwined, then those called **benevolent** (*rén*) may fail to distinguish three times out of ten, and those called **righteous** (*yì*) may enter into what is not righteous without discernment. This would cause conduct to lose its **pure virtue** (*chún dé*), which is not the **true order of Heaven’s command** (*tiān mìng zhī zhèng*).

The **Profound Dao** (*Xuán*) proclaims the **Great Instruction** (*dà xùn*), and thus **correctness prevails** (*zhèng shèng yǐ*).

The **Eleven Chapters** (*Yòu shíyī piān*) are elucidated with the *Exegesis* (*Shìwén*), sourced from Xu Han’s *Phonetic Examination* (*Yīnkǎo*). The **Wang** refers to **Tang Wang Yi** (*王即唐王涯*); the **Chen** refers to **modern Chen Jian** (*陈即近世陈渐*), who compiled *The Performance of the Profound* (*Yǎn Xuán*); the **Wu** refers to **Wu Bi** (*吴秘*), who authored *Phonetic Meanings* (*Yīnyì*); the **Guo** refers to **Guo Yuanheng** (*郭元亨*), who composed *Commentary* (*Shū*); the **Ding** refers to **Ding Wei** (*丁谓*), the **Xu** to **Xu Ang** (*许昂*), the **Zhang** to **Zhang Cha** (*章察*), the **Huang** to **Huang Boshi** (*黄伯思*), and the **Lin** to **Lin Yu**’s edition (*林瑀本*), as stated.

The **Great Profound** (*Tài Xuán*) aligns with the **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*). In the **Tài Chū Upper Yuan** (*Tài Chū Shàng Yuán*), the **first month of the first year (Jiazi)** (*正月甲子*), on the **new moon and winter solstice** (*shuò dàn dōng zhì*), there is no excess fraction. After **1,539 years** (*hòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*), in the year **Jiachen** (*甲辰*), the new moon and winter solstice again align without excess. Another **1,539 years** (*yòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*) returns to the **Jiazi** alignment, without excess.

**Nineteen years** (*shí jiǔ suì*) constitute **one chapter** (*yī zhāng*), and **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*) amount to **513 years** (*wǔ bǎi yī shí sān suì*), forming **one cycle** (*yī huì*). A **cycle** (*huì*) is the completion of the **interaction of sun and moon** (*rìyuè jiāohuì*).

**Eighty-one chapters** (*bā shí yī zhāng*)—**1,539 years** (*qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*)—form **one grand cycle** (*yī tǒng*). From **Zi** (*子*) to **Chen** (*辰*), from **Chen** (*辰*) to **Shen** (*申*), and from **Shen** (*申*) back to **Zi** (*子*), these **four grand cycles** (*fàn sì yīuàn*) span **4,617 years** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí yī qiān suì*).

Each **grand cycle** (*tǒng*) contains **three cycles** (*sān huì*), each **cycle** (*huì*) comprises **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*), and **nine cycles** (*jiǔ huì*) complete **one grand cycle** (*yī yuàn*). Within this, **one chapter** exhausts its **intercalary fraction** (*rùn fèn*), **one cycle** completes its **eclipses** (*yuè shí*), **one grand cycle** fulfills its **new moon divisions** (*shuò fèn*), and **one grand cycle** aligns the **six celestial stems** (*liù jiǎ*) and **ten heavenly branches** (*shí zhī*).

The **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*) uses **81** as the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*), with **365 days** (*sān bǎi liù shí wǔ rì*) per year. Multiplying the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*) yields **29,565 fractions** (*èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi liù shí wǔ fèn*), adding **one-fourth of a day** (*yì sì fèn rì zhī yī*), resulting in **20 fractions short** (*èr shí fèn shǎo*), totaling **29,585 fractions short** (*hé èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi bā shí wǔ fèn shǎo*). Dividing by the **twenty-four solar terms** (*èr shí sì qì*), each term receives **1,232 fractions** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn*), with **17 fractions short** (*yú shí qī fèn shǎo*) remaining.

Multiplying by **32** (*sān shí èr*) and **8** (*bā*), the common denominator yields **552** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí èr*). Further division yields **23 seconds** (*èr shí sān miǎo*). Thus, each **solar term** (*qì*) contains **1,232 fractions and 23 seconds** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn èr shí sān miǎo*).

Using **32** (*sān shí èr*) as the **second-mother** (*miǎo mǔ*), each **verse** (*shǒu*) receives **364 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sān bǎi liù shí sì fèn shí liù miǎo*), and each **ode** (*zàn*) receives **40 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sì shí fèn shí liù miǎo*).

To determine the **solar term** (*qì*) in which an **ode** (*zàn*) falls: place the **winter solstice** (*dōng zhì*) **solar term**’s fractions and seconds, then subtract the fractions and seconds of the **verse** (*shǒu*). If the remainder is less than the **verse** (*shǒu*), subtract the fractions and seconds of the **ode** (*zàn*). The remaining fractions and seconds, when calculated, yield **Lesser Cold** (*xiǎo hán*).

For the next **solar term** (*qì*), place the remaining fractions and seconds of the previous term, add the fractions and seconds of the current term, and seek as before. The **star positions** (*xīng*) are as follows:

- **Jiao** (*角*) at **12 degrees** (*shí èr dù*), **Kang** (*亢*) at **9**, **She** (*氏*) at **15**, **Fang** (*房*) at **5**, **Xin** (*心*) at **5**, **Wei** (*尾*) at **18**, **Ji** (*箕*) at **11**—**East** (*dōng*) at **75 degrees** (*qī shí wǔ dù*).

The **seconds** (*miǎo shù*) being short, the **fractions** (*fèn*) are dispersed into **32** (*sān shí èr*).

To seek the **star** (*xīng*): place its **host degree** (*sù dù shù*), double it with the **verse** (*shǒu*), and subtract the remainder to find the **ode’s division** (*zàn fèn*) corresponding to the **star’s daily position** (*rì suǒ zhàn sù zhī zàn*). Again, double the next **host degree** (*sù dù shù*), add it, and subtract as before.

This is the *Tàixuān Calendar* (*《太玄历》*) transmitted by Xu Hán, taken from the *Handwritten Classics* of Wén Gōng. The original author is unspecified.

It is suspected that **Bì** (*贲*) aligns with **Shěn** (*沈*), and **Guān** (*观*) aligns with **Guīmèi** (*归妹*).

In the **Yìmǎo** (*乙卯*) year of the **Hóngzhì** era, in the **12th month**, Xíng Cāncān (*邢参观*) observed this at **Gāoqiáo** (*皋桥*) in **Táng Bóhú’s** (*唐伯虎*) residence.

This copy was formerly kept in **Táng Zǐwèi’s** (*唐子畏*) household, later gifted to **Qián Túnián** (*钱君同爱*). No duplicate exists; it is preserved only through oral transmission. May **Qián Túnián** cherish it.

#2 *Chān* (*扦*) originally *Rú* (*杝*), corrected per *Thirteen Classics with Commentaries* (*《十三经注疏》*).

The *Tàixuān Jīng* (*扬子云《太玄经》*) currently available is only **Fàn Wàng’s** (*范望*) *Exegesis* (*《解》*).

Though **Wén Gōng’s** (*温公*) annotated edition had a printed edition during the **Jìngjìng** (*明嘉靖*) era, the text and annotations were printed in large characters, with numerous errors. Moreover, such copies are rare today.

I obtained a shadow-copied **Sòng-dynasty manuscript** from **Qiūtiān Zhāng Jūn** (*秋塘张君*), which was originally housed in **Táng Zǐwèi’s** (*唐子畏*) collection. I thus had it printed, maintaining the original layout. I also requested **Gù Jūn Jiānpíng** (*顾君涧苹*) to re-examine it. Where doubts arose, the original was retained—this was done with utmost caution.

Henceforth, readers of **Yáng Zǐyún’s** (*扬子云*) work who consult **Wén Gōng’s** annotated edition will understand its sources.
