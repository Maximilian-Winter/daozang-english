**Sunzi with Commentaries, Fascicle One**
**Planning**

Cao Cao says: "Planning" entails selecting generals, assessing the enemy, measuring terrain, estimating troops, judging distances, and evaluating dangers—all deliberated in the ancestral temple.

Li Quan says: "Planning" is the foremost aspect of warfare. The *Taiyi Dunjia* first applies the spirit of calculation to the Palace of Virtue to determine victory or defeat between host and guest. Thus, Sunzi also places "planning" at the head of his treatise.

Du Mu says: "Planning" means calculation. What is calculated? The five matters below—namely, the Dao/Way, Heaven, Earth, the general, and the law. In the ancestral temple, one first calculates the relative strengths of these five matters between oneself and the enemy, then determines victory or defeat. Only after victory or defeat is settled does one mobilize the army. No aspect of warfare precedes these five matters, hence their placement at the beginning of the treatise.

Wang Xi says: "Planning" refers to evaluating the sovereign and generals, Heaven and Earth, laws and commands, troops and soldiers, rewards and punishments.

Zhang Yu says: Guanzi states: "Plans are first settled within before the army crosses the border." Thus, the Dao/Way of warfare takes planning as its foundation.

Some ask: If warfare values adapting to the enemy on the spot, why does Cao Cao speak of planning in the ancestral temple? The answer: How can one not first calculate the general’s wisdom or folly, the enemy’s strength or weakness, the distance of the terrain, or the size of the army? Yet when the two armies meet and circumstances shift in response, victory depends on the general’s judgment—it cannot be predicted by mere estimation.

Sunzi says: Warfare is a state’s great affair.

Du Mu says: The *Tradition* states: "A state’s great affairs lie in sacrifice and war."

Zhang Yu says: A state’s survival or peril rests on warfare. Thus, discussing and drilling the military is the foremost duty.

It is the ground of life and death, the Dao/Way of survival and extinction—it cannot but be examined.

Li Quan says: Warfare is an instrument of misfortune; life and death, survival and extinction hinge upon it. This is why it is treated with gravity, lest people take it lightly.

Du Mu says: A state’s survival or extinction, a person’s life or death—all depend on warfare, hence the need for careful examination.

Jia Lin says: "Ground" refers to the place—where armies are arrayed, troops are marshaled, and battles are fought. Gain its advantage, and one lives; lose its convenience, and one dies—hence "the ground of life and death." The "Dao/Way" is the Dao/Way of seizing opportunities to establish victory. Grasp it, and one survives; lose it, and one perishes—hence "it cannot but be examined." The *Book of Documents* says: "Those who possess the Dao/Way of survival are aided and strengthened; those who possess the Dao/Way of extinction are overthrown and destroyed."

Mei Yaochen says: Terrain has the potential for life or death; warfare has the Dao/Way of survival or extinction.

Wang Xi says: Once warfare is undertaken, life and death, survival and extinction are tied to it.

Zhang Yu says: The people’s life or death is foretold here, and thus the state’s survival or extinction is revealed there. That life and death are called "ground" and survival and extinction "Dao/Way" is because life and death lie in the terrain of victory or defeat, while survival and extinction depend on the Dao/Way of gain or loss. How could one not weigh and examine this with utmost care?

Therefore, it is tested by the five matters, compared through calculation, and the situation is sought.

Cao Cao says: This refers to the five matters and seven calculations below, through which the situation of oneself and the enemy is sought.

Li Quan says: This refers to the five matters below. "Compared" means measured. Measure and calculate distances to discern the situation and respond to the enemy.

Du Mu says: "Tested" means assessed; the "five" are the five matters mentioned below. "Compared" means weighed; "calculation" refers to the calculations at the beginning of the treatise. "Sought" means searched; "situation" refers to the situation of oneself and the enemy. This means one must first assess the strengths and weaknesses of the five matters, then weigh the gains and losses of the calculations, and only then can one search out the situation of victory or defeat between oneself and the enemy.

Jia Lin says: Weigh the calculations of oneself and the enemy, search out the true situation of both armies, and then strengths and weaknesses will be known, victory and defeat easily seen.

Mei Yaochen says: Order the five matters, weigh and determine the advantages of the calculations.

Wang Xi says: "Tested" means constant, or warp and weft. "Calculation" refers to the seven calculations below. "Sought" means exhausted. The great warp and weft of warfare do not exceed the Dao/Way, Heaven, Earth, the general, and the law. Compare them through the seven calculations, and only then can the situation of victory or defeat between oneself and the enemy be fully grasped.

Zhang Yu says: "Tested" means ordered. Above, one first orders the sequence of the five matters; below, one uses the five matters to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of oneself and the enemy, exploring the situation of victory or defeat.

First: the Dao/Way.

Zhang Yu says: Win the people’s trust through kindness and good faith.

Second: Heaven.

Zhang Yu says: Follow the seasons of Heaven above.

Third: Earth.

Zhang Yu says: Know the advantages of Earth below.

Fourth: the general.

Zhang Yu says: Entrust [command] to the worthy and capable.

Fifth: the law.

Du Mu says: These are called the five matters.

Wang Xi says: These are the five matters of the test.

The Dao/Way of warfare takes harmony among the people as its root, with Heaven’s timing and Earth’s advantage as its aids.

When these three are complete, only then may one discuss raising troops. To raise troops, one must first have a capable general; with a capable general, the laws are then refined. This is the sequence that Master Sun establishes.

Zhang Yu says: [The laws must be] strict and clear in regulation.

That the general and the law occupy the last positions among the five matters is because, whenever one raises troops to punish transgressions, in the ancestral temple one first examines the depth of kindness and good faith, then assesses the alignment of Heaven’s seasons, and next scrutinizes the ease or difficulty of the terrain. Only when these three are thoroughly understood does one appoint a general to lead the campaign. Once the army crosses the border, all laws and commands are then subject to the general. This is the proper sequence.

The Dao/Way means ensuring the people share the ruler’s intent.

Zhang Yu says: By governing the masses with kindness, good faith, and righteousness, the Three Armies become of one heart and gladly serve.

The *Yijing* says: "Delighted to face difficulty, the people forget death." Thus, one may share life and death with them, and they will not fear danger.

Cao Cao says: This means guiding them with teachings and commands.

"Danger" refers to peril and doubt.

Li Quan says: "Danger" means destruction. When the people are guided by the Dao/Way, they naturally transform; united in purpose, how could they perish?

Du Mu says: The Dao/Way is benevolence and righteousness. When Li Si asked Xun Qing about warfare, he replied: "Benevolence and righteousness are what govern the administration of state. When governance is well-ordered, the people grow close to their superiors, delight in their ruler, and readily die for them." Later, in addressing King Xiaocheng of Zhao on warfare, he said: "When a hundred generals share one heart and the Three Armies unite their strength, the ministers’ service to their lord and the subordinates’ service to their superiors become like a child’s service to a father or a younger brother’s to an elder—like arms defending the head and eyes or shielding the chest and belly. Only then can one ensure that they share the ruler’s intent, unite in life and death, and do not fear peril or doubt."

Chen Hao’s annotation agrees with Du Mu.

Meng Shi says: One version reads "the people do not doubt," meaning unwavering loyalty; another reads "the people are not in danger." The Dao/Way refers to guiding with government decrees and unifying through ritual instruction, thus transforming and winning over officers and people to share a single purpose with their superiors. Therefore, the subtlety of warfare lies in employing authority and strategy as the Dao/Way. When the Great Dao declines, laws arise; when laws decline, authority arises; when authority declines, power arises; when power declines, strategy arises; when strategy declines, calculations arise. As the Great Dao falls into decay and human nature grows deceitful, one can only achieve one’s aims through authority and calculation. Thus, the Dao/Way of authority and strategy ensures that superiors and subordinates advance together, share the same loves and hates, and unite in their interests. Therefore, the people’s hearts turn toward virtue, and one gains their strength to the utmost degree of selflessness. Thus, even with a million troops, their hearts become as one, and one may unite with them in risking death—moving as one without falling into peril or destruction.

The ministers’ service to their lord and the subordinates’ service to their superiors become like a child’s service to a father or a younger brother’s to an elder—like arms defending the head and eyes or shielding the chest and belly. Only then can one share the ruler’s intent, unite in life and death, and not fear peril or doubt.

Jia Lin says: When a general takes the Dao/Way as his heart and shares both profit and hardship with the people, the officers and soldiers submit, and their hearts naturally align with their superiors. To make soldiers cherish their commander like parents and view the enemy as hated foes is impossible without the Dao/Way.

The Yellow Stone Elder said: "Those who attain the Dao/Way prosper; those who lose it perish."

Du You says: This means guiding with government decrees and unifying through ritual instruction. "Danger" refers to doubt; when the ruler practices benevolence, the people are willing to give their lives. Thus, in facing life-and-death crises, they do not fear collapse or peril. For example, during the siege of Jinyang, when stoves sank and frogs bred, the people harbored no thoughts of rebellion or doubt.

Mei Yaochen says: "Danger" means perversity. When the ruler possesses the Dao/Way, governance and instruction prevail; when people’s hearts are united, perversity and danger depart. Thus, if the ruler is secure, the people are secure; if the ruler is in peril, the people are in peril.

Wang Xi says: The Dao/Way refers to the ruler possessing the Dao/Way and being able to win the people’s hearts. Those who win the people’s hearts gain their utmost effort; those who gain their utmost effort can overcome crises. The *Yijing* says: "Delighted to face difficulty, the people forget death." In such a case, how could they fear perilous or difficult matters?

Zhang Yu says: "Danger" means doubt. When soldiers are moved by kindness, they share life and death with their superiors, resolutely without fear or hesitation.

Heaven refers to yin and yang, cold and heat, and the constraints of the seasons.

Cao Cao says: Execute punishments in accord with Heaven, following the constraints of yin and yang and the four seasons.

Thus, the *Methods of Sima* states: "Do not mobilize troops in winter or summer, to show universal love for the people."

Li Quan says: Respond to Heaven and align with the people, seizing opportunities according to the seasons.

Du Mu says: Yin and yang refer to the Five Phases, the alternation of punishment and virtue, and the orientation of advance and retreat. The movements of the Five Planets are the most reliable indicators. Wu Xian, Gan De, Shi Shen, Tang Meng, Shi Mo, Zi Shen, and Bi Zao—all have written works, each claiming profound secrets. Examining their essential points, they all ultimately derive from human affairs.

The *Star Canon* states: "The region where Jupiter resides must not be attacked; attacking it will bring calamity upon oneself." In the *Zuozhuan*, thirty-second year of Duke Zhao: In summer, Wu attacked Yue, first deploying troops against it. Shi Mo said: "In less than forty years, Yue will possess Wu. Yue is favored by Jupiter, yet Wu attacks it—it will surely suffer misfortune." The commentary states: "The cycle of survival and destruction does not exceed three twelve-year periods, or thirty-six years. Hence, it is said 'less than forty years.'" That year, Jupiter was in the Star Marker, which governs Wu’s region. The state where Jupiter resides enjoys good fortune; Wu initiated the attack, so it suffered misfortune instead. In the twenty-second year of Duke Ai, Yue destroyed Wu—thirty-eight years had passed.

Li Chunfeng says: When the world rose against Qin, Jupiter gathered in the Eastern Well. Qin’s governance was tyrannical, losing Jupiter’s benevolent and harmonious principle, violating Jupiter’s reverent and solemn Dao/Way, rejecting remonstrance and trusting slander. Thus, Huhai ultimately perished.

It further states: When Jupiter appears clear, bright, and radiant, the state in its celestial division enjoys great fortune. If the ruler’s commands align with the seasons, Jupiter shines with joy, the year yields abundance, and the people live in peace. If the ruler is cruel and oppressive, causing hardship to the people, Jupiter’s color sharpens into angry spikes, and war arises. From this, we see that Jupiter’s presence may bring either fortune or calamity—does this not all stem from human affairs?

The rulers of Wu and Yue possessed equal virtue and matched strength. When Helü launched his campaign, his ambition was to annihilate Yue, not to relieve the people’s suffering. Thus, Jupiter bestowed fortune upon Yue and disaster upon Wu. Qin’s tyranny provoked the world to rise against it, aligning with Heaven’s will, so Jupiter brought ruin to Qin and favored Han.

Mars is the Star of Punishment. When Duke Jing of Song uttered a single virtuous word, Mars retreated three celestial stations, extending his reign by twenty-seven years. From this, we deduce: Jupiter, the Star of Benevolence, does not bless the unrighteous; Mars, the Star of Punishment, does not punish the virtuous. These two examples suffice—all else may be inferred. Moreover, the celestial divisions Jupiter traverses respond to the quality of governance: its color, brilliance, and spikes shift in size, heralding fortune or misfortune, each interpreted according to its time.

Li Chunfeng says: Physical forms manifest below, while subtle images correspond above. Observe the body: ears and eyes serve the liver and kidneys; nose and mouth sustain the heart and abdomen. Do they not influence one another? As the *Book of Changes* states: "In Heaven, images form; on Earth, shapes take form—transformation is evident." Yet all ultimately derives from human affairs.

The theories of "facing virtue and turning from punishment" are particularly unreliable. These are but celestial configurations: armies arrayed with their backs to water are doomed, while those facing mountains or slopes are defeated. Yet when King Wu attacked Zhou, he deployed with his back to the Ji River and faced mountains and slopes—with a mere twenty-two thousand five hundred men, he crushed Zhou’s millions and destroyed him.

Consider what we have witnessed: from the Yuanhe era to the present, in thirty years, the state has launched four campaigns against the Zhao rebels of the昭义 Army. With forces from multiple fronts, numbering a hundred thousand in name, they besieged Lincheng County. They attacked from the south but failed to breach it; from the north, east, and west—all in vain. Four sieges spanned ten years, during which time, in all directions, was there ever a moment when "facing virtue and turning from punishment" aligned with an auspicious hour? Their failure stemmed not from celestial omens but from the city’s strength: its walls were high, its moats deep, its grain abundant, and its people united.

Examining past events confirms this: Qin triumphed in war for generations, ultimately annihilating the six states. Was Heaven’s Dao fixed in the northwest for two hundred years, with fortune constantly residing in the Quail’s Head? Was it not rather that from Duke Mu onward, Qin humbled itself to seek scholars, focused on agriculture and warfare, and governed through clear laws and commands?

Thus, when King Hui of Liang asked Master Weiliao, "The Yellow Emperor had the arts of punishment and virtue, enabling him to win every battle—did he truly possess them?" Master Weiliao replied: "Not so. The Yellow Emperor’s 'punishment and virtue' meant using punishment to conquer and virtue to defend. This is not what the world calls punishment and virtue. Those who employ the worthy and utilize the capable do not rely on timing to succeed; those who clarify laws and enforce commands do not need divination to prosper; those who honor merit and nurture labor do not require prayers to receive fortune."

When King Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, his army encamped at the Gongtou Mountain by the Si River. A violent storm arose—wind and rain lashed, drums and banners shattered, and the king’s attendant in the chariot trembled in terror, nearly dying of fright. The Grand Duke said: "In warfare, following Heaven’s Dao does not guarantee victory, nor does defying it ensure defeat. If human affairs are neglected, the entire army will perish. Heaven’s Dao and spirits are invisible and inaudible—thus the wise do not rely on them, while fools are bound by them. If one esteems the worthy and employs the capable, acts in accord with the times, then affairs will prosper without regard to timing, success will come without divination, and fortune will follow without prayer." He then ordered the advance.

The Duke of Zhou said: "Now we march against Jupiter’s position, the tortoise-shell cracks with ill omens, divination is inauspicious, and stars portend disaster—let us withdraw." The Grand Duke grew angry: "Zhou has dismembered Bi Gan, imprisoned Ji Zi, and entrusted governance to Fei Kang—why should we not attack? How can withered grass and rotten bones know anything?" He burned the tortoise shell, snapped the divining stalks, and led the charge, with King Wu following. Thus, they destroyed Zhou.

When Emperor Gaozu of Song besieged Murong Chao in Guanggu, he prepared to attack. His generals all remonstrated: "Today is a day of 'departing and perishing'—a taboo for military affairs." The emperor said: "If I depart, he perishes—what greater fortune could there be?" He ordered the troops to scale the walls, and Guanggu fell.

When Emperor Wu of Northern Wei campaigned against Murong Lin of Later Yan, he advanced on the last day of the month, the day of Jiazi. The Grand Astrologer Chou Chong memorialized: "In ancient times, Zhou perished on a Jiazi day." The emperor replied: "Did not King Wu of Zhou also triumph on a Jiazi day?" Chong had no answer. The emperor then crushed his enemy.

When Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei campaigned against Xia’s Helian Chang at Tongwan City, his army encamped beneath the walls. Chang advanced with drums roaring and battle cries. Just then, wind and rain swept in from behind the enemy. The Grand Astrologer advised: "Heaven does not aid us. Our troops suffer from hunger and thirst—we should withdraw for now." Cui Hao countered: "A thousand *li* of victory hinges on this single day—how can we alter our course? The wind’s course lies with man, not with constancy." The emperor followed his counsel, and Chang’s forces were utterly routed.

Some ask: If this is so, then the alignment of yin and yang cannot be trusted—why then does *The Art of War* discuss it? The answer: Tyrannical and benighted rulers, obsessed with a single treasure or steed, will stop at nothing to satisfy their will. Without invoking the Way of Heaven or the spirits, who could restrain them? Thus, *The Art of War* addresses it, for there is profound meaning therein. Cold and heat, the qi of the seasons—these regulate advance and retreat.

When Zhou Yu aided Sun Quan in enumerating Cao Cao’s four defeats, the first was: "Now, in the depths of winter, horses lack forage, and the northern troops, crossing rivers and lakes, unaccustomed to the climate, will surely fall ill—this is a taboo in warfare." Cold and heat alike belong to the timing of Heaven, and so they are discussed together.

Master Meng said: "Warfare follows the movement of Heaven. Yin and yang are the ebb and flow of softness and strength. Employing yin yields emptiness, solidity, and stillness; employing yang yields swiftness, ferocity, and vehemence. To follow is to use yin; to lead is to use yang. Yin must not be concealed; yang must not be exposed." The forms of yin and yang have no fixed shape—thus, the art of war emulates Heaven. Heaven has cold and heat; war has life and death. Heaven responds to destruction by shaping things; war responds to opportunity by shaping circumstances. Hence, it is said: "This is Heaven."

Jia Lin said: "The 'timing' in 'timing and qi' refers to seizing favorable moments and assessing the advantages of climate." Du You said: "It means conducting punitive expeditions in accord with Heaven, following the yin-yang and four-seasonal regulations of hardness and softness." Mei Yaochen said: "Warfare must align with the Way of Heaven, conform to qi and climate, and be regulated by timing—this is what is meant by 'regulation.'"

*The Methods of the Sima* states: "No campaigns are launched in winter or summer, to show universal care for the people." Wang Xi said: "Yin and yang encompass the Way of Heaven, the Five Phases, the four seasons, wind, clouds, and atmospheric phenomena. Skillfully observing their waxing and waning aids military victory. Yet without extraordinary individuals imparting their secrets, such knowledge remains inaccessible. Consider Huangshi Gong bestowing his book upon Zhang Liang—this was the *Military Methods of the Grand Duke*. Is it not that the divine mechanisms of Heaven are too profound for ordinary minds to grasp? The myriad schools diverge in their views, and none can claim certainty."

Cold and heat, as Wu Qi noted, include fierce winds, bitter cold, scorching summers, and blazing heat. "Timing and regulation" means adapting to the advantages and disadvantages of the moment. Fan Li said: "When Heaven’s timing is not propitious, do not act as the invader." Zhang Yu said: "Yin and yang do not refer to the auspices of solitary emptiness or alignment. Rather, warfare itself possesses yin and yang." Fan Li said: "To follow is to use yin; to lead is to use yang. Exhaust the enemy’s yang rhythm, fill our yin rhythm, and seize the advantage." He also said: "Position the right as the female, strengthen the left as the male, and adjust timing to accord with the Way of Heaven."

Li Jing explained: "Left and right are the yin and yang of man; early and late are the yin and yang of Heaven; the extraordinary and the orthodox are the yin and yang of Heaven and man in transformation." All these speak of warfare’s inherent use of yin-yang and hardness-softness, not the yin-yang of astrological omens. Now, consider *The Master of Military Preparedness*—its chapter on celestial omens makes this meaning most clear. *The Tai Bai Yin Jing* also includes a section titled "Heaven Has No Yin or Yang," both placed at the beginning to dispel the world’s confusion.

The Grand Duke said: "The sages sought to end the chaos of later ages, so they composed cryptic texts, ascribing victory to the Way of Heaven—though it avails nothing in warfare." This, too, is the case. Emperor Taizong of Tang likewise said: "No weapon is more baleful than war. If military action benefits human affairs, why hesitate over taboos?"

"Cold and heat" refer to campaigning in winter or summer. When the Han dynasty campaigned against the Xiongnu, many soldiers lost fingers. When Ma Yuan campaigned against the Man tribes, many troops died of plague—both due to winter and summer campaigns. "Timing and regulation" means conducting punitive expeditions in accord with Heaven’s timing. *The Tai Bai Yin Jing* states that "Heaven’s timing" refers to natural disasters like floods, droughts, locusts, and hail, not the auspices of solitary emptiness or alignment.

"Terrain" encompasses distance and proximity, peril and ease, breadth and narrowness, life and death. Cao Cao said: "The nine types of terrain differ in form, and one must adapt to timing to exploit their advantages." This is discussed in the chapter on the nine terrains. Li Quan said: "Favorable terrain creates conditions of life and death." Mei Yaochen said: "Understand the advantages and disadvantages of terrain." Zhang Yu said: "In warfare, it is essential to first know the terrain. Knowing distance enables planning for indirect and direct routes; knowing peril and ease enables assessing the advantages of infantry and cavalry; knowing breadth and narrowness enables calculating the use of many or few troops; knowing life and death enables recognizing the dynamics of battle and retreat."

"Generals" embody wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness. Cao Cao said: "A general should possess all five virtues." Li Quan said: "These five are the virtues of a general, hence the term 'elder' for a commander." Du Mu said: "The Way of the former kings placed benevolence first; among military strategists, wisdom takes precedence. Wisdom enables adaptability and discernment; trustworthiness ensures clarity in rewards and punishments; benevolence means loving people and pitying their toil; courage means decisive victory and seizing opportunities without hesitation; strictness means disciplining the army with authority and punishment."

When Shen Baoxu of Chu was sent as an envoy to Yue, King Goujian of Yue, preparing to attack Wu, asked about warfare. He replied: "In warfare, wisdom comes first, followed by benevolence, then courage."

Without wisdom, one cannot comprehend the people’s limits nor measure the multitude or scarcity of the realm. Without benevolence, one cannot share the hardships of hunger and toil with the three armies. Without courage, one cannot resolve doubts to initiate great plans.

Jia Lin said: "Relying solely on wisdom leads to treachery; partial benevolence results in weakness; rigid adherence to trustworthiness breeds folly; dependence on brute force turns to violence; excessive strictness becomes cruelty. Only when all five are balanced and applied appropriately can one become a commander."

Mei Yaochen said: "Wisdom enables strategy; trustworthiness ensures rewards and punishments; benevolence unites the masses; courage enables decisiveness; strictness establishes authority."

Wang Xi said: "Wisdom means foresight without confusion, the ability to plan, and adaptability to change. Trustworthiness means unified commands. Benevolence means compassionate governance that wins hearts. Courage means fearlessness in righteousness and resolute action. Strictness means disciplining the masses with authority. All five are interdependent; lacking one renders the rest incomplete."

Thus, Cao Cao said: "A general should possess all five virtues." He Shi said: "Without wisdom, one cannot assess the enemy or respond to circumstances. Without trustworthiness, one cannot train subordinates or lead troops. Without transformation (benevolence), one cannot unite the masses or comfort soldiers. Without courage, one cannot decide strategies or engage in battle. Without strictness, one cannot subdue the strong or unify the ranks. Mastery of these five talents defines a general’s essence."

Zhang Yu said: "Wisdom must not be confused; trustworthiness must not be deceived; benevolence must not be oppressive; courage must not be intimidated; strictness must not be violated. Only with all five virtues can one become a great general."

**Laws** refer to organizational structures, official hierarchies, and logistical systems.

Cao Cao said: "Organizational structures encompass the arrangement of troops, banners, drums, and signals. Officials refer to the division of ranks. Logistics pertain to supply routes. Logistics officers manage military expenditures."

Li Quan said: "Troops are organized into units; regulations govern their discipline. Officials oversee ranks and rewards. Logistics concern supply routes. Officers manage resources and expenditures—all standard military protocols under a commander’s governance."

Du Mu said: "Units are organized into formations with clear divisions. Regulations govern the use of drums, flags, and signals. Officials include officers and commanders, each with defined roles. Logistics involve the routes for encampments and deployments. Officers manage storerooms, supplies, and support staff. Expenditures cover chariots, horses, weapons, and all military necessities."

Xun Qing said: "Military equipment and supplies must be accounted for. Warfare depends on provisions; supply routes must be calculated before mobilizing troops."

Mei Yaochen said: "Organizational structures define troop formations and their regulations. Official hierarchies establish command chains for officers. Logistics officers manage resources, provisions, and all necessary supplies."

Wang Xi said: "Units refer to the composition of troops. Regulations govern their formations, advances, and retreats. Officials include officers and commanders. Logistics involve troop movements and deployments. Officers oversee their respective duties and resources. Military expenditures include supplies, provisions, and equipment."

Zhang Yu said: "Units refer to troop organizations; regulations govern their discipline. Officials divide command responsibilities. Logistics concern supply routes. Officers manage military resources; expenditures cover all necessary supplies. These six elements are essential to warfare and must be governed by established protocols."

All generals are familiar with these five principles; those who understand them prevail, while those who do not are defeated.

Zhang Yu said: "Though all are aware of these five principles, only those who deeply grasp their nuances will triumph; others will fail. Thus, they must be evaluated through calculation to discern their true conditions."

Cao Cao said: "All generals know these five principles; those who understand their nuances will prevail. Discerning their conditions reveals the outcome of victory or defeat."

Du Mu said: "Regarding the five principles, generals must assess and compare their own strengths and weaknesses against the enemy’s, then thoroughly investigate the situation to ensure victory—otherwise, defeat is inevitable."

Jia Lin said: "As the saying goes: 'Knowledge is not the difficulty; action is.'"

Wang Xi said: "One must fully comprehend them. Though the five principles are widely known, the seven calculations are needed to fully grasp their conditions."

Zhang Yu said: "The five principles have been outlined above; what follows is the evaluation of both sides’ advantages and disadvantages to determine the conditions of victory or defeat."

The questions are: Which ruler possesses the Way?

Cao Cao said: "Moral virtue and wisdom."

Li Quan said: "Which ruler truly embodies the Way? A virtuous ruler commands wise and capable generals. Fan Zeng’s departure from Chu and Chen Ping’s allegiance to Han exemplify this."

Du Mu said: "Which ruler—ours or the enemy’s—can distance flatterers, embrace the worthy, and trust their subordinates without doubt?"

Du You said: "A ruler is a sovereign; the Way refers to virtue. First, compare the two rulers to determine who is wise and who is not. For instance, Xun Xi predicted that Duke Yu of Jin, being gluttonous and avaricious, would fall prey to deception, while Gong Zhiqi, though timid, could not strongly remonstrate."

Mei Yaochen said: "Which ruler has won the people’s hearts?"

Wang Xi said: "Like Han Xin’s assessment of Xiang Yu—brute courage and womanly indecision, a ruler in name only who lost the hearts of the realm. Contrast this with the Han king’s entry into Wu Pass, where he harmed nothing, abolished Qin’s harsh laws, and the people of Qin all desired him as their ruler."

He Shi said: "As the Book of Documents states: 'Those who nurture me are my lords; those who oppress me are my enemies.' Which ruler governs with benevolence or tyranny?"

Zhang Yu said: "First, compare the two rulers to see who possesses the virtue of trust and unity—this is the Way of aligning the people’s will with their ruler’s."

"Like Han Xin’s assessment of Xiang Yu—though his benevolence and courage surpassed the High Ancestor’s, his refusal to reward merit was but womanly kindness. Which commander possesses true ability?"

Du Mu said: "Which commander possesses ability? This refers to the aforementioned qualities of wisdom, trustworthiness, *qi*, courage, and strictness."

Mei Yaochen concurred with Du Mu’s annotation.

Wang Xi said: "As when the Han king asked of Wei’s great general Bo Zhi, 'His mouth still reeks of milk—how could he withstand Han Xin?' and the like."

Zhang Yu said: "Examine the commanders of both sides to see who possesses the abilities of wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness. This is akin to the High Ancestor’s assessment that Wei’s general Bo Zhi could not withstand Han Xin."

Which side holds the advantage of Heaven and Earth?

Cao Cao and Li Quan both said: "Heaven’s timing and Earth’s advantage."

Du Mu said: "Heaven refers to the aforementioned yin and yang, cold and heat, seasonal constraints; Earth refers to the aforementioned distance and proximity, peril and ease, breadth and narrowness, life and death."

Du You said: "Observe the positions of the two armies to discern who holds the advantage of Heaven’s timing and Earth’s terrain."

Mei Yaochen said: "Scrutinize the harmony of Heaven’s timing and the assessment of Earth’s advantage."

Wang Xi followed Du Mu’s annotation.

Zhang Yu said: "Observe the actions of the two armies to see who holds the advantage of Heaven’s timing and Earth’s terrain. For instance, when Emperor Wu of Wei campaigned against Wu in the depths of winter, or when Murong Chao failed to hold the Great Xian Pass—these were cases of losing Heaven’s timing and Earth’s advantage."

Whose laws and commands are most effectively enforced?

Cao Cao said: "Established yet unviolated, violated yet surely punished."

Du Mu said: "Laws and prohibitions are proclaimed, with noble and base treated as one. Examples include Wei Jiang’s execution of his servant or Cao Cao’s severing of his own hair."

Du You said: "Decrees and commands are issued—compare which side’s subordinates dare not transgress."

Mei Yaochen said: "Unite the multitude through law, bind them as one through command."

Wang Xi said: "Which side’s laws are clear and commands expedient, such that the people heed and obey?"

Zhang Yu said: "Wei Jiang’s execution of Yang Gan, Luan Ju’s beheading of Zhuang Jia, Lü Meng’s slaying of his fellow villager, and Zhuge Liang’s punishment of Ma Su—these exemplify 'established yet unviolated, violated yet surely punished.' Which side is thus?"

Whose forces are stronger?"

Du Mu said: "When superiors and subordinates are harmonious and united in courage for battle, their strength prevails; when soldiers are numerous and chariots abundant, their strength prevails."

Mei Yaochen said: "Internal harmony and external allegiance."

Wang Xi said: "Strength and weakness suffice to gauge one another."

Zhang Cheng said: "Chariots sturdy and horses fine, soldiers brave and weapons keen—who hears the drum with joy and the gong with fury? Which side is thus?"

**Which army’s troops are better trained?**
Du Mu said: "They discern banners, heed gongs and drums, understand opening and closing formations, know advance and retreat, are skilled in pursuit and archery, and practiced in striking and thrusting."

Du You said: "Know which side’s weapons are sharper and troops more disciplined and adept."

Thus, the King’s Son said: "Soldiers untrained in peacetime will panic in battle; generals untrained in peacetime will falter before sudden changes."

Mei Yaochen said: "Chariots and cavalry well-practiced—whose state excels in precision or coarseness?"

Wang Xi said: "Whose training is more refined?"

He Shi said: "How can bravery and cowardice, strength and weakness, be uniformly judged?"

Zhang Yu said: "The methods of assembling and dispersing, the commands for sitting and rising, advancing and retreating—who is thoroughly practiced in these?"

**Which side’s rewards and punishments are clearer?**
Du Mu said: "Rewards not excessive, punishments not indiscriminate."

Du You said: "Rewarding the good and punishing the wicked—know which side does so with clarity."

Thus, the King’s Son said: "Rewards without measure waste resources and fail to inspire gratitude; punishments without measure execute but lack authority."

Mei Yaochen said: "Reward the meritorious, punish the guilty."

Wang Xi said: "Who ensures rewards match merit and punishments fit the crime?"

Zhang Yu said: "Those deserving reward, though enemies, must be recognized; those deserving punishment, though kin, must not be spared." The *Methods of Sima* also states: "Rewards not delayed, punishments not deferred—whose system is thus clear?"

"By this, I know victory and defeat."

Cao Cao said: "By weighing these seven matters, victory and defeat are known."

Jia Lin said: "Comparing these seven aspects of their governance and ours reveals victory or defeat."

Mei Yaochen said: "If one probes their circumstances, victory and defeat become clear."

Zhang Yu said: "If all seven matters are superior, victory is assured before battle; if all are inferior, defeat is certain before battle. Thus, victory or defeat can be foreknown."

"If the general heeds my strategy, employing it ensures victory—remain; if the general rejects my strategy, employing it ensures defeat—depart."

Cao Cao said: "If plans cannot be settled, then withdraw and leave."

Du Mu said: "If the enemy is well-prepared and defies my strategy, with forces evenly matched and no advantage to be gained, engaging in battle will lead to defeat. Withdraw and depart, as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: 'When just, then return.'"

Chen Hao said: "Sun Wu presented his writings to King Helü, saying: 'If you heed and employ my strategies, you will surely defeat the enemy—I shall remain; if you reject my strategies, you will surely suffer defeat—I shall depart.' Thus, he moved King Helü, hoping to be employed. King Helü replied: 'I have studied all thirteen of your chapters.' At that time, King Helü often led armies himself, hence the reference to the general rather than the ruler."

Meng Shi said: "The general here refers to a deputy commander. If he heeds my plans and prevails, he remains; if he defies them and fails, he is removed."

Mei Yaochen said: "Sun Wu presented his thirteen chapters to King Helü of Wu, so the opening chapter begins with these words to move him. It means: if the king heeds my strategy and employs it in battle, victory is certain—I shall remain; if the king rejects my strategy and employs it in battle, defeat is certain—I shall depart."

Wang Xi said: "The general here means 'to act'; 'employ' refers to using troops. It means: if one acts upon this strategy, using troops will ensure victory—I shall remain; if one does not act upon this strategy, using troops will ensure defeat—I shall depart."

Zhang Yu said: "The general here is a particle. Sunzi says: 'If the general now heeds my presented strategy and employs troops, victory is certain—I shall remain; if the general does not heed my presented strategy and employs troops, defeat is certain—I shall depart to another state.' With these words, he sought to move the King of Wu and secure his employment."

"Once the advantageous strategy is heeded, then create momentum to support it externally."

Cao Cao said: "Beyond conventional methods."

Li Quan said: "Once the advantageous strategy is set, then seize the momentum of circumstances. Supporting it externally means acting beyond conventional methods."

Du Mu said: "Calculating advantage and harm is the foundation of military affairs. Once the advantageous strategy is heeded, then beyond conventional methods, further seek momentum to assist the endeavor."

Jia Lin said: "Having assessed the advantage and heeded the plan, grasped the enemy’s circumstances, I then devise extraordinary momentum to move them. Externally, this may involve flanking attacks or rear pursuit to support the main formation."

Mei Yaochen said: "Decide the strategy internally, create momentum externally to secure victory."

Wang Xi said: "Once the advantage of my strategy is heeded, one must also know how to adapt to support it externally."

Zhang Yu said: "Sunzi further states: if the advantage of my strategy is heeded, I must then create momentum to support the endeavor externally. For military conventions can be openly declared, but advantageous momentum must be shaped in response to the enemy. Momentum arises from seizing opportunity to exercise adaptability."

Cao Cao said: "Control stems from adaptability; adaptability is shaped by circumstances."

Li Quan said: "Plans adapt to circumstances."

Du Mu said: "From here onward, he speaks of momentum beyond conventional methods. Momentum cannot be foreseen in advance; one may perceive one’s advantage through the enemy’s harm, or one’s harm through the enemy’s advantage, then devise adaptable tactics to secure victory."

Mei Yaochen said: "Act on advantage, exercise adaptability to control them."

Wang Xi said: "Momentum means seizing change."

Zhang Yu said: "So-called momentum requires seizing advantageous circumstances to devise adaptable strategies and defeat the enemy—hence, it cannot be predetermined."

From this point onward, he briefly discusses adaptable strategies. Warfare is the Way of deception.

Cao Cao said: "Warfare has no constant form; deception is its Way."

Li Quan said: "In war, deception is never excessive."

Mei Yaochen said: "Without cunning, one cannot exercise adaptability; without adaptability, one cannot control the enemy."

Wang Xi said: "Deception is the means to seek victory over the enemy; governing the masses must be done with sincerity."

Zhang Yu said: "Though warfare is rooted in benevolence and righteousness, its path to victory necessarily lies in deception. Thus, dragging branches to raise dust was Luan Zhi’s cunning; ten thousand crossbows firing in unison was Sun Bin’s surprise; a thousand oxen charging together was Tian Dan’s adaptability; and damming the water with sandbags was Huaiyin’s deceit. All these were victories won through the Way of deception."

Therefore, when capable, feign incapability.

Zhang Yu said: "Truly strong yet feigning weakness, truly brave yet feigning cowardice—such were Li Mu’s defeat of the Xiongnu and Sun Bin’s execution of Pang Juan."

When active, feign inactivity.

Li Quan said: "Though one has truly deployed troops, outwardly display timidity." When Han general Chen Xi rebelled and allied with the Xiongnu, Emperor Gaozu sent ten envoys to assess the situation, all of whom reported that the enemy could be attacked. He then sent Lou Jing, who returned saying: "The Xiongnu cannot be attacked." The emperor asked why. Lou Jing replied: "When two states contend, they should proudly display their strengths. Yet when I went, I saw only the weak and elderly. This must be feigning incapability while truly capable. I believe they cannot be attacked."

Emperor Gaozu grew furious, saying: "This Qi ruffian won office by glibness, and now he recklessly demoralizes my forces!" He shackled Lou Jing in Guangwu. With three hundred thousand troops, he advanced to Baideng, where the emperor was besieged by the Xiongnu for seven days, running out of provisions. This exemplifies the principle of outwardly feigning cowardice.

Du Mu said: "This is cunning deception concealing one’s form. One’s form must never be revealed to the enemy; if the enemy sees it, they will surely respond." The *Zhuan* states: "A raptor about to strike must hide its form." This is like the Xiongnu displaying weakness and age to the Han envoys.

Du You said: "It means being truly capable and active while outwardly feigning incapability and inactivity, so the enemy does not prepare against us. Like Sun Bin reducing his chariots to outmaneuver Pang Juan."

Wang Xi said: "Feign weakness when strong, cowardice when brave, disorder when disciplined, emptiness when substantial, foolishness when wise, fewness when numerous, retreat when advancing, slowness when swift, abandonment when seizing, and this for that."

He Shi said: "Feigning incapability when capable is like the Chanyu luring Emperor Gaozu into encirclement at Pingcheng. Feigning inactivity when active is like Li Mu stationing troops in Yunzhong and crushing the Xiongnu."

Zhang Yu said: "Feigning retreat when intending to fight, slowness when intending speed—such were Ban Chao’s strike against Shache and Zhao She’s defeat of the Qin army. Feigning distance when near, feigning nearness when far."

Li Quan said: "To make the enemy drop their guard. When Han general Han Xin captured Wei King Bao, he initially arrayed boats as if to cross at Linjin, then secretly ferried troops in wooden jars via Xiayang to ambush Anyi, catching Wei unprepared. Geng Yan’s campaign against Zhang Bu also began by attacking Linzi, feigning a distant threat."

Du Mu said: "To launch a near ambush, one must display the form of a distant departure; to launch a distant ambush, one must display the form of a near advance. Han Xin massed troops at Linjin but crossed at Xiayang—this was feigning nearness to ambush from afar. Later, when Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at Guandu, Yuan sent generals Guo Tu, Chunyu Qiong, and Yan Liang to attack Liu Yan, the governor of Dongjun, at Baima. Yuan led his army to Liyang, preparing to cross the river. Cao marched north to relieve Yanjin. Xun Yu said: 'Our forces are too few to match them; we must divide their strength.' Cao then led troops to Yanjin, pretending to cross, drawing Yuan’s forces to his rear. Yuan turned west to respond. Cao swiftly advanced on Baima, and when within ten *li* of the city, Yan Liang rushed to battle in surprise. Cao sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu to the front, crushed the enemy, beheaded Yan Liang, and lifted the siege of Baima. This was feigning distance to ambush from nearness."

Jia Lin said: "The choice to advance or withdraw lies with us—how would the enemy know?"

Du You said: "Feigning distance when intending nearness, feigning nearness when intending distance. Deceive and dazzle the enemy by displaying distance while actually striking from nearness, as Han Xin did when ambushing Anyi."

Mei Yaochen said: "To prevent the enemy from discerning one’s plans."

Wang Xi’s note was the same as above.

He Shi said: "Feigning nearness when far is like Han Xin arraying boats at Linjin but crossing at Xiayang. Feigning distance when near is like the Jin lord attacking Guo by borrowing passage through Yu."

Zhang Yu said: "To ambush from nearness, feign distance. When Wu and Yue faced each other across the water, Yue positioned troops on both flanks, five *li* apart. At night, both sides advanced to the beat of drums, and Wu divided its forces to resist. Yue then forded the river, striking Wu’s central army, routing them. To ambush from afar, feign nearness, as Han Xin did when massing troops at Linjin but crossing at Xiayang.

Entice with advantage.

Du Mu said: "The Zhao general Li Mu let livestock and people roam freely across the fields. When the Xiongnu made a minor incursion, he feigned defeat, abandoning several thousand men. The Chanyu, hearing this, rejoiced and led a massive force to attack. Li Mu deployed multiple ambushes, flanking and crushing them, slaughtering over a hundred thousand Xiongnu cavalry."

Jia Lin said: "Lure them with advantage, and when they move, they reveal their form—this is how we exploit their form to secure victory."

Mei Yaochen said: "If they covet profit, entice them with goods."

He Shi said: "Enticing with advantage is like the Red Eyebrows abandoning their supplies to bait Deng Yu."

Zhang Yu said: "Display minor gains to lure and overcome them. When the Chu attacked Jiao, their commander said: 'Jiao is small and careless; let us not defend our woodcutters to entice them.' The next day, the Jiao forces rushed out, driving the Chu laborers into the mountains. Chu had set ambushes at the mountain’s base and crushed them."

Seize when disordered.

Li Quan said: "An enemy greedy for profit will surely fall into disorder. When Qin King Yao Xing attacked Tufa Nutan, he drove all his cattle and sheep into the wilds, allowing the Qin troops to plunder freely. The Qin, having gained advantage, lost all formation. Nutan secretly divided ten generals to ambush and strike, crushing the Qin and beheading over seven thousand."

Du Mu said: "When the enemy is confused, seize the opportunity to take them. The *Zhuan* states: 'Absorb the weak, attack the benighted, seize the disordered, humiliate the doomed—this is the fine art of war.'"

Jia Lin said: "Let our cunning disrupt them, then seize them when they are in chaos."

Mei Yaochen said: "When they are disordered, strike and seize them."

Wang Xi said: "Disorder means lacking control; seize implies ease."

Zhang Yu said: "Feign confusion to lure and seize them."

If Wu and Yue were to attack each other, Wu might deploy three thousand convicts, displaying disorder to lure Yue. As the convicts scattered or halted, the Yue forces would vie to seize them—only to be defeated by Wu. This illustrates that waiting for the enemy to fall into chaos before striking is not the correct approach.

According to the principles of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the term "seize" (*qu*) implies ease, as when the Lu army seized the state of Shi. When the enemy is solid and prepared, one must take precautions.

Cao Cao said: "If the enemy is well-ordered and substantial, one must prepare against them."
Li Quan said: "Prepare against the enemy’s solidity."
The Shu general Guan Yu, intending to besiege Fancheng in Wei, feared that the Wu general Lü Meng would strike from the rear. Thus, he left many reserve troops to guard Jingzhou. Lü Meng, discerning his intent, feigned illness. Guan Yu then withdrew his reserve forces, only to be captured by Lü Meng, and Jingzhou fell to Wu. This exemplifies the principle.

Du Mu said: "When armies face each other, regardless of whether the enemy is weak or strong, one must always be prepared. This means that in peacetime, when neighboring states share borders, if the enemy governs with solidity—ruling with love, enforcing rewards and punishments with clarity, and training soldiers with precision—one must prepare against them, not waiting until battle is joined to do so."
Chen Hao said: "If the enemy remains motionless and solid, we must be vigilant and strengthen ourselves to prepare against them."
Mei Yaochen said: "If they are solid, we must not fail to prepare."
Wang Xi said: "They may strike where we are unprepared."
He Shi said: "If the enemy appears solid but their vulnerabilities are unseen, we must conserve our strength and prepare against them."
Zhang Yu said: "The *Military Methods* states: 'Engage them to discern where they have surplus or deficiency.' Surplus means solidity; deficiency means emptiness. If the enemy’s forces are solid, we must adopt an invincible strategy and await them, not acting rashly. As Li Jing’s *Military Mirror* says: 'Observe their emptiness and advance; see their solidity and halt.'"

Avoid the strong.
Cao Cao said: "Avoid their strengths."
Li Quan said: "Measure one’s own strength."
When the Chu ruler attacked Sui, Sui’s minister Ji Liang said: "The Chu forces favor the left flank; you must take the left and avoid engaging their king. Instead, attack their right flank, where their forces are weak, and they will surely be defeated. Even a partial defeat will cause their army to waver." Shaoshi said: "Not confronting the king is no match for him." Sui’s ruler did not heed the advice. The Sui army was routed, and the Sui lord fled. This was the consequence of attacking the strong.

Du Mu said: "Evade their strengths. If the enemy is emboldened by superior force and keen morale, one must temporarily withdraw, awaiting their decline and seizing the moment of vulnerability to strike."
At the end of the Jin dynasty, the rebels Lu Xun and Xu Daofu exploited a gap to raid Jianye. Liu Yu, defending against them, said: "If the rebels advance directly to Xinting, we must avoid them and anchor at Caizhou—they will be captured." Xu Daofu wished to burn their ships and advance directly, but Lu Xun opposed it. They anchored at Caizhou and were ultimately defeated and destroyed.

Jia Lin said: "To overcome the strong with the weak, one must await change."
Du You said: "If their treasuries are full and their soldiers keen, one must retreat and await their laxity, observing developments to respond."
Mei Yaochen said: "If they are strong, we must avoid their sharpness."
Wang Xi said: "If the enemy’s troops are elite and our forces few, we must retreat."
Zhang Yu said: "The *Military Methods* states: 'Do not intercept a well-ordered banner; do not strike a well-formed battle array.' If the enemy’s formations are disciplined and their command strict, we must avoid them and not act recklessly. When Qin and Jin clashed and both withdrew in stalemate, it was to guard against defeat."

Provoke their anger to disrupt them.
Cao Cao said: "Await their decline."
Li Quan said: "Generals prone to anger are easily swayed, for their nature is not steadfast."
The Han minister Chen Ping schemed to disrupt Chu by presenting a lavish feast to a Chu envoy. The envoy was startled and asked: "Is this the doing of the Grand Tutor, or the king’s command?" This was a means of provoking anger to disrupt them.

Du Mu said: "A rigid and irascible commander can be provoked to anger, causing them to act impulsively, their resolve and spirit disrupted, disregarding their original plans."
Meng Shi said: "When the enemy is enraged, one should humble and disturb them."
Mei Yaochen said: "If they are quick-tempered and easily angered, provoke them to rashness and reckless battle."
Wang Xi said: "If the enemy is cautious, incite their anger to disrupt them."
He Shi said: "To provoke anger and disrupt them is exemplified by the Han forces striking Cao Jiu at Sishui."
Zhang Yu said: "If their nature is fierce and resentful, humiliate them to enrage them, causing their resolve and spirit to waver, leading them to act without strategy and advance recklessly. As when the Jin seized Wan Chun to provoke Chu."

The *Wei Liaozi* states: "The forbearing cannot be provoked to anger." This means that those of a patient disposition cannot be goaded into anger.

Humiliate them to make them arrogant.
Li Quan said: "Heavy bribes and sweet words reveal no small ambition."
Later Zhao’s Shi Le feigned submission to Wang Jun. Wang Jun’s advisors urged an attack, but he said: "Lord Shi comes to serve me." He threatened to execute anyone who spoke of attacking. He prepared a grand feast to receive Shi Le, who then drove tens of thousands of cattle and sheep, claiming they were tribute but in truth blocking the streets to prevent Wang Jun’s troops from mobilizing. Shi Le entered Jicheng, seized Wang Jun in his hall, and executed him, annexing Yan. This exemplifies humiliating them to make them arrogant.

Du Mu said: "At the end of the Qin, the Xiongnu chieftain Modu had just ascended. The powerful Donghu sent envoys to demand the thousand-mile horse of Modu’s father, Touman. Modu consulted his ministers, who all said: 'The thousand-mile horse is the state’s treasure; do not give it.' Modu replied: 'How can we begrudge a single horse to a neighboring state?' and gave it. Soon after, the Donghu sent another envoy, demanding one of Modu’s consorts. Modu again consulted his ministers, who were enraged: 'The Donghu are lawless, demanding even a consort! We must attack them.'"

Modu said: "How can we begrudge a single woman to a neighboring state?" and gave her. Soon after, the Donghu again sent word: "The Xiongnu have abandoned a thousand *li* of land; we wish to take it." Modu consulted his ministers, who all said: "We may give it or not; either is acceptable." Modu flew into a rage: "Land is the foundation of the state. How can we surrender our foundation?" He executed all who had spoken in favor of giving it. Mounting his horse, he ordered that any in the nation who lagged behind would be slain. He then launched a surprise attack on the Donghu. The Donghu had grown complacent toward Modu and made no preparations, so Modu struck and annihilated them. He then turned west to attack the Yuezhi, annexed the Loufan and Baiyang to the south and the lands south of the River, and invaded Yan and Dai to the north, fully recovering all the territory the Qin had seized from the Xiongnu through Meng Tian’s campaigns.

Chen Hao said: "What one desires must never be begrudged. Offer women to delude their hearts and jade and silk to inflate their ambitions—this was the strategy of Fan Li and Zheng Wu." Du You said: "When they mobilize their entire nation in fury, eager to advance, one should outwardly display submission to elevate their arrogance, then wait for their complacency upon return to ambush and strike them." Thus, the *Prince of Wang* said: "Those who wield the law skillfully are like a wildcat hunting a rat—matching strength with cunning, feigning humility, remaining still, and striking from below." Mei Yaochen said: "Display weakness to inflate their pride." Wang Xi said: "Feign weakness to make them arrogant; when they least expect it, strike at their vulnerabilities." Zhang Yu said: "Whether through humble words and lavish gifts or feigned retreat with a weary army, all serve to make them careless and overconfident."

When Wu attacked Qi, the Lord of Yue led his forces to pay homage, and the king of Wu bestowed gifts upon his officers and nobles. The people of Wu rejoiced, but Wu Zixu alone feared, saying: "This is fattening Wu for the slaughter." Later, Wu was indeed destroyed by Yue. When Chu attacked Yong, it retreated seven times. The people of Yong said: "Chu is not worth fighting." They ceased their preparations, whereupon the Lord of Chu divided his forces into two columns and attacked, annihilating Yong. All these exemplify the principle.

"Exhaust them through idleness,"

One variant reads: "Lure them and exhaust them." Cao Cao said: "Exhaust them with profit." Li Quan said: "When the enemy is at ease and we exhaust them, it is a skillful achievement." When Wu attacked Chu, Prince Guang sought counsel from Wu Zixu. Zixu said: "We may deploy three armies to harass them. When one of our armies arrives, they will surely muster all their forces to meet it; when they advance, we withdraw. Repeatedly harass them to wear them down, employ diverse tactics to confuse them, then follow with all three armies in succession—we shall surely achieve a great victory." The plan was adopted. From this point on, Chu began to suffer at Wu’s hands.

Du Mu said: Wu’s Prince Guang consulted Wu Yuan on attacking Chu. Yuan said: "We may form three armies to harass them. When one of our armies arrives, they will surely come out in full force; when they advance, we withdraw. Repeatedly harass them to leave them scarred, employ diverse tactics to mislead them, then follow with all three armies in succession—we shall surely achieve a great victory." The plan was adopted. As a result, Zi Zhong was forced to rush to and fro seven times in a single year. Thus Chu began to suffer at Wu’s hands, and Wu eventually entered Ying.

At the end of the Han, after Cao Cao had defeated Liu Bei, Bei fled to Yuan Shao and led his troops to challenge Cao. The adjutant Tian Feng said: "Cao is skilled in warfare; we must not act rashly. It would be better to wear him down over time. You, General, hold the strategic advantage of mountains and rivers, command four provinces, ally with heroes abroad, and cultivate agriculture and warfare at home. Then select your finest troops, divide them into surprise forces, and strike in turns where he is unprepared. Attack his right when he rushes to save his left, strike his left when he hurries to his right. Force him to exhaust himself in constant response, so his people cannot settle into their livelihoods. We shall not be wearied, yet he will be worn down. Within three years, we may triumph without effort. Now, to abandon this strategy of assured victory and stake all on a single battle—regret will come too late." Shao did not heed him and was defeated.

Mei Yaochen said: "With our ease, we await their exhaustion." Wang Xi said: "Employ many surprise forces. When they advance, we withdraw; when they withdraw, we advance. Strike their left when they rush to save their right, attack their right when they hurry to their left—this is how we exhaust them." He Shi said: "Sunzi has a method for managing strength: with ease, await exhaustion. Thus, when the enemy is at ease, we should employ diverse means to wear them down, then we may prevail."

Zhang Yu said: "We remain at full strength, while they become exhausted along the Way." When Jin and Chu contended over Zheng without resolution, Jin’s Zhi Wuzi divided the four armies into three divisions. Each time Jin moved once, Chu responded thrice. Thus, after three engagements, Chu could no longer compete. Another example is when Shen Gong Wu Chen instructed Wu to attack Chu, forcing Zi Zhong to rush to and fro seven times in a single year.

"Estrange those who are close." Cao Cao said: "Use spies to divide them." Li Quan said: "Break their alliances, sow discord between their ruler and ministers, then attack." Formerly, when Qin attacked Zhao, Qin’s Chancellor Ying applied pressure to the King of Zhao, saying: "Our only fear is that Zhao will employ Kuo; Lian Po is easy to deal with." The King of Zhao agreed and replaced Po with Kuo, whereupon Qin buried four hundred thousand Zhao soldiers alive at Changping—this illustrates the principle.

Du Mu said: "If the enemy’s superiors and subordinates are close, employ generous rewards to estrange them." Chen Ping said to the King of Han: "Now, Xiang Yu’s steadfast ministers are no more than Fan Zeng, Zhongli Mo, Long Ju, and Zhou Yin—only a few. If Your Majesty can truly offer tens of thousands of catties of gold, you may sow discord between them. They will surely turn on one another internally; then Han may raise its armies and attack—Xiang Yu’s destruction is certain." The King of Han agreed, providing forty thousand catties of gold to Ping to employ as counterintelligence. Xiang Yu indeed grew suspicious of Fan Zeng and did not press the attack on Rongyang, allowing the King of Han to escape.

Chen Hao said: "If they are stingy with ranks and emoluments, we must be generous; if they hoard wealth, we must be lavish; if they favor harsh punishments, we must be lenient. Exploit their mutual suspicions to carry out estrangement." Thus You Yu came to Qin, and Ying Bu aided Han.

Du You said: "Lure them with profit, so the five types of spies all infiltrate. Let eloquent persuaders rush to sow discord between their ruler and ministers, dividing their strength." For example, Qin sent counterintelligence to deceive the ruler of Zhao, causing him to dismiss Lian Po and appoint Zhao She’s son, leading to the defeat at Changping.

Mei Yaochen’s note is the same as Du Mu’s. Wang Xi said: "When the enemy is close, employ schemes to estrange them." Zhang Yu said: "Either estrange their ruler and ministers or divide their allies, causing them to become estranged and divided, then act against them." Ying estranged Zhao and removed Lian Po; Chen Ping estranged Chu and drove out Fan Zeng—these are examples of estranging ruler and ministers. When Qin and Jin allied to attack Zheng, Zhu Zhiwu went out by night and persuaded the Duke of Qin, saying: "If you gain Zheng, it will only benefit Jin, not Qin. It would be better to spare Zheng and make it your eastern host." The Duke of Qin understood and withdrew his troops—this is an example of dividing allies.

"Attack where they are unprepared; strike where they do not expect." Cao Cao said: "Strike their laxity, exploit their emptiness." Li Quan said: "Strike their laxity, raid their emptiness." Du Mu said: "Strike their emptiness, raid their laxity." Meng said: "Strike their emptiness, raid their laxity, so the enemy does not know how to prepare. Thus it is said: the subtlety of warfare lies in its formlessness." Taigong said: "No movement is more divine than the unexpected; no strategy is better than the unrecognized."

Mei Yaochen and Wang Xi’s notes are the same as above. He Shi said: "To attack where they are unprepared: When the Wei Emperor Taizu campaigned against the Wuhuan, Guo Jia said: 'The Hu rely on their remoteness and will surely not prepare. Exploit their unpreparedness and strike suddenly—they can be destroyed.' When Taizu reached the Yi River, Jia said: 'In warfare, speed is paramount. Now, marching a thousand *li* to strike, with heavy baggage, it will be difficult to seize the advantage. It would be better to advance with light forces by double-time marches to catch them unawares.'"

Thus he secretly advanced through the Lulong Pass, striking directly at the Chanyu’s court, engaging in battle and crushing them utterly.

During the Tang, Li Jing presented the *Ten Glories* to strategize against Xiao Xian, and the command of the three armies was entrusted wholly to him. In the eighth month, he assembled his forces at Kuizhou. Xiao Xian, considering it the season of autumn floods, with the Yangtze’s waters surging and the Three Gorges’ paths treacherous, believed Jing could not advance and thus made no preparations. In the ninth month, Jing led his troops forward, declaring: “In warfare, speed is divine, and opportunity must not be lost. Now, with our forces just assembled, Xiao Xian remains unaware. Riding the flood’s momentum, we shall appear suddenly beneath his walls—what is called ‘swift as thunder before one can cover one’s ears.’ Even if he learns of us, in his haste he will have no means to resist. This will surely end in his capture.” Advancing to Yiling, Xiao Xian at last grew fearful and summoned reinforcements from south of the river, but they could not arrive in time. Jing encircled the city, and Xiao Xian surrendered.

To strike where they are unprepared: At the end of the Wei, generals Zhong Hui and Deng Ai were sent to conquer Shu. The Shu general Jiang Wei defended Jian’ge, and though Zhong Hui attacked, he could not prevail. Deng Ai memorialized: “I request to take the Yinping route, advancing by a hidden path to emerge at Jian’ge and then pressing west into Chengdu. With an unexpected force striking at their heart, the troops at Jian’ge will surely rush back to Fuling, allowing Hui to advance in full strength. If the Jian’ge forces do not return, then those at Fuling will be few.” The *Military Treatise* states: “Attack where they are unprepared; strike where they do not expect.” Now, seizing their vulnerability, we shall surely break them. In the tenth month of winter, Ai marched from Yinping through seven hundred *li* of uninhabited land, cutting paths through mountains, constructing bridges and galleries—terrain so precipitous and valleys so deep that the journey was fraught with peril. Provisions nearly exhausted, they teetered on the brink of disaster. Ai wrapped himself in felt and rolled down the slopes; his officers and men climbed trees and scaled cliffs, advancing in single file. The first to reach Jiangyou, the Shu commander Ma Miao surrendered. Zhuge Zhan withdrew from Fuling to Mianzhu, arraying his forces in resistance. Ai routed them, slaying Zhan and the minister Zhang Zun. Advancing to Chengdu, the Shu ruler Liu Shan surrendered.

Another instance: Gao Huan, a general of Eastern Wei, led his troops to campaign against Western Wei, encamping at Puqi and constructing three floating bridges to cross the Yellow River. He also dispatched his general Dou Tai to press toward Tong Pass, while Gao Aocao besieged Luozhou. The Western Wei general Emperor Wen of Zhou marched his army to Guangyang and summoned his officers, saying: “The enemy now threatens us on three fronts and has built bridges across the river, signaling their intent to cross—all to pin down our forces so that Dou Tai may enter from the west. Prolonged stalemate will allow their plan to succeed; this is no sound strategy. Moreover, Gao Huan always uses Tai as his vanguard, and his troops are both keen and arrogant from repeated victories. Now, striking where they do not expect, we shall surely prevail. If we defeat Tai, Huan will flee without battle.” The officers all said: “The enemy is near; to abandon them and strike afar risks failure, and regret will be too late.” Wen replied: “When Huan previously attacked Tong Pass twice, our forces did not advance beyond Bashang. Now, with his full might arrayed, his troops have not yet left the outskirts. He presumes we will merely defend and have no intention of distant engagement. Emboldened by success, he holds us in contempt. Seizing this moment to strike, how can we not prevail? Though he builds bridges, he has not yet begun to cross. Within five days, we shall take Dou Tai.” The officers dared not oppose him. Wen then led six thousand cavalry back to Chang’an, feigning an expedition to Longyou. On the day *xinhai*, he secretly set out; by the morning of *guichou*, he reached Tong Pass. Dou Tai’s troops, suddenly hearing of his arrival, panicked and took position against the mountains, but before they could form ranks, Wen crushed them. Tai was slain, and his head sent to Chang’an. Gao Aocao, who had just captured Luozhou, upon hearing of Tai’s defeat, burned his supplies and abandoned the city in retreat.

Zhang Yu said: “To attack where they are unprepared means to strike at their laxity, where the enemy does not anticipate, as when the men of Yan feared Zheng’s three armies but did not guard against being outmaneuvered—and were thus defeated. To strike where they do not expect means to assail their vulnerabilities, where the enemy does not consider danger, as when Deng Ai conquered Shu by marching seven hundred *li* through uninhabited land.”

Such are the victories of military strategy, which cannot be foretold. Cao Cao said: “To foretell is to reveal. Warfare has no constant form, just as water has no constant shape. Adapting to the enemy’s changes cannot be predetermined.” Thus, assessing the enemy lies in the mind, and discerning opportunity in the eye.

Li Quan said: “To attack where they are unprepared and do not expect ensures victory—this is the essence of warfare, kept secret and not divulged.”

Du Mu said: “‘Foretold’ means spoken. What has been described above encompasses all the strategies for military victory, yet these are not fixed doctrines. Only when facing the enemy’s disposition can one act; it cannot be declared beforehand.”

Mei Yaochen said: “To respond to the enemy and devise measures as circumstances demand—how can this be spoken of in advance?”

Wang Xi said: “Calculating and conducting campaigns is the standard method, but seizing opportunity to secure victory cannot be predetermined.”

Zhang Yu said: “What has been described above are the victorious strategies of military affairs, which must be adapted to the enemy and cannot be foretold. Before battle, if the temple calculations foretell victory, it is because the calculations are many; if they foretell defeat, it is because the calculations are few. Many calculations bring victory; few bring defeat—how much more so when there are none? By this, I observe that victory and defeat are manifest.”

Cao Cao said: “By my Dao, I observe it thus.”

Li Quan said: “In warfare, one first secures victory in the temple hall before contending for advantage with others. Whether punishing rebels, pacifying distant lands, overthrowing the weak, or attacking the benighted—all arise from the circumstances of things. When internal and external hearts are divided, as in the armies of Shang and Zhou, this is what is meant by victory foretold in the temple. The method of *Taiyi Dunjia* sets calculations: above sixty is many, below sixty is few.”

When the guest’s calculations are many against the host’s few, the host is defeated; when the guest’s calculations are few against the host’s many, the host prevails. In these cases, victory and defeat are easily discerned.

Du Mu said: “‘Temple calculations’ refers to strategizing within the temple hall.”

Mei Yaochen said: “With many calculations, the temple deliberations secure victory before battle is joined; with few calculations, the temple deliberations fail to secure victory before battle is joined. Thus, one cannot be without calculations.”

Wang Xi said: “This is to caution learners against being misled by the notion that nothing can be transmitted beforehand, and so the meaning of the *Calculations* chapter is reiterated.”

He Shi said: “Calculations may be skillful or clumsy, and success or failure hinges upon them.”

Zhang Yu said: “In ancient times, when raising an army, the commander was always sent into the temple for purification rites, where he was given the completed calculations before being dispatched—hence the term ‘temple calculations.’ If the plans and strategies are profound and far-reaching, the calculations yield much, and thus victory is assured before battle. If the deliberations are shallow and short-sighted, the calculations yield little, and thus defeat is certain before battle. Many calculations triumph over few; how much more so when there are none? Thus it is said: victorious armies first secure victory, then seek battle; defeated armies first join battle, then seek victory. Whether one has calculations or none, victory and defeat are easily seen.”

*End of Commentaries on Sunzi, Scroll One*

Wang Xi remarked: Such is the case when the Han king inquired of Wei’s great general Bai Zhi, saying, “This man’s mouth still smells of milk—he cannot withstand Han Xin.”

Zhang Yu said: Examine the generals of both sides to see who possesses the abilities of wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness.

**Sunzi’s Commentaries, Scroll Two: “Waging War”**

Cao Cao said: If one wishes to wage war, one must first calculate its costs and strive to procure provisions from the enemy.

Li Quan said: First establish the strategy, then prepare the military equipment—thus the chapter on waging war follows the chapter on calculations.

Wang Zhe said: Through calculations, one knows victory; only then does one raise an army and prepare military expenses, yet even so, one cannot sustain it for long.

Zhang Yu said: Once the calculations are settled, then repair the chariots and horses, sharpen the weapons, transport the grain and fodder, and budget the expenses to prepare for war—hence this chapter follows “Calculations.”

Sunzi said: In the general method of employing troops, there are one thousand light chariots, one thousand heavy chariots, and one hundred thousand armored soldiers.

Cao Cao said: Light chariots are swift chariots, each drawn by a team of four horses. Heavy chariots are supply wagons, referring to the weight of ten thousand cavalry. Each chariot is drawn by four horses, with a standard of thirty thousand troops. Two soldiers are assigned to cooking, one household retainer to safeguarding clothing and equipment, and two to tending the horses—five in total. For every ten infantrymen, a large ox-drawn wagon is provided. Two soldiers are assigned to cooking, one household retainer to guarding clothing and equipment—three in total. The hundred thousand armored soldiers refer to the number of troops.

Li Quan said: Light chariots are war chariots; heavy chariots are supply wagons; armored soldiers are infantry. Each chariot, drawn by a team of four horses, is accompanied by seventy infantrymen. Thus, an army of one thousand chariots includes seventy thousand armored soldiers and four thousand horses. Sunzi simplifies the figures for military resources, using one hundred thousand as the standard—from this, one may infer a million.

Du Mu said: Light chariots are indeed war chariots. In ancient times, chariot warfare employed heavy chariots—supply wagons carrying weapons, goods, and clothing. The *Methods of Sima* states: One chariot includes three armored soldiers, seventy-two infantrymen, ten household retainers for cooking, five for guarding clothing and equipment, five for tending horses, and five for gathering firewood and drawing water. A light chariot has seventy-five men, a heavy chariot twenty-five. Thus, two chariots together form a unit of one hundred men. For an army of one hundred thousand, with one thousand heavy chariots, the expenses and provisions can be calculated—from this, the needs of a million troops may be known.

Mei Yaochen said: Light chariots are swift chariots; heavy chariots are supply wagons. Each light chariot carries twenty-five armored soldiers and infantrymen, while each heavy chariot carries seventy-five. With one thousand of each, the total armored soldiers number one hundred thousand.

Wang Zhe said: Cao Cao said: Light chariots are drawn by teams of four horses, totaling one thousand chariots. I, Zhe, say: Light chariots refer to those drawn by heavy chariots. One chariot with four horses is a team; one thousand teams mean one thousand heavy chariots. Cao Cao said: Heavy chariots are supply wagons. I, Zhe, say: Heavy chariots are war chariots, part of the five-thousand-chariot levy of the great feudal lords. Cao Cao said: One hundred thousand armored soldiers refer to the number of infantry. I, Zhe, say: According to the well-field system, each district provides one war chariot, three armored soldiers, and seventy-two infantrymen—one thousand chariots total seventy-five thousand men. Here, it speaks of one hundred thousand armored soldiers; could this be an ad hoc measure of the time? Why the discrepancy?

He [Yan]shi said: One hundred thousand is a round number.

Zhang Yu said: Light chariots are attack chariots; heavy chariots are defense chariots. According to Cao Cao’s *New Book*: One attack chariot includes a frontal defense unit and two flanking units, totaling seventy-five men. One defense chariot includes ten cooking retainers, five for guarding equipment, five for tending horses, and five for gathering firewood and drawing water—twenty-five in total. Together, one attack and one defense chariot make one hundred men. Raising an army of one hundred thousand requires two thousand chariots, half light and half heavy—this aligns with the present text.

When transporting provisions a thousand *li*...

Cao Cao said: This means crossing a thousand *li* beyond the border.

Li Quan said: The road is extremely distant.

...the expenses at home and abroad, the costs of entertaining guests, the materials for glue and lacquer, and the upkeep of chariots and armor will amount to a daily expenditure of a thousand pieces of gold before an army of one hundred thousand can be mobilized.

Cao Cao said: This refers to rewards and purchases, which are additional.

Li Quan said: When the army is deployed abroad, the state treasury is exhausted at home. The mention of a thousand pieces of gold signifies immense expenditure. Transporting provisions a thousand *li* means twenty men must support one.

Du Mu said: The army engages in diplomatic exchanges with feudal lords, hence the term “guests.” The maintenance and repair of chariots, armor, and weapons—glue and lacquer are mentioned to represent minor details. A thousand pieces of gold signifies great expense, not including rewards and gifts.

Jia Lin said: If the costs are insufficient, one cannot raise an army or mobilize the masses. Thus, the Grand Marshal Li said: At the gates of the three armies, discussions with guests and advisors take place.

Mei Yaochen said: Mobilizing an army of one hundred thousand and transporting provisions a thousand *li* incurs such daily expenses—this is a warning against prolonged warfare.

Wang Shi said: “At home” refers to the state; “abroad” refers to the army’s location. “Guests” include envoys from feudal lords and banquets for officers and soldiers in the army. Glue and lacquer for chariots and armor are mentioned to encompass both minor and major expenses.

He [Yan]shi said: Prolonged warfare depletes resources—this is what the wise consider.

Zhang Yu said: When campaigning a thousand *li* from the state, one must rely on provisions from the enemy. If supplies must be transported, both the interior and exterior will be thrown into turmoil, exhausting the people on the roads and causing endless waste and depletion.

Guests refer to envoys on missions and wandering scholars; glue and lacquer denote materials for repairing and maintaining equipment; chariots and armor encompass axle grease, metal, and leather goods. Calculating these expenditures, daily costs amount to a thousand *jin* of gold before an army of one hundred thousand can be mobilized. A thousand *jin* signifies immense expense, and rewards for merit remain uncounted. If such an army is used in battle and prevails, prolonged warfare will dull its blades and blunt its edge. In besieging cities, its strength will be exhausted.

Cao Cao said: *Dun* means worn; *qu* means depleted.
Du Mu said: "Victory through prolonged warfare" refers to achieving victory only after protracted engagement. If victory comes only after prolonged struggle with the enemy, armor and weapons will be worn and broken, morale will be crushed, and in attacking cities, manpower will be utterly spent and broken.
Jia Lin said: Though one may defeat the enemy, prolonged warfare brings no advantage. The art of war values complete victory; dulling blades and crushing morale, with soldiers wounded and horses exhausted, leads to defeat.
Mei Yaochen said: Even if victorious and prolonged, weapons will grow dull and worn, and the army’s spirit will be blunted; in besieging cities for long, strength will be utterly spent.
Wang Zhe said: *Qu* means exhausted. Seeking victory through prolonged warfare will dull and break weapons, and in attacking cities, the toll will be even greater.
Zhang Yu said: When armies clash in battle, victory achieved only after prolonged struggle will leave weapons damaged and morale broken. Besieging cities a thousand *li* away will exhaust their strength. Prolonged exposure of the army abroad will deplete the state’s resources.

Meng Shi said: Prolonged exposure of the army in distant lands will strain both military and state finances, leaving them unable to sustain one another.
Mei Yaochen said: If the army remains exposed abroad for long, supplies will be insufficient.
Zhang Yu said: With daily expenses of a thousand *jin* of gold, prolonged exposure of the army will surely exhaust the state’s resources. As when Emperor Wu of Han pursued endless campaigns, exhausting the treasury until he issued a decree of remorse.

When blades are dulled, morale crushed, strength exhausted, and resources depleted, neighboring lords will seize the opportunity to rise. Even with a wise strategist, none can salvage the aftermath.

Li Quan said: Mobilizing an army of one hundred thousand with daily costs of a thousand *jin* of gold not only wears down the army abroad but also drains the state’s wealth. Thus the sage avoids prolonged warfare. In the early years of the Daye era, Emperor Yang of Sui amassed troops and delighted in conquest, yet his strength was spent at the Hangu Pass and his army broken at the Liao River. Dredging canals to divert the Huai, transport grew ever more vast, and with armies marching ten thousand *li*, the state’s resources were exhausted. Then Yang Xuangan and Li Mi rose to exploit his weakness—even had Su Wei and Gao Jiong been present, could they have devised a remedy?

Du Mu said: When an army is prolonged in war without victory, both finances and strength are exhausted, and neighboring lords will rise to exploit the weakness. Even with the wisest strategists, none can devise a sound plan thereafter.
Jia Lin said: With people dispersed and wealth depleted, even if Yi and Lü were reborn, they could not save such ruin.
Du You said: Though there may be tactical advantages in waging war at the time, none can prevent the ensuing calamity.
Mei Yaochen said: In seeking victory and besieging cities, if the army is exposed and prolonged, neighboring lords will exploit this weakness to strike. Even with wise generals, none can resist.
Wang Zhe said: Such exhaustion brings the peril of destruction.
He Shi said: *Thereafter* refers to when, having failed to prevail, the enemy seizes the moment of danger. Even the wise cannot devise a flawless plan to ensure survival.
Zhang Yu said: When the army is weary, strength spent, and resources exhausted, neighboring states will exploit this weakness to strike. Even with the wisest strategists, none can prevent the ensuing disaster. As when Wu invaded Chu and entered Ying, lingering too long before returning, Yue forces then invaded Wu. At that time, even with Wu Zixu and Sun Wu, how could they have devised a sound plan thereafter?

Thus in war, one hears of clumsy haste but never sees skillful slowness.

Cao Cao and Li Quan said: Though clumsy, speed brings victory. *Never seen* means it does not exist.
Du Mu said: In attack and conquest, though clumsy in strategy, speed is paramount. Without the calamities of prolonged warfare—exhausted finances, dulled blades—this is true skill.
Meng Shi said: Though clumsy, speed brings victory.
Chen Bu said: As in the saying, "Swift as thunder leaving no time to cover one’s ears, or lightning leaving no time to blink."
Du You’s annotation agrees with Meng Shi.
Mei Yaochen said: Clumsy haste is still preferable to skillful slowness.
Wang Zhe said: Prolonged warfare ages the army, exhausts finances, and impoverishes the people. Even the skillful cannot avoid calamity.
He Shi said: Haste, though clumsy, spares resources; slowness, though skillful, risks future disaster.

Later, Yao Chang of Later Qin clashed with Fu Deng. Yao Chang’s general, Gou Yao, occupied Niwan Fortress and secretly allied with Fu Deng. Yao Chang fought Fu Deng and was defeated at Matou Plain, then regrouped to fight again. Yao Shuode said to the generals: "Our lord is cautious in battle, always preferring strategy over direct engagement. Now that we have suffered defeat and press the enemy further, there must be reason." Yao Chang heard this and said to Shuode: "Fu Deng wages war slowly, unable to discern reality. Now he advances lightly to occupy our east, and Gou Yao has allied with him. If this drags on, the situation will shift, and the disaster will be incalculable. The reason for hastening battle is to prevent Gou Yao, that fool, from completing his schemes and deepening his treachery." Indeed, he crushed Fu Deng.

In the early years of Empress Wu, Xu Jingye raised troops in Jiangdu, claiming to restore the imperial house. He appointed the prison warden Wei Sigong as his chief strategist and sought his counsel. Wei replied: "My lord, having imprisoned the young emperor on behalf of the Empress Dowager, your aim is restoration. In war, clumsy haste is prized. You should swiftly cross the Huai to the north, personally lead the main force, and march directly on the eastern capital. The generals and soldiers of Shandong, knowing of your loyal endeavor, will follow you even unto death."

Thus, victory could be secured within days, and the realm would be pacified. Xu Jingye wished to adopt this strategy, but Pi Zhang advised him otherwise: "The land of Jinling bears the imperial *qi*; we should swiftly respond to this omen. Moreover, the great river forms a natural barrier, sufficient for our defense. Let us first seize Changzhou and Runzhou to lay the foundation of our kingly enterprise. Then, we may lead our troops northward, advancing with the force of a drumbeat—this way, we shall have a secure retreat and face no disadvantage in our advance. Truly, this is the soundest strategy."

Jingye deemed this counsel wise. He personally led four thousand men south across the river to strike Runzhou. In secret, Wei Sigong said to Du Qiuren: "Military strength must be concentrated, never divided. Now, Jingye fails to consolidate his forces, cross the Huai, and rally the masses of Shandong to converge on Luoyang—how can he possibly succeed?" As foretold, he met defeat.

Zhang Yu remarked: "Victory is better won through clumsy haste than cunning delay. When Sima Xuanwang campaigned against Shangyong, he planned for a year’s campaign in a single month, disregarding casualties and outpacing his grain supply—this was the essence of prizing clumsy haste. No state has ever profited from prolonged warfare."

Li Quan said: "The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: 'War is like fire—if not restrained, it will consume itself.'"

Jia Lin observed: "When war drags on without success, the feudal lords grow restless."

Du You warned: "War is an instrument of misfortune; prolonged, it breeds disaster. When Zhibo besieged Zhao for over a year without returning, he was ultimately captured by Xiangzi, his person slain and his state divided. Thus, the *Xinxu* records: 'Those who delight in war and exhaust their martial strength shall perish without exception.'"

Mei Yaochen asked: "When strength is exhausted and resources depleted, what profit remains?"

Zhang Yu replied: "When armies grow weary and treasuries empty, what benefit accrues to the state? Only those who fully grasp the harms of warfare can fully comprehend its advantages."

Li Quan said: "Profit and harm arise from the same source. First understand harm, then profit becomes clear."

Du Mu explained: "Harm lies in exhausting the people and depleting wealth; profit lies in devouring the enemy and expanding territory. If one ignores the limits of one’s own strength, even those in the same boat become enemies—how then can one profit from the foe?"

Jia Lin cautioned: "When generals grow arrogant and soldiers indolent, when they covet gain and forget danger—this is the gravest harm."

Du You added: "He who schemes for a state or mobilizes an army without first weighing the perils of destruction cannot hope to secure advantage. When the Duke of Qin saw the opportunity to raid Zheng but ignored the disaster at Xiaohan, or when the King of Wu boasted of his triumph over Qi yet forgot the calamity at Gusu—such were their undoings."

Mei Yaochen noted: "To conscript but once, to transport grain but twice—this is profit. To empty the common folk and drain the public coffers—this is harm. Without understanding harm, how can one know profit?"

Wang Zhe observed: "Even if victory comes through prolonged effort, harm is inescapable. Speed alone exhausts all advantage."

Zhang Yu concluded: "Only by first recognizing the harms of weary armies and depleted resources can one grasp the benefits of capturing enemies and securing victory."

The adept commander does not conscript twice nor transport grain thrice.

Cao Cao said: "*Ji* means levy. It speaks of initially conscripting the people and achieving victory without returning home to raise more troops. At first, grain is carried, but later, provisions are taken from the enemy. Upon returning, no grain is sent to meet the army."

Li Quan explained: "*Ji* refers to records. To avoid conscripting twice is to prevent the people from growing weary and resentful. When Qin mobilized the forces of Guanzhong, it led to the uprisings of Chen and Wu."

When an army marches out, provisions are measured by distance and carried; when it returns, grain is sent to meet it—this is called "transporting thrice." But when crossing borders, one lodges and forages among the enemy, so there is no need for a third transport.

Du Mu said: "Assess whether the enemy can be attacked and whether your own forces are prepared for battle. Only then should you raise troops, ensuring victory before returning."

Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Rites of Zhou* states: "*Yi* refers to mobilizing troops; *ji* refers to the registers of the five-man squads. By organizing the people into groups of five and integrating civil administration with military command, troops are raised through these registers."

Chen Hao said: "*Ji* means to borrow; not conscripting twice means not repeatedly borrowing the people’s labor. Grain is carried on the outward journey and met upon return—thus, it is not transported thrice. This avoids exhausting the army and depleting the state, for speed brings advantage."

Mei Yaochen’s gloss aligns with Chen Hao’s. Wang Zhe’s aligns with Cao Cao’s.

Zhang Yu said: "*Yi* refers to the labor of mobilizing troops. The commentary on the *Hexagram of the Army* states: 'Undertaking great labor with heavy burdens—without success, it brings misfortune.' *Ji* refers to the registers for troop mobilization. Thus, the Han system included 'foot-long registers and five-man tallies.' It means that with a single mobilization, victory is won, and no further conscription is needed. Grain is carried at the outset, plundered beyond the border, and met upon return—thus, it is not transported thrice. This teaches that armies must not be exposed to prolonged hardship. By drawing supplies from the state and provisions from the enemy, the army’s food will be sufficient."

Cao Cao said: "Weapons and armor are taken from the state; grain is taken from the enemy."

Li Quan said: "Equipped with our own arms and relying on the enemy’s food, even a thousand *li* campaign will know no want."

Du You said: "Weapons and armor are taken from the state; grain is taken from the enemy. Resources are drawn from one’s own land, while provisions are seized from the enemy’s."

This was exemplified when the Jin army lodged and foraged in Chu.

Mei Yaochen said: "The army’s needs are supplied by the state; its rations are taken from the enemy."

He Shi explained: "*Yin* means that when troops cross borders, they seize and plunder the countryside, and upon capturing cities or defeating enemies, they take their stores."

Zhang Yu said: "Equipment is taken from the state because goods are light and easy to transport; grain is taken from the enemy because grain is heavy and difficult to move. Transporting grain over a thousand *li* leaves soldiers gaunt, so taking grain from the enemy ensures ample food. A state impoverished by war suffers from distant transport; distant transport impoverishes the people."

Li Quan said: "Frequent military campaigns lead to heavy taxation and levies."

Du Mu said: "Guanzi states: When grain is transported three hundred *li*, the state has no one year’s reserves; when transported four hundred *li*, it has no two years’ reserves; when transported five hundred *li*, the people show signs of hunger. This speaks to grain being a heavy commodity—light goods cannot be substituted for it. If substituted, both farmers and plow oxen abandon the fields, and thus the people cannot but grow impoverished."

Jia Lin said: "Distant transport depletes wealth on the roads and exhausts resources in transit, leaving the people increasingly destitute."

Meng Shi said: "When war chariots transport supplies beyond a thousand *li*, wealth is wasted on the roads, and the people suffer hardship."

Zhang Yu said: "To sustain an army of a hundred thousand with the resources of seven hundred thousand households at a distance of a thousand *li* leaves the people no choice but to grow poor. Those near the army sell at exorbitant prices; such profiteering drains the people’s wealth."

Cao Cao said: "Once the army crosses the border, those near the troops demand high prices for goods, and all such profiteering leaves the people utterly depleted."

Li Quan said: "Where the army encamps, trade flourishes, and the people, lured by profit, sell their property to follow, thus exhausting themselves."

Jia Lin said: "Where troops gather, prices soar. People seek extraordinary profits, selling their goods to exhaustion. Though they may gain much at first, they ultimately grow weary and their resources run dry. Moreover, extraordinary levies drive sellers to demand endless prices, and the people, straining to buy, naturally deplete both household and state."

Du You said: "Near the army, markets engage in extraordinary profiteering. At the time, people pursue quick gains, but in the end, wealth is exhausted and both households and the state are drained."

Mei Yaochen said: "Those far away supply labor for transport, while those nearby profiteer through exorbitant prices—both are paths to impoverishing the state and depleting the people."

Wang Zhe said: "Distant transport wearies the people and wastes resources; nearby markets inflate prices. Thus, prolonged warfare exhausts the state."

Cao Cao said: "Once the army crosses the border, those near the troops demand wealth and sell at high prices." (Wang Zhe noted this refers to the moment of crossing.)

Zhang Yu said: "The people near the army, seeking profit, inflate the prices of their goods for those who come from afar to transport supplies, leaving their wealth no choice but to be exhausted. When wealth is exhausted, urgency in levies follows."

Zhang Yu said: "When financial and material resources are depleted, the levies of the *qiu* and *jing* grow urgent and difficult to meet." (Some say *qiu* levies refer to the system of *qiu jia* instituted by Duke Cheng of Lu, where, in times of urgent need, *qiu* and *dian* levies were imposed, deviating from normal regulations. A *qiu* comprises sixteen *jing*, and a *dian* sixty-four *jing*.)

When strength is exhausted and wealth depleted, the Central Plains grow hollow within. The people’s expenses consume seven-tenths of their resources.

Cao Cao said: "*Qiu* refers to sixteen *jing*. When the army does not disband, grain transport exhausts the people’s strength in the fields, and seven-tenths of their resources are lost."

Li Quan said: "When war drags on without end, men and women grow resentful and lonely, burdened by transport and *qiu* levies. Strength is exhausted, wealth depleted, and the people’s expenses consume seven-tenths of their resources."

Du Mu said: "The *Methods of the Sima* states: Six *chi* make a *bu*, a hundred *bu* make a *mu*, a hundred *mu* make a *fu*, three *fu* make a *wu*, three *wu* make a *jing*, four *jing* make a *yi*, four *yi* make a *qiu*, and four *qiu* make a *dian*. A *qiu* thus comprises sixteen *jing*. A *qiu* provides one warhorse, four oxen; a *dian* provides four warhorses, sixteen oxen. A *qiu* supplies one chariot, three armored soldiers, and seventy-two foot soldiers. Here, with the army undispersed, *qiu* levies grow ever more urgent, the people’s grain and wealth are exhausted, and their strength is spent in the fields, with seven-tenths of their household resources consumed."

Chen Hao said: "*Qiu* means to gather. Gathering levies and corvée labor to meet military needs thus depletes wealth from the people, leaving none untroubled."

Wang Shi said: "Urgency refers to levies exceeding normal taxation, as when Duke Cheng of Lu instituted *qiu jia*. In such cases, the people’s expenses exceed half." (The text mentions "seven-tenths" to highlight the disparity between public and private expenses.)

Cao Cao said: "*Qiu* comprises sixteen *jing*. When the army does not disband, grain transport exhausts the people’s strength in the fields."

He Shi said: "The state is founded on the people, and the people depend on food for survival. Those who govern must cherish these resources."

Zhang Yu said: "Transporting grain exhausts strength; supplying provisions depletes wealth. The people of the fields see their household resources hollowed out, with seven-tenths of their expenses consumed."

The state’s expenses—broken chariots, worn-out horses, armor, bows and arrows, halberds, shields, large oxen, and heavy wagons—consume six-tenths of its resources. (One version reads seven-tenths.)

Cao Cao said: "*Qiu* oxen refer to oxen from *qiu* villages. Heavy wagons are long-hubbed carts."

Li Quan said: "*Qiu* means great. These items are all military necessities. The text speaks of the state’s expenses, near and far, with seven-tenths of its resources lost."

Mei Yaochen said: "The people’s contributions of wealth, grain, and labor to the army consume seven-tenths of their resources; the state’s contributions of oxen, horses, and equipment consume six-tenths. Thus, exhausting levies and pursuing war impoverish the people, while urgent corvée and poverty hollow out the state."

Wang Zhe said: "*Xun* means shield. *Bi* can be used for cover. *Lu* are large shields. *Qiu* oxen are what the ancients called "one horse and one *qiu* ox." *Da che* are ox-drawn wagons. The *Yi* states: "Great wagons bear their loads." Zhang Yu said: "Chariots and horses are the foundation of warfare, so the text first speaks of worn-out chariots and exhausted horses. *Bi* and *lu* are shields—today called *pengpai*. *Qiu* oxen are large oxen. *Da che* are leather-covered supply wagons. The first mention of broken chariots and weary horses refers to the war chariots used in attack and battle. The next mention of *qiu* oxen and *da che* refers to the leather-covered supply wagons. Even the state’s chariots, horses, and equipment suffer six-tenths loss. Thus, a wise commander ensures provisions are taken from the enemy: one *zhong* of enemy grain is worth twenty of ours, and one *dan* of enemy fodder is worth twenty of ours."

Cao Cao said: "Six *hu* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. *Cong* are bean stalks. *Gan* are grain stalks. One *dan* is one hundred twenty *jin*. The method of transport costs twenty *dan* to deliver one. Another version reads: *Cong*, pronounced *ji*, means beans. Seventy *jin* make one *dan*. 'Worth twenty of ours' refers to the cost of long-distance transport."

Du Mu said: "Six *shi* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. One *shi* is one hundred twenty *jin*. *Cong* are bean stalks. *Gan* are grain stalks. Some say *cong* refers to the leaves. When Qin attacked the Xiongnu, it mobilized the empire to transport grain, starting from the coastal commanderies of Huang and Langya, conveying it to Beihe. Roughly thirty *zhong* were expended to deliver one *dan*. During Emperor Wu of Han’s reign, when he opened communications with the Western Regions, tens of thousands labored. Transporting provisions a thousand *li* on foot required over ten *zhong* to deliver one *dan*. Comparing this to Sunzi’s statement—one *zhong* of enemy grain being worth twenty of ours—he likely refers to the cost of transporting provisions a thousand *li* on level ground, where twenty *dan* are spent to deliver one. Without specifying distance, the text may be incomplete. *Huang* is pronounced *zhirui* or *shui*, in Donglai. Beihe is today’s Shuofang Commandery."

Li Quan said: "Transporting one *zhong* of grain over long distances costs twenty *zhong* before it reaches the army. A wise commander seeks provisions from the enemy to spare his own expenses."

Meng Shi said: "Ten *hu* make one *zhong*. Calculating transport over a thousand *li*, with losses along the way, twenty *zhong* are needed to deliver one *zhong* to the army."

Mei Yaochen’s annotation agrees with Cao Cao’s.

Wang Zhe said: "Cao Cao states: *Cong* are bean stalks; *gan* are leaves. One *dan* is one hundred twenty *jin*. The method of transport costs twenty to deliver one. The earlier reference to transporting provisions a thousand *li* implies that the transport method applies to that distance. *Cong* is now written as *ji*. *Gan* was mistakenly written as *yu* in old texts and should be *gan*."

Zhang Yu said: "Six *shi* and four *dou* make one *zhong*. One hundred twenty *jin* make one *dan*. *Cong* are bean stalks. *Gan* are grain leaves. Transporting provisions a thousand *li* costs twenty *zhong* or *dan* to deliver one *zhong* or *dan* to the army. If the route is perilous, the cost is even greater. Thus, when Qin campaigned against the Xiongnu, thirty *zhong* were expended to deliver one *dan*. This shows that a capable commander seizes provisions from the enemy. Therefore, those who slay the enemy are roused by anger."

Cao Cao said: "By displaying wrath to intimidate the enemy."

Li Quan said: "Anger refers to military might."

Du Mu said: "Not all ten thousand men can be equally enraged; the commander must incite them with circumstances. When Tian Dan defended Jimo, he had the Yan army mutilate deserters and dig up the graves of the city’s dead—such acts exemplify this."

Jia Lin said: "Without anger, men will not kill."

Wang Xi said: "The army’s power lies in its wrath."

He Shi said: "When Yan besieged Jimo in Qi, they mutilated Qi’s deserters, enraging the people of Jimo and strengthening their resolve to defend the city. Tian Dan then spread rumors: 'We fear the Yan army will dig up our ancestral graves outside the city and desecrate our forebears—this chills our hearts.' The Yan army proceeded to excavate the graves and burn the corpses. The people of Jimo, watching from the city walls, wept and their fury multiplied tenfold. Knowing his soldiers were ready, Tian Dan crushed the Yan forces. Later, when Ban Chao was sent to the Western Regions and arrived in Shanshan, he gathered his thirty-six officers and men to drink. As the wine flowed, he roused them: 'We are all in this remote land, seeking great deeds and wealth. The barbarian envoys have arrived for only a few days, yet the king’s courtesy has already waned. If they hand us over to the Xiongnu, our bones will forever feed jackals.' His officers replied: 'In this land of peril, we live or die with you.' Ban Chao said: 'One who does not enter the tiger’s den will not catch its cubs. Our only course is to attack the barbarians by night with fire, making them think our numbers vast. Their terror will allow us to annihilate them. Destroying them will secure our success.' The men agreed: 'Well said.'"

At the first watch of the night, Ban Chao led his officers and men to rush the barbarian camp. Just then, a great wind arose. Ban Chao ordered ten men to take drums and hide behind the barbarians’ quarters, instructing them: "When you see the fire rise, all must beat the drums and shout loudly." The rest were to take bows and crossbows, lying in ambush on either side of the gate. Ban Chao set fire to the camp with the wind, and the barbarians, thrown into panic, were all burned to death.

Earlier, Pang Tong had urged Liu Bei to seize Yi Province from its governor, Liu Zhang. Liu Bei replied: "This is a grave matter; it cannot be done in haste." Later, when Liu Zhang sent Liu Bei to attack Zhang Lu, Liu Bei requested ten thousand troops and supplies from Liu Zhang for his eastward march. Liu Zhang granted only four thousand soldiers, and the rest of the provisions were halved. Thereupon, Liu Bei roused his men, saying: "I have led you to campaign against a formidable foe in Yi Province. Our forces have toiled without rest. Now, though we have amassed wealth in the treasury, we are too timid to reward merit. How can we expect the officers and men to fight with their lives?" Thus, they united to defeat Liu Zhang.

Zhang Yu said: "Rouse our soldiers so that all, from top to bottom, share the same anger, and the enemy can be slain."

*The Wei Liaozi* states: "What makes the people fight is *qi*. By this is meant that when *qi* is roused to anger, every man will fight of his own accord. What draws the enemy’s advantage is wealth."

Cao Cao said: "Without wealth, soldiers will not come; without rewards, soldiers will not go."

Li Quan said: "Wealth is what enriches the army’s resources."

Du Mu said: "What makes soldiers see the enemy’s advantage as worth taking is wealth. By this is meant that when they seize the enemy’s goods, these are used as rewards, so that all men are filled with desire and each fights for himself."

Later, during the Han dynasty, Du Shang, Inspector of Jing Province, campaigned against the rebel leaders Bu Yang and Pan Hong of Gui Province. Advancing into Nanhai, he broke three of their strongholds and seized many treasures. Yet Pan Hong’s forces still held together in great numbers, and the soldiers, grown arrogant and wealthy, had lost their fighting spirit. Du Shang said: "Bu Yang and Pan Hong have been rebels for ten years and are well-versed in attack and defense. We must combine the strength of several commanderies to defeat them. For now, let the army freely hunt and pursue game." The soldiers rejoiced, and all, great and small, went out to hunt. Du Shang then secretly sent men to set fire to their camp, reducing all their accumulated treasures to ashes. When the hunters returned, none could hold back their tears. Du Shang said: "Bu Yang and his men have enough wealth to enrich several generations. You, gentlemen, have only failed to unite your strength. What was lost was but a trifle—why take it to heart?" Hearing this, the men were all stirred to indignation and eager to fight. Du Shang ordered the horses to be fed and the men to eat their fill, then at dawn they marched straight for the rebels’ stronghold. Bu Yang and Pan Hong, unprepared, were overwhelmed by the soldiers’ ferocity and utterly defeated. This is just such a case.

Meng Shi’s commentary agrees with Du Mu’s.

Du You states: When men know that victory over the enemy brings rich rewards, they will brave flashing blades and face arrows and stones, advancing gladly into battle—all lured by the promise of wealth, merit, and recompense for their toil.

Mei Yaochen observes: To slay the enemy is to rouse our men with wrath; to seize the enemy’s goods is to entice our men with wealth.

Wang Zhe remarks: This means offering generous rewards. If the men are left to claim spoils for themselves, they may disregard discipline.

Zhang Yu says: By dangling wealth before the troops and letting each man fight for his own gain, the enemy’s riches may be taken. Thus it is said: Where rewards are great, brave men will surely appear.

During the reign of our dynasty’s Grand Ancestor, when generals were sent to conquer Shu, he instructed them: “Whatever cities and towns you capture, empty the treasury to feast the soldiers. What the state desires is only land and territory.” Thereupon, officers and men fought to the death, every place they reached fell, and Shu was pacified.

In chariot warfare, if ten or more enemy chariots are captured, reward the first to seize them. Cao Cao notes: When chariot forces capture ten or more enemy chariots, they are to be rewarded. Why does the text say “reward the first to seize them” rather than “reward those who capture ten or more chariots”? It is to make clear that the soldiers who actually took the chariots are to be rewarded.

The method for arraying chariots: five chariots form a squadron, led by one *pushe*; ten chariots form a company, led by one *zuchang*; when the number reaches ten chariots, two officers are assigned. Following this structure, rewards are bestowed to ensure that the commander’s favor reaches down to the ranks.

Some say: If a unit with ten or more chariots engages the enemy, only those who have rendered merit are rewarded. If fewer than ten chariots are captured—even if only one is taken—the other nine are also rewarded, to encourage all to advance. Li Quan states: Heavy rewards spur men forward.

Du Mu explains: Capturing ten or more chariots is the result of the whole force’s effort. If rewards are too narrowly given, they will not suffice. The state should use the captured chariots and their contents to generously reward those who first devised the plan or led the charge, thereby encouraging the troops. Thus the earlier passage states: “What entices men to seize the enemy’s advantages is wealth.” The mention of ten chariots is merely to set the standard.

Jia Lin remarks: This spurs those who have not yet succeeded to strive harder.

Mei Yaochen notes: Narrow rewards cannot reach all, so by rewarding one, a hundred are encouraged.

Wang Zhe says: Reward with wealth the soldiers who first seized the chariots.

Zhang Yu observes: A single chariot requires nearly seventy-five men. If our forces capture ten or more enemy chariots in battle, no fewer than a thousand of our men must have been involved. Because the number is so great, rewards cannot be narrowly given; instead, those who first broke the enemy lines and seized the chariots are generously rewarded to inspire the rest.

In ancient warfare, chariots were used to capture chariots, cavalry to capture cavalry, and infantry to capture infantry. Thus Wu Qi, when battling the Qin, commanded his three armies: “If charioteers do not capture enemy chariots, cavalrymen do not capture enemy cavalry, and foot soldiers do not capture enemy infantry, even if the army is victorious, no merit will be recognized.” He then changed the enemy’s banners and flags. Cao Cao adds: “To match our own.”

Li Quan says: "Their ill-favored colors match our own."
Jia Lin says: "So they will not be recognized."
Zhang Yu says: "Change the enemy’s colors to match our own. When chariots are mixed and ridden,
Cao Cao says: "Do not rely on them alone."
Li Quan says: "The banners of surrendered captives must have their colors altered and their functions intermingled before their chariots can be used."
Du Mu says: "When soldiers capture enemy chariots on their own, they may ride them freely without official record."
Mei Yaochen says: "Chariots may be mixed in use, but banners must not retain their former appearance."
Wang Shi says: "When enemy chariots are captured, they may be interspersed with our own."
Zhang Yu says: "Our chariots and the enemy’s are used together in mixed formation; they must not be relied upon alone. Treat the captured soldiers well and provide for them,
Zhang Yu says: "The captured soldiers must be nurtured with kindness and trust so they may be employed in our service."
This is called "defeating the enemy and increasing one’s strength."
Cao Cao says: "Increasing one’s own strength."
Li Quan says: "Later, Emperor Guangwu of the Han defeated the Tongma rebels in Nanyang, capturing tens of thousands of prisoners. He assigned them to various units, yet their hearts remained unsettled. Guangwu ordered them to return to their original camps and then visited them unguarded to offer his regards. They said to one another, ‘The Prince of Xiao lays his heart bare and places it in our bellies—how could we not pledge our lives to him?’ Thus the Han grew ever stronger. This is the meaning of the passage."

Du Mu says: To gain enemy soldiers is to utilize the enemy’s resources to augment one’s own strength.
Mei Yaochen says: When capturing soldiers, employ their strengths, nurture them with kindness, and thus turn them to our service.
Wang Zhe says: When enemy soldiers are captured, should they be treated the same as our own? The "good" here means not to humiliate them. If one lavishes care upon newly surrendered troops, it may instead lose their hearts.
He Shi says: By leveraging the enemy to defeat the enemy, how can one not grow stronger?
Zhang Yu says: To defeat the enemy and seize their chariots and soldiers, then employ them for our use, is to increase one’s own strength. This is like Guangwu laying his heart bare, causing each man to pledge his life in return.

Thus, in warfare, victory is valued, not prolonged campaigns.
Cao Cao says: Prolonged campaigns are disadvantageous.
War is like fire—if not restrained, it will burn itself out.
Meng Shi says: Speed in victory and swift return are paramount.
Mei Yaochen says: All the above emphasizes haste. Haste conserves resources and spares the people’s strength.
He Shi says: Sunzi begins and ends by discussing the perils of prolonged warfare, for he deeply understood that war must not be trifled with, nor military power abused.
Zhang Yu says: Prolonged campaigns exhaust troops and deplete resources, making mutiny more likely. Thus, only swift victory and rapid return are valued.

Therefore, the general who understands warfare is the arbiter of the people’s lives, the master of the nation’s safety.
Cao Cao says: A worthy general ensures the nation’s stability.
Li Quan says: The general holds the power of life and death, the authority to repel enemies. The people’s fate and the nation’s safety rest upon him.
Du Mu says: The people’s lives and the nation’s safety all depend on the general.
Mei Yaochen says: This speaks to the weight of the general’s responsibility.
Wang Zhe says: A worthy general preserves the people’s lives and secures the nation; otherwise, the people suffer and the nation is imperiled. How can a wise ruler not be discerning in his appointments?
He Shi says: The people’s lives and the nation’s order all hinge on the general. The difficulty of finding such a general has been a constant from ancient times to the present.
Zhang Yu says: The people’s survival and the nation’s safety depend on whether the general is worthy.

*Sunzi Annotation, Scroll Three*
*Strategic Assault*

Cao Cao says: To attack the enemy, one must first plan.
Li Quan says: Arraying forces for battle is called "war"; besieging cities is called "attack." This chapter follows "War" in sequence.
Du Mu says: When calculations in the ancestral temple are settled, war implements and provisions fully prepared, one may then plan the attack. Hence it is called "Strategic Assault."
Wang Xi says: In planning an attack, weigh the enemy’s advantages and disadvantages, employ comprehensive strategies to subdue them, and avoid recklessly resorting to armed assault or siege.
Zhang Yu says: Once plans are finalized and preparations complete, one may then employ wisdom and strategy to attack, hence this chapter follows "War."

Sunzi says: In the principles of warfare, subduing the enemy’s state intact is supreme; destroying the state is secondary.
Cao Cao says: Advancing deep into enemy territory, encircling their cities, cutting off their internal and external communications, and compelling the entire state to submit is supreme. Defeating them through force and seizing the state is secondary.
Li Quan says: Victory without slaughter is prized. Han Xin captured Wei Bao, seized Xia Yue, and slew Cheng Anjun—these were cases of destroying the state. Yet when he adopted Guangwu Jun’s strategy, turned north toward Yan, and dispatched a single envoy with a letter, Yan subsequently submitted without resistance—this was subduing the state intact.
Jia Lin says: To fully secure the enemy’s state while preserving one’s own is supreme.
Du You says: Compelling the enemy state to submit is supreme; defeating them through force is secondary.
Wang Xi says: As when Han Xin subdued Yan.
He Shi says: Using tactics and momentum to make the enemy surrender their state is the highest strategy.
Zhang Yu says: The *Weiliaozi* states: "Assess the enemy’s strength, disrupt their morale, and scatter their forces. Though their form remains intact, they become useless—this is victory through strategy. Breaking their armies, slaying their generals, scaling walls, triggering siege engines, assembling troops to seize territory—this is victory through force." Thus, what is called victory through strategy or force corresponds to subduing the state intact or destroying it. When punishing the wicked and aiding the people, complete victory is supreme; when compelled to resort to destruction, it is secondary.

Subduing the enemy’s army intact is supreme; destroying their army is secondary.
Cao Cao and Du Mu say: The *Methods of Sima* states: 15,500 men constitute an army.
He Shi says: Inducing their cities to surrender without destroying one’s own forces.
Subduing the enemy’s brigade intact is supreme; destroying their brigade is secondary.
Cao Cao says: 500 men constitute a brigade.
Subduing the enemy’s company intact is supreme; destroying their company is secondary.
Cao Cao says: From one company down to 100 men.
Li Quan says: 100 men and above constitute a company.
Du You says: From one company down to 100 men.
Subduing the enemy’s squad intact is supreme; destroying their squad is secondary.
Cao Cao says: From 100 men down to five.
Li Quan says: Below 100 men constitute a squad.
Du Mu says: Five men constitute a squad.
Mei Yaochen says: The greater the planning, the more complete the victory.
Wang Xi says: Whether an army, company, or squad, regardless of size, subduing them intact enhances one’s prestige and virtue, while destroying them diminishes it.
He Shi says: From armies to squads, all are ranked in order of superiority. The essence is to employ strategy to secure victory, for not only an entire army but even a single squad must not be destroyed without necessity.
Zhang Yu says: According to Zhou regulations, 12,500 men constitute an army, 500 a brigade, 100 a company, and five a squad. From armies to squads, victory without battle is supreme.

Thus, to fight a hundred battles and win a hundred victories is not the acme of excellence.
Cao Cao says: To make the enemy submit without fighting is the true victory.
Li Quan says: To defeat the enemy through strategy.
Chen Hao says: Because battle inevitably entails killing.
Jia Lin says: When military might spreads far and wide, compelling the enemy to surrender intact, this is supreme. Employing deception and stratagems to crush the enemy’s forces, inflicting harm and destruction before securing victory, is secondary.
Du You says: To make the enemy submit without fighting.
Mei Yaochen says: How detestable is killing and destruction!
Zhang Yu says: Victory achieved only after battle must involve much slaughter, hence it is not the highest excellence.

To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of excellence.
Cao Cao says: To make the enemy submit without fighting.
Du Mu says: To defeat the enemy through strategy.
Chen Hao says: Han Xin, employing Li Zuoche’s plan, dispatched a letter and seized Yan without battle.
Meng Shi says: This is victory through the ancestral temple.
Wang Xi says: Warfare values defeating the enemy’s strategy, not engaging in battle.
He Shi says: During the Later Han, Wang Ba attacked Zhou Jian and Su Mao. After battle, he returned to camp, and the enemy regrouped to provoke another fight. Ba remained resolutely in his tent. As he feasted his troops and musicians played, Mao’s arrows rained down, one striking the goblet before Ba, yet he sat unmoved. His officers said, "Mao is already defeated; now is the time to strike." Ba replied, "Not so. Mao’s troops are mercenaries, far from their supplies, and seek a quick victory through provocation. By closing our camp and resting our troops, we achieve what is called subduing the enemy without fighting—the acme of excellence." Mao then withdrew.
Zhang Yu says: Enforcing rewards and punishments, ensuring the reliability of signals, maintaining equipment, training troops, and exposing one’s strengths to make the enemy submit like grass bending in the wind—this is the greatest excellence. As when the King of Wu convened at Huangchi, the Jin, awed by his discipline, submitted.

Thus, the supreme military strategy is to attack the enemy’s plans.
Cao Cao says: When the enemy first formulates plans, it is easy to thwart them.
Li Quan says: To thwart their initial strategy. During the Later Han, Kou Xun besieged Gao Jun. Jun dispatched his strategist Huangfu Wen to meet Xun, but Wen’s words and demeanor were unyielding. Xun executed him and reported to Jun, "Your military advisor was insolent; I have slain him. If you wish to surrender, do so swiftly; if not, prepare to defend."

Gao Jun opened his fortifications and surrendered that very day. The generals asked, "How is it that by killing his envoy, you caused his city to surrender?" Kou Xun replied, "Huangfu Wen was Jun’s trusted advisor, the one who devised his strategies. Had we kept him, he would have gained insight into our plans; by killing him, we shattered Jun’s courage—this is what is meant by 'the supreme military strategy is to attack the enemy’s plans.'" The generals said, "This is beyond our understanding."

Du Mu says: When the Duke Ping of Jin sought to attack Qi, he sent Fan Zhao to observe their state. Duke Jing of Qi offered him wine. As the drinking grew lively, Fan Zhao requested to drink from the ruler’s own goblet. The Duke said, "Serve the guest from my goblet." After Fan Zhao drank, Yanzi removed the goblet and had another poured. Fan Zhao feigned drunkenness, rose in displeasure, and began to dance, saying to the grand master, "Can you play for me the music of Chengzhou? I shall dance to it." The grand master replied, "Your servant is untrained in it." Fan Zhao hastily departed. Duke Jing said, "Jin is a great state, and has come to observe our governance. Now you have angered their envoy—what is to be done?" Yanzi replied, "I saw that Fan Zhao was not one ignorant of ritual. Moreover, he sought to shame our state, so I did not comply." The grand master said, "The music of Chengzhou is the music of the Son of Heaven, to be danced only by the ruler. Now Fan Zhao, a mere subject, wished to dance to the Son of Heaven’s music—so I did not play it." Fan Zhao returned and reported to Duke Ping of Jin, saying, "Qi cannot yet be attacked. I sought to humiliate their ruler, but Yanzi saw through it; I sought to violate their ritual, but the grand master recognized it."

Confucius said, "Without overstepping the space between wine vessel and meat platter, one may yet repel an enemy a thousand *li* away—this describes Yanzi.

During the Spring and Autumn period, Qin attacked Jin, and Jin’s commander Zhao Dun led the defense. The deputy commander of the upper army, Yu Pian, said, ‘Qin cannot sustain a long campaign; let us deepen our ramparts and fortify our troops to await them.’ The Qin forces wished to fight, and the Duke of Qin asked Shi Hui, ‘How should we engage them?’ Shi Hui replied, ‘The Zhao clan has recently promoted one of their retainers, Yu Pian, who must be the architect of this strategy, intending to wear down our forces. The Zhao have a collateral kinsman named Chuan, son-in-law to the Lord of Jin, favored yet weak, uninvolved in military affairs, reckless and headstrong, and resentful of Yu Pian’s appointment as deputy commander of the upper army. If we provoke the impetuous among them, it may succeed.’

The Qin army ambushed Jin’s upper army. Zhao Chuan pursued but could not overtake them; returning in fury, he said, ‘We pack provisions and don armor, seeking battle—yet when the enemy arrives, we do not strike. What are we waiting for?’ The army’s officers replied, ‘The commander has his reasons.’ Chuan said, ‘I know nothing of strategy; I will go out alone.’ And so he led his troops forth.

Zhao Dun said, ‘If Qin captures Chuan, they will have taken a minister. If Qin returns victorious, how shall we answer?’ Thus, all forces sallied forth, and the armies clashed before withdrawing.

Yanzi’s response was this: when the enemy plotted to attack us, we first thwarted their scheme, so the enemy could not attack us. Shi Hui’s response was this: when we plotted to attack the enemy, the enemy devised a counter-strategy, so we thwarted their plan, and the enemy could not engage us in battle. Both cases involved thwarting strategy.

Thus, when the enemy plots against us, we strike at their unformed schemes; when we plot against the enemy, we shatter their already-formed plans—this is not limited to a single method.

Master Meng said, ‘Nine attacks and nine repulsions—this is strategy.’ Du You said, ‘When the enemy devises a plan to mobilize their forces, thwarting it is the highest course.’ Thus, the Grand Duke said, ‘He who excels at eliminating peril addresses it before it arises; he who excels at defeating the enemy triumphs where no form yet exists.’

Mei Yaochen said, ‘Victory through wisdom.’ Wang Xi said, ‘Subduing the enemy through strategy is the highest art.’ He Shi said, ‘When the enemy first plots to attack us, we strike first—this is easy. Discerning the enemy’s strategic intent and then deploying forces to attack the very inception of their resolve is the way.’ Zhang Yu said, ‘When the enemy first devises a plan, we attack it, and they will lose their scheme and submit—Yanzi’s thwarting of Fan Zhao is an example.’

Some say: *Thwarting strategy* means using strategy to attack others, achieving victory without battle through ingenious and clandestine calculations—the highest form of warfare. The next is *thwarting alliances*.

Cao Cao said, ‘Alliances are about to be formed.’ Li Quan said, ‘Thwart their initial alliances.’ When Su Qin bound the six states in a pact against Qin, Qin shut its passes for fifteen years, not daring to gaze eastward. Du Mu said, ‘It is not only about alliances about to be formed—any alliance can be thwarted.’ When Zhang Yi offered Qin’s six hundred *li* of land to King Huai of Chu, urging him to sever ties with Qi, and when Sui He killed Chu’s envoys in Han Xin’s presence to cut off Xiang Yu, when Cao Cao conversed with Han Sui on horseback to sow doubt in Ma Chao, when Gao Yang sent Xiao Shenming to sue for peace with Liang to cast suspicion on Hou Jing, leading to the fall of Taicheng—all these were cases of thwarting alliances. The art of power shifts and changes, not confined to one path.

Chen Hao said, ‘Some say: when the enemy has already mobilized and formed alliances, defeating them is the next best course.’ As when Duke Wen of Jin opposed Song, alienating Cao and Wei. Master Meng said, ‘Forming alliances with strong states deters the enemy from scheming.’ Mei Yaochen said, ‘Victory through might.’ Wang Xi said, ‘When one cannot fully subdue the enemy’s strategy, one should instead disrupt their alliances, causing them to dissolve. When they are allied, the enemy is vast and formidable; when they are not, the enemy is small and brittle.’ He Shi said, ‘Du’s four points above embody the principle of drawing close only to drive apart. *Thwarting alliances* means that when armies are about to engage, one deploys deceptive forces to intimidate the enemy, leaving them unable to advance or retreat, thus forcing their submission. With neighboring states as our allies, the enemy cannot but be isolated and weakened.’ Zhang Yu said, ‘When armies are about to join battle, strike before they unite. As the saying goes, “He who strikes first seizes the enemy’s will.” When two armies are about to engage, strike first—Sun Shu’ao’s defeat of Jin’s forces and the chef Pu’s rout of the Hua clan are examples.’

Some say: *Thwarting alliances* means using alliances to attack others. Before launching an attack on the enemy, first ally with neighboring states to create a pincer formation, thus strengthening ourselves and weakening the enemy. The next is *thwarting forces*.

Cao Cao said, ‘The enemy’s forces are already formed.’ Li Quan said, ‘Confronting the enemy in battle array is the lowest course.’ Jia Lin said, ‘Excelling in attack and conquest, leaving no strategy unexhausted, is the next best.’ Thus, the Grand Duke said, ‘He who contends for victory at the edge of the blade is no good general.’ Mei Yaochen said, ‘Victory through battle.’ Wang Xi said, ‘Battle is a perilous affair.’ Zhang Yu said, ‘When one cannot defeat the enemy’s initial strategy or disrupt their alliances, one must prevail with sharp weapons. *Forces* is the general term for arms and armor.’ The Grand Duke said, ‘The way to certain victory lies in weapons as treasure.’ The lowest is *attacking cities*.

Cao Cao said, ‘When the enemy has gathered their supplies and fortified their cities, attacking them is the lowest course.’ Li Quan said, ‘When the king’s army crosses the border, and the enemy opens their gates in submission, bearing coffins to the camp’s entrance, the people rejoicing—attacking them is the highest course. But if one lingers beneath a fortified city, the army grows weary, the soldiers indolent, the balance of attack and defense unequal, the disparity in strength between guest and host doubled—attacking under such conditions is the lowest course.’ Du You said, ‘Attacking cities and slaughtering towns is the lowest form of attack, for the harm it inflicts is great.’ Mei Yaochen said, ‘Expending wealth and labor is the lowest.’"

Wang Xi said: "Soldiers are killed and wounded, yet the city may still not be taken." Zhang Yu said: "Attacking cities and slaughtering towns not only exhausts the army and wastes resources, but also inflicts great harm—this is the lowest form of attack. The method of attacking cities is a last resort." Zhang Yu said: "Attacking cities depletes strength; the reason one must attack is simply because there is no other choice. Preparing *lu*, *fenwen*, and assembling siege engines takes three months to complete, and constructing siege ramps takes another three months."

Cao Cao said: "*Xiu* means to prepare. *Lu* is a large shield. *Fenwen* is shaped like a *fen*; its lower part has four wheels, and it is pushed from within to reach the city walls. *Ju* means to prepare. *Qixie* is the general term for mechanical devices used in attack and defense, such as flying towers and cloud ladders. *Juyin* refers to piling earth forward to approach the city walls." Li Quan said: "*Lu* is a shield used to cover the head while advancing to the city walls. *Fenwen* is a four-wheeled vehicle that conceals dozens of soldiers inside; it is pushed forward to fill moats, and neither wood nor stone can destroy it. *Qixie* includes flying towers, cloud ladders, wooden shelters, and bamboo screens. *Juyin* refers to earthworks built to scale the city walls. When Gao Huan of Eastern Wei besieged Jinzhou and Hou Jing attacked Taicheng, these were the devices they used. The labor is limited to three months to prevent the troops from growing weary over time."

Du Mu said: "*Lu* is what is now called a *pengpai*. *Fenwen* is a four-wheeled vehicle made of large wooden planks, covered with raw oxhide on top, and capable of holding ten men inside. It is used to transport earth to fill moats, and neither wood nor stone can harm it—what is now commonly called a *wooden donkey*. *Juyin* refers to piling earth to form what is now called a *rampart*. The three months mentioned refer to a season. It takes time to prepare the siege engines and construct the ramps properly, lest the harm to the soldiers be too great. As Guanzi said: 'Those who cannot govern their weapons will be trapped,' meaning they will have nothing to counter the enemy. Taigong said: 'The way to certain victory is to treasure one’s weapons.' The *Book of Han* records: 'Among the thirteen schools of military techniques, there are those who train hands and feet, master mechanical devices, and establish victory in attack and defense.' For attacking cities, there are battering rams, hooking carts, flying ladders, toad-shaped siege engines, articulated carts, fox-deer carts, shadow carts, high-barrier carts, horse-head carts, single-march carts, and earth-transporting pig-fish carts."

Chen Hao said: "Du Mu’s claim that *lu* is a *pengpai* is incorrect. If it were a *pengpai*, then this character *lu* should be used. Cao Cao’s description of it as a large shield is somewhat closer. The text states that preparing the siege engines takes three months and constructing the ramps another three, totaling six months. If the general grows impatient and attacks prematurely, many soldiers will be killed. Hence the following line: 'If the general cannot restrain his anger and orders the troops to swarm the walls like ants, it will be a disaster.'" Du You said: "*Fenwen* means 'cool above and warm below.' *Juyin* refers to piling earth forward to approach the city. Piling earth to form a mound is called *yin*, used to reach the enemy city and observe its defenses. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records: 'Zifan, the Marshal of Chu, ascended the mound to observe the city of Song.'"

Mei Yaochen said: "When power and wisdom are insufficient to subdue the enemy, one has no choice but to attack the city, and preparing the siege equipment takes time." Cao Cao said: "*Lu* is a large shield. *Fenwen* is a *fen*-bed, with four wheels below, pushed from within to reach the city walls. *Qixie* is the general term for mechanical devices used in attack and defense, such as flying ladders." He added: "To call *lu* a large shield is incorrect. There are many tools of war—why single out the preparation of large shields? Nowadays, the defensive towers on city walls are called *lu*. Is *lu* not a *fen*-shaped structure with a leather roof to shield against arrows and stones?"

Zhang Yu said: "*Xiu lu* refers to large shields. The *Commentary* states: 'The Marquis of Jin ascended a *chao* cart to observe the Chu army.' The note explains: '*Chao* carts are carts with *lu* on top.' It also records: 'When the Jin army besieged Biyang, the men of Lu built wheels from large carts, covered them with armor to make *lu*, held them in the left hand, and wielded halberds in the right to form a unit.' The note explains: '*Lu* are large shields.' From this, it is clear that *xiu lu* refers to large shields. *Fenwen* is a four-wheeled vehicle that can cover dozens of men inside, used to transport earth to fill moats. *Qixie* is the general term for siege engines. The three months mentioned is an approximate time for completion. Some say: Sunzi warns against hasty attacks driven by anger, so he speaks of three months to prepare the engines and three months to build the ramps—though in reality, it may not take three months. If the city still cannot be taken, earth is piled to match its height, allowing soldiers to ascend, observe its defenses, or destroy its towers and shields, ensuring its capture. Such earthworks are called *yin*, as when Zifan of Chu ascended a mound to observe the city of Song. The completion of *qixie* is mentioned to emphasize the time required for preparation. The completion of *juyin* is noted because it takes time to finish the ascent. Both are described as last resorts. If the general cannot restrain his anger and orders the troops to swarm the walls like ants, killing a third of the soldiers while the city remains untaken, this is the disaster of attacking cities."

Cao Cao said: "If the general, in his anger, does not wait for the siege engines but orders the soldiers to scale the walls like ants climbing a wall, many will be killed or wounded." Li Quan said: "If the general, enraged, does not wait for the siege engines but orders the soldiers to scale the walls with their bare bodies like ants clinging to a wall, and a third are killed by wood and stone while the city remains untaken, this is the disaster of attacking cities." Du Mu said: "This refers to being humiliated by the enemy and unable to restrain one’s anger."

In the Later Wei, Emperor Taiwu led a hundred thousand troops to besiege Zang Zhi of the Liu-Song at Xuyi. Initially, Emperor Taiwu requested wine from Zhi, who sealed a jar of urine and sent it to him. Enraged, Taiwu ordered an assault on the city. He commanded his soldiers to scale the walls with their bare bodies, rotating in shifts—those who fell were replaced, none retreating, until the corpses piled as high as the ramparts. He also executed his High Beam King. After thirty days of such attacks, over half his forces perished. When Taiwu learned that Pengcheng had cut off his retreat and saw the multitude of sick and wounded, he withdrew. As the saying goes: "A single woman defending the city can match ten men." By this measure, the cost was far greater. Jia Lin said: "If the people’s hearts turn outward and the soldiers’ morale collapses within, the city falls of itself." Du You said: "If the siege drags past two seasons and the enemy remains unsubdued, the general, unable to restrain his fury, will send his soldiers swarming the walls like ants, killing or wounding a third of his own troops. Such hasty assaults, failing to take the city, only bring harm upon oneself." Thus Han Fei said: "A single defeat, and all is lost." He Shi said: "When the general’s heart is consumed by rage, he drives his soldiers to scale the walls like ants, and over half die, yet the city still stands—this is the disaster of attacking cities." Zhang Yu said: "If the siege exceeds two seasons and the enemy remains defiant, the general, impatient and unable to endure, will send his soldiers swarming the walls like ants. A third of his troops will be slaughtered by the defenders, yet the fortified city remains untaken—this is the calamity of attacking cities. Or it may be said: if the general, driven by fury, does not wait the full six months but hastily attacks, the harm will be the same."

Thus, one who excels in warfare subdues the enemy’s forces without battle.
Li Quan said: "To subdue the enemy through strategy, not combat."
The Jin general Guo Huai besieged Qucheng, and the Shu general Jiang Wei came to relieve it. Huai marched to Niutou Mountain, cutting off Wei’s supply lines and retreat. Wei was shaken and fled without a fight, and Qucheng surrendered. This is the meaning of subduing without battle.
Du Mu said: "When Zhou Yafu confronted the Seven Kingdoms, he encamped northeast of Changyi, abandoning Liang to Wu, and sent light troops to sever Wu’s supply lines. Wu and Liang exhausted each other, their provisions spent, and Wu retreated, whereupon Yafu pursued and crushed them. The Shu general Jiang Wei ordered Gou An and Li Shao to defend Qucheng, which the Wei general Chen Tai besieged. When Jiang Wei came to relieve them, emerging from Niutou Mountain to face Tai, Tai said: 'The essence of warfare lies in subduing the enemy without battle. Now, if we cut off Niutou, Wei will have no path of return—he will be ours for the taking.' The armies were ordered to hold their positions and not engage, severing Wei’s retreat. Wei, terrified, fled, and An and the others surrendered."
Mei Yaochen said: "Battle brings harm to men."
Wang Xi said: "As when Li Zuoche advised Cheng Anjun to dispatch three thousand elite troops to intercept Han Xin at Jingxing."
He Shi said: "This speaks of defeating the enemy’s strategies and alliances without resorting to battle." Thus the *Methods of Sima* states: "The highest strategy avoids combat." Its meaning is clear.
Zhang Yu said: "What was described earlier applies only to mediocre generals. One who excels in warfare acts otherwise: he may shatter the enemy’s plans, disrupt their alliances, sever their supplies, or cut off their retreat, thereby subduing them without battle. As when Tian Rangju clarified laws and commands, rallied his soldiers, and the states of Yan and Jin fled without fighting."

One who captures the enemy’s cities does so without assault.
Li Quan said: "By strategy."
During the Later Han, the Marquis of Zan, Zang Gong, besieged rebels at Yuanwu for months without success, his soldiers afflicted by disease. The Prince of Donghai said to Gong: "To encircle an enemy doomed to die with your army is no strategy. You should withdraw the siege, open a path for them, and feign retreat—once they scatter, a single constable could capture them." Gong followed this advice and took Yuanwu. The Wei assault on Huguan followed the same principle.
Du Mu said: "Sima Wenwang besieged Zhuge Dan at Shouchun. Many urged a swift assault, but Wenwang, knowing the city was well-fortified and heavily garrisoned, feared that a prolonged siege would exhaust his strength, and if reinforcements arrived, he would be trapped between two fires—this was the path to peril. Instead, he employed a comprehensive strategy to contain them. Dan rebelled in the second year, fifth month, and was destroyed in the third year, second month. The six armies remained encamped, digging deep moats and raising high ramparts, while Dan’s forces withered of their own accord. When the general of the Former Yan, Murong Ke, led troops to subdue Duan Kan at Guanggu, his officers urged him to attack swiftly. Ke said: 'In warfare, some victories come through patience, others through urgency. If our strength is evenly matched and they have strong external support, but we can contain them, we should encircle and wait for them to collapse.' He then built shelters and plowed the fields, tightening the siege. In the end, he took Guanggu without shedding blood."
Meng Shi said: "This speaks of subduing the enemy through awe and discipline, capturing cities without assault—like when the Earl of Zheng bared his chest to welcome King Zhuang of Chu."
Mei Yaochen said: "Assault wastes resources."
Wang Xi said: "As when Emperor Taizong of Tang accepted the surrender of Xue Rengao."
Zhang Yu said: "One may attack what the enemy must rescue, luring them to abandon the city and come to its aid, then ambush and capture them. As when Geng Yan attacked Linzi and took Xi’an, or threatened Juli and slew Fei Yi. Or one may sever their strong reinforcements and hold them in prolonged siege, waiting for them to collapse—as when the Chu army built shelters and plowed the fields to subdue Song. These are all examples of capturing cities without assault."

One who destroys the enemy’s state does so without protracted warfare.
Cao Cao said: "To annihilate a state, one must not expose the army for long."
Li Quan said: "By strategy, one destroys a state swiftly."
Emperor Wen of Sui asked his Prime Minister Gao Jiong for a strategy to conquer Chen. Jiong replied: "The harvest season beyond the Yangtze differs from that within the Central Plains."

"Seize their farming season when we are at leisure, mobilize troops for a surprise attack, forcing them to abandon farming for defense. Wait until they gather their forces, then withdraw. Repeat this two or three times, and their farming will be ruined. Moreover, the southern lands are low-lying, with dwellings made entirely of thatch and bamboo, and granaries and storehouses built among them. Secretly dispatch agents to set fires when the wind rises, then strike again when they rebuild their camps. Carrying out this plan will sicken Chen from the start.

Du Mu said: Exploit the enemy’s vulnerable position without missing the opportunity—like crushing withered wood. When Gaozu entered the Pass, when Jin subdued Sun Hao, and when Sui conquered Chen, none took long. Jia Lin said: War cannot be prolonged; protraction breeds change. Yet to destroy a state, one need not harm its people—when King Wu attacked Yin, the Yin people called him ‘father.’ Du You said: To punish tyranny and destroy an enemy state, one must not expose the army for long. Mei Yaochen said: Prolonged war invites change. Wang Xi’s note agrees with Mei Yaochen. He Shi said: A skilled attacker does not assault with arms but entraps with strategy, forcing the enemy to uproot itself, to destroy itself—no need for exhausting sieges. Zhang Yu said: Using right to punish wrong, wisdom to overcome folly, the army is not exposed for long, yet the enemy state falls—why delay for six months? One must contend for all under heaven with completeness, so the army is not worn down, and advantage is preserved. This is the method of strategic attack.

Cao Cao said: Do not engage the enemy in battle, yet secure complete victory, establishing supremacy without wearying the army or shedding blood. Li Quan said: Contend for all under heaven with a strategy of total victory, thus achieving success without weariness. Mei Yaochen said: ‘Complete contention’ means no battles, no assaults on cities, no prolonged destruction—all subdued by strategy. This is called ‘strategic attack.’ Thus, the army is not blunted, and advantage is preserved intact. Zhang Yu said: No battles mean no soldiers harmed; no assaults mean no strength exhausted; no protraction means no resources wasted. Establishing complete victory over all under heaven avoids the harm of wearying the army and shedding blood, while securing the benefits of a wealthy state and strong army. This is the art of strategic attack for a good general.

Thus, the method of using troops is: with ten times the enemy’s strength, surround them.

Cao Cao said: With ten against one, surround them—this assumes equal generals in wisdom and courage, and equal troops in sharpness and dullness. If the ruler is weak and the guest strong, one need not wait for tenfold strength, as when Cao Cao doubled his troops to surround Xiapi and capture Lü Bu. Du Mu said: ‘Surround’ means encircling on all sides to prevent the enemy’s escape. When encircling, one must position forces slightly farther from the enemy city, occupying a broad area with strict defenses. Without sufficient troops, gaps will appear—hence the need for tenfold strength. Lü Bu’s defeat stemmed from internal distrust: Hou Cheng seized Chen Gong and surrendered Lü Bu, enabling capture. This was not due to Cao Cao’s military strength. If distrust and disunity exist, even without a siege, the enemy would collapse—how much more so when surrounded? Thus, Sunzi’s ‘tenfold strength to surround’ assumes equal generals and troops, not that the enemy will self-destruct. Cao Cao’s claim of doubling troops to subdue Lü Bu was not due to siege pressure—this cannot serve as a model. Li Quan said: With equal wisdom and courage, ten times the enemy’s strength allows encirclement, for attack and defense are different in posture. Du You said: With ten against one, surround them—this assumes equal generals and troops. If the ruler is weak and the guest strong, tenfold strength is unnecessary, as when Cao Cao doubled his troops to surround Xiapi and capture Lü Bu. If the enemy’s fortifications are sturdy and they rely on natural barriers, then tenfold strength is required to encircle. Even if the enemy is strong, if their position is unfavorable, one need not wait for tenfold strength to surround them. Mei Yaochen said: With one against ten, encirclement is possible. He Shi said: ‘Surround’ means encircling a city with troops on all sides. Assessing the balance of forces and the generals’ wisdom and courage, if one has tenfold the enemy’s strength, then ten against one allows encirclement, preventing escape. Zhang Yu said: With ten times the enemy’s strength, encircle them on all sides—this assumes equal generals and troops. If the ruler is weak and the guest strong, tenfold strength is unnecessary for encirclement. The *Weiliaozi* states: In defense, one can hold against ten, ten against a hundred, a hundred against a thousand, a thousand against ten thousand—meaning ten defenders can hold against a hundred besiegers, aligning with this principle.

With five times the enemy’s strength, attack them.

Cao Cao said: With five against one, use three parts as the main force and one part as the奇 (unorthodox). Li Quan said: With five times the enemy’s strength, attack them—attack and defense differ in posture. Du Mu said: ‘Method’ here means ‘way.’ With five against one, take three parts of one’s forces as three routes to attack one side of the enemy, holding back two parts to exploit their unpreparedness with an unorthodox strike. In the late Western Wei, the Liangzhou Prefect Yuwen Zhonghe occupied the province and refused to submit. The Wei general Dugu Xin led troops to suppress him, and Zhonghe fortified the city and defended resolutely. Xin ordered his generals to attack the northeast with siege ladders by night, while he personally led troops to strike the southwest, thus capturing the city. Chen Hao said: With five times the enemy’s strength, one naturally has surplus force, while the enemy’s strength is divided—why limit the attack to three routes? This refers specifically to assaulting cities, as the following text states: ‘A small enemy’s stubbornness is the great enemy’s capture.’ Du You said: If the enemy consolidates their forces to defend and refuses battle, with five against one, one may attack."

Should the enemy lack both internal and external support, an assault need not await a fivefold advantage. Mei Yaochen concurs with Du You’s annotation.

Wang Xi said: If one encircles ten to seize five, the attacking force will invariably possess surplus strength, without needing to await the enemy’s exhaustion or laxity. The following also pertains to circumstances where wisdom, courage, advantage, and dullness are evenly matched.

He Shi said: When wit and bravery are equal, and one’s forces outnumber the enemy fivefold, one may divide troops—three parts to assault the city, two parts to execute a surprise maneuver and secure victory.

Zhang Yu said: With five times the enemy’s strength, one should feign an advance from the front while striking from the rear, or create clamor in the east while attacking from the west. Without a fivefold advantage, such stratagems cannot be employed. The Duke of Shou asserted that three methods constitute the orthodox approach, while two serve as the extraordinary—is this not so? If the enemy lacks external reinforcements but one possesses internal allies, an assault need not await a fivefold advantage.

When outnumbering the enemy, divide your forces.
Cao Cao said: With twice the enemy’s strength, one method serves as the orthodox, the other as the extraordinary.
Li Quan said: When one’s forces are double the enemy’s, half may be deployed as the extraordinary. With numerical superiority, movement becomes difficult to counter. Fu Jian, arriving at Feishui, failed to divide his forces and was defeated; Wang Sengbian, reaching Zhanggongzhou, divided his and triumphed.

Du Mu said: This is incorrect. When outnumbering the enemy two to one, one should dispatch a portion to strike the enemy’s vital points or attack what they must defend, compelling them to further divide their already divided forces, thereby enabling one’s own division to strike. The art of war does not hinge on numerical superiority; every formation possesses both orthodox and extraordinary elements, and the extraordinary is not contingent upon numerical advantage. At Wujiang, Xiang Yu, with but twenty-eight cavalry, did not mass them together but still arrayed them in orthodox and extraordinary formations, circulating and reinforcing one another—how much more so in other circumstances?

Chen Hao said: This simply means that when one’s forces are double the enemy’s, one should divide troops to strike what they must defend, thereby doubling the advantage within the doubled force to attack the enemy’s divided strength. Though Du grasped this, he did not fully expound it.

Du You said: With twice the enemy’s strength, one method serves as the orthodox, the other as the extraordinary. When outnumbered two to one, the disparity is insufficient to create variation, hence one employs feigned maneuvers to disperse the enemy’s forces. Thus, the Grand Duke said: Without the ability to divide and maneuver, one cannot speak of the extraordinary.

Mei Yaochen said: When outnumbered two to one, one may divide the enemy’s strength.
Wang Xi said: To divide means to split into two armies, compelling the enemy to face attacks from front and rear, thereby securing a twofold advantage.

He Shi said: When outnumbering the enemy, divide half as the extraordinary. With numerical superiority, one may readily divide forces. When host and guest are evenly matched, the superior commander prevails.

Zhang Yu said: With twice the enemy’s strength, one should divide into two forces: one to engage the front, the other to strike the rear. If the enemy responds to the front, attack from the rear; if they respond to the rear, attack from the front—this is what is meant by one method as orthodox, the other as extraordinary. Du failed to comprehend that division constitutes the extraordinary, while concentration constitutes the orthodox, and hastily criticized Cao Gong—how mistaken.

When evenly matched, one may still engage.
Cao Cao said: When one’s forces equal the enemy’s, the adept commander still employs ambushes and extraordinary maneuvers to secure victory.
Li Quan said: When host and guest are evenly matched, only the adept prevail.
Du Mu said: This is incorrect. Whenever one’s forces, whether numerous or few, and whether wise or dull, brave or hesitant, directly oppose the enemy, engagement is permissible. Ambushes may be set before or behind the enemy, or amid dense forests and thickets, or under the cover of dusk or darkness, or within narrow passes and mountain slopes, striking where the enemy is unprepared—this is called an ambush, not an extraordinary maneuver.

Chen Hao said: When one’s forces are equal to the enemy’s, one should first devise extraordinary plans to ensure victory before engaging. Thus, the following text states: If not superior, one should avoid battle. Du’s explanation of extraordinary and ambush tactics is apt.

Mei Yaochen said: When strength is equal, engage.
Wang Xi said: This refers to the adept commander’s ability to inspire troops to fight to the death. If one employs extraordinary maneuvers and ambushes to secure victory, this denotes superior wisdom, not mere numerical equality.

He Shi said: *Di* here denotes equality. Only the adept can secure victory.

Zhang Yu said: When evenly matched, one transforms the orthodox into the extraordinary and the extraordinary into the orthodox, creating endless variation to confound the enemy. Engaging thus is what is meant by employing extraordinary maneuvers and ambushes to secure victory. Du failed to grasp that every formation possesses both manifest and concealed elements, and that ambushes are not confined to mountains and forests—this is incorrect.

When outnumbered, one should evade.
Cao Cao said: Fortify high ramparts and strong defenses; do not engage.
Li Quan said: When one’s strength is inferior, fortify defenses and refuse battle to blunt the enemy’s edge, awaiting their exhaustion before launching a surprise attack. The Qi general Tian Dan, defending Jimo, set fire to ox tails and slew Qi Jie—this exemplifies the principle.

Du Mu said: When outnumbered, avoid the enemy’s edge and await an opportunity to strike decisively for victory. The "adept" refers to one who can endure humiliation and insult, refusing to emerge even when provoked—unlike Cao Jiu at Sishui.

Chen Hao said: This is incorrect. When the enemy outnumbers one’s forces, one should evade to inflate their arrogance, thereby facilitating future plans—not endure humiliation. The Taizong Emperor humiliated Song Laosheng to capture his troops—this was not due to unequal strength.

Jia Lin said: When outnumbered, conceal one’s forces to prevent the enemy from detecting them. One should set ambushes to await the enemy, employ deception to sow doubt—this too is a path to victory. Another interpretation: Conceal one’s forces so the enemy remains unaware of their disposition, fearing deception, and the entire army flees.

Du You said: Fortify high ramparts and strong defenses; do not engage.

When their forces are numerous and ours are few, and they cannot be opposed, one must flee and conceal one’s form. Mei Yaochen said: When their forces are numerous and ours are few, withdraw and do not engage. Wang Xi said: To flee is to lie in ambush—meaning one must rely on strong defenses and concealment to hold one’s ground. As the *Commentary* states: "The army fled into the palace of the lady." Yet there are cases where few troops prevail, for their generals are superior and their soldiers strong.

He Shi said: With few troops, fortify defenses, observe developments, and conceal one’s form—advancing only when opportunity arises. Zhang Yu said: When their forces are numerous and ours are few, it is fitting to withdraw and avoid battle—this is also a matter of equal generalship, courage, and the sharpness or dullness of arms. But if our forces are disciplined and theirs are chaotic, if we are vigorous and they are sluggish, then even if the enemy is numerous, we may still join battle. As when Wu Qi, with five hundred chariots, broke Qin’s five hundred thousand; or when Xie Xuan, with eight thousand soldiers, defeated Fu Jian’s million—how could one flee then? If not so, then one must evade. Cao Cao said: Withdraw the troops to avoid them.

Du Mu said: "Not being their equal" refers to being inferior in both strength and alliances; one must swiftly depart and not delay. If the enemy guards our critical positions, seizes our crossings, and encircles us, then even the desire to withdraw may no longer be possible. Du You said: When leading troops to prepare defenses, if strength is unequal and circumstances are not favorable, then withdraw the army to avoid them and await an opportune moment to act. Mei Yaochen said: If one’s power is inferior, then withdraw and evade. Wang Xi said: When both general and troops are inferior, encountering the enemy’s attack will surely lead to defeat. Zhang Yu said: If in military strength, strategy, and courage one is all inferior to the enemy, then one must withdraw and evade, awaiting their moment of vulnerability. Thus, a small force that stands firm becomes the great enemy’s captive.

Cao Cao said: The small cannot withstand the great. Li Quan said: A small force that does not assess its strength and stubbornly fights will surely be captured by the greater force. As when the Han Commandant Li Ling, with five thousand infantry, faced a hundred thousand enemy troops and perished in the land of the Xiongnu. Du Mu said: "Standing firm" means the general’s nature is stubborn and unyielding, unable to flee or evade, and thus is captured by the greater force. The Meng clan said: The small cannot withstand the great. It means that a small state, not measuring its strength, dares to make an enemy of a great power; though it may temporarily fortify its cities and hold fast, it will ultimately be captured. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: "Neither strong enough nor weak enough—this is why they were defeated." Mei Yaochen said: If one neither flees nor evades, though one stands firm, one will still be captured. Wang Xi’s annotation agrees with Mei Yaochen.

He Shi said: For example, when the Right General Su Jian and the Front General Zhao Xin led over three thousand troops, marching separately from the Grand General Wei Qing, they alone encountered the Xiongnu chanyu’s army of tens of thousands. They fought fiercely for a day, and the Han soldiers were nearly annihilated. The Front General Xin, a Hu by origin who had surrendered and become a marquis, was enticed by the Xiongnu and led his remaining eight hundred cavalry to defect. The Right General Su Jian lost his entire army and barely escaped alone to return. The Grand General consulted his officials Zheng Hong, Secretary An, and Gentleman-Consultant Zhou Ba on what to do with Su Jian. Zhou Ba said: "Since the Grand General took command, not a single subordinate general has been executed. Now Su Jian has abandoned his army—he should be executed to demonstrate authority and gravity." Zheng Hong and Secretary An said: "Not so. The *Art of War* states: *A small force that stands firm becomes the great enemy’s captive.* Now Su Jian, with only a few thousand, faced the chanyu’s tens of thousands, fought fiercely for a day, and his remaining soldiers did not waver in loyalty. If we execute him upon his return, we signal to later generations that there is no point in returning." Zhang Yu said: A small force that does not assess its strength and stubbornly fights will surely be captured by the greater force. This is seen in Xi Hou’s submission to the Duke of Zheng and Li Ling’s surrender to the Xiongnu. Mencius said: "The small cannot oppose the great, the weak cannot oppose the strong, the few cannot oppose the many."

Now, the general is the state’s assistant. If the assistance is complete, the state will surely be strong. Cao Cao said: When the general is thorough, plans do not leak. Li Quan said: "Assistant" means aid. If the general’s talent is sufficient, the army will surely be strong. Du Mu said: "Complete" refers to talent. Jia Lin said: The state’s strength or weakness necessarily depends on the general. If the general assists the ruler with complete talent, the state will be strong; if he does not assist the ruler and harbors disloyalty within, the state will be weak. The selection and appointment of personnel must be done with utmost care. He Shi said: "Complete" means possessing both talent and wisdom. Only with a general of complete talent and wisdom will the state be secure and strong. If the assistance is flawed, the state will surely be weak. Cao Cao said: Flaws become visible externally. Li Quan said: "Flaw" means deficiency. If the general’s talent is incomplete, the army will surely be weak. Du Mu said: "Incomplete" refers to talent. Mei Yaochen said: With worthy men, one is complete; without them, one is flawed. Wang Xi said: "Complete" means the general is virtuous and possesses both loyalty and talent; "flawed" means there is some deficiency. He Shi said: His talent must be complete, and his handling of affairs must be thoroughly understood.

Thus, when a general is in command of the army, he must first understand the five factors, the six conducts, the use of the five weights, as well as the nine changes and the four opportunities. Only then can he internally govern his troops and externally assess the situation of battle. If he is ignorant of these, he cannot remain in command of the three armies even for a single day. Zhang Yu said: If the general’s plans are thorough and tight, the enemy cannot spy on them, and thus the state is strong; if there is even a slight flaw, the enemy will exploit it and invade, and thus the state is weak. Taigong said: "Those who gain worthy men prosper; those who lose them perish."

There are three ways a ruler may bring harm to his army. Mei Yaochen said: These are harms the ruler may not realize. The Meng clan said: The following words are correct. Zhang Yu said: The three matters below. Not knowing the army should not advance yet ordering it to advance; not knowing the army should not retreat yet ordering it to retreat—this is called "tying up" the army. Cao Cao said: "Tying up" means restraining. Li Quan said: "Tying up" means binding.

Not knowing when to advance or retreat ensures the army’s defeat—like a fettered steed that cannot gallop. The Chu general Long Ju pursued Han Xin and was routed, for he knew not when to advance; the Qin general Fu Rong wheeled his troops back slightly and was defeated, for he knew not when to retreat. Du Mu said: It is like driving with reins and hobble, allowing no freedom. The ruler is the lord of the state. To bring harm to the army is to create peril for the army. When the axe is bestowed and the ominous gate pushed open, matters beyond the threshold are for the general to decide. As when Zhao Chongguo wished to garrison and farm, yet Emperor Xuan of Han insisted on fighting in sequence; or when Sun Hao faced annihilation, yet Jia Chong still requested to withdraw the army—these are what is meant by not knowing when to advance or retreat. Jia Lin said: The army’s advance or retreat should be determined by the general in response to circumstances; when the ruler’s commands govern from within, no greater harm exists. Thus Taigong said: The state cannot be governed from without, nor the army commanded from within. Du You said: *Mi* means to control; *mi* is the reverse of *wei*. The ruler, not knowing the army’s situation, yet wishes to command it from within. Mei Yaochen said: When the ruler does not know the proper times for advance or retreat, yet insists on dictating them, this is to fetter the army—what the *Six Strategies* calls "the army cannot be commanded from within." Wang Xi said: *Mi* means to bind. To remove this harm, one must entrust command to a minister of unshakable loyalty and complete talent. Zhang Yu said: When the army should not advance yet is ordered to advance, or should not retreat yet is ordered to retreat, this is called fettering the army. Thus it is said: If advance and retreat are dictated from within, success is difficult to achieve.

Not knowing the affairs of the three armies yet meddling in their governance confuses the soldiers. Cao Cao said: Military bearing does not enter the state, nor state bearing enter the army—rites cannot govern troops. Li Quan said: Appointing a general unsuited to the task. When the Yan general Murong Ping led his forces, he sold firewood and water wherever he encamped, amassing goods with greed and baseness, yet served as commander of the three armies, knowing nothing of governance. Du Mu said: Military discipline and laws have their own procedures; if one applies the ordinary ways of governing the state, the soldiers will be confused. As when Zhou Yafu saw the Son of Heaven and did not bow, and Emperor Wen of Han knew his courage could not be violated; or when Wei Shang defended Yunzhong, presented enemy heads, and was impeached by the officials—why Feng Tang spoke in outrage. Du You said: Governing the state values propriety and righteousness, while warfare prizes stratagem and deception; their circumstances differ, and their teachings are not the same. If the ruler does not understand this change and applies a single policy to both state and army, the soldiers will be perplexed, not knowing what to do. Thus the *Art of War* says: In the state, trust; in the army, deception. Chen Hao said: Not knowing the affairs of the three armies yet opposing the majority and thwarting counsel. The *Zuozhuan* records that Jin’s Zhi Ji did not follow the army commander’s plan but advanced with a detached force first, and was ultimately defeated by Chu. Mei Yaochen said: Not knowing the duties of military governance yet interfering in its administration confuses the masses. Cao Cao cited the *Methods of the Sima*: "Military bearing does not enter the state, nor state bearing enter the army." He Shi said: The bearing of state and army differ; their governance is distinct. To apply the laws of state governance to the army causes confusion among the ranks. Zhang Yu said: Benevolence and righteousness can govern the state but not the army; adaptability and deception can govern the army but not the state—this is the principle. Duke Guo did not cultivate kindness and love and was destroyed by Jin; the Marquis of Jin did not uphold the four virtues and was defeated by Qin—this is not applying benevolence and righteousness to govern the state. The Marquis of Qi did not shoot gentlemen and was defeated by Jin; the Duke of Song did not capture gray-haired men and was routed by Chu—this is not applying adaptability and deception to govern the army. Thus, when benevolence and righteousness are applied where stratagem and cunning are needed, the state is imperiled—as with Jin and Guo. When rites and propriety are upheld where adaptability and deception are required, the army is defeated—as with Qi and Song. Therefore, the ways of governing the state cannot govern the army.

Not knowing the authority of the three armies yet imposing the same duties upon them sows doubt among the soldiers. Cao Cao said: Failing to match the right person to the task. Du Mu said: If the general lacks authority and wisdom, cannot assess the soldiers’ strengths, and assigns tasks uniformly without utilizing their talents, the three armies will grow doubtful. The *Three Strategies of Huang Shigong* says: One who excels at employing people deploys the wise, the brave, the greedy, and the foolish. The wise delight in establishing merit, the brave in fulfilling their ambitions, the greedy in pursuing profit, and the foolish in disregarding death. Chen Hao said: When the general in the field lacks independent authority and unrestricted command, the soldiers of the three armies naturally doubt. Du You said: Not matching the right person to the task. When the ruler appoints a general, he must choose carefully; if the general does not understand adaptability, he cannot be entrusted with power. To appoint the wrong person leads to missteps and military defeat—as when Zhao did not use Lord Guangwu but instead employed Cheng Anjun. Mei Yaochen said: Not knowing the ways of authority and strategy yet interfering in their duties causes the masses to waver. Wang Xi said: Governance and authority, if entrusted to those who do not understand them, lead to contradictions and constraints, causing the army to doubt. This is why Pei Du memorialized to remove the supervising commissioner when pacifying Caizhou. All these stem from the ruler’s failure to entrust worthy generals with full authority, instead imposing uniformity—hence they are collectively called the three harms. He Shi said: Not knowing how to employ those skilled in military authority and strategy as generals leads to an unruly army and doubtful soldiers. Zhang Yu said: If among the military officers there are those who do not understand the authority and strategy of warfare yet are placed in command, orders will not be unified, and the army will doubt.

Should the battle of Bì prove instructive: the central army’s commander Xún Línfǔ wished to withdraw, yet his deputy general Xiān Gǔ refused to comply, and thus they were defeated by Chǔ. In more recent times, the practice of appointing eunuchs as military supervisors has brought the same harm. When Gāo Chóngwén campaigned against Shǔ, he abolished this practice and thereby achieved success.

When the Three Armies are both confused and doubtful, the troubles from the feudal lords will soon arrive—this is called “disordering one’s own army and inviting victory [for the enemy].” Cáo Cāo said: “Inviting means seizing.” Lǐ Quán said: “Inviting means seizing.”

Warfare is the art of authority and strategy; it cannot be misapplied or entrusted to the unfit. As the Zhao minister Lìn Xiàngrú warned: “Zhào Kuò merely reads his father’s books but does not understand adaptation.” Yet the king now appoints him by reputation alone, like gluing the tuning pegs of a zither. This is to ignore the authority of the Three Armies while imposing uniformity upon their command. The king of Zhao did not heed this advice, and so suffered the defeat at Chángpíng, bringing the troubles of the feudal lords upon himself.

Dù Mù said: “When our army is doubtful and self-disordered, it is as if we invite the enemy to seize victory from us.” Mèng Shì said: “When the Three Armies doubt those they are commanded by and are confused by what they are ordered to do, neighboring states and feudal lords will exploit their discord and bring trouble upon them.” Tài Gōng said: “A doubtful resolve cannot respond to the enemy.” Méi Yáochén said: “The ruler merely knows how to control his generals but does not know how to employ the right men, instead imposing uniformity upon their command and causing the masses to doubt—thus the troubles from the feudal lords arise. This is to disorder one’s own army and forfeit one’s own victory.”

Wáng Xī said: “Inviting the feudal lords to seize victory from oneself.” Hé Shì said: “When soldiers are doubtful and unafraid, disorder ensues, and enemy states can exploit our vulnerabilities to strike.” Zhāng Yù said: “When soldiers are doubtful and unwilling to follow orders, the armies of the feudal lords will seize the opportunity to attack. This is to collapse one’s own army and forfeit one’s own victory.”

Thus, there are five ways to know victory:

Lǐ Quán said: “These refer to the five conditions below.” Zhāng Yù said: “The five conditions below.”

Victory belongs to those who know when they can fight and when they cannot;
Lǐ Quán said: “Assess the alignment of human affairs, then use the *Taiyi* divination and the *Dunjia* method to calculate the three gates, encountering auspicious omens and the five generals without obstruction. Those who press the advantage in the balance of host and guest will surely prevail.” Dù Mù said: “This refers to what is later called ‘knowing the enemy and knowing oneself.’” Mèng Shì said: “Those who can discern the enemy’s situation and examine their strengths and weaknesses will prevail.” Méi Yáochén said: “Knowing the proper timing of what can and cannot be done.” Wáng Xī said: “If it is possible, advance; if not, halt—this is the way to secure victory.” Hé Shì said: “Examine oneself and the enemy.” Zhāng Yù said: “If battle is possible, advance and attack; if not, retreat and defend. Those who can discern the proper timing of attack and defense will never fail to prevail.”

Victory belongs to those who understand the use of the many and the few;
Lǐ Quán said: “Assessing one’s strength.” Dù Mù said: “First know the enemy’s numbers, then raise troops to respond accordingly. As when Wáng Jiǎn campaigned against Jīng, he declared: ‘Without six hundred thousand men, it cannot be done.’” Dù Yòu said: “The nature of warfare is such that there are times when the many cannot strike the few, or the weak can overcome the strong—those who can adapt to these circumstances will prevail. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: ‘Victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers.’” Méi Yáochén said: “Act according to one’s strength.” Wáng Xī said: “This refers to assessing the enemy’s numbers and responding with encirclement, attack, division, or battle.” Zhāng Yù said: “The art of warfare includes victories won by the few over the many and by the many over the few. The key lies in measuring what is needed and not losing the proper balance. As the *Wuzi* states: ‘When using many, seek open ground; when using few, seek narrow passes.’”

Victory belongs to those whose superiors and subordinates share the same desire;
Cáo Cāo said: “Ruler and ministers share the same desire.” Lǐ Quán said: “Observe the hearts of the soldiers—when superiors and subordinates share the same desire, as if avenging a personal grudge, they will prevail.” Chén Hào said: “When superiors and subordinates share the same interests and desires, the Three Armies will have no resentment, and the enemy can be defeated. As the saying goes: ‘If you follow others’ desires, you can make others follow your desires—rarely does this fail.’” Dù Yòu said: “When ruler and ministers are in harmony and fight with courage, they will prevail. Thus, Mencius said: ‘Heavenly timing is not as favorable as earthly advantage; earthly advantage is not as favorable as human harmony.’” Méi Yáochén said: “Hearts aligned as one.” Wáng Xī said: “Superiors and subordinates of one mind. As when Xiān Gǔ’s stubbornness led to defeat, or Lǚ Bù’s disunity brought about his downfall—both resulted from superiors and subordinates not sharing the same desire.” Hé Shì said: “The *Book of Documents* states: ‘Though I have hundreds of thousands of people, their hearts are divided; but I have ten ministers of disorder, and their hearts are as one.’ The Shang perished, and the Zhou rose.” Zhāng Yù said: “When a hundred generals share one heart and the Three Armies unite in strength, with every person eager to fight, they will be unstoppable.”

Victory belongs to those who are prepared for the unprepared;
Lǐ Quán and Dù Mù said: “Having prior preparation.” Mèng Shì said: “*Yú* means to anticipate. The *Zuǒzhuàn* states: ‘Without preparation and foresight, one cannot wage war.’ Wait for the enemy’s moment of vulnerability.” Chén Hào said: “This means first establishing an invincible army and waiting for the enemy’s moment of vulnerability.” Dù Yòu said: “*Yú* means to anticipate. Strike the enemy’s undisciplined forces with one’s own well-ordered army.” Méi Yáochén said: “Be vigilant against the unexpected.” Wáng Xī said: “Use one’s own preparedness to await the enemy’s unpreparedness.” Hé Shì said: “During the Spring and Autumn period, in the battle of Chéngpú, Jin was unprepared for Chu and was defeated at Bì. In the battle of Bì, Chu was unprepared for Jin and was defeated at Yān. From the time of Jùn onward, Jin never failed to prepare and further strengthened this with propriety and harmony—thus Chu could not overpower Jin. Later, when the people of Jīng attacked Chén, Wú came to its aid. After marching thirty *li*, it rained for ten days and nights, and the stars were not visible. The grand historian Yǐ Xiàng said to the general Zǐqī: ‘It has rained for ten days and nights, armor has been gathered, and troops assembled—the men of Wú will surely arrive. It is better to prepare.’”

Then they arrayed their forces, and the men of Wú arrived. Seeing that Jīng was prepared, they turned back. The grand historian said: “They turned back for sixty *li*; their nobles were at the rear, and their commoners were foraging. We have marched thirty *li*—strike them, and we shall surely prevail.” They followed his counsel and thus crushed the army of Wú.

When the great general of Wèi campaigned south against Wú and reached Jī Hú, the Wèi general Mǎn Chǒng led the various armies at the front, facing the enemy across the water. Chǒng commanded the generals: “Tonight the wind is fierce; the enemy will surely come to burn our camp. We must prepare in advance.” All the armies were alerted. At midnight, the enemy indeed dispatched ten units to burn the camp, but Chǒng ambushed and routed them.

Again, in the Spring and Autumn period, the people of Wèi, with the army of Yān, attacked Zhèng. Zhèng’s Jì Zú, Yuán Fán, and Xiè Jià arrayed three armies at their front, while sending Màn Bó and Zǐyuán to conceal an army at their rear. The men of Yān feared Zhèng’s three armies but did not guard against an ambush. In the sixth month, Zhèng’s two noble sons, with their ambush force, defeated Yān’s army at Běi Zhì.

The noble man says: “Without preparation for the unforeseen, one cannot take the field.”

Again, Chǔ’s Zǐ Chóng, advancing from Chén, attacked Jǔ and besieged Qúqiū. The walls of Qúqiū were in disrepair, and its people, overwhelmed, fled to Jǔ. Chǔ entered Qúqiū, and the people of Jǔ imprisoned Chǔ’s Prince Píng. The men of Chǔ said: “Do not kill him; we shall return your captives.” The people of Jǔ killed him. Chǔ’s army besieged Jǔ, whose walls were likewise in disrepair. On the day *gēngshēn*, Jǔ collapsed, and Chǔ then entered Yùn. This was because Jǔ had no preparations.

The noble man says: “To rely on one’s insignificance and fail to prepare is the greatest of faults; to prepare in advance for the unforeseen is the greatest of virtues.” Jǔ, trusting in its insignificance, did not repair its walls and ramparts. Within eleven days, Chǔ captured its three cities—all for want of preparation.

Zhāng Yù says: “Always make oneself invincible to await the enemy.” Thus Wú Qǐ said: “Go forth as if facing the enemy.” Shì Jì said: “With preparation, one does not fail.” A capable general with a ruler who does not interfere will prevail.

Cáo Cāo says: “The *Methods of Sīmǎ* states: ‘Advance and retreat only as the time demands; do not say, “I am but one man.”’”

Lǐ Quán says: “A general in the field, whose ruler’s commands he does not always obey, will prevail—this is a true general.”

When Wú attacked Chǔ, Wú’s Prince Guāng’s younger brother, Fúgài, arrived with the king and requested to strike Chǔ’s Zǐ Cháng, but permission was not granted. Fúgài said: “This is what is meant by seeing what is right and acting without awaiting orders. Today, if I die, Chǔ can be entered.” With his five thousand followers, he struck Zǐ Cháng first and defeated him. From this, we see that a capable general with a ruler who cannot interfere prevails.

When Jìn’s Xuān-dì resisted Zhūgě [Liàng] at Wǔzhàngyuán, the Son of Heaven sent Xīn Pí, bearing the staff of authority, to the army gate, saying: “Whoever dares to ask for battle shall be beheaded.” [Zhūgě] Liàng, hearing this, laughed and said: “If he could restrain me, would I beg for battle from a thousand *li* away?” Pretending that the Son of Heaven had forbidden it, he displayed his martial intent to the troops—this was a general who could not prevail.

Dù Mù says: “The *Book of Wèi Liáo* states: ‘The general is not restrained above by Heaven, below by Earth, or in between by men. Thus, arms are instruments of ill omen; the general is an office of death.’”

Dù Yòu says: “When the general is skilled and well-versed in the dynamics of war, and the ruler can entrust him with sole command, without interference from the court, then—as the *Sayings of the Royal Son* put it—‘The direction comes from the ruler, but the decision to do battle rests with the general.’”

Méi Yáochén says: “Beyond the threshold, the general commands.”

Wáng Xī says: “A ruler who interferes with a capable general cannot entirely eliminate doubt and jealousy. If the sovereign is wise and enlightened, he must surely know men and should entrust them with responsibility for results, pushing the chariot forward and bestowing the battle-axe—this is the proper way. In matters of attack and battle, he should concentrate authority in one man, without interference from the court, so as to unify command and fully employ his talent. How much more so when facing the enemy and seizing the moment, where a hair’s breadth cannot be spared—how can one control from afar?”

Hé Shì says: “In ancient times, when dispatching a general at the Grand Temple, the ruler would personally wield the battle-axe, grasp its head, and present its handle, saying: ‘From this upward to Heaven, the general commands.’ Then he would again grasp the handle and present the blade, saying: ‘From this downward to the abyss, the general commands.’ Thus, when Lǐ Mù served as general of Zhào, stationed at the frontier, the taxes from the military markets were all used by him to feast his troops. Rewards and punishments were decided in the field, without interference from the court. When Zhōu Yǎfū’s army was at Xìliǔ, only the general’s commands were heard in the camp, not the Son of Heaven’s edicts. For the art of war is such that with every step, a hundred changes may occur—advance when opportunity arises, retreat when difficulties are known. To say, ‘There is the king’s command here,’ is like sending a child to fight a fire: before the order can be returned, the embers have long since turned to ash. To say, ‘There is a supervising officer here,’ is like building a house by the roadside: plans cannot be settled, and nothing can be accomplished. Thus, to interfere with a capable general and demand the suppression of cunning foes is like hobbling a Hànlú hound and expecting it to catch a swift hare—how is this different?”

Zhāng Yù says: “When a general possesses wisdom and courage, he should be entrusted with responsibility for success and not interfered with from the court. Thus it is said: ‘Matters beyond the threshold are decided by the general.’ These five principles are the Dao of knowing victory.”

Cáo Cāo says: “These are the five matters mentioned above.” Thus it is said: “Know the enemy and know yourself, and in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.”

Lǐ Quán says: “Measure your strength to resist the enemy—what peril is there?”

Dù Mù says: “Assess the enemy’s governance by your own; assess the enemy’s generals by your own; assess the enemy’s troops by your own; assess the enemy’s provisions by your own; assess the enemy’s terrain by your own. Once the comparison is complete, and the strengths and weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages are all foreseen, then raise your troops—thus you will win a hundred battles out of a hundred.”

Mèng Shì says: “Carefully discern the enemy’s and your own strengths and weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages—though you fight a hundred battles, you will truly never be in peril.”

Méi Yáochén says: “Know these five matters of the enemy and yourself completely, and you will not fail.”

Wáng Xī says: “Dài means peril. If you thoroughly compare the circumstances of both yourself and the enemy, and only engage in battle when victory is assured, then you will never be in peril, even in a hundred battles.”

Zhāng Yù says: “‘Knowing the enemy and knowing yourself’ refers to attack and defense. Knowing the enemy allows you to attack; knowing yourself allows you to defend. Attack is the mechanism of defense, and defense is the strategy of attack. If you truly understand these, you will never be in peril, even in a hundred battles.” Some say: “Shì Huì discerned that the Chu army could not be opposed, and Chén Píng assessed the strengths and weaknesses of Liú Bāng and Xiàng Yǔ—these are examples of knowing the enemy and knowing oneself. If you do not know the enemy but know yourself, you will win one and lose one.”

Lǐ Quán says: “If you consider yourself strong but do not assess the enemy, victory or defeat remains uncertain.” When Fú Jiān, ruler of Qín, led a million troops south to invade, someone warned him: “They have men of talent—Xiè Ān and Huán Chōng—outstanding figures south of the Yangtze. You must not take them lightly.” Fú Jián replied: “With the forces of eight provinces and a million soldiers and horses, I could dam the river with my whips thrown into it. What difficulty could there be?” Later, he was indeed defeated—this illustrates the principle.

Dù Mù says: “Relying on one’s own strength while failing to recognize that the enemy cannot be attacked results in alternating victory and defeat.” When Wáng Mèng was on his deathbed, he admonished Fú Jiān: “Though the Jìn dynasty resides south of the Yangtze, it holds the Mandate of Heaven. Xiè Ān and Huán Chōng are outstanding figures there—you must not attack them.” Yet when Fú Jiān launched his southern campaign, he declared: “With a million soldiers and horses, I could cross the river with my whips.” He then suffered defeat at Féishuǐ—this is the meaning.

Chén Hào says: “Dù Mù’s explanation refers to an army relying on brute strength without just cause, attacking an innocent state—this is why it failed. It does not mean alternating victory and defeat.”

Dù Yòu says: “Though one may not understand the enemy’s situation, if one relies on one’s own ability to overcome it, victory and defeat will be evenly matched.”

Méi Yáochén says: “If one only knows oneself, victory and defeat will be evenly split.”

Wáng Xī says: “If one only calculates one’s own strengths but does not know the enemy’s, victory or defeat will be uncertain.”

Zhāng Yù says: “Emperor Tàizōng of Táng said: ‘Though today’s generals and ministers may not fully know the enemy, if they merely know themselves, how could they not prevail?’ What is meant by ‘knowing oneself’ is maintaining one’s qi and awaiting the right moment. Thus, if one knows defense but not attack, victory and defeat will be evenly matched. If one knows neither the enemy nor oneself, one will be in peril in every battle.”

Lǐ Quán says: “This is called reckless banditry—what awaits but defeat?”

Dù Yòu says: “Failing to assess the enemy externally and not knowing oneself internally, one will surely be in peril if one engages in battle.”

Méi Yáochén says: “If one knows nothing, how can one win?”

Wáng Xī says: “This is complete blindness in strategy.”

Zhāng Yù says: “If one knows neither the methods of attack nor defense, defeat is certain in battle.”

*Sunzi Commentary, Scroll Four: The Shape Chapter.*

Cáo Cāo says: “This concerns the shape of an army. When I move and the enemy responds, both sides observe each other—this is the nature of circumstance.”

Lǐ Quán says: “‘Shape’ refers to the configurations of host and guest, attack and defense, the eight formations, the five encampments, yin and yang, and the orientations of front and rear.”

Dù Mù says: “Circumstance is revealed through shape. What is formless conceals circumstance; what is formed exposes it. Concealment brings victory, exposure brings defeat.”

Wáng Zhé says: “‘Shape’ means fixed form—the definite strengths and weaknesses of two opposing forces. One skilled in warfare alters their shape to adapt to the enemy and secure victory.”

Zhāng Yù says: “This speaks of the shapes of attack and defense in two armies. When concealed within, others cannot discern it; when revealed externally, the enemy seizes the opportunity to strike. Shape becomes manifest through attack and defense, hence it follows *Strategic Offensive*.”

Sūnzǐ says: “Of old, those skilled in warfare first ensured they could not be defeated.”

Zhāng Yù says: “This is what is meant by knowing oneself.”

“They awaited the enemy’s moment of vulnerability.”

Méi Yáochén says: “Concealing their shape and cultivating internal order, they watched for the enemy’s laxity.”

Zhāng Yù says: “This is what is meant by knowing the enemy.”

“Inability to be defeated lies with oneself; the opportunity to defeat lies with the enemy.”

Cáo Cāo says: “One cultivates their own order to await the enemy’s laxity.”

Lǐ Quán says: “Those skilled in warfare, when defending, fortify their ramparts, stockpile provisions, and refine their training. When attacking a city, they employ siege towers, scaling ladders, earthen mounds, and tunnels. In formation, they position themselves among rivers and hills, turn their backs to isolation and face emptiness, strike where doubt arises, and exploit gaps. The adept in battle aligns their forces in interlocking angles, ensuring head and tail respond as one—this is how they become invincible. Yet while they can make themselves invincible, they cannot force the enemy to be vulnerable. Thus it is said: victory can be known but not forced. Invincibility lies in defense; vulnerability lies in attack. These principles determine victory.”

Dù Mù says: “One orders their forces and maintains constant readiness against the enemy, concealing their traces and shape so the enemy cannot gauge their intentions. Then, when the enemy presents an exploitable opening, one emerges to attack.”

Dù Yòu says: “First, one consults in the ancestral temple, weighing dangers and difficulties. Then, one raises high ramparts and deep moats, drills the troops, and thus prepares for defense. By awaiting the enemy’s flaws, victory becomes possible. The means to control the enemy lies externally, so one cultivates their own order to await the enemy’s laxity. Only when the enemy’s vulnerabilities become apparent can victory be secured.”

Wáng Shì says: “Invincibility lies in cultivating the Dao and preserving the law; vulnerability lies in the enemy’s gaps.”

Zhāng Yù says: “The cause of defense lies with oneself; the cause of attack lies with the enemy. Thus, the skilled in warfare can make themselves invincible.”

Dù Mù says: “Invincibility refers to what was explained above—ordering one’s forces and concealing one’s shape. This lies within one’s power, hence it is said one *can* achieve it.”

Zhāng Yù says: “By concealing one’s shape and obscuring one’s traces, maintaining constant vigilance, one ensures their own capability.”

“But they cannot make the enemy vulnerable.”

Dù Mù says: “If the enemy reveals no shape to discern, no laxity to exploit, then even if one possesses the means to victory, how can they prevail?”

Jiǎ Lín says: “If the enemy is wise and deeply prepared, one cannot forcibly compel them to be unprepared.”

Dù Yòu says: “It lies with oneself to drill the troops and align with the Dao; if the enemy is deeply prepared, one cannot forcibly defeat them.”

Méi Yáochén says: “It lies with oneself, hence one can achieve it; it lies with the enemy, hence one cannot force it.”

Wáng Shì says: “It lies with the enemy, not with oneself.”

Zhāng Yù says: “If the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses are not externally apparent, how can one determine victory over them? Thus it is said: victory can be known, but not forced.”

Cáo Cāo says: “One sees the formed shape.”

Dù Mù says: “‘Knowing’ means recognizing one’s own strength as sufficient to defeat the enemy.”

Chén Háo says: “Victory is discerned through shape, hence it can be known.”

“But it cannot be forced.”

Cáo Cāo says: “Because the enemy is prepared.”

Dù Mù says: “This means one cannot make the enemy lax, providing the means for one’s own victory.”

Jiǎ Lín says: “If the enemy is concealed and formless, one cannot forcibly determine victory or defeat.”

Dù Yòu says: “If the enemy is prepared, having assessed their shape, victory or defeat may be known. But if the enemy is concealed and formless, one cannot forcibly compel their defeat. As Fàn Lǐ said: ‘When the time is not ripe, one cannot forcibly bring it about; when matters are not exhausted, one cannot forcibly complete them.’”

Méi Yáochén says: “If the enemy has flaws, victory can be known; if the enemy has no flaws, it cannot be forced.”

Hé Shì says: “Victory that can be known lies with oneself—one is prepared. Victory that cannot be forced lies with the enemy—they are formless.”

Zhāng Yù says: “If one is prepared, victory can be known; if the enemy is prepared, it cannot be forced.”

“Invincibility lies in defense.”

Cáo Cāo says: “Concealing one’s shape.”

Dù Mù says: “When one does not yet see the enemy’s exploitable shape, one conceals their own form, preparing to be invincible, and thus defends.”

Dù Yòu says: “Concealing one’s shape. If the enemy’s shape is unseen, and their numbers are greater while one’s own are fewer, one defends.”

Méi Yáochén says: “One waits in readiness.”

Hé Shì says: “If the enemy’s disposition of strength and weakness remains unclear, with no evident opportunity for victory, one should firmly defend.”

Zhāng Yù says: “Knowing one cannot yet prevail, one guards their qi and awaits the moment.”

“Vulnerability lies in attack.”

Cáo Cāo says: “When the enemy attacks, one can then prevail.”

Lǐ Quán says: “Those skilled in warfare, when defending, raise high ramparts and fortify their walls. When attacking, they employ siege towers, scaling ladders, earthen mounds, and tunnels. In formation, they position themselves with rivers and marshes to the left, hills to the right, turn their backs to isolation and face emptiness, strike where doubt arises, and exploit gaps. They discern the five commands to regulate their forces, align their momentum, and ensure head and tail respond as one—this is how they become invincible.”

Without these conditions, one may deem it possible to prevail.

Dù Mù says: “When the enemy presents an opportunity for victory, one should then sally forth and attack.”

Dù Yòu says: “Only when the enemy attacks may one prevail. Once their disposition is revealed—when they are few and we are many—then one may attack.”

Méi Yáochén says: “One strikes at their gaps.”

Wáng Zhé says: “Defense arises from insufficiency in securing victory; attack arises from surplus in securing victory.”

Zhāng Yù says: “Knowing the enemy harbors a principle of vulnerability, one attacks their resolve and seizes them. Defense stems from insufficiency; attack, from surplus.”

Cáo Cāo notes: “What compels us to defend is insufficiency of strength; what compels us to attack is surplus of strength.”

Lǐ Quán says: “Insufficiency of strength permits defense; surplus of strength permits attack.”

Méi Yáochén says: “Defense acknowledges insufficiency of strength; attack acknowledges surplus of strength.”

Zhāng Yù says: “What compels us to defend is the Dao of securing victory being as yet incomplete, so we bide our time. What compels us to attack is the matter of overcoming the enemy already possessing surplus, so we strike. This means one does not engage without certainty of victory, nor breach without absolute assurance. Later scholars who equate insufficiency with weakness and surplus with strength miss the mark. Those skilled in defense conceal themselves beneath the Nine Earths; those skilled in attack move from the Nine Heavens above—thus they preserve themselves and achieve total victory.”

Cáo Cāo says: “Relying on the solidity of mountains, rivers, and hills, one hides beneath the Nine Earths; adapting to the changes of heaven’s seasons, one moves from the Nine Heavens above.”

Lǐ Quán says: *“The Classic of the Celestial Unity and Hidden Stem* states: ‘From the Nine Heavens above, one may array troops; beneath the Nine Earths, one may conceal and hide.’ Typically, one adds the Straight Talisman to the hour’s stem, with the first position it governs as the Nine Heavens, and the second as the Nine Earths. Earth is still and favors concealment; Heaven moves and favors action. Thus, the Martial Lord of Wèi misunderstood the two *dùn* systems, taking the Nine Earths as mountains and rivers, and the Nine Heavens as heaven’s seasons. Yet by mastering the subtle mysteries of the Celestial Unity and Great Unity *dùn*, one attains completeness. The classic says: ‘Know the Three, avoid the Five, stand alone and towering—master the Three and Five, and traverse the world unopposed.’ Applying this method without constraint yields its true meaning.”

Dù Mù says: “Defense veils its voice and erases its traces, as deep and unfathomable as ghosts and spirits, concealed beneath the earth, unseen. Attack is swift and thunderous, swift as lightning, descending like a force from heaven, leaving no time for preparation. The number nine signifies the utmost in height and depth.”

Chén Háo says: “In the three months of spring, *yín* and *gōngcáo* govern the Nine Heavens above, while *shēn* and *chuánsòng* govern the Nine Earths below. In the three months of summer, *wǔ* and *shèngxiān* govern the Nine Heavens above, while *zǐ* and *shénhòu* govern the Nine Earths below. In the three months of autumn, *shēn* and *chuánsòng* govern the Nine Heavens above, while *yín* and *gōngcáo* govern the Nine Earths below. In the three months of winter, *zǐ* and *shénhòu* govern the Nine Heavens above, while *wǔ* and *shèngxiān* govern the Nine Earths below.”

Dù Yòu says: “Those skilled in defense rely on the barriers of mountains and rivers, the solidity of hills, making their position unassailable—so deep and hidden they lie beneath the Nine Earths. Those skilled in attack exploit the changes of heaven’s seasons, terrain, water, and fire, leaving the enemy unaware of where to prepare—so swift and thunderous they strike from the Nine Heavens above.”

Méi Yáochén says: “The Nine Earths signify depths beyond knowing; the Nine Heavens, heights beyond measuring. Thus, defense is secretive, and attack is swift.”

Wáng Zhé says: “Defense, when no advantageous opportunity for attack is evident, should conceal its form, remain still and silent, preventing the enemy from discerning its intentions. Attack, when an advantageous opportunity is evident, should be lofty, swift, and sudden, striking before the enemy can react. The number nine merely expresses the extreme.”

Hé Shì says: “The Nine Earths and Nine Heavens denote profound subtlety.”

*Wèiliáozi* states: “Those who command troops act as if hidden in the earth, as if concealed in the heavens—so secret and remote is their depth.”

During the Later Hàn, the rebel Wáng Guó besieged Chéncāng. The Left General, Huángfǔ Sōng, and the vanguard commander Dǒng Zhuó were sent to relieve the city. Zhuó urged a swift advance, but Sōng refused. Zhuó argued: “The wise do not lag behind the moment; the brave do not linger. A rapid relief saves the city; delay dooms it. The fate of survival or destruction rests here.” Qín replied: “Not so. To win a hundred battles is not as good as subduing the enemy without fighting. Thus, one first ensures invincibility, awaiting the enemy’s vulnerability. Invincibility lies with us; vulnerability lies with them. Their defense is insufficient; our attack is in surplus. Surplus moves from the Nine Heavens above; insufficiency sinks into the Nine Earths below. Though Chéncāng is small, its defenses are solid—it is not a pitfall of the Nine Earths. Though Wáng Guó is strong, he attacks where we do not relieve—his momentum is not that of the Nine Heavens. Without the momentum of the Nine Heavens, the attacker suffers harm; without the pitfall of the Nine Earths, the defender does not falter. Now Wáng Guó has fallen into a position of harm, while Chéncāng holds a small but unassailable stronghold. We may achieve total victory without exhausting our troops—why rush to its relief?” He refused to comply. Wáng Guó besieged Chéncāng from winter to spring, over eighty days, yet the city held firm and could not be breached. The rebels, weary and depleted, eventually withdrew.

Zhāng Yù says: “Concealed beneath the Nine Earths, one is as hidden and unknowable as the depths; moving from the Nine Heavens above, one strikes as swiftly and unpredictably as lightning. *Wèiliáozi* says: ‘As if hidden in the earth, as if concealed in the heavens’—this is the meaning. Defense is solid, ensuring self-preservation.”

Thus, to attack is to seize total victory. To perceive victory only as far as the common crowd perceives it is not the highest excellence. Cáo Cāo says: “One must see what has not yet sprouted.” Lǐ Quán says: “To know no more than the crowd knows is not excellence.” When Hán Xìn crushed Zhào, he marched through the Jǐngxíng Pass before dawn and declared, “We shall break Zhào and feast.” His generals murmured in confusion, feigning assent, saying, “Very well.” Then he arrayed his troops with their backs to the river. Zhào’s forces, observing from their ramparts, burst into laughter, calling the Hán generals inept. Yet Hán Xìn crushed Zhào, feasted, and beheaded Chéng’ānjūn—this was beyond what the crowd could foresee. Dù Mù says: “What the crowd sees is the breaking of armies and the slaying of generals, and only then do they recognize victory. What I see is the deliberation in the ancestral temple, the question posed over the sacrificial vessels—already I know victory or defeat.” Jiǎ Lín says: “To defend is to be solid and unshakable; to attack is to be certain and triumphant. To preserve oneself wholly and never falter; to perceive victory before it manifests, to foresee defeat before it arises—this is subtle, profound, and transcendent, beyond the sight of the common crowd.” Mèng Shì says: “To perceive what has not yet sprouted means that when two armies have already clashed, though one may foresee victory or defeat, one’s strategy cannot surpass others’—one sees only the near, not the distant.” Tài Gōng says: “One whose wisdom is the same as the crowd’s is no master of state.” Méi Yáochén says: “To see only what others see is not excellence.” Wáng Zhé says: “The common crowd sees how victory is won but does not know the configuration that secures it.” Zhāng Yù says: “What the crowd knows is what has already taken shape and become manifest; what I see is what has not yet formed, what has not yet sprouted.”

To win a battle and have all under heaven call it excellent is not the highest excellence. Cáo Cāo says: “Contending at the point of the blade.” Lǐ Quán says: “To contend by force of arms, though all under heaven may see it, is not excellence.” Dù Mù says: “‘All under heaven’ here is as the crowd mentioned above. When all under heaven praise a victorious battle, they mean the breaking of armies and the slaying of generals. My excellence lies in covert planning and subtle maneuvering, in attacking through strategy and subduing through counsel, so that the day of victory comes without bloodshed.” Chén Hào says: “To subtly deploy one’s wisdom and focus on breaking the enemy’s strategy, to subdue the enemy’s forces without battle—this is the highest excellence.” Méi Yáochén says: “To see no further than the crowd, though one may win the battle and all under heaven praise it, is still not called excellence.” Wáng Shì says: “To subdue others through strategy is true excellence.” Zhāng Yù says: “To win only after battle, so that all under heaven call it excellent, is to have a reputation for wisdom and deeds of valor—thus it is not the highest excellence. But to discern the subtle and perceive the hidden, to seize victory from the formless—this is true excellence.”

Thus, to lift a autumn hair is not considered great strength; to see the sun and moon is not considered keen vision; to hear thunder is not considered sharp hearing. Cáo Cāo says: “These are easily seen and heard.” Lǐ Quán says: “These are easily seen and heard.” To regard victory in attack and battle as excellence is not what all under heaven calls excellent. The general of profound wisdom is unfathomable to others, for he devises deep strategies. Thus Sūn Wǔ says: “Hard to know as the dark of night.” Wáng Zhé says: “What the crowd knows is not wisdom; to win by force of arms is not excellence.” Hé Shì says: “This speaks of what the crowd sees and hears as nothing extraordinary. Of old, Wū Huò lifted a tripod of a thousand jūn by strength; Lí Zhū observed the finest fibers at a hundred paces by keen sight; Shī Kuàng heard the tread of a mosquito or mantis by sharp hearing. But when the form of battle is already manifest, who cannot see it? Thus, to triumph before form arises is to truly know warfare.” Zhāng Yù says: “All can do these things—this is used to illustrate how the crowd perceives victory. An autumn hair refers to the fur of a hare, which becomes stiff and fine in autumn, meaning something exceedingly light.”

The ancients called those who excelled in warfare victors over the easily vanquished. Cáo Cāo says: “One probes the subtle and easily vanquished, attacks what can be overcome, and does not attack what cannot be overcome.” Dù Mù says: “When the enemy’s plans first show signs of sprouting, I subtly maneuver to attack them. With little effort and minimal exertion, victory is assured—thus it is called easily vanquished.” Méi Yáochén says: “To lift an autumn hair by strength, to see the sun and moon by keen vision, to hear thunder by sharp hearing—these do not surpass what the crowd can do. Thus, to see what is manifest is to win with difficulty; to see what is subtle is to win with ease.” Hé Shì says: “When the enemy’s plans first show signs of sprouting, I subtly maneuver to attack them. With little effort and minimal exertion, victory is assured—thus it is called easily vanquished.” Zhāng Yù says: “To engage in close combat and only then overcome the enemy is to win with difficulty. To perceive the subtle and discern the hidden, to break the enemy before form arises, is to win with ease. Thus, the excellent warrior always attacks what is easily vanquished and does not attack what is difficult to overcome.”

Therefore, the victory of one who excels in warfare bears no reputation for wisdom, no deeds of valor. Cáo Cāo says: “When the enemy’s forces have not yet taken shape, to defeat them brings no resounding glory.” Lǐ Quán says: “To defeat the enemy without all under heaven knowing—what reputation for wisdom is there?” Dù Mù says: “To triumph before anything has sprouted, so that all under heaven does not know—thus there is no reputation for wisdom. Without bloodshed, the enemy state submits—thus there are no deeds of valor.” Méi Yáochén says: “Great wisdom is not displayed; great deeds are not proclaimed. To see the subtle and win with ease—what valor, what wisdom is there?” Hé Shì says: “When disaster is dissolved before it takes shape, who will call it wisdom? To subdue without battle, who will speak of valor? The Hán’s Zǐ Fáng and the Táng’s Péi Dù were capable of this.” Zhāng Yù says: “Through covert planning and subtle maneuvering, to seize victory from the formless, so that all under heaven does not hear of one’s wisdom in assessing the enemy and securing victory, does not see one’s deeds in capturing banners and beheading generals—this is like the Marquis of Liú, who never had battlefield exploits.”

Thus, their victories in battle are not martial. Lǐ Quán says: “To win a hundred battles out of a hundred—what doubt is there?”

This Li Quán takes "martial" to mean "doubt." Chén Háo says: "Plans are not made in vain; strategies are not launched idly." Zhāng Yù says: "To seek victory through brute force, even the skilled may sometimes fail. But if one perceives what has not yet taken shape and discerns what has not yet formed, then one may win a hundred battles out of a hundred without a single lapse in martial prowess. 'Not martial' means one’s measures ensure victory over an already defeated foe."

Cáo Cāo says: "To discern where the enemy may be defeated is to avoid lapses in martial prowess." Lǐ Quán says: "To secure victory over an already defeated army—where is the martial valor in that? Troops exhausted and soldiers demoralized, commands inconsistent—this is what it means to be already defeated." Dù Mù says: "措 means to arrange or place. 武 refers to lapses in martial prowess. Why can I arrange victory without such lapses? Because I first perceive the enemy’s already defeated state, then attack, and thus achieve complete victory without any lapse in martial prowess."

Jiǎ Lín says: "Read 措 as 错, meaning 'to intermingle' or 'assess.' To seize victory from the enemy follows no other principle, hence one must intermingle and calculate. One constantly perceives the enemy’s defeat before victory has taken shape." Méi Yáochén says: "To see where they may be defeated is to ensure victory without lapse." Hé Shì says: "This is skillful calculation." Zhāng Yù says: "The reason one can win without lapse is that one first discerns the enemy’s vulnerabilities, then deploys troops accordingly."

Thus, the skilled warrior stands on ground of invincibility and does not miss the enemy’s defeat. Lǐ Quán says: "Armies that secure terrain thrive; those that lose it perish. Terrain refers to strategic positions. When the Qín army defeated Zhào, the first to seize the northern mountain prevailed. When the Sòng forces attacked Yān, victory came after crossing the Great Xiàn Pass—both secured advantageous ground." Dù Mù says: "Ground of invincibility means devising plans to ensure the enemy cannot defeat me. Not missing the enemy’s defeat means observing their vulnerabilities with perfect precision." Chén Háo’s annotation aligns with Lǐ Quán’s; Dù Yòu’s aligns with Dù Mù’s.

Méi Yáochén says: "To skillfully await the enemy’s gaps is to ensure constant victory." Wáng Zhé says: "Constantly render oneself invincible, await the enemy’s vulnerability, and never miss the opportunity." Hé Shì says: "Relying on preparedness ensures no negligence; constantly watching for the enemy’s gaps ensures victory without fail. Standing on ground of invincibility is advantageous—it means I am always positioned for victory." Zhāng Yù says: "By refining our commands, clarifying rewards and punishments, preparing our equipment, and cultivating martial valor, we stand on ground of invincibility. With disciplined forces, the enemy will naturally rush into defeat."

Therefore, victorious armies first secure victory, then seek battle; defeated armies first fight, then seek victory. Cáo Cāo says: "This refers to having strategy versus acting without forethought." Lǐ Quán says: "This refers to planning versus not planning. Thus, Lord Xuē knew Xiàng Yǔ was doomed to defeat, and Tián Fēng foresaw Cáo Cāo’s victory—this is the principle at work."

Dù Mù says: "Guǎnzǐ states: 'Heaven’s timing, terrain’s advantage, their quantities and key points all emerge from calculation.' Thus, the way of attack and conquest is first settled through planning within, then troops are dispatched beyond the borders. Without understanding the enemy’s governance, one cannot strike; without knowing their resources, one cannot constrain them; without knowing their generals, one cannot lead the vanguard; without knowing their troops, one cannot array the battle lines. Therefore, to strike the few with the many, order with chaos, wealth with poverty, ability with inability, trained soldiers with raw recruits—this is how one wins a hundred battles out of a hundred. This is the meaning of first securing victory, then seeking battle."

Duke Wèi’s Lǐ Jìng says: "A general’s highest duty lies in keen discernment and harmonious troops, deep strategy and far-reaching foresight, understanding heaven’s timing and human principles. If one does not assess capabilities, fails to grasp adaptability, and only at the critical moment hesitates, glancing left and right, bereft of plans, swayed by conflicting advice, wavering in advance or retreat, with units in disarray—how is this different from driving the people into boiling water and fire, or herding cattle and sheep to feed wolves and tigers? This is the meaning of first fighting, then seeking victory."

Jiǎ Lín says: "Without knowing the enemy’s and one’s own conditions, rashly deploying troops in the hope of victory will only lead to defeat." Méi Yáochén says: "If one fights when victory is assured, victory follows; if one fights when victory is not yet apparent, can victory be attained?" Hé Shì says: "In warfare, one must first devise a plan for certain victory before deploying troops. Without prior strategy, relying on brute strength does not guarantee victory."

Zhāng Yù says: "By first securing victory through planning, then raising troops, one prevails in battle. As the *Wèi Liáozi* states: 'Without certainty of victory, one does not speak of battle; without certainty of success, one does not speak of attack.' This means perilous affairs must not be undertaken lightly. It also states: 'Victory here ensures victory there; failure here ensures failure there.' This is the principle. Like Zhào Chōngguó, who always planned before fighting, one avoids reckless advance in the hope of luck, which leads to defeat in battle."

The skilled in warfare cultivate the Dao and uphold the law, thus they govern victory and defeat. Cáo Cāo says: "The skilled in warfare first cultivate invincibility and uphold the law, ensuring they do not miss the enemy’s disorder." Lǐ Quán says: "To punish the rebellious with righteousness, not to attack blameless states, to arrive without plunder, not to fell trees or poison wells, to purify and sweep the mountains, rivers, city altars, and ancestral shrines one passes, and to avoid repeating the deeds of fallen states—this is called the Dao and the law."

The army is stern and disciplined, accepting death without transgression; rewards and punishments are trustworthy and righteous. A general who embodies this can overcome the enemy’s disordered governance.

Dù Mù says: "Dao is benevolence and righteousness; law is the system of regulations. The skilled in warfare first cultivate benevolence and righteousness, uphold the legal system, and establish invincible governance. They await the enemy’s vulnerabilities, then attack and secure victory."

Jiǎ Lín says: "One must constantly refine the Dao of victory in warfare and uphold the laws of rewards and punishments. Thus, one determines victory or defeat—this is called the governance of victory and defeat."

Méi Yáochén says: "Attack and defense depend on self-cultivation; laws and orders rely on self-preservation. It rests with oneself."

Wáng Zhě says: "Law refers to the five matters below."

Zhāng Yù says: "Cultivate the Dao of warfare and uphold the laws of controlling the enemy, thus ensuring certain victory."

Some say: "First refine Dao and virtue to harmonize the troops; then uphold laws and orders to restrain subordinates. Make the people both love and fear you, and only then can you govern victory and defeat."

The military method consists of five matters:
First, *du* (measurement).
Jiǎ Lín says: "*Du* refers to land."
Wáng Zhě says: "It means length and distance."

Second, *liàng* (assessment).
Jiǎ Lín says: "*Liàng* refers to the number of people, the fullness or emptiness of granaries."
Wáng Zhě says: "It means capacity and volume."

Third, *shù* (calculation).
Jiǎ Lín says: "*Shù* is calculation. By calculation, one knows the multitude or fewness, the emptiness or fullness."
Wáng Zhě says: "It means hundreds and thousands."

Fourth, *chēng* (weighing).
Jiǎ Lín says: "Having known the multitude or fewness, one further knows the weight of virtue and achievement, the length and shortness of talent between oneself and the enemy."
Wáng Zhě says: "It means balance and scale."

Fifth, *shèng* (victory).
Cáo Cāo says: "The governance of victory and defeat, the method of warfare—one must weigh these five matters to know the enemy’s situation."
Zhāng Yù says: "This speaks of the method of encampment and formation."
Lǐ Wèigōng says: "Training soldiers is like placing pieces on a board; without marked paths, how can the pieces be used? The land gives rise to *du*."

Cáo Cāo says: "*Du* means measuring based on terrain."
Lǐ Quán says: "Having measured the situation, one assesses the enemy to control them."
Dù Mù says: "*Du* means calculation. It refers to calculating the size of one’s territory, the number of households, tax revenue, registered chariots, the peril or ease of mountains and rivers, the circuitousness or directness of roads. One measures these against the enemy before raising troops. The small cannot scheme against the large, the weak cannot strike the strong, the near cannot raid the distant, the plain cannot assault the perilous—all arise from the land, thus measurement comes first."
Méi Yáochén says: "Measure military strength based on the land."
Wáng Zhě says: "Land is what people tread upon. Raising troops and waging war begins with the land, from which *du* arises. *Du* measures length to know distance."
Hé Shì says: "Land refers to distance, peril, and ease. *Du* means calculation. Before sending out troops, first calculate the enemy’s peril or ease, the circuitousness or directness of roads, the number of arms, and whether their courage or cowardice prevails. Only after calculating the feasibility of attack should one mobilize troops, ensuring success."
*Du* gives rise to *liàng*.

Dù Mù says: "*Liàng* means deliberation. Having measured the land thoroughly, one then deliberates on the strength and weakness of oneself and the enemy."
Méi Yáochén says: "Assess the enemy’s situation based on measurement."
Wáng Zhě says: "It means assessing size. Having known the calculation of distance, one must further assess the land’s size."
Hé Shì says: "Deliberate on the forms and circumstances of oneself and the enemy."
*Liàng* gives rise to *shù*.

Cáo Cāo says: "Knowing distance and breadth, one knows the number of people."
Lǐ Quán says: "Assessing the enemy’s distance, strength, and weakness requires preparing the number of soldiers and military resources to secure victory."
Dù Mù says: "*Shù* means strategic calculation. Having determined strength and weakness, one can then employ strategic changes."
Jiǎ Lín says: "Measuring the land’s distance and breadth reveals the enemy’s number of people."
Méi Yáochén says: "From assessment comes the number of the multitude or few."
Wáng Zhě says: "*Shù* records multitude or fewness. Having known the enemy’s size, one further calculates their number, whether refined or inferior."
Cáo Gōng says: "Know their number of people."
Hé Shì says: "*Shù* means strategic change. First deliberate on the advantages and disadvantages of strength and weakness between oneself and the enemy, then devise strategies."
Zhāng Yù says: "The land has forms of distance and breadth; one must first measure and know them, then assess the number of people it can hold."
*Shù* gives rise to *chēng*.

Cáo Cāo says: "*Chēng* means weighing which side is superior."
Lǐ Quán says: "Having determined the number of worthy and wise, those who gain worthies are heavy; those who lose them are light. Like Hán Xìn’s analysis of Chǔ and Hàn, one must know the weight, distinguish the worthy and foolish, and arrange them appropriately to become strong."
Dù Mù says: "*Chēng* means comparison. Having employed strategic calculations, one can then compare the victory or defeat of oneself and the enemy."
Méi Yáochén says: "Weigh light and heavy based on numbers."
Wáng Zhě says: "*Chēng* knows weight and lightness, illustrating the forms of strength and weakness. Fully knowing the calculation of distance, the undertaking of size, and the number of multitude or fewness, and comparing them with the enemy, one knows where the weight lies."
Hé Shì’s note is the same as Dù Mù’s.
*Chēng* gives rise to *shèng*.

Cáo Cāo says: "From the calculation of weighing, one knows where victory or defeat lies."
Lǐ Quán says: "Weighing light and heavy reveals the calculation of victory and defeat."
Dù Mù says: "Having compared thoroughly, the victory of oneself and the defeat of the enemy become clearly visible."
Méi Yáochén says: "From light and heavy comes the knowledge of victory and defeat."
Wáng Zhě says: "The heavy overcomes the light."
Chén Háo, Dù Yòu, and Lǐ Quán’s notes on the five matters are the same as Dù Mù’s.

Hé Shì says: "The five matters above are the methods for calculating victory before battle begins. Thus, Master Sun cites ancient principles to elucidate the essentials of victory and defeat."

Zhāng Yù says: "*Chēng* means 'proportion.' When terrain and troop numbers are in proper proportion, density and spacing are fitting, and thus victory is possible." *Wèi Liáozi* states: "No error lies in measurement and calculation. *Dù* refers to units of length, *shù* to formations of ten and five. Measure land with *dù*, troops with *shù*; when land and troops are in proportion, victory follows. All five matters arise from terrain, and thus victory is born of it." This is exemplified by Lǐ Jìng’s five formations, which adapt to terrain.

"Thus, victorious troops are like weighing a *yì* against a *zhū*."

Méi Yáochén says: "Strength makes lifting easy."

"Defeated troops are like weighing a *zhū* against a *yì*."

Cáo Cāo says: "The light cannot lift the heavy."

Lǐ Quán says: "Twenty *liǎng* make a *yì*." Between *zhū* and *yì*, light and heavy occupy opposite positions; so too do the calculations of victory and defeat.

Méi Yáochén says: "Strength makes control difficult."

Wáng Zhé says: "The terms *zhū* and *yì* clarify the extremes of light and heavy."

Zhāng Yù says: "Twenty *liǎng* make a *yì*, and twenty-four *zhū* make a *liǎng*. This speaks of disciplined troops facing undisciplined ones—light and heavy are incomparable."

"When victorious troops engage the people, it is like damming water in a thousand-*rèn* ravine—this is *xíng*."

Cáo Cāo says: "Eight *chǐ* make a *rèn*." Water dammed to a thousand *rèn* possesses swift and towering force.

Lǐ Quán says: "Eight *chǐ* make a *rèn*—this describes its power." When Dù Yù campaigned against Wú, he said the army advanced like splitting bamboo: after the first few joints, the rest cleaved apart effortlessly. This is the same principle.

Dù Mù says: "Water pooled in a thousand-*rèn* ravine is unfathomable, like my defense, which reveals no form. When the dam breaks, the torrent rushes forth unstoppably, like my attack, which cannot be withstood."

Méi Yáochén says: "Water dammed in a thousand-*rèn* ravine moves too swiftly to gauge; an army striking from the ninth heaven leaves no trace. This is the *xíng* of war."

Wáng Zhé says: "A thousand-*rèn* ravine is sheer and precipitous—this illustrates the form of the invincible facing the conquerable. Seizing the moment to attack is like releasing the dammed water."

Zhāng Yù says: "Water’s nature is to avoid heights and rush downward; when dammed, it surges into the deep ravine, swift and irresistible. The *xíng* of war resembles water: exploit the enemy’s unpreparedness, strike where unexpected, avoid the solid and attack the hollow—none can withstand it."

Some say: "A thousand-*rèn* ravine refers to an unfathomable abyss, whose depth no one can measure. When the dam breaks, its force cannot be resisted. Likewise, a skilled defender conceals form and obscures tracks, hiding in the depths of the nine earths, so the enemy cannot gauge strength or weakness. Yet when seizing the hollow to strike, its momentum cannot be met."

Cao Cao says: "The use of troops depends on *shi* (momentum)."
Li Quan says: "Formations are arranged to create structure, like the force of a dam’s breach—thus this chapter follows the preceding one."
Wang Zhe says: "*Shi* is the transformation of accumulated momentum. A skilled commander harnesses *shi* to secure victory without exhausting strength."
Zhang Yu says: "Once military *shi* is established, victory is achieved by relying on it—hence it follows the chapter on *xing* (form)."

Sunzi says: "Governing many is like governing few—this is a matter of *fenshu* (division and numbers)."
Cao Cao says: "Regiments are divisions; squads are numbers."
Li Quan says: "A master of warfare need only strike a gong or raise a banner, and the entire army responds. With orders fixed, it is as if commanding few."
Du Mu says: "*Fen* means division; *shu* means numbers. Troops in regiments and ranks are divided by their numbers, each assigned to subordinate officers. Training, promotions, and demotions are their responsibility—thus what I govern is few."
Han Xin says: "The more, the better—this is the principle."
Chen Hao says: "When troops are numerous, they must be organized into multiple units, each led by minor officers. Dividing their numbers ensures disciplined order. When facing the enemy, they are given tactics—thus though I command many, what I govern remains few."
Meng Shi says: "*Fen* refers to formations; *shu* to the total count of troops. The divisions and numbers are predetermined."
Mei Yaochen says: "The divisions of *qi* (unorthodox) and *zheng* (orthodox) formations each have their command structure."
Wang Zhe says: "*Fenshu* refers to regiments. Subordinate officers each have their divisions and assigned numbers, such as *shi* (divisions), *lü* (brigades), *zu* (companies), and *liang* (platoons)."
Zhang Yu says: "With many troops, first assign responsibilities to subordinate officers and fix the numbers in ranks to prevent disorder—only then can they be deployed. The method of governing troops is as follows: one man is *du* (solitary), two are *bi* (paired), three are *can* (triad). *Bi* and *can* form a *wu* (squad), five men a *lie* (file), two *lie* a *huo* (fire team), five *huo* a *dui* (platoon), two *dui* a *guan* (company), two *guan* a *qu* (regiment), two *qu* a *bu* (battalion), two *bu* a *xiao* (brigade), two *xiao* a *pi* (division), and two *pi* an *jun* (army). Each level commands the next, all subject to training—thus governing a million is like governing few."

Governing many is like governing few—this is a matter of *xingming* (form and designation).
Cao Cao says: "Banners are *xing* (form); gongs and drums are *ming* (designation)."
Du Mu says: "Banners and drums are also used by the enemy—how can they alone be *xingming*? Governing many is like governing few. *Xing* refers to formations; *ming* to banners. The *Art of War* states: 'Between formations, space is left for drawing blades.' Within a large formation, smaller formations occupy their own sectors, each with its distinct *xing*. Banners follow directional colors or bear animal emblems; each general and formation has its own name. Once *xingming* is established, focus is unified and momentum concentrated. Men fight as if alone—defeat or victory is their own. Thus commanding a million is like commanding a single man."
Chen Hao says: "With many soldiers spread across a broad front, they cannot recognize one another in battle. Hence banners serve as *xing* for identification. Movement and timing cannot be heard, so gongs and drums regulate them. The command is: 'Advance at the drum, halt at the gong.' Cao Cao’s explanation is correct."
Mei Yaochen says: "*Xing* is conveyed by banners; *ming* by insignia. Commands are executed swiftly, without delay."
Wang Zhe says: "Cao Cao says: 'Banners are *xing*; gongs and drums are *ming*.' I say: *Xing* refers to the system of banners, gongs, and drums; *ming* to their specific names."
Zhang Yu says: "*Military Regulations* states: 'When voices cannot be heard, drums and bells are used; when sights cannot be seen, banners are raised.' With many troops, distances are great, and sight and hearing fail. Thus soldiers advance or retreat by watching banners and move or halt by listening to gongs and drums—so the brave cannot advance alone, nor the timid retreat alone. This is the method of commanding many."

"Enabling the entire army to engage the enemy without defeat lies in the use of *qi* (unorthodox) and *zheng* (orthodox)."
Cao Cao says: "The first to engage is *zheng*; the later is *qi*."
Li Quan says: "Facing the enemy is *zheng*; flanking is *qi*. Without *qi* troops, one cannot contend for advantage."
The Han king of Wu, Ao, led his forces into Daliang. His general Tian Bolu advised: "If the army masses and advances west without alternative routes, success will be difficult. Let me take fifty thousand men to follow the Yangtze and Huai rivers upstream, seize the lands of Chu and Changsha, and enter Wuguan to rendezvous with Your Majesty. This would be one *qi* strategy." The king did not heed him.

Thus, he was defeated by Zhou Yafu. This was a case of having *zheng* without *qi*.

Du Mu says: "The explanation lies in the text below."
Jia Lin says: "Confronting the enemy with *zheng* formations secures victory, while *qi* troops strike from front, rear, left, and right in coordinated response—thus one constantly prevails without defeat."
Mei Yaochen says: "Movement is *qi*; stillness is *zheng*. Remain still to await the enemy, move to overcome them."
Wang Zhe says: "*Cha* should be *bi*—a scribal error. *Qi* and *zheng* mutually generate one another, hence one can engage the enemy without defeat."
He Shi says: "The nature of warfare is endlessly mutable, tangled and indistinct—yet nothing is not *zheng*, nothing is not *qi*. When troops are raised for a just cause, that is *zheng*; when facing the enemy, adapting to circumstances is *qi*. My *zheng* should appear as *qi* to the enemy; my *qi* should appear as *zheng*. *Zheng* becomes *qi*, *qi* becomes *zheng*. Generally, all warfare employs *qi* and *zheng*. Victory without *qi* or *zheng* is mere luck—a reckless gamble. As when Han Xin arrayed his troops with their backs to the river, led forces along the mountains, and seized the Zhao banners to shatter their state: the riverbank was *zheng*, the mountain circuit was *qi*. Later, Han Xin massed troops at Linjin while sending wooden jars across the Xiayang ford to ambush Anyi and capture King Bao of Wei: Linjin was *zheng*, Xiayang was *qi*. From this, we see that engaging the enemy without defeat depends on *qi* and *zheng*."

The *Wei Liaozi* states: "Now, with the sharpness of a *zhenyou* blade, the hardness of rhinoceros and buffalo hide, and the might of the Three Armies—if one employs *qi* and *zheng*, none in the world can withstand their assault."
Zhang Yu says: "Though the Three Armies are vast, enabling every soldier to engage the enemy without defeat lies in *qi* and *zheng*. The explanations of *qi* and *zheng* differ among scholars. The *Wei Liaozi* says: '*Zheng* troops value going first; *qi* troops value following after.' Cao Cao says: 'The first to engage is *zheng*; the later is *qi*.' Li Jing says: 'Troops advancing forward are *zheng*; those retreating are *qi*.' All these take *zheng* as *zheng* and *qi* as *qi*, never addressing their cyclical transformation. Only Emperor Taizong of Tang said: 'Use *qi* as *zheng*, making the enemy perceive it as *zheng*—then strike with *qi*. Use *zheng* as *qi*, making the enemy perceive it as *qi*—then strike with *zheng*. Blend them into one method, leaving the enemy unable to discern—this is the most thorough explanation. Where troops strike, it is like hurling a stone at an egg: this is the interplay of *xu* (void) and *shi* (solid).'"

Cao Cao says: "Strike the utmost void with the utmost solid."
Li Quan says: "*Xia* (flaw) is solid; *mao* (egg) is void. Striking void with solid is effortless."
Meng Shi says: "*Xia* is stone. If troops are trained to perfection, ranks and commands clear, and one thoroughly assesses the enemy’s situation to discern void and solid, then attacking with such troops is like hurling a stone at an egg."
Mei Yaochen says: "*Xia* is stone, pronounced *xia*. Striking void with solid is like breaking the brittle with the firm."
Wang Shi says: "*Yin* is iron-forging."
He Shi says: "In warfare, recognizing the dynamics of void and solid ensures invincibility."
Zhang Yu says: "The following chapter states: 'The skilled commander directs others and is not directed by them.' This is the method of *xu* and *shi* between self and enemy. Luring the enemy to come makes their force perpetually void; refusing to go to them keeps our force perpetually solid. Striking void with solid is like casting a stone at an egg—it shatters effortlessly. When assembling troops and gathering forces, first establish divisions and numbers. Once divisions are clear, practice formations and signals. When formations and signals are correct, distinguish *qi* and *zheng*. Once *qi* and *zheng* are discerned, void and solid become apparent. These four matters follow in sequence. In all battles, *zheng* engages, *qi* secures victory."

Cao Cao says: "*Zheng* confronts the enemy; *qi* troops strike from the flank where they are unprepared."
Li Quan says: "Without deception in battle, victory over the enemy is difficult."
Du You says: "*Zheng* confronts the enemy; *qi* strikes from the flank where they are unprepared. Engage in battle with *zheng*, secure victory through *qi* variation."
Mei Yaochen says: "Use *zheng* to engage in battle, *qi* to overcome the enemy."
He Shi says: "For example, when Lian Po was Zhao’s general, Qin sent a messenger saying, 'Qin fears only Zhao Kuo.' Lian Po was easy to deal with and would soon surrender. Hearing of Qin’s reverse inquiry, Zhao replaced Po with Kuo. Upon arrival, Kuo led troops to attack Qin. Qin feigned defeat and retreated, then deployed two *qi* forces to ambush him. Zhao pursued the apparent victory, pressing to Qin’s ramparts, which held firm and refused entry. Meanwhile, Qin’s *qi* troops—twenty-five thousand—cut off Zhao’s rear, while five thousand cavalry severed Zhao’s supply lines. Zhao’s forces were split in two, their provisions cut off, and Kuo was ultimately defeated.

Another example: When the Türks invaded the frontier, Emperor Yang of Sui ordered Tang Gaozu and Wang Renyong, governor of Mayi, to lead troops in defense. As bandits besieged Mayi, Renyong, outnumbered, grew fearful. Gaozu said, 'Now the emperor is distant, this isolated city cut off from aid. Without a fight to the death, survival is impossible.' He personally selected four thousand elite cavalry as a mobile force, living and moving with the Türks, following water and grass, indistinguishable from them. When they encountered Türk scouts, they merely galloped and hunted, feigning ease. Upon meeting the enemy, they formed a wedge-shaped formation, selecting skilled archers as a separate unit to hold their bows at full draw. The Türks, unable to gauge their strength, dared not engage. Gaozu then unleashed *qi* troops to rout them, capturing the Türk chieftain’s prized steed and beheading over a thousand.

Later, Emperor Taizong selected over a thousand elite cavalry as *qi* troops, all clad in black armor, divided into left and right wings, bearing great banners. He appointed generals Qin Shubao and Cheng Yaojin to command them. Whenever facing the enemy, Taizong donned black armor to lead the vanguard, advancing at the opportune moment. Wherever they struck, resistance crumbled. Often outnumbered, they still struck terror into the hearts of bandits."

During the Five Dynasties, when the founding emperor of the Later Han resided in Jinyang, Guo Jin sought refuge with him. The Han founder admired his talent. When northern barbarians sacked Anyang City, he dispatched Jin to retake it. The barbarians fled, and Jin was appointed Prefect of Fangzhou. When the barbarian chieftain died en route, the Han founder launched *qi* troops through Jingxing Pass. Jin, taking the road ahead, entered the northern marshes and thereby pacified Hebei. These were all advances achieved through *qi* victories.

Zhang Yu remarked: When two armies face each other, first engage with regular troops; then slowly unleash *qi* troops, either striking their flanks or attacking their rear to secure victory. This resembles how the Duke of Zheng repelled the Yan forces, deploying three armies at their front while concealing another to strike their rear.

Thus, those skilled in deploying *qi* are as inexhaustible as heaven and earth. Li Quan said: In movement and stillness. As unceasing as the rivers and seas. Li Quan said: Flowing without end. Du You said: This speaks of responding to change with inexhaustible *qi*. Zhang Yu said: It means adapting with endless *qi* and variation.

Ending yet beginning anew—such are the sun and moon. Dying yet reviving—such are the four seasons. Li Quan said: *Qi* transforms like the sun, moon, and four seasons, their waxing and waning, cold and heat unceasing. Du You said: The sun and moon revolve, setting and rising again; the four seasons alternate, flourishing and declining. This describes how *qi* and regular forces shift and change, like the sun and moon’s advance and retreat, the four seasons’ rise and fall. Zhang Yu said: The sun and moon revolve, setting and rising again; the four seasons alternate, flourishing and declining. This illustrates how *qi* and regular forces intermingle in boundless transformation, beginning and ending without end.

There are no more than five notes, yet the variations of the five notes are beyond hearing. Li Quan said: Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu. Li Quan said: Their variations enter the eight sounds, and the melodies played are endless. There are no more than five colors, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond sight. Li Quan said: Blue, yellow, red, white, and black. There are no more than five flavors, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting. Li Quan said: Sour, pungent, salty, sweet, and bitter. Cao Cao said: From "as inexhaustible as heaven and earth" onward, all illustrate the endlessness of *qi* and regular forces. Li Quan said: The variations of the five flavors are like a chef’s culinary mastery. Du Mu said: From "as inexhaustible as heaven and earth" onward, all compare the eight formations’ *qi* and regular forces. Zhang Yu said: The variations of the five notes, five colors, and five flavors illustrate the endless generation of *qi* and regular forces.

The dynamics of war are no more than *qi* and regular forces, yet their variations are inexhaustible. Li Quan said: Ambushes, interceptions, feints, and raids—countless tactical forms cannot be exhausted. Mei Yaochen said: The variations of *qi* and regular forces are like those of the five notes, five colors, and five flavors—endless. Wang Zhe said: *Qi* and regular forces are the key and pivot of warfare, the crux of victory. Adapting to the enemy in battle, they cycle endlessly; exhaustion leads to defeat. Meng Shi said: The *Six Secret Teachings* states: *Qi* and regular forces emerge from an inexhaustible source. Zhang Yu said: The dynamics of battle formations are limited to *qi* and regular forces alone, yet their variations in application are myriad, with countless paths—how could they be exhausted?

*Qi* and regular forces generate each other, like a cycle without end—who can exhaust them? Li Quan said: *Qi* and regular forces depend on each other to arise, like a ring without beginning or end. Mei Yaochen said: Their transformations and movements are infinite. Wang Zhe said: The enemy cannot exhaust us. He Shi said: *Qi* and regular forces arise and transform in turn, like tracing a ring to seek its beginning and end—both are unfathomable. Zhang Yu said: *Qi* becomes regular, regular becomes *qi*; their transformations generate each other like a cycle without origin or end—who can exhaust their meaning?

The swiftness of rushing water can even float stones—this is *shi*. Meng Shi said: When *shi* is steep, even heavy stones cannot resist. Du You said: Water is soft by nature, stone hard and heavy, yet rushing water can carry great stones and hurl them downstream—all due to the force of its swift, surging flow. Zhang Yu said: Though water is soft, when channeled through narrow, critical paths, its swift flow gains the *shi* to turn massive stones.

The speed of a startled bird can break and shatter—this is *jie*. Cao Cao said: Launching an attack on the enemy. Li Quan said: If soft *shi* can turn the hard, how much more so for warfare? The reason slingshots can strike flying birds is their mastery of speed and timing. Du Mu said: *Shi* is like water flowing from high to low, gaining swift, perilous force—thus it can float stones. *Jie* is measuring distance to strike—thus it can shatter objects. Du You said: Launching an attack on the enemy is like an eagle or falcon’s strike—able to crush and break prey because of keen observation and precise timing. Master Wang said: When an eagle strikes, no bird can contest its *shi*; when a fierce tiger rouses, no beast can rival its might. Mei Yaochen said: Though water is soft, its swift *shi* can float stones; though a bird is small, its forceful *jie* can shatter objects. Wang Zhe said: The speed of a startled bird is also *shi*, for *shi* enables its striking *jie*. The text first speaks of perilous terrain, hence the analogy of floating stones. He Shi said: Water can move stones through the *shi* of high and low; a bird can seize prey by timing its distance. Zhang Yu said: When eagles and falcons seize birds and sparrows, they measure distance, observe carefully, and strike—thus they can shatter objects. The *Master Wei Liao* states: Prepare our weapons, cultivate our martial valor, and unleash them like a bird’s strike.

Li Jing said: When a startled bird is about to strike, it flies low and draws in its wings—all speak of awaiting the moment before unleashing. Thus, those skilled in warfare make their *shi* perilous.

Cao Cao and Li Quan said: *Perilous* means swift.
Du Mu said: *Perilous* refers to the momentum of war—once unleashed, it slays men, hence the later analogy of a drawn crossbow.
Wang Zhe said: *Perilous* means bending to achieve speed, like water gaining force through narrow straits.

Their *jie* is short.
Cao Cao and Li Quan said: *Short* means near.
Du Mu said: It refers to proximity in timing.
Like a startled bird’s strike, when near, it seizes its prey—strength is whole, focus is single, and thus it captures.
Du You said: *Short* means near; *jie* means decisive. *Short* and *near* speak of seizing victory from danger by striking close.
Mei Yaochen said: *Perilous* is swift, *short* is forceful—thus the momentum of battle should be swift and close.
Wang Zhe said: A startled bird’s strike succeeds because its release is precise, its incoming *shi* distant, yet the *jie* of its grasp is exceedingly short. Seizing the moment in warfare should be like this.
Cao Cao said: *Short* means near.
Meng’s commentary agrees with Du Mu’s.

Zhang Yu said: *Perilous* is swift; *short* is near. Those skilled in warfare first measure the distance and breadth of the terrain, then array their formations, ensuring ranks and files are not far apart. In advancing to strike, they take fifty paces as their *jie*, never exceeding it—thus their *shi* is swift and hard to resist, their *jie* near and easy to prevail. Their *shi* is like a drawn crossbow, their *jie* like the release of its trigger.

Cao Cao said: Within range, the shot will strike true.
Li Quan said: A crossbow must be swift to reach far; an arrow must be near to hit its mark. *Shi* values speed, *jie* demands swiftness.
Du Mu said: *Strong* means drawn. Like a crossbow drawn taut, once released, it kills—hence the earlier phrase *its shi is perilous*. The trigger must be measured by proximity to strike true—hence the earlier phrase *its jie is short*, for *short* means near. This warns that formations must not pursue the enemy too far, lest their ranks scatter and break, leaving them vulnerable to counterattack. Thus, the *Oath of Muye* says: *Six steps, seven steps; four strikes, five strikes*—this is the virtue of proximity.
Chen Hao said: A crossbow’s trigger, when released near, strikes easily; meeting the enemy swiftly brings quick victory. If advance is not swift or strike not near, one cannot overcome the foe and secure triumph.
Jia Lin said: The *shi* of battle is like a drawn crossbow; the *shi* of troops is like the release of its trigger.
Mei Yaochen said: *Strong* (pronounced *huò*) means drawn taut. Like a crossbow drawn, its *shi* brooks no delay; like the trigger released, its *jie* is near and strikes true.
Wang Shi said: The *shi* of battle is like a drawn crossbow—it awaits the moment. When an exploitable *shi* appears, it is like releasing the trigger.
He Shi said: *Perilous* is swift; *short* is near. This speaks of seizing the moment in battle, like a drawn crossbow releasing its trigger—*shi* should be swift, *jie* advantageous in proximity, and pursuit must not overreach. Thus, the *Tai Gong* said: *Strike like releasing a trigger*—this is how to shatter the enemy’s subtlety.
Zhang Yu said: Like a drawn crossbow, *shi* cannot be slow; like a released trigger, *jie* cannot be distant. This speaks of hastening toward advantage and valuing proximity in striking. Thus, the *Tai Gong* said: *Strike like releasing a trigger*—this is how to shatter the enemy’s subtlety.

Amidst the fluttering and swirling, the state is in chaos yet cannot be disordered;
In the murky and formless, the formation is round and cannot be broken.
Cao Cao said: The banners are in disarray—displaying chaos to the enemy while unifying with gongs and drums. Cavalry and infantry wheel about, their formation round, their entry and exit orderly.
Li Quan said: Though appearing disordered in their fluttering, they show readiness; with banners arrayed and gongs sounded in rhythm, they cannot be disordered. *Murky* means mixed; *round* means without front or rear. Though appearing vulnerable to defeat, they cannot be broken—this is due to the unity of commands.
Du Mu said: This speaks of formation tactics. The *Wòqí* text of the *Wind Duke* says: *Four as the regular, four as the奇 (unconventional), the remainder as the握 (reserve).* The *奇* (pronounced *jī*) may be collectively called the vanguard, first sent to secure both flanks—this is the method.
*Qi* means *remnant*.

There are nine formations in total, with the central *zero* held immovably by the commanding general to control the four directions and eight arrays, thereby establishing the standard. In the ranks of soldiers, each face aligns with another, and each back supports another.

The *Zhou Rituals* records the *Sōu* and *Miáo* grand hunts, where chariots galloped and infantry rushed forward, halting only upon reaching the *biao*—their advance and retreat, speed and slowness, sparsity and density all regulated as in battle formations. The *biao* is a banner, for banners are where the people pledge their rendezvous below.

The *Wòqí* text states: *The vanguard is first sent to secure both flanks.* This vanguard carries the standard of its own direction, first establishing the boundaries before the troops assemble beneath the banner. Only then do the *qi* (unconventional) and *zheng* (regular) forces emerge, transforming into formations.

The *Zhou Rituals*’ accounts of the *Sōu* and *Miáo* hunts—where chariots charged and infantry surged until reaching the banner—preserve the legacy of the eight arrays and the *Wòqí* method. Beyond this, all other passages were later additions by subsequent authors to amplify the difficulty of the matter.

Among the five weapons, none surpasses the efficacy of the bow and arrow in overawing the realm. The five weapons share governance, yet only the bow and arrow are represented by a celestial constellation. The sages uniquely declare that the bow and arrow alone can overawe the world—why do they not speak of the other weapons? Because the tactical advantage of the bow and arrow is realized only through formation. Thus, the Yellow Emperor triumphed over Chiyou by employing the chariots and infantry of the Central Plains to subdue the cavalry of the barbarian tribes—this was the power of the bow and arrow.

In more recent times, this can be verified: during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, the Qiang tribes overran Liangzhou. Marshal Ma Long requested to recruit three thousand valiant soldiers to pacify them. He enlisted those who could draw crossbows of thirty-six *jun* and bows of four *jun*, testing them with marked targets. As his army crossed the Wen River to the west, the rebel Tufa Shujineng, with tens of thousands of troops, blocked Ma Long’s path. Long adhered to the eight-array method, advancing while fighting. Wherever his bows and arrows struck, men fell at the twang of the string, and tens of thousands were slain, thereby pacifying Liangzhou.

During the Sui dynasty, the Göktürks invaded. Yang Su engaged them in battle. Previously, other generals, wary of the Göktürk cavalry’s charges, had interspersed war chariots with infantry, arranging them in square formations with *shenglu* and *yulin* shields, while cavalry remained within. When Yang Su arrived, he abolished these old methods, ordering each division to operate independently as infantry and cavalry. Upon hearing this, the Göktürks clapped their foreheads and looked to the heavens, exclaiming, “Heaven has granted them to us!” They swiftly amassed over a hundred thousand elite cavalry. Yang Su crushed them in a single decisive battle.

This is how infantry overcomes cavalry—without formation tactics and mastery of opening and closing, advance and retreat, how could one secure victory? As the *Qu Li* states: "March with the Vermilion Bird ahead and the Dark Warrior behind, the Azure Dragon to the left and the White Tiger to the right; the Dipper’s handle points above, swiftly kindling its wrath." Zheng Sinong explains: "The four beasts represent the army’s formation, mirroring the heavens." Kong’s commentary adds: "This speaks of military formations modeled on celestial patterns, though the specifics remain unclear." He Che elaborates: "The four beasts are painted on banners to mark the front, rear, left, and right of the formation. 'Swiftly kindling its wrath' describes the soldiers’ fierce and formidable might, like the anger of heaven. *Zhaoyao* refers to the seventh star of the Dipper’s handle; by naming it, the other six stars are implied. The formation mirrors the celestial patterns—specifically, the Northern Dipper."

It further states: "Advance and retreat follow measure." Zheng Sinong annotates: "Measure refers to strikes and step counts." Kong’s commentary cites the *Muye Oath*: "Six steps, seven steps; four strikes, five strikes." It continues: "Left and right have their divisions." Zheng Sinong explains: "Divisions refer to troop allocations." Kong’s commentary clarifies: "The army’s left and right flanks each have their sectors; when advancing, they engage the enemy; when retreating, they rejoin their ranks, never falling into disarray."

The text proceeds: "An enemy to one’s father is one with whom one cannot share the sky; an enemy to one’s brother is one against whom one does not sheathe the blade; a betrayal by a friend is one that bars them from the same land. When ramparts rise on all four borders, this is the shame of ministers and grandees." This speaks of enmity and disgrace escalating to war, where victory is the sole aim—hence the necessity of mastering formation tactics. The passage’s sequence reveals the profound intent of sages and worthies.

The *Military Records* state: "Within a formation, space allows for deployment; within a unit, space permits facing the enemy. The front guards the front, the rear holds the rear, the left defends the left, the right protects the right. In march, they move in single file; in stance, they align in ranks. The long supports the short, the short reinforces the long. When the army wheels and the formation shifts, the former front becomes the rear, the former rear becomes the front—advancing, there is no rout; retreating, no flight. With four heads and eight tails, wherever touched becomes the lead; if the enemy strikes the center, both ends rush to aid." This aligns with the *Qu Li*’s principles. The numbers begin at five and culminate in eight.

Today, before the Kuizhou prefectural hall, Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han arranged stones in eight intersecting rows to form a square formation. From this arose the interplay of *qi* (unconventional) and *zheng* (conventional) tactics—*qi* becomes the *zheng* of *zheng*, and *zheng* becomes the *qi* of *qi*, their mutual employment endless. When Zhuge emerged from Xie Valley with few troops, he relied solely on the *zheng* deployment of six divisions; remnants of his old ramparts still stand in the Zhengwu Sizhu Garden. Sima Yi, with a hundred thousand infantry and cavalry, dared not engage, for he recognized Zhuge’s skill.

Du You states: "Banners appear disordered; to the enemy, they seem chaotic, yet drums and gongs unify them. Fluttering banners mimic the swarming of soldiers. The banners twist and turn, now converging, now dispersing; troops advance and withdraw, now advancing, now retreating—appearing scattered, seemingly in disarray. Yet their commands are long established, duties clearly defined, each with their place; though stirred, they are not disordered. Chariots and cavalry turn in unison, their form circular, their movements orderly, their entry and exit disciplined. *Hunhun* describes the turning of chariot wheels; *dundun*, the galloping of infantry. Though their formation stretches and contracts, round yet not square, every maneuver has its response."

Thus, the Prince of Qi said: "To appear inwardly enlightened yet outwardly dim, inwardly ordered yet outwardly chaotic—this is how one shows the enemy their own contempt." Mei Yaochen remarked: "With divisions fixed and designations set, dispersion and assembly may seem chaotic, yet cannot be so. The formation lacks head or tail, responds without front or rear; it revolves and shifts, yet cannot be broken." Wang Zhe noted: "Cao Cao said: 'Banners appear disordered; to the enemy, they seem chaotic, yet drums and gongs unify them.' I say this describes their seemingly tangled, broken appearance. That they cannot be disordered stems from strict discipline." Cao Cao also said: "When chariots and cavalry turn, their form is round, their movements orderly, their entry and exit disciplined." Wang Zhe added: "The *hundun* (chaotic) roundness is unfathomable; that it cannot be broken arises from its seamless unity and unpredictability."

He Shi observed: "This speaks of a state’s power. A skilled commander’s troops may seem to advance and retreat in disarray, yet men and horses are well-trained, banners follow rhythm—this is no disorder. The *hundun* form shifts between separation and union; though appearing broken, commands remain clear, cohesion intact—it cannot be defeated. The round form lacks fixed ranks."

Zhang Yu stated: "This is the eight-formation method. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor established the well-field system and thereby regulated troops. Thus, the well divides into four paths, with eight families residing within. The well’s shape forms nine squares; five serve as formation, four as open ground—hence the saying, 'numbers begin at five.' The center remains empty, where the commander resides, encircled by the four sides, each unit connected—hence 'culminating in eight.' When adapting to enemy changes, troops disperse and gather in seeming chaos, yet the method remains unbroken; though the form is round, the force does not scatter—this is 'dividing into eight, reuniting as one.' Later generations, from Zhuge Liang’s square formation to Li Jing’s six-petal array and Emperor Taizong of Tang’s *Breaking Formation Dance*, all inherited this tradition."

"Disorder arises from order, cowardice from courage, weakness from strength." Cao Cao said: "All involve concealing form and masking intent." Li Quan added: "Relying on strict order yet neglecting to soothe subordinates breeds resentment—disorder will arise. When Qin unified the realm, it melted weapons and burned books, converting states into commanderies and counties. Yet Qin declared itself the First Emperor, entrenched in Guanzhong, believing its might would endure for ten thousand generations."

Huhai’s arrogance and extravagance allowed Chen Sheng and Wu Guang to seize the moment of decay and rise in rebellion—this is "disorder arising from order." Defeated by the enemy.

King Fu Jian of Qin marched his armies to attack Jin—this was courage; yet upon his defeat, the rustling of wind and the cries of cranes made him mistake them for Jin forces—this was cowardice, "cowardice arising from courage."

King Fuchai of Wu’s troops were unmatched under heaven at Huangchi, and he humiliated Yue at Kuaiji—this was strength; yet later, his city gates lay unguarded, his palace besieged by soldiers, Fuchai slain, and his kingdom annexed—this is "weakness arising from strength."

Du Mu said: To feign disorder to lure the enemy, one must first attain perfect order, then one may simulate disorder. To feign cowardice to deceive the enemy, one must first attain perfect courage, then one may simulate cowardice. To feign weakness to provoke the enemy, one must first attain perfect strength, then one may simulate weakness.

Jia Lin said: Relying on order breeds disorder; relying on courage and strength breeds cowardice and weakness.

Mei Yaochen said: With order, one may feign disorder; with courage, one may feign cowardice; with strength, one may feign weakness.

Wang Zhe echoed Mei Yaochen’s annotation.

He Shi said: This speaks of employing the dynamics of the extraordinary and the orthodox in battle to break the enemy. If our troops are inherently ordered, our warriors inherently courageous, our momentum inherently strong, how can we entice the enemy without concealing our order, courage, and strength? We must display the semblance of chaos, cowardice, and weakness to lure the enemy. Once they are deluded by our deceptive guise, their defeat is assured.

Zhang Yu said: To show the enemy confusion is to conceal one’s order; to show the enemy timidity is to conceal one’s courage; to show the enemy frailty is to conceal one’s strength. All involve masking one’s true form to mislead the enemy.

Order and disorder stem from *shu* (numerical organization).
Cao Cao said: This refers to organizing troops by divisions and ranks to prevent disorder.
Li Quan said: It refers to the cyclical reckoning of time. The calamities of the "hundred and six" arise from the numerical patterns of yin and yang, not from human action, but from the convergence of the times.
Du Mu said: Troops must have clear divisions and ranks, with each unit assigned its place and number. Only then can order be achieved, and only then can one feign disorder. Feigning disorder involves irregular movements, scattered foraging parties, and lax guard shifts.
Jia Lin said: The distinction between order and disorder lies in their respective measures.
Mei Yaochen said: To feign disorder while maintaining order depends on numerical organization.
Wang Zhe said: Order and disorder are transformations of *shu*, where *shu* refers to systems and regulations.
Zhang Yu said: To truly be ordered yet feign disorder is to rely on the numerical organization of troops and ranks. As stated earlier, "governing the many as one governs the few" depends on *shu* (numerical organization).

Courage and cowardice arise from *shi* (momentum).
Li Quan said: When troops seize the advantage of *shi*, even the cowardly become brave; when they lose it, even the brave become cowardly. There is no fixed method in warfare—success depends on adapting to *shi*.
Du Mu said: This speaks of feigning cowardice while possessing courage. By remaining motionless when presented with a favorable opportunity, the enemy will perceive us as truly cowardly.
Chen Hao said: Courage is swift and vigorous; cowardice is sluggish and hesitant. If the enemy sees us hesitate to advance, they will deem us cowardly, growing careless. We may then exploit their complacency and strike with the advantage of *shi*. Examples include Long Ju underestimating Han Xin and the people of Zheng deceiving our forces.
Meng Shi’s annotation aligns with Chen Hao’s.
Mei Yaochen said: To feign cowardice while possessing courage is to display no intent to engage.
Wang Zhe said: Courage and cowardice are transformations of *shi*.
Zhang Yu said: To truly be courageous yet feign cowardice is to leverage *shi*. When the Wei general Pang Juan attacked Han, the Qi general Tian Ji came to its aid. Sun Bin told Ji: "The troops of the Three Jin are fierce and brave, and they scorn Qi, calling us cowardly. A skilled commander exploits such *shi* to his advantage." Thus, the Qi army entered Wei territory, reducing its encampments daily. Upon hearing this, Pang Juan rejoiced, saying, "I always knew the Qi were cowards!" He pursued them with double-speed marches and was defeated at Maling.

Strength and weakness arise from *xing* (form).
Cao Cao said: This depends on the appropriateness of form and momentum.
Du Mu said: To feign weakness while possessing strength, one must display the proper form. The Xiongnu chanyu Modu deceived Lou Jing by appearing feeble and aged.
Chen Hao said: King Zhuang of Chu disbanded his central army to embolden the enemy, planning for a later strike—this is another example.
Mei Yaochen said: To feign weakness while possessing strength is to display frailty and timidity.
Wang Zhe said: Strength and weakness are transformations of *xing*.
He Shi said: The form and momentum are temporarily altered to provoke the enemy into battle—this is neither true cowardice nor true weakness. Feigning disorder while remaining ordered means the ranks are fundamentally disciplined.
Zhang Yu said: To truly be strong yet feign weakness is to reveal one’s form. When Emperor Gaozu of Han sought to attack the Xiongnu, he sent envoys to scout them. The Xiongnu concealed their strong warriors and sturdy horses, displaying only weak soldiers and emaciated livestock. Ten envoys reported that the Xiongnu could be attacked. Only Lou Jing said: "When two states clash, each should flaunt its strengths. Now, all we see are the old and weak—there must be hidden forces. We cannot attack." The emperor ignored him and was indeed besieged at Baideng.

Thus, one who excels at moving the enemy presents a *xing* (form), and the enemy will invariably follow it.
Cao Cao said: This means displaying a feeble form.
Li Quan said: One who excels at luring the enemy may command a strong army yet control the enemy’s advances and retreats. When the Jin attacked Qi, they scouted the mountains and marshes, even where they did not venture, yet they adorned and spread out their formations, dragging branches to raise dust. The Qi forces observed from the mountains and, seeing the banners and dust, believed the Jin army was vast. They fled under cover of night—thus, Jin feigned weakness to make Qi appear strong. When Qi attacked Wei, General Tian Ji followed Sun Bin’s strategy, reducing their encampments daily as they advanced toward Daliang. The Wei general Pang Juan pursued them, saying, "How cowardly the Qi and Lu are!"

Half had perished upon entering our borders. At Maling, they were defeated by the Qi forces, where Pang Juan was slain and the Crown Prince of Wei captured before they retreated. This was feigning weakness to make the enemy follow.

Du Mu said: It is not merely about appearing feeble. If I am strong and the enemy weak, I display a weak form to lure them; if I am weak and the enemy strong, I display a strong form to drive them away. The enemy’s movements must all follow my design.

Sun Bin said: Qi had a reputation for cowardice, and the Three Jin states belittled them. Upon entering Wei territory, they set up campfires for one hundred thousand troops, then the next day for fifty thousand. Pang Juan pursued them, saying, "How timid the Qi are!" By the time they entered our land, over half their forces had perished. Spurred on, he pressed the chase until they reached Maling, where the path narrowed. Sun Bin had trees felled and inscribed: "Pang Juan shall die beneath this tree." He laid an ambush with crossbows, ordering, "Loose only when you see the fire." When Pang Juan arrived, he struck flint to read the inscription—ten thousand crossbows fired at once, and Pang Juan was slain. This was displaying a weak form to move Pang Juan, drawing him to follow and be destroyed.

Emperor Yang of Sui was besieged at Mamen by Shibi Khan of the Türks. Prince Taizong volunteered to relieve him, serving under General Yun Dingxing. Before departing, he said to Dingxing: "Display many banners and drums to create the illusion of a vast army. Shibi Khan dares besiege the Son of Heaven only because he believes we have no reinforcements. Let us expand our military presence—by day, let banners stretch unbroken for tens of *li*; by night, let drums and torches echo one another. The Türks will think our reinforcements have arrived, and seeing the dust, they will flee. Otherwise, outnumbered as we are, we cannot hold for long." Dingxing followed his advice. When the army reached Yong County, Shibi Khan retreated. Here, though weak against a strong enemy, we displayed strength to drive them away. Thus, whether the enemy comes or goes, all follows the form I present.

Mei Yaochen said: Display disorder and weakness to make them follow.
Wang Zhe said: Lure the enemy to follow.
He Shi said: Alter form and shift momentum to entice the enemy into action. If the enemy is blind to the ruse, they will fall into my trap and come—then my strength will be sufficient to subdue them.
Zhang Yu said: Display a weak form, and the enemy will follow. When Jin and Chu clashed, Miao Zihuang advised the Marquis of Jin: "If you make Fan and Yi appear easy to attack, the two Zhongs of the Central Army will surely defeat the two Mus." Indeed, they routed the Chu forces. Later, when Chu invaded Sui, they feigned a weak formation. Ji Liang said, "Chu’s weakness is a lure." Both instances exemplify these two principles.

Offer it, and the enemy will surely take it.
Cao Cao said: Use profit to entice the enemy, drawing them far from their fortifications to strike their exposed and isolated forces.
Du Mu said: When Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at Guandu, Cao moved west along the Yellow River, and Yuan crossed to pursue him. Cao camped at Nanban, dismounting and removing his saddle. As his supply train set out, his generals, seeing the enemy cavalry’s numbers, urged retreat. Xun Yu said, "This is bait—how can we leave?" Yuan’s general Wen Chou and Liu Bei advanced with five or six thousand cavalry, some heading for the supplies. Cao said, "Now is the time." They mounted—though their cavalry numbered fewer than six hundred—and crushed the enemy, slaying Wen Chou.
Mei Yaochen said: Display fear and cowardice to make them take the bait.
Wang Zhe said: Entice the enemy to take it.
*Yu* and *yu* are interchangeable.
Zhang Yu said: Lure them with small gains, and the enemy will come to take it. Wu used prisoners to bait Yue; Chu used firewood gatherers to bait Jiao—both are examples.

Move them with profit, and await them with troops.
Cao Cao said: Use profit to move the enemy.
Li Quan said: When the Grand Marshal Deng Yu of the Later Han attacked the Red Eyebrows, they feigned retreat, abandoning their supplies. Their carts were loaded with earth, covered with beans. Deng Yu’s army, starving, rushed to seize them, breaking formation. The Red Eyebrows’ ambush struck, and Deng Yu was routed—this illustrates the principle.
Du Mu said: Move the enemy with profit, and once they follow, prepare your troops to await them. The preceding explanation covers this.
Mei Yaochen said: In all these cases, entice the enemy to follow, then await them with elite troops.
Wang Zhe said: Whether making them follow or take the bait, first prepare your troops to await them.
He Shi said: If the enemy values what I offer, they will abandon formation. Once profit moves them, strike with your waiting troops—victory is assured. When Cao Cao campaigned west against Ma Chao, they faced each other across the Pass. Cao feigned urgency while secretly dispatching Xu Huang and Zhu Ling to cross the Puqi Ford by night and establish a camp west of the river. As Cao crossed north from Tong Pass, Ma Chao rushed the boats in a fierce battle. Cao released oxen and horses to bait the enemy. The rebels scattered to seize them, allowing Cao to cross. He followed the river, building a walled road south. The rebels withdrew to the Wei River mouth. Cao then set up numerous decoy troops while secretly ferrying soldiers into the Wei by boat to build a floating bridge. At night, he divided his forces to encamp south of the river. The rebels attacked the camp at night, but the ambush struck, breaking them.

During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, Tufa Rutan of Southern Liang defended Guzang. Yao Xing of Later Qin sent General Yao Bi to the city walls. Rutan drove oxen and sheep into the wilds; Yao Bi’s troops plundered them, and Rutan’s forces struck, crushing them. In the late Northern Wei, the Grand General Guangyang Prince Yuan Shen campaigned against the Northern Di. He sent Yu Jin alone into enemy territory to display kindness and good faith. Thus, the chieftains of the Western Tiele, including Qiliehe and others—over thirty thousand households—all submitted and migrated south together. Guangyang intended to meet Yu Jin at Zhefushan Ridge to welcome them. Yu said, "Poluohan Baling’s forces are not few. Hearing of Qiliehe’s submission, they will surely intercept them."

If they seize the strategic passes first, it will be difficult to contend with them. Now, using Poluohan and others as bait, they will surely vie to plunder. Then, we set an ambush and wait—defeating them will be as easy as pointing to our palm. Guangyang approved his plan. Baling indeed came to intercept, crushing Qiliehe’s forces on the ridge, and his entire army was annihilated. The hidden troops sprang forth, and the enemy was utterly routed, with all of Qiliehe’s followers recovered.

Zhang Yu said: When the form is already compliant, and you further entice them, you move them with profit so they come—then await them with elite troops. Li Jing regarded soldiers as the foundation; awaiting them with the foundation means employing disciplined regular forces.

Thus, the skilled warrior seeks victory through strategic advantage, not by demanding it of men. Du You said: The way of victory or defeat lies in self-preparation, not in blaming subordinates or forcing them to advance through anger. Like Duke Mu of Qin, who repented his error and did not dismiss Meng Ming.

Therefore, one must select men and leverage the strategic advantage. (An alternate version reads: *Therefore, one must select men and employ them.*) Many commentators adopt the "leverage the strategic advantage" reading.

Cao Cao said: Seeking victory through strategic advantage means relying entirely on adaptability. Not demanding it of men means clarity in tactical flexibility.

Li Quan said: When fighting with strategic advantage, even the timid can be brave. Thus, one must select those capable of bearing the task. The brave may be used for battle, the cautious for defense, the wise for persuasion—nothing is to be discarded.

Du Mu said: The skilled warrior first assesses the military situation, then evaluates men’s abilities, assigning tasks according to their strengths and weaknesses, without demanding the impossible of those unsuited.

When Cao Cao campaigned against Zhang Lu in Hanzhong, he left Zhang Liao, Li Dian, and Yue Jin with over a thousand men to guard Hefei. He entrusted a sealed order to Protector-General Xue Ti, with instructions to open it only upon the enemy’s arrival. Soon after, Sun Quan of Wu besieged Hefei with a hundred thousand troops. The generals opened the order, which read: *If Sun Quan arrives, Generals Zhang and Li will sortie, General Yue will hold the city, and the Protector-General must not engage in battle.* The commanders were doubtful. Zhang Liao said: "The Lord is campaigning afar. By the time reinforcements arrive, they will have already broken us. The order directs us to strike before they consolidate, breaking their momentum to steady the men’s hearts. Then we can hold. The pivot of victory or defeat lies in this single action." Li Dian joined Zhang Liao in the sortie, and they crushed Sun Quan’s forces, sapping the morale of the Wu troops. Upon returning, they reinforced the defenses, and the men’s hearts were settled. Sun Quan besieged the city for ten days without success, then withdrew.

Sun Sheng commented: War is a deceptive art. In the defense of Hefei, with scant forces and no aid, relying solely on the brave would invite reckless conflict, while relying solely on the timid would make fear difficult to overcome. Moreover, their numbers were vast, and the many are prone to complacency and indolence. We, with a determined force, strike at their indolent troops—our position is superior. Victory secured, we then hold, and our defenses become unassailable. Thus, the Martial Lord of Wei selected warriors of diverse temperaments, blending their differences, issuing secret instructions, and regulating their deployment. When the moment came, they responded as if by preordained agreement.

Jia Lin said: The reading is *select men and leverage the strategic advantage*, meaning one presents an irresistible momentum to compel obedience, rather than externally demanding victory or defeat from men. Select men of courage or caution and assign them roles of advance or retreat.

Chen Hao said: The skilled warrior focuses entirely on strategic advantage, seizing opportunities swiftly, not allowing the enemy to act first. He relies entirely on tactical adaptability, not demanding success from men. If compelled to employ men, he must select and assign them appropriately.

Du You said: Clarity in adaptability means placing men according to one’s own strategic advantage.

Mei Yaochen said: Employing men through strategic advantage is easy; demanding effort from them is difficult. The capable lie in selecting men and leveraging strategic advantage.

He Shi said: Gaining strategic advantage ensures victory without solely demanding effort from men.

Wang Xi said: If a general can select men and leverage strategic advantage in battle, victory comes naturally. (Does "men" here refer to subordinates?)

Zhang Yu said: The method of employing men: use the cautious, the foolish, the wise, and the brave, each according to their natural strategic advantage, without demanding what they cannot do. Thus, one selects and assigns them according to their abilities.

The *Wei Liaozi* said: Utilize their strengths. Among the three armies, some excel in infantry, others in cavalry—employ them according to their abilities, and each will fully display their strengths. This is like the Marquis of Jin, who assessed abilities and assigned tasks accordingly.

Leveraging strategic advantage in battle is like rolling logs and stones: logs and stones are naturally still when stable, move when precarious, stop when square, and roll when round.

Cao Cao said: It means relying on natural strategic advantage.

Li Quan said: Commanding troops through strategic advantage should be like this.

Du You said: Placed on stable ground, they are stable; placed on perilous ground, they are perilous—without knowing to avoid it. Leveraging strategic advantage is natural. The shapes of square and round resemble the forms of military victory or defeat.

Mei Yaochen said: Logs and stones are heavy objects, easily moved by strategic advantage but difficult to shift by force. The three armies are vast, suited for battle through strategic advantage, not through forced effort—this is the natural Way.

He Shi’s note agrees with Mei Yaochen’s.

Zhang Yu said: The nature of logs and stones is such that placed on stable ground, they are still; placed on perilous ground, they move; square, they stop; round, they roll—this is natural strategic advantage. The three armies, when deeply committed, fear nothing; when without recourse, they hold firm; when compelled, they fight—this, too, is the natural Way. Thus, the skilled warrior’s strategic advantage is like rolling a round stone from a thousand-*ren* mountain—it is the strategic advantage. (Li Quan said: The *Shuowen* interprets *ju* as a steep slope, like a ball rolling downhill—speaking of its ease.)

Du Mu said: Rolling a stone from a thousand-*ren* mountain cannot be stopped—this lies in the mountain, not the stone.

The warrior who possesses the courage of a hundred victories, where strength and weakness become one, lies in strategic advantage, not in the individual.

Du Yuankai said: In the past, Yue Yi relied on the single battle of Jixi to conquer the mighty state of Qi. Now, with military might already established, it is like splitting bamboo—after the first few joints, the rest yield effortlessly, requiring no further effort. This is strategic advantage. Such advantage must not be lost. Thus, he advanced to Jianye and ultimately destroyed Wu.

This chapter largely speaks of the importance of relying on strategic advantage in warfare, taking perilous swiftness and speed as its foundation, thereby achieving great success with minimal effort.

Mei Yaochen said: A round stone on a mountain stands firm in its strategic advantage; though one man may push it, a thousand cannot restrain it.

Wang Zhe said: The stone cannot turn itself—it is the mountain’s strategic advantage that makes it unstoppable. Victory in battle cannot be recklessly achieved—it is the army’s strategic advantage that makes it irresistible.

Zhang Yu said: The stone rolling down the mountain cannot be stopped because strategic advantage compels it. An army positioned in peril cannot be controlled, for strategic advantage compels it as well.

Li Jing said: Warfare has three strategic advantages: When the general scorns the enemy, the soldiers delight in battle, their aspirations soar like clouds, and their spirit is as swift as the whirlwind—this is *qi* strategic advantage. Where narrow passes, winding paths, and constricted gates allow one man to hold off a thousand—this is terrain strategic advantage. When the enemy is lax, weary, hungry, or thirsty, when their vanguard has not yet encamped and their rearguard is only halfway across—this is *yin* strategic advantage. Thus, employing strategic advantage in warfare is like a ball rolling down a steep slope: the effort is minimal, yet the success is great.

*Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Six*

**On Emptiness and Fullness**

Cao Cao said: To discern emptiness and fullness in both enemy and self.
Li Quan said: The adept in warfare makes emptiness appear full; the adept in breaking the enemy makes fullness appear empty. Thus follows this chapter.
Du Mu said: In warfare, one avoids fullness and strikes emptiness—first one must recognize the emptiness and fullness of both enemy and self.
Wang Zhe said: In defense, one guards with fullness; in attack, one strikes with emptiness.
Zhang Yu said: The *Form* chapter speaks of attack and defense; the *Strategic Advantage* chapter discusses the orthodox and the extraordinary. The adept in warfare first understands the methods of balancing attack and defense, then comprehends the orthodox and the extraordinary; first grasps the mutual transformation of the orthodox and the extraordinary, then perceives emptiness and fullness. For the orthodox and the extraordinary arise from attack and defense, while emptiness and fullness emerge from the orthodox and the extraordinary. Thus follows *Strategic Advantage*.

Sunzi said: Generally, he who first occupies the battlefield and awaits the enemy is at ease.
Cao Cao and Li Quan both said: His strength is abundant.
Jia Lin said: He who first occupies a strategically advantageous position to await the enemy is well-prepared and at ease, his men and horses rested.
Du You concurs with Jia Lin’s annotation.
Wang Shi concurs with Cao Cao’s annotation.

Zhang Yu said: In terrain of strategic advantage, if I first occupy it to await the enemy’s arrival, then men and horses remain at ease, and strength is abundant. He who arrives later at the battlefield and rushes into battle is wearied.

Li Quan said: His strength is insufficient.

The *Taiyi Dunjia* states: When the enemy comes to attack me, I am the host, and he is the guest. The host has the advantage, the guest the difficulty. Thus the *Taiyi Dunjia* speaks of the principle of determining strategy. Therefore, the conditions of toil and ease differ, and the strategic advantages of first and last are not the same.

Du Mu said: Later, the Zhou dispatched generals and Turkic forces to press the Qi, and Qi’s general Duan Shao resisted them. After a great snowfall, the Zhou forces advanced with infantry as their vanguard, descending from the west two *li* from the city. The Qi generals wished to meet them in counterattack. Shao said: “The strength and momentum of infantry are inherently limited. Now that the snow lies thick, counterattack is not advantageous. It is better to array our forces and await them. They will be wearied, we at ease—we shall surely break them.” When battle was joined, they crushed the enemy, annihilating the vanguard, and the rest fled.

Jia Lin said: If the enemy occupies advantageous terrain, we should not advance, but instead lead our troops to occupy another position, showing that we dare not engage their forces. The enemy, believing us to be without strategy, will then come to attack. In this way, we reverse their fatigue and remain unwearied.

Meng Shi said: If the enemy has already secured a strategically advantageous position while we hasten toward profit, our men and horses will be wearied and exhausted—this is disadvantageous.

Mei Yaochen said: Arriving first to await the enemy preserves one’s strength; arriving late to rush into battle exhausts it.

He Shi said: During the Warring States period, the Qin army attacked Han and besieged Banyu. Zhao dispatched General Zhao She to relieve it. A soldier named Xu Li said: “The Qin did not expect the Zhao army to arrive here so soon. Their momentum is fierce. You, General, should thicken your ranks to await them; otherwise, defeat is certain.” He added: “Whoever first occupies the northern mountain will win; whoever arrives later will be defeated.” Zhao She immediately dispatched ten thousand men to rush there. The Qin forces arrived later and, unable to seize the mountain, contended for the heights. Zhao She unleashed his troops and struck, crushing the Qin army and lifting the siege of Banyu.

In the early years of the Later Han, various generals campaigned against Wei Ao but were defeated by him. Emperor Guangwu ordered his entire army to advance toward Gouyi. Before they arrived, Wei Ao, emboldened by victory, sent his general Wang Yuan and Xing Xun with over twenty thousand men down from the Long region, dispatching Xun to seize Gouyi. The Han general Feng Yi galloped ahead, intending to occupy it first. The other generals all said: “The enemy’s forces are strong and newly triumphant; we cannot contend with them. It is better to halt our army here and slowly devise a strategy.” Feng Yi replied: “The enemy, now at their peak, presses close to our borders, seizing small gains and thus advancing deeply. If they take Gouyi, the Three Auxiliaries will be shaken—this is my concern. The attacker is insufficient; the defender is abundant. Now, if we first occupy the city to await the weary with ease, this is not how one contends for advantage.” He then stealthily advanced, shut the gates, and stilled the drums and banners. Xing Xun, unaware, rushed toward the city. Feng Yi, seizing the moment of surprise, suddenly struck the drums, raised the banners, and sallied forth. The Xun’s army, thrown into chaos, fled in panic, and he pursued and crushed them.

During the Eastern Wei, General Qi Wushuang campaigned against the Western Wei, marching past Putong, fording the Luo River, and reaching Xuyuan. The Western Wei general Yuwen Tai advanced his army to Shayuan. Hearing of Yuwen Tai’s arrival, Qi Wushuang led his forces to meet him. The cavalry scout of the next morning reported that Qi Wushuang’s army was approaching. Yuwen Tai’s infantry general Li Bi said: “Their numbers exceed ours; we cannot array our forces on level ground. Ten *li* to the east lies a bend in the Wei River where we may first occupy a position to await them.” The army then advanced to the Wei River bend, arraying their forces with their backs to the water, facing east and west. When battle was joined, they crushed the enemy.

Zhang Yu said: If the enemy has already occupied advantageous terrain and we hasten toward them to fight, our men and horses will be wearied and our strength insufficient. Some say that in the terrain of battle, we should arrive first, array our forces, and await the enemy—thus we remain at ease. If the enemy has already formed ranks and we arrive later, we will be wearied. This is like the Song forces already in formation while the Chu army had not yet finished crossing. Therefore, the skilled warrior draws the enemy to himself and is not drawn by the enemy.

Li Quan said: Thus, one can exploit the enemy’s fatigue and avoid being lured into ease.

Du Mu said: Induce the enemy to come to you. You should conserve your strength to await them, not go to the enemy, lest you become weary.

In the Later Han, Zhang Bu’s general Fei Yi dispatched his brother Fei Gan to guard Juli. Geng Yan advanced his troops and first threatened Juli, ordering the felling of many trees and declaring an intention to fill the moats and trenches. After several days, a deserter reported that Fei Yi, hearing of this, planned to come to Juli’s aid. Geng Yan then strictly ordered his army to hasten the preparation of siege equipment, publicly commanding all units that after three days they would exert all their strength to attack Juli. Secretly, he allowed the deserter to escape. The deserter informed Fei Yi of Geng Yan’s deadline. On the appointed day, Fei Yi indeed led over thirty thousand elite troops to relieve Juli. Geng Yan, delighted, said to his generals: “I prepared siege equipment to lure Fei Yi here. Now that he has come, it is exactly what I sought.” He immediately detached three thousand men to guard Juli, then led his elite troops up the hillside, seizing the heights and crushing the enemy. He then advanced to the battlefield and slew Fei Yi.

Du You said: When two armies are distant and evenly matched in strength and weakness, you may cause the enemy to traverse perilous terrain to come to you, but you should not traverse perilous terrain to go to them. You must be able to draw the enemy to you without going to them.

Mei Yaochen said: If you can make the enemy come, the enemy will be weary; if you do not go to them, you remain at ease.

Wang Zhe said: To draw the enemy is to strike the weary with ease; to be drawn by the enemy is to strike the at-ease with weariness.

He Shi said: Cause the enemy to come of their own accord.

Zhang Yu said: If you draw the enemy to battle, their strength will always be depleted; if you do not go to battle, your strength will always be full. This is the expansion of the mutual depletion and fullness of the enemy and ourselves. Geng Yan first threatened Juli to lure Fei Yi to approach. To make the enemy come of their own accord is to entice them with profit.

Cao Cao said: Entice them with profit.

Li Quan said: Entice them with profit, and the enemy will come from afar.

The Zhao general Li Mu lured the Xiongnu—this was his meaning.

Du Mu said: Li Mu greatly expanded his herds and pastures, filling the fields with people. When the Xiongnu made a minor incursion, he feigned defeat and retreated, abandoning several thousand men to them. The Chanyu, greatly pleased, led his forces to invade. Li Mu crushed them, killing one hundred thousand Xiongnu cavalry. The Chanyu fled, and for over a year dared not approach the border.

Mei Yaochen said: How can they be made to come of their own accord? Show them profit.

He Shi said: Entice them with profit to come, so that we rest while the enemy toils.

Zhang Yu said: The reason we can induce the enemy to come is simply by enticing them with profit. Li Mu feigned retreat to lure the Xiongnu, and Yang Su destroyed his chariots to entice the Göktürks—these are examples.

To prevent the enemy from coming is to harm them.

Cao Cao said: Attack where they must rush, strike where they must rescue.

Li Quan said: Harm what they urgently need, and they will abandon their pursuit of us to secure themselves.

When the Wei forces invaded Zhao’s Handan and Ye, Zhao begged Qi for aid. The Qi general Tian Ji wished to rescue Zhao, but Sun Bin said: “One who unravels a tangle does not grasp the coils; one who rescues a state does not grapple at close quarters. Strike at their vital points and exploit their weaknesses, and the situation will resolve itself. Now that the two states are locked in combat, their finest troops are exhausted abroad while their infirm and elderly languish within. If we strike at their weakness, they will abandon their siege and rush to defend, which is what we mean by ‘in one move preserving Zhao and exhausting Wei.’” Later, the Wei forces indeed abandoned Zhao and hastened to Daliang, where they encountered the Qi army at Maling and suffered a crushing defeat.

Du Mu said: When Cao Cao attacked Hebei, his army halted at Dunqiu while the Black Mountain bandit Yu Du attacked Wuyang. Cao Cao then led his troops west into the mountains to strike Yu Du’s main camp. Hearing this, Yu Du abandoned Wuyang and turned back, only for Cao Cao to intercept and decisively defeat him.

Chen Hao said: This is like Wu Zixu exhausting the Chu forces or Sun Bin outmaneuvering the Wei general.

Du You said: Compel them to run where they must, attack where they must rescue, and hold the critical choke points of peril—then the enemy cannot come of their own accord. Thus the saying of the King’s Son: “One cat at the burrow, and ten thousand mice dare not emerge; one tiger at the ford, and ten thousand deer dare not cross.”

Mei Yaochen said: To prevent the enemy from coming, one must restrain them with harm.

Wang Zhe said: Present them with harm, and the enemy, fearing it, will not approach.

Zhang Yu said: The reason we can prevent the enemy from coming is by harming what they cherish. Sun Bin’s direct march on Daliang to relieve the siege of Handan and Ye is an example.

Thus, if the enemy is at rest, we can weary them.

Cao Cao said: Burden them with tasks.

Li Quan said: Attack where they least expect, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in hasty maneuvers.

Du Mu said: Gao Lei presented his strategy for pacifying Chen to Emperor Wen of Sui: “The land north of the Yangtze is cold, and its harvests come late; south of the river, the soil is warm, and the water fields ripen early. Time your mobilization to coincide with their harvest season, and raise the alarm of an impending raid. They will muster troops to defend, thus losing their farming season. Once they have gathered their forces, we will stand down. This will begin to afflict the Chen.”

Mei Yaochen said: Harass them so they cannot rest.

Wang Zhe said: Outmaneuver them with skill.

He Shi said: During the Spring and Autumn period, King Helü of Wu asked Wu Zixu: “How should we attack Chu?” Wu Zixu replied: “Chu’s government is overstaffed, with no one willing to rest. Deploy three armies to harass them: when one arrives, they will all sally forth; when that one withdraws, another will advance. As they rush back and forth, they will wear themselves out. Harass them repeatedly to exhaust them, confuse them with multiple feints, and once they are spent, follow with the full force of the three armies—then you will surely prevail.” Helü followed his advice, and Chu began to falter. Wu then entered Ying.

Zhang Yu said: This is the method of “confusing them with multiple feints” to prevent them from resting.

Some say: If the enemy occupies the battlefield first and awaits us, then they are at rest, and we should not engage them. If we do not advance, they will come to us, thus turning their rest into toil.

If the enemy is well-fed, we can starve them.

Cao Cao said: Cut off their supply lines to starve them.

Li Quan said: Burn their stores, scorch their crops, and sever their supply routes.

Du Mu said: If we are the defenders and the enemy the invaders, we can cut off their supply lines to starve them. But if we are the invaders and they the defenders, how should we proceed? Answer: Starving the enemy is not limited to cutting supply lines—any means that achieves this end suffices.

Gao Lei’s strategy for pacifying Chen stated: “The soil south of the Yangtze is poor, and dwellings are mostly thatched with bamboo. Their stores are not secure. Secretly dispatch men to set fires when the wind rises, and once the enemy rebuilds, burn them again. Within a few years, their resources and strength will be depleted.” This strategy was implemented, and the Chen grew increasingly distressed.

During the Three Kingdoms period, when Zhuge Dan and Wen Qin occupied Shouchun and sought aid from Wu, Sima Jingwang campaigned against them. He told his generals: “They may attempt to break the siege, staking everything on a single morning’s battle, or they may believe our army cannot endure long, reducing rations to await developments. I judge their intentions to lie in one of these two. We must confuse them with multiple feints.” He then ordered the encirclement tightened and sent emaciated troops to forage north of the Huai, each soldier carrying only three sheng of beans. When Dan and Qin heard this, they rejoiced. Jingwang further exaggerated his army’s weakness, and Dan and his allies grew complacent in their consumption. Soon the city’s grain ran out, and it was taken by storm.

At the end of the Sui dynasty, Yuwen Huaji led his forces to attack Li Mi at Liyang. Knowing Huaji’s supplies were scant, Li Mi feigned a truce to exhaust his troops. Huaji was overjoyed, allowing his soldiers to consume freely in hopes that Li Mi would provide. When their provisions were exhausted, his generals Wang Zhilüe and Zhang Tongren led their troops to defect to Li Mi, one after another. Huaji was thus defeated.

Chen Hao said: Starving the enemy depends on seizing opportunities as they arise.

Mei Yaochen said: Cut off their supplies so they cannot sustain themselves.

Wang Zhe said: If the enemy is well-provisioned, we must render them hungry and depleted.

Cao Cao said: Sever their supply lines.

Wang Zhe added: Burning their stores also achieves this.

He Shi said: When Wu and Chu rebelled, Zhou Yafu said: “The Chu troops are swift and impetuous.”

It is difficult to contend with them at their peak; it is better to yield Liang to them, cut off their supply lines, and thus bring them under control.

When Zhou Yafu mustered his troops at Rongyang, Wu attacked Liang, and Liang urgently requested reinforcements. Yafu led his army northeast to Changyi, fortified his camp, and sent light cavalry under the Marquis of Gonggao to sever the Wu and Chu forces’ supply lines. Deprived of provisions, the enemy grew hungry and sought to retreat. Though they repeatedly challenged Yafu to battle, he refused to engage, and they eventually withdrew. Yafu then dispatched his elite troops in pursuit and crushed them.

At the end of Wang Mang’s reign, when the realm was in chaos, Emperor Guangwu’s elder brother, Bo Sheng, raised troops to punish Mang but was defeated by Mang’s generals Zhen Fu and Liangqiu Ci. Regathering his forces, he retreated to Jiyang for defense. Fu and Ci, emboldened by victory, left their baggage train at Lanxiang and led over a hundred thousand elite troops south across the river, encamping between two mountains with their backs to the Bishui. They destroyed the bridge behind them, signaling their resolve to fight to the death. Bo Sheng then feasted his soldiers, swore oaths, and rested his troops for three days. Dividing his army into six divisions, he launched a night attack on Lanxiang, seizing all their supplies. At dawn, he attacked Zhen Fu from the south while the Xiajiang troops struck Liangqiu Ci from the southeast. Deprived of food and trapped in disarray, they slew Fu and Ci.

During the Tang, the rebel Fu Gongyou dispatched his false generals Feng Huiliang and Chen Dangshi to station their naval forces at Bowang Mountain, while Chen Zhengtong and the Prince of Hejian, Wang Xiaogong, led infantry and cavalry to Qingzhou Mountain. When the Prince of Hejian, Wang Xiaogong, arrived, he fortified his camp and refused battle, instead sending elite troops to cut off the rebels’ supply lines. As the rebels grew increasingly famished, they launched a night assault on Xiaogong’s camp, but he remained unmoved. The next day, he sent a feigned weak force to attack their ramparts, while Lu Zushang arrayed elite cavalry in ambush. Soon, the attacking force feigned retreat, and when the rebels pursued for several *li*, they encountered Zushang’s troops and were routed. Zhengtong abandoned his camp and fled.

Zhang Yu said: If we strike first, we become the guest, and they the host; as guests, our supplies are insufficient, but as hosts, they are more than ample. If we seize their stores, plunder their fields, draw provisions from them, and quarter our troops in enemy territory, we will be well-fed while they starve. Thus, we transform from guest to host. Without burning their supplies or disrupting their farming, we cannot starve the enemy. If they are the guests, we must sever their supply lines—this is what the Lord of Guangwu intended when he proposed sending elite troops to cut off Han Xin’s rear. How could they not be moved to action?

Cao Cao said: Attack what they cherish, strike where they must rush, and they will have no choice but to come to its defense.

Li Jing said: Strike where they must rush, attack where they least expect, assail what they hold dear, and they will have no choice but to rescue it.

Du Mu said: When Sima Xuanwang attacked Gongsun Wenyi in the east of Liaodong, Wenyi blocked the Liao River to repel the Wei forces. Xuanwang said: “The rebels fortify their camp and raise high ramparts to wear down our army. To attack them is to fall into their trap. The ancients said: ‘Though the enemy fortifies their camp, they cannot but engage us if we attack what they must rescue.’ Now, if we march straight for Xiangping, their forces will be gripped by fear and seek battle—then we shall surely crush them.” He then advanced in battle formation. Seeing the Wei troops emerge behind them, the rebels indeed came to intercept; Xuanwang launched a full assault and routed them, ultimately pacifying the east of Liaodong.

Chen Hao said: When Chu attacked Song, Song appealed to Jin for aid. Xian Zhen of Jin said: “If we seize the lord of Cao and distribute the lands of Cao and Wei to the people of Song, Chu cherishes Cao and Wei and will not consent. Joy and anger will clash—how can they not fight?” Thus, they defeated the Chu forces. Meng’s commentary aligns with Cao Cao’s.

Mei Yaochen said: Rush toward what they cherish, and they cannot remain still.

Wang Zhe’s commentary aligns with Li Jing’s.

He Shi said: Attack what they love—how can they remain unmoved?

Zhang Yu said: If the enemy is entrenched, believing themselves secure, and unwilling to engage quickly, we must attack what they must rescue, forcing them to emerge. When Xi Pian fortified his camp, the Earl of Qin provoked his subordinate generals, and they all sallied forth to battle—this is such a case. Strike where they do not expect, rush where they do not anticipate.

Cao Cao said: Thus, the enemy cannot come to each other’s aid.

He Shi said: Now, if the enemy must respond to us, marching a thousand *li* without fatigue is achieved by advancing through unoccupied land.

Cao Cao said: Strike the empty and the weak, avoid their defenses, and attack where they do not expect.

Li Jing said: Strike where the enemy is unprepared, advance through the solitary to attack the weak—what resistance can they offer?

Du Mu said: During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Liang, when Western Shu declared itself an empire and marched east to attack Yuan, the Western Wei general Zhou Wendi said: “To pacify Shu and subdue Liang—this is the moment.” Many of his generals disagreed. Wendi asked General Yuchi Jiong: “I entrust the campaign against Shu entirely to you—what is your plan?” Jiong replied: “Shu has been isolated from the Central Plains for over a hundred years, relying on its mountainous terrain and never expecting our army’s arrival. We should dispatch elite cavalry in a swift night raid. On level ground, advance at double speed; on difficult terrain, proceed cautiously. Strike where they do not expect, pierce their heart, and their defenses will collapse like wind-blown leaves.” Thus, Shu was pacified. The phrase “without fatigue” refers to advancing through empty land, where no enemy is expected, and movement is at our discretion—hence, no fatigue.

Chen Hao said: The term “empty and weak” does not merely mean the enemy is unprepared. Even if they are prepared, if their defenses are lax, their camp insecure, their generals weak, their troops disordered, their provisions scant, and their position isolated, when we advance with disciplined forces, they will collapse at the mere sight of our banners. Thus, we suffer no hardship, as if marching through uninhabited land.

Mei Yaochen said: Strike where they do not expect.

He Shi said: When Cao Cao marched north to campaign against the Wuhuan, his strategist Guo Jia advised: “In warfare, speed is paramount. Now, to strike a thousand *li* away with a ponderous baggage train would make it difficult to seize the advantage. Moreover, if the enemy learns of our approach, they will have time to prepare. It would be better to leave the baggage behind, advance with light forces at double speed, and take them by surprise.” Cao Cao then secretly emerged from Lulong Pass and marched straight for the chanyu’s court. The barbarians, suddenly hearing of his arrival, panicked and engaged in battle, only to be utterly routed. Even their chanyu and tribal chieftains were slain. Later, when the Tuyuhun raided the frontier, Emperor Taizong appointed Li Jing as Grand Chief Commander of the Western Sea Route. With a light force, he traversed two thousand *li* of empty land, pacified the Tuyuhun, and returned. Thus, Taizong remarked: “Moreover, Li Jing’s three thousand light cavalry penetrated deep into the barbarian court, recaptured and secured Dingxiang—such a feat is unmatched in ancient or modern times.”

Zhang Yu said: Seize their emptiness, strike their unpreparedness—even a thousand-*li* march will not weary the men. As when Deng Ai conquered Shu by taking the Yinping route, traversing over seven hundred *li* of uninhabited land. To attack and surely take is to strike where they do not defend.

Li Quan said: Where there is no vigilance, conquest is easy.

Du Mu said: Feint an attack on their east, strike their west; lure them forward, then raid their rear. During the Later Han, when Zhang Bu, governor of Ju, stationed his brother Lan at Xi’an and another general at Linzi—forty *li* from Linzi—Geng Bing encamped his forces between them. Observing that Xi’an’s walls were small but sturdy and Lan’s troops well-trained, while Linzi, though nominally larger, was in fact vulnerable, Bing ordered his officers to prepare siege equipment. Five days later, he launched an assault on Xi’an, then released prisoners to spread word. Hearing this, Lan kept watch day and night. On the appointed day, at midnight, Bing ordered his generals to eat their fill. By dawn, they had reached Linzi’s walls. His adjutant, Gou Liang, and others urged an immediate attack on Xi’an, but Bing replied: “Xi’an has heard of our intent and prepared day and night. Linzi, taken by surprise, will be thrown into chaos. If we strike now, we can take it in a single day. Once Linzi falls, Xi’an will be isolated—this is what we call striking one to gain two.” His plan unfolded exactly as foreseen.

Late in the Later Han, Zhu Jun attacked the Yellow Turban leader Han Zhong at Wan. Jun constructed a long siege wall and raised earthen mounds to overlook the city. Then, sounding drums, he feigned an assault on the southwest. The rebels rushed their entire force to meet it, whereupon Jun led five thousand elite troops to raid the northeast, scaling the walls and entering the city. Zhong retreated to the inner citadel, terrified, and begged to surrender.

Chen Hao said: When the state campaigned against Shangdang, Wang Zai knew that Liu Qi relied on the natural barrier of Tianjing Pass and had made no preparations for a stout defense. Zai concentrated his forces to seize and hold it, depriving Qi of his advantage and ultimately collapsing his stronghold.

Mei Yaochen said: Feign an attack on the south, but strike the north.

Wang Zhe said: Strike their emptiness—where the general is incompetent, the troops untrained, the ramparts weak, the defenses lax, relief slow, provisions scant, and morale divided.

Zhang Yu said: A master of attack moves as if from the nine heavens, leaving the enemy no time to prepare. With no time to prepare, what we strike is precisely where they do not defend. Geng Bing’s conquest of Linzi and Zhu Jun’s suppression of the Yellow Turbans are but two examples.

To defend and surely hold is to defend where they do not attack.

Du Mu said: If they do not attack, we still defend—how much more so where they do?

When the Han Grand Commandant Zhou Yafu campaigned against the Seven Kingdoms at Changyi, the rebels rushed to fortify the southeast corner of the ramparts. Yafu ordered his men to prepare for an assault on the northwest. Soon after, the rebels’ elite troops attacked the northwest but failed to breach it, then fled in disarray. Yafu pursued and crushed them.

Chen Hao said: Do not worry that the enemy will not attack—worry that we will not defend. To be prepared for attack from any quarter and to defend every point is the essence of military readiness.

Mei Yaochen said: If the enemy strikes our west, we must also prepare for the east.

Wang Zhe said: Defend with substance—where the general is capable, the troops well-trained, the ramparts strong, the defenses strict, relief swift, provisions ample, and morale unified.

Zhang Yu said: A master of defense hides as if beneath the nine earths, leaving the enemy no way to gauge their intent. With no way to gauge, what we defend is precisely where they do not attack. Zhou Yafu’s preparation for the northwest while the enemy struck the southeast is but one example.

Thus, the master of attack leaves the enemy uncertain of where to defend; the master of defense leaves the enemy uncertain of where to attack.

Cao Cao said: The situation must not be leaked.

Li Quan said: A master of attack possesses abundant weaponry—Gao Huan of Eastern Wei’s assault on Ye is an example. A master of defense? It lies in thorough preparation—Wei Xiaokuan’s defense of Jinzhou is another.

Du Mu said: The intentions of attack and defense must not be revealed.

Jia Lin said: When commands are obeyed, hearts are united, and defenses are solid, subtle and formless, the enemy hesitates, their strategies left in disarray.

Mei Yaochen said: A master of attack keeps their plans secret; a master of defense leaves no gaps.

Wang Zhe said: A master of attack waits for the enemy’s exploitable weakness, strikes swiftly, and thus prevents them from defending. A master of defense constantly ensures invulnerability, thus preventing the enemy from attacking. "Uncertainty" means the enemy cannot discern the source of attack or defense.

He Shi said: The strategies of attack and defense must be made unfathomable.

Zhang Yu said: In defense, one appears insufficient; in attack, one appears abundant. This "insufficiency" is not true weakness but a feint to provoke the enemy’s assault—this is how the enemy remains uncertain of where to attack. This "abundance" is not true strength but a display to make the enemy retreat into defense—this is how the enemy remains uncertain of where to defend. When intentions are not leaked, they accumulate into the essence of attack and defense. Subtle, oh so subtle, to the point of formlessness; divine, oh so divine, to the point of soundlessness—thus one becomes the arbiter of the enemy’s fate.

Li Quan said: The dual arts of attack and defense employ the orthodox and the extraordinary, their subtleties and wonders beyond verbal expression. So profound and wondrous that the enemy’s life and death hang upon my designs—hence, the arbiter of fate.

Du Mu said: Subtlety lies in stillness; divinity lies in motion. Stillness governs defense; motion governs attack. The enemy’s life and death rest entirely in my hands—thus, like the celestial arbiter of fate.

Du You said: Their subtleties are invisible. Their transformations are swift as spirits, enabling them to foresee the enemy’s fate as if by celestial decree.

Mei Yaochen said: Formless, their secrets cannot be glimpsed; soundless, their swiftness cannot be perceived.

Wang Zhe said: Secrets are hard to discern; swiftness is hard to counter—thus one controls the enemy’s fate.

He Shi said: The military treatise’s methods of emptiness and fullness reach their pinnacle in the divine and subtle, where ultimate success is achieved. My fullness is made to appear empty to the enemy; my emptiness is made to appear full. The enemy’s fullness, I can render empty; the enemy’s emptiness, I can discern as false. For the enemy cannot grasp my emptiness or fullness, while I can accurately assess theirs. When I wish to attack, I know their defended points are full and their undefended points are empty. I avoid their strength, strike their weakness, target their vulnerabilities, and exploit their gaps. When the enemy wishes to attack me, I know their targets are non-essential while their neglected points are critical. I display emptiness to the enemy while concealing my fullness. If they feint east, I prepare in the west. Thus, when I attack, they know not where to defend; when I defend, they know not where to attack. The transformations of attack and defense arise from the principles of emptiness and fullness. Sometimes hiding beneath the nine earths to signify defense; sometimes moving above the nine heavens to symbolize attack. Erasing traces to remain unseen, muffling sounds to remain unheard—emerging as if from the earth, vanishing as if into the sky, swift as meteors, stealthy as ghosts, penetrating the realm of no gaps, circling the abyss of the nine springs. So subtle as to be imperceptible, so divine as to be inaudible. Even the keenest eyes cannot perceive their form; the sharpest ears cannot detect their sound. The tangible becomes formless; the audible becomes soundless. Not that they lack form or sound, but that the enemy cannot perceive or hear them. The ultimate transformation of emptiness and fullness.

A master of defense understands the interplay of emptiness and fullness, thus entering the profound mysteries of the divine and subtle. The unskilled, however, rigidly pursue subtlety and divinity, clinging to the traces of warfare. Unable to erase form and sound, they remain within the realm of perception—failing to grasp the wonders of the divine and subtle, which lie in the interplay of emptiness and fullness. Even with a vast army of a million, how can there be no form or sound? It is merely that the enemy cannot perceive or hear them.

Zhang Yu said: The strategies of attack and defense, subtle and divine, reach such perfection that no form can be observed, no sound can be heard. Thus, the enemy’s life and death lie entirely in my hands. Advancing, they cannot be resisted—because I strike their emptiness. Retreating, they cannot be pursued—because I am swift and unreachable.

Cao Cao said: Swiftly advance to attack their emptiness and laxity; retreat with equal speed.

Li Quan said: Advancing means exploiting gaps and laxity; retreating means sending supplies ahead, moving far before the main army withdraws—thus making pursuit impossible. When Shi Le of Later Zhao was encamped at Gebei, plagued by rain and planning to return to Ye, he feared Jin forces would pursue. Following Zhang Bin’s advice, he sent supplies ahead, making them unreachable—this is what Quan means by "swift" as "distant."

Du Mu said: Having attacked their emptiness, the enemy is defeated. After defeat, how can they pursue me? Thus, I can retreat swiftly.

Chen Hao said: Du’s interpretation is incorrect. When Cao Cao besieged Zhang Xiu, the city remained unbreached, and his forces unexhausted—yet he departed. Zhang Xiu’s troops pursued, and Jia Xu urged him to stop. Xiu refused and was indeed defeated by Cao.

Jia Xu said to Zhang Xiu: "Since you could foresee their defeat, you should also be able to foresee their victory." Xu replied: "Then send the defeated troops to ambush them again." Xiu followed his advice, and Cao Cao was indeed defeated. How could it be that after suffering defeat, the enemy cannot pursue? Rather, it means advancing by exploiting their emptiness, so the enemy does not know what to defend; retreating while chasing advantage, so the enemy does not know what to pursue.

Du You said: "The divine seizes their emptiness and void."

Mei Yaochen said: "Advancing by exploiting their emptiness, none can resist me; retreating by taking advantage of their exhaustion, none can pursue me."

He Shi said: "When the army advances, it strikes at emptiness; when it retreats, it gains by speed. I can control the enemy, but the enemy cannot control me."

Zhang Yu said: "When facing each other across the lines, if you see the enemy’s gaps and swiftly advance to strike, how can they resist? Having gained advantage and retreated, swiftly returning to fortify your defenses, how can they pursue? The nature of warfare values speed—swift as wind and lightning, so the enemy cannot control it. Thus, if I wish to fight, even if the enemy has high ramparts and deep moats, they cannot but engage me, for I attack what they must rescue. As Cao Cao and Li Quan said: cut off their supply lines, guard their retreat routes, and attack their ruler. Du Mu said: If I am the host and the enemy the guest, cut off their provisions and guard their retreat. If I am the guest and the enemy the host, attack their ruler. When Sima Xuanwang attacked Liaodong, he marched straight for Xiangping—this is the principle. Mei Yaochen said: Attack their vital points. Wang Zhe said: Cao Cao said: Cut off their supply lines, guard their retreat routes, and attack their ruler. I say: If the enemy holds firm, simply attack what they must rescue, and they will engage me. For example, when Geng Yan wished to attack Juli to lure Fei Yi is the same principle. He Shi said: When the Wei general Sima Xuanwang campaigned against Gongsun Wenyi, he secretly crossed the Liao River by boat, built long siege walls, then suddenly abandoned the enemy and marched toward Xiangping. His generals said: Not attacking the enemy but building long walls does not show our strength to the masses. Xuanwang replied: The enemy has fortified camps and high ramparts, intending to wear down our troops. The ancients said: Even if the enemy has high ramparts, they cannot but engage me if I attack what they must rescue. The enemy’s main force is here, so their lair is empty. I march straight for Xiangping, and the enemy will be seized by inner fear. Fearful, they will seek battle, and their defeat is certain. He then ordered the army to advance in formation. Seeing the troops emerge behind them, the enemy indeed intercepted them."

Xuanwang addressed his generals: "The reason we did not attack their camp was precisely to bring about this outcome—we must not let this opportunity slip." He then unleashed his troops to meet the enemy head-on, crushing them decisively and securing victory in three successive battles.

When Ma Sui campaigned against Tian Yue, his forces were few, and Yue entrenched himself deeply, refusing battle. Sui ordered his armies to carry ten days’ rations and advanced to Cangkou, where they encamped across the Wen River from Yue’s forces. Li Baozhen and Li You questioned him: "With so little grain, why press so deep?" Sui replied: "Scant supplies favor swift battle. The art of war excels in drawing the enemy to us, not in being drawn by them. Now, Tian Yue and the armies of Zi, Qing, and Yan form a chain, intending to wear us down without fighting. If we divide our forces to strike their flanks, our numbers will be too few to break them, and Yue will come to their aid—leaving us caught between two fronts. As the military classics say: *Attack what the enemy must rescue*, and they will be compelled to fight." Sui thus united his armies and crushed them.

He then constructed three bridges to cross the Wen River, provoking battle daily, yet Yue dared not emerge. However, the troops of Ze Prefecture, fearing absorption by Sui’s smaller force, withdrew to join Yue. The next day, as Yue and Sui exchanged taunts, Yue concealed ten thousand soldiers in ambush, intending to intercept Sui. Sui ordered his armies to eat before midnight, then at the first crow of the cock, they sounded drums and horns, stealthily marching along the Wen River toward Weizhou. He commanded: "When you hear the enemy approach, halt and form ranks." He also dispatched a hundred cavalry with drums and horns to remain behind, carrying bundles of firewood. Once the main force had departed, they ceased their clamor, concealed themselves, and waited for Yue’s army to cross before burning the bridges.

After marching ten *li*, Yue led over forty thousand infantry and cavalry from Zi, Qing, and Yan Prefectures, crossing the bridges to strike Sui’s rear. A wind rose, and they set fires, advancing with war cries. Sui, clad in armor, ordered his troops to hold fast, then commanded the vanguard to clear a hundred paces of grass and brambles for a battle line. He recruited five thousand valiant men to form the front ranks, awaiting the enemy’s arrival. By the time Yue’s forces arrived, their fires had burned out, their *qi* was spent, and their strength waned. Sui unleashed his troops, and Yue’s army collapsed. Yue fled to the bridges, but they had already been burned. His forces plunged into the river in chaos; twenty thousand were beheaded, and the armies of Zi and Qing were nearly annihilated.

Zhang Yu remarked: "When I am the invader and the enemy the defender, my troops are strong but provisions few, while their position is weak but grain abundant—then swift battle is advantageous. Though the enemy may have ramparts of metal and moats of boiling water, they cannot hold their ground but must come to fight me, for I strike at what they cherish, forcing them to rescue it. When the Chu besieged Song, the Jin prepared to relieve it. Hu Yan said: ‘Chu has just taken Cao and newly wed into Wei; if we attack Cao and Wei, Chu must rescue them, and Song will be spared.’ The plan was followed, and the siege lifted. Likewise, when Jin’s Emperor Xuan campaigned against Gongsun Wenyi, he suddenly abandoned the enemy and marched on Xiangping, striking at their lair. The enemy indeed emerged to intercept him, and he met them head-on, winning three battles in succession—this follows the same principle.

When I do not wish to fight, I mark the ground and hold it. Cao Cao said: 'An army should not be overburdened.' Li Quan said: 'This means defending one’s borders.' If entering enemy territory, employ the *Tianyi Dunjia* method of the Perfected One, closing the Six *Wu* by drawing a blade to mark the camp.' Meng Shi said: 'Marking the ground with objects to hold it illustrates its ease. For if I can thwart the enemy’s intentions, they will not dare approach.' That the enemy cannot engage me in battle is because I thwart their aims. Cao Cao said: '*Guai* means to thwart. Thwart their path, display advantages and harms, and make the enemy hesitate.' Li Quan said: '*Guai* means divergence. Deploying strange tactics to sow doubt prevents the enemy from engaging me.' When Han’s Governor of Shanggu, Li Guang, loosed his horses and removed his saddles, it was to create doubt. Du Mu said: 'If the enemy attacks me and I do not fight, I employ deceptions to confuse them, making their resolve diverge from their initial purpose, so they dare not engage me.'

When Cao Cao contended for Hanzhong, the First Ruler of Shu resisted him. General Zhao Yun, guarding a separate encampment, rode out lightly with a few dozen cavalry and suddenly encountered Cao’s main force. Yun retreated while skirmishing. Cao’s army pursued and surrounded him. Upon reaching his camp, Yun flung open the gates, stilled the banners, and silenced the drums. Cao’s forces suspected an ambush and withdrew. When Zhuge Liang encamped at Yangping, he sent Wei Yan and other generals east with the bulk of the army, leaving only ten thousand men to hold the city. A scout reported to Sima Yi: 'Liang is in the city with few troops and weak strength.' The officers paled, but Liang remained composed. He ordered the army to lower all banners and silence the drums, forbade anyone to venture out, and had the four gates swept and sprinkled with water. Yi suspected an ambush and led his forces away, hastening toward the northern mountains. Liang told his advisors: 'Sima Yi thought I had set an ambush and fled along the mountains.' Yi later learned of this and deeply regretted it.

When Cao Cao clashed with Lü Bu, Cao’s army went out to harvest wheat, and Bu suddenly arrived with his forces. Cao’s camp had only a thousand men arrayed for battle, half concealed behind a dike. Bu hesitated, unwilling to advance, saying: 'Cao Cao is full of tricks—do not fall into an ambush.' He then withdrew his troops. Chen Hao said: 'In the *Zuozhuan*, when Chu’s Prime Minister Ziyuan attacked Zheng, he entered through the Pure Gate and reached the Distant Market, but the portcullis remained raised. Ziyuan said: “There are men here.” And so he retreated.' Jia Lin said: 'Place decoy troops where the enemy fears, encamp in terrain of strategic advantage—though you have not dug trenches or raised ramparts, the enemy will not dare attack.' Mei Yaochen said: 'Marking the ground illustrates ease. Thwart their path and display advantages to make them hesitate and dare not advance.'"

King Wei swore: "Marking the ground signifies ease, and moreover, it clearly demonstrates that control of the command bell follows the Dao."

Zhang Yu said: "When I am the host and the enemy the guest, with my provisions plentiful and my troops few, while their food is scarce and their soldiers numerous, it is advantageous not to engage in battle. Though we do not fortify our camp with ramparts, the enemy will not dare to attack us—this is achieved by displaying deceptive formations and thwarting their intended path. As when the men of Chu attacked Zheng, and Zheng left its portcullis raised, the valiant Chu forces spoke and withdrew, and the Chu army dared not advance but fled. Again, when Sima Yi besieged Zhuge Liang, Liang furled his banners and beat his drums outside, opening his gates and sweeping the ground. Yi, suspecting an ambush, led his troops away. This is the same principle. Thus, if you reveal the enemy’s form while remaining formless yourself, you concentrate your strength while the enemy disperses theirs."

Du You said: "I remain unified while the enemy scatters."

Mei Yaochen said: "When others have form and I remain unseen, the enemy must divide their forces to guard against me."

Zhang Yu said: "Make my orthodox forces appear unorthodox to the enemy, and my unorthodox forces appear orthodox—this is revealing the enemy’s form. By turning the unorthodox into the orthodox and the orthodox into the unorthodox, shifting endlessly, you render the enemy unable to discern your true form. Once the enemy’s form is revealed, I then concentrate my forces to confront them. If my form remains concealed, the enemy must divide their strength to prepare defenses. I am unified as one, while the enemy is split into ten—thus, I attack with ten against their one."

Du You said: "When I discern the enemy’s form and assess their emptiness or fullness, my preparations are few, and I remain concentrated in one place. With my unity, I strike their scattered troops—this is ten attacking one."

Mei Yaochen said: "Dividing one into ten, I always strike one part with tenfold force. Thus, I am many and the enemy few."

Du You said: "I am unified as one, hence many; the enemy is divided into ten, hence few."

Zhang Yu said: "Seeing the enemy’s emptiness or fullness, I need not prepare extensively, so I remain concentrated in one place. The enemy, unable to perceive my form, divides into ten. Thus, my ten strike their one. Therefore, I cannot but be many, and the enemy cannot but be few. He who can strike the few with the many engages only a limited force in battle."

Du Mu said: "Limited, meaning few. I dig deep trenches and raise high ramparts, erase my tracks and conceal my sounds, moving without form, attacking and seizing unpredictably. Sometimes with light cavalry and swift horses, I strike their vulnerabilities; sometimes with strong crossbows and longbows, I seize their critical points. I harass their left and tread upon their right, charge their rear and startle their front. By day, I confuse them with banners; by night, I bewilder them with drums. Thus, the enemy, fearful, divides their forces to guard against threats. It is like gazing down from a mountain upon a city, or observing the outside from behind a curtain—the enemy’s dispersed formations are all known to me, while my strategies of attack and defense remain hidden from them. Thus, I am unified, and the enemy is divided. Unity makes strength complete; division makes strength weak. Striking the weak with the complete ensures victory."

Du You said: "This means few are easily overcome."

Mei Yaochen said: "Striking the divided with the unified means I face only a few."

Wang Zhe said: "Create many deceptive forms to make the enemy prepare against them, while my actual attack remains unguarded—thus, I am unified and the enemy divided. Unified is many; divided is few. 'Ten attack one' is a general statement."

He Shi echoed Du Mu’s annotation.

Zhang Yu said: "When force is concentrated, it is strong; when troops are scattered, they are weak. Striking weak and scattered forces with a strong and concentrated host means expending little effort for great success. The place where I engage in battle must remain unknown."

Du You said: "My movements are subtle and concealed, my intentions unseen. The enemy may know where I emerge but not where I strike; they may know where I strike but not where I gather."

Zhang Yu said: "This is because my form is invisible. If it is unknown, the enemy must prepare in many places."

Mei Yaochen said: "If the enemy does not know, they prepare everywhere."

Cao Cao said: "Concealing form makes the enemy suspicious, so they divide their forces to guard against me. This means few are easily struck."

Wang Zhe said: "The place where I engage the enemy must not be known to them; if known, they will concentrate their strength to resist me."

Cao Cao said: "Concealing form makes the enemy suspicious."

Zhang Yu said: "Unable to predict where my chariots will emerge, where my cavalry will come from, or from which direction my infantry will advance, the enemy divides their forces to prepare everywhere. Thus, their troops become scattered and weak, their power divided and diminished. Therefore, where I engage, I confront their isolated forces with my full strength. Thus, preparing in front leaves the rear weak; preparing in the rear leaves the front weak; preparing on the left leaves the right weak; preparing on the right leaves the left weak. Preparing everywhere leaves everything weak."

Du You said: "When the enemy prepares in many places, their soldiers are inevitably dispersed and few."

Mei Yaochen said: "Wherever they prepare, they are weak."

The few are those who prepare against others; the many are those who make others prepare against them.

Cao Cao said: "As stated earlier, concealing form makes the enemy suspicious, so they divide their forces to guard against me."

Li Quan said: "The place where you array your troops must not be known to the enemy. If they suspect, they will believe your forces are divided and prepare against you."

Du Mu said: "The place where you engage in battle must not be known to the enemy. If my form remains concealed, the enemy will not know my left or right, front or rear, near or far, perilous or secure terrain. They will not know where I will attack or where we will meet in battle. Thus, they divide their troops to defend everywhere. Concealing form makes many; division makes few. Therefore, the many will win, and the few will lose."

Meng Shi said: "Preparing against others scatters me; preparing against me divides them."

Du You said: "When the enemy is scattered and few, it is because they have prepared against others first. When the enemy must prepare extensively against me, it is because I am concentrated and numerous." Mei Yaochen said: "The more the enemy prepares, the fewer they become." Wang Xi said: "When they prepare in all directions—left, right, front, and rear—they are few in every direction." He Shi agreed with the various commentaries.

Zhang Yu said: "When there is no place left unprepared—left, right, front, and rear—then there is no place where their troops are not few. The reason they are few is that their forces are divided and widely dispersed to prepare against others. The reason we are numerous is that our strength is concentrated, forcing others to prepare against us. Thus, if one knows the place of battle and the day of battle, one may march a thousand *li* to meet the enemy in combat."

Cao Cao said: "By measuring and assessing, one knows the emptiness and the day of engagement." Li Quan said: "Knowing the place of battle determines the convenience of boats, chariots, infantry, and cavalry." When the Martial Lord [Cao Cao] had not yet pacified the northern lands, he abandoned saddles and horses and relied on boats and oars to contend with Wu and Yue for supremacy—thus he suffered defeat at the hands of Huang Gai. When King Fuchai of Wu hastily drove the forces of Wu and Chu to gallop between Liang and Zheng, this was a case of not knowing the place or day of battle. Therefore, the *Taiyi Dunjia* states: "By calculating the three gates and five generals, the outcome of host and guest can be known." Thus, one may march a thousand *li* to meet the enemy and prevail.

Du Mu said: "When Emperor Wu of Song sent Zhu Lingshi to campaign against Qiao Zong in Shu, the emperor said: 'In previous years, Liu Jingxuan advanced via the inner waters toward Huangwu but withdrew without success. The enemy now expects that if we come again, we will follow the outer waters, yet they suspect we may still take them by surprise and come via the inner waters. Thus, they will surely station heavy troops at Fucheng to guard the inner route. If we advance toward Huangwu, we will fall into their trap. Now, with our main force, we will take Chengdu from the outer waters while sending a feint toward the inner waters—this will be an unexpected maneuver to control the enemy.' Fearing that this plan might leak in advance and the enemy would discern the truth, he sealed the full orders in a letter and entrusted it to Lingshi. On the edge of the letter, he wrote: 'Open only upon reaching Baidi.' None of the armies knew the disposition of forces. Upon reaching Baidi, the letter was opened, revealing: 'All forces shall take Chengdu via the outer waters. Zang Xi and Zhu Lin shall take Guanghan via the middle waters. Send a few weak troops aboard tall ships via the inner waters toward Huangwu.' Qiao Zong indeed stationed heavy troops to guard the inner waters, and Lingshi destroyed him."

Chen Hao said: "Du Mu’s note speaks only of knowing the place of battle, not the day. If I attack the enemy and they fail to engage me at the appointed time, or if the enemy invades me and I must prepare to respond, how can one make an agreement? When Xiang Yu told Cao Jiu, 'I will pacify Liang in fifteen days and then meet with you again,' if he did not know the appointed day of battle, how could he make such a promise?"

Meng Shi said: "By measuring and assessing emptiness, first knowing the terrain of the battlefield, and then carefully determining the day of battle, one may set a rendezvous a thousand *li* away and arrive first to await the enemy. If the enemy arrives first, one need not go to exhaust them."

Du You said: "The skilled warrior must know both the day and the place of battle. By calculating the route and setting the date, dividing the army and mixing the troops, those far away advance first, and those nearby set out later. A thousand-*li* rendezvous may be made to converge at the same time, as if meeting in a marketplace. On the day of meeting at the appointed place, do not let the enemy know. If they know, they will prepare in fewer places; if they do not know, they will prepare in many. Few preparations mean concentration; many preparations mean division. Division scatters strength; concentration unifies it."

Mei Yaochen said: "If one can determine both the place and the day of battle, even a thousand *li* away, one may set a date and engage the enemy." Wang Zhe said: "First knowing the terrain and the enemy’s situation, then using the measurements of military strategy to calculate distances, one may discern emptiness and assess where the enemy will respond and when the battle will occur. In this way, even a thousand *li* away, one may meet the enemy in battle and break them. Thus, Cao Cao’s words—'by measuring and assessing, one knows the emptiness and the day of engagement'—are correct."

Zhang Yu said: "Whenever one raises troops to attack the enemy, the place of battle must be known in advance. By the day the army arrives, one must ensure the enemy comes as scheduled to fight. Knowing the place and day of battle allows preparations to be concentrated and defenses to be firm. Even a thousand *li* away, one may advance to battle. For example, Sai Shu knew the Jin would intercept the army at Yao—this was knowing the place of battle. Chen Tang predicted the Wusun siege would be lifted in five days—this was knowing the day of battle. Another example is Sun Bin’s ambush of Pang Juan at Maling, where he calculated the time of dusk and the enemy’s arrival. Without knowing the place or day of battle, the left cannot rescue the right, the right cannot rescue the left, the front cannot rescue the rear, and the rear cannot rescue the front—how much less those tens of *li* away, or even just a few *li*?"

Du Mu said: "Guanzi said: 'To send out troops without a settled plan is to fight and destroy oneself.'" Du You said: "If the enemy has already seized advantageous terrain and I rush toward profit, desiring battle, then left, right, front, and rear will be hesitant in advance and retreat, unable to rescue one another—how much more so over ten or more *li*?" Mei Yaochen said: "Inability to rescue is due to being few. If left, right, front, and rear cannot rescue one another, how much less those far away?"

Zhang Yu said: "If one does not know where the enemy will meet the army or on what day they will engage in battle, then preparations will not be concentrated, and defenses will not be firm. If one suddenly encounters the enemy, hastily engaging them, left and right, front and rear will still be unable to aid one another—how much less those separated by great distances? By my estimation, even if the Yue people’s troops are many, what benefit will it bring to victory or defeat?"

Cao Cao said: "The Yue people gather in confusion, knowing nothing." Some say: "Wu and Yue are neighboring states." Li Quan said: "Yue means 'to exceed.' If one does not know the place or day of battle, even if one’s troops exceed others, how can one know victory or defeat?"

Chen Hao said: "Sunzi discoursed on military affairs for King Helü of Wu. As Wu and Yue were mutually pitiful, he spoke of Yue, referring to troops that exceed others—this is not righteous."

Jia Lin said: "If one does not know the battlefield or the day of battle, even with many troops, one cannot control the governance of victory or defeat—what benefit is there?"

Mei Yaochen said: "Wu and Yue were enemy states. Though the Yue people are many, they can still be divided by me to become few."

Wang Zhe said: "This is Wu appraising the enemy according to the times. Though the Yue troops are many, if they do not aid one another well, it is also of no benefit to the calculations of victory or defeat."

Zhang Yu said: "The character *wu* (吴) was mistakenly written as *wu* (吾). Wu and Yue were neighboring states, frequently invading one another, hence the following text states: 'The people of Wu and the people of Yue detest each other.' Though the troops of Yue are many, if they do not know the battlefield or the day of battle, their strength should be divided to weaken them. Thus it is said: 'Victory can be made.'"

Du Mu said: "Victory lies with me, hence it is said it can be made."

Meng Shi said: "If the enemy does not know the battlefield or the appointed day, our victory can be constant."

Mei Yaochen’s annotation agrees with Du Mu’s. Wang Shi and He Shi’s annotations agree with Meng Shi’s.

Zhang Yu said: "Victory lies with me, hence it is so. The *Xing* chapter states: 'Victory can be known but cannot be made.' Why then does it say here that victory can be made? In the *Xing* chapter, the discussion concerns the circumstances of attack and defense, stating that if the enemy is prepared, one cannot necessarily make victory. Here, however, the focus is on the Yue troops, estimating that the Yue people certainly cannot know the battlefield or the day of battle, hence it is said that victory can be made. Though the enemy is numerous, they can be made to have no gaps."

Du Mu said: "By measuring the following four matters, though the enemy’s troops are many, they can be made unable to compete with me in victory."

Meng Shi said: "Though the enemy has many troops, I can employ many deceptions, divide their formations, and prevent them from joining forces."

Jia Lin said: "Though the enemy is numerous, if they do not know my military situation, they will constantly be forced to prepare hastily and have no leisure to scheme or punish."

Mei Yaochen said: "If they can be made few, what gaps will there be?"

Wang Zhe said: "If many cannot aid one another, what can they rely on?"

Zhang Yu said: "By dispersing their strength so they cannot advance in unison, how can they contend with me? Thus, by strategizing, one knows the calculations of gain and loss."

Li Quan said: "Those who employ troops use the military methods of securing victory. The calculations of the *Taiyi Dunjia* and the Five Generals determine the numbers of encirclement and ambush—gain and loss can be known."

Meng Shi said: "By assessing the enemy’s situation and observing their actions, their calculations can be known."

Jia Lin said: "In the quiet of the command tent, through strategizing, the enemy’s gains and our losses in calculation are all known beforehand."

Du You said: "By assessing the enemy’s situation and observing their actions, their calculations can be known."

Mei Yaochen said: "Their calculations of gain and loss are known through my strategizing."

Wang Zhe said: "By assessing the enemy’s situation, the numbers of gain and loss become apparent."

Zhang Yu said: "By planning the enemy’s situation, one knows the success or failure of their calculations, as when Lord Xue appraised Jing Bu’s three strategies."

"By acting, one knows the principles of movement and stillness."

Li Quan said: "Observing cloud omens, wind and birds, and human sentiments, the principles of movement and stillness can be known. During Wang Mang’s reign, when Wang Xun campaigned against Kunyang, clouds like a collapsing mountain descended upon the camp several yards above the ground, and Guangwu knew he would surely be defeated. When Liang’s Prince Jiang Bian’s camp had clouds like a dike, Hou Jing knew he would surely prevail. Wind birds are creatures like those that eat jackals. Here, Quan takes *zuo* (作) as *hou* (候)."

Du Mu said: "*Zuo* means to provoke. By provoking the enemy to respond to me, one then observes the patterns of their movement, stillness, order, and disorder. King Wu of Wei said: 'When two armies face each other, how can one know what their generals will do?' Wu Qi replied: 'Order lowly but brave soldiers to lead the vanguard and attack, then feign defeat and retreat without punishing them. Observe the enemy’s advance and retreat, their rising and sitting—if their governance is orderly, if they do not pursue those in flight, and do not seize advantages, such a general is cunning. If they pursue in full force, their flags and banners are disordered, their movements and halts are chaotic, they covet gains and seek only to obtain them—such a general’s commands are not followed. Attack without hesitation.'"

Chen Hao said: "*Zuo* means to create. By creating advantages and harms to entice the enemy, one knows the principles of their advance and retreat."

Jia Lin said: "Those skilled in observation must know the principles of the enemy’s movement and stillness."

Du You said: "By examining their expressions of joy and anger and their actions, their sentiments and principles can be discerned. Thus, one knows the dynamics of movement and stillness and the changes for victory or defeat."

Mei Yaochen said: "The enemy’s principles of movement and stillness are revealed through what I initiate."

Wang Zhe said: "One awaits whether their principles warrant movement or not."

Zhang Yu said: "By acting over time and observing their joy and anger, the principles of their movement and stillness can be known. When Duke Wen of Jin detained Wan Chun to anger Chu’s general Ziyu, Ziyu then attacked the Jin army—this was his impetuous movement. When Zhuge Liang sent women’s headdresses to anger Sima Xuanwang, Xuanwang ultimately did not come out to fight—this was his calm stillness."

"By manifesting, one knows the terrain of life and death."

Li Quan said: "Breaking formations and setting up surprises, one may lower flags and silence drums to manifest weakness, or display empty arrays with lightning and banners to manifest strength. One casts them into death to lead them to life—thus life and death are shaped by the terrain. When Han Xin descended Jingxing and Liu Yu crossed Daxian, this was the principle."

Du Mu said: "The terrain of life and death refers to the battlefield. Casting them into death leads to life; placing them in life leads to death."

"I speak of employing manifold deceptions to harass the enemy, observing their responses to my maneuvers, then adapting accordingly—thus the terrain of life and death becomes known.

Chen Hao said: Once the enemy shows movement or stillness, I perceive their configuration. Those with strategy occupy ground that ensures life; those without strategy are cast into ground that seals death.

Meng Shi said: By examining the enemy’s configuration and observing their positions, the strategic advantage of the terrain—whether it leads to life or death—can be discerned.

Jia Lin said: Seeing how they deploy their forces reveals where their death lies.

Mei Yaochen said: Their terrain of life and death is recognized through the forms I manifest.

He Shi’s note concurs with Du Mu’s commentary.

Zhang Yu said: If I manifest weakness, the enemy will advance; if I manifest strength, they will retreat. By observing their advances and retreats, I know whether the ground they occupy leads to life or death. As stated earlier, ‘One skilled in moving the enemy manifests forms to which the enemy must respond.’ Death ground refers to treacherous terrain; life ground refers to advantageous terrain.

By measuring, one knows the enemy’s excesses and deficiencies.

Cao Cao said: *Jiao* means to measure.

Li Quan said: *Jiao* means to measure. By gauging their strength and courage, their emptiness or fullness becomes known.

Du Mu said: *Jiao* means to measure. I measure the enemy’s excesses with my own excesses, and their deficiencies with my own deficiencies. As Guanzi said: ‘A skilled attacker assesses the enemy’s numbers to attack their numbers, their provisions to attack their provisions. If their provisions are exhausted, do not attack; if their defenses are unprepared, do not attack.’ When Sima Xuanwang campaigned against Liaodong, Sima Chen Gui said: ‘Formerly, when we attacked Shangyong, eight divisions advanced day and night without rest, enabling us to capture the fortified city and slay Meng Da in half a month. Now, arriving from afar, you proceed so leisurely—I am deeply perplexed.’ The king replied: ‘Meng Da’s forces were few, and his provisions lasted a year. My forces are four times his, yet our grain will not last a month. To plan for a year with a month’s supplies—how can we not act swiftly? Attacking with four against one, even if half our forces perish, we must press on. Thus, we disregard casualties and race against their grain.’ Now, with the enemy numerous and we few, the enemy starving and we sated, the rains so heavy that no progress is made, and their grain nearly exhausted, we should feign incapacity to lull them. Later, when the rains ceased, we attacked day and night and ultimately pacified Liaodong.’

Mei Yaochen said: By measuring, I discern the enemy’s excesses and deficiencies.

Wang Zhe said: *Jiao* means to compare. Comparing our strength with theirs reveals their excesses and deficiencies, allowing us to plan advantageous attacks or defenses. All of the above pertains to measuring the enemy to know how to fight.

Zhang Yu said: Excess means strength; deficiency means weakness. Measuring the enemy’s configuration reveals their strong and weak points.

Emperor Taizong of Tang said: When approaching battle, I always match my strength against the enemy’s weakness, and my weakness against their strength. Without measurement, how could this be known?

Thus, the pinnacle of manifesting forms is to reach formlessness. When formless, even deep spies cannot pry, and the wise cannot scheme.

Li Quan said: The subtlety of manifesting forms lies in attaining formlessness—where spies cannot pry and wisdom cannot scheme—this is what is meant by *manifesting*.

Du Mu said: This speaks of the Way of warfare reaching its ultimate refinement in formlessness. When formless, even deep spies sent to observe cannot discern our emptiness or fullness. Strength and weakness are not revealed externally, so even the most astute cannot devise schemes against us.

Mei Yaochen said: Warfare inherently has form; when emptiness and fullness are concealed, it becomes formless—this is the ultimate achievement. Even if spies attempt to probe with cunning or the wise try to calculate, can they succeed?

Wang Zhe said: Controlling the form of warfare to achieve formlessness is the ultimate attainment—who can pry or scheme against it?

He Shi said: Formations are visible externally, but strategic changes occur internally. Adapting to forms to control change makes one’s intentions difficult to discern—this is called knowing the subtle.

Zhang Yu said: Initially, one uses emptiness and fullness to manifest forms to the enemy, leaving them unable to fathom our intentions. Thus, the ultimate refinement culminates in formlessness. With no form to observe and no pattern to seek, spies cannot exploit gaps, and the wise have no means to devise plans.

Victory is established through forms, yet the masses cannot perceive it.

Cao Cao said: Victory is established based on the enemy’s form.

Li Quan said: *Cuo* means to place. By setting up perilous formations, leveraging the soldiers’ courage, and seizing victory—military affairs prioritize secrecy, which the masses cannot comprehend.

Du Mu said: Discerning forms to establish victory or defeat is beyond the capacity of the wise, let alone the masses.

Mei Yaochen said: The masses know I can establish victory but do not understand that it arises from the enemy’s form.

He Shi said: Victory established through the enemy’s form is beyond the masses’ understanding.

Zhang Yu said: Victory is established through the enemy’s shifting forms, which the masses cannot comprehend.

All know the forms by which I prevail, yet none know the forms by which I secure victory.

Cao Cao said: Do not rely on a single form to prevail over all forms. Or: Do not fully reveal one’s knowledge.

The means of securing victory: all know how I prevail, but none know how I adapt the enemy’s form to secure victory.

Li Quan said: People know of the victory but not the subtle, hidden methods of securing it.

Du Mu said: After victory, people only see that I controlled the enemy, causing them to falter—this originated from me, enabling my triumph. As stated earlier: ‘Appear near when distant, appear distant when near; entice with profit, seize when disordered; prepare when substantial, avoid when strong; provoke when enraged, humble when arrogant; exhaust when at ease, divide when united.’ These are all methods of securing victory, unknown to others."

Chen Hao said: People only know my skill in defeating the enemy, but none know how I exploit the enemy’s faltering form.

Mei Yaochen said: They recognize the traces of victory but not the configurations that produce it.

Wang Zhe said: As with Han Xin’s troops arrayed with their backs to the river. People only saw the desperate battle of the army on the water, believing it could not be defeated, and when the Zhao forces panicked and fled in disarray, none understood by what means I had compelled them to do so.

Zhang Yu said: The breakthrough of victory is known to all, yet none perceive how I shaped it by adapting to the enemy’s form. Thus, victories in battle are never repeated, but respond to form in endless variation.

Cao Cao said: Do not act in repeated patterns but respond accordingly.

Li Quan said: Do not reuse past strategies to secure victory; adapt to circumstances and control change.

Du Mu said: Whenever the enemy presents a form, I can then respond and prevail.

Du You said: This is a fixed principle.

Jia Lin said: Responding to the enemy’s form to secure victory is inexhaustible.

Mei Yaochen said: Do not cling to old postures; respond to form with opportunity.

Wang Shi said: The principle of securing victory is singular, yet the forms of victory are infinite.

He Shi said: Once a method of victory has been used, it is not employed again. Respond to the enemy’s approach without following prior methods—thus it is inexhaustible.

Zhang Yu said: After victory, do not reuse previous strategies; instead, respond to the enemy’s form and deploy endless variations.

The form of warfare resembles water.

Meng Shi said: The momentum of warfare, like the swift or slow flow of water, is without constancy.

The form of water avoids heights and rushes downward.

Mei Yaochen said: Its nature.

The form of warfare avoids the substantial and strikes the insubstantial.

Mei Yaochen said: Its advantage.

Zhang Yu said: Water rushing downward follows the current; warfare striking the insubstantial gains advantage.

Water shapes its flow according to the terrain.

Du Mu said: Following the land’s descent.

Mei Yaochen said: Adapting to high and low.

Zhang Yu said: Whether square, round, slanted, or straight, it takes form according to the land.

Warfare shapes victory according to the enemy.

Li Quan said: Without adapting to the enemy’s momentum, how could we prevail?

Light troops cannot sustain prolonged engagement; when besieged, they must be reinforced. Provoke enraged troops, pacify strong ones, humble arrogant commanders, entice greedy ones, and reverse the suspicions of doubtful ones—thus victory is shaped by the enemy.

Du Mu said: Exploiting the enemy’s vulnerabilities.

Jia Lin said: Observing the enemy’s waxing and waning, I establish victory accordingly.

Du You said: Just as water shapes its flow according to the land’s slope, warfare secures victory by exploiting the enemy’s deficiencies.

Mei Yaochen said: Adapting to the insubstantial and substantial.

Wang Zhe said: Like dredging and guiding embankments.

He Shi said: Achieving success by adapting to the enemy’s strength or weakness.

Zhang Yu said: Whether insubstantial or substantial, strong or weak, victory is seized by adapting to the enemy.

Thus, warfare has no constant momentum.

Mei Yaochen said: Momentum arises in response to the enemy.

Zhang Yu said: The enemy changes and moves, so there is no constant momentum.

Water has no constant form.

Mei Yaochen said: Form arises according to the terrain.

Meng Shi said: Warfare has transformations; terrain has square and round.

Zhang Yu said: Terrain has high and low, so there is no constant form.

One who can adapt to the enemy’s changes and secure victory is called divine.

Cao Cao said: When momentum wanes, it must be revived; when form is exposed, it must be concealed. Thus, one who can adapt to the enemy’s changes and secure victory is like a spirit.

Li Quan said: One who understands this Way is called a divine army.

Du Mu said: The momentum of warfare is revealed only in response to the enemy; momentum does not reside in me, so it has no constancy. Like the form of water, which arises only in response to the terrain; form does not reside in water, so it has no constancy. Water, following the land’s descent, can float stones; warfare, responding to the enemy’s movements, can transform like a spirit.

Wang Zhe said: Warfare has constant principles but no constant momentum; water has constant nature but no constant form. The constant principle of warfare is striking the insubstantial; the lack of constant momentum lies in responding to the enemy. The constant nature of water is flowing downward; the lack of constant form lies in shaping itself to the terrain. When the momentum of warfare shifts, even defeated troops can be made to strike victorious ones—how much more so the elite?

He Shi said: Adapting and responding with wisdom; when wisdom is unfathomable, it is divine.

Zhang Yu said: Once the momentum of warfare is established, one who can adapt to the enemy’s changes and respond to secure victory is divinely subtle.

Thus, the Five Phases have no constant victor.

Du You said: The Five Phases alternate dominance.

Wang Zhe said: They mutually overcome one another.

The four seasons have no fixed position.

Du You said: The four seasons alternate in function.

Wang Zhe said: They mutually succeed one another.

The sun has short and long days; the moon has death and life.

Cao Cao said: Warfare has no constant momentum; its expansion and contraction follow the enemy.

Li Quan said: The Five Phases—rest, decline, ascendancy, and mutual overcoming—alternate. The four seasons—cold and heat—come and go without fixed constancy. The sun and moon traverse the heavens in 365 and a quarter degrees. The hundred divisions of the day: at the spring and autumn equinoxes, day and night are equal; at the summer solstice, the day has sixty divisions and the night forty; at the winter solstice, the day has forty divisions and the night sixty—unequal in length. The moon’s first day is the new moon, the eighth day the first quarter, the fifteenth day the full moon, the twenty-fourth day the last quarter, and the thirtieth day the dark moon—thus its death and life. Sunzi believed that the Five Phases, four seasons, and the waxing and waning of the sun and moon have no constancy—how much less can the forms of warfare remain fixed?

Mei Yaochen said: All these exemplify warfare’s adaptation to the enemy.

Wang Zhe said: All these illustrate the transformations of warfare, which follow no single Dao.

Zhang Yu said: The waxing and waning of the Five Phases, the succession of the four seasons, and the fullness and decline of the sun and moon—all resemble the unfixed nature of military momentum.

*Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Seven*
**“Military Strife”**

Cao Cao said: When two armies contend for victory.

Li Quan said: “Strife” means pursuing advantage. Only when emptiness and fullness are determined may one contend for profit with others.

Wang Xi said: “Strife” means contending for advantage—gaining it brings victory. One should first assess priorities, calculate indirect and direct routes, and prevent the enemy from exploiting one’s fatigue.

Zhang Yu said: The title “Military Strife” refers to two armies facing each other to contend for advantage. Only after discerning the enemy’s and one’s own emptiness and fullness may one contend for victory, hence its placement after “Emptiness and Fullness.”

Sunzi said: In all methods of employing troops, the general receives the command from the ruler,
Li Quan said: Receiving the ruler’s mandate.

executes the temple’s victorious calculations, and reverently carries out Heaven’s punishment.
Zhang Yu said: Receiving the ruler’s command to punish rebels.

assembles the army and gathers the masses,
Cao Cao said: Mobilizing the state’s people, organizing ranks, selecting officers, and establishing camps to form battle arrays.

Mei Yaochen said: Gathering the state’s masses to form an army.

Wang Xi said: A great state’s three armies total thirty-seven thousand five hundred men; if all conscripts are levied, the total reaches seventy-five thousand. This is what is meant by “assembling the army and gathering the masses.”

Zhang Yu said: Uniting the state’s people into an army and assembling troops into formations.

and encamps after engaging in accord.
Cao Cao said: The army gate is called the “accord gate,” the left and right gates are “banner gates,” a camp formed with chariots is a “wheeled gate,” and one formed with men is a “human gate.” When two armies face each other, it is called “engaging in accord.”

Li Quan said: Intermingling and harmonizing. After assembling the army, strengths and weaknesses, courage and timidity, length and brevity, front and rear are interspersed and balanced, combining forces before uniting the camps to contend with the enemy.

Du Mu said: The *Rites of Zhou* uses banners for the left and right accord gates. Zheng Sinong said: The army gate is called the “accord gate,” now known as the camp gate, marked by two banners to order entry and exit. “Engaging” means facing the enemy’s camp and encamping with accord gates aligned.

Jia Lin said: “Encamping” means halting. Soldiers intermingle and harmonize, halting in camp before moving to seize advantage.

Mei Yaochen said: The army gate is the accord gate; two armies face each other and encamp.

He [Yan]shi said: With accord gates in sight, the moment before battle is joined is the most difficult task for military strategists.

Zhang Yu said: The army gate is the accord gate; when facing the enemy’s camp and encamping, the gates align. Alternatively, it means harmonizing with superiors and subordinates before deploying troops to establish camps. Thus, Wuzi said: “Without harmony in the state, one cannot deploy the army; without harmony in the army, one cannot deploy formations.”

Nothing is more difficult than military strife.
Cao Cao said: From the initial receipt of the command to engaging in accord, military strife is difficult.

Du Mu said: Difficult in contending for advantage and harm.

Mei Yaochen said: From receiving the command to this point is the most difficult.

Zhang Yu said: Contending for advantage while facing the enemy is the most difficult thing in the world.

The difficulty of military strife lies in turning the circuitous into the direct and misfortune into fortune.
Cao Cao said: Feigning distance to hasten the journey and arriving before the enemy.

Du Mu said: To contend for advantage, one must first present the circuitous as direct and misfortune as fortune, deceiving the enemy to make them careless before swiftly advancing.

Chen Hao said: Assembling the army and gathering the masses, engaging in accord and uniting—all follow established systems, but military strife is the most difficult. Without knowing how to turn the circuitous into the direct and misfortune into fortune, one cannot contend with the enemy.

Jia Lin said: Marching the entire army to contend for advantageous terrain and seizing it first—if one fails to secure the ground, one cedes victory to the enemy, making this the most difficult.

Du You said: The enemy’s route is originally circuitous, and the misfortune lies in its distance; thus, one must first occupy terrain of strategic advantage. Hence it is said: “turning misfortune into fortune.”

Mei Yaochen said: The difficulty lies in transforming the circuitous into the near and misfortune into fortune.

Wang Xi said: Cao Cao said: Feigning distance to hasten the journey and arriving before the enemy. I say: Feigning distance means making the enemy unprepared to march, or dispatching an extraordinary force via a hidden route.

He [Yan]shi said: When the target state’s roads traverse perilous mountains and are circuitous and distant, to contend for advantage, one must divide forces and dispatch extraordinary troops, following local guides via direct routes to exploit the enemy’s unpreparedness and strike swiftly. Though this entails the misfortune of hazardous terrain, the advantage is gained quickly. For example, when Zhong Hui invaded Shu, Deng Ai took an extraordinary route and arrived first, catching Shu unprepared and forcing its surrender. Thus, the text below states: “Without local guides, one cannot gain the advantage of terrain.”

Zhang Yu said: Transforming the circuitous into the direct and misfortune into fortune—this is the difficulty of military strife. Thus, by making the route appear circuitous and enticing the enemy with advantage, one sets out later but arrives first. This is the strategy of knowing the circuitous and the direct.

Li Quan said: Thus, by making the route appear circuitous, one feigns a lack of haste, setting out later but arriving first. Employing such tactics in warfare transforms misfortune into advantage.

Du Mu said: The preceding explanation states that "turning the circuitous into the direct" means presenting the enemy with a deceptively distant route, causing their vigilance to slacken. Further enticing them with advantage distracts their focus. Then, by doubling the pace and advancing with all speed, one strikes unexpectedly, thus setting out later but arriving first to seize the contested strategic point. When Qin attacked Han at Yanyu, King Zhao of Zhao dispatched Zhao She to relieve it. After advancing thirty *li* from Handan, Zhao She issued a military order: "Whoever remonstrates on military matters shall be put to death." The Qin army was west of Wu’an, and as their drums and war cries resounded, the tiles on the roofs of Wu’an trembled. A scout in the Zhao camp urged an immediate rescue of Wu’an, but Zhao She executed him on the spot. He fortified his position and remained stationary for twenty-eight days, further strengthening his ramparts. When a Qin spy arrived, Zhao She treated him well and sent him back. The spy reported to Qin, and the Qin general rejoiced, saying: "Though they halted just thirty *li* from their capital, they have not advanced and have only reinforced their defenses. Yanyu is no longer Zhao’s territory." After dispatching the Qin spy, Zhao She ordered his troops to don armor and march swiftly, covering the distance in two days and one night. He then stationed skilled archers fifty *li* from Yanyu. When the Qin forces learned of this, they advanced in full armor. A soldier said: "Whoever seizes the northern mountain first will prevail." Zhao She dispatched ten thousand men to occupy it, and when the Qin forces arrived to contest it, they could not dislodge them. Zhao She then launched a full assault, crushing the Qin army and relieving Yanyu.

Jia Lin said: Though the enemy’s route is originally direct, one can make it appear circuitous by deploying decoy forces or offering minor advantages on alternate paths, preventing the enemy from rushing to the contested point.

Mei Yaochen said: By lengthening the route and enticing with advantage, one lulls the enemy. By setting out later but arriving first, one seizes the initiative. He who understands this employs the strategy of transforming the circuitous into the direct and misfortune into fortune.

He Yan said: The "circuitous route" refers to the intended path. By dividing forces and launching a surprise attack, one presents the intended route as circuitous, creating a deceptive situation to lure the enemy. Enticing them with minor gains distracts them, allowing the surprise force—though setting out later—to arrive first. Thus, contending for advantage requires assessing the dynamics of the circuitous and the direct to execute a surprise maneuver. Hence, the text below states: "Variations of division and concentration are as swift as the wind."

Zhang Yu said: In terrain of strategic importance, seizing it ensures victory. To contend for advantageous ground nearby, one first leads the army far away, then entices the enemy with minor gains, causing them to neither expect one’s advance nor resist the offered advantage. Thus, one sets out later but arrives first. This is what is meant by "turning the circuitous into the direct and misfortune into fortune." Zhao She seized the northern mountain to defeat the Qin army, just as Guo Huai stationed troops at Beiyuan to repel Zhuge Liang. He who arrives first by setting out later understands the calculations and the strategy of turning the circuitous into the direct.

Thus, contending in warfare may bring advantage or peril.

Cao Cao said: The adept turn it to advantage; the inept invite peril.

Li Quan said: In warfare, a skilled general brings advantage; an unskilled one invites peril.

Du Mu said: The adept are those who deliberate carefully.

Jia Lin said: If one’s army arrives first and secures advantageous terrain, it brings advantage. If the enemy has already occupied the ground and one’s forces rush to contest it, the enemy will be at ease while one’s own troops are fatigued—this is the path to peril.

Mei Yaochen said: Contending in warfare may bring either advantage or peril. (Another version reads: "Contending in warfare brings advantage; contending with many brings peril.")

He Yan said: This further explains that leading an army, driving the three forces into competition with the enemy to vie for a single day’s victory, brings advantage if successful but peril if not. Such actions must not be undertaken lightly.

Zhang Yu said: The wise contend for advantage; the foolish invite peril. The enlightened understand the circuitous and the direct; the ignorant remain oblivious.

If the entire army contends for advantage, it will not arrive in time.

Cao Cao said: It will be too late.

Li Quan said: The baggage train slows the march.

Jia Lin said: When employing troops, one must pursue advantage. If the entire army rushes to contend for it directly, the distance—whether near or far—makes swift arrival difficult. One may instead secretly devise a stratagem to lengthen the enemy’s route, causing them to misjudge one’s intentions, so that one arrives first while the enemy lags behind.

Du You said: It will be too late. If the entire army marches to contend for advantage, the roads will be too congested to keep pace.

Mei Yaochen said: Mobilizing all the army’s resources slows the advance.

Wang Xi said: Due to the baggage train.

Zhang Yu said: Advancing with the entire army slows the march and prevents timely arrival.

If the army abandons its supplies to contend for advantage, the baggage train will be lost.

Cao Cao said: Abandoning the baggage train risks its loss.

Li Quan said: Forsaking the baggage train depletes military resources.

Du Mu said: Marching with the entire army’s equipment causes sluggishness and delays, preventing timely arrival. Abandoning the baggage train and advancing with light forces risks its loss.

Jia Lin said: One fears the enemy may discover and cut off the supply lines.

Du You said: Leaving behind supplies and advancing with light forces risks the enemy exploiting the vulnerability to raid the rear, causing the entire baggage train to be lost.

Mei Yaochen said: Abandoning the army’s resources means losing the baggage train.

Wang Xi’s note is the same as Cao Cao’s. He Yan’s note is the same as Du You’s.

Zhang Yu said: Leaving behind heavy equipment and advancing with light forces risks the baggage train being plundered by the enemy, hence its loss.

Thus, by rolling up the armor and advancing without rest, day and night,

Cao Cao said: Without respite, the troops will be exhausted.

Marching double the usual distance without rest, contending for advantage a hundred *li* away, will result in the capture of all three generals.

Du You said: If one disregards the two concerns above and seeks only speed, rolling up the armor and binding the weapons, advancing by stealth under cover of night—should the enemy discern the situation and intercept the march, the generals of the three armies will be taken captive. Such was the case when the Duke of Qin raided Zheng, and all three commanders were captured.

The vigorous arrive first, the weary lag behind; by this method, only one in ten reaches the objective.

Cao Cao said: Contending for advantage a hundred *li* away is unwise; all three generals will be taken.

Li Quan said: If one marches a hundred and twenty *li* in a day, this is double the usual distance, yet not twice the effort. If this is done, the strong will arrive first, the weary later. With few vigorous soldiers and many exhausted, perhaps one in ten may reach the destination ahead, while the rest straggle behind. How, then, could the three generals avoid capture? When Emperor Wu of Wei pursued Liu Bei, his forces marched three hundred *li* in a day and night, yet Zhuge Liang remarked that the bolt from a strong crossbow, at its furthest reach, cannot pierce the thinnest silk—meaning it has no force left. Thus came the defeat at Red Cliffs. When Pang Juan pursued Sun Bin, he perished at Ma Ling; the principle is the same.

Du Mu said: This explanation is incomplete. Generally, an army marches thirty *li* in a day, which is called a *she*. Marching double the distance means covering two *she*; to travel a hundred *li* in a day and night without rest is to march double the distance for one *she*. If one contends for advantage in this manner, the troops will be exhausted, and all three generals will surely be captured. As for the method of one in ten arriving: when compelled to contend for advantage, select the most vigorous from every ten men to advance first, while the rest follow in succession. From ten thousand men, choose a thousand; let them arrive at dawn, with the remainder coming later—some by mid-morning, others by afternoon—so that none exhaust their strength, and all arrive in unbroken sequence, maintaining contact with the vanguard. When contending for advantage, one must seize a critical position; even a thousand men can hold it against the enemy until reinforcements arrive. Emperor Taizong once secured Wu Gong with three thousand five hundred cavalry, and Dou Jiande’s army of a hundred and eighty thousand could not advance—this demonstrates the principle.

Chen Hao said: Du’s explanation represents a separate tactical approach, not the meaning of "one in ten arriving." It refers to contending for advantage a hundred *li* away: the vigorous arrive first, the weary later, so that only one in ten reaches the destination, while nine are exhausted. The one who arrives is the vigorous one.

Jia Lin said: When the road is long and the men weary, their strength spent from haste, one exhausts oneself while the enemy remains at ease—how could one not be struck down?

Du You said: Contending for advantage a hundred *li* away is unwise; all three generals will be captured. The strong and weak do not wait for one another, so only one in ten reaches the army.

*Pi* is read as *fatigued*.

Mei Yaochen said: An army typically marches thirty *li* before halting. Now, to march a hundred *li* day and night without rest—this is why the three generals will be captured. Why? The distance is great, the vigorous few, the weary many; only one in ten arrives. The three generals command the three armies.

Wang Xi said: *Pi* means *exhausted*. This speaks of the way of contending for advantage: it is better to do so nearby than far away. The force of a gale wanes until it cannot lift a feather; the bolt from a strong crossbow, at its furthest reach, cannot pierce the thinnest silk. If one marches day and night to cover a hundred *li* in pursuit of advantage, even if one-tenth of the vigorous arrive, they will already be worn out. Should the enemy strike our weary forces with their rested ones, we will surely be defeated without a battle. Thus, Sima Xuanwang said: "Marching double the distance without rest—this is what those who understand warfare avoid." Some ask: Zhao She also rolled up his armor and advanced, covering the distance in two days and one night, yet he defeated Qin—why? The answer: Zhao She had long conserved his strength and accumulated power, reinforced his ramparts, and sent spies to feign weakness and embolden the enemy. Qin did not anticipate his arrival, and his troops were resolute. Moreover, Zhao She encamped fifty *li* from Ye Yu; by the time Qin learned of this and dispatched forces, two or three days would have passed. When they arrived, they would have endured the fatigue of a fifty-*li* march, while Zhao She’s men had rested for two or three days, their vigor undiminished. He then led them into perilous terrain, seized the heights at Gao Yang, and employed both orthodox and unorthodox tactics—how could he not prevail?

He Yan said: When the three generals seek advantage through surprise, abandoning the army’s supplies and rolling up their armor in haste—if they march a hundred *li* day and night without rest, only one in ten of the vigorous may arrive. Weary and outnumbered, even if we strike, victory is not assured; if defeated, all three generals will be captured. This shows how deeply the *Martial* cautions against such actions.

Zhang Yu said: *Juan jia* means *all in armor*. Advancing fully armored refers to both light and heavy forces moving together. Generally, an army marches thirty *li* before halting; exceeding sixty *li* is double the distance, and marching day and night without rest is *jian xing*. To contend for advantage a hundred *li* away, with light troops in front and baggage behind, men and horses weary, the thirsty unable to drink, the hungry unable to eat—should they suddenly encounter the enemy, they would face rested forces while exhausted, sated forces while starving, and their vanguard and rearguard would be unable to support one another. Thus, the commanders of the three armies would surely be captured. Such was the case when the Jin captured the three Qin generals. Among the light troops, perhaps one in ten vigorous and swift men arrives first, while the other nine are exhausted and lag behind—how much more so for the heavy forces? How do we know both light and heavy forces are involved? The following passage states: "Contending for advantage fifty *li* away, half will arrive." If only light troops were involved, a fifty-*li* march in a day would not be far—how could half fail to arrive?

Thus, heavy forces must necessarily accompany the march. Contending for advantage fifty *li* away, the vanguard general will be thwarted, and by rule only half will arrive. Cao Cao notes: "Thwarted, as in defeated." Li Quan says: "Over a hundred *li*, one in ten men arrives; over fifty *li*, five in ten arrive—yet the army’s might is broken, and capture is not the only outcome." This speaks of how shorter distances prevent exhaustion. Du Mu states: "Half arriving means selecting five of ten vigorous men to advance first." Jia Lin says: "Vanguard, as in those who go ahead." Du You says: "Thwarted, as in defeated. The general of the forward army has already been routed by the enemy." Mei Yaochen says: "Even if five of ten arrive, the distance is still too great to secure victory." Wang Xi says: "The peril of exhaustion is reduced by more than half, but defeat is still suffered." Zhang Yu says: "If a fifty-*li* march—where half arrive—still breaks the army’s might, how much worse over a hundred *li*? 'Thwarting the vanguard general' refers to the forward army advancing first."

Someone asked: "When Emperor Taizong of Tang pursued Song Jingang, he marched over two hundred *li* in a day and night and still achieved victory—why?" The answer: "The circumstances were similar, but the strategic conditions differed. Jingang had already been defeated, and his forces’ morale was broken. Pressing the attack to annihilation would have pacified Hedong immediately; delay would have allowed the enemy to regroup. This is why Taizong disregarded fatigue and pursued relentlessly. The principles of contending for advantage as laid out by Sunzi differ from this case."

Contending for advantage thirty *li* away, two-thirds will arrive. Cao Cao says: "Shorter distances mean more arrive, so there is no risk of annihilation." Li Quan says: "Nearby marches do not exhaust, so there are no casualties." Du Mu says: "Within thirty *li*, six or seven of ten men can advance first." The rule is not stated here, as it can be inferred from the preceding passage. Du You says: "Shorter distances mean more arrive, so annihilation is not mentioned—though victory or defeat remains uncertain." In ancient warfare, armies marched thirty *li* a day, with infantry and cavalry supporting one another. Now, rushing toward advantage without such coordination, only two-thirds arrive. Mei Yaochen says: "Shorter distances mean more arrive, perhaps allowing for victory." Wang Xi says: "When the strategic situation demands contention, this may be unavoidable. Though only two-thirds arrive, these are the elite forces, not yet exhausted—so defeat cannot be assumed, which is why the rule is not stated." Zhang Yu says: "Shorter distances prevent exhaustion, and the majority arrive without losing formation or depleting the strength of men and horses—perhaps allowing for victory."

The above three cases all refer to the entire army contending for advantage. Thus, an army without baggage trains perishes, without provisions perishes, without supplies perishes. Cao Cao says: "Lacking these three is the path to destruction." Li Quan says: "Without baggage trains, supplies are lacking. Yuan Shao had a hundred thousand troops, but Cao Cao, following Xun You’s counsel, burned his baggage and defeated him at Guandu. Without provisions, even fortified cities are worthless—food is paramount. The Master said: 'Sufficient food, sufficient arms, and the people’s trust.' Thus, the Red Eyebrows’ million-strong army, lacking food, surrendered at Xingyang with their sovereign bound. Therefore, those skilled in warfare first cultivate and then fight." Without supplies, resources are depleted. "When Emperor Gaozu lacked Guanzhong, when Emperor Guangwu lacked Henei, when Cao Cao lacked Yanzhou—each fled in defeat, unable to recover." Du Mu says: "Baggage trains include weapons and soldiers’ gear; supplies refer to goods and wealth." Chen Hao says: "This explains the difficulty of contending for advantage with the entire army." Mei Yaochen says: "None of these three can be lacking—thus, one cannot contend for advantage with the entire army." Wang Xi says: "Supplies include firewood, salt, vegetables, and materials—armies rely on these three to sustain themselves and cannot lightly abandon them." Zhang Yu says: "Without baggage trains, equipment and tools are lacking; without provisions, rations are insufficient; without supplies, resources are depleted—all are paths to destruction. These three refer to contending for advantage with the entire army."

Those who do not know the schemes of the feudal lords cannot form alliances in advance. Cao Cao says: "Those who do not know the enemy’s plans cannot forge alliances." Li Quan says: "To prepare is to be ready. Knowing the enemy’s intentions requires securing alliances." Du Mu says: "This is incorrect. 'In advance' means beforehand; 'alliances' refers to engaging in battle. One must first know the feudal lords’ schemes before joining battle; without such knowledge, one cannot engage." Chen Hao says: "Cao’s interpretation—that one cannot secure external aid without first knowing the enemy’s plans—is also valid. Both explanations are plausible." Mei Yaochen says: "Without knowing the enemy state’s schemes, one cannot form alliances with neighboring states for support." Zhang Yu says: "Only by first knowing the true conditions of the feudal lords can one forge alliances; ignorance of their schemes risks betrayal. Neighboring states as allies are also part of contending for advantage, as the following passage states: 'The first to arrive and gain the support of the realm holds the central position.'"

Those who do not know the forms of mountains, forests, defiles, marshes, and wetlands cannot march an army. Cao Cao says: "Lofty and towering are mountains; dense clusters of trees are forests; trenches and chasms are defiles; alternating high and low terrain is rough ground; waterlogged grasslands are marshes; where waters gather and do not flow are wetlands. Without prior knowledge of the terrain an army occupies and the forms of mountains and rivers, one cannot advance." Mei Yaochen says: "The forms of mountains, forests, defiles, and the conditions of marshes and wetlands must be thoroughly examined." Zhang Yu says: "Lofty and towering are mountains; dense clusters of trees are forests; pits and trenches are defiles; alternating high and low terrain is rough ground; waterlogged grasslands are marshes; where waters gather and do not flow are wetlands. Only by fully understanding all such terrain can one contend for advantage and march an army."

Without local guides, one cannot secure the advantages of terrain.

Li Quan says: "When entering enemy territory, one fears narrow mountain passes and river gorges, muddy earth, and unfavorable wells and springs. Employing guides allows one to gain the advantages of terrain." The *Yi* states: "Pursuing deer without a forester"—this is its meaning.

Du Mu says: Master Guanzi says: "All military leaders must first thoroughly examine maps. The dangers of narrow passes, the depths of rivers where wheels sink, the locations of famous mountains, connecting valleys, great rivers, hills, mounds, and plateaus, the luxuriance of grasses, forests, reeds, and rushes, the distances of roads, the sizes of cities and towns, the sites of famous settlements, abandoned towns, and cultivated lands—all must be fully known. The intersecting entry and exit points of terrain must be entirely committed to memory, only then can one avoid losing the advantages of terrain."

Duke Wei, Li Jing, says: "All bandits and raiders excel at ambushes. One must select courageous men and discerning officers, and employ local guides to secretly traverse mountains and forests, concealing their sounds and obscuring their tracks. Some may carve beastly footprints and retrace their steps midway; others may don the guise of small birds and lie concealed in thickets. Then, straining their ears to listen afar and raising their eyes to see deeply, they concentrate their wisdom to assess the situation and focus their minds to observe signs. Seeing water marks, they know when the enemy crossed; watching trees sway, they can discern the enemy’s advance. Thus, beacon fires must be tended with utmost care, and banners must be uniform and consistent. Rewards and punishments must be weighty and unerring; punishments and executions must be severe and unrelenting. When the enemy moves or rests, we are prepared; when the enemy schemes, we know it first."

Chen Hao said: All these advantages of terrain cannot be known without employing local guides. Du You said: If one does not employ local guides to lead the army, the convenience of roads cannot be obtained. Mei Yaochen said: The orientation of hills, plateaus, plains, and lowlands, the twists and straightaways of cities and roads—none can be known without guides. He Shi said: The *Xiangdao Lüe* states: A hunter without a mountain warden cannot assess the terrain’s feasibility and will wander into the forest in vain, never catching the deer. A campaigner without a local guide cannot discern the twists and straightaways of roads and will reach the borderlands in vain, never capturing the enemy. To march on a mission of punitive expedition, rushing into unfamiliar lands where civilizing influence has not reached and courier routes are severed, and to plunge deep into their obstacles—is this not perilous? Our lone army advances while they lie in wait in secrecy, the disparity between guest and host already vast. Moreover, they rely on deceit and employ manifold ruses to mislead us. If we advance recklessly without calculation, charging headlong into danger, scaling perilous heights risks blockage and rupture; marching by day risks sudden enemy assaults; halting by night risks false alarms. Caught unprepared in haste, we fall into their snare—this is to lead an army of bears and tigers and cast them into death’s maw. How then can we breach their ramparts or sweep away their cunning lairs? Thus, the mountains and rivers, ridges and hills of the enemy’s land that can be used to set up defenses; the forests, reeds, and lush grasses that can conceal troops; the distances of roads; the size of cities and towns; the breadth of settlements; the fertility of fields; the depth of ditches; the abundance of stores; the number of soldiers and chariots; the sturdiness of weapons—all must be thoroughly known. Then the enemy lies within our grasp, and capture is assured. Formerly, Zhang Qian was sent as an envoy to Daxia and detained long among the Xiongnu. He guided the army to advantageous positions and knew where water and pasture were plentiful, so his troops suffered neither hunger nor thirst. This is how one secures such advantages. When employing local guides, if the army captures them as prisoners, one must guard against their schemes, for they may secretly harbor treacherous plans to mislead and deceive. One must scrutinize their expressions, observe their intentions, and cross-verify the words of several individuals. Only when their accounts remain consistent from beginning to end can they be trusted. Reward them generously to inspire gratitude; enrich their households to bind their hearts. Then they become our own people and will not betray us. Yet it is better to have long-nurtured, capable individuals. Even those merely familiar with the routes need not be locals to be employed. Still, select trusted, wise, and courageous men to accompany them, and every detail will be examined, every trail followed without error.

Zhang Yu said: The smoothness or ruggedness of mountains and rivers, the twists and straightaways of roads—only by employing local guides to lead the way can one know their advantages and contend for victory. When Wu attacked Lu, the people of Zeng guided them to capture Wucheng—this is an example. Thus, warfare is established through deception. Du Mu said: Deceive the enemy so they do not know our true condition, and then victory can be established. Mei Yaochen said: Without cunning, nothing can be accomplished. Wang Xi said: This means turning circuitous paths into straight ones, turning adversity into advantage. He Shi said: Displaying false strength to mislead the enemy. Zhang Yu said: Deception is fundamental; if the enemy cannot discern our shifts between the extraordinary and the orthodox, we can establish ourselves. Move when there is advantage. Du Mu said: Advantage means acting only when opportunity arises. Mei Yaochen said: Without advantage, one cannot act. Wang Xi said: Entice them. He Shi said: Strike only when the enemy is vulnerable. Zhang Yu said: Act when advantage appears, not recklessly. As the *Zuo Zhuan* states: "The Three Armies move when there is advantage." This is to vary with division and union. Cao Cao said: The army divides and unites in response to the enemy. Li Quan said: Employ deceit to exploit advantage; divide or unite to create shifting forms. Du Mu said: Division and union mean separating or combining to confuse the enemy. Observe their response to our maneuvers, then adapt to secure victory. Chen Hao said: Alternate between union and division, shifting accordingly. Meng Shi said: Military strategy relies on deception to entice the enemy’s mind; division and union are the arts of variation. Mei Yaochen and Wang Xi concur with Cao Cao’s annotation. Zhang Yu said: Whether dispersing our forces or concentrating our strength, all variations arise in response to the enemy’s movements. Some say: Variation refers to the interplay of the extraordinary and the orthodox, confounding the enemy. Thus, the *Art of War* of Duke Wei states: When troops are dispersed, unity becomes extraordinary; when united, dispersion becomes extraordinary. Three commands and five admonitions, three dispersals and three unions—all return to the orthodox.

Thus, its swiftness is like the wind. Cao Cao said: Strike where it is empty. Li Quan said: Advance and retreat. Its coming leaves no trace; its retreat is exceedingly swift. Mei Yaochen said: Its arrival leaves no form or trace. Wang Xi said: Swiftly exploit emptiness. He Shi concurs with Mei Yaochen’s annotation. Zhang Yu said: Its arrival is swift and violent, sweeping all before it. Its slowness is like the forest. Cao Cao said: When no advantage is seen. Li Quan said: March in orderly ranks. Du Mu said: *Xu* means slow. When moving slowly, one must maintain formations like a forest to guard against enemy ambush. Meng Shi said: When moving slowly, one must maintain formations like a forest to prevent surprise attacks. Du You said: Without advantage, do not advance. Like the wind stirring the forest, the small may sway, but the great remains unmoved. Mei Yaochen said: Like a forest, solemn and unbroken. Wang Xi said: Solemn and orderly.

Zhang Yu said: "Xu" means leisurely. To advance at a leisurely pace, as solemn and unbroken as a forest, signifies that no advantage is yet seen. *Wei Liaozi* states: The heavy are like mountains and forests; the light are like gunpowder and wildfire.

**Swift as fire when raiding,**
Cao Cao said: Swift.
Li Quan said: Like fire scorching the plains, leaving no grass unburned.
Du Mu said: Fierce and unstoppable.
Jia Lin said: Invading and plundering the enemy’s land is like wildfire—once set, it cannot be reversed.
Zhang Yu said: As the *Book of Songs* says: "Fierce as fire, none dare withstand me." The momentum is like a raging blaze—who would dare oppose it?

**Unmoving as mountains,**
Cao Cao said: To hold fast.
Li Quan said: To halt the chariots.
Du Mu said: Calm and towering, unshakable.
Jia Lin said: When no advantage is seen and the enemy seeks to deceive, remain unmoved, steadfast as a mountain.
Mei Yaochen said: Too steep to assail.
Wang Xi said: To stand firm.
He Shi said: Still as a mountain’s quiet weight.
Zhang Yu said: This is how one maintains composure. *Xunzi’s "Discourse on Military Affairs"* states: "Encamped in a circle, aligned with square order, one is like bedrock—those who strike it shatter their horns." When unmoving, one is as immovable as stone; those who challenge it break themselves.

**Obscure as shadow,**
Li Quan said: Its force is as unfathomable as darkness, where no form can be discerned.
Du Mu said: Like dark clouds veiling the sky, hiding sun, moon, and stars.
Mei Yaochen said: Hidden and inscrutable.
Wang Xi said: Concealed in form.
He Shi said: Secret and unpredictable.
Zhang Yu said: Like clouds obscuring the heavens, where no celestial sign can be seen.

**Striking like thunder,**
Li Quan said: A fury unleashed.
Du Mu said: Like a bolt from the void—nowhere to flee.
Jia Lin said: Its movement is too swift to counter.
*Taigong* said: "Swift as thunder leaves no time to cover one’s ears."
Mei Yaochen said: Too fast to evade.
Wang Xi said: Arriving before one can prepare.
He Shi said: Concealed strategy erupts thus.
Zhang Yu said: Like sudden thunder—nowhere to hide. Thus *Taigong* said: "Swift as thunder leaves no time to cover one’s ears; fast as lightning leaves no time to blink."

**Plunder villages, divide forces,**
Cao Cao said: Exploit the enemy to secure victory.
Li Quan said: When raiding, split forces into multiple columns to guard against the unexpected.
Du Mu said: In enemy villages and settlements, where no defenses stand, livestock and grain are easily seized. Divide troops in rotation so all may partake—none should monopolize the spoils. Thus, whether strong or weak, all will vie for advantage.
Chen Hao said: Villages and hamlets are scattered; where defenses are lacking, dispatch troops to plunder.
*(Note: "Plunder villages" may also read "direct forces.")*
Jia Lin said: Troops cannot be dispatched by word; thus, banners direct their course. Units cannot be commanded by speech; thus, signals divide their ranks. Seizing the enemy’s formation to shape one’s own—this is the essence of disciplined training.
Mei Yaochen said: To reward the soldiers.
Wang Xi said: Direct forces toward their objective, dividing them accordingly. *(Note: "Xiang" here carries the sound of "direction.")*
He Shi said: Distribute plunder among the troops.
Zhang Yu said: The way of war generally requires provisioning from the enemy. Yet villages hold little store—thus, troops must be divided to plunder widely to meet needs.

**Expand territory, share gains,**
Cao Cao said: Divide the enemy’s advantages.
Li Quan said: When seizing enemy land, distribute control of strategic points.
Du Mu said: *Kuò* means to open. When territory is expanded, divide and grant it to the meritorious. Han Xin told the King of Han: "Xiang Yu awards those due titles by carving seals—yet he hesitates to bestow them. If Your Majesty reverses this, granting cities to your generals, none under heaven will be beyond your grasp." *The Three Strategies* states: "Divide conquered lands."
Chen Hao said: When land is taken, garrison troops to cultivate it, thus dividing the enemy’s resources.
Jia Lin said: *Kuò* means to assess. Evaluate the enemy’s strategic terrain and divide its advantages.
Mei Yaochen said: Reward the meritorious.
Wang Xi said: Survey the terrain to secure advantageous positions, preventing the enemy from monopolizing them.
Zhang Yu said: In open and level terrain, divide forces to hold key points, denying them to the enemy. *(Alternatively: Grant conquered land to the meritorious.)* Yet considering the preceding and following passages, this interpretation seems unlikely.

**Weigh circumstances before acting,**
Cao Cao said: Assess the enemy before moving.
Li Quan said: *Quán* is the scale’s weight. If the enemy’s strength differs from ours by even a fraction, then act. To move first is to be the guest—difficult; to move after is to be the host—easier. The *Taiyi Dunjia* calculations clarify the ease of decisive action.
Du Mu said: Like a scale with its weight suspended—once balanced, then act.
He Shi concurs with Du Mu’s annotation.
Zhang Yu said: Like suspending a weight from a scale—know the measure before acting. *Wei Liaozi* states: "Weigh the enemy’s strength, scrutinize the general’s ability, then strike." This means assessing the enemy’s weight and the general’s wisdom before committing.

**He who first understands the calculus of detours and direct routes prevails—this is the method of military contention.**
Li Quan said: The calculus of circuitous and direct paths. Fatigue, hunger, and cold arise on the march.
Du Mu said: In military contention, one must first calculate the far and near, the circuitous and direct—only then can victory be assured. This calculation must be as precise as a scale, not erring by even a fraction, before one can act and triumph.

This is the method of prevailing in military contention.

Mei Yaochen said: Weighing advantages and harms before acting, victory lies in foreknowledge of the distant and near.
Wang Xi said: Assessing the enemy’s weight and moving accordingly, while also knowing the calculus of detours and direct routes—this is the certain path to victory.
Zhang Yu said: In all contention for advantage, one must first measure the circuitousness and directness of the roads. Only after careful scrutiny and assessment does one act, thereby avoiding the hardships of fatigue, hunger, and cold. Moreover, advance and retreat, speed and slowness, are timed without losing the moment—hence victory.

*The Military Regulations* states:
Mei Yaochen said: An ancient military classic.
Wang Xi said: An old military text.

When voices cannot be heard, drums and bells are used.
Du You said: Bells include *zheng* and *duo*, whose sounds serve as auditory signals.
Mei Yaochen said: To command the ear with authority—its sounds must be clear.
Wang Xi said: Drums, *pi*, *zheng*, and *duo*—whether halting or advancing, hastening or slowing, sparse or dense—all follow their rhythms.

When sights cannot be seen, banners and flags are used.
Du You said: Gazing upon their movements serves as visual signals.
Mei Yaochen said: To command the eye with authority—its colors must be distinct.
Wang Xi said: They mark the ranks and files, ensuring order.

Now, drums and bells, banners and flags serve to unify the ears and eyes of the army.
Li Quan said: Drums signal advance, bells signal retreat; banners reward, flags punish. Ears listen to drums and bells, eyes watch banners and flags—thus order is maintained.
When the brave and the timid alike cannot advance or retreat at will, it is because the drums and flags are precise.
Zhang Yu said: When an army is vast and its positions broad, front and rear are distant, ears and eyes cannot connect. Thus, the sounds of drums and bells make them hear one another, while the forms of banners and flags make them see. When sight and sound are uniform, even a million troops advance and retreat as one. Hence it is said: "Fighting a multitude is like fighting a few"—this is the principle of *xing* and *ming*.

Once the army is unified, the brave cannot advance alone, nor the timid retreat alone—this is the method of commanding multitudes.
Du Mu said: Banners issue commands, flags respond to signals. Flags here refer to today’s signal flags.

Military law states: "Those who fail to advance when ordered, or fail to retreat when ordered, shall be executed."
When Wu Qi fought the Qin, before the battle was joined, a single soldier, unable to contain his valor, charged forward, captured two heads, and returned. Wu Qi had him executed. His officers protested: "This is a skilled warrior—he should not be slain." Wu Qi replied: "He may be skilled, but he disobeyed orders." And so he executed him.

Mei Yaochen said: "Unifying the ears and eyes" means ensuring that the army’s sight and hearing are aligned and undivided. When the drum sounds, advance; when the bell sounds, halt; when the banner waves right, turn right; when it waves left, turn left. Neither the brave nor the timid may act alone.
Wang Xi said: It is through drums, bells, banners, and flags that the multitudes—brave and timid alike—advance and retreat in unison.
Zhang Yu said: Soldiers focus their minds entirely on the signals of drums, bells, banners, and flags. When ordered to advance, they advance; when ordered to retreat, they retreat. Any who disobey must be executed. Thus it is said: "Advancing when not ordered is as culpable as retreating when not ordered."

*Wei Liaozi* states: "When drums sound and banners wave, those who charge first are often men of great strength and valor—yet the fault lies with the general." This means that rewarding those who seize the initiative risks disrupting unity. Hence, night battles employ many torches and drums, while daytime battles employ many banners and flags—to alter the army’s ears and eyes.
Li Quan said: Torches and drums guide sight and hearing at night; banners and flags direct movements by day.
Du Mu said: The army’s ears and eyes shift with the changes of banners, flags, torches, and drums.

Some ask: What is the purpose of using many torches and drums in night battles? After dark, there can be no open-field formations or prearranged engagements. If one raids an enemy camp with drums and torches, it only alerts the enemy’s ears and illuminates their eyes—turning harm upon oneself. What is the principle here?

The answer: A profound question indeed. This is Sunzi’s subtle intent. Night battles occur when the enemy raids our camp, and we are forced to engage. The method lies in the art of encampment, which resembles small-scale formations. As the records say: "When stationary, it is a camp; when moving, it is a formation." Within a great formation, smaller formations are nested; within a great camp, smaller camps are nested. The armies of the front, rear, left, and right each have their own encircling camps. The general’s camp lies at the center, surrounded by the others, arranged in interlocking rings, their curves and angles aligned like the constellations of the celestial wall. Camps are spaced no more than a hundred paces apart, no fewer than fifty, with paths connecting them, allowing troops to deploy and ranks to form. Ramparts are within sight, enabling mutual support with bows and crossbows. At every crossroads, small forts are built, stocked with firewood, with hidden tunnels and scaling ladders for sentries.

After dark, if drums sound on all sides, torches are lit. Thus, if the enemy raids our camp at night, even if they breach the outer gate, they see only towering ramparts and smaller camps on all sides, each firmly defended. Uncertain where to strike, they hesitate. If the general’s camp or any small camp detects the enemy’s approach, they allow them to enter fully before sounding the drums. All camps respond in unison, and the forts ignite their torches, turning night into day. Soldiers in each camp close the gates, ascend the ramparts, and look down upon the enemy, loosing volleys of crossbows and strong bows from all directions. Even if the enemy had generals like Han Xin or Bai Qi, or troops like ghosts and spirits, they would be helpless. They need only fear that the enemy will not raid at night—for if they come, they are certain to be defeated.

If the enemy manages to infiltrate one camp, the surrounding camps light torches and send troops to encircle them. Orders are given within the camp: no one may move hastily. In an instant, right and wrong become clear.

If the raiders attempt to flee, they will all be ensnared in the nets. Thus, when Sima Xuanwang entered Zhuge Liang’s encampment and saw its intricate layout, he remarked: “This is the extraordinary talent of a master strategist.” Today’s camps, however, are built with open thoroughfares, merely secured with ropes to mark their bounds. Should raiders strike at night, ten thousand men would be thrown into chaos at once. Though many scouts may be deployed and defenses strictly maintained, once darkness falls, friend and foe become indistinguishable. Even with superior numbers, their strength cannot be brought to bear.

Chen Hao said: “Du’s claim that after nightfall, one must not array forces in the open and engage the enemy at an appointed time is mistaken. At the end of the Tianbao era, Li Guangbi advanced toward Heyang with five hundred cavalry, lining the route with countless torches whose flames stretched endlessly. Shi Siming’s army, though numbering tens of thousands, dared not approach—how could this tactic be limited to merely awaiting a night raid?”

Jia Lin said: “Fire, drums, banners, and flags serve as signals for both sight and sound, and thus their use differs by day and night.”

Mei Yaochen said: “The purpose of multiplicity is to confuse the enemy’s eyes and ears.”

Wang Xi said: “Multiplicity is meant to strike awe into the enemy’s senses, overawing them with our martial might and imposing qi.”

The *Tradition* states: “Use many drums and clashing sounds when campaigning at night.”

Zhang Yu said: “In all engagements with the enemy, at night keep fires and drums ceaseless, by day maintain an unbroken display of banners and flags. This is how to confound the enemy’s senses, leaving them unaware of how to counter our plans. When Yue attacked Wu, they arrayed their forces on either side of a river. Yue deployed troops in curved formations, advancing now to the left, now to the right under cover of night, drumming and shouting as they moved. Wu’s forces split to meet them and were defeated by Yue—such was the power of fire and drums to deceive. When Jin attacked Qi, its commanders sent scouts to survey even the most perilous mountain and marsh terrain, and wherever they did not go, they still planted banners and spread out their formations. The Qi ruler, unnerved, fled in haste—such was the power of banners and flags to deceive.”

Thus, the *Dao* of war holds: “The qi of the Three Armies can be seized.”

Cao Cao said: “The *Zuozhuan* states that at the first drumbeat, morale surges; at the second, it wanes; at the third, it is exhausted.”

Li Quan said: “To seize qi is to break their sharp courage.”

When Qi attacked Lu at Changshao, the Qi forces sounded their first drum, and the Duke of Lu prepared to engage. Cao Gui said: “Not yet.” After the Qi forces had sounded their drums three times, Cao Gui said: “Now.” They joined battle, and the Qi army was routed. The Duke asked why. Cao Gui replied: “In war, courage is all. The first drumbeat stirs the qi; the second weakens it; the third exhausts it. Their qi was spent, while ours was full—thus we prevailed.” This is what it means to seize the qi of the Three Armies.

Du Mu said: “The *Methods of Sima* states that battles are prolonged by strength but decided by qi.” When Qi attacked Lu and Duke Zhuang prepared to fight at Changshao, he was about to sound the drums. Cao Gui said: “Not yet.” After the Qi forces had sounded their drums three times, Cao Gui said: “Now.” The Qi army was routed. The Duke asked why, and Cao Gui replied: “In war, courage is all. The first drumbeat stirs the qi; the second weakens it; the third exhausts it. Their qi was spent, while ours was full—thus we prevailed.”

When the Jin generals Wuqiu Jian and Wen Qin rebelled, the imperial armies encamped at Lejia. Sima Jingwang advanced in silence, his troops holding wooden gag-bits in their mouths. Qin’s son, Yang, was eighteen and the bravest in the Three Armies. He said: “While their forces are still unsettled, let us scale the walls, sound the drums, and raise a clamor to strike—they can be broken.” After three such assaults, Qin’s forces could not respond. Yang withdrew, and they retreated eastward together. Jingwang said to his generals: “Qin is fleeing.” He dispatched elite troops in pursuit. The generals said: “Qin is an old commander, cautious yet bold. His troops have entered our lines without suffering any losses—he cannot be fleeing.” Jingwang replied: “At the first drumbeat, qi surges; at the second, it wanes; at the third, it is exhausted. Yang sounded the drums, yet Qin did not respond—their momentum is broken. What are they waiting for if not to flee?” Qin indeed withdrew.

Wang Xi said: “When shock and fear lead to weariness and slackness, the army’s qi is seized.”

He Shi said: “The *Huainanzi* states: ‘When the general is full of courage and scorns the enemy, when the troops are resolute and eager for battle, when the Three Armies’ host of a million soldiers is inspired as if reaching for the clouds, their qi like a whirlwind, their voices like thunder, when their accumulated sincerity overflows and their might presses upon the enemy—this is called *qi* and *shi*.’ The *Wuzi* says: ‘The deployment of the Three Armies’ host of a million soldiers, whether lightly or heavily arrayed, rests with one man—this is called the *qi* of opportunity.’ Thus, to seize qi, one must await the right moment and exploit the advantage.”

Zhang Yu said: “Qi is what war relies upon. Men cast aside their lives, shed their blood, and fight to the death without hesitation—this is the work of qi. Therefore, the method of using troops is this: if you rouse your soldiers so that superiors and subordinates share the same fury, their onslaught will be irresistible. When the enemy arrives fresh and their qi is sharp, first wear them down without engaging, then strike when they are weary—thus their keen qi can be seized. This is what the *Weiliaozi* means when it says: ‘When qi is full, they fight; when qi is seized, they flee.’”

Cao Gui spoke of the first drumbeat stirring qi to mean the enemy’s initial surge of vigor; the second waning and the third exhausting it refer to the fatigue of men after prolonged deployment.

Li Jing also said: “Defense does not merely mean fortifying walls and strengthening formations—one must also guard one’s qi and await the right moment. To guard one’s qi means constantly nurturing it, keeping it sharp and unflagging, so that the enemy’s qi may then be seized.”

“The general’s heart can be seized.”

Li Quan said: “Provoke their anger to disorder them, sow discord to estrange them, humble them to make them arrogant—thus their heart can be seized.”

Du Mu said: “The heart is what the general relies upon to command his army.” During the Later Han, when Kou Xun campaigned against Wei Ao, Ao’s general Gao Jun held the first pass at Gaoping. Jun sent his commander Huangfu Wen to meet Xun, but Wen’s words and manner were unyielding. Xun, enraged, had him executed and sent back his deputy. Jun, terrified, opened the city gates and surrendered that very day.

The generals asked: “We venture to ask—why did killing his envoy bring about the surrender of his city?”

Kou Xun replied: “Huangfu Wen was Gao Jun’s most trusted advisor, the one from whom he took counsel. When he came with words and bearing so unyielding, it was clear he had no intention of surrender. To spare him would have allowed him to carry out his plan; to kill him was to strike the gall from Jun. Thus the city surrendered.”

Later, during the Later Yan, Murong Chui sent his son Murong Bao to lead an army against the Later Wei. By the time Bao arrived, Chui was already ill. When Bao reached Wuyuan, Emperor Daowu of Wei cut off his approach, severing all communication between father and son. Daowu then deceived Bao’s messengers, ordering them to announce at the riverbank: “Your father is dead. Why do you not hasten home?” Hearing this, Bao and his brothers were seized by grief and fear, believing it to be true. That night, they fled in haste. Daowu pursued and crushed them at Shenhe Marsh.

Mei Yaochen said: “With changes in drums and banners, one may confuse and seize the enemy’s qi. Once the army’s qi is seized, the general’s heart may also be seized.”

Wang Xi said: “When clamor and chaos arise, the general’s heart is seized.”

He Shi said: “First, one’s own heart must be steadfast; only then can the enemy general’s heart be seized. Thus the tradition states: ‘He who strikes first seizes the enemy’s heart.’ The *Methods of Sima* says: ‘A steadfast heart and fresh qi prevail.’”

Zhang Yu said: “The heart is what the general governs. Whether an army is ordered or disordered, brave or cowardly—all depends on the heart. Thus, one who excels in controlling the enemy unsettles them to bring disorder, provokes them to cause confusion, and presses them to induce fear. In this way, their strategic resolve may be seized. The tradition states: ‘He who strikes first seizes the enemy’s heart’—meaning their fundamental resolve.”

Li Jing also said: “To attack is not merely to assault a city or strike a formation; one must also possess the art of attacking the heart. This ‘attack on the heart’ means constantly nurturing one’s own heart, keeping it calm and unshaken, so that the enemy’s heart may then be seized.”

“In the morning, qi is sharp.”
Chen Hao said: “The qi at first arrival is vigorous and keen—do not contend with it.”
Meng Shi said: “The *Methods of Sima* states: ‘Fresh qi overcomes old qi.’ Fresh qi is the qi of morning.”
Wang Xi said: “This refers to the initial fervor of the troops.”

“By midday, qi slackens.”
Wang Xi said: “As time passes, they grow weary.”

“By dusk, qi returns home.”
Meng Shi said: “Morning qi is the first qi; midday qi is the qi of renewed effort; dusk qi is the qi of exhaustion.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Morning marks the beginning; midday, the middle; dusk, the end.”

“This means that at the outset of battle, troops are sharp, but with time they grow sluggish and long to return home—thus they may be struck. Wang Xi said: ‘When weariness lingers and minds turn to home, there is no longer any principle of combat.’ Therefore, one skilled in warfare avoids their sharp qi and strikes when they are sluggish and retreating—this is the art of managing qi.

Li Quan said: ‘Qi is the courage of the army.’ Du Mu said: ‘Yang qi arises at *zi*, matures at *yin*, wanes at *wu*, and lies hidden at *shen*. Generally, at dawn when yang qi first flourishes, its onset is invariably keen—thus one must avoid it. Wait for its decline and hidden phase, then strike, and victory is assured.’

During the Wude era, Emperor Taizong fought Dou Jiande east of the Sishui River. Jiande arrayed his forces in a line stretching several *li*. Taizong, with a few riders, ascended high ground to observe and said to his generals: ‘The enemy has crossed perilous terrain with clamor—this shows their army lacks discipline. Pressing close to the city to array themselves reveals their contempt for us. Hold our troops back and do not engage; wait for the enemy’s qi to wane. Once their formation has stood long and their soldiers grow hungry, they will surely retreat. Strike as they withdraw, and what force could we not overcome?’

Jiande’s troops remained arrayed from *mao* until *wu*, their soldiers famished and weary, sitting on the rocks and scrambling to drink water. Taizong said: ‘Now we may strike.’ The battle was joined, and Jiande was captured alive.

Chen Hao said: ‘If troops arrayed at *chen* or *si* have not prevailed by *wu* or *wei*, or those arrayed at *wu* or *wei* have not prevailed by *shen* or *you*, one need not insist that only the morning is yang qi or that *shen* and *wu* are the phases of decline. When Taizong attacked Jiande, he ascended high ground to observe and said to his generals: “The enemy comes with all their keenness—we should briefly withdraw. If they retreat, our cavalry can hold them.” This makes clear that one need not wait for dawn.

In all cases, when the enemy possesses sharpness, avoid it thus; otherwise, do not.’”

Du Yu said: “Avoid their qi of sharpness and strike when they grow slack and long to return—this is the principle of managing qi.” This is what Cao Gui’s counsel meant. Mei Yaochen said: “Do not strike when qi is full; when it wanes and slackens, they are easily defeated.” He Shi said: “No one delights in danger or loves death. Driven without cause to the field of corpses, urged to rush onto the battlefield, their hearts harbor no stored-up anger or desire to fight. Yet once roused and goaded, they brave hardship without regard, defy peril without fear—only to regret and falter later. Even the cowardly of the world, when their hearts are stirred, will suddenly contend, no less than Zhu or Gui. Those who grasp blades and seek combat do so when qi rides high; when qi ebbs, they desist, remorseful and abashed. Thus, when the Three Armies view a formidable foe as though it were a maiden, it is because they have seized upon the enemy’s anger and stirred fury. At the siege of Jimo, five thousand men repelled the Yan army by exploiting Yan’s rage over mutilated deserters and desecrated tombs. The Qin warriors, twice our number, were spurred by three unavenged grievances—hence our slackness and Qin’s fervor. In both cases, qi was managed with skill, and the moment was seized. Zhang Yu said: “Morning signifies beginning, midday the middle, evening the end—this is not about time of day. In all men, qi is keen and sharp when first arrived, but after long deployment, weariness sets in and it wanes. Thus, the adept commander, when the enemy’s qi is at its peak, holds firm to avoid it, then strikes when they grow weary and turn to retreat. This is what it means to master one’s own qi and wrest the enemy’s qi.”

“With order await disorder, with stillness await clamor—this is the principle of managing the mind.” Li Quan said: “Watch for the enemy’s shifts and seize the moment.” Du Mu said: “The *Methods of Sima* states: ‘The root is a steadfast mind.’ To assess the enemy and secure victory, the mind must first be settled. Then govern it so that it remains calm and resolute, unshaken by events, unswayed by gain. Await the enemy’s disorder, watch for their clamor, then strike.” Chen Hao said: “When orders are inconsistent and rewards and punishments unclear, that is disorder. When banners are tangled and ranks clamorous, that is clamor. If the enemy is thus, attack.” Jia Lin said: “With our order, await their chaos; with our cool composure, await their clamor—this is managing the mind.” Thus, Taigong said: “Nothing is greater than certain victory; no method is greater than profound silence.” Mei Yaochen said: “Calmly await the enemy, and the host’s heart will be at peace.” Wang Xi’s note agrees with Chen Hao’s.

He Shi said: “A general, alone in person and singular in mind, commands a million men against a tiger-like foe. Amid the tangle of profit and harm, the chaos of victory and defeat, with ten thousand shifts of strategy unfolding in his breast—unless his heart is vast and his mind unclouded, how can he respond to change without exhaustion, handle affairs without confusion, face sudden peril without alarm, or engage the world without bewilderment? Our order suffices to await their disorder; our stillness suffices to await their clamor. Though a million enemies stand before us, we see them as petty bandits. When Ya Fu faced the foe, he lay unmoving; when Luan Zhen met the enemy, he favored discipline and leisure. What art did these two harbor? Their minds were settled and firm, their cultivation ample.” Zhang Yu said: “With order await disorder, with stillness await clamor, with composure await impatience, with endurance await rage, with severity await slackness—this is what it means to master one’s own mind and wrest the enemy’s.”

“With the near await the far, with ease await toil, with fullness await hunger—this is the principle of managing strength.” Li Quan said: “The dynamics of guest and host.” Du Mu said: “As stated earlier: ‘Draw the enemy to you without being drawn by them.’” Du Yu said: “With our nearness await their distance; with our rest await their fatigue; with our fullness await their hunger and emptiness—this is the principle of managing human strength.” Mei Yaochen said: “Do not exhaust human strength to your own detriment.” Wang Xi said: “To control excess with sufficiency is skillful management of strength.” Zhang Yu said: “With the near await the far, with ease await toil, with fullness await hunger, with enticement await approach, with weight await lightness—this is what it means to master one’s own strength and exhaust the enemy’s.”

“Do not intercept banners arrayed in perfect order; do not strike formations drawn up in full might—this is the principle of managing change.” Cao Cao said: “‘Perfect order’ means alignment; ‘full might’ means grandeur.” Li Quan said: “‘Perfect order’ means disciplined ranks; ‘full might’ means proper divisions.” Du Mu said: “‘Full might’ means fearlessness. Warfare adapts to the enemy; if the enemy presents such a front, do not strike—this is managing change.” When Cao Cao of Later Han besieged Ye, Yuan Shang came to relieve it. Cao said: “If Shang comes by the main road, we shall avoid him; if he follows the western hills, he will be ours.” Shang indeed came by the western hills, and Cao struck and crushed him. Mei Yaochen said: “When they come in perfect order and array in full might, showing no fear, they must have some unexpected maneuver.” Wang Xi said: “Though one might intercept and strike, seeing their disciplined and imposing display, one changes course.” He Shi said: “This is what is meant by ‘when strong, avoid them.’” Zhang Yu said: “‘Perfect order’ refers to ranks aligned in form and name.”

“Tangtang” refers to an expansive and grand formation. When the enemy presents such a display, how can one engage lightly? *The Military Regulations* states: “Advance when opportunity arises; retreat when difficulty is known.” It also says: “When strong, avoid them.” This speaks of the need to recognize adaptability. This is what is meant by the Dao of skillfully managing change to respond to the enemy.

Thus, the principles of warfare dictate: do not advance uphill against high ground; do not oppose an enemy descending from a hill. Li Quan said: “This refers to terrain.” Du Mu said: “‘Advance uphill’ means to attack upward; ‘descending’ means to rely on; ‘oppose’ means to meet head-on. If the enemy holds the high ground, do not attack upward; if they descend from hills to seek battle, do not meet them. This is because advancing from low to high exhausts one’s strength, while descending from high to low follows the natural momentum—thus, one must not advance or meet them.” Meng Shi said: “If the enemy arrays its forces with hills at their back, leaving no rear vulnerabilities, one should withdraw to level ground and not engage them.” Du You said: “If the enemy relies on hills or险阻 to array their troops and await battle, do not rashly attack. Not only is the terrain unfavorable, but there is also the danger of falling rocks.” Mei Yaochen said: “‘Do not advance uphill’ means if the enemy holds the high ground, one cannot attack upward. ‘Do not oppose an enemy descending from a hill’ means if the enemy comes from above, one cannot meet them head-on. The circumstances are unfavorable.” Wang Xi said: “In such unfavorable conditions, one must array one’s forces strictly and await developments.” He Shi said:

When Qin attacked Han, the King of Zhao ordered Zhao She to relieve them. Upon hearing this, the Qin forces advanced in full armor. A soldier named Xu Li requested to advise on military matters, saying: “The Qin did not expect our forces to arrive so soon; their momentum is fierce. The general must thicken our ranks to await them—otherwise, we will surely be defeated. Now, whoever first occupies the northern mountain will prevail; those who arrive later will be defeated.” Zhao She followed his advice and dispatched ten thousand men to rush there. The Qin forces arrived later and, unable to seize the mountain, were crushed when Zhao She unleashed his troops.

Later, the Northern Zhou sent generals to attack Northern Qi and besieged Luoyang. The Qi general Duan Shao confronted them and ascended Mangban to observe the Zhou army’s disposition. At Taihe Valley, he encountered the Zhou forces and immediately sent word to his camps, ordering his generals to form ranks and await them. The Zhou army, with infantry in the lead, advanced uphill to meet the battle. Duan Shao, seeing their infantry against his cavalry, feigned retreat while luring them forward, waiting until their strength was spent before sending down his dismounted troops to strike. As soon as close combat began, the Zhou forces collapsed and fled.

Zhang Yu said: “If the enemy arrays its forces on high ground, one cannot attack upward—the movement of men and horses, the release of bows and arrows, are all disadvantageous. Thus, Zhuge Liang said: ‘In mountain warfare, do not attack upward; if the enemy descends from high ground, do not meet them—the momentum is unfavorable. Lure them to level ground before engaging.’”

Do not pursue a feigned retreat. Li Quan and Du Mu said: “This is for fear of ambush.” Jia Lin said: “If the enemy suddenly flees before their strength is spent, there must be a hidden ambush. Command your officers and soldiers strictly not to pursue.” Du You said: “‘Feigned retreat’ means the enemy, while still in battle and with momentum unbroken, suddenly flees and arrays their troops—this must be a ruse. Do not pursue deeply. Thus, the *Tai Gong* states: ‘When troops are deployed in disorderly fashion, it is to create a diversion.’” Mei Yaochen’s note is the same as Du Mu’s. Wang Xi said: “If the enemy does not appear to be truly retreating, there must be deception—do not pursue.” He Shi said:

For example, during the Warring States period, when Qin’s army attacked Zhao, Zhao Kuo replaced Lian Po as general and resisted Qin at Changping. Qin secretly appointed Bai Qi as supreme commander. Zhao’s forces advanced to attack Qin, but the Qin army feigned defeat and fled, deploying two ambush forces to intercept them. Zhao’s troops, pursuing victory, chased to the Qin fortifications but found them impenetrable. Meanwhile, Qin’s ambush of twenty-five thousand cut off Zhao’s rear, while another five thousand cavalry severed Zhao’s supply lines. Zhao’s army was split in two, their provisions cut off. Qin then sent light troops to attack, and Zhao, faring poorly, built fortifications to await reinforcements. When Qin learned Zhao’s supply lines were severed, the king personally went to Henei to mobilize troops to block Zhao’s reinforcements and supplies. Zhao’s soldiers went forty-six days without food, secretly killing and eating one another. Kuo was struck by an arrow and died.

Liu Biao of Shu sent Liu Bei to invade northward to Ye, and Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun and Li Dian to resist him. One morning, Bei burned his camp and withdrew. Dun sent his generals to pursue. Dian said: “The enemy has retreated without cause—there must be an ambush. The southern road is narrow and overgrown; we cannot pursue.” They did not heed him. Dun and the others were indeed enveloped by the ambush. Dian went to rescue them, and when Bei saw reinforcements arrive, he withdrew.

In the late Western Wei, General Shi Ning was sent with the Göktürks to attack Tuyuhun. They reached Shudun, the former capital of Tuyuhun, which held many treasures. The Tuyuhun ruler had already fled to Hezhen City, leaving his Prince of the South and several thousand men to defend. Ning attacked but feigned retreat. The Tuyuhun forces opened the gates and pursued. Ning turned his troops around, seized the gates before they could close, and entered. He captured the Prince of the South and took all the men, women, and treasures, which he handed over to the Göktürks.

When Gao Cheng of Northern Qi ascended the throne, Hou Jing rebelled and defected to Liang, besieging Shan City. Cheng sent Murong Shaozong to suppress him. Before battle, Shaozong, knowing the Liang troops were fierce and fearing his own forces might waver, gathered his commanders and said: “I will feign retreat to lure the Liang forces forward; you strike their rear.” He gave strict orders. Jing also commanded his Liang troops: “Do not pursue beyond two *li*.” When battle was joined, Shaozong fled, but the Liang troops, ignoring Jing’s orders, pursued deeply into defeat.

The Wei forces, believing Shaozong’s words to be true, pressed their attack in fierce pursuit and thus crushed the Liang army.

During the Tang, when An Lushan rebelled, Guo Ziyi besieged Weizhou. The false Prince of Zheng, Qingxu, led reinforcements in three divisions. Ziyi arrayed his troops to meet them, having first selected three thousand archers and concealed them within the ramparts. He instructed them: “When I feign retreat and the enemy presses forward in pursuit, ascend the walls, beat the drums, and raise a clamor—let arrows and crossbow bolts fly together to drive them back.” When battle was joined, Ziyi pretended to retreat, and the enemy indeed took the bait. The gates of the fort swung open, and suddenly the air filled with war drums and shouts; arrows rained down like a storm, striking terror into the enemy ranks. As they rallied to pursue, Ziyi captured Qingxu.

Zhang Yu said: When the enemy flees in defeat, one must discern whether it is genuine or feigned. If their banners and drums remain in perfect order, their commands unified, and their formations—though retreating—are dense and disciplined, this is no rout but a ruse; surely some stratagem lies behind it. Do not pursue. But if their flags droop in disarray, men clamor in panic, and horses rear in fright, this is a true retreat. Do not press the attack with your finest troops.

Li Quan said: This is to avoid their fierce *qi*.
Du Mu said: This is to avoid their strength.
When the Duke of Chu attacked Sui, Sui’s minister Ji Liang said: “The men of Chu favor their left flank. You must take the left and avoid engaging their king. Instead, strike their right flank, where they have no strong commanders—surely they will break. Once one flank collapses, their entire force will falter.” Sui’s Junior Preceptor said: “To avoid the king is to admit we are no match.” They did not heed the advice, and Sui’s army was utterly defeated.
Chen Hao said: This advice is about evading the enemy’s strengths, not the principle of “do not attack with your finest troops.” The true meaning is this: when the enemy’s troops are swift and sharp, do not engage them at once; wait until they grow weary and lax, then strike. As the saying goes: “A thousand *li* away, their edge is unstoppable”—this is what it means.

Mei Yaochen said: Wait until their *qi* is broken.
He Shi said: As when the Former Lord of Shu led a great army east to attack Wu, and Wu’s general Lu Xun resisted him. The Lord of Shu advanced from Jianping, encamping in a continuous line all the way to the borders of Yiling, establishing dozens of camps. He used gold, silk, and titles to entice the tribes. First, he sent the general Wu Ban with several thousand men to set up camp on open ground, seeking to provoke battle. All his generals wished to attack.

Lu Xun said: "Liu Bei has advanced his entire army eastward, his *qi* at its peak and vigor unmatched. Moreover, he occupies the heights and defends the passes—difficult to attack at once. Even if we take a position, complete victory would remain elusive. Should we suffer defeat, our losses would be grievous. For now, we must encourage our officers and men, deploy our strategies broadly, and await developments."

When Liu Bei saw his plans were not succeeding, he led eight thousand concealed troops out from the valley. Lu Xun said: "The reason I did not permit our forces to attack Wu Ban was that I surmised there must be some clever ruse at play."

All the generals said: "We should have struck Liu Bei at the outset. Now, after allowing him to hold us at bay for five or six hundred *li* over seven or eight months, he has fortified all his key positions. Attacking him now will bring no advantage."

Lu Xun replied: "Liu Bei is a cunning foe. When his army first assembled, his thoughts were sharp and focused—we could not have challenged him then. Now, after such a long stalemate, he has failed to gain any advantage, his troops are weary, their morale broken, and no new strategies remain. Crushing this enemy is a matter for today."

He first attacked one of the camps but was repelled. Lu Xun said: "I now understand how to break them." He ordered each soldier to carry a bundle of thatch and set the camps ablaze, capturing them. Liu Bei fled under cover of night.

Later, during the Wei dynasty, the Wu general Zhuge Ke besieged Xincheng. Sima Jingwang dispatched Wuqiu Jian and Wen Qin to resist him. Jian and Qin requested permission to engage in battle, but Jingwang said: "Zhuge Ke has advanced deep into enemy territory, throwing his troops into a desperate position—his edge will not be easily withstood. Moreover, Xincheng is small but well-fortified; attacking it will not lead to its capture." He then ordered his generals to raise high ramparts and wear down the enemy.

After several days of stalemate, Zhuge Ke’s assaults weakened, and over half his forces were dead or wounded. Jingwang then ordered Wen Qin to lead elite troops to Heyu, cutting off the enemy’s retreat. Zhuge Ke, seized by fear, fled.

During the Former Zhao, Liu Yao dispatched his generals to campaign against the Qiang. Their chieftain, Quan Qu, led his forces to defend a perilous stronghold. Liu Yao’s general, You Ziyuan, repeatedly defeated him. Quan Qu wished to surrender, but his son, Yi Yu, declared before the assembled troops: "Last year, when Liu Yao came himself, he could do nothing against us. At dawn, he will press against Ziyuan’s ramparts."

His advisors urged Ziyuan to sally forth, but he said: "I have heard that Yi Yu possesses the bravery of Zhuan Zhu and the swiftness of Qing Ji. His father has just been defeated, and his fury runs high. Moreover, the Western Rong are fierce and formidable—their edge cannot be matched. Better to wait, letting their *qi* exhaust itself before striking." He thus fortified his defenses and refused battle. Yi Yu grew arrogant.

Ziyuan, waiting until they were unprepared, swore his troops to secrecy in the dead of night. They fed their horses and ate their rations early, then at first light, armed themselves, swept the camp clean, and emerged. By daybreak, he had set an ambush and engaged in battle, capturing Yi Yu alive on the field.

During the Wude reign of the Tang, Emperor Taizong led his forces to Hedong to campaign against Liu Wuzhou. The Prince of Jiangxia, Li Daozong, accompanied him. Taizong ascended the walls of Yubi City to observe the enemy and, turning to Daozong, said: "The rebels rely on their numbers and come to challenge us. What do you think?"

Daozong replied: "The enemy’s edge cannot be withstood. It is easier to break them with strategy than by force. Order our troops to deepen their defenses and raise their ramparts to blunt their momentum. These rabble cannot endure for long. When their supplies run out, they will scatter of their own accord. We may capture them without battle."

Taizong said: "Your thoughts align with mine."

Later, when the rebels’ provisions were exhausted, they fled under cover of night. Taizong routed them in a single battle.

Taizong also campaigned against Xue Rengao at Zhezhicheng. The enemy numbered over a hundred thousand, their troops’ edge keen, and they repeatedly provoked battle. The generals requested permission to engage, but Taizong said: "Our troops have just suffered a setback, and their *qi* remains diminished. The enemy, emboldened by recent victories, will surely advance recklessly. We shall close our defenses to break their momentum, then strike once their *qi* has waned. This is a plan of absolute certainty." He thus commanded his army: "Anyone who speaks of battle shall be executed."

After a prolonged stalemate, the enemy’s supplies ran out, and their ranks grew divided. Their generals surrendered one after another. Taizong, knowing that Xue Rengao’s forces were fracturing from within, said to his generals: "Now we may fight." He ordered General Liang Shi to encamp at Shallow Water Plain to lure the enemy.

The enemy’s great general, Zong Luohou, arrogant and fierce, had long sought battle in vain and was seething with frustration. Now, he threw all his strength into attacking Liang Shi, hoping to vent his rage. Liang Shi held his position and refused to emerge, blunting the enemy’s edge. Luohou pressed the assault with increasing ferocity.

Taizong, judging the enemy’s *qi* to be spent, said to his generals: "Their momentum is waning. We shall surely take them now." He issued orders for the generals to join battle at daybreak. He commanded General Pang Yu to array his forces south of Shallow Water Plain, emerging on the enemy’s right flank to bait them. Luohou concentrated his troops and engaged, nearly breaking Yu’s lines.

Taizong personally led the main army, sweeping down from the north of the plain in a surprise attack. Luohou wheeled his forces to resist, but Taizong’s troops, arrayed in a standard-and-enveloping formation, charged with a roar that shook the heavens. Luohou’s *qi* was shattered, and his army collapsed in rout.

Later, Li Jing accompanied Li Xiaogong, the Prince of Hejian, in a campaign against Xiao Xian. When their forces reached Yiling, Xiao Xian’s general, Wen Shihong, led tens of thousands of elite troops to encamp at Qingjiang. Xiaogong wished to attack, but Jing said: "Shihong is Xiao Xian’s most valiant general, and his troops are fierce and brave. Now, having just emerged from Jingmen, they have thrown all their strength into battle. This is an army fighting to stave off defeat—their edge cannot be withstood. We should anchor our forces on the southern bank and avoid clashing with them. Wait until their *qi* wanes, then strike with all our might. Victory will be assured."

Xiaogong did not heed his advice. Leaving Jing to guard the camp, he engaged the enemy and was indeed defeated, fleeing to the southern bank.

Zhang Yu said: "If the enemy advances with high spirits, their edge cannot be withstood. It is best to avoid them briefly and wait for their fatigue and setbacks."

When Jin and Chu clashed, the Chu forces pressed against the Jin army at dawn. The Jin officers were alarmed. Yue Shu said: "The Chu troops are swift and agile. We should fortify our defenses and await them. In three days, they will retreat. Strike them then, and victory will be ours."

Later, when Emperor Taizong campaigned against Xue Qigao, the enemy’s troops were keen and spirited, repeatedly provoking battle.

The generals all urged battle, but Emperor Taizong said: "We should first shut our gates and break their momentum. Wait until their *qi* wanes, then we may strike once and shatter them." And so it came to pass.

**Do not take the enemy’s bait.**
Li Quan said: "The Qin poisoned the upper reaches of the Jing River."
Du Mu said: "If the enemy suddenly abandons food and drink and retreats, one must first test it—do not consume it at once, for fear of poison."

During the reign of Emperor Wen of Later Wei, the Kumo Xi raided the borders. The court ordered Prince Xincheng of Jiyin to lead troops against them. The prince prepared copious amounts of poisoned wine. As the enemy drew near, he feigned retreat, abandoning his camp. The raiders arrived, rejoiced, and drank greedily. Once the wine took effect, the prince dispatched light cavalry to strike, capturing tens of thousands.

Chen Hao said: "This victory was no accident, yet it is no model for generals to emulate. Did Sunzi ever advocate poisoning men’s bellies? His words liken the matter to fish seeing bait—they must not bite. If the enemy dangles advantage, one must not covet it."

When Cao Cao fought Yuan Shao’s generals, including Wen Chou, his officers feared the enemy’s numerous cavalry and urged retreat. Xun Yu said: "This is how they bait us—how can we flee?" Thus, it is clear that "bait" does not refer solely to literal poison.

*(Note: The character 食 here may be a scribal error for 贪, "covet.")*
Mei Yaochen said: "Fish perish for coveting bait; armies fall for coveting bait. If the enemy uses troops to lure us, we must not take the hook."
Wang Xi said: "If they bait us with advantage, there must be hidden ambushes."

He Shi said: "As in the Spring and Autumn period, when Chu attacked Jiao and encamped at its southern gate, Marshal Qu Xia said: 'Jiao is small and reckless—recklessness means poor strategy. Let us cease guarding the firewood-gatherers to entice them.' They followed his counsel."

The men of Jiao captured thirty men. The next day, the Jiao forces rushed out, driving the Chu laborers into the mountains. The Chu troops stationed themselves at Jiao’s northern gate and ambushed them at the foot of the mountains, inflicting a crushing defeat. They forced Jiao to sue for peace before withdrawing.

Another example: the Red Eyebrows feigned defeat, abandoning their supplies and fleeing, with carts loaded with earth covered by beans on top. Deng Hong seized them, only to be routed by the Red Eyebrows. When Cao Cao had yet to cross the river and released his oxen and horses, Ma Chao captured them, allowing Cao to cross safely. Another instance: Cao Cao abandoned his supplies, which Yuan Shao’s generals Wen Chou and Liu Bei divided and took, only to be crushed by Cao. Later, during the Northern Wei, Prince Guangyang Yuan Shen used Bielie He to lure Tucheng, who came to raid but was defeated by Yu Jin’s ambush. These are all examples of the art of baiting.

Zhang Yu said: *The Three Strategies* states, "Beneath fragrant bait, fish must hang." This means that fish perish for coveting bait, just as armies fall for coveting advantage. Baiting troops does not merely mean poisoning food—anything that lures the enemy with profit serves as bait. Examples include Cao Cao using livestock to bait Ma Chao, supplies to bait Yuan Shao, and Li Ju using oxen and horses to bait Shi Le.

**Do not intercept a retreating army.**
Li Quan said: When soldiers long to return home, their resolve cannot be stopped.
Du Mu said: When Cao Cao campaigned against Zhang Xiu at Rang, Liu Biao sent troops to aid Xiu, cutting off Cao’s rear. As Cao prepared to withdraw, Xiu’s forces pursued, preventing his army from advancing. Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu then joined forces to hold the passes, trapping Cao’s army between them. Cao ordered a night operation to tunnel through the terrain, moving all supplies through the passage while setting up a surprise force. At dawn, the enemy, believing Cao had fled, pursued in full. Cao unleashed his ambush, and infantry and cavalry struck from both flanks, crushing them. Cao told Xun Yu: "The enemy cut off our retreating army and drove us into a death trap—this is how I knew we would win."
Meng Shi said: When men yearn to return home, they will fight to the death—do not block and attack them.
Du You said: Every man longs for his home and family—do not intercept them. Observe their movements and respond accordingly.
Mei Yaochen said: The enemy will fight desperately.
Wang Xi said: They will fight for themselves—do not block their path. If they harbor other concerns, you may intercept and strike.

When Cao Cao besieged Ye, Yuan Shang came to relieve it. His generals, believing Shang’s forces were retreating, advised avoiding them. Cao said: "If he comes by the main road, we will avoid him. But if he follows the western mountains, he will be easily captured." For if he took the main road, his resolve to return would be unshaken, but if he clung to the mountains, he would be wary of the terrain and filled with fear.

He Shi said: For example, when Cao Cao initially besieged Zhang Xiu at Rang, Liu Biao sent troops to aid Xiu, cutting off Cao’s rear. As Cao prepared to withdraw, Xiu’s forces pursued, preventing his army from advancing. The camps gradually advanced to Anzhong, where Xiu and Biao joined forces to hold the passes, trapping Cao’s army between them. Cao ordered a night operation to tunnel through the terrain, moving all supplies through the passage while setting up a surprise force. At dawn, the enemy, believing Cao had fled, pursued in full. Cao unleashed his ambush, and infantry and cavalry struck from both flanks, crushing them. Cao told Xun Yu: "The enemy cut off our retreating army and drove us into a death trap—this is how I knew we would win."

In the second year of Jianwu of Qi, the Northern Wei besieged Zhongli. Zhang Xintai, a military commander, accompanied Cui Huijing to relieve the siege. As the Wei forces retreated, over ten thousand remaining troops on Shaoyang Island requested five hundred horses to secure passage. Huijing intended to cut off their path and attack, but Xintai advised: "Do not intercept a retreating army—this is what the ancients feared. Soldiers in a death trap cannot be trifled with." Huijing heeded his counsel and let them pass.

When the Former Qin’s Fu Jian campaigned against Jin and was defeated at Shouchun, he retreated. In Chang’an, Murong Hong raised troops at Huaze, prompting Fu Jian to send Fu Rui, Dou Chong, and Yao Chang to suppress them. Fu Rui, bold and reckless, underestimated the enemy and neglected his troops. When Hong heard of his approach, he grew fearful and prepared to flee east of the passes. Rui rushed to intercept him. Yao Chang warned: "The Xianbei long to return home—drive them out of the passes, but do not block them." Rui ignored him. They clashed at Huaze, where Rui was defeated and killed.

Later Liang’s Lü Hong attacked Duan Ye at Zhangye but failed to prevail and prepared to flee eastward. Duan Ye proposed pursuing him. His general Juqu Mengxun advised: "Do not intercept a retreating army—do not pursue an enemy at bay. These are the cautions of military strategy. Better to let them go and plan for later." Duan Ye replied: "To release the enemy for a day is to invite regret too late to undo." He then led his forces in pursuit and was defeated by Hong.

Zhang Yu said: "When troops are abroad, every man longs to return home. To block their path is to force them into a desperate fight." Han Xin said: "What force can withstand men who yearn to return east?" When Cao Cao had defeated Liu Biao, he told Xun Yu: "The enemy barred my retreating army, and thus I knew victory was assured." Again, when Lü Hong attacked Duan Ye and failed, preparing to flee east, Duan Ye wished to strike. Someone admonished: "Do not intercept a retreating army—this is a military maxim. Better to let them go and plan for later." Duan Ye did not heed this, led his forces in pursuit, and was defeated by Hong. Many such cases exist among the ancients; they cannot all be recounted.

"When besieging an army, leave an opening." Cao Cao said: "The *Methods of Sima* states: 'Surround them on three sides, leaving one side open, to show them a path to life.'" Li Quan said: "When besieging the enemy, one side must be left unblocked to signal that the encirclement is not absolute. If you surround them on all sides, the enemy will hold fast and refuse to yield." Xiang Yu’s massacre at Waihuang and Cao Cao’s siege of Huguan exemplify this principle. Du Mu said: "Show them a path to life so they do not fight to the death, then strike."

During the Later Han, the sorcerer Wei Si’s disciples Shan Chen and Fu Zhen gathered in Yuanwu City, plundered officials and people, and declared themselves generals. Emperor Guangwu dispatched Zang Gong with several thousand northern troops to besiege them. The rebels had ample provisions and repeatedly withstood the attacks, inflicting heavy casualties. The emperor summoned the nobles and feudal lords to ask for a strategy.

At the time, Emperor Ming was the Prince of Donghai. He replied: "When sorcerers coerce one another, their power cannot last long; among them, there must be those who regret their actions. Yet the outer encirclement is too tight, and they cannot escape. If we slightly relax the siege and allow them to flee, even a single constable would suffice to capture them." The emperor immediately ordered the encirclement to be opened and the siege to be eased. The rebel forces scattered, and Shan Chen, Fu Zhen, and their followers were beheaded.

At the end of the Tianbao era of the Great Tang, Li Guangbi led the Shuofang army in battle against Shi Siming at Tumen. The enemy forces retreated and dispersed, and the encirclement closed in on all sides. Guangbi ordered the southeastern corner to be opened to let them flee. Seeing the encirclement open, the rebels abandoned their armor and fled in haste. Pursuing them, Guangbi annihilated their entire force. This, too, was the tactic of leaving one side open.

Du You said: "When besieging the enemy on open ground, one side must be left unblocked to signal vulnerability, so that their resolve to fight or hold fast weakens, and they waver between staying and fleeing. If the enemy is in dire straits and holds a strategic position, with strong reinforcements approaching from outside, then the encirclement must be made unbreakable—there is no need to leave an opening. This is the method of warfare."

Mei Yaochen’s commentary aligns with Cao Cao’s annotation.

He Shi said: "For example, in the early Later Han, Zhang Bu occupied the land of Qi, and the Han general Geng Yan led his troops to suppress him. Bu sent his general Fei Yi to garrison Lixia, while also stationing troops at Zhu’a and Zhongcheng. Yan first attacked Zhu’a, breaching the city before midday. He then opened one corner of the encirclement, allowing the enemy troops to flee to Zhongcheng. When the defenders of Zhongcheng heard that Zhu’a had fallen, they were seized with terror and abandoned their fortifications in flight.

Later, Zhu Hao and Xu Qiu jointly campaigned against the remaining Yellow Turban rebels. Han Zhong, who had occupied Wan, sought to surrender, but they refused. Pressing the attack fiercely, they failed to take the city. Hao ascended a hill to observe and said to Zhang Chao: 'Now I understand. The rebels are now completely surrounded, with our forces pressing in from within and without. Their offer of surrender was rejected, and they have no way out—this is why they fight to the death. Ten thousand men united in resolve are already hard to withstand; how much more so a hundred thousand? The harm is grave. Now, it would be better to lift the siege and concentrate our forces inside the city. When Zhong sees the encirclement loosened, he will surely sally forth. Once they emerge, their morale will scatter, and they will be easy to crush.' Soon after the siege was lifted, Zhong indeed came out to fight, and Hao defeated him.

Earlier, when Cao Cao besieged Huguan, he issued an order: 'When the city falls, slaughter them all.' Months passed, and the city did not yield. Cao Ren said: 'When besieging a city, one must leave an opening to show them a path to life. Now, my lord, you have declared their certain death, so they will defend themselves to the last. Moreover, the city is well-fortified and well-provisioned. Attacking it will only wound our soldiers, while holding the siege will take too long. To camp beneath a stronghold and assault an enemy resolved to die is no sound strategy.' Cao Cao followed his advice, and the city surrendered.

At the end of the Later Wei, Gao Huan of Qi raised righteous troops in Hebei. Er Zhu Zhao, Tian Guang, Erzhu Dulü, and Erzhu Zhongyuan—four generals—joined forces south of Ye, their elite cavalry and infantry numbering two hundred thousand. They surrounded Gao Huan at Nanling Mountain. At the time, Huan had only two thousand horses and fewer than thirty thousand foot soldiers. The Erzhu generals’ encirclement was not fully closed, so Huan tied together oxen and donkeys to block his own retreat. Thus, his officers and men fought desperately, striking out on all sides, and crushed the Erzhu forces.

Zhang Yu said: "Surround the enemy on three sides, leaving one corner open to show them a path to life, so they do not fight with desperate resolve."

Later, when the Later Han general Zhu Jun campaigned against the rebel leader Han Zhong at Wan, his fierce assault failed to take the city. He said to his officers: "The rebels are now completely surrounded, which is why they fight to the death. If we lift the siege, they will surely emerge. Once they do, their morale will scatter, and they will be easy to crush." The outcome was as he predicted.

Earlier, when Cao Cao besieged Huguan, he declared: "When the city falls, slaughter them all." After prolonged assaults, the city still did not yield. Cao Ren said to Cao Cao: "When besieging a city, one must leave an opening to show them a path to life. Now, my lord, you have promised them certain death, so they will defend themselves to the last—this is no strategy." Cao Cao followed his advice, and the city was taken.

'Do not press a desperate foe too hard.'

Du Mu said: "During the Spring and Autumn period, when Wu attacked Chu, the Chu army fled. Reaching Qingfa, King Helü of Wu was about to strike again. Fugai, the king’s uncle, said: 'A cornered beast still fights—how much more so men? If they know they cannot escape and are driven to die, they will surely defeat us. It would be better to let half of them cross the river before attacking.' The king followed his advice and defeated them again.

During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, Zhao Chongguo campaigned against the Xianling Qiang. Seeing the Han army, the Qiang abandoned their supplies and sought to cross the Huang River. The path was narrow and treacherous, so Chongguo advanced slowly. Someone said: 'We are pursuing an advantage too slowly.' Chongguo replied: 'They are desperate foes and must not be pressed too hard. If we move slowly, they will flee without looking back; if we press them, they will turn and fight to the death.' The generals said: 'Well said.' The barbarians indeed rushed into the river, and tens of thousands drowned, leading to their total defeat."

Chen Hao said: "A cornered crow will peck; a cornered beast will bite."

Mei Yaochen said: "A trapped beast still fights—this is the way of things."

He Shi said: "Lü Hu of the Former Yan occupied Yewang and secretly communicated with Jin. When his treachery was discovered, Yan generals Murong Ke and others led their forces to suppress him. General Fu Yan said to Ke: 'Hu is a desperate foe clinging to a desperate alliance. Now that the royal army has arrived, his forces are demoralized. Previously, Your Highness took advantage of the natural defenses of Guanggu, where defense was easy and attack difficult, and so adopted a long-term strategy. But the enemy’s situation now is not the same as before—we should attack swiftly to avoid the cost of a prolonged campaign.' Ke replied: 'Hu is an old bandit with much experience in upheavals. Judging by his preparations, he will not be easily overcome. Now, if we besiege him in this desperate city, cutting off his supply routes, with no stores inside and no strong reinforcements outside, within a hundred days, he will surely collapse. Why waste the lives of our soldiers for the sake of a moment’s gain?'"

This is called "triumphing without bloodshed on the blade, and securing victory by sitting still." Thereupon, he arrayed a long siege and held fast. After six months in all, Yewang collapsed, and Hu fled south to Jin, surrendering all his forces.

During the Five Dynasties, Jin generals Fu Yanqing and Du Chongwei passed through Ke’s northern frontier and encountered barbarian forces at Yangcheng. The tribesmen, a hundred thousand strong, surrounded the Jin army in the open wild. Deprived of water, the soldiers dug wells, wrung mud from their clothes to suck, and many men and horses died of thirst. Yanqing said: "Rather than be bound and captured, why not die for the state? We are now desperate." He then led his elite cavalry to sally forth and strike. Just then, a great wind stirred the dust, and they seized the moment to join battle—the tribesmen were utterly routed.

This was Yanqing, besieged by a hundred thousand barbarians, a desperate foe driven to the last extremity, who then exerted every effort to survive. The tribesmen failed to grasp this and so met defeat.

Zhang Yu said: "If the enemy burns their boats and smashes their cauldrons, coming to fight to the death, do not press them too closely, for the desperate will fight like cornered beasts." When the Jin army defeated Qi at An, the Marquis of Qi sought a truce, but the Jin refused. The Marquis of Qi said: "Let me gather the last embers and make one final stand before the city." The Jin, fearing this, agreed to the truce.

King Fuchai of Wu spoke of cornered beasts still fighting, and Han’s Zhao Chongguo said: "If you press them lightly, they flee without looking back; if you press them hard, they turn and fight to the death." These insights are close to the mark. Such is the method of using troops.

*End of Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Seven*

**Sunzi with Commentaries, Scroll Eight**

*Chapter on the Nine Variations*

Cao Cao said: "To vary from the norm is to grasp the nine applications."

Wang Xi said: Wang Xi believes that nine represents the utmost of numbers; the method of using troops must exhaust all variations. The *Lost Poems* say: "Nine variations return to unity." It is unclear what Cao Gong meant by "nine." Some say it refers to the variations of the nine terrains.

Zhang Yu said: "Variation" means not being bound by conventional methods—adapting to circumstances and acting as the situation demands. Whenever contending for advantage, one must understand the variations of the nine terrains. Thus, this follows the chapter on "Contending for Advantage."

Sunzi said: In the general method of employing troops, the commander receives the ruler’s mandate and assembles the army.

Zhang Yu said: This has already been explained in the preceding text.

Do not encamp in *pi* terrain.
Cao Cao said: There is nothing to rely upon. Land eroded by water is called *pi*.
Li Quan said: Low-lying land is *pi*; marching through it risks flooding.
Chen Hao said: *Pi* means low and depressed. Kongming called it "the hell of terrain"—a place where the center is low and surrounded on all sides by higher ground.
Meng Shi said: If the land is too low, one may be trapped by the enemy.
Du You said: When selecting ground for encampment, one must seek advantage and avoid harm.
Mei Yaochen said: In mountainous forests, perilous defiles, or marshy wetlands—places where one cannot halt—there is nothing to rely upon.
He Yanxi said: The later section states, "In *pi* terrain, we hasten along its paths," meaning that in such precarious ground, one should swiftly depart.
Zhang Yu said: Mountainous forests, perilous defiles, and marshy wetlands—any difficult-to-traverse terrain is *pi* terrain. Since there is nothing to rely upon, one must not encamp there.

In *qu* terrain, establish alliances.

Cao Cao said: Form alliances with the feudal lords.
Li Quan said: A place where four roads converge is called *qu*; it is where one forms alliances with the feudal lords.
Jia Lin said: Forge alliances with the feudal lords to secure support.
Mei Yaochen said: In a land where four roads meet, connected to neighboring states, one must establish alliances.
He Yanxi said: The later section states, "In *qu* terrain, we strengthen our alliances," meaning one should solidify ties with the feudal lords to make them steadfast.
Zhang Yu said: In a land where four roads converge, surrounded by neighboring states, one should first go and form alliances to secure support.

In *jue* terrain, do not linger.
Cao Cao said: Do not remain long.
Li Quan said: A place without springs, wells, livestock, or firewood is *jue* terrain; one cannot stay there.
Jia Lin said: Valleys and perilous defiles with no passage ahead are *jue*; one must swiftly depart without lingering.
Mei Yaochen said: When first leaving one’s state and crossing the border, one should not remain even in *qing* terrain—thus, one cannot linger long.
Zhang Yu said: Leading an army beyond one’s borders into foreign lands is *jue* terrain. Such perilous and isolated ground is even more treacherous than *zhong* terrain, so one must not tarry or remain long.

In *wei* terrain, devise strategies.
Cao Cao said: Employ extraordinary tactics.
Li Quan said: Exploit the terrain to find a way through.
Jia Lin said: Surrounded on all sides by peril is *wei* terrain. While the enemy may come and go freely, our entry and exit are difficult. In such a place, one must devise ingenious strategies to prevent the enemy from becoming a threat—only then can one prevail.
Mei Yaochen said: Where the path is perilous and circuitous, one must employ extraordinary tactics.
He Yanxi said: The later section also states, "In *wei* terrain, devise strategies," meaning that in treacherous ground where one is locked in struggle with the enemy, one must use cunning and deceptive tactics to avoid harm.
Zhang Yu said: In terrain where the front is narrow and the rear is secure, one must employ extraordinary tactics. For example, when Emperor Gao of Han was besieged by the Xiongnu, he used Chen Ping’s ingenious plan to break free—this is a case in point.

In *si* terrain, fight.
Cao Cao said: Fight to the death.
Li Quan said: Placing troops in a place of certain death makes men fight for their own survival, as when Han Xin defeated Zhao.
Mei Yaochen said: When blocked in front and behind, one must fight to the death.
The above outlines the general principles of the nine terrains.
Wang Xi’s commentary on the first five terrains aligns with Cao Cao’s.
He Yanxi said: The later section also states, "In *si* terrain, fight," for in such a place, fighting swiftly to the death may bring survival. If one hesitates and does not fight, morale will falter, supplies will run out—what awaits but death?
Zhang Yu said: When there is nowhere to flee, one must fight to the death, as when Han Xin arrayed his troops with their backs to the river.

From *pi* terrain, where one does not encamp, to this point, the nine variations are discussed, though only five matters are addressed—this is to present the general outline. In the *Nine Terrains* chapter, the nine variations of terrain are discussed, and only six matters are mentioned—this, too, is to present the general outline.

All terrain has its configurations and variations. What is described in the earlier part of the *Nine Terrains* chapter pertains to its configurations, while what follows pertains to its variations. How do we know that the nine variations refer to the variations of the nine terrains? The later text states: "If a general does not understand the nine variations, even if he knows the terrain, he cannot gain its advantages." Furthermore, the *Nine Terrains* chapter states: "The variations of the nine terrains, the advantages of flexibility and restraint—these must not go unexamined." From this, the meaning is clear.

Having already discussed the nine terrains, why does this section again speak of the nine variations? Sunzi wished to expound on the five advantages, so he first presented the nine variations. The nine variations and the five advantages are mutually dependent in application, hence they are discussed together.

There are paths one must not take.
Cao Cao said: In narrow and difficult terrain, one should not proceed; if forced to do so, one must adapt.
Li Quan said: Some roads are perilous and narrow, where ambushes are feared—these must not be taken.
Du Mu said: When Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han sent Generals Ma Yuan and Geng Shu to suppress the Wu Ling Five Streams Barbarians, the army halted at Xiajuan (present-day Chen Zhou). There were two routes to take: one through Hutou was shorter but the waters were treacherous; the other through Chongdao was level but the supply lines were long. The emperor was initially uncertain. When the army arrived, Geng Shu wished to take Chongdao, but Ma Yuan objected, saying it would waste provisions. He proposed advancing to Hutou to seize the enemy’s throat, and the barbarians would be broken. The emperor approved Ma Yuan’s plan, and the army advanced to Hutou. The enemy held the heights and guarded the defiles, the waters ran swift, and the boats could not ascend. The season was hot and humid, and many soldiers died of plague; Ma Yuan himself succumbed to illness and died. Geng Shu wrote to his elder brother, the Marquis of Haotian: "I previously suggested striking Chongdao first. Though the supply lines would be difficult, the troops and horses would be effective. Tens of thousands of soldiers were eager to advance. Now, at Hutou, we cannot proceed, and the army is disheartened, dying in droves—this is truly lamentable."
Jia Lin said: *You* means "to follow." If a path is unfavorable, even if it is short, do not take it.
Du You said: In perilous and difficult terrain, one should not proceed; if forced to do so, one must adapt.
Mei Yaochen said: Avoid perilous and narrow paths.
Wang Xi said: Though a path may be passable, there are times one must not take it, for fear of ambush. For example, when Zhao She advised Zhou Yafu, he warned of ambushes in the narrow defiles of Xiaoguan and advised taking the route through Lantian, exiting Wuguan, and arriving at Luoyang—adding only a day or two to the journey.
Zhang Yu said: In perilous and narrow terrain, chariots cannot travel side by side, nor can cavalry form ranks—thus, one must not proceed. If forced to do so, one must employ adaptive tactics, as when Han Xin, knowing Chen Yu would not use Li Zuoche’s plan, dared to enter the Jingxing Pass.

There are armies one must not attack.
Cao Cao said: Though an army may be attackable, if the terrain is perilous and difficult to hold, lingering would forfeit prior advantages. Even if one gains the position, the benefits would be meager, and the enemy, cornered and desperate, would fight to the death.
Du Mu said: Do not attack elite troops, do not intercept retreating armies, do not press a desperate foe, and do not assault those in *si* terrain.

Should my forces be strong and the enemy weak, yet their vanguard arrive first, still I must not strike—lest I startle them into retreat. Such are the armies one must not attack. This is to say: a general must know there are armies that cannot be attacked, and thus must refrain from attacking them, thereby demonstrating true adaptability. Hence its inclusion in the *Nine Variations*.

Chen Hao said: If seizing a minor advantage cannot overthrow the enemy, do not attack, lest you exhaust your troops in vain. Jia Lin said: When an army can be swayed by awe or conciliation, and its surrender is imminent, do not attack. When bandits are cornered and hold fast to perilous ground, attacking them will provoke a fight to the death—better to fortify your position and await their wavering resolve before seizing them. Du You said: Though an army may be attackable, if the terrain is perilous and difficult to hold, lingering would forfeit prior advantages; even if taken, the gains would be meager. Desperate and trapped troops, armies confined in narrow defiles—these must not be assaulted, for they will fight to the death. Instead, hold fast and await an opening.

Mei Yaochen said: To advance would yield no benefit. Wang Xi said: As Cao Cao observed, though an army may be attackable, if the terrain is perilous and difficult to hold, lingering would forfeit prior advantages; even if taken, the gains would be meager. I say: this also applies to baited troops, elite soldiers, orderly banners, and imposing battle formations. Zhang Yu said: If letting them go incurs no loss, and defeating them brings no gain, then there is no need to attack. Furthermore, if I am weak and they are strong, if I am in the wrong and they are in the right, I must not attack. As when Jin and Chu clashed, Shi Hui said: "The men of Chu do not alter their virtue, punishments, governance, or rites—they cannot be opposed." To refrain from campaigning against them is akin to this principle.

There are cities one must not besiege.
Cao Cao said: A small yet fortified city, rich in provisions, must not be attacked. This is why I bypassed Huaféi and pressed deep into Xuzhou, capturing fourteen counties. Du Mu said: Cao Cao abandoned Huaféi unassailed, thus preserving his full strength to penetrate Xuzhou and seize fourteen counties. This is to say: when the enemy occupies a strategic position with deep moats, towering walls, and abundant stores, intending to stall my forces, besieging it would yield little profit, while failure would demoralize my troops—hence it must not be attacked.

During the reign of Emperor Shun of Song, the governor of Jingzhou, Shen Youzhi, rebelled. He had long amassed soldiers and horses, stockpiled resources, and commanded a hundred thousand troops with two thousand armored steeds. When his army reached Yingcheng, his aide Zang Yin advised: "The dynamics of attack and defense differ—this city cannot be taken in a matter of days. If we delay, our momentum will wane and our prestige suffer. Now, sailing downstream with full force, we may achieve victory in days. Once their root is uprooted, how can Yingcheng hold?" Thus the *Art of War* states: *There are cities one must not attack.* Youzhi ignored this. The governor of Yingjun, Liu Shilong, resisted him. Youzhi threw all his might into the assault but failed. His forces collapsed and fled; he entered the forest and hanged himself.

Later, Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou sought to dispatch troops to Heyang to campaign against Qi. The Minister of Personnel, Yuwen Bi, advised: "When deploying troops, one must choose the ground. Heyang is a vital choke point garrisoned by elite soldiers—attacking it with full force would be difficult to prevail. In my view, the bend of the Fen River, where the garrisons are small and the hills gentle, would be easy to take. No terrain is more suitable for military action." The emperor did not heed his counsel.

The campaign ultimately achieved nothing. Later, when launching another large-scale expedition against Qi, the court ultimately adopted Bi’s strategy and succeeded in destroying Qi.

From the third year of the Yuanhe reign to the present—thirty years in all—the state has launched four attacks against the enemy. The Wei garrison assaulted Nangong County in the enemy’s territory; Shangdang attacked Lincheng County; and Taiyuan struck Hexing Fort. These three enemy strongholds boasted deep moats and sturdy walls, and their granaries, rice, salt, metal, charcoal, hemp, grease—every resource needed for defense—were always stockpiled in quantities that rendered them invincible. When our forces struck, the assaults failed to breach the defenses. Exhausted and depleted, they faced the enemy’s reinforcements arriving with fresh troops, and so suffered defeat in every battle. Thus, over thirty years, draining the realm’s strength and manpower to besiege a foe numbering in the tens of thousands, encircling their territory for a cumulative decade, the campaigns yielded not a single foot of gain. The reason: they consistently fell into the enemy’s traps, unable to adapt to changing circumstances.

Jia Lin said: "Even a city defended by loyal and resolute officers who hold fast to their orders must not be attacked."
Mei Yaochen said: "Because it would bring harm."
Wang Xi said: "Though a city may not be strategically vital and thus attackable, one must still fear blunting one’s forces and dulling one’s edge. Or, though the defenses may not be impregnable, if the defenders fight to the death, and even if victory seems assured, should relief forces arrive, the gains would not outweigh the losses."
Zhang Yu said: "If capturing a city cannot be held, or abandoning it poses no threat, then it need not be attacked. Furthermore, if despite deep moats and high ramparts the city cannot be taken, it must not be attacked. As when Shi Gai requested to attack Biyang, and Xun Yu said: 'The city is small but well-fortified. To conquer it would be unworthy; to fail would invite ridicule.'"

**There are lands one must not contest.**
Cao Cao said: "Territory of minor advantage—if contending for it risks losing it, then do not contest it."
Du Mu said: "Such lands are difficult to hold once taken, and losing them brings no harm."
Wu Zixu warned King Fuchai: "If we attack Qi and seize its land, it will be as barren as stone fields."
When Tao Kan was stationed in Wuchang during the Eastern Jin, some advised that the north bank’s Zhu City should be garrisoned with a detachment. Tao never responded, yet the suggestions persisted. One day, he crossed the river to hunt, gathering his officers and saying: "The reason I establish defenses against the enemy is precisely because of the Yangtze. Zhu City lies isolated on the north bank, with no internal support and bordered by barbarian tribes. The tribes covet its wealth, and if we demand tribute, they will not endure it. This would invite the enemy to strike us—thus becoming the cause of disaster, not its prevention. Even if we garrisoned troops there, it would bring no benefit to the south bank. And should the Jie barbarians find an opportunity to exploit, it would be of no use to us." Later, Yu Liang stationed troops there and suffered a crushing defeat.
Mei Yaochen said: "Because gaining it brings no benefit."
Wang Xi said: "Such lands may be strategically vital but already occupied by the enemy, or gaining them would be useless—difficult to hold, for instance."
Zhang Yu said: "If gaining a land offers no advantage in battle, and losing it brings no harm, then do not contest it. Likewise, distant lands, even if taken, will never truly belong to you, and so must not be contested. As when the King of Wu attacked Qi, Wu Yuan warned: 'Gaining land from Qi would be like acquiring stone fields. Better to turn our efforts toward Yue.' The king did not heed him and was ultimately destroyed by Yue."

**There are orders from the sovereign one must not obey.**
Cao Cao said: "If it benefits the situation, do not adhere to the sovereign’s orders."
Li Quan said: "If it benefits the situation, do not adhere to the sovereign’s orders. Examples include Tian Rangju executing Zhuang Jia and Wei Jiang putting Yang Gan to death."
Du Mu said: "As the *Weiliaozi* states: 'War is an inauspicious instrument; contention, a perverse virtue. The general is an office of death. Above, there is no heaven; below, no earth; ahead, no enemy; behind, no sovereign.'"
Jia Lin said: "When decisive victory is assured, one must not defer to the sovereign’s orders. If it benefits the state, acting independently is permissible."
Meng Shi said: "With no enemy ahead and no sovereign behind, matters beyond the frontier are decided by the general."
Mei Yaochen said: "Act according to what is fitting."
These, then, are the five advantages.

Zhang Yu said: "If it benefits the situation, do not obey the sovereign’s orders. As the *Gai Wang* states: 'See what is right and act without waiting for orders.'"

From "There are roads one must not travel" to this point constitute the five advantages. Some say: from "Do not camp on devastated ground" to "There are lands one must not contest" comprise the nine variations. These nine matters all require adapting to circumstances rather than rigid adherence to central directives, hence they are summarized under "There are orders from the sovereign one must not obey."

Thus, a general who understands the advantages of the nine variations knows how to employ troops.
Li Quan said: "This refers to the nine matters above."
Du You said: "The variations of these nine matters all require adapting to circumstances rather than following conventional methods, hence they are called 'variations.'"
Jia Lin said: "The nine variations refer to the general’s responsibility to exercise discretion. Adapting to circumstances and seizing opportunities, not bound by convention, one thereby attains the benefits of flexibility."
Mei Yaochen said: "Mastering the dynamics of the nine terrains and transforming them into advantages."
Wang Xi said: "Only the wise and capable can fully grasp the variations of circumstances."
He Shi said: "Sunzi titled this chapter 'Nine Variations,' yet commentators number over ten, none of whom enumerate the nine variations. Why? From 'Do not camp on devastated ground' onward to 'There are orders from the sovereign one must not obey,' the count reaches ten, inevitably causing confusion. Upon close examination of the text’s intent, it merely describes the advantages and disadvantages of terrain. Moreover, among these ten matters, 'There are orders from the sovereign one must not obey' clearly does not pertain to terrain, standing apart as an obvious outlier. Sunzi’s meaning, I believe, is this: whenever a general receives his commission and assembles his forces, should he encounter any of these nine terrains where harm outweighs benefit, he must adapt—even if the sovereign’s orders command him to camp, stay, attack, or contest, he must not obey."

Moreover, the subsequent text states: "If a general is not versed in the advantages of the nine variations, even though he knows the terrain, he cannot gain the benefits of the land." How could the sovereign’s commands be weighed equally with terrain? Furthermore, in the *Terrain* chapter below, it says: "If the Way of battle ensures victory, though the ruler orders ‘Do not fight,’ one may fight. If the Way of battle does not ensure victory, though the ruler orders ‘Fight,’ one may not fight." The essence of the matter lies entirely here.

Zhang Yu says: "One who alters the constant Way to secure its advantages understands the art of war. If a general is not versed in the advantages of the nine variations, even though he knows the terrain, he cannot gain the benefits of the land."

Jia Lin says: "Though he knows the terrain, if his mind lacks adaptability, not only will he fail to gain its benefits, but he may also suffer harm. The general’s excellence lies in his ability to adapt."

Mei Yaochen says: "Knowing the land but not its variations—how can one gain the land’s benefits?"

Zhang Yu says: "All terrain has form and variation. Knowing the form but not the variation—how can one gain the land’s benefits? If one commands troops without mastering the techniques of the nine variations, even if he knows the five advantages, he cannot employ men effectively."

Cao Cao says: "This refers to the five matters below." The nine variations are also called the five variations.

Jia Lin says: "The five advantages and five variations are included within the nine variations. When encountering circumstances, if one can adapt, then advantage remains; if one cannot adapt, harm befalls men. Thus, there is no fixed form. Only by fully grasping this principle can one employ men effectively."

The five variations are:
- Though the route is near, if one knows there are dangers, ambushes, or hidden perils, one does not take it;
- Though the enemy may be struck, if one knows they are desperate or will fight to the death, one does not strike;
- Though a city appears isolated and vulnerable, if one knows it has ample supplies, sharp troops, a wise general, or loyal ministers, one does not attack;
- Though the land may be contested, if one knows it is difficult to hold, offers no benefit, or risks being seized and causing harm, one does not contest it;
- Though the sovereign’s command seems fitting, if one knows it brings internal discord or disadvantage, one does not accept it.

These five variations require timely adaptation and cannot be predetermined.

Those who covet the five advantages:
- Take the near route;
- Strike the isolated enemy;
- Attack the vulnerable city;
- Contend for the obtainable land;
- Accept commands when the army is usable.

Coveting these five advantages without understanding their variations not only fails to employ men effectively but also leads to military defeat and harm to troops.

Mei Yaochen says: "Knowing advantage but not variation—how can one employ men?"

Wang Xi says: "Though one knows the advantages of the five terrains, without understanding their variations, it is like tuning a zither with glued pegs."

Zhang Yu says: "All warfare involves advantage and variation. Knowing advantage but not variation—how can one employ men effectively?" Cao Cao’s reference to the five matters as the five advantages pertains to the five matters under the nine variations, not the five matters mixed among the advantages and disadvantages below.

Thus, the considerations of the wise must intermingle advantage and harm.

Cao Cao says: "In advantage, think of harm; in harm, think of advantage. When facing difficulties, exercise discretion."

Li Quan says: "Consider both harm to the enemy and benefit to oneself."

Jia Lin says: "Intermingle one for kinship, one for difficulty. Advantage and harm are intertwined; the wise deliberate and act cautiously to secure benefit."

Mei Yaochen echoes Cao Cao’s annotation.

Wang Xi says: "A general versed in the nine variations fully comprehends advantage and harm."

Zhang Yu says: "The wise, in considering matters, though in advantageous terrain, must contemplate potential harm; though in harmful terrain, must contemplate potential advantage. This is also what is meant by adapting to change."

When advantage is intermingled, tasks can be trusted.

Cao Cao says: "If calculations show the enemy cannot use the five terrains to harm me, the tasks at hand can be trusted."

Du Mu says: "‘Trusted’ means to extend. If I seek advantage from the enemy, I must not only see the enemy’s advantages but first weigh the ways the enemy may harm me. Only after intermingling and assessing these can the tasks I undertake be extended."

Jia Lin says: "In times of advantage, contemplate harm to act cautiously. Alternatively: act by intermingling harm with advantage, enforce discipline with authority, and punish with severity. If one’s resolve is unwavering, all tasks will be trusted, and none will dare deceive."

Mei Yaochen says: "Intermingling harm with advantage makes action feasible."

Wang Xi says: "Exhausting all advantages ensures victory."

Zhang Yu says: "Weighing harm against advantage allows one to advance one’s affairs." When Zheng defeated Cai, the people of the state rejoiced. Only Zichan was fearful, saying: "A small state with no civil virtue but military success—nothing could be worse." Later, Chu indeed attacked Zheng. This is an example of considering harm in advantage.

When harm is intermingled, troubles can be resolved.

Cao Cao says: "Having weighed advantage, one must also consider harm. Even with troubles, they can be resolved."

Li Quan says: "The wise, in pursuing matters of advantage and harm, must align with the Way and not reach extremes."

Du Mu says: "To resolve the enemy’s troubles, one must not only see how the enemy may harm me but also weigh how I may gain advantage over the enemy. Only after intermingling and assessing these can troubles be resolved. Thus, the preceding text states: 'The considerations of the wise must intermingle advantage and harm.' For example, if the enemy besieges me, merely breaking out may lead to laxity and pursuit. Better to rouse the troops to fight fiercely, using the advantage of victory to break the siege. One example suffices to illustrate the rest."

Jia Lin says: "In times of harm, contemplate advantage to avoid harm. Thus, placing troops in death ground brings life; casting them into doom brings survival—such is the resolution of trouble."

Mei Yaochen says: "Intermingling advantage with harm dissolves misfortune."

Wang Xi says: "Understanding all harms prevents defeat."

He Shi says: "Advantage and harm give rise to one another; the enlightened constantly deliberate."

Zhang Yu says: "By weighing advantage against harm, one can resolve one’s own difficulties. When Zhang Fang entered Luoyang, he suffered repeated defeats. Some advised him to flee under cover of night, but Fang said: 'The sharpness or dullness of troops is a constant—what matters is turning defeat into victory.' That night, he stealthily advanced to press the enemy and achieved a swift victory. This is an example of contemplating advantage amid harm.

Thus, one bends the feudal lords by means of harm.
Cao Cao says: "Harm what they detest."
Li Quan says: "Harm their governance."
Du Mu says: *Wù* is pronounced as in *yīlù*.
If the enemy has something they detest, and I can exploit and harm it without missing the opportunity, I can bend them to my will.
Jia Lin says: "The methods of inflicting harm are not confined to one path. One may speak of their worthy and wise ministers, causing them to lose their counselors; or send them treacherous men to disrupt their governance; or employ cunning deceit to sow discord between ruler and ministers; or dispatch skilled artisans to exhaust their people and deplete their wealth; or introduce licentious pleasures to corrupt their customs; or present them with beautiful women to confuse and disorder their minds. If these schemes can be secretly executed with hidden plans that do not leak, they will all harm the enemy and bend them to submission."
Mei Yaochen says: "Control them with harm, and they will yield."
Wang Xi says: "Drive them into a position of certain harm, leaving no escape."
Zhang Yu says: "Force them into a position where they must accept harm, and they will submit of themselves. Alternatively, sow distrust between ruler and ministers, or exhaust their people through labor, thereby harming them. Such was Wei Xiaokuan’s estrangement of Hulü Guang, or Gao Lei’s strategy in the conquest of Chen."

One employs the feudal lords through tasks.
Cao Cao says: "Tasks are affairs; exhaust them with toil, as when they enter, we exit, and when they exit, we enter."
Li Quan says: "Burden their agriculture."
Du Mu says: "To labor the enemy is to keep them from rest. One must first have one’s own affairs in order. Affairs refer to a numerous army, a wealthy state, a harmonious people, and effective commands."
Du You says: "To employ the feudal lords through tasks is to keep their people from ease. Examples include the Han forcing the Qin to dig canals."
Or one may entice them with extraordinary skills, extravagant crafts, or excessive abilities, causing them to indulge and become inwardly enslaved. Such are the means to weary the feudal lords."
Mei Yaochen says: "Harass them with tasks, and they will be worn down."
Wang Xi says: "Always appear to be preparing for attack, thereby exhausting the enemy."
Tian Chang said: "Our troops have already been deployed against Lu."
Zhang Yu says: "By burdening them with tasks, one keeps them from rest. Alternatively, one may overawe them with the weight of one’s wealth and strength, thereby making them subservient. Such was the case when Jin and Chu were strong, and the people of Zheng hastened to serve them with sacrificial animals, jade, and silk."

One drives the feudal lords by means of advantage.
Cao Cao says: "Cause them to come of themselves."
Li Quan says: "Entice them with advantage."
Du Mu says: "By luring them with advantage, one causes them to come to me, falling into my plans."
Meng Shi says: "Trend means speed. Skillfully display advantage to make them forget caution and hasten to arrive, whereupon I create a change to control them. This is also called making use of others."
Mei Yaochen concurs with Du Mu’s annotation.
Wang Xi says: "In driving the enemy, one must always maneuver to my advantage."
Zhang Yu says: "Move them with small advantages, ensuring they must hasten toward them."

Thus, the principles of using troops are these: do not rely on their not coming, but rely on our readiness to receive them.
Mei Yaochen says: "What we rely on is unremitting vigilance."
Do not rely on their not attacking, but rely on our having that which cannot be attacked.
Cao Cao says: "Do not forget danger in times of safety; always be prepared."
Li Quan says: "Preparedness must never be lacking."
Du You says: "In safety, think of danger; in existence, think of perishing. Always be prepared."
Mei Yaochen says: "What we depend on is preparedness."
Wang Xi says: "Preparedness means solidity."
He Shi says: "The *Wu Lue* states: 'Even in times of peace, the gentleman does not part with his sword.' When the feudal lords of old met, their armed guards were never dismissed, for though there were civil affairs, there were always military preparations. How much more so when guarding borders and defending fortresses, in the midst of clashing blades? Generally, the reason troops prevail is by striking where the enemy is empty or vulnerable, or raiding where they are lax. If one remains strictly ordered throughout, the enemy will not come. As the *Zuo Zhuan* says: 'Without preparedness for the unexpected, one cannot lead troops.' Formerly, the Jin repelled the Qin by deepening their ramparts and fortifying their army, and the Qin forces could not long endure. When Chu was at Chen, the Wu forces arrived, saw they were prepared, and turned back. When Cheng Bu-shi commanded, he arrayed his troops in proper order, beat the night watches, and managed the military registers, so that the enemy could not encroach. When Zhu Ran served as military commander, though the age was at peace, he would drum the troops morning and evening, and those in camp would all don their armor and form ranks, so that the enemy did not know where to prepare. Thus, his sallies always succeeded. This is what it means to externally repel insult."

The best of the good is ever to dwell in safety while contemplating danger, to dwell in order while contemplating disorder, to be vigilant where there is no sign, and to guard against what has not yet arisen. In decision, nothing surpasses making their retreat perilous, clarifying their ranks and scouts, carefully securing one’s borders, and repairing and completing one’s moats and ramparts. One may increase the supply of military provisions or improve and augment one’s weapons. Thus it is said: "Without prior preparation, one cannot respond to sudden events." And again: "Only through attending to affairs can one be prepared; with preparedness, there is no calamity."

Always ensure that they are wearied while we are at ease, that they are aged while we are vigorous. This may be called seizing the initiative before others and possessing the mind to subdue the enemy’s forces without battle. As for Ju, which relied on its seclusion and was destroyed; Qi, which became complacent with its enemy and was annihilated; Guo, which took Jin lightly and perished; Lu, which attacked Zhu arrogantly and was defeated; Mo’ao, who was careless at Xiao Luo and lost formation; and the Wu ruler, who entered Chao and was reckless—all these may serve as warnings."

Thus, when we possess that with which to await the enemy and that which renders us unassailable, this is called the power of prior preparation.

Zhang Yu says: This means one must consider potential dangers and prepare for them in advance.
The *Tradition* states: "Without preparation against the unforeseen, one cannot send forth an army."

Therefore, a general faces five dangers:
Li Quan and Zhang Yu say: The five matters below.
**Being bent on death may lead to his destruction.**
Cao Cao says: One who is brave yet thoughtless, determined to fight to the death without flexibility, may be ensnared by an ambush.
Li Quan says: Brave yet lacking in strategy.
Du You says: A general who is foolish yet brave is a liability.
Huang Shigong says: The brave act on their will; the foolish disregard their lives.
Wuzi says: When people assess a general, they often focus on bravery—yet bravery is but one small part of generalship. The truly brave may act rashly, and if they do so without regard for advantage, they are unfit to lead.
Mei Yaochen concurs with Li Quan’s annotation. He Shi says: The *Methods of the Sima* states: "To die without victory is inferior." This emphasizes the supremacy of strategy.
Zhang Yu says: A general who is brave yet unstrategic, determined to fight to the death, cannot be matched in direct combat. Instead, one should lure him with an ambush and strike. Thus, the *Methods of the Sima* states: "To die without victory is inferior." If a general lacks cunning and merely leads his troops to die, he cannot prevail.

**Being bent on survival may lead to his capture.**
Cao Cao says: One who sees advantage yet fears the law and does not advance.
Li Quan says: Hesitant and cowardly, he may be captured.
Du Mu says: When the Jin general Liu Yu pursued Huan Xuan along the Yangtze and fought at Zhengrong Shoals, his righteous army numbered only thousands, while Huan Xuan’s forces were vast. Yet Huan Xuan, fearing defeat, kept a light skiff ready beside his flagship, so his troops lacked fighting spirit. Liu Yu’s forces seized the wind, set fires, and charged with all their might, routing Huan Xuan’s army.
Meng Shi says: A cowardly general, intent only on returning alive, avoids close combat. His troops lack discipline, and hesitation pervades his ranks—such a force may be swiftly struck and seized.
The *New Instructions* says: A timid general, seeing opportunity, cannot advance.
Taigong says: To lose advantage and act too late is to invite disaster.
Mei Yaochen says: Cowardly and irresolute.
Wang Xi says: Lacking fighting spirit.
Cao Cao says: Seeing advantage yet hesitating to advance.
Wang Xi adds: Fearing harm, he flees lightly.
He Shi says: The *Methods of the Sima* states: "To survive in doubt is perilous." Doubt is a grave danger.
Zhang Yu says: A general who is timid in battle, intent only on survival, may be overwhelmed by a sudden assault. When Jin and Chu clashed, the Jin general Zhao Yingqi ordered his men to prepare boats on the river in advance, intending to flee first if defeated—this exemplifies such folly.

**Being quick to anger may lead to his humiliation.**
Cao Cao says: A hot-tempered man may be provoked and lured into recklessness.
Li Quan says: An impetuous man, rigid in temperament, may be provoked into certain defeat.
Taizong killed Song Laosheng and pacified Huo Yi.
Du Mu says: "Anger" denotes hot temper; "quickness" denotes impatience, a lack of steadiness. If an enemy general is thus, he may be taunted into reckless advance and defeated.
During the Sixteen Kingdoms, Yao Xiang attacked Huangluo. The Former Qin ruler Fu Sheng sent Fu Huangmei and Deng Qiang to suppress him. Yao Xiang dug deep trenches, raised high ramparts, and refused battle. Deng Qiang advised Fu Huangmei: "Yao Xiang is stubborn and fierce, easily provoked. If we march boldly and press close to his ramparts, he will surely fly into a rage and sally forth—we may then capture him in a single battle." Fu Huangmei followed this counsel. Enraged, Yao Xiang emerged to fight and was slain.
Du You says: An impetuous man may be provoked to his death. One who is quick to anger, rash and reckless, disregards danger—such a man may be goaded into action.
Mei Yaochen says: Impetuous and easily moved.
Wang Xi says: A general must value steadiness; anger and impatience make him easily disturbed.
Zhang Yu says: A stubborn, impatient man may be taunted into action. When Zi Yu of Chu was hot-tempered, the Jin seized his envoy to provoke him, and he indeed pursued the Jin army, only to be defeated.

**Being overly scrupulous may lead to his disgrace.**
Cao Cao says: A man of integrity may be shamed into action.
Li Quan says: A proud and fastidious man may be humiliated.
Du You says: If the enemy fortifies his walls and strengthens his ramparts, seeking to wear down our forces, and we cannot remain, our advantage lies in swift battle. If we discern that their general is quick to anger, we may provoke him; if he is inherently scrupulous, we may shame him.

As when Zhuge Kongming sent a woman’s headdress to Sima Zhongda, seeking to provoke him into battle; Zhongda, enraged, wished to cross the river with his troops, but the Wei emperor dispatched Xin Pi bearing the imperial staff to restrain him. Even Zhongda’s talent could not overcome his fury—how much less might men of ordinary ability?

Mei Yaochen says: Heedless of all but reputation.
Wang Xi concurs with Cao Cao’s note.

Zhang Yu says: A man of purity who cherishes the people may be shamed and thus unsettled—this is certain. A man who cherishes the people may be wearied. Cao Cao says: Strike where he must go; one who cherishes the people will surely hasten by forced marches to their aid, and in rescuing them, he will grow weary. Li Quan says: Attack what he loves, and he will surely roll up his armor to rush to its defense; by loving his people, one may exhaust him with stratagems. Du Mu says: A humane man who loves others fears only slaughter; he cannot abandon the near for the far, nor weigh strength against circumstance. Whatever we attack, he will come to the rescue. Thus may we weary him, wear him down, and then seize our chance. Chen Hao says: There are battles that must be fought and others that need not. Xiang Yu’s relief of Zhao was necessary; the Earl of the West’s abandonment of Liang was not. Jia Lin says: A man of integrity dislikes plunder, a man of benevolence dislikes battle; shame and harass him, and his movements will surely fail. Mei Yaochen says: Exhausted strength leads to collapse. Wang Xi says: Send an unexpected force as if to attack a city; if he cherishes his people, he will repeatedly rush to their aid and thus grow weary. Zhang Yu says: Though the people are to be cherished, one must weigh advantage and harm. If he rescues every minor threat and aids every distant ally, he will be drawn where he must go and thus worn down and trapped.

These five traits are the faults of generals and the disasters of warfare. Chen Hao says: A good general is not thus. He does not cling to death, nor does he cling to life; he adapts to circumstance. He is not quick to anger, nor does he take shame to heart; when opportunity arises, he strikes like a tiger, and when it does not, he shuts his door. His movements and stillness are governed by strategy, not by joy or wrath. Mei Yaochen says: All are the general’s failings, the misfortunes of war. He [the commentator] says: Generals of talent are rare in any age, for their natures often err toward one extreme. Thus Sunzi, in his opening chapter, speaks of the general as possessing wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness—valuing their completeness. Zhang Yu says: Mediocre generals cling to one way and know no change; thus they bring calamity upon themselves and disaster upon their troops. The wise general is not thus: though brave, he does not cling to death; though cautious, he does not cling to life; though resolute, he cannot be shamed; though upright, he cannot be humiliated; though benevolent, he cannot be wearied. The overthrow of armies and the death of generals invariably arise from these five dangers—one cannot but examine them closely. Jia Lin says: These five kinds of men must not be entrusted with high command, for in warfare they will surely fail. Mei Yaochen says: One must be prudent. Zhang Yu says: One must understand adaptability and not cling to a single path.

*End of Scroll Eight of Sunzi’s Commentaries*
*Scroll Nine: The Army on the March*

Cao Cao says: Choose advantageous terrain and advance accordingly.
Wang Xi says: When marching, one must occupy favorable ground and observe the enemy’s situation.
Zhang Yu says: Only after understanding the nine terrains’ variations can one select advantageous positions for marching—hence this follows *Nine Changes*.

Sunzi says: In all matters of positioning troops and assessing the enemy—
Wang Xi says: Positioning troops has four principles; assessing the enemy, thirty-one.
Zhang Yu says: From "crossing mountains and relying on valleys" to "where spies may lurk" pertains to positioning troops. From "if the enemy is near yet still" to "one must scrutinize closely" pertains to assessing the enemy. *Xiang* means to observe and evaluate.

**Cross mountains and rely on valleys.**
Cao Cao says: Stay near water and grass for convenience.
Li Quan says: *Jun* refers to us; *di*, to them. By assessing their positions, the outcome of victory or defeat and the balance of power between us and them become clear. "Crossing mountains" means guarding strategic passes; "relying on valleys" means staying near water and grass. When arraying camps, first dispatch troops to secure defiles, then graze livestock and gather firewood before settling.
Du Mu says: *Jue* means to traverse; *yi*, to approach. When marching through mountainous terrain, one must stay near valleys with water and grass. Wuzi says: "Do not face the mouths of great valleys like celestial furnaces." This means one should not position directly before a valley but may stay near it.
Jia Lin says: When two armies face each other, one must act where advantage lies. "Crossing mountains" means spanning them; "relying on valleys" means staying beside them. Spanning mountains avoids rear vulnerabilities; relying on valleys provides water and grass.
Mei Yaochen says: If mountains block the front, rely on valleys for security.
Wang Xi says: *Jue* means to traverse; *yi*, to stay nearby. Cao Cao says: Stay near water and grass for convenience.
Zhang Yu says: *Jue* means to cross. When marching across mountainous terrain, one must stay near valleys—both for water and grass and to secure defensible positions. During the Later Han, when the Qiang of Wudu raided, Ma Yuan suppressed them. The Qiang held the heights, but Ma Yuan seized advantageous ground, cut off their water and grass, and refused battle. The Qiang, exhausted, all surrendered. They did not know the advantage of relying on valleys.

**Face the sun and occupy high ground.**
Cao Cao says: *Sheng* means yang.
Li Quan says: Facing the sun is *sheng*; being on a mountain is *gao*. One should occupy high, sunlit ground.
Du Mu says: One must position on high ground facing south.
Chen Hao says: If the terrain runs east-west, what then? Answer: Then face east.
Jia Lin says: *Sheng* means yang; "facing the sun" means having no obstructions. Position troops on high ground.
Du You says: *Gao* means yang. *Shi* refers to the ground before one. Position troops on high ground.
Mei Yaochen says: If on a hill, one must face the sun and occupy high ground for advantage.
Zhang Yu says: "Facing the sun" means facing yang; position troops on high ground.

**Do not ascend to engage when the enemy holds the heights.**
Cao Cao says: Do not advance uphill.
Li Quan says: If the enemy descends from high ground, do not ascend to attack them.
Du Mu says: *Long* means high. If the enemy holds the heights, do not advance from below to meet them in battle. Another version reads: "Do not ascend to engage when the enemy descends."
Jia Lin says: Battle favors descending; do not advance uphill.
Du You says: Do not advance uphill. This refers to the foot of mountains. If fighting at the mountain’s base, and the enemy lures you upward, do not pursue.
Mei Yaochen says: If the enemy holds high ground, do not ascend to fight.
Zhang Yu says: If the enemy holds lofty heights, do not ascend to engage. Another version reads: "Do not ascend to engage when the enemy descends." This means if the enemy descends to fight and lures you uphill, do not ascend to meet them.
Mei Yaochen says: When positioning troops in mountains, one must know these three principles.
Zhang Yu says: All elevated and towering terrain is called mountains. When positioning troops in mountains to resist the enemy, these three principles serve as the method.

**When crossing water, stay far from it.**
Cao Cao and Li Quan say: Lure the enemy to ford.
Du Mu says: When Wei general Guo Huai was in Hanzhong, Shu lord Liu Bei sought to cross the Han River to attack. The generals, considering their inferior numbers, wished to array along the riverbank to resist. Guo Huai said: "This would show weakness and fail to thwart the enemy. Better to array far from the water and lure them to cross; strike when half have forded, and Liu Bei can be broken." After arraying, Liu Bei grew suspicious and did not cross.
Mei Yaochen says: If water blocks the front, stay far from it to lure the enemy.
Wang Xi says: We cross the water—Cao’s interpretation is correct.
Zhang Yu says: When marching across water and halting, one must stay somewhat distant from it—both to lure the enemy to ford and to ensure unimpeded advance or retreat. Guo Huai arrayed far from the water, and Liu Bei, realizing this, did not cross.

**If the enemy crosses water to attack, do not meet them in the water; let half ford, then strike—this is advantageous.**
Li Quan says: As when Han Xin slew Long Ju at the Wei River or when Fu Gai defeated the Chu prince at the Qingfa.
Du Mu says: When Chu and Han contended, Xiang Yu personally attacked Peng Yue, leaving his marshal Cao Jiu to guard Chenggao. The Han army taunted him into battle, and Cao Jiu forded the Si River to fight. The Han army struck when half had crossed, routing them. *Shuinei* refers to the riverbank—*nei* was mistakenly written for *rui*.
Mei Yaochen says: If the enemy advances, meeting them at the water’s edge prevents their crossing.
Wang Xi says: *Nei* should be *rui*. Meeting them at the riverbank deters the enemy from fording; staying too far prevents timely advantage. One must act appropriately.
He Shi says: As when the Duke of Song fought the Chu at the Hong River in the Spring and Autumn period.

The Song forces had already formed their ranks, but the Chu army had not yet fully crossed. The Marshal said: "They outnumber us—while they have not yet fully crossed, let us strike." The Duke replied: "We may not." When they had crossed but not yet formed ranks, he was again urged. The Duke said: "Not yet." Only after they had arrayed themselves did he order the attack, and the Song army was utterly routed. The Duke was wounded in the thigh, and his palace guards were annihilated. The Duke of Song’s defiance of this principle led to his defeat.

When Wu invaded Chu, the Chu forces were defeated. As they reached the Qingfa River and prepared to strike, King Fu Gai said: "Cornered beasts still fight—how much more so men? If they know they cannot escape and are determined to die, they will surely defeat us. But if those who cross first believe they can survive, those behind will envy them and lose all will to fight. Strike only when half have crossed." His advice was followed, and they defeated the enemy again.

When the Wei general Guo Huai was in Hanzhong, the Shu lord Liu Bei sought to cross the Han River to attack. The assembled generals counseled: "Our forces are too few." They proposed forming ranks along the riverbank to repel him. Huai said: "This would show weakness and fail to break the enemy—it is no strategy. Better to array our forces far from the water, draw them in, and strike when half have crossed. Then we can shatter Liu Bei." After the ranks were formed, Liu Bei hesitated and dared not cross.

During the Wude era of the Tang, Xue Wanjun and Luo Yi defended You-Yan. Dou Jiande led a hundred thousand men to invade Fanyang. Wanjun said to Yi: "We are outnumbered. If we meet them in battle now, we will lose every time. We must use strategy. Order our weakest troops and feeblest horses to array themselves with their backs to the city, blocking the water to lure them. If the rebels cross and engage, I will conceal a hundred elite cavalry beside the city. Wait until half have crossed, then strike." His plan was adopted. When Jiande crossed the river, Wanjun crushed him.

Zhang Yu says: If the enemy leads their troops across water to fight, do not meet them at the water’s edge. Wait until half have crossed, when their ranks are disordered and their vanguard and rearguard cannot support one another—then strike, and victory is certain. Gongsun Zan defeated the Yellow Turban rebels at Dongguang, and Xue Wanjun crushed Dou Jiande at Fanyang, both employing this tactic.

For those who wish to fight, do not draw near the water to meet the invader.

Cao Cao says: *Fu* means "to draw near."
Li Quan says: If you meet the enemy near the water, they will not dare to cross and engage.
Du Mu says: If we wish to fight, we must not draw near the water to meet the enemy, lest they suspect we will not cross.
The meaning is the same as above, only the roles of host and guest differ.
Du You says:

"Fu" means "to draw near." Drawing near the water to await the enemy prevents them from crossing.

Mei Yaochen says: If you must fight, it is best not to be near the water.
Wang Xi says: If our advantage lies in battle, we should position ourselves farther away, compelling the enemy to cross and engage us.
Zhang Yu says: If we are determined to fight, we must not draw near the water to meet the enemy, lest they fail to cross. If we do not wish to fight, we should block their path with water, preventing them from fording. The Jin general Yang Chufu and the Chu general Zishang encamped on opposite banks of the Zi River. Yang retreated to entice the Chu forces to cross; Zishang likewise retreated, hoping the Jin army would cross. Neither side fought, and both withdrew.

When near water, occupy the high ground.
Cao Cao says: Even by the water, one must take the high ground. Face the water and position the rear against the heights.
Mei Yaochen says: By the water, one should also hold the high ground and face the sun.
Wang Xi says: Cao Cao states, "Even by the water, one must take the high ground." I believe this does not refer to ground near the water. The note below—"lest they flood us"—should likely be placed here.
He Yan says: "Shi sheng" means to face the sun and observe from afar. Encamping on high ground allows one to see the enemy’s movements from a distance, preventing them from approaching stealthily and catching us unawares.
Zhang Yu says: Whether arraying troops along the shore or anchoring ships on the water, one must face the sun and occupy the high ground.

Do not face upstream.
Cao Cao says: Lest they flood us.
Li Quan says: Lest they flood us. When Zhibo inundated Zhao Xiangzi and Emperor Guangwu routed Wang Xun, they defeated them by occupying the high ground upstream.
Du Mu says: Water flows downward; one must not encamp in low-lying areas, lest the enemy breach the banks and flood us. As stated above, "occupy the high ground." Zhuge Liang said: "In naval formations, do not oppose the current." This means our ships must not anchor downstream, for the enemy could then ride the current to press the attack.
Jia Lin says: In low-lying areas near water, the enemy may flood our troops or float poison downstream. "Ying" means "to oppose." Another interpretation: encamping against the current is taboo in warfare.
Mei Yaochen says: Do not station troops downstream to guard against breaches and flooding. In naval battles, facing upstream is also disadvantageous.
Wang Xi says: One should take the upstream position. When Cao Ren of Wei campaigned against Wu and sought to attack the islet of Ruxu, Jiang Ji warned: "The enemy holds the western bank and arrays their ships upstream. If our troops enter the islet, it will be like entering a self-made hell—a path to destruction." Cao Ren ignored this advice and was defeated.
He Yan says: Fighting with the current is easier.
Zhang Yu says: Do not occupy low ground, lest the enemy breach the water and flood us. In naval warfare, one must also avoid the downstream position, for fighting against the current is disadvantageous. One must also guard against the enemy poisoning the water upstream. When the Chu minister resisted the Wu forces, divination foretold an inauspicious battle. Marshal Ziyu said: "We hold the upstream position—why should it not be auspicious?" They joined battle and prevailed. Thus, troops must occupy the upstream position. This refers to naval warfare.

Mei Yaochen says: When stationed by water, one must heed these five principles.
Zhang Yu says: All formations near water refer to naval warfare. When resisting the enemy on water, these five principles serve as the rule.

Avoid salt marshes; if unavoidable, depart swiftly and do not linger.
Chen Hao says: "Chi" refers to saline-alkali land where water and grass are poor, and quicksand makes encampment impossible. The *New Instructions* defines it as land where salt marshes do not yield the five grains.
Jia Lin says: Saline-alkali land often lacks water and grass, making it unsuitable for prolonged stays.
Mei Yaochen says: "Chi" means "remote." Such open, desolate terrain is difficult to defend, so one must not linger.
Wang Xi says: "Chi" means "saline." The land is broad and low-lying, offering no shelter.
Zhang Yu says: The *Book of Punishments* states: "Mountains and rivers, deep marshes, and saline lands." Yan Shigu’s commentary explains: "Shen" refers to deep water; "chi" refers to saline-alkali land. Thus, "chi ze" denotes barren, waterlogged, and marshy areas. Due to their damp, humid qi and poor water and grass, one should pass through quickly.

If forced to engage the enemy in a salt marsh, rely on water and grass and position the rear against dense trees.
Cao Cao says: If unavoidably meeting the enemy in a salt marsh...
Li Quan says: If swift passage is impossible, one must fight near water and with trees at the rear. Where there is water and trees, the ground will not give way or drown.
Du Mu says: Saline-alkali land where no grass or trees grow is called "flying blades." If suddenly encountering the enemy here, one must choose ground with water, grass, and trees to halt.
Du You says: Another version reads "with dense trees at the rear." If unavoidably meeting the enemy in a salt marsh, one should use the trees as a defensive barrier, for terrain aids the army.
Mei Yaochen says: If unavoidably meeting the enemy, rely on nearby water and grass, and position the rear against dense trees.
Wang Xi says: If unexpectedly encountering the enemy here, one must seek advantageous ground and use solid terrain as a rear guard.
Zhang Yu says: If forced to fight in such terrain, one must rely on nearby water and grass for firewood and water, and use the forest as a natural barrier. This refers to warfare in salt marshes.

Mei Yaochen says: When stationed in salt marshes, one must heed these two principles.
Zhang Yu says: When stationed in salt marshes, these two principles serve as the rule.

On level ground, occupy the open and even terrain.
Cao Cao says: This favors chariots and cavalry.
Du Mu says: On level ground, one must choose open, even, and stable terrain to encamp, allowing chariots and cavalry to maneuver freely.
Wang Xi’s note is the same as Cao Cao’s. He Yan’s note is the same as Du Mu’s.
Zhang Yu says: On broad plains and open fields—terrain suited for chariots and cavalry—one must choose flat, even ground without pits or depressions to encamp, facilitating swift charges.

And position the right flank against high ground, with the front low and the rear elevated.
Cao Cao says: This is advantageous for battle.
Li Quan says: All human utility favors the right, hence one leans against it. The front is "dead"—the enemy’s ground; the rear is "alive"—where we station ourselves.
Du Mu says: The *Taigong* states: "An army must have rivers and marshes to its left and hills to its right." "Dead" means low; "alive" means high. The low cannot defend against the high, so this is advantageous for cavalry and chariots.
Jia Lin says: Hills are "alive"; battlefields are "dead." Stationing behind hills stabilizes the army; facing low ground facilitates maneuvering. With high ground to the right, turning movements are smooth.
Mei Yaochen says: Choose level and open terrain for the convenience of chariots and cavalry. With the right flank against hills, one gains strategic advantage. A low front and high rear benefit combat.
Wang Xi says: All armies should face the sun. Since the rear is backed by mountains, the phrase "front dead, rear alive" may be an error in the text.
Zhang Yu says: Even on level ground, one must seek high mounds and position the right flank against them to rely on their strategic advantage. A low front and high rear facilitate charges. This refers to warfare on level ground.
Mei Yaochen says: When stationed on level ground, one must heed these two principles.
Zhang Yu says: When stationed on level ground, these two principles serve as the rule.

In all four types of terrain,
Li Quan says: The four are mountains, waters, salt marshes, and level ground.
Zhang Yu says: The four armies refer to those in mountains, waters, salt marshes, and level ground.
Zhuge Liang says: In mountain warfare, do not ascend to high ground; in water warfare, do not advance against the current; in grassland warfare, do not traverse deep areas; in level-ground warfare, do not charge into empty spaces. These are the advantages of warfare—the means by which the Yellow Emperor triumphed over the Four Emperors.
Cao Cao says: When the Yellow Emperor first established his rule, the feudal lords of the four directions all claimed the title of emperor. He defeated them using these four types of terrain.
Li Quan says: The Yellow Emperor first received the art of war from Feng Hou and then destroyed the four directions, hence the phrase "triumphed over the Four Emperors."
Mei Yaochen says: "Four Emperors" may be a scribal error for "four armies." It means the Yellow Emperor gained the advantages of the four terrains: victorious in mountains when in mountains, victorious on water when on water, victorious in salt marshes when in salt marshes, and victorious on level ground when on level ground.
Wang Xi says: "Four Emperors" may be a corruption of "four armies." Cao Cao says: When the Yellow Emperor first established his rule, the feudal lords of the four directions all claimed the title of emperor, and he defeated them using these four types of terrain. One version omits "also."
He Yan says: Mei’s interpretation is correct.
Zhang Yu says: When the Yellow Emperor first established his rule, the feudal lords of the four directions also claimed the title of emperor, and he defeated them using these four types of terrain. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the Yellow Emperor fought the Flame Emperor at Banquan, the Chiyou at Zhuolu, and drove the Xunyu north. The *Six Secret Teachings of Taigong* states that the Yellow Emperor fought seventy battles to pacify the realm. This confirms the existence of wars with the feudal lords of the four directions. The principles of warfare all originated with the Yellow Emperor, hence the statement.

An army favors high ground and dislikes low,
Mei Yaochen says: High ground is dry and airy, ensuring health and ease while providing strategic advantage. Low ground is damp and humid, breeding illness and hindering combat.
Wang Xi says: There should be descents, not ascents, and one must distance oneself from water hazards.
Zhang Yu says: Occupying high ground facilitates observation and maneuvering; low ground is difficult to defend and prone to illness.

Valuing the yang and disdaining the yin,
Mei Yaochen says: Yang is bright and favorable; yin is dark and adverse.
Wang Xi says: Prolonged exposure to damp, yin terrain breeds illness and damages weapons.
Zhang Yu says: The southeast is yang; the northwest is yin.

Nurturing life and occupying solid ground.
Cao Cao says: Rely on abundance. "Nurturing life" means facing water and grass to graze and raise livestock. "Solid" means high.
Mei Yaochen says: "Nurturing life" means convenient access to water and grass; "solid" means advantageous supply routes.
Wang Xi says: "Nurturing life" refers to resources like water, grass, and grain; "solid" means relying on defensible terrain.
Zhang Yu says: "Nurturing life" means grazing near good water and grass. "Solid" means stationing on elevated ground.

An army free of a hundred illnesses is said to be certain of victory.
Li Quan says: People stationed in low, damp places inevitably contract epidemics; only high, sunny ground is suitable for habitation.
Du Mu says: "Life" is yang; "solid" is high. Stationing on high ground avoids dampness and shade, preventing illness and ensuring victory.
Mei Yaochen says: Mastering these three principles guarantees strategic advantage and prevents disease.
Zhang Yu says: Occupying high ground facing the sun, nurturing life in abundant terrain, ensures victory. The dryness of the earth prevents epidemics.

For hills, embankments, and dikes, one must occupy their yang side and position the right flank against them.
Du Mu says: When encountering hills, embankments, or dikes, one should always station on their southeast side.
Mei Yaochen says: Even if not extremely high, one should face the sun and rely on solid ground to the right.
Wang Xi says: Occupying the yang side ensures comfort and harmony for the troops, and sharpness and utility for weapons.
Zhang Yu says: Facing the sun is prized for clarity; backing high ground provides security.

These are the advantages of warfare, the assistance of terrain.
Mei Yaochen says: The advantages of warfare lie in gaining strategic terrain as assistance.
Zhang Yu says: The benefits of warfare come from the aid of terrain.

If it rains upstream and foam appears in the water, those wishing to ford must wait until the water settles.
Cao Cao says: Fear that the water will suddenly rise mid-crossing.
Li Quan says: Fear of sudden flooding.
Du Mu says: When crossing a mountain stream and seeing foam upstream, it indicates rain in the upper reaches. Wait until the foam subsides and the water calms before fording.

If not, while halfway across, one fears the sudden arrival of a violent flood.
Du You says: Fear that the water will rise abruptly while halfway through the crossing.

When it rains upstream, the water should run clear, yet foam appears instead—this is an omen that the enemy has artificially dammed the water, intending to cut off the army mid-crossing. Whenever terrain holds water that may rise, foam arrives first, all serving to sever the army; one must wait until the water settles.

Mei Yaochen says: While the foam has yet to settle, fear a sudden surge.
Wang Xi says: When water rises, foam appears; *she* means wading on foot. Cao Cao’s explanation is correct.
Zhang Yu says: Before the crossing is complete, a great flood may suddenly arrive. *Mei* refers to the bubbles on the water’s surface.

In all terrain, there are six harmful formations:
**Absolute Gorge**—steep cliffs before and behind, with water flowing transversely through the center.
**Heavenly Well**—encircled by sheer slopes, where ravines converge.
**Heavenly Prison**—three sides enclosed and impassable, easy to enter but difficult to exit.
**Heavenly Net**—dense with grass and trees, where blades and arrows cannot be deployed.
**Heavenly Pit**—low-lying and muddy, impassable for chariots and cavalry.
**Heavenly Fissure**—two mountains facing each other, with a narrow, treacherous ravine between.

All six are noted by Mei Yaochen. One must swiftly depart and not approach them.

Cao Cao says: A deep mountain ravine with high water is an Absolute Gorge; a high perimeter with a low center is a Heavenly Well; a dense, overgrown mountain pass is a Heavenly Prison; terrain that can entrap people like a net is a Heavenly Net; sunken ground is a Heavenly Pit; a narrow mountain ravine, several *chi* deep and several *zhang* long, is a Heavenly Fissure.
Du Mu says: The *Military Records* state: terrain that is sunken and flooded is called a Heavenly Well; a narrow mountain ravine that can cut off passage is a Heavenly Prison; a broad, clear ravine of unknown depth, with muddy roads impassable to men and horses, is a Heavenly Pit; land filled with ditches, pits, and fallen trees is a Heavenly Fissure; forests and thickets that conceal are a Heavenly Net.
Jia Lin says: A deep, wide ravine that severs passage is an Absolute Gorge; a low-lying center is a Heavenly Well; terrain surrounded by ravines and water, with grass interspersed, where the center is uneven and entry and exit are difficult, is a Heavenly Prison; rugged roads, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow, with rough, constricted passage, is a Heavenly Net; marshy ground is a Heavenly Embryo; terrain with steep, impassable sides, narrow and long for several *li*, where passage is nearly impossible and can block entry and exit, is a Heavenly Fissure. These six harmful terrains must not be approached or relied upon.
Mei Yaochen says: If even approaching these six harms is unwise, how much more so is lingering?
Wang Xi says: I believe *Absolute Gorge* should be *Absolute Heavenly Gorge*, with the character *Heavenly* omitted. These six are all natural formations. *Prison* implies confinement like a jail, *Net* like a snare, *Pit* like a muddy trench, and *Fissure* like terrain riddled with gaps and crevices. When marching through such places, do not draw near; otherwise, one may encounter unforeseen dangers where neither wisdom nor strength can be applied.
Zhang Yu says: A deep, precipitous ravine impossible to cross is an Absolute Gorge; a high perimeter with a low center, where waters converge, is a Heavenly Well; terrain encircled by perilous mountains, with a narrow entrance, is a Heavenly Prison; tangled forests and concealed reeds form a Heavenly Net; muddy pools and mires that bog down chariots and cavalry are a Heavenly Pit; narrow, treacherous roads with many pits and hollows are a Heavenly Fissure. Whenever encountering such terrain, one should pass at a distance and not approach. If I keep my distance while the enemy draws near, if I face it while the enemy turns their back—
Cao Cao says: In warfare, one should always keep far from the six harms; if the enemy approaches or turns their back to them, then I gain advantage while they face misfortune.
Li Quan says: A skilled commander leads the enemy into harmful terrain.
Du Mu says: *Facing* means to turn toward; *backing* means to rely upon. When encountering these six harmful terrains, if I keep my distance and face them, my movements remain unrestricted; if the enemy draws near and relies upon them, their actions will be hindered. Thus, I gain advantage while they face misfortune.
Mei Yaochen says: Regarding the six harms, I should keep my distance while the enemy approaches, I should face them while the enemy relies upon them—then I gain advantage while they face misfortune.
Zhang Yu says: In these six harmful terrains, if I keep my distance and face them while the enemy draws near and relies upon them, then my movements are advantageous while theirs are fraught with peril.

When the army marches through terrain with perilous obstacles, stagnant pools, reeds, mountain forests, or dense thickets, one must carefully search and scout them, for these are places where ambushes and spies may lurk.
Cao Cao says: *Perilous* refers to uneven terrain; *obstacles* refer to abundant water. *Stagnant pools* are ponds; *wells* are low-lying areas. *Reeds* are where grasses gather; *mountain forests* are where trees cluster. *Dense thickets* are places that can conceal. The above discusses terrain; the following concerns assessing the enemy’s situation.
Li Quan says: The following cautions against the enemy’s hidden ambushes and deceptions.
Mei Yaochen says: *Perilous obstacles* are narrow passes, the domain of mountains and forests; *stagnant pools* and *wells* are low-lying areas where reeds grow. All are dense enough to conceal. One must thoroughly search them, fearing the presence of hidden troops.

Zhang Yu says: *Perilous obstacles* are hilly terrain where mountain forests thrive; *stagnant pools* and *wells* are low-lying areas where reeds flourish. All are dense enough to conceal. One must thoroughly search them, fearing hidden troops within. Moreover, one must consider that spies may lurk unseen, observing our strengths and weaknesses, listening to our commands—thus, hidden threats encompass two concerns.

When the enemy is near yet remains still, they rely on their terrain’s defensibility.
Mei Yaochen says: If near yet unmoving, they depend on their advantageous position.
Wang Xi says: They trust in their terrain and thus feel no fear.

When the enemy is distant yet provokes battle, they seek to lure us forward.
Du Mu says: If they were close and provoked us, they would press us directly, fearing we would not advance—thus they remain distant.
Chen Hao says: If the enemy is near yet does not provoke battle, they rely on their defensive terrain. If distant yet provokes battle, they aim to entice us forward, then seize the advantage and strike.
Mei Yaochen concurs with Chen Hao’s annotation.
Wang Xi says: They seek to compel our advance. *Provocation* means goading the boldest enemy into battle.

Zhang Yu says: When two armies are close yet remain unmoving, the enemy trusts in their fortified terrain. When two armies are distant yet repeatedly provoke battle, they seek to lure us forward.
Wei Liaozi says: Those who divide and hold perilous terrain lack the will to fight—if the enemy has already secured such ground, do not engage them. It also says: Those who provoke battle lack full vigor. When the enemy is distant and provokes battle to entice us forward, they cannot be met with full force—this aligns with the same principle.

If the enemy occupies level ground, it is to their advantage.
Cao Cao says: Their position is advantageous.
Li Quan says: Occupying level ground benefits their governance.
Du Mu says: If the enemy does not occupy perilous terrain but instead holds level ground, they must have some strategic advantage.
An alternate version reads: When soldiers vie for a position, it is because the ground is both level and advantageous.
Chen Hao says: If the enemy secures advantageous terrain, their officers and troops will compete to occupy it.
Jia Lin says: If the enemy’s position offers many advantages, they provoke us to advance toward their convenience, making victory easier—beware of falling into their trap.
Mei Yaochen says: Their position is level and advantageous, so they come to provoke battle.
Wang Xi follows Cao Cao’s annotation.

Zhang Yu says: If the enemy abandons perilous terrain for level ground, they must have some advantage. Alternatively, they may wish us to advance, so they occupy open ground to display its benefits and entice us.

When trees rustle en masse, the enemy approaches.
Cao Cao says: They fell trees to clear a path, causing movement.
Mei Yaochen concurs with Cao Cao’s annotation.
Zhang Yu says: Armies must send skilled scouts to high ground to observe the enemy. If they see trees swaying, it means the enemy is felling them to clear a path. Alternatively, they may be preparing weapons—like the Jin forces who felled trees to bolster their troops.

When grasses are thick with obstructions, the enemy seeks to deceive.
Cao Cao says: They bind grass into barriers to sow doubt.
Du Mu says: If the enemy’s camp is unfinished or they have secretly withdrawn, fearing pursuit or ambush, they bind grass into clusters to simulate hidden troops, making us hesitate to advance.
Jia Lin says: If they create many grass barriers, they aim to make us suspect the area is unoccupied, while planning a separate attack—we must carefully prepare.
Du You says: Thick grass barriers are meant to make us doubt; dense vegetation with many obstructions suggests the enemy has fled, fearing pursuit, and has set up barriers to make us suspect an ambush.
Zhang Yu says: If the enemy wishes to evade us, they may create many obstructions, leaving false traces before fleeing to avoid pursuit. Or, if they plan to ambush us, they may gather grass and trees to simulate encampments, making us guard one side while they strike another—all to sow deception.

When birds take flight, troops lie in ambush below.
Cao Cao says: Birds rising from below indicate hidden troops.
Li Quan says: Concealed troops are called an ambush.
Du You says: Hidden troops passing below disturb the birds, startling them into flight.
Zhang Yu says: If birds fly calmly but suddenly rise, hidden troops lie below.

When beasts flee in alarm, the enemy seeks to overwhelm.
Cao Cao says: The enemy spreads their forces wide to envelop us.
Li Quan says: An unexpected arrival is called an *overwhelming* attack.
Du Mu says: When the enemy plans to overwhelm us, they approach through perilous terrain or dense forests, startling hidden beasts into flight. *Overwhelm* means they come to ambush us.
Chen Hao says: *Overwhelm* refers to hiding in forests and stealthily advancing to strike. Like scouts during a fierce battle, they may emerge from the flanks or rear, startling hidden beasts.
Mei Yaochen says: If beasts flee in alarm, an ambush lies nearby.
Zhang Yu says: Those who seek to overwhelm others approach through perilous terrain or dense vegetation, startling hidden beasts into flight.

When dust rises high and sharp, chariots approach from the east.
Du Mu says: Chariots and horses move swiftly in single file, so the dust rises high and pointed.
Du You says: Swift-moving chariots and horses stir up dust, making it rise.
Mei Yaochen says: The weight of hooves and wheels ensures the dust rises high and sharp.
Zhang Yu says: Chariots and horses move swiftly with great force, their tracks advancing in succession, so the dust rises high and straight. Armies must station scouts ahead; if they spot enemy dust, they must gallop to report to the commander—like Pan Dang, who observed Jin’s dust and sent a rider to warn.

When dust is low and broad, infantry approaches.
Du Mu says: Foot soldiers move slowly and can advance in formation, so the dust is low and wide.

Mei Yaochen says: Foot soldiers tread lightly and low, so the dust must be low and broad.
Wang Xi says: Chariots and horses raise dust fiercely, while infantry moves more slowly.
Zhang Yu says: Infantry marches slowly with light tracks, and their formations are spaced widely, so the dust is low and spreading.

When dust is scattered and striated, firewood-gatherers approach.
Li Quan says: In the signs of smoke and dust, when the Jin army attacked Qi, they dragged branches behind them. The Qi forces climbed the mountains, saw the dust, and feared their numbers, then fled by night. The coming of firewood embodies this meaning. Here, Quan interprets the two characters for "firewood-gathering" as the single word "firewood."
Du Mu says: Firewood-gatherers move in all directions, so the dust disperses and spreads. "Striated" describes a crisscrossed, broken appearance.
Mei Yaochen says: Firewood-gatherers roam everywhere, so the dust must be scattered and streaked.
Wang Xi says: "Striated" depicts a fine, intermittent, and broken appearance.
Zhang Yu says: Dispatching servants to gather firewood in various places, the dust scatters and forms winding trails.

When dust is sparse and comes and goes, a camp is being established.
Du Mu says: To set up a camp, light cavalry scouts move back and forth, so the dust is minimal.
Mei Yaochen says: Light cavalry scouting for a camp site produces little dust as they come and go.
Zhang Yu says: Whenever a camp is to be divided and fortified, light cavalry must be sent to survey the terrain from all sides, seeking to understand the risks, advantages, breadth, and narrowness of the land. Thus, the dust is faint and intermittent.

When envoys speak humbly yet preparations increase, an advance is imminent.
Cao Cao says: When their envoys arrive with humble words, they send spies to observe—while the enemy strengthens their defenses.
Du Mu says: If the enemy’s envoys arrive speaking humbly, then reinforce ramparts and walls as if fearing us, they aim to make us arrogant and careless, then attack. When Zhao She relieved Yuyu, he halted thirty li from Handan, strengthened his fortifications, and did not advance. When Qin spies arrived, he treated them well and sent them off. The spies reported back to the Qin general, who was overjoyed, saying, "Yuyu will no longer belong to Zhao." After dispatching the Qin spies, Zhao She advanced swiftly by forced marches, caught Qin unprepared, struck them, and crushed the Qin army.
Mei Yaochen says: Those who intend to advance speak humbly outwardly while strengthening defenses inwardly, feigning deference.
Zhang Yu says: When envoys arrive with humble words while the enemy increases their preparations, they seek to make us complacent before advancing. When Tian Dan defended Jimo, the Yan general Qi Jie besieged the city. Dan personally carried baskets and spades, laboring alongside his soldiers, had his wives and concubines weave among the ranks, and distributed food to feast his troops. He then sent women to the city walls to negotiate surrender. The Yan forces rejoiced. He also collected a thousand *yi* of gold from the people, had the wealthy send letters to the Yan general, saying, "When the city surrenders, we beg you not to enslave our wives and concubines." The Yan forces grew even more lax. Then Dan launched a surprise attack and routed them.

When envoys speak boldly while advancing their forces, they intend to retreat.
Cao Cao says: This is deception.
Du Mu says: When King Fuchai of Wu marched north to meet Duke Ding of Jin at Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue attacked Wu. As Wu and Jin vied for supremacy, the outcome remained undecided. Fearing defeat, the King of Wu consulted his ministers: "Is it better to abandon the meeting and return, or to attend and take precedence over Jin?" Wangsun Luo replied, "We must attend and take precedence." The King asked, "How can we do so?" Luo said, "Tonight, we must provoke battle to rally the people’s will, and then we can prevail." That evening, the King of Wu deployed thirty thousand armored troops a *li* from the Jin army, their war cries shaking heaven and earth. Jin sent Dong He to assess the situation. The King of Wu addressed him personally: "Whether I serve you or not, it will be decided today." Dong He said, "I observe the King of Wu’s countenance—he seems deeply troubled. His generals seek to poison us; we cannot engage them in battle." Thus, Jin allowed Wu to take precedence in the covenant. After the meeting, the King of Wu returned home.
Du You says: Deceptive maneuvers and displays of fearlessness signal an intent to retreat.
Mei Yaochen says: When those who wish to retreat employ bold words and advance their forces, they seek to intimidate us.
Wang Xi says: Bold words and feigned advances are meant to prevent us from anticipating their withdrawal.
Zhang Yu says: When envoys speak boldly and their army advances, they aim to coerce us into allowing their retreat. A Qin envoy warned the Jin army at night: "Neither side’s troops wish to fight. Tomorrow, let us meet." Jin’s Yu Ping observed, "The envoy’s darting eyes and unrestrained speech betray his fear." Qin indeed fled under cover of night.

When light chariots emerge first and take position to the side, they are forming battle lines.
Cao Cao says: They deploy troops to signal their readiness for battle.
Du Mu says: Light chariots are sent ahead to establish the boundaries of the battlefield.
Jia Lin says: Light chariots advance to arrange formations before engaging.
Zhang Yu says: Light chariots are war chariots. Their emergence signals the formation of battle lines. As in the *Fish-Scale Formation*, chariots lead while infantry follow. Thus, when chariots appear first, they indicate an intent to fight.

When one requests peace without prior agreement, they harbor schemes.
Li Quan says: Requests for peace without a binding covenant are always ploys against others. The deceptions of Tian Dan against Qi Jie and Ji Xin against Xiang Yu exemplify this.
Du Mu says: In the third year of the Zhenyuan era, the Tubo chieftain Shang Jiezan, having ravaged Hequ and lost half his men and horses to plague, feared he could not return. He feigned sincerity to the Minister Shi Zhong Ma Sui and requested an alliance. Sui agreed. At the time, the military governor of Hezhong, Hun Cheng, memorialized: "If the court stations troops at the border and plans an offensive, we may consider Tubo’s request for an alliance. But now, with no demands from the court, their sudden plea for peace is surely insincere." The emperor did not heed this. Hun Jian led twenty thousand troops to camp at Pingliang County in Jingzhou, where the altar for the alliance stood thirty *li* to the west. On the thirteenth day of the fifth month, Jian led three thousand men to the altar, and Tubo, clad in hidden armor, seized the opportunity to ambush them.
Chen Hao says: Ambushes during alliances are not unique to our dynasty. When Jin and Chu met at Song, Chu’s troops wore concealed armor, intending to surprise Jin. Jin discovered this and thus lost trust.
Du You says: Requests for peace without prior agreement are always ploys.
Mei Yaochen says: Unprovoked pleas for peace conceal treachery.
Wang Xi says: Sudden, unprovoked requests for peace warrant vigilance against ulterior motives.
Zhang Yu says: Unprovoked pleas for peace always conceal treachery. When Emperor Gaozu of Han sought to strike the Qin army, he sent Li Yiji to bribe the Qin general Jia Shu with precious gifts. The general indeed sought peace. Gaozu exploited his complacency and attacked, crushing the Qin forces. Later, the Jin general Li Ju defended Rongyang against Liu Chang’s thirty thousand troops. Ju sent envoys bearing oxen and wine to feign surrender, concealing his elite troops while exposing only weak soldiers. Chang feasted his men, leaving them drunk and sated. Ju launched a night raid, and Chang barely escaped with his life.

When troops rush to arrange chariots and formations, they have set a time.
Li Quan says: When battle is imminent, troops hasten to prepare.
Du Mu says: Earlier, light chariots emerged first to establish the battlefield’s boundaries, planting flags as markers. Troops now rush to these markers to form ranks. Flags serve as the appointed time, signaling the people to assemble below. As the *Rites of Zhou* states: "Chariots gallop, infantry rush, and all halt at the markers."
Jia Lin says: Ordinary appointments do not require rushing; this signals reinforcements from afar. If a specific time is set, they intend to coordinate an attack. Prepare swiftly.
Mei Yaochen says: Flags are planted as markers, and troops rush to form ranks.
Wang Xi says: Forming ranks and setting a time for the people signals an intent to fight.
Zhang Yu says: Flags serve as markers, and the people are summoned to assemble below. Thus, they rush to their positions. As the *Rites of Zhou* states: "Chariots gallop, infantry rush, and all halt at the markers."

Half-advancing, half-retreating—this is a lure.
Li Quan says: Scattered at the front.
Du Mu says: Feigning disarray and disorder to entice me into advancing.
Mei Yaochen says: Advancing and retreating inconsistently to lure me.
Wang Xi says: A deceptive display of chaos.
Zhang Yu says: A false show of disorder—this is to lure me. As when Wuzi used prisoners to feign disarray and entice the Chu forces.

Leaning on weapons while standing—this signals hunger.
Li Quan says: Exhausted and unable to stand in formation.
Du Mu says: Without food, they must be weary, hence leaning on their weapons. Another version begins with "leaning" here.
Du You says: Leaning on spears and halberds while standing reveals their hunger.
Mei Yaochen says: Leaning on their weapons while standing clearly shows the signs of hunger and exhaustion.
Wang Xi says: Leaning on weapons is the mark of distress and starvation.
Zhang Yu says: Without food, all grow weary, so they lean on their weapons. When the Three Armies eat and drink, all do so together; thus, if one is hungry, the entire army must be.

Drawing water and drinking before others—this signals thirst.
Li Quan says: Drawing water but drinking before it reaches camp reveals the soldiers’ thirst.
Du Mu says: Ordered to draw water, they drink before it arrives—this is thirst. Observing one, the state of the Three Armies may be known.
Mei Yaochen echoes Du Mu’s note.
Wang Xi says: This reveals the urgency of their hunger and thirst.
Zhang Yu says: Drawing water but drinking before returning to camp shows the entire army is parched.

Seeing advantage but not advancing—this signals exhaustion.
Cao Cao says: The weariness of the soldiers.
Li Quan says: The soldiers are difficult to employ.
Du You says: The soldiers are fatigued. When the enemy approaches and sees an opportunity but cannot press forward, they are exhausted.
Mei Yaochen says: When men are worn out, what advantage can they pursue?
Zhang Yu says: When soldiers are fatigued, they cannot be made to fight; thus, though they see an advantage, the general dare not advance.

Birds gathering—this signals emptiness.
Li Quan says: Birds on the city walls signal the army’s retreat.
Du Mu says: Leaving behind a false form to conceal a retreat. When Qi and Jin were locked in stalemate, Shu Xiang remarked: "The crows’ cries are joyful—Qi’s army must be retreating." Later, when Zhou King Xian’s general Yuan attacked Northern Qi, he prepared to withdraw, using cypress leaves as tents and burning dung heaps before departing. The Northern Qi forces observed this for two days before realizing the camp was empty, but by then, pursuit was futile. This was leaving behind a false form to conceal a retreat.
Chen Hao says: This means that if the enemy has departed, their camp must be empty; with no one to fear them, birds will gather and cry upon it. When Prince Yuan of Chu attacked Zheng and was about to flee, his advisors warned: "There are birds on the Chu camp." He halted, realizing it was a false form left to conceal a retreat.

This passage expounds upon Master Sun’s method of discerning the enemy’s true and false intentions. Du You states: When the enemy constructs grand fortifications to display their might, yet crows gather and perch within, it signals emptiness. Mei Yaochen says: Once the enemy has departed, their fortifications lie vacant; with no cause for fear, birds alight and gather upon them. Zhang Yu observes: Whenever an enemy retreats in secret, they abandon their encampments; seeing them empty, birds cry out and congregate above. When Chu attacked Zheng and the Zheng forces prepared to flee, a scout reported: "Birds are on the Chu camp." They halted. Again, when Jin attacked Qi, Shu Xiang remarked: "Birds are on the city walls—Qi’s army must be retreating." This is leaving behind a false form to conceal a retreat.

As for nighttime cries, they betray fear. Cao Cao says: When soldiers cry out at night, their commander lacks courage. Li Quan notes: If troops are timid and their general weak, they will cry out in alarm. Du Mu explains: Fear and unease drive them to shout in the night to bolster their spirits. Chen Hao states: If one in ten men is brave, even if the other nine are cowardly, they may find reassurance in that single man’s courage. Yet when soldiers cry out at night, it reveals their commander’s lack of valor. Cao’s interpretation is correct. The Meng family concurs with Chen Hao’s annotation.

Zhang Yu states: The Three Armies take their commander as their master. If the commander lacks courage, he cannot reassure his troops, so the soldiers grow fearful and cry out at night. As was the case when the Jin army’s clamor filled the night.

When the army is in turmoil, the commander lacks gravity. Li Quan says: If the commander lacks dignity and weight, the army will be in turmoil. Du Mu explains: If his advance and retreat, his every movement, are frivolous and hasty, lacking gravity, the soldiers will likewise grow disordered. Chen Hao states: When the commander’s laws and orders are not strict, his bearing not grave, the troops will fall into chaos. Mei Yaochen concurs with Chen Hao’s annotation.

Zhang Yu says: When the army is frequently alarmed and disordered, the commander lacks steadfastness. When Zhang Liao was stationed at Changshe, one night the camp suddenly erupted in chaos, and the entire army was thrown into confusion. Zhang Liao ordered his attendants to remain still, saying: This must be someone plotting mischief, seeking to stir up unrest. He then commanded the soldiers to sit calmly, while he himself stood in their midst. Soon, order was restored. This is what it means to maintain steadfastness.

When banners and flags sway, there is disorder. Du Mu says: When Duke Zhuang of Lu defeated Qi at Changshao, Cao Gui requested permission to pursue. The Duke asked: How so? Cao Gui replied: Observe their chariot tracks in disarray and their banners drooping—thus we pursue. Du You explains: When banners and flags move erratically, swaying east and west, leaning and toppling, there is disorder. Mei Yaochen says: When banners and flags constantly shift, falling out of rank and order, there is no discipline. Zhang Yu states: Banners and flags serve to unify the troops; when they sway without stability, the ranks are in disarray.

When officers grow angry, the troops are weary. Du Mu says: When all are exhausted and worn, officers no longer fear and vent their anger. Chen Hao states: When the commander launches unnecessary campaigns, everyone grows weary and worn. Jia Lin says: When men are distressed, they grow angry. Mei Yaochen explains: When officers and soldiers are weary and vexed, they rage without fear. Zhang Yu says: When policies and orders are inconsistent, the people grow weary, and officers often grow angry. When Jin and Chu clashed, Jin’s deputy generals Zhao Zhan and Wei Qi, enraged and seeking to sabotage the Jin army, both offered their services to Chu. As Que Ke said: Two resentments have gone forth—if we do not prepare, we will surely be defeated.

When horses are fed grain and men eat meat, when the army has no suspended cooking pots and does not return to its quarters, it is a desperate enemy. The *Lost Duke* states: To slaughter horses and eat their meat means the army is out of provisions; when there are no suspended cooking pots and they do not return to their quarters, it is a desperate enemy. Li Quan says: They kill their horses to eat the meat, hence the army is out of provisions. Not returning to camp means they are too pressed to tend to cooking fires. Du Mu explains: "Feeding horses grain" means using stored grain to feed the horses. "Eating meat" means slaughtering oxen and horses to feast the troops. "No suspended cooking pots" means smashing them all, showing they will not cook again. "Not returning to their quarters" means maintaining formations day and night. All of this marks a desperate enemy, one determined to fight to the death. *Fou* (缶) is pronounced *fu*, a cooking vessel. Mei Yaochen says: They feed their horses with grain and feast their troops with slaughtered livestock, discard their pots and no longer cook, expose themselves without returning to camp—this is their resolve to fight to the finish. Wang Xi states: Feeding horses grain and eating meat strengthens their force for a prolonged struggle. Having no cooking pots means they will not eat again. Not returning to camp means they have no intention of retreat. All of this signifies a final, desperate battle. Against such an enemy, one should hold fast and await their exhaustion. Zhang Yu says: They discard grain to feed their horses, slaughter livestock to feast their troops, smash their cauldrons and pots, no longer cook, expose their forces, and do not return to camp—this is a desperate enemy. Examples include Meng Ming burning his boats and the Chu army smashing their cauldrons.

When officers speak softly and repeatedly, whispering among themselves, they have lost the support of their troops. Cao Cao says: *Zhunzhun* describes their manner of speech; *xixi* describes their loss of resolve. Li Quan explains: *Zhunzhun xixi* depicts furtive whispering. When the soldiers’ hearts fear their superiors, they speak in hushed, private tones—this is losing the support of the troops. Du Mu says: *Zhunzhun* describes a voice lacking vigor, short of breath; *xixi* describes a state of disarray and confusion. Such behavior reveals inner turmoil, the loss of the troops’ loyalty. Jia Lin says: *Zhunzhun* depicts secret discussions; *xixi* depicts unease. Speaking slowly with others, asking questions in turn.

Such behavior will surely lead to the dispersal and loss of one's troops.

Mei Yaochen says: *Zhunzhun* describes the utterance of earnest sincerity; *xixi* describes the neglect of duties. Speaking slowly with forced composure betrays fear of losing the troops.

Wang Xi says: *Zhunzhun* depicts the manner of earnest speech; *xixi* reveals anxiety toward one’s superiors. When a commander has lost the hearts of his men, the troops whisper among themselves, speaking earnestly while harboring grievances against their leader.

He Shi says: When two men whisper in secret, they are criticizing their commanding officer.

Zhang Yu says: *Zhunzhun* describes speech; *xixi* describes gathering. When soldiers huddle together in private, speaking in low, slow tones to disparage their superiors, it shows they have lost the support of their troops.

Frequent rewards indicate distress.
Li Quan says: Distress leads to frequent rewards to encourage progress.
Du Mu says: When strength is exhausted and one fears rebellion, frequent rewards are given to please the troops.
Meng Shi says: Military resources are depleted. Fearing the soldiers’ morale will wane, small favors are bestowed separately.
Mei Yaochen says: When one’s position is desperate and fear of desertion arises, repeated rewards are given to appease the troops.
Wang Xi says: When the troops are distressed and lack harmony, frequent rewards are used to please them.
Zhang Yu says: When one’s strength is exhausted and loyalty wavers, repeated rewards are used to pacify the soldiers.

Frequent punishments indicate hardship.
Li Quan says: Hardship leads to frequent punishments to spur the troops.
Du Mu says: When manpower is exhausted and soldiers no longer fear punishment, frequent punishments are used to intimidate them.
Mei Yaochen says: When the troops are worn out and unable to endure orders, repeated punishments are used to establish authority.
Wang Xi says: When the troops are exhausted and lack diligence, frequent punishments are used to coerce them.
Zhang Yu says: When strength is depleted and soldiers are difficult to command, frequent punishments are used to instill fear.

To act harshly first and then fear one’s troops is the height of imprudence.
Cao Cao says: To first underestimate the enemy and later fear one’s own troops is to harbor ill will toward them.
Li Quan says: To act recklessly first and then fear one’s troops is the mark of a warrior without strategy—utter imprudence.
Du Mu says: This is the height of imprecise assessment of the enemy.
Jia Lin says: When orders are unclear and the troops are untrained, a commander who first acts with brutal force will grow fearful as the troops rebel—this is the extreme of cowardice.
Mei Yaochen says: To first enforce harsh discipline and later fear the troops’ desertion is the height of imprudent command.
Wang Xi says: When the enemy first acts with violence and later fears the desertion of their troops, it shows the commander’s extreme lack of prudence.
He Shi says: Balancing leniency and severity is the essence of precise generalship.
Zhang Yu says: To first underestimate the enemy and later fear one’s own men. Alternatively, to first rule with harshness and later fear rebellion is to wield power without care—utter imprudence. Thus, the preceding passage refers to frequent rewards and punishments.

Those who come bearing tribute and apologies seek respite.
Li Quan says: To advance slowly and retreat swiftly is called *commission and apology*.
Du Mu says: Those who offer tribute and apologies do so because their strength is exhausted or for other reasons—they seek respite.
Jia Lin says: Those who appear dejected and speak apologetically seek mutual resolution.
Du You says: When neither side has gained the upper hand, yet one side lowers its morale and offers apologies, it seeks respite.
Mei Yaochen says: When strength is depleted and one desires to cease hostilities, tribute is offered in apology.
Wang Xi says: Their strength cannot endure.
Zhang Yu says: To send beloved envoys bearing tribute and apologies shows their strength is utterly exhausted—they seek to rest and end the conflict.

When troops advance in fury yet do not engage in battle for a long time, nor do they withdraw, one must observe them carefully.
Cao Cao says: Beware of hidden ambushes.
Li Quan says: Such an army must have a hidden ambush—observe carefully.
Du Mu says: When troops advance in rage but do not clash, nor do they retreat, they are waiting for something. One must carefully observe them, lest a hidden ambush arise from the flanks.
Meng Shi says: Prepare for other contingencies.
Mei Yaochen says: When troops advance in anger but do not engage in battle, nor do they withdraw, they must have a hidden ambush awaiting. The above discusses enemy conditions.

Zhang Yu says: When troops advance in fury but neither engage nor retreat, one must secretly observe them—there must be a hidden ambush.

An army does not benefit from mere numbers.
Cao Cao says: Strength and power are balanced. (An alternate version reads: An army does not prize greater numbers.)
Jia Lin says: Victory does not lie in outnumbering the enemy, but in using the few to defeat the many.
Wang Xi says: I say that balanced strength and power suffice; greater numbers are not advantageous.
Zhang Yu says: An army does not gain advantage by outnumbering the enemy—it means strength and power are balanced.

Only avoid reckless advance.
Cao Cao says: No opportunity has presented itself.
Jia Lin says: One must not rely solely on martial prowess; reckless advance leads to brutality.
Wang Xi says: One must not rely solely on force, but assess the enemy with strategy and wisdom.
Zhang Yu says: *Wu* means strength. To advance recklessly without assessing the advantage means no opportunity has arisen.

It is sufficient to combine strength, assess the enemy, and seize the advantage.
Cao Cao says: Even auxiliary forces suffice.
Li Quan says: When troops are numerous and strength is balanced, victory goes to the one who gains the right men.
Du Mu says: When my strength and the enemy’s are equal, yet I cannot advance recklessly, it is because I have not yet found the right men. But even among auxiliary forces, selecting the capable is enough to combine strength, assess the enemy, and secure victory—no need to seek elsewhere.
Chen Hao says: My strength is not greater than the enemy’s, nor is there an advantageous opportunity to advance. I need not seek reinforcements from other states; by combining strength and selecting the right men from auxiliary forces, I can still defeat the enemy.
Jia Lin says: Though lacking the martial strength for reckless advance, one can still use strategy to assess the enemy, combine forces, and seize victory.
Mei Yaochen says: *Wu* means to continue.

Though the troops may be insufficient to press forward, they suffice to combine the strength of auxiliary forces, assess the enemy, and secure victory.

Wang Xi says: I say that one skilled in the variations of division and unity can combine forces to exploit the enemy’s gaps and seize victory—this is all. Thus, even auxiliary troops will do; how much more so elite soldiers? Cao’s explanation is correct.

Zhang Yu says: When military strength is equal and no opportunity presents itself, though not yet sufficient for a bold advance, one may still select men from auxiliary forces, combine their strength, assess the enemy, and secure victory—no need to borrow troops from others. Thus, the *Wei Liaozi* says: "When the world sends auxiliary troops, they are called a hundred thousand, but in truth, they number no more than tens of thousands. Those who come will all tell their generals: 'Do not be the first to fight.' This means auxiliary troops are of no benefit; one’s own troops, governed by military methods, are better." Only those who act without forethought and underestimate the enemy will surely be captured.

Du Mu says: Those who lack deep strategy and far-reaching plans, relying only on individual courage and acting recklessly without caution, will surely be captured by the enemy.

Chen Hao says: *Wei* means "only." This speaks of those utterly lacking foresight, who merely underestimate the enemy—they will surely be captured, and this is not merely a matter of courage. As the *Zuozhuan* says: "Wasps and scorpions have venom; how much more so a state?" Thus, even a small enemy must not be taken lightly.

Wang Xi says: Only those who cannot assess the enemy but advance recklessly will surely be captured, making clear that the danger lies not in insufficient numbers.

Zhang Yu says: Those who cannot assess their men but instead underestimate the enemy and advance recklessly will surely be captured. When Qi and Jin attacked each other, the Marquis of Qi said: "Let me first destroy these and then eat breakfast." He did not armor his horses but charged and was defeated by Jin.

If punishment is meted out before the troops have grown close, they will not submit; if they do not submit, they will be difficult to employ.

Du Mu says: When kindness and trust have not yet permeated, one cannot use punishments to bring order.

Mei Yaochen says: *Zhuan* means "to reach." Virtue reaches them, kindness draws them close. If kindness and virtue have not spread, punishment will not be accepted, and thus they will resent and be difficult to employ.

Wang Xi says: If kindness and trust have not long been deeply established in the hearts of the people, they have not yet grown close.

Zhang Yu says: One who suddenly assumes the position of general, without having first extended kindness and trust to the people, and then hastily imposes punishments to bring order, will provoke anger and make them difficult to employ. Thus, Tian Rangju said: "I have long been lowly and humble; the soldiers have not grown close, and the common people do not trust me." And Wu Can said: "Jin’s officials in power are new and cannot yet enforce orders."

If punishment is not enforced after the troops have grown close, they cannot be employed.

Cao Cao says: When kindness and trust have already permeated, if there are no punishments, the troops will grow arrogant and indolent, making them difficult to employ.

Mei Yaochen says: When kindness and virtue have already permeated, if punishments are not enforced, the troops will grow arrogant and cannot be employed.

Wang Xi says: This is what is meant by "like spoiled children."

Zhang Yu says: When kindness and trust have long permeated and the hearts of the soldiers have grown close, if punishments are lenient, the troops will grow arrogant and cannot be employed.

Thus, command them with civility and bring them into order with martial discipline.

Cao Cao says: Civility is benevolence; martial discipline is law.

Li Quan says: Civility is kindness and grace; martial discipline is awe and punishment.

Du Mu says: Yanzi cited Tian Rangju as one whose civility could unite the people and whose martial discipline could overawe the enemy.

Wang Xi says: Wu Qi said: "One who unites civility and martial discipline is the general of an army; one who combines hardness and softness is the master of warfare." This is called "surely seizing victory."

Du Mu says: When civility and martial discipline are both enacted, victory is surely seized.

Mei Yaochen says: Command with kindness and grace, bring order with awe and punishment. When kindness and awe are both evident, one can surely win.

Zhang Yu says: Use civility and grace to please them, martial discipline and awe to discipline them. When reverence and love are combined, battles will be won and attacks will surely succeed.

Someone asked: The *Book of Documents* says: "When awe overcomes love, success is truly achieved; when love overcomes awe, success is truly thwarted." This speaks of putting awe first. Why does Sun Wu put love first?

The answer: What the *Book of Documents* praises is the army of a benevolent ruler. For a true king, kindness and virtue toward the people are long-established, and their hearts have already grown close. When he employs them, the only concern is a lack of awe. What Sun Wu describes is the army of the Warring States. For a hegemon, laws and orders are long harsh, and the people’s hearts are easily estranged. When he employs them, the only concern is a lack of kindness.

If commands are consistently enforced to instruct the people, the people will submit.

Mei Yaochen says: *Su* means "long-established." When awe and commands are long-established, instruction will be heeded and obeyed.

Zhang Yu says: When commands have long been enforced, the people already trust them. Instruct and employ them, and each person will submit.

If commands are not consistently enforced to instruct the people, the people will not submit.

Wang Xi says: If the people have not long been instructed, they will be difficult to employ at once.

He Shi says: If the people have already lost their training, how can they submit to instruction?

When commands are consistently enforced, one is in harmony with the multitude.

Du Mu says: *Su* means "in advance." This speaks of a general in ordinary times, when there is no conflict. Kindness, trust, awe, and commands must first be established among the people. Then, when facing the enemy, issuing commands and establishing laws will be met with the people’s trust and submission. Han Xin said: "I have not long been able to care for and lead the officers and gentlemen; this is what is called driving market rabble into battle." Thus, he made them fight with their backs to the water, so that each man would fight for himself. This was because they had not long received kindness and trust, nor followed awe and commands.

Chen Hao says: When Duke Wen of Jin first entered his state, he instructed his people for two years and wished to employ them. Zifan said: "The people do not yet know righteousness and have not settled into their homes." This meant he wished the people not to value their lives lightly. Thereupon, he went out to secure King Xiang. This meant demonstrating the great righteousness of serving one’s lord, entering to work for the benefit of the people. When the people cherished life, he again wished to employ them. Zifan said: "The people do not yet know trust and have not seen their use."

Thus, he attacked Yuan to demonstrate trust. This meant that in the previous year, when attacking Yuan, he did not seize its benefits but upheld his trust. The people, though easily swayed, did not seek abundance—this showed that none were greedy or deceitful, clearly proving his words.

The Duke said: "It is sufficient." Zifan said: "The people do not yet know ritual and have not cultivated reverence." Thereupon, he conducted a grand review to demonstrate ritual. When it came time for battle, young and old observed ritual, and thus they could be employed.

These five—righteousness, trust, kindness, awe, and ritual—are the foundations of teaching the people. For commands, the essential lies in first clarifying them so that people heed them without confusion. For laws, the essential lies in their certain enforcement so that people uphold them without taking trust lightly.

Three commands and five clarifications ensure the people are not confused. When laws and orders are simple and appropriate, and their execution is certain, only then can one harmonize with the multitude.

Mei Yaochen says: When trust has been long established, what matter will they not follow?

Wang Xi says: One who understands this may then speak of uniting strength to overcome the enemy.

Zhang Yu says: When the ruler employs trust to lead the people, and the people respond with trust, there is harmony between above and below.

The *Wei Liaozi* states: In the method of issuing commands, minor faults are not altered, and minor doubts are not reclarified. Once orders are given, they must not be reversed. Unless there is a great fault or great doubt, there is no need for revision or reclarification—this is how trust is maintained among the people.

When Zhuge Liang fought the Wei army, though outnumbered, if any soldier was found equal to the task, he would not detain them but sent them away, saying: "Trust must not be broken." Thus, every man wished to stay and fight, and they greatly defeated the Wei forces.

*Sunzi Annotations, Scroll Ten: The Terrain Chapter*

Cao Cao said: "When desiring battle, examine the terrain to establish victory."
Li Quan said: "After the army marches forth, the terrain must shift."
Wang Xi said: "One must thoroughly know the advantageous forms of terrain—its defiles, narrows, forks, and snares."
Zhang Yu said: "Whenever the army advances, first survey the mountains and rivers within fifty *li*, dispatching scouts to watch for ambushes. The general must personally inspect the lay of the land, then map it to discern its hazards and ease."

Thus, when campaigning beyond borders, victory is established by scrutinizing the terrain. This follows the discussion of marching the army.

Sunzi said: "Terrain has six forms: *tong* (open), *gua* (entangled), *zhi* (stalemated), *ai* (narrow), *xian* (precipitous), and *yuan* (distant)."
Cao Cao said: "These six are the forms of terrain."
Mei Yaochen said: "*Tong* is where roads intersect; *gua* is a snaring land where advance ensures entanglement; *zhi* is a deadlocked ground; *ai* lies between two mountains in a shared valley; *xian* comprises mountains, rivers, and hills; *yuan* is level ground."
Du You said: "These are the six names of terrain. Teaching the people to occupy them with advantage ensures victory."
Zhang Yu said: "Terrain is distinguished by these six forms."

Where I may advance and the enemy may come is called *tong*.
Du You said: "This refers to both sides being on level ground, where advance and retreat are unimpeded."
Zhang Yu said: "Both sides being on level ground, where movement is unobstructed."

For *tong* terrain, first occupy the high and sunny ground, secure the supply routes, and battle will be advantageous.
Cao Cao said: "Better to make the enemy come to you than to go to them."
Li Quan said: "Occupy it first to await the enemy."
Du Mu said: "*Tong* is a ground of fourfold conflict. One must first seize the high and sunny positions, lest the enemy gain them before you arrive. Securing the supply routes means fortifying or constructing covered ways at river crossings or enemy choke points to protect them."
Jia Lin said: "*Tong* is unobstructed, without ridges or defiles, allowing free movement. Occupying high ground eases observation, facing the sun aids visibility, and supply routes facilitate transport—thus, battle is advantageous here."
Du You said: "Better to make the enemy come to you than to go to them. First occupy the high ground, then divide forces to guard the return routes, preventing the enemy from cutting off your supplies."
Mei Yaochen said: "First occupy the high and sunny ground, secure the supply routes, and when the enemy approaches, battle will be advantageous."
Wang Xi’s annotation matches Cao Cao’s. He Shi’s matches Du You’s.
Zhang Yu said: "Occupy the battleground first to await the enemy, thus drawing them in rather than being drawn. Though occupying high and sunny ground to lure the enemy, one must also ensure supplies remain unbroken for advantage."

Where advance is possible but return is difficult is called *gua*.
Du You said: "*Gua* means entanglement."

For *gua* terrain, if the enemy is unprepared, advance and defeat them; if the enemy is prepared, advance but fail to win, and return will be difficult—this is disadvantageous.
Li Quan said: "*Gua* is where advance is difficult and return impossible."
Du Mu said: "*Gua* is treacherous, obstructed ground shared with the enemy, interlocking like dog’s teeth, where movement is hindered. If the enemy is unprepared when you attack, you will surely win—though the terrain is treacherous, the enemy’s defeat will prevent them from intercepting your return. If the enemy is prepared and you cannot win, they will hold the treacherous ground to block your retreat, making return difficult."
Chen Hao said: "If forced into such a position, prepare for protracted warfare, plunder the enemy’s supplies, and await an opportunity to strike."
Du You said: "If the enemy is unprepared, attack and victory is possible; if prepared, victory is unattainable, and return will be difficult."
Mei Yaochen said: "Strike unexpectedly, and advance will yield advantage; if the enemy is prepared, advance will bring defeat."
Zhang Yu said: "If you ascertain the enemy is truly unprepared, a single assault may win. If they are prepared, advance without victory, and you cannot remain to fight nor retreat—this is not advantageous."

Where advance is disadvantageous for me and disadvantageous for the enemy is called *zhi*.
Du You said: "*Zhi* means prolonged—neither side benefits from protracted stalemate."
Zhang Yu said: "Each holds fast to perilous ground to support the other."

For *zhi* terrain, even if the enemy lures me with advantage, I do not advance; instead, feign retreat, then strike when half the enemy has emerged—this is advantageous.
Li Quan said: "*Zhi* is where neither side gains advantage, like *gua* terrain, so each divides their forces."
Du Mu said: "*Zhi* is where both sides hold high and perilous ground, facing each other across a narrow, elongated plain. Advancing troops cannot form ranks, and meeting the enemy means fighting uphill—neither side benefits. In such cases, withdraw openly, then lie in ambush. If the enemy pursues, wait until half have emerged, then strike—this is advantageous. If the enemy retreats first to lure you, do not advance."
Chen Hao said: "This explanation is overly complex and inverted. Simply put: if both sides advance and the terrain is unfavorable, and the enemy offers bait to lure you away, do not pursue. If you withdraw and the enemy halts, so be it; if they attack, wait until half have emerged, then strike swiftly."
Jia Lin said: "*Zhi* is where perilous ground allows mutual interception, so neither benefits from advancing first."
Du You said: "If the enemy feigns retreat to lure me, I do not pursue. Wait for them to advance, then strike—they can be defeated."

Mei Yaochen said: "When both sides occupy perilous ground, the first to advance will surely be defeated. If the enemy lures me with advantage, I must not covet it. Feign retreat to draw them out, then strike when half have emerged."

Wang Xi said: "If the enemy refuses to advance, set an ambush and withdraw, feigning deception to ensure they emerge."

Zhang Yu said: "‘Luring me’ means feigning retreat. Do not pursue; if I abandon the perilous ground, I will be vulnerable to their ambush. Instead, withdraw first. If the enemy pursues, wait until half have emerged—when their ranks are unsettled—and attack with elite troops to secure victory."

Li Jing’s *Art of War* states: "On terrain where neither side benefits, feign retreat and wait for half the enemy to emerge before intercepting them. For constricted terrain, if I occupy it first, I must fill it to await the enemy." Du You said: "‘Fill’ means to saturate. Deploy troops to fill the constriction, preventing the enemy from advancing or retreating."

If the enemy occupies it first, fill it and do not engage; if they do not fill it, then engage. Cao Cao said: "Constricted terrain refers to a pass between two mountains where the enemy cannot outmaneuver me. If I occupy it first, I must align my front with the pass, array my forces, and guard it to launch surprise attacks. If the enemy holds this ground first and aligns their front with the pass, do not engage. If they occupy only half the constriction, then engage to share the advantage."

Li Quan said: "‘Fill’ means to level. If the enemy guards the pass first, I should withdraw. Zhao Kuo failed to hold the mouth of Jingxing, allowing Han Xin to take it; Chen Xi did not hold the Zhang River, enabling Gaozu to seize it."

Du Mu said: "‘Fill’ means to saturate. When encountering a pass between two mountains with a connecting valley, one must camp at the mouth, aligning with the mountain passes like water filling a vessel to the brim." Du You said: "‘Aligning with the mouth’ also means filling it, like water filling a vessel to the rim. If I occupy it, I control both ease and peril, then launch surprise attacks to subdue the enemy. If the enemy occupies half the constriction, unaware of the principle of filling the pass, I should enter to engage them—for both sides share the terrain, and victory or defeat depends on me, not the ground."

The technique of aligning and filling applies not only to constricted terrain but also to any situation where a single path exists amid impassable plains, marshes, or unnavigable waters. One must control the route to prevent the enemy’s advance. All such cases are self-evident.

Chen Hao said: "It is correct to speak of arraying forces at the pass, but not of encamping there."

Jia Lin said: "‘Engage’ means to pursue; ‘fill’ means to solidify. If the enemy solidifies and saturates the pass, do not pursue or attack. If they are unprepared and empty, enter and strike."

Mei Yaochen’s annotation aligns with Du Mu’s; Wang Xi’s with Cao Cao’s.

Zhang Yu said: "Between high mountains lies a level valley. If I arrive first, I must fill the mountain pass with my array to block the enemy’s advance. I can launch surprise attacks, but they cannot disrupt me. If the enemy occupies this ground first and fills the pass with their array, do not engage. If they guard the pass but do not fill it, enter and engage to share the perilous advantage."

Wu Qi said: "Do not face the ‘heavenly furnace.’ The ‘heavenly furnace’ refers to the mouth of a great valley—one must not confront the pass directly."

For perilous terrain, if I occupy it first, I must hold the high and sunny ground to await the enemy. Du You said: "Occupy high and sunny ground to await the enemy. If they approach from the low and shady side, strike to prevail."

If the enemy occupies it first, withdraw and do not engage. Cao Cao said: "Perilous terrain must never be ceded to the enemy." Li Quan said: "On perilous ground, one must not lag behind others." Du Mu said: "Perilous terrain—steep mountains and deep valleys—cannot be altered by human effort. One must occupy the high and sunny ground to await the enemy. If the enemy seizes it first, do not contest it; withdraw instead. ‘Sunny’ refers to south-facing ground, lest the enemy endure while I, on the shady side, suffer illness. For example, at Xiaoshan or Mengjin, one should first occupy the northern mountains—this is facing shade and turning one’s back to the sun. Between height and sun, one may abandon the sun for height, but never height for the sun. Sunzi speaks generally."

Du You said: "Seizing perilous ground first prevents the enemy from gaining it." Mei Yaochen said: "Securing perilous and fortified ground, occupying the high and sunny, strengthens one to await the enemy. If the enemy seizes it first, engaging is perilous—withdraw without hesitation."

Wang Xi said: "This is also contested ground. Emperor Taizong of Tang first occupied Wugong to await Dou Jiande, exemplifying this principle."

Zhang Yu said: "Even on level ground, one should occupy advantageous positions first—how much more so on perilous terrain? Thus, securing the high and sunny allows one to await the enemy’s fatigue and prevail. If the enemy already holds this ground, retreat swiftly and do not engage."

When Pei Xingjian campaigned against the Turks, he once pitched camp at dusk, completing the moat and ramparts, then suddenly ordered a move to higher ground. His officers protested, deeming it unwise to exhaust the troops, but Xingjian insisted, and the relocation was swiftly executed. That night, a violent storm struck, flooding the original campsite to a depth of over ten feet. The officers were astonished and convinced. From this, it is clear that occupying high and sunny ground not only facilitates battle but also avoids the peril of flooding.

For distant terrain, when forces are evenly matched, it is difficult to provoke battle, and fighting is disadvantageous. Cao Cao said: "Provoking battle means luring the enemy." Li Quan said: "When evenly matched, provoking battle leaves the outcome uncertain."

Du Mu said: Suppose my camp and the enemy’s are thirty *li* apart. If I advance toward the enemy’s camp to provoke battle, I exhaust my own vigor while wearing down the enemy’s sharpness—thus fighting is disadvantageous. If the enemy advances toward my camp to provoke battle, I rest while the enemy labors—this too is disadvantageous for them. Hence, when forces are evenly matched, what then? He said: If battle is unavoidable, then move closer to one another.

Chen Hao said: When camps are far apart and forces evenly matched, provoking battle is difficult, and fighting brings no advantage. Thus, the following text states that when forces are equal, attacking ten with one is called "flight." To provoke battle, one must first assess whether one’s troops are strong enough to overpower the enemy; if not, one must not advance recklessly and court defeat.

Meng Shi said: When forces are evenly matched, provoking battle from afar is disadvantageous.

Du You said: "To provoke" means to engage the enemy. "Distant terrain" means being far from one’s homeland. When terrain and forces are evenly matched, with no unique advantage, initiating battle is unwise.

Mei Yaochen said: When forces are evenly matched, provoking battle brings fatigue, while luring the enemy brings ease.

Wang Xi said: Drawing the enemy from afar is exhausting.

Zhang Yu said: When camps are far apart and forces evenly matched, one should sit and lure the enemy, not provoke them to seek battle.

These six principles pertain to terrain; a general’s highest duty is to examine them closely.

Li Quan said: These are the strategic advantages of terrain. A general who does not understand them will fail.

Jia Lin said: Heaven creates terrain, which can be observed with the eyes.

Mei Yaochen said: Terrain is the foundation of military victory—how can one not assess it?

Zhang Yu said: A general must know the six types of terrain. Thus, armies may face flight, laxity, entrapment, collapse, disorder, or rout. These six outcomes are not the fault of heaven but of the general.

Jia Lin said: Flight, laxity, entrapment, collapse, disorder, and rout are all names for defeats of varying severity.

Zhang Yu said: These six failures stem from human error.

When forces are evenly matched, attacking ten with one is called "flight."

Cao Cao said: Failing to assess strength.

Li Quan said: Overestimating one’s strength. If one secures advantageous terrain and employs ambush tactics, it may yet succeed.

Du Mu said: The principle of attacking ten with one requires that the enemy’s generals be inferior in wisdom, their troops inferior in courage, and that they suffer from unfavorable weather, terrain, hunger, or fatigue—tenfold disadvantages. Only then can one attack ten with one. If forces are evenly matched and one cannot assess whether one’s single force can overcome the enemy’s tenfold, then one must flee and cannot regroup or hold position.

Mei Yaochen said: Though forces may be evenly matched, if one’s troops are few, attacking the many is the path to flight.

Wang Xi said: Fleeing without engaging.

Zhang Yu said: "Evenly matched" means the generals’ wisdom and courage, and the troops’ sharpness or dullness, are all comparable. When forces are balanced, one cannot lightly engage; how much less can one attack the many with the few without fleeing?

When soldiers are strong and officers weak, it is called "laxity."

Cao Cao said: Officers cannot command, so discipline collapses.

Du Mu said: When soldiers are unruly and generals weak, unable to control them, discipline slackens and the army disintegrates. In the early years of the Changqing era, Tian Bu was ordered to lead the Wei forces against Wang Tingcou. Bu had long been in Wei, and the people there treated him lightly. Tens of thousands of soldiers rode donkeys to camp, and Bu could not stop them. After several months, when he sought battle, the troops scattered. Bu died by his own hand.

Jia Lin said: When commands are disobeyed and authority unheeded, disorder arises—how can the army not collapse?

Mei Yaochen said: Without proper command, military governance decays.

Wang Xi’s note is the same as Cao Cao’s.

He Shi said: When soldiers are unruly and generals weak, unable to lead, discipline collapses and the army disintegrates.

Zhang Yu said: When soldiers are fierce and officers weak, unable to command or restrain them, military governance decays. During the Wu-Chu conflict, Wu’s Prince Guang said: "The Chu army has many favorites, its policies are inconsistent, its commanders lowly and undisciplined, lacking decisive authority—Chu can be defeated." Indeed, he crushed the Chu forces.

When officers are strong and soldiers weak, it is called "entrapment."

Cao Cao said: Officers press forward, but weak soldiers are easily trapped—defeat follows.

Li Quan said: Entrapment means defeat. When soldiers are weak and divided, they cannot fight, so the strong are trapped.

Du Mu said: When seeking to attack, if soldiers are cowardly and weak, yet one advances recklessly without assessing strength, they will be trapped in deadly terrain.

Chen Hao said: All men have blood and spirit—who lacks the will to fight? But if generals lack discipline and virtue, and soldiers lack training, all become cowardly and useless.

Jia Lin said: When soldiers are feeble and will not advance even when drums beat, and officers fight alone, they are merely trapped.

Mei Yaochen said: Though officers press forward, they cannot inspire courage, so they are trapped in death.

Wang Xi said: Trapped by their subordinates.

Zhang Yu said: When officers are bold and eager to fight, but soldiers lack training and cannot unite in courage, using them will lead to destruction.

When high-ranking officers are angry and insubordinate, and in battle rush forward without assessing their ability, it is called "collapse."

Cao Cao said: High-ranking officers are junior generals. If the supreme commander angers them and they remain unyielding, rushing into battle in fury without weighing the odds, they will surely collapse.

Li Quan said: When a general is enraged by the enemy and, without assessing strength or weakness, drives his soldiers forward as if their lives were his to command, collapse is certain.

Du Mu said: During the Spring and Autumn period, the Viscount of Chu attacked Zheng, and the Jin army came to its aid. Wu Can advised the Viscount of Chu: "Jin’s governance is newly established, and its commands cannot yet be enforced. Its deputy, Xian Gu, is stubborn and unkind, unwilling to follow orders. Its three commanders act independently, ignoring superiors and leaving the troops without clear direction. On this campaign, the Jin army will surely be defeated." Jin’s Wei Qi, angered at being denied a noble rank, sought to sabotage the Jin army. He requested to lead the vanguard but was refused; he then asked to be sent as an envoy, and this was permitted. He went to provoke battle and returned. Zhao Zhan, denied a ministerial post, requested to challenge the enemy but was refused; he then asked to summon an alliance, which was allowed. Both he and Wei Qi were dispatched with orders. Que Ke said: "Two resentful men have gone forth. If we do not prepare, we will surely be defeated." Sui Hui said: "If these two enrage the Chu forces, and Chu attacks while we are unprepared, our army will be lost without doubt." But Xian Gu said: "We must not prepare." Sui Hui then sent Gong Shuo and Han Chuan to set seven ambushes before Mount Ao. Thus, the upper army was not defeated, but the central and lower armies were indeed routed. The "seven ambushes" were seven concealed positions; Mount Ao is a mountain. Chen Hao said: This occurs when a high-ranking general, without reason, angers a junior officer, leaving him inwardly resentful. Seizing on this grievance, the officer, upon encountering the enemy, fights recklessly without regard for his own ability, leading to utter defeat. Jia Lin said: "Collapse" means to fall from above. When high-ranking and junior officers do not submit to one another, collapse is inevitable. If the general further fails to assess his own ability or know his soldiers’ courage or cowardice, forcing them to fight the enemy, he invites destruction—is this not collapse from above? Mei Yaochen said: When a junior officer is angry and insubordinate, and upon meeting the enemy fights with blind resentment, bringing about his own collapse, it is because the general did not know his ability. Wang Xi said: This refers to a general who angers others without reason and does not recognize his subordinates’ talents, provoking their reckless fury—like a mountain collapsing. He Shi said: When the three armies unite in strength and the ranks are of one mind, victory is assured. Zhang Yu said: Generally, when all officers share a single purpose and the three armies unite in strength, they can defeat the enemy. But when junior officers are resentful and defy the high general’s commands, seeking mutual destruction, and upon meeting the enemy fight without assessing their ability, collapse is inevitable. This was the case when Jin attacked Qin, and Xun Yan issued his order: "At cock’s crow, harness the chariots—follow only the direction of my horse’s head." Yue Shu, enraged, said: "The fate of Jin does not rest with this man!" and abandoned the campaign to return home. It was also seen when Zhao Chuan, hating Yu Pian, drove him to Qin, and when Wei Qi, furious with the Jin army, turned against Chu.

When a general is weak and undisciplined, his teachings unclear, officers and soldiers lack constancy, and battle formations are deployed haphazardly, it is called "disorder."

Cao Cao said: For a general to act thus is the way to disorder. Li Quan said: If a general exhibits even one of these faults, it is the way to disorder. Du Mu said: When officers and soldiers are not bound by regular standards, and troops are drawn up in battle lines that are sometimes vertical, sometimes horizontal, this is self-inflicted disorder. Jia Lin said: When authority and commands are not strict and clear, soldiers lack consistent discipline—how could the army not be disordered? This refers to a general who lacks strict commands and fails to enforce rewards and punishments. Mei Yaochen said: If a general is weak and undisciplined, soldiers lack constant restraint; if his teachings are unclear, battle formations will be deployed in disarray. This is the way to disorder. Wang Xi said: Disorder leads to defeat without end. Zhang Yu said: A "weak and undisciplined" general lacks virtue and power; "teachings unclear" means training lacks ancient methods; "officers and soldiers lack constancy" means commanders are not long in their posts; "battle formations deployed haphazardly" means soldiers lack discipline. For a general to act thus is the way to self-inflicted disorder.

When a general cannot assess the enemy, matching the few against the many, the weak against the strong, and his troops lack a vanguard of elite soldiers, it is called "rout."

Cao Cao said: In such a situation, the army is certain to flee. Li Quan said: Military defeat is called "rout," stemming from failure to assess the enemy. Du Mu said: The military methods of Duke Wei Li Jing include the "vanguard formation," referring to the selection of bold and courageous soldiers to serve as the forward assault in every battle. The *Methods of the Sima* states: "Select the finest and decide the battle, augmenting the army’s strength." The commentary explains: "Brave, swift, and agile soldiers who fail to achieve victory in the first engagement must be selected from the rear for the next, to rouse their sharpness." When the Eastern Jin Grand General Xie Xuan was stationed in Guangling, facing the formidable Fu Jian, he recruited many brave and vigorous men. Liu Laozhi, He Qian, Zhuge Kan, Gao Heng, Liu Gui, Tian Luo, and Sun Wuzhong, renowned for their ferocity, answered the call. Xie Xuan placed Liu Laozhi in command of the elite vanguard, achieving victory in every battle and earning the name "Northern Prefecture Army." The enemy feared them, and wherever they advanced, they triumphed. Jia Lin said: If the vanguard’s sharpness is not selected, and soldiers’ courage or cowardice is unknown, deploying troops in this manner is to invite retreat. Mei Yaochen said: Failing to gauge the enemy’s strength, matching the few against the many, and not selecting elite soldiers to strike the strong with the weak—these are all reasons for rout. He Shi said: Fatigued and brave soldiers must not be mixed together. If they are, the brave will not be encouraged, and the weary will find refuge in their ranks, advancing without fighting and bringing about their own defeat. Thus, the military methods state: "An army without a vanguard of elite soldiers is called 'rout.'" In ancient times, Qi relied on its "skilled strikers," Wei on its "martial troops," Qin on its "sharp soldiers," and Han on the "knights of the Three Rivers," "sword experts," and "men of extraordinary talent." Wu called them "trouble-solvers," Qi "life-riskers," and Tang "leaping raiders"—all alternative names for elite vanguards. No military tactic is more effective than this. Once the army is assembled, the high general must command each camp to select its finest and most agile soldiers—those whose martial skills surpass the rest. These are organized into separate units, roughly one selected from every ten men, one thousand from every ten thousand.

The selection must be kept few in number but must be precisely chosen. Appoint trusted and capable generals to command them. From the general’s personal guard to the vanguard and ambush troops, all should be allocated according to their rank and ability.

Zhang Yu states: If one deploys a small force against a large one, drives the weak against the strong, and yet fails to select the most valiant soldiers to serve as the vanguard, defeat is certain.

The reason every battle must employ the finest troops as the vanguard is twofold: first, to bolster our own morale, and second, to break the enemy’s spirit. Thus, the *Wei Liaozi* states: "If martial warriors are not selected, the army will not be strong." Cao Cao used Zhang Liao as his vanguard to defeat the Xianbei, and Xie Xuan placed Liu Laozhi in command of his elite troops to resist Fu Jian—these are examples of such strategy.

These six factors are the paths to defeat. Chen Hao says: The first is failing to assess relative strength; the second, lacking discipline and virtue; the third, neglecting training; the fourth, waging war out of irrational anger; the fifth, failing to enforce orders; and the sixth, not selecting the bold and resolute. These are called the Six Defeats. A general’s paramount duty is to examine them carefully.

Zhang Yu states: The six matters above are the certain roads to defeat.

Terrain is an auxiliary to warfare.
Du Mu says: The essence of warfare lies in benevolence, righteousness, and discipline. If one gains the advantage of terrain, it can serve as an aid to victory.
*Assist* is also written as *ease*.
Chen Hao says: Heaven’s timing is not as advantageous as terrain.
Meng Shi says: Terrain’s advantage depends on human effort.
Jia Lin says: Though victory lies with the troops, favorable terrain makes success easier—hence it is called the army’s ease. Mountains can block, water can flood, high ground defeats low, and rugged terrain defeats flat.

Wang Xi says: The Dao of warfare lies in people.
Zhang Yu says: To scrutinize terrain is merely an auxiliary to warfare, a secondary matter. Assessing the enemy and securing victory is the foundation. Assessing the enemy, calculating the advantages of terrain—whether perilous or open, near or far—this is the way of a supreme general.
Du Mu says: The costs of provisions, the strength of men and horses, the advantages of attack and defense—all depend on the peril or openness of the terrain and its distance. To master these in order to control the enemy is the pinnacle of generalship.
Wang Xi says: To exhaustively analyze the enemy’s situation and the benefits or harms of terrain’s peril or distance—this is the Dao of warfare.
He Shi says: To know the enemy and the land is the general’s duty.
Zhang Yu says: If one can discern the enemy’s true strength or weakness and also gauge the shape of the terrain—whether perilous or open, near or far—grasping both root and branch, then the way of generalship is complete. He who knows these and wages war will surely triumph; he who does not and wages war will surely fail.

Du Mu says: This refers to knowing the peril or openness of the terrain and its distance.
Mei Yaochen says: If a general knows both terrain and military governance, he will win; if he knows neither, he will lose.
Zhang Yu says: If one knows both the enemy’s situation and the advantages of terrain, victory in battle is assured; if one knows neither, defeat is certain.

Thus, if the way of battle ensures victory, even if the ruler orders no battle, one may fight. If the way of battle does not ensure victory, even if the ruler orders battle, one may refrain.
Li Quan says: If the way to victory is secured, one must fight; if it is lost, one must not fight.

The ruler is the one who initiates action.
Du Mu says: The ruler is the sovereign.
The *Huangshi Gong* states: When leading troops into battle, the general must have independent authority. If the ruler interferes in advance or retreat, success will be difficult. Thus, enlightened sovereigns and wise kings kneel and push the chariot wheel, saying: "Matters beyond the frontier are for the general to decide."
Meng Shi says: Better to disobey the ruler than to go against the will of the troops.
Mei Yaochen says: When the general is in the field, he need not heed the ruler’s commands.
Zhang Yu says: If there is a certain path to victory, even if the ruler orders no battle, one may fight. If there is no certain path to victory, even if the ruler orders battle, one may refrain. Better to disobey orders and succeed than to follow them and fail—hence it is said: "Within the army, one does not hear the Son of Heaven’s decrees."

Thus, in advancing, one does not seek fame; in retreating, one does not avoid blame.
Wang Xi says: This is all for the sake of loyalty to the state.
He Shi says: In advancing, does one seek fame? No—one advances when it benefits the state and the people. In retreating, does one avoid blame? No—if advancing would harm the state and devastate the people, even if the ruler orders it, one does not advance, and though punishment may fall, one does not regret it.

One protects the people alone, and aligns with the ruler’s interests—such a one is the state’s treasure.
Li Quan says: In advancing or retreating, one protects the people, not oneself.
Du Mu says: One does not seek the fame of victory in advancing, nor does one avoid the crime of disobedience in retreating. Such a general is the state’s precious treasure—rare to find.
Chen Hao says: *Aligns* means *returns to*.
Mei Yaochen says: Better to disobey orders and win than to obey and lose.
Wang Zhe says: Whether to fight or not, all is for the sake of protecting the people and benefiting the ruler.
Zhang Yu says: In advancing or retreating against orders, one does not act for oneself but to protect the people and align with the ruler’s interests. Such a one is a loyal minister, the state’s treasure.

Regard your soldiers as infants, and they will follow you into the deepest ravines; regard them as beloved sons, and they will die with you.
Li Quan says: If one treats them thus, they will give their lives in return.
Thus, with a single word from the Lord of Chu, the soldiers of his three armies felt as if wrapped in warm silk.
Du Mu says: In the Warring States period, Wu Qi served as a general. He dressed, ate, and slept like the lowest of his soldiers. He did not use a mat when resting, did not ride a horse when traveling, and personally carried supplies, sharing their hardships. When a soldier suffered from an ulcer, Wu Qi sucked the pus from it. The soldier’s mother, upon hearing this, wept. Someone asked: "Your son is but a common soldier, yet the general himself sucked his wound—why do you weep?" The mother replied: "Years ago, Lord Wu sucked his father’s wound, and his father did not turn back but died in battle."

Now again he sucks this child’s wound—how can I know where he will die?
Mei Yaochen says: Nurture them with care, and they will remain close and never leave; love them and urge them on, and they will trust without doubt. Thus, though death comes, they die with you; though peril comes, they face it with you.
Wang Xi says: This is to bind men’s hearts with kindness and grace.
He Shi says: As in later Han, when Duan Jiong served as General Who Breaks the Qiang. On campaign against the Western Qiang, he showed deep care for his soldiers, personally visiting the wounded and binding their wounds with his own hands. For over a decade on the frontier, he never once slept on a mat, sharing hardship with his officers and men—thus all were glad to fight to the death for him. When Jin’s Wang Jun was governor of Ba Commandery, which bordered Wu, the soldiers suffered under heavy labor, and many newborn sons were abandoned. Wang Jun then tightened regulations but lightened corvée duties, granting those who bore children exemption and rest. Thousands of lives were thus preserved. Later, when he launched his campaign against Wu, those saved in Ba Commandery were all fit for military service. Their parents exhorted them: “Lord Wang gave you life—you must strive for him and not shrink from death.” Thus Wu’s forces faced an army of fathers and sons.
Zhang Yu says: If a general treats his soldiers as sons, they will regard him as a father. Never has a father faced danger without his sons rushing to die for him. Thus Xun Qing said: “A minister’s service to his lord, a subordinate’s to his superior, is like a younger brother’s to an elder, like hands and feet protecting the head and eyes.” Fine wine flows freely, and the whole army grows drunk; a single warm word, and the soldiers feel as if wrapped in silk. Truly, the way one treats subordinates with grace was prized by the ancients. Thus the *Art of War* says: When the army toils, the general must go first—he does not raise an umbrella in the heat, nor wear layered robes in the cold; on perilous paths, he dismounts and walks. He drinks only after the army’s well is dug, eats only after the army’s food is cooked, rests only after the army’s camp is built. If you are generous but cannot command, loving but cannot order, disorderly but cannot govern, they are like spoiled children—useless.
Cao Cao says: Grace alone cannot be relied upon, nor punishment alone. Like a spoiled child’s whims, they will turn to harm and prove useless.
Li Quan says: Though you love them deeply, if they become like spoiled children with rebellious hearts, they cannot be used.
Du Mu says: The *Three Strategies of Huang Shigong* states: “Soldiers may be humbled but must not be spoiled.” Grace nurtures them, humility treats them well—hence “may be humbled.” Law restrains them—hence “must not be spoiled.” The *Yinfu Jing* says: “Harm arises from grace.” Wu Qi said: “Drums, gongs, and bells strike awe into the ears; banners and insignia strike awe into the eyes; prohibitions and punishments strike awe into the heart. Ears awed by sound cannot but be sharp; eyes awed by sight cannot but be clear; hearts awed by punishment cannot but be stern. If these three are not established, defeat by the enemy is certain.” Thus, when a general raises his hand, none fail to follow; where he points, none fail to advance to their deaths.
Li Jing, Duke of Wei, said: The finest generals of old could execute three out of ten soldiers, and the next best one out of ten. Executing three out of ten strikes terror into enemy nations; executing one out of ten ensures orders are obeyed throughout the army. Those who fear me do not fear the enemy; those who fear the enemy do not fear me. Reward every good deed, no matter how small; punish every fault, no matter how minor. When Ma Su’s army was defeated, Zhuge Liang wept as he carried out the execution. When a villager stole a bamboo hat, Lü Meng shed tears before beheading him. When a horse trampled crops, Cao Cao cut his own hair as punishment. When two officials were found guilty, Huang Gai interrogated and executed them both. Thus, when awe overcomes love, even a small force will prevail; when love overcomes awe, even a large force will fail.
Meng Shi says: If you focus only on grace, once the power of grace is established, punishment will breed resentment. If you focus only on punishment, once resentment runs deep, grace will not win them over. You must blend grace and awe, reward and punishment—only then can you be a general, only then can you lead the masses.
Mei Yaochen says: If you nurture them generously but cannot command, dote on them but do not teach them, allow disorder but do not govern them, they are like spoiled children—how can they be of use?
Wang Xi says: Grace without strictness cannot succeed.
He Shi says: Grace cannot be used alone; used alone, it will turn to harm.
Zhang Yu says: Grace cannot be used exclusively, nor punishment alone. If you rely solely on grace, soldiers become like spoiled children and cannot be commanded. This is why Cao Cao cut his own hair as punishment, why Zhuge Liang wept as he carried out executions, why Yang Su’s blood flowed before him yet he laughed as if nothing had happened, why Li Jing executed three out of ten to ensure his men feared him more than the enemy. If you rely solely on punishment, soldiers will not draw close and cannot be used. This is why ancient generals would pour out wine, why the Lord of Chu wrapped his men in silk, why Wu Qi shared his clothes and food, why Helü shared their labor and rest. In the *Book of Changes*, the *Initial Six* of the *Army* hexagram says, “The army marches by law,” meaning to unite the masses through discipline. The *Nine in the Second* says, “The army receives Heaven’s favor,” meaning to encourage soldiers with rewards. From this we see that the armies of true kings balance virtue and punishment, grace and awe.
The *Weiliaozi* says: “If you do not please their hearts, they will not serve you; if you do not strike awe into their hearts, they will not rise for you.” Thus, the good general relies on both love and awe.
If you know your troops are fit to strike but do not know the enemy cannot be struck, your chance of victory is half. Mei Yaochen says: Knowing yourself but not the enemy may still bring victory.
If you know the enemy can be struck but do not know your troops are unfit to strike, your chance of victory is half. Du Mu says: “Can be struck” means they are brave and scorn death.

Those unfit to strike are weary, exhausted, timid, or weak. Chen Hao says: This explanation is incorrect. Whether an enemy can or cannot be struck depends on which army is stronger in numbers, which troops are better trained, and which side enforces rewards and punishments more clearly. Mei Yaochen says: Knowing the enemy but not yourself may still bring victory. Wang Xi says: Knowing yourself but not the enemy, or knowing the enemy but not yourself, neither guarantees victory. Zhang Yu says: Some know themselves but not the enemy; some know the enemy but not themselves—thus, victory or defeat may follow.

Emperor Taizong of Tang says: When I once faced the enemy in battle, I first assessed whether the enemy’s mind or my own was more discerning, and only then could I truly know them. I examined whether the enemy’s *qi* or my own was more ordered, and only then could I truly know myself. This means weighing the clarity of intentions and the order of *qi* to discern strength and weakness—whether to engage or not.

If you know the enemy can be struck and your troops are fit to strike, but do not know the terrain is unfit for battle, your chance of victory is half. Cao Cao and Li Quan say: A fifty-percent chance of victory is still uncertain. Du Mu says: Terrain refers to its hazards or ease, distance or proximity, entry and exit points, and whether it is circuitous or direct. Mei Yaochen says: Knowing the enemy and yourself but not the terrain may still lead to defeat. Wang Xi says: Even if you know both enemy and self are fit for battle, you must not forfeit the advantage of terrain. Zhang Yu says: Though you know yourself and the enemy, without the aid of terrain, you cannot secure complete victory.

Thus, one who truly knows warfare moves without confusion and acts without exhaustion. Du Mu says: Before moving or acting, victory or defeat is already decided—hence, movement is never confused, and action is never exhausted. Another version reads: moves without entanglement and acts without weariness. Chen Hao says: *Exhaustion* here means entanglement. If I understand the enemy’s movements and my own, and assess the gains and losses of terrain, then advancing brings no confusion, and battle brings no entanglement. Mei Yaochen says: Knowing all, one moves without blindness and acts without exhaustion. Wang Xi says: One skilled in strategy is never confused; one skilled in warfare is never exhausted. Zhang Yu says: Not moving recklessly ensures no mistakes; not acting lightly ensures no entanglement. Only after discerning the enemy’s and one’s own strengths and weaknesses, and securing the advantages of terrain, should one fight.

Thus it is said: Know the enemy and know yourself, and victory will not be imperiled. Zhang Yu says: Mastering the arts of attack and defense ensures victory without danger. Know Heaven and know Earth, and victory will know no bounds. Li Quan says: When human affairs, Heaven’s timing, and Earth’s advantages are all understood, every battle is won. Du You says: Know the advantages of terrain and the seasons of Heaven. Terrain’s advantages lie in relying on hazards, facing high and sunny ground; Heaven’s seasons lie in following cold and heat, and aligning with punitive and virtuous *qi*. If you know both enemy and self, and further align with terrain and the Dao of Heaven, victory can be complete—what difficulty remains? Mei Yaochen says: Knowing the enemy’s advantage and your own ensures no peril; knowing Heaven’s timing and Earth’s terrain ensures no limit. Wang Xi’s note agrees with Mei Yaochen. Zhang Yu says: Following Heaven’s timing and securing Earth’s advantages, victory has no end.

*Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Ten ends*
*Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Eleven: "Nine Terrains"*

Cao Cao says: There are nine types of terrain for battle.
Li Quan says: There are nine terrains where victory over the enemy may be decided, hence the discussion follows "Terrain."
Wang Xi says: In the terrains where armies operate, advantages and disadvantages number nine.
Zhang Yu says: In the terrains where armies operate, their strategic conditions number nine. This discusses terrain’s strategic conditions, hence it follows "Terrain."

Sunzi says: In the methods of using armies, there is *dispersive terrain*, *light terrain*, *contentious terrain*, *intersecting terrain*, *thoroughfare terrain*, *heavy terrain*, *impassable terrain*, *encircled terrain*, and *death terrain*.

Cao Cao says: These are the names of the nine terrains.
Zhang Yu says: These are the names of the nine terrains.

When feudal lords fight on their own land, it is *dispersive terrain*.
Cao Cao says: Soldiers cling to their homeland; the proximity makes them easily scattered.
Li Quan says: Soldiers rely on their native soil, cherish their wives and children, and scatter when pressed—this is *dispersive terrain*.
Du Mu says: Soldiers are near their homes; they lack the resolve to fight to the death and have places to flee.
Du You says: Fighting on one’s own territory, soldiers’ minds are not single-minded; they harbor thoughts of breaking and scattering—hence it is called *dispersive terrain*.
Mei Yaochen concurs with Du Mu’s note.
Wang Xi concurs with Cao Cao’s note.
He [Yan]shi says: In *dispersive terrain*, soldiers rely on it, cherish their wives and children, and scatter when pressed—this is *dispersive terrain*. One says: terrain without strategic passes, where soldiers easily scatter; those stationed here cannot fight repeatedly. Another says: terrain far and level on all sides, without critical strongholds, where resolve is weak and easily broken—hence it is called *dispersive terrain*.

King of Wu asked Sun Wu: In *dispersive terrain*, soldiers think of home and cannot be made to fight; thus, one must firmly defend and not sally forth. If the enemy attacks our small cities, plunders our fields, cuts off our firewood-gathering, blocks our vital roads, and waits until we are depleted before launching a swift attack—what should be done?
Sun Wu replied: If the enemy deeply penetrates our capital, they will have many soldiers with their backs to cities, treating the army as home, and will fight with single-minded ferocity. Our troops, being in our own land, are attached to the soil and cling to life; in formation, they are not steadfast, and in battle, they do not prevail. One should gather the people in great numbers, amass grain and silk, defend cities and secure strategic points, and send light troops to sever their supply lines. If they challenge for battle and receive no response, and their provisions fail to arrive, with nothing to plunder in the wilds, the three armies will be distressed and starving. Seizing this opportunity to lure them will yield success. If one wishes to fight in the open, one must rely on the terrain, set ambushes in strategic points, or, lacking such points, conceal oneself in overcast, dark, or foggy weather to exploit their laxity. Striking unexpectedly and ambushing their negligence can yield success.

Zhang Yu says: Fighting within one’s borders, soldiers think of home—this is terrain where they are easily scattered. When the people of Yun intended to attack the Chu army, Chu’s Dou Lian said: "The Zheng army is camped in their outskirts and will surely not be on guard; relying on the proximity of their city, they will lack fighting spirit." Indeed, they were defeated by Chu—this is an example.

When entering another’s land but not deeply, it is *light terrain*.
Cao Cao says: Soldiers all lightly return.
Du Mu says: When the army crosses the border, one must burn boats and bridges to show the people there is no thought of retreat.
Li Quan says: They are light in retreating.
Mei Yaochen says: Entering the enemy’s land but not far, the way back is short and retreat is easy.
Wang Xi says: Initially entering enemy territory, the situation is light, and soldiers lack fighting spirit.
He [Yan]shi says: *Light terrain* is terrain where retreat is easy. Entering enemy territory but not deeply, going and returning are easy, and one cannot halt or rest; the general must not repeatedly exhaust the people.

King of Wu asked Sun Wu: When I reach *light terrain*, having just entered enemy territory, soldiers long to return, advancing is difficult and retreating easy; without the protection of strategic hazards, the three armies are fearful. The commander wishes to advance, but the soldiers wish to retreat—superiors and subordinates are at odds. If the enemy defends their fortifications, arrays their chariots and cavalry, and either blocks our front or strikes our rear—what should be done?
Sun Wu replied: When the army reaches *light terrain*, soldiers are not yet single-minded; entering is their priority, not fighting. Thus, do not approach their famous cities or pass through their thoroughfares. Set up deceptive and confusing displays, feigning departure. Select elite cavalry, have them hold bits in their mouths, and enter first to seize their cattle, horses, and livestock. When the three armies see gains, they will no longer fear advancing. Divide our elite troops and secretly set ambushes; if the enemy comes, strike without hesitation. If they do not come, leave and depart.

Another says: When the army enters enemy territory and the enemy fortifies their ramparts without fighting, soldiers long to return, and retreat is difficult—this is *light terrain*. One should select elite soldiers to ambush key roads; if we retreat and the enemy pursues, strike when they come.

Zhang Yu says: Initially entering enemy territory, soldiers long to return—this is terrain where retreat is easy. The *Wei Liaozi* says: When conscripted troops are divided and return, or face battle and flee north, the losses are severe. This means that when civilian soldiers are assembled from all directions and divided into encampments occupying land, those coming from the north are assigned to the northern route, and many flee because the way is open.

Where what we gain is advantageous and what the enemy gains is also advantageous, it is *contentious terrain*.
Cao Cao says: Where the few can defeat the many, the weak can strike the strong.
Li Quan says: This is terrain guarding strategic choke points; the first to occupy it wins—hence it is *contentious terrain*.
Du Mu says: Terrain that must be contested is strategically critical. Former Qin’s Fu Jian first sent his general Lü Guang to subdue the Western Regions. After Fu Jian’s defeat, Lü Guang returned from the Western Regions. When his army reached Yihe, Fu Jian’s Liangzhou Prefect Liang Xi plotted to resist him. Yang Han, the Governor of Gaochang, said: "Lü Guang has just pacified the Western Regions; his troops are strong and their morale is high—their advance cannot be withstood. If they emerge from the Flowing Sands, their intentions will be hard to gauge. The Gaowu Gorge is a strategic point; we should first defend it and cut off their water supply..."

When the enemy is thus trapped and parched with thirst, their troops will naturally cast down their weapons. If one deems the Gaowu Gorge too distant to hold, the Yiwu Pass may also serve to block them. Should both these critical points be abandoned, no strategy will avail. There are places one must contest—this is precisely such an opportunity. Liang Xi refused to heed this counsel and was ultimately destroyed by Lü Guang.

Chen Hao says: If either side first secures such terrain, it may use the few to defeat the many, the weak to overcome the strong.
Du You says: This refers to mountain passes or river choke points, where the advantages of natural barriers make them contested by both sides.
Mei Yaochen says: Neither side holds it first—whoever seizes it gains the advantage.
Wang Xi concurs with Chen Hao’s annotation.
He Shi says: *Contentious terrain* is strategically advantageous ground; the first to occupy it prevails, hence it is contested.

King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “If the enemy arrives first, occupies key positions, fortifies their defenses, trains their troops, and deploys flexibly—sometimes advancing, sometimes holding—while preparing to counter my surprise maneuvers, what should I do?”
Sun Wu replied: “The principle of *contentious terrain* is that the first to secure it gains the advantage. If the enemy has already taken such a position, do not attack it. Instead, feign retreat, raise banners, beat drums, and rush toward what they cherish, dragging branches to raise dust and confuse their senses. Meanwhile, conceal elite troops in ambush. The enemy will surely sally forth to rescue their interests. Where others desire, I advance; where others abandon, I seize—this is the way to contest the initiative. If I arrive first and the enemy employs this tactic, select my finest troops to hold the position firmly, send light forces to pursue them, and conceal ambushes in treacherous terrain. When the enemy turns to fight, the ambush will strike from the flanks—this is the way to complete victory.”

Zhang Yu says: Where natural barriers offer strategic advantage, whichever side secures them—whether us or the enemy—can use the few to defeat the many, the weak to overcome the strong. Such is the terrain that must be contested. Emperor Taizong of Tang, with three thousand men guarding the strategic pass at Chenggao, immobilized the hundred thousand troops of Dou Jiande—this is such a case.

Where I may advance and the enemy may approach is called *intersecting terrain*.
Cao Cao says: The roads intersect directly.
Du Mu says: Broad plains and level ground allow free movement for both sides, facilitating direct confrontation.
Chen Hao says: *Intersecting* means the roads crisscross, enabling both sides to come and go. In such terrain, troops must maintain unbroken formations, and vigilance is essential. Hence the following text states: “In *intersecting terrain*, I will carefully guard my positions”—its meaning is evident.
Du You says: *Intersecting terrain* has multiple routes, allowing free passage that cannot be severed.
Mei Yaochen concurs with Chen Hao’s annotation.
He Shi says: *Intersecting terrain* refers to open plains with interconnected roads. Alternatively, it may mean terrain where alliances can be forged but not severed, for severing them breeds enmity. It is also described as land where routes extend in all directions, making blockades impossible.

King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “In *intersecting terrain*, if I wish to cut off the enemy’s approach, I must order my border cities to fortify their defenses, sever communication routes, and secure the passes. But if I fail to plan ahead and the enemy is already prepared, they may come while I cannot advance, our forces are evenly matched—what then?”
Sun Wu replied: “If I cannot advance but the enemy can approach, I will divide my troops and conceal them, appearing lax in defense to lull them into complacency. When the enemy nears, set ambushes in hidden shelters and strike unexpectedly—this can yield success.”

Zhang Yu says: Terrain with multiple routes, allowing free passage that cannot be blocked, is *intersecting terrain*.

Where the lands of several feudal lords converge, the first to arrive and win the allegiance of the realm is said to hold *thoroughfare terrain*.
Cao Cao says: The first to arrive gains the support of the state.
Li Quan says: Beside the enemy lies a neighboring state; the first to establish communication with it wins its allegiance.
Du Mu says: *Thoroughfare terrain* is where three states converge. I must arrive first at the strategic junction, control its topography, and forge alliances with the neighboring states. “The realm” here refers to the feudal lords.
Mei Yaochen says: Where my forces and the enemy’s face each other, and a neighboring state lies at the convergence of three fronts, the first to arrive gains the support of the feudal lords.
Wang Xi says: Cao Cao states that the first to arrive gains the state’s support. I interpret “first to arrive” as establishing diplomatic ties first. “Winning the realm” means securing broad support, thereby uniting the feudal lords.
He Shi says: *Thoroughfare terrain* is a strategic hub controlling multiple routes. The first to occupy it will win the allegiance of the masses—hence securing it brings stability, while losing it invites peril.

King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “In *thoroughfare terrain*, the first to act gains the advantage. But if my forces are distant and set out later, even with swift chariots and galloping horses, I cannot arrive first—what then?”
Sun Wu replied: “Where the lands of several feudal lords converge, with routes extending in all directions, my forces and the enemy’s face each other, and a neighboring state lies nearby. The so-called ‘first’ refers to dispatching envoys with generous gifts and humble demeanor to negotiate alliances with the neighboring states, fostering friendship and goodwill. Even if my troops arrive later, the people’s allegiance will already be secured. With their support, the enemy loses their allies. The neighboring states will coordinate their efforts, drums will thunder in unison, and the enemy, struck with terror, will not know where to turn.”

Zhang Yu says: *Thoroughfare* refers to land with routes extending in all directions. My enemy faces me on one side, while neighboring states lie on the other three, all connected. I must go and forge alliances with them as my support. “First to arrive” means dispatching envoys with generous gifts to negotiate alliances with the neighboring states. Even if my troops arrive later, I will have already secured their support.

Where one penetrates deeply into enemy territory, leaving many cities and towns behind, it is called *heavy terrain*.
Cao Cao says: Land from which return is difficult.
Li Quan says: Terrain requiring unwavering resolve. Bai Qi’s campaign against Chu and Yue Yi’s conquest of Qi were both *heavy terrain*.
Du Mu says: Having advanced deep into enemy territory and passed many cities, with river crossings and key routes already under their control, retreat becomes impossible.

Du You says: Difficult to return. *Bei* (背) means "to leave"; *bei* is interchangeable with *bei* (倍). *Many* refers to distance. Far from one’s own cities and fortresses, deeply penetrating enemy territory, with single-minded resolve—this is called *heavy terrain*.

Mei Yaochen says: Advancing through a gap, the deeper one penetrates, the more cities one passes. With river crossings and strategic passes cut off, this is called *heavy and difficult terrain*.

Wang Xi says: When troops reach this point, the situation is grave.

He [Shi] says: In *heavy terrain*, having entered deep into enemy territory, provisions from the homeland are hard to supply. If the officers and soldiers do not plunder, what will they take? King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “If I lead my troops deep into *heavy terrain*, crossing many obstacles, with supply lines severed, and wish to return, the situation makes passage impossible. If I seek provisions from the enemy while keeping my forces intact, what should I do?”

Sun Wu replied: “In *heavy terrain*, when the soldiers are bold and transport routes are blocked, plunder to sustain yourselves. Whatever grain and silk the troops obtain should be offered to their superiors. Those who contribute more will be rewarded, and the soldiers will have no thought of returning. If you wish to withdraw, prepare defenses: dig deep moats and raise high ramparts to signal to the enemy that you intend to stay long. When the enemy suspects the main routes, secretly clear the critical paths. Then send light chariots moving silently, using oxen and horses as bait. If the enemy emerges, sound the drums and pursue them. Conceal your troops and coordinate with them at the appointed time. With internal and external forces responding in unison, their defeat is assured.”

Zhang Yu says: Deeply penetrating enemy territory, passing many enemy cities, with the soldiers’ hearts set and no thought of returning—this is *terrain difficult to retreat from*. As Sima Jingwang said of Zhuge Ke’s armored advance: “His momentum is unstoppable.”

Where one traverses mountains, forests, perilous defiles, or marshes—any terrain difficult to traverse—this is called *ruined terrain*.

Cao Cao says: Lacking solidity.

Jia Lin says: *Ruined* refers to land destroyed by water. In marshy, ruined terrain, one cannot stay long and should depart swiftly.

Mei Yaochen says: Land ruined by water is already difficult to traverse—how much more so for battle or defense?

He [Shi] says: *Ruined terrain* is land lacking solidity, unsuitable for building fortifications or digging moats. One should leave quickly.

King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “If I enter *ruined terrain*—mountains, rivers, perilous defiles, and difficult paths—marching for a long time, my troops exhausted, with the enemy before me and ambushes behind, their camps to my left and defenses to my right, their elite chariots and swift cavalry blocking my narrow passes—what should I do?”

Sun Wu replied: “First send light chariots ten *li* ahead to scout and engage the enemy at the perilous points. Some may turn left, others right. The commander surveys the four directions, chooses gaps to exploit, and converges on the main route, halting only when weary.”

Zhang Yu says: In perilous, marshy terrain, advancing and retreating are both difficult, with no place to rely on.

Where the route of entry is narrow and the path of return circuitous, and the enemy can use a small force to strike our larger one, this is called *encircled terrain*.

Li Quan says: Movement is difficult.

Du Mu says: Entry and exit are arduous, making it easy to set ambushes and achieve victory.

Du You says: The route of entry is treacherous, and the return path is distant. If delayed, provisions will run out. Thus, where the enemy can use a small force to strike our larger one, this is *encircled terrain*.

Mei Yaochen says: Surrounded by mountains and rivers, entry is narrow, and return is circuitous.

He [Shi] says: In *encircled terrain*, entry is through narrow defiles, and return is roundabout. With no freedom to advance or retreat, what use is a large force? Only through ingenious maneuvers can one traverse such terrain.

King Helü of Wu asked Sun Wu: “If I enter *encircled terrain*, with a strong enemy ahead and perilous obstacles behind, the enemy cutting off my supply lines and favoring my retreat, their drums sounding but their troops not advancing to test my resolve—what should I do?”

Sun Wu replied: “In *encircled terrain*, one must block the gaps to show there is nowhere to go. Treat the army as your home, uniting ten thousand hearts as one. The three armies should cook together for several days without showing smoke. Appear disorganized and weak. When the enemy sees this, they will surely underestimate your preparations. Then rally the officers and soldiers, rouse their fury, and array your best troops in ambush on the left and right. Sound the drums and charge. If the enemy resists, strike fiercely and break through. Advance to fight while the rear expands, and the flanks support from the sides.

“If the enemy is within our encirclement, lying in ambush with deep plans, luring us with advantages and entangling us with flags, appearing chaotic and directionless—what then?”

Sun Wu replied: “Have a thousand men hold banners, blocking the key routes. Send light troops to provoke the enemy, forming ranks but not engaging, clashing but not retreating. This is the method to defeat their schemes.”

Zhang Yu says: In terrain narrow ahead and perilous behind, where one man can hold off a thousand, victory comes through ambushes and surprise. Swift battle ensures survival; failure to fight swiftly leads to destruction—this is *deadly terrain*.

Cao Cao says: Ahead lie high mountains, behind great waters. Advance is impossible, and retreat is obstructed.

Li Quan says: Blocked by mountains, backed by water, with provisions exhausted—swift action is advantageous, delay is not.

Du Mu says: As Duke Wei Li Jing said: “Some armies, advancing without local guides, fall into peril and defeat, controlled by the enemy. To the left, valleys; to the right, mountains—paths so narrow that horses must be led and chariots suspended. Ahead, impassable; behind, cut off—cliffs where troops must march in single file like geese or fish. Before the battle lines are set, a strong enemy suddenly appears. There is no ground to advance upon, no position to retreat to. Seeking battle is impossible, and self-defense is untenable. If halted, time drags on; if moving, front and rear are vulnerable. The wilds lack water and grass, the army lacks supplies, horses are exhausted, and men are weary. Wisdom is exhausted, and strength is spent. One man guarding the pass can hold off ten thousand. If the enemy seizes such a critical point first, even with elite troops and sharp weapons, what use can they be?”

If in such a death ground, swift battle ensures survival; failure to fight swiftly leads to annihilation. One must unite the ranks in single purpose, combine qi and strength as one, spill guts and splatter blood, resolve to die at the forefront, turning defeat into victory and calamity into fortune. This is the way.

Chen Hao said: “Men in a death ground are like those sitting in a leaking boat or crouching beneath a burning roof.”
Jia Lin said: “With high mountains on both sides and impassable ravines ahead and behind, entry is easy but exit is difficult. If trapped in such a place, only a desperate battle brings life; if one waits until the soldiers’ morale is broken and supplies are exhausted before holding out, what awaits but death?”
Mei Yaochen said: “Unable to advance, retreat, or flee to the side, one has no choice but to fight swiftly.”
He Shi said: “In a death ground, fighting fiercely may bring survival; clinging to a corner means death.”

King Wu of Wu asked Sun Wu: “If my army marches beyond our borders and encamps in enemy territory, and the enemy arrives in great force, surrounding us in multiple layers, with no way to break out—every path blocked—how can I rouse my officers and inspire the ranks to risk their lives and shatter the encirclement?”
Sun Wu replied: “Dig deep moats and raise high ramparts to show preparedness for defense. Remain calm and still to conceal our strength. Proclaim to the three armies that we have no choice. Slaughter oxen and burn chariots to feast the troops. Burn all provisions, fill in wells and hearths, cut hair and discard caps to cast aside thoughts of survival. Let the general have no remaining schemes, and the soldiers embrace the resolve to die. Then sharpen armor and whet blades, unite qi and strength as one. Attack on both flanks, beat drums furiously, and raise a clamor—even the enemy will be alarmed, not knowing where to turn. Dispatch elite troops in separate columns to strike swiftly at their rear. This is seeking life by abandoning the Way.”
Thus it is said: “Besieged yet without strategy, one is doomed; doomed yet without battle, one perishes.”

King Wu asked: “If I am the one besieging the enemy, what then?”
Sun Wu replied: “When mountains are steep and valleys perilous, making escape impossible, they are called desperate bandits. The method to strike them: conceal troops in hidden shelters, open a path for their retreat, and show them an escape route. Desperate to survive, they will have no will to fight. Strike then, and even a large force will be broken.”
The Art of War also states: “If the enemy is in a death ground and their soldiers are fierce, the method to strike them is to yield rather than resist, secretly guard advantageous positions, and open a path for their retreat. Dispatch elite cavalry to block key routes, send light troops to provoke them, array forces but do not engage—this is the way to thwart their plans.”
Zhang Yu said: “When trapped by steep mountains and rivers, unable to advance or retreat, with supplies cut off within and the enemy pressing from without, one must rouse the troops to decisive battle—delay is not an option.”

Thus:
In dispersed ground, do not fight.
Li Quan said: “For fear of scattering.”
Du Mu said: “As explained above.”
Jia Lin said: “With no passes or gates, troops easily scatter. In such terrain, one cannot fight repeatedly. This is one school’s view on terrain. But if commands are strict and clear, and soldiers are devoted and obedient, they would not shrink even from death—how could they scatter?”
Mei Yaochen said: “When our troops are in their homeland, attached to life and land, formations are unstable, and combat is unwinnable—thus one cannot fight.”
Wang Xi said: “If forced to fight, they will fear scattering.”
Zhang Yu said: “With soldiers clinging to life, one cannot lightly engage in battle.”

King Wu asked Sun Wu: “If in dispersed ground one cannot fight, then one must hold fast and not sally forth. But if the enemy attacks our small cities, plunders our fields, blocks our firewood-gathering, and severs our vital roads, waiting until we are weakened before launching a fierce assault, what then?”
Sun Wu replied: “When the enemy has penetrated deeply, their resolve is to fight lightly. Our troops, attached to their homeland, form unstable lines and cannot prevail in battle. We must gather people and store grain, defend cities and fortify strongholds, and send light troops to cut off their supply lines. If they challenge us to battle and find no response, and their provisions fail to arrive, with nothing to plunder in the wilds, their three armies will be starved and exhausted. Then we can lure them into a trap and achieve success. If we wish to fight in the open, we must seize the opportunity, rely on natural barriers to set ambushes, or, lacking such advantages, conceal ourselves in darkness to strike unexpectedly at their moment of slackness.”

In light ground, do not halt.
Li Quan said: “For fear of flight.”
Du Mu said: “The so-called light ground in the Art of War refers to when an army first enters enemy territory, not yet having passed through perilous terrain. Soldiers long to return, finding advance difficult and retreat easy. As entering is hard, it is called light ground. One must select elite cavalry and set hidden ambushes. If the enemy suddenly arrives, strike without hesitation; if they do not come, cross swiftly and depart.”
Du You said: “With resolve not yet firm, one cannot engage the enemy.”
Mei Yaochen said: “When first entering enemy territory, not yet having passed through perilous terrain, soldiers’ hearts are not steadfast—there is no reason to fight. Do not approach famous cities or take main roads; swift advance is advantageous.”
Wang Xi said: “There is no reason to halt without cause.”
Zhang Yu said: “With soldiers eager to return, one cannot linger.”

King Wu asked: “If soldiers long to return, advance is difficult and retreat easy, and the army is not yet past perilous terrain, with the three armies fearful, what then?”
Sun Wu replied: “When the army is in light ground and soldiers are not yet steadfast, the priority is to advance, not to fight. Thus, do not approach famous cities or take main roads. Feign confusion and deception, as if preparing to withdraw. Then select elite cavalry, have them hold bits in their mouths to silence them, and lead the way in. Seize their livestock, and when the three armies see the gains, their fear will turn to eagerness. Divide our finest troops to set hidden ambushes. If the enemy comes, strike without hesitation; if they do not, abandon the position and depart.”

In contested ground, do not attack.
Cao Cao said: “Do not attack; the advantage lies in arriving first.”
Li Quan said: “If the enemy has already occupied perilous terrain, do not attack.”
Du Mu said: “Do not attack means that if the enemy has already seized the ground, one must not attack.”

Mei Yaochen said: “In terrain of strategic advantage, the first to occupy gains the benefit; if the enemy has already seized the position, do not attack.” Zhang Yu said: “One should not contend by attacking; rather, act later but arrive first.” The King of Wu asked: “If the enemy arrives first, occupies key positions to secure advantage, selects and trains troops, and alternates between offense and defense to prepare for our surprise attacks, what should be done?” Wu replied: “The method for contested ground is this: those who yield gain, while those who seek lose. If the enemy has taken the position, take care not to attack. Instead, feign retreat, raise banners and sound drums, rush toward what they cherish, burn brush and raise dust to confuse their senses. Divide our finest troops to set hidden ambushes, and the enemy will surely come to their aid. When others desire, I yield; when others abandon, I seize—this is the way to contend for the initiative. If we arrive first and the enemy employs this tactic, select our elite troops to firmly hold the position, send light cavalry in pursuit, and set ambushes in perilous terrain. When the enemy turns to fight, ambushes will rise from the flanks—this is the way to complete victory.”

In intersecting ground, do not sever connections.
Cao Cao said: “They are mutually connected and adjacent.”

Li Quan said: “One must not sever connections.”
Du Mu said: “In broad rivers and level terrain, where battles rage on all sides, chariots and cavalry must maintain formation, linking head to tail without break, lest the enemy exploit the gap.”
Jia Lin said: “One may forge alliances, but never cut them off—severance breeds enmity.”
Du You said: “They are mutually connected and adjacent. All may advance or retreat; one must not use force to break their bonds.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Where roads crisscross, fear interception; ensure units remain linked, never broken.”
Wang Xi said: “This refers to supply routes. Such intersecting terrain, also called ‘open ground,’ demands occupying high ground to await the enemy—one must not cut off the grain route.”
Zhang Yu said: “Where paths intersect freely, one must not block the enemy’s way with force; instead, secure victory through ambushes.”
King of Wu said: “In intersecting ground, I shall sever the enemy’s approach. First, order border cities to fortify defenses, block thoroughfares, and secure passes. If we fail to plan ahead, the enemy will prepare, allowing them to advance while we cannot, and with forces evenly matched—what then?”
Wu replied: “If we cannot go forth while they may come, divide troops to conceal them. Guard but feign weakness; when the enemy nears, set ambushes in hidden valleys to strike unexpectedly.”

In thoroughfare ground, unite in alliance.
Cao Cao said: “Form alliances with the feudal lords.”
Li Quan said: “Forge connections.”
Du Mu said: “The feudal lords are the neighboring states mentioned above.”
Meng said: “With alliances, safety; without them, peril.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Though the land lies open on all sides, how gain the world’s aid? Offer rich gifts to unite them.”
Wang Xi said: “In a land of four crossings, strength comes only through alliances.”
Zhang Yu said: “In such terrain, first secure ties with neighboring states.”
King of Wu said: “In thoroughfare ground, priority is paramount. If our path is long and we march late, even with swift chariots and galloping horses, we cannot arrive first—what then?”
Wu replied: “Where feudal lords converge and roads extend in all directions, with the enemy and us facing each other while other states lie nearby—what is called ‘priority’ demands heavy gifts and light envoys to negotiate peace with neighboring states, forging bonds of kinship and favor. Though our troops arrive later, the masses will already be ours. Train soldiers, fortify positions with strategic advantage, and with our allies’ support, the enemy loses their faction. With states attacking from all sides, none can withstand us.”

In heavy ground, plunder.
Cao Cao said: “Stockpile grain and provisions.”
Li Quan said: “Deep in enemy territory, one must not act unjustly and lose the people’s hearts. When Emperor Gao of Han entered Qin, he forbade harming women or seizing treasures, thus winning the people’s favor.” Quan took *plunder* to mean *not plundering*.
Du Mu said: “In heavy ground, with no advantage in advancing and no retreat possible, one must transport grain for a prolonged campaign to await the enemy.”
Meng said: “Draw provisions from the enemy.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Far from one’s state, with many cities at one’s back and supply routes severed, plunder to stockpile and sustain food.”
Wang Xi said: “Deep in enemy territory, raid fertile fields to enrich stores. In difficult terrain, scarcity of food brings danger.”
Zhang Yu said: “Deep in enemy lands, with no supply of provisions, rouse the troops to plunder for sustenance to prevent want.”
King of Wu said: “Heavy ground often lies beyond cities, with supply routes cut off. If we seek to return, the path may be impassable—what then?”
Wu replied: “In heavy ground, where soldiers are bold and transport is blocked, plunder to sustain food. Let those below obtain grain and silk, all to be offered to their superiors, with rewards for the abundant. If seeking to withdraw, dig deep moats and raise high ramparts to signal a prolonged stay. The enemy, suspecting open routes, will secretly clear key points. Then order light chariots to march in silence, raising dust and scattering cattle and horses as bait. If the enemy emerges, sound drums to pursue, while hidden troops lie in wait, coordinating inside and out—their defeat is assured.”

In broken ground, march.
Cao Cao said: “Do not linger.”
Li Quan said: “Do not dig trenches; hasten away.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Where the land is ruined and uninhabitable, move swiftly without delay.”
Wang Xi said: “Gather the army; broken ground is no place to halt.”
Zhang Yu said: “In treacherous terrain, do not tarry.”
King of Wu said: “Where mountains and rivers are perilous and paths arduous, prolonged marching exhausts the troops. If the enemy lies ahead and ambushes behind, camps to the left and guards to the right, with elite chariots and swift cavalry blocking narrow passes—what then?”
Wu replied: “First send light chariots ten *li* ahead to scout and await the enemy, timing their arrival at perilous points. Some may turn left, others right; the commander surveys all, choosing gaps to seize, converging midway before resting.”

In encircled ground, devise strategy.
Cao Cao said: “Deploy ingenious plans.”
Li Quan said: “The wise are never trapped.”
Du Mu said: “In treacherous terrain, locked in stalemate with the enemy, employ cunning and deceptive tactics.”
Du You said: “Here, one must rely on crafty schemes to escape peril.”
Mei Yaochen said: “With narrow fronts, perilous rears, and circuitous return routes, devise strategies to prevail.”
Zhang Yu said: “Hard to conquer by force, easy to seize by stratagem.”
King of Wu said: “With a strong enemy ahead and peril behind, the enemy cuts off our supply routes, forcing retreat. They beat drums but do not advance, testing our resolve—what then?”
Wu replied: “In encircled ground, block all gaps to signal no escape, making the army one’s home. With ten thousand united in heart and the three armies in concert, cook for days without showing smoke, feigning disorder and weakness.”

When the enemy sees us and prepares lightly, rally and inspire the troops, rouse their fury, array disciplined warriors, flank them with perilous terrain, and charge forth with drumbeats. If the enemy stands firm, strike swiftly and break through—press forward in combat while securing the rear, and flank them from both sides. In death ground, fight.

Cao Cao said: “This is fighting in death ground.”
Li Quan said: “A fight to the death, with no thought of survival.”
Chen Hao said: “Trapped in death ground, every soldier fights for himself. Thus it is said: ‘Place them in death ground, and they will live.’”
Jia Lin said: “Fight with all one’s might, and one may survive; cling to a corner, and one will die.”
Mei Yaochen said: “With no escape before, behind, left, or right, show them they must die, and every man will fight for himself.”
Zhang Yu said: “Trapped in death ground, men fight of their own accord.”

The King of Wu said: “If a vast enemy force surrounds us in multiple layers, and we seek to break out but find all paths blocked, how can we rouse the troops to fight with their lives?”
Wu replied: “Dig deep trenches and raise high ramparts; remain still and do not move. Proclaim to the three armies that there is no choice but to fight. Slaughter oxen and burn wagons to feast the soldiers. Burn all provisions and fill in wells and hearths. Cut your hair and cast aside your cap, abandon all thought of survival, sharpen armor and blades, and unite in spirit and strength. Attack on both flanks, beat drums furiously, and raise a clamor—let the enemy tremble, unsure where to turn. Dispatch elite troops in separate columns to strike swiftly at their rear. This is how one loses the Way yet seeks life.”

Thus it is said: “Besieged and without strategy, one is doomed; doomed and unwilling to fight, one perishes.” The ancients skilled in warfare could ensure the enemy’s front and rear could not support each other.

Mei Yaochen said: “Through sudden assaults and ambushes.”
Their many and few could not rely on one another.

Mei Yaochen said: “Through shock and disruption.”
Their noble and base could not rescue each other.

Mei Yaochen said: “Through scattering and chaos.”
Their superiors and subordinates could not regroup.

Mei Yaochen said: “Through panic and haste.”
Soldiers scattered and could not reassemble; troops gathered but could not unite.

Li Quan said: “Deploy deceptions to confuse them—strike their right when they rush to save their left, leaving them too flustered to plan.”
Du Mu said: “Employ manifold deceptions to throw the enemy into disarray. Charge their front while ambushing their rear, feign an attack to the east while striking west, create false formations, and display unexpected maneuvers. We engage without fixed form, while the enemy must prepare on all sides, their forces divided.”
Meng Shi said: “Create numerous distractions—appear in the east while striking the west, attack the south to draw them north, leaving them bewildered and scattered, unable to concentrate.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Some may scatter and fail to regroup; others may gather but fail to unite.”
Wang Xi said: “This arises from the disparity between commanders. The key lies in the interplay of the orthodox and the unexpected, like limbs responding in unison.”
Zhang Yu said: “Strike where they least expect, exploit their unpreparedness, and charge with elite troops in a sudden, shattering assault. When they rush to save their front, their rear is exposed; when they respond to the left, their right is vulnerable. Leave them flustered and disordered, unsure where to defend. Officers and soldiers cannot reinforce one another; their troops scatter and cannot reassemble, or gather but cannot unite.”

Act when it is advantageous; cease when it is not.

Cao Cao said: “Provoke them to scatter, disrupt them to prevent unity, then move to engage.”
Li Quan said: “Agitate them until they see an opening, then act; if they remain unshaken, hold back.”
Mei Yaochen said: “To bring the enemy to such a state, one must act only when advantageous, and cease when it is not.”
Zhang Yu said: “Even if they are startled, act only when advantageous, and cease when it is not.”

May I ask: If the enemy arrives in great numbers and strict order, how should we await them?

Cao Cao said: “This is a hypothetical question.”
Mei Yaochen said: “This is a self-posed query. If the enemy is numerous and well-disciplined, how should we face them?”
Zhang Yu said: “The previous discussions assume forces of comparable size. Thus, someone asks Wu: ‘If the enemy outnumbers us and is well-ordered, how should we confront them?’”

Wu replied: “First seize what they cherish, and they will comply.”
Cao Cao said: “Take away what they rely upon. If we first occupy advantageous ground, we will surely obtain what we desire.”
Li Quan said: “Sunzi posed this question to reveal a secret principle. ‘What they cherish’ refers to what benefits the enemy—whether wealth, women, or children. If we first harass and humiliate them, the enemy’s advance and retreat will be at our command.”
Du Mu said: “Secure our advantageous positions, raid their fields, and cut off their supply routes—these are what the enemy cherishes and depends upon. If we seize them all, even a strong enemy’s movements, victories, and defeats will be subject to our will.”
Chen Hao said: “What they cherish is not limited to what they rely upon; anything the enemy values can be seized.”
Mei Yaochen said: “First take what they hold dear, so our will prevails, then throw them into shock and disarray, leaving them with no recourse.”
Wang Xi said: “First occupy advantageous ground, use unexpected forces to sever their supply lines, and they will follow our plans.”
Zhang Yu said: “What the enemy cherishes is advantageous ground and provisions. If we seize them first, they will follow our designs without exception.”

The essence of warfare lies in speed—exploit the enemy’s unpreparedness, advance by unexpected routes, and strike where they are unguarded.

Cao Cao said: “Sunzi responds to the question by reiterating the nature of warfare.”
Li Quan said: “Strike where they are unprepared and unguarded—this is the swiftness of breaking the enemy.”
Du Mu said: “This summarizes the nature of warfare, seizing the enemy’s vulnerabilities. Advance by unexpected routes and strike where they are unguarded—this is the profound essence of warfare and the supreme task of a commander.”

Chen Hao said: “This speaks of seizing the enemy’s unpreparedness, unforeseen vulnerabilities, and unguarded moments—one must advance swiftly without hesitation. For Sunzi’s essential teaching is that the use of arms values speed above all.”

Mei Yaochen said: “The mechanism of warfare prizes speed; one must strike where the enemy is unprepared. To strike where they are unprepared is to advance by unexpected routes and attack where they are unguarded.”

Wang Xi said: “In warfare, supreme swiftness is paramount—seizing what the enemy cherishes is only natural.”

He Shi said: “Consider the case of Meng Da, a Shu general who defected to Wei. The Wei court appointed him Governor of Xincheng. Later, Meng Da secretly allied with Wu to reinforce Shu, plotting against the Central States. When his scheme was exposed, Sima Xuanwang, then in power, feared Meng Da would act swiftly. He sent a letter to reassure him, but Meng Da remained indecisive upon receiving it. Xuanwang then advanced his troops in secret. His generals urged caution, saying Meng Da was colluding with two enemies and that they should investigate before acting. Xuanwang replied: ‘Meng Da is treacherous and untrustworthy—this is the moment of his hesitation. We must strike before he regains resolve.’ He doubled the pace of his march and reached Meng Da’s city in eight days. Wu and Shu each dispatched their generals to Xicheng, constructing barricades at Anqiao and Mulanse to relieve Meng Da, but Xuanwang divided his forces to block them. Earlier, Meng Da had written to Zhuge Liang: ‘Wan is eight hundred *li* from Luoyang and one thousand one hundred *li* from me. If they learn of my uprising, they will petition the Son of Heaven, and by the time their orders reverse course, a month will have passed—my city will be fortified, and my troops fully prepared. The terrain is treacherous; Sima will not come himself, and if his generals do, I will have nothing to fear.’ When the army arrived, Meng Da wrote again to Zhuge Liang: ‘I rose in revolt eight days ago, and now their troops are at my gates—how could they be so swift?’ Shangyong City was protected on three sides by water, and Meng Da built wooden palisades at its base to fortify it. Xuanwang crossed the water, breached the palisades, and advanced directly to the city walls, attacking from eight directions. After sixteen days, Meng Da’s nephew Deng Xian and his general Li Fu opened the gates and surrendered, and Meng Da was executed.

When Li Jing campaigned against Xiao Xian, he assembled his troops at Kuizhou. Xiao Xian, believing the autumn floods had swollen the rivers and submerged the paths through the Three Gorges, assumed Li Jing could not advance and thus relaxed his defenses. In the ninth month, Li Jing led his army forward. As they prepared to descend the gorges, his generals urged him to halt and wait for the waters to recede. Li Jing said: ‘Warfare values divine speed; opportunity must not be lost. Our troops have just assembled, and Xiao Xian remains unaware. If we exploit the rising waters to appear suddenly at his gates, it will be like thunder too swift to cover one’s ears—this is the supreme strategy of warfare. Even if he learns of us, he will be unable to muster troops in time, and we will surely capture him.’ Thus, Xiao Xian was subdued.

The *Art of War of Duke Wei* states: ‘In warfare, employ the divine and prize speed. Train and refine your soldiers, clarify commands, instruct their eyes with banners and flags, accustom their ears to drums and bells, enforce strict rewards and punishments to discipline them, provide ample provisions to sustain them, deepen moats and trenches to defend them, point out mountains and rivers to guide them, appoint the capable to lead them, and teach them the interplay of orthodox and unorthodox tactics. Thus, even if the enemy strikes with the swiftness of lightning, we will be prepared. If troops lack prior preparation, they will not respond in time; if they fail to respond, they will miss the opportunity; if they miss the opportunity, they will lag behind events; if they lag, they will fail to secure victory, and the army will be destroyed.’ Thus, the *Lüshi Chunqiu* says: ‘In warfare, one must act swiftly to achieve a decisive victory; it cannot be prolonged.’ Therefore, it is said: ‘The essence of warfare lies in speed, exploiting the enemy’s unpreparedness.’

Yet if the enemy’s commander is cunning, his troops harmonious, his orders obeyed without question, his weapons sharp, his armor sturdy, his *qi* keen and disciplined, and his strength full and vigorous—how can one swiftly engage him? The answer: In such cases, one must conceal one’s tracks and silence one’s movements, accumulate strength while awaiting the enemy’s exhaustion, evade his momentum, and wear him down over time—how could one recklessly attack? This is why Lian Po resisted Bai Qi by holding his ground without fighting, and why Xuanwang opposed Wu Hou by restraining his advance.

Zhang Yu said: “Again, addressing another: The principle of warfare values divine speed. What is prized in speed is seizing the enemy’s moment of panic, leaving him no time to prepare. Advance by unexpected routes to strike where he is unguarded, so that he is thrown into confusion, his forces scattered, his front and rear unable to coordinate, and his many and few unable to support one another.

The way of the invader: When deeply entrenched, his resolve is single-minded, and the defender cannot overcome him.”

Li Quan said: “As an invader, the deeper one penetrates, the firmer one’s resolve, and the defender cannot resist.”

Du Mu said: “Generally, in the way of attack, if one deeply enters enemy territory, the soldiers will be determined to fight to the death, their minds unified, and the defender will be unable to prevail.”

Mei Yaochen said: “As an invader, the deeper one enters enemy land, the more the soldiers concentrate their resolve, and the defender cannot overcome them.”

Zhang Yu said: “When deeply penetrating enemy territory, the soldiers’ minds are single-minded, and the defender cannot prevail. This is because the invader is in a position of grave importance, while the defender is in a position of ease. This is why Zhao’s Guang Wujun told Han Xin: ‘When you fight far from your state, your momentum is irresistible.’”

“Plunder fertile fields so the Three Armies have ample provisions.”

Wang Xi said: “Fertile fields yield abundant crops.”

“Carefully sustain them without exhausting them; consolidate their *qi* and accumulate their strength. Devise strategies that are unfathomable.”

Cao Cao said: “Nurture the soldiers, consolidate their *qi*, and devise strategies that cannot be predicted.”

Li Quan said: “With *qi* abundant and strength accumulated, combined with strategic planning, the enemy will be unable to fathom one’s intentions.”

Du Mu said: “This means that when deeply entering enemy territory, one must plunder the fields to ensure ample provisions, then rest the troops behind fortifications without wearing them out.”

With *qi* complete and strength abundant, strike once to secure victory. Act with adaptability and transformation, so the enemy cannot fathom my intentions.

Chen Hao said: “The terrain where one encamps must have nearby water and grass, with ample supplies and no shortages. Carefully regulate movements and well tend to the soldiers.”

When Wang Jian campaigned against Chu, the Chu forces challenged him to battle, but he refused to engage. He diligently nurtured and guided his troops, consolidating their strength as one. Hearing that his soldiers tossed stones in play, he knew they had been nurtured in courage and longed for battle—only then did he deploy them, and in a single stroke, he destroyed Chu.

Yet when deeply entering enemy territory without seeing an opportunity for victory, one must employ this strategy.

Mei Yaochen said: “Plunder their fertile lands to ensure ample provisions for the army. Rest the soldiers’ strength and consolidate their forces to devise unfathomable plans.”

Wang Xi said: “‘Carefully sustain’ means to meticulously tend to their food and drink. Consolidate their sharp *qi*, accumulate surplus strength, conceal one’s form, and keep strategies secret, so the enemy cannot predict them. Wait for an exploitable opening, then advance.”

Zhang Yu said: “When the army is in perilous terrain, one must plunder grain from fertile fields to enrich one’s provisions. Then fortify defenses, diligently tend to the soldiers, and not allow them to suffer hardship. Thus, their *qi* will be abundant and strength complete, and one may constantly devise unfathomable strategies. When the enemy presents an opportunity to strike, seize it in a single decisive move. Wang Jian’s campaign against Jing frequently employed this tactic.”

Placed where there is no retreat, they will fight to the death without fleeing.

Li Quan said: “When their strength is secured, place them where there is no escape.”

Du Mu said: “‘Placed where there is no retreat’ means that whether advancing or retreating, there is nowhere to go. Thus, the soldiers will strive to fight with all their might, and even in death, they will not flee.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Set them in a position where they must fight, knowing they will die rather than retreat.”

Zhang Yu said: “Placed in perilous terrain, with no escape in any direction, they will defend and fight to the death rather than flee.”

If death is certain, how can victory not be won?

Cao Cao said: “If the soldiers are resolved to die, how can victory not be assured?”

Du Mu said: “When soldiers are determined to die, how can there be no chance of victory?”

Meng Shi said: “If the soldiers are resolved to die, there is nothing they cannot achieve.”

Mei Yaochen said: “How can the troops fail to obey commands?”

Zhang Yu said: “If the soldiers fight to the death, how can their aims not be realized?”

The *Wei Liaozi* states: “If a lone bandit wields a sword and strikes in the marketplace, ten thousand will flee from him—not because he alone is brave, nor because the ten thousand are all cowardly, but because the resolve to die and the will to live are not equal. Thus, the soldiers will exert all their strength.”

Cao Cao said: “In dire terrain, their hearts unite.”

Mei Yaochen said: “How can the soldiers not exhaust all their strength to join the battle?”

Wang Xi said: “When men are placed in a position of certain death, how can they not give their all?”

He Shi said: “Even beasts, when cornered, will fight, and birds, when desperate, will peck. How much more so for humans, the most intelligent of creatures?”

Zhang Yu said: “When all are in dire straits together, how can they not unite in giving their utmost?”

When soldiers are deeply entrapped, they feel no fear.

Du Mu said: “Trapped in peril, they know they cannot die alone, and the entire army shares one heart—thus, they feel no fear.”

Mei Yaochen echoed Du Mu’s annotation.

Wang Xi said: “Placed in dire terrain, they feel no fear; without fear, their fighting spirit is unyielding.”

Zhang Yu said: “Trapped in a position of imminent destruction, men hold fast to the resolve to die—how could they still fear the enemy?”

With no escape, they stand firm; deeply entrenched, they are constrained.

Cao Cao said: “Constrained, as if bound.”

Li Quan said: “Firm, as in resolute.”

Du Mu said: “‘Escape’ means to flee. When deeply entering enemy territory with no path to survival, the soldiers’ hearts become as steadfast as if bound.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Placed where there is no escape, their hearts naturally stand firm; deeply entrenched, their resolve naturally becomes single-minded.”

Zhang Yu said: “With no direction to flee, their hearts stand firm. When the army is in perilous terrain with nowhere to turn, they are as if bound.”

When there is no alternative, they will fight.

Cao Cao said: “When men are desperate, they will fight to the death.”

Li Quan said: “Resolved to their fate.”

Du Mu said: “‘No alternative’ means they suspect they are trapped in a position of certain death and will not survive. Using death to avert death, utterly without recourse, they will all fight with everything they have.”

Mei Yaochen and He Shi echoed Du Mu’s annotation.

Zhang Yu said: “When circumstances leave no choice, they must fight with all their might.”

Thus, their troops require no discipline to remain vigilant, no demands to yield results, no pacts to foster closeness, no commands to inspire trust.

Cao Cao said: “Without seeking, their intent is naturally fulfilled.”

Li Quan said: “Placed in a position of certain death, they will obey without command.”

Du Mu said: “This means that when the army is in a position of certain death, superiors and subordinates share a single purpose. They do not need to be disciplined to remain vigilant, nor do they need to be gathered to align their hearts. Without pacts or commands, they naturally become close and trustworthy.”

Meng Shi said: “Without seeking victory, victory is naturally attained.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Without discipline, the troops remain vigilant on their own; without seeking, their sentiments are naturally fulfilled; without pacts, the masses naturally become close; without commands, the people naturally trust. All this arises from being placed in peril, so the entire army shares one heart.”

Wang Xi said: “This refers to the natural state of men’s hearts in a position of certain death.”

Zhang Yu said: “In perilous terrain, men naturally unite in strength. Without discipline, they remain vigilant on their own; without seeking, they attain mutual understanding; without restraints, they become close to their superiors; without commands, they trust in their orders. This is what is meant by ‘crossing a river in the same boat—how could the Hu and Yue fear discord?’”

Banish omens and dispel doubts, so that even unto death, there is nowhere to turn.

Cao Cao said: “Banish talk of inauspicious omens and dispel doubtful strategies.” (An alternate version reads: “Even unto death, there is no disaster.”)

Li Quan said: “Banish talk of omens and doubtful matters, so there will be no disaster.”

Du Mu said: “The *Huangshi Gong* states: ‘Banish shamans and diviners; do not allow scribes or soldiers to inquire about the army’s fortunes, lest they disturb the soldiers’ hearts.’”

Once the path of doubt and confusion is barred, soldiers will hold fast to their resolve even unto death.

Mei Yaochen said: “When omens and portents do not arise, and doubtful words do not enter, the army will not falter—fighting on until death.”

Wang Xi said: “Disasters, omens, and divine anomalies can bewilder men, so they must be forbidden.”

Zhang Yu said: “To ensure soldiers fight to the death, military officers must be forbidden from speaking of omens, lest they unsettle the ranks. By removing doubtful strategies, soldiers will hold no other thoughts even unto death. As the *Methods of Sima* states: ‘Eliminate baleful omens.’ This is what it means.

If soldiers lack unwavering resolve, one may even employ omens to rally them—as Tian Dan did when defending Jimo. He ordered a soldier to pose as a spirit, and in every command, invoked the spirit’s name, ultimately breaking the Yan forces.

My soldiers possess no surplus wealth—not because they despise riches; they hold no thought for survival—not because they scorn long life.

Cao Cao said: “All wealth is burned and destroyed—not because they hate riches, but because abandoning possessions to embrace death is unavoidable.”

Du Mu said: “If soldiers cling to wealth, they may hesitate and seek survival, lacking the resolve to die.”

Mei Yaochen said: “They exhaust their wealth and fight to the death—not by choice, but by necessity.”

Wang Xi said: “Enough is sufficient; if soldiers covet riches, they will cling to life. They must fight to the death; if they seek survival, they will lack the will to die.”

Zhang Yu said: “Wealth and life are what men cherish. To cast away treasures and sacrifice their lives is not out of hatred, but necessity.”

When the command is given, seated soldiers weep until their collars are soaked, and those lying down let tears stream down their cheeks.

Cao Cao said: “All hold to a resolve of certain death.”

Li Quan said: “Abandoning wealth and life, they embrace a will to die—hence the tears.”

Du Mu said: “Soldiers pledge themselves to death. Before battle, they are told: ‘Today’s affair hinges on this single strike. If you disobey, your bodies will rot in the wild, devoured by beasts.’”

Mei Yaochen said: “Resolved to fight to the death, as Du Mu describes.”

Wang Xi said: “Moved and inspired, they weep.”

Zhang Yu said: “Stirred to emotion, they shed tears.”

Before battle, they are told: “Today’s affair hinges on this single strike. If you disobey, your bodies will rot in the wild, devoured by beasts.”

Some say: “When marching, feast the soldiers with wine, draw swords and dance, engage in wrestling matches, beat drums, and raise battle cries to bolster their spirit. Would weeping not dampen their fighting resolve?”

The answer: “First secure their resolve to die, then rouse their spirit—thus, victory is assured. Without the will to die, even with high morale, how can they prevail? When Jing Ke stood by the Yi River, his men wept; yet when he struck up a defiant tune, their eyes blazed, and their hair bristled beneath their caps.”

Cast them into a place with no retreat, and they will fight with the courage of Zhuan Zhu and Cao Mo.

Li Quan said: “When beasts are cornered, they claw; when birds are trapped, they peck. Under dire urgency, men display the bravery of Zhuan Zhu and Cao Gui.”

Du Mu said: “Wherever they are sent, they will fight with the courage of Zhuan Zhu and Cao Gui.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Once ordered to certain death, they will charge with the bravery of Zhuan Zhu and Cao Mo.”

Zhang Yu said: “With death in their hearts, they will advance with the courage of Zhuan Zhu and Cao Gui.”

Zhuan Zhu was the assassin sent by Prince Guang of Wu to kill King Liao of Wu. *Gui* should read *Mo*—Cao Mo served Duke Zhuang of Lu with his bravery, once seizing a dagger to coerce Duke Huan of Qi.

Thus, one skilled in warfare is like *shuairan*.

Mei Yaochen said: “The ease of mutual response.”

*Shuairan* is the snake of Mount Chang. Strike its head, and its tail comes; strike its tail, and its head comes; strike its middle, and both head and tail come.

Mei Yaochen said: “The nature of the snake is such that it cannot be struck—if attacked, it responds swiftly.”

Zhang Yu said: “*Shuai* means swift; when struck, it reacts instantly. This illustrates the principles of battle formations. The *Eight Formations Diagram* states: ‘The rear becomes the front, the front becomes the rear; four heads, eight tails—wherever touched, it becomes the head. If the enemy strikes the center, both head and tail rush to the rescue.’”

One asks: Can troops be made to move like *shuairan*?

Mei Yaochen said: “Can troops be made to respond as one, like a single body?”

The answer: Yes. The people of Wu and Yue despise each other, yet when crossing a river in the same boat and caught in a storm, they rescue one another like left and right hands.

Mei Yaochen said: “Circumstances compel them.”

Zhang Yu said: “Wu and Yue are bitter enemies, yet in shared peril, they aid each other like two hands. How much more so for those who are not enemies—will they not respond like *shuairan*?”

Thus, tying horses in formation and burying wheels are not sufficient to rely upon.

Cao Cao said: “*Fang* means to bind horses. Burying wheels signals immobility. This speaks of inflexibility being inferior to adaptability. Thus, even with horses bound and wheels buried, it is not enough to rely upon.”

Li Quan said: “Cast troops into a place with no retreat, and they will fight on their own, like the head and tail of a snake. Thus, the people of Wu and Yue, though enemies, rescue each other in the same boat—even with horses bound and wheels buried, it is not enough to rely upon.”

Du Mu said: “Binding horses into a square formation and burying wheels to prevent movement—even so, this is not sufficient to be called steadfast or reliable. One must employ adaptability, place soldiers in a situation of certain death, and let them fight for themselves. When they aid each other like two hands, this is the way to secure victory.”

Chen Hao said: “No enmity is greater than that between Wu and Yue, yet when sharing a boat in a storm, they still rescue each other.”

Why is this so? The circumstances compel it. In the Dao of employing troops, if they are placed in a position where battle is inevitable and share the fear of certain death, then head and tail, front and rear, cannot but rescue one another. Even with the enmity of Wu and Yue, they still aid each other like two hands—how much more so when no such enmity exists? This speaks to the value of creating change to unify them, for then the hearts of the brave and the timid become as one.

Mei Yaochen concurs with Du Mu’s annotation. Wang Xi said: “This refers to mutual rescue in dire straits. The head and tail of a snake, the left and right hands of a man—both illustrate the swiftness of mutual aid. Crossing a river in the same boat is a perilous situation; even Wu and Yue harbor no differing intentions, so how much more so for an entire army? Thus, this is far more reliable than binding horses and burying wheels.” Cao Cao’s explanation is correct.

Zhang Yu said: “The preceding text repeatedly speaks of placing troops in a desperate situation to focus their resolve. Yet this alone is not sufficient. Even when placed in peril, one must employ adaptability and ingenuity, causing them to aid one another like left and right hands—only then can victory be secured. Thus, while binding horses and burying wheels may not be relied upon for steadfastness or victory, what can truly be depended upon is ensuring that soldiers respond as one body. When courage is unified as one, this is the Dao of governance.”

Li Quan said: “Unifying courage is the general’s Dao.”
Du Mu said: “When courage and rectitude are aligned, the entire army acts as one—this all depends on governance.”
Chen Hao said: “When commands are strict and clear, the brave cannot advance alone, nor the timid retreat alone; the entire army moves as one.”
Mei Yaochen said: “To make men’s courage unified as one heart without fear is to master the Dao of military governance.”
Wang Xi concurs with Mei Yaochen’s annotation.
Zhang Yu said: “Having placed them in peril and ensured mutual rescue, the entire army’s strength and courage become as one man—this is the Dao of military governance rightly attained.”

When both firmness and flexibility are achieved, this is the principle of terrain.
Cao Cao said: “Strength and weakness become one in circumstance.”
Li Quan said: “Achieving firmness and flexibility depends on the terrain’s advantage.”
Du Mu said: “The dynamics of strength and weakness must be shaped by the land’s configuration.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Whether troops are strong or weak, all can be employed effectively—this is the advantage of terrain.”
Wang Xi said: “Firmness and flexibility are like strength and weakness. When soldiers of an army, strong and weak alike, are all utilized effectively, it is the terrain’s advantage that makes this so.” Cao Cao’s statement that “strength and weakness become one in circumstance” is correct.
Zhang Yu said: “With the advantage of terrain, even weak troops can overcome the enemy—how much more so with strong ones? When both firmness and flexibility are fully employed, it is the terrain’s advantage that makes this possible.”

Thus, one skilled in employing troops guides them as if leading a single man—this is necessity.
Cao Cao said: “Unity in appearance.”
Li Quan said: “Governing the many as one governs the few.”
Du Mu said: “This means making the entire army’s soldiers like one man led by the hand, compelled to follow commands without choice—an easy comparison.”
Jia Lin said: “‘Guiding by the hand’ describes a fluid, shifting formation, allowing seamless transitions: front becomes rear, rear becomes front, left becomes right, right becomes left. Thus, even a million troops move as one.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Employing the entire army as if guiding a single man by the hand is a matter of necessity, for they naturally follow every command.”
Wang Xi said: “Guiding them left and right, front and rear, they all follow.”
Zhang Yu said: “Though the army is vast, it is like leading a single man by the hand—this speaks to unity.”

Thus it is said: Where the general points, none fail to advance to their deaths.
The general’s affairs: stillness with depth, rectitude with order.
Cao Cao said: “This means clarity, stillness, depth, and impartiality.”
Du Mu said: “Clear, still, and simple; deep and unfathomable; impartial and unbiased—thus governance is achieved.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Still and profound, beyond human comprehension; upright and self-governed, beyond human disruption.”
Wang Xi said: “Stillness prevents disturbance, depth prevents predictability, rectitude prevents negligence, order prevents chaos.”
Zhang Yu said: “In planning, he is calm and profound, unfathomable to others; in command, he is just and disciplined, leaving no room for disrespect.”

He can dull the ears and eyes of his soldiers, leaving them ignorant.
Cao Cao said: “To dull is to deceive. The people may share in the joy of success, but they cannot partake in the planning of beginnings.”
Li Quan said: “When plans are not yet mature, soldiers should not be made aware. They may share in the joy of success, but not in the deliberation of beginnings. Thus, their ears and eyes are first dulled, leaving them without knowledge.”
Du Mu said: “This means that apart from the general’s commands, soldiers know nothing else, as if deaf and blind.”
Mei Yaochen said: “All military strategies are to be carried out without being understood.”
Wang Xi said: “Obscure their perceptions.”
He [the commentator] concurs with Du Mu’s annotation.
Zhang Yu said: “Soldiers remain ignorant, following orders without question.”

He alters his actions and changes his plans, leaving no one the wiser.
Li Quan said: “Plans may shift, leaving no trace of their origin.”
Du Mu said: “In the execution of affairs and the formulation of plans, he does not let others discern the intent behind them or recognize their underlying purpose.”
Mei Yaochen said: “He changes what has been done and alters what has been planned, leaving no one able to comprehend.”
Wang Xi said: “Once actions are taken and plans are executed, they must be altered and cannot be repeated.”
He [the commentator] said: “The art of generalship lies in endless adaptability.”
Zhang Yu said: “All previously undertaken actions and formerly devised plans are changed, leaving no one able to discern them.”

If Pei Xingjian ordered his troops to pitch camp and then suddenly commanded them to relocate to a higher ridge, at first the officers and soldiers would be displeased. That night, a violent storm arose, and the original campsite was submerged under over ten feet of water. The officers and soldiers were astonished and came to admire his foresight. They asked, “How did you know the storm was coming?” Xingjian smiled and replied, “From now on, simply follow my commands—why ask how I knew?”

He alters their position and diverts their path, leaving no one able to anticipate his intent.
Li Quan said: “The convenience of the route remains unknown to all.”
Du Mu said: “To alter their position is to move from safety to danger; to divert their path is to abandon the near for the far, instilling in the soldiers a resolve to fight to the death.”
Chen Hao said: “In every action a general undertakes, he must execute it with meticulous care, allowing no one to discern his calculations.”
Jia Lin said: “If our position is advantageous, he compels us to move; if the path is near, he forces us to take a detour. The trigger is pulled so subtly that no one perceives it.”
Mei Yaochen said: “He changes their secure position and diverts their intended path, leaving no one able to anticipate his plans.”
Wang Xi said: “To occupy an exposed position is to lure the enemy into battle; to take a circuitous route is to feign distance while launching a covert attack.”
Zhang Yu said: “He abandons the perilous for the accessible in positioning, and forsakes the near for the distant in routing—no one grasps his intent until victory proves his wisdom.”

The Supreme White Mountain Recluse said: “The art of war prizes deception—not only deceiving the enemy but also deceiving one’s own soldiers, guiding them without revealing the purpose.”

The commander sets a goal for them as if ascending a height and removing the ladder.
Mei Yaochen said: “They can advance but cannot retreat.”
The commander leads them deep into the enemy’s territory and springs the mechanism.
Du Mu said: “This eliminates any thought of retreat—like Meng Ming burning the boats.”
One version reads: *The commander leads them to ascend a height.*
Chen Hao said: “He triggers their resolve.”
Jia Lin said: “He deploys his strategic flexibility, adapting to circumstances as they arise.”
Mei Yaochen said: “He releases the perilous mechanism, compelling them to fight with all their might.”
Wang Xi said: “All these measures steel their determination for decisive battle.”
Once the mechanism is sprung, there is no turning back.
Jia Lin urged Cao Cao, saying, “You must decisively pull the trigger.”
Zhang Yu said: “Removing the ladder allows advance but not retreat; springing the mechanism permits forward movement but no return—like Xiang Yu crossing the river and scuttling the boats.”

Burn the boats and smash the cauldrons, then drive the troops like a flock of sheep—herded forth, herded back, none knowing where they go.
Cao Cao said: “Unite their hearts.”
Li Quan said: “When returning, they burn the boats and bridges, steeling their resolve. Deprived of strategy and without thought of retreat, they are like sheep driven forward.”
Du Mu said: “The army knows only the commands to advance or withdraw, not the purpose of the attack.”
Mei Yaochen said: “They follow obediently, unaware of anything else.”
He Shi said: “The soldiers’ movements depend solely on the general’s orders, like sheep following the shepherd.”
Zhang Yu said: “Sheep come and go at the shepherd’s will; the army advances and retreats at the general’s command.”

Gather the army’s forces and cast them into peril—this is the general’s duty.
Cao Cao said: “Peril means difficulty.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Placing the army in danger to secure victory is the general’s essential task.”
Zhang Yu said: “Removing the ladder and springing the mechanism, placing troops in peril to achieve victory—this is the general’s responsibility.”

The variations of the nine terrains, the advantages of contraction and expansion, and the principles of human nature must be thoroughly examined.
Cao Cao said: “Human nature advances when it sees advantage and retreats when it sees harm.”
Du Mu said: “The benefits and harms of contraction and expansion, the constant principles of human nature—all change according to the nine terrains. Here, the text reintroduces the nine terrains to set the stage for what follows.”
Mei Yaochen said: “The variations of the nine terrains offer opportunities for contraction or expansion; the constant principles of human nature must be carefully observed.”
Wang Xi said: “One must fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the nine terrains and their transformations. Contraction occurs when no opportunity is seen; expansion follows when an advantage appears. The principles of human nature refer to deep commitment, shallow dispersion, and encirclement.”
Zhang Yu said: “The methods of the nine terrains cannot be rigidly applied; one must recognize adaptability. Contract when appropriate, expand when advantageous—discern what is beneficial. This is the constant principle of human nature and must not be overlooked.”

The way of the invader: the deeper the penetration, the greater the unity; the shallower, the more dispersed.
Mei Yaochen said: “Deep penetration fosters solid unity; shallow entry leads to dispersion.”
From this point onward, the text revisits the nine terrains, for Sunzi emphasizes their variations repeatedly.
Zhang Yu said: “The first to deploy is the invader. Deep penetration ensures unity; shallow entry causes the troops to scatter.”
Below, the variations of the nine terrains are discussed.

An army that leaves its own state and crosses borders operates in *jue* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “Neither light nor dispersed, it lies between the two.”
Wang Xi said: “This refers to crossing the borders of neighboring states, entering isolated terrain where swift resolution is essential—like the King of Wu’s campaign against Qi. Such cases are rare and thus not categorized among the nine terrains.”
Zhang Yu said: “An army that departs its own state and invades another’s territory operates in perilous, isolated terrain—like the Qin army passing through Zhou to strike Zheng. This is mentioned outside the nine terrains because such scenarios occurred during the Warring States period.”

Where four roads converge lies *qu* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “Highways radiate in all directions; the enemy faces one front.”
Zhang Yu said: “The enemy holds one front while neighboring states surround the rest.”

Deep penetration leads to *zhong* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “The soldiers treat the army as home, so their resolve does not waver.”

Shallow penetration leads to *light* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “The return to one’s state is still near, so the heart cannot focus.”

Where one’s back is secure and the front is narrow lies *encircled* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “The rear abuts perilous defenses while the front faces a constricted pass.”
Zhang Yu said: “With narrow front and treacherous rear, advance and retreat are controlled by the enemy.”

Where there is nowhere to go lies *dead* terrain.
Mei Yaochen said: “Exhausted with nowhere to turn.”
Zhang Yu said: “Surrounded on all sides with nowhere to turn.”

Thus, in *dispersive* terrain, I will unify their resolve.
Li Quan said: “Unify the hearts of the soldiers.”
Du Mu said: “In defense, resolve is unified; in battle, it easily scatters.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Guard the city and prepare the defenses, unifying resolve for firm defense; await their laxity, then sally forth to strike.”
Zhang Yu said: “Gather the people and store grain, unifying resolve for steadfast defense; rely on perilous terrain to set ambushes and attack the enemy unawares.”

In *light* terrain, I will ensure their cohesion.
Cao Cao and Li Quan said: “Ensure they remain connected.”
Du Mu said: “Formations and encampments should be closely linked, for in light terrain—first, to prevent escape, and second, to ensure mutual support should the enemy arrive.”
Du You said: “*Shi* means to remain connected. When withdrawing through light terrain, one must secure the roads and hasten the march, ensuring continuous cohesion to guard against the unforeseen.”
Mei Yaochen said: “On the march, units follow in succession; at rest, encampments remain linked, so that if the enemy arrives, the troops will not scatter.”
Wang Xi said: “If cut off, men cannot rely on one another.”
Zhang Yu said: “Form dense encampments and tight formations, ensuring continuous cohesion to guard against the unforeseen and prevent flight.”

In *contested* terrain, I will hasten to their rear.
Cao Cao said: “When advantageous terrain lies ahead, swiftly advance to their rear.”
Li Quan said: “Advantageous terrain must be contested; reinforce its defenses.” (Li Quan takes *qu* as a superfluous character.)
Du Mu said: “In terrain that must be contested, if I arrive later, I should swiftly advance to seize it—how much more so if I am not late?”
Chen Hao said: “Both explanations are incorrect. If the enemy holds the advantage, and I arrive later to contest it, would this not mean arriving late to the battlefield and hastening to battle in exhaustion? The true meaning of ‘hasten to their rear’ in contested terrain is this: if the advantage lies ahead, first dispatch elite troops to secure it; if the enemy relies on numbers to contest it, I will advance my main force to their rear—there is nothing that cannot be overcome, as when Zhao She defeated the Qin army.”
Du You said: “When advantageous terrain lies ahead, advance to their rear. In contested terrain, the first to secure it prevails; the one who fails to do so is defeated. Thus, follow their rear to ensure mutual support.”
Mei Yaochen said: “If the enemy has not yet reached the terrain and I am behind, I must swiftly advance to contest it.”
Zhang Yu said: “Contested terrain values speed; if the vanguard arrives but the rear does not, it will not suffice. Thus, one must swiftly advance to their rear, ensuring the head and tail arrive together. Alternatively, ‘hasten to their rear’ may mean setting out later but arriving first.”

In *intersecting* terrain, I will carefully guard.
Du Mu said: “Fortify the ramparts.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Carefully guard the ramparts and sever their lines of communication.”
Wang Xi said: “Fear that they will ambush me.”
Zhang Yu said: “One should not block their paths but instead fortify the defenses and await their arrival, then set ambushes to strike.”

In *hub* terrain, I will solidify our alliances.
Du Mu said: “Form alliances with the feudal lords, making them firm.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Solidify alliances with the feudal lords, ensuring they remain steadfast so the enemy does not gain them first.”
Wang Xi said: “Strengthen them with virtue, propriety, awe, and trust, while demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of the situation.”
Zhang Yu said: “Use wealth and goods to benefit them, and oaths to bind them, ensuring their firm and unwavering support so they will surely aid me.”

In *deep* terrain, I will ensure the continuity of provisions.
Cao Cao said: “Plunder their supplies.”
Li Quan said: “Quarter troops and procure grain from the enemy.” (*Ji* is also written as *lüe*.)
Jia Lin said: “Ensure provisions follow in unbroken succession.”
Du You said: “When deeply penetrating enemy territory, one must ensure the continuity of provisions.”
Mei Yaochen said: “With the roads distant and severed, one cannot return to the state for grain, so one must plunder the enemy to feed the army.”
Zhang Yu said: “When the army is in deep terrain, supply lines are cut off, and provisions must not run short; one must plunder the enemy to sustain the army.”

In *impassable* terrain, I will advance swiftly.
Cao Cao said: “Pass through quickly.”
Li Quan said: “One cannot linger.”
Du You said: “March swiftly without halting in such terrain.”
Mei Yaochen said: “With nothing to rely on, one must pass through quickly.”
Zhang Yu said: “When encountering impassable terrain, one should lead the troops through swiftly.”

In *encircled* terrain, I will seal the gaps.
Cao Cao and Li Quan said: “Unify the hearts of the soldiers.”
Du Mu said: “In military strategy, when encircling an army, one must leave a gap to show them a path to life, preventing them from resolving to die, and then strike. But if I am in encircled terrain and the enemy opens a path to life to lure my troops, I will instead seal it myself, instilling in the soldiers a resolve to fight to the death. In the late years of the Northern Wei, Gao Huan raised righteous troops in Hebei. Four generals—Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Tianguang, Erzhu Dulü, and Erzhu Zhongyuan—converged south of Ye with elite cavalry and infantry, numbering two hundred thousand, and encircled Gao Huan at Nanling Mountain. At the time, Gao Huan had two thousand cavalry and fewer than thirty thousand infantry. The Erzhu generals left their encirclement unclosed, but Gao Huan tied together oxen and donkeys to seal the gaps. Thus, his officers and soldiers fought desperately, charging on all sides, and decisively defeated the four Erzhu generals.”
Meng Shi said: “Intending to break out of the encirclement, one demonstrates firm resolve in defense.”
Du You said: “Sealing the gaps expresses the intent not to flee.”
Mei Yaochen said: “Seal the side paths oneself, ensuring the soldiers fight to the death.”
Wang Xi said: “Fear that the men will harbor thoughts of escape.”
Zhang Yu said: “When I am encircled by the enemy and they leave a path to life, I must seal it myself to unify the hearts of the soldiers.”

Qi’s Divine Marshal tied oxen and horses to block the roads, ensuring his soldiers fought to the death—this is the principle. In a desperate situation, I show them no hope of survival.

Cao Cao and Li Quan said: “To steel their resolve.”
Du Mu said: “Show them they must die, so they will rouse themselves to seek life.”
Jia Lin said: “Forbid valuables, abandon grain, block wells, and smash hearths—this demonstrates certain death.”
Du You said: “To inspire the troops.”
Burn the baggage, discard provisions, block wells, and level hearths—this shows no intent to live, ensuring they fight to the death.
Mei Yaochen said: “Only when death is certain can life be found; men will then exert all their strength.”
Wang Zhe echoed Mei Yaochen’s note. He Shi echoed Du Mu’s note.
Zhang Yu said: “Burn the baggage, discard provisions, block wells, and level hearths—this shows no hope of survival, inspiring them to fight to the death.”

Thus, the nature of soldiers is this: when encircled, they resist;
Cao Cao said: “They resist and hold firm.”
Li Quan said: “When the enemy encircles us, we resist them.”
Du Mu said: “When troops are in a besieged position, each man harbors the resolve to resist the enemy and hold victory—this is mutual resistance.”
Mei Yaochen echoed Du Mu’s note.
Zhang Yu said: “When encircled, they naturally hold and resist.”

When desperate, they unite in defense.
When they have no choice, they fight;
Cao Cao said: “Circumstances leave them no choice.”
Li Quan said: “When there is no choice, they fight.”
Mei Yaochen said: “When there is nowhere to turn, they must fight.”
Wang Xi said: “To escape death and hardship, they can only fight.”
Zhang Yu said: “When circumstances allow no alternative, they must fight with all their strength.”

When pressed beyond measure, they submit.
Cao Cao said: “When they are deeply trapped, they follow orders.”
Li Quan said: “When pressed beyond measure, they carefully observe.”
He also said: “When deeply pressed, they follow plans.”
Meng Shi said: “When deeply pressed, there is nothing they will not follow.”
Mei Yaochen echoed Meng Shi’s note.
Zhang Yu said: “When deeply mired in peril, they will follow any plan.”

As when Ban Chao, in Shanshan, wished to kill the barbarian envoys with his few dozen men, he earnestly exhorted them. His soldiers said: “Now, in this desperate situation, life and death follow the Marshal’s command.” This is the principle.

Thus, one who does not know the schemes of the feudal lords cannot form alliances in advance;
One who does not know the forms of mountains, forests, defiles, and marshes cannot march armies;
One who does not employ local guides cannot gain the advantages of terrain.
Cao Cao said: “These three matters were already stated above. They are repeated here because those who are incapable of using troops must be reminded again.”
Li Quan said: “These three are the essentials of warfare.”
Mei Yaochen said: “This was already explained in the *Military Disputes* chapter. Repeating these three matters emphasizes that one must know the enemy’s circumstances and the advantages and disadvantages of terrain in advance.”
Wang Xi said: “They are restated as a warning.”
Zhang Yu said: “Only by knowing these three can one assess the advantages and disadvantages of the nine terrains, hence their repetition here.”

If one is ignorant of even one of these four or five, they are not the troops of a hegemon-king.
Cao Cao said: “This refers to the advantages and disadvantages of the nine terrains.” Or he said: “The four or five matters above.”
Zhang Yu said: “The four or five refer to the advantages and disadvantages of the nine terrains. If even one is unknown, complete victory cannot be achieved.”

Now, the troops of a hegemon-king, when attacking a great state, prevent its forces from assembling;
Their might imposed upon the enemy prevents its alliances from uniting.
Li Quan said: “When troops are united and might is displayed, the feudal lords look to themselves and dare not form alliances.”
Du Mu said: “With power to spare, one can disperse the enemy.”
Meng Shi said: “Using virtue to restrain others, who would dare resist?”
Chen Hao said: “Even with the power of a hegemon-king, when attacking a great state, one’s forces cannot assemble—what matters is forming external alliances. Without this, merely imposing might upon the enemy and flaunting one’s strength will lead to defeat.”
Mei Yaochen said: “When attacking a great state, if one can divide its forces, then power is abundant. With power abundant, might is imposed upon the enemy; with might imposed, neighboring states fear; with neighboring states in fear, the enemy’s alliances cannot unite.”
Wang Zhe said: “If one knows the enemy’s schemes, gains the advantages of terrain, and shapes circumstances so they cannot aid or rely on one another, then even a great state—how could it assemble its forces to resist? The greater the might imposed, the less the enemy’s alliances can unite.”
Zhang Yu said: “Relying on wealth and strength to repeatedly attack great states, one’s own people will grow resentful and unable to assemble. When the might of one’s arms is twice that of the enemy state, the feudal lords will fear and dare not form alliances with it.” Or he said: “When invading a great state, if the great state suffers a defeat, smaller states will scatter and not assemble. As when Jin and Chu contended over Zheng: if Jin prevailed, Zheng submitted; if Jin faltered, Zheng rebelled. With smaller states scattered, the enemy’s power is divided and weakened. Or if one’s military might can prevail over them, then how would the feudal lords dare ally with the enemy?”

Thus, one does not contend for the alliances of all under Heaven, nor cultivate the power of all under Heaven. Extending one’s private will and imposing might upon the enemy, one can seize their cities and overthrow their states.
Cao Cao said: “A hegemon does not form alliances with the power of all the feudal lords under Heaven. Cutting off their alliances and seizing their power, one’s might can thus be extended for private ends.”
Li Quan said: “Only by cutting off the alliances of all under Heaven can one extend one’s private will—might without external alliances.”
Du Mu said: “*Xin* means to extend. One does not form neighborly aid nor cultivate plans of strategic power, but merely imposes military might upon the enemy state, valuing the extension of one’s private desires. Thus, their cities can be seized, their states overthrown.”
When Duke Huan of Qi asked Guan Zhong: “Must one first exhaust arms and armor, cultivate civil virtue, rectify borders, and befriend the four neighbors—then it will suffice?”

Thus, he restored the lands of Lu, Wei, and Yan that had been seized, and through amicable relations, the four neighbors grew deeply allied. Then he launched a southern campaign against Chu, a northern expedition against the Mountain Rong, controlled Lingzhi in the east, broke the Gubuzhu, and subdued the Flowing Sands in the west. He convened six assemblies of chariot armies and three assemblies of war chariots, then led the feudal lords to pay court to the Son of Heaven.

When Wu Fuchai crushed Yue at Kuaiji, defeated Qi at Ailing, dug canals through Shang and Lu, and met Jin at Huangchi, he contended for supremacy before returning. His might pressed upon the feudal lords, who dared not oppose him. Yet Goujian of Yue attacked him. Seeking aid from Qi and Chu, neither responded. His people exhausted and his troops worn, he was destroyed by Yue.

King Goujian of Yue asked Shen Baoxu about warfare: “To the south of Yue lies Chu, to the west Jin, and to the north Qi. In spring and autumn, we offer skins, silk, jade, and maidens to serve them, never daring to sever ties. I seek to avenge Wu—may I do so through battle?” Baoxu replied: “Excellent! Nothing could surpass this.” Thereupon, he attacked Wu and annihilated it.

Jia Lin said: “When the feudal lords are already fearful, they cannot form attachments or dare to unite in alliance. With our wisdom, strategies, and might in surplus, the feudal lords submit of their own accord—what need is there to cultivate alliances?” (Some versions read: *not serve*.)

Chen Hao said: “With wisdom and strength intact, authority and power in our grasp, we need only nurture our soldiers and devise invincible strategies. The feudal lords possess no power worth serving. Benevolence, wisdom, righteousness, and strategy are our private endowments, used to aid the multitudes. Thus it is said: extending private might shakes the world, virtue illuminates the four seas, grace moistens all beings, and trust reaches even swine and fish. The people’s hearts turn toward us, and none think of disobedience. Therefore, attacking cities ensures their capture, and striking states ensures their ruin.”

Mei Yaochen said: “When the enemy cannot unite with the feudal lords in alliance, we too need not contend for their alliances, nor nurture their power—we rely solely on our own strength. Our might thus surpasses the enemy’s, so their cities can be seized and their states overthrown. This is the art of hegemonic and kingly warfare.”

Wang Xi said: “By forming alliances and nurturing power, one can unite all under Heaven; by pursuing private ends and diminishing might, cities and states cannot be preserved.”

Zhang Yu said: “Without contending for alliances, one’s position becomes isolated and aid dwindles; without nurturing power, people scatter and the state weakens. Extending one’s private grudges and displaying military might against enemy states will ultimately lead to defeat. Alternatively: when enemy states cannot assemble their multitudes nor unite their alliances, we should sever their ties, seize their power, extend our desires, and double our might over theirs. Thus, their cities can be captured and their states overthrown.”

Enact rewards without law, suspend orders without governance.
Jia Lin said: “When seizing cities and overthrowing states, one suspends rewards and punishments beyond the state’s norms, issuing commands beyond regular governance—hence, *without law, without governance*.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Rewarding merit is not predetermined by law; swearing oaths before the enemy is not preordained by policy.”

Wang Xi said: “This deters treachery and overreach.”

Cao Cao said: “Military laws and orders are not preemptively suspended.”

The *Methods of the Sima* states: “Facing the enemy, swear oaths and reward merit.” This is what is meant.

Zhang Yu said: “Laws are not preemptively enforced, policies not preannounced—all are established in the moment to inspire the soldiers’ hearts. The *Methods of the Sima* states: ‘Facing the enemy, swear oaths and reward merit.’”

Command the masses of the Three Armies as if directing one man.
Cao Cao said: “*Fan* means to employ. With clear rewards and punishments, even when commanding many, it is as if directing one.”

Li Quan said: “One skilled in warfare enacts laws for attack without others knowing; suspends orders without decrees, yet people follow. Thus, commanding the masses is like commanding one.”

Mei Yaochen said: “*Fan* means to employ. With strict and clear rewards for transgressions, employing many is like employing few.”

Zhang Yu said: “Rewarding merit without delay, punishing crimes without deferral—with rewards and punishments both clear and swift, commanding many is like commanding few.”

Employ them in action, do not inform them with words.
Mei Yaochen said: “Use them for battle, do not reveal strategies to them.”

Wang Xi said: “If intentions leak, plans falter.”

Zhang Yu said: “Deploy them in combat, do not instruct them in stratagems—if people know the plans, they will doubt.” As when Pei Xingjian did not disclose to his soldiers the reason for relocating the camp.

Employ them with profit, do not inform them of harm.
Cao Cao said: “Do not let them know of harm.”

Li Quan said: “*Fan* means to employ. If soldiers know the words and the harm, they will grow suspicious and hesitant.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Issue commands that reveal profit, not harm.”

Wang Xi said: “To prevent doubt and fear.”

Zhang Yu said: “Human nature advances when seeing profit and avoids when knowing harm—thus, do not inform them of harm.”

Cast them into desperate terrain, then they will survive; plunge them into deadly ground, then they will live.
Cao Cao said: “They must fight to the death—those in desperate terrain do not fail.”

Sun Bin said: “Soldiers fear not being cast into deadly ground.”

Li Quan said: “Troops in deadly ground will fight resolutely to survive.” As when Han Xin’s army was stationed by the river.

Mei Yaochen said: “Though the terrain is called desperate, striving in battle averts desperation; though the ground is called deadly, fighting to the death averts death. Thus, desperation is the foundation of survival, and death the root of life.”

He Yan said: “As when the King of Han sent General Han Xin to strike Zhao. Thirty *li* from the Jingxing Pass, he halted and encamped. At midnight, he issued orders, selecting two thousand light cavalry, each carrying a red banner, to observe the Zhao army from a hidden path through the grassy mountains. He instructed: ‘When Zhao sees us retreat, they will empty their camp to pursue us. You must swiftly enter the Zhao camp, tear down their banners, and raise the Han flags.’ He ordered his deputy to proclaim: ‘Today we will crush Zhao and feast together.’”

Han Xin then dispatched ten thousand men to advance, arraying them with their backs to the river. The Zhao forces saw this from afar and laughed heartily. At dawn, Han Xin raised the great general’s banner and drums, marching out through the Jingxing Pass. Zhao opened their camp and struck, engaging in fierce battle for a long while. Thereupon, Han Xin feigned retreat toward his troops by the water. Zhao abandoned their camp to pursue him, but once Han Xin reached his water-bound formation, his men fought with desperate resolve, unable to be defeated. Meanwhile, the two thousand cavalry Han Xin had sent earlier galloped into the Zhao camp, tearing down all Zhao banners and raising the red flags of Han. The Zhao forces, failing to capture Han Xin and returning to their camp, saw the Han banners and were struck with terror. Their ranks fell into chaos, and they fled in disarray. The Han forces then launched a pincer attack, crushing the Zhao army of Chen Yu and Lu. Chen Yu was slain by the river, and the King of Zhao was captured.

The generals then questioned Han Xin: “The *Art of War* states: ‘To the right, mountains; to the front and left, water and marsh.’ Yet today, General, you ordered us to array with our backs to the water. You said, ‘We will crush Zhao and feast together.’ We did not understand, yet in the end, we prevailed. What strategy was this?”

Han Xin replied: “This is indeed in the *Art of War*—it is only that you did not perceive it. Does the *Art of War* not say: ‘Ensnare them in deadly ground, and they will live; place them in desperate ground, and they will survive’? Moreover, I had not the time to train and nurture these officers and men. This was what is called ‘driving market rabble into battle.’ In such a situation, unless they are placed in deadly ground where each man fights for his own life, how could I have used them? Had I given them ground for survival, they would have fled. Could I have relied on them then?”

The generals all bowed in admiration, saying: “This is beyond our understanding.”

When Liang General Chen Qingzhi defended the city of Woyang against the Later Wei army, the two sides remained locked in stalemate from spring to winter, engaging in dozens—even hundreds—of battles. The Wei reinforcements then began constructing fortifications behind his army. His deputy generals, fearing an attack from both front and rear, proposed a retreat.

Chen Qingzhi said: “We came here together and have endured a full year. The cost in provisions and arms has been immense. Now, none of the troops have the will to fight; all plot retreat. Is this how one seeks glory? No—it is mere banditry. I have heard that placing troops in deadly ground is the only way to seek survival. We must wait for a great confrontation, and only then will victory be certain.”

His generals, inspired by his resolve, followed his command. The Wei forces had established thirteen encampments in a flanking formation. Chen Qingzhi led his men in a night march, muffling their movements, and captured four of the Wei forts. The remaining nine still bristled with soldiers and arms. He then displayed the severed heads of the enemy, raised a battle cry, and attacked. The Wei forces collapsed in rout, and nearly all were slain or captured.

In the late years of the Later Wei, Gao Huan of Qi raised righteous troops in Hebei. At the time, the four generals of Erzhu Zhao and their forces, numbering two hundred thousand, encamped on either side of the Wen River. Gao Huan’s own troops numbered fewer than thirty thousand. Outnumbered, he arrayed his men in a circular formation at Hanling Mountain, blocking the roads with oxen and donkeys. Thus, his officers and men fought to the death, striking from all sides, and crushed the enemy.

When Gao Huan of Qi was outnumbered tenfold by the forces of Tian Guang and others, they surrounded him but left a gap. Gao Huan then sealed the gap himself, ensuring his men were resolved to die. Thus, he defeated the enemy.

When Sima Xiaonan, the Northern Prefect of Qi’s Northern Yu Province, defected to the Later Zhou, Zhou General Yang Zhong and Grand Marshal Daxi Wu were sent to reinforce him. Together, they led five thousand cavalry, each man riding a single horse, and galloped five hundred *li* into Qi territory via a hidden route. They sent three messengers ahead to inform Xiaonan, but none returned. When they were thirty *li* from Yu Province, Wu grew suspicious and wished to turn back.

Yang Zhong said: “There is only death in advancing; no life in retreat.”

With a thousand cavalry, he raced through the night to the city walls, where sheer cliffs surrounded them on all sides, and only the sound of watchmen’s clappers could be heard. Wu arrived later with several hundred cavalry from the west, while Zhong held the remaining troops in place, waiting for the gates to open before charging in. He then dispatched riders to summon Wu.

At the time, the Qi garrison commander, Fu Jingyuan, had arrayed two thousand armored soldiers at the eastern camp, raising signal beacons and maintaining strict vigilance. Wu, daunted, did not wish to hold the city. Instead, he took much wealth and treasure, escorting Xiaonan and his followers back first. Zhong remained with three thousand cavalry as the rear guard. When they reached the south of Luo, they all dismounted and rested. The Qi forces pursued them to the north of Luo.

Zhong addressed his officers and men: “Eat your fill. Now we are in deadly ground, and the enemy will not dare cross the water to face our charge.”

After they had eaten, the Qi forces feigned an attempt to cross the river. Zhong led a swift charge against them, and the Qi troops dared not press forward, eventually withdrawing in an orderly retreat.

Zhang Yu said: “Placing men in deadly ground forces each to fight for himself, and thus they may live. When Xiang Yu rescued Zhao, he smashed his cauldrons and burned his huts, showing his men there was no retreat. The feudal lords watched from their ramparts as the Chu warriors fought with the strength of ten men each, and thus they captured the Qin general. Only when the masses are plunged into peril can victory or defeat be decided.”

Mei Yaochen said: “If they are not placed in desperate ground, the soldiers’ hearts will not be single-minded. Only when they are plunged into peril does victory or defeat rest in human effort.”

Zhang Yu said: “When soldiers are resolved to obey commands, victory or defeat lies in our own hands. Thus, the art of war lies in discerning the enemy’s intent.”

Cao Cao said: “‘Feigning’ means to deceive. If the enemy wishes to advance, set an ambush and retreat; if they wish to withdraw, leave an opening and strike.”

Li Quan said: “If the enemy wishes to attack, I await them with defense; if they wish to engage, I await them with the unexpected. Retreating, ambushing, or enticing with advantage—all follow their desires.”

Du Mu said: “To follow the enemy’s intent means that when I wish to strike but see no opening, I conceal my form and hide my traces, allowing the enemy to act without alarm. If they press hard against me, I feign weakness and lie in wait, submitting to their strength to inflate their arrogance, then strike when they grow careless. If they wish to retreat, I open a path for their withdrawal, letting them depart without fight, then attack as they leave. All these are ways of following the enemy’s intent.”

Chen Hao said: “Following the enemy’s intent requires no elaborate explanation—merely show strength as weakness, advance as retreat, so the enemy grows careless, and then strike to break them.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Feigning fear, feigning weakness, feigning disorder, feigning flight—when the enemy comes lightly, my will prevails.”

Zhang Yu said: “If they wish to advance, entice them to advance; if they wish to retreat, ease their retreat, complying with their intent while setting ambushes to seize them. Some say: when the enemy has desires, comply with their wishes to make them arrogant, preserving them for later advantage. As when the Eastern Hu sent envoys to Modu, saying, ‘We desire the thousand-mile horse of Touman.’ Modu gave it. Again they sent envoys, saying, ‘We wish for the chanyu’s lady.’ Modu gave her as well. When they grew arrogant and careless, he struck and destroyed the Eastern Hu.”

“Unite against the enemy, and though a thousand *li* away, you may slay their general.”

Cao Cao said: “Uniting forces against the enemy, even a thousand *li* distant, you can capture their general.”

Du Mu said: “The above speaks of the art of war lying in following the enemy’s intent—this refers to when no opening is yet seen. If an opening appears and an opportunity to attack arises, then concentrate forces and direct them against the enemy; though a thousand *li* away, you may slay their general.”

Jia Lin said: “If you can entice the enemy with advantage, making them rush toward it, then even a thousand *li* distant, you may capture and kill their general.”

Mei Yaochen said: “Follow the enemy’s direction, then unleash ambushes and surprises to seize their general from afar.”

Wang Xi said: “Follow the enemy’s intent and adapt to their movements; when they are unprepared and vulnerable, unite your forces and strike with full strength. Seizing the momentum, you may overturn their army and slay their general a thousand *li* away.”

Zhang Yu said: “Once the enemy grows arrogant and indolent, concentrate your forces to strike them, overturning their army and killing their general—as Modu destroyed the Eastern Hu. This is called skillfully accomplishing the task.”

Cao Cao said: “This is the skill of accomplishing the task.” (Alternatively: “This is called skillfully attacking to accomplish the task.”)

Mei Yaochen said: “To follow the enemy and secure victory is the work of cunning.”

He Shi said: “One who can do this accomplishes the task through skillful attack.”

Zhang Yu said: “First following their intent, then slaying their general—this is the skill of accomplishing the task.”

“Thus, on the day the campaign is launched, close the passes, break the tallies, and allow no communication with their envoys.”

Cao Cao said: “Once the plan is set, close the passes to sever their tallies and tokens, and do not receive their envoys.”

Li Quan said: “Once the orders are issued, close the passes and break the tallies, allowing no dissent to disturb the soldiers’ resolve.”

Du Mu said: “What is meant by ‘not allowing communication’—surely not the enemy’s envoys? If we refuse their envoys, why must we close the passes and break the tallies to prevent communication? I answer: closing the passes and breaking the tallies prevents our people from entering or leaving, lest enemy spies slip in unseen, hiding their forms and traces, traversing perilous paths, or stealing tallies and seals, impersonating others to spy on us. ‘Allow no communication with their envoys’ means that if the enemy sends envoys, we should not receive them, for they may include wise and capable men like Zhang Mengtan or Lou Jing, who could discern our weaknesses from subtle signs and gauge our strength. This is when our military posture is not yet established, and we fear the enemy may act first to control us. Once our posture is set and we cross the border, then envoys may move between sides—this is the ancient way.”

Mei Yaochen said: “‘Yi’ means to erase; ‘zhe’ means to break. On the day the campaign is launched, erase and block the passes and bridges, break and destroy the tallies, allowing no communication. ‘Allow no communication’ means fearing the leakage of our plans.”

Zhang Yu said: “Once the temple calculations are complete and the military plans are set, block the passes and bridges, break the tallies and tokens, and allow no communication of orders, lest our plans be revealed. If the enemy sends envoys, they should be received—hence the following text says: ‘When the enemy opens or closes, swiftly enter.’”

“Sharpen your plans in the temple halls to settle the matter.”

Cao Cao said: “‘Zhu’ means to manage. Sharpen the plans in the temple halls to settle the matter beforehand.”

Du Mu said: “‘Li’ means to whet. In the temple halls, refine and settle the plans, determining success or failure before raising the army.” (Alternatively: “to devise the plans.”)

Mei Yaochen said: “Prepare rigorously in the temple halls to devise the plans—this speaks of secrecy.”

He Shi said: “Hone the victorious strategies of the temple to ensure the task is accomplished.”

Zhang Yu said: “War is a grave matter; it must not be lightly discussed. One must be vigilant in the temple halls, secretly managing the plans, valuing secrecy to prevent leaks.”

“When the enemy opens or closes, swiftly enter.”

Cao Cao said: “If the enemy has an opening, swiftly enter it.”

Li Quan said: “If the enemy’s opening or closing is uncertain, act swiftly.”

Meng Shi said: “‘Opening and closing’ refers to gaps. If an opening appears, swiftly enter it.”

Mei Yaochen’s note agrees with Meng Shi.

Zhang Yu said: “‘Opening and closing’ refers to envoys.”

If the enemy sends an agent, swiftly receive them.

Some say: This refers to when the enemy’s movements—opening or closing, advancing or retreating—are unpredictable and disordered; one should swiftly seize the opportunity.

**Strike first at what they cherish.**
Cao Cao said: Seize advantageous positions.
Li Quan said: First attack their supplies and their wives and children, for profit admits no hesitation.
Du Mu said: Whatever the enemy cherishes and relies upon for their campaign, strike there first.
Mei Yaochen said: First discern what they value and find advantageous.
He Shi agrees with Du Mu’s note.

**Secretly set a rendezvous with them.**
Cao Cao said: Let others depart later, but arrive first.
Du Mu said: *Wei* means “concealed.” Set the rendezvous at a place the enemy cherishes or finds advantageous, then secretly hasten to the appointed time to deceive them without their knowledge.
Chen Hao said: If I seize the advantageous ground first but the enemy does not come, what use is the gain? Thus, to take what they cherish, one must first secretly arrange a meeting with the enemy, misleading them so they will surely arrive.
Mei Yaochen said: Reveal the rendezvous subtly, so the agent returns to report; then, though I depart later, I arrive first. Departing later ensures they will come; arriving first allows me to seize what they cherish.
Wang Xi said: *Quan* means “deception.” *Wei* is how one feigns secrecy. Cao [Cao] said: Arrive before the enemy.
Zhang Yu said: What the enemy cherishes is advantageous ground. If I wish to occupy it first, I must subtly reveal my intent and arrange a meeting with them. As they rush toward it, I depart later but arrive first. The reason for letting the enemy move first is the fear that if I arrive and they do not come. Thus it is said: In contending for ground, I will hasten to follow behind.

**Follow the inked line, adapting to the enemy, to decide the battle.**
Cao Cao said: Follow the compass and square, but without fixed form.
Li Quan said: *Mo* means “the path.” If one takes a slow route and follows it, one may not arrive in time.
Du Mu said: *Mo* means “compass and square.” One must always follow the compass and square, strictly adhering to regulations, while adapting to the enemy’s movements. If an exploitable opportunity arises, then sally forth to decide the battle.
Chen Hao said: Though speed is essential in battle to decide the outcome, from beginning to end one must uphold regulations. Even in victory, one must not act recklessly or in disorder. At the Battle of Chengpu, Duke Wen of Jin ascended the ruins of Youxin and surveyed his army, saying: “Young and old observe propriety—this army can be used.” *Jianmo* is also written as *chanmo*.
Jia Lin said: *Chan* means “to remove”; *mo* means “the inked line.” In deciding battle according to the enemy’s plans, only victory is advantageous; one cannot be bound by the inked line.
Mei Yaochen said: Every movement must adhere to regulations, yet one must adapt to the enemy’s shifts, advancing in order as opportunity allows.
Wang Xi said: Follow the military method like an inked line, then one can adapt to the enemy and secure victory.
Zhang Yu said: Uphold regulations, follow the compass and square, adapt to the enemy’s changes, and remain formless—only then can one decide battle and achieve victory. *Mo* is the inked line. As with a woman’s movements—left and right, forward and back, kneeling and rising—all must conform to the compass, square, and inked line.

**Thus, at first be like a maiden—when the enemy opens the door, later be like a fleeing hare—the enemy will be unable to resist.**
Cao Cao and Li Quan said: The maiden appears weak; the fleeing hare moves swiftly.
Du Mu said: At first, the enemy will think me incapable, like a maiden’s weakness. Then I strike suddenly, swift and perilous as a hare’s escape—unassailable.
Some say: I evade the enemy like a fleeing hare.
They say: That is incorrect.

Mei Yaochen said: "At first like a maiden" refers to adhering to the compass and square; "later like a fleeing hare" describes the swiftness of responding to the enemy and deciding battle. Wang Xi said: The maiden follows the enemy; "opening the door" means unpreparedness; the fleeing hare signifies speed. As when Tian Dan defended Jimo and broke the Yan army. Zhang Yu said: In defense, be as weak as a maiden to make the enemy negligent, thus creating an opening; in attack, be as swift as a fleeing hare to exploit the enemy’s haste, leaving them no means to resist. When Sima Qian spoke of Tian Dan defending Jimo and attacking Qi Jie, was this not precisely the case?

*Fire Attack, Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Twelve*

Cao Cao said: When using fire to attack others, one must choose the proper time and day. Wang Xi said: Employ auxiliary forces to secure victory, and guard against reckless deployment. Zhang Yu said: When using fire to attack the enemy, first send spies to secretly reconnoiter—the distances of the terrain, the ease or peril of the routes—so that all is thoroughly known before advancing. Thus it follows the section on *Nine Terrains*.

Sunzi said: There are five methods of fire attack. The first is *fire against personnel*.
Li Quan said: Burn their encampments to kill their soldiers.
Du Mu said: Set fire to their stockades and thereby burn their troops.
Wu Qi said: When an army camps in wild marshes where grasses and trees are dense and rank, it may be destroyed by fire.
When the Former Lord of Shu attacked Wu, Wu’s general Lu Xun resisted him at Yiling. After an initial assault on one camp failed, the generals said: “We are merely wasting our troops.” Lu Xun replied: “I have now grasped the method to break the enemy.” He then ordered each man to carry a bundle of thatch, and with fire they overran the camp. Once the momentum was established, he led all his forces in a simultaneous assault. They slew Zhang Nan, Feng Xi, and the barbarian king Sha Mo Ke, destroyed over forty camps, and killed tens of thousands. The Former Lord fled under cover of night, abandoning nearly all his supplies and equipment, and later coughed up blood and died.
Mei Yaochen said: Burn their stockades and wild thickets to support the attack.
He Shi said: In the time of Duke Huan of Lu, the state of Zhu Lou’s Xianqiu was burned—this was the first recorded use of fire attack. Later military strategists developed the five methods of fire attack to aid in securing victory.
For example, during the Later Han, Ban Chao was sent to the Western Regions and arrived at Shanshan. In the early night, he led his officers and soldiers to raid the barbarian camp. A great wind arose, so Ban Chao ordered ten men to conceal themselves behind the enemy’s quarters with drums, instructing them: “When you see the fire ignite, all must beat the drums and shout loudly.” The rest took up arms and crossbows, lying in ambush on either side of the gate. Ban Chao set fire with the wind, and the drums and war cries erupted from front and rear. The barbarians were thrown into panic and confusion. Ban Chao personally slew three men, and the rest were all burned to death.
Another example: Huangfu Song led troops to suppress Zhang Jiao’s Yellow Turban rebels. Song defended Changshe, but when the rebels besieged the city, his forces were few and the army was terrified. He summoned his officers and said: “Victory in war depends on extraordinary tactics, not numbers. Now the rebels have built their camps amid grasses—easily vulnerable to wind and fire. If we set fire at night, they will surely be thrown into chaos. If we then sally forth to strike, success will be assured.” That evening, a great wind arose. Song gave orders to his troops, stationing them all on the eastern side of the city walls. He sent elite soldiers to secretly exit the siege and set fire to the enemy camp while shouting loudly, and the defenders on the walls raised torches in response. Song then sounded the drums and charged their formation. The rebels, thrown into panic, fled in disarray, and he crushed them.
Another example: During the Qianning era of the Later Liang’s Taizu, he personally led a great army east from Yunzhou, halting north of Yushan. Zhu Xuan, having learned of this, immediately advanced his troops to seek a swift battle. The Emperor arrayed his forces and marched out of the camp. By then, Xuan’s troops had already formed ranks before them. Soon, a strong southeast wind arose, and the Emperor’s army’s banners fell into disarray, with many showing fear. The Emperor immediately ordered his cavalry to crack their whips and shout, and suddenly a northwest wind arose. As both armies were amid grasses and brush, the Emperor ordered the fires set. The flames and smoke stretched across the sky, and he seized the opportunity to attack the rebel formation. Zhu Xuan was utterly routed, and the remnants fled into the Qing River. A *jingguan* was erected at the foot of Yushan.
Another example: During the Later Tang’s campaign against Shu, the Minister of Works, Ren Huan, led a great army to Hanzhou, where Kang Yanxiao came to meet him in battle. Huan ordered Dong Zhang to engage with the eastern Shu’s weak troops at the vanguard, while concealing elite soldiers behind them. When Yanxiao repelled the eastern Shu forces and pursued them in haste, he encountered the ambush. Yanxiao was defeated and fled into Hanzhou, shutting the gates and refusing to emerge. Meng Zhixiang of western Shu led twenty thousand troops to join forces with Huan in attacking the city. Hanzhou’s defenses were reinforced on all sides with bamboo and wooden stockades. In the third month, Huan arrayed his troops at Jinyan Bridge and then led his forces forward with drums and war cries, setting fires on all sides. The wind and flames filled the sky. Yanxiao, in dire straits, led his cavalry out to form ranks at Jinma Bridge, where he was again soundly defeated.
Zhang Yu said: Burn their encampments to converge and slaughter their troops—this is the primary method of fire attack. Ban Chao’s burning of the Xiongnu envoys is an example.

The second is *fire against supplies*.
Li Quan said: Burn their accumulated stores.
Du Mu said: *Supplies* refers to accumulated provisions—grain, fodder, and firewood.
When Gaozu was locked in stalemate with Xiang Yu at Chenggao, he was defeated by Yu and fled north across the river, where he joined Zhang Er and Han Xin’s forces. They fortified Xiuwu with deep moats and high ramparts. He sent Liu Jia with twenty thousand troops and several hundred cavalry across the Boma Ford into Chu territory, where they burned the enemy’s supplies, crippling their operations. The Chu army was left without food.
During Emperor Wen of the Sui, Gao Jiong proposed a strategy to conquer Chen, saying: “The soil of Jiangnan is thin, and its dwellings are mostly thatched and bamboo. Their stored provisions are not buried underground. We may secretly dispatch agents to set fires when the wind rises. After they repair the damage, we may burn them again. Within a few years, their resources and strength will be exhausted.” The Emperor implemented his plan, and the people of Chen grew increasingly impoverished.
Mei Yaochen said: Burn their stored supplies to deplete their fodder and grain.
Zhang Yu said: Burn their accumulated stores to leave them without fodder and grain. Thus it is said: An army without supplies will perish. Liu Jia’s burning of Chu’s supplies is an example.

The third is *fire against baggage trains*, and the fourth is *fire against storehouses*.
Li Quan said: Burn their baggage and incinerate their storehouses.
Du Mu said: *Baggage* refers to weapons, goods, and soldiers’ belongings carried in wagons while on the march and not yet settled. *Storehouses* are structures in cities or camps where such items are kept after halting. The contents of both are the same.
At the end of the Later Han, when Xu You defected from Yuan Shao to Cao Cao, he said: “Yuan Shao’s baggage train now numbers over ten thousand wagons, and his encampment is poorly defended. If you send light troops to raid them unexpectedly, burning their supplies, within three days Yuan Shao will defeat himself.”

Cao Cao rejoiced greatly and selected five thousand elite cavalry. They all bore Yuan Shao’s banners, held bits in their horses’ mouths, and advanced along secret paths, carrying bundles of firewood. When questioned along the way, they replied: “Lord Yuan fears Cao Cao will raid his rear guard, so he has sent reinforcements to bolster defenses.” Those who heard this believed it to be true and remained unalarmed. Upon reaching the encampment, they set great fires, throwing the camp into chaos. Seizing the moment, they crushed the enemy, and all the baggage trains were consumed in flames.

Chen Hao said: If the enemy cherishes certain possessions, these too may be targeted. Should they sally forth to rescue them, the fire will divide their forces. If their minds are further unsettled, their army may be broken and their generals slain.

Mei Yaochen said: Burn their baggage trains to deplete their supplies; burn their storehouses to empty their reserves.

He Shi said: As when Former Qin’s Fu Jian sent General Wang Meng to campaign against Former Yan’s Murong Wei. When the army reached the Lu River, Yan’s general Murong Ping led forty thousand troops to resist, seeking to wear them down through protracted warfare. Wang Meng dispatched General Guo Qing with five thousand infantry and cavalry, who advanced by night along a secret path, setting fire to Jin Mountain and burning Murong Ping’s baggage trains. The flames were visible even in Ye, and thus Former Yan was destroyed.

Zhang Yu said: Burn their baggage trains to cut off their supplies. Thus it is said: “An army without baggage trains will perish.” Cao Cao’s burning of Yuan Shao’s baggage trains is an example. Burn their storehouses to deplete their resources. Thus it is said: “An army without wealth will not attract soldiers.”

The fifth is *fire against formations*.
Li Quan said: Burn their formations and weapons.
Du Mu said: Burn their ranks and strike amid the ensuing chaos.
Mei Yaochen said: Burn their formations to deprive them of arms. *Formations* may also be written as *paths*.
Jia Lin said: *Paths* refer to supply routes. Burn to sever their grain and transport lines.
He Shi concurred with Jia Lin’s annotation.
Zhang Yu said: Burn their formations to leave them without weapons. Thus it is said: “If weapons are not sharp, it is difficult to meet the enemy.”

Fire must have its cause.
Cao Cao said: Rely on traitors.
Li Quan said: Rely on traitors to provide internal support.
Chen Hao said: One must seize the opportunity, not merely depend on traitors.
Jia Lin said: Take advantage of dry winds to set fires.
Zhang Yu said: In all fire attacks, one must exploit dry weather, flammable materials in the camp—such as thatch, bamboo, piled fodder, and stored grain—along with proximity to grasslands, and set fires when the wind rises.

Smoke and fire must be prepared in advance.
Cao Cao said: Smoke and fire refer to the tools for burning.
Li Quan said: Such as firewood, straw, mugwort, reeds, and dung.
Du Mu said: Mugwort, reeds, firewood, straw, grease, and oil must be prepared beforehand. Military methods include fire arrows, fire curtains, fire apricots, fire soldiers, fire beasts, fire birds, fire thieves, and fire crossbows—all of which may be employed.
Mei Yaochen said: Spies must lie in wait for opportunities, and fire must be prepared in advance. As the saying goes: “Only with preparation in all matters can there be no disaster.”
Zhang Yu said: The tools for storing and igniting fire must always be ready, awaiting the opportune moment to strike.

Fire has its proper time, and its ignition has its proper day.
Mei Yaochen said: It must not be set recklessly.
Zhang Yu said: It cannot be done haphazardly; one must await the right time and day.

The *time* refers to the dryness of Heaven.
Cao Cao said: Dryness means drought.
Mei Yaochen said: When it is dry and parched, fire spreads easily.
Zhang Yu said: When the weather is dry, fire burns readily.

The *day* refers to when the moon is in the *Ji*, *Bi*, *Yi*, or *Zhen* constellations. These four lodges are the days when wind arises.
Li Quan said: The *Tianwen Zhi* records that when the moon lodges in these constellations, winds often blow. The *Yu Jing* states: “Regularly observe the moon’s position relative to the sun, counting fifteen from *Yingshi* to *Yi*, where the moon lodges.”
Du Mu said: *Lodges* refer to the moon’s position. These four lodges are the harbingers of wind.
Mei Yaochen said: *Ji* is the Dragon’s Tail; *Bi* is the Eastern Wall; *Yi* and *Zhen* are the Quail’s Tail. *Lodging* means the moon’s position. When the moon passes through these four, wind will surely rise.
Zhang Yu said: These four stars favor wind; when the moon lodges among them, wind arises. One must calculate the moon’s position to know the day it lodges there, then set the fire.

Another method: In spring, the days of *bing* and *ding*; in summer, *wu* and *ji*; in autumn, *ren* and *gui*; in winter, *jia* and *yi*—on these days, fierce winds and heavy rains often occur. Another method for divining wind: Take a chicken feather weighing eight taels, hang it on a fifty-foot pole, and observe the direction from which the wind blows. The four lodges are *Ji*, *Bi*, *Yi*, and *Zhen*.

In all fire attacks, one must respond to the changes of the five fires.
Mei Yaochen said: Exploit the changes of fire and respond with troops.
Zhang Yu said: Respond to the fire’s changes with troops. The five fires are *fire against personnel*, *fire against supplies*, *fire against baggage trains*, *fire against storehouses*, and *fire against formations*.

If fire is set within, respond swiftly from without.
Cao Cao said: Respond with troops.
Li Quan said: Exploit the fire’s momentum to strike.
Du Mu said: Fire is used to throw the enemy into confusion, then strike—it is not meant to defeat the enemy with fire alone. Attack as soon as the fire is lit; if you wait until the fire subsides and the enemy regains composure, it will be of no benefit. Thus it is said: “swiftly.”
Du You said: Have agents set fire within the enemy camp, then swiftly advance to attack from without.
Mei Yaochen said: If they are thrown into chaos within, strike with troops from without.
Zhang Yu said: As soon as fire is set within, strike swiftly from without. Attacking both inside and out will easily throw the enemy into disarray.

If fire is set but the enemy remains calm, wait and do not attack.
Du Mu said: If the fire causes no alarm, the enemy is well-prepared; do not attack hastily but wait for developments.

Mei Yaochen said: If they show no alarm or confusion, they are surely prepared.
Wang Xi said: Because they do not change.
He Shi said: If fire is set yet the enemy makes no outcry, they are prepared; if we attack, we may instead suffer harm.
Zhang Yu said: Though fire is lit, if their troops remain unshaken, the enemy is prepared; they are also guarding against developments, so we must not attack. Exhaust the fire’s power—proceed if you can, desist if you cannot.
Cao Cao said: Advance when you see opportunity, withdraw when you know difficulty.
Li Quan said: When fire is lit but the enemy remains orderly, do not attack.
Du Mu said: Wait until the fire has burned itself out; if the enemy becomes disordered, attack; if they remain calm throughout, withdraw your troops.
Du You said: Advance when you see advantage, retreat when you know peril. *Ji* means to exhaust. Exhaust the fire’s power—respond if you can, desist if you cannot, lest the enemy discern your intentions.
Mei Yaochen said: Exhaust the fire’s force; if they change, attack; if they do not change, do not attack.
Wang Xi said: Watch for signs of disorder and exploit them; if they remain orderly to the end, tend to your own forces and conserve your strength.
He Shi said: When Wei’s Man Chong campaigned against Wu, he instructed his generals: “Tonight the wind is fierce, and the enemy will surely come to burn our camp—prepare accordingly.” All the troops were alerted.

At midnight, the enemy indeed came to burn the camp, and Chong ambushed and crushed them—such was the case. Zhang Yu said: Exhaust the fire’s force; if they become disordered, attack; if they remain calm, retreat. Fire may be set externally without waiting for an internal response—strike when the moment is narrow.

Li Quan said: When Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao at Guandu, he followed Xu You’s plan and burned over ten thousand carts of supplies—this was its meaning. Du Mu said: The preceding text states that the five fires’ changes must be set from within. If the enemy camps in wild marshes or overgrown grass, or in a position where their stockades can be burned, then fire must be set at once, without waiting for an internal response before acting, lest the enemy burn the wild grass themselves and render our fire useless. When Han’s Li Ling campaigned against the Xiongnu and was defeated, he was pursued by the Chanyu to the great marshes. The Xiongnu set fire upwind, but Ling had already burned the reeds to create a firebreak, cutting off the flames’ advance.

Chen Hao said: Set fire at the proper time—this refers to the dryness of the heavens and the lodging of the moon among the Four Stars. Jia Lin said: Fire may be set externally without waiting for an internal response; seize the moment to act, not bound by rigid convention. Mei Yaochen’s note agrees with Du Mu’s.

Zhang Yu said: Fire may also be set externally without needing to wait for action from within; strike when opportunity arises. When the Yellow Turban rebel Zhang Jiao besieged Han General Huangfu Song at Changshe, the rebels camped among the grass. Song sent elite troops to slip beyond the encirclement, set fire, and raise a great shout, while those on the city walls lit torches in response. Song then sounded the drums and charged their ranks; the rebels, thrown into chaos, were routed.

Set fire upwind; do not attack downwind. Cao Cao said: It is not advantageous. Li Quan said: When the Jiangdong rebel Liu Yuanjin attacked Wang Shichong at Yanling during the Sui, he ordered grass piled to the east and set alight with the wind. Suddenly the wind shifted, and Yuanjin’s own camp was consumed, many of his troops perishing.

Du Mu said: If the fire is set to the east, then burn the enemy’s east, and we too shall attack their east. If fire is set to the east but we attack the west, we share the same fate as the enemy. Thus, do not attack downwind—this means following the wind. If one can act in the east, the same applies to other directions. Mei Yaochen said: Attacking against the fire’s force is not advantageous, for the enemy will fight to the death.

Wang Xi said: One may strike their flanks instead. Zhang Yu said: When they are burned, they must retreat; to attack them as they retreat is to force them into a desperate fight—this is not advantageous.

Day winds last long; night winds cease. Cao Cao said: This is the natural order. Li Quan said: They do not endure from beginning to end. Du Mu said: Laozi said: Whirlwinds do not last the morning. Mei Yaochen said: Day winds must cease by night, and night winds by day—this is the natural order. Wang Xi’s note agrees with Mei Yaochen’s.

Zhang Yu said: Winds that rise by day subside by night—this is the natural order. Thus Laozi said: Whirlwinds do not last the morning.

In all warfare, one must know the five fires’ changes and observe their patterns. Du Mu said: One must calculate the stars’ positions and await the day the wind rises before setting fire; it cannot be done haphazardly. Du You said: Having understood the five fires and their five changes, one must further weigh their feasibility by the numbers. Mei Yaochen said: Track the stars’ movements to determine the day the wind will rise, then set fire—but one must also guard against its changes.

Zhang Yu said: One must not only know how to attack with fire but also guard against being attacked by it. By reckoning the Four Stars’ degrees, one knows the day the wind will rise and can prepare defenses accordingly.

Thus, those who assist attack with fire achieve clarity; Mei Yaochen said: Victory is plain and easy. Zhang Yu said: Using fire to aid assault clearly secures victory.

Those who assist attack with water gain strength. Du You said: Water is used to breach, hence its strength. Mei Yaochen said: Its force is mighty. Zhang Yu said: Water can divide the enemy’s forces; when their strength is split, ours grows strong.

Water can cut off, but it cannot seize. Cao Cao said: Fire as an aid brings clear victory. Water as an aid can only cut off the enemy’s supply routes, divide their forces, and cannot seize their stores. Li Quan said: In warfare, one must adhere to strategic principles and employ water and fire as aids—this is how clarity and strength are achieved. Emperor Guangwu’s defeat of Wang Mang and Cao Cao’s capture of Lü Bu both exemplify this principle. Water can divide the enemy’s forces in two, but it is difficult to seize their stores with it.

Du Mu said: Water can cut off the enemy’s supply routes, reinforcements, escape routes, and assaults, but it cannot seize their strategic reserves or stockpiles. Wang Xi said: Strength lies in its sudden, overwhelming force. Zhang Yu said: Water can only isolate the enemy’s forces, preventing front and rear from supporting each other, securing a temporary victory; yet it does not compare to fire, which can burn and seize the enemy’s supplies, bringing about their annihilation. When Han Xin breached the waters to slay Chu’s general Long Ju, it was a temporary victory; when Cao Cao burned Yuan Shao’s supplies, Shao was thereby defeated—this was annihilation. Water is not fire’s equal, hence fire is discussed in detail while water is treated briefly.

In victory and conquest, if one does not cultivate its achievements, misfortune follows—this is called "wasteful delay." Cao Cao said: Like stagnant water, it does not return. Some say: If rewards are not timely, they become mere wasteful delay; rewards for good must not exceed a day. Li Quan said: Rewards must not exceed a day; punishments must not exceed an hour. If merit is established but not rewarded, or crimes committed but not punished, soldiers will grow doubtful, and daily waste will accrue.

Du Mu said: "Cultivate" means to act. In victory and conquest, if one does not promptly reward those of merit, the officers and troops will not give their full effort.

then misfortune and calamity arise, leaving only stagnation, waste, and depletion—nothing is ever accomplished.

Jia Lin said: "Wasteful delay" means begrudging expenditure.

Mei Yaochen said: To ensure that every battle is won and every assault succeeds, one must seize advantage and act upon opportunity, thereby establishing merit. Establishing merit involves employing fire attacks, water attacks, and the like—one cannot merely sit and guard the advantage. To sit and guard the advantage is inauspicious; this is called "wasteful delay."

Wang Xi said: In victory and conquest, if one does not promptly distinguish and reward merit, the people will not be encouraged; without encouragement, resources are squandered and the army grows weary—this is indeed misfortune.

Zhang Yu said: The reason battles and assaults are certain to succeed lies in the aid of water and fire. The reason water and fire can shatter armies and defeat enemies lies in the soldiers’ wholehearted effort. If one does not act upon and reward merit, it is the path to misfortune. When resources are exhausted and the army grows weary without hope of return, this is called "wasteful delay." Thus it is said: The enlightened ruler deliberates, the good general acts.

Du Mu said: Huang Shigong said: Those who seek hegemony control their officers with authority, bind them with trust, and employ them with rewards. If trust wanes, officers grow distant; if rewards are lacking, officers will not be of use.

Jia Lin said: The enlightened ruler deliberates the matter, the good general establishes the merit.

Mei Yaochen said: At first, the ruler initiates the deliberation; in the end, the general establishes the merit.

Zhang Yu said: The ruler should plan the affairs of attack and war, while the general should act upon and establish the merit of victory. Without advantage, do not move.

Li Quan said: Enlightened rulers and worthy generals do not raise arms unless they see advantage.

Du Mu said: First perceive the advantage of raising arms, then raise them.

Mei Yaochen said: Generally, armies are not mobilized unless they benefit the people. Another version reads: Without advantage, do not move. Without gain, do not employ.

Du Mu said: First perceive that the enemy can be overcome, then employ troops.

Jia Lin said: Without gaining advantage, do not employ them.

Without peril, do not engage in battle.

Cao Cao said: Troops are employed only when there is no alternative.

Li Quan said: Only in utmost peril is battle waged.

Mei Yaochen said: Generally, troops are not employed unless in dire emergency, for arms are instruments of ill omen.

Zhang Yu said: Arms are instruments of ill omen; battle is a perilous affair. One must guard against calamity and defeat, acting only when there is no alternative.

The ruler must not raise arms in anger.

Wang Xi said: One must not act merely out of anger, as when the Marquis of Xi attacked Zheng.

Zhang Yu said: To raise arms in anger is seldom not to perish. When the Marquis of Xi exchanged harsh words with the Earl of Zheng and then attacked him, the noble man knew thereby that Xi was doomed to fall.

The general must not provoke battle in resentment.

Wang Xi said: One must not act merely out of resentment, as when Zhao Chuan of Jin did.

Zhang Yu said: To engage in battle out of resentment is seldom not to be defeated. When Yao Xiang, enraged by Fu Jian’s general Huang Mei pressing against his ramparts, arrayed his troops and sallied forth, he was defeated by Huang Mei.

Anger is greater than resentment, hence it is spoken of in relation to the ruler; resentment is lesser than anger, hence it is spoken of in relation to the general. The ruler may raise arms, but the general may only speak of battle.

Act when it accords with advantage; cease when it does not accord with advantage.

Cao Cao said: One must not employ troops out of one’s own joy or anger.

Jia Lin said: When resentment and anger arise within, heedless of safety, it is surely impermissible.

Du You said: When the ruler assembles troops and raises arms, he must base his calculations of victory and defeat on reason, not on his own private anger. When the general deploys troops, he must do so by strategy, not out of personal resentment when engaging in battle.

Mei Yaochen said: Arms are employed for righteousness, not raised in anger; battle is won by advantage, not lost in resentment.

Zhang Yu said: One must not employ troops out of one’s own joy or anger, but must consider where advantage and harm lie.

The *Wei Liaozi* states: Troops are not raised out of indignation; they are raised when victory is foreseen, and cease when victory is not foreseen.

Anger may turn to joy again, resentment may turn to delight again.

Zhang Yu said: What is shown in countenance is called joy; what is felt in the heart is called delight.

A lost state cannot be restored, the dead cannot be brought back to life.

Du Mu said: To lose a state is not to destroy another’s state. It means failing to measure one’s virtue and power, raising arms in anger, and engaging in battle in resentment, so that one’s troops perish of themselves and one’s state falls of itself.

Du You said: When a ruler raises arms in anger to attack another, without prior planning or clear strategy, he will be ruined. When a general, in resentment, hastily engages in battle, the casualties will surely be many. Though anger and resentment may later turn to joy and delight, a lost state cannot be restored, nor can the dead be brought back to life—this is to say, one must be cautious.

Mei Yaochen said: A moment’s anger may be turned back to joy; a moment’s resentment may be turned back to delight. But a lost state and a dead army cannot be undone.

Wang Xi said: When joy and anger are inconstant, authority and trust depart.

Zhang Yu said: When a ruler raises arms in anger, his state will surely perish; when a general engages in battle in resentment, his troops will surely die. Therefore, the enlightened ruler is cautious, the good general is vigilant—this is the way to secure the state and preserve the army.

Du Mu said: *Jing* means to be warned and to take heed.

Mei Yaochen said: The ruler must be prudent, the general must be vigilant.

Zhang Yu said: When the ruler is ever cautious in employing troops, he may secure the state; when the general is ever vigilant against engaging lightly in battle, he may preserve the army.

*Annotations to Sunzi, Scroll Twelve ends*
*(Originally “知,” emended to “终” according to the Song edition.)*
*Annotations to Sunzi, Scroll Thirteen: “Employing Spies”*

Cao Cao and Li Quan said: In warfare, one must employ spies to ascertain the enemy’s true circumstances.

Zhang Yu said: To consistently know the enemy’s situation, nothing surpasses the use of spies. Yet the way of employing spies must be especially subtle and secret, which is why this follows the chapter on fire attacks.

Sunzi said: When an army of a hundred thousand is raised and dispatched a thousand *li*, the expenses borne by the people and the state treasury amount to a thousand gold pieces daily. The realm is thrown into turmoil, and those wearied on the roads, unable to tend to their work, number seven hundred thousand households.

Cao Cao said: In ancient times, eight households formed a neighborhood; when one household sent a soldier, the other seven supported him. Thus, when an army of a hundred thousand is mobilized, seven hundred thousand households cease farming.

Li Quan said: In ancient times, when one household’s soldier was conscripted, the three clans of his neighbors jointly provided for him. Hence, seven hundred thousand households, unable to till the land, sustained a hundred thousand troops.

Du Mu said: In ancient times, one man farmed one *qing* of land. Nine *qing* formed a well-field: the central *qing* was dug for a well and planted with a hut, while eight households lived around it. *Dai* means weariness. Thus, seven hundred thousand households supporting a hundred thousand troops exhausted themselves transporting supplies on the roads.

Mei Yaochen said: The burden of transporting grain and provisions, both public and private, wearies the people on the roads and keeps them from their plows. Cao’s explanation is correct.

Zhang Yu said: According to the well-field system, eight households formed a neighborhood; when one household sent a soldier, the other seven supported him. Thus, raising an army of a hundred thousand meant seven hundred thousand households ceased farming.

Someone asked: In hostile territory, one plunders, yet here it speaks of weariness from transport—why? The answer: It is not only about moving grain but also supplying equipment. Moreover, the principle of plundering the enemy refers to deep incursions into enemy territory, where one must prepare for shortages and thus plunder to sustain provisions—not solely relying on the enemy’s stores. In barren lands where no grain can be found, must one not still supply the troops? To contend for years over a single day’s victory yet begrudge ranks, emoluments, or a hundred gold pieces, remaining ignorant of the enemy’s situation, is the height of inhumanity.

Li Quan said: To begrudge rewards and not employ spies to observe the enemy’s movements is the height of inhumanity.

Du Mu said: It means being unable to use generous rewards to employ spies.

Mei Yaochen said: After years of stalemate, the expenses of seven hundred thousand households are vast; to begrudge even a hundred gold pieces in ranks and emoluments, refusing to use them to employ spies and secure victory, is the utmost inhumanity.

Wang Xi said: To be stingy with wealth and rewards is to refuse to use spies.

Zhang Yu said: After prolonged conflict, the resources of seven hundred thousand households are exhausted; to show no concern for this yet begrudge even small rewards, refusing to use them to employ spies and learn the enemy’s situation, is the height of inhumanity.

Such a one is no leader of men,
Mei Yaochen said: Not one who leads men to success.

no aide to a ruler,
*(One version reads: no humane aide.)*
Mei Yaochen said: Not one who aids the state with humanity.

no master of victory.
Mei Yaochen said: Not one who secures the ruler’s advantage.

Zhang Yu said: Such a one cannot lead men, cannot aid a ruler, and cannot secure victory. The lament in these words is profound.

Thus, enlightened rulers and worthy generals, who act and prevail over others, whose achievements surpass the multitude, do so through foreknowledge.

Li Quan said: By employing spies.

Du Mu said: By knowing the enemy’s situation.

Mei Yaochen said: The ruler does not act recklessly but prevails when he does; the general does not seek success lightly but achieves it beyond others. Why? Because they foreknow the enemy’s situation.

Wang Xi said: To foreknow the enemy’s situation is to secure victory as if by divine means.

He Shi said: The *Zhouli*’s *Officer of Justice* oversees state spies, referring to those who secretly observe foreign lands. Thus, military strategists speak of the four opportunities and two advantages—*affairs-opportunity* and *wisdom-advantage*—both of which depend on skillful use of spies. Only then can the enemy’s movements be known in advance.

When Wei Xiaokuan served as General of the Cavalry and defended Yubi, he excelled in governance and won the people’s hearts. All the spies he sent into Qi worked with utmost dedication; some Qi men, receiving Wei’s gold and goods, secretly sent him letters. Thus, the court always knew Qi’s movements in advance. At the time, there was a commander named Xu Pen, whom Wei trusted as his right-hand man and stationed to guard a fortress. Xu then surrendered the city and defected to Qi. Enraged, Wei sent agents to capture him. Soon after, they returned with his severed head. Such was his mastery of human affairs.

Moreover, when Li Da served as Area Commander of Yizhou, Hongnong, and twenty-one other defensive garrisons, he consistently treated those beyond the borders with great generosity, employing them as spies. Thus, every movement within the enemy camp was known to him in advance. Even when some were exposed and executed, they felt no regret—such was his ability to win hearts.

Zhang Yu remarked: "To know the enemy’s situation beforehand is to act with advantage over others, achieving towering merit that surpasses the multitude. Yet this foreknowledge cannot be sought from ghosts or spirits." Zhang Yu said: "Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, it cannot be obtained through prayers or sacrifices." Nor can it be inferred from events. Cao Cao said: "It cannot be sought through prayers or by analogy to other affairs." Li Quan said: "It cannot be taken from ghosts, spirits, or analogies—only spies can know the enemy’s true condition." Du Mu said: "Analogy means resemblance—one cannot seek it by likening it to other matters." Mei Yaochen said: "It cannot be known through divination or by analogy to other events." Zhang Yu said: "It cannot be inferred by likening it to similar affairs."

Nor can it be verified by measurement. Cao Cao said: "It cannot be determined by numerical calculations." Li Quan said: "Measurement refers to quantities—length and breadth, distance and proximity, size and scale can all be verified by measurement, but the truth or falsehood of human affairs cannot be known through such means." Mei Yaochen said: "It cannot be verified by calculations—this speaks to the difficulty of foreknowledge." Zhang Yu said: "It cannot be deduced through measurement or verification."

It must be obtained from people—those who know the enemy’s situation. Cao Cao said: "Through people." Li Quan said: "Through spies." Mei Yaochen said: "The will of ghosts and spirits may be known through divination; the forms and qi of things may be sought by analogy; the principles of heaven and earth may be verified by measurement. But the enemy’s true condition can only be known through spies." Zhang Yu said: "Ghosts, spirits, analogies, and measurements—none can provide foreknowledge. Only through people can the enemy’s situation be known."

Thus, there are five types of spies: *local spies*, *internal spies*, *double agents*, *expendable spies*, and *surviving spies*. Mei Yaochen said: "These are the names of the five types of spies." Zhang Yu said: "*Local spies* should be called *native spies*—as the text below states: 'Native spies can be employed.'"

When all five types are deployed simultaneously, none can discern their methods—this is called the *divine principle*, the treasure of a ruler. Cao Cao said: "Employing all five types of spies at once." Li Quan said: "The five types of spies are used through five different people." Du Mu said: "When all five types are active, the enemy cannot perceive how their secrets are exposed—this is the divine thread of strategy, the ruler’s most precious asset." Mei Yaochen said: "When all five types of spies are deployed against the enemy, none can fathom how they are used—this is the sublime and wondrous *divine principle*, what a ruler must value." Wang Xi said: "When all five types are active, none can predict their workings—this is the great *divine principle* of martial strategy, the ruler’s most treasured asset." Jia Lin said: "*Principle* means reason—when the enemy cannot discern by what means their secrets are known, it is as if through divine reason." Zhang Yu said: "When the five types of spies are used in rotation, none can grasp their logic—this is the wondrous *divine principle*, the ruler’s most precious treasure."

A *local spy* is one employed from among the enemy’s own people. Du Mu said: "Using the enemy’s own countrymen, treating them generously to make them spies." When Zu Ti, Inspector of Yuzhou, garrisoned Yongqiu, he cherished the people and humbled himself before scholars. Even those of distant acquaintance or lowly status were treated with kindness and courtesy. Along the Yellow River, there were fortresses where some had family hostages among the Hu barbarians, and he allowed them to maintain ties with both sides. At times, he would send raiding parties to feign attacks, making clear their lack of allegiance. The fortress lords, moved by his virtue, would secretly report any disloyal schemes among the Hu. Through this, he achieved repeated victories. When Wei Xiaokuan sent Qi men to behead Xu Pen and return, it was of the same principle. Jia Lin said: "Read *local spies* as *native spies*." Du You said: "Using the enemy’s own people to learn their internal and external conditions, then employing them to gather intelligence." Mei Yaochen said: "Using the enemy’s people, enticing them to serve." He Shi said: "As in the Spring and Autumn period, when the Chu army besieged Song for nine months without success and prepared to withdraw, the Chu minister Shen Shushi said: 'Build houses and return to farming—Song will surely submit.' The Chu ruler followed his advice. The Song people, alarmed, sent Hua Yuan to sneak into the Chu camp by night. He climbed onto the bed of Zi Fan, woke him, and said: 'Our lord sent me to report our distress: our city resorts to exchanging children for food and breaking bones for fuel. Yet though we face such hardship, we cannot accept a treaty sworn beneath your walls. Withdraw thirty li, and we will obey your commands.' Zi Fan, fearful, made a pact with him and reported to the Chu ruler, who then withdrew thirty li. Thus, Song and Chu made peace." Zhang Yu said: "Using the enemy’s people to learn their internal and external conditions, then employing them to gather intelligence—Wei Xiaokuan’s use of gold and silk to entice Qi men, who then secretly sent letters, is an example of this."

An *internal spy* is one employed from among the enemy’s officials. Li Quan said: "Using disaffected officials of the enemy—like Wei’s use of Xu You." Du Mu said: "Among the enemy’s officials, there may be worthy men who have lost their positions, those punished for offenses, those favored but greedy for wealth, those trapped in low ranks, those denied proper employment, those seeking to prove their talents amid defeat, or those who vacillate between sides. Such officials can all be secretly contacted, lavished with gifts and gold, and won over."

Seeking to learn the enemy state’s internal conditions, one observes their schemes against us, then sows discord among their ruler and ministers to prevent unity. Du You said: "Among their officials, there are those who have lost their positions—such as the descendants of the executed or the families of the punished. Exploit their grievances and employ them." Mei Yaochen said: "Through their officials and subordinates, one may form ties and utilize them." He Shi said:

For example, when Luo Shang, Governor of Yizhou, dispatched General Kui Bo to attack the Shu rebel Li Xiong at Pi City, the two sides fought with alternating victories. Li Xiong then recruited Pu Tai, a man from Wudu, had him flogged until bloodied, and sent him to deceive Luo Shang, pretending to serve as an internal ally with fire as the signal. Shang believed him. He sent out all his elite troops, ordering Kui Bo and others to follow Pu Tai in attacking Li Xiong. Li Xiong’s general Li Xiang set an ambush along the way. Pu Tai leaned a long ladder against the city wall and lit the fire. When Kui Bo’s forces saw the flames, they scrambled up the ladder, but Pu Tai then hauled up over a hundred of Shang’s soldiers with ropes and executed them all. Li Xiong then unleashed his troops, striking from both inside and outside, and crushed Shang’s army. This was the power of employing an *internal spy*.

Another case: During the Sui Dynasty, Yin Shou, as Governor of Youzhou, faced a rebellion by Gao Baoning. Shou marched to suppress it, and Baoning fled to the northern deserts. After Shou withdrew his main force, he left General Cheng Da’ang to garrison the region. Baoning sent his son, Sengga, with light cavalry to raid the city before retreating, then soon returned with Khitan and Mohe troops to attack. Da’ang fought desperately for months before repelling them. Troubled, Shou heavily bribed Baoning while secretly sending agents to subvert his trusted aides, Zhao Shimu and Wang Wei. Within a month, Shimu led his followers to surrender. Baoning fled again to the Khitan, where he was killed by his subordinate Zhao Xiuluo, and the northern frontier was thus pacified.

Later, when Emperor Taizong of Tang campaigned against Dou Jiande and entered Wugong, he pressed close to Jiande’s camp, inflicting heavy casualties. Ling Jing then advised: "You should lead all your troops across the Yellow River, seize Huaizhou and Heyang, stationing a strong general to hold them. Then, with drums beating and banners flying, cross the Taihang Mountains into Shangdang, creating a clamor to precede your advance. Issue proclamations to secure the region, then march toward Hukou, alarming Putjin, and take the lands of Hedong. This is the best strategy." Its execution would yield three advantages: first, entering undefended territory, ensuring the army’s absolute security; second, expanding territory and gaining troops; and third, lifting the siege of Zheng without effort.

Jiande was about to adopt Ling Jing’s plan when Wang Shichong’s envoy, Changsun Anshi, secretly delivered gold and jade to bribe his generals, disrupting the strategy. The assembled officers all urged, "Ling Jing is but a scholar—how can one discuss warfare with him?" Jiande followed their counsel and, withdrawing, apologized to Jing: "Now the army’s morale is at its peak—this is Heaven aiding me. By engaging in decisive battle, we shall surely achieve great victory. I have heeded the majority’s advice and cannot follow your proposal." Jing persisted in his argument, but Jiande grew enraged and had him beaten and expelled. Thereupon, Jiande led all his forces to press the siege at Wugong. Taizong held his position, blunting their momentum. Jiande was struck by a spear and fled to Niukou Shoal, where Cavalry General Bai Shirang and Yang Wuwei captured him alive.

Earlier, when Wang Jian served as Qin’s general attacking Zhao, Zhao dispatched Li Mu and Sima Shang to resist him. Li Mu repeatedly routed the Qin forces, slaying Qin’s general Huan Yi. Jian, resenting this, lavished gold upon Zhao King’s favored minister Guo Kai and others, instructing them to spread slander: "Li Mu and Sima Shang intend to betray Zhao and ally with Qin, seeking vast rewards from Qin." The Zhao King grew suspicious, replacing them with Zhao Cong and Yan Ju, executing Li Mu and dismissing Sima Shang. Three months later, Jian launched a swift assault on Zhao, crushing its forces, killing Zhao Cong, and capturing King Qian of Zhao along with his general Yan Ju.

Zhang Yu remarked: "Exploit those in disfavor, or the kin of the executed, or any with grievances—entice them with generous rewards." The cases of Jin’s Ren Xigong and Wu’s acceptance of Wu Zixu both exemplify this. The *fan jian* (turned agent) operates by co-opting the enemy’s spies.

Li Quan said: "When the enemy sends spies to observe our strengths and weaknesses, we may bribe them heavily to turn them into our own agents."

Du Mu said: "When the enemy dispatches spies to observe us, we must first detect them. Either we entice them with generous rewards to serve us, or we feign ignorance, feed them false intelligence, and release them—thus the enemy’s spies become our own."

When Chen Ping first served as the Han King’s Chief Military Inspector, Xiang Yu besieged him at Rongyang. The Han King, distressed, offered to cede all lands west of Rongyang in exchange for peace, but Xiang Yu refused. Chen Ping said: "Yet there is a way to sow discord in Chu. Xiang Yu’s upright ministers—only the likes of Fan Zeng, Zhongli Mo, Long Ju, and Zhou Yin—number but a few. If Your Majesty can expend tens of thousands of *jin* of gold to spread rumors and divide their ruler and ministers, fostering mutual suspicion—Xiang Yu is by nature suspicious and prone to heeding slander—then they will surely turn on one another. The Han can then raise its armies and attack, and the destruction of Chu is assured." The Han King approved, allocating forty thousand *jin* of gold to Chen Ping, granting him free rein without questioning expenditures. Chen Ping distributed the gold liberally, disseminating rumors among the Chu forces: "Generals like Zhongli Mo have rendered great service to Xiang Yu, yet they will never be enfeoffed as kings or granted lands. They now seek to ally with Han to overthrow Xiang’s house and divide its territory among themselves." Xiang Yu indeed grew suspicious and dispatched envoys to Han. The Han prepared a grand feast, but upon seeing the Chu envoy, feigned shock: "I thought this was Fan Zeng’s envoy—it is Xiang Yu’s!" They then withdrew the feast and served the envoy coarse fare instead. The envoy returned and reported all to Xiang Yu, who grew deeply suspicious of Fan Zeng. Fan Zeng urged an immediate assault on Rongyang, but Xiang Yu, distrustful, refused to heed him. When Fan Zeng learned of Xiang Yu’s suspicions, he flew into a rage, spat blood, and died. In the end, Chen Ping’s stratagem was used to destroy Chu.

Mei Yaochen said: "Either deceive them with falsehoods or entice them with generous rewards."

Wang Xi said: "*Fan jian* means turning them into our own agents. Either detain them to extract intelligence or present them with deceptive appearances before sending them back."

He Shi said: "When King Zhao of Yan appointed Yue Yi as his general, Yue conquered over seventy cities of Qi. But upon King Hui’s ascension, he grew estranged from Yue Yi. Qi’s general Tian Dan then spread rumors in Yan: 'The Qi king is already dead, and only two cities remain unconquered. Yue Yi, fearing execution, dares not return. Under the pretext of attacking Qi, he truly seeks to amass troops, face south, and claim the throne of Qi. The Qi people have not yet submitted, so he delays at Jimo to await developments. What Qi fears most is the arrival of another general—then Jimo will fall.'" The Yan king believed this and replaced Yue Yi with Qi Jie. The Yan army’s morale collapsed. Tian Dan then spread further rumors: "We fear the Yan forces will desecrate our ancestral tombs outside the city and defile our forebears." The Yan troops did so, enraging the people of Jimo, who begged to fight. They crushed the Yan forces, recovering all seventy-odd lost cities.

When the Qin army besieged Zhao at Yeyu, Zhao’s general Zhao She came to its relief but halted thirty *li* from the Zhao capital without advancing. A Qin spy arrived, and Zhao She treated him well and sent him back. The spy reported to the Qin general that Zhao She’s army was timid and inactive. Zhao She then feigned retreat, swiftly armored his troops, and rushed the Qin forces, defeating them.

Later, when Fan Sui served as Chancellor to King Zhao of Qin, he dispatched Zuo Shuzhang Wang He to attack Han and seize Shangdang. The people of Shangdang fled to Zhao, and Zhao’s forces garrisoned Changping. Wang He then attacked Zhao. Zhao sent Lian Po to command its troops. Lian Po fortified his defenses and awaited the Qin assault. Qin repeatedly provoked battle, but the Zhao troops did not emerge. The Zhao king repeatedly reproached Lian Po. Meanwhile, Fan Sui sent agents to Zhao with a thousand *jin* of gold to spread rumors: "What Qin fears most is Zhao Kuo. Lian Po’s army is easily dealt with and is on the verge of surrender." The Zhao king, already angered by Lian Po’s losses and defeats, his passive defense, and the Qin rumors, replaced Lian Po with Zhao Kuo. Upon learning Zhao Kuo would command, Qin appointed Bai Qi as supreme general. Bai Qi slew Zhao Kuo and buried alive four hundred thousand surrendered Zhao soldiers.

Zhang Yu said: When enemy spies come, one may either bind them with generous bribes and lavish gifts, feeding them false words, or feign ignorance, treat them with cold indifference, and show them empty matters, so that when they return to report, it redounds to our advantage. Zhao She’s lavish feasting of Qin spies and the Han army’s feigned alarm before the Chu envoys are examples of this.

Dead spies are those who spread deceptive information abroad, allowing our own spies to learn of it and transmit it to enemy spies. Li Quan said: When truth and deception are indistinguishable, and I know it, I now act through these spies and await the outcome. Here, Quan takes *await* to mean *not transmit*. Du Mu said: *Deceive* means to fabricate. It means that when our spies are among the enemy but unaware of the true situation, we fabricate events, allowing our spies to rely on these false traces to convey sincerity to the enemy and gain their trust. If our actual movements differ from the fabricated traces, the spies cannot escape and will be killed by the enemy—hence, *dead spies*. When King Han sent Li Yiji to persuade Qi to surrender, Qi relaxed its defenses, and Han Xin then launched a surprise attack. Tian Heng, enraged, boiled Li Yiji alive—this case is similar.

Du You said: Fabricate deceptive matters abroad, feigning leaks so that our spies learn of them. When our spies reach the enemy camp and are captured, they will relay the fabricated information to the enemy, who will prepare accordingly. If our actual actions differ, the spies will die. It is also said: When enemy spies come and hear our fabricated information, they take it back, but it is not what we intend. Neither type of spy can discern hidden depths—hence, *dead spies*.

Xiao Shicheng said: Among captured enemy soldiers or our own deserters, those imprisoned for grave crimes may be pardoned, instructed not to leak information, and then feign carelessness, allowing enemy spies to overhear. We then release them to flee, and they will surely return to the enemy, who will trust them. Their mission will be fatal—hence, *dead spies*.

Mei Yaochen said: To deceive the enemy with falsehoods is to invite certain death.

Wang Xi said: Fabricate and leak it so the enemy obtains it; the spies relay our deception to the enemy, and once the matter is decided, they will surely be killed.

He Shi said: For example, when Duke Wu of Zheng wished to attack the Hu, he first married his daughter to the Hu ruler. He then asked his ministers, “I wish to use military force—whom may I attack?” Minister Guan Siqi said, “The Hu.” The duke flew into a rage and executed him, saying, “The Hu are a brotherly state—why do you speak of attacking them?” When the Hu ruler heard this, he took Zheng as a close ally and let down his guard. Zheng then launched a surprise attack and seized the Hu. This was the use of *dead spies*.

Again, Ban Chao mobilized the armies of Yutian and other states to strike the states of Shache and Kucha. He spread word that his forces were too few to prevail and disbanded them. Secretly, he detained a few captives and sent them back to report this. The king of Kucha rejoiced and let down his guard. Ban Chao then stealthily rallied his troops, rushed to Shache, and crushed them, forcing their surrender. This, too, was akin to *dead spies*.

Again, when Li Jing campaigned against the Eastern Turks, the Khagan, believing Tang Jian was still among the Turks and had arranged a marriage alliance, let down his guard. Li Jing then launched a surprise attack and routed them.

Zhang Yu said: To induce the enemy to kill their own worthy and capable men, dispatch doomed agents bearing falsehoods to them. When our spies reach the enemy and are captured, the enemy will take the fabricated information as truth and execute them all. In our dynasty, the Grand Commandant Cao once pardoned a condemned man, had him pose as a monk, and swallow wax pellets to smuggle them into Western Xia. Upon arrival, he was imprisoned. The monk revealed the pellets, and they were confiscated.

Upon opening the letter, it was revealed to be a missive sent to the enemy’s strategist. Enraged, the barbarian lord executed his minister and put the spy-monk to death as well. Such is the principle at work.

Yet the use of *dead spies* is not confined to this single method. At times, one may dispatch our spies to the enemy to propose peace, only to launch an attack upon their arrival—thus dooming the spies to immediate execution. Examples include Li Yi being boiled alive by the King of Qi and Tang Jian being slain by the Turks.

*Living spies* are those who return with intelligence. Li Quan states: "Envoys who come and go." Du Mu says: "Those who travel back and forth to exchange information." For *living spies*, one must select individuals who appear dull-witted outwardly but possess keen insight within, whose bearing may be unremarkable but whose resolve is unyielding, who are swift and vigorous, adept at menial tasks, and capable of enduring hunger, cold, filth, and humiliation. Jia Lin observes: "Though their bodies move in plain sight, their hearts conduct covert observation; they journey forth and return with reports, ever unharmed—hence they are called *living spies*." Du You adds: "Choose those among our ranks who possess talent and wisdom, who can ingratiate themselves with the enemy’s trusted advisors, observe their movements, and discern their affairs. By assessing their actions, we uncover their true intentions; then, returning to report, they are called *living spies*." Mei Yaochen says: "Send those of wit and eloquence to reconnoiter the enemy’s situation and return with intelligence." He Shi notes: "As when Hua Yuan ascended Ziyin’s couch and returned." Another example: During the time when Daxi Wu served as Prefect of Eastern Qin under the Sui, Emperor Shenwu of Qi advanced toward Shayuan. The Supreme Ancestor dispatched Wu to spy on him. Wu, accompanied by three riders, all clad in enemy attire, approached at dusk. Halting a few hundred paces from the camp, they dismounted and listened in secret, learning the military passwords. Then, mounting their horses, they rode through the encampment as if conducting night patrols; whenever they encountered those who violated regulations, they would strike them.

Having thoroughly learned the enemy’s dispositions, he reported them to the Supreme Ancestor, who deeply commended him and subsequently crushed the foe. Zhang Yu says: "Select men of intelligence and ability to observe the enemy’s situation and return with intelligence." Such was the case when Lou Jing discerned the strength of the Xiongnu and reported it to Emperor Gaozu.

Yet the work of living spies is manifold: at times, when one intends to retreat, one may inform the enemy of an impending battle; or when one intends to attack, one may inform the enemy of a retreat. For instance, a Qin envoy warned the Jin army by night: "Let us meet tomorrow." Yu Pian remarked: "The envoy’s darting eyes and unrestrained speech betray his fear of us." Qin indeed fled by night. Another example: Lü Yan attacked Qifu Qiangui and routed him. Qiangui then dispatched a spy to falsely claim he was fleeing east to Chengji. Yan, believing the report, pursued him. Geng Zhi cautioned: "The informant’s upward gaze and shifting countenance reveal a ruse." Yan ignored the warning and was defeated.

Thus, in all military affairs, none are closer than spies. Du Mu says: "Receiving their reports and tracing their steps occurs even within the commander’s private quarters." Du You observes: "If one does not treat them with intimacy and reward them generously, they may turn and serve the enemy, divulging our secrets." Mei Yaochen remarks: "Those who enter the tent to receive commands are most intimately trusted." Wang Xi states: "Bind them as confidants to one’s heart." Zhang Hen says: "Though all in the army are treated with care, only spies are entrusted as if to one’s very heart—this is the deepest intimacy."

No rewards are richer than those for spies. Du You notes: "Bestow lavish rewards upon them, relying on their service." Mei Yaochen says: "Titles, emoluments, gold, and silk—I spare nothing." Wang Xi states: "No military reward surpasses this." Zhang Yu observes: "Without high rank and generous benefits, one cannot employ spies." Chen Ping declared: "I wish to expend forty thousand catties of yellow gold to sow discord between the Chu ruler and his ministers."

No affairs are more secret than those of spies. Du Mu says: "Spoken in one’s ear, heard in another’s." (An alternate reading: "scrutinized.") Du You remarks: "If spycraft is not kept secret, it becomes self-harm." Mei Yaochen states: "If matters are not kept secret, harm will ensue." Wang Xi says: "Only the commander and the spy share the knowledge." Zhang Yu asks: "When only the commander and the spy are privy to the matter, is this not secrecy?"

None but the sagacious and wise can employ spies. Du Mu says: "First assess the spy’s nature—only those of integrity and intelligence may be used. Their demeanor may be thick, their emotions deep, more treacherous than mountains and rivers; none but a sage can fathom them." Mei Yaochen observes: "Discern their sincerity or deceit, distinguish their uprightness or perversity—only then can one employ them." Wang Xi states: "The sagacious perceive all, the wise foresee events." Zhang Yu says: "The sagacious leave no matter unpenetrated; the wise discern the subtlest signs—only then can one engage in spycraft." Some say: "Only the sagacious and wise can truly know others."

None but the benevolent and righteous can command spies. Chen Hao remarks: "The benevolent extend kindness to others; the righteous act with propriety. If a commander can bind spies with benevolence and direct them with righteousness, they will devote themselves to reconnaissance and gladly serve." The Meng clan notes: "As the Grand Duke said: 'The benevolent and righteous attract the worthy.' When the worthy are drawn to them, their spies may be employed." Mei Yaochen states: "Treat them with benevolence, demonstrate righteousness—only then can one command them." Wang Xi says: "Bind their hearts with kindness, rouse their resolve with righteousness—what cannot be achieved by employing righteousness to direct others?" Zhang Yu observes: "Benevolence spares no expense in rewards; righteousness acts decisively without hesitation. Entice them with generous benefits, treat them with utmost sincerity—then spies will exert themselves fully."

None but the subtle and profound can obtain the truth from spies. Du Mu says: "Spies may be swayed by wealth and treasure; if they do not secure the enemy’s true situation but instead bring false reports to fulfill their bargain, one must employ a mind of profound subtlety to discern their veracity or deceit." Du You remarks: "One’s intentions must be secret and unbreachable." Mei Yaochen states: "Guard against spies being turned by the enemy; thus, one’s deliberations must attain the most refined subtlety." Wang Xi says: "Spies must possess a nature and insight of exquisite subtlety to obtain the enemy’s true circumstances." Zhang Yu observes: "When spies report based on advantage or harm, one must employ a mind of profound subtlety and precision to discern their truth or falsehood."

How subtle! How subtle! There is nothing in which spies are not employed. Du Mu says: "Every matter must be known in advance." Mei Yaochen remarks: "The more subtle, the more nothing remains unknown." Wang Xi states: "This is emphasized: one must know the enemy’s situation in every affair." Zhang Yu says: "The more secret, the more no matter—great or small—remains unknown."

If spycraft is exposed before its execution, both the spy and the informant must die. Du Mu says: "If the informant is not luring the spy, they cannot learn the spy’s secrets—killing them is justified." Chen Hao remarks: "If a spy’s mission is exposed before execution and someone reports it, both the informant and the one who heard the report must be killed alongside the spy to silence them and prevent the enemy from learning of it." Mei Yaochen states: "Kill the spy to punish their leak; kill the informant to silence their words." He Shi says: "In military plans of great import, those who leak secrets must be executed; even those who report such leaks must be killed, lest the matter spread among the ranks." Zhang Yu observes: "When spying on the enemy, if the plan is set but not yet executed and someone suddenly reports it, both the spy and the informant must be killed—first to punish the leak, second to silence the witness. When Qin had spies in Zhao but did not employ Lian Po, Qin appointed Bai Qi as commander and ordered the army: 'Whoever reveals that the Lord of Wu’an is to lead shall be beheaded.' This was after the plan was already in motion, yet they still sought to prevent leaks—how much more so before execution?"

Whenever one wishes to strike an army, attack a city, or assassinate a person, one must first ascertain the names of its commander, his attendants, gatekeepers, and retainers, and order one’s spies to gather this intelligence.

Li Quan observes: "Knowing their names makes them easier to capture."

Du Mu states: "Whenever one intends to engage in battle, one must first ascertain whether the enemy’s commanders are wise or foolish, skilled or inept, then respond accordingly based on their abilities. When King Han dispatched Han Xin, Cao Can, and Guan Ying to strike Wei Bao, he asked: 'Who is Wei’s commanding general?' The reply came: 'Bo Zhi.' King Han said: 'His mouth still reeks of milk—he cannot withstand Han Xin.' 'Who commands their cavalry?' 'Feng Jing.' 'He is the son of Ma Wuze, a general of Qin. Though capable, he cannot withstand Guan Ying.' 'Who leads their infantry?' 'Xiang Tuo.' 'He cannot withstand Cao Can. I have nothing to fear.'"

Chen Hao remarks: "This speaks of knowing the names of the enemy’s attendants beforehand. If the enemy sends spies to us, we must dispatch our own spies in return. Without knowing the names of their attendants, we cannot validate the spies’ claims. When Emperor Gao of Han campaigned against Qin and reached Yao Pass, Zhang Liang said: 'I hear their general is but a mere stripling—he may be swayed by profit.' He added: 'Though their general claims to seek peace, his soldiers are unwilling. It would be better to strike while they are lax.' The army then advanced and crushed them."

Moreover, when Hua Yuan of Song climbed Zifan’s bed at night to report on Song’s affliction, had he not long known the names of the gatekeeper, the chamberlain, and the attendants, and first sent spies to guide him, how could he have ascended to his bed?

Du You states: "Guard" refers to those who hold office and bear duty; "herald" means one who announces matters, the master of reports; "gatekeeper" is the one who guards the gate; "chamberlain" is the one who keeps the chamber. One must first know them as kin or old acquaintances, so that in urgency one may call upon them. Thus, one cannot remain ignorant of them, and by this means may also come to know the enemy’s circumstances.

Mei Yaochen remarks: The names of all those before, behind, to the left, and to the right of the enemy must be carefully examined, and our spies must be made to know them beforehand—only then can our spies be deployed.

Wang Xi says: One cannot seek this knowledge only when the matter arises.

Zhang Yu states: The "guard commander" is the general who holds office and bears duty; the "herald" is the officer in charge of guests; the "gatekeeper" is the gate warden; the "chamberlain" is the one who keeps the chamber. Whenever one wishes to strike the enemy’s army, attack their city, or kill their men, one must first know the names of these attendants—only then is it possible. If one wishes to infiltrate their camp, one calls out their names and proceeds. As when Hua Yuan climbed Zifan’s bed at night to report on Song’s affliction, Du Yuanzai’s commentary cites this passage, saying Hua Yuan employed this method to gain access. Furthermore, when Emperor Gao of Han entered Han Xin’s sleeping quarters to seize his seal, he followed the same approach.

One must seek out the enemy’s spies who come to spy on us, then entice them with profit, guide them, and lodge them.

Du You says: "Lodge" means to provide residence.

Let our agents bestow great profit upon them, then meet and lodge them, so they may be made to distort their reports. Thus, the reverse spy may be employed.

Cao Cao says: "Lodge" means to provide residence.

Du Mu states: When enemy spies come, one must lure them with generous profit and house them, so they may serve as our reverse spies.

Du You says: Thus, one may seize the enemy’s spies and employ them.

Mei Yaochen says: One must thoroughly investigate and learn of the enemy’s spies who come, then entice them with profit, lead them, and lodge them—only then can they serve as our reverse spies.

Wang Xi says: This refers to detaining enemy spies to inquire into their circumstances. One must lodge them, engage in subtle persuasion, express deep affection, then tempt them with great profit and threaten them with severe punishment. Unless they are utterly loyal to their lord and king, they will all be employed by us.

Zhang Yu says: "Seek" means to search. One searches for enemy spies who come to observe us, then lures and guides them with generous profit and lodges them, so they may serve as our reverse spies. "Lodging them" refers to detaining their envoys. Once detained for a long time, their discussions will be extensive, and we may thereby discern the enemy’s circumstances. The following passage speaks of the four kinds of spies all being known through reverse spies—without detaining them for a long time and exhaustively discussing matters, how could one know everything? By this means, one comes to know them, and thus the local and inward spies may be employed.

Du Mu says: If enemy spies can be guided with profit and made to serve as our reverse spies, then by this logic, generous profit may also be used to employ local and inward spies. This shows that employing spies cannot be done without profit. Thus, the earlier passage states: "After years of stalemate, contending for victory in a single day, yet begrudging ranks, emoluments, and a hundred pieces of gold, remaining ignorant of the enemy’s circumstances—this is the height of inhumanity." The following passages all observe this principle.

Chen Hao says: This is an explication of the text.

When enemy spies are sent, entice them with profit, lure them to stay in our lodgings, and thereby obtain the enemy’s intelligence. Through this, the inward and local spies may be employed as reverse spies to deceive and direct them.

Du You says: By using enemy reverse spies, one comes to know the enemy’s circumstances, and thus all local spies may be employed.

Mei Yaochen says: Those among the enemy’s people who may be employed, and those among their officials who may be used, are all known through reverse spies.

Zhang Yu says: Through reverse spies, one learns of those among the enemy’s local people who are greedy for profit, and those among their officials who have vulnerabilities, and may then lure and employ them.

Through this knowledge, dead spies may be sent with deceptive information to report to the enemy.

Zhang Yu says: Through reverse spies, one learns of the enemy’s vulnerabilities that may be deceived, and thus sends dead spies to report to them.

Through this knowledge, living spies may be sent to return as scheduled.

Du Mu says: They may be sent to come and go as planned.

Chen Hao says: This speaks of how the five types of spies form a cyclical dependence, with only living spies able to return as scheduled.

Du You says: By learning of the enemy’s circumstances through deceptive information, living spies may be sent back and forth to ascertain the enemy’s core intentions.

Mei Yaochen says: When sending our spies to deceive the enemy with false reports, one must rely on reverse spies to know what the enemy may be deceived about. Living spies, who probe the enemy’s circumstances through profit and harm, must also rely on reverse spies to understand their vulnerabilities, so they may go forth, obtain the truth, and return as scheduled.

Zhang Yu says: Through reverse spies, one learns the enemy’s circumstances, and thus living spies may come and go as scheduled.

The ruler must be thoroughly versed in the affairs of the five types of spies.

Li Quan says: Sunzi emphasizes the five types of spies, and the ruler must be intimately familiar with them.

This knowledge depends entirely on reverse spies, and thus reverse spies must be treated with the utmost generosity.

Du Mu says: Local, inward, dead, and living spies—all four types—are employed only after learning the enemy’s circumstances through reverse spies. Thus, reverse spies are the most critical and must not be treated stingily.

Du You says: The ruler must understand the use of the five types of spies, granting them generous ranks and abundant wealth. Reverse spies, being the foundation of the five, are essential to the enterprise and must therefore be treated with the greatest generosity.

Mei Yaochen says: The five types of spies all originate from reverse spies, and thus they must be treated with the utmost generosity.

Zhang Yu says: The ruler must employ the five types of spies to learn the enemy’s circumstances. Since all five depend on reverse spies, how can reverse spies not be treated with the greatest generosity?

In the rise of the Yin, Yi Zhi was in Xia.

Cao Cao says: Yi Zhi is Yi Yin.

In the rise of the Zhou, Lü Ya was in Yin.

Cao Cao says: Lü Ya is the Grand Duke.

Mei Yaochen says: Yi Yin and Lü Ya did not betray their states. Xia could not employ Yi Yin, but Yin could; Yin could not use Lü Ya, but Zhou could. Their achievement of great deeds was for the sake of the people.

He Shi says: Yi and Lü were sages paired in virtue—how could they be mere spies? Sunzi invokes them to say that employing spies requires those of the highest wisdom, like Yi Yin and Lü Ya, who possessed such talent and insight. This is merely an expression of their importance.

Zhang Yu says: Yi Yin was a minister of Xia who later joined Yin; Lü Wang was a minister of Yin who later joined Zhou. Yi Yin and Lü Wang aided Tang and Wu in unifying the realm with arms, acting in accord with Heaven and responding to the people. They were not like Bo Zhouli, who fled to Chu; Miao Guihuang, who went to Jin; Hu Yong, who served in Wu; or Shi Hui, who resided in Qin.

Thus, only enlightened rulers and worthy generals, who employ those of the highest wisdom as spies, are certain to achieve great success. This is the essence of warfare, upon which the Three Armies rely for their movements.

Li Quan says: Sunzi discusses warfare beginning with calculations and ending with spies, for he does not take attack as primary. How can generals not be cautious in this?

Du Mu says: Without knowing the enemy’s circumstances, the army cannot move. To know the enemy’s circumstances, one must rely on spies. Thus it is said: the Three Armies rely on them for their movements.

Li Jing says: Victory in battle does not depend on Heaven or Earth but on leveraging people to achieve it. Reviewing the use of spies by the ancients, their methods were manifold: some spied on the enemy’s ruler, some on their kin, some on their worthy officials, some on their capable ministers, some on their allies, some on their neighboring states, some on their courtiers, and some on their strategists. Thus, Zigong, Shi Liao, Chen Zhen, Su Qin, Zhang Yi, and Fan Sui all succeeded by these means.

Moreover, the methods of spying are fivefold: one may employ the enemy’s locals to secretly observe and report with fabricated words; one may use their officials to leak false information and issue deceptive proclamations; one may intercept the enemy’s envoys, falsify their messages, and send them back; one may select the wise and capable to observe the enemy’s inclinations and strengths, then return to report; or one may feign leniency toward criminals, subtly reveal false plans, and let them flee to report. All five methods require utmost secrecy, reinforced with generous rewards, and guarded with the strictest confidentiality before they can be executed.

If the enemy has a favored minister entrusted with their innermost thoughts, one should send spies to present them with rare treasures, indulge their desires, and subtly lead them astray. If the enemy has a powerful minister who has fallen from favor and is dissatisfied, one should entice them with great profit, feign close friendship, and extract their true intentions to manipulate them. If the enemy has trusted courtiers who are boastful, exaggerating, and fond of discussing advantages and disadvantages, one should send spies to flatter them, bestow lavish gifts, discern their vulnerabilities, and turn them into reverse spies. If the enemy sends envoys to us, we should delay their stay, arrange for our people to live with them, feign earnest hospitality, and pretend intimacy, offering comfort and abundant delicacies day and night, observing their words and expressions to discern their intentions.

Still, have the envoy reside alone with our chosen companion day and night, and dispatch sharp-eared agents to secretly listen from behind double walls. As the envoy’s stay grows prolonged, fearing reproach from his superiors, he will inevitably discuss confidential matters in private. Thus, we learn his plans and send him back to serve our purposes.

Moreover, when we employ spies to deceive others, others likewise employ spies to deceive us. We send forth secrets, and they return with secrets. One must therefore scrutinize matters alone in the heart and cross-examine them in practice—only then will nothing be lost.

If the enemy sends agents to probe our strengths and weaknesses, observe our movements, and discern our plans to carry out their schemes, we should feign unawareness, provide them lodging, and treat them to fine meals. Subtly feed them false information, show them fabricated evidence, and arrange false appointments. Whatever we require, they will fail to obtain—thus, we exploit their spies to turn them into our own. If they take our falsehoods as truth, we may seize the advantage and achieve our aims.

Water can carry a boat, yet it can also capsize it; spies can ensure success, yet they can also bring ruin. If one serves one’s lord with hair bound in devotion, standing upright at court, exhausting loyalty to fulfill duty, and exhausting sincerity to uphold trust—never resorting to deceit for self-preservation nor bending principles for profit—even with skilled spies at hand, how could they be used?

Chen Hao said: When Bo Zhouli of Jin fled to Chu and Miao Benhuang of Chu fled to Jin, and the two states clashed at Yanling, Miao Benhuang stood beside the Marquis of Jin while Bo Zhouli attended the King of Chu. Each spoke of the strengths and weaknesses of their former homeland. Yet Jin’s victory and Chu’s defeat—what was the reason? The two men differed in merit. Thus, in the art of employing spies and discerning the enemy’s intentions, must one not carefully select the right person and thoroughly examine their words?

Hence, the preceding text states: *Only the sagely and wise can employ spies.* The sagely and wise understand others, and others naturally rally to them. When the worthy receive recognition, they exert themselves wholeheartedly in service. Without sagacity or wisdom, suspicion and jealousy arise. If the public way is not opened and benevolence and righteousness are not practiced, then righteous scholars and worthy men will harbor resentment. Heaven will not bless such a ruler, and though unseen, spirits exist. Even without human-induced misfortune, one may face hidden calamity—how could the wisest be willing to serve such a master?

Thus, the preceding text states: *Only the benevolent and righteous can employ spies.* The sagely kings Tang and Wu were right to employ Yi and Lü. With Yi and Lü in service, success was assured. When sage and worthy meet, when times align in harmony, when the Way accords with heaven and earth, their achievements resound across the world. Yet when they were but farmers in the fields or old fishermen by the Wei River, who among them did not long for a true understanding?

Jia Lin said: A military without the five types of spies is like a person without ears or eyes.
Wang Xi said: Without knowing the enemy’s situation, one cannot act.
Zhang Yu said: The foundation of waging war lies in knowing the enemy’s situation—hence, this is the essence of warfare. Without knowing the enemy’s situation, the army cannot advance. Thus, the Three Armies rely on this to move.

Yet this chapter appears at the end of the thirteen because the use of spies is not a constant in warfare. Matters such as planning, battle, attack, formation, momentum, and emptiness or fullness are employed when the army is in motion. As for fire attacks and spies, they are used only when the occasion arises.

*Commentary on Sunzi, Scroll Thirteen, concludes.*

*Sunzi Preface by Emperor Wu of Wei*

Cao Cao heard that in high antiquity, the bow and arrow brought advantage. The *Analects* says, "Sufficient arms," the *Book of Documents* in its Eight Policies speaks of "the army," and the *Book of Changes* says, "The army’s correctness—an elder’s auspiciousness." The *Book of Songs* says, "The king’s majesty blazed forth; he then marshaled his hosts." The Yellow Emperor, Tang, and Wu all employed shields and battle-axes to save their generations. The *Methods of the Sima* states: "If men kill men, it is permissible to kill them." Those who rely on force perish; those who rely on culture die—such were Fuchai and the Prince of Yan. The sage’s use of arms is to restrain them and act only when the time is right, employing them only when unavoidable.

I have examined many works on military strategy and battle plans, and what Sun Wu composed is profound indeed. His careful calculations and weighty deployments, his clear designs and deep strategies, cannot be gainsaid. Yet the world has not deeply understood or expounded his teachings. Moreover, his text is rich and abundant, and those who transmit it have lost its essential meaning. Thus, I have compiled this brief commentary.

**Biography of Sunzi**
Sunzi Wu was a man of Qi. He presented his military methods to King Helü of Wu. Helü said: "I have read all thirteen of your scrolls. May I conduct a small test to drill the troops?" He replied: "You may." Helü said: "May I test them with women?" He said: "You may." Thereupon, the king granted permission.

The king sent forth palace beauties, numbering one hundred and eighty. Sunzi divided them into two companies, appointing the king’s two favored concubines as captains, each holding a halberd. He commanded them: "Do you know your heart and your left and right hands and back?" The women replied: "We know them." Sunzi said: "When I say 'forward,' look to your heart; 'left,' to your left hand; 'right,' to your right hand; 'back,' to your back." The women said: "Understood." Having set the rules, he arrayed the executioner’s axes and repeated the orders three and five times. Then he beat the drum for a right turn, and the women burst into laughter. Sunzi said: "If the rules are unclear and the orders not well understood, it is the commander’s fault." Again he repeated the orders three and five times, then beat the drum for a left turn, and the women laughed once more. Sunzi said: "If the rules are unclear and the orders not well understood, it is the commander’s fault. But if they are clear and still not followed, it is the officers’ and soldiers’ fault." He then ordered the two captains to be beheaded. From his terrace, the king watched, and seeing his beloved concubines about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed. He hastily sent a messenger with the command: "I have already seen that the general knows how to command troops. Without these two concubines, I cannot savor my food. I beg you not to execute them." Sunzi replied: "Your servant has already received the commission to command. Once in command, there are orders from the sovereign that must not be obeyed." He then beheaded the two captains and paraded their bodies before the troops, appointing the next in line as captains.

Thereupon, Sunzi again sounded the drum, and the women moved left and right, advanced and retreated, kneeling and rising—all in perfect accordance with the rules and standards, none daring to utter a sound. Sunzi then sent a messenger to report to the king: "The troops are now well-ordered. Your Majesty may descend to inspect them. Whatever task you assign, even if it be to march through fire or water, they shall accomplish it." The King of Wu said: "Let the general rest and return to his quarters. I do not wish to descend and observe." Sunzi replied: "The king merely delights in my words but cannot employ their substance."

Thereafter, King Helü recognized Sunzi’s ability to command troops and ultimately appointed him as general. In the west, he crushed the mighty state of Chu and entered Ying; in the north, he overawed Qi and made his name resound among the feudal lords—Sunzi’s strength was instrumental in these achievements.

After Sun Wu’s death, the *Yuejueshu* records: "Outside the Wu County’s Witch Gate lies a great mound, the tomb of Sun Wu, located ten *li* from the county." Over a hundred years later, Sun Bin was born. Bin was born between the regions of A and Juan, and he too was a descendant of Sun Wu’s lineage.

Sun Bin once studied military strategy alongside Pang Juan. After Pang Juan entered the service of Wei and became a general under King Hui, he believed his own ability fell short of Sun Bin’s. Secretly, he summoned Sun Bin. When Bin arrived, Pang Juan, fearing his superiority, grew jealous and had him punished by law—his kneecaps were cut off, and he was branded, intending to conceal him from sight.

When a Qi envoy traveled to Liang, Sun Bin, though a convict, secretly met him and persuaded him. The envoy, deeming him extraordinary, covertly carried him back to Qi. The Qi general Tian Ji treated him with kindness and hospitality.

Tian Ji often raced chariots with the Qi princes, wagering heavily. Sunzi observed that their horses’ speeds were not vastly different, with only upper, middle, and lower tiers of quality. Thereupon, he said to Tian Ji: "Simply place your highest wager, and I shall ensure your victory." Tian Ji trusted him and bet a thousand gold with the king and the princes. As they prepared to race, Sunzi said: "Now, pit your worst team against their best, your best against their middle, and your middle against their worst." After all three races, Tian Ji lost once but won twice, ultimately securing the king’s thousand gold.

Thereupon, Tian Ji recommended Sunzi to King Wei. The king questioned him on military strategy and ultimately took him as his teacher.

Later, when Wei attacked Zhao, Zhao urgently sought aid from Qi. King Wei of Qi wished to appoint Sun Bin as commander, but Bin declined, saying: "One who bears the marks of punishment is unfit." Thus, Tian Ji was made general, while Sunzi served as advisor, seated in a covered chariot to devise strategies.

Tian Ji intended to lead the army directly to Zhao, but Sunzi said: "To untangle a snarl, one does not grasp the coils; to break up a brawl, one does not strike with fists. Strike at the enemy’s vital points and exploit their vulnerabilities—then the situation will resolve itself. Now, as Liang and Zhao attack each other, their light troops and elite soldiers will be exhausted abroad, while the old and weak languish at home. You would do better to swiftly march on Daliang, seize its thoroughfares, and strike where they are exposed. They will surely abandon Zhao to save themselves. Thus, in one move, we lift Zhao’s siege and exhaust Wei."

Tian Ji followed his advice. Wei indeed abandoned Handan and engaged Qi at Guiling, where the Liang forces were utterly routed.

Fifteen years later, Wei and Zhao attacked Han, and Han urgently appealed to Qi for help. Qi dispatched Tian Ji to lead the army, who marched straight for Daliang. When the Wei general Pang Juan heard this, he abandoned Han and returned. By then, the Qi army had already passed westward.

Sunzi said to Tian Ji: "The soldiers of the Three Jin have long been fierce and brave, scorning Qi as cowardly. A skilled commander leverages their momentum and guides it to advantage. As the *Art of War* states: 'One who marches a hundred *li* to seize an advantage will stumble and lose his commander; one who marches fifty *li* will arrive with only half his army.'" He then instructed the Qi army to construct cooking pits for 100,000 men on the first day, 50,000 on the next, and 20,000 on the third.

Pang Juan, after three days’ march, rejoiced greatly: "I knew the Qi troops were cowardly! After entering our land for three days, over half their soldiers have already deserted!" He abandoned his infantry and, with his light cavalry, pursued them at double speed.

Sunzi calculated their progress and determined they would reach Maling by dusk. The road at Maling was narrow, flanked by rugged terrain ideal for an ambush. He had a large tree stripped of bark and inscribed: "Pang Juan shall die beneath this tree." He then ordered 10,000 Qi crossbowmen to lie in wait along the road, awaiting a signal—when they saw a torch raised at dusk, they were to loose their arrows in unison.

Pang Juan arrived at the stripped tree that night. Seeing the inscription, he lit a torch to read it. Before he could finish, the Qi crossbowmen unleashed a volley. The Wei army descended into chaos, scattering in disarray. Pang Juan, realizing his schemes had failed and his army was defeated, took his own life, saying: "Thus I have made the wretch’s name!" Qi seized the opportunity to crush the remaining Wei forces, capturing the Wei crown prince Shen and returning in triumph.

Sun Bin’s fame resounded throughout the world, and his military strategies were transmitted to later generations.
