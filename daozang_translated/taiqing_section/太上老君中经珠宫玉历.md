### **The Central Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao, Volume One**

#### **First Immortal**
The Supreme Great One is the father of the Dao, preceding heaven and earth. He resides above the Nine Heavens, within the Great Clarity, beyond the Eight Darknesses, and within the subtlest of realms. I know not his name—he is simply the Primordial Black. His divine form has the head of a crow and the body of a man, resembling a rooster adorned with the five colors of the phoenix. He wears a pearl robe of dark yellow. He dwells precisely above the crown of the adept’s head, nine feet from the body, ever within purple clouds beneath a canopy of blossoming radiance. When the adept beholds him, he speaks: *"Supreme Great One, Lord of the Dao, your distant descendant, the humble adept Wang Jia, cultivates the Dao with pure devotion. I wish to attain longevity."*

#### **Second Immortal**
The Boundless Supreme Primordial Lord is the Lord of the Dao. His single body has nine heads, or he transforms into nine persons, each clad in a five-colored pearl robe and crowned with a Nine-Virtue coronet. He is the son of the Supreme Great One—yet not truly his son, for he is the spontaneous Primordial Black. He dwells above the adept’s head within purple clouds beneath the blossoming canopy. When the adept beholds him, he speaks: *"August Heavenly Thearch, Supreme Lord of the Dao, your distant descendant, the humble adept Wang Jia, cultivates the Dao and wishes for longevity. Nurture me, rear me, protect me, shield me. May venomous creatures and fierce beasts prostrate before me, ensuring all I undertake succeeds and all I seek is attained."*

In the land of Great Clarity, within the village of Emptiness, there is one named Zhu Yu, styled Guang, called Imperial Minister. He is the star within the Purple Tenuity and the Curved Array of the Supreme Subtlety, known as the Heavenly Thearch Radiant-Soul Treasure. The adept should constantly contemplate him, never forgetting. Humans also possess him, residing between the brows, connecting to the Mud-Pellet Palace, its blackness ascending to join with heaven.

#### **Third Immortal**
The Eastern King Father is the Primordial Black of the Azure Yang, the progenitor of the ten thousand spirits. He wears a five-colored pearl robe and a three-seam coronet—some say a coronet of three seams. Above him, the Great Clarity’s clouds shine in five colors. He governs the eastern direction and dwells below on Mount Penglai. His surname is Non-Action, his style is Lord Fresh—some say Lord Liberation. Humans also possess him, residing at the crown of the head. To his left is Wang Ziqiao, to his right is Red Pine Master. He governs within the left eye and plays upon the head. His essence and qi ascend to become the sun, named Fuxi.

In the land of Great Clarity, within the village of Eastern Brightness.

The Western Queen Mother, styled Yanchang, manifests in the eyes as the sun and moon. The left eye is the sun, the right eye the moon. Within the eyes, the youth is named Yingming. The King Father resides in the left eye, the Queen Mother in the right, and the youth in the center—both eyes are equal. When the adept seeks to cultivate perfection, they must contemplate the Eastern King Father and Western Queen Mother standing together upon the head, uniting the essence and radiance of the sun and moon. Then, descending, they contemplate the Purple Chamber, the Great One, the Crimson Palace, the Yellow Court, the Great Abyss, and the Cinnabar Field. Circulating true qi five cycles through the abdomen, then twelve cycles throughout the body. When the Dao is complete, halt at the Vermilion Bird Gate. The Gate is the two breasts. The left breast is named Lord A, the right breast is named Nie Zhong. Below the breasts lies the Jade Gate, where the Heavenly Dog and Heavenly Rooster reside, governing the crowing and barking of dawn and night.

#### **Fourth Immortal**
The Western Queen Mother is the primordial qi of the Great Yin. Her surname is Spontaneity, her style is Lord Thought. Below, she governs Mount Kunlun, its ninefold golden walls enveloped in five-colored auspicious qi, towering ten thousand *zhang* high. Above, she governs the Northern Dipper, beneath the canopy of the blossoming purple chamber and the Northern Asterism. Humans also possess her, residing within the right eye. Her surname is Great Yin, her name is Mysterious Radiance, her style is Yan Jade. Only when the King Father and Queen Mother guard the two eyes can one walk, see clearly, discern beauty and ugliness, and command the myriad spirits below. Like a mother cherishing her child, the child also cherishes the mother. When essence and qi harmonize, one endures for ten thousand generations.

The two breasts of a person are the essence and qi of the ten thousand spirits, the fluids of yin and yang. Below the left breast is the sun, below the right breast is the moon—the abodes of the King Father and Queen Mother. Above, they govern within the eyes, play upon the head, and rest below the breasts, lodging in the Crimson Palace and Purple Chamber. These are the qi of yin and yang.

#### **Fifth Immortal**
The Lord of the Dao is the One, the August Heavenly Thearch, the Northern Asterism of the Central Ultimate, the central star. He resides above the Nine Heavens, upon a peak ten thousand *zhang* high, within the Purple Chamber of the Great Abyss. He wears a five-colored robe and a Nine-Virtue coronet. Above him, the primordial qi of the Great Clarity shines in five-colored clouds beneath a ninefold blossoming canopy. Lord Lao and the Great Harmony attend him to left and right. His surname is Regulating August, his name is Supreme August Virtue, his style is Han Chang.

Humans also possess him, residing within the Purple Chamber beneath the blossoming canopy. In the land of Primordial Nobility, within the village of Peaceful Joy, his surname is Lingyang, his style is Ziming. His body is yellow, nine *fen* in length, clad in a five-colored pearl robe and a Nine-Virtue coronet. When contemplated, he is three *cun* tall, standing within the Purple Chamber beneath the blossoming canopy. His consort is the Great Yin Mysterious Radiance Jade Maiden, who wears a dark yellow five-colored pearl robe. She is nine *fen* in length, and when contemplated, she is also three *cun* tall. She resides in the Grand Simplicity Palace, nurturing the Perfected One’s cinnabar child. Gradually, it grows until it matches one’s own body. If one can visualize and converse with it, it will summon one to ascend and pay homage to the Lord of the Dao.

The Lord of the Dao is Unity. He rides a chariot of cloud-qi, pearls, and jade, drawn by nine horses of the Nine Ultimates, and at times harnesses six dragons to govern the world. You should constantly visualize Him, and on the eight solar terms, the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, at dusk, or at midnight, pray thus: "O Radiant Numinous Node, Perfected One Wang Jia wishes for longevity. May the Great Mystery’s Unity guard my body and form, and may the lords and marquises of my five viscera enjoy eternal peace and tranquility."

The Sixth Immortal:
The Venerable Lord is the celestial hun-soul, the Lord of Spontaneity, who constantly attends the Lord of the Dao on the left. Thus, we nine are the Nine-Headed Lords, and I am the foremost, serving as the King Father, while the others hold no such office. Within humans, He resides in the Golden Mansion Village, Small Hut Hamlet, surnamed Pi, named Ziming, styled Lanlan. He wears a blue-green robe, stands nine *fen* tall, holds a mushroom of immortality, and bears a green banner, attending the Lord of the Dao on the left, accompanied by the immortal Zhong Chengzi. When visualized, He is three *cun* tall, ever present to one’s left, equal in stature to one’s own body. His consort is the Plain Maiden, who wears a yellow robe and stands nine *fen* tall. When visualized, she is also three *cun* tall.

The Seventh Immortal:
The Supreme Harmony is the celestial po-soul, the Lord of Spontaneity, who constantly attends the Lord of the Dao on the right. Within humans, He resides in Crow Terrace Village, surnamed Master Jiaoli, styled Weiwei. He wears a white robe, stands nine *fen* tall, wields a golden sword, and holds a white whetstone, attending the Lord of the Dao on the right, accompanied by the immortal Qu Wenzi. When visualized, He is also three *cun* tall, ever present to one’s right in rising, sitting, walking, or halting. His consort is the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist, who wears a blue-green robe and stands nine *fen* tall. When visualized, she is also three *cun* tall.

The Eighth Immortal:
The Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace is the spirit of the brain, born within it, the root of kidney essence and heart essence. He dwells in Flowery Canopy Village, Penglai Hamlet, and is the South Pole Elder, the Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace. His style is Yuanxian. He wears a five-colored pearl robe and stands nine *fen* tall, residing within the brain atop one’s head, appearing before the brain’s gate in the field of vision. When visualized, He is nine *fen* tall, yet also three *cun*. Upon seeing Him, one should say: "O South Pole Elder, grant me, so-and-so, longevity, that I may traverse east, west, south, and north, ascend to heaven and enter the earth, never to perish, decay, or lose my way. Inscribe my name in the register of the living, that I may attend the Lord of the Dao and endure as long as heaven and earth."

The Ninth Immortal:
The South Pole is Unity, the foremost of immortals, the Supreme Supreme Great One, the celestial Marquis-King and Grand Commandant. He governs all calamities and changes, determining the fortunes and misfortunes of nations. Above, He is the Star of Mars; below, He presides over Huo Mountain.

Within the human body, He resides in the Longhao precinct, in the central chamber of the Crimson Palace. His surname is Li, given name Shang, also named Chang, and courtesy name Zengzi. He wears crimson robes, nine *fen* in length; when visualized, He is also three *cun* tall, dwelling within the heart. His consort is a Jade Maiden, clad in white robes, nine *fen* in length; when visualized, She is also three *cun* tall. Constantly visualize within the heart a canopied parasol, beneath which stands a figure wearing a vermilion cap of piled silk, crimson ceremonial robes, and named the Celestial Marquis. He is girded with a jade belt and purple sash, bearing a gold seal with dark-yellow cords. Should one perceive Him, one’s vision will penetrate the eight directions, and after a thousand days, one will ascend as an immortal. At the proper time, visualize the youth within the brain—this is the sign of His presence.

The Tenth Immortal:
The Sun and Moon are the Celestial Minister of Education and Minister of Works. They oversee the transgressions of the Son of Heaven and the sovereigns of men, while the Great White Star and the Chronographic Star govern below at Huayin and Mount Heng. Within the human body, they correspond to the two kidneys. The left kidney is male, clad in black robes; the right kidney is female, clad in white robes, each nine *fen* in length; when visualized, they are also three *cun* tall. They are the essence of the Sun and Moon, the blackness of the Void and Nothingness, the root of man. They reside within the eyes, and thus the left eye is the Minister of Education, the right eye the Minister of Works. Each kidney harbors three persons, making six in total: on the left, the Controller of Destinies and the Commandant of Attendants; on the right, the Recorder and the Minister of Justice. They record human transgressions and memorialize the August Heavenly Thearch and the Supreme Lord of the Dao. Constantly preserve this visualization to expunge one’s name from the register of death and inscribe it in the ledger of longevity. They belong to the Taichu precinct, the Xuanming ward. The Recorder and the Six Ding Jade Maidens, whose courtesy name is Daoming, all reside upon the divine tortoise, riding a chariot of purple and black clouds, drawn by a pair of carp, and named Taichengzi. The Dark Mother, the Mother of the Dao, dwells at the center, the teacher of the body. She governs the nurturing of all spirits within the body, seated beneath a five-colored cloud-canopied parasol, wearing the luminous pearl of the Great White Star and the bright moon, whose radiance illuminates the entire body. Regularly visualize Her on the nights of the eight solar terms, and recite the following prayer:

"O Controllers of Destinies and Recorders, Six Ding Jade Maidens, expunge my name from the register of death and inscribe it anew in the jade ledger of longevity."

The Eleventh Immortal:
The Central Pole Yellow Elder is the Lord of the Dipper within the True Person’s palace, the celestial Marquis-King, who presides over the Palace of the Empress and the Plain Maiden. Within the human body, He is also present. The Yellow Court True Person is the father and mother of the Dao, the source of the Red Child, the very self of one’s being. The Empress is the Great Yin Dark Radiance Jade Maiden, the mother of the Dao, situated at the center of the Dipper above the spleen. She wears robes of five-colored pearls, seated beneath a canopied parasol of yellow clouds, and governs the nourishment of the Red Child. Constantly visualize beneath the two breasts the Sun and Moon, within which reside the yellow essence and the red-black *qi*. These enter the Crimson Palace and then proceed into the Purple Chamber of the Yellow Court, filling the Great Granary to abundance. The Red Child sits facing south within the stomach duct, partaking of the yellow essence and red *qi*, thereby becoming sated. All illnesses depart, and the myriad calamities cannot assail. Constantly preserve this visualization, and above, one will become a True Person.

Thus it is said: "Emerging together yet bearing different names." There is a commentary that states: "The sun and moon emerge together yet bear different names."

In the Great Simplicity Village, within the Central Origin Ward, resides the Central Yellow True Person, styled Yellow Skirt Master, who presides over grain avoidance and causes one’s spirit to become luminous, now small, now great. At cock’s crow and mealtime, recite the incantation: *"Yellow Skirt Master, Yellow Skirt Master, the Yellow Court True Person resides within me. Procure for me medicinal wine, pine-dried meat, polished grain, and millet cakes—all that may be eaten or drunk—so that they arrive at once."* After reciting, close your eyes for a moment, shut your mouth, and swallow thirty-four times; you will then be sated.

**The Twelfth Immortal**
I am the child of the Dao. This is not unique to me; all people possess it. It resides within the Great Granary of the stomach duct, seated facing south upon a pearl-and-jade bed, covered by a canopy of yellow clouds, and clad in robes of five-colored pearls. The mother stands to its upper right, embracing and nourishing it, while the father stands to its upper left, instructing and protecting it. Thus, the father is called Lingyang, styled Ziming; the mother is called Great Yin, styled Dark Radiance Jade Maiden. One’s own body is the Primordial Yang, styled Zidan. The True Person, styled Zhonghuang, is the teacher of my true self. He constantly imparts the Dao of immortality and long life, ever attending at my left and right, resting in the Great Granary within the spleen, sharing guard duty with Yellow Skirt Master to serve the divine and procure what is due. Thus, constantly visualize the True Person Zidan seated facing south within the stomach duct, consuming yellow essence and red *qi*, drinking from the sweet spring. The Primordial Yang Child Zidan is nine *fen* in height; visualize him to be equal in size to your own body. Nurtured by father and mother, he attains transcendence. Constantly envision your own body as a youth within the stomach duct, clad in five-colored robes, seated upon a pearl-and-jade bed, beneath a canopy of yellow clouds and red *qi*, partaking of golden jade elixirs, consuming divine cinnabar and sacred herbs, drinking from the sweet spring, riding a chariot of yellow clouds and five-colored pearls, drawn by twelve flying dragons, twenty-four white tigers, and thirty-six vermilion crows. After nine years of such visualization, you will ascend upon clouds to depart the world and ascend to pay homage to the Dao Lord. The officials of the five directions, numbering thirty-six thousand spirits in all, will elevate your entire clan to the immortal Dao, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

At each of the four seasons, make offerings to your ancestors. On the *hai* day of the first month at cock’s crow, make offerings at the suburban altars and ancestral temples; on the *hai* day of the second month, make offerings to the altars of soil and grain, the Earl of Wind, and the Master of Rain. On the *shen* and *mao* days of the fourth and fifth months, the *si* and *wu* days of the seventh and eighth months, and the *mao* and *xu* days of the tenth and eleventh months, perform these rites. In the intercalary months, do not make offerings, but instead dissolve the Earth Lord and expel the concealed corpse. The suburban altar is within the brain’s gate at the crown of the head; the ancestral temple is upon the bone at the back of the skull. The soil altar is at the left end of the spleen; the grain altar is at the end of the large intestine. The Earl of Wind resides at the Eight Gates. The Eight Gates are located beside the navel, within the Five Cities and Twelve Towers. The Master of Rain is at the end of the small intestine. The four streams of cloud-*qi* emerge from Kunlun; the Weak Water is within the bladder. The divine kitchens of all the spirits are within the Great Granary. Call upon the spirits by name in order, and do not forget.

**The Thirteenth Immortal**
The Jade Pivot is the Lord of the Northern Dipper, the sovereign of heaven. He governs the twelve thousand spirits and holds the register of human lives. All people possess him within the navel as the Great One Lord, the sovereign of the human body. The Pillar of Heaven, Grand General, is a specially advanced marquis who governs the twelve thousand spirits within the body.

In the Central Ultimate Village, Jade Pivot Ward, his surname is Wang, given name Yang, styled Lingzi. He wears a three-seamed cap and a single-layered crimson robe, nine *fen* in length; when visualized, he is three *cun* tall, his size equal to one’s own body. The Great One Lord has eight attendants, the spirits of the Eight Trigrams. The Great One resides at the center, presiding over the review of all spirits, examining and verifying their records to prevent their escape. The eight attendants report to the Great One on the eight seasonal nodes. Thus, the navel is called the Mansion of the Great Abyss, the village of the capital.

Constantly on the autumnal equinox, review this calculation. Bathe and fast, and for three days prior, do not leave the chamber. Call upon him thrice daily for three days, nine times in all. By doing so, none of the spirits may escape, your name will be recorded among the transcendent immortals, and you will be confirmed as a True Person. Thus, the Great One may not rashly ascend to report; if the report is inauspicious, misfortune will follow, but this concerns only the eight attendants.

On the days of the eight seasonal nodes, the last day of the month, the new moon, the first and last quarters, and the full moon, tap the navel thirty-four times with the right hand and stroke the heart forty-nine times with the left hand, reciting: *"Heavenly Numinous Splendor True Person, so-and-so wishes to attain long life. May the Great Mysterious True One guard so-and-so’s body. May the lords of the five viscera and all the marquises remain peaceful. Recite the primary incantation seven times, the secondary twenty times."* The next morning at dawn, recite again: *"Great One Lord of the Northern Culmen, I respectfully beseech all the spirits to constantly guard and keep my hun and po souls peaceful, never departing from so-and-so’s body."* This is what is meant by restraining the hun and controlling the po.

On the last day of the twelfth month at the hour of *ren ding*, face the moon’s position in an empty chamber, bow twice, sit upright, close your eyes, and recite: *"Lords of the five viscera, spirits of the hun and po, so-and-so seeks long life. Do not depart from the body; constantly unite with the form to become one with it."* Men and women each recite this three times. On the days of the eight seasonal nodes, within the chamber, face the Jade Pond, bow twice, close your eyes, and recite: *"Great Dao, Vast Ford, Vast Ford, on the days of the celestial nodes, the hun and po of the myriad beings all ascend to the heavens. The True Person’s body unites with the spirit. So-and-so desires long life, alone in an empty chamber, not listed in the register of the dead."* Men and women each recite this three times.

On the last day of the twelfth month, from the night’s vigil through dawn to morning, within the chamber, face the *yin* direction, bow twice, and recite: *"Vast Ford, Vast Ford, so-and-so has received the grace of the Great Dao, the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Summit. I wish to restore the years of so-and-so’s past life. May the hun and po protect the body."*

Men and women each recite this three times.

**Fourteenth: The Immortals of the Navel**
The navel is the life of man. It is also called the Central Ultimate, the Grand Abyss, Kunlun, the Unique Pivot, and the Five Cities. Within the Five Cities dwell the Five True Persons. The Five Cities are the Five Thearchs. Beyond the Five Cities are the Eight Officers, who are the spirits of the Eight Trigrams. Together with the Great One, they form the Nine Ministers. Beyond the Eight Trigrams are the Twelve Towers, which are the Twelve Great Princes and Twelve Grand Masters. Together with the spirits of the Triple Burner, they form the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters. The spirits of the four limbs are the Eighty-One Primordial Gentlemen.

Thus, the True Persons of the Five Cities preside over the reckoning of the four seasons; the Eight Spirits preside over the reckoning of the eight seasonal nodes; and the Twelve Grand Masters preside over the reckoning of the twelve months, submitting their accounts on the last day of each month. If one does not slacken month by month, one will be exempt from the reckoning. Constantly maintain this visualization, and one will attain long life.

Therefore, the Great One always strikes the drum in the Five Cities at midnight on the last day of the month, the first day of the month, and the eight seasonal nodes, assembling and summoning all the spirits to audit merits and transgressions, deliberating good and evil. Those recorded shall have their lives extended, and all the spirits shall endorse them. Those unrecorded shall perish, and the Controller of Destinies shall erase their names from the register of the living.

Thus, on the last day of the month, the first day of the month, and the eight seasonal nodes, when about to sleep at night, visualize the Upper Great One, the Middle Great One, the Lower Great One, the True Persons of the Five Cities, and the True Persons of the Twelve Towers, and recite: *"Celestial Thearch, Great One, Celestial Thearch, Great One, reverently visualize all the spirits, befriending them. Controllers of Records, Controllers of Destinies, the Six Ding Jade Maidens—erase my name from the register of the dead and inscribe it in the records of the living. All shall speak of long life."*

**Fifteenth: The Immortals of the Five Cities**
The True Persons of the Five Cities are the spirits of the Five Thearchs of the Five Directions. The spirit of the East is named Gou Mangzi, styled Master Hongya of Literary Beginnings, the Azure Thearch and Lord of the Eastern Sea. The spirit of the South is named Zhu Rongzi, styled Master Cheng of Vermilion Radiance, the Vermilion Thearch and Lord of the Southern Sea. The spirit of the West is named Rushouzi, styled Master Huang of Xiali, the White Thearch and Lord of the Western Sea. The spirit of the North is named Yu Qiangzi, styled Master Chang of Dark Mystery, the Black Thearch and Lord of the Northern Sea. These are all later spirits, equal to the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

The spirit of the Wind Earl is named Zha Jun, styled Longyu. The spirit of the Rain Master is named Feng Xiu, styled Shude. Constantly visualize these spirits, causing them, together with the Lord Controller of Destinies and the Lord Controller of Records, to erase your name from the register of the dead, and you shall become a True Person and attain long life. If you do not know them or visualize them, they will become fierce winds and violent rains, thunder and lightning, seizing you and carrying you far away, slaying your body, burying you in deep mountains, casting you into deep abysses, or striking you with poisonous qi, while myriad ghosts harm you. If you wish to cultivate the Dao, you must pay them reverence. These spirits can harm people, and those who govern the realm cannot afford to be ignorant of them.

The spirit of the Central Realm is named Huang Shangzi, styled Huangshen Pengzu, and is the Yellow Emperor Lord of the Center. Together with the Central Grand Unity, they govern the destinies of humanity, nurturing the virtuous and aiding people’s accomplishments, ever attending the True Persons of the Yellow Heaven. Within humans, there also resides one who constantly attends the True Person, named Zidan, granted by the spirits.

If you aspire to set your mind on the Dao, constantly visualize them, and you shall neither hunger nor thirst, attaining long life and enduring vision. Ascending as a True Person, you will be able to summon the traveling kitchen and command ghosts and spirits.

The spirits of the Earth Altar and the River Earl are named Feng Yi, styled Yuanliang Messenger.

**The Sixteenth Immortal: The Eight Trigram Heavenly Spirits**
The Eight Trigram Heavenly Spirits descend to roam among humanity, guarding the Grand Unity and serving as messengers of the eight directions. They oversee the reckoning of auspicious and inauspicious events on the days of the eight solar terms.

- The Qian spirit is named Zhongni, styled Fuxi.
- The Kan spirit is named Da Zengzi.
- The Gen spirit is named Zhaoguang Yu.
- The Zhen spirit is named Xiao Zengzi.
- The Xun spirit is named Da Xiahou.
- The Li spirit is named Wenchang.
- The Kun spirit is named Yangdi Wang, styled Nüwa.
- The Dui spirit is named Yishi. (Alternatively, some say Bashì.)

On the days of the eight solar terms, constantly visualize them, for these spirits all reside within the navel, granting one extended years.

**The Seventeenth Immortal: The Cinnabar Field**
The Cinnabar Field is the root of the human body, the repository of essence and spirit, the origin of the five viscera, the palace of the Red Child, where men store essence and women store menstrual blood. It governs the birth of children and is the gateway for the harmony of yin and yang. Located three inches below the navel, attached to the spine, it is the root of the two kidneys.

Within the Cinnabar Field, the center is red, the left blue-green, the right yellow, the top white, and the bottom black, forming a square of four inches. Its location three inches below the navel follows the model of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—Heaven as one, Earth as two, Humanity as three, and the seasons as four, hence four inches. It aligns with the five phases, thus bearing five colors.

It is the Clear Water Village, Aoqiu Hamlet. The Cinnabar Field is named the Palace of Stored Essence. Its spirit’s surname is Kong, given name Qiu, styled Zhongni, transmitted as the master.

Constantly at midnight, visualize the heart’s red and black qi ascending to the Crimson Palace and the Florid Canopy, circling each to the right. The Grand Unity enters the Yellow Court, fills the Great Granary, nourishes the Red Child, and returns to the Great Abyss, suddenly vanishing without trace. Then visualize the Grand Unity’s black qi returning to rest within the Cinnabar Field. Constantly visualize the Grand Unity, the Mysterious Radiance, the Dao Mother, and the True Person Zidan, who rectifies my body—from your own name—without forgetting.

**The Eighteenth Immortal**
The large and small intestines serve as the Yuanliang Messengers, expelling and capturing pathogenic qi. The Triple Burner and the Pass of Origin act as the Left Altar and Right Millet spirits, capturing traitors and rebels. The primordial qi of the Upper Burner ascends into the head, forming the ancestral temple, making one’s body equal to Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth, with all their myriad things, must not be violated, for the spirits of Heaven and Earth know all. Likewise, the four limbs of the human body must not be harmed. If there is pain or itching, the spirits also know. From this, it is clearly evident: Heaven cannot be deceived, Earth cannot be betrayed. Cultivate the body and be cautious in conduct, never allowing negligence.

If you wish to expel pathogenic qi and cure the hundred diseases, knock the teeth together twenty-one times and recite:
*"Left Altar, Right Millet, Yuanliang Messengers, expel and capture calamities and misfortunes—hasten as the statutes command!"*
Swallow five times, sigh once, and repeat thirty swallows in total. Perform three hundred and sixty swallows in a day and night. After thirty days, pathogenic qi departs; after sixty days, minor illnesses are cured; after a hundred days, major illnesses are healed. The Three Worms all die, the Three Corpses flee, the face and eyes radiate light, and you become a friend to the spirits. After six recitations, pause; twelve recitations complete one cycle.

**The Nineteenth Immortal**
Between the two kidneys is named the Great Sea, also called Weak Water, wherein resides a spirit turtle. It breathes primordial black qi, generating wind and rain, circulating qi through the four limbs, knowing all without exception.

Above it are nine persons, arranged in three groups of three. To the left is Han Zhong, to the right Fan Li, and in the center, Dachengzi. On the left is the Minister of Education, on the right the Minister of Works, and in the center, the Grand Unity Lord.

To the left is the Azure-Waisted Jade Maiden, to the right the White Water Plain Maiden, and in the center, the Mystic Radiance Jade Maiden. The Mystic Radiance Jade Maiden is the mother of the primordial qi of the Dao. To the left is the Recorder, to the right the Life-Regulator; the Wind Earl and Rain Master escort her, thunder and lightning attend her arrival and departure, while immortals and jade maidens guard the gates and doors—thus it is named the Palace of the Great Abyss.

Formerly, within the Purple Chamber Palace, the Grand Unity’s Mystic Maiden and the Crimson Child resided. Therefore, the Mystic Maiden ever wears the Radiant Star of Venus upon her head and the Luminous Pearl of Supreme Brightness upon her ears, her light illuminating her entire body, thereby prolonging life to immortality.

**The Twentieth Immortal**
The stomach is the Great Granary, the kitchen and storehouse of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The chambers of the heart are the Celestial Son’s palace; all spirits gather in the Great Granary to feast. Thus, the stomach is the Great Granary, where the sun, moon, and three paths traverse. It is also called the Great Sea, wherein resides a spirit turtle. Above the turtle stand the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, positioned at the center. The turtle is yellow, resembling a golden platter, with the sun and moon illuminating it on either side.

Thus, below the navel lies the Earth’s Center, where the Five Peaks and Four Seas converge, waters and springs interflow, and the Weak Water of Kunlun sinks deep into the Dark and Profound Abyss. As the sun and moon traverse, heaven’s daylight shines upon the earth below, and all spirits receive its illumination. Humans emulate this: by day, the sun descends into the navel, illuminating the Cinnabar Field, so that all spirits within the navel receive its light. By night, the sun resides in the stomach, shining upward into the chest, where all spirits roam, play, and converse—thus do dreams arise.

Heaven does not conceal, nor do humans remain unprepared; therefore, summon the spirits to inquire of good and ill fortune, that the kidneys may be guarded with vigilance. By night, the moon rests in the navel, shining downward upon all spirits. By day, the moon resides in the stomach, shining upward into the chest. All spirits ascend and descend in turn, without rest.

Thus, within the stomach dwell twelve spirits: the Remonstrating Gentlemen named Yellow Skirt Master, Yellow Soaring Master, and Central Yellow Master, who serve as tutors and attendants to the Crown Prince. The Mystic Radiance Jade Maiden presides over the gathering of golden liquid, divine elixirs, magic mushrooms, jade essence, pine resin, and all that may be consumed—all shall arrive at once.

**The Twenty-First Immortal**
If you, Zhao, truly seek immortality, you must know the abodes of Heaven and Earth, father and mother, and the Crimson Child. If you pursue the Dao, you cannot be ignorant of these five spirits’ names—you must endure hardship. Know them, practice them, hold fast to them, and constantly contemplate them, and you shall become an immortal. All is contained within the scriptures; you need only comprehend with the heart.

Having known the spirits, you must then obtain the Grand Unity’s divine elixir and golden liquid to attain immortality. All spirits are of primordial blackness, empty and non-acting, naturally becoming sages—not for the vulgar to employ. If you, Zhao, cannot ingest the divine elixir and golden liquid, exhaust your essence in contemplation, and endure hardship.

Thus, I say to you, Zhao: by day, constantly contemplate the sun within the navel, its crimson-yellow essence and black radiance illuminating the navel. Within the stomach is the moon, its white light and crimson-yellow essence filling the stomach with blackness. By night, contemplate the sun within the stomach, its crimson-yellow essence and black radiance illuminating the chest. The moon resides in the navel, its crimson-white light and black essence illuminating the navel. Make this your constant practice, unceasing for ten thousand generations.

The Perfected One, Cinnabar Child, dwells above, within the outer stomach’s tube, beneath a canopy of yellow clouds and blackness, a forest of pearls and jade. He consumes golden jade elixirs, drinks sweet springs and jade liquids, ingests the Tai Yi divine elixir, and gazes upon jade plums and magic mushrooms. Nurture him through visualization, and in nine years, he shall attain perfection. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, he ascends to pay homage to the Supreme Yellow Dao Lord, eastward to the King Father, westward to the Queen Mother, southward to the Elder Yuan Guang. The Perfected One attains the Dao and unites with heaven and earth.

The Primordial Yang Cinnabar Child is I. When my Dao is accomplished, I depart, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, or riding a chariot of yellow gold, clouds, and blackness, pearls and jade, drawn by six flying dragons, reins held by boundless horses. A retinue of eighteen thousand attends me. The Celestial Master’s great spirits send down eighteen thousand to reside within my body, combining into thirty-six thousand. Thus, I ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The stomach’s spirits are twelve, the blackness of the Five Primes, the Grand Master of Remonstrance. The navel’s spirits are five, the Tai Yi’s eight, totaling thirteen. Combined, they are twenty-five, the spirits of the Five Phases and yin-yang. Atop the divine tortoise are three spirits: Mysterious Maiden, Emptiness, and Dao Mother. The kidney’s spirits are six: Minister of Education, Minister of Works, Controller of Destinies, Recorder, Constable, and Commandant of the Court Gentlemen.

**The Twenty-Fourth Immortal**

The goddess of the eastern direction is named Azure-Waisted Jade Maiden; the goddess of the southern direction is named Vermilion Jade Maiden; the goddess of the central direction is named Yellow-Silk Jade Maiden; the goddess of the western direction is named White-Silk Jade Maiden; the goddess of the northern direction is named Mysterious-Light Jade Maiden. To the left is Everlasting Yang, to the right is Receiving Wings—these are all names of the Jade Maidens.

The Way of the Five Phases takes as wife the element it overcomes. For instance, if today is a *jia-yi* day (Wood), Wood overcomes Earth, so *jia* takes *ji* as wife. Thus, *jia-ji*, *yi-geng*, *bing-xin*, *ding-ren*, and *wu-gui* are the days when husband and wife unite. The Liver and Gallbladder correspond to Wood, and the Wood Emperor takes the Central Palace’s *wu-ji* Yellow-Silk Jade Maiden as wife. The rest follow this pattern.

When these two spirit-maidens arrive, serve them with reverence and never take a wife. Taking a wife kills a man, and he will never attain the Dao. If you wish to cultivate the Dao, beware of lust—lust leads to death. These Jade Maidens may be commanded to fetch Jade Nectar and prepare the traveling kitchen.

**The Twenty-Fifth Immortal**
The Supreme Divine One is named Primordial Radiance Grand Unity Lord. To attain the spirit of Grand Unity is not the spirit of the heart but the celestial spirit Southern Culmen Elder, Primordial Radiance, who descends into the human heart. At dawn, midday, *jia-wu* days, or *bing-wu* days, invoke him, saying: *"Southern Culmen Elder, Primordial Radiance Grand Unity Lord, so-and-so wishes to obtain the Grand Unity’s divine elixir and the Way of long life."* Then close your eyes and visualize the Grand Unity Child within your heart, clad in a crimson robe, its color a pure vermilion-yellow like the sun. After ninety breaths, cease.

The spirit within the heart is named Radiant Firmness, the Central Grand Unity Central Culmen Lord, residing in the spleen to nourish your body. At cock’s crow, mealtime, dusk, or on *chen-xu-chou-wei* days, invoke him, saying: *"Central Culmen Radiant Firmness Grand Unity Lord, so-and-so wishes to obtain the Perfected One’s divine immortality and the Yellow Court’s Way."* Then close your eyes and silently visualize a yellow-black figure filling the Great Granary and stomach duct, with a yellow person above the spleen. After fifty breaths, cease.

The spirit below the heart is named Mysterious Valley, the Northern Culmen Lord, the Mysterious Light’s Way-Mother. At midnight, on *jia-zi*, *bing-zi*, *wu-zi*, *geng-zi*, or *ren-zi* days, invoke her, saying: *"Northern Culmen Lord, Mysterious Valley Way-Mother, so-and-so wishes to obtain the Golden Liquid and Sweet Spring for sustenance."* Then close your eyes and visualize between the kidneys a white-black expanse, within which is a spirit-tortoise. Upon the tortoise is a Mysterious Maiden, with the Director of Destinies to her right and the Recorder of Deeds to her left. Upon seeing them, call out: *"Director of Destinies, Recorder of Deeds, Six Ding Jade Maidens, erase so-and-so’s name from the register of death and inscribe it in the Jade Calendar of life—all shall speak of long life."*

Thus it is said: *"Knowing the names of the Three Spirits, one may restore life and extend years."* These Three Spirits are the Heavenly, Earthly, and Divine Way Lords, the Three Primordial Lords of humanity’s origin. Constantly visualize them without forgetfulness. The Three Primordials are the noble spirits of Heaven.

**The Twenty-Sixth Immortal**
If you wish to cultivate the Dao, first traverse the viscera and behold their spirits—only then will you have faith. With accumulated faith, the spirits will reveal themselves. First, visualize the Heavenly Numinous Lord: a blue-bodied, white-headed figure residing between the brows. Meditate on him for three days, and you will see his spirit.

Visualize the Mysterious Breast: a radiant vermilion form. Visualize the throat as pure white like silver, encircled by twelve rings. Meditate on each for three days. Then visualize the lungs as pure white, named *Honghong*, for seven days. Visualize the heart as pure red, named *Taowen*, for nine days. Visualize the liver as pure blue, named *Lanlan*, for three days. Visualize the gallbladder as pure blue, named *Huhu*, for three days. Visualize the spleen as pure yellow, named *Bibi*, for five days. Visualize the stomach as pure yellow, named *Riyidan*, for five days. Visualize the kidneys as pure black, named *Weiwei*, for three days. Visualize the Grand Unity within the navel as red, the person named Jade Numinous Child, for three days. Visualize the large intestine as pure white, named *Dongdong*, for seven days. Visualize the small intestine as pure red, named *Qieqie*, for nine days. Visualize the Cinnabar Field as pure red, within which is a red person named *Cangjing*, for three days. Visualize the Mysterious Cubit and Square Cubit, within which a person resides, for seven days. Visualize the Gold and Jade Seal as dry, complete, and firm, for three days. Visualize the Mysterious Flower as pure black, moist and radiant, for three days. Visualize the two flanks—within each flank’s interior is a Jade Maiden, clad in crimson robes and green skirts, standing upright upon the flanks, for three days. Visualize beneath each foot a person, pure white, for three days.

Having completed the visualization of the Dao, remain in a quiet chamber, renounce worldly affairs, embrace purity and emptiness, first purify yourself, regulate your diet, and then meditate according to the Dao.

**The Twenty-Seventh Immortal**
If you truly wish to cultivate the Dao and become an immortal who never dies, first expel the Three Worms and subdue the Lying Corpses. For three days, perform 160 breaths, ingesting *qi* thirty times before pausing, and ninety times before resting. Do this four times daily. At midnight and cock’s crow, recite the following incantation:

*"Eastern Azure Fang, purple clouds streaming with rosy dawn—consume Azure Fang, ingest the morning’s glory."* Swallow thrice.

*"Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, resplendent and circling—consume Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool."* Swallow thrice.

*"Central Yellow-Black, Yellow Court’s lofty immortal—consume Yellow-Black, drink the Sweet Spring."* Swallow thrice.

*"Western Bright Stone, luminous golden essence—consume Bright Stone, drink the Golden Liquid."* Swallow thrice.

*"Northern Mysterious Nourishment, Mysterious Pearl’s moistening essence—consume Mysterious Nourishment, drink the Jade Syrup."* Swallow thrice.

After thirty days of this practice, the Three Worms all perish, their corpses fleeing away. The Three Spirits settle into their proper places, their black essence stabilized, and the corpse-demons dare not return to the adept’s body. Thus, one attains immortality as a transcendent, inscribed with jade script and golden name, ascending upon clouds.

The *Upper Scroll of the Central Scripture of the Supreme Lord Lao* concludes.

**Twenty-Eighth Transcendent**
On the days of the six *jia* stems, at the hour of *pingri*, clasp the heart and recite the incantation:
*"Verdant Forest, Dark Turtle—how flows the water? Fire blazes around the body. How can others know? The Dao comes to return to oneself, the Dao comes to return to oneself."*
Then visualize the liver’s true color as azure, lustrous and radiant, towering high in the left quadrant. Next, visualize the gallbladder’s true color as azure and round, its interior yellow and exterior green, lustrous and clear, nestled beside the heart and attached to the liver, which covers its crown—this is the beginning of the Dao.
When the visualization is complete, call upon its spirit:
*"Flesh—*or *Skin*—*Child Blue-Blue, be my companion and remain as my servant. I desire the Elixir of the Great One to ingest, that I may live long. Do not depart from my body; abide always in the Purple Chamber Palace, merging with the Dao as one."*
Then close the eyes and visualize the azure-black essence of the sun descending upon the body, entering the nostrils. Envision the liver’s azure-black hue uniting with it before your eyes, then drawing it into the mouth and swallowing thirty-seven times. Circulate the azure-black essence throughout the body, pausing after ninety breaths.
On *yi* days, again visualize the spirit and call:
*"Maiden of the Great One’s Purple Chamber—*or *Purple Palace*—*be my companion and remain as my servant. I desire the Florid Talisman of the Great One to ingest."*
Repeat the visualization on *jia-yin* and *yi-mao* days.

**Twenty-Ninth Transcendent**
On the days of the six *bing* stems, at the hour of *yuzhong*, clasp the heart and recite the incantation:
*"Vermilion Bird, Cinnabar Liquid—Heaven’s Sea, Earth’s River. I seek deathlessness, ingesting Heaven’s Harmony."*
(*Heaven’s Harmony* may also read *Supreme Harmony*.)
Then close the eyes and visualize the heart’s true color as crimson like the sun, resting between the lobes of the lungs. Envision the sun’s red-yellow-black essence appearing before the eyes, entering the mouth, and swallowing twenty-seven times. Circulate the red-black essence throughout the body, pausing after one hundred and eighty breaths.
Call upon its spirit:
*"Li Shang—*or *Li Chang*—*Zengzi, be my companion and remain as my servant. I desire the Elixir of the Great One, golden and pure, fit for ingestion, to abide always in the Crimson Palace, merging with me as one."*
On *ding* days, again visualize the spirit and call:
*"Jade Maiden of the Crimson Palace of the Heavenly Sovereign, be my companion and remain as my servant. I desire the Heavenly Sovereign’s Way of Longevity."*
Repeat the visualization on *bing-wu* and *ding-si* days.

**Thirtieth Transcendent**
On the days of the six *wu* stems, at the hour of *jiming* or *rixi* (dusk), clasp the heart and recite the incantation:
*"Heaven’s Dao, Heaven’s Dao—I wish to never age. My lifespan rivals the Central Sovereign; ascending to Heaven ever early. May my life be prolonged, enduring with the Dao."*
Then close the eyes and visualize the yellow-black essence within the spleen rising to the mouth. Above, envision the yellow-black essence of Heaven’s essence appearing before the eyes, entering the mouth, and swallowing fifteen times. Circulate the yellow-black essence throughout the body, pausing after one hundred and fifty breaths.
Call upon its spirit:
*"Jade Maiden of Mystic Radiance, nurturing the Red Child, the Perfected One’s Child Elixir—ingesting primordial black, feasting on Sweet Springs. Thus, the body’s spirits have three parents in all."*
On *ji* days, again visualize the spirit and call:
*"Jade Maiden of the Yellow Court of the Perfected One, be my companion and remain as my servant. I desire the Perfected One’s Way of the Yellow Court Transcendent."*
Repeat the visualization on *wu-chen*, *ji-wei*, *wu-xu*, and *ji-chou* days.

**Thirty-First Transcendent**
On the days of the six *geng* stems, at the hour of *ribu*, clasp the heart and recite the incantation:
*"Root Child, Root Child—white clouds suddenly rise, mist veiling ten thousand *li*. May the clouds return to me, ever as my servants, reversing the mandate of transcendence, ending only to begin anew."*
Then close the eyes and visualize the lungs’ true color as white, summoning the white-black essence to rise to the mouth. Envision the white-black essence of Heaven’s essence descending before the eyes, entering the mouth, and swallowing twenty-one times. Circulate the white-black essence throughout the body, pausing after one hundred and forty breaths.
Call upon its spirit:
*"Master Wei-Wei, be my companion and remain as my servant, bearing the Florid Canopy, Golden Liquid, and Jade Blossoms. Never depart; attend me, the Dao Lord, merging as one body."*
On *xin* days, again visualize the spirit and call:
*"Radiant Yellow Jade Hall, Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist, be my companions and remain as my servants. I desire the Elixir of Pengzu’s Longevity and Deathlessness to ingest."*
Repeat the visualization on *geng-shen* and *xin-you* days.

**Thirty-Second Transcendent**
On the days of the six *ren* stems, at the hour of midnight, clasp the heart and recite the incantation:
*"I wish to behold Heaven’s Mirror, the Mystic Nourishment of the Jade Pool. Returning white to black, ever as an infant. May the spirits return to me, the Five Viscera following in tow."*
Then close the eyes and visualize the white-black essence circulating between the two kidneys, suffusing the entire body in twelve cycles, spreading and flowing through the four limbs.

Then visualize the two kidneys again, towering and arrayed like a pair of carp—black on the right, crimson on the left—flanking the spine where they reside. Their dazzling radiance illuminates the entire body. Next, envision the azure heavens and the Primordial Brilliance of the Great Clarity descending before your eyes, entering your mouth, and swallowing it nine times in succession. Circulate the White Primordial and Black Perfection of the Great Clarity throughout the body, then return and store it in the Cinnabar Field. Call upon its spirit, saying: *"Controller of Records, Six Ding Jade Maidens, erase my name from the register of death, that I may attain long life, ascend as a Perfected, and the Twelve Celestial Ones all declare me living."* Repeat the visualization on *ren-zi* and *gui-hai* days.

**Thirty-Third Transcendent**
Once the visualization of the spirits of the Five Viscera is complete, proceed to visualize *Xuanxi*, *Yuying*, and *Jinye*, ensuring they are never forgotten. For *Xuanxi*, envision it as moist and luminous, rising in ordered ranks. For *Yuying*, imagine within it a figure with a large, inverted face, dressed as a young child. Visualize it to strengthen and double its size. For *Jinye*, envision it as dry and unhurried, like purple millet filled with mercury. After completing this full-body circulation, repeat the visualization twelve times. When the spirit settles within, harmony and darkness will naturally arise, all illnesses will depart, and lifespan will align with heaven and earth—attaining boundless longevity, how could one know the hour of death?

**Thirty-Fourth Transcendent**
Ingesting the essence of the sun grants long life. Ascend thus to the heavens and pay homage to the Dao Lord. The method: on the first, second, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, at sunrise, face the sun with unbound hair. Close your eyes and visualize a small child within your heart, clad in crimson robes adorned with five-colored patterns, glowing with a brilliant red hue. Both palms are also radiant red. Rub your face with your palms, descending to the heart, repeating this twelve times. Envision the sun’s essence—pure red, yellow, and black—descending before you, entering your mouth, and swallowing it nine times. Guide it with your hands and recite the heartfelt incantation: *"Radiant Lord of the Sun, unite your power with mine, together nourishing the crimson child within the Crimson Palace."* Then visualize it descending from the heart to the Cinnabar Field, guiding it with your hands. Absorb the sun’s essence into your heart, and you shall become an immortal.

**Thirty-Fifth Transcendent**
Ingesting the essence of the moon nourishes the root of the kidneys, turning white hair black again and causing fallen teeth to regrow—thus attaining immortality. At midnight, circulate the white and black essence between the kidneys throughout the body, ascending to the brain’s gate and descending to the soles of the feet. The natural Dao is easy to grasp yet difficult to practice. On the fifteenth day of the lunar month, face the moon and recite: *"Moon Lord, Radiant Child, unite your power with mine, nourishing the child within my Cinnabar Field."* Close your eyes and envision the moon’s white and yellow essence descending before you, entering your mouth, and swallowing it twenty-one times. Guide it with your hands down to the Cinnabar Field. Within the Cinnabar Field, the qi is pure crimson, and within it resides a figure nine fen tall—a young child clad in vermilion robes. Thus, the Cinnabar Field is crimson within and black without, with azure on the left, yellow on the right, and white above—all five qi now complete. Absorb the moon’s essence into your kidneys, and you shall master ascent and descent.

The crimson within the Cinnabar Field is the essence of the Great Yang, the fire of the heart. The black without is the essence of the Great Yin, the qi of the kidneys. The azure on the left is the essence of the Lesser Yang, the qi of the liver. The yellow on the right is the essence of the Central Harmony, the qi of the spleen. The white above, like a silver plate covering it, is the essence of the Lesser Yin, the qi of the lungs. The five figures within are the heirs of the Five Viscera, the spirits of the Five Phases. Only when the Cinnabar Field is perfected does one become a Perfected.

Thus, benevolence arises from the essence of the liver. Propriety and bearing arise from the essence of the heart. Righteousness and wisdom arise from the essence of the lungs. Harmony and joy arise from the essence of the kidneys. Loyalty, trust, sincerity, and thickness arise from the essence of the spleen. Eloquence and courage arise from the essence of the gallbladder. Gentleness and calm arise from the flourishing qi of the gallbladder. Blindness arises from the declining qi of the liver. Cowardice arises from the declining qi of the lungs. Madness arises from the declining qi of the heart. Weakness arises from the declining qi of the kidneys. Ignorance and deafness arise from the declining qi of the spleen. The decline of the Five Viscera manifests in oneself.

Grief and sorrow injure the liver; when the liver is injured, the eyes dim and the head whitens—nourish it with the heart and kidneys. Excessive indulgence injures the kidneys; when the kidneys are injured, the waist aches, the body grows heavy, and urine and stool contain pus and blood—nourish it with the liver and lungs. Anger injures the heart; when the heart is injured, one suffers from stiffness and vomiting blood—nourish it with the liver and spleen. Misfortune and hardship injure the lungs; when the lungs are injured, nourish them with the spleen and kidneys. Overeating and excessive drunkenness injure the spleen; when the spleen is injured, nourish it with the heart and lungs. Let the mother and child organs nourish one another, and illness will be cured and ailments dispelled. Seekers of immortality must avoid injuring the Five Viscera—scholars, take heed and reflect.

**Thirty-Sixth Transcendent**
Ingesting the essence of the Great Ultimate grants long life. On the six *wu* days, at the hour corresponding to the celestial stem (or "spirit"), the Daoist, dressed in ritual attire within the chamber, faces north and bows twice, saying: *"August Heaven, Supreme Lord, and Most High Dao Lord, your humble descendant, Wang Jia, loves the Dao and wishes for long life."* Before sleeping at night, visualize the essence of the great bright star at the center of the Northern Dipper and the Great Ultimate—pure yellow and black—descending before you, entering your mouth, and swallowing it fifteen times.

The yellow essence fills the Great Granary of the Yellow Court, descending into the Cinnabar Field. Then visualize within the Crimson Palace a vermilion person; in the Purple Chamber Palace, five figures—among them the Supreme Unity Lord, with Laozi and the immortal Zhongchengzi to the left, Taihe and Quwenzhi to the right. In the Hall of Light resides the Dark Radiance Jade Maiden, with the Yellow-Robed Youth to her left and the Central Yellow Perfected to her right, all guarding the Perfected Youth Zidan. Next, visualize the Three Dukes of the Jade Hall and invoke: *"Six Ding Jade Maidens of the Records Office, erase my name from the register of death and grant me long life."* When the black essence stabilizes, again visualize the Perfected Youth Zidan within the stomach duct and pray: *"Dark Radiance Jade Maiden, nourish my Perfected Youth Zidan. Consume the primordial black essence, drink the sweet spring of the Liquor Spring."* With the Northern Dipper’s pole star supporting the spleen, the spleen receives the essence of the Dipper’s pole and becomes a Perfected.

**Thirty-Seventh Transcendent**
The lungs are the Minister of Works, the liver the Terrace of Orchids, the heart the Grand Commandant, the left kidney the Minister of Education, the right kidney the Minister of Public Works, the spleen the Empress, Noblewoman, and Lady, the gallbladder the Son of Heaven and Great Dao Lord, the stomach the Great Granary—the palace of the Crown Prince, my dwelling. The large and small intestines are the Envoys of the Primordial Beam, the lower primordial qi the Grand Herald, the middle primordial qi the Eighty-One Primordial Scholars, and the upper primordial black essence the High Chariot Envoys, who communicate with the Supreme Sovereign. Thus, the lungs are the Jade Hall Palace, the heart the Crimson Palace and Vermilion Bird Gate, the kidneys the Northern Pole’s Dark Gate and Dark Warrior Side Gate, the spleen the Hall of Light and the Chamberlain’s Pavilion. The stomach is the Upper Sea, where the sun and moon reside. The navel is the Lower Sea, where the sun and moon ascend and descend to the stomach. Therefore, the Great Beginning is the origin of primordial black essence—the Dao, the One. Above the heart is Heaven. The Great Commencement is the origin of the myriad things—mountains and rivers, Earth, the kidneys. The Great Simplicity is the origin of humans—essence, the spleen, Earth. Above, there are also three palaces: the eyes are the Crimson Palace, the ears the Jade Hall Palace, the nose and mouth the Hall of Light. The space between the eyebrows is the Suburban Mountain; by harmonizing the Three Primordials to nurture the Perfected Youth, one’s vision becomes clear and penetrating. Lord Lao said: *"Though the myriad Dao are numerous, simply preserve the thought of the Youth Zidan."* The One is the Dao. That which resides in the Purple Chamber Palace is the gallbladder. The Youth Zidan is the self. The self is the true body. Here the Dao is complete.

**Thirty-Eighth Transcendent**
When Daoists refine mercury to dissolve sands, liquids, pearls, jades, and the Eight Stones into divine elixirs, consuming a single *daogui* allows one to ascend to the celestial palaces. By constantly absorbing qi, one attains long life as a divine immortal. Cultivating spirit and consuming the elixir makes one a Perfected. The Perfected who attain the Dao assist the Supreme Sovereign in governance. Thus, the Perfected, with water and earth, vast and boundless, like the heavens and earth—profound and obscure—know not where they abide, yet after eighteen thousand years, they form Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Therefore, the Perfected use earth to create humans, breathing, eating, riding, and commanding, so that earth does not exist alone, nor humans remain solitary. Thus, it is said that yellow earth is humanity’s origin. The Perfected depart, ascending to the Nine Heavens. The worldly, lacking the Dao, descend into the Yellow Springs. Add three *sheng* of earth—*zi* here means "complete." Without bones or sinews—alternatively, "ribs." Thus, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One said: *"Those who feed on Heaven repay Heaven with their bodies, ascending as Perfected, divine immortals at play. Those who feed on Earth repay Earth with their bodies, descending as corpses and ghosts. Those who feed on humans repay humans with their bodies, their bones and hair discarded and abandoned."* If you seek the Dao, do not eat flying birds, for they are born of Heaven; killing them repeatedly shortens your lifespan. Humans and livestock may consume them, serving as butchers for the six domestic animals. Avoid the Six Ding spirits—beastly creatures—do not eat them. Ding-mao is the rabbit, Ding-chou the ox, Ding-hai the pig, Ding-you the rooster, Ding-wei the sheep, and Ding-si the snake; these are strictly forbidden, as they are the taboos of the Six Ding spirits. When riding the black essence and ingesting the elixir to enter the chamber, do not eat living beings; abstain from the meat of the five livestock. The five livestock are horses, oxen, sheep, pigs, and dogs. Only consume chicken eggs and fish. Avoid the Five Pungent foods, foul-smelling or self-dead creatures; be cautious not to eat them. Even when ingesting the elixir, these are forbidden during the refinement period.

**Thirty-Ninth Transcendent**
The Dao is the self, the Supreme Sovereign of the Uppermost Central Pole. At sunrise, noon, dusk, and midnight—alternatively, at *shen* and *you*—constantly visualize the great yellow star at the center of the Great Ultimate. Its essence descends to rest between your eyebrows, radiant in vermilion, yellow, and white like the sun. With intention, guide it into your mouth and swallow it, allowing its qi to descend into the Crimson Palace, Purple Chamber, and Yellow Court. Swallow it fifteen times and pray: *"August Heaven, Supreme Lord, and Most High Dao Lord, your humble descendant, [your name], loves the Dao and wishes for long life."* This is my qi, from which I was born. Visualize it ten thousand times without ceasing, granting you long life, ascending as a Perfected. Cloud chariots descend to welcome you, flying to the celestial palaces to pay homage before the Supreme Elder of the Southern Pole and the Primordial Radiance. Lord Lao said: *"The sage dissolves pearls, the worthy refines water-jade. Dissolving pearls and refining water-jade follow the same method."* Dissolving pearls means consuming the essence of the sun—your left eye is the sun. Refining water-jade means consuming the essence of the moon—your right eye is the moon. Lie supine with hair unbound, close your eyes, and constantly visualize the yellow essence and vermilion qi from both eyes descending into your mouth. Swallow it twenty-seven times.

"Granting one divine clarity, penetrating vision in all eight directions. Consume the essence of the lungs: constantly visualize the white qi within the lungs ascending to the throat, entering the mouth, and swallow it twenty-one times. This grants divine clarity, radiant complexion, repels evil, and attracts spirits. Jade maidens attend you, bestowing longevity and warding off all ghosts.

Constantly visualize a youth in crimson robes within your body, dwelling in the heart’s center. The center is where divine clarity resides. At times, visualize a purple canopy within the heart, beneath which stands a figure wearing a red headdress and crimson robes, holding an arrow and drawing a bow, fierce and wrathful—this repels weapons and commands ghosts and spirits.

The Fortieth Perfected Immortal:
Constantly envision purple clouds emerging from the crown of the head like a chariot canopy, resembling fiery qi with five-colored patterns, ascending to connect with heaven. With focused intention, guide them to descend in unison with the heavens. Visualize the yellow qi within the stomach like a tangerine, suddenly growing and expanding until the body’s form resembles the sun. Envision the red and yellow persons of primordial qi beneath the eyes, the Dao-qi circulating through the four limbs, ascending high into the sun (or ascending a terrace). Rise to the Crimson Palace, the Purple Chamber, and the Great One.

Recite the incantation:"

The Great One of the Northern Culmen, reverently addressing all gods, constantly ensures the hun and po remain peaceful, never departing from so-and-so’s body. This is called the formless natural state.

The Forty-First Perfected Immortal:
Twelve ghost-arrows can repel weapons. Constantly envision twelve stalks of lingzhi within the heart, ascending to connect with the lungs. With focused intention, embrace them—this is called the ghost-arrow. Practitioners who regularly perform this will naturally repel the five weapons, and evil will vanish of itself. Use them to strike the four barbarians, casting away false lightning. Simply inquire of weapon-warding talismans, blades, halberds, gold, and silver—heavenly gods will all aid the true. The Thunder Duke drums, Venus radiates light, the White Emperor draws his crossbow, Chiyou repels weapons, the Azure Dragon guards the gate, the Martial Yi stand in the courtyard, the Victorious Serpent and Dark Warrior dispel misfortune, the White Rabbit pounds medicine, the Toad lingers nearby, the Great One harmonizes the elixir, and Pengzu was ever the first. Consume a knife-tip’s measure, and the face and eyes will radiate light. The body sprouts feathers and plumage, ascending to pay homage to the Supreme Sovereign. This Dao causes all spirit-qi to unite with you—be diligent and do not slacken.

The Forty-Second Perfected Immortal:
On Gengshen days during the shen hour, loosen the hair, lie supine with the head toward the southwest, stretch the body, close the eyes, and envision the lungs as pure white, moist and luminous, containing a stalk of lingzhi as thick as a little finger, hollow and bright within, descending to connect with the heart. Within it, green and red qi ascend and descend, flowing between heart and lungs. Sustain this visualization until the evening hour. The lungs are humanity’s heaven; the heart is humanity’s sun. The sun’s qi ascends like the essence of cinnabar, never ceasing—humans must obtain this qi to live. Losing this qi means death. This is called the Dao of spontaneity. The Dao communicates with the divine.

The Forty-Third Perfected Immortal:
Constantly envision the heart’s red qi like the sun, inwardly green and outwardly black, the three combining into virtue to accord with the Dao’s numerology. The master says: At dawn, constantly envision the heart’s true redness like the sun. Within the sun is a person wearing a grand crown and red silk robes. When the practitioner sees this, call out: “Celestial Sovereign Great One, make so-and-so long-lived as a Perfected Immortal.”

The Forty-Fourth Perfected Immortal:
The method of returning essence to the Crimson Palace: On the first, fifteenth, and last days of the month, at sunrise, loosen the hair, bind the head, lie facing the sun, and rub between the breasts with both hands, descending to the heart—repeat nine times and stop. Press the heart and say: “Divine head, divine return to the Crimson Palace, never leave this body.” The spirit will be at peace, dwelling in stillness and speaking with you. Do this thrice and cease. The master says: Rubbing between the breasts allows qi to ascend and descend freely. Rubbing the heart while visualizing a youth—this is called emptiness and non-being. Returning essence to the Crimson Palace is performed on the third day of the month—this is the Dao of spirit immortals.

The Forty-Fifth Perfected Immortal:
The Primordial Yang Red Person is the Great One. The Primordial Yang Dao Lord is the Central Great One. The Primordial Yang Vermilion Child is one’s own body. The Primordial Yang Mysterious Radiance Jade Maiden is the mother of the Dao. The Primordial Yang Sovereign Person is the King of the Great One. The Primordial Yang Cinnabar Field is the palace that stores essence. The master says: *Yuan* means qi; *yang* means the sun. Envision the heart containing a sun, and within the sun a red person wearing a grand crimson crown and red silk robes. Next, envision the gallbladder containing the bright star of Venus, its threefold radiance illuminating all. Above the star is a person wearing crimson robes and a nine-virtue crown. The Dao Lord stands at the center, with Laozi and Zhongchengzi to the left, Taihe and Quwenzhi to the right—five in all, yet one. Next, envision the spleen’s true yellow, containing a sun with three persons: the Dao Mother Mysterious Radiance Jade Maiden at the center, Yellow Robe Child to the left, and Central Yellow Upright to the right. Next, envision the stomach duct containing the Perfected Vermilion Child seated upon a pearl-and-jade lung, with golden qi forming a canopy and jade maidens and youths attending. Next, envision the Great One within the navel, wearing five-colored crimson robes and a three-crimson crown, with a green person to the left, a white person to the right, a red person in front, and a black person behind. Next, envision the Cinnabar Field containing red qi, and within the red qi three persons: a red person at the center, a green person to the left, and a yellow person to the right, the red qi encircling them, inwardly green and outwardly black, white above and yellow within. After completing this visualization, external apparitions may appear, and spirit-qi will come to speak with you.

The Forty-Sixth Perfected Immortal:
Constantly envision yellow qi within the spleen ascending to the mouth, swallow it three to five times and cease—this will satiate. It can dispel grains, allowing one to sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing. The master says: Constantly envision the spleen containing a sun, and within the sun a golden coffer sealed with a yellow jade seal three inches wide, inscribed with the characters *Wei Xi*. Focus intently, and evil will depart of itself. If the practitioner can see and read it, the heart will open and the eyes brighten, instantly becoming a spirit immortal.

The Forty-Seventh Perfected Immortal:
Constantly envision the stomach’s true white like congealed fat, containing yellow qi filling the Great Granary, ascending to the mouth—swallowing it brings satiety. The master says: The stomach is the Great Granary. All gods come to the Great Granary to eat and drink. Within it is a golden cauldron, golden rice, and jade maidens and youths who serve—thus it is called Yellow Robe Child, summoning the traveling kitchen.

The Forty-Eighth Perfected Immortal:
The kidneys are the root of primordial qi. Constantly envision white qi between the kidneys ascending to the head, descending to the soles of the feet and the tips of the ten toes, circulating throughout the body twelve times before ceasing. When hands and feet grow warm, one can be free from hunger, thirst, and cold, remain ageless, and white hair turn black again.

The adept should constantly practice this.

The Forty-Ninth Perfected Immortal:
On the new and full moons, envision white qi between the kidneys ascending to the crown of the head and descending to the soles of the feet. The divine tortoise’s five-colored shell bears patterns like intertwined cords. Above it sits the Jade Maiden of Mystic Radiance, with two elders facing each other. Before them stands the Great One, and behind them, the Dark Obscurity, the Registrar, and the Lord of Destiny, who together deliberate over the life and death of humans. Focus the essence of this vision for thirty breaths before ceasing.

Recite: "Lord Registrar, Lord of Destiny, Six Ding Jade Maidens—erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the record of life. This is what is meant by longevity." The divine tortoise breathes, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, acting as it pleases. The spirit of the white tortoise spreads primordial qi, warming the four limbs. Humans must obtain kidney qi, for only through the divine tortoise’s breath does life arise. Practice this on *jiǎzǐ* and *rénzǐ* days, and you will attain longevity.

The Fiftieth Perfected Immortal:
On *jiǎwǔ* days at noon, let your hair down, lie facing south with eyes closed, and visualize within the cinnabar field three inches below the navel a yellow qi, its core a true red the size of a palm, surrounded by black, and beyond that, green. Above the navel, white qi covers it—this is the qi of the lungs. To the left is green qi, to the right yellow qi, each the size of a palm. These three are the qi of the liver, spleen, and lungs.

The master says: The red within the cinnabar field is the qi of Greater Yang. The black surrounding it is the qi of Greater Yin. The green beyond is the qi of Lesser Yang. When the Three Powers unite in virtue and the Three Qi guard them, one attains longevity.

The Fifty-First Perfected Immortal:
The heart is emptiness; the kidneys are the root. The qi of emptiness ascends, clear, to become heaven; the qi of the root descends, tranquil, to become earth, entering the Great Abyss. Thus, the qi of emptiness generates exhalation, and the qi of the root generates inhalation. The heart is the sun; the kidneys are the moon; the spleen is the Dipper. When the qi of the heart descends and the qi of the kidneys ascends, they unite as one, spreading through the four limbs without cease. Thus, the heart governs blood, the kidneys govern qi, and their union creates circulation—this is called the vessels. The vessels are the dwelling of the hun and po souls, the countenance of humans. When the hun and po depart, the master becomes still. When all vessels are exhausted, qi ceases, and with its cessation, death follows.

Therefore, those who pursue the Dao must not fail to preserve their spirit, nourish their root, and augment their qi. Adept, strive with all your might, for I shall soon depart. When a Perfected One attains the Dao, they meet once every eighteen thousand years. When a Daoist attains the Dao, they meet once every thousand years. Thus, I compose *The Central Scripture* to bequeath to later generations. Originally hidden in the Golden Casket of the Supreme Sovereign, when a Daoist obtains it, it is worth a thousand gold pieces—do not transmit it lightly.

The Fifty-Second Perfected Immortal:
The Three Origins converge on *jǐhài* days. The Three Origins are the Great One, Greater Yin, and Palace Qi. All three arise on *jǐhài*. The Great One moves left, advancing one celestial stem per year. Harmful qi moves right, passing through the four first months of the seasons, one per year. Greater Yin moves right, advancing one celestial stem every three years, completing a cycle in nine years, and a full revolution in thirty-six years. When the Three Origins converge on *hài*, floods, droughts, warfare, and famine arise, and disasters strike together.

In years when the Three Origins converge, yin and yang are blocked and disordered, shaking heaven and earth. Harmful qi spreads—when it moves by day, it damages crops; when it strikes people, epidemics arise; when it strikes grain, famine and scarcity follow. If you dwell in such times, you cannot survive on your own. How can you not strive with all your might to study the Dao in due time?

In this destined age, floods, droughts, locusts, and crop failures will bring famine and scarcity. Warfare will erupt, people will suffer epidemics, roads will be impassable, and the old and young will scatter, fleeing to other lands. When the calamity strikes, parents, wives, children, and siblings will be torn apart, their livers shattered and bowels severed. Some will be reduced to slavery, not knowing their own county or village. If you only seek to study the Dao then, is it not too late? Is it not too late?

I deeply warn you: preserve your spirit and refine the elixir. Prepare early, and when chaos comes, flee far and hide deeply. In the age of a sagely and enlightened ruler, the Dao may be practiced openly. Thus, the conjunctions of heaven and earth occur: a minor scarcity every forty-five years, a minor famine every ninety years, a great scarcity every one hundred eighty years, and a great famine every three hundred sixty years. Every five hundred years, the worthy gather in small numbers; every thousand years, sages gather in small numbers; every thirty-six hundred years, sages convene in great assembly. Every eighteen thousand years, a Perfected One emerges to govern briefly. Every thirty-six thousand years, a Supreme Immortal emerges to govern; every three million six hundred thousand years, heaven and earth undergo a great conjunction.

Primordial qi surges like a flood, and the Great Beginning takes form. Humans become one of the myriad things, unaware of east, west, south, or north. Humans transform into birds and beasts, and birds and beasts transform into humans. Perfected Ones dwell above primordial qi, while Immortals reside at the edge of the boundless. Daoists who retreat into seclusion may yet attain honor and esteem.

The Fifty-Third Perfected Immortal:
The Heavenly Capital of the Capital Prefecture lies at the left tip of the Curved Array, named Lord An De. He, together with the Northern Lord of the Great One of Heaven, calculates and discusses the affairs of all spirits, governing the hun and po souls, which assemble at the Southern Culmen. Those whose names are recorded in the registers have their lives extended, and all spirits support them. Those whose names are not recorded meet their end—the Lord of Destiny severs their fate, and their hun and po souls assemble at the Northern Culmen.

Those who have performed meritorious deeds for humans, heaven, earth, and the myriad things will see their descendants prosper, live long, and enjoy clarity and brilliance. Their bodies may be enfeoffed as marquises, and they may be reborn as humans. Those lacking virtue fall into three categories:
First, those who are cruel, oppressive, and tyrannical, harming heaven, earth, and the four seasons;
Second, those who curse, envy, indulge in licentiousness, and show contempt for heaven, earth, and the gods;
Third, those who are unfilial, disloyal, thieving, treacherous, or who bury and kill others.

Those who commit these three transgressions will see their descendants cut off. Humans are born with three destinies, and when they marry or give their daughters in marriage, one more destiny is determined.

When relocating graves or conducting burials, another destiny is determined. Those who secure an auspicious site will live long, and their descendants will prosper. Those who secure an inauspicious site will die, and their descendants will suffer poverty and hardship.

How, then, do you stand before heaven and earth in this world? The gods are to be feared. Thus, heaven has set the sun and moon, the Northern Dipper, the twenty-eight constellations, and the five planets to govern, while the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, along with all other deities, oversee the affairs of the people. If you remain ignorant of this, you should indeed fear them.

Moreover, malevolent ghosts, spectral beings, ancestral spirits, inauspicious village deities, the earth and water spirits who control life, the gatekeepers of households, well spirits, the pure and profound, the Taiyin waterways—all these can kill. If you wish to repel evil and ward off ghosts, you must wear talismans and then ingest divine medicines. Talismans are the pledges of heaven and earth. Medicines are the cinnabar of humans, strengthening qi and vitality, lightening the body, and fortifying it. Then, evil qi and spectral beings cannot harm you, and you will become an immortal.

Ghosts are the messengers of the gods. When they see the pledge of heaven, they depart. Humans also possess this—within the dwellings of the capital’s outskirts, in the wandering hamlet of Youji, there is the Summer Official, the Yellow Elder, styled Dehuang, residing at the center of the navel. This is the Great One, also called the Jade Spirit Child, clad in five-colored vermilion robes, overseeing the Yellow Gods. On the day of the autumn equinox, he conducts his review and reckoning.

For three days—one day before, the day of, and one day after the equinox—you must remain secluded indoors. At cock’s crow, contemplate him, and from dawn until midday, invoke him thrice daily for three days, totaling nine invocations. Lie with your hair unbound, facing northwest, body relaxed, ensuring no one sees you. Instruct your household to remain silent. First, purify yourself through fasting and bathing. On the appointed day, enter a quiet chamber, calm your mind, and settle your spirit. Begin with this prayer:

*"Great-grandson, humble initiate [your name], devoted to the Dao, wishes for longevity. On this autumn equinox, may the Heavenly Emperor’s messenger, the Summer Official Yellow Elder, descend into my body to conduct his review and reckoning. May all spirits assemble without fail."*

Invoke him thrice from above, repeating this three times daily for three days, ceasing at midday. Then declare:

*"Recorder of the Six Ding Jade Maidens, erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the jade records of long-life immortals. Hasten, as decreed by the statutes!"*

On that day, the Heavenly Emperor’s Boundless Lord will respond: *"So be it."* Bow twice toward the grove, prostrating in gratitude to the celestial gods. Thus, the Dao is fulfilled within you.

**Fifty-Fourth: Immortals**
If you wish to know the types of perfected ones and immortals: Immortals wear feathered robes and grow plumage, while perfected ones cast no shadow and don their five-colored vermilion garments. Their dwellings are not fixed—they roam east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, and north in winter, drifting above famous mountains like Kunlun, Penglai, and Dayi, or the Nine Regions, occasionally ascending to pay homage to the Supreme August One.

Thus, perfected ones who attain the Dao live for eighty million years. They ride chariots of pearl, jade, and cloud qi, drawn by boundless horses, sometimes harnessing six flying dragons to assist the Supreme August One in governance. Middle immortals ascend to the middle heavens, traveling on clouds across seas and rivers. Lesser immortals undergo liberation through simulated death; on dark moons, they gather for rites and must not slacken, for they serve as divine messengers.

The Dao is not inherently different—only the rank of their conveyances sets them apart. Thus, those who live a hundred years develop yellow hair; at three hundred, their temples rise; at four hundred, their faces show vertical lines; at five hundred, their pupils become square; at six hundred, their ribs thicken; at seven hundred, their bones fill out; at eight hundred, their sinews transform; at nine hundred, their ears elongate; and at a thousand, they ascend to heaven to pay homage to the Supreme August One and the Great One as immortals. Perfected ones have double pupils, enabling them to see clearly in all eight directions. Consuming mushrooms and elixirs prevents aging. After eighteen thousand years, humans revert to childhood—males at eight, females at seven—beginning anew.

**Fifty-Fifth: Immortals**
To subdue the hundred evils, the hundred ghosts, and ancient spectral beings, always carry talismans, a sharp sword, and a jar of water. Observe their reflections within. In all your comings and goings, if you suddenly encounter strange apparitions, examine their forms in the light of the sun or moon to discern them.

Use cinnabar to inscribe talismans for subduing the hundred evils, placing them upon the water’s surface. When evil ghosts see them, they will naturally dissipate. All manner of spectral beings—dragons, snakes, tigers, leopards, the six livestock, foxes, fish, perch, turtles, flying birds, elk, deer, and ancient trees—can become spirits. If they harm humans, inscribe talismans to sever them and consign them to the River Earl and the Village Deity. Summon the current day’s talisman-bearing messenger, guarded by the Six Ding spirits for protection.

The left script resides within the *Eighty-One Mysterious Diagrams of the Six Jia Palaces and the Forty-Nine Perfected Ones*. There are also the *Seven Mechanisms of the Pearl Womb*, the *Canopy of Floral Brilliance*, and the *Pure Contemplation*—all capable of subduing the hundred evils. These four talismans must not be worn by the impure.

Instead, wear the *Majestic Joy*, *Giant Victory*, *Left Contract*, *Right Archer*, *Great Ultimate*, *Great Clarity*, *Great Mystery*, *Yang Chapter*, *Participating in Heaven*, *Enveloping Primordial Qi*, and *Great Void*—these are the supreme Dao. Wear them always, and nothing will be beyond defense, nor will there be any prohibitions.

The upper inscription reads:
*"August Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Dao Lord, great-grandson humble initiate Wang [your name], devoted to the Dao, wishes for longevity. May all desires arise from the heart, residing naturally within, without excess words."*

The sealed inscription reads:
*"August Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Dao Lord, Heavenly One, Great One, Northern Thousand Lords, Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Lords, Life Controller Lord, Record Keeper Lord, great-grandson humble initiate Wang [your name], devoted to the Dao, wishes for longevity. Only the Life Controller and Record Keeper Lords can erase the register of death and inscribe the jade records of long-life immortals, designating me as a perfected one. Hasten, as decreed by the statutes!"*

Your humble servant [your name] is hereby appointed as the Messenger of the Great One. Bowing twice, I receive the mandate from the Supreme August Dao Lord and the Yellow Court Youth. Bowing twice again, I inscribe the covenant, seal the talisman, and transmit it.

First, purify yourself and dissolve past transgressions. Regularly, on the days of seasonal renewal and the eight solar terms, offer wine and dried meat upon the waters of an eastward-flowing stream to dissolve transgressions—southward-flowing waters are also acceptable.

The *Mysterious Charts of Divine Immortals* states: The fifty-five chapters of the Jade Register, along with the name-tally and authenticating tokens, are stored within the Golden Coffer, Jade Pedestal, and Jade Bamboo Case of the Supreme August One. The sealing power is weighty. Should you obtain these, guard them carefully and do not transmit them recklessly. Be cautious, my disciple, and do not accept payment for them. Transmit them only to the worthy, and you may attain divine immortality.

I frequently examine these two scrolls of the *Central Scripture* myself. I have commanded the Life Controller to dispatch spirits to guard you. Do not recklessly alter or conceal my texts. Should even a single character be missing, I will know. Be vigilant, my disciple, be vigilant.

Follow my words precisely when inscribing talismans and characters, using cinnabar and ink—this is my authenticating mark. If you truly desire divine immortality, first ingest the Returned Elixir and Golden Fluid, cultivate spirit, and you will immediately ascend as an immortal, becoming a perfected one.

If you do not ingest the divine elixir and golden fluid, you will suffer hardship, struck by cold, heat, and malevolent winds, and the Life Controller will not save you. The Dao spirits will be powerless to aid you. If you practice the Dao, wear warm clothing, eat suitably, abide in emptiness, and follow nature, even ghosts will be unable to harm you. Yet if your years reach their end, you will die naturally.

Why is this so? Because you have not steadfastly guarded the spirit. It is like the growth of the myriad things—they do not seek death, yet naturally wither, decay, and perish. You are no different.

I offer this analogy: seek a master with the urgency of a crossbow’s tension. Of my eighty-one disciples, all became immortals; ten now wander among the people as reclusive valley immortals. I did not emerge to deliver Qin or Xiang, but appeared for the Han, aligning with the Yellow Epoch. This is my great fortune.

Here ends the lower scroll of the *Central Scripture* of the Supreme Venerable Lord.
