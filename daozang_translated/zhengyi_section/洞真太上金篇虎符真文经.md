**The Wondrous Scripture of the Golden Tiger Talisman of the Supreme Cavernous Perfection**

The Golden Tiger True Talisman was transmitted by the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity to the Celestial Lord of the Golden Tower. Inscribed in cinnabar upon white silk and encased in a purple brocade pouch, it is worn upon the head when in use. Thus empowered, one commands the spirits of heaven and earth, and all divine immortals bow in reverence. Jade maidens proffer towels, celestial warriors guard the body, and the mountains and peaks submit their essence.

When combined with the incantation of divine authority and the jade scripture of numinous essence, one may decapitate the Nine Demons and annihilate a thousand specters. This is a forbidden talisman of the Supreme Clarity, not to be disseminated in the world. Those who wear it ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The **Inner Incantation of the Supreme Radiance of the Primordial Qi’s Golden True Might** is employed to summon divine soldiers and exterminate wayward souls. One must enter a chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Seated or reclining at will, recite the following:

*"Expel the Toxic King of Qian,
The Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo,
The Eight Immortals wielding axes,
The Five Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor,
The Supreme Mystery’s Falling Radiance,
The Seven Dawns guarding the courtyard,
The Yellow True’s luminous talisman,
Flaming bells cast in splendor,
The Divine Tiger baring its fangs,
Poisoned blades raging unchecked,
The Purple Flourishing of Patterned Rites,
Four leaps, roaring skyward,
The Nine Heavens and Six Heavens,
The Four Heavens gleaming bright,
Externally enwrapped in primordial qi,
Internally commanding the marshaled hosts,
Left wielding might, right surveying,
Wind cleaves, fire conquers,
Roaring to slay ten thousand specters,
Seizing and beheading a thousand spirits,
The Golden True awakens in thunder,
The Nine Demons submit their forms,
The Northern Feng crumbles,
All that is destroyed collapses.
I wear the true talisman,
Commanding ten thousand spirits.
The Three Origins declare the truth,
Mysteriously uniting with the Emperor’s sincerity.
By the Supreme Tenuity’s decree,
Ascend to the Three Clarities."*

The method of the **Inner Incantation of the Supreme Radiance’s Might** belongs to the forbidden scriptures of the Supreme Clarity.

The **"Toxic King of Qian"** is the esoteric name of the great demon of the Six Heavens.
The **"Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo"** is the hidden title of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor.
The **"Four Heavens gleaming bright"** are the soul-names of the ghost-ministers of the Northern Feng.

One who knows the names of these three demons causes a thousand specters to flee and ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms. The Nine Demons dare not stir, and a hundred evils cannot inflict harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits of temples and shrines, one may act accordingly without needing to burn incense or enter a chamber.

Alternatively, inscribe the talisman with realgar upon green silk, three feet in length and one foot two inches in width—or a square of one foot two inches. Border it on all four sides with red brocade, and wear it on the right side of the waist. When entering a fast or chamber, or during the eight or nine assemblies of dawn and dusk, it may be worn to subdue demons, summon spirits, and command divine perfected beings.

Beware never to approach corpses or impurities, for the sin is equal to leaking the secret. The Ancestor of the Seven Mysteries will be punished in hell.

**The Jade Scripture of the Divine Tiger’s Inner True Talisman**

The Divine Tiger True Talisman was bestowed by the Supreme Perfected Parents of the Nine Heavens. The Supreme Perfected Elder transmitted it to the Youth of the Eastern Sea, and the True King of the Nine Heavens transmitted it to the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord treasured and concealed it within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Capital of the Grand Tenuity, guarded by mighty beasts and defended by venomous dragons. Seven thousand Divine Tigers stand ready in the Golden Tower, while three hundred Golden Dawn Jade Lads and three hundred Pure Numinous Jade Maidens attend the sacred scripture.

Its mystic radiance shines through empty space, scattering purple mist across the courtyard. Its might shakes the nine distant realms, its divine light blazes in the Supreme Clarity, its wondrous harmony arises from spontaneity, and its penetrating wisdom pierces the formless. The Divine Tiger’s stripes manifest its image, the Golden Tiger spans its truth, wisdom marks its essence, and the vanquishing of demons unfolds its source.

Its subtle meanings and hidden phrases are difficult to fathom, for they record the hidden titles of heavenly demons and the esoteric names of a hundred spirits. Reciting its verses startles a thousand spirits, and chanting its passages binds ten thousand specters.

At the inception of governance in the Three Heavens, it was entrusted to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, empowering him to overawe the Six Heavens, decapitate ten thousand specters, summon mountains and seas, bind all spirits, subdue demons, and reverse the course of the five planets.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity received the two talismans of **Numinous Golden Wisdom for Vanquishing Demons**. Wearing them, he soared through the Supreme Clarity, riding the void in a transcendent chariot. He traversed the Grand Tenuity, alighted in the Palace of the Supreme Perfected’s Radiance, and stood upon the steps of the Jade Emperor. At rest, he harmonized with heaven and earth; in motion, he gleamed with the Seven Luminaries. He rectified the Nine Mysteries, grasped the tally of numinous mechanism, encompassed the ten thousand measures, and unified the myriad rhythms. He stirred the hundred yang to generate lightning and moved the thousand yin to unleash might. Divine auroras draped the Dao over the Golden Tower, and the Celestial Pass responded to resonance, opening of itself. He commanded the Eight Radiant Ones to ascend, spurred the Divine Tiger to take flight, and the host of immortals cleared the path while the Seven Stars hastened in motion. Mystic light dimmed and stagnated, transforming in myriad wondrous ways. Gazing into the boundless, he surveyed the edges of the heavens, casting his eyes upon the Five Turbidities and lamenting the suffering of life and death. Truly, how subtle is the marvel of the Numinous North!

The Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity addressed the Prime Minister, the Azure Youth, and the Lord of the Western City, saying: *"The Supreme Clarity’s Great Wisdom Scripture for Vanquishing Demons is the Jade Scroll of the Supreme Ultimate, the supreme treasure formula. Its divine verses are the treasured chapters of the Supreme Perfected of the Nine Heavens. Wisdom dispels impurity, vanquishing demons binds evil, and true talismans subdue demons. Those who possess jade tablets with purple names and cultivate the supreme method shall not be assailed by myriad specters or tested by ten thousand demons. Truly, no harm can befall them, no trial can touch them—such is the might of the Divine Tiger and the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now I entrust it to you, to transmit to future disciples who are destined to become perfected beings."*

In accordance with the statutes of the Supreme Perfected, within seven hundred years, transmission may be granted thrice, but it must not be shown to the unworthy. Should the true scripture be recklessly revealed, the offender shall suffer the torment of the Wind Blade, and calamity shall extend to the seven generations of their ancestors. If one bears a golden name from the Eastern Florescence and a verdant inscription of the Supreme Clarity, upon receiving this talisman, thirty-six jade lads and jade maidens shall attend and guard their person. With this, they may traverse perilous trials, cross mountains and seas, summon spirits and subdue ghosts, and command the sacred peaks. Wherever they go, a thousand demons shall prostrate at their side, ten thousand evil spirits shall be bound in form, and hosts of immortals shall serve as their guard, their body radiating wondrous light. If they cultivate for less than seven years, the true spirits shall descend to their chamber, and they shall ascend in broad daylight upon a flying chariot with green canopy.

The recipient must observe a fast for ninety days, or thirty days, or seventy days, and offer ten taels of refined gold as a token of faith to the divine perfected, ninety feet of brocade to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens, and thirty feet of azure silk to pledge their heart. Those who cherish the Dao and delight in truth, who diligently focus their minds on the mysteries, who do not begrudge wealth but value the Dao above all—such is the kind of person with whom this may be shared. The Dao abides with them. But those who inwardly covet riches and outwardly indulge in frivolous desires—the Dao has already discerned them. Seal the scripture within a jade coffer, lock it with a golden bolt, and after their ascension, conceal it deep within a sacred mountain.

Wear the talisman of the Divine Tiger, inscribed in yellow upon an azure ground. When traversing the Five Peaks, or when in the midst of peril and misfortune, or in places haunted by ghosts and demons, one must invoke the mighty divine incantation, striking the left teeth thirty-six times, and recite:

*"Mysterious sound of the Nine Heavens, harmonious node of the Ox,
Governing the hidden and vast, opening the divine hundred blossoms,
Transcending stagnation without trace, the Three Baskets’ net of waves,
Revolving purity to fill the radiance, pearls dense as woven sands,
Cinnabar brilliance commands life, secret pears of kalpas past,
Containing light to illumine the depths, ascending to fill the house,
Bo Le rides the formless, wielding the whip to tame heavenly demons,
Regulating and severing their lineage, annihilating their forms in the Nine Nets,
The tiger transforms with divine might, seizing and subduing the myriad evils,
Slaying without distinction great or small, all perish,
Demons vanish with the light of time, disasters extinguish in grand harmony,
Riding the radiance to wield the void, ascending upon flying clouds,
Entering and departing the imperial court, eternally preserving the numinous stem."*

When finished, swallow the qi thirty-six times and cease.

Without receiving the Divine Tiger’s supreme talisman, one must not recklessly speak this incantation. This invocation comprises the inner taboo names of the great demons of the Nine Heavens. A single recitation shakes the Nine Heavens, binds the forms of ten thousand ghosts, blinds a thousand spirits, and summons a hundred gods to court. Those who speak it without receiving it shall lose their souls and forfeit their spirits. The incantation for vanquishing demons of the Supreme Perfected is likewise—take heed and be cautious.

There are also the Demon-Vanquishing Talisman and the Divine Tiger’s Talisman within the *Scripture for Vanquishing Demons*, all of which are the hidden sounds of the Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens. When wearing the talisman and reciting the incantation, it is best to consume one as well.

On the first day of the seventh month in the third year of the Xingning reign (the year *yichou*), Master Tongbo transmitted this to Xu Yuanyou. He declared that in the years *jiashen*, *yihai*, *renchen*, and *guisi*, on the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month, there shall appear a Daoist clad in seven-colored ritual robes, holding a nine-curved staff, either at a sacred altar or among the people, begging or chanting scriptures, or singing wild songs. If you encounter such a one, earnestly seek their teachings, and they shall surely bestow upon you the supreme talisman of the Divine Tiger. This is the Perfected One of the Southern Peak, whom the Most High regularly dispatches to the mortal realm to observe the hearts of those who cultivate the Dao.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Golden Scroll and Tiger Talisman of the Supreme Perfected of the Cavern of Truth*.
