**Highest Clarity Scripture of the Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise**

The Primordial Elder of the Great Clarity, the Nine Heavens’ Upright Qi, and the Spontaneous Cavernous Void True Writ were expounded by the Jade Emperor within the Azure Radiance and Kingfisher-Feathered Jade Capital of Mount Hua’s grotto-chamber. At that very moment, forty million myriad Jade Lads and ninety million myriad Jade Maidens spread golden mats upon the ground and fashioned couches of white jade. The Heavenly Worthy descended, seated upon a golden mat, while all the divine immortals and spirit-kings knelt in reverence and inquired of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Emperor:

"We humbly hear that the Most High and all the sagely ones chant the jade verses of the Mysterious Hymns, their luminous cinnabar blossoms and lush jade hues resplendent. Phoenix-riders and dragon-chariots come to welcome the Capital’s August Thearch, joining in the Nine Shao and the Great Harmony’s numinous hymns. The Cavernous Void’s inscribed true writs elucidate the Register of the Primordial Heaven upon Mount Tortoise, and the Nine Heavens’ Grotto-Chambers’ Jade Void True Kings command the banners of demonic spirits.

On the *bing*-day of the *yin*-month of the thirty-second heaven, clouds drifted and rain descended, moistening the world below. A hundred grasses sprouted in unison, jade-bright trees bore verdant branches and crimson blossoms. With the seven treasures and three luminaries of the fragrant gardens, fruit groves, and gemstone forests, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, the Highest Clarity Jade Lads, and the True Florescence Jade Maidens, within the nectar groves and jade chambers, transformed and enlightened all beings.

The jade registers of the azure radiance of ministers and sovereigns, the officials of the ten directions, the divine immortals and great sages, and the hundred demon-kings soared through the empty void, their flying jade-cloud chariots covering heaven and earth. Drawn by twelve hundred mysterious dragons, with thunder, lightning, and thunderclaps, their radiance illuminated the ten directions as they descended into our chamber, kneeling in homage and chanting praises.

The incense and blossoms of all heavens resounded in unison, their jade-like chimes and coral gems harmonizing naturally. The celestial musicians, the three lights of the seven treasures, and the hundred harmonies of fragrant sounds delighted and rejoiced together.

The Nine Heavens’ demonic spirits, deviant essences, and celestial emperors were summoned to attend beside the throne. Flying cloud-feather canopies, twelve silk banners, and the insignia of standards, banners, and drums were arrayed before the seats, and all heavens offered praise.

The twelve Heavenly Worthies and the host of divine immortals and orthodox officials each intoned the verses of the Cavernous Numinous Jade Treasure’s Three Primordials:

*Swift winds lift the light canopy,*
*Ten sages follow the Worthy in roaming.*
*Cloud-script harmonizes with the spirit-banner,*
*The purple chariot floats upon the luminous qi.*
*The Heavenly Worthies of Great Clarity,*
*Alight upon the Jade Capital’s peaks.*
*Divine immortals sport in celestial music,*
*A hundred tones spontaneously resound.*
*Together they rejoice in dancing cloud-florescence,*
*All the perfected ones delight—who can describe it?*
*Jade and seven treasures in the forest,*
*Chanting praises, they wish to share the same vessel.*
*All heavens chant the Brahmanic tones,*
*Faintly soaring at the clouds’ edge.*
*The host of sages sing the numinous melody,*
*Jade maidens chant the mysterious joy.*
*Together they wander the Queen Mother’s chamber,*
*Lingering in the Jade Hall’s contemplation.*
*The jade-florescence essence of all immortals,*
*Gleams brighter than orchids and magnolias.*
*Cinnabar radiance shines with solar essence,*
*Stirring my heart to hesitation.*
*Immortals recite the Thearch’s verses—*
*This joy cannot be matched by counsel.*
*Green pools rinse in clear streams,*
*Kunlun’s treasure groves gleam resplendent.*
*Soaring, the host of dragons takes flight,*
*Luminous upon the purple cloud-altar.*
*At dusk they wander Mount Penglai’s peaks,*
*At dawn they face the brilliance of Hua’s radiance.*
*Divine immortals roam the cinnabar leaves,*
*Flowing splendor entrusted to literary elegance.*
*The true writs inscribed in vermilion.*
*Eleven northern talismans, purple earth and azure day.*

The Highest Clarity’s Nine Elders’ Cavernous Numinous Treasure True Merit and the Flying Cinnabar Radiance, the Nine Elders’ Supreme Sage Lords’ numinous responses, and the Jade Capital’s Thearch of the Empty Capital’s Jade Mountain’s canon—on the seventh day of the first month of the first year of the *Zhangren* era in the *Shangjia* epoch, within the Seven Treasures’ Jade Grove Chamber of the Chaos Terrace, the Three Primordials’ Jade Emperor commanded the writs of the Nine Heavens to be conferred upon the Cinnabar Elder and the Nine Thearchs of the True Lords. None may gather disorderly persons to view them indiscriminately, falsely claiming them as highest perfected ones. All must follow the statutes and uphold the command.

To the right, within the Cavern-Numinous Upper Clarity Tortoise Mountain’s Primordial Void Purple Hall Golden Chamber, the stone tablets of efflorescent jade bear the inscribed true writ: the records of divine officials and sagely troops, the proper ranks of upper offices, the messengers of the Middle Prime, jade maidens and immortal lads, heavenly kings and perfected spirits, the supreme eight radiance three divisions generals, direct-attending officials, flying dragon mounts, the three primes’ perfected officials, and the primordial jade immortals—all in accordance with the statutes of the Mysterious Canon.

Be diligent and cautious, most cautious indeed.

**The Supreme Cavern Writ of Tortoise Mountain’s True Talisman**
This talisman, when ingested for nine years and visualized with eyes closed for a day and a night, shall reveal the celestial immortals of the Nine Heavens riding dragons and phoenixes, soaring through the Purple Void, ascending to Jade Capital, where the self merges with the Dao.
Guard this well, be cautious.

These twenty-five talismans are inscribed in azure upon a pink ground.

The August Primordial First Unity’s Dao, the Nine Heavens’ Great Dao of the Emperor’s natural luminous script, the original text of the Supreme Florescence engraved upon stone—within the Tortoise Mountain chamber dwell the twenty-four immortal officials. The Upper Prime Lord is titled the Tortoise Mountain Messenger, accompanied by twenty-four jade maidens, immortal lads, and divine persons, the perfected immortals of the Supreme Mystery Capital Jade Capital. This is the scripture of the Supreme Sage’s Purple Phoenix Vermilion Writ Cinnabar Radiance Jade Text, emerging from the Cavern Radiance Towering Wind’s Void. You, having obtained it within the Tortoise Mountain cavern, sealed it within the Yellow Emperor’s Jade Florescence Central Void Jasper Terrace, guarded by the Five Arms. On the seventh day of the seventh month in the jiaxu year of the Great Epoch, it was revealed upon Phoenix Mountain’s Kun Terrace within the Golden Gate Jade Portal, bestowed upon the Supreme August Purple Tenuity Lady, who commanded its transmission to those of later generations destined for immortality. Whoever receives and upholds it shall surely ascend in broad daylight amidst clouds, with the host of immortals as companions, beholding the Supreme Sages and attaining the rank of Perfected Lord and Upper Immortal. The transmission follows the statutes and ordinances of the Mysterious Canon.
