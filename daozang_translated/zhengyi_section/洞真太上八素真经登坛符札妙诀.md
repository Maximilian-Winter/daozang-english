*The Supreme Cavern-Perfected Scripture of the Eight Simplicities: Esoteric Instructions for Mounting the Altar, Talismans, and Petitions*

The Supreme Lord addresses the Celestial Thearchs, the Sagely Sovereigns of Later Ages, the Azure Lad of the Supreme Ministers, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, saying: All later students who obtain the precious scriptures of the Great Cavern of the Supreme Perfected—inscribed in golden characters by the Eastern Florescence and recorded in the Highest Clarity—have already cultivated good karmic roots, their merit and honor difficult to surpass. Yet if they do not seek a master to receive the oral instructions, ascend the altar, and cultivate the practice, but merely recite and study without fathoming the source, their efforts will be in vain. Worse, they may invite demonic interference, incur the offense of secretly possessing scriptures, and forfeit any hope of ascending as immortals. Those of sincere aspiration must diligently follow the regulations and submit to a master, receiving the sacred charge to attain the utmost perfection.

Herein are set forth the rites of covenant and revelation, to be transmitted with utmost care—let them never be lightly disclosed. The Celestial Thearchs and all the sagely perfected, in unison, proclaim their approval, bowing their heads in reverence to the command.

In all covenants and revelations to the spirits, each has its rank and grade. Whether dwelling in mountain forests or the world of mortals, the tokens of faith differ; the days of fasting and assembly vary in number; the submission of petitions and dissolution of the retreat depend on the individual. The progression of master and disciple broadly follows the essentials of this secret Dao.

The treasured mysteries of heaven and earth, concealed and profound, are not to be transmitted to the divine perfected of the various spirits, nor should they be heard, seen, spoken of, or employed by ordinary men, unlearned novices, or those of meager talent. Only when the world attains Great Peace and worthy ones emerge shall they not be withheld.

Those who obtain the precious scriptures encounter manifold complexities. To summarize the essentials, the causes arise in seven ways:
First, through the radiant numinous forms of spirits, their voices and appearances descending...
Second, through encounters with good people, dwelling in mountain caverns in ease and harmony;
Third, through leisurely wandering or accidental discovery in public or private settings...

Fourth, through entering markets or courts, where others come to trade;
Fifth, through ignorance of ritual statutes, secretly grasping at its solemn forms;
Sixth, through single-minded reverence for a master, receiving instruction and transmission;
Seventh, through family ancestors, passing it down through generations.

These seven conditions may occur separately or in combination, varying in rank and circumstance, each with its own covenantal rites—transmission by a master being central.

The proper procedures are as follows:

Ascend the Jade Clarity Imperial Altar to pledge vows and transmit the scriptural instructions. The altar shall be twenty-four feet in length and breadth, with four corner gates. Five-colored patterned silks, one bolt each for the five directions; ninety feet of purple silk; ninety feet of azure gauze; nine taels of gold; forty feet of life-destiny silk; five seating mats; one golden fish and one jade dragon; one jade tablet, twelve inches long and two inches four-tenths wide; five ritual boards for the Five Agents; three talismans; five incense fires; one crimson silk kerchief, five feet long; one foot of white silk; one gold ring; five luminous mirrors; fifteen feet of white silk for inscribing the covenant text; the covenant document bound with blue silk and a gold clasp, with twenty feet of crossed sashes in purple and damask patterns.

The earth-altar shall be of plain silk, matching the imperial altar in dimensions—twenty-four feet in length and breadth—with four corner gates. Five taels of gold shall be placed above, with nine feet of white silk as sashes and three feet two inches of purple silk.

On the day before the transmission, the recipient shall fast at the altar site. Facing north, he shall knock his teeth nine times and pray aloud:

“Supreme Primordial Sovereign, Numinous Honored One of the Nine Heavens, the Most Real in the distant and profound Jade Pavilion—guided by the revolutions of the Three and Five, the dawns of the Seven Luminaries shifting, the Void Emperor holding the reins, the Jade Emperor determining immortality—on this day of primal auspiciousness, the myriad perfected open the way. Those who ascend to the ranks of the celestial stems, bound by karmic destiny, encounter the divine scriptures, the treasured scrolls of the Supreme Sovereign. Humbly, upon this sacred peak, I pledge vows to the Nine Heavens, petition the Five Emperors and the Twelve River Sources, beseeching registration and receipt. May my plea ascend to the lofty court, universally proclaimed to the ten thousand spirits. Here, upon the imperial altar, defenses are arrayed to dispel trials, following the precedents of the Great Perfected. Tomorrow, at the appointed hour, the transmission shall proceed.”

At dawn on the day of ascension, thirty paces from the altar, the recipient shall knock his teeth thirty-two times, envisioning purple clouds crowning a mountain and the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors—thousands upon thousands—coming to welcome his person. He shall softly intone:

“The divine perfected roam forth, startling the myriad emperors. The Jade Numinous Mystic Guardians, the wardens of the Five Peaks, the Celestial Soldiers and Mighty Warriors—ten thousand strong—assist the numinous. Summoned from the ten directions, marshaling the heavenly hosts, they descend from the heavens to the imperial court. May I ascend as an immortal, penetrating the essence of the Dao. May I discern the inauspicious, traverse the hidden, and fathom the obscure. All that I face and declare shall align with the Jade Clarity.”

This completed, he shall ascend the altar.

The master enters from the northwest, facing northwest to perform nine bows toward the Nine Heavenly Kings, knocking his teeth nine times. He shall softly declare:

“Today, I transmit the Nine Heavens’ Treasured Scripture to Disciple Wang Ding, extending to the Jade Taboo. Having fasted and purified, his qi and destiny harmonize with the Real. I beseech the oversight of the Perfected Immortals and the Jade Taboo. May the Registrar Attendant and the Guardian Marshal of the Numinous descend to witness the covenant in heaven. May all that is petitioned and entrusted swiftly ascend for audience.”

This completed, he turns to the southeast, bows again, and declares:

“Supreme Primordial Heaven, today I offer the Eight Assemblies’ vows. On this auspicious day and pure hour, humbly upon this sacred peak, I pledge vows to transmit the supreme scripture. I beseech the divine immortals of the Five Emperors to oversee my covenant, that I may swiftly attain immortality, ascend in a flying chariot, and rise to the imperial court.”

The disciple enters from the southeast below the altar, performs nine bows to the northwest, then two bows to the southeast. Turning north to face the master, he knocks his teeth thirty-six times, first reciting the *Golden Perfected Great Void Chapter* once to subdue the myriad demons.

This chapter derives from the *Golden Perfected Jade Radiance Scroll*. Without receiving the *Supreme Clarity Jade Radiance*, one may not recite this text.

The celestial essence rides the void, startling the divine court.
Entrusted to the immortal’s chant, it transforms into the nameless.
How tumultuous the clamorous qi, the defiled Dao arising along the path!
Within the clouds, the Crimson Palace; the Northern Emperor deploys his divine soldiers.
The drum resounds from the ocean of wisdom, the mysterious workings come to welcome.
The lofty scenes feast upon flying reins, swift chariots inspect the cloud encampments.
Hastening to collate the Northern Emperor’s register, seizing the names of the demonic hordes.
The *Huoluo* unfurls the celestial net, wielding might to cast the ringing bells.
Now the perfected capture the empty cavern, the jade radiance illuminating the eight darknesses.
The Golden Mystery guards the supreme palace, the divine tiger slays the celestial essence.
Severing the myriad demonic qi, billions upon billions all leveled.
Upholding the trust of the Nine Heavens, all is overthrown at my whistled command.
Summoning the perfected to fathom the Three Caverns, wisdom recitation clears the eyes.
Gazing upon the eight paths of the mysterious radiance, seven revolutions weave the celestial scriptures.
Merging with the imperial unity of the Real, delivering the seven generations of ancestors.
Eradicating the roots of the five sufferings, the returned soul receives renewed glory.
The golden radiance shines upon the quiescent, the divine candle naturally kindles.
Fragrant blossoms scatter in the jade palace, misty qi penetrates the Jade Capital.
The Emperor dispatches the lingering chariot, the Three Origins descend in green carriages.
Swift chariots soar through the Nine Mysteries, paying homage at the Jade Emperor’s court.”

Upon completing the *Great Void Chapter*, the disciple faces east, knocks his teeth thirty-six times, and intones:

“Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin, Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within my person the Void-and-Spontaneous Flying Immortal Attendants, the Divine Immortal Envoys, the Left and Right Flying Dragons, the Great Perfected Jade Maidens, and the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors—thirty-six each—to report to the local earth deities and true officials. As I now burn incense, may my petition swiftly reach the boundless Jade Emperor and the Most High Perfected before the myriad sages.”

This completed, he faces north, knocks his teeth twenty-four times, and exits the *Supreme Clarity Office*.

Without receiving the *Supreme Clarity Three Origins Jade Inspection*, one may not exit this office.

“Reverently, I summon from within my person:
The Void-and-Spontaneous Left and Right Jade Void Attendants, twenty-four each;
The Void-and-Spontaneous Five Emperors of the Great Perfected, twenty-four each;
The Void-and-Spontaneous Left and Right Jade Immortal-Guiding Attendants, twenty-four each;
The Nine Mysteries’ Void-and-Spontaneous Flying Dragon Attendants, twenty-four each;
The Upper Origin Attendants, twenty-four each;
The Middle Origin Attendants, twenty-four each;
The Lower Origin Attendants, twenty-four each;
The *Supreme Clarity Jade Void* Flying Immortal Envoys, twenty-four each;
The Divine Immortal Envoys, twenty-four each;

The Middle Origin Envoys, twenty-four each;
The Lower Origin Envoys, twenty-four each;
The *Jade Clarity Golden Dawn* Jade Lads, twenty-four each;
The *Jade Clarity Great Florescence* Jade Maidens, twenty-four each.”

Those who emerge do so with solemn dignity, clad in immortal robes, their majesty and decorum perfectly composed as they stand arrayed before the minister.

The Jade Void Attendant Ministers wear soaring-dark-jade crowns, robes of nine-colored dragon-patterned tiger-skins, and wield the Banner of Commanding Demons, standing to the left.

The Five Thearchs’ Supreme Perfected wear Primordial Dawn Jade Crowns, five-colored flying-immortal feathered robes, and nine-colored pennants, standing to the right.

The Flying Dragon Attendants wear Level-Heaven Jade Crowns, nine-colored phoenix robes, tiger-script belts, and hold the Talismans of Summoning Spirits, positioned above.

The Three Origins Attendants wear Nine Origins Vermilion Yang Jade Crowns, three-colored feathered robes, belts of flowing-gold fire-bells, and wield the Statutes of Seizing and Slaying, standing below.

The Flying Immortal Envoys wear Soaring Heaven Jade Crowns, nine-colored variegated-patterned robes, and hold golden talismans with banners raised before them.

The Divine Immortal Envoys wear Vermilion Yang Jade Crowns, flying-immortal feathered robes, jade tablets in hand, and bear standards behind them.

all these divine immortal troops and cavalry assemble and encamp, stationed before, behind, left, and right of the minister, arrayed in ordered ranks.

Spontaneous Five Thearchs’ flying wheels and flowing mists, nine hundred million myriad layers;
Five-colored flying jade-feather canopies, nine hundred million myriad layers;
Five Peaks’ five-colored flying carriages, nine hundred million myriad layers—
envelop the minister’s form, streaming essence and dispersing qi, filling the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, guarding and protecting the minister’s body.

Once the solemn proceedings conclude, the feathered-node-bearing flying immortal jade lads hold aloft jade tables suspended in the void, positioned before the minister, receiving the words from the minister’s mouth to distinguish and report to the celestial officials, earth deities, and gods of the four directions, central quarters, ten directions, Five Peaks, Four Waterways, Nine Rivers, Eight Poles, famous mountains, great marshes, Five Thearchs’ Perfected Officials, Four Departments’ Inspectors, Nine Divisions’ Examiners and Summoners, Primordial Qi’s *Jiazi* Official Lords, boundless, measureless, depthless, heightless, fathomless, obscure or manifest, innumerable Perfected Officials; infusing qi into the Qian Sovereign’s Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams, Six *Jia* Perfected Ones; the Void’s Direct Servants, Five Peaks’ Flying Immortals, divine dragon feathered cavalry.

The qi ascends to report to the Primordial Origin August Supreme High Void Jade Emperor, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One;
the Primordial Origin Three Heavens’ Jade Lads, Supreme Numinous Perfected Kings;
the Highest Myriad Immortals’ Fusang Great Emperor;
the Supreme Great Dao Jade Dawn Lord;

the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Supreme Venerable One;
the Heavenly Elder Emperor Lord;

the Nine Qi Venerable One;
the Boundless Supreme Unity Emperor Lord—
and the hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao-qi, the twelve hundred official lords, the Supreme Clarity Jade Steps’ Celestial Immortals, Divine Immortals, Flying Immortals, Five Thearchs’ Immortal Lords, Great Florescence Perfected Ones.

The minister, by karmic affinity and accumulated blessings, has endured the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, revolving without extinction, favored by fortune to be born into the Dharma-gate. Formerly, through the grace of former sagely perfected ones, he was uplifted and guided, his ignorance dispelled, and the supreme methods revealed to him—the Great Secrets of the Nine Heavens, the Three Caverns’ Treasured Scriptures, Jade Talismans, Numinous Writings, Cinnabar Scripts in Purple Characters, Flying Void Step Chapters—ascending the imperial altar to report and command the Nine Heavens. Over the years, as celestial cycles shifted and the imperial Dao’s destiny unfolded, the Dharma was to be transmitted to later disciples, those with predestined immortal names and destined for transcendence. The numinous texts are secret and weighty; they dare not be withheld, nor lightly transmitted. According to the stipulated time limits, should the kalpas turn, even the most devoted scholars might forever lack the affinity, their aspirations cut off, their efforts in vain. Yet when the Primordial Origin opens the transformation, it is rare to encounter the right person—thus, by the principles of the mysterious statutes, when the encounter aligns, the transmission is granted.

Now there is the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of *Jia* clan, whose accumulated blessings and surplus fortune have met with this era of flourishing prosperity. By karmic good fortune, he was born in this sagely age, favored by the Supreme to have his name inscribed in the imperial records, to partake in the great Dharma, and to recite the Jade Scriptures. Over the years, he has cast aside worldly attachments, forgotten his shadow, and entrusted his aspirations to secluded peaks, calming his spirit in mountain caves, contemplating the numinous and meditating on qi. Yet his understanding remains shallow and narrow, and he has not yet mastered all matters. Now, he again approaches the minister, observing a seven-day purification fast, submitting his vows and oaths, seeking completion and establishment. He erects the imperial altar, reports to the Nine Heavens, and receives the Supreme Clarity’s Treasured Secrets and Jade Scriptures—all such matters as required. With faith and oaths fully prepared, all in accordance with the statutes and methods, the minister then escorts him to ascend the numinous mountain, reporting to the Five Peaks and Five Thearchs, and announcing to the Nine Heavens to transmit the teachings to him.

He pledges to observe silence in his practice, never to be negligent, never to reveal the true texts, nor to violate the statutes or transgress the precepts. Should he do so, his seven generations of ancestors will be examined, and his own person will be delivered to the ghostly officials.

Having examined his conduct and guarded the statutes, his person shall attain to flight as an immortal. With reverence, this is reported, and the transmission must be conferred with due ceremony.

Upon exiting the official precinct, the master administers the covenant, the taboo names, and the scriptures and talismans. The master stands facing north, holding the scripture in his left hand. He knocks his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the Most High Jade Emperor, causing the light of sun and moon to flank and illuminate both master and disciple. He recites the incantation:

How vast and distant is the Great Subtlety,
True persons bind their lives to emptiness.
The celestial ford naturally opens,
Assembling the Great Cavern Scripture.
True worthies uphold the Dharma with faith,
Riding the cycles through the Yellow Court.
Guard its secrecy through kalpas of years—
Should one reveal it carelessly, hell’s torments await,
With scourging extended to seven generations of ancestors,
And wind-knives to dissect your very form.

The master holds the scripture in his left hand, while the disciple holds the pledge in his right. Together, they face heaven and softly intone:

Issuing from the Four Poles’ luminous statutes,
We report above to the Lofty Mysterious,
To the myriad emperors of the Void and Subtle.
In this world, we vow to hold fast without wavering.
Dare we report to the luminous statutes,
To examine all transgressions.
The Jade Scripture and Treasured Secrets
Are all as the statutes’ majesty decrees.
After the transmission of this body,
All qi shall be wholly returned.
May we long preserve Heaven and Earth,
With the Three Luminaries shining as one.
Should any dare to reveal them,
They shall forever forfeit the Four Transgressions.

This done, the disciple places the pledge to receive the scripture, bowing nine times toward the north. The disciple presents the pledge of the Dharma, and the master accepts the token. The disciple points with his left hand to the northwest, receives the scripture with his right, then turns to the southeast, standing with his back to the west. Proceeding southward in order, he takes the Heavenly Gate, and buries the talisman to erase his traces.

If both the purple and plain silk sashes are to be received together, before turning south, the purple and plain may be separated, as there are separate rites for each.

The master stands at the northeast, knocks his teeth thirty-six times, and raises his gaze to pray:

The Nine Heavens’ Cavernous Radiance,
The Mysterious Talismans shine brightly.
Above, one studies the celestial stems,
Clad in refined qi-essence.
Selected as the August Minister,
One connects with the myriad spirits.
The Jade Emperor oversees the position,
Attending the divine court of immortals.
The Three Palaces of Fengdu
Examine and restrain demonic soldiers.
The Four Offices and Five Emperors
Execute and destroy Jia Sheng.
Brightly overseeing the Nine Treasuries,
They strike out the celestial stem names.
Soaring in transformation, concealing the body,
One borrows the earth to hide the form,
With a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries,
And the Nine Origins merging as one.

This done, he takes twenty-four single steps to the disciple’s rear, at the Earthly Door, and recites another incantation:

Treading the Five Peaks,
One grasps the Mysterious Mechanism.
Soaring through the Nine Voids,
Exiting the hidden, entering the subtle,
Lightly pacing the cloud steps,
Swiftly transforming with radiant speed,
The Golden Perfected shines with light,
The Heavenly Pass brightly opens.
Clad in the Emperor’s insignia,
Flying in azure feathered robes,
The Five Spirits oversee and illuminate,
Departing without delay or hindrance,
For kalpas of eons,
Forever parting from worldly separation.

This done, he buries the *Soaring Heaven Concealment Talisman* beneath the disciple’s left foot. The disciple then takes twenty-four single steps to the southwest corner, standing at the Human Door, and prays:

Dissolving the form at the August Altar,
Transforming traces to enter the void,
Erasing the luminous shadow at the numinous peak,
Swiftly traversing the Great Void,
Soaring through heaven, borrowing the earth,
Merging with the ten directions,
Closing what cannot be opened,
Severing what cannot be turned,
The Most High Jade Emperor,
Great King of the Nine Heavens,
Having overseen the divine illumination,
Shall forever receive worldly reverence.
We report the covenant at the August Altar,
Passing beyond the numinous peaks,
Shedding traces from the Three Paths,
Ascending to the Jade Capital.

This done, he buries the *Borrowing Earth Dissolving Form Talisman* beneath the disciple’s right foot. Next, he takes thirty-nine single steps to the northwest corner, standing at the Heavenly Gate. The master recites another incantation:

Setting forth from the Earthly Door,
Clouds traverse the Heavenly Gate.
Three revolutions, nine refinements,
The luminous Dao alone divides.
Reporting the covenant at the numinous peaks,
Riding the cycles, turning the wheel,
Jade chariots linger,
Reining the clouds, holding the reins,
The Five Mornings flank the clouds,
Surveying the shadows of the Seven Origins.
Dissolving the form, borrowing the earth,
Clad above in the Three Passes,
Paying homage at the Golden Gates,
Abiding with the Emperor forever.

This done, he buries the *Soaring Heaven Talisman* at the left trace and the *Borrowing Earth Talisman* at the right trace.

The rites completed, the master and disciple stand at the Gate of the Nine Heavens. With azure silk binding the golden clasp, they report to the numinous and depart, exiting through the northwest Gate of the Nine Heavens. The disciple, upon exiting, takes the fish and dragon and casts them into the mountain crags. Facing due north, he knocks his teeth nine times and reports his covenant to the Nine Heavens, reciting the incantation:

The Great Morning’s Mysterious Removal,
The Nine Mysterious’ profound secrecy,
Vermilion radiance oversees and illuminates,
The myriad spirits refine their essences.
The Three Cycles shift and change,
The moon revolves, the sun circuits.
At this time, we open and declare,
With primal felicity and auspiciousness.
Ascending the altar’s lofty peak,
Concealing in the luminous grotto,
Above, we pledge to the Nine Heavens,
In the center, we open the Eternal One,
Below, we report to the numinous mountains,
Forever completing the myriad spirits.
Lightly transmitting the world’s treasures,
Forever parting from the Seven Mysteries.
Should one violate the master or betray the covenant,
Form and shadow shall be destroyed,
Suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments,
For ten thousand kalpas, never to escape.
Having examined the covenant text,
We inscribe the name on the Jade Tablet,
Praying for swift ascension and transmission,
Soaring in body to the Emperor’s chambers.

This done, he casts the objects into the mountain crags.

The two talismans—inscribed in azure on white silk—are buried at the Heavenly Gate, beneath the recipient’s two traces. At the Earthly Door, the *Soaring Heaven Talisman* is buried beneath the disciple’s left foot. At the Human Door, the *Borrowing Earth Talisman* is buried beneath the disciple’s right trace. The disciple places the *Life-Stabilizing Silk* over his original destiny, with the *Five Emperors’ Silk* of corresponding colors placed at the five directions, and the covenant pledge placed at the center. The *Five Covenant Mirrors* stabilize the Five Emperors, restraining the heavenly demons. Without these stabilizing silks, the spirits of the Five Peaks will not accept the disciple’s covenant.

The Perfected Lord of the Western City copied the essential statutes of the *Great Perfection* at Yangluo, passing through the Lady of the Southern Peak. Only the *Soaring Heaven* and *Borrowing Earth* talismans are transmitted orally, their secrets passed mouth to mouth. For receiving this method, there are separate covenant statutes in the *Great Perfection* texts.

When the master ascends the altar, he should present the *Five Emperors’ Petitioning Talismans*, using the disciple’s pledge to stabilize the five directions, covenanting with the Nine Heavens and pledging to the Five Spirits. A five-chi scarlet silk kerchief is placed before him to invite the scripture. The master faces north to read the taboo names of transmission, while the disciple faces east, prostrating to receive them. When the covenant rites are completed, the disciple faces north, bows nine times, and kneels nine times, then raises his head to swallow the nine qi. This done, he departs.

The master should bury the golden fish, jade dragon, and jade tablet in a sheer cliff. As he buries them, he faces north, knocks his teeth thirty-six times, and softly recites the incantation:

The Eight Luminaries of Heaven’s Origin, the Nine Mysteries seal the Perfected, the Three Radiances align with the appointed time—on this day, the offerings are set forth, the Celestial Thearch receives and heeds, the command is proclaimed to the numinous mountains, the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the Twelve River Sources. Record the disciple’s name in the registers, that he may forever attain immortality, sit awaiting the dragon carriage, ride the flying chariot amid purple mist, ascend to the heights, and pay court to the Jade Dawn.

This done, bury the fish, dragon, and tablet in the Dark Valley.

The Nine Heavens proclaim the command to the Eastern Peak’s Azure Numinous Myriad Immortals Palace, charging its guardians to shield Master So-and-so’s person as he ascends the covenant, receives the transmission of the Perfected, and is recorded in the Azure Palace. Bowing and rising, dispatch the Nine White Thearch Immortal Officers to attend and serve, to welcome him as one entrusted with the Nine Heavens’ pledge.

Inscribe this in cinnabar on a wooden board, place it facing south to guard the Eastern Peak’s numinous officials, with nine attending immortal officers in service.

The Nine Heavens proclaim the command to the Southern Peak’s Vermilion Numinous Myriad Immortals Palace, charging its guardians to shield Master So-and-so’s person as he ascends the covenant, receives the transmission of the Perfected, and is recorded in the Azure Palace. Bowing and rising, dispatch the Nine Red Thearch Immortal Officers to attend and serve, to welcome him as one entrusted with the Nine Heavens’ pledge.

Inscribe this in white on a wooden board, place it facing west to guard the Western Peak’s numinous officials, with nine attending immortal officers in service.

The Nine Heavens proclaim the command to the Western Peak’s White Numinous Myriad Immortals Palace, charging its guardians to shield Master So-and-so’s person as he ascends the covenant, receives the transmission of the Perfected, and is recorded in the Azure Palace. Bowing and rising, dispatch the Nine White Thearch Immortal Officers to attend and serve, to welcome him as one entrusted with the Nine Heavens’ pledge.

Inscribe this in white on a wooden board, place it facing west to guard the Western Peak’s numinous officials, with nine attending immortal officers in service.

The Nine Heavens proclaim the command to the Northern Peak’s Black Numinous Myriad Immortals Palace, charging its guardians to shield Master So-and-so’s person as he ascends the covenant, receives the transmission of the Perfected, and is recorded in the Azure Palace. Bowing and rising, dispatch the Nine Black Thearch Immortal Officers to attend and serve, to welcome him as one entrusted with the Nine Heavens’ pledge.

Inscribe this in black on a wooden board, place it facing north to guard the Northern Peak’s numinous officials, with nine attending immortal officers in service.

The Nine Heavens proclaim the command to the Central Peak’s Yellow Numinous Myriad Immortals Palace, charging its guardians to shield Master So-and-so’s person as he ascends the covenant, receives the transmission of the Perfected, and is recorded in the Azure Palace. Bowing and rising, dispatch the Nine Yellow Thearch Immortal Officers to attend and serve, to welcome him as one entrusted with the Nine Heavens’ pledge.

Inscribe this in yellow on a wooden board, place it at the center to guard the Central Peak’s numinous officials, with nine attending immortal officers in service.

These five talismans are the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Sovereign’s decrees, the Proclamation Talismans to the Numinous Perfected. When ascending the Jade Clarity Imperial Altar, inscribe the talismans and position them according to the method. The master stands at the center to command the covenant of the Four Poles.

This done, bury the talismans at the Five Peaks.

For the Great Covenant Transmission, cast the golden dragon, jade fish, and jade tablet, with the text inscribed as follows:

On the first day of such-and-such a month in such-and-such a year, Master So-and-so of such-and-such a peak, aged so many years, born in such-and-such a month, his fate governed by such-and-such a Dipper and such-and-such an Imperial Lord, respectfully proclaims his oath to the Nine Heavens upon the sheer cliff of the Dark Peak’s lofty mountain. Having received the ninety-one fascicles of scripture, the *Luminous Ordinances of the Four Poles and Supreme Perfected*, and the *Ordinances of the Nine Heavens’ Registers*, he pledges to uphold the Dao and the Perfected, beseeching that his name be inscribed on the Purple Tablet and recorded in the Azure Palace. Should he violate this covenant or betray this oath, he dares not aspire to immortality.

Inscribe this in cinnabar on a jade tablet, one foot two inches in length and two inches four fen in width. When the reading is complete, bury it in the shadowed side of the sheer cliff.

Here ends the *Esoteric Ordinances of the Altar Talismans and Tablets of the Supreme Perfected’s Eight Pure Scriptures of the Cavernous Perfected*.
