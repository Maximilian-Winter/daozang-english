**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Sovereigns’ Invocation of the Hundred Spirits’ Inner Names**

Those who know the first names of the hundred spirits shall not die; those who constantly recite the invocation of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Sovereigns become immortals. When the adept completes the practices of Returning to the Origin, the Five Penetrations, the Eight Intervals, and the Twelve Vows, they shall read the names of the hundred spirits once to continue their affairs thereafter.

Three, five, seven, nine—immortal Dao is achieved;
The Primordial Cavern’s Eight Intervals congeal the Emperor’s form.
Above, the Twelve Heavens’ blessings arise;
This is the Return to the Origin, the hundred spirits’ illumination.
The Five Paths’ secret invocation preserves the Yellow Tranquility.
I know the hundred spirits attain eternal life;
May Heaven and immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity.
Blessings and prosperity naturally embrace true numen.
The Primordial Cavern’s Eight Intervals and the Feminine One’s essence,
Cherishing the *Great Cavern’s Lofty Scripture*,
The ancestral master unties the knots and receives the womb’s name.

Here ends the invocation of the hundred spirits’ names.

The Way of the Three, Five, Seven, Nine, and the Primordial Cavern’s Eight Intervals congealing the Emperor’s form—when twelve persons unite in vow, this is the oral transmission of the *Great Cavern*, the jade instructions of its thirty-nine chapters. Those who obtain it become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity; those who practice it become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity. Golden tablets are inscribed with feathered writ; jade slips are carved upon the cavern’s summit. The Celestial Emperor treasures its transformations; the Three Primes forbid its leakage.

Thus, in transmission:
For the superior fast, three hundred days;
For the middle fast, one hundred seventy days;
For the lesser fast, forty-five days.
Diligently refine the cinnabar heart in the dark instructions;
Suffer the five limbs in supplication.
The body labors in the master’s qi;
Seek resonance beyond the numinous Han.
Incense clouds thicken upon the sleeping mat;
Align and harmonize, sitting in the master’s chamber.
Thus, the true heart becomes luminous and penetrating;
Mysterious toil converges with the journey.
The obscure quest unfolds smoothly;
Only then is the true scripture bestowed.

The rites of fasting and offerings follow the *Great Cavern’s* methods.
On the day of receiving the text, they swear an oath in a separate chamber.
Should the jade scripture be leaked, seven generations of ancestors shall suffer the punishment of the wind-knife.

**The Supreme Lord’s Chant of Wisdom to Dissolve Demons**
After reading the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* ten times, one should read this *Chant to Dissolve Demons* once to repel the poisonous qi of the Nine Heavens and ward off the trials of the Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor.

The Four Supreme Lords of the Most High, attending the Jade Dawn Supreme Lord of the Great Dao on his left, the Great Dao Lord reposes in the Jade Void Chamber of Harmonious Dawn, the Golden Flower Chamber. Below, he registers the Nine Mysteries; to the right, he aids the Six Realms.

Then, the Perfected Attendant Simplified Life, the Jade Maiden of the Jade Clarity’s divine chamber, Fang Su, holding the incense of the Flying Qi of Vermilion Mound, bearing the divine chapters of the essential and mysterious, stands forth. The Supreme Dao Lord rinses with azure water, exhales crimson qi, empties the heart, stills the body, calms the spirit, and focuses upon the mysterious. Girded on the left with the Divine Tiger, on the right with the Golden Perfected, he recites the *Jade Scripture of Wisdom* and the *Supreme Chapters of the Dissolution of Demons*, along with the *Eight Mysteries and Nine Obscurities*, the *Seven Gates and Three Candles*, the *Sun’s Void and Moon’s Absence*. The upper script shines resplendent; a thousand truths halt their wheels; ten thousand spirits cease their steps. The empty sound ascends, stirring; the mysterious sprinkles a hundred blessings. Rare echoes soar and play; the cavern’s gold shines radiant. Above, it illumines the hidden and obscure; below, it brightens the crouching and concealed. The mysterious pattern flows and flourishes; the divine gaze is swift and keen. The Dao converges without bound; the subtle resonance awakens the obscure. The whirlwind’s qi extends into the void; dust and ruins accumulate in the realm. The mysterious reflection inwardly illuminates; the clear waves mirror the lucid. The Great Dao is distantly complete; flying light shines afar. Moving steps in the numinous chamber, startling waves drift in purity. Profoundly steadfast, without obscurity, gazing at the sun, they leap free. Transformation is not dull silence; change is not stagnant. Swift transformation soars in the yang; rare perching embodies luminous virtue. Serene and joyful, the twin gates return to awakening the principle’s subtlety. Tranquil and unadorned, the great image, shaking the bell, broadens the river. Darkly penetrating, the mysterious interflows; the principle’s subtlety connects the minute. Roaming and playing with the divine blade, floating and clarifying the great jade, they excite the hundred yang to generate lightning, drum the thousand yin to emit might. The Six Heavens lose their qi; the Nine Demons crumble and disperse. Grasping the sun, broadening the rosy clouds, ten thousand mists enter the bosom. At rest, they harmonize with Heaven and Earth; in motion, they equal the Seven Luminaries’ radiance. In the mysterious repose of the Dharma Hall, they empty and focus upon peril and peace. Shining brilliance flows like smoke; gathering the true, they embrace and perch. At Harmonious Dawn, the two absolutes intermingle; with a glance, the ten thousand Perfected spontaneously open.

Then, feet tread the Seven Degrees; hands hold the Heavenly Mechanism. The crown’s canopy is the mysterious celestial body; the two poles converge and withdraw. The River God is thereby breached; the Four Qi thereby flow and shift. The firm and mysterious, the bright jade, the Nine Rotations collapse. The numinous measure encircles and falls; the One Mystery returns and unites. The spirit is whole, emptily advancing; the wondrous resonance mysteriously soars. Those who can stir the Great Void from the constant, generate the host of winds from the latent subtlety, raise the Eight Luminaries to ascend, lift the flying reins upon the pure ridge, ride the phoenix carriage to gaze on high, release the cloud chariot to roam and gallop—such ones shall surely attain it.

Gazing upon the Nine Distances with radiant brilliance, ascending the Purple Heavens to halt the Crimson Light;
Delighting in the Seven Springs to harmonize qi, crowning the Azure Ford to pour into the Crimson Well.
Drifting mist and lightning flashes, with the wondrous body upright and limpid—
Empty spirit reveres the numinous, ascending the ladder of eternity.

The Vermilion Radiance now gleams; qi returns to the Mystic River.
Folding wings to observe transformation, soaring freely through the Void Net—
Myriad forms converge in reflection, flying wheels upon the Jade Slope.
Phoenixes cry and dragons leap; tigers roar and phoenixes sing.
A thousand echoes scatter like jade; countless gems bloom in disarray.
Jade chimes vibrate in the wind; crimson trees burst into blossom.

Thus, stirring harmony into ten thousand tones, flying melodies through a thousand measures—
The numinous pattern unfurls; cloud-unicorns reveal their essence.
Mysterious transformations flow at dawn; wondrous arts emerge at dusk.
Loosening the sash to wander in spirit, embracing the knees with mistletoe and blossoms—
Observing transformation without adornment, the Jade Mystery unadorned.
Upright and open, the empty current flows; carefree and luminous, the essence flourishes.
The Seven Luminaries endure eternally, neither forsaking nor prizing—
Dispelling harm and cold spirits, without burden or counterpart.
Revering the trust of the divine harmony, chanting songs of dark wisdom—
Seizing the heavens to prepare the liver; the lion steadies the lungs.
Scorching fire guards the soul; the copper-headed aligns the po.
Long fangs and pricked ears leap in reverse; the Lightning Father excites qi with twin bounds.
Baring teeth and drawing in feet, the Thunder Duke pounds and presses.
The Six ( ) camps gaze; the Five Tigers roar and snort.
Gripping blades to chase away evil; fierce beasts drive out filth.
Rushing qi and thunder essence guard life from falling.

Yet these marvels arise from human action; the Dao also aids life.
Scaling peaks to concentrate spirit, shaking free the towering crags—
Nine calamities dispel misfortune; thought and emotion dissolve.
Harmonizing the Eight Images, the Mystic Void’s qi is light.
The Seven Glances of the Lofty Empyrean bestow fragrant blossoms—
Vermilion and yellow, fiery and lush, flying mist and radiant spirit.
Cultivating and circulating true essence, scattering simplicity and fame—
Rinsing the taste of numinous brushstrokes, spirit levels the dawn’s clarity.
Wandering the Nine Heavens, the high chambers fragrant and dark—
Jade maidens hold incense; purple consorts cradle infants.
Irrigating the Celestial Pools with dew, scattering blossoms in the Jade Court—
Summoning the armored couriers, swiftly seizing the Heavenly Soldiers.
Poisonous dragons spew blades; divine tigers dispatch troops.
Externally entwined with Mystic qi, outwardly prepared with the Five Citadels—
The Dao unites all; relying on majesty to give life.
The true attains equal virtue; the Primordial qi then merges.

Thus, the Jade Purity’s dawn perfected—heart without empty shores—
Dwelling high beyond the worthy, embracing cinnabar amidst the clouds.
Extending to those of the Supreme Dao, containing brilliance and self-radiance—
Reaching those of the Supreme Virtue, savoring solitude and dark dispersal.
The Mystic does not seek the true; the sign does not reveal splendor.
Confronting the Great Dao’s vastness, at the hair’s-breadth margin—
Rising in emptiness to respond to the moment, the subtle and constant resonance.
Flying strings soar afar; sound does not await plucking.
The Nine Harmonies’ Mystic Echo—empty and identical to the Utmost Dark.

Thus can the heart be cut off beyond heaven, wondrously one with the singular vision.
From this point onward, all are the Dragon’s Radiance and Four Marshes—
Emitting essence in secluded migration, wandering dreams in the Jade Purity—
Entrusting light to the upper leisure, drifting reflections to ascend the Void.
Hands fanning eight thousand; body shaking the Purple Staff—
Scarlet kerchief and lotus crown, gleaming through the Seven Valleys.
Flying fragrance rinses the mist; essence penetrates the Great Void.
Virtue fills the Nine Heavens, bearing sun and moon together—
Serene dwelling in the vast expanse; flying wheels and mendicant monks.
Loosening the sash in the blossoming circle, the Western Primordial commands the reins—
Riding the Turtle Mountain, the Four Unfurlings of Jade Wisdom—
Wondrously chanting the Supreme Mystery; the Six Yin’s blossoms come to cultivate martial affinity.
Virtue reaches the Vermilion Distance; the Dao awakens the Supreme Perfected.

Moreover, with langgan in lush bloom, the Seven Yangs’ Solar Infants—
The Nine Lin’s fluid, the Eight Qiongs’ essence—
Four Stamens’ Mystic Nectar, Five Pearls’ Crimson Life—
Three Blossoms’ flying net, Twin Pearls’ moonlight—
Orchid liquid and golden ( ), Sweet Dew’s Jade Vase—
Azure tendrils and weak silk, drifting mushrooms and flowing spirit—
Divine powder and cinnabar dust, Mystic Branches’ linked camps—
Wandering roots gather at dawn; the Western Sovereign’s plain abundance.
This can ascend the Vermilion Empyrean, fly the Void’s Jade Purity—
Inhaling and exhaling to reach the true and numinous—
Rinsing and transforming to enter the Purple Court.
It can also be the Eastern Culmen’s Weaving Maiden’s water,
Or the Western Expanse’s Long Dusk’s twilight,
Or the Southern Limit’s Yang Radiance’s root,
Or the Northern Depths’ Great Yin’s Night Citadel.

Then, as the Vermilion Summer congeals yang, the radiant whirlwind soars afar—
The Great Void submits its essence; the Two Images turn toward light.
The Eight Paths harmonize; riding the fragrant course of Mu—
Transforming and ordering the Nine Absolutes, attaining the Jade Emperor’s delight.
The Three Passes’ profound depths; the Four Divine Portals unfurl—
Auspicious clouds construct the Empyrean; the Six Perfections bring felicity.
Numinous winds scatter demons; the Dharma Drum summons troops.
Wandering the shores to bathe in the ford, washing the heart in the azure waves—
Refining the soul and transforming the po, all gather in the Dao’s precinct.
Sipping essence and ( ) embryo, harmonious qi preserves longevity—
Unfolding brilliance and sprouting wisdom, wisdom assists external fusion.
Below, drawing from the Mystic Current; above, pushing open the Empty Cavern.

The vessel’s ( ) omen—thus playing with the Dao’s lineage—
Rooting the karmic affinity, returning to feast with the Jade Emperor.
At dawn, shedding the world; ascending to wander the Empty Cavern—
Qi returns to the Dark Ford; shaking and bestowing the Numinous River.
Morning registers with the Golden Immortals; self-aid without end—
Above the Jade Purity, the Supreme Primordial’s numinous qi—
Discarding the immortal’s chapters, doffing the morning crown—
Though the body harmonizes with the powdered groves, the heart dwells beyond images—
Vaguely towering and lofty, yearning for the subtle sound of the empty flute.

Thus, bidding farewell to glory and scattering blossoms, shaking the staff upon the lofty ridge—
Chewing the Primordial qi, inhaling and drawing the Two Luminaries—
Controlling the Nine Immortals’ swans, exhausting spirit to probe the upright—
Silent bones within emptiness, gathering qi to overturn the tripod—
The insipid body self-vanishes; the dwelling’s fate is tranquil and still.
Releasing form to attain emptiness, without heart or grasp.

Then, opening the cavernous inquiry in the Sparse Grove, seeking the Jade Numinous in the Cinnabar Cavern—
Unlocking the Nine Heavens’ Vermilion Gates, obtaining the Jade Purity’s jade missive—
Once gazing upon the Jade Steps amidst the dawn’s clouds,
Twice beholding the Cavern Texts in the brocade-clouded satchel—
Four encounters with the Three Primordials upon the Mystic Terrace,
Six visits to the Five Elders in the Azure Chamber—
Passing the Fusang in the Mystic Palace, seeing the Supreme Constancy upon the Nine Heights—
Heaven’s fan scatters; the plain and subtle grow dark.
Extending the wheel and returning the carriage, the high assembly in the Jade Court—
Feathered skirts and brocade robes, flowing bells and chiming flutes—
Dragon crowns and phoenix blossoms, following the clouds in carefree roaming—
Dark and vast, equal to the dawn; heart cavernous, body distant.
The Great Cavern’s Jade Canon stirs my Nine Darks—
Ascending above the sun and moon, the Jade Grove’s branches.

**Method of Ingesting the Qi of the Mystic Root from the Great Cavern Jade Canon**

The method of ingesting the qi of the Mystic Root renders the body luminously clear, sharpens the eight senses of the spirit, suffuses the form with solar radiance, and imparts a jade-like luster to the face. The eyes emit bright light, the teeth hold purple qi, the intestines grow firm, and the hidden splendor flourishes—thus attaining longevity and enduring vision.

Absorb the morning essence, suspend grain, and fast from solid food. The essential Dao lies in the Golden Liquid; its subtlety resides in the Water Jade’s workings. This is called exhaling and inhaling the Great Harmony of nature, mastering the numinous essence of the Ninefold Purity.

The function of the Dao values spontaneity; the stillness of virtue honors serenity and joy. Embracing spontaneity to manifest truth and holding fast to tranquil emptiness to rectify deviation—then no transgression arises, and harm vanishes of itself. This pertains to the qi of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, which may be called the essential purport of the Dao.

When the adept lies abed before rising, visualize within the mouth a white qi, vast as the yolk of a chicken’s egg. Beyond the yolk, five-colored qi naturally coils and overflows, soon filling the heart and mouth—this is called the qi of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the Mystic Root of the Zi-day.

Within the heart and stomach’s opening, visualize a woman shaped like an infant, unclothed, standing upright in the stomach’s passage. She faces the stomach’s gate, mouth agape, and is named the Mystic Woman of the Nine Heavens. She receives and pours the soul’s essence, inhaling the five-colored qi of the egg-yolk within the mouth.

Regularly rinse the mouth, inside and out, above and below. With the tongue, draw in the solar qi and the five-colored saliva, filling the mouth before swallowing. Visualize the saliva descending into the Mystic Woman’s mouth. Repeat this five times, then click the teeth thrice and softly intone:

*"Jade Purity on high, Nine Heavens and Nine Numinous Ones,
Governed in the Mystic Mystic, descending into the stomach’s clarity.
Gold harmonizes with jade’s radiance, first born from emptiness—
Named ‘Pure Ring,’ styled ‘Luminous Essence.’
Refining the hun and restraining the po, the heart opens and the spirit brightens.
Ingesting the Zi-day’s sustenance, golden splendor fills to abundance."*

After a long while, conclude the practice. Wipe the eyes fourteen times with the hands, then rub the hands together and massage the face, brows, eyes, temples, and hairline until warmth suffuses them, as if gently steamed.

This is the Supreme’s method of ingesting the qi of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the Mystic Root of the Zi-day.

**Ode by Lady Wang of the Purple Tenuity**

Gaze upon the Grand Aurora Palace,
Where golden portals gleam in Purple Clarity.
The immortal chambers reflect the Primal Simplicity,
Four casements all of crimson jasper.

Tossing wheels across the boundless ford,
Reining steeds to dance in emerald carriages.
Jade blossoms unfurl cloud-canopies,
Western consorts unfurl brocade banners.

Suddenly descending amid the dust’s murk,
Swiftly alighting in the courtyard of a fair one.
Long-awaited resonance answers the destined hour—
What is gained already dwells in mystery.

Riding the wind, we soar through the Nine Empyreans,
Together sipping the cinnabar bloom’s essence.
Turning from worldly things, we part—
How could they know the numinous void’s spirit?

Northward we ascend the Gate of Mystic Darkness,
Hand in hand, weaving the lofty net.
Incense smoke scatters the Eight Sceneries,
Mystic winds stir the crimson waves.

Gazing upward, we cross the Coral Ford;
Looking down, we survey the winding valleys.
Jade whistles sing above the clouds,
Phoenixes cry through the Nine Distances.

Riding qi, we float in the Great Void—
Why tread upon mountains and rivers?
With golden tablets, we summon feathered spirits,
Conquering peaks to crush lofty demons.

Rinsing and imbibing the round dawn’s glow,
Accumulating eons like an infant’s teeth.
Amid the clamor of the world’s striving,
They know not what to do.

*The Scripture of the Hundred Inner Names of the Gods of the Nine Heavens of the Supreme Clarity is now complete.*
