May my highest aspirations be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and may I ascend with the Three Perfected."*

Then chant the *"Yang Song"* once, circumambulate once, and depart.

*"The pure tones of the Yang Song resound,
Drifting and stirring the ten directions."*

The verdant myriad blossoms shine bright,
Bearing me aloft to the ninefold heavens.
The western lute’s resonant melody,
Moves the Lord of the East to enlightenment.

**Ritual of the Cavernous Dao**
Face north, circumambulate once while burning incense, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:

The humble Daoist adept [Name], for [specific matter], purified in fast and free of worldly dust, awaits the numinous union of the Five Perfections. May my highest aspirations be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and may I ascend with the Three Heavens."*

Face the Heavenly August One to the north, bow twice in prostration, and kneel.
The humble Daoist adept, your servant [Name], respectfully petitions:
*To the Primordial Three Mysteries of the Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem Jiazi, the Founding Heavenly August Lord of the Supreme Origin; to the Great Vastness of the Congealed Yin Heaven—*
For [specific matter], I have bathed in purity and cleansed myself, invoking the perfected and descending the numinous. May the Emperor’s body be robust and the realm at peace; may my own person receive boundless fortune, and may the seven generations of my ancestors be freed from transgressions and karmic entanglements.
I beseech the August Lord to deign to witness this, to cast your divine gaze below, and to scrutinize my sincere heart.
Kowtow thirty-nine times, then bow twice again.

Next, face the Earthly August One to the southwest, bow twice in prostration, and kneel.

The humble Daoist adept, your servant [Name], respectfully petitions:
*To the Seven Subtleties of the Vast Expansive Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem Jiayin, the Founding Human August Lord; to the Supreme Flourishing of the Southern Vermilion—*

Face the nine heavens of the north and bow nine times,
Face the nine heavens of the west and bow nine times,
Face the nine heavens of the south and bow nine times,
Face the nine heavens of the east and bow nine times.

Next, chant the *"Yang Song"* nine times and circumambulate thrice.
The pure tones of the Yang Song resound,
Drifting and stirring the ten directions.

The verdant myriad blossoms shine bright,
Bearing me aloft to the ninefold heavens.
The western lute’s resonant melody,
Moves the Lord of the East to enlightenment.
The primal cavern heralds the dawn’s inception,
As the first yang sprouts myriad buds.
The harmonious breeze sways the jade branches,
The towering forests gleam with cloudlike veils.
Gou Mang urges the farmers to toil,
As sun and moon illuminate the eastern expanse.
The immortals and sages wander the Mystic Gardens,
Where soaring hymns arise like clarion calls.
They rein in their radiance within the chambers of rosy clouds,
Aligning their wheels at the nine heavens’ courts.
The host of immortals raise their soaring hymns,
As the Yang Song resounds in due season.
Were one not of the myriad enlightened,
How could they partake in this sacred rite?

The gracious harmony of yin and yang’s song,
The two modes receive the half-light’s glow.
Dwelling in repose, I aspire to soar as an immortal,
Unmoved by the world’s fleeting allure.
Before I realize the vastness of the void,
I have already transcended to the loftiest mysteries.
I sigh for those who rush in vain pursuit,
Unknowing of the root that nurtures life.
As the flourishing yang burgeons in fullness,
I chant the verses of the southern golden beam.
The melting breeze brushes the forest’s edge,
As the vermilion phoenix leads the way in flight.
The clarion hymns rise through the void,
Freely intoning the ninefold harmonies.
I harness my carriage to the pristine forest’s splendor,
Commanding the rhythm to strike the golden bell.
The phoenix’s song harmonizes the eight tones,
As the true effulgence graces the sovereign’s countenance.
Above the immortal chambers, the Yang Song soars,
With soaring flutes and pipes in accompaniment.
I resonate with my own self,
Who can fathom this profound accord?
Roaming the peaks of Mount Song,
I playfully frolic among the towering pines.
The lofty immortals, serene and graceful,
Chant the Yang Song in unison.
In perfect harmony, the nine strings resound,
Their cessation blending with the wondrous tones.
The luminous lamp extends the long night,
As the mysterious radiance illumines the secluded hall.
The soaring hymns rise beyond the phoenix grove,
As the pure breeze brushes the jade pendants.
The Yang Song interweaves in antiphonal chant,
The four casements gleam with crimson light.
Row upon row in the vast Moon Palace,
The distant and boundless chambers of the immortals.
The Dark and Mysterious One chants the Yang Song,
As the eight luminaries emerge through the clouds.
The threads of bathing merge with the yang essence,
As the long hymn extols the Supreme One.
Were one not of steadfast and virtuous intent,
How could they delight in such distant transcendence?

Face north, bow twice in prostration, and kneel. Strike the teeth thirty-six times.
The humble Daoist adept, your servant [Name], respectfully petitions:
*To the Supreme Dao Lord of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Elder, the Great Gods of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elder, the Primordial Three Mysteries of the Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem Jiazi, the Founding Heavenly August Lord; to the Three Primordials of the Pure Void Jade Heaven, the Celestial Stem Gengshen, the Founding Earthly August Lord; to the Seven Subtleties of the Vast Expansive Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem Jiayin, the Founding Human August Lord; to the Eight August Lords, the Perfected Gods of the Mystic Capital, the Divine Officials of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Administrations, the Lords of the Seven Stars of the Jade Celestial Pivot, the Purple Palace of the Three Terraces and the Supreme Ultimate Heavenly Honored One, the Heavenly One and Supreme One Lords, the Mystic Canopy of the Supreme Radiance, the Divine Spirits of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, the Gods of the Five Peaks, Eight Mountains, Four Waterways, Nine Springs, Grotto-Heavens, Sunlit Terraces, Divine Continent Immortal Palaces, the Great Marshes and Lakes, the Inner Palaces of the Queen of Heaven, and all the gods of the nine heavens, nine earths, and boundless worlds—*
For [specific matter], I have purified myself in fast and cleansed my being, awaiting the numinous perfected. I repent and confess my transgressions, beseeching forgiveness for the evil roots and karmic entanglements of my nine generations of ancestors. May the Three Officials report to the Northern Emperor, erase my name from the red tablets, transcend my tribulations, and secure peace. May I bear the boundless blessings of the primordial and receive the grace of the Emperor.
Upon completion, kowtow thirty-nine times, then bow twice again.

*"Maiden of the incense smoke, ascend and report to the August Lord. The humble Daoist adept [Name], purified in fast and free of worldly dust, awaits the numinous union of the Five Perfections. May my highest aspirations be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and may I ascend with the Three Heavens."*

Next, sing the Yang Song once through. As it resounds, it circles forth—
The pure horn’s Yang Song, drifting and stirring the ten directions.
A myriad verdant blossoms gleam, bearing me to the ninefold heavens.
The western lute’s lofty tones attune, moving the Eastern King of Lords.
*Ritual for the Offering to the Three Sovereigns of the Cavernous Dao*
Compiled from the scriptures as essential practice, prepared for fellow cultivators to perform together.

If a lord or noble seeks blessings for grave matters, follow the scriptural precepts strictly. For commoners or those of modest means, adjust according to their circumstances, but devote heart and effort wholeheartedly to ensure utmost sincerity.

Upon completion of the incantation, clear the trays and dismantle the seating.
*Ritual for Transmission of the Registers*

**Altar Construction**

The altar shall be three *zhang* square, its height adjusted according to the practitioner. Open three gates: the Gate of the Heavenly Sovereign in the *zi* (north) direction, the Gate of the Earthly Sovereign in the *shen* (southwest) direction, and the Gate of the Human Sovereign in the *yin* (northeast) direction, each marked with an inscribed placard. The size may also be adjusted according to the number of participants. Encircle the altar with railings and lamps, arranged as deemed appropriate. Entry and exit shall be made through the Gate of the Human Sovereign. If the ritual texts are to be exposed and wind or rain arises, the transmission may be conducted indoors.

For the seat of the Heavenly Sovereign, use eighteen bolts of black silk. For the Earthly Sovereign, eighteen bolts of white silk. For the Human Sovereign, eighteen bolts of blue silk. The silk for the adept’s life-destiny shall correspond to their years: the Son of Heaven shall use bolts, nobles shall use *zhang*, and commoners shall use *chi*. The Son of Heaven shall use purple damask; others shall use plain silk, its color varying by direction, all placed upon the table of the Human Sovereign. Three golden dragons shall be used; commoners may substitute rings. Three blue silk banners, each three *chi* in length, shall be inscribed with the inner texts of the Three Sovereigns in vermilion, fashioned according to banner custom. Bamboo poles, ten *chi* in length, shall suspend them at the positions of the Three Sovereigns. Three sets of tables, incense, and lamps shall be arranged to hold the dragons, silks, and other items, as well as the scriptures of the Three Sovereigns.

The aforementioned altar and its furnishings shall be employed for all rites conducted for the state and the people, for averting great disasters and severe calamities, for seeking grace and invoking blessings, for performing the Dao and transmitting the registers. The recipient of the scriptures shall offer four hundred *chi* of white silk; the poor shall offer forty *chi*. Upon completion of the ritual, master and disciple shall exit the altar, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:

*"Maiden of the incense smoke, ascend and report to the August Lord. The humble Daoist adept [Name], purified in fast and free of worldly dust, awaits the numinous union of the Five Perfections. May my highest aspirations be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and may I ascend with the Three Heavens."*

Then, facing north, bow twice and invoke:
*"Primordial Void of the Three Mysteries, Celestial Stem *Jia-Zi*, Founding Heavenly Sovereign of the Supreme Flourishing Prosperity, Supreme Radiance of the Congealed Yin of the Grand Brilliance."*

Next, facing southwest, bow twice and invoke:
*"Three Primordials of the Pure Void, Jade Heaven of the Celestial Stem *Jia-Shen*, Founding Earthly Sovereign of the Southern Harmony and Grand Non-Flourishing."*

Then, facing northeast, bow twice and invoke:
*"Seven Subtleties of the Vast Expanse, Void Heaven of the Celestial Stem *Jia-Yin*, Founding Human Sovereign of the Supreme Non-Flourishing Prosperity of the Southern Elixir."*

Next, unfurl the first two *chi* of the received scripture and the covenant text upon the table, and bow twice together. The disciple shall prostrate facing south, while the master kneels facing north. The humble Daoist adept [Name] respectfully addresses the Supreme Primordial Lady, the Great Divinities of the Immortal Capital, and the Three Sovereigns:

*"I now seek to transmit the precious texts of the Three Sovereigns to [Name] of [Commandery, County, Village]. I await your decree to know if this may proceed."*

Then prostrate for a time. When the wind ceases, rise and bow twice. The disciple shall prostrate again, while the master kneels to read the covenant text. Together, they sip the cinnabar water and jointly inscribe a vermilion mark beneath the covenant. The disciple shall then hold the offering and prostrate. The master, holding the scripture and kneeling, shall strike the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing within the Three Palaces a true person each, like an infant, unclothed, their mouths emitting purple *qi* to suffuse the scripture. Slowly, the master shall recite the incantation:

*"The celestial texts of the Supreme,
Transmitted since the dawn of heaven and earth,
Proclaimed by the Sovereigns as the profound decree,
Are the scriptures of the utmost perfection.
Now received by the worthy,
With the aspiration to ascend to the Great Void."*

Upon completion, the disciple shall bow twice and place the offering beneath the table. The transmission of the scriptures concluded, both shall bow twice again. Then, chant the three *Yang Songs*, circling the altar once.

**Yang Song of the Clear Horn**
The *Yang* chant, like a drifting *fàn*,
Resonates through the ten directions.
A myriad verdant blossoms gleam,
Bearing me to the ninefold heights.
The western string ascends in tune,
Awakening the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount.
The Primordial Cavern inaugurates the course,
As the first *yang* sprouts ten thousand buds.
The harmonious wind stirs the jade branches,
The lofty groves gleam with cloudy veils.
*Gou Mang* urges the farmer’s toil,
Sun and moon illumine the eastern expanse.
Immortal sages wander the Mystic Garden,
Soaring *fàn* arise with the cry of pipes.
Grasping the light within the chambers of the grand auroras,
We align our wheels with the nine heavens’ courts.
The host of immortals lifts their flying *fàn*,
The *Yang* song resounds in its season.
Were one not of the spirit’s myriad,
How could one uphold the rites of transformation’s purity?

Next, return to the Heavenly Palace, face north, bow twice, kneel, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. The humble Daoist adept [Name] respectfully addresses the Supreme Lord of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Elder, the Nine Elders and Great Divinities of the Immortal Capital, the Elder of the Nine *Qi*, the Three Sovereigns, the Eight August Lords, the Great Mystic Divinities of the Dark Capital, the Divine Officials of the Thirty-Six Celestial Offices, the Lords of the Seven Stars of the Jade Armillary and the Shaking Light, the Heavenly Honored Ones of the Purple Palace of the Three Terraces and the Northern Culmen, the Lords of the Heavenly One and the Great One, the Supreme Numinous of the Canopy of the Grand Tenuity, the Divine Officials within and without the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Five Marchmounts, Eight Mountains, Four Watercourses, Nine Springs, Grotto-Heavens, Sunlit Terraces, Divine Continent, Sacred Isles, Grand Marshes, and Inner Palaces of the Queen of the Waters, the Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, and the Boundless Worlds—all divine beings:

*"Together with [Name], we have performed the fast and conducted the Dao, completing the transmission of the registers. We beseech the assembled divinities to witness our ritual site and diligently guard and assist. Now that the rites are concluded, may each return to your celestial stations, be elevated in rank and imperial order, and receive rewards according to your merits. We respectfully submit this entreaty."*

Then bow twice again. Next, recite the incantation:

The Incense Smoke Maiden, ascending to report to the August Lord, the Lesser Portent Perfected [Name], having purified the fast and severed worldly dust, awaits the numinous Five Penetrations. May the highest aspiration be fulfilled in perfection, calamities extinguished, blessings engendered, and ascent achieved to the Three Heavens.

Next, chant one *Yang Song* and depart:
*The pure horn’s Yang Song, a Brahman chant,
Drifting, stirring the ten directions.
Verdant, myriad blossoms gleam,
Bearing me to the Ninefold Heights.
The western string lifts its tune,
Moving the Lord of the East to awakening.*

Face north and burn incense, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:
*The Incense Smoke Maiden, ascending to report to the August Lord, the Lesser Portent Perfected [Name], having purified the fast and severed worldly dust, awaits the numinous Five Penetrations. May the highest aspiration be fulfilled in perfection, calamities extinguished, blessings engendered, and ascent achieved to the Three Heavens.*

Next, face the Heavenly August and prostrate twice in long obeisance.
The Lesser Portent Perfected, your subject [Name], respectfully approaches the Primordial Three Mysteries of the Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem *Jiazi*’s Origin-Building Heavenly August Perfected Lord, and the Grand Radiance’s Primordial Yin-Congealing Heaven. Now, for such-and-such matter, having bathed in purity, I summon the Perfected and invoke the numinous. May the highest aspiration grant the emperor robust health and the realm tranquility; may the lowest plea bestow upon me boundless fortune and blessings, and liberate the seven generations of my parents from transgressions and karmic entanglements. I beseech the August Lord to deign to cast his divine gaze downward and scrutinize my sincere heart.

Kowtow thirty-nine times, then prostrate twice again.

Next, face the northeast toward the August of Humanity and prostrate twice in long obeisance.
The Lesser Portent Perfected, your subject [Name], respectfully approaches the Seven Subtleties’ Vast and Profound Void Heaven, the Celestial Stem *Jiayin*’s Origin-Building August of Humanity Perfected Lord, and the Supreme Non-Existent’s Flourishing Son of the Southern Cinnabar. Now, for such-and-such matter, having bathed in purity, I summon the Perfected and invoke the numinous. May the highest aspiration grant the emperor robust health and the realm tranquility; may the lowest plea bestow upon me boundless fortune and blessings, and liberate the seven generations of my parents from transgressions and karmic entanglements. I beseech the August Lord to deign to cast his divine gaze downward and scrutinize my sincere heart.

Kowtow thirty-nine times, then prostrate twice again.

Face north, prostrate twice in long obeisance, and strike the teeth thirty-six times.
The Lesser Portent Perfected, your subject [Name], respectfully addresses the Most High Lord of the Dao of the Nine Heavens, the Most High Venerable, the Great Gods of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital, the Nine *Qi* Venerable, the Three August Ones Perfected Lords, the Eight August Honored Lords, the Immortal Officials of the Mysterious Capital, the Great Mysterious Perfected Spirits, the Divine Lords of the Thirty-Six Heavens’ Numinous Offices, the Seven Stars of the Jade Armillary’s Handle-Shaking Lord, the Three Terraces and Purple Palace’s Northern Culmen Heavenly Honored One, the Heavenly One and Grand One Lords, the Supreme Subtlety’s Mysterious Spirit and Canopy’s Upper Numinous Ones, the divine officials within and without the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Five Marchmounts, Eight Mountains, Four Watercourses, Nine Springs, Grotto-Heavens, Sunlit Terraces, Divine Continent, Sacred Isles, Grand Marshes, Inner Palaces of the Queen of the Waters, the Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, and the Boundless Worlds—all divine beings.

Having purified the fast and cleansed myself, I await the August Perfected’s numinous presence, repenting and confessing my transgressions. May the evil roots and karmic adversaries from the nine generations of ancestors be absolved and dissolved. May the Three Officials report to the Northern Emperor, the red tablets be erased, tribulations be overcome, and peace and tranquility be secured. May the people bear the primordial blessings and receive the emperor’s grace.

Conclude with thirty-nine kowtows, then prostrate twice again.

Next, burn incense, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:
*The Incense Smoke Maiden, ascending to report to the August Lord, the Lesser Portent Perfected [Name], having purified the fast and severed worldly dust, awaits the numinous Five Penetrations. May the highest aspiration be fulfilled in perfection, calamities extinguished, blessings engendered, and ascent achieved to the Three Heavens.*

Next, chant one *Yang Song* and depart:
*The pure horn’s Yang Song, a Brahman chant,
Drifting, stirring the ten directions.
Verdant, myriad blossoms gleam,
Bearing me to the Ninefold Heights.*

The verdant myriad blossoms gleam,
Bearing me to the Ninefold Heights.
The western zither’s lofty melody,
Moves and awakens the Eastern King of Lords.

The *Dongshen* method of the Three Sovereigns,
Enables communion with spirits, commands myriad gods,
Brings peace to nation and household, aids and delivers the people.
Those who study and cultivate it may ascend as immortals and transcend the world.

Yet since the time of the former masters, the scriptures have not been complete,
And even the transmission of ordination has often been deficient.
Now, in accordance with the scriptures, talismanic charts and jade texts are compiled,
To be conferred upon the altar as treasures for the body.

Among these scriptures, most pertain to methods of summoning,
For they are the discourses of jade texts—rarely employed in the world.
Thus, they may be excerpted and collected hereafter to achieve completeness.
Many learners are impoverished and cannot readily prepare all at once;
Those who can fully ascend the altar are most aligned with the method.

The *Taishang Dongshen* Rite of Dao Transmission and Ordination is now complete.
