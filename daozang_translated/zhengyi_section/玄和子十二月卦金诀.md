**Xuanhezi’s Golden Secrets of the Twelve Monthly Hexagrams**

At the first yang line of *Fu* Hexagram, the celestial signs align at the hour of *zi*.
*Fu* Hexagram governs the eleventh month, when the first yang line emerges as the cinnabar symbol.
As the eleventh month marks the onset of early spring, the elixir’s tally must follow the celestial pivot to refine the fire.

Thus does Xuanhezi employ this image and this method:
With wondrous skill, the golden crucible is tended;
With pure and reverent heart, the Jade Emperor is honored.
For twelve days of inner abstinence, the alchemist—master of profound mysteries—
Must maintain immaculate devotion, as though standing before the Highest Perfected.

The White Tiger is not yet fully subdued,
While the Azure Dragon begins its gradual ascent.
Both White Tiger and Azure Dragon reside within the crucible.
The White Tiger, being metal, cannot yet restrain the Dragon, which, nourished by gentle fire, gradually stirs into flight.

Since ancient times, immortals have guarded this secret as one—
Who claims the elixir’s art follows another path?
From antiquity to the present, transcendents have concealed this Way.
Sages past and present share but this single method; no other principle exists.
Only the names of the elixir vary, it is said.

In *Lin* Hexagram, the Crimson Dragon stirs with clarity,
As mid-spring’s season brings mist-laden rains.
The Crimson Dragon arises with the second yang line, the fire growing stronger.
Now in mid-spring, the Azure Dragon ascends and descends like drifting mists.

The ocean’s waves recede from the lofty isle of Penglai,
While jade gates are sealed to ward off drafts.
The furnace has doors, and these must be opened and closed to block stray winds.
Once the ingredients are harmonized with skillful hands,
The fire’s modulation must proceed with profound mastery.

Only when the numbers of Heaven and Earth are grasped
Does the path to the Three Pure Ones become clear.
The method of refinement first requires understanding the water and fire of *Qian* and *Kun*.
Only then can the elixir be circulated; once perfected, the way to the Three Pure Realms is unobstructed.

In *Tai* Hexagram, the two qi achieve balance,
And within the crucible, the leaps grow ever more distinct.
The Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s howl are truly worth hearing,
As lightning flashes and thunder rumbles in ceaseless fury.
The Azure Dragon and White Tiger within the crucible vie and devour one another.
The alchemist listens intently to the infant’s cries to gauge the fire’s ascent.
The fire, like stored lightning and thunder, gradually shifts to martial intensity.

As spring’s scene fades, the northern gate is sealed,
And fiery clouds blaze, illuminating the fortress walls.
By the time of *Tai* Hexagram, spring’s season has passed.
The furnace’s northern gate is closed, and the fire grows martial, casting a radiant glow.
The fortress is the furnace, used as a stronghold.

How many know this secret of eternal life?
When merit is complete, the whole household ascends to the Jade Pure Realm.
Most mortals, ensnared by fame and profit, live in vain and die in futility.
Among ten thousand, scarcely one knows the Way of longevity—this elixir.
Yet if one refines the elixir to completion and accumulates hidden merit,
They shall surely ascend in time.

In *Zhuang* Hexagram, what is the Dao’s course?
Fire upon fire advances, and crimson clouds multiply.
The *Zhuang* Hexagram, with its four yang lines, marks the onset of summer.
The fire grows martial, hence the abundance of crimson clouds.

Within the vessel, the sun and moon align with the seasons;
Within the crucible, wind and thunder churn the azure waves.
The sun and moon are the two qi of yin and yang.
When they move in harmony with the seasons, the crucible itself becomes a realm of wind and thunder stirring the lead and mercury.

Ears strain to catch the faintest whisper of fire,
While nods affirm the rising veil of smoke.
The Fire Star’s net listens for the crucible’s bubbling and seething.
As the Azure Dragon weakens, the elixir’s work progresses.
Soon, the elixir ripens—
No thousand scriptures or myriad secrets surpass this.

In *Guai* Hexagram, summer’s warmth divides the season,
And the single yin will soon transform into pure *Qian*.
The *Guai* Hexagram, with its five yang lines, governs the height of summer.
As the season advances to *si*, it becomes *Qian* Hexagram—
Thus, it is said that before long, *Qian* reaches its fullness.

To capture the White Tiger is no easy feat,
Nor is subduing the Azure Dragon a mere coincidence.
With five yang lines, the fire grows fiercely martial.
At this stage, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger naturally restrain one another.

Gradually, purple powder flies within the lid,
While within the crucible, red lotuses bloom.
After the initial refinement, as the elixir circulates to this stage,
What rises to the crucible’s lid resembles purple powder,
And what forms around it takes the hue of red lotuses.

When the allotted time nears its end, the adept departs,
Returning to the golden altar of the old cave-heaven.
Once the elixir is complete, the one who consumes it has a thousand-day limit.
Yet they must perform hidden deeds in the world;
Only when the destined time is fulfilled does the elixir’s power manifest.
Some ascend in broad daylight, others at night,
Leaving behind an empty corpse in the city.
The heavens dissolve the mortal coil, and in Huayang Cave,
A golden elixir altar stands a hundred *zhang* high—
One of the Eight Great Cave-Heavens.

In *Qian* Hexagram, the six positions complete their cycle,
And the furnace blazes crimson with radiant fire.
As the six positions culminate in *Qian* Hexagram,
The alchemists speak of yang lines as the furnace’s flames.
Now the elixir reaches its peak, the martial fire at its fiercest,
Glowing brilliantly to fill the crucible with red.

By this stage, the harmonization matches that of all sages,
And the adept, cherished and protected, ascends to the Nine Palaces.
When the elixir reaches this point, the fire is at its zenith, the Dragon’s time past.
The inner and outer waters are balanced, the seas exhausted.
All sages guard and guide the adept toward the *wu* position—
The southern *Li* Palace, one of the Nine Palaces.

Thunder stills, lightning subsides, the azure sea runs dry,
And the Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s struggle leave the crucible and vessel empty.

The *Yijing* states: "The exalted Dragon has regret." This means yang has reached its extreme. At this time, the Azure Dragon has been entirely devoured by the White Tiger, and the White Tiger now lies subdued in stillness. Thunder and lightning fall silent, the crucible stands empty—no trace of the Azure Dragon’s roar remains.

The master’s wondrous hands penetrate the profound principle, gathering and clustering yin and yang within a single chamber. When the adept who refines the elixir attains this position, their power aligns with that of all sages. Thus it is said: "penetrating the profound principle, gathering and clustering yin and yang." Though many in the world devote themselves to the Great Dao, few understand that the year mirrors the cosmos, the month mirrors the heavens—only the hours and moments hold the true key. By drilling and clustering yin and yang, one penetrates the ultimate principle of creation.

As Laozi’s song declares:
*The sage seizes the intent of creation,
Grasps sun and moon, sets them within the furnace.
Gently inverting the essence of heaven and earth,
Gathering yin and yang to command spirits and ghosts.
Who recognizes the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit?
Those who do are true immortals.
Refine and consume it for a thousand days,
And with no yin left within the body, how could death come?*

The *Gou* Hexagram now appears in perfect peace, the *Li* Palace restored with fresh auspiciousness. Clouds disperse, the two forces rest—all is tranquil. Fragrant blossoms bloom red, a springtime unlike any other. In the *Gou* Hexagram, a single yin line emerges, for the *Yijing* says: "Treading on frost, solid ice—yin begins to congeal." The elixir, having reached this stage, gradually attains peace. This is the position of the *Li* Palace at *wu*, where fire and light prevail. The Metal Tiger Primordial Lord aligns with both realms, hence it is said to be "restored." Within the crucible, clouds and rain withdraw, the elixir glows red as spring blossoms—this is *Gou*.

The Returned Elixir naturally reverts to the Dao; where can one seek companions in this work? The Elixir Earth has nine returns and seven reversals, referring to the return of yang in the eleventh month and the reversion to yin by the fifth month—each follows its own principle. If one refines the elixir with such effort, where can one find another like oneself?

Attaining immortality is no easy feat—only by following the path of the Three Mao Masters can one tread in their footsteps. No method surpasses the Great Elixir for achieving longevity. If one reaches this stage and comprehends its wondrous function, such a person is rare indeed. To attain this is no simple endeavor; one must follow the dust-trails of the Three Mao Immortals.

The *Dun* Hexagram arrives as autumn’s scene unfolds, returning to the *Kun* position as the fire-clouds withdraw. The seventh month in the human world is mid-autumn; for elixir-refiners, the sixth month is mid-autumn, signifying the return to *Kun* in the southwest. Yin lines gradually emerge as yang lines withdraw. The water of the sea is replenished, timed by the dripping clepsydra. One imagines the crucible filled with crimson radiance, glowing like the rosy clouds of the Ten Isles.

Within the grotto-heavens, names are already inscribed—those who master this elixir-refinement are destined for immortality. When the elixir reaches the stage of two yin lines, there is no longer any danger of conflict or loss. Yet people of this age obscure the Dao, pursuing embryonic breathing, unaware that such practices are minor arts, incapable of transforming bone and form.

As Ge Xianweng said:
*"Daoists are all fools,
Seeking only embryonic breathing.
How could they know of the Purple Journey Elixir,
The path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight?"*

The *Pi* Hexagram approaches, bringing joy to the heart, as the three yang lines retreat and return to yin. After the Yellow Sprout coalesces, flowers burst forth in competition; when green waters are added, the sea deepens of its own accord. In the *Pi* Hexagram, the three yang lines transform into yin, hence the return to yin. The Yellow Sprout becomes the Great Elixir, blooming like flowers in spring, naturally fragrant and red. The water of the sea is replenished, now half again as deep.

Within the chamber, one temporarily commands the transformations of creation,
Yet returns to the dust to blend with the passing of time.
Those who cultivate the Elixir, within a single room,
Manipulate the Qian and Kun Hexagrams, wielding the power of creation,
Giving birth to the Elixir as heaven and earth bring forth the ten thousand things.

Once the Elixir’s drumbeat advances, its merit lies in human inquiry.
Long have I sighed for companions of those bygone years—
The golden crucible, without karmic affinity, where now may it be found?
Those who once practiced the Elixir together,
After the turmoil of war, parted ways, their fates unknown,
Unable to share the same affinity, to complete the golden crucible.

The *Guan* Hexagram nears its end, its Dao all but fulfilled,
At the hour of *you*, the tally and seal align at the center.
The hour of *you* marks the auspicious moment in the scriptures of Elixir cultivation,
Its midpoint also serving as a guide for later learners.
*You* is the eighth month, the sixth month the central position of heaven and earth.

Once the fire-timing attains its profound mystery,
One can envision the Elixir filling the crucible, crimson as dawn.
When the fire-timing is mastered to its subtlety, the Elixir must form,
Its red powder manifest.

How could one fret over graying hair in the world?
Dwelling in the mountains, one naturally subdues the Green Dragon.
With the red powder Elixir in hand, why fear hair that does not return to black?
Living in the mountains, attaining the Dao, one subdues the Green Dragon to refine the Elixir.

Though immortals and aspirants may claim completion,
Without severing worldly desires, the Dao cannot be exhausted.
This poem on awaiting the Golden Elixir contains the ultimate secrets of immortals,
All methods fully expounded.
Yet if ordinary folk, their minds shallow and fickle,
Fail to align with the Dao’s affinity, they cannot fathom its depths.

The *Bo* Hexagram cycles, restoring the two qi in full—
At this stage of Elixir cultivation, one is called an immortal.
When the five yin lines return, yin and yang near completion,
The Elixir perfected here is that of the immortal.

The Jade Hall, spring’s feast, enveloped in fragrant mist,
The golden crucible, its flowers red, unfolding like auspicious lotuses.
The Jade Hall is the Elixir chamber; the golden crucible, the Elixir furnace.
At this moment, the Elixir naturally fills the room and crucible with fragrant breezes,
Resembling newly bloomed red lotuses.

The sea’s waves naturally settle into emerald stillness,
The evening sun easily drifts with the passing years.
Yang fire gradually retreats, upper water replenished,
Calm and unmoving, the time now evening.
The Elixir’s fire nears the midpoint of the year’s cycle, hence the drifting years.

Worldly folk crave only the red dust of mundane affairs—
How could they believe there is yet another mystery within the mystery?
The Golden Elixir moves by heaven’s decree,
Taking the false as its foundation,
Drawing from the one within, it forms of itself.

Know that the *Kun* Hexagram’s positions have come full circle—
By the tenth month, all twelve positions are complete.
The fire now subtle, pure yin coalescing,
The civil fire lingers of its own accord.

Then, holding the incense tablet, one faces the Dipper to pay homage,
Adjusting robes and cap to offer prayers to the Supreme Ultimate.
When the cycles of water and fire, yin and yang, are fulfilled,
The Elixir master, with incense in hand, ascends the altar,
Giving thanks to the celestial spirits of heaven and earth,
And once more entreating the stars to guard the Elixir’s favor,
Warding off any encroaching malevolent qi.

Only when the furnace’s chill is carefully tended may one dare to look—
Anxious thoughts linger, never ceasing.
Come morning, after offering incense and paying homage to the immortals of heaven and earth,
One opens the golden crucible—
Atop it, the Elixir has formed, finest of all,
Rising to the lid in a radiant purple glow,
This is the completion of the Purple Journey Elixir.

The *Xuanhezi’s* Twelve-Month Hexagram Secrets of the Golden Elixir conclude.
