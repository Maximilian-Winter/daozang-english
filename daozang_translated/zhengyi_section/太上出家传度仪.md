*The Ritual for Leaving the Household and Receiving Transmission of the Most High*
Compiled by Jia Shanxiang, Left-Street Supervisor, Co-Signatory of the Teaching Affairs Bureau, and Grand Master of Lofty Virtue and Enlightened Perfection

The disciple is led before the Great Dao, bows three times, offers incense, and the preceptor recites the incense prayer:

"Today, with this burning incense, we reverently offer it to the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, the Ten Poles of High Perfection, the Jade Emperor of Great Heaven, the August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole of Purple Tenuity, the August Earth Deity of the Rear Soil, the Sacred Ancestor and August Emperor, the Great Saintly Empress of Primordial Heaven, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Ten Divine Lords of the Great Unity, the Eleven Luminaries and Stellar Officials, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Stellar Officials of the Northern and Southern Dippers, the Stellar Officials of the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the Four Directions, the Four Sage Perfected Lords, the Three Primordial Perfected Lords, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Three Masters of Scriptures, Registers, and Transmission, the Orthodox Unity Perfected, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Marchmounts, the Great Cavern Immortals Assisting the Heir Apparent, the Immortals of the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens, the Immortals of the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Thirty-Six Quiet Abodes, the Twenty-Four Transformed Immortal Officials, the Source Kings of the Four Waterways, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu in the Earthly Prison, the Stellar Official of the disciple’s life destiny, the Perfected Officials of the temple’s precincts, the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, and all majestic numina.

On this day, this disciple, so-and-so, having left the worldly net in youth and early revered the true wind, now by the grace of the state is permitted to fulfill the Dao and take the tonsure. Having established the altar this morning and donned the cap and tablet at this propitious hour, I humbly offer devotion through incense and cultivation, aspiring to repay the Perfected and Saints above. I beseech the Compassionate Honored Ones of the Three Realms, the True Lords of the Ten Directions, the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, and all sages and worthies to graciously grant witness, slightly prolong the swift chariot’s journey, and allow me to bow my head and take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao."

Next, the preceptor is seated before the Three Masters. The master of ceremonies leads the disciple to bow three times to the preceptor, then kneel facing north to hear the causes and conditions of leaving the household. Incense and flowers are arranged as offerings, and the preceptor offers incense.

According to the *Scripture of the True One’s Original Boundary*:
At that time, the Lord Azure Lad asked about the method of leaving the household.
The Heavenly Worthy said: "Leaving the household is of profound meaning and vast benefit. There are two kinds: one is leaving the bonds of affection, and the other is leaving the bonds of existence.

For beginners who encounter an enlightened master, if their resolve is steadfast and they endure hardship, serving and attending with devotion, they will receive wondrous instruction. If they remain in the household, parents, wife, and children will entangle them in the snares of love, like being confined in a prison, unable to act freely or follow their inclinations. They should follow the master near or far, inquiring into the mysterious enterprise. Thus, they inform their parents, bid farewell to their wives and children, abandon their homes, journey far into the mountains and forests, rely on Daoist abodes, cast off worldly attire and ornaments, don the yellow-brown robe and dark headscarf, renounce worldly glory, beg alms as circumstances allow, widely establish fields of merit, and devote themselves solely to the Dao—this is called initially leaving the household of affection.

Having left the household, they diligently practice purification and precepts, avoid the three evil destinies, establish the root of faith, learn quietude and enter seclusion, transcend the loves of the three realms, and ascend into the Nine Clarities—this is called leaving the household of existence."

The Lord Azure Lad said: "I have now escaped the three evil destinies and wish to leave the household of existence. I do not know what constitutes the establishment of the true teaching."
The Heavenly Worthy said: "If there are scriptures comprising the Twelve Divisions and corresponding to the Three Caverns, these are called the Orthodox Scriptures. Beyond these, one must discern the true from the false before they may be received and upheld. One should personally request a master to carefully determine and distinguish them."

Upon hearing these words, the Lord Azure Lad rejoiced with exultant joy, bowed deeply, and withdrew.

From this point onward, all who leave the household of existence, having bid farewell to love and attachment to enter the Dharma-gate, must vow to cultivate the practices of divine immortals, valuing both self-benefit and benefiting others. They must cast aside malevolent thoughts and nurture only wholesome intentions, honoring superiors and embracing inferiors with gentle and harmonious conduct in all actions.

Whenever encountering images of the myriad sages and perfected beings, they must hold unwavering faith. Morning incense and evening lamps should encircle them in praise and reverence, prostrating with the five limbs touching the earth in worship and offering. Thus may they hope that in this life and the next, they will share affinity with the Dao, don the lunar sash and stellar crown, ride the cloud chariot with feathered canopy, inscribe their names upon golden tablets and jade registers, ascend beyond the Nine Heavens, and dwell among the Three Isles.

Yet the golden tablets and jade registers do not permit reckless transmission. Those guilty of the five rebellious acts or the ten evils are defiled and sink into the lower realms. Should one violate these luminous statutes, the preceptor who transmits the teaching incurs guilt. How much more so when the Most High has bequeathed scriptures and the Heavenly Worthy has expounded the precepts—if one meets a worthy recipient yet fails to transmit, calamity befalls oneself; if one transmits to an unworthy recipient, misfortune extends to one’s ancestors. Thus, in the transmission of the Dharma-gate, vigilance in upholding the precepts must come first.

Now, your resolve for the Dao runs deep, and you have been born in the Central Land, forsaking worldly karma to pursue the true teaching. As the scriptures declare: "The human body is difficult to obtain; birth in the Middle Kingdom is difficult to attain. Even if one attains it, encountering the true Dharma is difficult. Many stray from the true Dao, enter heterodox sects, indulge in the roots of transgression, engage in cunning deceit, give free rein to lust and killing, delight in worldly attachments, cling to greed and anger, sink into hell, and lose the human form." For such reasons, beings remain deluded, unaware of the true Dao, and the confused are many.

I now, in compassion, behold these beings and thus bestow the teaching, expounding the auspicious conditions. May they come to know the Dao, to understand that body, life, and nature all arise from the Dao. By awakening to this cause, they may abide long in the human realm, their lineage unbroken, generation after generation, never born in lands devoid of the Dao, never severed from the root of humanity. Further, by cultivating the true Dao in the heart, they may gradually enter the lineage of immortals, forever escape the wheel of rebirth, and ascend beyond the three realms.

You, having attained what is difficult to attain and encountered what is difficult to encounter, neither stray from the true Dao nor enter heterodox sects, neither indulge in the roots of transgression nor engage in cunning deceit, neither delight in lust and killing nor cling to greed and anger. Thus, your bone structure accords with the scriptures, and you are fit to be a vessel of the Dharma, transmitting the scriptures and propagating the teaching to assist the nation and deliver beings. Now, on this auspicious occasion, having fully embodied the marks of the Dao, you must understand the causes and conditions of leaving the household—let no doubt arise. Should you harbor contrary intentions, you will descend to become a lowly ghost. Listen carefully and be vigilant.

I now say again: In your leaving the household, one person’s blessing brings grace to nine generations of ancestors. Moreover, your bones resonate with immortality, your spirit harmonizes with the Dao, you yearn for the sacred realm of purity and emptiness, and you cast off the fetters of defilement and turbidity. Aspiring to emulate even the most humble, you forever return to the true sages, purifying your form and stripping away worldly attire. First, summon the hundred spirits to witness your transmission, and let the Five Emperors bear testimony.

May your name be inscribed on the jade tablets, your body clad in rosy clouds, as you follow the feathered transcendents to pay homage to the perfected, swiftly obtain the elixir of immortality, and transcend the world. Now, you should first pay respects to the Emperor, then bid farewell to your parents, and thereafter become a lofty one who transcends the world, forever a superior adept who ascends to the real.

From this moment onward, you may only pay homage to the perfected and worship the sages—never offer sacrifices to ghosts or bow to the heterodox. In all deeds of merit, first benefit the nation and the family. Now, in the courtyard below, bow in farewell and await the investiture.

Next, lead the disciple to the courtyard, facing north to pay homage to the Emperor. If you seek to perceive the myriad wonders and awaken to the profound mystery, you must cast off the robes of the scholar-official and don the sash of radiant clouds, forever attending the Jade Emperor, offering gratitude to the human sovereign, thus ever attaining freedom and no longer needing to bow in submission.

Summon the Metal Mother and exhort the Yellow Emperor: face north and bow four times to the Emperor. Next, offer thanks to your ancestors. By the accumulated blessings of your ancestors, grace has extended to later generations. Thus, you forsake the bonds of splendor to uphold the teaching of purity and clarity, relying solely on burning incense and reciting scriptures to dedicate merit and cultivate virtue. At every offering and sacrifice, perform the rites of bowing and kneeling—face the ancestral mounds and bow four times.

Next, bid farewell to your parents. Having departed from their sweet care to enter the Dharma-gate, though you fail in the boundless debt of filial piety, you yearn for the wondrous Dao of non-action. May you uphold the scriptures and the Dharma to repay their toil. Now, in this parting bow, you neglect the duties of morning and evening attendance—bid farewell to your parents, uncles, aunts, elder brothers, and seniors, each with four bows.

Next, bid farewell to relatives and friends. Having long attended to their needs, you have grown distant from companions. Now, you forsake the intoxicating joys of spring to delight in the pursuit of the pure realm. Donning the feathered robe, you no longer observe worldly rites—bid farewell to relatives and friends with four bows.

Next, the master of ceremonies leads the disciple to stand before the Three Masters, and the keeper of the chime invites the Three Masters to conduct the ritual. Next, take the Three Refuges. Next, the disciple kneels and presents a written petition to declare himself. If unable to recite from memory, write it on a wooden tablet; if no tablet is used, paper will suffice.

*[Petition text:]*
I, [Name], humbly reflect that this lowly, defiled form does not presume to measure its own capacity, yet I exhaust my foolish sincerity, wishing to draw near the myriad wonders. Now, by the gracious decree, I am permitted to don the cap and robes. I now approach the preceptor of transmission, reverently seeking instruction and precepts, that I may fulfill my vows without transgression. Should I violate the luminous statutes, I shall not shirk the karmic retribution.
I, [Name], speak with utmost reverence and awe.

Having bowed three times, rise and stand. Next, the preceptor reads the petition aloud.

*[Preceptor’s address:]*
Reverently considering the scriptures bequeathed by the Three Caverns and the teachings expounded by the Seven Perfected, all enable those who don the robe and receive transmission to enter the wondrous gate. The merit is unfathomable, and heaven and humanity rejoice. This is the path from the mundane to the sacred, ascending from shallowness to depth, where names are recorded in the celestial registers and bodies dwell among the immortals. Without past-life karmic affinity, how could one meet such conditions?

Since you have declared your resolve for the Dao to be firm, you must repay the four debts of gratitude, awaken to the three realms of existence, and stand alone in the profound mystery.

Now, as the hundred spirits descend in attendance and the myriad sages incline their radiance, you must silently cultivate reverence, lest any irreverence arise.

It is fitting to invite the two recommending masters to remove your secular garments and bestow the Daoist attire.

Next, the recommending master assists in removing the secular clothing, beginning with the shoes. The preceptor intones:
*"First, your feet step into the paired sandals, forever departing the six defilements.
As the scripture says: ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet.’
This first step marks the inception of your intent.
May you wholeheartedly devote yourself to the Dao, treading the sacred altar.
In all your wanderings, avoid inauspicious places; always ascend to the Dharma assemblies, mounting the immortal steps.
At the two transitional hours, you must change your garments."*

Next, the sash is tied. The preceptor intones:
*"The sash is called *qun* (群), signifying unity—gathering and leading fellow Daoists in harmonious purity.
It is also called *shang* (裳), for above is the robe (*yi*), and below is the sash (*shang*), exemplifying humility as a constant practice.
One who upholds this will remain free from calamity, ever protected by the sages."*

Next, the cloud sleeves are donned. The preceptor intones:
*"Lightly cut from yellow clouds, fashioned into ritual vestments,
above they complement the frost-like mantle, below they unite with the soaring celestial skirt,
forming the garment of the Middle Way, never to be parted from the body."*

Next, the Daoist robe is draped. The preceptor intones:
*"The Daoist robe is the ritual vestment of the Heavenly Worthy and Lord Lao,
cherished by perfected sages, revered by humans and gods.
Once it graces your body, hold it in deepest veneration.
It can erase transgressions of the three times and enable the deliverance of the nine ancestors.
In walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, you must always protect it,
never placing it in defiled vessels nor mingling it with secular garments.
Failure to do so will invite dire retribution."*

Next, the attendant strikes the chime and recites the *Hymn to the Immortal Robe*:
*"The raiment of the celestial immortals,
the celestial treasure of natural splendor.
Light as the six-zhu wonder,
adorned to match the Three Luminaries.
May this donning today
lead to the carefree realm of deathlessness."*

Next, the star crown is placed upon the head. The preceptor holds it and intones:
*"You now don the star crown.
The crown (*guan*) signifies the highest point of the body, gathering all hair,
resplendent as the Dipper’s stars, majestic as towering peaks,
mirroring the assembly of perfected ones in the celestial court,
marking you as a master of the Three Caverns.
No longer bound as servant or subject—this is your provisional guise.
From dawn to dusk, guard it well, lest dust or filth defile it.
Should you treat it with disdain, the celestial bureaus will deduct from your allotted years.
But if you hold it in constant mindfulness, immortality may yet be attained."*

Next, the disciple kneels to the side, and the preceptor places the crown upon their head, reciting thrice:
*"Harmonize with the Dao."*

Next, the attendant strikes the chime and chants the *Hymn to the Star Crown*:
*"Resplendent with the seven stars,
gracefully descending from heaven.
Bestowed with precepts and rites,
destined by past life to become a divine immortal.
May this donning today
preserve the great Peng’s years of longevity."*

Next, the tablet is held. The preceptor intones:
*"The tablet (*jian*) signifies simplicity in affairs and concentration of mind.
Simplicity fosters focused intent; holding it ensures steadfastness.
Gazing at the stars, bowing to the Dipper, invoking the sages, and attending the perfected—
it is the luminous adornment of the Daoist rites, the model for humans and gods.
Only one who embodies this may rightfully hold it."*

Next, the attendant recites the *Three Invocations*.
Next, the preceptor recites the Ten Precepts, as the disciple kneels in attendance.

*"The precepts restrain evil and prevent wrongdoing, safeguarding the upright and crushing the perverse.
They prevent arrogance and negligence, forbidding disdain or contempt.
Today, I confer upon you the Ten Precepts to protect body and mind.
Listen carefully and uphold them without laxity.

The First Precept: Let your heart be free of malice and envy, never harboring hidden harm.
Guard your speech, be mindful of transgressions, and let your thoughts dwell in the Dharma.
Can you uphold this?"*
The disciple responds: *"I can."* (The same response follows each precept.)

*"The Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing.
Pity and aid all beings, extending compassionate salvation to all.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Third Precept: Uphold integrity and yield to righteousness.
Do not deceive or steal; always cultivate good intentions, sacrificing for others.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Fourth Precept: Be free from greed and desire, keeping the heart undistracted.
Maintain purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Fifth Precept: Let your speech be free of malice, avoiding ornate or deceitful words.
Be upright in all matters, never committing verbal transgressions.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Sixth Precept: Do not indulge in anger; harmonize your temperament.
Preserve your spirit from harm, avoiding all misdeeds.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you or vie for fame and rank.
In all matters, yield and retreat, guiding others to liberation.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures or slander the sacred texts.
Cultivate devotion to the Dharma, ever as if standing before the gods.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Ninth Precept: Do not contend over right and wrong or disparage the four assemblies.
Heaven and humanity will resent it, harming your spirit and qi.
Can you uphold this?"*

*"The Tenth Precept: In all actions and deeds, align with the will of heaven.
Always practice great compassion, universally delivering those in distress.
Can you uphold this?"*

The Heavenly Worthy says: *"There are two kinds of precepts: those with attainment and those without.
The precepts of attainment—Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, Three Hundred Great Precepts—restrain evil and prevent wrongdoing but lack expedient means; these are called the precepts of attainment.
They keep one from the three evil destinies and the sufferings of the human realm but do not lead to the Dao.
If one recognizes the nature of dharmas as ultimately empty and quiescent, this is the true precept—neither held nor transgressed, opening the gate of right contemplation and serving as the root of the Dao.
This is the precept of the home-leaver."*

Next, the *Hymn of Wisdom* is recited.
Next, the disciple kneels to receive the preceptor’s teachings:
*"Now that you have assumed the Daoist appearance and entered the Dharma gate,
from this day forward, in speech and silence, movement and stillness,
you must constantly contemplate the Dao, the scriptures, and the master—these are the Three Treasures, your refuge."*

To contemplate the Dao-Treasure is to suppress and extinguish all evil forms. It is like a vajra blade, cutting through all without exception; like a raging fire, burning all without remainder. Contemplation takes two forms: first, contemplating the Dao-body, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, perfectly subtle and wondrous, supreme in the human realm, the heavens, and the three realms—this is your refuge and shelter. Second, contemplating the Dharma-body, which is like empty space, perfectly full and pure, the true Dao, also called the true body or the Dao-nature. Maintain right contemplation without interruption, and this is called contemplating the Dao.

Next, to contemplate the Scripture-Treasure has three aspects: the *Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen*. Focus the mind in receiving and upholding them, constantly generating faith and reverence, maintaining unwavering visualization. Recognize these teachings as the transcendent Dao, free from杂念, and this is called contemplating the scriptures. If one understands that all dharmas are fundamentally without words, rightly contemplates their true form, and grasps their essential meaning, this too is called contemplating the scriptures—this is the mark of skillful understanding in scripture-contemplation.

Next, to contemplate the Master-Treasure. The Master-Treasure is like a father. Without the master, one cannot attain the Dao. Therefore, one should follow closely, whether near or far, visualizing with the mind’s eye, keeping the master constantly before one, never wavering for even a moment, free from杂念—this is called contemplating the master.

Once these three contemplations are established, one should repay the Four Gratitudes: first, the gratitude to heaven and earth; second, the gratitude to the king and state; third, the gratitude to one’s parents who gave birth to this body; fourth, the gratitude to one’s masters and elders. Next, one should extend aid to the Three Realms: first, to the heavenly beings; second, to the earthly beings; third, to the water-dwelling beings.

You must generate great goodwill, offering incense at dawn and lamps at dusk, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. Before the great Dao, present banners, flowers, fruits, and other offerings, prostrating in worship. First, vow for the emperor’s longevity and the peace of the state and family. Next, vow for your parents and the nine generations of ancestors, both departed and living, to receive blessings, and for yourself to attain the Dao. Next, vow for the longevity of your masters and the flourishing of the Dharma-community. Next, vow for the patrons of the ten directions to constantly receive the shade of the Dao. Next, vow for friends and companions on the Dao-path, those who study and understand, to swiftly fulfill their original aspirations and bring glory to their clans.

Next, you should guide and transform all sentient beings, enabling them to form great good affinities with the Three Clarities and the myriad sages. Whether building temples, creating scriptures and images, or ordaining Dharma-bodies to leave the household life, this is benefiting both self and others, generating boundless merit.

Always cultivate gentleness and humility; do not be harsh or overbearing. As the scriptures say: “The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong.” In all ceremonies and rituals, rise at the opening of quietude and rest at its closing. Among the great assembly, do not raise your voice; step with composure and care, never acting coarsely. Unless ill, do not drink alcohol or consume meat. At every vegetarian feast, refrain from laughter or idle talk; sit upright with crossed legs, inspiring reverence in humans and gods.

When receiving guests, first compose your expression. Whether rich or poor, noble or humble, respond with appropriate expedient means. Do not slight the poor and humble while favoring the rich and noble. Robes, headdresses, shoes, and sleeves should be clean and simple, never ostentatious or extravagant. Furthermore, do not kill any living being; whenever you see others killing, you must exhort and guide them.

Do not speak of others’ faults; even if you know their hidden transgressions, do not expose them. If you violate this precept, after death you will forever fall into evil destinies—hungry ghosts, animals—enduring all manner of suffering. Always draw near to good friends and virtuous companions; never associate with wicked or harmful people.

Do not serve ghosts and spirits or study heterodox methods, lest you defile the pure teachings and incur karmic retribution. Whether ascending the sacred altar or attending scripture assemblies, hold the ritual tablet with solemn care, as if standing before the lord and father. When relieving yourself day or night, do not face north; remove your robes and seek a secluded place, avoiding shrines and those of high status. Afterward, wash your hands before handling your Dharma-robes.

If you suddenly encounter your master, elders, or respected seniors wearing a warm hat or a square kerchief, remove them at once, bow deeply, and greet them with reverence. Always harbor compassion, rescuing those in peril. Do not covet fame or profit, hoard wealth, or attack heterodox teachings. Do not practice illusory arts, abandon our teachings to follow other paths, or generate envy that disrupts the Dao-mind. These are the essentials of cultivation.

In every movement and stillness, adhere to the Ten Rules of Dignified Conduct, thus avoiding violations of the precepts and transgressions of the regulations. Having left the household life, you inherit and uphold the Dharma, entering the wondrous and merging with the Dao. You must cast aside the Three Evils, purify the Six Sense-Faculties, encourage loyalty and filial piety, and inspire others to delight in goodness. Do not engage in secret schemes, stir up disputes, slander others, indulge in lust, act arrogantly, bully the weak with strength, or oppress others with power.

Do not steal from the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures, nor from sacred images, robes, or ritual implements. If you steal these, your eyebrows and beard will fall out, your feet will become lame, your hands crippled, and after death you will enter the cold springs, enduring all manner of suffering. Always be filial to your masters and parents. When you see male and female Daoists, support one another without distinction, transforming difference into kinship.

Use clothing, goods, grains, vegetables, and other items with care. When you meet male and female disciples, always expound the scriptures and guide them into our Dharma-gate, enabling them to awaken to the profound mystery, prostrating before the sagely and true with full devotion. Serve your masters morning and evening, inquiring after their well-being, seeing them off and welcoming them back, bowing deeply with reverence.

Maintain purity and tranquility, practicing non-action. Do not let wealth, status, fame, or profit disturb your body or mind. Cultivate hidden virtues to establish karmic causes for this life and the next, aspiring to encounter immortals and realize the supreme Dao. Moreover, the salvation of the nine generations of ancestors depends on you.

The salvation or damnation of the nine generations of ancestors rests upon you. You must purify your heart and focus your intent, directing your thoughts without error, for all sages and worthies witness clearly.

First, pay homage to the Three Masters and vow to uphold their teachings and precepts. Next, lead the newly ordained in bowing to the Three Masters: first to the Scripture Master. The refined decrees of the Perfected, the sagely edicts of the Most High, encompass the jade scrolls of the Three Caverns and honor the golden tablets of the Nine Heavens. Within verdant satchels and purple cases, cloud-chambered treasure halls hold the eight thousand sacred texts and transmit the forty thousand great kalpas. As a Daoist, you must first serve the Scripture Master. In all recitation and upholding of scriptures, avoid defilement or disrespect. With utmost sincerity, pay homage to the Scripture Master with three bows.

Next, bow to the Register Master. The jade registers of the lofty Perfected, the golden talismans of the Most High, govern the dragon scripts and phoenix seals of the Eight Radiant Realms, preserving the precious strategies and jade charts of the Three Clarities. These are the numinous voices of the host of sages and the hidden languages of the myriad heavens. As a Daoist, you must serve the Register Master. Whenever wearing registers or deploying talismans, ensure their use is for bestowing merit and spreading virtue. With utmost sincerity, pay homage to the Register Master with three bows.

Next, bow to the Preceptor. The true master who transforms and guides, the transcendent sage who liberates from the mundane. Those who receive their ordination don the star crown and moon mantle; those who bear their guidance ascend the profound precepts of the great ordination. Gradually shedding the traces of worldly dust, they attain the ranks of immortals. As a Daoist, you must reverently serve the Preceptor. Bearing this true blessing forever, you must always hold faith and reverence. With utmost sincerity, pay homage to the Preceptor with three bows.

Next, recite the Twelve Vows. Then, chant the *Ode to Learning Immortality*. Next, perform the *Dedication of Merit*. Then, lead the newly ordained in bowing to the merits of the Great Dao. Finally, bow again to the Preceptor and others.

*The Rites of Transmission and Ordination for Daoist Monastics, by the Most High, concludes.*
