**Monitoring Master and Endorsing Master, the Orthodox Master of the Celestial Masters, styled "True Response," declares:**

The Most High established the Dao’s teachings, transmitting its learning through the ages. Thus, successive generations of Perfected Masters have expounded the precious instructions, guiding those of karmic affinity in an unbroken line. By virtue of our ancestral blessings, we have borne the grace of the state through the ages, inheriting the title of the Orthodox Unity lineage and reviving the ancestral heritage of Mount Tianmu. Yet as the transmission of registers and scriptures has grown distant over time, we have selected skilled artisans to carve wood and produce books, ensuring their enduring legacy.

As for the precepts of restraint, compassion, and mercy—from antiquity to the sagely ones, none have been unaware of these. Those who ascend the altar as faithful devotees must each purify their inner vision, accumulate merit through virtuous deeds, and may their aspirations all be fulfilled. From this point, transcending the mundane to enter the wondrous, their covenants shall be luminously recorded—how could one not be reverent?

**The Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Vast Subtlety, states:**

Our lineage, through the talismans and registers of the Most High, has delivered salvation to heaven and humanity, safeguarding the nation’s destiny for over fifteen hundred years. The ancestral instructions are abundantly clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?

Yet when our former Perfected Lord encountered the sagely dynasty’s unification of the realm, he was first honored with reverence. The people of Jiangnan, from the highest to the humblest, were all placed under our governance. Since inheriting this teaching, I have served three imperial courts, repeatedly receiving the radiance of imperial favor. At the ascension of the dragon-throned emperor, I was specially granted a resplendent title: for my solemnity, I was likened to the Vacant Tranquility; for my reverent dignity, to the Harmonious Emptiness. Official ranks were conferred following Tang precedent, and lands were enfeoffed in the state of Liu.

We perform good deeds, transmit the registers and scriptures, and thereby continue the ancestral legacy. We pray for blessings and avert calamities for the people, reverently upholding the sagely instructions. How could we not diligently transmit the registers and talismans, further illuminating the path of enlightenment? Above, we respond to the august mandate of the Son of Heaven; below, we bestow upon the common people the supreme felicity of the imperial standard. May we ever fulfill our timely devotion, that great fortune may be secured.

**Endorsing Master of the Orthodox Unity Altar, Master of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Registers of the Highest Clarity (name), now endorses the following:**

The devout believer (name), having received and venerated the register of the Most High, Mysterious Heavenly Perfected Warrior, Supreme General of the Unsurpassed, now pledges body and soul to its observance. This altar has already prepared the register’s details and personally petitioned the Orthodox Unity Succession Celestial Master Perfected Lord to report to the Ancestral Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, for transmission in accordance with the statutes. Herewith, a certificate is issued as testimony, that the recipient may uphold and practice the teachings. Should one violate this covenant, they shall incur the divine judgment of the Mysterious Tribunal.

**Here concludes the petition for the register of the Most High, Mysterious Heavenly Perfected Warrior, Supreme General of the Unsurpassed.**
