**General Preface to the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Method**

It is said that before the Ultimate Non-Polarity, all was undifferentiated and unfathomable. At the dawn of primordial chaos, clarity and turbidity first took form. The vault of heaven floated above, vast and boundless through eons; the qi of spontaneity governed the fundamental principles. As Qian revolved and Kun stood firm, the myriad beings were born; as the mechanisms of transformation unfolded, the Five Scripts shone forth. That which germinated in the heavens condensed into clouds and formed talismanic seals. That which descended to the human world was translated into written chapters. It revealed the triggers of virtue and power, and established the ladder to transcendence.

From the Dragon Han era onward, the Great Vehicle was taught. By the Yan Kang era, the Middle Grade was transmitted. Thus, the legacy of the *Dongxuan* (Cavern Mystery) flourished in divine transformations. Later generations applied its methods through purification rites and memorial petitions, yet its regulations, oral instructions, methods, talismans, and sacred texts were scattered across various works. The *Dongxuan* corpus, with its vast array of sections and boundless literary expanse, found its deepest essence distilled in the single scroll of the *Scripture of Salvation*. Within it lay the profound mechanisms of deliverance: inwardly, through refinement and transcendence, one could ascend to the Real and cross over the world; outwardly, through meritorious deeds and completion of tasks, one could bring blessings to the manifest and aid the hidden. Its arcane instructions and numinous sounds were all contained within, though its principles remained obscure, and the world could not fully comprehend them.

From the middle ages onward, the traditions branched into many schools. Master Lu Xiujing of the Song, known as the Simplicity and Tranquility Master, distinguished the sources of the Three Caverns and categorized the Four Supplements, gradually establishing order in the regulations. By the Tang, Master Du Guangting of the Broad Completion lineage compiled the *Yellow Register Purification Rites* in forty scrolls, based on the scriptural injunctions. Thus, the regulations were perfected, the canonical forms fully manifested, spanning antiquity and surpassing the present to become a model for all ages. When the work was completed and revealed, it aligned with the auspicious signs of the numinous heavens, and neither the world nor later generations dared to transgress it.

However, talismans and official documents were not included in the purification rites. Those who propagated the teachings transmitted them to one another. Thus, the talismans, incantations, and instructions from the various scriptures of the Central Cavern were gathered and compiled into a single work, fundamentally rooted in the *Scripture of Salvation*. The scriptures are the foundation of the methods, while the methods are the application of the scriptures. The methods derive from the Numinous Treasure and belong to the *Dongxuan* tradition, hence they are called the *Numinous Treasure Great Method*. Within these scriptures, all that could open the way for the lost souls, benefit and protect the living, talismanic writings, and ritual techniques were comprehensively collected and recorded, forming a radiant and interconnected whole. This allowed those who inherited the methods to practice without undue effort.

In ancient purification rites of the highest grade, their efficacy could silently move heaven, and through visualization and alignment with things, they were not readily practiced by ordinary people. In other purification rites, sincerity and devotion were paramount, with memorial petitions as the primary means. Later generations added official documents and memorials, adapting secular practices to supplement what the written petitions could not fully express. Once the ritual office was established, the registers of the *Dongxuan* corpus were placed at its head. The alignment of method and register served as ranks, enabling communication with the Supreme Mystery and traversing the Three Realms, necessitating the observance of proper forms.

Having established ranks and arranged documents, seals and talismans could not be absent. As for those who attained the Dao and ascended, they received true offices in the celestial realms—such as Xu Jingyang as the Grand Immortal Historian, Liu Kuan as the Supreme Marshal of Youthful Beginnings, the Orthodox Celestial Master receiving the Jade Seal of Lord Lao, and Fei Changfang receiving the talismanic register from Master Hu. These were divine transmissions from the heavenly realms, the so-called true seals and offices of transcendents. In the present age, those who inherit the registers and practice the rites do so through transmission from their masters. They open the gradual path to refinement and the essential road to establishing merit, which does not depend on the complexity of seals or the loftiness of ranks.

In recent times, compilations of the *Numinous Treasure Great Method* have proliferated. Some extend to one hundred and twenty scrolls, seemingly overly detailed, incorporating nearly all the scriptures of the Three Caverns. Wang Shengqing of Futang compiled a version in twenty scrolls, which is more moderate, though it focuses heavily on worldly rites, dividing them into bureaus and offices, and includes preemptive purification rituals without scriptural basis. Such works, while largely sound, contain minor flaws. Others have condensed it into twenty scrolls, which is concise and appropriate, yet those newly initiated into the methods often struggle to grasp their origins. There are also compilations that arrange methods according to the scriptures, adapting the rituals within to practical use—these are truly rooted in the source. However, the world sometimes refers to them as the *Great Method of Salvation* or claims they derive from a separate tradition within the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures.

The transmitted versions in the world are numerous, and not all can be examined. Though they may not fully align with the grand principles of the numinous intent, they are roughly practicable. After the Shaoxing era, in the regions east of the Zhe River, many followed the *Forty-Nine Grades of Tiantai*, failing to understand the original intent behind the earlier compilations. At the outset of their prefaces, they directly stated: "The *Numinous Treasure Great Method* is the foremost of the thirty-six revered scriptures and the root of the nine grades of transcendents and numinous spirits." They claimed that all the compiled words in the methods were uttered by the Celestial Emperor. Yet they did not realize that talismanic memorials, purification rites, altar arrangements, written prohibitions, exorcisms, prayers, and apotropaic rituals were all established after the middle ages in response to circumstances, adapting to the times to assist the primordial transformations and promote the numinous winds. They were not methods originating from antiquity that could not be practiced in later ages.

Nevertheless, by selecting the essential wonders from the scriptures and gathering the talismanic chapters from various canons—some received from extraordinary individuals, others bestowed by transcendents—all that could establish merit and propagate transformation was compiled into the methods of the Middle Vehicle.

Yet these were not the words of the Celestial Emperor from the age of high antiquity. In each narrative passage, however, they would invoke the title "Mysterious Master," thereby displacing the ranks of the Celestial Emperor and styling the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy as the Mysterious Master. They presumed that every word and discourse issued from the Heavenly Worthy, failing to scrutinize carefully—such was the prevailing tendency. Once the original source was lost, the very structure of the teachings grew increasingly distorted. Thus, in their talismans they sought the extraordinary; in their seals and scripts, they multiplied endlessly; in their ritual offices, they pursued the utmost exaltation; and in their practice, they indulged in deception. When transmitting these methods, they would pass down a single volume, copying one another in succession, with masters and disciples scarcely delving deeply, inquiring broadly, questioning, debating, or verifying. Delusion was transmitted as delusion, each mystifying their own doctrines.

Now, the Three Qi of Mysterious Origin—Primordial, Original, and Initial—are the root and origin of the myriad transformations. From the Three Qi, the Two Modes were established; once the Two Modes were fixed, the ten thousand things were born. Humans, endowed with the complete qi of central harmony, thus embody the great form of Heaven and Earth. As their qi and blood move, they intimately align with yin and yang, for the human body is modeled on Heaven and Earth in its generation and completion—not that this body *is* Heaven and Earth. The essence of cultivation lies in the gate of preserving the Three and guarding the One, which is the very foundation of talismanic texts and the dispatch of spirits. By qi uniting with qi and spirit resonating with spirit, one aspires to communion between Heaven and humanity in the realm of the indistinct. Such matters are not for those who lack even a rudimentary understanding of the Dao; the methods only hint at their subtle meaning.

The *Taishan* texts differ in their intent, yet they incorporate the "Flying Mysterious Three Qi Seal" from elsewhere into their rituals to authenticate memorials, as if the seal had a proper origin. This bears no relation to the registers of the *Dongxuan* or the methods of the *Lingbao*. Moreover, they do not realize that if qi can be "flown mysteriously," then the spirit is already ascending—how much less can the subtleties of the Three Qi be confined to a carved seal? Those who practice these methods today often contradict one another: seals share the same name but differ in their script, and some even combine characters from scriptures to form seals—countless variations exist.

A seal is a token of trust, a mark of authentication for official documents, like the seals of officials appointed in the world. Just as every office has its seal, from the sovereign and father to the scholar and commoner, all recognize it as a sign of authority. For instance, in practicing the *Tianxin* Orthodox Methods, the seal of the Bureau of Expelling Demons serves as the mark, for these are the statutes of orthodox practice, staffed by officials of the demon-expelling bureau—thus this seal authenticates its documents. In transmitting the registers of the *Dongxuan* rank, the *Lingbao* serves as the office. The old rituals only mention the Southern Bureau under the Three Heavens' Gates, with the *Lingbao* Great Dharma Office as its bureau, so its seal authenticates its documents—this is the proper insignia of the bureau.

Yet now they have added the "Seal of the Supreme Three Heavens," calling it both "Three Heavens" and "Supreme"—neither a rank of registers nor an office of methods. This is but one of the most glaring violations of principle. Beyond this, seals proliferate in confusion, their multiplicity a waste of misdirected effort. Recently, those who study antiquity have attempted to compile ritual codes and statutes, yet they still incorporate talismanic scripts and seal scripts from the *Tiantai* methods, mingling jade with stone, intertwining the orthodox and the heterodox.

As for ritual offices, since most people have not received true transmission, have not received registers at the ancestral altar, nor sought methods from masters and peers, they treat registers as ranks and methods as offices—practitioners have no choice but to comply. The *Tiantai* methods, however, style themselves as "Heirs Leading the Teaching" or even "Ancestral Masters," further inventing titles like "Jade Steps Immortal Ministers" and "Supreme Perfected Lords of the Great Ultimate" to adorn their credentials, evoking awe and dread.

Yet humans, as creatures, are endowed with pure essence to form this single spirit. As for their humble form, it is but the union of their parents' qi and blood into an embryo. As they grow, the hundred grains and myriad things nourish their bodies, from the subtle to the manifest—nothing but the dust of the earth. Thus, the *Thirty-Nine Poems of Yunfang* states:
*"The four great elements of this body are all yin—*
*I know not what thing is the yang essence."*
Indeed, the five limbs, hundred bones, blood, fluids, flesh, and marrow of humans are all yin in nature. Only the superior adept, refining the original and smelting the root, exhausts yin and purifies yang, becoming as clear as Heaven—this is the rank of immortals. Yet even they must receive registers from grotto-heavens and serve in the offices of immortal bureaus. When they ascend lightly, they must still account for merits and transgressions, tallying their deeds before they can stride upon the clouds and mist, soaring through the celestial vastness. The ranks of immortals are not lightly attained.

Yet in this degenerate age, ordinary mortals—earthbound, impure in substance—wear registers and transmit methods, serving merely as officials of the earthly realm’s teaching offices. They have not penetrated the subtleties of refining the Five Qi and Three Clouds, nor mastered the profound work of the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions. Drifting through the dusty world, their future is unknowable; tossed by the mundane waves, their past lives are obscure. The time of their ascension is distant indeed, yet they hastily claim exalted titles, styling themselves as immortals and perfected beings, using such designations in their credentials—blaspheming Heaven and flouting the Dao. How could "Immortal Ministers" and "Perfected Lords" be offices fit for the earthly realm?

For instance, in the ritual of offering to the Dipper to extend prayers and exorcisms, this is but one affair within the *Lingbao* Great Methods. Among the twenty-four ranks, it is merely called the "Northern Dipper Ritual for Eliminating Disasters." Yet those who practice the *Lingbao* methods in the *Tiantai* tradition, seeking to establish their own lineage and transmit it to others, saw the *Xuanji* registers from the Xuanhe era and thus compiled various doctrines to create the *Xuanji* methods. They established the Mysterious Numinous *Xuanji* Office, appending a postscript to trace their sources. Works like the *Northern Dipper Sutra*, *Pervasive Charts*, and others are listed thereafter. Though the words in their methods derive from these texts, who authorized the creation of this seal?

Holding the title "Director of the *Xuanji* Office," or for those born as commoners, styling oneself "Celestial Inspector of the Supreme Palace"—what does this signify? If there were indeed a *Xuanji* Office, it would be but a palace of the Dipper stars; for a mortal to preside over it would be to rank oneself among the Dipper stars. The office of inspector, unknown in Han or Wei times, later became a court appointment for provincial censors—a role far removed from the methods of the Dao. They fail to understand that one who receives the *Zhengyi* registers and practices the *Tianxin* orthodox methods may freely offer sincere prayers, draft petitions, and perform Dipper rituals—what need is there for further restrictions? Even when advancing to the *Dongxuan* ritual registers, the Northern Dipper rites remain but one affair within the methods; must one invent yet another title before presiding over them?

If every rank of fast or lineage of transmission required a new office, and every grade of ritual demanded a fresh title, then the twenty-seven ranks of ancient fasts and forty-two grades of rituals would necessitate the addition of dozens more official positions before they could be properly conducted. Would this not lead to endless confusion, rendering their offices and titles devoid of canonical basis? In all matters of presiding over fasts and rituals, submitting memorials and petitions, praying for rain or clear skies, delivering the dead and transcending the living, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished—why then establish so many varied titles, proliferating ranks and positions? The registers and ranks of the methods exist to complete the forms; talismans, seals, and script serve to express intent. Yet now, with ranks and titles carried to such extremes, some abandon the canonical compilations and resort to fabrication and deceit.

For instance, at the outset of a fast or ritual, the High Priest grandly displays a proclamation declaring that on a certain day, he silently ascended to the Celestial Court to report the affair—this is nothing short of absurd. The art of preserving form and abiding in the world finds its truest principle in the Golden Elixir alone; this is the proper focus of those who seek immortality. Beyond this, practices such as refining *qi* and ingesting mist, consuming elixirs and medicinal herbs, absorbing light and exhaling breath, or emulating the bear’s stretch and the bird’s reach—though varied—cannot directly achieve the coagulation of lead and mercury or the internal formation of the Golden Elixir. Thus, they are called the "three thousand six hundred minor methods of side doors," of which silent ascent to the Celestial Court is but one.

These methods, which involve the ascent and descent of inner workings to culminate in the Mud Pill Palace, may extend life and ward off illness when practiced correctly, but when misapplied, they risk disturbing the spirit and harming the will. Yet even those who specialize in such practices rarely achieve success in recent times; they are not methods by which one may penetrate heaven and earth to attain true realization. As for the inner flourishing of the fiery jujube, the external severance of yin demons, union with the Dao, the generation of a body beyond the body, the ascent of the spirit to face the Nine Purities, and the far-reaching vision to observe all things—these are the moments in the *Lingbao* methods when one beholds the Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity, where form and spirit are both perfected, cut off from the clamor of the dust, awaiting the appointed time to ascend directly to the Golden Gates. Those who attain this stage do not perform worldly rituals or enter the altar; having beheld the Celestial Perfected in person, they no longer require memorials, documents, or the cadences of ritual chant—this is no mere silent ascent to the Celestial Court.

Now, with altars raised high and mats spread wide, images displayed and rites arranged, documents piled high with copied petitions—these are the proper forms of ritual practice, yet they claim it as "silent ascent to the Celestial Court." To assert that one may present one’s intent directly to heaven is to deceive mortals; can heaven be deceived as well? The compilations are filled with deviations from orthodox principles. These texts emerged at the beginning of the Southern Crossing, nearly a century ago, and their heterodox doctrines have since spread throughout eastern Zhe, growing more entrenched with each passing year. Later students, accustomed to such practices, have come to accept them as normal, corrupting the canonical traditions without end.

The teachings of the Most High are revered without being exalted further, and slighted without being debased; they require no defense of right or refutation of wrong. Yet those who later display their ranks and practice these methods, violating the forms and losing the classics, not only incur guilt before the offices of the Three Officials and Five Emperors but also risk the scorn of future generations. Should discerning scholars arise, they may well echo the lament, "Is there no one left?" To attempt correction might provoke the anger of those who inherit these methods, so they sit idly by as the sacred texts are defiled, daring not to speak a word.

Whenever I observe these obstructions, my spirit trembles with fear. This is not mere speculation or personal conjecture; even a child of three, judging with an impartial heart, would recognize their errors. Fortunately, I have avoided entanglement in these false and deceptive paths and do not acknowledge the misguidance of later generations. I respectfully adhere to the essential teachings of my masters, consulting the established works of various schools to ensure conformity with ancient rites, and have compiled this modest collection. Though it may seem lacking in humility, I believe that to hold a position is to bear its responsibilities. Moreover, having long worn the registers and transmitted the talismans, I have been graced with the protection of the numinous and donned the cap of stars and feathers of transcendence. Though I have only roughly compiled the fundamental methods and do not rank among those directly ordained by the Heavenly Perfected, I have nonetheless been stained by inclusion among the offices of the earthly realm.

Furthermore, as one who bears hair and teeth, endowed with nature and form, every aspect of my being—down to the slightest detail—derives from the primordial *qi* of the Original Ancestor, the gift of August Heaven, the blessing of the Great Dao. How can this not be weighty? To hold a position yet shirk its duties—how can this be permissible? Thus, undeterred by slander, I have roughly assembled these writings. If my words somewhat accord with the canons, I shall share them with my fellow students. If they deviate from the established forms, I hope that those of higher understanding will correct them. Therefore, I briefly outline the beginnings and ends of this matter at the start of the scroll.

I dare not deliberately advance perilous arguments to elevate myself at others’ expense. My aim is merely to lightly revise the later additions, largely adhering to the old rules, aligning with reason and rooted in sources, without disdaining the commonplace. What strays from the canons and lacks foundation is not prized for its novelty. Just as Lu Xiujing distinguished the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, and Du Guangting established the classics and fixed the forms, I now make this account public to settle the methods. Thus, "those who speak shall bear no fault, and those who hear shall take heed."

Yet I, Yunzhong, have observed that compilers of liturgical manuals in recent times invariably conceal their essential techniques. Even those who serve as preceptors, though they themselves have gained no true attainment, still withhold and obscure texts that ought not be restricted. Some go so far as to alter ancient scriptures, excise established methods, and render them incomplete—all to parade novelty and peddle secrets, luring disciples to seek transmission from them. This is not confined to the Ritual Methods of the Numinous Treasure alone; all liturgical manuals suffer the same fate. The world has grown so shallow and dissolute as to reach this extremity.

To be sure, the subtle mechanisms and wondrous insights that enable one to ascend lightly and soar aloft ought not be openly recorded and widely disseminated. But methods for delivering the world, establishing merit, aiding others, and benefiting all beings—how can these be omitted entirely? Though I, Yunzhong, have not yet heard the teachings for transcending the world or the secrets of ascent, I have fortunately developed some discernment between orthodoxy and heterodoxy in the practices now current. In compiling this work, I take the commodification of the Dao as a grave warning and dare not deliberately conceal or omit anything. The cultivation, visualization, functions, and salvation rituals of the Numinous Treasure are all set forth in full. Nothing of substance is missing; every principle is grounded and attested, not a single detail omitted. Yet accounts of the bizarre and baseless, though detailed, are not included. Where meanings form a continuum, they are not split across two scrolls. Where methods are interdependent, they are not sundered. Scattered passages in old books are gathered and arranged in order. Matters touching on other texts are examined and explained. The annotations are organized by topic, all verifiable in practice. Even the most stringent precepts and prohibitions within the methods—those never before committed to writing—are now fully preserved in their proper categories.

Once this book is completed, I shall present it to the Supreme Mystery, announcing it to the Three Realms. Before Heaven, I shall vow to propagate the Perfect Teaching far and wide. Scholars of the Dao ought to broaden their knowledge and experience. Nowadays, in famous mountains and blessed lands, in remote regions and secluded valleys, in forests and springs, even amidst the dust of the marketplace, men of the Dao surely exist. The pity is that they cannot widely visit and study under many masters to distinguish true immortals. Yet they must at least gain some understanding of the various schools current today. Among both householders and renunciates who inherit and transmit the Numinous Treasure, how many lineages of the Numinous Treasure now remain? Only then can one examine the orthodoxy or heterodoxy, depth or shallowness of one’s own attainment. If one clings solely to the first teachings one received and rejects all others, sitting at the bottom of a well yet discoursing on the heavens, one is no true devotee of the Teaching.

May scholars further calm their minds and scrutinize the origins of things, lest they daily drift further onto paths of deviation and betrayal of the Dao. This is my, Yunzhong’s, deepest wish.

I, Yunzhong, have received transmission from three preceptors in the scriptural lineage, all of the Central Plains tradition. Their names are recorded at the end of this scroll. I do not presume to advance my own views to deceive the world. Rather, since the essential instructions of my teachers were mostly transmitted orally and committed to memory, I feared that with the passage of time they would be lost. Thus, I have arranged the ancient texts in order, concealing the transmission only lightly within them, all for the sake of the Teaching.

**Section on the Precepts of this Method: The Ten Precepts**

**The Ten Precepts**

1. Maintain an impartial mind; do not deceive yourself.
2. Serve your lord and teachers with loyalty; honor and revere Heaven and Earth, father and mother.
3. Extend kindness and benevolence to all things; practice frugality and moderation in life.
4. Maintain purity and uprightness; do not form cliques or factions.
5. Reverently follow the supreme Daoist methods; deeply believe in cultivating the self.
6. Respect ghosts and spirits; do not treat them with contempt.
7. All clothing and food derive from the primordial qi of the Original Beginning; do not entertain extraneous thoughts.
8. Use ash-water to cleanse impurities; do not indulge in adornment.
9. Recite with the mouth and bow with the heart; do not exhaust the body.
10. After seven days of profound stillness, the radiance of spirit will become serene, and the sacred realm of Jade Clarity will be revealed.

**The Twelve Virtues**
Do not kill, do not harm, do not envy, do not covet, do not engage in licentiousness, do not steal, do not be greedy, do not be desirous, do not hate, do not slander, do not speak with florid embellishment, do not utter harsh words.

Yunzhong once reflected: What should those who adorn themselves with careful conduct strive for? Only by devoting oneself to upholding the Daoist methods and performing the rituals can one then transform virtue and distance oneself from transgression. The Dao of immortal cultivation does not merely consist of exhausting worldly practices. To attain inner integrity and outer purity, with clarity within and without, is the first step on the ladder of the Daoist methods. Even the loftiest perfected beings and supreme sages still accumulate merit through fasting and abstinence. Thus, precepts and disciplines serve to cultivate virtue and restrain the body and mind—this is the foremost duty of the student.

The methods by which the sages governed the world invariably began with cultivating the self and ordering the household, and only then could they govern the state and bring peace to the world. All things proceed from within to without. If the precepts of this method are placed first, yet one fails to practice them, the self loses its rectitude. Then, at home, one cannot properly guide one’s wife and children; abroad, one cannot gain the trust of friends. How, then, can one face the Supreme Emperor and commune with the divine?

The precepts and disciplines of the Daoist canon are scattered throughout the scriptures and edicts, with numerous clauses and items. It would be impractical to record them all here. The precepts of the Numinous Treasure method are to be integrated with the scriptures as they appear.

Regarding the Twelve Virtues, one version omits "do not speak with florid embellishment" and "do not utter harsh words," using "do not kill" and "do not harm" as the Ten Precepts. Another older version includes annotations beneath each clause. However, these twelve matters were originally established for those cultivating the Daoist methods. If one adheres strictly to their true meaning and acts accordingly, what harm is there? There is no need for exhaustive explanations. If interpretations stray slightly from the original intent, they may instead mislead later generations. Thus, I have now removed them, preserving only the original text.

**Seven Interconnected Matters**

1. Clarifying how the primordial qi of the Original Beginning first transformed into the Jade Script before giving rise to the myriad things.
2. Clarifying how the generation and nurturing of the primordial chaos shaped and refined the myriad things.
3. Clarifying how the Numinous Treasure naturally gave form to the sacred texts, encompassing all phenomena and serving as the pivotal mechanism of the Three Powers.
4. Clarifying how the Numinous Treasure is the ancestral teaching of the Three Caverns, giving birth to all sages.
5. Clarifying how the human body models itself after the Original Beginning, establishing the primordial chaos and the sacred embryo of the dharma-body.
6. Clarifying how, before the formless primordial qi of the Original Beginning took shape, what analogy could describe it? When it descended and congealed into qi, it transformed and gave birth to the myriad treasures. What form does it take in the present world? How can one refine this qi into an elixir and consume it to ascend as a perfected being?
7. Clarifying how attaining the Dao of the Numinous Treasure enables one to ascend at dawn in broad daylight, or to attain long life and transcend the world, or to achieve liberation through the corpse, among the myriad methods fully expounded in the scriptures.

Yunzhong carefully examined these matters: Though the Numinous Treasure is considered a middle vehicle of the Dao, it in fact encompasses the Three Caverns and contains all methods. It establishes the root and clarifies the source—students should understand its beginning and end.

Before the Dao took form, prior to Heaven and Earth, the natural ancestral qi initiated the birth of the myriad beings. When this qi coalesced into patterns and condensed into clouds as script, the sacred texts emerged. From this, teachings were established, disciplines were transmitted, and beings were delivered and guided—all through the application of the Daoist methods.

Yet the methods arise from the scriptures, and the scriptures contain the wondrous subtleties of the Dao. How could they be confined merely to the practices of fasting, cultivation, prohibitions, and incantations? If one can deeply penetrate the mysterious mechanism and glimpse the numinous mysteries, one must use the methods to understand the scriptures, and through the scriptures, awaken to the Dao. To comprehend the Dao within the Dao is to transcend the Three Realms and the Six Extremes.

Our singular spirit is not inherently deluded. Our singular qi naturally aligns with the true Dao. Yet in later generations, reckless and deceitful individuals have propagated absurd and baseless theories, making them unfathomable. They fabricate countless deceptions, confusing and misleading the world, drowning their own authenticity and destroying their own nature. How lamentable!

Thus, I have begun with the precepts to open the path, followed by clarifying the Seven Matters to first understand the essence and function of the scriptures. Only then can one examine the intent behind the Four Translations and the composition of the texts—this is the gateway to the methods. Such is the sequence of compiling the scriptures and methods in this work.

**The Four Translations of the Scriptures**

1. The Jade Script emerged before the void, and the divine script lay hidden within the primordial chaos. When the Crimson Clarity revealed the diagram, the Original Beginning proclaimed and expounded the secret names. This is the First Translation, known as the Great Brahma Jade Script.
2. The Dao Lord inscribed the secret names of the Jade Script, and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign recorded its text. This is the Second Translation, called the Script of the Eight Assemblies of the Various Heavens.
3. The Dao Lord compiled and arranged the Numinous Treasure scriptures into the *Complete Scriptures*. This is the Third Translation, known as the *Luminous Chapters of Cloud-Script*.
   The Queen Mother of the West transmitted the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans to the Yellow Emperor, and the Dragon Might Master bestowed them upon Great Yu—both are contained within the scriptures. However, as the original text of the scriptures remained unchanged, these are not considered translations.
   When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao on Mount Emei, he personally met the Sovereign and received direct instruction. When the Supreme Perfected transmitted the Dao to the Left Immortal Elder, this was also not a translation of scriptures, and thus is not referred to as such.
4. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yuanfeng era of the Han dynasty, the Queen Mother of the West transmitted these scriptures to Emperor Wu of Han. As the emperor did not understand the language of the Great Brahma, he altered the celestial script of the Jade Script into the common script of the world. This is the Fourth Translation.

Having carefully examined the *Scripture of Salvation for the Multitudes* (*Lingbao Duren Jing*), all ancient records of its transmission consistently affirm that the text was established through four translations, a principle so evident that it admits no arbitrary conjecture or speculative interpretation.

Before the Void, there was neither light nor form. After the Era of Vermilion Clarity, the Jade Script first manifested—this is the First Translation. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign transcribed it into the Correct Sound—this is the Second Translation. The Lord of the Dao compiled and arranged it into scripture—this is the Third Translation. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it to Emperor Wu of Han, who then rendered it into the common script of the world—this is the Fourth Translation. From this point onward, the scripture was transmitted among mortals without further additions or omissions.

Yet the Tiantai school presents an independent claim, asserting in the seventeenth fascicle of its *Canonical Regulations and Ritual Standards* that there exists a fifth translation. It falsely attributes the compilation of talismanic diagrams to the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct within the Registers of the Central Alliance, and further misrepresents the *Three Caverns Scriptures* of the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct as the *Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure*. Such assertions are groundless.

When the Supreme Perfected Xu Laile transmitted the Dao of the Numinous Treasure to Master Ge, it was akin to the Celestial Master transmitting the Orthodox Unity teachings, or the Three Mao and Two Xu receiving the lineage of the Cavern of Perfection. These were the patriarchs of the Three Caverns’ transmission of the Dao—not a fifth translation of the *Scripture of Salvation for the Multitudes*.

Moreover, the meaning of "translation" denotes the conveyance of one language into another. It involves interpreting the words of one text to form the characters of another, much as an interpreter discerns the sounds of the four directions. If the *Scripture of Salvation for the Multitudes* had no fifth translation after its descent into the world, how could one willingly embrace such a fabricated theory? Thus, I rely solely on ancient records in compiling this account.

**Preface to the Fascicles of the Scripture**

Burying gold and jade to stabilize the Five Peaks, casting dragon tablets and jade discs into the abyssal seas, and forging the Nine Tripods to secure the Nine Provinces—these three practices exemplify the methods by which emperors and kings cultivate the Dao to pacify and perpetuate the mandate of their realms.

When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, the stellar lodges fall into disarray, the sun and moon lose their proper times of rising and setting, the four seasons deviate from their courses, and yin and yang fall out of harmony—these five conditions illustrate the means to dissolve celestial calamities.

Curing illness refers to using the scriptural methods to restore harmony and well-being. Dispelling poison and harm means averting and exorcising the baleful qi of the celestial divisions and their corresponding terrestrial punishments. Liberating the corpse denotes the Nine Refinements method for ascension—these three practices exemplify the means to ward off poison and harm in the lower realm.

Ascending to the Vermilion Palace, soaring to the Golden Towers, flying to the Southern Palace, feasting in the Jade Capital, roaming the Great Void, crossing to the Southern Palace above, ascending to the Upper Clarity, wandering freely in the Upper Clarity, advancing through the ranks of the Southern Palace, ascending into the Great Void, guiding the soul through the Vermilion Mound, and traversing the Three Realms—these thirteen practices exemplify the methods of ascension and liberation.

All attain longevity, preserve their allotted years, transcend the world, evade death, prosper their households, enable their ancestors to receive liberation, swiftly attain immortality, extend their lifespans, undergo corpse liberation, become Perfected of the Nine Palaces, ensure national peace, ascend to the rank of Immortal Elder, command the respect of demon kings, refine their forms in the Great Yin, become ministers of the Golden Towers to the Sage Lord, receive the homage of the myriad spirits, and gain the protection and sponsorship of demon kings—these seventeen outcomes exemplify the responses to meritorious deeds.

Presenting gold and treasures as pledges of sincerity and swearing oaths before the Ten Heavens—this one practice exemplifies the method of transmission.

---

**Note by Yunzhong:** Ancient records describe the transmission of the scripture through the offering of gold and treasures as pledges of sincerity and oaths sworn before Heaven, as well as the rule that it be transmitted only once every forty thousand kalpas, with oaths sworn before the Ten Heavens. These were originally divided into three separate entries. However, in the scripture’s preface, it is stated that the treasures of the upper heavens are not transmitted to the lower world, and that those who receive the transmission must offer gold and treasures as pledges of sincerity and swear oaths before Heaven—this refers to the proper procedure for receiving the transmission. Within the scripture itself, it is stated that according to the Mysterious Regulations, the text is transmitted only once every forty thousand kalpas. If a worthy individual presents gold and treasures as pledges of sincerity and follows the ancient protocols to swear oaths before the Ten Heavens, only then is the transmission granted. This precisely describes the formal procedure for transmission and should not be listed separately. Thus, only one entry is retained here.

Bringing calamity upon oneself, extending misfortune to nine generations of ancestors, and for revealing secrets or showing contempt—falling into hell: these three outcomes exemplify the consequences of transgression.

Within the scripture, the Great Dao is revealed as the Mother of the primordial qi, the secret names of the roots of existence, the wonders of the Jade Maidens of the Mysterious Perfection, and the ritual implements, music, forms, names, measurements, and the Dao of the Five Constants. These were all prepared in the Primordial Heaven, and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign followed their inherent patterns.

In the Middle Antiquity, teachings for governing the world were composed, and the Great Dao thereby became concealed. Its origins in the Primordial Heaven were no longer known. The sixty-four sentences of esoteric Brahmanic speech within the scripture emerged prior to the opening of the Great Brahman’s diagrams, at the very inception of numerical reckoning. The cycles of inhalation and exhalation harmonize with yin and yang, and the count of breaths manifests in the pulse. Thus, one exhalation measures three inches, and one inhalation measures three inches. Extending this principle to greater lengths, inches accumulate into feet, and feet manifest in physical objects. From this arose the standards of pitch pipes, calendars, measurements, weights, the Five Planets, the Seven Governors, the Eight Trigrams, the Nine Palaces, and the Twenty-Four Solar Terms. The sages took these as their models, crafting instruments based on the length of a foot or the width of a finger.

The scripture encompasses all methods: the inner and outer elixirs, celestial divination, prohibitions, auspicious and inauspicious omens, techniques for divining the past and future, delivering the hidden and elevating the manifest, summoning the Perfected and invoking the numinous, blessing the nation and pacifying households, fostering prosperity and abundance, stabilizing and exorcising, repenting and petitioning—nothing is left unaddressed. The Western Numinous Tortoise Mother translated it into the common script and transmitted it to Emperor Wu of Han, which is why many elements in the scripture follow Han conventions.

Upon close examination, the *Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure* comprehensively records its profound mysteries and systematically presents its regulations. Its categories and examples do not depart from the scripture. Every method and every secret resides within the scripture. Here, I briefly outline its general principles as the foundation for the exposition of its teachings.

The passage following the preface summarizes the essence and function of the scripture. The Tiantai school merely embellished its language, fabricating the "Secret Instructions of the Patriarchs" as the forty-ninth fascicle.

They, failing to deeply examine the principles and broadly survey the various compilations, presumptuously claimed the title of "Secret Instructions of the Patriarchs"—yet these were merely narrative passages, not the practical methods of application. Such individuals, lacking extensive reading, mistakenly regarded their work as rare and arcane. Here, I adhere strictly to the scripture in composing the preface and examples, refraining from fabricating "secret instructions" to deceive others. Scholars who grasp the general outline of the scripture through this may then advance to its practical application—this, too, is but the natural sequence of study.

**Section on Chaptered Exegesis and Application**
*The Supreme Numinous Treasure Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Rank for the Limitless Deliverance of Humankind*
*First Chapter: Account of the Mysterious*

The Dao spoke: "At *you* (酉), these two characters govern sudden darkness at death." Long ago, in the Azure Heaven of Primordial Green, within the Jade Prosperity Ascendant Heaven, the Celestial Void resounded with hymns. The Great Floating Li Emperor—whose name is concealed in hidden language—received the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Rank for the Limitless Deliverance of Humankind* from the Primordial Beginning.

**Chapter Two: Initiating the Cycle**
When the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions. "Was to expound" signifies the opening of this kalpic cycle, the revelation of the chart, and the emergence of the teaching.

**Chapter Three: True Responses**
From the realm of the Great Cavern downward, all worlds were naturally aligned. As he was about to ascend the throne, from *zi* (子) to *wu* (午), one was to pluck a hair and inscribe it with the *Catalyzing Birth and Pacifying Fetus Scripture* for ingestion. The Heavenly Perfected, Supreme Sages, and Exalted Worthies—those of wondrous conduct—folded the upper joint of their middle fingers to inscribe, thereby repelling malevolent spirits. An innumerable host arrived upon the void, riding vermilion clouds through the cinnabar firmament, their jade-green chariots and wheel-borne palanquins shaded by feathered canopies. At *hai* (亥), the flowing essence and jadelike radiance—nine hues in all—governed the kidney’s spherical symbol and cured dream-induced intercourse. Five-colored vapors billowed forth. At *you* (酉), one inscribed and ingested for scant qi. The Great Void shone with resplendent brilliance.

**Chapter Four: Establishing the Ultimate**
For seven days and nights, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of all heavens—along with the jade celestial pivot—halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, and mountains and seas concealed their clouds. At *zi* (子), one swiftly ingested to regulate qi. The heavens were free of drifting haze, and the four qi shone with clarity. From the seventh day downward, this cured eye ailments and other illnesses; one inscribed, burned, and stamped the ashes for ingestion. The land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the entire nation were leveled as one, without distinction of high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in hue, as the host of Perfected attended the throne. The middle joint of the middle finger was used for pacifying dwellings and groundbreaking, and for consecrating earth in incantations.

**Chapter Five: Returning to the Origin**
The origin arose from the generative numbers of the Five Phases and stood upon their consummate numbers. The Mysterious Throne was the seat of the Dharmakāya. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon the void, floating above five-colored lions. At *wu* (午), one ingested to cure heart vexation, heart ailments, and malaria. When the scripture was expounded once through the element of water, the Great Sages of all heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, the deaf throughout the nation regained their hearing. When expounded twice through fire, the blind regained their sight. When expounded thrice through wood, the mute could speak. When expounded four times through metal, the lame, paralyzed, and chronically ill all rose and walked. When expounded five times through earth, those afflicted with long-standing ailments instantly regained their forms. When expounded six times through water, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. When expounded seven times through fire, the aged reverted to youth, and the young grew robust. When expounded eight times through wood, pregnant women, birds, and beasts—whether their offspring were born or unborn—all achieved perfect birth. When expounded nine times through metal, the earth’s treasuries were revealed, and gold and jade emerged. When expounded ten times, withered bones revived and rose as living beings. At that time, every man and woman in the nation turned their hearts in devotion, all received protection and deliverance, and each attained longevity. Those who practiced this Dao achieved immortality and deathlessness.

**Chapter Six: Profound Mystery**
The Dao spoke: At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, at *qian* (乾), first summoned the Boundless Ones of the ten directions before focusing intention. When the scripture was expounded once, the Boundless, Limitless, and Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the East, along with their innumerable host, arrived upon the void. When expounded twice, those of the South arrived in like manner. When expounded thrice, those of the West arrived. When expounded four times, those of the North arrived. When expounded five times, those of the Northeast arrived. When expounded six times, those of the Southeast arrived. When expounded seven times, those of the Southwest arrived. When expounded eight times, those of the Northwest arrived. When expounded nine times, those of the Upper Realm arrived. When expounded ten times, those of the Lower Realm arrived. After ten complete circumambulations, the Heavenly Perfected and Great Spirits of the Boundless Ten Directions arrived simultaneously. The men and women of the nation turned their hearts in devotion, their arrival like fine rain or dense mist. The innumerable host pressed so closely that half the land of the nation sank unevenly, beyond all restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure pearl, as large as a grain of millet—vermilion millet, to be precise. After reciting the *Great Brahmā Hidden Language* forty-nine times and offering prayers, one ingested a single grain to cure all suffering. One visualized the host of Perfected entering the pearl, at *gen* (艮). The pearl hung in the void, five *zhang* above the earth. This was the method of entering the pearl’s millet-grain interior. The Heavenly Perfected, Supreme Sages, Exalted Worthies, and those of wondrous conduct—along with the Utmost Perfected Great Spirits of the Boundless Ten Directions and their innumerable host—all entered the treasure pearl. The celestial beings gazed upward, seeing only a shimmering radiance entering the pearl’s mouth. Once inside, their whereabouts became unknown. The people of the nation dispersed, and the land returned to levelness, no longer uneven or sunken. When the nation’s land had sunk unevenly, the treasure pearl remained suspended. Once all had entered its mouth, the land returned to levelness.

Within the treasure pearl, the Primordial Beginning completed the exposition of the scripture in full. The host of Perfected oversaw the deliverance, receiving it unto themselves. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. *Zao Xian* was the inner taboo name. The ritual matters being roughly concluded, the deities of all heavens returned to their positions. In an instant, all was silent, without lingering resonance.

At that time, the heavenly and mortal beings who encountered the scriptural Dharma were universally delivered and saved, preserving their full lifespans without harm or injury, and the entire land turned in reverence. First, their hearts inclined in devotion; afterward, their reverence deepened. All cultivated hearts of goodness. This entailed the recitation of the Great Peace Incantation, conveying the intent of oaths, expiations, harmony, and unity: no killing, no harm, no envy, no jealousy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no resentment, no florid speech, no harsh words, equal and shared compassion, transforming strangers into kin, bringing national stability and people’s prosperity, and rejoicing in Great Peace. Only by practicing the twelve virtuous deeds above does one align with the Dao of equal and shared compassion, transforming strangers into kin.

**Chapter Seven: The Sanskrit Stanzas Unfolded**
When the scripture first emerged as teaching, the entire nation, having cultivated utmost sincerity, revered and honored it, and all attained deliverance across the world. The four characters "revered and honored" signify that practicing even one of these ensures deliverance.

**Chapter Eight: The Proclamation of Secrets**
The Dao declares: All that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounds within the scripture are the inner names and hidden rhymes of the myriad heavens’ Supreme Emperors, as well as the inner taboo names of demon kings and the concealed appellations of the hundred spirits—these are not ordinary words of the mundane world.

**Chapter Nine: The Perfected Sage**
This is the responsive merit and virtue of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Once the Perfected Sage has attained completion, the Realized One penetrates the profound and investigates the subtle, fully mastering its chapters. Reciting it ten times, the hosts of heavens intone in unison, and the ten thousand emperors offer rites. The heavens chant from afar, and the ten thousand emperors offer rites—thus it is called *The Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the sun and moon pause their radiance, the celestial pivots cease their turning, all demons bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity, the dead return to life, and white bones become human once more.

The following on the sun and moon is an empty dharma: in samādhi, one may perceive all ghostly beings devoid of the Dao, and upon seeing their forms or hearing them, they vanish. If one’s merit is not yet perfected, they cannot be subdued. Without the power of samādhi, one may employ the later Cavern Vision method.

**Chapter Ten: The Ultimate Study**
Scholars of the ultimate study who recite it ten times will have the Five Emperors attend and guard them, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly and demonic beings lose their clarity, and those on the verge of death are delivered, cut off from death and restored to life. The reason for this is that scholars’ defiled qi has not yet dissipated, and their bodies have not yet penetrated the true. Though they summon and command the ten directions, their majesty does not yet govern the celestial administration, and their virtue can only subdue earthly deities, bind demonic spirits, and avert death—but cannot restore life.

**Chapter Eleven: Exhortation to the Dao**
To recite this chapter lightly brings calamity upon oneself; to offer reverent devotion brings prosperity to one’s household, flourishing through the generations, forming good karmic affinities, warding off ten thousand disasters, and having divine beings guard one’s gate.

**Chapter Twelve: In Praise of the Mysterious**
The Venerable and Wondrous One strides alone above the Jade Capital—thus it is called *The Wondrous Scripture of the Great Cavern*. This scripture is venerable and wondrous, striding alone above the Jade Capital. It delivers boundless beings and is the root of the ten thousand Dao. Vast and majestic is the Great Brahmā, its virtue beyond measure. Above the Great Luo Heaven is the Jade Capital Mountain and the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, containing thirty-six Jade Capital Halls, each spanning a hundred thousand *li* in height and breadth, with eaves extending fifty-five thousand *li*.

**Chapter Thirteen: Cultivation and Recitation**
The Dao declares: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will have all the heavens assemble, and the suffering souls of their ancestors across billions of generations will immediately receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. After nine years of refinement, they undergo transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study the ultimate scripture, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain transcendence as immortals, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital in feasting. The merit of those who study diligently surpasses that of mere reciters.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Superior Study**
Scholars of the superior study who cultivate and recite this scripture will immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it extend their years and longevity, and afterward all attain the Dao of liberation through simulated death. Their ethereal souls temporarily vanish, avoiding the underworld, and they swiftly regain their forms, roaming the great void.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Unfolding of the Subtle**
This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering the boundless. All heavenly and mortal beings receive its blessings, and immeasurable fortune extends to the living and the dead. There are regulations and standards.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Covenant of Efficacy**

**Chapter Seventeen: The Mysterious Register**
Those who study deeply yet lightly divulge its secrets bring calamity upon their primordial ancestors. The world’s people must not transmit it; the prohibition against careless leakage is absolute—how could this be the only concern? When treasured and kept secret, its merits equal those of a hundred million generations. What heaven cherishes is not passed down to the lower world. Only the most devoted present gold and treasures, pledging their hearts in covenant with heaven before transmission. Those who lightly divulge or treat it with negligence bring misfortune upon nine generations of ancestors, condemning them to long servitude in the ghostly palaces. Previously, those who recited it carelessly brought disaster upon their descendants, for their leakage and disdain implicated their forebears.

The **Mysterious Register Chapter** states: The nine palaces and twenty-four *qi* spirits all reside within the body. Attending the scripture are the Five Emperors, jade lads and jade maidens—twenty-four each—who guard the divine writ inscribed upon the middle joint of the middle finger, protecting the body of the scripture’s recipient. First, wear the talisman and incantation; second, circulate the *qi* channels. Swallowing the four characters of the *yingwei* divine writ yields immediate efficacy. The Five Emperors, jade lads, and jade maidens—twenty-four each, totaling two hundred and forty—accompany the Emperor in procession.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Three Primes**
The Dao declares: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past generations’ wandering souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to attain divine transcendence; the names of the worthy are inscribed in the heavens on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and ascending to life. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture for kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, to stabilize the nation’s destiny, preserve heaven’s enduring existence, ensure unbroken succession, and secure eternal rulership. Those who recite it on the eight seasonal nodes become Perfected of the Nine Palaces. Don the nine, tread the one; three on the left, seven on the right; two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet; five resides in the central palace, forming the solid core—this is the *huoluo* Dipper. On one’s life-destiny day, recite this scripture to purify the ethereal soul, perpetuate the myriad *qi*, avoid suffering and affliction, and radiate bodily light. The Three Realms attend in guard, the Five Emperors oversee the reception, and ten thousand spirits pay homage. Names are inscribed in heaven; when merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Great Clarity. The upper joint of the middle finger is the abode of the settled heart-spirit, the Central Capital of the Great Clarity.

According to the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Leap*: Above the Four Brahmā Heavens lie the Three Clarities. First, the Twelve Heavens of the Great Clarity, dwelling of the Nine Immortals. Next, the Twelve Heavens of the Great Clarity, governed by the Nine Perfected. Then, the Twelve Heavens of the Jade Clarity, dwelling of the Nine Sages. Together, thirty-six heavens, with the Jade Clarity as the highest.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Practice of the Dao**
Whenever reciting scriptures, performing the Dao, or enacting rituals, each must adhere to the prescribed visualization, transmitted orally and received in the heart, recited with the mouth and worshipped in the heart. All proceed from the *gen* direction to the point beneath the thumbnail where the hair is parted.

The Dao declares: On the day of practice, bathe in fragrant waters, observe purification rites, and enter the chamber. Face east, knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens; bow in the heart thirty-two times. Close the eyes and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of cyan, yellow, and white *qi*, inwardly and outwardly shrouded in mist. The Four Sagely Generals—Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—stand guard. Lions and white cranes array to left and right; sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its interior resplendent. A circular image arises from the nape, its light suffusing the ten directions.

The Three *Qi*: Mysterious *qi* is cyan, primordial *qi* is yellow, and initial *qi* is white. These Three *Qi* all arise from the One *Qi*. Now abiding within the Three *Qi* signifies the practitioner’s contemplation of the Three and preservation of the One—this is the mother of *qi*, the true and constant Dao.

When this is vividly clear, recite the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right attending envoys, the incense-bearing Golden Lad, the message-transmitting Jade Maiden, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two each. Entrust them with the incantation of the day to convey the following: Today is an auspicious occasion, a prolonged fast in the pure hall, the cultivation of this supreme scripture for the immeasurable deliverance of beings. This servant and [name], together reciting this scripture, seek the Dao of longevity."*

If reciting alone, face the direction of Wood Virtue, toward the sunrise, to draw in the cyan, yellow, and white *qi*, then recite: *"This servant and [name]..."*

The *Inner Chapters of the Great Cavern*’s *Principles of Cyclical Wind and Fusion* state: In the Palace of Fusang in the east lies the *ruo* tree. When the sun first rises, the *ruo* tree radiates light, and the cyan, yellow, and white *qi* billow atop its crown. The immortals in the palace recite scriptures and practice the Dao at this time to honor the Emperor’s virtue. Thus, when reciting this scripture, one should face the *jia-yi* direction—*jia-yi* being the east, hence the scripture’s injunction to recite facing east.

Recite the scripture to receive rebirth. May the prayers ascend directly to the presence of the Most High, the August and Venerable Primordial Sovereign of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Draw in the breath thirty-two times, then recite the scripture facing east—the direction of longevity, revered by all heavens.

The oral instructions for inscribing talismans in the *Great Cavern* prescribe facing east during the tenth month for Daoist practice.

Here ends the second scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Clarity*.
The third scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Clarity* begins.

The Master of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure, Keeper of the Southern Bureau’s Enforcement Canon, Right Adjunct of the Bureau of Initial Rectitude, Jin Yunzhong, compiled:

*The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Limitless Salvation of Humankind*
*Cavern Mystery Chapter the Twentieth*

The Primordial Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure’s original chapter, supreme and wondrous in its inception, saves humankind ten times over. Its hundred demonic rhythms conceal and reveal naturally. In all, twenty-four characters.

*Vermilion Script Chapter the Twenty-First*

All belong to the original chapter scripture, comprising sixty-four characters in total—true incantations of generative qi intermingled. "Chaotic Cavern" refers to the Cavern Heaven. The Vermilion Script embodies the peerless perfected, the Primordial Ancestor of kalpas, who transforms and gives rise to all heavens, illuminating the great Dao. The Three Radiant Ones form the root of heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body. The Five Scripts unfold and expand, universally planting the divine spirits. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no salvation; without script, there is no generation. [Point to] the middle joint of the middle finger.

*Great Brahma Chapter the Twenty-Second*

This is the Great Brahma, the essence of the Great Cavern. Heaven within heaven, the Terrace of Luxuriant Solitude and Verdant Vastness, the Upper Capital of Jade Mountain. The Terrace of Verdant Vastness is the Mysterious Terrace of Seven Treasures, nine-tiered, soaring into the heavens above the Great Void. Supreme and peerless, the Great Canopy of Jade Clarity. Vast and distant, the kalpa’s edge, as if vanished, as if present. The Three Flowers depart from the transient, the wondrous court of the Great Existence. Golden gates and jade chambers, the forest of purity and the limpid pool. The limpid pool is the rain pond beneath the Three Clarities’ throne.

*Brahma Qi Chapter the Twenty-Third*

Sixty-four characters, to cure the hundred diseases—swallow and ingest. The great practice of Brahma qi: above *gen*, those who recognize this align with the Great Cavern’s purport. Revolving through the ten directions, within it dwells the spirit of salvation who grants immortality; within it dwells the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen; within it dwells the Great Spirit Sima who saves the world; within it dwells the Elder Han Jun, who cherishes life. Today, the collation and recording take place as all heavens attend the imperial carriage. During the kalpa of Vermilion Brightness, within the Floating Black Country, on the day of unfolding the chart and collating the records. "Collate" means to compare the weight of sins and blessings; "record" means to inscribe the depth of merits and transgressions. These two phrases belong to the *Summoning the Perfected Chapter*.

*Summoning the Perfected Chapter the Twenty-Fourth*

The Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Great Sages of Longevity and Immeasurable Salvation:

To the East, above *Zhen*—
To the South, above *Li*—
To the West, above *Dui*—
To the North, above *Kan*—
To the Northeast, above *Gen*—
To the Southeast, above *Xun*—
To the Southwest, above *Kun*—
To the Northwest, above *Qian*—
Above, beneath the middle fingernail—used for supplication.
Below—the middle joint of the middle finger, employed by messengers for summoning.

These ten divine kings possess immense power. When petitioning the divine kings, dispatch flying heavenly messengers and recite the divine kings’ inner names.

The perfected flying heavenly divine kings of the ten directions, great spirits of longevity and immeasurable salvation, all ride upon flying clouds and cinnabar chariots, jade wheels with feathered canopies and green carriages, drawn by crimson phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons. Above *Chen*, they govern liver ailments—write and ingest.

They bear nine-colored standards and ten sacred banners; before them, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind them, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes chant in resonant chorus—this cures lung ailments and restores voice.

The Five Elders clear the path at the middle joint of the middle finger. Legions of immortals flank the imperial carriage, myriad chariots and riders arriving upon the floating void, their radiance turning back the celestial procession. Write and ingest at the four joints of the four fingers.

Supervising the perfected and delivering the living, above *Yin*—ingest to hasten birth.
The celestial chancellors—*cheng qi* and *xiang qi*.
At the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Han, the Recorder of Life, the great spirit who oversees birth, above *Yin*—ingest to hasten birth.

Holding registers and grasping talismans, they arrive before the Celestial Emperor. According to whom they are to deliver, they strictly examine the heavens, universally proclaiming to the three realms, the boundless divine lands, the Yellow Springs’ courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources.

The twelve months of the River Sources each deliver at the Eastern Well. Thereby absolve the ancestors and kin of so-and-so across kalpas, erase their names from the ledgers of transgressions, extinguish their evil roots, and forbid their detention or coercion into ghostly throngs.

At the middle joint of the middle finger, proclaim the white edict of the Dao to the three realms. Inscribe in ink on yellow paper, totaling forty-eight characters—employed in ritual practice.

The primordial talisman of command, timely ascension and promotion:
At the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, the guardians of form and soul.
Subduing demons and securing advancement, delivering ranks to the Southern Palace.
Dead souls undergo refinement, transformed into immortals.
Living beings receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas.
Revolving through kalpas, their years equal heaven’s.
Forever delivered from the three paths, five sufferings, and eight hardships,
they transcend the three realms, roaming freely in the Upper Clarity,
all as the talisman commands, transmitted by golden dragon couriers.

In total, sixty-four characters. Following this, inscribe the Nine Dark Realms Talisman—on blue paper in vermilion.

Year, month, day—[Name], the ritual officiant of such-and-such rank, proclaims at the auspicious hour.

*Precious Names Chapter the Twenty-Fifth*

In the heavens of the Upper Clarity, the Jade Perfected’s realm of formless boundlessness:
Those who practice the *fan xing*, the *fan xing*—
the Dao within the Dao, the heaven within heaven,
entering without gate, true emptiness without attainment.
Thus it is said: above the hundred and three realms, roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.
The rightful warrant for ascending to heaven.

The *Yuan Shi* Ascension to Heaven Precious Warrant, written in seal script—a *Da Dong* method.
Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, sixty-eight characters; on the reverse, write the true script.

this is called the Great Cavern.
The spontaneous numinous scriptures,

Nine harmonizes with ten, transforming into the Upper Clarity.
The unfathomable profundity—
its details cannot be expounded—
it bestows divine transcendence, universally delivering heaven and humanity.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Receiving the Register of Deliverance**
Today, joyously celebrating the receipt of deliverance,
passing through the barriers of all heavens.
At the hour of *chen*, beseech the eradication of the Three Evils,
severing the roots of earthly existence.
Soaring through the Five Portals, one’s name is inscribed in the Supreme Mystery.
The Demon Kings oversee and report,
unrestrained at the gates of heaven.
At the hour of *chen*, the ghosts who have attained the Dao receive from the Heavenly Worthies
a warrant and talisman,
notifying the Demon Kings of the Three Realms.
They are reported to the gates of heaven, unobstructed and unbound.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Guarding the True**
The Demon King of the Azure Heavens,
Ba Yuan Chou Bo.

At *mao*, the Vermilion Heaven Demon King bears the heavens and carries stones. At *wu*, the White Heaven Demon King reverses mountains with six eyes. At *you*, the Black Heaven Demon King oversees *chou* and *langfu*. At *zi*, the Yellow Heaven Demon King spans the heavens with boundless strength. The Five Thearch Demon Kings—at the middle joint of the middle finger—dispel evil and cure malarial illness when inscribed and swallowed. The origin of the myriad spirits.

They soar and drum in flight, commanding ghostly legions, brandishing banners and beating drums, roaming and observing the great void. Self-styled as resplendent, their merit equal across all heavens. Ascending to deliver humanity, they strictly govern the Northern Feng. By divine mandate, they universally sweep away misfortune. The Eight Awes spew poison, fierce steeds spread in four directions. At *wu*, the Eight Awes spew poison; at *you*, for all injuries from poisonous creatures, inscribe and affix. Heavenly soldiers lead the way; at the middle joint of the middle finger, the great marshal wields the banner. At *chen*, they repel evil spirits. Fire is hurled ten thousand leagues; at *yin*, the flowing bells of the Eight Directions. Should any dare to test them, they resist and obstruct the perfected transcendents—such is the Way’s supreme person who shields against all evils. The golden halberd executes in advance; beneath the middle fingernail, inscribe and affix to repel evil. The mighty Queen of Heaven metes out punishment.

At the roots of the four fingers, they slaughter and sever ghostly apparitions; wind and fire never cease. By the thousands, they sever heads; by the tens of thousands, they shear forms. Demons dare not trespass; ghosts dare not manifest as malevolent spirits. The Three Officials of the Northern Feng rigorously inspect ghostly encampments. No concealment is permitted; the golden steeds hasten the journey. Universally proclaimed without end, the myriad spirits all heed. The Five Thearchs of the Three Realms submit their words to the Supreme Clarity.

These thirty-two characters are the mandate received by the Divine Lords—employ them for great matters.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Jade Register**
The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Register, extending from Dragon Han to Yan Kang. Through countless eons, within the primordial chaos—above, no further colors; below, no further abyss. Wind and marsh pervade the void; the Vajra ascends the heavens. Above and below the heavens, no darkness nor obscurity, no form nor shadow, no limit nor end. The vast expanse of the Qi Jin, boundless and lightless. The Vermilion Clarity unfolds its chart; the movements and measures arise naturally.

At *kan*, this is the true scripture of the Numinous Treasure, totaling sixty-four characters. For incanting water, recite this spell ten times.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Flowing Transformation**
The Primordial Beginning pacifies and stabilizes—at *zi*, to treat fright and palpitations, inscribe and swallow. The Five Scrolls of Spread Brilliance. Vermilion script inscribed in ochre stone, the eight mighty dragon patterns. They preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring the heavens endure forever. The Brahmāic qi suffuses the cosmos; the myriad models unfold.

These twenty-two characters emulate heaven. They may be incanted to pacify dwellings or inscribed to serve as great generals.

**Chapter Thirty: Ascending the Mysterious**
The primordial net flows and evolves through the thirty-two heavens. Revolving without color, cycling through the ten directions. The Dipper wheels past the Winnowing Basket, revolving through the Five Constants—the Five Stars. Thirty-five divisions, the total qi of the Upper Origin. The Eight Sceneries merge in darkness; qi enters the profound mystery.

The Western Tortoise Mountain—also called Dragon Mountain—is the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the deep abode of the Yellow Qi. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, spanning millions of leagues, it borders the Jade Clarity. To the southeast, it connects with the rosy clouds of Tongyang; above, it supports the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Clear Palace. To the northwest lies the Wilds of the Cold Cavern, ascending to the courtyard of the Golden Watchtower of the Divine Immortals. To the south, it extends to the land of Tai Dan and Fu Li, its qi harmonizing with the radiance of Dongyang. To the north, it aligns with the Gouchen, intersecting the canopy of the Flowery Canopy, its qi treading the center of Guangling, directly surging toward the Jade Capital.

The Eight Reaches intersect with the windy mountains and ridges, leveling the heavens for thirty thousand leagues. Molten gold forms its walls; jade is knotted into its gates. Golden terraces and jade towers, twelve divine palaces, above which flow natural essences. The Purple Watchtower and Golden Flower Palace, chambers of jasper and jade, connect to the nine apertures’ caverns. From them arise clouds of purple qi, interwoven with phoenix patterns. Nine-colored falling arrays; cliffs where purple cassia grows. Verdant ridges and jasper forests, branches of coral, roots of jade. The towering trees bear fruit; the red youths and white rings. The Three Flowers radiate blossoms in the vermilion light; reversed fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. The Eight Qi fan the whirlwinds into ceaseless drums; the jade pipes sing emptily to form sound. Dragons howl in cloud towers; phoenixes cry on sheer peaks. Venomous beasts by the thousands; serpents a thousand fathoms long. Divine palaces, majestic and grand; transcendent immortals, teeming and abundant. Towering primordial halls, where all things exude essence. This is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Beginning, truly the spiritual root of the Heavenly Origin.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Pledge of the Mysterious**
Within the mysterious, the Supreme Thearch, the exalted perfected, drift upon the great rosy clouds, whistling and chanting the cavernous chapters. The golden perfected glow brightly; their flowing echoes gather in the cloud camps. The jade tones gather qi; the numinous winds assemble the mists. The purple void flourishes in elegance, assisting the myriad immortals.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Attaining Perfection**
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally attaining perfection. For all harmonizing and uniting, inscribe and swallow at the middle joint of the second finger. Within the perfected dwells the spirit, the Great Lord of Longevity. The Lordless Duke, the Venerable White Prime. The Great One, Controller of Destiny, Peach and Health united in extension. Grasping talismans and holding registers, they protect life and root destiny. Ascending to roam the Supreme Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers. Within the Eight Darknesses, amid the minutest details. Below, they stabilize the human body, the Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace. Centrally, they govern the Five Qi. They blend and unite the hundred spirits. Ten transformations transcend the numinous; the myriad qi ascend as immortals.

For each chapter, recite the breath-incantation ten times, exhaling upon the middle joint of the second finger.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Drawing Forth the Flowery**
The immortal Dao values life, universally delivering humanity without limit.

The Eight Gates open above. The Wheel of Flying Heaven—sin and blessing, prohibitions and precepts! Past-life karmic conditions. Universally received and delivered, the dead soul revives in the living body. The body attains rebirth. Above, it is heard by all heavens. Above all heavens, each has its Gate of Life. Within lies the Hollow Cavern’s *Yao Song* chapter. The *Ling Pian* of Demon Kings, its verses matching the lofty perfected.

**First: The Desire Realm’s Flying Void Melody**
The human path is faint and distant; the immortal Dao, vast and boundless.
The ghostly path falls away.
When one stands at the Gate of Human Life:
The immortal Dao values life; the ghostly path prizes death.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious; the ghostly path is ever inauspicious.
The exalted, pure, and numinous soar.
A mournful song rings through the Great Void:
Only wishing the immortal Dao to succeed, not desiring the human path to wither.
The Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs and Crooked Mansion,
Within swarm ten thousand ghosts,
All seeking to obstruct human destiny,
To sever the Gate of Human Life.
Ah! Sing the *Dong Zhang*!
Thereby restrain the Northern Feng of Luo,
Bind and dispatch demonic essences,
Sever the blades of the Six Ghosts.
The qi of all heavens billows boundlessly;
My Dao daily flourishes.

**Second: The Form Realm’s Demon King Chapter**
Lofty and expansive, luminous qi suffuses the four fasts.
The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions.
Layered talismans compose the great divine array, resounding in the dwelling.
Immeasurable great spirits—
All arise from my body.
I possess the *Dong Zhang*; ten thousand recitations make one an immortal.
The immortal Dao values deliverance; the ghostly path clings close.
Heaven and earth stretch boundless; foul qi swirls thickly.
The Three Realms’ joy—
Pass beyond it, and abide forever.
When the body crosses my realm, the form enters spontaneity.
At this moment, joy—
Fleeting, by my grace.
The Dragon Han era surges boundlessly—
How can one distinguish the true?
My realm is hard to cross,
Thus I compose the *Dong Wen*,
Transforming and flying through the void,
To test your body.
Success or failure, slackening or retreat—
How many achieve deliverance?
Laughing at those who fail to cross,
I sing this melody.

**Third: The Formless Realm’s Demon King Song**
Above the Three Realms,
The vast and distant Great Luo.
Above, no root of form,
Cloud-layers towering.
Only the Primordial Beginning’s household of vast kalpas
Governs and regulates my realm,
Overseen by the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm—
Their bodies enter the Jade Void.
I, the Upper King, rectify and govern the host of demons.
Ten thousand times through the void,
Foul qi blooms like flowers.
Those who preserve the true are few; those who stray and delude, many.
The immortal Dao is hard to secure; the ghostly path easily turns perverse.
The human path lies in the heart—
Truly, it does not depend on others.
The immortal Dao values substance; the human path values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao,
How can you pass the Three Realms?
Should you wish to revolve through the Five Paths,
What can I do for you?

Above the Three Realms,
Within the flying void,
The Demon Kings’ songs,
Their melodies matching the *Dong Zhang*.
Recite them a hundred times—
Your name is recorded in the Southern Palace.
Recite them a thousand times—
The Demon Kings protect and welcome you.
Ten thousand recitations, and the Dao is complete:
You ascend and fly through the Great Void,
Crossing the Three Realms,
Attaining the rank of Immortal Elder.
Those who hear the numinous melody—
The Demon Kings respect their forms,
Commanding earth spirits to attend,
Escorting and welcoming.
Drawn forth from the Earth’s Gate, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
Seven generations of ancestors ascend,
Forever departing the ghostly bureaus.
The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound,
Undergoes refinement, and is reborn.

The above thirty-two characters are written in black on yellow paper and commanded to the local earth spirits and deities.
This is called the Immeasurable, universally delivering without end.

There are secret celestial texts,
Revered by all heavens.
To leak or slight them is to fall into hell,
Bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

**Heavenly Treasure Chapter Thirty-Four**
The Dao states: These two chapters are the hidden melodies of the Heavenly Thearchs and the numinous Demon Kings. All are the words of the Great Brahma, not common speech of the mundane world. Their words lack ornate beauty; their tunes, no florid embellishment. Thus they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens above, they are secreted in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital. According to the Mysterious Regulations, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If a perfected person pledges gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the old protocols and swearing oaths to the Ten Heavens, only then are they entrusted.

**Universal Protection Chapter Thirty-Five**
The Dao states: As for the revolutions of heaven and earth, there is also a time of closure and end.

The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine persons undergo cycles of flourishing and decline. Those of shallow learning likewise suffer illness and harm. Whenever such calamities afflict those of shared qi, all should unite in mind to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods of the day, and recite the scriptures ten times through. Virtue and power will descend at once, dissolving all inauspicious omens. These boundless texts universally deliver limitless beings.

**Yin Refinement Chapter Thirty-Six**
The Dao states: Those of shallow learning in the Way, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled, may face the destined end of their allotted span. Their bodies pass through the Great Yin, and at the moment of transition, fellow students and perfected persons burn incense and recite the scriptures ten times on their behalf. By thus delivering the corpse in accordance with the method, the hun-soul ascends directly to the Southern Palace. According to the merit of their practice, they are reborn after a calculated number of days, escaping the wheel of rebirth and attaining immortality.

**Preservation and Pacification Chapter Thirty-Seven**
The Dao states: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the stellar lodges fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When pestilential toxins spread and the multitudes suffer death and injury, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When teachers and companions pass from this life, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is most weighty: above, it dissolves heavenly calamities and preserves the Thearch; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon it, its blessings beyond measure. Thus it is called boundless, universally delivering gods and humans.

**Profound Words Chapter Thirty-Eight**
The Dao states: Whoever possesses these scriptures and performs these meritorious deeds for the Thearchs of heaven and earth and the multitudes—on days of calamity, if they resolve in their hearts to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures ten times—all the heavens record their names, and the myriad spirits attend and protect them. Those of exceptional attainment among them may become ministers of the Golden Gates of the Sagely Thearchs. The heavens record their merits and transgressions with perfect precision. The Demon Kings of heaven also safeguard and recommend those who attain the Way, for these are the luminously clear profound words.

**Great Cavern Chapter Thirty-Nine**
Among the heavens, the boundless sounds of the Great Brahma’s hidden speech, as compiled by the Dao Lord from the Central Section of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning:

Dǎnlóu Ācāng, Wúxiǎng Guānyīn.
Xūyán Míngshǒu, Fǎlǎn Pútán.

**Resonance and Response Chapter Forty**
The Dao states: These boundless sounds of the Great Brahma’s hidden speech among the heavens were originally written in characters a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected August Person of old transcribed these words to establish the correct pronunciation. Those who know these sounds and can perform purification rites while reciting them will have the Heavenly Thearchs dispatch Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings to descend and observe their persons, record their diligent practice, and memorialize the heavens. The myriad spirits will pay homage, the earth spirits will attend at their gates, and the great Demon Kings will safeguard and recommend them for ascent to immortality. Once their practice is complete, they may wander the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gates. These sounds repel all harm, dissolve all calamities, deliver all beings, and accomplish all ends—they are the spontaneous sounds of the Heavenly Perfected. Thus, when recited, Flying Heavenly Beings descend to observe, the Supreme Thearch chants from afar, the myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend in their chariots, the demonic hordes bow their heads, and ghostly spirits perish of themselves. The jade-like tones resound, and when the four characters *yǒu shàng* are written and swallowed, they cure deafness. The ten directions become solemn and clear, rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, the myriad spirits tremble and submit, and the host of immortals is summoned. Heaven is free of defilement, earth is free of demonic dust, dark wisdom becomes profoundly clear, and the great measure is most mysterious. When written on *hài*, they open the heart. Truly, the *Lingbao* scriptures belong to the *Dongxuan* section, and the twelve divisions are all encompassed within the single scroll of the *Central Scripture for Delivering Humanity*. Their principles are profoundly obscure, and thus only the perfected sages who have already attained the Way and the true persons can fully grasp their chapters. Yet teachings manifest in accordance with the times, and methods circulate in response to the era. Though scholars may not yet be able to plumb their hidden depths, the scriptures have been translated into the written characters of this world—unlike the unintelligible barbarian speech of the Buddhists—and by following their correct principles and examining them carefully, one may yet fathom their general purport. Thus, from beginning to middle, the scriptural method is divided into forty chapters. Each chapter has its own meaning, and each meaning has its own purpose—this is the origin of the *Lingbao* teachings. Those who practice and uphold them, advancing to the immortal ranks of the *Dongxuan* and fulfilling the offices of the *Lingbao* methods, can they not first devote their hearts to this? Truly, one should thoroughly understand the original intent behind the division into chapters, and only then can the seven warp and eight weft scriptures be comprehended.

Scholars who delve deeply and investigate thoroughly shall naturally attain boundless perfection. The writings of Mount Tiantai have also been incorporated into the methods, with minor additions and alterations, and their title changed to *Great Scripture Exegeses*. Now, "exegesis" denotes the meaning of commentary. Since the *Scripture of Salvation* received annotations from Yan Dong during the Qi dynasty and later from Xu Youqi and others during the Tang, successive commentaries have proliferated, yet none may be called the *Method* itself. The forty chapters serve as the foundation of the method. Yet Mount Tiantai regards them as *Great Scripture Exegeses*—this is why they must be truthfully categorized and included, not to deliberately create distinctions.

**The Seven Scriptures and Eight Wefts**

In the Great Primordial Stability, the divine radiance shines resplendent for seven days and seven nights. Penetrating the hundred spirits, it surveys the ten directions. Jade tablets reveal inner illumination. Refining the ancestral qi, one gives birth to the sacred embryo of the Dharma-body. The oral instructions for descending the five phases’ upright qi in inner refinement remain untransmitted. The millet-grain pearl, through accumulated divine transformations, forms the elixir. The oral instructions for descending the central principle to harmonize the five qi and unite the hundred spirits remain untransmitted. The above are called the *Seven Scriptures*.

The flowing essence and jade radiance of the yin-yang elixir remain untransmitted. Internally, it encompasses the nine cauldrons; externally, it aligns with the nine-colored *Dongyang Fu* of the Great Opening Diagram. The oral instructions for the flowing Brahman qi merging with the Great Yang and pervading the ten directions remain untransmitted. The recitation practices of the Three Palaces. Illuminating the subtle and obscure. The five grades of yin merits. Aiding life through yang virtues. Ascending and delivering across the boundless. The above are called the *Eight Wefts*.

Yunzhong humbly observes that the Dao of Numinous Treasure and the ranks of Dongxuan originated at the dawn of primordial chaos and unfolded before the kalpas of eons. When their radiance responded to the times and the teachings were established through scriptures, none departed from the *Seven Scriptures and Eight Wefts*. However, among their regulations and methods, some were recorded and included in compilations, while others remain untransmitted among humans. These have been itemized in their respective sections, and I dare not force explanations where none exist.

In the Numinous Treasure tradition of Mount Tiantai, these are called the *Recitation Wefts*. The first is *Taiyi Containing Flowers*, where jade dew welcomes the pearl. By visualizing and reciting it, one ascends to immortality without awaiting myriad practices—this is the *Weft of the Mysterious Transformation of the Pearl*. The second is *The Controller of Destiny Transforming Life*, descending in form and ascending again. Reciting it ten thousand times, one rides clouds and mounts dragons to ascend the great void in broad daylight—this is the *Weft of the Lion’s Mighty Spirit*. The third is *The Imperial Palace Dividing the Body*. With the three origins’ merits complete and the ten thousand perfections fulfilled, the entire body ascends in ascent—this is the *Weft of the Wondrous Vehicle of the Upper Palace*. The fourth is *The Elixir’s Inner Seat*, where the central fire achieves perfection. After six thousand merits accumulated, the virtue-moon unites with the nine perfected—this is the *Weft of Verification and Perfection in the Central Sanctuary*. The fifth is *The Elixir Valley Concealing the Aged*. With spirit and qi both preserved, the three thousand descend in practice. Registering in the Jade Capital—this is the *Weft of the Lower Origin’s Elementary Study*. The sixth is *The Three Qi Generating the Three*, uniting above with the Three Heavens. Creating a single body for the initiate. Dividing forms across the ten heavens. The form equaling the Heavenly Master. The demeanor natural, seated upon a lion, dwelling within the *Baozhu of the Empty Mystery’s Sunlight*. The five patterns of the primordial origin, circling ten times. Responding to and transforming the mysterious—this is the *Weft of Establishing the Divine Penetrations*. The seventh is *Inner and Outer Service*: the thirty-two sounds. The heart visualizes the Jade Lord. The Mud-Pill Palace of the Niwan, reciting the jade chapters, bowing to the Primordial Lord. After ten thousand recitations, nothing remains unaccomplished—this is the *Weft of the Jade Sounds of the Ten Thousand Spirits*. The eighth is *The Three Realms and Seven Origins*. Reciting a hundred thousand ten thousand times, the three realms may be delivered. The immortal elder’s cloud chariot—this is the *Weft of Expanding the Numinous across the Three Realms*. These are the *Wefts of Humans*.

Since the emergence of the Great Methods of Numinous Treasure, numerous compilations by various schools have appeared. Though they differ in gains and losses, none depart from the *Seven Scriptures and Eight Wefts* as their foundational source. Through accumulating merits, ascending to immortality, and delivering the world, the divine mechanisms and wondrous subtleties of the Dao lie concealed within. Yet the Tiantai tradition only divides the eight wefts by refinement and visualization, differing slightly from common transmissions. In the *Regulations of the Scriptures and Wefts* section, it briefly lists the names of the seven scriptures but does not record their contents. Those who have not seen the complete text must infer their meaning, thus establishing this section for recitation practices. While this does not obstruct principle, once the ancient methods are lost—where the names of the seven scriptures and eight wefts are all matters within the scriptures—it is like abandoning the net’s headrope, leaving scholars unaware of the path to take their first steps. How then can they aspire to ascend the hall and enter the chamber? Is it not difficult?

The *Chapter on the Flowing Evolution of the Primordial Net*

The Primordial Net is the path of primordial qi, the root of the Nine Heavens, located at the northwest corner, where it borders the Jade Clarity. To the southeast, it connects with the radiance of the Yang Passage, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Clear Palace. To the north, it extends into the wilds of the Cold Cavern, reaching upward to the Court of Divine Immortals of the Golden Portals. At the southern extreme, it aligns with the land of Great Elixir and Floating Blackness, its qi harmonizing with the light of the Cavernous Yang. To the north, it rectifies the Celestial Turtle’s alignment with the Canopy of Flowers, its qi traversing the Central Continent to the direct thoroughfare of Jade Capital. The eight winds converge at Tortoise Mountain in the west, the root of Heaven. For details, see the *Chapter on Exegesis and Application*.

To truly examine the Primordial Net is to grasp the root and pivot of Heaven, the warp and weft of qi. Before the source of the Dao divided, the Primordial Net was already established—this is the great structure of Heaven and Earth, the numinous axis of wondrous qi. It weaves through the Thirty-Two Heavens and penetrates the divisions of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. That which takes form above is called the Dao; that which flows below is termed the teachings. Practiced internally, it aligns with the body; applied externally, it revolves with method. This is the natural pattern of Heaven and Earth, modeled on the function and form of humanity.

Yet the illusory body of man, formed from filth and impurity, shaped in the womb—every hair and fiber—is but a thing of dust and decay. Only our singular spirit endures with Heaven and Earth from beginning to end, for both share the ancestral qi. Thus, the head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth; the eyes resemble the sun and moon, the body mirrors the expanse of the cosmos. The circulation of qi and breath corresponds precisely to the celestial measures. If one cultivates this to align with that, one may endure with Heaven, transcending impermanence.

Those who remain ignorant fail to awaken to its truth or examine its application, mistakenly claiming that the body contains Heaven and Earth and requires no external seeking. This is incorrect. The method of internal refinement, though vast as the three thousand six hundred side constellations, hinges on the true formula of the Golden Elixir. In the beginning, one pursues the two qi along the Yellow Path, uniting the three natures in the Primordial Palace. Upon completion, the yin soul vanishes without trace, and the yang spirit merges with the Dao. According to the weight of one’s merit and the rank of one’s endowment, one is appointed to the offices of the Immortal Bureaus or receives the scriptures of the Cavernous Realms. Yet one cannot claim that the body alone contains Heaven and Earth while nothing exists beyond, or that within there is form and spirit while nothing exists without. To grasp a single fragment of technique and assert that there is an inner but no outer—how grievously mistaken!

Some in recent times have recognized the error of this view, yet regretfully, without encountering a master’s guidance, they grope in vain for the essentials. Failing to fully embrace the internal, nor wholly devote themselves to the external, they fabricate a doctrine of "neither inner nor outer," straying even further from the truth.

Behold the azure expanse above—this is Heaven, adorned with the sun, moon, and stars as its patterns. The boundless and profound below—this is Earth, with its mountains, rivers, and peaks as its principles. The human body, with its four limbs and five constituents, is but one thing among all things between Heaven and Earth, distinguished only by its nature. To walk beneath Heaven and tread upon Earth, yet claim there is no Heaven or Earth beyond—how can this be?

Here, I have expounded the structure of the Primordial Net as the warp of Heaven, the constant. Next, I describe how the human body models itself upon Heaven and Earth, aligning with yin and yang in its form. Heaven endures through its ceaseless vigor; if one unites with the Dao and clarifies the spirit, one too may endure. This is not to say the body is Heaven unto itself, nor to advocate for "neither inner nor outer"—lest we mislead future generations. Thus, I must clarify this without ambiguity.

The Primordial Net is the essential path for the ascent of the spirit, the sublime vista of the Celestial Stairway. Once the source of the Dao divides, the divine heavens soar above the hollow peaks—beyond words, beyond the reach of sight or hearing. Those who awaken to its truth cultivate truth through truth, and external truth naturally responds. Those who recognize its wonder attain wonder through wonder, and external wonder naturally arrives. By extending the image of the divine heavens, the position of the Primordial Net—whether distant or near—becomes evident.

Within man, primordial qi opens the pathways of bones, vessels, and cavities, ascending to the crown, just as the Primordial Net’s path does in Heaven. The hun and po souls within the body are like qi within Heaven. To know their ingress and egress is to attain longevity and transcendence; to remain ignorant is to be a fool. One who has not mastered the arts and techniques, nor understood the ranks of officialdom, yet seeks an audience with the sovereign—how can this be?

When primordial qi gathers and fuses, it nourishes the hun and po, giving rise to true essence. True essence originates in the right kidney, the Gate of Life, located at the hollow of the spine. Below it lies the Great Bone, whose marrow permeates the body’s bones. This cavity is called the Tortoise Tail, and its ruler is the Queen Mother, who faces south to govern. From the Emperor’s perspective, it is called Tortoise Mountain of the West—a metaphor in Daoist teachings. It is also named the Golden Portals, for its residence in the west. To the right is the Golden Portals; to the left, the Jade Chamber, for jade resides in mountains and wood flourishes in moisture, dwelling in the east. It is also the source of Jade Water, the transformation of yang essence. Where essence congeals is called the Pure Abyss—this is where the qi of the Primordial Net originates.

The sacred diagrams are established here, the high altars rise from this point, and the Terrace of Fragrant Mist is founded upon it. At the center of the terrace, the honored one aligns directly with the heart—this is the Spiritual Terrace. The realm of Supreme Clarity lies above the Great Clarity, corresponding to the region below the heart. Beneath the heart’s suspension lies the liver. Two parts below the liver, the Northern Dipper’s seven stars reside. Their qi reaches the heart, their source ascending to the area beneath the tongue, called the Bubbling Spring. Its qi descends to the qi of the right kidney. Those who leak this qi fail to restrain the Bubbling Spring’s flow, a condition called "crossing blades." Crossing blades refers to the ground illuminated by the Dipper’s handle star, where its nature is stern and deadly, and its spirit belongs to the Realm of Desire.

Those who comprehend this Dao press the tongue against the upper palate, directly guiding the qi to ascend along the spine, connecting the spine to the head. Above the head lies the vital path to the Jade Capital—what is called the Western Tortoise Mountain, which borders the Jade Capital. Nowadays, people misunderstand, believing the Western Tortoise Mountain resides in the brain. Yet the Western Tortoise is separated from the qi of Jade Clarity by forty million layers of dwelling, while the central qi reaches directly into the heavens, where Mars, being the lowest, is the first to receive its qi. The heart belongs to fire, and when it ascends, resonance occurs. The sun and moon align with Mars, thus one roams between sun and moon.

Within the body, this corresponds to the two breasts aligning with the heart—the breasts being the root-source of the eyes. A person’s two breasts store essence to nourish the eyes. Thus, when one’s qi declines with age and the eyes grow dim, the breasts yield no milk, and the kidneys hold no essence. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper lie in the northeast of the heavens, serving as the celestial gate’s bolt—this is the position of Gen. In humans, this corresponds to the right shoulder’s Jianjing point. The body’s qi and vessels begin on the right. The celestial Dao’s movement begins in the northwest, proceeding westward to the Ox Mansion, where celestial affairs conclude. Yet nothing has yet arisen, so creation begins here—speaking of re-entering Mars. Though human qi completes one cycle, its ebb and flow depends on this, re-entering the heart. The progression through fire, wood, water, and metal follows the celestial degrees.

The heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs correspond to the qi transport points—these are the acupoints along the spine. Observing the spinal points reveals their arrangement above and below, left and right. Seeking their subtlety and tracing the throat’s circular path, one connects to the fontanel, where the mystery of mysteries resides, ineffable and beyond naming.

The realm of formlessness lies beneath the heart, within the hollow void, to the left of the Dipper’s bowl. From the Dipper’s mouth, press the tongue against the upper palate—this is called the Celestial Bridge—ascending through the Upper Clarity to reach the Jade Clarity. Thus, the vision of Jade Clarity resides in the head; the vision of Upper Clarity, in the Crimson Palace; and the vision of Great Clarity, in the Cinnabar Field. The heart is the Spirit Terrace, and so the discourse on the Spirit Terrace becomes evident.

In this practice, one guards—guarding resides in the heart. In this practice, one pays homage—homage resides in the head. These are the Three Flowers’ separation into the vast courtyard of Great Existence. Thus, the Heaven within Heaven gathers the meeting of the White Prime and the Origin in the heart, naturally attaining perfection in the head.

Cultivating the Lingbao Dao within the body culminates here, where affairs conclude, and no sound can contain it. The *Yunzhong*’s precise discourse on the primordial net’s unfolding in heaven was recounted earlier. Its embodiment in the human form is recorded here. Scholars must deeply understand why this body is so noble: it can become a true immortal, align with heaven and earth, refine form and spirit, and unite with the Dao’s mysteries.

Daoist teachings employ phenomena as metaphors and model themselves after heaven and earth to establish names. Following the nurtured body, they establish methods of action, progressing from action to non-action, from form to formlessness. Only then do they attain longevity equal to heaven and earth, merging with the Dao in truth. The practice begins within the body but does not end there.

**Primordial Net’s Unfolding Diagram**
*Yunzhong* notes: According to the *Zhen’gao*, the five planets’ diagrams are arranged facing south. Venus is positioned in the west, Jupiter in the east—this is the method of their application. The five planets’ concealments and traversals are irregular, unlike the Northern Dipper’s fixed configuration. Thus, their positions are uniformly assigned to the five directions, not following the stars’ actual locations.

*Yunzhong* examines astronomy: the five planets have no fixed positions. They may align like a string of pearls or cluster in the Well Mansion, halting, concealing, reversing, or progressing unevenly. Following the diagram in practice aligns with the five phases’ correspondences to determine directions—this is also the *Zhen’gao*’s approach. One must recognize that this diagram is for ritual use.

Like the twenty-eight constellations, which channel the qi of the thirty-two heavens, their affiliations differ. Here, the thirty-two heavens are arranged in a ring around the four directions, and the twenty-eight constellations follow astronomical positions to align the cardinal points, facilitating homage—this is not a matter of one constellation corresponding to one heaven’s qi. If one were to draw a heaven’s qi down to a specific constellation, the directions would become disordered, making application difficult.

When paying homage to the thirty-two heavens, begin with the Supreme August Yellow Brilliance Heaven and conclude with the Level Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven. Then, turn to the twenty-eight constellations, taking twelve steps per mansion, starting with the Winnowing Basket and ending with the Dipper. At the Dipper, rotate the body, return to the Winnowing Basket, and gaze back toward the Dipper’s handle to proceed. Homage to the five planets follows the same method, as detailed in the *Pure Brightness Scripture and Rituals*.

Ascend to the divine realm, entering the Northern Dipper’s midst. The Three Terraces’ six stars cap the crown as one traverses a Dipper’s seat. After six steps, align with the Three Terraces to exit. Circle left forty-nine steps, encountering Mars. Then proceed east eleven steps to the Great Yang, paying homage to the Filial Dao Immortal King. Turn right sixty-four steps, entering the west to reach the Great Yin, paying homage to the Filial Dao Luminous King. Spiral left to exit, then alternate left and right. After seven circuits like a ring, this is the Formless Realm. Stabilize visualization to perceive the Formless Realm’s immortals and perfected beings coming and going.

Thereafter, traverse the ten directions to pay homage to the thirty-two emperors and twenty-eight constellations. At each mansion, take twelve steps of the *ding* asterism, totaling three hundred thirty-six steps to return to the Dipper. Then borrow the Winnowing Basket’s asterism to proceed in a straight ring, gazing toward the Northern Dipper’s great handle and the Wind-Exchanging Mountain. Turn right, facing south forty-nine steps, re-entering Mars. Pass through the Great Yin, thirty-six steps to pay homage to Mercury. From Mercury, proceed east to the Great Yang’s side. Turn right sixty-four steps, facing east to pay homage to Jupiter. Return and proceed, borrowing Mercury’s asterism to exit beside the Great Yin. Eighty-one steps, facing west to pay homage to Venus. Proceed directly to the Dipper’s mouth, thirty-five steps to enter its center, paying homage to Saturn. Reverse course, re-enter the lodges of Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter, then gaze north toward the Jade Capital’s Golden Towers. Advance eight steps, bow deeply, and kneel.

State your rank and surname: "Your servant [Name], by fortunate alignment with this constellation’s blessings and encountering the true wind, enters stillness to concentrate spirit and reverently approaches the celestial gates. The body beyond the body ventures to the Jade Capital." Your servant, overwhelmed by gazing upon the heavens and beholding the sagely, prostrates in awe and trepidation. Bow twice.

Continue: "Your servant’s mortal bones are stubborn, and principle scarcely allows transcendence. By fortunate receipt of a teacher’s transmission, I dare to soar in spirit, undeterred by punishment, and humbly present my sincerity. I enter the ritual’s intent." Your servant, awaiting grace and command, respectfully speaks, bows twice, retreats to the original path, and allows the spirit to re-enter the fontanel.

**Incantation:**
*She chan she chan, tuo qiao li chen.*
*Wu jin chao zhen, shang ye qing yun.*
*Yu shi shen ren, bi zhai feng xing.*
*Ju bu yi qu, mi jue ling ling.*
*Hasten as the law commands!*

The *Right Primordial Net’s Flowing Evolution Diagram* is the path of the myriad heavens’ pure practices. It begins with the flight of spirit to gather the Dipper and concludes with the audience before the Emperor to present the primordial. If one can cultivate this with focused contemplation and disciplined practice, entering and exiting with mastery, ascending and responding without confusion, one may then submit memorials, command spirits and deities, and ultimately achieve the arts of shedding the mortal husk to ascend as a perfected being, merging with the primordial qi of the Brahma-realm. The methods of refining form and the techniques of presenting the primordial originate here.

On the Three Primordials, Eight Nodal Days, and the cyclical days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, one enters the oratory, burns incense, sits facing north in equanimity, closes the eyes to still the mind, concentrates the spirit, and stabilizes intention. The breath flows gently, the spirit-wind does not stir. One raises the body to emerge from the crown, like a cicada shedding its husk, and ascends into the void of the mysterious. Proceeding according to the method, from the subtle to the manifest, from visualization to realization—this depends on the practitioner.

Yunzhong respectfully observes: This passage is the essential application within the method, the root source of memorials and petitions. Like the completion of the golden elixir or the generation of a body beyond the body, its benefits are profound. In recent times, the Lingbao methods of Mount Tiantai have often taught practitioners to operate solely within the body, failing to extend upward to the Muddy Pellet, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the thousand perfected and myriad images encircling the Muddy Pellet. The *Primordial Net’s Flying Steps* instead gathers the spirit into the brain, resembling the method of assembling the body’s spirits to present the primordial, akin to the technique of replenishing the brain and returning essence. Even the submission of memorials and the flight of spirit to make petitions are regarded as its untransmitted wonders. Yet some, observing similar functions in lesser methods, cling to these as secret techniques. Failing to grasp the essentials of Lingbao, they hastily adopt this practice. Fearing criticism from the discerning, their followers imagine their own spiritual marvels and refrain from speaking of them. How could they know that the *Primordial Net’s Flowing Evolution* traverses the Thirty-Two Heavens, passing through the divisions of the Twenty-Eight Constellations—this is the root pivot of the heavens? The human body mirrors this: one stabilizes the hundred spirits within the body and focuses the mind’s single thought, directing sincerity toward the upper realms to meet the Dao and present the primordial. This is not merely a matter of concentrating effort within the Muddy Pellet. By preserving the inner truth, the outer truth naturally responds; by comprehending the body’s transcendence, the heavens’ transcendence may be glimpsed. If the visualization is pure and unwavering, over time the spirit is refined and the substance transformed—there is no room for doubt. Yet if the spirit is returned to the body and attention fixed within the brain, this is mistaken. Scholars should deeply investigate this mechanism, approach it with an open mind, and avoid rigid attachment, so as to thoroughly grasp the principles of the true and orthodox Dao and together ascend to the realm of purity and tranquility.

The *Ranks of the Mysterious Heavens’ Sovereigns* and the *High Perfected and Supreme Sages* collectively record the mysteries of the heavens. The subtly existent and subtly nonexistent cannot be fathomed. When scriptures emerge, their mechanisms gradually become apparent. The *Three Caverns’ Orthodox Regulations* are profound in principle. Since the Great Tang dynasty, scriptures and decrees have been scattered and lost, patched together over time, mingling the true and false. Only those of discernment can distinguish their sources and comprehend their principles, thereby glimpsing even a fraction of their profundity.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning is the source of the myriad transformations, the mysterious qi of the Dao. Beyond analogy or conjecture, it disperses to become qi and coalesces to form shape. Within it dwells spirit, forcibly named the Celestial Worthy, who resides in the Sacred Realm of Jade Purity. The Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure is the primordial qi of the Dao. In terms of teaching, the Primordial Beginning corresponds to the Cavern of Perfection, while this corresponds to the Cavern of Mystery, residing in the True Realm of Highest Purity. The Celestial Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue is the originating qi of the Dao. In terms of teaching, from the Primordial Beginning to this point corresponds to the Cavern of Divinity, residing in the Immortal Realm of Great Purity.

The August Emperor of the Vast Heaven arises from the transformation of the Three Qi, transcending the limits of heaven and earth. He generates the myriad things yet does not bear them. When the Three Powers were first established, the qi was pure and lofty, accumulating yang to form heaven. As the source of the ten thousand transformations, how could it lack a sovereign? Thus, in terms of form and image, it is called Heaven; in terms of governance, it is called Emperor. He administers below the mysterious qi and is revered above the Three Realms, serving as the Lord of Heaven.

The Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen is the imperial throne within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. According to the *Treatise on Astronomy*: The Southern Culmen sinks thirty-six degrees into the earth, while the Northern Culmen rises thirty-six degrees above it. The celestial form is inclined, half emerging above the earth and half returning within it. The myriad stars and qi all revolve leftward, except for the Northern and Southern Culmina, which serve as the pivot and remain unmoving, enabling the heavens to rotate. Mortals observe it in the north and call it the Northern Culmen, yet it truly resides at the center of the heavens, serving as the ancestral sovereign of the myriad stars, the secondary lord of the Three Realms, subordinate only to the Vast Heaven. It corresponds above to the primordial qi and is thus called the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of Purple Tenuity.

In the Lingbao methods of Mount Tiantai, however, it is claimed that the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of Purple Tenuity is the emperor of the myriad spirits and baleful forces of the Three Realms, deceiving the mortal world and profaning the supreme mystery. This is deeply alarming and should be strictly avoided by scholars.

The Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign is located to the left of the Northern Culmen’s imperial throne. Four stars form a slightly curved, linked shape resembling a hook, called the Curved Array. The large star directly below it, positioned at its center, is the Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign. He governs the myriad stars, his rank equal to the Northern Culmen, yet serving as the pivot, the Heavenly Sovereign also revolves with the heavens. Corresponding below to the originating qi and above to the Three Qi, within the Three Realms and above the myriad heavens, none surpass the supremacy of these Three Emperors.

Yunzhong privately reflects: Who does not know that the Three Purities and Three Realms’ Celestial Worthies are the Three Qi of the mysterious, primordial, and originating? Yet when qi coalesces, it forms shape; when it disperses, it returns to qi. This is the source of the myriad transformations, the ancestor of the Three Powers, the root of heaven and earth—beyond naming or conjecture. When the kalpa of Red Clarity commenced and the Great Dao radiated its light, whether through the refinement of the great void by fire or the recording of scriptures by the August Person, the true texts descended to the world, and the Three Caverns were proclaimed. Thus, there are the divisions of the Caverns of Perfection, Mystery, and Divinity, and the designations of the Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Divine Treasure.

In the middle antiquity and thereafter, ritual systems were established, with each of the Three Caverns possessing its own scriptures and registers—hence the designation of the Three Vehicles and Nine Grades.

The Dao in its concealment is unknowable; in its function, it establishes teachings. In the Lingbao ritual system of Mount Tai, Que Shu states: The Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning is the sovereign within the Dao; the Supreme Dao Lord is the sovereign within the Dharma; and the Supreme Lord Lao is the sovereign within the Teaching.

Alas! The origins of the Three Caverns, Four Supplements, ritual registers, and the Nine Grades of the Three Vehicles are interconnected and mutually permeating. To claim that each of the Three Purities presides over one division is a deception beyond words. One must wonder if they comprehend what the Three Purities truly are. It is like guiding the blind before them or having the sightless follow in their wake. With such doctrines, how can one hope to practice their methods to deliver the hidden and aid the manifest, or dare to expect their efficacy?

The Lingbao system of Mount Tai further states: The Heavenly August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace is the one beneath the Curved Array within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. One may refer to it as the Purple Tenuity Enclosure or the Curved Array Palace, but to call it the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity is to refer to the Mystic Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, not the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. A single character’s discrepancy carries grave consequences.

In the Tang dynasty, the veneration of Lord Lao as the Sacred Ancestor Heavenly August Emperor was a ritual of ancestral reverence unique to the Tang court—distinct from the Heavenly August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. Those who, ignorant of antiquity and the present, recklessly invoke names and titles incur unforgivable transgressions.

There exists a discourse on the titles of the Sacred Ancestor Celestial Worthy, but as this position is no longer established in the present age, it is not recorded here—not by omission. This sacred rank was the founding ancestor of the Song dynasty, with the Great Sage of Primordial Heaven as his consort, now known as the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Life Mandate.

Here concludes the fourth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure*. The fifth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure* follows.

The *Dongxuan Lingbao* Ritual Master of the Southern Bureau, Compiler Jin Yunzhong of the Right Wing of the Primordial Youth’s Initial Prefecture:

**Register of the Three Realms’ Palace Bureaus**

**Upper Realm**
The Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Mysterious Capital Jade Metropolis, the Jade Clarity Realm, the Highest Clarity Realm, the Grand Clarity Realm, the Nine Heavens’ Great Emperors, the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Lords, the Three Qi Venerable, the Three Treasures Lords, the Celestial Pivot Institute under the Three Heavens’ Gates, the Terrace of Grand Mystery, the Four Heavens of the Seed People, the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm, the Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm, the Six Heavens of the Desire Realm—together comprising the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Great Blessed Worlds and the Eight Brahmā Heavens. The Five Elder Lords’ Palaces, the Eastern Ultimate Azure Palace, the Eastern Florescence Superior Minister’s Palace, the Southern Ultimate Lord of Longevity, the Western Numinous Tortoise Gate, the Four Poles Perfected Kings, the Northern Ultimate Purple Tenuity Enclosure, the Heavenly Emperor’s Enclosure, the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure, the Cinnabar Numinous Upper Palace, the Han Bureau of the Fire Mansion, the Highest Clarity Primordial Youth’s Initial Prefecture, the Northern Culmen Mysterious Standard Prefecture, the Three Realms’ Demon Kings’ Palaces, the Five Emperors’ Demon Kings’ Palaces, the Grand Yang Palace, the Grand Yin Palace, the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes Palace, the Upper Prime Celestial Officials’ Palace, the Pure Numinous Left Palace, the Primordial August Central Palace, the Cavernous Luminous Right Palace, and the Upper Prime’s Nine Prefectures, Thirty-Six Bureaus, and Three Palaces.

**Middle Realm**
The Central Marchmount Kunlun Mountain, the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, the Nine Ramparts, the Northern Capital Fengdu Mountain, the Northern Grand Supreme Lord’s Palace, the Palace of the Yin Heaven of Zhou’s Extinction, the Palace of the Heaven of Solemn Judgment for Grievous Offenses, the Palace of the Heaven of Dawn’s Endurance for Transgressions, the Palace of the Heaven of Serene Radiance for Sinful Qi. The six palace names and numbers are extracted from the *Declarations of the Perfected*; however, the fourth palace is recorded as "Serene Radiance," though it remains uncertain whether it should be "Serene Radiance" or "Serene Illumination." Later scholars should investigate this further. The Palace of the Seven Non-Heavens of Ancestral Numinosity, the Palace of the Heaven of Daring Governance over Linked Winding Realms, the Ten Kings Perfected Lords, the Cavernous Yin Metal Gate, the Northern Capital Prefecture, the Life Mandate Prefecture, the Five Paths Prefecture, the Yellow Springs Prefecture, the Venerable’s Palace, the Northern Dipper’s Ghost Officials, the Four Luminaries Perfected Duke’s Prefecture, the Transformation and Birth Prefecture, the Vast Cold Great Spirits, the Eastern Marchmount Emperor’s Palace, the Taishan Prefecture—this being the administrative seat of the Middle Prime’s Earthly Officials’ Palace, the Middle Prime’s Nine Prefectures, altogether Forty-Two Bureaus and Three Palaces.

**Lower Realm**
The Eastern Rosy Clouds Fusang Palace, the Yang Valley Divine King’s Prefecture, the Penglai Palace, the Penglai Capital Water Bureau, the Square Cauldron Azure Youth’s Palace, the Ten Continents, the Nine Rivers’ Water Emperors’ Palaces, the Four Seas’ Dragon Kings, the Four Watercourses’ Source Kings, the Five Lakes’ Lords, the Twelve River Sources, the Lower Prime’s Water Officials’ Palace, the Lower Prime’s Three Palaces, Nine Prefectures, and Forty-Two Bureaus.

Yunzhong has heard that the celestial perfected govern the upper realms, while ghosts and spirits preside over the hidden depths—matters inherently beyond the ken of mundane mortals. Yet practitioners of the Dao must attain some understanding of the fundamental principles of Heaven and Earth and possess a rough grasp of the origins and development of the teachings. Those who neither comprehend antiquity nor consult the scriptures, recklessly measuring all by their own conjectures, lead later generations astray—how lamentable!

The *Lingbao* rites respond to the world’s needs, and their protocols, memorials, and petitions must be grounded in established sources to be valid. In the *Lingbao* rites of Mount Tai, the Three Clarities’ Supreme Lords are listed as the Three Masters, the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy as the Perfected Master, and also as the Mysterious Master. Later additions to the texts invariably place the Mysterious Master at their head, though these expanded works differ from the original canons. Moreover, a "Register of Immortal Bureaus for Cultivation and Application" was established, carving each phrase from the scriptures into a separate bureau. For instance, the line "must not be detained or forced into ghostly throngs" originally referred to souls destined for deliverance, liberated from the hidden realms and no longer subject to detention or confinement among ghostly multitudes—a continuation of the preceding text’s meaning. Yet it was misconstrued as establishing a "Bureau of Non-Detention" and a "Bureau of Forced Ghostly Congregation." Similarly, "nothing it does not repel, nothing it does not exorcise, nothing it does not deliver" describes the efficacy of the Great Brahmā’s esoteric speech, yet this was distorted into a "Bureau of Universal Repulsion," a "Bureau of Universal Exorcism," and a "Bureau of Universal Deliverance." The phrase "today, rejoicing in deliverance, passing through the gates of all heavens, with demon kings as witnesses and no obstruction at the celestial gates" was truncated by omitting "today," yielding a "Bureau of Rejoicing in Deliverance," a "Bureau of Passing Through All Heavens’ Gates," a "Bureau of Demon Kings’ Witness," and a "Bureau of Unobstructed Celestial Gates." The original intent described the scripture’s efficacy: after rejoicing in deliverance today, one passes through the gates of all heavens, where demon kings bear witness, and no obstruction remains at the celestial gates. Yet these phrases were arbitrarily severed and repurposed as bureau names. Further examples include the "Bureau of Immortal Bureaus for Cultivation," the "Bureau of Immortal Bureaus for Application," the "Bureau of Resplendent Immortal Bureaus," and the "Bureau of Immortal Bureaus for the Three Realms’ Orientation"—all fabricated and absurd, with no limit to such distortions. The phrase "orientation for the Three Realms" does not appear in the scriptures, while "resplendent" is a self-designation from the text: "The resplendent multitudes of all heavens unite in merit," referring to the majesty and virtue of the demon kings within the heavens, with no bearing on other matters or the existence of such bureaus. Yet over thirty phrases like "enumerated among the Grand Mystery" were extracted from the scriptures to form the "Bureau of Resplendent Immortals," entirely divorced from the original meaning. Such inventions number no fewer than two hundred bureaus, which practitioners treat as the ranks of generals and officials, invoking them at altars without understanding the true principles or feeling any shame.

The Three Caverns and Four Supplements comprise scriptures numbering tens of millions of fascicles; if every phrase were turned into a bureau, the scriptures’ proclamations and canonical texts would be reduced to nothing but bureau names, and their profound mysteries and abstruse meanings would remain unheard. Wang Shengqing’s *Compendium of Lingbao Rites* contains many critical examinations, yet even he retained several instances of converting scriptural phrases into bureaus, failing to excise them—a lapse in judgment. The Mount Tai compilations, however, are rife with forced connections and patchwork additions that severely obstruct reason, as seen in examples like the "Palm Offering Bureau" and the "Descending Saints Bureau."

From the Song and Qi dynasties through the Tang, and even into the Song dynasty, the grand Luotian Jiao rites established three thousand six hundred positions—yet even these encompassed all necessary roles without such bureaus. The Tian Shu Yuan (Celestial Pivot Institute) resides beneath the Three Celestial Gates, as detailed in the *Rituals for Memorial Offerings*. To rename it the "Southern Culmen Celestial Pivot Institute" is still an error. For the Northern Culmen marks the Central Heaven; only beyond it does one reach the Celestial Gates. The Southern Culmen, however, descends thirty-six degrees into the earth, directly opposing the Northern Culmen. To invert and confuse these directions—ignoring north and south—how can such petitions and memorials avoid violating ritual codes and transgressing proper form?

Yunzhong has now established the *Rank of the Mysterious Vault Sovereign* to clarify the origins of the Three Clarities, Three Emperors, and Three Qi. This is followed by the *Rank of the Three Realms’ Palace Offices* to complete the categories for petitions and memorials. For prayers of supplication, exorcism, transcendence, deliverance of the departed, and salvation of the living, these are already sufficient. Yet I fear scholars may dismiss this work as incomplete and lightly add spurious bureaus with reckless names, perpetuating endless harm—thus I cannot refrain from making this distinction.

**Rank of Retreat Chambers for Facing the Origin**
The retreat chamber must remain unstained by worldly filth and unentangled with secular affairs.

To establish an altar is to model earth after heaven. Whether one’s household is rich or poor, whether the dwelling is spacious or narrow, arrange the sacred ranks, face the imperial palace to pay homage to the Origin, adorn both inner and outer with solemnity, purify both body and mind as one. Therein, the true spirits are invoked through resonance, and the supreme Dao is met within the primordial vastness. This is not about recklessly inventing names to deceive the world and mislead the people.

In Daoist temples, the positions of the Three Realms’ Most Perfect Heavenly Thearchs are set forth. If residing in a secular dwelling, establish the Three Treasures at the center and array the host of perfected beings to the sides. When paying homage, simply face the imperial palace in contemplation.

Herein is a summary of the sacred ranks:

The Most High Lord of the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Origin;
The Most High Lord of the Supreme Clarity True Realm, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure;
The Most High Lord of the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue;
The August Thearch of the Luminous Heavens;
The Great Thearch of the Northern Culmen;
The Heavenly August Thearch;
The August Earth Spirit of the Rear Soil;
The Great Thearch of Longevity;
The Great Thearch of Azure Radiance;
The Lord of the Eastern Florescence, Wood Duke, Azure Youth Dao Lord;
The Primordial Lady of the Golden Mother of the Nine Numina, the Most Perfect and Real, at the White Jade Tortoise Terrace;
The Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering, of the Eastern Culmen.

The above are the principal ranks; if no position is set, one may invoke them orally.

The Nine Heavenly Thearchs;
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs;
The Perfected Lords of the Five Fortunes, Ten Spirits, and Grand Unity;
The Eleven Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity;
The Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper;
The Three Great Thearchs of Heaven, Earth, and Water;
The Four Saintly Marshals of the Northern Culmen;
The Five Masters of Numinous Treasure;
The Filial Daoist Immortal King of the Solar Palace;
The Filial Luminous King of the Lunar Palace;
The Perfected Lord Ge of the Grand Ultimate’s Immortal Visitation;
The Most Perfect Lord of the Great Scribe of All Immortals, Wondrous Aid;
The Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen;
The Great Spirit Sima of the Salvation Office;
The Venerable Lord Han, Master of Life-Preservation;
The Exalted Spirits of the Offices of Life and Destiny;
The Exalted Spirits of Longevity, Fortune, and Deliverance from Calamity;
The Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms;
The Great Demon Kings of the Five Thearchs;
The Demon Kings of the Five Heavens;
The Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms;
The High Perfected of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace;
The Great Thearch of the Northern Darkness, Fengdu;
The Great Thearch of the Eastern Radiance, Fusang;
The Sacred Thearchs of the Five Marchmounts and Five Heavens;
The Lords of the Six Heavens and Ten Caverns of Fengdu;
The Spirit King of the Solar Valley;
The Water Thearchs of the Nine Rivers;
The Sacred Hosts of the Twelve River Sources;
The Perfected Lords and Record-Keepers of the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands;
The Immortal Hosts of the Three Hundred Sixty Named Mountains of the Kunlun Upper Palace;
The Perfected and Sacred Hosts of the Childhood Beginning Office, the Leisure Hall of Master Xiao, and the True Immortals of the Yi-Qian Retreat;
The Three and Five Merit Officials;
The Left and Right Palace Attendants;
The Left and Right Lords of the Dragon and Tiger;
The Golden Lads of Incense-Offering;
The Jade Maidens of Message-Transmission;
The Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs;
The Incense Officials of the Day.

The above total thirty-seven ranks.

At dawn, compose the spirit and settle the will. Don proper cap and robe, first stand outside the door, gaze ahead, and contemplate the gods of the body arrayed in order. Then, knock the teeth nine times.

Then softly intone the incantation:

*"Great Radiant Numinous Spirits,
Ninefold verdant ascent.
Morning glow conceals its splendor,
Washing and refining the Five Spirits.
Proclaiming the chariot of the Six Harmonies,
The Seven Spirits attuned and balanced.
Knots unravel, dispersing;
The root of the embryo purified and cleansed."*

The *Rites of Talismanic Methods at the Altar* states: "When entering a chamber, first step with the left foot; when exiting, first step with the right." Yet this text instructs: "Lift the right foot to enter the chamber"—its correctness remains uncertain. Carefully compare and verify this with other scriptures and methods. Later, the *True Reports* records: "When entering the oratory, first place the right foot forward, then bring the left foot to align with it before proceeding as usual." This ensures one’s petition is conveyed and heard above. Thus, the error in the *Rites at the Altar* is known.

Knock the teeth nine times again and recite the *Incantation for Entering the Chamber at Dawn*:

*"Fourfold Radiant Merit Officials,
Messengers of the Way’s Transmission,
Jade Lads of Message-Bearing,
Jade Maidens of Incense-Attending—
Convey my words,
To the gods of this sacred chamber.
Primordial qi of the Upper Origin,
Enter this servant’s body.
Let the memorial I present
Be reported and heard above."*

Lift the right foot to enter first. Before the sacred altar, where flames blaze and incense rises in abundance, calm the heart and settle the qi. Visualize the Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Lords of the Dragon and Tiger, the Golden Lads of Incense-Offering, and the Jade Maidens of Message-Transmission standing in attendance beside the incense table. The sun and moon withdraw nine inches from the face; the Northern Dipper hovers overhead; the body faces forward, enveloped in threefold layers of deep, verdant qi. Then, hold the breath, compose the spirit, and bow reverently toward the mat—or hold the tablet and bow three times. Knock the teeth and, following the rites, present the petition. Whatever the heart supplicates, let sincerity ascend directly, swiftly reaching the Nine Heavens.

Hold the breath and exit through the earthly portal, reciting the *Incantation for Exiting the Chamber at Dawn*:

*"Emerging from yin into yang,
The myriad spirits unfurl.
Having opened the gates and completed the task,
I request the closure of the Yellow Chamber.
Jade Maidens of Incense-Attending,
Brightly prepare the divine palace."*

When entering the oratory to burn incense and pay homage to the Perfected, never glance back; when exiting, do not turn to look. While conducting the rites, refrain from speaking to others and keep the feet together when stepping over the threshold. Do not hold incense in the mouth, nor use hearth fire to burn it. On days of *wu-chen* or *wu-xu*, or during fierce winds, sudden storms, violent thunder, or flashing lightning, temporarily suspend the practice. Wait until the celestial qi has settled before resuming the dawn observances.

All the above are prohibitions within the method; transgression incurs fault.

At dusk, enter the oratory, concentrate the spirit upon the Nine Gods, align with the imperial mat below, and knock the teeth nine times.

The incantation reads:
"Mysterious Perfection of the Seven Stars,
Majestic Sovereign of the Ling Soul.
Radiance flows inward, illuminating,
Permeating and governing the Dipper’s spirit.
The Three Terraces gleam resplendent,
Seven essences entwine the numinous fluid.
Golden pendants and tiger registers
Guard and defend the Gate of Life.
Divine transformation pervades the void,
Drawing the wheel into the Purple Court."

Next, knock the teeth and recite the incantation for entering the oratory at night:
"Four Superior Merit Officers,
Dragon-Tiger Envoys,
Orthodox One’s primordial *qi*,
Jade Maidens attending incense.
For matters to be reported at night,
May the Luminous Youth and the Great Mystery Maiden
Accompany me within.
May the governance of the Yellow Chamber
Convey all petitions upward,
Making them heard above."

The rest follows the dawn observance ritual.

The incantation for exiting the oratory at night:
"Great Yin of the Mysterious Above,
Eight Windows open in clarity.
For matters reported at night,
May the Maiden transmit the numinous.
When affairs conclude, return to position,
And the myriad spirits will all be at peace."

Alternatively, one may sit upright within the oratory, concentrating the spirit and engaging in the secret practices cultivated in daily life—this is especially excellent. Or, if practicing other methods with distinct protocols, follow their respective guidelines.

As *Zhen’gao* states: "Whenever entering the chamber to burn incense, one should face the mat and bow in reverence, knock the teeth, and silently pray. Whatever is expressed, let it be with utmost sincerity, and one will surely receive a response."

Yunzhong respectfully notes from *Zhen’gao*: "Those who uphold the Dao should meticulously prepare their oratory chambers. This is to dispel malevolent impurities, cast aside worldly distractions, and create a space for dawn observances." Initially, such chambers were never given specific names.

During the Eastern Han, the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master cultivated inner perfection and performed extraordinary deeds externally. Traversing famous mountains, his beneficence extended to all beings, yet he never dared to presumptuously establish names or falsely exalt himself. In the first year of *Han’an* under Emperor Shun, the Celestial Worthy descended and personally transmitted the Dao’s decree, saying: "When I descended upon the Shu Mountains, I established the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, corresponding above to the Twenty-Eight Constellations and below to the offices of the Dark Registers, overseeing the life, death, sins, and blessings of the world. Recently, demonic forces have encroached, wrongfully harming the people. Thus, I commanded the Celestial Master to subdue the deviant and restore these *Zhi*." By the Tang dynasty, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozong’s name, the world began calling them the Twenty-Four *Hua*. Hence, they are now collectively termed *Zhi-Hua*, originating in antiquity and later revived by the Celestial Master. The people born within the sixty-year cycle are assigned to these divisions, and in the Register of General Merit, one’s life destiny is sealed with the corresponding *Zhi*’s mark. The Celestial Master also revitalized the Dao’s fortunes, restoring the *Zhi* and establishing them as courts of blessing.

During the Jin, Xu Jingyang possessed the innate qualities of an immortal. After prolonged cultivation of the Supreme Dao, at over forty years of age, he resigned his office and returned east. By then, his practice had already gained renown. Traveling with the Perfected Wu to Songyang, he heard of the Yellow Hall Oratory in Danyang County, where the female master, Chen Mu, resided. He sought her to inquire about the Dao’s mysteries. Mu then presented the bronze talismans and iron charters left by Master Lan, the Golden Elixir’s sacred scriptures, and various esoteric precepts, along with the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King, entrusting them all to Master Xu. Later, Mu flew a thatched hut to the southern side of West Mountain, where Master Xu found the site and built a shrine, also naming it the Yellow Hall—now known as Chongzhen Abbey.

When the Perfected Lord first visited the flying thatch, he subdued malevolent spirits along the way. The next day, ascending the mountain’s peak, he pointed to a fissure in the spring halfway up and declared, "A strange entity lurks here, which will later cause calamity." He then established an oratory to suppress it—now called Longcheng Abbey. Upon returning to Yuzhang Commandery, he slew a monstrous sea serpent, leaving behind an altar and well to quell future disasters. The formations he arranged resembled the Dipper’s stars, including the Alchemical Transformation Oratory, the Ritual Rhythm Oratory, the Cinnabar Talisman Oratory, the Flowering Banner Purple Yang Oratory, the Huoyang Oratory, and the Arrayed Perfected Oratory. Many such sites exist, most now serving as abbeys and temples, fulfilling the Perfected Lord’s original intent: to pacify sacred mountains, subdue malevolent anomalies, and ensure their names endure with heaven and earth, their merits equaling the cosmos, their virtue profound and achievements lofty. Even those who ascended with their households did not act as common talisman-water practitioners, privately establishing names for themselves.

Those whose virtue does not match the Han Celestial Master should not presume to revive the *Zhi-Hua*. Those whose merits do not equal Xu Jingyang’s should not presume to establish oratory names. Beyond this, there is no scriptural basis—this is the universal consensus of the world.

In recent times, practitioners of the Numinous Treasure tradition have all acted with false arrogance, presumptuously establishing oratory names without weighing their gravity. Lacking humility, they surpass the Han Celestial Master and rival Xu Jingyang, even claiming: "In silent meditation, within the golden light, the oratory’s name manifests." Alas, is this not deceiving heaven? If one could behold golden light in meditation and receive celestial scriptures face-to-face, that would be the station of an Upper Immortal—hardly one to linger long among mortals. How could such a one remain in the world? This is not the proper way.

Those who uphold the practice should modestly abide by their station. Such presumption is no way to nurture disciples. If among the dust-bound there are superior scholars, or transcendent recluses dwelling in abbeys or households, they should prepare oratory chambers for rigorous cultivation. When traveling to distant lands or sojourning elsewhere, they may face the void and pay homage from afar, which can also move the Supreme Mystery. There is no need to presumptuously establish oratory names or falsely claim divine transmission to embellish deceit and delusion. This is hereby proclaimed and reported.

Following the old system, one may inscribe "Beneath the Dipper of the Three Heavens, South" as the placard. According to the rites performed, the "Bureau of the Great Numinous Treasure" may be used—what harm is there in this? Yet one must never yield to worldly custom to aid in deception. If a household of means establishes a Daoist abbey and displays its name, or constructs halls and pavilions to affix their placards, these are but secular titles for towers and pavilions, not to be presented before Heaven, Earth, or the spirits. In such cases, they may do as they please.

When holding the *cunsi* ranks, intending to perform the Dao or discourse on scriptures, one should first prepare fragrant water for bathing. Nowadays, only peachwood and white bedstraw, or light bamboo leaves, are boiled for the bath. Formerly, the "Five Fragrances Decoction" was used—comprising *qingmuxiang* (costus root), *gansong* (spikenard), clove, aloeswood, and *baizhi* (angelica)—all boiled together. The Tiantai method employs *xunluxiang* (frankincense), a substance forbidden by Daoists, not an ancient practice.

First, visualize the Three Dawns and sip the water while gazing at the bath. Recite the incantation:
*"True liquid of the Great Mystery, refining qi to quicken the numinous.
Bathed in azure radiance, chanting the Cavernous Scriptures.
Seven ancestors ascend as immortals; I soar to the Upper Clarity."*

When undressing to bathe, recite:
*"Palace of spirits shakes the heavens, black clouds part asunder.
Molten gold and fire bells gleam, casting boundless splendor.
Grant me communion with the true, roaming all heavens.
Measureless salvation of beings, summoning immortal destiny."*

When removing garments, recite:
*"Five Dipper robes arrayed, dragon and tiger attend the true.
The Three Luminaries revealed, ascending to Jade Dawn.
Shedding clothes to become immortal, grant me eternal life."*

For the bathing incantation, recite:
*"Jade springs of the Rain Pool bathe my form.
Within, refine the Five Viscera; without, open the Nine Gates.
Let qi flow freely, washing away corpse-filth and impurity.
Ten thousand cycles of protection, ascend in majesty."*

Entering the Imperial Court.

When donning the crown, recite:
*"Azure clouds layer in mystery, granting me communion with the true.
Crown and topknot summon immortals; the Five Qi gather the real.
Divine radiance shines forth, ascending to the Imperial Court."*

Take a cup of peach-bamboo infusion and drink first. Recite:
*"In ritual codes, drink precedes bathing; in scriptural methods, bathing precedes drinking.
Yellow spirits guard the opening; the Azure Emperor protects the soul.
Heavenly couriers roar, ten thousand demons lose their essence.
Corpse-blood is wholly cleansed; green worms vanish in form.
The Seven Po dissolve and transform; purple clouds arise of themselves.
Roam and feast in the Great Primordium; exalted perfected ones join in kinship."*

When dressing, recite:
*"Divine youths attend my robes; jade maidens burn incense.
Ascend to bow in the scripture chamber, where jade tones resound like chimes.
Deliver my seven ancestors, dispelling filth and calamity.
Prolong years and preserve existence; the cloud-rooted elixir endures."*

Enter the chamber and sit in quietude. Envision the void’s profundity, above the azure skies and purple clouds, the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Emperors in regal attire, holding jade tablets, standing upright, arrayed in all directions like stars encircling the Pole, in the manner of the audience at the Primordial Pearl.

Then strike the teeth once and, with focused mind, bow to each Heavenly Emperor in turn—this suffices as a simplified method.

Another method: envision the Thirty-Two Heavens’ golden towers and jade palaces, each Emperor dwelling within, then bow in the mind. Yet merely imagining the towers, halls, and palaces becomes cumbersome and taxing.

Once settled, face east and recite the scripture while bowing in the heart, beginning with the Great Sovereign Yellow Once-Heaven. Next, envision green, yellow, and white clouds of qi emerging from the Three Elixir Fields, filling the chamber in misty abundance, ascending to merge with the Primordial, Mysterious, and Original Three Qi of the Three Realms, blending with heaven and earth to pervade the ten directions. For the Three Qi all arise from the One Qi, and dwelling within the Three Qi manifests the adept’s practice of preserving the One amid the Three.

Next, envision the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver on the left, the White Tiger from the lungs on the right, the Vermilion Bird from the heart in front, the Dark Warrior from the kidneys behind, the Lion from the Lower Elixir Field below, and the White Cranes from behind the eyebrows—six each, arrayed to left and right. Behind the eyebrows lie the two small cavities of the Six Harmonies’ abode, from which a slender moon emerges: the sun as a purple-red light with nine rays, the moon as a yellow-white light with ten rays, each nine inches from the face, their radiance and mist filling the chamber in resplendent gold and jade. The rays return into the nose, permeating the four inches behind the brain at the Golden Flower Palace, where a wheel-like orb appears at the nape, vast as a chariot wheel, its luminosity blazing across the ten directions.

Once this vision is clear, recite the secret incantation—speaking aloud while the ears hear no sound is the secret incantation:
*"Supreme Mysterious Primordial Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within your servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attending messengers, the incense-attending Golden Youths, the message-transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the daily incense officials—thirty-two each."*

These lines alone constitute the secret incantation; no other incantation exists. The following text is drawn from the scripture’s purport.

Envision each figure standing solemnly in attendance before you.

Draw qi thirty-two times—inhale, do not exhale. Another method: inhale through the nose, beginning with the Yellow Once-Heaven, permeating the entire form, thoroughly saturating within and without.

Facing east—the direction of longevity, revered by all heavens—burn incense, compose yourself, focus the mind, and recite with measured voice. Mere hasty recitation yields no benefit; errors may arise. Re-read the preceding thirty characters unhurriedly. Do not rush for the sake of completing repetitions, lest the effort be in vain. Modulate the voice in chanting to harmonize spirit and soul, ensuring the chamber’s incense qi remains unbroken.

For the first recitation, read from the preface to the end. Thereafter, begin with the *Original Beginning’s Mysterious Numinous Treasure Fundamental Chapter*, completing ten cycles as one full recitation. If urgent matters arise, briefly pause, then resume envisioning and recite the preface ten times as prescribed.

Upon completion, compose the spirit, still the mind, and gather in the Merit Officials, Jade Maidens, and others, saying:
*"Your servant has finished reciting the scripture. The Three and Five Merit Officials, left and right attending messengers, incense-attending Golden Youths, message-transmitting Jade Maidens, Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and daily incense officials—thirty-two each—who emerged from your servant’s body, now return to their golden chambers and jade halls. Those on the left return to the left; those on the right return to the right. Let none be misplaced. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before."*

It has long been heard that scripture recitation is the path of spirit refinement and the foremost practice of pure cultivation. First, one must grasp the scripture’s essential meaning; next, clarify the visualization during recitation. Read the text to comprehend its significance; follow its methods to still the spirit. Practiced outwardly, it can aid beings and establish merit. Cultivated inwardly, it can enable transcendence and deliverance from the world. Whether the spirit is enlightened depends on the practitioner.

If one merely recites with the mouth while the heart strays, speaks of integrity while acting in filth, voices the scripture’s words without cease yet harbors wicked thoughts, from youth to old age the practice yields no fruition—how then can one demand karmic response from ten thousand recitations?

Moreover, the profound principles within the scriptures were already mastered by perfected ones of ancient times, who first penetrated their chapters and thereby attained the extraordinary. On the days of practicing the scriptural methods, one should bathe in fragrant waters, envision the orb at the nape radiating light across the ten directions, and only then, with clarity, recite the secret incantation. This follows the stabilization of visualization.

Thereafter, secretly invoke the Supreme Mysterious Primordial Most High Dao Lord, summoning forth the Merit Officials and scribes from within your servant’s body. The secret incantation is not meant to be heard by the ears, ensuring the mind’s focus and the hundred spirits’ solemn guard. This expresses the intent of purifying the hall, practicing cultivation, and reciting scriptures to ascend directly to the Thirty-Two Heavens, drawing qi thirty-two times—all actions performed during the secret incantation. The principle is evident and beyond doubt.

Yet here, a spurious segment of secret incantation has been arbitrarily inserted into the scriptural method. Its wording bears no connection to the scripture’s meaning, making its rationale and application difficult to uphold.

The present scripture begins with the Supreme August Yellow Brilliance Heaven, where the Emperor Yulan presides in jade radiance; and the Great Ultimate Pacifying Nurturing Heaven, where the Emperor Daze governs the Dharma Gate—these are the hidden taboo names of the heavens, their secret appellations. By virtue of these, the scripture universally delivers celestial and human beings, its efficacy thus manifest: this is the first chapter. The first chapter speaks of the flying aerial sounds of the Desire Realm, extending to the point where the five destinies are about to turn—what then shall I do? This refers to the demon-kings’ chants in the aerial spaces above the Three Realms. Reciting them ten thousand times ensures the demon-kings’ protection and welcome, yet if one leaks or grows arrogant, calamity befalls even the seven generations of ancestors: this is the second chapter.

It is then summarized: these two chapters together comprise the hidden secret sounds of the celestial emperors of the heavens and the numinous demon-kings. The celestial emperors refer to the taboo names of the thirty-two heavens in the first chapter, while the hidden secret sounds of the numinous demon-kings refer to the demon-kings’ songs of the Three Realms. Thus it is said that both are the words of the Great Brahma. The phrase “both are” collectively refers to these two chapters. The meaning flows in unbroken sequence, the purport seamlessly connected—how could any addition or deletion be permitted?

Yet some claim that before these two chapters, there is missing text, that there were originally other words not included in the scripture. They have therefore fabricated two chapters to deceive later learners. The foolish, credulous of such proliferation, have added secret incantations and forged two chapters. These are not continuations from the Tiantai Dharma tradition but originated during the Liu-Han period. Now such theories have spread throughout the regions east and west of the Yangzi. However, such rumors cease before the discernment of the wise; men of insight and understanding will surely reject them together, preventing the further spread of heterodox doctrines—this would be most excellent.

In all scripture recitation and visualization, the inner responds to the outer. The One Qi divides into three, forming the Mysterious Primordial Beginning Three Qi. At the inception of the One Qi, there is no form, no name; when the Three Qi divide, they become the Three Honored Ones. Heaven employs this qi to initiate the creation of the cosmos; humans receive this qi to generate and nurture their bodies. Thus, the Three Qi issuing from within the body interlace throughout the chamber, ascending to resonate with the Three Qi in the heavens, filling the six directions. By preserving the inner truth, the outer truth naturally responds; by settling the spirit, heaven and earth all return. With time, one merges with the Dao and attains authenticity, transmuting into immortality and altering one’s substance. This is neither solely external nor neither internal nor external. Let the scholar examine this in detail.

The Liu-Han period refers to the Five Dynasties era.

Here ends *The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure, Scroll Five*
*Here begins The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure, Scroll Six*

**The Jade Slips of Numinous Chapters, Section on □□□□□□□**

Compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Registrar of the Southern Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Daoist Masters, Provisional Attendant of the Right in the Office of the Initial Repository

□□□□□□□ □□□□□□ □□□□□□ □□□□□□ □, □, □, □, □, □, □, □ *hong*, *ji*, *ji*, *fangzhong*, *biaode*, *feng*

The above forty-one characters are to be inscribed in cinnabar upon yellow paper. Upon entering the chamber, one recites them in silent meditation, or cuts them into fine circles, or burns them to ash and mixes with water in secrecy. Then, invoking the Most High, one purifies the water and ingests it.

**Oral Petition:**
*"Your servant [Name] humbly states: This servant, a walking corpse of the dusty realm, bears a coarse and humble form. By fortunate karmic destiny, I have been graced by the true wind. It is my duty to inwardly refine form and spirit, outwardly dispel delusion and falsehood, assist the great transformation of heaven and earth, and uphold the primal principles of the Dao and virtue. Yet my heart remains as obstructed as thatch, unable to discern the signs of qi. Having witnessed the Jade Slips of the Numinous Treasure, I know they can record qi and gather spirit. Today, in this pure hall, I perform the rites, ingesting the talisman and invoking qi. Reverently, I contemplate the Most High, the formless and nameless Perfect Great Dao, who initiated the root of yin and yang, established the embryo of heaven and earth. In compassion for the ignorance of later learners, You universally bestow the primordial true qi, infusing it within the four limbs and hundred bones, steaming the five viscera and six palaces. May it grant penetrating vision, nothing left unpervaded. By wielding this dharma, all demons are vanquished; the three disasters do not approach, and a hundred blessings converge. May I soon encounter a perfected one and swiftly receive true transmission."*

*"With utmost reverence, I present this oral petition. Your servant, trembling with awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates twice, and respectfully speaks."*

The essence of the Jade Slips may be summarized thus: This is the ultimate origin of the Great Dao—ineffable, ungraspable by reason. Wondrous existence, wondrous non-existence—how could it reside in form or trace? Yet since the establishment of ritual methods, these numinous sounds have been translated to propagate true transformation. Thus, the written talismans and their strokes cannot be dispensed with.

Other versions record the □□ taboo names of heaven and earth, the □□ taboo names of the sun and moon, the radiant branches of the Dao: General Liang Gaojian, General Shuang; the inner taboo names of the Emperors of the Sun and Moon: *xuan*, *kuo*, *yi*, *gou*, *bi*, *qian*, *run*, *chang*, *kai*, *yu*; the taboo name of the Jade Sovereign; □□□□□□ the taboo names of the Southern Dipper; □□□□□□□ the taboo names of the Northern Dipper; (□□□ the taboo names of the Three Terraces; *hong*, *ji*, *ji* the inner taboo names of the Three Heavens; *yan*, *shan* the hidden taboo names of the Three Heavens; *fangzhong*, *biaode*, *feng* the true taboo names of the Three Heavens; □□□ the true taboo names of the Three Masters; *qiaoguangyin* the taboo names of the Three Masters; □ the taboo name of Zhenwu; □ the taboo name of Tianyou; □□□□□ the taboo names of the Five Marchmounts; □□□ the taboo names of the Three Paths; □□□□□□ the taboo names of the Six Ding; □□□□□□ the taboo names of the Six Jia; □□□□□□□ the inner taboo names of the Divine Tiger Lady: He □, Qiao □, Hou □, Wei □, Zhang □, Liu □; Jiang Ren’gui; the taboo names of the Great Sage Divine Tiger: □, □, □, □, □, □, □, □; Cui Shuxuan, Lu Jiquan, Deng Hengwen, Dou Yangguang (also named Yang Yanzhi); the taboo names of the Supreme Heavenly Perfected: Taiyi Heavenly Perfected, Taiyi Primordial Perfected, True Immortal Perfected One; the three true taboo names: *Dongxuanqian*; the taboo name of the Northern Culmen: *Tianming Changren Huan Ning*; the taboo name of the Supreme Emperor: □□□ *Wuyou Shou*; the taboo name of Taiyi: □□□□□□□; the taboo names of thunder and rain.

In total, one hundred and sixty-five characters comprise the Jade Slips. Additionally, there is a silent petition, recorded in the second section. The language may seem plain and unrefined, yet it does not touch the true essence of the Great Dao. For instance, the seven characters *kui*, *zhi*, *pi*, *ao* are found in the *Jade Chapters* and astronomical texts as star names. Other terms, such as the inner taboo names of the Three Heavens and the hidden taboo names of the heavens, are celestial sounds, not of this world’s script. They harmonize with the sounds of heaven, embodying the principle of sympathetic resonance.

Heaven and earth are the forms of the Dao; primordial qi is its root. Before the separation of the One, there was no form, no name. When heaven and earth first divided, writing had not yet been established. As celestial patterns took shape and earthly forms solidified, the ruler of heaven was simply called the Supreme Emperor. Later, as numinous chapters leaked secrets and fire refined the firmament, qi was bestowed to form writing, and talismanic diagrams gradually emerged. In the middle antiquity, teachings were established, translated into worldly script. Thus, heavenly perfected ones acquired titles, stellar lodgings gained names, astronomical canons were compiled, and earthly principles were distinguished. Hence, the scriptures contain the hidden names of the heavens—these are the names and titles of the celestial sovereigns and perfected ones. If we were to directly state the names of heaven as □ and earth as □, we would impose designations upon the unnameable. Though there may be some basis for this, it is unwise to divulge them carelessly, lest we be ridiculed by those of profound understanding.

Here, we compile forty-nine characters from the ancient Numinous Treasure methods, remnants from after the separation of heaven and earth, when scriptures and decrees had already emerged—merely the names of stellar images and numinous entities, slightly easier to verify in dharma texts and scriptural records. To claim that heaven and earth have surnames and names would be as absurd as the frivolous debates of the *Tai Mi*. Furthermore, ancient methods include internal refinement techniques: inscribe the Jade Slips’ forty-nine characters in cinnabar, place them in a small bottle, seal with seven measures of pure earth, and at dawn recite the incantation, drawing the qi of the five directions to blow into the bottle. Beginning on a *jiazi* day, after the second *jiazi* cycle, retrieve the Jade Slips from the bottle and burn them for ingestion. In ancient methods, this is called the *Internal Refinement of the Treasure Repository*. Since we have already presented the oral petition and ingested the Jade Slips, this method is not separately expounded here. It is overly bound to form and trace, not the direct and easy path. Nevertheless, as it exists in ancient texts, we dare not omit it, hence its outline is appended here.

**Section on the Three Mornings’ Radiant Luminaries**
The sun and moon adorn the heavens; the Dark Dipper stands at the center. Harmonizing the five planets, they regulate and rectify yin and yang.

The Three Mornings’ Radiant Luminaries govern the fundamental principles, their brilliance illuminating the six directions. Through them, the Three Powers are established, and the myriad beings draw sustenance to come into existence. Humans alone receive the harmonious balance of centrality, forming their upright physical bodies. If one can cultivate and refine spirit and qi, moderate and harmonize temperament, maintain external stillness and internal clarity, and align movement with the celestial measures, then one may gather and ingest the radiant luminaries, summon and absorb their numinous effulgence, drawing them into the body. Therein, the hundred spirits are purified and refined, and when this is extended throughout the world, the multitudes receive its blessings. As for the spreading of qi and the writing of talismans, these are but secondary matters.

If the purity of qi does not abide in the breast, or if the turbidity of emotions obstructs the numinous palace, then even if one obtains divine texts and secret incantations and directly encounters the Three Mornings, it will be in vain. The esoteric secrets of the Highest Numinous Treasure and the August Void begin with accumulating the One to generate the Three. When the heart and the Dao are united, one ascends to the realm of the Numinous Treasure. For those of the next rank, the light of the Three Mornings serves as the pivotal mechanism of the Numinous Treasure. From this passage, it may be known that Jin Guangsheng attained the Dao—his words are most wondrous.

The Divine Lord of the Eastern Minister, Controller of Destinies, said: Master Wang was once bestowed *The Supreme Clarity Hall’s Mysterious and True Upper Scripture*. After purifying his fast and resting his roots, he visualized the sun and moon within his mouth—by day, the sun; by night, the moon—each as large as a ring. The sun was crimson with nine rays of purple light, and the moon was yellow with ten rays of white light. He visualized swallowing the luminous essence of their rays, practicing this in secret without count. When not engaged in this visualization, he caused the sun and moon to return and reside in the Hall of Clarity on his face—the sun on the left, the moon on the right—so that the two luminaries merged their qi with the pupils of his eyes. This Dao can gather and circulate generative essence, harmonize the hun-soul and spirit, command the attendance of the Six Ding spirits, and secure the protection of celestial soldiers. This is the Dao of the Highest Perfected.

*The Scripture of the Supreme Mystery* must first be sworn to before practice, and only after practice may one hear the Dao of jade pendants and golden earrings. Ji Wei, the younger brother of Lord Mao, once maintained a long fast for three years before achieving it. Only after exhausting his solitary devotion was he able to attain it, whereupon his body became suffused with divine light, and only then did he receive the scripture. This is the Dao of the Mysterious and True—essential yet not burdensome. I have always treasured and guarded it, keeping it close at hand, and thus reveal it only to those who are cautious and discreet.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Mystical and True* had not yet descended to the world when the Perfected of the Great Void, the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, transmitted this inner method: On the fifth night of each lunar month at midnight, visualize the solar emblem within the heart, as if the sun enters through the mouth, illuminating the heart’s interior and merging its radiance with the sun’s light. When complete, one should feel the heart grow warm, its rosy glow suffusing the face. After a long while, recite the incantation:

*"Great brightness nurtures essence,
Within, the cinnabar heart is refined.
Radiance merges in union,
Divine perfected ones come to seek."*

Upon finishing the incantation, swallow saliva nine times. Repeat this practice on the twenty-fifth and twenty-ninth days of the month. It sharpens perception, unblocks the hundred passages, imparts a jade-like luminosity to the face, and a golden luster to the body. After fifteen years of practice, the Great One will dispatch a treasure chariot to welcome the adept to the Great Empyrean. Though this method should be performed frequently, it need not be confined to these specific days. This passage is excerpted from *The Supreme Scripture for Dispelling Demons*.

The method of the Perfected of Eastern Flower for absorbing the solar and lunar emblems: Men absorb the solar emblem, women the lunar emblem. Practicing this daily without fail renders one keen and luminously clear, causes the five viscera to flourish, refines the hun-soul and po-soul, harmonizes the six bowels, and is the Dao of immortality and deathlessness.

**Solar Emblem**　**Lunar Emblem**

The Lady of Southern Marchmount said: The Palace of Great Square Jasper is the abode where the Azure Lord often resides. Those above are all lofty immortals of heaven, the lords and ministers of the Great Ultimate, and the dwelling place of the various Controllers of Destiny. Even those who have already attained the Dao and become perfected still practice the method of absorbing the solar and lunar rays. Simply visualize within the heart an emblem the size of a coin, crimson in color. Then visualize the sun’s nine rays ascending from the heart through the throat to the teeth, where the radiant beams return to the stomach. After a long while, with eyes closed, clearly visualize the heart and stomach, then exhale qi and rinse the mouth with saliva thirty-nine times before stopping. Perform this thrice daily. After one year of practice, all illnesses will vanish at once.

After five years of practice, the body will radiate luminous splendor; after eighteen years, one will surely attain the Dao. Walking beneath the sun, one will cast no shadow, and repel all malevolent spirits, ghosts, and inauspicious qi. Constantly visualize the sun within the heart and the moon within the *Niwan* (Mud-Palace). At night, absorb the moon’s essence: visualize the moon’s ten white rays descending from the brain into the throat, without passing through the teeth, then returning to the stomach, following the same method as solar absorption.

The above methods are those of the various Perfected Ones, recorded in the *Upper and Middle Chapters of the Great Wisdom Sutra*. By practicing them diligently, one will surely witness the Great Peace.

It is further said: The Way of visualizing the sun in the heart and the moon in the *Niwan* is simple and easily attainable. If practiced without interruption, it eliminates the Three Corpses, a hundred illnesses, and a thousand afflictions—it is the Way of refining the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul. When the sun and moon perpetually illuminate the body’s center, no ghost can escape its form. The Azure Lord now practices this; I am one such practitioner. I now impart this to you, that you may secretly teach it to those of sincere intent. This Way may also be practiced alongside the precious scriptural methods of solar and lunar absorption, and combining them is likewise excellent. The Purple Text contains sixteen characters for the sun and twenty-four for the moon.

The immortals perform a thousand tasks day and night yet feel no fatigue, for they are illuminated by the utmost diligence in the Dao—this must not be neglected. These are the words the Heavenly Ones imparted to Perfected Yang.

For ordinary practitioners, constantly visualize their own form as if seated before them, facing the Emperor on High, with the radiance of the sun and moon fully illuminating their body. The sun is on the left, the moon on the right, each nine inches from the face. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth thrice and softly recite the incantation:
*"Primal Origin, Supreme Perfected,
Dual Effulgences, Two Mysteries.
On the right, restrain the seven po;
On the left, embrace the three hun.
May my spirit be luminous,
And ever dwell with the divine."*

After reciting, knock the teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva seven times, and cease.

This is the Way of the Thearch for refining the form, restraining the hun-soul, and controlling the po-soul, enabling one to attain spiritual clarity and the immortality of the divine transcendents.

**Upper Clarity Purple Text Method of Ingesting Qi**
*(Also called: The Crimson Elixir, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, Jade Embryo Scripture)*

At sunrise, face east, knock the teeth nine times, and softly recite the names of the solar soul and the solar emperor:
*"Solar soul, Crimson Radiance,
Illuminating Unity, Verdant Veil.
Returning clouds, Scarlet Youth,
Mysterious Whirlwind, Blazing Image."*

After reciting these sixteen characters, clench the fists and visualize the five-colored flowing clouds within the sun approaching and enveloping the body, with the sunlight and radiant clouds entering the mouth.

**Upper Clarity Purple Text Method of Ingesting Lunar Essence**

At moonrise, face west, knock the teeth ten times, and softly recite the names of the lunar soul and the Lunar Lady:
*"Lunar soul, Warm and Serene,
Fragrant and Luminous, Veiled in Void.
Graceful, Empty, Spirit-Orchid,
Lush Blossoms, Curved Petals.
Pure Gold, Clear Tomb,
Luminous Countenance, Pristine Standard."*

After reciting these twenty-four characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored essence-light of the moon entering the mouth. Also perceive within the moonlight a yellow qi, the size of an eye’s pupil, called the *Flying Yellow, Lunar Radiance, Jade Embryo Essence*. Those who cultivate this Way become immortals who ride the sun and moon.

The above methods are drawn from the *Upper Scripture* and various passages in the *Declarations of the Perfected*, representing the gateway to the practices of the loftiest transcendents. If the mind is not yet pure and the spirit not yet settled, one cannot hope for spiritual efficacy. Those whose strength is insufficient may begin with simpler methods of visualizing the spirits and invoking qi, which, though similar to common practices, can still yield true resonance and numinous response if pursued with utmost sincerity. Yet these remain within the realm of seeking through form and trace, as outlined in the following section.

**Method of Drinking the Dipper’s Radiance**

On the nights of the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of each month, when the moon and stars shine brightly and heaven and earth are resplendent, at dusk face the Dipper, burn incense, form the Dipper mudra, and from the hour of *xu* to *chen*, knock the teeth seven times—once for each recitation of a Star Lord’s name. First exhale turbid qi three times, then recite the incantation:
*"Mighty and numinous,
Divine radiance of the Seven Stars.
Inwardly and outwardly upright,
Merge with me now!"*
*(Swiftly, as the law commands.)*

After reciting, visualize the seven rays of starlight descending into the mouth, inhale and drink seven mouthfuls, then vigorously rinse with saliva and swallow. Calm the spirit and bow twice. Recite:
*"Divine radiance pours in,
Filling the five viscera and six bowels.
Preserve the true, expel the impure,
Swiftly, as the law commands!"*

With prolonged practice, efficacy will manifest in dreams of the sun, moon, and stars, or visions of dragons and tigers, thunder and lightning—these are the steps to ascent.

**Method of Absorbing Solar Radiance**

At dawn before sunrise, burn incense, face east, settle the qi, and stabilize the spirit. As the sun begins to rise, bow twice and close the eyes. Assume the proper posture, invoke the Solar Emperor and the divine immortals of the solar palace, and beseech them to descend their numinous rays to bathe your body. Pray for the blossoming of the five viscera and the radiance of the body. Silently recite the sixteen-character solar incantation, draw in the light, and swallow it until the abdomen is full. Bow twice and withdraw, continuing to absorb and swallow the light without fixed limit.

**Method of Absorbing Lunar Radiance**

At dusk as the moon begins to rise, face the moonlight, settle the qi, and stabilize the spirit. Bow twice and close the eyes. Assume the proper posture, invoke the Lunar Thearch and the divine immortals of the lunar palace, and beseech them to descend their numinous rays to bathe your body. Pray for the blossoming of the five viscera and the radiance of the body. Silently recite the twenty-four-character lunar incantation, draw in the moon’s white light, swallow it until the abdomen is full, then bow twice and withdraw. From the first crescent to the full moon, cease absorption after the full moon, as the lunar light wanes. Resume the practice the following month as before.

As a humble student of the middle way, I cannot claim mastery of these profound mysteries. Yet from the teachings of masters and friends, and glimpses of the scriptures and canons of our tradition, I have gained some insight—how could I remain silent? I share this in the hope that fellow seekers may benefit.

The Three Dawns are also called the Three Lights or the Three Marvels of Heaven, namely the sun, moon, and stars. The stellar bodies are too numerous to enumerate in full.

Beyond the Celestial Throne, only the Central Dipper stands preeminent among the constellations, regulating the celestial meridians and serving as the source of generation and transformation, the office of the throat and tongue—thus the pivot of all stars, and together with the sun and moon, the Three Lights.

When the Great Ultimate first arose, the pure *qi* formed heaven, and the radiant essence of *qi* became the sun, moon, and stars. The Dipper’s handle revolves at the center of heaven, and below, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Nine Provinces and their territories, all living beings, mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees—none exist without relying on it for sustenance, all arising by its agency. Without it, heaven would lack the means to rectify its principles; without it, humanity could not refine form and substance.

Those who pursue the higher studies, cultivating subtle *qi* and emptiness, thereby illuminate the mystery within mystery and awaken to the Dao within the Dao. When primordial *qi* is unified as one, there is no need to draw in radiance or gather *qi*—yet this is no ordinary discourse for the common world.

From this arise methods and techniques: what art does not depend on the Three Lights? What practice can dispense with the Central Dipper? For those who tread the highest path, stillness and seated meditation, inward focus and *qi*-absorption remain essential even after attaining perfection. Those of lesser attainment may burn incense, gaze upon celestial images, recite incantations, and drink in light—though their forms may yet be constrained, their single-minded devotion may still yield response.

Other methods of *qi*-absorption follow the sun’s movement—one degree every twelve hours—and the moon’s shift of two palaces every five days, with accumulated minutes and calculations of waxing and waning. The Dipper’s pointer aligns with *Hekui* at *Xu* and *Tiangang* at *Chen*; the monthly determinant is fixed by the central *qi*, its direction calculated by the hour. Only then does one face the proper direction to draw in *qi*.

Though these methods exhaust their subtleties, they must not be mistaken for the true path of attainment, for they are not the primary focus of the supreme scriptures. The *Tianxin* Orthodox Method takes the Three Lights as its foundation, fulfilling its duty to respond to the world and dispel malevolence, and establishing the means for great transformation. In all its practices, past and present, the Three Lights cannot be set aside. The methods of orientation, hand seals, and stepping patterns follow a graded progression—no stage may be skipped.

The comprehensive and detailed teachings serve to empower the use of talismanic water. Those who grasp their essentials will indeed be persons of merit. Yet one must not dismiss these as mere commonplace sayings, for everything hinges on whether the heart is unified or divided.

As for the use of Sanskrit in solar and lunar incantations, this arose through long transmission in later ages. The supreme scriptures contain no Sanskrit; earlier masters have already debated this. In recent times, practitioners of the *Lingbao* tradition seek to establish their own school and refuse to align their teachings with the *Zhengyi* registers. Thus, they omit discussions of the Three Lights from the *Lingbao* texts, disdaining any resemblance to *Tianxin* thunder rites—yet how can the *Lingbao* tradition truly abandon the Three Lights?

The vault of heaven is not low, nor are the stars’ brilliance distant. Yet humanity dwells between them in solitude. By outward conditions, obtaining their *qi* seems difficult; by principle, however, it remains attainable, for all things possess it.

The conch and clam absorb the moon’s essence over time, until their shells glow with luminous clarity, producing pearls of radiance. The rhinoceros gazes upon the stars and moon, and eventually, halos form within its twin horns, taking the shape of stars or the moon. These creatures, though devoid of intellect, still receive the essence of the Three Dawns. Did they employ incantations, seals, or directional alignments? No—their hearts are free of thought and distraction, undisturbed and unadulterated. They see the moon and absorb the moon; they behold the stars and face the stars, single-minded and undivided. Thus, what is high and distant becomes near. How then can humans, the most spiritually endowed of beings, fall short of these creatures?

The trouble lies in humanity’s spirit being submerged amid worldly affairs, its intelligence flowing into schemes and stratagems. Even those who study the Dao often favor the strange and marvelous, their minds growing ever more scattered, their karmic responses ever more distant. This stems from exerting effort on the periphery while neglecting the root, failing to concentrate on the essential, and becoming mired in techniques. Without guidance from a true master, their labor spans eons in vain.

Visualization and invocation are not without purpose, but one must first settle the mind and stabilize the spirit. Focus the heart on the radiance of the Three Dawns, concentrate the will in a single thought of sincerity, and strive for resonance and communion—all while remaining unwavering and unyielding.

A survey of various methods for absorbing and refining *qi* reveals that most are compiled in this present work, all suitable for practice. However, calculations of orientation, measurements of *qi*-pulses, and similar details are not included here. If a method can yield verification, why fear its complexity? This is not an attempt to distinguish *Tianxin* practices but rather to acknowledge that the *Lingbao* teachings encompass the highest Dao. The preceding methods are appropriate for application, and thus should not be casually adopted from lesser sources.

The eighteenth fascicle of the *Lingbao Sutra* from Tiantai, titled *Methods for Latitudinal Cultivation*, details the practice of visualizing and communing with the Dipper, claiming the power to alter the registers of death. It instructs the construction of a bamboo frame, suspending a mirror to form the Dipper’s shape, stepping the Dipper’s pattern while lighting lamps, and using seven feet of crimson silk inscribed with the Dipper’s secret names, tied beneath the forehead and knotted at the back of the head. Wielding a sword, one sprays water and strikes a bowl forty-nine times, absorbing the *qi* of the Dipper’s stars, aiming to perceive the Dipper and River stars to attain immortality. Additionally, on the three seventh-day periods of each month at the *Hai* hour, one enters a chamber, places an incense burner atop the head in the manner of *lianding* refinement, visualizes the smoke ascending to pay homage to the Dipper, and then proceeds to the practice of exiting the spirit to commune with the primordial.

These methods resemble sorcery and assume the guise of shamans. Moreover, in the pursuit of immortality, propriety and ritual come first. The *Lingbao* tradition is the teaching of the Filial Piety Bright King, with filial devotion and fraternal respect as its core. Loyalty, integrity, filial piety, and reverence can move heaven and earth, stirring the spirits. As for abiding in the world, preserving form, prolonging life, and averting death—these require inner refinement and outer merit. When one’s time aligns with the ruler’s, one may bring great benefit to the world, eliminate great harm, extend vast kindness to all beings, and bestow blessings upon the four directions.

Before mastering the winds and clouds, one must withdraw one’s light and conceal one’s traces, guarding the body and retreating into seclusion. To the utmost of one’s strength, one ought to accumulate merit and establish virtue, aiding beings as the heart inclines and benefiting others according to circumstance—dispensing medicine and talismans, dispelling evil and rescuing from distress, returning to the Dao of utmost truth, and following a teacher of pure correctness. Thus may one’s luminous virtue reach august Heaven, and one’s name be heard in the Jade Palace. At such a time, the register of death may be erased, and the record of life inscribed.

Yet now, one teaches others the demeanor of sorcery and shamans, performing unorthodox nighttime curses and supplications. These practices neither conform to the standards of fasting and altar rites nor adhere to the protocols of memorials and morning devotions. To presume that such means could erase the register of death and inscribe one’s name above is the height of folly.

Looking up to the true teaching of the August Void Emperor, we find the tradition of simplicity and purity, which has not abandoned the ancient models. Thus, we broadly seek among the capped and gowned. Once admitted into the canonical disciplines, one dons the star-crowned cap and feathered robes, holds the tablet and unfurls the altar, enters the oratory to burn incense, and faces the primordial to present matters—like paying reverent homage to one’s lord and father, like standing before the awe-inspiring might of Heaven. Advancing and retreating follow proper form; morning devotions adhere to method. Composed and unhurried, one stabilizes the qi and concentrates the spirit, communing with the true and numinous in the midst of the indistinct, and directing a single thought to the Great Void above.

When concluding one’s words, one must first pray for the myriad years of the lord of the state, then petition for the ascension of the nine generations of ancestors. Only with filial piety and loyalty, upholding propriety and ritual, does one grasp the foundation of the canonical teachings.

The gateway of the Great Dao is utterly upright and free from deviation—how could it ever involve wrapping the head in red silk or wielding blades and chopping implements? To call such things "communing with the Dipper" is to mislead others most grievously.

Yet it takes the sixteen characters of the sun’s essence—Ziwen, Zhong, Rihun, and Zhu Jing—and the twenty-four characters of the moon’s spirit—Yuepo and Aimei Xiao—along with the names of the Dipper stars from Kuí to Piāo, compelling practitioners to invoke their images and summon their qi, then incorporates these into the forty-first section, "Praying for Favor and Atoning for Transgressions," styling it as the "Dao of the Three Luminous Realms of Lingbao" and calling it the "True Qi of the Three Realms."

Having neither examined their origins nor sought to avoid the established names of the Three Lights and Three Mornings, they instead claim uniqueness, renaming the qi of the sun, moon, and stars as the "True Qi of the Three Realms"—how can this be justified? In its eighteenth section, following the Dipper rites, it further introduces a method for "Morning Audience with the Origin," wherein one visualizes the spirits in a manner akin to the protocol of memorial petitions—this ought not be conflated with the Dipper rites.

Moreover, it records talismans for ascending through the fierce winds, the completion of the "Morning Audience with the Three Heavens," the establishment of celestial bureaus, the erection of oratories under exalted names, and daily assemblies of the immortal ministries within the oratory to dispatch spirits for administrative duties—all of it wildly fantastical. Its account of the "Chart of Western Tortoise Mountain" merely recapitulates the generative principles of source, warp, and flow found in the scriptural canons, yet in its delusion, it strays far from the original source.

From the practices of spirit visualization and Dipper rites onward, the text falsely designates its methods as the "Seven Scriptures of Lingbao"—this is incorrect. The seven scriptures and eight wefts of the original canon have already been systematically arranged according to the old format and incorporated into the present work as the sixth section. Scholars ought to examine these matters with equanimity, whereby right and wrong will naturally become distinct. One must not allow such extraneous doctrines to adulterate this book, so that it may truly serve as a reliable guide, as the ancients intended.

**Section on the Correct Perception of the Five Phases** □□□□□□□

**Ingestion of the Dipper Star Names**
For this method, write in cinnabar on yellow silk. Blend with yellow wax to form seven pellets, taking one each day, swallowed with pure water after purifying the mind. After forty-nine days, the eye of wisdom will brighten, enabling the recitation of ten thousand words without faltering or losing focus. □□□□□□.

**Six-Character Healing Method**
For this method, write in cinnabar on yellow paper to cure all illnesses. □□□□□□.

**Internal Infusion of the Six Ding Method**
For this method, at noon on the sixth day, write in cinnabar on yellow paper, forming each pair of characters into one talisman—six characters making three talismans. On the seventh day before dawn, upon waking, take the first two characters and swallow them with pure water. Wait and listen; when the first sound of a person is heard, inhale the qi and swallow it. Repeat this for the middle and lower sets over the next seven days. This is called the *Internal Infusion of the Six Ding*. After a full month of practice, whenever encountering malevolent spirits causing confusion, silently recite once, close the eyes for a long moment, and the Six Ding will report to the heart-spirit. Whatever emerges in the mind will reveal the cause of the ghost’s mischief, including the color of its garments and the number of its followers—all will be verified. These are the names of the Six Ding. □□□□□□.

The *Method of Dispatching Malevolence with the Six Jia*

This method is used when minor or nascent malevolent spirits commit transgressions. Write the talismans in cinnabar ink, burn them together with gold coins in fire, and the malevolence will immediately be expelled by the Six Generals into the sea, with strange omens appearing in dreams. These are the names of the Six Jia: □, □, □, □, □, □, □, □.

**The Talismanic Method for Treating Poison**

This method is applied when one is harmed by poisonous creatures, suffers from abscesses, swelling, cinnabar tumors, or ailments of the five viscera and six bowels. Write the talisman on the afflicted area, either swallowing it or applying it externally. No more than three characters are needed before recovery is achieved.

When the Great Ultimate first divided, the One gave rise to the Two, the Two gave rise to the Three, and the Three gave rise to the myriad things. Once the myriad things were established, the Five Qi came into being, originating from the Void and Nothingness. Thus, the Five Elderly Lords of the Dao became the root and origin of the Five Qi, manifesting within the celestial patterns. The Five Stars became the constant luminaries above, while on earth, the Five Peaks stabilized the realm. Among things, Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth formed the Five Phases. In humans, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys constituted the body. In affairs, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust founded states and households.

The forty-nine secret talismanic characters align with the transformations of the Five Phases. When ingested by oneself, they purify the spirit and refine the qi. When applied to others, they dispel illness and expel malevolence. This is akin to summoning water with a *fangzhu* mirror or drawing fire through a yang tunnel—an art of inner resonance and outer response.

If one lacks inner authenticity yet seeks outer responses, or disrupts the Five Phases while desiring the fullness of the Five Qi, the attainment of karmic retribution will be difficult.

In the *Lingbao Methods of Tiantai*, the Five Phases’ true qi of the Jade Tablets is classified as a single category, with the forty-nine characters incorporated into other scrolls. However, the *Incantation for Upholding the Body with the Five Peaks* and methods such as *Shifting Scenery and Penetrating Light* are interspersed among them, obscuring the original text of the Five Phases. Thus, this work adheres strictly to the ancient method without daring to alter it.

*Concluding the Sixth Scroll of the Great Methods of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure*
*Beginning the Seventh Scroll of the Great Methods of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure*

The *Dongxuan Lingbao* Master of the Southern Bureau, Keeper of the Law Canon, Right Assistant of the Golden Harmony Bureau, Quan Tongchu Fu, compiles:

**The Five Sprouts of Internal Refinement**

The Five Sprouts are the Five Qi. In heaven, they are the Five Elder Thearchs; in the scriptures, qi congeals into script, forming the Five Sprouts’ true writ. Across the five directions, they are the Five Constants: the Eastern Azure Thearch, Spirit Awe-Inspiring; the Southern Vermilion Thearch, Blazing Might; the Western White Thearch, White Beckoning Rule; the Northern Black Thearch, Timely Radiance; and the Central Yellow Thearch, Containing the Pivot. In celestial patterns, they are the Five Stars; in terrestrial geography, the Five Peaks; in affairs, the Five Constants; in things, the Five Phases; and in the human body, the Five Viscera.

To cultivate the Dao of the Numinous Treasure and the methods of the Grotto Chamber, one ingests the life-generating qi of the Five Directions’ true perfection to refine the mortal frame.

**The Method of the Five Sprouts**

Invoke the descent of the Five Thearchs and Five Lads into the body, and wear the true writ, so their spirits reside within the Five Viscera to summon the essence of the Five Sprouts. This is practiced according to the four tones.

Regularly, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Azure Thearch of the Five Directions—the Five Thearchs—with the Azure Thearch governing spring and presiding over the life-generating qi of the east. He is nine inches tall, crowned with a green jade coronet, clad in a nine-qi azure feathered robe, riding a chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing a banner of plumes, followed by the nine myriad officers of *Jiayi* and the Elder of Hu. Suddenly, he transforms, generating azure qi like clouds that envelop and cover your body, entering through your mouth and descending directly into the liver palace. Further visualize Jupiter gleaming brightly in the east, illuminating your body. Then open your eyes, recite the incantation nine times, and swallow the twelve characters of the Eastern True Writ.

**Incantation:**
*"Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, primordial essence of the Highest Origin.
August Elder, Venerable Spirit, clad in feathered azure.
Commanding the celestial officers, radiant and majestic star.
Scattering brilliance, flowing fragrance, refining and nourishing my form.
Feasting on morning mist, ingesting the essence of wood.
Firmly nurturing the Azure Sprout, preserving and guarding decrepit years.
Viscera brimming, jade mushrooms spontaneously grow.
Prolonging life for eons, countenance returning to youthful infancy.
Five Qi harmoniously merging, heaven and earth in solemn union."*

**The Twelve Characters of the Eastern True Writ**

Regularly, on the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize the Vermilion Thearch of the south, who governs summer and presides over the life-generating qi of the south. The subsequent procedure is the same as before. He is three inches tall, crowned with a red jade coronet, clad in a three-qi vermilion feathered robe, riding a chariot of cinnabar dragons and jade, bearing a banner of rice, followed by the thirty myriad officers of *Bingding* and the Elder of Yue. Suddenly, he transforms, generating vermilion qi like clouds that envelop and cover your body, entering through your mouth and descending directly into the heart palace. Further visualize Mars gleaming brightly in the south, illuminating your body. Then open your eyes, recite the incantation three times, and swallow the twelve characters of the Southern True Writ.

**Incantation:**

Visualize the Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, the numinous youths of the Vermilion Palace. The Primordial Thearch, riding a tripartite chariot of crimson dragons. Crimson feathered robes take flight, brocade stoles radiant with light. Commanding the numinous officers, they govern the Dao of yin and yang. The Three Qi emit their brilliance, irrigating my Crimson Palace. The Red Child safeguards and stabilizes, refining the sprout and adorning the countenance. At dawn, consume the vermilion radiance, jade mushrooms filling and suffusing. Reversing the flow of kalpas, decrepit bones and youth alike. Longevity spans heaven and earth, eternally enjoyed without end. The body generates water and fire, transforming in a hundred directions.

**The Twelve Characters of the Southern True Writ**

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, enter the chamber, face west, and bow seven times. Sit upright, click the teeth seven times, and visualize the White Thearch governing as before. He is seven inches tall, crowned with a white jade coronet, clad in a white feathered robe. Riding a chariot of white dragons and jade, bearing a plain banner, followed by the seventy myriad officers of *Gengxin* and the Elder of Mystery. Suddenly, he transforms, generating white qi like clouds that swiftly envelop and cover your body, entering through your mouth and descending directly into the lung palace. Further visualize Venus gleaming brightly in the west, illuminating your body. Then open your eyes, recite the incantation seven times, and swallow the twelve characters of the Western True Writ.

**Incantation:**
The Seven Gates of Golden Clouds, vast and luminous in the Western Splendor. Within resides the Pale Sovereign, the abode of the Primordial Thearch. Riding a tripartite chariot of white dragons, the Seven Qi towering. Lingering at the Jade Gate, scattering essence like crimson auroras. Venus emits its brilliance, fragrant mushrooms abundant. The mysterious profundity nurtures my body, cultivating my pale sprout. Bright stones gleam freshly, enduring through ten thousand kalpas. Sustained by flowing springs, nourished by Grand Harmony. The Nine Heavens’ Thearch bestows jade splendor. Preserving the years, halting the whitening, complexion and radiance flourish. Abiding with heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries share eternity.

**The Twelve Characters of the Western True Writ**

At the hour of the cock’s crow on the day of the Beginning of Winter, enter the chamber, face north, and bow five times. Strike the teeth five times, and visualize the Black Thearch, five inches in height, crowned with a dark jade coronet, clad in a robe of kingfisher feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by black dragons, with a black banner borne before him, accompanied by five hundred thousand officials of the *ren* and *gui* cycles and the Qiang and Lao spirits descending. In an instant, the generative *qi* transforms and billows like clouds, resembling the light of shooting stars, enveloping one’s body and entering directly into the Palace of the Kidneys. Then visualize the Water Star gleaming brightly in the north, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation five times, and swallow the Twelve Characters of the Northern True Writ. The incantation reads:

The Northern Mysterious Heavens, the Five *Qi* scatter numinous radiance.
Above resides the Great Spirit, the Primordial Elder of Original Essence.
Riding dragons, bearing banners, they roam and feast in the Upper Capital.
This is called Primordial Auspiciousness, felicitous clouds spread their glory.
Flying mushrooms stream forth, abundant and overflowing in all four directions.
Jade maidens of mysterious profundity bathe my form.
The Palace of the Kidneys is filled and stabilized, withered sprouts grow firm.
The Five Palaces receive the true, ascending to commune with the divine.
The Five Elders descend to welcome, the Dao of immortality is swiftly attained.
Transforming water and fire, clad in robes of kingfisher feathers.
Soaring through the Great Void, roaming to the Purple Court.
Lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

The Twelve Characters of the Northern True Writ.

On the days of the equinoxes and solstices, enter the chamber, face the five directions, and bow twelve times. Strike the teeth twelve times, and visualize the Yellow Thearch, one foot and two inches in height, crowned with a yellow jade coronet, clad in a robe of five-colored feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by yellow dragons, with a yellow banner borne before him, accompanied by one hundred twenty thousand officials of the *wu* and *ji* cycles and the Cang and Lao spirits descending. In an instant, the generative *qi* transforms into yellow clouds, enveloping one’s body and entering directly into the Palace of the Spleen. Then visualize the Earth Star at the center, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation twelve times, and swallow the Sixteen Characters of the Central True Writ. The incantation reads:

The Central Great Mountain, the Primordial *Qi* lingers and circles.
Above resides the Primordial Elder, governing the Four Numinous Ones.
Riding yellow dragons, clad in robes of five-colored feathers.
Revolving through the Nine Heavens, turning the jade pivot.
Radiant as the Seven Stars, streaming light scatters its brilliance.
Jade blossoms and fragrant mushrooms flow and soar in abundance.
Bathing my body, the Palace of the Lungs shines forth.
Nurturing the sprout, consuming essence, the myriad spirits all return.
Restraining the *hun* and controlling the *po*, refining the Eight Powers.
Within and without, all is pure and luminous, ever-living and undecaying.
Communing with the true and attaining the numinous, ascending into the Great Subtlety.

The Sixteen Characters of the Central True Writ.

After reciting the incantations, draw in *qi* according to the number of each direction, swallow the saliva, and ingest the True Writ.

**Method for Regular Ingestion**
At the hour of the cock’s crow, when the yang light first appears, face east, strike the teeth according to the number of each direction, rub the palms together until warm, and with the hands, wipe the face and eyes the corresponding number of times. Recite the incantation, beginning from the east and circling once. For the Eastern Blue Sprout, consume the blue sprout and drink the morning blossom. Then, with the tongue, stroke the inner side of the upper teeth, beneath the tongue, and the lips three times. Rinse the mouth until the Jade Spring fills it, then swallow nine times. Draw in the blue *qi* nine times, allowing it to settle in the liver.

For the Southern Vermilion Elixir, consume the vermilion elixir and drink from the Vermilion Pool. Then, with the tongue, stroke the inner side of the lower teeth, lick the tongue, and the lips three times. Rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills it, then swallow three times. Draw in the red *qi* three times, allowing it to settle in the heart.

For the Central *Wu* and *Ji*, the towering Great Mountain, consume the essence-*qi* and drink the Sweet Spring. Then, with the tongue, stroke the inner and outer sides of the upper and lower teeth, lick the tongue, and the lips. Rinse the mouth until the Jade Spring fills it, then swallow. Draw in the yellow *qi* twelve times, allowing it to settle in the spleen.

For the Western Bright Stone, consume the bright stone and drink the Numinous Liquid. Then, with the tongue, stroke the outer side of the upper teeth, lick the tongue, and the lips. Rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills it, then swallow seven times. Draw in the white *qi* seven times, allowing it to settle in the lungs.

For the Northern Mysterious Nourishment, consume the mysterious nourishment and drink the Jade Syrup. Then, with the tongue, stroke the inner side of the lower teeth, lick the tongue, and the lips three times. Rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills it, then swallow. Draw in the black *qi* five times, allowing it to settle in the kidneys.

After completing this, strike the teeth thirty-six times and swallow *qi* thirty-five times. Then recite the general incantation:

White stones towering, flowing springs welling forth,
Caverns like jade nectar—drinking it grants long life,
Extending lifespan.

Recite the incantation’s blossom, with the tongue stroke the upper, lower, and center, allowing the Jade Mushroom to fill the mouth, then swallow three times. Draw in *qi* twenty-five times, guide the *qi* and swallow it. With this, the method is complete.

I have often observed that the Dao of the Numinous Treasure lay hidden at the beginning of the vast primordial chaos, originating in the initial darkness of the cosmic abyss. Its profound mysteries are unfathomable, its wonders beyond measure. From the Middle Antiquity onward, teachings were established and texts bequeathed. Within the orthodox scriptures, myriad methods are fully expounded, yet their efficacy and manifestation depend on the practitioner’s personal attainment.

The method of the Five Sprouts gathers the generative *qi* of the five directions to refine the essence of the five viscera. The *qi* is subtle and elusive, not easily obtained. Thus, one ingests the True Writ to summon it, for *qi* coalesces into script, drawing one to the other. Establishing altars, setting up offerings, bowing with memorials, transcribing petitions, spreading *qi*, inscribing talismans, dispelling demons, and repelling delusions—these are the foremost practices. Refining and removing the yin obscurities, dissolving yin to nurture yang, aligning with the radiance of the Three Mornings.

As for the five viscera within the human body, they are but impure substances. Methods such as visualizing the liver emitting blue *qi* or the lungs emitting white *qi* belong to the practice of visualization and refinement, not to the Five Sprouts. Drawing in the generative *qi* of the eastern direction, ladling the morning blossom of the Wood Palace, infusing it throughout the body, and refining the liver and viscera—this is the meaning of the Five Sprouts. Refining the five *qi* of the five directions to cultivate the five spirits of the five viscera, if practiced long without cessation, how could one not realize their reality?

With prolonged refinement, the *qi* of the person merges with the *qi* of heaven, the spirit of the person unites with the spirit of the Dao—this is also the way of refining the spirit.

Here now is the translation of the *Five Sprouts True Writ*, all of which is secretly contained in the Supreme Scriptures, differing from common techniques. If scholars deeply penetrate its purport, they may activate and practice it. The forty-first section of the Tiantai method, "Praying for Favor and Atoning for Transgressions," expounds upon this, stating: The *Lingbao* possesses the Crimson Writ of Ancestral *Qi*, the numinous treasure of heaven. When it enters the human body, it generates the five-colored numinous mushrooms. This is explained as follows: the eastern blue sprout is the liver, the southern vermilion cinnabar is the heart, the western bright stone is the lungs, the northern mysterious essence is the kidneys, and the central *wu-ji* is the spleen. Curling the tongue to gather saliva, one swallows it according to the directions, regarding the head as Mount Tai. Concluding with the twelve hours of swallowing *qi*, this is called the method of "exchanging bones and transforming form." Yet it contains no invocations, nor any true writ, merely appropriating the meaning of the Five Sprouts and diverting its explanation to another path. It claims that swallowing saliva and *qi*, with fire responding to water and their convergence, forms a diagram of "child and mother, husband and wife," borrowing fragmentary theories from alchemical texts without completeness. While it names itself the numinous treasure of heaven, it directly identifies the Five Sprouts as the five viscera—such explanations are entirely unfit to serve as a method.

In the "Three Palaces Recitation Section" of the *Upper Chapters on Salvation*, radiant brilliance rises, dispelling heavenly calamities above and averting earthly disasters below, externally aiding all beings and internally refining the hundred spirits. The gateway to practice begins with single-minded devotion. The method of recitation focuses on visualizing the luxuriant *qi* and gathering the myriad spirits in their vast array. Thus, one may inwardly refine the body and outwardly permeate all things. If words do not leave the mouth and the ears do not hear sound, it is called "silent recitation." From beginning to end, one maintains visualization, adhering to the ancient method. Entering the oratory, burning incense, settling the mind, and calming the *qi*, one withdraws the light to gaze inward. Ten thousand thoughts do not intrude; sitting upright without leaning or slouching, one ensures the path of the ox-cart remains unobstructed and the *qi* of the dragon and tiger flows ceaselessly. Only then does one recite the scripture, adjusting the gravity of the matter and the internal or external application—whether reciting with spirit, heart, *qi*, or mouth—these correspond to the upper, middle, and lower *dantian*. Beyond this, there is "intent recitation," each with its own purpose: to deliver others from distress and dispel misfortune, to pray for favor or atone for transgressions for oneself, or to harmonize *qi* and time to preserve fortune. For emperors praying for rain or clear skies, aiding the times and rescuing beings, promoting the stagnant and dull, universally delivering the departed souls—whenever matters are urgent, one must enter the chamber, silently recite the divine writ, then proceed with the proper sequence of visualizations in the ritual and offerings. The details are fully set forth in the section on "Recitation, Visualization, and Maintenance." All must conform to the method. The first recitation covers the preface; the second begins with the scripture itself. Ten recitations constitute one cycle. Upon completion, one submits to the officials, the hundred spirits guard their positions, and one secretly presents sincere entreaties, ascending the spirit from the dwelling. This pertains to the fourth weft.

In the *Lingbao* sections compiled by Yunzhong, related matters have already been briefly addressed. Only in the Tiantai method is the "internal recitation" placed at the end of the fortieth section, "Delivering from Distress and Dispelling Disaster," where the deities Taiyi, Siming, Taokang, Wuying, and Baiyuan are each to inscribe the divine writ a thousand times. Another explanation divides internal recitation among the three *dantian*, yet this merely repeats the names without grasping the principle, claiming that in the first month one recites in the upper *dantian*, in the seventh month in the middle *dantian*, and in the tenth month in the lower *dantian*. It further states that the myriad spirits all recite together, leading to purification rituals and prayers where one writes on memorials, "Internally recited the *Dongjing* a thousand times," to offer to the true and dedicate to the deceased. Yet they do not know that the *Great Dongjing True Scripture* consists of thirty-nine chapters, each with two talismans, and belongs to the *Dongzhen* section. The forty chapters in the *Durenjing* method serve to explain the use of the *Durenjing*. The ancients regarded the *Durenjing* as a single scroll containing the wonders of the *Dongjing*, not equating the *Durenjing* itself with the *Dongjing* or placing it before the Celestial Thearch. To take the text of the *Durenjing* and call it the *Dongjing*—is this acceptable?

Another explanation claims it is supremely mysterious and wondrous, obtainable only after disciples exhaust their family wealth to offer to the master, leading its followers to believe it is unheard of in the world and to style themselves as "those who have attained the supreme Dao." A brief outline of its method states: visualize one’s body as withered wood, consumed by a great fire, transformed by harmonious *qi*. The perfected gather the spirit in the upper *dantian*, entering the Great Abyss Palace, pacing the Dipper in practice. There, one recites the *Dongjing* of the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral *qi*. As for refinement and deliverance, it regards only the upper *dantian* as the Celestial Thearch’s abode, the lungs as the Eastern Well, the red heaven within the head as issuing fire, the kidneys as true water, and the nine bends of their channels as the Nine Dark Regions, where the thousand souls and ten thousand spirits are all delivered and transformed. The so-called *Dongjing of the Primordial Beginning*, transmitted from other regions, merely extracts a passage from the *Durenjing* and presents it as such. The Tiantai method, kept secret and practiced in isolation, resembles the Buddhist practice of reciting Sanskrit dhāraṇīs of forty-eight lines, totaling one hundred seventy-six characters, or the mudrā of the Nine Palaces for memorializing the Celestial Thearch—all confined within the body, leading to the claim that one need not bow when paying homage to the true, for the Celestial Thearch does not depart from the mudrā of the Nine Palaces. Yet they do not know that in ancient methods, there exists a practice of not invoking the Purple Spirits, originally intended for those who sit in practice without sleeping. This does not apply to those who follow the regulations and serve the teachings. Moreover, those not yet freed from the worldly net overturn the Nine Palaces with even greater reverence than bowing.

The section on silent recitation exists in ancient methods, but to rename it "internal recitation" is incorrect. To claim that the myriad spirits recite it lacks any basis. The three *dantian* each have their own presiding deities; to divide them by the seventh, first, and tenth months is mistaken. They do not understand that recitation with the heart, *qi*, spirit, or mouth differs in principle, and visualizing the spirit and contemplating the true is not what the Tiantai method calls the "myriad spirits." In ancient methods, silent recitation involves reciting the entire scripture, which encompasses a vast array. By clarifying the spirit and refining the *qi*, one may commune with the true numina.

Should one now select merely a single passage from the scripture to serve as the basis for silent recitation, there is no need to alter its name to "Cave Scripture." Yet to abandon the main text of the original scripture and instead fabricate Sanskrit or foreign proofs is sheer delusion. According to tradition, the *Scripture of Salvation* (*Duren Jing*) originated in primordial antiquity, when the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign inscribed its text to establish the correct intonation. The four translations that entered worldly circulation were already in use by the time of Emperor Wu of Han. Only when Emperor Ming dreamed of the golden figure did the scriptures of the Śākya clan first enter China, and thus did Sanskrit come into being. To now claim that foreign sounds from the Śākya tradition constitute the ancestral *qi* texts within the *Scripture of Salvation*—even a child of three would laugh in disbelief.

In their altar rituals, practitioners sit upright in inner contemplation, claiming that within golden light the celestial script appears, often as a single character. The master admits to seeing only one character, understanding nothing of its meaning, and dares not reveal it. After the ritual, this single character is then interpreted according to the practitioner’s circumstances to divine fortune or misfortune—all derived from its strokes and dots. Though there may be dozens of such characters, the pattern remains the same. Their method begins with claims of light revealing names like Jingming, yet its absurdity and grotesquerie are evident. From silent recitation that perceives characters in luminous vision, it descends into summoning spirits to enter the altar and conduct affairs. Alas, this is the gradual descent from frost to solid ice. A single misguided thought sprouts from impropriety, and a thousand paths and ten thousand byways lead step by step into depravity. One fears that such practices will sink into the lowest depths, where no transgression is beyond reach.

Thus, the oral instructions for recitation must be guarded as secret and not lightly disclosed. Yet to conceal their mechanism entirely would risk leaving learners without a gateway, causing them to fall into the realm of false and heterodox teachings. Therefore, the profound is embedded here, awaiting the learner’s own realization.

The upper *dantian* is the Muddy Pellet, the middle *dantian* is the Crimson Palace, and the lower *dantian* is the Mysterious Pass. The methods include spirit recitation, heart recitation, and *qi* recitation. When words issue from the mouth and sounds are heard by the ear, this is vocal recitation. When the mouth utters no words and the ear hears no sound, this is silent recitation. Silent recitation encompasses differences between heart and *qi*, as well as the category of intent recitation. In all cases, one visualizes the body as the Primordial Beginning, seated upon a five-colored lion in empty space, illuminating inner and outer realms as if dwelling in the radiance of the blazing sun. Following the method in recitation, each has its governing principle: regulating the correct celestial measure, dispelling heavenly calamities, safeguarding and stabilizing the emperor, prolonging the dynasty’s prosperity, extending the years and increasing the lifespan of parents, beseeching blessings and dissolving transgressions—this is one category. Whether for others or oneself, repenting faults and praying for grace, preserving life and prolonging existence, averting disasters and transcending tribulations—this is another. Offering merit to the nine ancestors, universally aiding all souls, delivering and uplifting the shades of the netherworld, and all forms of posthumous salvation—this is yet another. Summoning, deploying, and governing actions—this is still another. Beyond these, the possibilities are too numerous to enumerate.

*Illuminating the Subtle and Obscure Grade*
This is the fifth weft among the Eight Wefts, fully recorded in the *Jade Mirror of Numinous Treasure*.

Red dim, ink black, grinding the true, sock-wax.
Numinous Treasure arises, turning solitary clerks to migration.
Can Han’s bright merit, all become precise angles.
Properly gathering souls, the merit gathers souls.

Summon the swift messengers of the eight directions, the deities of heaven and earth, and the myriad spirits to unite under the celestial mandate. First, form the Three Paths and Five Sufferings mudra, recite the incantation, and draw *qi* from the southeast to blow upon the mirror. With the brush, mark a dot at the *qian* direction, then eight dots for the eight directions.

Incantation:
Reverently invoke *Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, *Dui*, to gather and capture the lawless demonic spirits of the eight directions into my mirror to reveal their forms. Swiftly, swiftly.

Draw *qi* from the eight directions, blow upon it ten times, and together behold the sun and moon to receive and uphold it. Without expending spirit or *qi*, the forms within will be revealed.

*Shifting Scenery, Penetrating Light*
By the statutes of the Primordial Beginning and the edict of the Dao Lord, summon the Youth of Sunlight, the Youth of Moonlight, the Youth of Starlight, and the Youth of Opening Light. Mobilize the essence of the Three Luminaries and the Mysterious Dipper of sun and moon, transforming them into the Six Penetrating Divine Lights. Shining through and illuminating the ten directions of the world, myriad scenes and thousand truths shift before the sun, revealing forms to divine people and foretell the unmanifest future of objects, communicating with spirits and invoking numinous response.

Recite the incantation, draw *qi* from the Three Luminaries, and blow upon the brush or finger (using cinnabar for the brush, sesame oil for the finger) to inscribe a talisman in the hand. (Original talisman missing.) Blow *qi* again, recite the incantation, and draw *qi* to blow three times. A beam of light will appear, penetrating the seen and unseen, revealing even events yet to occur.

*Immortal Bureau’s Judgment Record from the Mysterious Treasure Mirror*
Red dim, ink black, grinding the true, sock-wax, Numinous Treasure.

First recite the incantation, inscribe the master’s heart seal in the air, and with the left hand gather it into the palm. Blow the *qi* of the five directions upon the person, then press down. Repeat three times, causing the appearance of red, yellow, and white colors.

Another incantation:

Carefully invoke the Talisman Envoy of Descending Perfection and the Spirit Summoner, commanding them to descend swiftly. Again draw *qi* from the Gate of Heaven and blow it forth, whereupon two talismans of cinnabar hue will appear in the palm—these belong to the "Talisman Methods for Approaching the Altar" section.

Another incantation:
Divine winds stir and blow,
Jade scripts resound with crystalline clarity.

Again draw *qi* from the southeast and blow it forth, whereupon the two talismans will tremble and sway.

Another incantation:
Reverently summon the Youth Who Opens the Dao of the East,
to descend with haste for me.
The five directions are invoked in like manner.

Again draw *qi* from the five directions and blow it forth, whereupon the youths of the five directions will appear. Only then may each be summoned and employed according to the method.

*Lingbao Dongxuan Illumination*
Heaven and Earth descend their *qi*,
Sun and Moon unite their forms.
Above the heavens, below the earth,
in such-and-such a place, manifest your presence.
(Draw and blow the *qi* of Heaven and Earth as per the usual method.)

**Swift Salvation of the Deceased: A Formula**
When approaching the altar to subdue demonic and wayward spirits, one must ensure that both the living and the dead receive benefit and deliverance.

First, recite the Prison-Breaking Incantation:
Most High Mysterious Origin, Supreme Lord of the Dao,
instruct your servant to wield talismans,
illuminating and shattering the dark prisons.
Let the sin-laden souls depart and be freed.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command.

(This incantation is drawn from the *Nine Heavens’ Brahma Chant Sutra*. Face the Gate of Heaven and silently recite it nine times.)

Next, summon the deceased soul, that it may swiftly depart from suffering.

First, recite the Water-Refinement Incantation:
Withered, revive; extinguished, live again.
Attain rebirth in the heavens,
once more receiving the Supreme Numen.
By the exhortations of the Nine Heavens,
return to the womb and infancy.
Defilements and burdens dissolve,
the corpse-soul revives.

(Place a vessel of water to the north, knock the teeth nine times, visualize three Jade Lads and seven Jade Maidens, swallow saliva seven times, recite the incantation seven times, and sprinkle the soul—then proceed to Fire Refinement.)

Incantation:
Radiance of sun and moon,
lingering in the Cavern of Yang.
Flowing fire enters the vessel,
refining and transforming yin’s miasma.
Corpse-filth vanishes,
all *qi* harmonizes in well-being.
Depart directly from the Five Sufferings,
ascend and soar to the celestial halls.

(Place a vessel of fire to the south, knock the teeth three times, visualize as before, exhale *qi* three times, recite the incantation nine times, and burn the True Form of Mount Fengdu to ashes.)

Incantation:
By the Primordial Talismanic Mandate,
demons are subdued and the decree fulfilled.
Protect and elevate the deceased soul,
delivering it to the Southern Palace for refinement.
The ashes of Mount Feng dissolve,
the Three Officials absolve its punishments.
Bonds are released, karma dissolved,
transformation and rebirth are granted.
According to its rank, refine and deliver it,
ascending to the courts of blessedness.

After reciting the incantation, press the tongue against the upper palate, visualize oneself as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, silently recite the hidden words once, and imagine golden light filling the mouth. With two fingers, form the Jade Clarity Mudra, blow upon the paper, and release the mudra toward the northeast. The soul will immediately ascend to the Vermilion Palace, where it will undergo refinement according to its rank and be reborn in the courts of blessedness. This is not false.

The present method adheres to the precepts and regulations of the original scriptures, arranged in accordance with ancient texts. The sections on "Expounding the Essential Principles of the Celestial Net," "Facing the Origin and Entering the Retreat," "Recitation and Visualization," "Jade Tablets and Numinous Chapters," "The Three Mornings’ Radiant Brilliance," "The Five Phases’ Upright *Qi*," "Internal Refinement of the Five Sprouts," and "Cultivation and Recitation of the Three Palaces" are all practices for the adept to cultivate, ingest, and refine, forming the foundation for summoning the true and invoking the numinous.

Once internal cultivation is sufficient, one must extend it outwardly to others, curing illnesses, dispelling evil, delivering the hidden, and aiding the manifest—this is the foremost duty in establishing merit. Yet modern practitioners, unaware of the proper framework, treat the Lingbao Great Method solely as a means of deliverance, even inventing supplementary rituals to address ailments. Little do they realize that the Lingbao tradition is the essential method of the Middle Vehicle, a direct path for aiding both the living and the dead, applicable to all matters without exception.

Moreover, the principles governing the manifest and the hidden are one, with no fundamental difference between humans and spirits. At the outset of receiving a case, one must carefully assess the circumstances and weigh the severity of the matter. If malevolent spirits or demonic entities recklessly invade the living, defying heaven and acting without principle, their crimes are unforgivable. It is fitting to report them to the Supreme Mystery, notifying the relevant authorities, and to annihilate their forms and eradicate their kind—this is not cruelty.

However, if the souls of the deceased are trapped in sorrow, harboring resentment and grievances, or if hungry ghosts and forsaken spirits, lacking descendants and support, remain lost and unable to find the path to rebirth, they may cling to the living, their yin *qi* afflicting people and causing illness. In such cases, one must first examine the patient’s physical condition and trace the root of the affliction, avoiding the reckless conjectures of charlatans and fraudulent mediums.

Thus, the methods of illumination and summoning follow, verifying the facts, investigating the names, and refusing to trust false claims. Only after thoroughly understanding the circumstances, if the soul’s plight is truly pitiable and its spirit submerged, should one adhere to the ancient rites and employ the swift salvation method for the deceased. Calm the spirit, still the mind, and silently recite the numinous scriptures, performing the deliverance as prescribed. Then burn the True Form of Mount Fengdu or issue one or two talismanic mandates for deliverance, dispatching officials, generals, soldiers, and the relevant bureaus to escort the soul according to its karma and grant it rebirth—this is the utmost in perfection.

Yet even in affluent households that establish grand meritorious works and sponsor extensive rituals, summoning and deliverance often yield little result. To expect instantaneous salvation of the deceased through a single scripture or incantation in the brief span of a ritual is indeed difficult. The establishment of a retreat and the issuance of summons to the soul cannot be undertaken lightly. First, the high priest must be well-versed in the liturgical teachings, thoroughly understanding the correct principles. Next, the memorials and petitions must not conflict with established protocols. Furthermore, the sincerity of the retreat must be unwavering, with inner and outer resolve unified. The altar must be properly erected, and the rituals flawlessly performed. Even then, the success of the deliverance depends on the deceased soul’s spiritual awareness—if it cultivated virtue in life and its transgressions were not grave, the prayers may resonate, and the soul may manifest and receive deliverance. However, if even minor obstacles arise, the response may be distant and faint.

When ghostly afflictions entangle the living, it is either because the spirit harbors unresolved resentment or lacks descendants to perform sacrifices. Once the karmic retribution is fulfilled, the underworld no longer detains it. Yet if its understanding is not profound, it may remain deluded and unaware. Wandering as a malevolent force, it drifts and stirs up mischief. At such times, the ritual master must enlighten it with reason, admonish it with the Dao, and further invoke the teachings of the Supreme Perfected Ones, supplementing them with sincere and solemn devotion. In the space between breaths, the hidden soul may attain deliverance—this is no empty claim.

The living may thus be freed from the entanglements of illness and affliction, while the dead escape the torments of prolonged suffering. If a household is not impoverished yet fails to deliver its spirits, it may not follow this method—proper rituals of reverence should be performed as prescribed.

The *Lingbao Yujian* compiled at Tiantai includes a section under the "Five Phases of Orthodox Qi," yet mingles miscellaneous incantations within it, omitting any mention of swift deliverance for the departed. Thus, the noble intent of the ancient methods is no longer discernible. Therefore, I now return to the old standards and thoroughly clarify their principles.

One must understand that the ancients treated illness and dispelled malevolence to manifest benefit for both the seen and unseen realms. This is what scholars should take to heart.

**Chapter of the Great Primordial Stability**
For seven days and seven nights, the celestial bodies—the sun, moon, and stars—along with the jade armillary sphere, halt their revolutions. Divine winds fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the heavens are free of drifting veils, and the four qi shine in clarity. Across the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees level into uniformity, no longer distinguished by height or depth. The earth transforms into azure jade, devoid of any other hue. With each inhalation and exhalation, the four directions converge, each spanning six inches. One breath carries two unities, each extending three inches.

**Chapter on the Regulation of Breath and Stabilization of Qi**

Each *zhi* spans three inches, each *zhi* encompasses fifteen *fen*. The warp and weft of heaven and earth interlace in fifteenfold symmetry—thus did the Supreme Lord bestow the *Yellow River Chart* upon the Yellow Emperor.

Enter the chamber and sit in equanimity. With the hand, examine the pulse: four beats constitute one breath. Measure the practitioner’s ordinary inhalation and exhalation, gradually increasing the duration without undue strain. The breath should issue gently from the mouth, inaudible even to the ears. Once the breath is even, resume as before, accumulating effort over time. When qi settles and breath stabilizes, direct attention to the tip of the nose—three breaths for the nose, two for the cheeks, four for the brows. Then exhale subtly to complete one cycle. Continue the practice, accumulating to eighty-one cycles. After forty-nine days, incrementally extend each cycle, from one *shi* to a full day, and from one day to seven.

Thereafter, align the ears with the shoulders and the nose with the navel, gathering the six senses. Focus the mind upon the eyes. Initially, perception lies neither within nor without; observe the divine radiance. After three days, within the secluded chamber, a single point of spiritual light appears—steadfastly fix the spirit upon it. After four days, the light gradually brightens and expands. By the seventh day, the chamber is filled with divine radiance, and within this stability, all phenomena appear as yet unmanifest. After forty-nine days, within this stabilized state, all true spirits and spectral beings become visible—only then does one enter the Dao of penetrating vision and unobstructed sight.

I humbly submit that the *Scripture of Salvation* encompasses ten thousand methods. The *Great Primordial Stability* is the pivotal mechanism of these practices, the direct path of the Dao. It begins with stabilizing qi and preserving spirit, ultimately leading to the audience with the Primordial at the Gate of Heaven. Beyond this lies the ultimate realm of the Dao, beyond all conjecture.

For seven days and seven nights, the celestial bodies—the sun, moon, and stars—along with the jade armillary sphere, halt their revolutions. This describes the moment when the Primordial spoke the scriptures, an event in the heavens. Xue Youqi’s annotations briefly explicate its meaning. Applied to the human body: the sun and moon suspend their movement, the eyes do not blink; the divine winds fall silent, breath ceases to enter or exit; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, qi no longer ascends or descends. Only then can one inwardly concentrate the spirit, the mind becoming profoundly still. Through the cultivation of stability, the spirit emerges, ascending to the upper realms, penetrating the myriad phenomena, and perceiving the ten directions—this method has already been detailed above.

The *Twenty-Five Chapters on the Great Stability of Divine Radiance* compiled by the Tiantai school claims that the jade armillary sphere’s pulse does not cease—this is a grave error. In the great practice of stability, the eyes must not blink, breath must not enter or exit, qi must not ascend or descend. Only then can the spirit depart, yet how could the pulse remain unmoved? The body would be as if dead, not the emergence of spirit.

It further states that the Heavenly Worthy floats in emptiness, with the original spirit residing in the Jade Pure Palace; that though the Heavenly Worthy is distant and wondrous, one may speak of it as dwelling in the Nine Palaces; that one already possesses the Heavenly Worthy within, and need not gaze upward to heaven—all such assertions are incorrect. It also claims that through wondrous transformation, a lion is formed, upon which the Heavenly Worthy descends into the cinnabar field, with green on the left, white on the right, red in front, black behind, and yellow at the center, hence the five colors. Yet it asserts that what is seen in seven days and seven nights are merely future events. Such a view fails to grasp that the emergence of spirit and penetrating vision lead to shedding the mortal form and ascending to the mysterious—how could the Heavenly Worthy of the five qi within the body be confined to the mud-pill palace alone?

To perceive the ten directions, to traverse the hidden and attain the wondrous, to behold the vastness of high heaven and deep earth, to witness the myriad sages and thousand perfected—all may be clearly seen, and one may wander with the Creator. Yet to claim that all one sees are future events—how narrow and shallow!

Later scholars seeking the ladder of practice and application must begin with the cultivation of stability.

**Chapter on Penetrating Vision of the Hundred Spirits**
Commence the practice of stability on the day of one’s life-star. After seven days, when the power of stability is established, only then proceed to penetrating vision. If the power of stability is not yet achieved, do not attempt it. Once breath is stabilized and spirit may emerge, the gaze extends ten thousand *li* beyond, no longer heeding objects before the eyes. After another seven days, visions gradually become clearer, though still indistinct. After a hundred days, success is attained: seated, one surveys the Three Realms and perceives the Ten Heavens.

It is also said that reciting and chanting the wondrous scriptures may qualify one as a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. The *Purple Salvation’s Inner Vision of the Central Realm of Luminous Flame* states: “Always desire to lie down with eyes closed, the body at ease, the breath subtle, as if in slumber, so that others remain unaware. Then inwardly gaze and listen afar to the four directions, extending the ears and eyes beyond ten thousand *li*. With prolonged practice, one may naturally perceive events ten thousand *li* away. With focused intent, one may see matters a hundred million *li* beyond. The ears may constantly hear the sounds of gold and jade, the music of strings and bamboo—this is the wondrous method.”

The “four directions” are a general reference. One should first arise in one direction, inwardly directing vision and hearing. Initially, there may be no semblance of perception, but with prolonged sincerity, one naturally enters the wondrous.

Upon examining ancient texts, I find that only after cultivating stability and emerging the spirit may one practice the Dao of penetrating vision. Yet regulating the breath is easily understood but difficult to master. It begins with one breath comprising four *zhi*, and over time, one breath may encompass eight *zhi*. With unceasing accumulation of effort, one may extend this to one *shi*. From one *shi*, it may extend to a full day, and from one day, seven days may be attained. Thereupon, gather the spirit as if in one’s own form, standing upright within the mud-pill palace, inwardly and outwardly serene, without the slightest attachment. Ascend directly through the crown of the head, sensing a body born outside the body, distinctly separate. The spirit departs the physical frame like a cicada shedding its husk, soaring through the vast emptiness, riding the qi to the celestial vault. One may pay homage to the constellations upon the celestial steps, present oneself before the Primordial at the Gate of Heaven, meet the assembled perfected, and ascend with the myriad qi—ultimately beholding the sacred realm of the Jade Pure. This is the wondrous subtlety of emerging the spirit, through which one may commune with the true and perceive the numinous.

Scholars who encounter enlightened teachers and, through cultivation and preservation, attain the realm of penetrating vision should advance further, never retreating or faltering.

**Chapter on Gathering and Refining the Ancestral Qi**

The phoenix curves its head to touch the crown, essence and breath concealed within. The dragon raises its head to strike the nose, its qi ascending upward. The tortoise retracts its head to contain its breath, essence and qi descending below. The serpent coils its body without straightening, primordial qi circulating throughout. The crane seals its breath with subtle respiration, essence returning to the cinnabar palace.

Reverently contemplating the Primordial Ancestral Qi—formless and nameless, at the dawn of kalpas, beyond all resemblance—once the Mysterious Net was established, the Two Images took shape. Heaven received this qi to become heaven, earth received this qi to become earth, and humans received this qi to become human. Even the moving and rooted beings, though humble in nature and form, are none other than transformations born of the Ancestral Qi.

Yet humans, though born from a portion of this qi, inevitably die when they lose it. Is this not because passions and desires muddle within, while power and profit enslave without? Unaware of their root source, failing to penetrate the true principle, their spirit grows dim and their qi dissipates. Unmindful of the great limit approaching, they ultimately fall into confusion and desolation, becoming mere shades below.

Now, by gathering and refining the Ancestral Qi, one may congeal the sacred embryo within the body. Once the sacred embryo is complete, a body is born outside the body. This passage broadly outlines the method of gathering and refining the Ancestral Qi within the body. Ancient texts record its name, but the oral instructions and techniques have not been transmitted—one cannot speculate or fabricate explanations.

The pulse reflects the heart’s color, forming the nine cauldrons within the body. Externally, it aligns with the nine hues, resonating above with the Great Brahmā, harmonizing with the hexagrams’ *qi*, and uniting with the Great Yang—hence some regard it as the Mother *Kūn*. The east inverts the nine days, guiding the two lines of *Qián*, revealing its mechanism. Yet when paired with hexagrams and the *jiǎzǐ* cycle in cryptic language, ancient texts call it the *Dòngyáng Fúhuǒ Kāi Tú* ("Chart of the Cavern-Yang Talisman Fire Unfolding"), though its oral instructions remain untransmitted, leaving its principles obscure and its forced interpretations untenable.

This text, a single scroll from the *Zhōng Dòng* ("Central Cavern"), contains a middle chapter that serves as its core. Its profundities are unfathomable, defying rational analysis. After the Great Tang, scholars attempted annotations, yet its depths remained elusive. For instance, the middle chapter assigns the sixty-four hexagrams, with *Qián* and *Kūn* appearing in the "Mother *Kūn* inverting east" and "nine days guiding *Qián*." But the remaining sixty-two hexagrams lack clear justification, rendering the logic inconsistent. Originally, the text was merely titled *Dòngyáng Fúhuǒ Kāi Tú*, its full import known only to perfected beings. What we *can* discern is that the middle chapter originates from before heaven and earth, distinct from later works. The *Yì*’s essence lies in its boundless transformation, its hexagrams’ *qi* and numbers intricately woven into creation. Though Fúxī drew the hexagrams *after* heaven and earth divided, their principles existed *before* the lines were formed. As Shào Yōng observed: *"Who believes the* Yì *existed before the first stroke?"*—a profound insight yet to be fully grasped.

The sixty-four hexagrams and the sixty-four lines of the middle chapter both trace back to primordial times. Some hexagrams may derive from the chapter, or the two may be interdependent—plausible claims. But rigidly pairing each hexagram with a line defies logic, and assigning them to the sixty *jiǎzǐ* cycles compounds the confusion. Ancient methods outlined the framework, but without transmitted instructions, their practical use remains unseen.

As for the nine *qi* cauldrons, their meanings are vaguely understood, yet their secrets remain concealed, awaiting the destined era for revelation. The Tiāntái tradition later reorganized the middle chapter into thirty-three sections, renaming it *Xuánzhēn Yǐnhuì* ("Mysterious True Hidden Secrets"). It placed *Zhūn* at the head of *jiǎzǐ*, forcing an interpretation. Instead of admitting the instructions were lost, it fabricated explanations for the hexagram pairings, then appended thirty-two practices for "absorbing the *qi* of the thirty-two heavens" as breathwork. Yet among these heavens, four reside in the *Zhòngmín* world, four in the formless realm, eighteen in the form realm, and six in the desire realm. Attempting to align them with the twenty-eight lunar lodges’ *gāng* to guide *qi* is futile—like chasing the void, where effort yields only remoteness. Their *Xuánzhēn Yǐnhuì* claims descent from the *Shàng Jīng* ("Upper Scripture"), yet relabels the *Yùyīn Shèqì Zhòu* ("Jade Tone *Qi*-Gathering Spell"), rearranging its order and swapping east for west—what logic justifies this?

**The Five *Qi* Convergence Section:**
The *Shàngqīng Huáfáng* ("Upper Clarity’s Radiant Chamber") is where the Great One abides, its form natural, like an unopened lotus. In the human body, the lotus chamber is the heart. The "eightfold darkness merging" refers to the eight *mài* (vessels) within the body’s eight obscurities, all converging in the heart. The "subtle midst" signifies that all things contain a microcosm linked to the primordial *qi* of the Great Dao—like the veins of a plantain, the body has blood vessels and meridians. Within the five *qi*, the hundred spirits intermingle. This is the path of the *Dàdòng Huífēng Hùnhé* ("Great Cavern’s Cyclic Wind Convergence"), found in the *Shàngqīng Jīn Jīng* ("Upper Clarity’s Scripture of Prohibitions"). Mastering it grants immortality; practicing it makes one a true immortal.

**Ode by the Perfected One of the Mysterious Center:**
*"The Jade Clarity’s celestial bridge seals the numinous pass,*
*In the emerald chamber, time stretches in tranquil ease.*
*Divine winds stir the mist, the five* qi *settle,*
*The Jade Tone gathers* qi *in the three cinnabar fields."*

**Another Ode:**
*"A single spirit soars to the Dipper’s terrace,*
*Wind and fire cycle back to revere the bones.*
*If not for enduring the kalpa’s moment,*
*Wait till the apes and monkeys turn to ash and dust."*

Examining the scriptures, from the *Yuán Gāng* ("Primal Outline") unfolding the thirty-two heavens to the *Xuánzhōng Tàihuáng Shàngdì Gāozhēn* ("High Perfected of the Mysterious Center’s Great Yellow Supreme Emperor"), all embody heaven’s essence and the Great Brahmā’s function. When descending to govern the *níwán* (mud-pill palace) and *jiàngōng* (crimson palace) within the human body, they regulate the five *qi*, merge the hundred spirits, revolve the tenfold numen, and unify the myriad *qi* into immortality—this speaks directly to the body’s inner workings. Thus, the text describes the Great One containing the lotus in its natural form, the eight vessels merging in the crimson palace, enabling the five *qi*’s convergence—a process aligned with the *Dàdòng Huífēng Hùnhé* path. Yet without transmitted instructions, even with outlined practices, there is no gateway for entry or starting point.

The Tiāntái tradition’s thirtieth section, *"Regulating the Five* Qi *in the Center,"* annotates several chapters, including *"Exiting and Entering the Radiant Chamber,"* *"Within the Eight Obscurities,"* *"In the Subtle Midst,"* *"Descending to Govern the Body,"* *"Mud-Pill and Crimson Palace,"* *"Regulating the Five* Qi,"* and *"Merging the Hundred Spirits."* However, it lacks practical instructions, merely summarizing: *"Creation is not external to the body; the root lies in these three heavens. The Supreme Sovereign and High Perfected all revere the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace."* Such words fail to convey the practice’s subtleties.

It continues: "Whoever recklessly divulges this Dao will condemn nine generations of their ancestors to the fiery hell of poisonous torment," strictly forbidding its transmission. Further, it states: "Unless one is a sage of the Supreme Mystery or a celestial teacher instructing minor immortals, how could its mysteries be revealed?" Given this, such passages are not practical instructions but mere outlines within the text. Why, then, the threat of punishment for reckless disclosure? The two diagrams in the text differ only slightly.

The Tiāntái tradition refrains from acknowledging the absence of transmitted instructions, preserving such matters as a means to peddle marvels. The *"Flowing Essence and Jade Radiance"* section describes constructing a chamber on an elevated, open site: eight feet square, round above and square below, with thirty-two circular apertures, each nine *fen* in diameter. Seal thirty-one apertures, leaving one to admit direct sunlight. Place a precious vessel beneath it, filled with well-flower water from the east. As sunlight illuminates the water, circulating throughout the chamber, after ten days, five-colored flowing essence congeals within the water, forming cinnabar of five hues. Ingesting it grants spiritual penetration, far-seeing vision, command over the myriad spirits, the blossoming of the five viscera, and rejuvenation from old age.

Accumulate this jade-radiance cinnabar, then take moon-flower water, dew, river water, mountain springs, well-flower water, and westward-flowing springs, placing them in a precious vessel. As before, let sunlight flow through it. Within thirty days, golden sand forms. Combine this sand with the previous cinnabar, again exposing it to sunlight. Then, with cinnabar and the three yellows sealed in a golden crucible, refine it into divine elixir, which can dispel illness, restore youth, and transmute base metals into treasure.

Careful examination reveals that while the text describes building a chamber on an elevated site and arranging vessels to capture sunlight—eventually producing an elixir—it lacks transmitted instructions. Such groundless claims cannot be pursued through conjecture. The Tiāntái tradition compiles thirty-six sections under the name *"Yin-Yang Twin Elixirs."* One passage briefly states: *"Flowing Essence and Jade Radiance"* can be gathered and refined; ingesting it connects one to the true. Before the vast emptiness bore a single thing, the Three Radiances unfolded, universally nurturing the divine spirits. Refining this *qi* into an elixir—this is how *"Flowing Essence and Jade Radiance"* is depicted, and the principle is roughly coherent.

Next, it describes a secluded chamber on a high cliff, inaccessible to human footsteps, where sunlight and moonlight freely illuminate. Construct a secret chamber, round above and square below, eight feet in height and ten feet across, raised five feet from the ground. Pierce thirty-two apertures, arranging them like the twenty-eight constellations as windows, allowing sunlight to stream within. Begin on the day the sun aligns with the Horn constellation, using a seven-jeweled vessel, five inches in diameter, filled with westward-flowing water. Let it receive descending sunlight. After forty-five days, five-colored flowing essence congeals within the water. Ingest it, and one’s face will radiate flowing essence.

It further states: beneath the thirty-two apertures, place thirty-two vessels. On the day the sun aligns with a constellation, take water from that direction, infuse it with celestial flowers and the four springs, and let the sun and moon illuminate it for forty-five days. Floating sand will form, shimmering with light. Maintain constant purity, preventing dust from obscuring it. Then, set up an altar and furnace, with eight gates for fire. Use twelve taels of gold for the crucible and twenty-four taels of iron for the cauldron. Kindle fire with a burning mirror, refining day and night. Open the furnace every forty-five days, moistening it with moon-flower water. Below, white essence congeals—collect one *jin* of it, then refine it with yin-yang fire, sublimating it onto the lid. After nine years, it naturally ascends and congeals. Ingesting it, one transforms into an immortal.

These are the untransmitted instructions of antiquity. Though the Tiāntái text describes them in detail, its account slightly diverges from ancient methods. Yet it remains impractical, as ancient texts have already noted the absence of transmitted instructions. It also claims that swallowing the essence of the sun and moon on one’s life-day enables *"Crossing the Void to Ascend as an Immortal"*—this is incorrect. Likewise, gathering a hundred flowers into various medicines to compound the *"Divine Treasure Flowing Radiance Elixir,"* ingesting which instantly grants longevity—this, too, is false. Daoist scriptures contain many examples of ingesting substances, but these are not part of the original method and should not be preserved or practiced.

The *"Circulating Brahman Qi"* section states: Humans receive *qi* at birth, which has a numerical beginning. The breath’s ebb and flow manifest in the three sections and four boundaries of the pulse. Each exhalation spans three *cun*, each inhalation three *cun*, aligning with the celestial balance and the Great Yang. A day and night comprise one hundred *ke*, totaling six thousand *fen*. Each *ke* has sixty *fen*, and each *shi* (two-hour period) contains eight *ke* and twenty *fen*, summing to five hundred *fen*. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with three hundred sixty breaths per *ke*. Each exhalation and inhalation propels the pulse six *cun*, with the Great Yang traveling sixty *li*. In a day and night, the Great Yang travels nine hundred sixty-one thousand five hundred *li*, circling the heavens to illuminate three hundred sixty-five degrees and twenty-five and a half *fen*. Each day, it traverses one and a half degrees, completing a celestial cycle of one hundred eighty-two degrees, sixty-two *fen*, seventy-five *chao*. Each degree measures one thousand four hundred sixty-four *li*, six *cun*, and four *fen*, following the twenty-eight constellations’ celestial degrees.

The Dao’s Brahman *qi* flows endlessly, revolving through the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants. Each *ke*, the Great Yang’s true *qi* circulates ten thousand eight hundred *li*. Each *ke* has sixty *fen* and three hundred sixty breaths, defining the Great Yang’s flowing radiance. Each *fen* has six breaths, with the Great Yang’s radiance flowing three hundred sixty *li*. Each *shi*, the Great Yang travels eighty-six thousand four hundred *li*, while *qi* flows six thousand seven hundred fifty *cun*. In twelve *shi*, *qi* and blood traverse seven hundred eight thousand ninety *cun*. As the sun and moon conjoin, yin and yang intermingle; as the sun and moon move, the constructive and defensive *qi* circulate—thus, the great medicine is formed.

This is the supreme Primordial Dao of the highest grade, by which all true immortals of the Three Realms attain the ascension of both bone and flesh. In profound stillness by day and night, one awakens inwardly—mouth sealed, the practice upheld. Should a single word of it be leaked, then seven generations of ancestors and nine lineages of descendants shall alike endure the trials of Fengdu and the decrees of Xuandu. Dare one not uphold it?

It is ever heard that when *qi* gathers to form shape, the divine resides within the true; flowing endlessly, it pervades the ten directions—this is the great Brahman of celestial perfection. The great Brahman of the human body corresponds above to the celestial degrees. Thus, with each breath, *qi* circulates within the body, uniting with the Great Yang. Through accumulation and refinement, the great medicine is formed—this is indeed the path of true cultivation, the threshold of entering the Dao, though the secret method has not yet been revealed.

In the thirty-seventh chapter of the Tiantai method, titled *"The Great Practice of Brahman Qi,"* it is said that humans are born from the primordial Brahman of the cosmic mist yet die by the great Dharma of the celestial ford—this is incorrect. While humans are indeed born of Brahman *qi*, without cultivating the scriptures of the great Brahman, they constantly lose the Brahman *qi* and thus perish. To claim they die *from* it—how can this be so?

Following the *Nine Cauldrons Diagram*, it describes the Metal Mother dwelling on the Western Tortoise Mountain, taking its symbolism from the human body—this pertains to the flowing evolution of the primordial net, and having already been incorporated into this chapter, it cannot be cited obliquely as tangential proof, nor applied to this passage.

**Chapter on the Divine Transformation of Millet-Grain Elixir**
The yang line consists of thirty-six breaths; the yin line, twenty-four breaths. Each breath moves three *cun* in and out. In one *shi*, *qi* extends six thousand seven hundred fifty *cun*; in twelve *shi*, it spans eighty-one thousand *cun*, totaling eight thousand one hundred *chi*, or eight hundred ten *zhang* of true *qi*. Each *shi* contains eight *ke* and twenty *fen*; twelve *shi* comprise ninety-six *ke*, of which four *ke* are occupied by Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun.

For an ordinary person, one *shi* establishes one thousand one hundred twenty-five breaths; twelve *shi* total thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Each breath refines one *zhu* of fire, yielding the ancestral *qi*’s elixir, as small as a millet grain and weighing one *zhu*. Twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*; three hundred eighty *zhu* refine one *jin* of fire. With thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, the true fire amounts to twenty-five *jin* and two *liang* and a half. Through eight yin and eight yang, following the hexagrams, the sacred embryo is born—ascending in broad daylight, one attains the rank of Jade Clarity.

Though this passage does not reveal the secret method, its principle continues from the previous chapter: refining the Brahman *qi* within the body to unite with the Great Yang and achieve success. Therein, one examines the ebb and flow of yin and yang, scrutinizes the timing of fire’s advance and retreat. When the elixir is formed and the medicine complete—no larger than a millet grain—this is the divine-transforming elixir.

Many similar discussions exist in other elixir scriptures, yet they do not derive from the originally revealed texts; thus, it is improper to borrow them as proof here. The twenty-ninth chapter of the Tiantai method, titled *"Entering the Mystery of the Millet-Grain Pearl,"* describes how, after ten cycles are completed, the great celestial perfected ones of the ten directions’ boundless heavens arrive simultaneously, and the Primordial Beginning suspends a precious pearl as large as a millet grain. It then adopts the explanations of Xue Youqi and others, weaving in convoluted analogies and additional miscellaneous theories. It further states that, *internally speaking*, this is the method of the pearl’s divine transformation into the embryo-immortal. After nine revolutions and ten cycles, the work is complete—passing from existence into non-existence, it is called the *Millet-Grain Mysterious Elixir*, which stabilizes the numinous palace of the Yellow Court. Once the elixir is formed, it pierces the sun, and one immediately mounts the cloud chariot. Yet this implies that reciting scriptures alone can produce the elixir, entirely omitting the practice of secret methods—such a principle is untenable.

The Tiantai method comprises forty-nine chapters, none of which, from beginning to end, lack the revelation of secret methods. The seven classics and eight wefts are the essentials of its practice, yet it conceals the names of the seven classics and alters the titles of the eight wefts. Even where ancient methods lack revealed secrets, it forcibly contrives connections to embellish them.

Now, according to the Daoist canon: from the Longhan and Yankang kalpas to the dawn of the Chiming era, transmissions have varied—sometimes hidden, sometimes manifest. Some were revealed in accordance with the times, others in response to individuals. Once revealed and transmitted among humans, some were concealed when their recipients ascended as perfected beings. Even the Three Caverns’ orthodox canon is incomplete. Methods such as the seventy-four myriad transformations, the texts hidden in the moon’s concealment, the eight endowments and ten secrets, the celestial pass’s three diagrams, the nine vermilion talismans, the *Records of the Womb’s Essence*—names like these are countless. Though their names remain in the catalogs of scriptures, their methods have not been transmitted to the world. How dare one invent their contents based on mere names?

For the Dao’s workings have their appointed times, and sacred texts leak secrets only when the moment is ripe—this cannot be forcibly compelled by human effort. The Lingbao great method originally possessed seven classics and eight wefts. Apart from the Tiantai compilation, all other collections do not exceed these seven classics and eight wefts. Among the fifteen passages, six lack revealed secret methods: the refinement of ancestral *qi*, the *Dongyang* talismanic method, the fusion of the five *qi*, the flowing essence and jade radiance, the circulation of Brahman *qi*, and the divine transformation of the millet-grain elixir.

Who can say that in later ages, no one of immortal aptitude and numinous quality will arise, moved by a sacred teacher’s divine transmission, to elucidate these ancient texts and preserve their names and examples? Yet the Tiantai method distorts each matter with convoluted explanations, compiling them into volumes. If one were to adopt and apply them, would this not mislead the world? Thus, it is unavoidable to repeatedly dissect their origins and lineages.

*Here ends Scroll Eight of the* Supreme Clarity Lingbao Great Method.
*Here begins Scroll Nine of the* Supreme Clarity Lingbao Great Method.

The *Dongxuan Lingbao* Ritual Master of the Southern Bureau, Keeper of the Law Canon, Provisional Youth of the Right Auxiliary Governance, Jin Yunzhong, compiles:

**Chapter on Fasting Prohibitions and Taboos**

**Three Primes**
The fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month.
On these days, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Twenty-Seven Bureaus, and the One Hundred Twenty Offices convene to examine merits and transgressions. The Three Prime days are when memorials are presented to the Upper Palace.
These are suitable for performing the Dao, establishing fasts, cultivating the body, and repenting transgressions.

**Three Assemblies**
The seventh day of the first month is the Assembly of Promotion and Reward; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Assembly of Celebrating Life; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Grand Assembly of Establishing Life.
On these Three Assemblies, the Three Officials strictly examine merits and transgressions, and the Three Hun gather to report the good and evil of the living—hence called the Three Hun Assembly Days.
These are the days of one’s original destiny, and there are also lesser gathering days: the *Taiguang* reports on the *jiazi* day, the *Shuangling* on the *gengshen* day, and the *Youjing* on one’s destiny day, also recording the good and evil of the living.
On these days, it is fitting to receive talismans and registers, observe fasting precepts, present memorials, and submit petitions to pray for radiant blessings.

**Five Laba Festivals**
The first day of the first month is the Heavenly Laba; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly Laba; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Laba of Dao and Virtue; the first day of the tenth month is the Laba of the People’s Year; the twelfth month is the Laba of Kings and Lords.
On these Five Laba days, the Five Emperors convene their assemblies. On these days, the Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness in Fengdu summons the distant ancestral parents of the living, the spirits of the dark prisons, and the ghosts to inquire about their dwelling places in the netherworld, the duration of their confinement, the origins of their accumulated sins and offenses, and the names and burial sites of their descendants. If their transgressions from kalpas past remain unredeemed, the living will be implicated on these days.
When questioned, the names of descendants, siblings, relatives, and the nine clans are gathered and examined to determine the living’s offenses. On these days, disciples of the Orthodox Unity tradition rely sincerely on the power of the Dao to perform sacrifices and redeem the suffering of the dark paths—blessings thus obtained far surpass those of ordinary days.
*From the* Orthodox Unity Jade Canon.

**Ten Monthly Fasting Days**
The first day: beneath the Northern Dipper in the northwest.
The eighth day: beneath the Northern Dipper’s Lord of Execution.
The fourteenth day: beneath the Messenger of the Great One in the northeast.
The fifteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Emperor of the East and the Three Officials.
The eighteenth day: beneath the Heavenly Emperor of the Southeast.
The twenty-third day: beneath the Eight Divine Messengers of the Great One in the south.
The twenty-fourth day: beneath the Northern Star in the southwest.
The twenty-eighth day: beneath the Great One of the West.
On months with a lesser number of days, the twenty-seventh day: beneath the Great One of the Center below.
The thirtieth day: beneath the Great One of the Upper Above.
*From the* Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Causes.
Another text states: beneath the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, or beneath the Heavenly Lords of the Ten Directions.

**Festival Assembly Days**
Heavenly Festival: *jiawu*.
Earthly Festival: *jiashen*.
Human Festival: *jiazi*.
Heavenly Assembly: *bingwu*.
Earthly Assembly: *renwu*.
Human Assembly: *renzi*.
Solar Assembly: *gengwu*.
Stellar Assembly: *xinyou*.
Lunar Assembly: *gengshen*.
Five Agents Assembly: *jiachen*.
Four Seasons Assembly: *jiaxu*.
On these Festival Assemblies and Five Laba days, it is fitting to perform fasts, set up jiao offerings, and sacrifice to ancestral spirits.
On *jiazi* days, the Great One reviews the deities; on *gengshen* days, the Three Corpses report human transgressions; on one’s destiny day, one’s merits and conduct are tallied.
Another text states: On *jiayin* and *gengshen* days, corpse-demons vie in chaos—one should avoid the bedchamber.
The *Jade Canon* also states: These three days are lesser gathering days. Matters left unexamined during the Three Primes are re-examined on these days.

**Eight Nodal Days**
Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice.
According to the *Declarations of the Perfected*: During the Eight Nodal Days, one should fast, establish stillness, and plan good deeds to cultivate the Dao. Beware of anger, strife, joy, or wrath on these days, and avoid imposing punishments—these are great taboos of Heaven and humanity.

**Wu and Mao Days**
On all *wu* and *mao* days, one should purify oneself, enter the chamber, face east, and bow with sincerity, contemplating the spirits and nurturing *qi*, awaiting the response of the divine. One may also express one’s intentions.
Those who persist in this will have Jade Maidens descend to attend them.

**Days of Avoidance and Taboo**
Li Shaojun’s oral instructions: Daoists seeking immortality must not consort with women.
The ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month.
On these days, one should enter the chamber and avoid seeing women or the Six Corpses, lest chaos arise, blood be disturbed, and the Three Hun lose their guard, causing the spirit to wither and *qi* to dissipate, leading to death.
The reason for avoiding these days is not merely to restrain licentiousness but to pacify the Woman’s Palace.
The Woman’s Palace resides in *shen*; the Man’s Palace resides in *yin*. *Yin* and *shen* clash, and their mutual harm intensifies. On these days, the male and female Three Corpses emerge from the pupils of the eyes—the female corpse beckons the male, and the male corpse beckons the female—bringing calamity and harm, depleting the spirit and diminishing integrity.
Though one may not be aware, one’s appearance will naturally deteriorate, as the Three Corpses battle within the eyes, causing blood to flow into the Nine Mud.
On these days, even the most beloved women and cherished wives must not be faced.
My former teacher attained immortality by practicing this Dao alone, without even approaching close kin or those without desire.
You must be cautious.
This was taught by Liu Gang’s wife, a female immortal.
*From the* Biographies of Divine Transcendents.
Another passage states: On *jiayin* and *gengshen* days, corpse-demons vie in chaos, and the spirit becomes restless and defiled. One must not share a bed with a spouse or engage in conversation or meetings. One should purify oneself, remain awake, and dispel all desires.

**First and Full Moons**
The first day of each month is the first moon; the sixteenth day is the full moon.
According to the official calendar, the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth days of each month should be observed with morning cultivation to pray for blessings and repent transgressions.

**Monthly Taboos**

**Monthly Taboos (Continued)**

On the following days, avoid burning incense:
- Second day of the first month; second *gengshen* day of the second month; tenth day of the third month (a *xinhai* day); eleventh day of the fourth month (an * Jiaxu* day); eleventh day of the fifth month (a *guihai* day); tenth day of the sixth month (a *renzi* day); twelfth day of the seventh month (a *guichou* day); thirteenth day of the eighth month (a *jiayin* day); thirteenth day of the ninth month (a *yimao* day); eighth day of the tenth month (a *jiachen* day); fifteenth day of the eleventh month (a *dingsi* day); thirteenth day of the twelfth month (a *bingwu* day); and the *dingwei* day.
(Note: Daily routine incense offerings are not restricted.)

**Days of the Celestial Slayer**
Avoid burning incense on:
- *Gengshen* day of the first month; *xinmao* day of the second month; *gengxu* day of the third month; *guihai* day of the fourth month; *renzi* day of the fifth month; *guichou* day of the sixth month; *jiayin* day of the seventh month; *yimao* day of the eighth month; *jiachen* day of the ninth month; *dingsi* day of the tenth month; *bingwu* day of the eleventh month; and *yiwei* day of the twelfth month.

**Sacred Taboos**
- *Bingyin* and *dingmao* days (taboo for Daoist fathers);
- *Bingshen* and *dingyou* days (taboo for Daoist mothers);
- *Renchen* and *renxu* days (taboo for the Northern Emperor);
- *Wuchen* and *wuxu* days (taboo for the Southern Emperor);
- Days of *jueming* (severed fate), *benming jue* (fate’s end by Jupiter), *xingnian dao ri* (year’s arrival at the day of six harms), *benming dui ri* (fate’s opposing day), *yue hui* (lunar waning), *yue qiong* (lunar exhaustion), and *sui po* (year’s rupture);
- Days when the Grand Year (*Taisui*) is in direct opposition.

On the above days, avoid practicing the Dao, burning incense, or killing. Instead, sit upright, reflect in stillness, and repent transgressions— the sages will surely know.

**Days of Supplication**
- Fourth day of the first month; eighth day of the second month; fifteenth day of the third month; eighth day of the fourth month; ninth day of the fifth month; sixth day of the sixth month; seventh day of the seventh month; eighth day of the eighth month; ninth day of the ninth month; fifth day of the tenth month; third day of the eleventh month; and twelfth day of the twelfth month.

On these days, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao ascends the Jade Cloud Forest Chamber, gazing upon the four directions of the world. Those with aspirations for distant cultivation may, at sunrise, face north and bow twice— or do so in quietude— to express their deepest wishes. Conclude by swallowing saliva thirty-six times.

It is also said that the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea regularly ascends the Eastern Flower Terrace of the Square Cauldron on *dingmao* days to survey the four directions. On such days, one may face the rising sun to practice, thereby absorbing the essence of the sun.

**Prohibitions and Taboos**

**Prohibited Foods and Taboos**

Onions, leeks, garlic, shallots, and coriander—these are the *Five Pungents*. Many explanations exist regarding the *Five Pungents*. Generally, these foods are intensely pungent and foul; even after a day of consuming them, their stench lingers in the mouth. Speaking to others becomes unbearable—how much more so when reciting sacred texts or performing rites to the Perfected? Beyond the *Five Pungents*, there are also foods like *xie* (a type of onion), which should not be eaten. No need for further elaboration.

Wild geese, dogs, and black carp (not the character for "carp")—these are the *Three Forbidden Meats*. Beyond the *Three Forbidden Meats*, there are also creatures like soft-shelled turtles and eels, whose foul and lingering odors are difficult to dispel. None of these should be consumed.

Additionally, one must not eat in the presence of corpses, while offering condolences at funerals, near women who have just given birth, at execution grounds, slaughterhouses, or brothels. All the above are forbidden.

**Li Shaojun’s Oral Instructions:**
Daoists seeking immortality should avoid seeing corpses, for it severely damages the spirit and disrupts *qi*. Only out of filial piety toward one’s lord, parents, or teachers may one reluctantly attend a funeral. This is why Daoists distance themselves from the world and do not serve kings or nobles—lest they be seen as lacking loyalty—and why they dwell in solitude—lest they be seen as lacking companionship. Yet for parents, teachers, or masters, one cannot but attend their funerals, even if it means enduring profound grief and risking harm to one’s life. If such harm occurs for this reason, it is no true harm. This secret teaching is transmitted orally.

**On One’s Life-Destiny Day:**
On one’s life-destiny day, face the direction corresponding to one’s destiny, click the teeth three times, and silently bow twice. Recite the incantation:

*"The Great One governs life,
The Three *Qi* unite with the True.
The womb chamber holds the Upper Radiance,
Mother Mysterious, Father Primordial.
You gave birth to my five viscera,
You gather my spirit.
Below, jade liquid irrigates;
Above, it ascends to the Muddy Pellet.
At dusk, refine the seven *po*;
At dawn, harmonize the three *hun*.
To the left, the Jade Flower of Destiny;
To the right, the Golden Dawn’s whistle.
Grant me transcendence,
Command spirits and employ deities.
Ever preserve integrity and purity,
Soaring through the Ten Heavens."*

After reciting, silently bow to the four directions, click the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called the *"Hidden Audience of the Womb Primordial"*—a method of the Most High for praying for life. Practicing this regularly ensures the *hun* and *po* are guarded, leading to longevity and transcendence.

**Another Method:**
Those studying the Dao must first restrain the *hun* and *po*, eliminating the corpse-ghost. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new month, *gengshen* days, *jiazi* days, and during sleep, one should abstain from all desires. On the first (*dan*) and fifteenth (*wang*) days of each month—*dan* being the first day, *wang* the sixteenth—consult the official calendar for the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth days of each month to perform morning cultivation, seeking blessings and repenting for transgressions.

**Monthly Taboos:**
- **First month:** Second day, *gengshen* day
- **Second month:** Ninth day, *xinhai* day
- **Third month:** Tenth day, *jiaxu* day
- **Fourth month:** Eleventh day, *guihai* day
- **Fifth month:** Eleventh day, *renzǐ* day
- **Sixth month:** Tenth day, *guichou* day

- **Eighth month:** Thirteenth day, *yimao* day
- **Ninth month:** Thirteenth day, *jiachen* day
- **Tenth month:** Eighth day, *dingsi* day
- **Eleventh month:** Fifteenth day, *bingwu* day
- **Twelfth month:** Thirteenth day, *dingwei* day

On the above days, avoid burning incense (though daily incense offerings are unrestricted).

On these days, avoid burning incense.

**Sacred Taboos:**
- *Bingyin*, *dingmao* (taboo for Daoist fathers)
- *Bingshen*, *dingyou* (taboo for Daoist mothers)
- *Renchen*, *rentu* (taboo for the Northern Emperor)
- *Wuchen*, *wuxu* (taboo for the Southern Emperor)
- Days of *jueming* (severed destiny), *benming jue* (life-destiny severed), *suixing* (Jupiter’s position), *xingnian zhi ri* (year’s arrival day), *liuhai* (six harms), *benming dui ri* (life-destiny opposing day), *yuehui* (last day of the lunar month), *yueqiong* (end of the lunar month), *suipo* (year’s rupture), and *taisui duichong* (opposition to the Grand Year)

On the above days, avoid performing Daoist rites, burning incense, or killing. Instead, sit upright, reflect on one’s transgressions, and repent sincerely—the Perfected will surely know.

**Days for Prayer and Supplication:**
First month, fourth day; second month, eighth day; third month, fifteenth day; fourth month, eighth day; fifth month, ninth day; sixth month, sixth day; seventh month, seventh day; eighth month, eighth day; ninth month, ninth day; tenth month, fifth day; eleventh month, third day; twelfth month, twelfth day.

On these days, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao ascends the Jade Cloud Forest Chamber, gazing upon the four directions of the world. Those with aspirations for distant cultivation may, at sunrise, face north and bow twice—or do so in quietude—to express their deepest wishes. Conclude by swallowing saliva thirty-six times.

It is also said that the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea regularly ascends the Eastern Flower Terrace of the Square Cauldron on *dingmao* days to survey the four directions. On such days, one may face the rising sun to practice, thereby absorbing the essence of the sun.

Onion, leek, garlic, shallot, and coriander—these are the Five Pungents. The theories on the Five Pungents are manifold. Generally, such foods are intensely pungent and foul; even after a day of consuming them, the stench lingers in the mouth. Speaking to others becomes unbearable, let alone reciting sacred texts or performing rites to the Perfected. Beyond the Five Pungents, there are also plants like *xie* (Chinese chive) and *cong*-like vegetables, all of which should not be eaten. No need for further elaboration.

Wild goose, dog, and black carp (not the character for "carp")—these are the Three Taboos. Beyond the Three Taboos, there are also creatures like soft-shelled turtle and eel, whose rank and foul qi are difficult to dispel; none of these should be consumed.

One must also avoid eating in the presence of corpses, at funerals, near recent childbirth, following executions, at slaughterhouses, or in brothels. All the above are forbidden.

Li Shaojun’s oral transmission states: Daoists seeking immortality should avoid seeing corpses, for it severely harms the spirit and corrupts qi. Only for one’s lord, parents, or teacher may one reluctantly attend a funeral. Thus, Daoists distance themselves from the world and do not serve kings or lords—this is not disloyalty, just as solitary seclusion is not loneliness. Only for parents or teachers must one attend a funeral, expressing utmost grief, even at the cost of one’s life. If harm comes from such devotion, it is no true harm. This secret teaching is transmitted orally.

On one’s *benming* (life-destiny) day, face the direction of one’s *benming* at dawn, click the teeth three times, and mentally bow twice. Recite the incantation:

*"The Great One guards life, the Three Qi unite with the Perfected.
The womb chamber ascends to the Upper Radiance; mother is Mystery, father is Origin.
You gave birth to my five viscera, gathered my spirit.
Below, jade liquid irrigates; above, it ascends to the Muddy Pellet.
At dusk, refine the seven po; at dawn, harmonize the three hun.
To the left, the Jade Flower of Life; to the right, the Golden Dawn’s whistle.
Make me a divine immortal, commanding spirits and gods.
Ever preserve uprightness, soaring through the Ten Heavens."*

After the incantation, mentally bow to the four directions, click the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called the *"Hidden Audience of the Womb Origin"* of the Most High, the Dao of invoking life. Practicing this regularly secures the hun and po, ensuring longevity and immortality.

Another method: Daoist practitioners must first restrain the hun and po, eliminating corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new month, *gengshen* days, *jiazi* days, and other major ritual days, one must not approach corpses. For three days, observe mourning rites, purify oneself, and enter seclusion. Beyond periods of mourning for close kin, one should avoid corpses when possible. Condolences cannot be neglected, but one must purify afterward. Even for non-relatives, if the bond is deep, one should still observe taboos. After major funeral rites conclude, perform purification and bathing, then report to the True Controller of the Departments, restoring the generals and officers as per usual protocol.

**Taboos on Childbirth:**
Daoists dwelling in jade palaces must avoid all childbirth. For lay practitioners, only the birth of a child cannot be avoided. After a full month, one may purify and re-enter seclusion, following the same protocol as above. All other cases require avoidance; violators will face divine punishment.

**Incantation for Haircutting:**
*"Muddy Pellet’s Mystic Flower, preserve essence and longevity.
To the left, the Hidden Moon; to the right, the Sun’s Root.
The Six Harmonies refine; the hundred spirits receive grace."*
After reciting, swallow saliva three times. Regular practice prevents hair loss. Comb frequently, but not painfully; one may also have an attendant comb thoroughly. Thus, blood and qi flow unobstructed, hair roots remain firm. Comb toward the auspicious direction.

**Incantation for Bathing:**
*"Heaven and Earth open bright, the Four Greatnesses endure.
Mystic water washes away filth, dispelling misfortune.
Twin youths guard the gate; the Seven Perfected settle the chamber.
Divine fluid refines and irrigates; the myriad qi blend in harmony.
Inner and outer flourish; preserve this yellow robe.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

**Incantation for Eating:**
*"The hundred grains and five flavors flow into spleen and stomach.
The five viscera find peace; corpse-demons forever fall.
The seven ancestors receive grace; long life and enduring vision.
Remove the garments incantation:
Receive the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, ascending to the Nine Palaces.
The hundred spirits settle in place, arrayed beside the Divine Lords.
Hun and po harmonize and refine; the five viscera bloom in splendor.
The hundred bones infused with mystery; the seven fluids fill in emptiness.
Fire and bell intertwine, extinguishing ghosts and banishing ill fortune.
May the divine immortals above grant eternal, unending life."*

**Incantation for Sleeping:**
*"Heaven has the Nine August Ones; Earth has the Nine Palaces.
My body’s hundred joints follow the myriad spirits.
The Three Corpses are subdued; the five viscera flow freely.
The Three Fields and four limbs, in motion and stillness, guard the center.
Dragon and Tiger, the Eight Trigrams, attend my jade countenance.
Ghosts, demons, and myriad spirits, dare not trespass the True Palace."*

**Incantation for Using the Latrine:**
*"Left Virtue Spirit, Right Virtue Spirit,
Left Controller of Earth, Original Lady,
Remove my name from the register of death,
Inscribe my name in the register of life."*

According to the ancient statutes of the *Zhaizhi* (fasting and vigil) days, the prohibitions are scattered across various scriptures and cannot be exhaustively listed. Here, only those most essential to practice are briefly noted. On such days, one may perform rituals for supplication, ascend the altar to initiate affairs, present memorials, confess transgressions, or express gratitude. Even without prayers, one may use these days to regulate conduct, eliminate wrongdoing, and reduce faults—this too aids in pure cultivation.

Matters one must not engage in, foods one must not eat, all that disturbs the spirit and defiles the body—how can they not be shunned? If one’s conduct dwells in the realm of the Dao, the heart abides in the land of tranquility, never forgetting even in sleep or haste, then every moment becomes a fast, and no day is bound by restrictions.

But if one’s person is unrefined, conduct unchecked, presumptuously violating the registers of the law and transgressing taboos, then the Three Officials will impose punishment, the Five Emperors will censure faults, nine generations will share the guilt, and the individual will bear the penalty—not because the Dao is unkind.

In the *Tiantai Method*, the twenty-third section on the rules of fasting and vigilance includes the Ten Precepts from the original Lingbao scriptures. The *Yunzhong* has incorporated these into the first section. The remaining *Zhaizhi* days and their protocols are largely consistent with the statutes, though the cited scriptures are mostly from the Three Caverns’ catalogs, some of which are no longer extant.

Though these methods circulate in the world today, they should not yet be taken as authoritative.

For ritual ablutions, the days of the Eastern Well are prescribed as follows: the tenth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the sixth day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the first day of the fifth month, the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the twenty-second day of the eighth month, the twentieth day of the ninth month, the eighteenth day of the tenth month, the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, and the tenth day of the twelfth month.

Here ends *Scroll Nine of the Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of Highest Clarity*.
*Scroll Ten of the Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of Highest Clarity* begins.

**Section on the Seals and Scripts of the Dharma**

A seal is a token of trust. When goods are sealed and entrusted, it serves as the credential held by those in authority. The *Institutes of the Han Officials* states: kings and marquises use the term *xi* (imperial seal), marquises and officials of the second rank and above use *zhang* (seals of office), while all others use *yin* (seals). Such are the regulations of the yang world.

In the flourishing ages of high antiquity, humans and spirits each remained in their proper places, and the orders of yin and yang were not intermingled.

Thus, the application of the Dao is seen only in the cultivation of truth and refinement of the root, leading to lightness of body and ascension in flight. From the middle antiquity onward, reverence for the true declined day by day, the orthodox Dao grew ever more obscure, and falsehoods vied with one another in profusion, causing the upper and lower realms to reverse their proper order. Thereupon, methods were revealed to remedy these ills, manifesting teachings to convey sincerity, and seals and scripts were bestowed as tokens of trust.

The meaning of using seals, though similar to worldly practice, also reflects the Dao’s adaptation to the times through augmentation or diminution. However, those seals whose names resemble those of mundane offices must not employ the same graphs, nor may they adopt the common scripts of the world. They must not use the designations of bureaus and courts, nor presume to encroach upon the offices of the celestial perfected. They must not introduce extraneous or overly elaborate elements beyond their proper function. Nor should they employ seals outside the *Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure*, for since ancient times only the seal of the Southern Bureau under the Three Heavens’ Gate has been used.

In recent ages, as true scripts have become scarce, the four characters “Three Heavens’ Gate Under” (*Santian Menxia*) are not to be used in the human realm. If these four characters are removed, the seal becomes incomplete. Therefore, in accordance with the original method, only the seal of the *Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Bureau* is used, its text being the cloud-script of the celestial chapters. Though the six characters resemble common graphs, they cannot all be recognized. Though the Tiantai school relegated this seal to disuse, it still included it in its methods, enlarging its dimensions so that graphs like *ling* (numinous) and *bao* (treasure) were arranged in orderly fashion, closely resembling ordinary scripts. Those who practice its teachings employ seal texts that differ from the orthodox lineage of the Middle Prime.

Now that one has advanced to the rank of *Dongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery), bears the register of the Middle Alliance, and practices the Numinous Treasure method, one’s office is already weighty. Apart from memorials for audience, whether submitting documents above or issuing directives below—whether petitions, official communications, notices, proclamations, talismans, or writs—all bureaus and courts of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, all nether offices of the Nine Provinces and Four Seas, the profound yin of the Nine Earths, the grotto-heavens and immortal administrations, and all that pertains to the hidden and manifest realms must use the seal of the *Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Bureau*. This is the true credential of one’s office as an enforcer of the law—how could it be mixed with other seals?

For petitions and memorial boxes, the seal is uniformly applied to both upper and lower parts. Only memorials and their containers use the memorial seal; all other documents and writs employ the seal of one’s proper office. The seal of the *Great Perfect Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Bureau* has varied in size from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the present. There was the Zhou foot, the Qin foot, the Han official foot, the Later Zhou foot, and in the present dynasty, the cloth-and-silk foot and the provincial foot. In the Jiang-Huai region, there is the Huai foot, each differing in length.

The seal of one’s office as an enforcer of the law should measure two *cun* and five *fen* in diameter, according to the Zhou foot. Often, method texts specify the diameter of seals in *cun* and *fen* without distinguishing the length of the foot. Later scholars who follow antiquity should uniformly adopt the Zhou foot. Compared to the Song-Zhe foot, the Zhou foot measures only eight *cun* and three *fen* to make one *chi*.

The *Tongzhang* seal: The rank of *Dongzhen* (Cavernous Perfection) and the Dao of the Jade Clarity emerged during the Yonghe era of the Jin dynasty, transmitted by the Seven Perfected—Three Mao, Two Xu, Yang, and Guo—yet no standard for memorials was established.

The Dao of Supreme Clarity and Orthodox Unity was bestowed by the Mysterious Origin’s later sage upon the Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity, complete with the rites for memorial offerings. Those who employ the seal of the Nine Elder Immortals of the Divine Capital do so because the Eight Elders of Supreme Clarity’s Co-Generation revere the Most High as their master; thus, disciples submit their petitions to their master using the Nine Elder Immortals of the Divine Capital seal. The Dao of Cavernous Mystery and the teachings of Numinous Treasure trace back to the era of the Three Sovereigns and the kalpa of Vermilion Brightness, their teachings already extant, with established formats for memorials as recorded in the *Scripture of the Five Refinements for Animating the Corpse* and the *Scripture of the Original Conduct of the Five Elders*. As the Jade Clarity is the disciple of the Primordial Beginning, this seal serves to convey sincerity to the ancestral master. Without this register of methods, none may presumptuously employ it; substituting another seal invites examination by the Three Officials.

Yunzhong notes: This is as described in ancient methods. During the Song dynasty, the Daoist Wang Shengqing recompiled the Numinous Treasure methods, adhering to the ancient traditions in his arrangement, which many schools have since followed. The seal’s text also appears in the Divine Empyrean registers, though it omits the border when used for memorials, without detailing its origins. The ancient Numinous Treasure methods predate the Song dynasty, whereas the teachings of the Divine Empyrean flourished during the Xuanhe era. These are not provisions of the same method and cannot be conflated. The registers’ seals lack borders, yet as this is a weighty seal of the Middle Vehicle and a token of trust for memorial texts, it should uniformly follow the format of legal seals. A seal without a border is no seal at all. If the legal seal employs the Zhou foot, this seal should likewise use the Zhou foot; if the cloth-and-silk foot is used, this seal should follow suit—adherence to the ancient foot is proper.

**Divine Tiger General Seal**
This bears the names of the Seven Jade Maidens, used solely for imprinting on soul-summoning banners. For Divine Tiger administrative documents and official correspondence, only the seal of one’s office is employed.

The Great Numinous Treasure Methods encompass the essentials of the Middle Vehicle, governing the marshals and scribes of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace and the officials of the Northern Culmen Mysterious Range Mansion. Yet some today mistakenly use the Divine Tiger General Seal on Divine Tiger official documents—how can one address a marshal using his own name? This is improper.

**Divine Tiger Male and Female Seals**
According to the original Numinous Treasure statutes, these are used on the upper and lower sections of soul-summoning banners as tokens of summons. For other methods where they are unnecessary, following transmitted practices and omitting them from documents is permissible. Jade tablets are to be stamped only with one’s office seal after the date. When issuing official notices in accordance with one’s dharma rank, following the legal seal’s usage is also acceptable.

**Yellow Spirit Seal and Leaping Chapters Seal**
These are recorded in the essentials of Orthodox Unity. A single seal, collectively named the Yellow Spirit Leaping Chapters, is slightly larger in diameter and used solely for deploying qi in healing. Today, its diameter measures one *cun* and eight *fen* by the Zhou foot. According to ancient texts, two seals are employed for urgent petitions and supplications to the Celestial Emperor. Those not submitting formal memorials use them in separate methods.

Yunzhong respectfully observes: The Dao of Numinous Treasure emerged before the Boundless. The Great Numinous Treasure Methods arose after the Middle Antiquity. When Ge Xuan of Eastern Wu received the scriptures from the Perfected Xu Laile, the methods were still incomplete. During the Jin dynasty, Xu Jianyang encountered the Mother of Shen, who transmitted the teachings of the Bright King of Filial Piety in the Sun, and the statutes and ranks were first made manifest. The present reference to the Cold Clarity Abbey is incorrect—there is no second Dao of Numinous Treasure. By the end of the Jin and Song dynasties, the practice of Qi cultivation flourished, and documents proliferated, making seal engravings indispensable.

The Celestial Master of Han used only the Yangping Governance seal until his ascension. Xu Jianyang received bronze talismans, iron charters, the precious scriptures of the Golden Elixir, the teachings of the Bright King of Filial Piety, and the Dao of Numinous Treasure—yet his seals were not numerous. Through these, he elevated his entire household to ascension, attaining rank among the lofty heavens. Those who cultivate reality and attain the Dao, the superior scholars and exalted immortals, have also benefited the world and brought peace to their times without relying on seals. How could the weight of a method depend on the number of seals? Later practitioners of methods, unable to match the profound subtlety of the ancients, have multiplied their seals a hundredfold. Many in recent times have fabricated seals, altering old methods for profit, merely employing them in thunderous summons and examinations as recorded in various texts to perpetrate deceit.

The Tiantai school diverges from the statutes in this regard: though practicing Numinous Treasure methods, it does not use the seal of one’s office for memorials but instead employs the Flying Mystery Three Qi Jade Chapters Seal, which is absent from the ancient Numinous Treasure methods. Various schools have compiled the Numinous Treasure methods with great reverence, yet none have ever included this seal. The Tiantai school uses the Three Heavens Supreme Seal on talismanic notices, though talismanic texts descend from the Supreme Mystery. Today’s written talismans are crafted by human hands—submitting them to Heaven for enactment is permissible, but listing the dharma master’s rank after the talisman is inappropriate, for what role does the Three Heavens Supreme have in this? The Three Heavens and the Supreme are not terms for seal inscriptions.

Moreover, the inclusion of a Jade Seal of the Dao Lord in their methods is spurious. Emperors and kings use the term *xi* (imperial seal); it is improper for a Dao Lord to be called a seal. Seals made of jade are termed *yu xi* (jade seal). Just as the ancient Son of Heaven had eight seals, and Li Si of Qin engraved the transmitted imperial treasure, the Celestial Master carved jade into a seal, yet it was only called the Yangping Governance Merit Seal. From antiquity to the present, no seal has ever self-referenced as a jade seal in its inscription. The Dao Lord is the lord of the celestial realm, akin to the Son of Heaven among mortals—how could a subject dare use it? Would a subject submit a memorial to the lord using the lord’s own seal? This is unthinkable.

Additionally, there are seals such as the Chaos-Uniting Vermilion Script Seal, the Numinous Writ Central Section Seal, the Eight Might Dragon Script Seal, the Primordial Beginning Mandate Seal, the Spontaneous Numinous Chapters Seal, the Decree-Command Earth Spirit Seal, the Passes of All Heavens Seal, the Assembly-Summoning Multitude of Immortals Seal, and the Universal Announcement to the Three Realms Seal—all of which take four characters from scriptures as a single seal’s name.

Such seals as the *Northern Feng’s Stern Oversight Seal* and the *Luminous Inspection of Ghost Encampments Seal* add the character "seal" to their names, arranging the memorial in three columns—examples of this kind take eight characters from scriptures as a single seal’s name. If this were so, then the *Celestial Script Scripture of Salvation for Humankind*, from beginning to end, could all be made into seals, their number beyond reckoning.

Moreover, the newly circulated *Nine Offices of the Azure Mystery* is a text unattested in ancient canons, yet it introduces an especially large number of newly devised seal scripts. Those who conduct fasts and jiao rites have taken these and mixed them with the *Numinous Treasure* for use—this is incorrect.

During the Xuanhe era, the Precious Registers Abbey possessed a register of the *Highest Divine Empyrean Primordial Unity Six Yang Celestial Sphere Secret Registers*, yet it had no corresponding method. After the Southern Crossing, the registers conferred by the ancestral altars were simply called the *Northern Dipper Registers*. The Tiantai school, seizing upon the name "Celestial Sphere," compiled various texts to create a method and thus devised the *Mysterious Numinous Celestial Sphere Prefecture Seal*, which was the work of Du Dazhen. Now, the Celestial Sphere is merely the central palace of the Dipper constellation—it is neither an office for conducting rites in the lower realm nor a mark used among mortals. To address a memorial to the Dipper Palace while using a seal from within the Dipper itself—does this not violate principle?

For instance, when performing a *Northern Dipper Jiao* under the *Celestial Heart* method, one should properly use the *Bureau of Expelling Malevolence Seal* according to the original method. When conducting a *Northern Dipper Jiao* under the *Numinous Treasure* tradition, one should use the *Numinous Treasure Grand Dharma Office Seal*—what could be improper about this? Yet why go to such lengths to fabricate new seals?

There are also those who falsely claim the *Mysterious Numinous Communion with the True and Pacified Numinous Treasure Altar*, which not only usurps the celestial order but also violates the statutes of the yang realm. The Three Mao Mountains of Jinling are the ancestral altars of the *Great Cavern*. Mount Hezao by the Linjiang River is the ancestral altar of the *Numinous Treasure*. Mount Longhu in Xinzhou is the ancestral altar of the *Orthodox Unity*. These are the places where successive dynasties venerated the Three Caverns’ sagely masters, the sites of transmitting the true and propagating the teachings, and the centers governing the religious framework. When common folk establish altars for fasts and jiao rites temporarily and dismantle them once the rites conclude, how could there be private residences presuming to establish their own names and titles?

If one truly attained the subtleties of *Communion with the True*, then one could foreknow the great fortunes and calamities of the world, the auspices and disasters of the celestial divisions, and the cycles of destiny’s rise and fall. Yet such claims are forbidden by the laws of the world. Until one’s merit and conduct reach such heights, there is no need for such reckless presumption. There are those called *Masters of Communion with the True*, but this title is bestowed by the imperial court—it is not for commoners to claim for themselves.

There are also the *Nine Numinous Flying Paces Memorial Office* and the *Nine Numinous Flying Paces Memorial Seal*. Now, the "flying paces" are the actions of presenting memorials, merely the name for the steps of the *Big Dipper* ritual. There is no such office in heaven, nor is there such a seal in the world. From the *Orthodox Unity* registers to the *Cavern Mystery*, all may submit memorials, but they must adhere to their respective offices. Only the *Orthodox Unity* registers use the *Nine Elder Immortals’ Capital Seal*, and only the *Numinous Treasure* registers use the *General Memorial Seal*. There are no alternative traditions—why fabricate an additional title or specially devise a seal for submitting memorials?

To draw an analogy from worldly laws: from guardsmen upward in the Song dynasty, all could submit memorials to the court, but they merely inscribed their official positions as their titles. They did not establish separate ranks for memorial submissions outside their proper offices. The Tiantai school also introduced the *Tiger Tally for Military Deployment*, which is the imperial token for dispatching troops—how could commoners dare usurp its name?

The Tiantai school’s *Continued Compilation of Numinous Treasure Methods* newly established the *Celestial Sphere Method* and the *Azure Mystery Left Office Method*, among others. The seals they devised before and after are too numerous to recount. For example, the *Celestial Heart* method uses the *Bureau of Expelling Malevolence Seal*, which is the pivotal office of *Orthodox Unity*. All methods of summoning and invoking, with their thousand paths and ten thousand branches, ultimately converge in the *Bureau of Expelling Malevolence*. Yet the world disdains its commonplace name and often changes it to the *Bureau of Summoning and Invoking* or the *Bureau of Numinous Officials*, and so on, using their titles as seals. The names and seal scripts of the *Thunder Rites* have also grown increasingly cumbersome in recent times. Little do they realize that commanding thunder on one’s palm or summoning wind and rain before one’s eyes does not require a multitude of seals to be effective. The *Numinous Treasure* should not have reached such excess.

Now, as I, Yunzhong, have examined: the ancient texts only used the *Numinous Treasure Grand Dharma Office Seal* for conducting rites and all memorials, petitions, talismans, and decrees. The *General Memorial Seal* was exclusively for submitting memorials, and the *Yellow Spirit’s Leaping Script Seal* was for urgent petitions. Only these four seals were used. Beyond these, the *Divine Tiger Seal* was used for summoning soul banners, or one could inscribe the names of the Seven Jade Maidens in vermilion on the banner’s body—though this was not strictly necessary.

For praying to heaven and reporting to earth, establishing jiao rites and conducting fasts, beseeching rain and requesting clear skies, summoning souls and capturing ghosts, healing illnesses and investigating malevolent influences, rescuing the deceased and saving the living—the twenty-seven grades of fasts and the forty-two ranks of jiao rites, all the practices employed in the world’s affairs, are encompassed within the *Numinous Treasure*’s memorials and petitions. Only the aforementioned four seals are sufficient, with no exceptions. When one’s merit is perfected and one’s vision penetrates all, when one’s conduct is lofty and one commands ghosts and spirits, there is still no need to amass a multitude of seals.

The *Northern Dipper Jiao for Eliminating Disasters* is one of the forty-two ranks of jiao rites. From ancient times, there has been no *Celestial Sphere Jiao*, nor has there been a *Mysterious Numinous Prefecture Seal*—how can one arbitrarily add to them over time? When conducting other methods alongside the *Numinous Treasure*, one should follow the original regulations and use their respective seals. For talismans, memorials, and petitions that are jointly submitted, it is sufficient to use the *Numinous Treasure*’s proper office seal.

The *Jade Clarity Cavern Perfection* originally had no memorials or official documents. The *Numinous Treasure* is the highest rank of the middle vehicle, and all methods below *Orthodox Unity* must not surpass it. May all my fellow practitioners carefully guard their beginnings in the registers, methods, offices, and ranks.

The Three Caverns’ scriptures and registers have been transmitted and practiced in accordance with the times. Within the *Cavern of Perfection* (*Dongzhen* Department), there is the *Great Cavern of Highest Clarity Returning Chariot Complete Dao Register*, a single rank. Those who bear it are called *Disciples of the Great Cavern of Highest Clarity*. If one does not bear the register but enters the oratory to recite the *Great Cavern Scripture* and perform its practices, they are merely called *Minor Servants of the Luminous Portent*.

The *Great Cavern Scripture* consists of thirty-nine chapters and belongs to the *Cavern of Perfection* Department. It is not, as some in recent times have claimed, a matter of taking passages from the *Scripture of Salvation* and calling them the *Cavern Scripture*. As for the original rank of the *Great Cavern*, there were no official positions or memorials in antiquity. Later generations compiled methods for the *Great Cavern*, but these ultimately do not derive from ancient texts.

The *Cavern of Divinity* (*Dongshen* Department) flourished during the Eastern Han. All ranks below the *Register of Alliance and Might*, along with various miscellaneous registers, were collectively administered at the *Orthodox Unity* Altar. The *Celestial Heart Orthodox Methods*, the *Five Thunders* techniques, the texts for summoning and investigation, and the arts of written talismanic prohibitions—none were excluded from this. Their applications will not be detailed here.

Within the *Cavern of Mystery* (*Dongxuan* Department), there is the *Middle Alliance Secret Register of Numinous Treasure*, followed by the *Purple Void Yang Light Register*. The *Great Methods of Numinous Treasure* are subordinate to it. Those who bear the register but do not practice the methods are merely called *Register Ranks*. Since those who practice the *Numinous Treasure* methods conduct rites derived from it, they inevitably engage with the world and interact with others, establishing rituals as circumstances demand. Thus, official positions for the methods emerged, and names were reluctantly assigned to accommodate the needs of the time.

When submitting memorials and petitions, the *qi* is thereby unified; when delivering salvation to the hidden and manifest, titles are employed accordingly. If the register, method, position, and conduct all conflict, one risks becoming a laughingstock among spirits and deities. As Lin Shichen also stated: "Thus, five ranks of immortal positions were established to facilitate practice." From this point onward, one must cultivate without cease, accumulating merit, refining *qi*, harmonizing the Dao, and purifying the spirit. Good deeds will be recorded in the *Mysterious Capital*, and immortal names inscribed in the *Jade Palace*. The celestial offices of the heavenly realms will be conferred upon those in the human world, enabling them to propagate and expand the teachings. Feathered canopies will be bestowed in the azure heavens, and when summoned to ascend, their affairs will align with ancient and modern precedents. This arises from the fulfillment of virtue, not from presumptuously claiming lofty ranks and positions beforehand.

Those who practice the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures and methods yet seek divergent paths—such as those who practice the *Pure Brightness* method to supplement other positions—are in error. All should bear the *Middle Alliance* and supplement their original positions accordingly.

Some have taken the title *Supreme Lord Enforcer of the Law* and appended it to their ranks, which is particularly inappropriate. The *Supreme Lord* is the deity of emptiness and non-being. It is also said: "*Tai* (Supreme) denotes the utmost greatness; *Shang* (Lord) signifies the most exalted." It is further said: "Utmost greatness has no bounds; it is so lofty as to be unfathomable—hence, it is called *Tai Shang* (Supreme Lord)." And again: "There is nothing above that which can be above—this is called *Tai Shang*." The Dao is thus referred to as the *Supreme Lord of the Boundless Great Dao*, as well as the *Supreme Lord of the Dao* and *Supreme Lord Lao*. In the eighth year of *Great Central Auspiciousness* during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, the august title *Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Jade Emperor Who Opens the Heavens, Holds the Talisman, Governs the Calendar, Embodies the True, and Upholds the Dao* was conferred upon the Jade Emperor. Beyond this, the term *Tai Shang* should not be applied.

In Daoist canons, when *Tai Shang* appears alone or as *Tai Shang*, it refers to the *Lord of the Dao* and *Lao Jun*. *Tianzhong Jun* ("Lord of the Central Heaven") is an honorific title, akin to the secular appellation of the emperor. To use the emperor’s title as a subject’s designation—when the King of Qin unified the realm, he adopted the title *Huangdi* (Emperor), and later generations followed suit. Moreover, all official ranks from the first grade upward are conferred by the sovereign. Could one then style oneself *Emperor So-and-So* or *Son of Heaven So-and-So* at the head of one’s rank? The registers of ancestral altars all begin with *Tai Shang So-and-So Register*, for the talismans within the registers all originate from the *Supreme Lord*. Thus, when practitioners issue talismans for prohibition or healing, or announce the activation of talismanic commands, they may properly refer to them as *Tai Shang So-and-So Register Talisman*. This is appropriate for talismans but must never be applied to official titles.

The registers derive from the *Supreme Lord*, and their ranks are based on the registers. One cannot prefix *Tai Shang* to the head of a rank—how much less can *Tai Shang Enforcer of the Law* be placed within a title? The logic is severely obstructed. What place does the *Supreme Lord* have within a rank? In secular memorials, terms like *Imperial Ancestral Temple* or *Emperor* are written with reduced spacing. When a subject’s rank includes *Before the Emperor* or a palace name, a blank space is left, yet no one has ever incorporated *Emperor* or *Son of Heaven* into their rank. The term *Tai Shang* is akin to the word *Emperor* in the secular realm—it directly denotes the sovereign’s position and title, not a peripheral reference like *Before the Emperor* or a palace name.

If one is a *Disciple of the So-and-So Register of Highest Clarity*, the names of the *Three Pure Realms*—*Jade Clarity*, *Highest Clarity*, and *Great Clarity*—and the *Three Caverns* are used to distinguish them. Thus, register ranks may be prefixed with these names, but they cannot be inserted into the middle of a title. How can one presumptuously place *Tai Shang* within a rank and feel at ease?

A rank is the position one has attained. *Disciple of the So-and-So Register* or *Officer of the So-and-So Method* signifies that one has received this register and transmitted this method, making it one’s own title. The *Supreme Lord* cannot be attained in this way.

The *Numinous Treasure* scriptures and methods represent the foundation of all methods. The texts vary in length: some comprise twenty scrolls, others ten, and still others one hundred and twenty. Though divided into sections and assigned names, these follow the old format, and thus they are not to be discarded today.

The teachings of *Filial Piety Bright King* were transmitted to Xu Jingyang, originally as part of the *Numinous Treasure*. Later generations mixed the methods, creating the *Pure Brightness* method, much of which diverges from the original texts. Other compilations abound, each with its own strengths, and none should be discarded. The profound mysteries within the methods are to be followed according to one’s teacher’s transmission, but the ranks of registers and positions of methods must not be altered.

Some claim that *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law* is a title used by those who practice the scriptural methods. Beyond this, *Numinous Treasure* methods do not employ the title *Southern Bureau*—for the scriptural methods are the foundational methods. Today, in ritual and jiao offerings, when issuing talismanic commands, bestowing true contracts, or enacting canonical procedures, all derive from the scriptural methods.

Those who are ignorant of the origins and currents falsely claim that the *Numinous Treasure* methods used in ritual and worldly practice differ from the scriptural methods—how shallow and crude such views are. Since the inception of the *Numinous Treasure* tradition, there has never been a rank of *Supreme Lord Enforcer of the Law*. This misconception arose from the erroneous teachings of Mount Tiantai. Scholars of discernment across the land have never adopted it. Recently, some have abandoned the use of registers as ranks, instead taking the names of scriptures as their titles—this is even more misguided.

Some argue that the title *Southern Bureau* and the seal of the *Great Numinous Treasure Dharma Bureau* were later fabrications. Little do they know that these have long been established by revered masters, with proper precedents that do not violate principle, serving to govern worldly affairs and oversee the law. Compared to Mount Tiantai’s presumptuous claims—usurping titles such as *Lineage Master of the Supreme Clarity*, *Heir to the Teaching*, *Enforcer of the Law*, and *True Lord of Governance*, or falsely asserting visions of characters in divine radiance and fabricating names for oratories—are these not delusions and deceptions?

In recent times, the scriptural methods have proliferated in ranks and positions. For instance, the *Immortal Ranks*, the six military offices, and the hierarchical arrangements of titles have grown increasingly elaborate. None of these should be adopted, for one cannot assume that because they appear in the scriptural methods, they may be conferred at will, thereby disrupting the celestial order.

Some call themselves *Covenanted Disciples of the Numinous Treasure* or *Practitioners of the Great Numinous Treasure Dharma*, yet their covenants, filled with earnest oaths, remain obscure to Heaven. The *Numinous Treasure Register* and the *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law* have long been established as offices of the *Numinous Treasure* tradition, and the Supreme Lord of Highest Heaven is well aware of this. Those who bear this register and hold this office are unquestionably fit to perform its duties. Must one repeatedly petition for titles and positions before acting? Such rigid and unenlightened views are untenable.

This book has already been submitted for imperial review and must not be disregarded. The office of *Canon Keeper* exists in other traditions, but it was not originally part of the *Numinous Treasure* system. When the revered master combined the four ranks with the title *Immortal*, later disciples, feeling unworthy, petitioned the Supreme Mystery to establish the *Canon Keeper* as the lowest rank, while retaining the four original ranks for those who would later attain realization and Dao. Thus, five offices are now listed, all headed by the *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law*: *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law and Canon Keeper*, *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law and Immortal Adept*, *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law and Immortal Officer*, *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law and Perfected Adept*, and *Southern Bureau Enforcer of the Law and Perfected Officer*.

In reverence before Heaven and Earth, I have invoked the true numina and recompiled the *Great Numinous Treasure Dharma*. Among its provisions, the ranks and offices are of paramount importance. The secret formulas and numinous texts of lofty masters are now exceedingly rare to encounter, yet the ranks of registers and offices remain unparalleled in their sanctity.

In the twenty-sixth rank of the *Mysterious Constitution of Immortal Ranks* within the Mount Tiantai tradition, the following offices are established: the first rank is *Celestial Scribe and Demon-Quelling Enforcer of the Law*, followed by several others, culminating in *Jade Steps Enforcer of the Law and True Officer*, then *Ministers and Supervisors*, and finally *Vermilion Clarity Enforcer of the Law and True Lord of Governance*. Since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, such offices have never existed. The term *Enforcer of the Law* originated in the scriptural methods, where it comprised only four or five ranks. Mount Tiantai appropriated these two characters to fabricate dozens of ranks, even prefixing them with *Supreme Lord* in a bid to expand their hierarchy.

After immortals ascend, they still differ in their abodes within the Desire and Form Realms. How dare mortal flesh and ordinary corpses presume to inscribe such titles? The Three Officials and Four Saints, as exalted ministers of the Celestial Emperor, may stand upon the Jade Steps. Yet even true immortals rarely glimpse the Celestial Emperor’s face, which is often veiled by crimson clouds. How can the disciples of Mount Tiantai presume to hold office between the Jade Steps? In the earthly court, even distant ministers seldom ascend the steps of the imperial hall, let alone approach the Jade Steps to enforce the law—such presumption is unwarranted.

For ordinary people to style themselves *True Lords of Governance* is fundamentally unsound. For over three thousand years, those who have presided over the ancestral altars of the Dao have used registers as ranks and methods as offices. Mount Tiantai, however, has usurped the title *Lineage Master of the Supreme Clarity*, which is neither a rank of registers nor an office of methods. The world is vast, the seas boundless, and the *Cavern Mystery* tradition encompasses all. Is this what they call *Lineage Master*? From the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the present, among the true scriptures of the Three Caverns and the numinous texts of the Four Supplements, such a title has never existed.

The *Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity*, Zhang, was renowned in the celestial registers and served as the teacher of Heaven and humanity. His successor, Zhang of Longxi, delved deeply into astronomy, mastered the classics and histories, and established the celestial divisions for posterity—truly a rare talent of the age. He was thus called *Lineage Master*. The third generation, Zhang of Zhen’nanjun, also achieved great deeds, yet his successors were merely called *Lineage Heirs*. For two thousand years and over thirty generations since, all have been titled *Celestial Masters, Lineage Heirs of the Teaching*—implying the transmission of their teaching and the succession of their master’s position, without daring to compare themselves to Zhang of Longxi by calling themselves *Lineage Masters*.

In the ancestral altars of the *Cavern Reality* and *Cavern Mystery* traditions, those who were not of the original surname but transmitted the teaching as disciples were called *Ancestral Masters*. When the temporal ruler permitted them to transmit registers and preside over the ancestral altar, overseeing the ordination of scholars across the land, the title was justified by the weight of the ancestral altar, and none questioned it. Beyond this, whether lay or ordained, those who receive registers and practice the methods are numerous and varied—how can they casually claim the titles *Ancestral Master* or *Lineage Master*?

Recently, in the western regions of Zhe, many have presumptuously styled themselves *Ancestral Masters*—they are all sinners against the teaching. I dare not propose novel doctrines, nor expound lofty theories. In compiling this method, I follow the ancient regulations; in practice, I adhere to the scriptures. For offices conferred upon myself, I defer with humility; in conducting rituals, I stand in awe of the celestial statutes. I dare not use any talisman or incantation whose origins are unclear, nor assume any rank or office whose title carries even slight weight. My sole aim is that those who practice may swiftly attain the true Dao, and that those who cultivate realization may soon achieve ascension—nothing more.

Having witnessed those who presumptuously assume exalted offices, violating protocols and transgressing regulations, I am deeply alarmed and fearful—fearing their retribution while hoping for their swift reform.

Consider Xu Jingyang, who cultivated the true Dao across kalpas, his merit towering above past and present. At the age of one hundred thirty-six, he received the celestial decree for ascension, wherein the heavenly writ proclaimed: *"The Imperial Edict summons the Daoist novice Xu..."*—the full text, though lengthy, need not be recounted here. Even such a lofty immortal, who ascended with his entire household, was styled merely as a *"Daoist novice."* Only after his ascension was he ranked among the true immortals.

In the Song dynasty, Wang Shichen could summon wind and rain with his breath, command thunder and lightning with a glance—already possessing the essence of a divine immortal. A stone inscription bearing his handwritten *Thunder Spirit Talisman* remains in the *Divine Transcendence Celestial Celebration Abbey* of Raozhou to this day. The fine script following the talisman reads: *"Sealed by Wang Wenqing, Minor Officer of the Five Thunders."* Each character measures no more than three or four *fen*. The ancients cultivated virtue deeply, conducted themselves with reverence, claimed titles with restraint, and approached affairs with awe. They would never dare to style themselves *Lineage Masters* or *True Sovereigns*. Even if destined for ascension and ranked among the high immortals, they remained humble in their earthly days—what harm did this do to their virtue and power?

After I, Yunzhong, received the methods and advanced to the *Dongxuan* rank, I was invested with the *Zhongmeng Register*. Yet I style myself only as a *"Disciple of the Dongxuan Lingbao"* because my ancestral name, *Ming*, precludes me from assuming a formal title according to propriety. Beyond the *Zixu Yangguang Register* of the *Dongxuan* department, the highest is the *Zhongmeng Register*, also known as the *Lingbao Register* in the teaching. Thus, I may avoid violating my family taboo. Others who receive the register should properly be styled *"Disciple of the Lingbao Zhongmeng, Southern Bureau Enforcer of Ritual Law"*—this follows ancient precedent. The title *"Assistant to the Canon"* is adopted in deference to my master’s instructions, for I dare not presume the title of an immortal.

Only the *Zhengfa of the Five Bureaus of the Tongchu*, belonging to the *Dongshen* department yet interfacing with *Dongxuan*, may be concurrently held in one’s title. All methods below this rank, though practiced, should not be included in one’s official designation.

Within the *Huayang Grotto-Heaven* of the Three Maoshan in Jinling lies the *Immortal Capital*, which houses the *Tongchu Bureau* and the *Xiaojian Palace*—reserved for male immortals who have attained the Dao—and the *Yiqian Palace*, for female immortals who have done the same. None but the highest-ranking immortals may enter. The Celestial Emperor appointed the Four Saints and the Heavenly Master as *Hereditary External Ministers of the Teaching*, bestowing methods to save the world—hence the name *Five Bureaus*. Beyond the bureaus lie the *Yizhi* auxiliary halls, which administer their affairs and serve as the esteemed abodes of immortals within the celestial halls. These matters are recorded in the foundational texts of the method and in works such as the *Zhengao*.

Among the immortal ranks of the *Five Bureaus*, there are seven grades—unlike any other worldly methods. Though the *Five Bureaus* transmit their methods to the mortal realm, the *Yizhi* remain the celestial offices of the grotto-heavens, existing in truth. Only true immortals may hold positions there. Mortal officials of the terrestrial realm may provisionally assume titles such as *"Provisional Right-Soul Administrator of the Tongchu Bureau"*—they dare not formally accept immortal offices. The seven positions within the method are likewise reserved for true immortals.

Though the *Lingbao Great Method* is exalted, those who administer its canons serve as terrestrial ritual officers. The *Five Bureaus’ Method*, though secondary to the *Lingbao*, holds its *Right Yizhi* as an immortal rank—hence the necessity of the term *"provisional."* Recently, some in various regions have been promoted to *"Outer Recorder of the Cinnabar Terrace"*—do they feel no shame in their hearts?

The *Lingbao* method comprises five ranks, and after the first five, one should not recklessly advance to titles bearing the term *"immortal"*—such designations are not easily assumed. Many in the world who have not yet entered *Dongxuan* yet perform *Ascension and Salvation* rites often concurrently serve in the *Southern Chang Refining Bureau* and handle *Huanglu* affairs—this is not in accordance with ancient protocols. The *Huanglu Court* is overseen by the *Three Officials*, and its seals and plaques are not to be used in the mortal world. Lin Shichen’s *Lingsu Thunder Regulations* permitted the use of the *Huanglu Court* seal for ritual practice, but this remains improper.

Lu Zhiguan, in his *Jade Hall Ritual Method*, employed *Zhengyi* register titles while performing *Dongxuan* rites—thus leaping a rank in official correspondence. To equate the Heavenly Master with the Celestial Emperor in weight is a grave error.

The titles of the *Tianxin* method and the seals of the *QuXie Court*, though not spurious, are misapplied when used to administer *Huanglu* affairs. They are far superior to the deceptive and false titles and seals employed by the Tiantai school. Those who earnestly refine their conduct and adhere to ancient protocols act with perfect propriety.

**Chapter on Repenting Transgressions and Seeking Forgiveness**

The essence of cultivating the true lies first in minimizing faults. To persist in error is to drift far from the Dao. Though one may practice talismanic methods and aspire to the highest stages of the Way, if conduct remains unchecked, how can one subdue and command spirits? How much less could one advance memorials or deliver the living and the dead? The bureaus of merit and transgression miss nothing, not even the slightest detail.

During the Jin dynasty, Xu Yuanyou retreated into the mountains and forests, diligently cultivating his mind and savoring the Dao, gradually ascending to the ranks of the perfected. Yet the Three Officials dispatched Zhou Fang and others with a vermilion tablet of his transgressions, admonishing him: *"Those who study the Dao and revere life, aspiring to be enrolled among the immortals, who nest their dark minds in the distant and reverently serve the lofty spirits—must first accumulate worldly merit, ensure no calamities or evils assail them, let hidden virtue take root, and extend benevolence to all below. Only then may they tread the path of the perfected, ascend to the Azure Palace, and have their names recorded there."* Judging by this, those who have not yet reached Xu Yuanyou’s level—how could they remain ignorant of the need to minimize faults and cultivate themselves?

For those who uphold the law, practice its disciplines, and seek immortality through the study of the Dao, it is essential to repent and redress past transgressions while accumulating future merit and diligence.

Thus, the *Xuan'gang Lun* states: "Faults are to be corrected and never repeated; merit is to be established without weariness." This is called daily renewing one’s virtue, whereby Heaven itself grants its protection. If one merely performs the rituals of repentance in word and deed while the heart lacks the resolve to examine and amend faults—if one sins in the past only to repeat them in the future, adorning the exterior while corrupting the interior—then even if one exhausts the body and wearies the form, gazing at stars and worshipping the moon, observing fasts and upholding precepts, burning incense and reciting scriptures, all such efforts will be in vain.

There are those who boast grand words to deceive the world, claiming that if no sins are accumulated and no evils committed, what need is there for repentance? Or that one should abandon the teachings and disciplines altogether—this is yet another extreme of excessive correction. The balanced and harmonious middle way, neither excessive nor deficient, calls for repenting faults in the heart, reflecting on transgressions with certainty, adhering to the scriptures and upholding the teachings, following the established rites and procedures, erasing the record of sins from the courts of the Three Officials and the Five Emperors, and inscribing one’s name in the realms of the Ten Poles and Nine Empyreans. By establishing merit without slackening and elevating the body to ascend as an immortal, one assuredly has a share in this attainment, and nothing should obstruct one’s path. Those with resolve often succeed in their endeavors.

**Ritual of Repentance and Atonement**
Except for the day following the Autumn Equinox each year, one should regularly perform this rite on the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, one’s own birthday, the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, and other auspicious occasions. Enter a quiet chamber, or a secluded place in a temple, abbey, or mountain wilderness. Burn incense and single-mindedly reflect on one’s faults and transgressions. First, sit solemnly beside the altar, deeply contemplating all actions and deeds since birth—every unwarranted fault and unwholesome act. Trembling with reverence, one reproaches oneself with remorse, baring the heart and spilling the gall, swearing never to repeat such errors. Overcome with shame, one feels unworthy to occupy this space.

Then, adjusting one’s robes and composing body and spirit, rise and ascend the altar to make one’s declaration. Where no altar is present, set up an incense table, arrange the altar cloth, and perform the rites of entry. Recite the incantation, offer incense, and follow the prescribed ritual of supplication and atonement. In the morning, begin facing east; at noon, facing south; at night, facing north. Divide the five directions, recite the appropriate repentance texts, and follow the established procedures. After the third offering of incense, perform the rites of obeisance, adhering to the natural protocol of audience.

Such matters are best conducted in secrecy, and solitary practice is preferred over elaborate ceremonies. Thus, only the texts for atonement in the four directions are compiled here, to be adapted as circumstances require.

**First, the Incense Prayer**
Dao incense, virtue incense, non-action incense, pure and spontaneous incense, wondrous cavern-real incense, numinous treasure wisdom incense, incense transcending the Three Realms, true incense of the Three Realms—filling the jeweled perch of Jade Capital, pervading the Dharma realms of the cosmos.

With this incense now offered, we reverently present it to the Spontaneous and Vast Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms, the August Emperor of the Azure Heavens, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the August Thearch of Earth, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Ten Thousand Heavenly Thearchs, the Eleven Great Stellar Lords of the Upper Clarity, the Seven Primordial Stellar Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Heavenly, Earthly, and Watery Officials of the Three Offices, the Four Saintly Marshals of the Northern Culmen, the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure, the Twenty-Eight Stellar Lords of the Four Directions, the Five Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, the Great Emperor of the Northern Yin Fengdu, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Fusang, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Marchmounts and Five Heavens, the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands, the renowned mountain retreats, the recording immortals and perfected saints, the divine officers and marshals of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the registers of the Dharma, and all the numinous officials and spirits of the Three Realms.

By the power of this fragrant cloud, may our offerings be universally extended. May jade blossoms scatter their radiance, and the ninefold *qi* congeal into mist. May the fragrant clouds rise in dense array, piercing through all the heavens. May the Golden Lad attendant of incense and the Jade Maiden messenger transmit our words to the presence of the Emperors, so that our prayers may be heard and our requests granted.

The humble servant [Name], on this auspicious day, having purified the heart and cleansed the body, beseeches the Perfected and invokes the Dao. First, we offer prayers for the imperial ancestral temples, the altars of soil and grain, and the ancestral spirits, that they may ascend to the Nine Empyreans and bestow blessings for ten thousand generations. May the present emperor’s foundation endure forever, his reign prosper and flourish. May his sacred longevity parallel heaven and earth, and his virtuous teachings equal the workings of creation. May all directions turn toward goodness, and the hundred grains flourish. May all beings with consciousness awaken to the Perfect Dao, and all boundless realms together ascend to the land of glory and joy. May the Great Teaching flourish and the true Dharma spread. With utmost reverence, we dare to present our humble wishes, venturing to address the imperial majesty. The servant’s heart trembles with awe and trepidation, overwhelmed with fear and urgency.

Then, prostrate in devotion, the servant [Name] takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions—east, southeast, west, northwest, south, southwest, north, northeast, above, and below—the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Twenty-Eight Stellar Lords of the celestial circuit, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of Heaven, the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, and all the divine immortals and numinous officials.

Next, perform three bows, then face north (at night, north is given precedence). Kneel in prostration three times.

The humble servant [Name], with devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Upper Clarity of the Numinous Treasure in the north and northeast, the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the North, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of the North, the Stellar Lords of the Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall, the Black Emperor and True Lord of the Northern Marchmount Heng, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the North, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the Perfected and Numinous Ones, and the divine immortals and officials of the Northern Realm.

We have heard that the Great Dao, in its compassion, opens the path of repentance for transgressions. The Perfected and Lofty Ones, in their transformative power, unlock the gate of atonement for sins.

Without invoking the mandate to entreat grace, how could one obtain release from transgressions and avert retribution? Prostrate, I reflect upon my foolishness, humble station, and dull, common endowment. By fortune, I have been steeped in the true wind of the Dao and have encountered the turning of its dispensation; long have I borne the registers of the law, yet have presumptuously defiled the cap and sash of office. Unable to exert myself to establish merit, I have instead persisted in sin. Unmindful of restraint, I have neglected diligent cultivation. I fear for the myriad ancestors and countless forebears of past generations, as well as for the thousand lives and accumulated kalpas of my own former existences—from the karmic causes of old down to the present life, in thought and deed, and for all within my household and among my kin—who have committed grievous evils and incurred profound transgressions, boundless and inexpressible, recorded in the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, inscribed in the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, never to be absolved, forever without release. Dreading the advent of retribution, I tremble at the sprouting of calamity. Today, with devoted life, I prostrate and confess in full, seeking thorough purification.

May the heavens bestow forgiveness, may the Dao open its compassionate mercy, may the myriad sages send forth blessings, and may the host of Perfected Ones grant felicity. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears of your servant, along with my own self, across ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives down to this day—with their towering sins and world-shaking transgressions—have their evil roots extirpated and their records of wrongdoing erased. Thus may I swiftly attain the true Dao, encounter a genuine master, and enjoy peace and prosperity in body and life, while my disciples and followers dwell in tranquility.

For those in the world, it is said: may kin and family abide in peace. Moreover, I pray for the spiritual awareness of ancestors, the ethereal forms of masters and friends, departed kin, and forebears who have passed before—may they forever dwell in bliss and eternal freedom. May the six paths and three realms, the four births and ten thousand kinds, all be delivered and transformed.

Your servant’s heart is overwhelmed with repentance and supplication.

Three bows, then turn toward the east.

Your servant [Name], with devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Upper Clarity of the Numinous Treasure in the east and southeast, the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the East, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of the East, the Stellar Lords of the Horn, Neck, Root, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, and Girl, the Azure Emperor and True Lord of the Eastern Marchmount Tai, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the East, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the Perfected and Numinous Ones, and the divine immortals and officials of the Eastern Realm.

We have heard that, as before...

Next, turn toward the south.

Your servant [Name], with devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Upper Clarity of the Numinous Treasure in the south and southwest, the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the South, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of the South, the Stellar Lords of the Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Axletree, the Vermilion Emperor and True Lord of the Southern Marchmount Heng, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the South, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the Perfected and Numinous Ones, and the divine immortals and officials of the Southern Realm.

We have heard that, as before...

Next, turn toward the west.

Your servant [Name], with devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Upper Clarity of the Numinous Treasure in the west and northwest, the Eight Heavenly Emperors of the West, the Perfected and Sacred Ones of the West, the Stellar Lords of the Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Hairy Head, Net, Turtle Beak, and Three Stars, the White Emperor and True Lord of the Western Marchmount Hua, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the West, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the Perfected and Numinous Ones, and the divine immortals and officials of the Western Realm.

We have heard that, as before...

Next, turn toward the center.

Your servant [Name], with devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, takes refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Upper Clarity of the Numinous Treasure above and below, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors of the Three Luminaries, Nine Empyreans, and Great Luo of the Boundless, the Five Venerable Lords, the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper, the sovereigns of the celestial bureaus, the countless Perfected Ones, the dark realms of Fengdu, the true numina of the ten stages, the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor and True Lord of the Central Marchmount Song, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the Center, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas, all the Perfected and Numinous Ones, and the divine immortals and officials of the Upper and Lower Realms.

We have heard that, as before...

Return to position and face the altar.

We, with sincere hearts and bowed heads, pay homage to the Supreme Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.
We, with sincere hearts and bowed heads, pay homage to the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures.
We, with sincere hearts and bowed heads, pay homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterium.

Next, we make our declaration:
We, your humble servants [names], with utmost sincerity, reverently address the Boundless Great Dao, the August Perfected Ones on High, the mighty numina of the Three Realms, and the host of sages in the ten directions.
On this day, as we repent our transgressions and seek forgiveness, entering the oratory to cultivate the true Dao, we humbly present our supplications, beseeching your great pardon.
We pray that the underworld may erase our sins, that the immortal registers may inscribe our names, that we may encounter perfected beings, and that our studies be free from demonic trials.
How could we not redouble our virtuous thoughts, deeply reflect upon past errors, and aspire to unite with the true Dao, forever abiding in its subtle shade? May the ten directions rejoice together, and may our nine generations of ancestors receive blessings.

For this supreme cause, we recite the infinite and inconceivable merits of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions.

Next, exit the chamber as per the usual protocol.

The *Natural Audience of the Numinous Treasure* begins with invoking the sages, followed by paying homage to the ten directions, then the three prostrations of repentance, and finally the dedication of merits. The present *Five Directions’ Atonement* is an extension of the *Natural Audience of the Numinous Treasure*. Limiting it to the five directions is valued for its simplicity and ease of practice. Omitting the jade tones and Sanskrit chants is prized for its profound silence, which fosters resonance with the divine. All Dao-cultivating adepts, regardless of the rank of their registers, may perform this rite. With prolonged practice and deep introspection, sins will be eradicated, blessings will arise, and one will attain perfection and the Dao.

**Five Grades of Hidden Merit**

The scriptures state: When constellations deviate from their courses, the sun and moon lose their clarity, the four seasons fall into disorder, yin and yang fail to harmonize, the sovereign faces calamity, warfare erupts on all sides, pestilence spreads, and the multitudes perish—when teachers and friends pass away prematurely, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

This embodies the original intent of the scriptures and the fivefold efficacy of such practices. The method requires establishing a Numinous Treasure altar, gathering fellow practitioners, drawing pure water from the nine directions, and storing it in vessels of gold and jade—nine tripods inscribed with the names of the nine wilds and the nine provinces’ astrological divisions, buried in the pattern of the Three Dawns. Gold, jade, and quartz are used to fashion the symbols of the sun, moon, and five planets, which are then buried upon the altar.

Through steadfast practice, one observes the waxing and waning of calamities. The altar grounds must be purified, and the offerings favored by the divine prepared. The five types of disasters and misfortunes are recorded and presented to the high Perfected Ones of one’s affiliation. When the cinnabar heart aligns with heaven, the five merits are accomplished, and ascension is attained—this is called *hidden merit*. If divulged to outsiders, the merit is nullified. Such matters are prized for their secrecy and must not be disclosed to others.

**The Numinous Treasure Altar**

Select pure, uncontaminated soil, free of impurities and gravel, untainted by battlefields, execution grounds, slaughterhouses, or livestock pens. Construct a three-tiered altar.
The lower tier is square, nine feet on each side, and one foot two inches in height.
The middle tier is octagonal, seven feet in diameter, and one foot two inches in height.

The upper tier is circular, five feet in diameter, and nine inches in height.

Within the altar’s three tiers, arrange the sacred ranks and all requisite offerings.

**Altar Configuration**

**Celestial Bodies in Discord, Sun and Moon Losing Their Regularity**
This refers to the five planets encroaching upon one another, the nine luminaries straying from their paths, inauspicious stars emitting radiance, comets and broom stars flaring, lunar lodges moving out of sequence, celestial order disrupted, the sun turning pale and dim, the moon deviating from its course, or eclipses, obscurations, and halos of ill omen.

*Upper Tier*
The sacred ranks within the altar follow the presiding deities:
Heavenly August Emperor, Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, True Lords of the Five Directions and Five Emperors, Lords of the Eleven Luminaries, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct.

*Middle Tier*
Lords of the Three Terraces and Canopy Stars, Lords of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodges, Three Official Emperors, Four Sacred Perfected of the Northern Culmen, Ten Directional Flying Heavenly Divine Kings.

*Lower Tier*
Great Spirits of the Eight Trigrams, Earth Deities of the Nine Provinces, Great Spirits of the Five Prisons, Twelve Monthly Generals, Twelve Hourly Wardens.

**Seasonal Disarray, Yin and Yang Out of Harmony**
This refers to spring enacting autumn’s decrees, summer frosts, winter thunder, incessant rain or drought, or qi and seasonal signs falling into disorder.

**Deceased Teachers and Friends**
Those who impart even a single virtuous teaching are teachers; those who share even a morning’s study are friends. Transmitting the Dao and continuing the Dharma, united in purpose and bound by the same gate, their bond equals that of heaven and kin, their affection transcending life and death. After their passing, one should seek to perform posthumous rites, constructing a Yellow Register Altar as appropriate to the occasion. The procedures follow the methods of ascension and deliverance, which are detailed later and thus not repeated here.

**Three Dawn Symbols**
For the sun, use gold; for the moon, use jade. If lacking, substitute with silver, each one inch in diameter and shaped accordingly. For the five planets, use five-colored quartz, small as pellets. Bury each in the soil of the altar’s upper tier, nine inches deep. The sun is placed to the left, the moon to the right, and the five planets in their respective directions.

**Offerings Favored by the Perfected and Celestial Lodges**
Pipa lutes, phoenix flutes, seasonal flowers, fresh fruits, mountain spring water, pure rice, or five-colored grains dyed in five hues; green wood incense, spikenard, rush incense, fine tea, large jujubes, five-colored banners, five-colored embroidered silks.

**Offerings Favored by the Great Monad**
These are the Ten Divine Great Monads—commonly mistaken for comet stars, which is incorrect. Arrange ten positions within the altar:
Perfected Lord of the Five Fortunes Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Fundamental Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Great Wandering Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Lesser Wandering Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Heavenly One Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Earthly One Great Monad, Perfected Lords of the Four Divine Great Monads, Perfected Lord of the Direct Attendant Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Ministerial Fundamental Great Monad, Perfected Lord of the Popular Fundamental Great Monad.

Bamboo bows, reed arrows, talismanic armor and horses, soldiers, saddled horses, wooden swords, spears, blades, and halberds; scarlet and black paper money, five-colored silks, seasonal flowers, fresh fruits, fine tea, mountain spring water.

All offerings should be pure and immaculate.

**Nine Cauldrons**
Entrusted to the Two Officials within the altar:
Dawn Thorn Two, Stalwart Beam Seven, Treasure Harmony Six, Metal Yang Nine, Tripod Predict Five, Pleiades Ji One, Bronze Xu Four, Pole Star Qing Three, Azure Yan Eight.

In antiquity, cauldrons of gold, jade, bronze, and iron were used, but if these cannot be distinguished, substitute with new, clean ceramic vessels that can hold water, each fitted with a lid. Inscribe the names of the Nine Cauldrons in cinnabar on the exterior and the names of the Nine Provinces on the interior. Place them in the eight directions of the altar’s middle tier, arranged according to the Nine Palaces, with only the central cauldron of the Fifth Palace positioned beside the Second Palace. First, present prayers and memorials to the presiding Celestial Emperor, then submit petitions to the Three Realms’ numinous spirits within the altar. Next, draw pure spring water from the nine directions and pour it into the Nine Cauldrons. The Dharma Master orally presents the circumstances, then covers the cauldrons with their lids. Additionally, set up a separate pure mat, arranging offerings according to each deity’s preferences, and prepare ritual objects, seasonal flowers, and fresh fruits. Burn incense, light lamps, and make offerings in accordance with the proper method. Gather those of like mind and shared purification, virtuous practitioners of good conduct, without regard to number, to unite in purpose and collaborate in the fast and vigil, purifying the altar and cleansing away defilements.

Having submitted memorials to the local earth deities and spirits to guard and protect, one then rectifies the mind with utmost sincerity, focusing thought with unwavering devotion, all in accordance with ancient canons, and recites the *Wondrous Scripture of Salvation, Upper Chapter*. Incense is offered in the six ritual periods, the scripture chanted ten times through, so that the cinnabar heart pierces the Nine Ultimates, and a single thought reaches the Ten Directions—this is no mere mundane recitation as commonly practiced. If one is not the right person, if virtuous deeds are not gathered, if the mind wanders to the dusty chambers of the world while the mouth recites the scripture of the Most High, then even after days and months of accumulation, even after ten thousand repetitions, it shall still be difficult. When merit is perfected and virtue accomplished, the Nine Cauldrons are opened for inspection. Now, the cauldrons hold water, covered above, and if it remains clear and still as at first, this is the natural principle. Should there be even slight turbidity or other unusual signs, these are transformations of the ritual’s efficacy, reversals of the norm, all deemed ominous. From this, one may discern the impending calamities and dangers in the corresponding celestial divisions, which have not yet been fully resolved. Such was the pure sincerity of the ancients, who attended even to the finest distinctions. Some might say that redness portends a certain event, turbidity a certain disaster—this is but the petty art of shamans, not the grand purpose of the scripture, which above dispels heavenly disasters and below averts poisonous harms.

The ritual of offering incense follows its own established form. The exalted perfected ones arrayed within the altar each occupy distinct positions, as with the Eleven Luminaries each assigned to eleven stations. To conflate multiple positions into one inscription is not the ancient method. The scripture states: when performing the fast, offering incense, and reciting scriptures, one must adhere to the proper method of the fast. To approach antiquity more closely, one may perform the *Natural Audience of the Numinous Treasure*, which is also permissible, as it is the origin of the fast’s method.

Yunzhong notes: The scripture says: when the stellar lodges fall into disorder, when the sun and moon lose their proper times. Or when the four seasons lose their order, when yin and yang fall out of harmony. Or when the ruler of the state faces calamity, when warfare arises on all sides. Or when pestilence and poison spread, when the multitudes perish. Or when teachers and friends pass away—all these are occasions when one should perform the fast, offer incense, and recite scriptures. In an older version of a *Numinous Treasure* ritual, each line was treated as a separate section, divided into nine matters, closely examining the scripture’s intent. The first four clauses each consist of two lines of eight characters, their meanings interconnected. Beneath every two lines, it is said: "offer incense and recite scriptures." Only the line concerning the passing of teachers and friends stands alone, yet it too says: "offer incense and recite scriptures." Thus, nine lines are structured into five clauses. Therefore, the text transmitted by Master Yunzhong establishes a single *Numinous Treasure* altar, yet divides it into five ranks of sacred positions. Excluding the clause on the passing of teachers and friends, which follows the rites of transcendence, the four ranks of sacred positions have already been memorialized above—these are the five grades, derived from the scripture’s intent and the master’s transmission.

Li Shaowei says: The fast refers to the *Yellow Register* and other fasts, the five-scripture offerings of pacification and gratitude—these are no ordinary worldly fasts. The thrice-daily memorials move heaven and earth, summoning blessings and averting disasters. This altar is round above, octagonal in the middle, and square below—this is the *Numinous Treasure* altar. In ancient *Numinous Treasure* rites, altars were constructed with mud walls, and jade liquid was poured to memorialize the Emperor; their altars followed this same form. This accords with the original method of the *Numinous Treasure*, and its rituals are conducted throughout the year, not as mundane practices commonly performed. Its purpose differs from the immediate relief sought in disaster aversion and calamity transformation, and thus it is not included here.

The *Tiantai* method records this disaster-aversion and pacification rite within the "Deliverance from Calamity and Disaster-Dispelling" section. At its outset, it details the talismanic script of the Fire Bell, invoking qi to perform exorcistic healing—though its oral instructions remain unclear. Yet the original method’s refinement of the *Primary Jade Register* for youths bears no connection to this. Next, it prescribes scripture recitation on the eight solar terms, aligning with the Nine Palaces to safeguard and avert disasters across the Nine Provinces’ astrological divisions. This derives from ancient texts wherein scholars, following seasonal observances, wore talismans and practiced self-cultivation—a vestige of earlier traditions. Further, after reciting scriptures in the Nine Palaces, one is instructed to turn south, then east, and rotate a brick ten times—all of which deviates entirely from the original intent.

Moreover, while this *Numinous Treasure* altar is called the *Three Heavens’ Unified Qi Altar*, the three-tiered square altar of the *Yellow Register* is also termed a *Numinous Treasure* altar. This may stem from distinct sources, yet it does not emerge from the *Numinous Treasure’s* original method. Additionally, on the Lower Prime Day, an altar is erected, nine tripods are arrayed, and clear spring water is heated to a boil and poured into the tripods—such practices were never employed in antiquity. Most of its procedures diverge from ancient liturgical codes. Only the disaster-aversion rites performed on the Lower Prime Day, wherein the abundance or scarcity of water in the nine tripods—or the appearance of the five colors—is used to divine which of the Nine Wilds faces impending calamity, constitutes a form of divination applied *before* signs of misfortune manifest. This, at least, retains a commendable intent. Yet it should be conducted as a separate rite.

What is overlooked is that the scripture itself enumerates these five conditions, all of which require incense offering and scripture recitation. The subsequent chapter states in summary: "Whoever possesses this scripture may perform these meritorious deeds for the Heaven and Earth, the Thearchs, and the myriad people. On days of calamity, if one resolves to fast, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times, all the heavens will record their name." The scripture’s intent is that the revolutions of Heaven and Earth, like the fortunes of sages and divine persons, are subject to decline. When misfortune looms and disasters begin to stir, one must act to rescue and resolve them according to the proper methods. Among these five categories, nine conditions represent the gravest calamities; by erecting altars and supplicating in accordance with the afflicted domain, boundless merit is accrued.

If one claims to preempt misfortune before it arises and forestall disaster before its omens appear, this is indeed virtuous—but it is not the prescribed practice. To treat it as routine dilutes its purpose, fundamentally contravening the scripture’s original intent. Thus, all its procedures, terminology, and doctrines diverge from the text. In the present compilation, the original scripture serves as the foundation, and ancient methods as the standard; no deviation from the scripture’s words in the name of "method" is permitted.

*The Salvation of Life and the Yang Virtue*, compiled by Jin Yunzhong of the Right Auxiliary Office of the Southern Bureau of Ritual Enforcement under the Master of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure—Section Seven of the Eight Latitudes

How vast is the virtue of generation! The Dao delights in life, and thus generates heaven and earth. Heaven and earth delight in life, and thus generate the myriad things. Once born, man holds life as paramount. The divine immortals and superior scholars who study the Dao and cultivate the true, however, recoil at the burden of this illusory body. The world, failing to fathom their intent, assumes that practitioners of the Dao hold life in no esteem—this is not so. Those who attain the Dao do not cling to form or stain themselves with worldly desires; their original singular thought abides, serene and solitary. Thus, when they retain their form, it does not drift with worldly entanglements. When they shed their mortal coil, they do not perish with it. Their spirit refined and qi settled, they transcend the mundane and enter sagehood—yet when they glance back at this corporeal husk, is it not a burden? As Lord Lao said: "My great affliction is that I have a body." The Perfected of the Great Ultimate also praised: "Discard the body, yet the body remains." Both express this truth. For worldly men, it is otherwise: while the body endures, the spirit endures; while the form persists, sincerity persists. Once the body collapses, the hun and po scatter in disarray—some sink into darkness, some plunge into abyssal obscurity. Such death cannot be reversed. Is not the life already granted a joy? To crave life and abhor death is the common sentiment of past and present. The ceaseless generation of life is the fundamental principle of heaven and earth. Thus, the August Emperor, pitying the world, bestowed teachings and established rites to succor the distressed, uphold the imperiled, expel demons, and dispel delusion. Through memorials and jiao rites, blessings are invoked to prolong life—all to magnify the Dao’s virtue of generation and fulfill the people’s wish for life unending.

The ancient methods of the Numinous Treasure tradition include the *Salvation of Life and the Yang Virtue*, a practice of jiao rites and petitions to the Dipper Stars for life extension and salvation of destiny. Yet without receiving the proper writ, such matters are difficult to advance. Though this is a virtuous act of salvation, it cannot be concealed—hence it is called *Yang Virtue*. According to the ancient rites of the forty-two grades of jiao, the twentieth is the *North Dipper Jiao*. The present method establishes the *Mystic Pivot Numinous Altar*, with the North Pole Imperial Throne at its center, the host of perfected ones arrayed before it, encircled by the Northern and Southern Dippers. Its practice closely resembles the *North Dipper Jiao*. For the Dipper in the heavens is truly the master of the celestial pivot, bearing immense significance. Petitions for life extension and pardon are particularly under its purview. Thus, scholars must deeply embody the original intent of *Salvation of Life*, aligning with the ancients’ purpose, so that this rite may be properly conducted.

The method states: Within the mountains, rivers, and seas of the Lower Realm, amid cities, villages, and hamlets, dwell the spirits of water, stone, birds, and beasts; the unbalanced deities of the Five Phases; the fierce and malevolent ghosts of the lower earth; the hun of specters, demons, and baleful curses—all act wantonly, perpetrating strange and heterodox deeds, entangling and deluding the living, beyond remedy. Or within the Northern Darkness of Fengdu, the impure deities of blood and flesh, bound to ancestral spirits, the recently deceased, and both inner and outer kin, may stir lawsuits in the nether courts, extending misfortune to the living, compounding calamities—all beyond resolution. By erecting the *Mystic Pivot Altar of the Three Luminaries* upon purified ground, prayers are answered, and peace is restored.

The *Mystic Pivot Altar* is also called the *Three Luminaries Altar*. Select a secluded chamber or an open, quiet wilderness, and upon purified ground, construct an altar. Each tier rises one foot in height. The upper tier, two feet wide, centers on the *Central August Palace*, where the *North Pole Great Emperor* and *Heavenly August Great Emperor* are enshrined. The middle tier, three feet wide, arrays the *Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper*, the *Southern Dipper*, the *Three Terraces*, and the *Sun and Moon*, all with lamps lit according to their celestial forms. The lower tier, six feet wide, arranges the *Generals of the Three Primes*, the *Twelve Earthly Branches*, the *Grand Year Star* of the current year, the *Envoys Qingyang and Tuoluo*, the *Four Duty Officers*, the *Earth God*, and other deities. Before them, a *Cavern Tablet* is placed, inscribed with the names of the two Dippers. Lamps are lit, and five-colored threads extend from the Dipper’s mouth to the tablet below. Following the rites, petitions are submitted to address hidden transgressions, concealed faults, and veiled sins; to harmonize the year and destiny; to dispel disasters; to purify the human realm; and to quell demonic disturbances. The responses are extraordinary, profoundly efficacious and divine.

If constructing a soil altar is unfeasible, use white clay to draw three tiers upon the ground and perform the rites accordingly, though a permanent altar is preferred.

**Flying Dipper Rite**: On a large paper *cloud-horse*, inscribe the talismans of the Northern and Southern Dippers in cinnabar upon the blank space of the saddle. For each stellar position, present one memorial and one horse, offering them star by star. The horses should appear galloping, as if soaring in flight. If a carved block matching the design is available, hire artisans to paint them.

**Northern Dipper Talisman for Harmonizing Year and Destiny (Life-Giving and Death-Averting Array)**:
Reverently invoke the *Five Star Spirit-Responding Lords* to harmonize the year and destiny of [Name].
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Original Celestial Worthy commands!*

Below the talisman, inscribe:
[Name], born on [year, month, day, hour], under the governance of the [specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, humbly confesses lifelong hidden sins and seeks pardon.
Write in three or five lines, then burn over the lamp flame.

**Talisman of the Two Dipper Star Lords**:
[Illegible characters]...

**Seven Primes Secret Transmission Talisman: Flying the Spirit**

First, pace the Northern Dipper, entering from the Dipper’s handle to its mouth and proceeding to the *Piao* star. Visualize the Dipper enveloping your body, then pace again into its mouth. Bow three times, meditate to project your spirit, and ascend directly into the Dipper. Summon the *Four Direct Envoys*, clearly stating the purpose of the offering. Witness your spirit’s entry into the Dipper.

Next, observe the *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo* Envoys descending to inspect the altar, then returning to report to the stellar perfected ones. The ritual master stands within the Dipper, awaiting their return.

Once complete, proceed to the Southern Dipper, following the same procedure as for the Northern Dipper. Witness the *Fire Bell Generals* and the *Six Star Lads* inspecting and reporting back. Thereafter, the Dipper stars descend. After a while, purple clouds and rare fragrances may appear, or crimson light may enter the chamber—this signals the descent of the Two Dippers. Avoid the presence of monks, nuns, mourners, women, chickens, or dogs.

Before the altar, arrange a table with lit lamps and candles, along with fresh seasonal fruits, sweet wine, and rare incense—avoid sandalwood and frankincense. If pure wine is unavailable, substitute with *xuanshui* (sacred water), ensuring utmost purity. Follow the rites to present petitions and announce the proceedings. Offer memorials, paper money, and horses, burning them in the fire. With utmost sincerity, all calamities will be dispelled.

This transmission of the *Numinous Treasure Great Rites* is an ancient text from the Central Plains. The present compilation strictly adheres to the master’s teachings, without daring to alter them. Generally, if a matter aligns with principle, there is no need for debate or distinction—how could one speak of divergent schools? Yet, as the Tiantai tradition has spread widely, many of its doctrines contradict antiquity. Its methods differ greatly from other schools. If left unexamined, people will inevitably doubt and hesitate, unsure of which path to follow. Thus, this account is offered out of necessity.

Where other texts differ from Tiantai, their divergences are noted. Where Tiantai aligns with other texts, its claims are verified. This is not a fabrication by Yunzhong without masterly transmission, nor an appropriation of Tiantai methods to compose a text. Moreover, Yunzhong’s compilation and practical applications retain many ancient forms not recorded in Tiantai methods.

The *Mysterious Pivot Petition* in the *Numinous Treasure Rites* is titled the *Life-Saving Yang Virtue Section*; its placement here follows the original text. Since Tiantai’s Du Dazhen established the *Xuanji* method, he favored novelty in every matter. Disregarding the ancient *Northern Dipper Offering* rites, he invented the *Mysterious Numinous Xuanji Prefecture Seal*, appointing *Inspectors* and claiming authority over the *Xuanji Prefecture*. Those who receive his teachings today violate both the celestial statutes and worldly propriety, offending both heavenly principle and human sentiment. Yunzhong has already discussed this in detail in the general preface.

Thus, one should adhere to the ancient rites, simply calling it the *Northern Dipper Offering*. The officiant should use their proper title and seal according to their tradition—such as employing the *Qu Xie Yuan* seal in the *Orthodox Tianxin* rites—without altering titles or modifying seal inscriptions. If one avoids calling it the *Northern Dipper Offering* and invents another name, even obscure designations adjacent to the Northern Dipper may be exploited to deceive the world. This risks reducing the matter to riddles like the "yellow silk, young woman" on the reverse of the *Cao E Stele*, later trivialized by commoners as guessing games. Distorting proper rites and forcing interpretations is mere child’s play. To thus profane the perfected ones—can one’s heart be at ease?

Furthermore, in documents submitted to the Dipper stars, which share the same protocol as the Celestial Thearch, some affix seals and label them as "Memorials to the Nine Mornings Jade Gate." This is an egregious usurpation of celestial decorum. Only the gates of the Three Clarities and the Jade Thearch may be called *Jade Gates*; the Dipper stars dare not presume such a title. From the stellar realm’s perspective, the *Purple Tenuity Enclosure* is well-documented. *Enclosure* refers to a walled garden or screen. Here, seven stars flank each side, with the *Canopy* covering above. The *North Culmen Great Thearch* and the *Celestial August Thearch* reside within, and the gap at its front is called the *Gate of Heaven*—this is the *Jade Gate* of the *Purple Tenuity Enclosure*. The Northern Dipper, however, lies before the *Gate of Heaven*, serving as the pivotal constellation, the throat and tongue of governance, issuing decrees and overseeing the four directions. Even the *Minister of State* in the mortal realm is called the "throat and tongue" of the court. The Dipper is the great minister of Heaven’s plenitude, its office most vital, its authority most weighty. Yet it cannot be revered as the Celestial Thearch, just as the *Minister of State* cannot be equated with the Son of Heaven. To call the Northern Dipper the *Jade Gate* is a grave usurpation and error.

Du’s lineage initially prized unconventionality, valuing the strange and novel, but ultimately strayed into ritual impropriety and discourtesy. Those who imitate such practices risk adopting an irreverent demeanor.

The Northern Dipper is also called the *Central Dipper*. When the rites pair it with the Southern Dipper, this follows the *Southern Dipper Scripture*. In truth, the Southern Dipper is the *Dipper* mansion among the Twenty-Eight Constellations, located in the northeast of the heavens. Though also called the *Southern Dipper* in astronomy, it cannot be paired with the *Central Dipper*. The ancient rites remain unchanged here, and this compilation dares not alter them.

**End of Scroll Twelve of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Rites***

**Scroll Thirteen of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Rites***

*Compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Right Attendant of the Initial Office of the Divine Youth, under the Authority of the Southern Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Dharma Masters*

**Section on Salvation and Refinement of Suffering Souls**

It is respectfully noted: the methods of the Middle Vehicle are the Dao of the Nine Perfected of the Cavernous Mystery. They originated with the Great Dao Lord of the Highest Clarity at the beginning of the *Yan Kang* kalpa, emerging from the Heaven of Yu Yu. Their scriptures comprise the eleven divisions of the *Cavernous Mystery*. By the second year of *Guang He* in the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, Xu Laile, transmitted thirty-six scrolls of the *Highest Clarity Treasure Scriptures* and thirty-seven scrolls of the *Numinous Treasure Admonitions and Precepts* to the Immortal Elder Ge Xuan, later known as the Left Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate. From this point, the teachings of the *Cavernous Mystery* and the Dao of the *Numinous Treasure* were widely illuminated in the world, and the Immortal Elder truly became the master who transmitted the teachings.

In recent times, the methods of ritual refinement and salvation have all been attributed to the "Refinement of Immortal Elder Ge." Some even omit the title "Immortal Elder" and refer to them simply as the "Supreme Ultimate Refinement," which is particularly unreasonable. For the Supreme Ultimate arises only after the Limitless, marking the beginning of Heaven and Earth—it cannot serve as the name of a ritual text. If one speaks of the "Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate," this refers to Master Xu; if one speaks of the "Left Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate," this refers to Master Ge. Without the titles "Immortal Elder" or "Perfected," the term "Supreme Ultimate" must not be used alone in this context.

Upon examining the texts attributed to the "Refinement of Immortal Elder Ge," all schools take the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven* as their foundation. However, their liturgical forms and language are entirely modern in style, differing from the ancient rituals of the Immortal Elder. Often, people hear that the Immortal Elder once performed rituals to aid ghosts and achieved merit, so they adopt his name and compile books accordingly. Yet they fail to recognize that the Immortal Elder lived in the Eastern Han, and his literary style does not match that of today. Nevertheless, if the existing methods adhere to the canonical forms of the tradition, what harm is there in employing them? Why insist on inventing new names to achieve salvation?

If one’s will is pure, thoughts composed, form and spirit solemn, and devotion sincere, then responses will follow one’s sincerity. But if one approaches the matter with negligence, thoughts straying and intentions awry, even if one personally receives the jade words of the Heavenly Worthy, it will be difficult to extend grace to the dark realms. Records from past and present, witnessed and heard, show that many have succeeded through these methods—scholars should devote themselves to their study.

The ritual refinement texts I have seen number in the dozens. Though their general principles are similar, their invocations and vernacular prayers are often discordant, and their cadences vary, making them difficult to recite during rituals. The talismans and incantations compiled here are all drawn from the various methods of the *Numinous Treasure*, conforming to the orthodox methods of the *Celestial Mind*. All may be employed, while the opening invocations and ritual language are my own compilation, intended to broaden their application without becoming rigid.

If one wishes to report to the Emperor on High and notify the underworld bureaus at the outset, one should state the matter plainly, expressing only the intention to perform the ritual refinement for lonely souls. To claim adherence to the "Great Refinement Method of Immortal Elder Ge" or the like is groundless, for this is but one practice within the tradition.

Those who practice should distribute talismans and medicines to aid the living, and perform rituals to refine and succor the suffering souls of the dead. What matters is unwavering dedication over time. Many in recent times undertake this practice, zealous at first but negligent later—this is the common failing.

Rituals performed on the Three Primes, Eight Nodes, Four Pardons, *Geng Shen* days, *Jia Zi* birthdays, the first and fifteenth of the month, and the seventh day of the lunar cycle are especially auspicious. However, if unforeseen circumstances intervene even once or twice, the good intention may be thwarted. Some, on the appointed night, find ghosts and spirits awaiting at the ritual site, causing such alarm that they abandon their original resolve.

To sustain the practice long-term, it is best not to fixate on specific dates but to perform the rites whenever possible. One may conduct them once a month, or two or three times, or whenever time permits, or even on fortuitous days—without adhering to rigid rules. This way, the practitioner avoids the anxiety of missed deadlines, and the spirits are not left hoping for fixed offerings. Free from constraint on both sides, the merit deepens. Without attachment or stagnation, the practice may endure.

Those who disagree with this approach may set dates and await the proper times as they prefer. In the methods presented here, memorials and official notices are omitted for simplicity. However, grand *hu* feasts for universal salvation of submerged souls should follow the original canons and are not subject to this exception.

**Preparing the *Hu* Offering**
Use one *sheng* of rice, or two to several *sheng*, according to one’s means, to prepare pure cooked rice. Avoid all impure ingredients, and assemble it into a small *hu* vessel. No wheat-based foods are necessary. Those with greater means may offer more generously. The *hu* should be prepared on the evening of the ritual day.

Three talismans, the Summoning Talisman, five scrolls of True Writs, thirty to fifty copies of the Fengdu Mountain diagrams, ten copies of the Central Scripture of Numinous Writs, ten registers of the *Lu* for Ascending to Heaven, thirty to fifty sheets of paper money, pure water, candles or lamps according to one’s means, and incense. All the above items are to be used in greater quantity as one’s capacity allows. When performing merit according to one’s means, the aforementioned should be employed.

When conducting the ritual of deliverance and refinement, rise at dawn on the appointed day to bathe and purify oneself. Maintain fasting and purity throughout the day, and at dusk, proceed with the oral memorial. First, invoke the incense:

Incense of the Dao, incense of virtue, incense of non-action, incense of pure and spontaneous fragrance, wondrous incense of the Cavernous True, incense of numinous treasure and wisdom, incense transcending the Three Realms, true incense of the Three Realms—may it fill the Jade Capital and the Jasper Metropolis, pervading the Dharma-realms of the ten directions.

With reverence and care, I now burn this incense in offering to the Three Pure Ones and the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms, the August Emperor of the Dark Heavens, the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen, the Compassionate Great Unity Savior from Suffering of the Eastern Azure Palace, the Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Azure Lad Daoist Lord of the Eastern Flowery Realm, the Primordial Lady of the Nine Numina of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Venerable Divinity Who Delivers the Dead, the True Lord Han of the Nine Heavens Who Cherishes Life, the Great Divine Marshal of the Nine Heavens, the Venerable Divinities of the Southern Office of Life and Destiny—Controllers of Records, Prolongers of Lifespan, Augmenters of Years, and Deliverers from Tribulation—the Five True Lords of the Numinous Treasure, the High Perfected of the Southern Vermilion Heavenly Realm and the Scarlet Fire Mansion, the Rulers of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Officials and Generals of the Refinement and Deliverance Bureau, the Divine Tiger Summoning Officials of the Northern Kui and Mysterious Range Mansion, and the Jade Maidens, Divine Generals, and Officers of the Celestial Hosts.

May the Heavenly Compassion deign to attend and record this offering. May jade radiance scatter its light and the ninefold *qi* congeal into mist; may fragrant clouds rise in dense array, piercing straight through the myriad heavens. May the Golden Lad attendant upon the incense and the Jade Maiden transmitter of words ascend to the presence of the Emperor, that my petition may be heard and my request granted as spoken.

I, [Name], holding this ritual rank, presumptuously lay bare my mortal sentiments, daring to disturb the celestial hearing. I reflect that though my nature is cleansed, I have long relied upon the shelter of the Dao, yet have done no work to benefit others and have accumulated transgressions against my own person. Presumptuously, I seek to deliver both the hidden and the manifest, that the submerged and stagnant may ascend and be liberated.

On this night of the present month, at [location], I have prepared pure offerings to sacrifice to the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Destinies, the Ten Classes, the Four Kinds of Birth, and all lonely souls. I intend to inscribe and enact the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven* of the Most High, the True Talismans of Water and Fire, and the imprints of the Fengdu Mountain diagrams, universally performing refinement and transformation to deliver submerged souls.

Yet I, born with a mortal endowment, have not fathomed the true principle. I humbly implore compassion and forgiveness, that I may attain resonance and communion. May the Heavenly Compassion deign to bestow the *qi* of life, permitting me to inscribe and distribute these writs. I further beseech the Heavenly Decree to command the city gods, earth deities, officials of the yin realms, gatekeepers of the netherworld, the divine courts of ancestral sacrifices, the Yellow Springs and the Barrows of the Dead, the recorders of souls, and all relevant divine authorities and subordinate officers. May they all open the gates, release the imprisoned, and liberate the condemned souls. May they be ordered to come to the altar at the *hai* hour of this night to partake in the offerings, receive refinement, and ascend to partake of the mysterious grace, returning to their original true nature.

I await the Heavenly Grace, earnestly hoping for a manifest response. With utmost reverence and awe, I bow my head to the ground and prostrate myself, respectfully submitting this memorial.

Should the Orthodox Heart of Heaven Dharma be practiced, then dismiss the Divine Tiger Generals and Scribes, and instead summon the Youths of the Supreme Mystery’s Original Boundary, the Six Jia Open-Way Envoys, and the divine generals and soldiers who command troops to assist the Dharma. The procedures for the nocturnal invocation remain the same.

Next, address the officers and officials of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Bureau. When practicing the Orthodox Heart of Heaven Dharma, one may invoke the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Evil. Today, by this decree, notify all the gods in their respective offices, the officials and officers of the Lower Prime Yellow Register Bureau for Liberation, the officers and officials of the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau, the two great generals He and Qiao of the Northern Culmen Mysterious Range Prefecture, the Seven Perfected Jade Maidens, the messengers of the Three Departments, the constable officers and soldiers, the local earth gods of the region, and the tutelary deities of the altars and boundaries. Let them hasten to the altar and report for duty.

Visualize the officers and officials of all bureaus arriving in full. Those in office shall reverently bear the sacred talismans, uphold the Great Dharma, take merit-making as their foundation, and diligently perform deliverance. This night, at the appointed place, prepare a feast to offer sustenance to the lonely souls.

Having already reported to the August Thearch and the Lofty Perfected, and issued the talismanic decrees, now summon all the officers, officials, and divine hosts of the various bureaus. Let them traverse all the dark passes and hidden prisons, the nocturnal palaces of the yin realms, the numinous mounds of the mountains and rivers, the city gods and earth deities, the Yellow Springs and the Barrows of the Dead, the recorders of the departed souls, and all relevant and subordinate places. Gather the beings of the Three Wretched Realms and Ten Classes, the Five Paths and Four Modes of Birth, as well as the wandering souls and flying spirits of the wilds without refuge, those with sacrifices and those without, those who met good ends and those who met evil, and all the lonely souls awaiting deliverance.

By the *hai* hour of this night, let them all assemble at the appointed place to await the rites of refinement and the rectification of their ranks for transcendence. Execute this with utmost urgency, and may a swift and manifest response be granted. May the grace extend to the ghostly realms, all by virtue of divine power. Hasten to comply!

Next, inscribe the talismans:
*The Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven*
This register’s proclamation may be written on the reverse or below the register:
"Liberate the beings of the Five Paths and Four Modes of Birth. Let the lonely souls and stagnant spirits depart from darkness and follow their karmic rewards to rebirth. Those in charge shall obey and act accordingly, executing the talismanic command."

On the day of the year, month, and day under the reign of *Tai Sui*, proclaimed below.

The ritual master of dharma rank, [Name], hereby performs the rites.

Sit upright and visualize the Savior of Suffering Heavenly Worthy suspended in the void, with the Greatly Compassionate, Greatly Merciful, and Greatly Benevolent Perfected One and the Savior of Suffering Perfected One standing in attendance to the left and right. Next, envision the Southern Dipper’s canopy above the crown, transforming the self into the form of a Perfected One. Then behold the Heavenly Worthy dispatching a Jade Maiden, who rides upon precious radiance, bearing the precious register and descending before you. Softly recite the central scripture once, then take up the brush to inscribe the talismanic characters, repeatedly writing the four syllables *Om Hūm Trāḥ Līḥ*. Recite the incantation aloud:

*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord,
Command this servant to enact the talisman,
Illuminating the dark prisons,
Liberating the souls of the dead.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and ordinance!"*

Prepare ten talismans in total, each inscribed according to the prescribed form. Next, inscribe one talisman each for Water and Fire. Upon completion, recite the central scripture three to five times. Fumigate the talismans over incense and enshrine them in a pure place until nightfall for use.

**Talisman of True Fire**
*Taiyang qi*, *Li* mudra, inscribed in vermilion on yellow paper.
**Incantation of the Solar Essence**
*"Essence-pearl of the Solar Soul, gleaming with verdant radiance,
Revolving rosy clouds, dark flames, and whirlwind apparitions.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and ordinance!"*

**Talisman of True Water**
*Taiyin qi*, *Kun* mudra, inscribed in black on yellow paper.
**Incantation of the Lunar Essence**
*"Lunar essence, warm and resonant as the flute’s sigh,
Fragrant and lustrous in the void’s embrace.
Graceful, empty, and numinous as orchids,
Lush blossoms entwined in elegance.
Pure gold, limpid and bright,
Glowing countenance, towering in splendor.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and ordinance!"*

**Talisman of the True Form of Mount Fengdu**
(Previously detailed in the *Refinement and Liberation* section.)

Next, hold and recite the central scripture of the *Numinous Writ* thirty times; reciting more when time permits is especially auspicious.

**Talisman for Transforming Offerings**
To be employed in the rites of the pure night.

At a secluded, open space, arrange the offering of grain. No lamps or candles should be placed near the offering; instead, set up a small table several *zhang* away—greater distance is even better. Upon this table, place an incense burner, pure water, and lamps. Proceed with the ritual. This is because offerings to spirits should not be tainted by human breath or the proximity of lamps and candles. Yet today, many place them amid bustling crowds and bright lights, which is most improper.

Next, the officiant burns incense and approaches the altar to invoke the deities. Offer incense and invoke the sacred ranks, following the same procedure as at dawn.

*"With reverence, we gaze toward the celestial mercy, beseeching witness to our covenant and deliverance. May the jade tones gather qi, and the numinous winds amass mist. May the Purple Void flourish in splendor, aiding the myriad immortals. Holding the registers and grasping the ledgers, may all assemble before the Emperor. Grant that this humble servant’s petition be heard, and all be fulfilled as spoken."*

*"I, [Name], your servant of the ritual rank, dare not shun divine punishment but venture to address the celestial throne. Humbly, I pray for your radiant gaze and distant witness to this covenant. Reflecting upon my unworthy self—a mere mortal presuming to oversee the highest transformations—I forget my lowliness and dare to present this plea. Within the Three Paths and Nine Realms, among the ten kinds and four births of beings sunk in stagnation, rare are those who encounter good fortune, and few are touched by the mysterious grace. In the stillness of the hidden gates, they long to renew themselves but find no path. In the boundless sea of suffering, they yearn for liberation but see no way. This is the consequence of their past habits, and truly, their plight in delusion is pitiable. Were it not for the august heaven’s compassion and the great Dao’s mercy, how could these sunken souls escape the yin realms?*

*I, your servant, reverently follow the true teachings, devoutly preparing this feast of offerings. I announce the talismans of transcendence and refinement, and recite the secret scriptures of the Great Brahma’s Numinous Writ, to aid the myriad kinds and universally deliver the four births. Though my earnest devotion is but a small offering, may it lift even a few from the depths of darkness. Humbly, I pray the Dao’s compassion will take note, and the celestial workings will show forbearance. May the radiance of the Two Luminaries descend in secret, and the true qi of the Five Phases be spread abundantly. Entrust me with the refining power, permit me to proclaim and enact it. Illuminate the gloom to reveal brightness, rescue the sunken and raise them to deliverance. Your servant’s heart is filled with boundless gratitude and hope for your grace."*

Bowing deeply, he kneels and prostrates himself twice, then retreats to his original position.

Next, burn the summons talisman and the true scripture for transforming spirits and calling them forth. Proceed with visualization and ritual action.

The Bureau of the Numinous Treasure’s Great Law issues its mandate to the attending officers, following the dawn ritual’s form. Summon the Five Paths’ great spirits, the local earth gods, the deities of the village and domain, the lords of the Yellow Springs and the Barrows, and all masters of the place. Hasten to the altar!

*"Having already reported to the Celestial Emperor the matters previously mandated, now swiftly gather the wandering souls and stagnant spirits from the Nine Provinces’ territories, the Five Paths, Three Ways, Ten Kinds, and Four Births. Hasten to the altar to reverently receive the offerings and refinement, partake of celestial grace, attain ranks, and ascend to rebirth. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Celestial Emperor’s law and ordinance!"*

Next, transform the offerings. Use the true scripture of the Five Paths, burning it at the four sides of the grain vessel according to one’s capacity. Visualize the life qi of the five directions descending into the vessel. Burn the talisman and blow its ashes over the vessel, scattering them into the air. In an instant, it transforms into a celestial kitchen, its wondrous delicacies filling the vessel, vast and towering. If not performing the Numinous Treasure ritual, use the *Talisman for Transforming Offerings* in place of the true scripture. Quietly recite the central scripture once for each direction.

The officiant stands at a distance and performs the summoning. If conducting the ritual alone, silently intone:

*"The Great Tenuous Yellow Banner of the Supreme Polestar,
The Numinous Pennant of the Peerless One commands.
Summon the Long Night’s Repository,
Open the path to receive the reborn souls."*

Solemnly extend the summons:

*"To the hosts of the Heavenly Path,
The hosts of the Divine Path,
The hosts of the Human Path,
The hosts of the Hell Path,
The hosts of the Hungry Ghost Path,
The hosts of the Animal Path,
The womb-born,
The egg-born,
The moisture-born,
The transformation-born,
Beneath the vast sky,
Within the Six Directions,
Those with masters and those without,
Those who embrace spirits and hold consciousness,
From the Three Ways and Nine Nights,
Of a thousand forms and ten thousand shapes,
Whether male or female in body,
Whether recently transformed or long departed,
The sunken spirits and stagnant souls—
All are summoned to come forth
And receive this deliverance and uplifting!"*

*"We have heard that the wondrous Dao lies hidden in obscurity, setting the ultimate standard through the movement of yin and yang. The supreme numen is elusive, shaping creation and dividing forms. Once the Two Modes were established, the myriad things were born, all emerging from the crucible of transformation, some returning to the sheltering canopy. Yet as the people and things multiplied, customs lost their simplicity. The age of primordial vastness faded, and the world grew ever more shallow. The vicissitudes of wealth and poverty, honor and lowliness shifted endlessly, each following its own path. The interplay of fortune and misfortune, prosperity and decline, drove them along divergent roads. The distinction between good and evil sprouted, and thus arose the separation of ascent and descent. Across the distant expanse of past and present, the silent darkness of the unseen realms stretches endlessly. If beings cannot follow their karma to rebirth, they remain bound by their conditions, mired in stagnation. Thus, those who ascend are few, while those who fall behind are many. Poverty and lowliness differ in life, but death levels all equally. Though one may have exhausted the heights of wealth and honor in life, in death, they must still escape the depths. If they did not serve in the courts of immortals, they must return to the ranks of the noble. Yet how can this be, when their merits vary in depth and their virtues differ in degree? Some, lingering in the old wanderings of Luoyang, still halt their chariots in the dark capital. Others, who held command in the military or stood among the ranks of war, knew only to exert themselves in loyalty and diligence, never sparing their bodies in the wilds. Their wives and children are far away, their sacrifices unheard. Their forms are lost, their spirits have no refuge. Some left home to study, or carried their satchels in search of teachers, seeking office and fame, only to stray from their original aspirations. Though they harbored talent and skill, their initial resolve went unfulfilled. Little did they know that the days and months would pass, and their allotted time would suddenly arrive. Others ascended the paths of officialdom, standing among the court’s ranks. Some achieved the utmost in fame and position, only to face peril; others had not yet attained high rank when their fate arrived. Some were sent as envoys to foreign lands, or took posts in distant regions, only to meet with misfortune, their lives and families lost beyond recovery."*

Some renounced the worldly dust to don feathered robes, shaving their heads to enter the gate of emptiness. They pored over the scriptures of the mysterious register, hoping to awaken to the nature of the Dao, yet though cultivation had its measure, not all could attain fulfillment. Before they could find a way to prolong their years, they feared drifting lost and anchorless. Some dwelled in cliffs and hidden valleys, concealing their traces and erasing their names, shunning the world to seek nothing, dwelling in seclusion to preserve their integrity. Who could have foreseen how swiftly the years would pass, how fleeting the radiance of life? The orchid curtain now stands empty, mourning the mountain recluse who has departed. The pine window lies silent, lamenting the scholar who has nowhere to return.

Fortunate were those born into families of wealth and nobility, sprung from lineages of refinement and luxury. Their riches burned like fire, their sensual pleasures pressed upon others, yet when the moment passed, all turned to emptiness, and looking back, nothing remained. My allotted span must end, and this form cannot be lent to human schemes. Some became entangled in speech and action, enslaved by wealth and possessions, whether as merchants or traders, ceaselessly toiling over the slightest gain. Stricken by illness or death, they found themselves forever parted from their native villages. For humans, food is life, and so farmers till the soil to survive. Their bodies drenched in mud, their feet caked with earth, they labored from dawn to harvest, barely securing their sustenance. If their wives and children were warm and fed, even in old age they might be buried and mourned in due time. Yet if their kin were left destitute and cold, their spirits would drift, unremembered and unshriven.

Some mastered a single craft, others plied the nine professions, toiling day and night, their lives swept along in the turning wheel. Those who remained in their hometowns might meet a proper end, but those who wandered far from home often died as strangers. Some, blind to the choice of livelihood, joined the ranks of butchers and slaughterers. Others, through misfortune, fell into the company of actors and courtesans. And now, faced with the illusions of this life, who can foresee the rises and falls that lie ahead?

Amid the teeming multitudes born into this world, clothed in myriad forms, there were widowers and widows, solitary elders and orphaned children, those maimed in limb or sense—eyes dimmed, ears dulled—those struck dumb and unable to speak, those so foolish they could not tell beans from wheat. Some perished from poison with no cure, others died in childbirth before the child was born. Some succumbed to epidemics, others to the punishments of the state. Some fell in brawls, where host and guest alike were slain; others were ensnared by curses, bringing harm to both sides. Some drowned in water or perished in fire, some hanged themselves or turned blades upon their own flesh. Some were crushed beneath falling stones or trees, others bitten by snakes or devoured by tigers. In life, they belonged to ten thousand kinds; in death, their fates were a hundredfold. Tombs stand in dense rows, their occupants long decayed beyond recognition. Graves pile upon graves, and those yet to come are beyond counting. For whom do the verdant mountains stand? The bright sun shines, yet it is not our day. On nights when the dew chills and the moon shines clear, lonely graves lie desolate. In lands where the wind howls and the rain darkens the sky, wives and children grow cold in empty valleys.

Some were cremated, their coffins burned, their remains scattered, never awakening to the truth of life and death, their lonely souls adrift. Their voices and faces are now distant in this world, while in the realm of the dead, suffering knows no end. The wailing of the bereaved—how mournful it is! The silent depths of the netherworld remain uncrossed. Then there are the spirits and demons, the *chimei* and *wangliang*, the yin souls of the departed, birds and beasts, insects and fish, those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—the ten classes of the three evil destinies, the five paths and four modes of birth. Across the six directions of heaven and earth, within the four seas and nine provinces, their tales cannot be fully told, their kinds cannot be fully enumerated. All the lonely souls, the myriad ghostly essences—

We humbly beseech the power of the Dao, reverently relying on the true scriptures. With solemnity and discipline, we guide and support them to come forth, to partake of this pure offering, to focus their thoughts and rouse their resolve, that together they may attend the court of the immortals, receive the blessed opportunity of this sacrificial refinement, and join this assembly of utmost sincerity. We now extend this universal summons—may they already be drawing near.

**Incantation for Offering Food**
We dedicate this offering to the lonely souls, that they may ascend the clouded paths and be reborn in the immortal realms. Recite the *Jade Clarity Benevolent Life Incantation*:
We bow to the Radiant Wisdom, the Venerable of the Void,
We bow in reverence to the Sovereign of the Profound Mystery.
You fashion heaven and earth without boasting of virtue,
Becoming the refuge for all living beings.
With compassion, you turn the wheel of the five paths,
Pitying and rescuing those who suffer in the three evil destinies and hells.
We bow to the Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Palace,
We bow to the Compassionate Father of the Six Paths.
We bow to the Supreme Venerable of Jade Clarity,
Who has transcended life and death, abiding in eternal continuity.
Emerging from being, entering the void, dependent on nothing,
You transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
An encounter once in a thousand or ten thousand kalpas is rare,
Yet for the sake of all, you broadly expound the causes and conditions of karma.
You restore the dead to life, granting them eternal existence,
Ensuring that their forms and spirits remain unchanged.

**Breaking the Prison Incantation**
In the boundless depths of Fengdu,
Layer upon layer of Vajra Mountains stand.
The limitless light of the Numinous Treasure
Illumines the fires of the scorching pools.
The seven generations of ancestors and all the imprisoned souls,
Their bodies follow the fragrant cloud chariots.
Upon the pure lotus of samadhi and wisdom,
They ascend to the eternal peace of the divine.

**Ascending to Heaven Incantation**
The golden light of merit
Gently opens the gates of the dark.
From the flower pool flows true fragrance,
Lotus canopies drift upon the clouds.
The thousand spirits return to primordial harmony,
Ever dwelling in the twelve celestial towers.
Hasten to proclaim the decree of the Numinous Treasure,
That their eyes may wander in the heavens.

**Throat Incantation**
The vast and crystalline life-breath of the Dharma arises,
Misty and dense, it congeals in the midst of heaven.
The two luminaries together shine with clarity,
The five planets interweave and connect.
The three lights blaze with brilliance,
The precious *qi* fills the three palaces.
In the imperial realm, the nine elders assemble,
Swallowing and absorbing, the hundred bones flourish.
The golden flower illumines the radiance of the scene,
Body and sun and moon become one.
Before the perfected sages of the Dao we chant,
That we may live for ten thousand kalpas without end.

**Three Lights Flowing Essence Dharma Food Incantation**
The wondrous Dao gives birth to the One *qi*,
From which *yin* and *yang* divide.
They condense to form the sun, moon, and stars,
Brilliantly flowing as the three lights.
The nine flowers merge with the nine paths,
The eight colors delight the eight chambers.
Resplendent, they reveal the true body of the Dao,
Flowing crystals return to the great radiance.
Descending to the abyssal palace of the deep springs,
Ascending to the boundless realm of non-being.
From the body, traces are no longer sought,
Suddenly, all is forgotten.
The seven treasures flow and coalesce,
Chaotic and mingled within the flower chambers.
Swallowing the nine-cloud elixir,
This joy is beyond all measure.

**Jade Yang Dharma Food Incantation**
The true *qi* of Jade Yang,
The wondrous Dao divides into the three luminaries.
The primordial harmony chants the numinous sound,
The eight assemblies spread forth the jade scriptures.
The five elders swallow the cinnabar nectar,
Lightly soaring upon the cloud chariots.

**Assembly of the Great Sages and All Heavenly Hosts**
The hosts of the Great Sages and all heavens,
Mount dragons and drink the jade nectar.
By the three and five, life’s register is fixed,
Roaming and playing in the Supreme Capital.
Radiant splendor shines boundless,
Hand in hand, they ascend to the Jade Throne.

**Incantation for Empowering the Dharma Food**
Turning back, they gaze upon the Primordial Net,
Converging luminosity to draw in the numinous radiance.
Restraining the *hun* and governing the seven *po*,
Contemplating the navel to stabilize the center.
In movement and stillness, they tread the void of non-being,
In rest and repose, they feast in the mysterious chamber.
Hunger is sated with yellow and azure blossoms,
Thirst is quenched with the nectar of the jade grove.
The divine banner commands the great demons,
Uniting the body to refine the true light.
Reflecting once more upon the great emptiness,
They wander forever within the void.
Perfect communion dissolves the waves’ bounds,
True flowers know no end.
Vast and distant, without beginning or end,
The practitioner must clearly understand.
In serene solitude, teachings are forgotten,
Yet the great pattern is fulfilled in due course.
To fathom the Dao yet not transcend oneself,
One must first enact what is to be done.
Converging at the place of no duality,
Following the heart’s intent, they unite and part.

**Incantation for Nurturing the *Hun* and Cultivating the *Po***
The divine mushroom has no root,
Yet it is the source of all transformations.
Within, the seven *po* congeal,
Above, the three *hun* coalesce.
The twenty-four Perfected,
Enter and exit without gate.
In the profound obscurity,
Flickers the primordial essence.
Through kalpas of existence and extinction,
It follows *qi* to be born.
Externally, it solidifies the undifferentiated,
Internally, it nourishes the seven Perfected.
The five spirits plant their blossoms,
The Three Terraces spread their glory.
The purple radiance and the white youths,
Return to the womb and revert to infancy.
Ascending upon clouds,
Riding mists to float in the void.
Within resides the Jade Perfected,
Named the Divine Work.
To the left, the Peerless One is embraced,
To the right, the White Prime is guarded.
The dark beast blocks the rear,
The cinnabar bird flanks the front.
Above, the emerald canopy floats,
Below, golden lotuses are arrayed.
Fragrant clouds congeal in the void,
Sweet dew knows no end.
Used without exhaustion,
Tracing the source without termination.

**High Master’s Second Proclamation**
The incantations for empowering the dharma food have been recited,
The numinous scriptures intoned.
May all who receive this wondrous grace
Be fully sated.
Now, with a single thought clarified,
Compose your original true nature,
And come before the altar
To receive this refinement and transformation.

**Next: Transforming the Fire Pool**
Burn the true fire talisman,
Place it in the incense burner,
Ignite with fragrant flames,
Recite the middle section once.
Visualize the Crimson Palace within the body,
Red *qi* surging forth,
Gradually filling the space outside the body,
Then pouring into the burner,
Transforming into true fire.
Silently invoke the Eastern Flowery Lord,
Wood Duke Azure Lad, Dao Lord of the Youths,
The Celestial Emperor of the Sun Palace of the Day,
Humbly beseeching the descent of the true yang fire
To refine the lonely souls.
Visualize the Crimson Palace descending from the void,
Pouring into the burner,
Transforming into a vast fire pool,
Fierce flames filling the sky.
Reverently summon the Refining and Salvation Officers of the Southern Prosperity,
The Fire Pool Masters,
The Fire-Refining Divine Generals and Soldiers,
To descend together,
Guiding all lonely souls of the five paths and four births
To the altar,
And into the fire pool for refinement according to the method.
Then visualize the talisman’s messenger leading the souls into the refinement.

**Fire-Refining Incantation**
Flame spirits, flame spirits,
Fire bells, fire bells.
Above, they reach the Purple Tenuity,
Below, they penetrate the Yellow Obscurity.
Expelling filth and refining souls,
By the power of the Red Emperor.
The flame essence and the two spirits,
The Three Terraces streaming with light.
Refining the embryo to transform the substance,
The *po* refined, the *hun* restored.
Impure *qi* falls away,
Riding the smoke to soar.
Dissolving *qi* and dispersing breath,
Yang *qi* harmonizes and flourishes.
Spirit and essence grow full,
Entering deeply into the fire realm.
Merging with the nine *qi*,
In perfect accord with the Void Sovereign.
By the decree of the Vast Heaven,
Molten gold scatters its radiance.
The nine origins shine brilliantly,
Enduring and flourishing without limit.
In an instant, behold the souls emerge from the fire,
Now perfected in purity.

**Next: Transforming the Water Pool**
Burn the true water talisman,
Place it in the water vessel,
Recite the middle section once.
Visualize the black *qi* of the lower field surging forth,
Gradually filling the body,
Then pouring into the vessel,
Transforming into true water.
Silently invoke the Primordial Sovereign Golden Mother of the Nine Numina of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace,
The Celestial Empress of the Moon Palace of the Grand Yin,
Humbly beseeching the descent of the true yin water
To refine the lonely souls.
Visualize the true water descending from the heavens,
Flowing directly into the vessel,
Transforming into a vast water pool.
Reverently summon the Refining and Salvation Officers,
The Water Pool Masters,
The Water-Refining Divine Generals and Soldiers,
To guide the hosts of lonely souls
Into the water pool for purification according to the method.
Visualize the officers leading the souls into the refinement.

**Water-Refining Incantation**
The Dragon Han flows boundless,
Formless and nameless.
Through countless kalpas,
The Yellow Dao shines forth.
Spirits clear and luminous,
The nine *qi* exhale their essence.
The Jade Void gleams with clarity,
The Grand Radiance soars in brilliance.
The Jade Emperor unfolds his transformation,
Universally saving heaven and humanity.
The Three Origins nurture the Dao,
The Two Images embrace life.
Withered trees and old roots,
Once withered, now flourish.
All creatures that creep and breathe,
Attain long life and transform their forms.
Those who conceive and gestate,
All achieve birth and completion.
The deceased have passed their fate,
Their souls return to the Three Clarities.
Their *po* receive refinement and salvation,
Ascending to the Southern Palace.
Today is most auspicious,
All attain illumination.
The Five Emperors reflect and witness,
Universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Heavenly gods and earthly deities,
All river sources,
The Five Peaks and Four Waterways,
All renowned mountains,
The Caverns of Mystery, Void, Emptiness, and Immortality,
The Boundless Great Sages,
The Most Perfect and Honored Divinities,
Endless and infinite,
Universally oversee the salvation of beings.
Evil roots severed,
Names recorded in the Mysterious Capital.
The hosts of Perfected array in ranks,
All heed the Emperor’s decree.
By this imperial command,
Protect those who recite and uphold it.
Guide them to the shore of the Dao,
Shielding them from calamity.
I, by the Emperor’s mandate,
Command all to heed.

In an instant, countless souls emerged from the waters, all transformed into jade-like immortal forms—pure, radiant, and flawless. This was the alchemical refinement of first fire, then water, following the ancient ritual method. Some disciples, according to their masters’ teachings or other scriptural sources, may reverse the order, beginning with water before fire, each proceeding as they find suitable, unbound by rigid adherence to the origins of water and fire.

One method employs the qi of the liver and lungs as the *Metal Mother’s* breath, aligning with *Wood Lord* and *Metal Mother*, to invoke and descend the true qi of yin and yang, serving as water and fire. Alternatively, the qi of the heart and kidneys within the body may be used, invoking the essences of the sun and moon to correspond with them—both approaches are valid.

I dare not insist on a fixed formula; let practitioners choose the most reasoned method and proceed accordingly. Recently, some have discarded the Southern and Northern Poles as the sources of water and fire, a notion difficult to reconcile with principle—this has been discussed in detail in the *Refinement and Salvation* chapter.

The High Priest again addresses the host of orphaned souls: "Now that your refinement is complete and you have been transformed into immortals, face the palace to give thanks and take refuge in the Three Treasures.

First, take refuge in the Supreme Dao.
Second, take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures.
Third, take refuge in the Supreme Master."

The host of orphaned souls, having completed the Three Refuges and paid their respects, are henceforth to align their hearts with the true Dao, never forgetting virtuous thoughts, nor straying onto wicked paths. In heaven and among men, they must uphold the precepts. Now, with reverence, I expound them for eternal adherence:

**The Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected:**
1. Be respectful and yielding, honoring and nurturing your parents.
2. Be diligent and loyal to your sovereign.
3. Do not kill; show compassion and save all beings.
4. Do not commit adultery; maintain purity in body and conduct.
5. Do not steal; practice righteousness and self-denial.
6. Do not harbor anger or oppress others with fury.
7. Do not deceive or harm the virtuous with treachery.
8. Do not be arrogant or disdain the True Ones.
9. Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

The host of orphaned souls, having received these precepts, are now graced by heavenly favor. Today, we reverently burn and offer the *Precious Register for Ascension to Heaven*, the form of Mount Fengdu, the *Middle Scroll of the Numinous Writ*, and the necessities of the underworld. Each soul is to be escorted by the deities of this altar to the bureaus of rebirth, where their ranks will be verified, and they will transcend to new life. Proceed to the altar, where your refined spirits shall undergo further refinement.

When ghosts and spirits encounter this opportunity, they should awaken, repent their past transgressions, and swiftly ascend to the clouds of today. You must now depart from the company of ghosts and earnestly seek the wonders of the Dao.

The body is born of external things, yet in life, it is not your true essence.
The spirit is the root of nature; in death, how could it perish?
Only by awakening to your original beginning can you transcend the constraints of life and death.
Your true nature is ever-present, yet the numinous is obscured by attachment to things.
The illusory body, though tangible, is ultimately empty—whether noble or base.
The yin soul, formless, cannot be burdened by hunger or cold.
It is only through clinging to sacrificial offerings that you bring upon yourselves ignorance and delusion.
If you clearly perceive your undisturbed true nature, the dark paths and nether gates will dissolve.
Free from all entanglements, you shall roam freely between heaven and earth.
Those who leave attachments behind may attain perfection; those who falter remain as lowly ghosts.
Now that virtuous thoughts have arisen, all past karmic obstructions are dispelled.
Wash away the dust and grime until all is empty; refine form and spirit until both are wondrous.

Furthermore, those who have awakened should enlighten those who have not; those who know first should awaken those who follow. The past is irretrievable—do not dwell on former affairs. The path ahead is open—proceed with care. Now, bowing toward the palace, bid farewell and depart in good order. Whether mortal or sage, advance in turn. We send you forth on your cloud-borne journey—may you journey with care.

The incense is burned, and the orphaned souls, now transformed into immortal forms of wondrous beauty, ascend into the sky and disperse.

Next, the ritual tablet is raised, incense is offered, and thanks are given to the sages. The officiant, [Name], humbly and sincerely petitions the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms:

"As in the morning rites, I reverently gaze upon the exalted Perfected, beseeching your gracious regard. Though unworthy and ignorant, I have presumptuously assumed the talismans and performed the rites of refinement for the orphaned souls. The affairs are now concluded, but my actions may have transgressed, and my thoughts may have strayed from truth. For my myriad transgressions and thousand faults, I implore your forgiveness.

With this pure offering, I extend it universally to all beings—those born of womb, egg, moisture, or transformation; those that fly, swim, sink, or float; birds, beasts, insects, fish, and all creatures—may they all bathe in heavenly grace and share in the blessings of the Dao. May those ensnared by nets, hooks, or traps forever escape harm. May those threatened by traps, abandonment, or blades escape suffering. May they shed their alien forms and return their qi to its original root.

Having already received your boundless mercy, I further pray for your enduring forgiveness. Gathering this modest merit, I first dedicate it to the exalted. May the august spirits of the altars and the ancestral deities soar to the jade palaces and wander in the celestial capital. May the Emperor of this day enjoy eternal longevity, his benevolence extending to the four seas. May the harvests be bountiful and the people rejoice; may the borders be tranquil and the weapons at rest. May auspicious signs manifest and pestilence cease.

Next, I pray for my ninefold ancestors, sevenfold forebears, the Four Companions, the Three Masters, my inner and outer kin, and all the departed—may they universally transcend to the yang realms and ascend together to the immortal lands. I further wish for myself to attain the true Dao, to study under the most enlightened teachers, and for my family, both in the mundane world and beyond, to all receive the blessings of nurturance and enjoy complete safety.

The officials and generals who assisted in summoning and refining, as well as the deities of refinement, have labored diligently—may their merits be recorded and their ranks elevated. I am overwhelmed with gratitude and can bear it no longer. For this reason, I recite the inconceivable merits of the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions*.

Next, I address the assembly: The myriad deities, officials, and generals of this altar who have labored in summoning and refinement—your merits have steadily grown, and your ranks shall be advanced. Return now to your respective posts, resuming your original positions. When summoned again, come as before, in accordance with tradition."

These rites of refinement, talismans, and incantations compiled by me are drawn from various methods, selecting only those that are simple and practicable.

The various incantations for offering food that you have employed over the years are numerous, with many variations. Here, I have selected only these eight sections, which are universally used across all traditions, so that they may be widely practiced. If certain methods exist in one tradition but not another, or if their wording differs and each claims superiority, I have omitted them to avoid confusion. As for the invocations, prayers, and dismissals, these are my humble and limited insights, presumptuously compiled. Should one desire more elegant and refined language, or prose of extraordinary grandeur, the author may freely revise them. There are those who daily offer a handful of rice in sacrifice, which is also commendable. Yet performing this every day is not easily sustained. Even after consuming meat, one may purify the mouth with an incantation after washing—this too is permissible. If one’s strength allows, and the offering is made at night with incantations, there is no need to follow the full ritual with formal invocations; one may simply proceed with the abbreviated method, which I have listed below.

**First, the Incense Prayer:**
*"In the proper ritual position, your disciple [Name] now burns incense to reverently offer to the Merciful Great One of the Eastern Palace, the Most Compassionate and Merciful Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, the Greatly Compassionate and Merciful Perfected One of Great Wisdom, the Greatly Compassionate and Merciful Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering. Humbly I beseech the Dao’s compassion to deign to look upon me. Today, I sincerely present pure food to universally offer to the lonely souls, entreating the radiance of your virtue to specially bestow deliverance. Transform this ordinary fare into boundless sustenance, universally aiding the innumerable. My heart is overwhelmed with fervent gratitude."*

**Next, recite the central passage once**, visualizing the food as vast and abundant, then summon the souls:
*"With reverence, I invoke and invite the lonely souls of the Nine Provinces, the Five Paths, the Four Modes of Birth, the Three Realms, and the Ten Classes—all wandering spirits—to come before this offering and partake of this pure sustenance."*

*(The various incantations for consecrating the food are listed above.)*

*"Having proclaimed these sacred verses and offered the consecrated food, may the suffering beings of the Three Realms and Five Pains all receive its moisture, and may the Ten Classes and Four Modes of Birth all be sated. May they swiftly transcend the shadowy realms and together ascend to the immortal lands. For this reason, I recite the inconceivable merits of the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering."*

I, Yunzhong, unworthy and coarse, have presumptuously appended this text. The merit of these rites of refinement is vast and profound, and I hope that those of like mind will steadfastly uphold their virtuous intentions, practicing them ever more diligently. The Creator of All Things will surely record their merit. Many have compiled such ritual texts before, yet none have examined them thoroughly. Even those that are flawless often include phrases like "reduced-mouth food offerings," which are vulgar and have led to the incorporation of Buddhist elements, causing confusion and misleading later generations. There was an old printed edition in which, after the offering, admonition, and dismissal, the *Tianpeng* incantation was recited once—this is particularly inadvisable. The intention was to prevent lingering souls from becoming malevolent spirits, but since ancient times, offering to spirits with goodwill has been a means to resolve grievances. Even if there are grudges, they may be dissolved through such acts; how could they arbitrarily become enemies? Heaven and Earth would not permit it. Why harbor such doubts and undermine one’s own good intentions? Once such calculating thoughts arise, even gulls will not alight—how much more so for spirits? When one’s devotion is pure, boundless blessings will follow. Unfounded precautions are unnecessary.

The compilation presented here is not for the sake of seeking fame. It adheres strictly to the teachings, aiming to benefit both the seen and unseen worlds. It seeks to convey the underlying principles so that both Daoists and laypeople may practice it together. Those who understand my intentions will not hesitate to employ it, even in part. Those who oppose my correct teachings will inevitably attract endless slander. If even the slightest benefit is brought to the netherworld, I shall not regret facing worldly disputes. The world is vast, and its people are many—how could everyone reject this?

In various traditions, the rites of refinement take the *Register for Ascending to Heaven* as their foundation. The methods transmitted in eastern Zhejiang, however, emphasize the *Yellow Qi Yang Essence Talisman*, also known as the *Danyang Refinement Talisman*. This does not appear in the ancient methods of the *Shangqing* and *Lingbao* traditions, but is found only in those attributed to the Immortal Elder’s rites of refinement. The present compilation by Yunzhong belongs exclusively to the *Dongxuan* tradition, as it pertains to *Lingbao* and is thus included among its proper methods—a matter of establishing merit, following the *Yang Virtue of Aiding the Living*.

The *Danyang Refinement Talisman* has recently become more prevalent in practice, yet in accordance with ancient forms, I have not dared to incorporate it into this method. I have already compiled a separate *Lingbao Rites of Refinement* for public use. Should one wish to include this talisman in their personal practice, they may further investigate and add it as they see fit.

*Shangqing Lingbao Great Method, Scroll Thirteen Concludes*
*Shangqing Lingbao Great Method, Scroll Fourteen*

The *Dongxuan Lingbao* Master of the Southern Bureau, Keeper of the Law Codes—Junior Prefect of the Right Wing of the Yuzhong Administration, Jin Yunzhong, Compiles:
*Dispelling Demons and Delivering from Distress*

The application of the *Lingbao Great Method* is governed by the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms, while the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions serve as its generals. Beneath each Divine King are messengers, officers, and soldiers. When summoned to suppress and rectify disturbances, a memorial is sent to the Divine Kings, who then issue orders to mobilize the officers and generals of the sacred mountains and great rivers. Once the task is complete, they are dismissed and returned to their original posts. To falsely establish generals or officers, or to privately issue names and titles, is to render the ritual ineffective in practice—a transgression against the Demon Kings’ statutes, which shall be torn asunder and repurposed as talismanic prohibitions for the salvation of the world.

The human Dao is faint and fleeting; the immortal Dao, vast and boundless.
The ghostly Dao delights in the gateway of human life.
The heavenly Dao treasures life; the ghostly Dao treasures death.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious; the ghostly Dao, ever inauspicious.

The talisman on the right is carved on the fifth day of the fifth month. Should one suffer from fox spirits, let them wear it, and the ghost will depart of its own accord. If a household has long been afflicted by strange phenomena yet the source remains unexpelled, merely divide the talisman into portions, and no further harm shall befall them.

To *seize the ghost’s eye*: press the upper joint of the right fourth finger.
Recite the preceding incantation seven times, inscribe one talisman, and place it as a seal—thereby the anomaly shall be forever eradicated.

*Method for Dispelling and Seizing*
If a household is plagued by malevolent spirits, a hundred specters, or a thousand evils that refuse to depart, press the *you* trigram, then write this true script in cinnabar, attaching it to the memorial. Dispatch the document to the Divine Kings and issue orders to the generals and officers of the sacred mountains and great rivers to capture the entity with combined force. Affix the true script with the seal, clasp the mudra, and—if the entity is a senior relative, ancestor, or bears an old grievance—assess the circumstances carefully; do not employ this lightly.

*Translation:*
O Exalted and Pure Divine Spirits,
Your mournful song resounds through the vast heavens.

Only longing for the immortal Dao’s fulfillment,
never wishing the human path to wither.
In the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs,
within the Winding Stream’s precincts,
a myriad ghosts assemble—
all bent on cutting short mortal fate,
sealing the gate of human life.

Yet when one chants the Cavernous Chapters,
the Northern Fengdu is thereby subdued.
Bound and dispatched are the demonic essences,
the six ghostly legions beheaded and vanquished.
The qi of all heavens surges boundless,
while my Dao daily ascends in glory.

*Memorial from the Great Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure*
To the Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of [such-and-such] direction:

Whereas this Bureau, having examined the petitioner’s plea and conducted a thorough investigation, finds that a certain malevolent entity has indeed wrought harm, and whereas we have already reported the matter to the Supreme August One and issued the sacred writ, it is now necessary to dispatch this special memorial.

Upon receipt, you are hereby commanded to lead your officers and soldiers in a joint descent to [such-and-such] location, to capture the demonic specter that defies Heaven and harms the people, escort it to the Celestial Prison, and punish it according to the law. Sever the demonic miasma and purify the realm. Execute this with utmost speed and report back upon completion.

Memorial issued on the [day] of the [month] of the [year], at the [hour].
[Name and title of the ritual master] affixed.

This document is to be sealed with a folded corner and delivered to the Divine Kings. Additionally, a copy shall be forwarded to the nearby sacred mountains and great rivers, to the duly ordained deities, the temple guardians, and the City Gods, so that all may convene to apprehend and adjudicate the case. The form of address—whether by memorial or by writ—shall be determined by the rank of the deity and the gravity of the matter.

*Method for Summoning the Divine Officers*
- Eastern Divine King: *Zhen* trigram, first day—*hu*
- Southern Divine King: *Li* trigram, eighth day—*fei*
- Western Divine King: *Dui* trigram, fourth day—*pu*
- Northern Divine King: *Kan* trigram, fifth day—*yun shang*
- Southwestern Divine King: *Kun* trigram, sixth day—*di se*
- Southeastern Divine King: *Xun* trigram, third day—*wu jing*
- Northwestern Divine King: *Qian* trigram, seventh day—*na yu*
- Northeastern Divine King: *Gen* trigram, second day—*du xian*
- Upper Divine King: on the thumbnail, ninth day—*jue wu*
- Lower Divine King: on the middle finger’s center, tenth day—*ying*

Each Divine King is attended by messengers, officers, and soldiers. From the first to the tenth day, each direction governs one day in rotation, repeating without end. In months with twenty-nine days, both the Upper and Lower Divine Kings are invoked on the twenty-ninth, with the cycle resuming on the first of the following month. When the Divine Kings descend to the mortal realm, all major matters may be addressed to them; for minor affairs, their messengers suffice.

*Method for Exorcism and Suppression*
When a household is unsettled, desires unfulfilled, or undertakings obstructed, one may carry this talisman on the person or affix it to the home for protection.

Lofty and resplendent is the mighty writ,
its luminous qi soaring through the four quarters.
The pure practices of all heavens
encircle the ten directions.
The boundless great spirits
all issue from my own being.

Recite the incantation seven times and inscribe the talisman.

*Method for Liberation and Deliverance*
When ancestors or forebears have become malevolent entities and cannot be seized and punished, inscribe the talisman and burn it—this is the method for dispatching ghosts as prescribed in this scripture.

In the void, ten thousand transformations arise,
polluted qi blooms like noxious flowers.
Those who preserve the true are few,
while those who stray into delusion are many.
The immortal Dao is hard to secure,
the ghostly path easy to corrupt.
The human path lies in the heart—
surely it does not depend on others.
The immortal Dao values substance,
the human path values ornament.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao,
how shall you transcend the Three Realms?
Should you wish to traverse the Five Paths,
what recourse remains to me?

Recite the incantation seven times, inscribe the talisman, and employ it for dispatching. The five methods above are congruent with the scriptural rites.

*Threefold Talismanic Method of the Upper Realm*

*The Jade Clarity Sacred Realm’s Celestial Great Emperor,
The Supreme Clarity True Realm’s Nine Heavens Sovereign Officials,
The Grand Clarity Immortal Realm’s Jade August Emperor,
The Five Directions’ Five Emperors’ Ghost-Subduing Generals,
The Direct-Binding Ghost Generals,
The Direct-Summoning Generals of True Qi,
The Five Directions’ True Lords—let their qi follow the talisman’s course,
gathering form.*

*Jade Clarity Mudra, Heavenly Gate Qi.*

Inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow paper. As the brush moves, so move the ghosts and spirits; as the brush halts, so halt the ghosts and spirits.

Reverently invoke the Supreme Primordial August Wondrous Dao True Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable Immortal Officials and Marshals, the Five Marchmounts’ August Spirits. Swiftly descend with true qi into this servant’s talisman. Wherever the talisman’s command reaches, ghosts perish and men find peace.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Three Clarities’ true talismanic command!*

Once the talisman is inscribed, recite the incantation, draw the qi of the Five Directions, and blow it into the talisman. Dispatch the talisman with a second incantation, burn it to ash, and mix with fragrant water. For all illnesses, administer three doses daily. Practice with sincerity, and efficacy will be immediate.

Once the inscription is complete, dot the eyes and recite:
*"Open Heaven, pierce Earth, illuminate and shatter demonic evil."*

Solemnly invoke the Nine Heavens’ Cloud Path Pursuit Marshals—Jiang, Zhai, Zhao, and Xu—commanding them to follow this talismanic decree, accompany the talisman front and rear, seize demonic entities, and restore health and peace.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Descending Decree commands!*

Inscribe this talisman in black ink on yellow paper. For each use, prepare eight talismans: one large talisman, burned with gold coins in the main gate; seven smaller talismans, reduced to ash and mixed with peach-heart decoction for oral administration. The response shall be extraordinary.

*"Wind and fire never cease, reverse corpse inflictions, return death to tranquility, harmonize hun and po, pacify all spirits."*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*

Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on pure yellow silk, and swallow with clear water. Nothing shall fail to be exorcised, nothing shall fail to be cured.

**Method for Verifying Malevolent Influences**
For those who receive petitions yet cannot perceive spirits and ghosts, first employ the Nine Palaces method, rotating according to the diagram. Do not use the Flying Palace or the Central Palace.

For males: begin at age one in *Li*, rotate left in sequence, completing one full turn while skipping the second palace.
For females: begin at age one in *Kan*, rotate right in reverse, completing one full turn while skipping the eighth palace.

Next, count sequentially through the palaces: from the year to the month, from the month to the day, from the day to the hour. Stop where indicated and infer accordingly, enlightening through spiritual insight—this depends on the practitioner.

This method is devised for those who have not yet attained mastery of the unseen. Ancient texts merely state: *"When reaching a certain palace, it governs a certain matter,"* without poetic mnemonics. Later practitioners, seeking ease in memorization, versified the instructions for recitation.

For those afflicted in the *Qian* Palace, their lives are beset by calamities,
Cold and heat alternate, maladies come and go.
The haunting is from kin or external spirits—
To seek deliverance, perform rites and offer sacrifices to cross the Yellow Springs.
Curses from ancestral tombs arise in the northwest,
Old vows and past pacts press the gods to hasten.
There are also those who met violent ends, maddened ghosts of sudden death—
Offerings must be made to sever the roots and break the barriers.

For those afflicted in the *Kan* Palace, weakness and stupor prevail,
Haunted by dark-clad spirits and the Stove God.
Cold and heat strike at times, with frequent abdominal pain,
Their forms are short and stunted, their births bring harm.
Heavenly spirits hold unfulfilled vows, their original intent betrayed,
Tigers, dogs, and goats meet misfortune in their monthly divisions.
Drowned kin bear the River Earl’s mark,
The underworld’s tribunals hasten their suits with urgency.

For those afflicted in the *Gen* Palace, raving or delirium may arise,
Bloating and confusion, scorched by alternating cold and heat.
Before the incense and fire, old vows must be settled,
The Stove Lord and vengeful ghosts entwine in their grasp.
Beware the monthly branches *Si*, *You*, and *Chou*—
Specters all emerge from the northeast.
Short and slight, their souls wounded, their faces sallow,
Talismans and deliverance rites ensure peace and recovery.

For those afflicted in the *Zhen* Palace, pestilence strikes often,
Ears blocked, faces swollen, their speech mournful.
Weak limbs and bodily pain stem from curses,
Ghostly torments and heavenly retribution bring peril and doubt.
Ancestral spirits, elders clad in blue,
Earth gods and eastern kitchen gods lay the foundation of misfortune.
When illness is grave, guard against the seventh and fifth nights—
Only after this period may talismans and medicine be administered.

For those afflicted in the *Xun* Palace, pain pierces the heart,
The ailment lies in the intestines, filth encroaches.
The Five Paths and Five Penetrations stir whispers,
Tall and imposing ancestors, with deep-set brows.
From trees in the southeast, malevolent spirits stir,
Wells sealed, ditches smolder—search carefully.
Hasten to invoke the High Perfected, praying for protection,
Only when the intent is sincere may the cinnabar seal be pressed.

For those afflicted in the *Li* Palace, food is hard to contemplate,
Heart pain, headaches, and excessive heat.
Earth gods and Stove spirits dwell in southern temples,
Small ancestral forms, their afflictions flushed red.
Crimson-clad women who perished in childbirth,
Vomiting and retching, their ailments peak in severity.
There are also yang souls bearing bloodstains—
Offerings to ancestors dispel hauntings without fail.

For those afflicted in the *Kun* Palace, the intestines and stomach suffer,
Chronic diarrhea and dysentery waste the body.
Eye ailments, thinning temples, ghosts of plague,
Wooden specters from the southwest—willows and palms.
Heavenly tribunals hold unfulfilled vows, earthly offenses,
Paternal kin bear wounds of blood.
Without tombs, those executed or wronged are hard to deliver—
Scrutinize the spirits and dispatch talismans to expel them.

For those afflicted in the *Dui* Palace, the heart is knotted with scars,
Nighttime brings terror, cold sweat breaks out.
Fathers, ancestors, and young maidens send harsh visitations,
Earth gods transgress, and misfortune takes form.
Long-standing vows summon the gods to demand repayment,
Dreams of old portents linger in waking hours.
Stove spirits seize the moment to strike—
Talismans and methods must be applied with careful measure.

I have heard that the methods of the *Lingbao* tradition, from ancient times to the present,
Illumine the unseen while aiding the living.
Fasting rites and ascension deliver the departed,
Talismans, incantations, and prohibitions heal the living.
In recent practices, there exists a "General Salvation of the Three Realms of the Unseen,"
Which strays far from the original intent.
Yet the Dao of *Lingbao* emerges from the Dharma to save the world—
Every word, every character, serves to aid the living and illumine the unseen.
This is not limited to *Lingbao* alone; within the Daoist teachings,
Among the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, every method and precept
Adheres to this principle.
The Dao of the Three Bonds and Five Constants
Was established by Heaven to appoint rulers for the governance of the mortal world.
The teachings of emptiness and natural spontaneity
Were transmitted by the Dao through masters to dispel evil and repel the unseen.
Yet within these methods, a separate "General Salvation of the Unseen" is established—
Do the remaining methods not also address the unseen?
The ancient texts are difficult to reconcile with common practice,
Such discussions are meant for those of broad learning and profound insight.
Without discerning right from wrong, without understanding past and present,
Those who merely adopt the name of Daoist methods yet remain mired in vulgarity
Are unworthy of such discourse.
If such mediocre individuals dismiss these teachings as false,
I do not regard their opinions as weighty.
Future generations will surely recognize the truth—how could it be erased?
If one were to suppress this out of personal bias,
It would be like the frog at the bottom of the well, unable to govern beyond its confines.

What I have compiled here merely traces the origins,
Explaining why it differs from recent practices.
As for the proper procedures of the method,
They follow the transmission of my masters.
Yet this method is not something my three masters devised themselves—
It was passed down from ancient texts to me.
Those with aspiration may traverse rivers and lakes, seeking wide counsel and thorough study,
And they will come to know that my lineage is not in error.
As for the "Upper Grade General Salvation of the Unseen" from Tiantai,
It lists many talisman names, none of which derive from the original method.
Only the *Nine Palaces Cave Vision Formula* is an ancient practice,
Its foundational principles aligned with the old canons—how could I dare to alter them?
The poetic mnemonics differ in wording, though their meaning is somewhat similar—
This section was incorporated as transmitted by my master.

The "Middle Grade General Salvation of the Unseen" includes
The *Talisman of Longevity*, the *Left and Right Passports to Salvation and Ascension*,
The *Reverse Script*, the *Fourfold Unified Talisman of the Guardians*,
All of which belong to the category of talismanic proclamations.
There are also the *Three Officials’ Three Memorials*, the *Talismans for Deliverance of the Six Paths and Four Births*—
Their talismanic texts are from the *Lingbao* tradition, with no clear origin.
The *Divine Tiger’s Seven Jade Maidens Talisman*, the *Yang Radiance Passage Altar*,
The *Yin Spirit Seizing Altar*—all belong to the *Divine Tiger* category
And should not be included in the "Lower Grade General Salvation of the Unseen."
The *Invocation of True Water and True Fire* belongs to the *Refinement and Deliverance* category—
Thus, these three grades are cobbled together from miscellaneous talismans in various method categories.
According to ancient practices, these talismans and incantations each have their proper place.
Even if one wished to expand this classification, there are no additional talismans to include.
This is merely the work of those seeking quick profit,
Who fragment the transmission of method texts and invent this name to suit the times.
Beyond the prefectures of eastern Zhejiang, the Tiantai *Lingbao* practices are rarely followed—
This text need not elaborate further.
```

Yet I fear that pernicious doctrines may spread easily, and that in days to come there may be those led astray by them. Thus, though Yunzhong transmitted these methods to other prefectures and counties, he could not but recount the origins and evolution of the Tiantai tradition. Those who have long heard the Tiantai teachings may be well-versed in them, yet if they do not know the orthodox discourse, they will mistake the vastness of heaven and earth for the confines of their own chambers. Lacking firm conviction, they rely on the eyes and ears of others—such is but a heaven and earth within a jar.

**Talisman for Deafness** – Ingest this talisman.
**Talisman for Mutism** – Ingest this talisman; the original text is appended at the end.

**Talisman for Epidemic Illness** – Post, wear, or ingest this talisman.
**Talisman for Praying for Clear Skies** – Burn this talisman.

The above talismans are formed by selecting celestial seal-script characters from the central section, though they originally bore no names. For personal use, employ the standard script; for healing others, use the talisman above, drawing in qi and exhaling upon it before bestowing it.

Yunzhong Jin notes: The efficacy of the *Lingbao* tradition arises from its scriptures and their methods. Thus, incantations are derived from the scriptural text, and talismans are formed from its characters. Initially, one must carefully examine the principles before crafting them for use. Some retain discernible meaning, while others remain obscure. Yunzhong has compared various schools, all of which resemble one another, merely stating that "such-and-such a character treats such-and-such a matter" without establishing fixed talismanic forms—amounting to over fifty entries in total. If one grasps their subtle principles, their application is more than sufficient; without penetrating their mechanism, even volumes of explanations are futile.

By ancient standards, the *Scripture of Salvation* (*Duren Jing*) could yield a talisman from every character, though few were employed. The ancients must have had profound reasons. The Tiantai tradition’s forty-two talismanic categories, each named with four characters (e.g., *Azure Void Empty Song Talisman*, *Divine Wind Still Silence Talisman*), proliferate excessively, straying from the original intent. The scriptures’ coherence lies in their interconnected principles. Later generations, though transcribing them in mundane script, regarded them as celestial divine sounds capable of subduing yin’s malevolent anomalies—hence their use in suppression and healing. These were not originally named. Heaven bestowed these talismans so the people might follow them without needing to understand them. In matters of humans governing ghosts, secrecy is especially vital. Now, layering characters to form talismans often obscures their form, and assigning names to them exposes their mechanisms excessively.

The Tiantai system’s divergent categories form a distinct tradition, incompatible with ancient methods or other extant versions. Yunzhong here records only the classical texts and universally acknowledged practices, willingly enduring the slander of Tiantai and other regions to avoid offending future generations. Those who revile this will be few, while those who delight in it will be many. The former act from private bias, the latter from impartial judgment. If slander arises from such a stance, what harm does it bring?

**Preface to the Yellow Register Rituals**

Compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Keeper of the Law in the Southern Bureau of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* Masters, Right Attendant of the Initial Prefecture’s Governance

The teachings of the August Void trace back to primordial antiquity. The radiant unfolding of the wondrous Dao and the descent of divine scriptures into the world have manifested either in response to the times or through transmission by specific events. From the middle antiquity onward, the canonical corpus grew vast and profound. During the Jin and Song dynasties, Master Lu, the Serene Recluse, first clarified the sources of transmission and revelation, distinguishing the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, meticulously examining the diverse scriptures, and arranging the rituals of the Daoist liturgy in proper order. Thereafter, these rites spread far and wide, the methods of purification rites became widely disseminated, and the systematic arrangement of scriptural passages took form.

Later, Zhang Qingdu of Wanfu further compiled and systematized the ritual models, gradually refining the Middle Vehicle. Subsequently, Master Du Guangting of the Broad Accomplishment School exhaustively collated the commentaries on the thirty-six divisions of scriptures, incorporating both ancient and contemporary texts, and with great effort edited and proofread them, bringing the purification rites to completion. From the first word to the final method, every detail derived from the authoritative scriptures, adhering to the ancient twenty-four categories of purification rites.

In Guangting’s discourse, he stated that the Yellow Register encompasses both the living and the dead, uniting humans and heavens in shared blessings. From the state down to the common people, all may practice and uphold it, as it is administered within the Lower Primordial Palace, governing the myriad spirits, connecting the Nine Bureaus. Its merits are profound and weighty, benefiting both the living and the dead. Thus, he compiled the *Forty Scrolls of Purification Rituals*. Though its altar arrangements, ritual protocols, and postures of reverence follow a single tradition from ancient to modern times, its ritual texts are meticulously structured, its ceremonial procedures clear and flowing, elucidating ancient norms and illuminating future generations. The purification rites have reached their utmost perfection, beyond which nothing can be added.

The first scroll of these rituals describes the ranks of altar officials, stating: The Dharma Master must bear the registers and seals of the Three Caverns. Those who bear the *Dongxuan* registers may perform the purification rites. Since these rites originate from the *Lingbao* tradition, they belong to the *Dongxuan* division. From the initial declaration of the purification rite to the concluding offerings, dispersal of the altar, and expressions of gratitude, every detail is fully provided in Guangting’s rituals. There is no need for the later proliferation of purification rites, for though they draw from the scriptures of the Three Caverns, most derive from the twelve divisions of *Dongxuan*.

When conducting purification rites, the talismans, incantations, memorials, and petitions—though not recorded in ancient rituals—have, since the Tang dynasty, been consolidated within the *Great Rites of the Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure*. The foundational text of these rites centers on the single scroll of the *Upper Scripture of Salvation*, known as the *Great Rites of the Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure*. Though the scripture is concise, its profundities are inexhaustible.

The scripture states: When the stars and constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper cycles, purification rites should be performed, with the burning of incense and the recitation of scriptures. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, purification rites should be performed, with the burning of incense and the recitation of scriptures. When plague and pestilence spread, causing widespread death and injury among the people, purification rites should be performed, with the burning of incense and the recitation of scriptures. When teachers and friends pass away, purification rites should be performed, with the burning of incense and the recitation of scriptures.

In Guangting’s rituals, rites for averting national disasters, praying for the people’s blessings, delivering teachers and friends, universally saving lost souls, invoking blessings from the Three Primordials, and petitioning for the ascent of the nine generations of ancestors are all termed *Yellow Register* rites, with their ritual procedures derived from the *Lingbao* tradition. Thus, the origins of these compiled rites encompass a vast array of scriptures, while the talismanic methods for conducting purification rites are gathered within this text.

The ancient *Lingbao* methods begin with upholding the precepts, purifying the original scriptures, absorbing qi, and cultivating the spirit, gathering light and refining within. Only then does one proceed to save the world, deliver beings, assist the upright, expel evil, establish virtue, build merit, and rescue the departed from darkness. At this stage, the purification rites are performed to fully realize one’s inner cultivation and extend it to the world—this is the proper sequence of application.

Guangting’s rituals emphasize the Yellow Register. The ancient *Lingbao* methods also consist of Yellow Register ritual categories.

**Preface to the Purification Rites**

The ritual states: To deliver the departed souls and extend merit to the hidden realms, it is fitting to choose the three primal assemblies of the Three Primordials, the five seasonal festivals, or days of celestial grace and amnesty. The anniversary of the deceased’s passing, the great mourning period, and distant memorial days are especially auspicious.

The officiating officials must prepare the required offerings and personally visit the master’s abode to submit a petition thrice. According to the old protocols, after the preliminary memorials, no further deferential refusals are necessary when submitting petitions at the altar. Now, at the initial submission, one should first decline and then accept; during the ritual, one need only present the petition to invite the Dharma Master to ascend the altar.

Upon receiving the petition, the initial announcements are made, followed by the submission of the memorial. Thirty-six days prior to the rite, a scripture-recitation hall and the Dharma Master’s oratory are prepared. The officiants and participants enter the oratory to purify themselves, abstaining from worldly affairs and devoutly reciting the *Upper Scripture of Salvation*, the *Precious Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of the Spirit*, the two chapters of the *Dao and Virtue*, and the *Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court*.

As the appointed day approaches, the altar participants rehearse the rituals and practice the proceedings. Ten or seven days before the rite, the altar is arranged, banners unfurled, and ritual implements displayed. The banner for guiding the spirits is erected, the Yellow Register’s numinous pennant raised. Memorials are presented to the Three Clarities, the Jade Emperor, the Northern Pole, the Heavenly August Emperor, the August Earth, the Southern Pole, the Compassionate Honored One of Grand Unity, the Nine Heavenly Lords, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Five Elderly Heavenly Lords, the Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal, the Ministry of the Supreme Mystery, the Sun and Moon, the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Five Masters, the Nine Heavenly Inspectors, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms and Five Directions, the Emperor of Fengdu, the Perfected of the Five Peaks of Fusang, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Marchmounts, the Lords of Thunder and Lightning, the officials of Fengdu, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, the city gods and local altars, the Yellow Springs and the Fields of Reeds, the officials and generals of the registers, the divine tiger officers, and all the true administrators of the Three Realms.

On the eve of the rite, the officiating officials and Daoist participants, arrayed in full ceremonial regalia, proceed to the oratory to present their petition, inviting the Dharma Master to ascend the altar and conduct the proceedings. The tent is erected, the memorial tablet placed, the altar opened, and the rites commence with the presentation of the *Plain Chariot and White Horse* memorial.

At dusk, the *Memorial for Extricating Sins from Fengdu* is presented, followed by the issuance of the *Talisman of Salvation from Suffering*, the *Talisman for Delivering Souls from Darkness*, the *Nine Dragons Talisman*, and the *Register for Ascension to Heaven*. Next, the *Jade Tablet* is dispatched to the divine tiger officers and officials to root out and summon the souls for deliverance, along with all wandering spirits. The rites proceed with the offering of ritual lamps.

On the first day of the main fast, the Three Morning Audiences to the Perfected are conducted, with scripture recitation and circumambulation. At dawn, the *Memorial for Communicating with Heaven to Save from Suffering* is presented, along with the *Memorial for Opening the Path*. In the stillness of night, the *Rite for Breaking Open the Prisons* is performed, summoning the souls designated for deliverance, along with all wandering spirits, to their places. The *Incantation of Food* is recited, and the wandering spirits are guided to the *Feast of the Husked Grain*, where the *Incantation of Food* is widely performed. They listen to the Dharma and hear the scriptures, awaiting refinement and deliverance.

On the second day of the main fast, the audience to the Perfected and circumambulation are conducted. At dusk, the *Memorial for Bathing and Refining the Deliverance* is presented, refining and delivering all wandering spirits. The Dharma Master ascends the seat, expounds the precepts, transmits talismans, and bestows registers, enabling their transformation and ascension.

On the third day of the main fast, the audience to the Perfected and circumambulation are conducted. At dusk, the *Memorial for Ascending and Delivering the Departed Souls* is presented, refining and delivering the souls designated for deliverance. The precepts are expounded, talismans transmitted, and the *Bridge of Deliverance* crossed for transcendence.

After the rites conclude, the *Vermilion Memorial of Merit* is presented, and the *Three Tablets* are issued to summon the sages. A thanksgiving offering is held to express gratitude. Upon the completion of the offering, the precepts are returned, duties relinquished, the altar dismantled, and the feast dispersed. The Dharma Master is escorted away, the tent struck, and the *Dragon-Immersion* rite performed. First, the *Earth Tablet* is buried at the altar site, then the participants withdraw to the oratory, and the rites conclude with formal congratulations as prescribed.

**Sequence of the Fasting Rites**
The officiating officials prepare and submit the petition, proceeding to the Dharma Master’s residence in full ceremonial attire. They present incense and deliver their address, while the Dharma Master declines with humility. The officiants repeat their address, bearing the petition once more, and the Dharma Master responds again. After the officiants make their third entreaty, the Dharma Master consents and accepts the petition.

The Dharma Master faces the Heavenly Gate and sets up an incense table. If an image is present, incense is offered again to the Supreme Emperor. The Dharma Master places the petition on the tablet, bows three times, and the officiants offer incense and bow twice. The High Dharma Master orally presents the matter in full, bows three times, and withdraws. The officiants bow again, and all return to their positions.

**Pre-Announcement**
First, the positions of the *Meritorious Officials, Messengers, and Attendants* are arranged. Next, wine and fruit offerings are prepared. The positions of the *Five Masters* are set up in the hall or along the veranda, with incense, candles, and offerings arranged. The pre-announcement memorials and petitions are laid out before the masters, each placed in a clean box for carrying.

The High Dharma Master offers incense and bows three times before the masters. The officiants offer incense and bow twice. The High Dharma Master kneels to deliver the address and request the memorials. The officiants and Daoist participants together carry the documents to be submitted. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* strikes the chime and intones the *Huaxia*, while the Daoist participants chant in harmony as they proceed.

The participants are led to the place for submitting the memorials. The High Dharma Master transforms into a divine presence, paces the *Ding* steps, and burns the talisman. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* recites the *Incense Water Verse* and purifies the space. The High Dharma Master summons the officials and states the purpose, performing the *Three Offerings and Flower-Scattering Rite*.

In many regions, the High Dharma Master’s role is limited to summoning the officials, while the *Announcer* reads the text. The officiants offer incense and bow. The High Dharma Master makes a second announcement, and the *Announcer* proclaims the submission. The High Dharma Master dispatches the memorial, and the officiants kneel to offer libations and burn the memorial. The *Announcer* concludes with a dedication of merit.

**Raising the Banner**
An incense table is set up at the site for raising the banner. The High Dharma Master and officiants each offer incense and bow. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* initiates the rites, and the High Dharma Master delivers the opening address, which is documented. The *Banner Incantation* is recited, and the *Announcer* concludes with a dedication of merit before withdrawing.

**Scripture Recitation**
This follows the standard procedure for scripture recitation before the fast. The Daoist participants form ranks, and the High Dharma Master and officiants offer incense. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* initiates the rites, and the High Dharma Master opens with an address stating the purpose of the fast. The *Announcer* reads the scripture memorial. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* intones the *Seat-Spreading Hymn*, and all officials sit. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* leads the chanting, and the *Announcer* announces the request to turn the precious scripture. After the recitation concludes, the scriptures are gathered, and all rise. The *Announcer* recites the *Threefold Praise of the Scripture’s Wisdom*, and concludes with a dedication of merit.

**Submission of the Main Memorial**
When the fast reaches its appointed time, the altar is unfurled, and the ritual space is arranged. The six tents are set up, and all preparations inside and outside are completed. The main memorial documents are submitted, and the participants proceed to the master’s tent in proper order, where images and positions are temporarily arranged.

The officiants offer incense and bow. The High Dharma Master offers incense, and the *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* initiates the rites. The High Dharma Master bows and kneels, addressing the purpose of the fast and requesting the memorials. The rest follows the pre-announcement procedure.

The above does not pertain to the rites of Master Guangcheng but represents the commonly practiced procedures of the present age.

**Presentation of Memorials**
The *Plain Chariot and White Horse Memorial* and the *Memorial for Breaking Open Fengdu and Extricating Sins* are presented. Once the altar is established, the Three Treasures’ positions are arranged in the center, while the positions of the memorial officials and generals are set along the two sides outside the outer altar. If the altar is not ascended, the memorials may be presented within the ritual space.

After the altar is constructed, all rites should be conducted upon the inner altar. Recently, some have erected a separate small platform for presenting memorials, which is incorrect. Even for the *Memorial for Register Transmission in the Ancestral Altar*, many proceed within the ritual space.

The altar is established for the purpose of conducting the fast and presenting memorials. If there is an altar but the rites are performed elsewhere, it contradicts the original intent.

The High Dharma Master enters the oratory, wears the talisman, and engages in visualization as prescribed. The Daoist participants and officiants, arrayed in full ceremonial regalia, proceed to the oratory. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* initiates the rites, leading the High Dharma Master out of the oratory to the master’s tent. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* chants the *Dao Hymn*, and the High Dharma Master delivers the opening address. The *Knowledgeable Bell-Ringer* intones the *Huaxia*, and the High Dharma Master ascends the altar, enters the gate, and ascends the Heavenly Gate. After offering incense as prescribed, the *Opening Hall Hymn* is recited. The *Chief Cantor* leads the chanting, and all bow to the masters and engage in visualization as prescribed. The High Dharma Master recites the incantations, which are detailed in the *Memorial Presentation Rites*.

The *Chief Cantor* strikes the Dharma drum twenty-four times. The High Dharma Master kindles the incense burner, and the *Chief Cantor* announces each ritual position. The High Dharma Master proceeds with the rites meticulously. Two Daoist participants are invited to stand on the left and right, summoning the memorial officials. The *Three Offerings and Three Flower-Scatterings* are performed. The High Dharma Master thrice proclaims the ritual procedures, and the *Chief Cantor* leads the chanting. All officials kneel in reverence, and the High Dharma Master silently manifests the officials.

The High Dharma Master’s manifestation of officials follows specific methods. The memorial is opened and handed to the attendant scripture-holder, or a Daoist participant receives it, kneels, and carries it to the Three Treasures’ position.

The memorial is unveiled, and a Daoist participant recites the duplicate text. Another Daoist arranges the dragon-headed writing knife, cinnabar brush, inkstone, and other implements upon the table. The High Dharma Master recites the *Opening the Case Incantation*, opens the memorial case, fumigates the memorial, dispatches it, and seals the case, then hands it to the attendant scripture-holder. The Daoist participants chant the *Huaxia* hymn and proceed to the burning site.

The *Announcer* proclaims the memorial’s purpose, reads the petition aloud, and burns them together, submitting the memorial as prescribed. The Daoist participants chant the *Burning Hymn*, and the High Dharma Master rises and kneels. Once the memorial is burned, the High Dharma Master announces the ritual procedures to send off the deities. The High Dharma Master withdraws the manifested officials with the *Twelve Vows Method*. The High Dharma Master rekindles the incense burner and descends the altar, exiting the chamber as prescribed.

Before the master, the High Dharma Master offers a silent thanksgiving. The *Announcer* recites the *Redirecting Merit* prayer, leading the High Dharma Master into the oratory. The *Bell-Ringer* chants the *Returning to the True Dao*, and the *Announcer* declares, "The memorial rites are complete." All officials resume their positions.

For *Fu Command* and *Jade Tablet* rituals, either the *Fu Command* may be announced first, followed by the separate issuance of the *Jade Tablet*, or both may proceed together. Wine and fruit are prepared, and the *Three Offerings* are performed as prescribed. The *Fu Command* and *Jade Tablet* are arranged before the Supreme Thearch.

All officials proceed before the Supreme Thearch, array in ranks, and perform the ritual. The High Dharma Master petitions the *Fu Command*. Daoist participants carry the *Fu Command* and *Jade Tablet* in procession. The Daoists chant the *Huaxia* hymn, leading the way to the dispatching site. Rituals are performed to purify the area. The High Dharma Master transforms into the deity, burns the *Fu Command*, and summons the generals to offer tea. The High Dharma Master silently recites thrice, scatters flowers thrice, and makes three proclamations. The *Announcer* reads the memorial’s purpose. The High Dharma Master dispatches the *Fu Command* and burns it in a blazing fire fed by dry kindling. The *Announcer* recites the *Redirecting Merit* prayer. The High Dharma Master approaches the Supreme Thearch to offer thanks, then retires to the oratory to conclude the fast and submit the memorial. Recently, some have submitted the memorial within the oratory beforehand, which deviates from ancient practice.

Daoist participants proceed to the oratory and stand in ranks. The High Dharma Master and fast officers each offer incense. The *Announcer* steps forward to read the list of officiants, and the High Dharma Master and others sign the roster. The High Dharma Master takes his seat, and the fast officers offer incense. The *Announcer* delivers the address, inviting the High Dharma Master to recite the *Four Concluding Vows* and sign the fast’s conclusion. The procession exits the oratory.

A tent is erected. The following procedures adhere to the *Guangcheng Ritual*. All participants, in full ritual regalia, proceed to the oratory. The *Guide* leads the High Dharma Master before the *Inspector of the Altar’s* divine position. The High Dharma Master offers incense and makes a declaration without bowing, then stands in ranks before the *Mysterious Master’s* tent. The High Dharma Master and fast officers each offer incense, inviting the *Mysterious Master* to descend. The *Mysterious Master’s Hymn* is chanted, and the fast officers offer incense and tea.

The fast officers offer incense, hold the memorial case, and express the fast’s intent. Turning, they hold the case and say, "High Dharma Master, we submit the memorial and bow twice." The High Dharma Master takes the case, kneels, and invokes the master, reciting the memorial and its purpose before burning it. The High Dharma Master bows in reverence. The same procedure applies to the remaining five tents, except no memorial is submitted.

The procession proceeds to the tents of the *Three Officials*, *Three Masters*, *Five Thearchs*, and *Celestial Master Inspector of Fasts*, or may visit the *Inspector of Fasts* tent first, ascending in order of reverence. The *Huaxia* hymn is chanted, and the participants stand in ranks before the altar. Incense is offered, and proclamations are made. The text for opening the ritual is recited. A Daoist in ritual regalia is invited to consecrate the water and purify the altar, as prescribed. The *Redirecting Merit* prayer is recited.

To invoke the light, a candle is first lit before the *Jade Purity*. The visualization is performed as prescribed. Daoist participants proceed to the altar and stand in ranks. The *Bell-Ringer* initiates the ritual, and the fast officers offer incense and bow. The High Dharma Master, accompanied by incense and lamp attendants, approaches the *Upper Purity*. The High Dharma Master invokes the deities and recites incantations. Taking the *Wisdom Light Talisman*, the High Dharma Master approaches the Dao and ignites the light in hand while reciting incantations. The High Dharma Master hands the paper taper to the lamp attendant. Each Daoist participant takes a candle and lights it from the attendant’s flame. The Daoists light all the lamps and candles around the altar. The *Celestial Worthy’s* name is chanted, and the visualization is performed as prescribed. The *Redirecting Merit* prayer is recited, concluding with the *Golden Bell and Jade Chime* ritual.

For the *Overnight Invocation*, the *Guangcheng Ritual* prescribes submitting the memorial before the master. Daoist participants, in full ritual regalia, proceed to the oratory. The fast officers offer incense. The *Bell-Ringer* chants the *Golden Perfected, Expounding the Teachings, Celestial Worthy*. The High Dharma Master offers incense at the six tents, beginning with the *Five Thearchs’* western three tents, then the eastern three tents outside, and finally the *Mysterious Master’s* tent. The High Dharma Master silently prays for the fast’s intent. The *Huaxia* hymn is chanted, leading the procession to the altar.

The High Dharma Master enters the outer altar first, circumambulating the *Earth Gate*. The ritual participants array before the altar without entering. The High Dharma Master recites a silent incantation, enters the *Earth Gate*, and ascends the *Heavenly Gate*. The six officiants take their positions, with the *Chief Cantor* standing in the center of the altar, facing west. The High Dharma Master enters the *Heavenly Gate* and ascends the inner altar. The fast officers follow, offering incense to the ten directions, beginning with the east at dawn and the north at night. Incense is offered at the *Imperial Table*, the main table before the *Three Treasures*—anciently called the *Cave Table*. Incense is offered, talismans are burned, and silent incantations are recited. After the fast officers complete their incense offering, they exit the *Heavenly Gate* and return to their positions. The High Dharma Master offers incense at his original position—now the ritual table, though mistakenly referred to as the *Cave Table* in modern practice.

The *Opening the Hall Hymn* is chanted, and the *Chief Cantor* leads the bows to the master. The High Dharma Master recites the *Guarding the Numinous Incantation*. The *Chief Cantor* leads the chanting of the *Twenty-Four Strikes of the Dharma Drum*. The High Dharma Master kindles the incense burner, and the *Chief Cantor* announces each ritual position. The High Dharma Master recites the ritual procedures to venerate the ten directions. After the bows are completed, all prostrate in reverence, repent, and kneel. The repenting Daoist recites the *Three Repentance Hymns*, each followed by a bow to the *Three Treasures*.

Proceeding left to the east, the *True Writ of the Spread Dew* is recited. The Daoist participants respond in unison. The same procedure is followed for the four directions, each sealed with the *Golden Dragon*. The High Dharma Master returns to his position. The *Chief Cantor* again announces the ritual positions. The High Dharma Master recites the ritual procedures. The *Announcer* delivers the address. The High Dharma Master recites the *Three Wisdom Hymns* and circumambulates.

The High Dharma Master and *Chief Cantor* stand at the *Chief Cantor’s* table, while the *Chief Cantor* and all officials stand before the altar, facing north. The *Chief Cantor* chants, and all officials prostrate fully, hearts revering the ten directions, bowing once to each. Beginning with the north, all officials prostrate in silent reverence. After the bows, the *Announcer* speaks, and all officials sit upright. The precepts’ ritual decorum is explained.

All officials sit facing east in the west, while the fast officers stand before the altar, facing north. The Dharma Master offers incense thrice, recites the *Precepts Hymn*, and circumambulates left once. The *Chief Cantor* chants the *Three Bows to Receive the Precepts and Assume Office*. The High Dharma Master and others each receive their offices, bow thrice, and recite the prohibitions.

The *Chief Cantor* chants the *Monastic Supervisor’s Penalty Slip*, and upon receipt, all bow to the *Twelve Vows*. The High Dharma Master replenishes the incense burner, recites the *Hymn of Learning Immortality*, and exits the hall. The High Dharma Master departs through the *Heavenly Gate* from the inner altar, while all officials exit through the *Earthly Portal* from the central altar.

To the right, employing esoteric *Space-Void* incantations, they proceed to the *Mystic Master’s* tent and stand in order. The preceding hymns are intoned, and the High Dharma Master offers a brief petition to acknowledge transgressions, as prescribed. The *Chief Cantor* recites the *Monastic Supervisor’s* corrections, and the *Supervisor* inspects all officials for faults, leading those in error to the *Jing* chamber with the *Hymn of China*. The *Bell Master* intones the *Return to the Command of the Supreme Dao*, and the *Announcer* recites the *Establishment of the Altar*. Upon completion, all officials resume their positions for the *Breaking of the Prisons*.

The *Guangcheng* rites lack this section, as it originates from the *Lingbao* tradition. Lamps and candles are lit, and the incense table is set. The Daoist assembly stands in order, lighting the lamps of the *Nine Prisons*. The High Dharma Master silently petitions the talismans, wielding the staff to break the prisons in due form. After the *Nine Prisons* are addressed, the merit is dedicated.

**First Day of the Proper Fast – Dawn**
All officials proceed to the *Jing* chamber. The *Heavenly Worthy* is invoked, and the High Dharma Master exits. They arrive at the *Six Tents* to offer incense, standing in order before the *Mystic Master*. The *Bell Master* chants the *Hymn of the Dao of China*, and the High Dharma Master ascends the altar. Following the prescribed form, incense is offered to the *Ten Directions*, the *Imperial Tablet*, and the incense burner, with esoteric recitations.

Incense is offered at each station, and the *Chief Cantor* intones the hymns. All bow to their masters and meditate as prescribed. The High Dharma Master recites the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*, and the *Chief Cantor* calls for the *Dharma Drum* to be struck twenty-four times. The High Dharma Master kindles the incense burner, and the *Chief Cantor* intones the hymns. All officials kneel. The High Dharma Master performs the *Officer’s Rite*, and the *Chief Cantor* intones the hymns as each declares their Dharma rank and offers tea.

The High Dharma Master recites the rites, and the *Announcer* proclaims the words. The High Dharma Master again recites the *Ten Directions’ Repentance*, offering five incense sticks to each direction. The *Chief Cantor* stands at the *Heavenly Gate*, facing east, while the High Dharma Master stands at the *Ghost Gate*, facing west. The *Chief Cantor* intones the hymns, and all visualize the *Nine-Colored Circular Image*, swallow saliva, command the demons, and recite esoteric incantations. Upon completing the visualization, the *Chief Cantor* intones the *Step-Void Circumambulation*.

For three days and nine audiences, demons are commanded with esoteric recitations. Modern practitioners omit the demon-commanding at morning and evening audiences, which deviates from ancient tradition. The *Step-Void* consists of ten hymns, each followed by a bow. The *Chief Cantor* recites the *Reverence for the Scriptures* as prescribed, with three invocations and three bows, each followed by a single bow. The *Chief Cantor* intones the *Three Bows*, then declares the Dharma ranks anew. The High Dharma Master offers a grand thanksgiving, recites the *Hymn of Learning Immortality*, and exits the altar. Following the form, they proceed to the *Master’s Tent* and stand in order. The High Dharma Master offers a brief petition, the *Announcer* dedicates the merit, and the *Chief Cantor* recites the *Monastic Supervisor’s* corrections, which are then completed. The *Hymn of China* leads the High Dharma Master back to the *Jing* chamber. The *Bell Master* intones the *Return to the Supreme Dao*, and the *Announcer* declares the morning audience concluded. All officials resume their positions.

**Midday – Evening Audience**
No *Officer’s Rite* is performed, nor is the *Guardian Spirit Incantation* recited; the rest follows the morning audience’s form.

**Quiet Night – Memorial Petitions**
First, the *Memorial to the Supreme Unity for Salvation from Suffering* is presented at the *Palace of the Supreme Unity* (see memorial form). The *Petition to Open the Path* is then presented (see petition form).

**Summoning the Departed – Urgent Summons Protocol**
The *Yellow Register* rites emphasize universal deliverance, and those who preside must broaden their intent to ensure the souls they deliver receive benefit. For the proper *Deliverance of the Departed* and the *Ten Classes of Lonely Spirits*, two banners should be erected, summoning all together without distinction of priority, lest hierarchy obscure the breadth of compassion. After summoning the delivered souls, the tents are divided for the *Bathing Rite*.

First, the *Properly Delivered Souls* are led to pay homage to the Perfected and return to their positions, where a Daoist master is invited to recite the *Food-Consecration Incantation*. Next, in a separate chamber, the *Lonely Spirits* are bathed and led to pay homage to the Perfected. They then proceed to the *Outer Enclosure* to receive the *Grain Offering* and *Food-Consecration Incantation* as prescribed. During the day, they attend the *Proper Fast* to hear the Dharma and scriptures. At night, the *Refinement and Deliverance* is performed. The *Refinement and Deliverance* should not be divided into two ranks, for when the *Lonely Spirits* are delivered, the merit returns to the departed. It is improper to rigidly distinguish or emphasize hierarchy, which contradicts the *Celestial Statutes*. The *Summoning Protocol* is found in the *Universal Deliverance Rites*.

**Second Day of the Proper Fast**
The morning, noon, and evening audiences follow the first day’s form, except no *Officer’s Rite* is performed. After the noon audience or during the evening audience, the *Petition for Bathing and Refinement* is presented. After the evening audience, the *Memorial to the Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal* and the *Memorial to the Nine Celestial Emperors* are offered.

During the quiet night, the *Refinement and Deliverance of the Ten Classes of Lonely Spirits* is performed with its prescribed rites. The High Dharma Master ascends the seat to admonish the spirits, transmit talismans, and deliver souls as prescribed.

**Third Day of the Proper Fast**
The three audiences follow the second day’s form. After the noon audience, the *Petition for the Ascension of the Departed Souls* is presented. During the quiet night, the *Refinement and Deliverance of the Properly Delivered Souls* is performed. The High Dharma Master ascends the seat to preach the precepts, transmit talismans, and conduct the *Bridge Crossing to Send Off the Departed* as prescribed.

After each audience, a brief rest is taken, followed by three daily ascents to the altar to recite scriptures, in accordance with ancient tradition.

**Dissolution of the Altar**
All follows the *Guangcheng* ritual protocol. All officials proceed to the *Jing* chamber and lead the High Dharma Master to the *Six Tents* to offer incense, standing in order before the *Mystic Master*. The *Hymn of the Dao of China* is chanted to lead the ascent to the altar. The High Dharma Master enters the altar first, offering incense to the *Ten Directions* as prescribed. All bow to their masters, recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*, and the *Dharma Drum* is struck.

The High Dharma Master kindles the incense burner and performs the *Lingbao Natural Homage to the Ten Directions’ Repentance*, with three invocations and three bows. The *True Writs* are fumigated at their respective directional altars. All officials join in reciting the *True Writs*, holding the writs to fumigate them with incense. The *Announcer* proclaims the words, and the *Red Memorial* is presented. The memorial is dispatched and sealed. The Daoist assembly holds the *Blue and Red Memorials* and burns them at the *Heavenly Gate*.

The *Announcer* proclaims the *Closing Petition*. The High Dharma Master prostrates before the memorial, rises, and all recite the memorial’s words. Incense is offered thrice, and the *Mountain, Water, and Earth Slips* are announced. The *Dragon-Throwing Hymn* is recited, incense is offered, and the *Descent of the Sages* is invoked anew for the *Jiao* offering. The *Three Offerings* ritual is performed.

The *Sending-Off Hymn* is recited, and the High Dharma Master ascends the altar to return the precepts. The *Return of the Precepts Hymn* is intoned, and the High Dharma Master kneels. All officials surrender their ranks. The High Dharma Master replenishes the incense burner and recites the *Circumambulation Hymn for the Three Paths and Five Sufferings’ Dissolution of the Altar*, followed by the *Hymn of Learning Immortality*.

Exiting the hall, they proceed to the *Six Tents* to present the *Memorial of Thanks*. They then enter the *Jing* chamber.

All officials descend to offer thanks to the High Dharma Master, then don their ceremonial robes and disperse.

The foregoing sequence constitutes the ancient *zhai* ritual.

Master Guangcheng’s *Jiao* offering proceeds as follows: Upon the completion of the *Huanglu* memorial and the *zhai* rites, the five-colored silks from the altar are distributed among fellow practitioners and those dwelling in humble abodes as merit-making offerings. Only the *Mandate Silk* and *Golden Dragon* are retained at the central altar. Three days later, a *Jiao* rite is held to dissolve the altar, the dragon is cast, and the seating dispersed—all executed with meticulous diligence from beginning to end.

In recent times, the custom has been to conclude at the hour of *hai* (9–11 p.m.). Once the ritual is complete, at the *chou* hour (1–3 a.m.) of the following morning, the *Yan Gong* officiates the *Jiao* offering, detailing its purpose. Within the purview of cultivation and rectification, spirits are summoned, the altar precincts guarded, proclamations and petitions transmitted, and messengers dispatched—all laborious tasks deserving recompense. Thus, this *Jiao* feast is established to honor and reward their service.

*Yunzhong’s note:* This account is Master Guangcheng’s meticulous reconstruction of ancient protocols, not his own invention. Such practices were already observed before the Tang dynasty. The ancient principle dictated that even after three days, the *Golden Dragon* and *Mandate Silk* remained to guard the altar until the *Jiao* offerings were complete, only then surrendering ranks and dissolving the altar. Master Guangcheng’s model, however, stipulates that the *Yan Gong* conducts the *Jiao* the following morning, with ranks surrendered and the altar dissolved only after its conclusion. In modern times, ranks are often surrendered and the altar dispersed immediately after the memorial is presented, followed by a separate petition to re-invite the master for the *Jiao*—a practice entirely disconnected from antiquity and deeply flawed.

Moreover, some conduct the *zhai* under the *Dongxuan Lingbao* tradition but perform the *Jiao* according to *Dongshen* methods, further deviating from the original intent. They fail to recognize that the *Huanglu* thanksgiving *Jiao* is a distinct rite of gratitude to the Perfected after the *zhai*. Dissolving the altar before the *Jiao* and preemptively discharging precept ranks treats the *Jiao* as an unrelated affair, rendering it nearly impossible to execute properly. Only a few prefectures in eastern Zhejiang have grown accustomed to this practice, accepting it without question.

Thus, in *Jiangshi’s Established Rites*, which seeks to adhere to scriptural precedents, this section rejects Master Guangcheng’s model in favor of contemporary conventions. Below, the modern ritual sequence is also recorded to clarify its origins and evolution.

**Modern Protocol for Altar Dispersal**
All officials proceed to the *Jing* chamber, escorting the High Dharma Master to the *Six Tents* to offer incense. They arrange themselves before the *Xuan* Master’s tent. The High Dharma Master silently declares the *zhai*’s purpose. All officials ascend the altar, and the High Dharma Master offers incense as prescribed. The *Dujiang* leads the chanting, the High Dharma Master kindles the incense burner, and the assembly recites the *Reverent Invocation of Dharma Ranks*. The High Dharma Master proclaims the *Petition to the Ten Directions*, performs the *Three Invocations and Three Bows*, and concludes the *True Writs* and *General Mantra* as prescribed. The *Reverent Invocation of Dharma Ranks* is repeated, followed by the presentation, declaration, dispatch, sealing, and burning of the memorial. Officials surrender their ranks and return the precepts, the *Return of the Precepts Hymn* is intoned, the *Three Slips* are announced, the *Dragon-Throwing Hymn* recited, ranks are surrendered, and farewells are bid to the *Three Treasures*. According to ancient protocols, the incense burner is not replenished here. The *Circumambulation Hymn for the Three Paths and Five Sufferings* is recited, the altar dissolved, the *Six Tents* dismissed, and the High Dharma Master retires to the *Jing* chamber.

**The Jiao Offering**
The *Jiao* invitation text is issued. The assembly exits the *Jing* chamber and enters the consecrated altar. Incense is offered. The High Dharma Master begins the invocation, and all pay homage to the master, reciting the *Guardian Spirit Mantra*. The incense burner is kindled, and officials are summoned. The *First Offering* proclamation is made, followed by the *Second* and *Final Offerings* with their respective petitions. The *Sending-Off Hymn* is recited, ranks are surrendered, the incense burner replenished, and the assembly disperses as customary.

The above outlines modern conventions. Those adhering to ancient protocols may find discrepancies, but where reason prevails, the ancient model should be followed.

*Yunzhong’s note:* Master Guangcheng’s protocols—from altar construction and dispersal to the nine-morning repentance rites, scripture recitations, and lamp-lighting ceremonies—each follow established rules. Even the submission of memorials and the use of talismans adhere to the *Lingbao* Great Dharma. The current *zhai* sequence, aside from Master Guangcheng’s ancient model, represents a simplified adaptation to support the foundational method. However, regional variations abound, and discrepancies between ancient and modern practices are pronounced. Having received transmission from my revered master, I adhere strictly to Master Guangcheng’s ancient protocols and dare not alter them. Those who do not follow the ancient method may proceed according to their own received traditions.

**Petition Forms for Zhai Rituals**
**Initial Petition of the Zhai Official**
[Dharma Rank and Name], or [Native Place] for those without rank.

[Name] humbly petitions on behalf of [Deceased’s Name], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour], deceased on [Year, Month, Day, Hour] at [Location], now [Time Elapsed] since passing, their fate yet unknown. With utmost sincerity, I vow to undertake the prescribed rites, establishing the *Supreme Huanglu Great Zhai* for five days and nights. Within this period, three days of the *Proper Zhai* will include nine sessions of morning and evening offerings, culminating in dispersal. I shall arrange [Number] *Qing Jiao* offerings to the High Perfected of the Three Realms, dedicating merit to the state and all beings, universally delivering the Six Paths and Three Sufferings, rescuing the Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations. May this virtuous fruit specifically deliver the departed soul of [Deceased’s Name], ascending them to the Pure Realm.

I respectfully submit this petition to the *Dongxuan Lingbao* Dharma Master [Name], beseeching your compassionate assent and prioritized arrangement for altar construction and ritual execution.

Respectfully submitted.
[Year] [Month] [Day]
[Dharma Rank and Name]

For group petitions, replace "[Name]" with "[Names] et al." and adjust the wording accordingly. This form serves as the initial invitation to the master. If the petition is presented at the altar to invite the master to officiate, it follows the memorial and requires a different format, detailed below.

**Incense Offering and Petition Presentation by the Zhai Official**
The *Huanglu Great Zhai* Convener [Dharma Rank and Name] humbly reveals his sincerity, beseeching the Perfected’s attention.

I have learned that the *Dongxuan* middle canon encompasses the model of all methods, while the *Huanglu* luminous precepts serve as the ladder for all beings. Revered by both ancient and modern, followed by both mundane and sacred, its merit pervades the boundless, its blessings shower all sentient beings. Attaining such virtuous fruit is indeed the result of past causes.

Reflecting upon ourselves, we were born and raised amid the dusty paths of the mundane world, lingering in profane realms. Engulfed by the waves of the river of desire, we struggle to glimpse the walls of the Dao’s domain. To dissolve the stains of kalpas past and rescue beings from the darkest depths of suffering, we turn our thoughts upward to the nation and downward to the living and the dead. We aspire to elevate the spirits of nine generations of ancestors and universally deliver those mired in the three wretched destinies. Within the four quarters and the six directions, we honor loyal ministers who sacrificed themselves for their country and filial descendants who laid down their lives for their parents. Some perished as wandering exiles, frozen and starving; others met untimely ends through illness, injury, or violent misfortune. Some fell in battle, their brains spattered upon the field; others succumbed to famine, their flesh and bones scattered in calamity. Some drowned in water or perished in fire; others hanged themselves, slit their throats, or took poison in despair. Some endured punishment for crimes, while others bore deep grievances yet to be resolved. Some, burdened by grave transgressions, remain beyond deliverance; others, entangled in heavy karmic opposition, have yet to find release. The paths of the underworld stretch endlessly, offering no respite from the myriad sufferings. The gates of darkness yawn boundlessly, their ninefold nights devoid of light. In sorrow for our own kin, we grieve equally for all beings. Earnestly we knock upon the wondrous gate of *Dongxuan*, reverently we unfold the grand rites of *Huanglu*. First, we invoke the accumulated power of ancestral temples and dynastic spirits, praying for the emperor’s longevity of ten thousand years. Universally we deliver the ten classes of beings across the three wretched destinies, broadly rescuing those trapped in the ninefold depths of darkness. Gathering this extraordinary blessing, we dedicate it to the salvation of the departed souls of [Names]. We dissolve enmity, wash away defilement, refine their essences, and purify their spirits, extending this grace to all who sacrificed their lives, that they may together partake in boundless fortune. This is a matter of grave importance, and its success hinges upon securing the right person.

We humbly regard the Great Dharma Master of the *Lingbao* tradition, the Venerable [Name], whose innate purity and lofty reputation shine brightly. Having traversed the ten directions and immersed himself in the Three Caverns’ scriptures, he stands ready to uphold his unwavering resolve and broadly succor all beings. Recording our utmost devotion, we earnestly beseech him to preside over this altar of deliverance, bestowing blessings upon both the living and the dead, and extending his merit to the seen and unseen realms. With reverence, we await your gracious assent.

**The Dharma Master’s Reply:**
I am but a humble dweller in a thatched hut, my nature coarse and unrefined. Though I have borne the talismans and registers and accumulated years of cultivation, and though I have collated scriptures and sought instruction from teachers and friends, my diligence has reached its limit, yet my meager abilities have yielded little. My virtue remains insufficient, and my talents are unworthy of such trust. My mastery of the Dharma is still incomplete, and I am unworthy of the rare opportunity of true transmission. Measuring myself, I fear I would fail to meet your noble expectations. To accept this charge would only risk undermining the merit of the retreat. It would be better to seek a transcendent master to assume the foremost role in these sacred rites. I respectfully return your petition and dare not proceed.

**Second Request:**
The Convener of the *Huanglu* Great Retreat, [Rank and Name], presumes upon your indulgence to present this earnest plea. We have learned that even the *Zhengyi* Perfected One would not dare to serve the Three Clarities of the Realms of the Immortals without first establishing merit. Only after the Grand Scribe had benefited the world was he able to ascend into the nine heavens. Though immortals attain realization through inner cultivation, the highest Perfected Ones regard outer works as paramount. Moreover, the boundless blessings of *Huanglu* arise from the supreme causes of *Lingbao*. We pray for the harmonious peace of the nation and all peoples, above and below, that the seen and unseen, gods and humans, may together rejoice. We implore the Venerable [Name] to bring forth the pure treasures of his heart, to follow in the luminous footsteps of the sages of old, to open the bridge that saves the world, and to serve as the compassionate model for delivering beings. We beseech you to turn your merciful gaze upon us, to bestow your redoubled sincerity, to preside over the retreat’s covenant, and first to acknowledge our petition with your assent. We humbly beg you to yield to our earnest request and refrain from further refusal.

**The Dharma Master’s Second Reply:**
I have learned that the divine scriptures of *Lingbao* and the grand precepts of *Huanglu* span the Three Caverns and encompass the ten directions. They constitute the merit of three thousand virtuous deeds and distill the profound essence of a million sacred texts. Their precepts and prohibitions are most solemn, and their grace and virtue are boundless. To properly oversee such great affairs, one must seek a person of surpassing excellence. Though I have studied for many years, the true principles remain obscure to me. Despite my diligent search for teachers, I have seldom encountered those of extraordinary attainment. I have barely glimpsed the hidden mysteries of the Dao, and my virtue is insufficient to aid the seen and unseen realms. In performing rituals and upholding ceremonial forms, I can only strive to do my best. To ascend in spirit and pay homage to the highest heavens is beyond the capacity of a mere mortal. I urge you to seek widely among the blessed lands and famous mountains, where you may find one truly endowed with the qualities of an immortal. I beg you not to trouble yourself with further entreaties and to accept my sincere refusal.

**Third Request:**
[Rank and Name], undeterred by the impropriety of repeated appeals, once more pour forth our earnest sincerity. We have learned that the rites of the retreat are most solemn, and the true precepts are most revered. Following the proper forms and adhering to the rituals brings boundless blessings, while deviating from the norms invites swift retribution. We have carved our devotion into our bones and pledged our hearts to this vow, ensuring that the retreat’s offerings and implements are complete and refined. Should we falter or transgress, we willingly accept the consequences. We implore the Venerable [Name] not to forget your initial oath, to honor the grace of the Dao, to preside over this supreme karmic connection, and to lead the pure assembly of the altar. May the thousand spirits fulfill their duties, that all may receive your blessings. For a hundred million years, we pray for the emperor’s longevity. Across the eight thousand domains, we pray for the peace of the world. May the three wretched destinies and the nine dark realms be purified, and may the ten classes of beings and the four kinds of life together rejoice. May the souls we commend, along with the ancestral spirits of all clans, through this virtuous act, swiftly ascend to the immortal realms. We await your gracious assent and humbly beg for your response. We can scarcely express the depth of our reverent entreaty.

**The Dharma Master’s Assent:**
My talents are shallow, my virtue slight. By good fortune, I have been entrusted with the sacred texts and mistakenly included among the ranks of the immortals’ offices. My deepest wish is to universally deliver the seen and unseen realms, that I may accumulate even a small measure of merit. Yet I fear my learning remains imperfect, and I may mar the retreat’s perfection. Since I can no longer decline, I shall do my utmost to comply. I rely upon the retreat’s sponsors to uphold their commitment to the end and not to abandon their noble intentions. I further hope that the altar officials will share this resolve and not deviate from the true precepts. How dare I not adhere to the ritual forms, reverently attend to the retreat’s affairs, first gaze toward the celestial palace, and present this petition?

The Master receives the petition and places it upon the tablet, gazing toward the Gate of Heaven. An incense table is arrayed, incense is offered, and obeisance is made. The retreat officials present incense, bow twice, and stand upright.

The Master intones:
"Dao-fragrance, virtue-fragrance, non-action fragrance,
Pure and naturally wondrous, cavernously true fragrance,
Numinous Treasure’s gracious fragrance, fragrance transcending the Three Realms,
True fragrance of the Three Realms, filling the Jade Capital and Jasper Metropolis,
Pervading the Dharma-realms of the cosmos.

By this burning incense, we reverently address the High Perfected of the Three Void Realms,
The Divine Emperors of the Golden Towers and all heavens,
The host of immortals of sun, moon, and stars,
The sages of the ten directions in earth, water, and sacred peaks,
The myriad spirits of the Three Realms, and the true lords of the Six Directions.
Through this true fragrance, we universally extend our offerings.
Jade blossoms scatter radiance, the Nine Qi congeal as mist,
Fragrant clouds densely arrayed, directly ascending through the heavens.
The Golden Lad attendant of incense and the Jade Maiden transmitter of words
Will report above before the Celestial Throne,
That our petition may be received and all be accomplished as spoken.

The duly ordained servant of the Dharma, [Name], humbly submits this petition to establish an unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights,
To benefit the state above and extend to ancestral kin below,
To broadly deliver the six paths and four kinds of birth,
To universally bless the nine provinces and ten classes of beings.
We gather these good fruits to dedicate for the deceased [Name],
To emerge from the shadowy realms and ascend to the immortal lands.

I, though but briefly favored with minor causes, have been refined by the true transformation.
Having long held this office, I reflect upon my meager merits.
I must restrain myself to examine my faults,
How dare I presume to instruct others in the teachings?
Yet bound by the covenant of past vows,
I cannot refuse this earnest request.
I rely upon the Heavenly Creation’s encompassing compassion,
The Dao’s merciful salvation.
May I be permitted to conduct this retreat for universal deliverance,
And allowed to proceed according to the prescribed forms.
This petition is recorded separately for presentation.

We further pray that the successive sagely ancestors and honored spirits of the ancestral temples
Ascend to the Heaven within Heaven,
And swiftly realize the Dao within the Dao.
May the present emperor’s longevity equal Mount Song and his blessings match the vast sea,
All nations be at peace, and the myriad people prosper.
May the Nine Dark Prisons of night share in the supreme causes,
And the ten classes of orphaned souls all receive boundless grace.
These blessings we gather specifically for the retreat sponsor [Name],
To dedicate for the deceased soul,
That it ascend to the Purple Palace, refine its form in the Cinnabar Heavens,
Bringing joy to descendants and flowing blessings upon the retreat sponsor.

I, [Name], in utmost trepidation, dare not offend the Celestial Might.

The above documents—petition, memorial, and related texts—are copied and prepared,
A day chosen in advance for submission.
All are compiled into one volume for ease of use; repetition is omitted here.

I have often observed that predecessors, when conducting affairs, were meticulous and solemn,
Never resorting to careless brevity.
Upon receiving the petition, the Master would decline thrice before intoning the address.
This follows the precedent of the former master, the venerable Gao.
If the retreat officials’ sincerity and devotion are profound,
Then in the space of a single thought, divine beings will attend.
How much more so for the Yellow Register’s merit, which jointly delivers the manifest and hidden?
How could the Master not treat this matter with utmost gravity?
Declining before accepting the petition is proper ritual.
Is there not the clearest of evidence?
If in other regions this practice cannot be followed,
It may be adapted to local custom as appropriate."

**Chapter on the Regulations and Forms for Hoisting the Banner**

At the commencement of the retreat, a tall pole is erected in the open space near the altar. The banner is hoisted in advance to announce to the boundless heavens and universally inform the myriad spirits, serving also as a pledge of the time appointed for the performance of virtuous works. Thus, the manifest and hidden alike behold it; gods and ghosts gaze upon it from afar. The symbolic object fulfills the ritual without need for excess or complexity. The ancient banner comprises two forms:

**Banner for Translocating the Spirit**
A crimson silk banner, seven *chi* or forty-nine *chi* in length, is fashioned with a single head. Cinnabar and orpiment are ground together and used to inscribe the forms of the sun, moon, and Dipper upon the banner’s head. The banner’s name is inscribed upon its body. On the left is written the Inner Taboo of the Three Heavens; on the right, the Hidden Taboo of the Three Heavens. When the departed soul beholds this, its karmic obstructions are dissolved, and its spirit is translocated to the Southern Palace.

**Banner for Returning Radiance**
A white or yellow silk banner, twenty-four *chi* or forty-nine *chi* in length, is fashioned. Upon its body is inscribed the full title of the Azure Mystery. At its left foot is written: *The Great Tenuous Banner of the Command of the Luminous One, the Yellow Banner of Returning Radiance from the Grand Subtlety*. At its right foot is written: *The Banner for Summoning and Delivering the Souls of the Long Night’s Repository to Receive Rebirth*. On the left side is written: *In the vastness of Fengdu…* and *The golden light of merit and virtue…* (text abbreviated). The banner is suspended from a tall pole below the altar, left to flutter in the wind. When the hidden souls of the ten directions dimly perceive this numinous banner, a single thought of refuge causes the winds of karmic obstructions to dissipate in that very moment. Even the great sins of worldly toil are absolved, allowing ascent to the Southern Palace, the opening of the hells, and the rebirth of the dead.

The *Scripture of the Three Realms* further states: Alternatively, ten small banners may be fashioned and hung among the forests, mountains, and rivers, and the same fruition shall be attained.

**Rite for Hoisting the Banner**
The High Master intones the invocation.

Fragrance of the Dao, fragrance of virtue, fragrance of non-action, fragrance of purity through non-action, fragrance of natural purity, wondrous cavernous true fragrance, numinous treasure wisdom fragrance, fragrance transcending the Three Realms, true fragrance of the Three Realms—with this incense now kindled, we present our offerings and supplications to the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, the Highest Clarity True Realm’s Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm’s Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, the myriad spirits of the Three Realms, and the host of sages in the void. May the incense—jade blossoms scattering radiance, ninefold *qi* congealing as smoke—form a dense canopy of fragrant clouds, ascending straight to the Nine Heavens.

May the Golden Lad attendant upon the incense and the Jade Maiden messenger of words convey our petition to the Celestial Throne, that our entreaties be heard and granted as spoken.

I, your humble servant, [Name], unworthy and presumptuous though I am, dare to intrude upon the mysterious heavens, beseeching your compassion and gracious regard. Though I stand guilty of no merit, long have I served in the ranks of the ordained. With the wish to aid this age, I now humbly present my sincerest words.

Yesterday, a devotee from [Place] requested the establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast, to benefit the nation and bestow universal blessings upon all beings, to elevate the seven ancestors and nine lineages, and to deliver the ten classes of beings in the Three Paths. Gathering these meritorious fruits, we dedicate them to the liberation of the departed soul of [Name], that they may ascend to the realms of goodness.

I have already prepared and recorded the proceedings, submitting this petition for your consideration, and have issued decrees to the various bureaus, extending the notice across the Three Realms. Now, as the date of the fast approaches, we reverently commence the hoisting of the numinous banner.

For the Yellow Register’s profound rituals encompass the myriad spirits and connect the Nine Palaces; the supreme scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery bridge the Four Auxiliaries and pervade the Three Vehicles. The boundless blessings thus bestowed follow established forms of reverence. The numinous sounds and sacred titles descend like the morning radiance of the Nine Heavens and Ten Poles. The colored silks and patterned banners spread their wondrous shade across the Five Paths and Three Ways. Those who receive its grace with sincerity find the hidden souls blessed with deliverance. We look upward, hoping for Heaven’s compassion, the flowing grace of the Dao, and the bestowal of merciful salvation. May you deign to witness our humble devotion as we now recite the banner’s incantation:

*By the Yellow Register’s power of deliverance, the Three Realms and ten directions are opened. The four kinds of birth and six paths of existence gather in this Dao altar. The soul is awakened, the spirit ascends—through ten thousand kalpas, this shall not be forgotten. The banner’s essence is lightness, borne aloft by the wind. Wherever the wind reaches, there it shall go. To the palaces of deepest yin, the lands of ninefold night, the hells, hungry ghosts, and the boundless suffering of the animal realm—all shall be liberated, ascending to the heavens.*

*With the sounding of the chime, the Banner of Liberation and the Heavenly Worthy Who Absolves Sins is raised.*

The merits of hoisting the banner are measureless, a supreme cause. Universally dedicating it to the Three Paths, broadly aiding the myriad classes, none fail to behold its radiance and dissolve their obstructions, or gaze upon its form and escape the bonds of sin. Released from entanglements, freed from pursuit and servitude, the ninefold night palaces of the underworld are illuminated. The lost on the six paths of delusion all return to purity and peace.

We humbly pray that the imperial domain endure forever, the realm enjoy great peace, winds and rains come in season to bring abundant harvests, disasters and calamities vanish so all people rejoice. May insects, plants, and trees all fulfill their growth; may creatures with scales, shells, feathers, and fur all avoid untimely death. Gathering these modest virtues, we dedicate them to the fast’s sponsor, [Name], and to the liberation of the departed soul of [Name]. May they awaken to their past causes, swiftly transcend the nether realms, resolve their enmities, and wash away their karmic stains. Riding the merit of this fast, may they ascend directly to the shore of the Dao.

As the supreme good cause, we invoke the Three Clarities’ Heavenly Worthies of Unfathomable Merit and Virtue.

Upon reviewing the various Numinous Treasure rites, we find their general forms largely consistent. The banner diagrams recorded therein comprise only two types: the Banner of Transcendent Spirit and the Banner of Returning to the Yellow. No other variants exist.

The Heavenly Terrace Numinous Treasure tradition differs from others in its rites, yet its banner diagrams also number only two. However, it designates the Banner of Transcendent Spirit as the Banner of Returning Radiance, with minor differences in design.

In recent times, some have established Banners of Vows and Pledges, often inscribing them with the august titles of the Jade Emperor. The *Complete Rites of the Jiang Clan* instead inscribes them with “The Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, the True Writings and Treasure Talismans, the Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages,” all reflecting the intent of invoking the fast’s vows. Yet the ancient Numinous Treasure rites contain no such practice. Though these may have scriptural basis, they should not be mixed with the original Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure methods. Thus, they may be employed only in the Jiang Clan’s fast rituals, following local customs.

Beyond these, many banner designs have emerged in recent times. While some lack clear provenance, those that accord with principle may still be used. However, banners such as the Banner of Commanding Spirits misconstrue the original intent and violate reason.

This error arises from the *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating Spirits*, which mentions the “Great Tenuous Banner of Returning to the Yellow” and the “Numinous Banner Commanded by Wu Ying.” Yet *Wu Ying* is the name of a spirit, while *command* signifies its use in summoning. The *numinous banner* is the spirit’s banner. Thus, the phrase means that the spirit Wu Ying commands this banner for summoning. To instead take *Commanding Spirits* as the banner’s name grossly misrepresents the original meaning.

If we followed this logic, the *Scripture of Salvation* mentions “Heavenly Soldiers leading the way, the Great Marshal bearing the banner”—could we then establish a *Marshal’s Banner*? The *Nine Chapters on Generating Spirits* and the *Scripture of Salvation* are the most ancient and profound texts. The banner borne by the Great Marshal is no longer known in later ages, nor can the design of the banner commanded by Wu Ying be ascertained.

In general, when establishing fasts and rituals, banners, flowers, and images serve to complete the ceremonial forms—these are indispensable. Yet why must so many names and titles be invented to achieve spiritual resonance?

If a family of means wishes to create many banners and canopies, inscribing them with scriptures, incantations, or the august titles of Heavenly Worthies, this may express sincere devotion. However, such practices need not be excessive.

The two banner designs derive from the Numinous Treasure’s *Ritual Texts for Hoisting the Banner*. Minister Zhai of recent times once compiled a version, which is also found in the *Complete Rites of the Jiang Clan*, though it does not belong to the ancient *Guangcheng* tradition.

Recent schools have also added three or four sections of incantations, which are not transcribed here in full.

At the initial hoisting of the banner, though rites include invocations and prayers, the words need not be excessive. Yunzhong, with due reverence, has appended his humble draft of the banner-hoisting text to the right, provisionally for practical use. Should the officiating adept prefer more elaborate and refined compositions, they may freely substitute their own.

**Section on Stabilizing Trust and Ritual Dignity**

The *Rites of Master Guangcheng* state: Sincerity is demonstrated through the heart, and wealth stands foremost. Where wealth may be relinquished, the heart follows in kind. Sacred and numinous communion responds to the heart’s intent. High Heaven and profound Earth, the Mystic Sages and Supreme Perfected—without trust, there is no communion; without heart, no resonance. The pinnacle of resonance lies in trust.

Thirteen golden dragons, each weighing one tael and measuring three cun and six fen, are used: ten to stabilize the ten directional altars, and three to accompany the petition slips. The *Rites* specify: The Son of Heaven and Empress use the finest gold; dukes and ministers, secondary gold; commoners, silver or copper gilded. The dragon serves as Heaven’s courier, foremost in transmitting resonance and communication. Bearing the petition, it conveys trust to the Three Officials; swearing oaths, it pledges before the Ten Poles. Thus, the method of stabilizing trust begins with the dragon. Deficiencies are examined by the Bureau of Yin Officials.

Eleven segments of colored silk stabilize the ten directions, with one segment designated for the pledge of trust. The allocations are as follows:
- **East**: nine azure segments
- **South**: three crimson segments
- **West**: seven white segments
- **North**: five black segments
- **Upper Realm**: thirty-two jade-green segments
- **Lower Realm**: thirty-two yellow segments
- **Four Corners**: twelve yellow segments each

The total for the ten directions is one hundred thirty-six. The Son of Heaven uses bolts of silk; feudal lords, zhang-lengths; commoners, chi-lengths. For the life-destiny silk, the Son of Heaven and feudal lords use purple, while scholars and commoners use the color corresponding to their life-destiny’s *nayin*. Each adds one unit beyond their age to signify the pledge of extended life. The life-destiny silk is placed upon the central altar.

The *Rites* state: Patterned silk manifests the colors of the Five Phases, symbolizing the *qi* of the ten directions. It descends from the Ten Heavens, summons the Five Emperors, and communicates with the Perfected to pledge trust, entreat destiny, and invoke numinous power—none of which may be omitted. Deficiencies are examined by the Bureau of Heavenly Officials of the Mystic Capital.

Ten sets of paper, brush, ink, and inkstone are placed in the ten directions, with twelve sheets of paper allocated to each. The *Rites* state: When establishing fasts and performing the Dao, whether to deliver myriad generations of ancestors and departed kin, or to entreat blessings, beseech grace, dispel calamities, and repent transgressions, the Four Controllers, Five Emperors, Three Realms, and Ten Directions record merits, assess transgressions, and determine retribution. Thus, paper, brush, and ink serve as the register for recording merits and pledging trust to the ten directions—none of which may be omitted. Deficiencies result in the Ten Heavens and Five Emperors failing to record merits, and the Nine Dark Realms and Three Officials refusing to remit punishments. Deficiencies are examined by the Bureau of the Three Officials.

Ten trays of incense and flowers stabilize the ten directions.

The *Rites* state: Incense serves to communicate and connect, dispelling impurities and warding off defilements. Flowers, with their fresh purity, symbolize uprightness and offer precious reverence. When entreating blessings and invoking the True, incense and flowers form the foundation. Incense, such as aloeswood and sandalwood, descends the Perfected; flowers, born of fragrant and pure wood, are used. If flowers are unavailable, five-colored paper may be cut into their likeness to stabilize the ten directions—none of which may be omitted. Deficiencies result in examination by the Bureau of the Yang Officials.

**Stabilizing Rice**
Two *hu* and four *dou*.
The *Rites* state: Rice serves as a pledge of trust to the Celestial Officials, augmenting the rank and emoluments of the deities. Deficiencies result in examination by the Bureau of the Celestial Officials.

**Stabilizing Oil**
Two *dou* and four *sheng*.
The *Rites* state: Oil belongs to the yin category. Within yin, yang is born; thus, oil stabilizes yin, and the officials sustain the yang radiance. Deficiencies result in examination by the Bureau of the Yin Officials.

**Stabilizing Charcoal**
One hundred twenty *jin*.
The *Rites* state: Charcoal belongs to the yang category. Within yang, yin is born; thus, charcoal stabilizes yang, and the officials provide yin *qi*. Deficiencies result in examination by the Bureau of the Yang Officials.

**Stabilizing Coin**
Twenty-four thousand.

The *Rites* state: The twenty-four thousand stabilizing coins serve as a substitute for the pledge of superior gold, attesting to the sincerity of the Three Realms and proclaiming the covenant to the Ten Heavens. Deficiencies result in examination by the Bureau of the Mysterious Capital.

**Hibiscus Wood Tablets**
Three tablets, each one *chi* and two *cun* in length, two *cun* and four *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness.
The *Rites* state: Tablets serve to record and proclaim. They record the merits of the age and proclaim the covenant to the Supreme Perfected. Their upper and lower edges are perfectly square. The Son of Heaven uses jade for these, as jade possesses the nine virtues, embodying the trust of Heaven and Earth. All others use hibiscus wood or cypress wood. The Five Phases are delineated in cinnabar, and the nation’s name, year, month, location of the purification fast, and the name of the Dharma Master are inscribed upon them. They are cast into famous mountains and profound caverns, sacred springs and dragon lairs, or within the fast’s altar. They address the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, ensuring the purification fast is made manifest and the matter is memorialized to the Upper Realms. Deficiencies result in examination by the Nine Bureaus of the Earthly Officials.

**Jade Disks**
Thirteen in total: ten to stabilize the ten directions, each two *cun* and four *fen* in diameter, two *fen* in thickness, circular in shape with a hollow center; the remaining three are cast with the dragon tablets. The Heavenly Official uses a blue-green disk, circular in shape; the Earthly Official uses a yellow disk, square in shape; the Water Official uses a dark disk, hexagonal in shape. All have hollow centers and are two *cun* and a half in diameter.
The *Rites* state: Jade, with its virtue of purity and integrity, can ally with and move the Supreme Perfected, thus serving as a pledge. When casting the dragon tablets, they should be bound with golden cords wrapped in blue-green silk. The blue-green silk substitutes for cutting one’s hair, and the golden cords substitute for smearing blood, thereby proclaiming the covenant to the Three Officials. Deficiencies result in examination by the Nine Bureaus of the Earthly Officials.

**Golden Cords**
Twenty-seven in total, each nine *fen* in diameter, ring-shaped. Nine cords are used for each tablet. The Son of Heaven uses gold; others use silver gilded with gold, wrapped in blue-green silk, and cast together with the dragon tablets. The use of nine cords per tablet is specified in the *Scriptures and Methods of the Numinous Treasure*; the remainder follows the *Broad Compendium of Rites*. Later generations dare not alter this, though the *Broad Compendium of Rites* records only the tablets without talismans, inscribing only standard script on one side, while the scriptures inscribe seal script on one side. Whether to use them or not depends on the transmission of the master.

**Regalia for the Altar’s Exterior**
A pair of *jie* staffs. Made of five-colored silk, five tiers from top to bottom, suspended from the top of a pole with a golden dragon holding the ribbon.
A pair of *chuang* banners. With pearl canopies and pearl nets, one tier of eight angles, suspended from a pole. The wooden core features a dragon on the left and a tiger on the right, holding the ribbon.
A pair of *jing* banners. Similar to the *jie* staffs but without dragon or phoenix ribbons, three tiers, made of five-colored silk, suspended from a pole.
A pair of pearl pennants. Adorned with pearls, brocade, and jade pendants, held by a golden phoenix, suspended from a pole.
A pair of Five Brightness Fans. Carved from wood and decorated with gold and colors, depicting the sun, moon, and stars above, the Five Peaks in the center, and the seas and rivers below, mounted on wooden poles.
A pair of crane feathers. Carved from wood in the shape of crane wings, mounted on vermilion poles.
All the above regalia follow the *Broad Compendium of Rites*.

**Document Case**
Made of paulownia wood, one *chi*, two *cun*, and eight *fen* in length, two *cun* and eight *fen* in width. The center is carved to form three seal compartments, with a matching lid.
**Document Stand**
Two *chi* and two *cun* in length, eight *cun* in height, with curved legs. Made of catalpa or cypress wood. Violations of the rites result in the forfeiture of one’s allotted lifespan.

**Dragon-Head Writing Knife**
The blade is six *cun* long, forged from ancient iron. Half an ounce of silver is used to fashion a dragon’s head at the hilt. It is indispensable for bowing in submission, stabilizing seals, and inscribing documents.

**Incense Burners, Tables, Mats, and Cushions**
Twenty sets.

**Three Treasures Set**, one set; **Ten Directions Sets**, ten sets; **High Merit Master’s and Precentor’s Presentation Tables**, one set each; **Six Canopies**, six sets; **Outer Altar Incense Table**, one set—these are the quantities required for the fasting altar. Other locations may use different numbers.

In the *Yunzhong* tradition, the reverent study of ancient ritual regalia and instruments of faith follows established forms. All here conform to the *Broad Compendium of Rites*, and no major discrepancies exist among the various schools—save for the **Three Memorial Tablets** and **talismanic scripts**, which vary widely. The method transmitted to *Yunzhong* by his preceptor, the venerable Master Gao, adheres to the ancient ritual canon, including the **petition documents**, which follow the classical format. The talismanic inscriptions on the reverse of the tablets, however, derive from the master’s transmitted teachings. Those who inherit this method must observe it accordingly. Those who receive transmissions from other lineages may follow their own sources. If the **Three Memorial Tablets** bear talismans without clear provenance, they must not be used lightly; their origins should first be verified.

**Altar Canopy Diagrams and Ritual Regulations**
It is said: To worship Heaven and Earth and commune with the perfected spirits, one must erect an altar to express utmost reverence. Altar tiers and ranks each have their distinctions, but here we focus solely on the **Yellow Register Fasting Altar** and shall not discuss others.

The lamps outside the altar follow the ritual protocols of the **Perfected Immortals**, totaling one hundred fifty-nine lamps. In ancient times, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** were represented by twenty-eight lamps, a simpler arrangement. Wealthy households may now model the celestial forms of the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** and kindle lamps accordingly, which is especially auspicious. The **Star Chart of the Twenty-Eight Constellations** is appended below.

**Diagram of Outer Altar Lamps**
**Star Chart of the Twenty-Eight Constellations**
- **Eastern Palace (Seven Constellations)**: From *Horn* to *Winnowing Basket*, thirty-two lunar mansions.
- **Northern Palace (Seven Constellations)**: From *Dipper* to *Wall*, thirty-five lunar mansions.
- **Western Palace (Seven Constellations)**: From *Straddler* to *Three Stars*, fifty-one lunar mansions.
- **Southern Palace (Seven Constellations)**: From *Well* to *Chariot Platform*, sixty-four lunar mansions. (The star preceding *Well* is *Fourfold Iron*, hence the total of sixty-four.)

In all, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** comprise one hundred eighty-two lunar mansions. This chart is derived from the *Treatise on Astronomy* and the **armillary sphere**, differing from recently printed fasting altar diagrams. Over time, as woodblocks are recarved, the images gradually lose their authenticity. Thus, the armillary sphere is here taken as the definitive standard.

If only one lamp is lit per lunar mansion, a total of one hundred fifty-nine lamps are kindled. Should lamps be lit according to the celestial configurations, then the Twenty-Eight Constellations, together with all lamps within the altar, amount to three hundred thirteen lamps in all. Generosity or frugality may follow one’s means. Generally, burning incense and lighting lamps stand as the foremost acts of merit in ritual purification. Other superfluous expenditures may lead to diminution or loss. As the Dao models Heaven and emulates Earth, so too should the provision of lamps and candles be ample. Thus, after consulting astronomical records, this diagram is presented here. Those who preside over the rites would do well to examine it closely.

The ritual altar may be constructed with precious tiles, inlaid with patterned stone, temporarily assembled from bamboo and wood, or newly formed from rammed earth—whatever the method, it must conform to proper measurements to uphold the dignity of morning audience rites. It may stand beneath the open sky of the Three Luminaries to convey utmost sincerity, or be raised as a Terrace of Heavenly Treasure, modeled on the celestial realms, to serve as the foundation for establishing the purification rite and performing the Dao.

At its center, images of the Three Supreme Lords of the Great Dao are arrayed, as though in audience at Jade Capital Mountain. The altar is encircled by four tiers of balustrades above and below, with celestial gates, earthly portals, and flying bridges, all crafted with meticulous care and adorned with auspicious lotus motifs. These may number eighty-one, seventy-two, or sixty-four, arranged according to the altar’s dimensions. If fashioned from bamboo and wood, bound with thatch to symbolize the forms, it may also serve as a place for summoning the perfected.

The outer altar employs eight long *zuan* mats, eight gate placards, sixteen sets of cushions and mats, and one placard placed atop the *zuan*. This corresponds to the Ten *Qi*, hence no paired *zuan* are used to form gates. Only the southeast, at *Xun*, is left open as a gate; the rest are enclosed by balustrades.

- **East (Mao, Earthly Branch)**: *Zhen* Palace, *Dongqing* Qi—inscribed in green on a yellow placard.
- **Southeast (Xun)**: *Xun* Palace, *Fanxing* Qi—inscribed in yellow on a black placard.
- **South (Wu, Earthly Branch)**: *Li* Palace, *Dongyang* Qi—inscribed in vermilion on a white placard.
- **Southwest (Kun)**: *Kun* Palace, *Fanyang* Qi—inscribed in yellow on a black placard.
- **West (You, Earthly Branch)**: *Dui* Palace, *Shaoyang* Qi—inscribed in white on a green placard.
- **Northwest (Qian)**: *Qian* Palace, *Fantong* Qi—inscribed in white on a black placard.
- **North (Zi, Earthly Branch)**: *Kan* Palace, *Dongyang* Qi—inscribed in black on a red placard.
- **Northeast (Gen)**: *Gen* Palace, *Fanyuan* Qi—inscribed in yellow on a black placard.

The central altar employs eight long *zuan* mats and four gate placards, with one placard placed between every two *zuan* to form a gate. Twenty short *zuan* mats and twenty sets of cushions and mats are used.

- **Northwest (Hai)**: Celestial Gate—inscribed in green on a black placard.
- **Southeast (Si)**: Earthly Portal—inscribed in yellow on a red placard.
- **West (Shen)**: Moon Gate—inscribed in yellow on a white placard.
- **East (Yin)**: Sun Gate—inscribed in yellow on a green placard.

These four placards, along with long and short *zuan*, are arranged outside the central altar, with only the Earthly Portal and Celestial Gate left open.

The inner altar employs eighteen long *zuan* mats, ten gate placards (also placed between pairs of *zuan* to form gates), ten short *zuan* mats, and ten sets of cushions and mats.

- **East (Mao)**: Gate of *Qinghua Yuanyang*—inscribed in vermilion on a green placard.
- **Southeast (Chen)**: Gate of *Shiyang Shengqi*—inscribed in white on a yellow placard.
- **Below (Si)**: Gate of *Jiuling Huangjing*—inscribed in yellow on a red placard.
- **South (Wu)**: Gate of *Dongyang Taiguang*—inscribed in yellow on a red placard.
- **Southwest (Shen)**: Gate of *Yuanhuang Gaochen*—inscribed in white on a yellow placard.
- **West (You)**: Gate of *Tongyin Jinque*—inscribed in black on a white placard.
- **Northwest (Xu)**: Gate of *Jiuxian Fanxing*—inscribed in white on a yellow placard.
- **Above (Hai)**: Gate of *Daluo Feifan*—inscribed in green on a black placard.
- **North (Zi)**: Gate of *Yinsheng Guangling*—inscribed in green on a black placard.
- **Northeast (Yin)**: Gate of *Lingtong Jinshang*—inscribed in white on a yellow placard.

These ten placards, eighteen long *zuan*, and ten short *zuan* are arranged outside the inner altar. Though ten placards would typically require twenty long *zuan*, only eighteen are used here because the two corner gates share a single post, reducing the total.

The altar comprises three tiers, and this method employs sixty-four *zuan* mats: thirty-four long *zuan*, each thirteen feet in length, and thirty short *zuan*, each ten feet long. Twenty-four gate placards are used—seven black, five yellow, three white, three green, and four red—adorned with the five colors, carved from wood into plaques, and painted with images of flying immortals amid clouds and *qi*, all executed with precision and artistry. Three tiers of *zuan* are bound with green and crimson cords, each five hundred feet in length, to demarcate the sacred and separate it from the profane. Only the southeast gate is left open.

The canopy for the Three Officials is set to the east of the altar, and the canopy for the Three Masters to the west, each furnished with curtains, images, tables, and ritual implements as prescribed. The Three Officials oversee the registers of merit for the Three Primes, verifying the accomplishments of the purification rite. The Three Masters serve as the foundation for salvation, transmitting the scriptures and ordaining the Three Masters. The principle of honoring the lineage of master and disciple dictates that their positions be arrayed to the left and right of the ritual altar.

The seats for the Nine Ancestors are placed to the southeast of the altar, facing the altar from afar, to facilitate the deliverance of the Nine Dark Realms and the purification of the distant ancestors. The seats for the Five Emperors, traditionally positioned on altars in the five directions, are here placed north of the Three Masters’ canopy due to the altar’s limited space, with a separate curtained enclosure opposite the Three Officials. Each is provided with tables and ritual implements for offerings, arranged for convenience.

The seat of the Grand Ritual Master is positioned south of the Three Masters. The seat of the Earth God is placed to the southwest of the altar, facing it from afar, to oversee the transmission of petitions and the invocation of the Supreme Mystery. In all purification rites, the Earth God holds primacy, and thus a seat should be prepared accordingly.

The above follows the method of Master Guangcheng. In the old ritual system, the central altar measured thirty-two feet across, the inner altar twenty-four feet, and the outer altar extended beyond the central one. For modern constructions, the dimensions should adapt to the available space, with *zuan* mats arranged accordingly. The Guangcheng method provides a general standard for long *zuan*; short *zuan* may be adjusted to fit the altar’s size.

In the Guangcheng ritual system, if the seating arrangements for the Five Emperors cannot be placed upon the altars of the five directions, it is permissible to set up tents before the altar for convenience. Thus, one tent is designated for the Five Emperors, one for the Three Officials, one for the Master of the Mysterious Center, one for the Master of Scriptures and Ordination, and one for the Grand Ritual Master—totaling five tents. In recent times, a sixth tent has been added for the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master, making a total of six. According to the Guangcheng system, the Five Emperors occupy the first tent to the west of the altar, the Master of the Mysterious Center the first tent to the east, the Three Officials the second tent to the east, the Three Masters the second tent to the west, and the Grand Ritual Master the third tent to the west. With the addition of the Heavenly Master, the arrangement becomes: the Five Emperors in the first tent to the west, the Master of the Mysterious Center in the first tent to the east, the Heavenly Master in the second tent to the west, the Three Officials in the second tent to the east, the Three Masters in the third tent to the east, and the Grand Ritual Master in the third tent to the west.

This follows the ancient Guangcheng system, wherein the Masters of Scriptures and Ordination do not occupy the Heavenly Gate, nor is there a tent for the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master. The present arrangement stems from the Orthodox Unity tradition of the Longhu Mountain altar, which venerates its ancestral masters, hence the addition of a tent for the Heavenly Master and the Three Masters of Orthodox Unity, with the Masters of Scriptures and Ordination positioned at the Heavenly Gate. This, however, deviates from the ancient rites. Moreover, when performing rituals according to the Lingbao tradition, one should adhere to the ancient Guangcheng system.

**Seats for the Nine Ancestors**
These are the nine ancestors of the ritual sponsor, for whom offerings are made to deliver and elevate their souls. In collective Huanglu rituals, each participant arranges seats for their nine ancestors. The ancient system requires these seats to face the altar from afar, but if the space is too narrow to accommodate them, adjustments may be made as circumstances permit.

**Seat of the Earth God**
In ancient times, when initiating rituals at the altar, one first performed rites to inform Heaven, thus the ceremonies were simple yet solemn. Outside the altar, a separate seat for the Earth God was required as the primary recipient of petitions and invocations. Today, beyond the main altar, additional altars are often set up for the ritual arena, where marshals, generals, and local deities are arrayed. As times have changed, the Earth God is already included among these positions, and a separate seat is no longer necessary.

**Seat of the Supervising Deity**
In ancient rituals, when establishing an altar, one would summon troops and horses to guard the ritual space, ensuring that morning petitions and divine communications were conveyed through the celestial hierarchy. Later practices varied in complexity, with ritual documents and petitions becoming more elaborate. Thus, when petitioning the City God or other local deities of the sacred register to oversee the rites, a separate seat may be arranged in the corridor or near the gate. Daily offerings of wine and fruit are made, and at the conclusion of the ritual, their merits are reported collectively. This does not depart from ancient tradition, and the seat may be arranged as circumstances allow.

**Hall of the Divine Tiger**
This is a ritual format of the Great Lingbao Tradition. Later generations, seeking tangible responses in soul-summoning rites, established this arrangement. A clean and secluded chamber should be prepared, with sacred seats arranged according to the ritual system. The following deities are to be enshrined:

- The Lady of the Mysterious Darkness of the Northern Dipper,
- The Lady of the Purple Prime of the Great Unity,
- General He of the Left Jade Bureau of the Divine Tiger,
- General Qiao of the Right Martial Bureau of the Divine Tiger,
- The Seven Jade Maidens of the Departments of Soul-Summoning and Spirit-Seizing,
- The Envoy of the Upper Department for Pursuing Souls,
- The Envoy Wei of the Middle Department for Pursuing Souls,
- The Envoy Zhang of the Lower Department for Pursuing Souls,
- General Liu, the Warden of Prisons,
- General Lu, the Merit Officer of Soul-Gathering,
- The Divine General of Soul-Ordering, the Army of the Great Unity,
- General Liu, the Divine General of Soul-Confronting,
- General Ma, the Great General of Soul-Pursuing of the Divine Tiger,
- And all subordinate officers, generals, and troops of the Departments of Soul-Pursuing and Spirit-Seizing.

Offerings of tea, broth, wine, and fruit should be abundant and pure. To the left, establish the Altar of Yang Radiance for Penetrating Barriers; to the right, the Altar of Yin Spirits for Seizing Souls; and in the center, the Altar of the Eight Gates for Summoning Souls. No unauthorized persons should enter, and the rites must be conducted strictly according to the method. The altar design is detailed in the *Divine Tiger’s Summoning and Seizing* section.

**Hall of Refinement and Salvation**
The ritual system compiled by Master Guangcheng dates to the Da Shun era of the Tang dynasty, a time when the rites of refinement and salvation had not yet been practiced. In recent times, this ritual has flourished, and thus the arrangement of sacred seats and the design of the hall lack a fixed standard. In Zhejiang, a separate hall is often established, where sacred seats are arranged, and a jiao offering is conducted before performing the refinement rites, entirely independent of the main ritual arena. In several prefectures of Jiangdong, the rites are performed directly before the Supreme Emperor within the ritual arena. Another method involves conducting the rites within the ritual arena, facing the Supreme Emperor, with the refinement officials seated opposite in the corridor, and a separate jiao altar set up to face the Supreme Emperor. Since the Lords of the Wood and Metal, the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperors, and the various Perfected Lords are already enshrined within the ritual arena, no separate seats are required.

These practices lack ancient precedents, and one should follow the traditions of one’s master. This text pertains to the Lingbao tradition. According to this method, the refinement officials and generals should be positioned on both sides of the ritual arena, with the jiao rites conducted thereafter. When bowing to the memorial and invoking qi, one faces the Supreme Emperor. Alternatively, if a separate chamber is established, the Perfected Lords should be enshrined within it.

In ancient times, the rules for morning petitions emphasized the altar as the focal point. Today, while altars are still erected to perform rituals, the construction of the ritual arena and the display of sacred images serve the rites themselves. Establishing a separate Hall of Refinement and Salvation outside the ritual arena would be excessively cumbersome. Moreover, refining and delivering the souls of the departed is a difficult task, relying on the prayers and invocations of the Perfected Spirits to summon the dual qi, which may slightly aid the submerged souls. Talismans serve as tokens to summon qi, while incantations are the sounds of Heaven. Only then can one mobilize the primordial spirit-qi and harmonize the dual forces of generation and transformation—this is the essence.

If one merely pursues elaborate decorations, daily adding strange and extravagant elements, and meticulously arranging the altar with intricate designs, all such efforts are in vain. Today, it suffices to conduct the rites before the Supreme Emperor within the ritual arena. To the left, set up the Fire Pool; to the right, the Water Pool. The ritual master stabilizes the qi, focuses the spirit, and performs the rites according to the system—what obstacle could there be?

Need one resort to endless deceit and trickery before the rites can be performed? Temples and abbeys themselves vary in size, and how much more so the dwellings of ordinary households—how could they all possess ample space to set up separate chambers for each purpose? If the ground cannot be kept pure and clean, such efforts only lead to profanation. It is most convenient to conduct the rites within the ritual arena itself, or if the hall is spacious and uncluttered enough to accommodate the arrangements, then adapt as circumstances allow.

When invoking the Divine Tiger to perform the rites of summoning and control, a separate hall must be established, distinct from the Refining and Salvation chamber. The sacred ranks of the Refining and Salvation ritual are as follows:

**Eastern Azure Emperor Lord,**
**Southern Vermilion Emperor Lord,**
**Western White Emperor Lord,**
**Northern Black Emperor Lord,**
**Central Yellow Emperor Lord,**
**Venerable Spirit of Salvation and Immortality,**
**Great Spirit Sima of Salvation,**
**Elder Han the Life-Nurturer,**
**Lord of Life Records,**
**Lord of Longevity and Fortune,**
**Lord of Salvation from Calamity and Rebirth,**
**Lord of Soul-Forge and Spirit-Casting.**

**Officers and Generals of the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau,**
**Officers and Generals of the Nanchang Refinement Reception,**
**Great Spirit of the Cinnabar Heaven of Dragon Might,**
**Great Spirit of Reversal and Rebirth,**
**Great Spirit of Radiant Essence and Mystic Brilliance,**
**Great Spirit of Returned Form and Transcendent Transformation,**
**Lads of the Ninefold Light and Fire Bell,**
**Jade Maidens of the Eastern Well and Yellow Blossoms,**
**Officers and Generals of the Fire Pool Refinement,**
**Officers and Generals of the Water Pool Refinement,**
**Officers, Generals, and Clerks of the Great Dharma Bureau of Numinous Treasure,**
**Officers, Generals, and Clerks of the Yellow Register Court’s Salvation Bureau,**
**Officers, Generals, Clerks, and Soldiers of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Monitoring Bureau,**
**Officers, Generals, and Clerks of the Life-Salvation Bureau of Mandated Ranks.**

**The Sutra-Recitation Hall**
This is the most solemn affair in the fast. According to ancient methods, entering the oratory to face the fast, the recitation of scriptures takes precedence. For thirty-six or forty-nine days, Daoist adepts are first assembled to recite the scriptures, with the Three Treasures’ altars set in the center.

Within the oratory chamber, a seat is prepared for the High Master, where the Celestial Master or the patriarch of the ritual lineage is also enshrined. The adepts line both sides, while the ritual master performs the rites, concentrates the spirit, and inscribes talismanic scripts—all conducted here.

**The Enclosure**
This is the place where offerings are measured and prepared, sheltered from wind and rain. Whether using *jiao* grass or pure thatch, it should be situated in a secluded and tranquil location, free from the clamor of people and animals. The space should be as expansive as possible, adapted to the available area. A thatched hut is constructed in the shape of a walled enclosure, within which the measured offerings are placed. Around it, vegetarian dishes and other offerings may be arranged, all kept pure and clean. By first delivering the multitude of souls, the spirits for whom the rites are dedicated will also receive blessings.

Many officiants, however, do not understand this principle. The High Master, too, often fails to grasp the fundamental purpose of the fast and instead defers to the officiant’s wishes. They exhaust themselves in laboring for the directly dedicated spirits while neglecting the universal salvation of all souls—how foolish this is! In the eastern regions of Zhe, this matter is particularly neglected; practitioners should reflect deeply upon it.

**Offerings for the Fast**
Seasonal fruits and fresh produce must be pure and clean. According to ancient protocols, when establishing a fast, these are replaced daily. Avoid pomegranates, sugarcane, and any items soiled by mud; fruits still on their branches are best. Before the Three Treasures of the Supreme Emperor, arrange tea, broth, and fruits, offering them according to ritual propriety. Before the six canopies and their attending generals and spirits, prepare vegetarian dishes, pure foods, and other offerings. When presenting these to the divine perfected and, below, to the Daoist adepts, all must be immaculate.

Avoid dairy products such as butter, milk, *tihu*, fermented milk, and cheese, as these are considered impure. Ensure that no remnants of the six livestock—skin, fur, claws, or hooves—fall into the food. Prohibit cats, dogs, and other animals from defiling the ritual arena or the pure fast. Each morning, when the incense burner is lit, tea is presented; after the great thanksgiving, broth is offered. Today, broth is often omitted—adjust as circumstances allow, consulting the master for details.

The standards for ritual vestments have already been recorded in the *Huanglu Guangcheng* liturgical manuals and need not be repeated here.

Master Jin Yunzhong, a scripture master and High Master Gao, migrated south from the capital during the early Shaoxing era, spreading his teachings along the Jiang and Huai regions. The Great Dharma of Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure that he practiced was an ancient tradition, transmitted since the late Tang and Five Dynasties period. In his later years, Master Gao retired to Xin’an, where he presided over countless Yellow Register fasts, all strictly adhering to ancient canons rather than the later, privately altered rites.

His method centered on the *Scripture of Salvation*, and his fasts followed the *Guangcheng* liturgical manuals. He first received transmission from Master Tang, who passed it to Vice-Observer Liu. Master Liu, in turn, transmitted it to Jin Yunzhong. Though presuming to carry on the tradition, Jin adhered entirely to the established canons. Thus, the diagrams of the ritual arena and canopies used today are all based on the fixed methods of the former scripture master, High Master Gao, and are identical to the *Guangcheng* manuals.

However, the recently printed *Huanglu Altar Diagrams* by Master Tian differ slightly, particularly in the arrangement of the six canopies. While the *Guangcheng* manuals do not include them, this version elevates the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master and the Three Masters, placing them above the Three Officials. The *Guangcheng* manuals state that the Three Officials reside on the eastern side of the altar, while the Three Masters’ canopy is on the western side.

The external lamp diagrams follow the *Jinlu* ritual lamp protocols. If no ritual invocations are performed, lamps are not set out—this, too, is a practice High Master Gao adopted from the *Du Guangcheng* manuals.

Master Jin Yunzhong, as a salvation master, received the fast rites a second time from Master Jiang Jiusi of the Orthodox Unity ancestral altar, and the memorial rites from Master Tian Jushi. Salvation Master Liu personally received the precepts from Master Jiang, who said: “I received these rites from Master Tian, swearing an oath before Heaven to adhere strictly to the ancient *Guangcheng* methods.” Master Jin now follows this tradition, which is both the fixed method of High Master Gao and the transmitted intent of Master Tian.

Though the printed altar diagrams bear Master Tian’s renowned authority—having been created for the ancestral altar at one time—once the rites were sworn before Heaven, they were bound to the ancient canons. Today, we dare not abandon the old forms in favor of these diagrams, for that would be to betray the true principles and burden our masters.

Master Jiang Shuyu of Yongjia compiled the *Huanglu Licheng Yi*, in which the six canopies all follow the *Du Guangcheng* manuals, though their sequence differs slightly. Here, the Celestial Master and the Three Masters are placed above the Three Officials, whereas the *Guangcheng* manuals state that the Three Officials reside on the eastern side of the altar, with the Three Masters’ canopy on the western side.

The text further states: The Five Emperors’ seats were originally placed upon the altars of the five directions. If the altar space is too narrow, a separate canopy may be set north of the Three Masters’ position, aligning with the Three Officials, with the Great Master of the Mysterious Center opposite. In this arrangement, the Five Emperors’ canopy occupies one position on the western side of the altar, while the Mysterious Master’s canopy occupies one on the eastern side. Since the altar faces south with its back to the north, if the Five Emperors are said to reside north of the Three Masters’ canopy and opposite the Mysterious Master, then the Three Officials’ canopies must occupy two positions on the eastern side, and the Three Masters’ canopies two on the western side—this is clearly delineated.

In later times, with the addition of the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, he was positioned below the Three Officials and above the Three Masters, such that the Celestial Master faced the Three Officials, while the Three Masters faced the Supervisors of the Fast. There is no ambiguity in this.

However, from the Later Tang dynasty onward, the *Luotian Jiao* rituals and the *Three Thousand Six Hundred Sacred Ranks Diagram* printed by imperial decree during the Xuanhe era of the Song placed the ranks of the Five Masters far below the Three Officials and the Four Saints. Additionally, the *Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Ranks Jiao Ritual* of the Lingbao tradition, also carved in stone at the Tianqing Abbey in Fuguang during the Xuanhe era, positioned the Three Officials above the Five Masters. This has been the case from ancient times to the present.

The current arrangement, where the Mysterious Center Master is opposite the Five Emperors, follows the *Guangcheng* manuals. Placing the Celestial Master above the Three Officials, however, may not be entirely appropriate. The altar diagrams compiled by Yunzhong adhere to Master Gao’s original forms and dare not alter them. Should later practitioners possess other scriptural evidence, they may follow their own transmissions. Yunzhong’s examination of ancient canons and his masters’ teachings aligns perfectly; though there may be minor discrepancies with contemporary rituals, he ultimately does not dare to deviate from antiquity or betray his masters in pursuit of the times. Others may not follow this example.

Master Gao’s full name has already been recorded at the end of the scroll.

**Section on Jade Scripts of the True Seal**

The Scripture states:
At Crimson Clarity’s unfolding of the chart,
The measures of destiny proceed naturally.
The Primordial Beginning establishes tranquility,
Unfurling the five sections.
Crimson writings of jade graphs,
Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts.
They safeguard and regulate the kalpas’ turning,
Ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.

These are the Great Brahma-Ancestral *Qi* of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
Transforming and engendering the jade graphs,
Issuing the scripture to deliver humankind.

As for the *Central Scroll of the Numinous Writ*,
It exists from the inception of the unfolding chart.
“Central” denotes the *qi* of harmonious balance,
Fused to form the scripture—hence the *Central Scroll*,
Presided over by the Luminous King of Filial Dao.

The five *qi* divide and array into five positions,
Thus the crimson writings of jade graphs,
The five sections unfurl—
Presided over by the Five Venerable Thearchs.

The *Central Scroll* is placed last,
Embodying the principle of “the head below in the generation of beings,”
Thus the Crimson Writ precedes it.

Yet the true graphs and incantatory formulas
Originate from ancient scriptures.
Later scholars find them difficult to practice,
So the Most High took brush in hand,
Resolving obfuscations and expounding the subtle, primordial words of the ancient texts.
When the various Heavenly Worthies recite the jade sounds,
The ten directions echo in chorus.
The Thearchs establish rites,
Spirits and demons submit,
Heaven is pacified, earth is stabilized—
Their efficacy is boundless.

In this degenerate age,
The true Dao readily recedes,
The profound principle becomes obscured.
Worldly customs,
Mired in prior perceptions,
Often esteem what was first obtained.
Worldly customs prize the unusual,
Yet deem the commonly possessed as base,
And the fortuitously acquired as treasures.
Worldly customs value difficulty,
Again esteeming the hard-won as marvelous,
While dismissing the easily obtained as trivial.

Thus, when worldly masters attain the subtle,
They seldom transmit it to others.
Blind masters deceive the world,
Each erecting divergent doctrines,
Perpetuating delusion in succession,
Thereby misleading later generations.

Now, having examined the immortal scriptures
And compared them with the supreme methods,
We strive for simplicity and essentials,
Preserving but a thread of the mysterious warp.

**This is the writ of utmost perfection, wondrously responsive to spontaneity,**
**Causing Heaven’s heights to clarify,**
**Earth’s foundations to secure and stabilize,**
**The Five Marchmounts to safeguard and guard,**
**The ten thousand kinds to abide therein.**

**For all methods employing the Vermilion Script, one must first submit a petition.**
**If one proceeds without petition, there will be no benefit.**
**In antiquity, perfected adepts used the Five Chapters of Vermilion Script**
**To pacify, ward off, and subdue.**
**Some cast them into renowned marchmounts and cavernous abysses**
**To erase the ledgers of transgressions,**
**Inscribe their names in the Nine Heavens—**
**This is precisely that.**

**For casting the tablets:**
**When petitioning the Water Thearch to erase the ledgers of transgressions,**
**Inscribe in vermilion upon a silver-wood tablet,**
**Wrap it in azure paper, bind it with azure thread,**
**Attach a golden dragon as escort,**
**Use nine golden clasps for the tablet case,**
**And cast it into the abyss of the Three Rivers.**
**When petitioning the numinous marchmounts,**
**Also inscribe in vermilion upon a silver-wood tablet,**
**With golden dragon and golden clasps,**
**All as in the previous method,**
**And bury it in the marchmount of one’s life-destiny,**
**Or in a blessed land or renowned mountain.**
**When petitioning the Nine Earths’ Earth Thearchs,**
**Follow the same form,**
**And bury it in the central palace of one’s dwelling.**

**Upon the tablet, inscribe the master’s rank and surname,**
**The year, month, day, and hour of birth,**
**And the vow: “May I attain spirithood, attain immortality,**
**And live forever without dying.”**
**For water palaces, append:**
**“Nine Palaces’ Water Thearchs, Twelve River Sources,**
**Yangtze, seas, Huai, and marshes,**
**Vast and cold great spirits,**
**I beseech you to erase my transgressions,**
**That they may ascend to the Nine Heavens.**
**Respectfully I approach the Water Palace,**
**By golden dragon swift transmission.”**

**The beginning follows the same form;**
**At the end, add a separate line:**
**“In the year of the Grand Year [X], month [X], day [X], hour [X],**
**At [location], this petition is submitted.”**
**On the reverse of the tablet, inscribe the true writ;**
**On the obverse, inscribe the petition text,**
**And seal it with the proper talisman.**
**When casting the tablet,**
**Kindle the incense burner,**
**Submit the petition,**
**Recite the incantation,**
**Cast the tablet,**
**And close the incense burner—all in due order.**

**If the writ is placed in the five directions,**
**The marchmounts’ immortal officials will arrive.**
**If one maintains a hundred-day fast,**
**Cultivates with unbroken focus,**
**Then the celestial perfected will descend.**
**Merely wearing this writ ensures liberation through simulated death.**

**Inscribed in vermilion upon five-colored stone,**
**Disasters and calamities will self-annihilate,**
**Malevolence and cruelty will self-dissolve.**
**If the Five Marchmounts are inaccessible,**
**Then in one’s place of residence,**
**Select the mountains of the four directions—**
**These may also serve as the Five Marchmounts.**
**The direction of one’s life-destiny becomes the life-marchmount,**
**Taking its image to summon the numinous *qi* of spirits—**
**There is nowhere it does not reach.**

**Thus, the Brahman *qi* unfolds in radiance,**
**Emerging as charts to measure the world.**
**Without writ, there is no illumination;**
**Without writ, there is no clarity;**
**Without writ, there is no completion;**
**Without writ, there is no deliverance;**
**Without writ, there is no engendering.**
**Therefore, the hundred demons conceal their rhymes,**
**Separating and uniting spontaneously,**
**Adapting to the times to govern affairs,**
**Employing writ according to circumstance.**
**Thus, the Five Writs’ Vermilion Script,**
**The secret seal of the central chapter—**
**All may be separated or united for use.**

**Incantation for Casting Tablets upon the Sacred Peaks**
On one’s natal day, the *jiazi* day, or the day of *Lichun*, inscribe the vermilion script of the East. Beginning from the East, proceed to "Ascended Immortal," comprising twenty-four characters. On the day of *Lixia*, inscribe the vermilion script of the South, beginning from the South to "Great Yang," comprising thirty-two characters. On the equinoxes and solstices, inscribe the vermilion script of the Center, beginning from the Center to "Myriad Spirits," comprising forty characters. On the day of *Liqiu*, inscribe the vermilion script of the West, beginning from the West to "Upper Immortal," comprising forty-eight characters. On the day of *Lidong*, inscribe the vermilion script of the North, beginning from the North to "Jade Stairs," comprising forty characters. Write upon white slips according to the color of each direction, noting the name and date as in the tablet-casting rite. After nine years, the immortal officials of the five directions shall arrive, dispatching the Jade Maidens of Azure Waist, Vermilion Scepter, Yellow Simplicity, Supreme Simplicity, and Supreme Mystery to appear.

Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:
**Mysterious and exalted numen,**
**Venerable deities of the Highest Origin.**
**Great sages wander in cycles,**
**Myriad saints descend in audience.**
**Three luminaries spread their radiance,**
**Auspicious clouds array on four sides.**
**I present the celestial charts,**
**Calculating the reckoning of the nine heavens.**
**Today I initiate my vow,**
**Casting my slip upon the sacred peaks.**
**Cinnabar script in vermilion characters,**
**Natural writ of true essence.**
**I proclaim to the Five Emperors,**
**Inscribing names in the jade ledger.**
**Myriad spirits bear witness,**
**Sun and moon attest in clarity.**
**May I attain deliverance, may I attain life,**
**May I attain divinity, may I attain immortality.**
**Heaven and earth, stars and constellations,**
**Mutually illumine my body.**
**The Three Offices, Nine Bureaus,**
**Five Emperors and great deities.**
**Universally I proclaim without end,**
**Erasing the roots of transgression.**
**The Highest Origin opens wide,**
**None shall reject my words.**
**Nine generations of ancestral souls,**
**Receive blessings by nature’s grace.**
**The Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings,**
**Forever parted from the Eight Perils.**
**May I join the Three Luminaries,**
**Sharing radiance in the Purple Court.**
**The wheel of rebirth unceasing no more,**
**My body attains flight as an immortal.**

When the incantation concludes, read the inscribed slip aloud, then cast it upon the summit of a sheer cliff, scattering flowers upon the sacred peaks. Again knock the teeth three times, face the direction of one’s natal star, and recite:
**The Highest Origin bears witness,**
**Immortal names are now inscribed.**
**The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus,**
**Transgressions are absolved and removed.**
**Scatter flowers to the Five Emperors,**
**Proclaim alliance with the Great Void.**
**As petitioned, I pray—**
**To dwell eternally through ten thousand kalpas.**

**Incantation for Pacifying Constellations and Averting Celestial Disasters**
The vermilion scripts of the five directions summon the stellar officials of their respective quarters, governing the degrees of celestial patterns and averting disasters. Pacification is achieved by stabilizing each direction accordingly.

For the East, begin with Jupiter and write to "Disaster Hosts," comprising thirty-two characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon green paper, expose in the central courtyard for nine days and nights, then burn according to the method, scattering the ashes into azure smoke. Carve the script upon green stone and bury it.

For the South, begin with Mars and write to "Life Numen," comprising thirty-six characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon green paper, expose in the central courtyard for three days and nights, then burn as before. Carve the script upon red stone and bury it.

For the Center, begin with Saturn and write to "Swift Transmission," comprising forty characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon green paper, expose in the central courtyard for twelve days and nights, then burn as before. Carve the script upon yellow stone and bury it.

For the West, begin with Venus and write to "Northern Origin," comprising twenty-four characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon green paper, expose in the central courtyard for seven days and seven nights, then burn as before. Carve the script upon white stone and bury it.

For the North, begin with the North Star and write to "Wheel Radiance," comprising thirty-two characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon green paper, expose in the central courtyard for five days and five nights, then burn as before. Carve the script upon black stone and bury it.

In each case, face east with unbound hair, knock the teeth twelve times, and recite:
**Highest Origin of heaven,**
**Three luminaries in lofty clarity.**
**Revolving radiance shines forth,**
**The four directions gleam in purity.**
**Where the celestial reckoning collides,**
**Meteors surge and scatter.**
**Five divisions err in course,**
**Three sequences lose their peace.**
**Five Celestial Ladles govern the stars,**
**Seven lodgings in numinous brilliance.**
**True Lord, Great Chief,**
**Whose tabooed name is Jade Essence.**
**Consort of the Human Sovereign,**
**Whose name is Nurturing Infant.**
**Together they govern the Mysterious Pass,**
**Revolving the eternal patterns of heaven.**
**Today’s inauspicious omens,**
**I solemnly proclaim in mystery.**
**With true writ and vermilion script,**
**I present this to the heavens above.**
**Disheveled, I repent my faults,**
**Baring my cinnabar sincerity.**
**May you deign to witness in mystery,**
**Restoring the celestial canon.**
**Qi shall not stray in chaos,**
**Disasters shall not arise in chaos.**
**Burning the numinous writ,**
**Scattering smoke in the Jade Court.**
**Upper luminaries bear witness,**
**Universally proclaimed to the myriad spirits.**
**Qi dissolves at the Three Passes,**
**Disasters vanish in the Nine Nether realms.**
**Yin and yang harmonize,**
**The land attains great peace.**
**Respectfully by golden dragon,**
**Wind and fire swift transmission.**

When the incantation concludes, expose the true writ in the central courtyard, placing each in its respective direction, and seal it with a golden dragon, burning it according to the day. Carve the script upon stone of the appropriate color and bury it for pacification. Use lamps for illumination and patterned silks as tokens of the pact.

**Incantation for Subduing and Summoning**
Before receiving the higher methods, one must first subdue demonic spirits. When demonic essences are subdued, divine luminaries shall naturally arrive.

For the East, begin at "Eastern Mountain" and write to "Stabilize and Extend," comprising thirty characters. Inscribe in vermilion upon a green wooden slip. For the South, begin at "Northern Subjugation" and write to "Crush and Perish," comprising thirty-two characters. Inscribe in yellow upon a red wooden slip.

For the Center, begin at "Divine Command and Subjugation" and write to "Before One," comprising sixteen characters. Inscribe in white upon a yellow wooden slip. For the West, begin at "Vermilion Script" and write to "Imperial Lord," comprising sixteen characters. Inscribe in black upon a white wooden slip. For the North, begin at "Northern Mountain" and write to "Crush and Destroy," comprising twenty-four characters. Inscribe in green upon a black wooden slip.

When reciting the incantation, always face the northeast.
For the East, recite nine times; for the South, three times; for the Center, twelve times; for the West, seven times; for the North, five times.
In all cases, knock the teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath and retain the qi for nine cycles, then recite the incantation while looking upward:

The Three Origins seal their radiance, revolving the celestial constant.
As the reckoning of numbers concludes, the hundred and six ride in strength.
At the great kalpa’s convergence, myriad demons contend in motion.
The Northern Feng does not restrain, releasing the lineage of wandering ghosts.
Hordes of demons rampage unchecked, malevolence obscuring heaven’s light.
The Supreme Emperor issues his decree, proclaiming it to the ten directions.
He expounds the celestial measures, unfolding the teachings of the Dharma.
The true Dao governs the people, sweeping away all misfortune.
What petty demons dare assemble to bring calamity?
The vermilion script and jade writ command the realm of ghosts.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng swiftly transmit and enact.
A thousand demons are bound in clarity, ten thousand ghosts surrender their forms.
Flowing bells interweave their brilliance, stirring the qi of the Great Yang.
Golden tigers patrol the four quarters, celestial soldiers seize the fugitive.
Great and small alike must arrive—none may conceal or hide.
This is the decree of the Primordial Beginning, to be memorialized before the heavens above.

The Summoning Dragon, Celestial Water Spirit, Halting Water, and Crossing Water Incantations avert the great calamities of heaven and earth. When floods surge forth in all directions, this talisman may be used to dispel and halt them. It may also command dragons to open waterways, creating a direct path for safe passage.

**East:** From "自下制" to "无问," thirty-two characters in total, written in yellow on blue paper and cast into the water.
**South:** From "南河" to "不从," forty-eight characters in total.
**Center:** From "中山" to "普闻," forty-eight characters in total.
**West:** From "西山" to "驿传," forty-eight characters in total.
**North:** From "九河" to "风驰," twenty-four characters in total.

For each direction, as with the East, knock the teeth five times, hold the breath for twenty-five cycles, and visualize a fire arising from one’s heart and mind, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees of the four quarters, as well as one’s own body, reducing all to ashes. Let the ashes scatter and ascend upon the blue smoke, leaving nothing behind. Envision the great waters surging and sweeping across the land, while one’s own body transforms into a dragon, flowing with the current.

Then knock the teeth twenty-five times and recite the incantation:
*"The supreme qi returns its numinous power, illuminating the Nine Origins.
Heaven revolves and earth turns, the Three Qi flow in transmission.
The Five Phases press upon one another, the mechanism of destiny unfolds.
Yin and Yang clash in opposition, congealing into calamitous collisions.
The great kalpa reaches its end, sweeping away the miasma of demons.
The Nine Rivers receive their reckoning, torrents surge through the streams.
Let the waters not linger, let birds and beasts gather in flocks.
Sun and moon meet in darkness, the Three Luminaries halt their course.
The chosen divine ministers array the jade writ of dragons.
Abandoning evil and exalting good, the clear and turbid are forever sundered.
I am inscribed in the Emperor’s register, my name listed among the Nine Heavens.
When the four great disasters converge, the vermilion script dispels them.
On this day, the decree is proclaimed, and the myriad spirits all hear.
Sun, moon, and the Five Planets illuminate my soul.
The sacred mountains of the Five Peaks float to ferry my body.
The Water Palace of the Nine Rivers, the great spirits of the vast deep,
Open the depths of the waterways, unblock the river fords.
Dragons respond to the talisman, seizing mountains and sending clouds.
Bearing me and ferrying me, they race in startled flight across the four quarters.
Vermilion script and crimson characters, the true writ of the Primordial Beginning.
The golden dragon’s courier route proceeds without cease.
Swiftly it is memorialized, presented before the Imperial Lord."*

Upon completing the incantation, draw in the qi twenty-five times and swallow it. In an instant, water spirits will block the path; if in the mountains, the mountains will float; if in the water, the waters will part. This is called "facing peril and saving oneself in the blink of an eye." When nations suffer from floods, one may also establish a fast, and with sincere heart, perform this rite.

At the beginning of the kalpas, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning moved the primordial qi and true essence, transforming them into numinous writ to govern the kalpas, protect nations, and pacify the people. Those who in past lives accumulated blessings and good affinities may encounter this scripture. The people of ancient times, simple and unadorned, merged with the Dao and did not require fasting or abstinence; their practice brought immediate response. In this degenerate age, human hearts are scattered and corrupted, few uphold the orthodox, and many stray from the true. To perform this method, one must follow the writ of the Three Origins, establish a fast, practice the Dao, and with focused mind, inwardly align with the mysterious sages to achieve resonance. Otherwise, one may be tested by demons, and the effort will be in vain.

One should select a person of purity and seclusion, perform the rite in a place untouched by worldly dust, at a sacred mountain or numinous site, to await the response and manifest the compassion of the Great Dao in delivering beings, the grace of the Most High in saving all. Let those who propagate the teachings strive diligently!

**Master Guangcheng’s Discourse on the True Writ**
In the past, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, when the primordial chaos had just divided and the Three Qi unfolded the diagram, transformed the primordial essence and true unity of the Great Dao into the numinous treasure of the vermilion script, congealing it into writ. It descended upon the five directions to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth, summoning and commanding the true spirits. Thus it is said: heaven and earth obtain it to be pacified and stabilized; the sun and moon obtain it to shine brightly; ghosts and spirits obtain it to be delivered; and the people obtain it to attain longevity.

When the true writ is transmitted in the world, it eliminates heavenly disasters above and protects and stabilizes the emperor. Below, it dispels poison and harm to deliver the multitudes. It subdues gods and ghosts, rescues the sunken and drowning, and accomplishes all things without exception.

The scripture states: *"Without writ, there is no illumination; without writ, there is no radiance; without writ, there is no establishment; without writ, there is no completion; without writ, there is no deliverance; without writ, there is no life."* It also states: *"The vermilion script and jade characters, the eight mighty dragon writs, preserve and govern the kalpas, ensuring the heavens endure long—such is the wondrous efficacy of the five chapters of the Numinous Treasure true writ."* Thus it can stabilize the heavens and divide the degrees, harmonize yin and yang, deliver the flying souls, protect and guard the emperor, rescue the drowning and sinking, bridge the hidden and the manifest, reconcile grievances and absolve faults, avert death and prolong life. The sufferings of life and death are all saved without exception.

When establishing a fast, place the true writ and jade characters to stabilize the five directions. Upon concluding the altar rites, gather and burn them, scattering the ashes into the blue smoke, in accordance with the jade instructions.

If a scholar cultivates the true to seek deliverance for oneself and transcend the world, inscribing one’s name in the ranks of immortals and forever departing the offices of ghosts, one should on the days of the Three Origins, the eight solar terms, or the jiazi and benming days, write the writ on a jade tablet and cast it into a sacred mountain. This erases the records of past-life sins, and one’s name ascends to heaven. Each matter is performed three times, and the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and various heavens record one’s meritorious deeds. The heavens distinguish friends and kin, the myriad spirits respectfully guard, the Five Emperors attend, the Three Realms’ administrators welcome, and the thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not rashly interfere.

The scripture states: *"With firm resolve and aspiration, all endeavors succeed. The seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the blessings of life and death respond in kind."*

**Master Guangcheng’s Further Discourse on the Central Chapter**
The Yellow Register Fast primarily delivers the hidden souls, transports the flying spirits, opens the path for the long night, and ascends those trapped in the dark springs—this is its great purpose. Yet it also drives away disasters and brings forth blessings, repents transgressions and seeks favor, universally cultivates the practices of humans and heavens, and benefits both families and nations. Its merit extends without exception.

The Five Elder Lords’ Vermilion Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, when examined for their functions, serve but four purposes:

First, to seek immortality and receive the Dao—these are the twenty-four characters descending from the nine qi of the Eastern Quarter.

Second, to exorcise and regulate the stellar spirits—these are the thirty-two characters beneath the Year Star’s "Assisting the Liver."

Third, to subdue and vanquish demonic forces—these are the thirty-two characters beneath the "Spell of the Eastern Mountains’ Deities."

Fourth, to dispel and eliminate the nine harms—these are the thirty-two characters beneath "Subjugating the Eastern River Below."

The uses of these five sections are thereby complete.

Zhang Wanfu of the Pure Capital Abbey in the Western Capital, in his *Rites and Rules of the Celestial Master*, states: "The hidden languages of the heavens, the Jade Scripts of the Eight Assemblies, were expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the Fragrant Grove Garden to the youths of superior wisdom. They deliver from the five sufferings and universally succor the nine dark realms. In the rites for transporting spirits, they are carved into stone and employed. Now, in the Yellow Register’s rites of deliverance, these texts must be used. Whether for auspicious or inauspicious occasions, they are weighed and applied accordingly, that they may circulate for eternal kalpas. The incantations, when burned and offered, share the same efficacy as the true texts. Those who possess the established methods should together propagate them."

The Central Chapter of the Numinous Scriptures, also called the Hidden Language of the Great Brahma, is further known as the Hidden Language of the Thirty-Two Heavens:

Eight Heavens of the Eastern Quarter,
Eight Heavens of the Southern Quarter,
Eight Heavens of the Western Quarter,
Eight Heavens of the Northern Quarter,
and the Central Quarter.

This method originally lacks this central talisman, which has been incorporated from another version. The *Natural Jade Script of the Yellow Emperor’s Qi Heaven* from the Great Luo Heaven of the Supreme Numinous Treasure.

After dispersing the altar, read the script at night facing the appropriate direction. Upon completion, the disciple shall hold the script aloft in the incense smoke while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times. The incantation reads:

"Most High and Revered, Great Sage of Supreme Honor,
You spread transformation and circulate qi through the Thirty-Two Heavens.
The Eight Assemblies and Nine Radiances naturally form the script,
Pacifying and stabilizing heaven and earth, safeguarding and governing kalpas.
The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command universally notifies the Three Origins.
Below, it commands the Nine Earths; above, it concerns all heavens.
At the center, it announces to the seas and mountains, the great peaks and rivers.
Today, this proclamation ascends—all spirits hear it.
In performing purification fasts and practicing the Dao, deliver the hidden souls.
The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus eradicate the roots of transgression,
Eternally delivering from the Three Paths and the source of the Five Sufferings.
Generation after generation, they receive blessings, their names inscribed in the cinnabar register.
Spirits ascend to heaven, refined and transformed by nature.
The gates of life and death open for deliverance—through endless kalpas, they endure.
The Nine Heavens’ decree is transmitted by wind and fire."

Justly and reverently, we reflect upon the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, who revealed the true mechanism before the kalpic revolutions and unfolded the numinous chart at the inception of heaven and earth. The red-script jade characters dispersed across five scrolls, initiating the nurturing of the cosmos and presiding over creation. Descending in accord with the times, they circulate in response to the turning of the ages. Thus, above, they regulate the celestial canons and harmonize the qi’s seasons; in the middle, they pacify and secure the state, protecting and stabilizing the emperor; below, for scholars seeking immortality and entering the Dao, they dispel demonic trials and accomplish meritorious deeds. When used to pacify the directions, the altar grounds become pure and solemn. Cast into mountains, rivers, and peaks, they erase transgressions and inscribe one as immortal. This is the primordial precept within the jade instructions, the fundamental purport of the supreme scriptures.

After the purification fast is established, the five scripts are used to stabilize the altar and perform the fast, ensuring the success of the ritual. Upon completion, the tablets are cast into the mountains, rivers, and earthly administrations, beseeching that the merits of the fast be recorded and transgressions expunged. The Yellow Register’s casting of the three tablets derives from this. In recent times, reckless individuals, failing to investigate the origins and transmission, have fabricated talismans and inscribed them on the reverse of the tablets. Some even alter the talismans according to the season, a practice most unorthodox. How could they comprehend the wonders of the five scrolls or the efficacy of the numinous script, which can be employed in separation or combination, averting all misfortune and delivering all beings? Moreover, the red-script jade characters rightfully occupy the opening of the *Great Numinous Treasure Dharma*. Their inclusion in the middle of the fast’s procedures allows practitioners to understand that the rites of pacification and the forms of casting tablets truly originate here. It is certainly inappropriate to fabricate talismans according to俗 conventions and employ them recklessly.

As for dispersing the fast and casting tablets, these belong entirely to the fast’s procedures, detailed in the *Chapter on Casting Dragon Tablets and Sending Simplified Scripts*. The three incantations—*Dispersing the Altar*, *Announcing the Tablet*, and *Casting the Dragon*—should be thoroughly contemplated. How could other talismans be used on the reverse of the tablets?

*Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Dharma*, Scroll Eighteen—concluded.
*Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Dharma*, Scroll Nineteen.

**Chapter on the Standards of Fast Rituals**

In ancient times, those who practiced the Dao cultivated virtue within and stirred sincerity from the depths of their being. Establishing the altar and presenting memorials to the heavens took precedence, while conducting rituals began with focused contemplation. Thus, following the submission of the petition to initiate the fast, the next step was to ascend the altar and proceed according to the ritual canon. Yet in the present age, the forms of reverence have grown more elaborate than those of the ancients. Though these practices have been long observed across the land, they cannot be abolished overnight. Most of the additions consist of invocatory prayers. Without the creation of grand scriptures and litanies, they cannot all be removed. However, the elements currently in use often lack order. Some follow the formats of the *Zhengyi* registers and ritual canons, while others incorporate miscellaneous invocations from various traditions. Daoist assemblies, seeking to prepare for all contingencies, inevitably compile and record them together, unaware that their origins differ and their phrasing varies. Moreover, the high priest’s invocations should be deeply attuned to the circumstances. The *Dongxuan Lingbao* ritual canon compiled by Yunzhong cannot be casually adopted or indiscriminately applied. The *Extensive Compendium* by Master Guangcheng includes only the fast procedures, omitting the invocatory prayers and memorial petitions found in older canons. Therefore, in accordance with the principles of the original tradition, I have revised and unified the texts for petitions and announcements. This is not done to display my own work but to ensure conformity with the *Dongxuan* ritual statutes. Those who do not practice this tradition may adopt these texts for other lineages, but this would greatly deviate from their original intent—just as this tradition’s rituals cannot be mixed with those from other texts.

**Rite of Memorial Presentation**

First, establish the positions of the Great Master of the Mystic Center and the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master. If the six canopies have already been unfurled, place the memorial documents and dispatches in a purified casket before the Mystic Master. The high priest and the fast’s officiants each offer incense and bow. Next, the high priest kneels and recites the petition to present the documents. This practice is common in most regions, except in the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures, where local customs prevail. This text is intended for general use, not for a single locality.

**Incense Invocation (as prescribed):**
The officiant, [Name], reverently burns incense and bows twice, addressing the Great Master of the Mystic Center, the Heavenly Master of the Three Heavens who Upholds the Teachings and Assists the Primordial, the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response, the Perfected Lord of the *Lingbao* Scriptures, the Perfected Lord of the *Lingbao* Registers, and the Perfected Lord of the *Lingbao* Salvation:

"By the power of this true incense, I humbly offer reverence. This incense is the radiant blossoms of jade, the congealed smoke of the nine qi. Its fragrant clouds weave a dense canopy, piercing the nine heavens. May the Golden Lads who attend the incense and the Jade Maidens who transmit words carry my petition to the presence of the Emperor. May my supplication be heard and granted as spoken.

I have heard that before the Primordial Chaos took form, the undifferentiated qi congealed into truth. When the Five Primes divided, the Three Vehicles emerged to establish the teachings. The Dao is revealed through teaching, and teaching is transmitted only by masters. Moreover, the rituals of the fast are truly the highest service to the honored masters. Reflecting on my long reliance on the shelter of the Mysteries and my unworthy place among the ranks of the Perfected, I cannot in good conscience suppress the petitions that have been submitted.

Previously, [Name] submitted a petition to establish the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast at [Location], dedicating its merits to the state and the sovereign, extending blessings to all beings, universally delivering the lost and obscured, and broadly bestowing grace upon the unseen realms. May these virtuous fruits be offered to deliver the departed soul of [Name], elevating them to the realm of light. Thus, may the sufferings of the Three Paths cease, and the cycles of the Six Realms come to rest.

I humbly lead the assembly of practitioners in conducting this fast, pledging our vows to heaven and earth and proceeding according to the ritual canon. Yet, mindful of my humble and insignificant learning, I fear the sincerity of the fast may not reach its destination. To seek the oversight of heaven, I must rely on the grace of the masters.

Reverently considering the Five Perfected Lords of *Lingbao*—whose learning illuminates the hidden and the manifest, whose merits equal the workings of creation, who divide their forms to descend and teach, propagating the true Dao to guide humanity, establishing vows to bring peace to the age, and revealing the Mystic Canon to save all beings—all who cultivate virtuous fruits look to the Perfected Masters. Every prayer and supplication is subject to their review. Now, as the ritual proceedings are about to commence and the fast’s time has arrived, I dare to present this memorial, invoking the rulers of yin and yang. May the sincerity of the fast be heard above, and may its compassionate intent be universally conveyed.

Humbly hoping for your compassion and pity, may you deign to look upon us with mercy. Issue your true decree, instructing the Mystic Bureau to dispatch the registers, generals, and soldiers of the appropriate ranks. Urge the attending divine officials to transmit the memorials and petitions, guiding and conveying our heartfelt sincerity. May the myriad Perfected Ones be addressed without delay, their commands executed in an instant. May the Three Realms hear and respond, their blessings swiftly bestowed. All memorials and petitions are to be transmitted accordingly. I pray for your true decree, that my humble sincerity may be fulfilled.

I have presumptuously trespassed upon the masters’ authority, and my heart is filled with awe. Overwhelmed by trepidation, I earnestly beseech your grace."

The assembly of Daoists, bearing the memorial documents, is led by the cantor to the station of the Merit Officer. The documents are arranged before them, and the officiant strikes the chime to commence the ritual. One member of the assembly recites the *Incense Verse*. (In some regions, this is omitted, following local custom.)

Next, the *Water Verse* and *Wine Purification* are recited. The high priest transforms his spirit, paces the stars, burns talismans, and summons the generals—practices observed in all regions.

The invocator announces the *Three Offerings* text after the generals are summoned. After the three offerings are completed, the high priest dismisses the assembly. In some regions, the high priest personally announces the text, following local customs for summoning the generals. Upon completion, the invocation is recited.

**First Wine Offering:**
"I have heard that the Three Qi gave rise to the beginning, blending indistinctly in the era of Dragon Han. The Three Designations were distinguished, shining brilliantly after the Red Clarity. They refined the pure and turbid, giving birth to Kan and Li, compassionately encompassing the Dharma realms to deliver beings across kalpas, and extending virtue to distant lands to establish teachings in every direction. They expounded the wondrous canon of the Three Vehicles and arranged the subtle registers of the Four Assistants, inheriting blessings that illuminate the hidden and manifest, and bestowing grace equally across past and present."

Thus, the Three Clarities and Ten Poles must each adhere to their prescribed forms in drafting the invocation. The Three Realms and Ten Directions may follow the ritual protocols to transmit the official documents. Hereby, the offices of transmission are prepared, the bureaus of memorials are arrayed, the disciplines of the Daoist laws are strictly observed, and the earnest prayers of the people are conveyed. As the matter requires formal announcement, it is now respectfully presented to the proper authority.

According to the petitioner’s intent, the present document is meticulously transcribed and reverently dispatched to the Merit-Official Messenger, the Memorial-Submitting Clerks, the Soldiers of the Divine Armies, the local earth gods, the lords of the domain, and all those whose duty it is to receive and transmit the decree. Since they have deigned to descend to the altar, the first wine offering is now presented. The officiant burns incense and bows, then recites the *Scattering Flowers* hymn.

**Second Wine Offering:**
I have heard that the Dao, in its vast operation, is impartial, and Heaven, though silent, responds with perfect efficacy. Though spirits may be moved by sincerity, without written words, communication would be difficult. Moreover, the Scarlet Writings of the Three Caverns open myriad paths to save the world, while the Orthodox Scriptures of the Ten Directions propagate the Dharma to deliver beings. Since the proper offices exist, the ritual forms must be strictly observed. Now, as the documents are prepared for dispatch, we are fortunate that the divine chariots have arrived. With humble offerings, we present our deepest sincerity. Though the gifts are meager, the heart is truly earnest. May the gods accept them as we reverently offer the second libation.

**Third Wine Offering:**
I have heard that flying clouds and speeding chariots traverse the void, manifesting without fixed form, their majestic power long established. They ascend through the clouds to the celestial realms, reaching the distant Yang; they enter the hidden and dark, traversing the Yin domains. They convey the commands of the Supreme Mystery and transmit the prayers of the human world. Through talismans and official documents, petitions and memorials are communicated. The Ten Directions rely on them, and the Three Realms depend on their aid. They assist Heaven and uphold the teachings with devoted diligence, guiding reverence and sincerity to manifest merit. Their duty is most vital, and their rites must be duly performed. Thus, the eternal protocols conclude with the third libation.

**Invocation Text:**
I humbly consider that though Heaven is high, it may be reached through sincerity; though the spirits are hidden, they may be moved by the heart. Thus, the interaction between Heaven and humanity—though one is hidden and the other manifest—is not truly separate. When a single thought is pure, the myriad Perfected observe it. As the transmission of documents is about to be completed, we fear the divine chariots may be delayed. Now that the offerings are concluded and the documents are ready for dispatch, we prepare the official petition and respectfully present it.

The official documents have been proclaimed. We now invoke the divine chariots to ascend, arranging their reins and soaring through the void, that the golden palaces and jade chambers may receive our sincerity in an instant. May the divine courts and hidden bureaus swiftly transmit the documents and talismans. O Perfected Officers of the Nine Heavens and Six Earths, Lords of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, who dwell in the highest reaches of the Great Void and gaze down into the bottomless depths, wherever the documents are destined, dispatch them according to their urgency. Let no moment be delayed—execute this with utmost haste. Depart swiftly and return promptly; we await your response.

The bell is sounded to conclude the preceding rites.

**Dedication of Merit:**
The merits of the memorials just offered benefit the state and extend to both the manifest and hidden realms, universally bestowing good fortune. May all who participate attain the Supreme Dao.

**Announcement of Dedication:**
The merits of the memorials, boundless in their good causes, are dedicated to the establishment of this grand fast. We humbly pray that the myriad Perfected observe us, that the host of sages bestow their radiance, that the fast proceed without demonic interference, and that the good works be accomplished. For these supreme causes, we invoke the Ten Directions’ *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*, whose merits are inconceivable.

The memorials are now concluded; the officiants return to their positions.

**Ritual for Issuing Talismanic Decrees:**
The officiants arrange themselves before the altar of the Supreme Emperor. The bell is sounded to intone the name of the Heavenly Worthy.

The High Priest steps forward, burns incense, and kneels to memorialize:
Your servant has heard that through words, sincerity is conveyed, and through objects, sincerity is expressed. With this pure and tranquil incense, we humbly reach the realm of the Void and Non-Being.

*Dao Fragrance, Virtue Fragrance, Non-Action Fragrance,*
*Non-Action Pure and Tranquil Fragrance,*
*Pure and Natural Fragrance,*
*Wondrous Cavern True Fragrance,*
*Lingbao Wisdom Fragrance,*
*Fragrance Transcending the Three Realms,*
*True Fragrance of the Three Realms.*

With this incense now burning, we reverently memorialize the *Wuji Ziran Yuanshi Heavenly Worthy* of the Supreme Clarity’s True Realm, the *Dongxuan Lingbao Heavenly Worthy* of the Highest Clarity, the *Dongshen Daode Heavenly Worthy* of the Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm, the *Jade Emperor of the August Heaven*, the *Polar Emperor of the Purple Tenuity*, the *Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity*, the *Taiyi Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Blue Palace*, and the *Jade Sovereign Below the Golden Portal*.

By the power of this fragrant cloud, we humbly extend our memorial. The incense is like jade blossoms scattering light, the nine *qi* congealing into mist, a dense cloud of fragrance ascending straight to the Nine Heavens. May the Golden Lads attending the incense and the Jade Maidens transmitting words convey your servant’s memorial to the Emperor’s presence. May the Emperor grant your servant’s request as petitioned.

Your humble servant, [Name], in fear and trembling, dares to present his foolish sincerity, humbly beseeching the celestial grace to deign to hear his plea. Your servant has long been sheltered by the wondrous blessings and is fortunate to serve among the Dharma colleagues. Having received the worldly petitions, he has thus propagated the true scriptures. On the [day] of this month, he has prepared and submitted a memorial on behalf of [Name], who has reverently established the *Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast*. According to the ritual protocols, talismanic decrees must be issued. The talismans have already been inscribed in the retreat, and the next step is to seek the imperial mandate for their proclamation.

We now humbly beseech Your Majesty to grant the *Yuanshi Talismanic Decree*, the *Golden Register White Tablet*, the *Savior from Suffering True Talisman*, the *True Talisman for Breaking Hell*, the *True Talisman for Delivering Souls from Darkness*, the *Precious Register for Heavenly Ascension through the Great Kalpa Pardon*, the *Nine Dragon Talismanic Decree of the Eastern Blue Palace Savior from Suffering*, and the *Taiyi Xuanming Hunyuan Divine Tiger Jade Tablet*. May these be universally bestowed upon the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Six Caverns and Nine Netherworlds, the sacred mountains and great rivers, the city gods and earth deities, and all relevant domains. May they open the gates, pardon sins, and release the imprisoned, delivering the deceased [Name] and the ten classes of hidden souls, as well as the suffering spirits of the Three Wretched Paths. May all depart from their respective domains, gather at the fast altar, receive the imperial grace, and ascend in due time.

I humbly reflect that while talismans are adorned with phoenix-script and cloud-seal characters, their power is wielded through human hands. Yet when their commands are executed, they become the celestial decrees of the Dao. Thus, we swear to seek the imperial mandate, reverently hoping that the boundless compassion of the Supreme Benevolence will bestow its mercy.

May the punishment for this foolish minister’s reckless transgressions be pardoned, and may the suffering of all beings sunk in darkness be pitied. Special orders are hereby issued to the relevant generals and officers to proclaim and execute the decree, universally notifying all offices of the Three Realms to comply and adhere to the statutes. This minister now makes this announcement and awaits the bestowal of grace with reverence.

This minister, having presumptuously offended the celestial majesty, stands in trembling awe, awaiting judgment with utmost urgency and trepidation. Thus, I respectfully submit this plea.

The High Priest maintains visualization as prescribed, while the Daoist assembly, bearing the talismanic commands before the Emperor, performs the *Huaxia* procession to the designated site of proclamation. First, incense, candles, wine, and fruit offerings are prepared, following the rites of memorial submission. One member of the assembly chants a gāthā and consecrates the wine, while the High Priest undergoes spirit transformation and burns the talisman to summon the generals.

From the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Law, incense is kindled to summon the Flying Celestial Divine Kings of the Ten Directions, the *Jiaolong* couriers of the Mysterious Capital, the Earthly Merit Registrars, the Divine Lords of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars, the Divine Tiger Generals He and Qiao, the Jade Maidens of the Seven Departments Governing Souls, the Three Divisions’ Soul-Pursuing Envoys Zhang, Hou, and Wei, the Prison Inspector General Liu, the Soul-Gathering Generals Zhang and Lu, the Soul-Ordering and Soul-Confronting Divine Generals, the Great Soul-Pursuing General Ma, the Yang-Shining and Yin-Spirit Soul-Summoning Envoys, all relevant officials, generals, officers, and soldiers of this bureau’s soul-pursuing and spirit-seizing rites, the Elder of the Yellow Springs and Hao-Li, the local Earth Gods, and the tutelary deities of the domain—hasten to the altar without delay. Hasten, hasten!

The visualization is complete. The assembly now invokes the divine generals, officers, and soldiers to descend and attend the altar.

The officiants present incense and bow. Tea is offered, and the High Priest intones the invocation or the announcer proclaims the declaration.

**First Libation of Wine**
We humbly submit: the Lingbao scriptures establish the rites of ascension, and the Lower Prime manifests the ceremonies of deliverance. The Purple Void gathers its luxuriance to form the text, while the Red Jade radiates its brilliance to inscribe the talismans. Originating in the Upper Realms, they serve as the foundation for pacifying heaven and anchoring earth. Descending to the mortal world, they expand the path of deliverance from death to transcendence. We beseech heaven to grant its mandate, permitting the proclamation of these rites. Having arranged the ritual and prepared the altar, we first present our petition.

This bureau, acting upon the petitioner’s intent, has already transcribed the words and listed the requests, submitting the memorial in reverence. Now we await the decree, invoking the Primordial Talismanic Mandate of the Lower Prime, the Golden Register and White Tablet, the True Talismans for Deliverance from Suffering, Breaking the Hell Realms, and Rescuing the Shades, the Precious Register of the Most High for Pardon and Ascension to Heaven, the Nine Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Palace, and the Mysterious Dark Tiger Talisman of the Supreme Unity’s Primal Jade Slip.

May these be transmitted throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Nine Ramparts of Profound Yin, the Ten Caves and Six Heavens, the Night Palaces of the Yellow Springs, the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands, the Sacred Peaks and Riverine Deities, the Earth Gods and Underworld Bureaus, the Yellow Springs and Hao-Li, the Three Primes and Nine Offices, the One Hundred Twenty Departments, the Bureaus Governing Souls and Spirits, and all celestial prisons, earthly hells, and affiliated domains. Open the gates, absolve transgressions, dissolve grievances, and eradicate faults. Universally summon the sunken souls and lead them to partake in heaven’s grace.

We now invoke the divine lords, generals, officers, and all assembled spirits to heed the teachings of the Primordial August Lord and uphold the statutes of the Most High Dao Lord. As pledged in the Azure Heaven of Primordial Beginnings and in accordance with the regulations of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, act with utmost urgency and respond in due time.

The altar observes its customary rites; the offerings are duly presented. The ritual officiants prostrate themselves in sincerity to perform the first libation. The officiants present incense, bow, and recite a hymn of scattered flowers.

**Second Libation of Wine**
We humbly submit: the merit of this ritual is most profound, extending great clemency to the gates of the underworld. The power of the Dao is boundless, melting profound compassion into the dark earth. The couriers of the Mysterious Capital are dispatched to proclaim the True Talismans of Deliverance from Suffering. The Flying Celestial Divine Beings descend with the Nine Dragon Mandate, while the scriptures of the Supreme Unity’s Dark Mystery and the chapters for summoning ghosts, along with the divine authority of the Great Tiger Generals, assume their roles in calling forth the souls.

The celestial decrees shine brightly—how dare we not comply? The divine might blazes forth—how could they not heed and obey? The cloud-borne chariots have descended, and the messengers have arrived. The rites of sacrifice demand their proper observance; the second libation is duly presented. The officiants present incense, bow, and recite a hymn of scattered flowers.

**Final Libation of Wine**
We humbly submit: the sacred talismans and secret scripts command and dispatch the myriad spirits. The jade chapters of the medicinal satchels thereby propagate the multitude of methods. Having arranged the forms of the ritual fast, we open the gates of salvation and deliverance. The White Tablets and Vermilion Writs are sent forth, dispatching the flaming dragons to traverse all realms. The Purple Scripts and Jade Edicts command the divine tigers to act with singular purpose.

The statutes and decrees illuminate the Ten Caves and Nine Netherworlds; the summons extend through the Three Paths and Five Roads. All rely upon divine power to exalt heaven’s blessings. Now that the altar’s offerings are arrayed and the rites are solemnly observed, we must summon the departed souls to respond and universally call the suffering shades to attend.

The matter admits no delay; the rites follow their proper forms. We respectfully present the three libations to fulfill our devotion.

*As before, the text is proclaimed.*

Bowing in reverence, we invoke the sacred writs of the Nine Poles and the proclamations of the Three Heavens, to be swiftly proclaimed and urgently issued. Summon the wandering souls, that they may swiftly respond. The ritual documents of the fast altar shall now be solemnly recited.

The official dispatch has been duly announced. All deities have received and acknowledged it, each proceeding to their underworld offices. Bowing once more, we recall that the August Emperor has decreed the statutes, and all spirits heed his command. In accordance with canonical rites, we descend to rescue those sunk in darkness, deliver the departed souls, and lead them from suffering. From the highest Three Realms to the deepest Nine Netherworlds, across renowned mountains and local domains, city gods and village altars, wherever the scales of sin and merit are weighed, wherever the bureaus of souls hold sway—wherever these decrees reach, let them be obeyed in timely manifestation. We rely upon the aid of divine spirits to make the Daoist rites resplendent. Swift as thunderbolts, may the response be immediate. The spirit-money and paper horses are distributed, borne by wind and fire through the courier stations.

**Submitting the Petition to Announce the Fast**

In ancient times, the fast rites were solemn and uncluttered, free from excessive complexity. Later generations, though less sincere than the ancients, gradually expanded upon the old canons. The *Ordinances of Master Guangcheng* prescribe that the petition to announce the fast be submitted at the time of erecting the ritual tent, during the invitation of the Mystic Master. Before the Master, one first reads the official statement, after which the fast officer offers incense and submits the petition, then declares the purpose of the fast to the Mystic Master. This is followed by ascending the altar to lodge the preliminary prayers.

This reflects the ancient practice of merely presenting memorials, without the later additions of advance petitions or pre-announcements, hence the submission of the petition during the fast itself. In more recent times, the *Established Rites of the Jiang Clan* prescribe that the petition be submitted in the oratory, with the High Priest ascending the seat. After one reads the petition aloud, the High Priest descends, seals the covenant, and retires to the fast. Only then is the ritual tent erected and the Master invited. Before the Mystic Master, the petition is submitted again in accordance with the ancient ordinances, resulting in redundancy.

The system transmitted by Master Yunzhong strictly adheres to the *Ordinances of Guangcheng*. In the oratory, the High Priest takes his proper seat, and the official roster is first confirmed. The fast officer offers incense, after which the Master of Ceremonies kneels to deliver the petition, inviting the Dharma Master to ascend the altar. The petition states that the Dharma Master has already taken charge of the fast, and having completed the memorials, the great fast now approaches its appointed time—thus, the Master is invited to ascend the altar and conduct the rites. There is no need for the fast officer to make further entreaties. This follows the proper memorial procedure.

The High Priest is then led from the oratory to erect the ritual tent. Before the Mystic Master, the fast officer declares the purpose of the fast, presents the petition in its case, and the High Priest delivers the address. This address states that the grand fast has been established, the memorials have been received by the Supreme Mystery, and the decrees have been issued across the Three Realms. Now, the altar is to be ascended, the preliminary prayers lodged, and the Dharma Master invited to conduct the rites in accordance with the ordinances. This approach aligns with practical needs and avoids unnecessary redundancy.

Moreover, before the fast’s date is set or the preliminary memorials are submitted, the Dharma Master is invited to preside. After the initial petition is submitted to announce the fast, and the proper memorials are presented, the High Priest takes charge of the proceedings, having already communicated with the Three Realms. At the time of ascending the altar, what is submitted is not a petition to invite the Master, but rather the Green Petition. The system compiled by Yunzhong strictly follows the transmitted teachings and does not seek innovation. If those who preside over the rites cannot adhere to this, or if they prefer to follow contemporary customs, they may proceed as they see fit, each according to their own tradition.

The High Priest, fast officers, and Daoist assembly line up in the oratory. The Dharma Master then offers incense, standing in the High Priest’s position. The Master of Ceremonies announces the official roster, and all below the High Priest discard their name placards. The Master of Ceremonies kneels to deliver the petition, inviting the High Priest to conduct the rites:

*"I, [Name], serving as Master of Ceremonies for this fast altar, bow twice and humbly address the assembly:*

*We have heard that the Red Writs expound the teachings, and the Yellow Registers transmit the sacred texts, stabilizing earth and pacifying heaven. Above, they uphold the kalpas; below, they bring blessings to households and nations, delivering both the manifest and the hidden. Such is the great achievement of the Middle Vehicle, the profound essence of the Cavern Mystery. Without the accumulation of past merit, how could one establish such extraordinary causes? One must possess innate spiritual insight to propagate these true scriptures.*

*With reverence, we consider the Great Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable [Name], whose Dao is profound and spirit radiant, heaven-endowed with pure profundity. Jade tablets and sacred scrolls coil within his breast; cloud-script and phoenix-characters flow from his brush. His inner virtue is profound, and thus his external resonance is manifest. Now, the sponsor of this fast has roused his resolve, and the assembly has pledged its devotion, jointly cultivating this supreme good cause to extend boundless great blessings. Having already taken charge, he has submitted the decrees. Today, we solemnly establish this jade altar, and it is time to unfold the Dharma rites. We humbly pray that, drawing upon your innate wisdom, you may greatly manifest the numinous wind, dispelling the delusions of the hidden and manifest, and serving as a model for humans and gods. Bowing to the assembly’s request, may you array the immortal’s regalia, raise the standards, and establish the altar’s precincts. We, your servants, can scarcely express the depth of our earnest entreaty."*

*The High Priest responds:*

*"We have heard that the supreme Dharma of the Cavern Mystery and the profound ordinances of the Yellow Registers were first distinguished by Master Simplicity, who propagated the fast rites. Later, Lord Zhang of the Pure Capital examined the ancient forms and meticulously compiled the canons. Though the transmission of teachings through generations gradually took shape, the framework of the Dharma was not yet complete. Then came Master Guangcheng, who delved into the scriptures of the Three Vehicles, investigated the origins of the Four Supplements, and composed the *Ordinances of the Yellow Registers* to elevate the standards of the Cavern Mystery. In every matter, he provided clear explanations, organizing them for all to see, establishing a model for ten thousand generations and a reliance for the ten directions. Entrusted to those of the Dao, these rites propagate the supreme fast altars, and from ancient times to the present, they have been regarded as weighty affairs.*

*As for myself—a late learner from the mountains and forests, a solitary wanderer among the clouds and waters—I have presumptuously taken my place among the ranks of the Dharma Registers, yet remain unversed in the depths of the teachings. Compelled by the fast sponsor’s request, I have lightly taken on this great cause. Following the books transmitted by my teachers, I have presumptuously assumed the leading role. Fortunately, the memorials have been heard, and I am not permitted to decline. Yet I still rely upon the fast sponsor’s unwavering sincerity from beginning to end, that it may strengthen my devotion."*

Relying entirely upon the harmonious coordination of the altar officials, may they together bestow their support. Thus may the fast and offering rites be brought to perfect fulfillment, widely extending grace to all beings. Further, may transgressions and faults be eradicated, escaping the reprimands of the Three Officials. With hands clasped, we await the celestial tones, jointly unfolding the rites of the fast.

Should the written fast petition not follow the usual form, proceed as follows:

**Fourfold Concluding Aspirations**
May the Great Dao flourish and spread, the scriptures and precepts flow forth—with utmost sincerity, we bow our heads to the True Three Treasures.
May the reigning emperor enjoy boundless longevity, his wisdom equaling the twin luminaries—with utmost sincerity, we bow our heads to the True Three Treasures.
May our revered teachers and parents—those departed ascend to heaven, those living abide in bliss—with utmost sincerity, we bow our heads to the True Three Treasures.
May all sentient beings escape the manifold sufferings, together realizing the Unconditioned—with utmost sincerity, we bow our heads to the True Three Treasures.

Next, invoke the **Transformational Avatar of the Heavenly Worthy**.
With solemn deportment, proceed to the altar and take position before the curtain. The High Priest approaches the altar monitor deity, declaring the intent of the fast, and entreats the gods to oversee and guard the altar precincts. The fast sponsor offers incense and bows; the High Priest does not bow.

**Declaration Before the Altar Monitor Deity**
[Name and rank] burns incense and respectfully addresses the monitoring deity [Name].
We have heard that the true regulations are resplendently manifest, the fast rites held in solemn reverence. The Three Realms revere them, the myriad spirits comply. Now that the numinous altar is arrayed and the feathered canopies are about to descend, it is fitting to rouse discipline and order, to expel all demonic and aberrant influences. We have already dispatched a memorial, humbly requesting your divine chariot’s attendance. Having deigned to assent and condescend to remain, we pray you tarry awhile. Let no malevolent beings or alien entities enter the altar. Let all defiled qi and polluted vapors be banished without trace. Guide the thousand perfected to descend in their chariots, that the six directions may be suffused with grace. When the fast rites conclude, memorialize their merits and bestow rewards. We beseech you to remain and attend, that we may fulfill this auspicious karmic bond. Respectfully declared.

Proceed to the **Mystic Master’s Curtain**, where the High Priest and fast sponsor offer incense and stand in order.

**Invitation to the Mystic Master**
In conducting the fast and practicing the Dao, we invite the Mystic Master to descend and grace the altar precincts.

**Incense Burner Announcement**
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the crane-drawn carriage has arrived. As the fast rites reach completion, we now prepare to reverently send forth.

**Tea Offering**
The fast sponsor turns, kneels, and proffers the document case toward the High Priest, who receives it and places it upon the memorial tablet. Kneeling, he declares the intent of the fast.

**Memorializing the Fast and Presenting the Blue Petition**
[Name, native place, and surname] respectfully states:
Previously, on the [day] of this month, [Name] submitted a petition beseeching the establishment of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Grand Fast to deliver the deceased [Name]. This was duly memorialized to the Supreme Mystery and reported to the Three Realms. Now that the fast period has arrived and the altar is arrayed, the blue petition must be transcribed anew. It is respectfully submitted to the Great Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure, [Honorific and Name], humbly entreating that the fast be announced, the altar ascended, and the rites conducted according to form. Respectfully submitted.
[Year] [Month] [Day] [Name] Petition.

The High Priest receives the petition, kneels, and declares:
[Rank and name], with reverence bows twice and respectfully addresses the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm:
We humbly beseech your compassion to deign to review this petition. We have heard that the Celestial Thearch, moved by pity for the submerged and lost, broadly promulgated the canon of deliverance. The sagely masters transmitted the ritual forms, establishing the gateway of fast offerings. The myriad methods expand, the Three Vehicles spread forth—goodness elicits response, resonance brings communion. Though unworthy and insignificant, we dare to lay bare our sincerity. Previously, relying upon [Name]’s submitted petition, we memorialized the Golden Portals of the Three Heavens on the [day], reporting to the true bureaus of the respective domains. Now that the fast period has arrived, we again rely upon the fast sponsor [Name]’s petition, beseeching that the fast be announced, the altar ascended, and the rites unfolded. We reflect that we are of inferior talent in this degenerate age, our impure form born of the womb, long indebted to our teachers’ instruction, having presumptuously received the celestial decrees and been misplaced among the ranks of the Mystic Registers. We have taken on the duties of the Dharma office, though our understanding of the Dao grows ever more distant, how could we presume to bridge the gulf between the seen and unseen? Our faults are many, and we remain entangled in the snares of the mundane. Our self-cultivation is flawed, our interactions with others fraught with difficulty. Yet the teachings must be propagated, the Dharma must bring salvation. Though we are base and coarse, we look up to the Great Dao’s boundless compassion. If this fast may proceed, it is entirely owing to the sagely masters’ original protection. We humbly pray that our sincerity be memorialized to the Nine Ultimates, that pardon flow to the Three Paths. Permit us to conduct the rites, that from beginning to end there be no obstruction. Forgive our deviations from the forms, that our memorials may ascend and be heard. May the fast rites reach perfect fulfillment, the masters’ grace be without limit. The memorials and petitions for the altar’s opening are respectfully submitted for your perusal. Prostrate, we beseech your mystic compassion to deign to cast your luminous gaze upon them.

**Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition**
The foregoing memorials and petitions are respectfully submitted for your attention. We humbly beseech your mystic compassion to deign to review them. May the radiance of the Dharma seat abide at the fast altar, accomplishing meritorious works and broadly extending the true shade. Should our humble prayers be answered, we shall be forever indebted to your grace. We, together with the fast sponsor, can scarcely contain our fervent entreaty.

Proceed to the **Three Officials’ Curtain**, where the High Priest and fast sponsor offer incense and bow.

**Invitation to the Three Officials**
In conducting the fast and practicing the Dao, we invite the Water Official to descend and grace the altar precincts.
In conducting the fast and practicing the Dao, we invite the Earth Official to descend and grace the altar precincts.
In conducting the fast and practicing the Dao, we invite the Heaven Official to descend and grace the altar precincts.

**Incense Burner Announcement**
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the heavenly carriage has arrived. As the fast rites reach completion, we now prepare to reverently send forth.

**Tea Offering**
The High Priest kneels and declares the fast:
[Rank and name], bows twice and respectfully addresses the Heavenly, Earthly, and Watery Three Official Lords:
We have heard that in the primordial chaos of the Five Ultimates, the configurations of qi and the luminaries of the Three Radiants were divided. One hundred twenty bureaus govern, twenty-seven palaces preside—merits and transgressions are both recorded, fasts and offerings depend upon their oversight. We dare to trouble your compassion and lay bare our earnest sincerity. Previously relying upon [Name], we reflect that we possess not a shred of goodness, our understanding lacks even an inch of depth. Presumptuously assuming the fast alliance and usurping the altar office, without your numinous protection, how could we achieve this extraordinary merit? The memorials for the altar’s opening have been respectfully presented.

**Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition**
The foregoing memorials and petitions have been respectfully submitted. We humbly beseech your true compassion to deign to bestow your luminous scrutiny.

Pause briefly, O Immortal Chariot, to briefly alight upon this fast altar. Pity and shelter this ignorant one, that the fast’s uprightness may be perfected. May the hidden and obscure together find deliverance, and all transgressions and offenses be wholly dissolved. Should this prayer be fulfilled, it shall truly be by your true protection.

We, the fast officers, can scarcely contain our fervent entreaty.

Proceeding to the Three Masters’ curtain, the High Priest and fast officers offer incense and bow.

Inviting the Three Masters:
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Master of Salvation to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Master of Registers to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Master of Scriptures to descend and attend this altar.

The chime sounds:
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the crane-drawn carriage has arrived. The fast’s affairs are complete and perfect; it is now time to reverently send them forth.

The High Priest kneels to present tea and announces the fast:
Your humble servant, [Name], respectfully bows twice and addresses the True Lords, the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Registers.

I have heard that the jade tablets and golden writings truly inaugurated the great teaching of the exalted perfected. The resonant cases and bejeweled scrolls were first established by the sagely masters as the foundation of the numinous. They guide the ten directions and refine the ages, daring to hope for vast creation while respectfully revealing the sincerity of the heart.

Previously relying upon the petitioner’s intent, I reflect that I have long enjoyed your instruction yet remain untutored in advancement. Presumptuously assuming a place among the ranks of the mysterious and usurping office in the subtle teaching, without the sheltering protection of the master’s honor, how could the fast’s perfection be expected? The memorials for the altar’s opening have been respectfully presented.

Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition:
The foregoing memorials and petitions have been respectfully submitted. We humbly beseech your masterly compassion to deign to bestow your scrutiny.

Condescend to attend this altar ground, briefly halting your bannered procession. Shelter this late learner to escape guilt and extend good fortune through virtuous affinity. May the fast’s uprightness be completed, all by your gracious favor.

We, the fast officers, can scarcely contain our gratitude and fervent entreaty.

Proceeding to the Five Emperors’ curtain, the High Priest and fast officers offer incense and bow.

Inviting the Five Emperors:
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Green Emperor to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Red Emperor to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the White Emperor to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Black Emperor to descend and attend this altar.
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Yellow Emperor to descend and attend this altar.

The chime sounds:
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the simurgh-drawn carriage has arrived. The fast’s affairs are complete and perfect; it is now time to reverently send them forth.

The High Priest kneels to present tea and announces the fast:
Your humble servant, [Name], respectfully bows twice and addresses the Five Emperors of the Five Directions.

I have heard that when the Great Ultimate congealed the true, the Five Directions were arrayed to receive its governance. When the primordial qi of the Brahma-realm divided, the four seasons were recorded to regulate time. The merits and transgressions of the Three Realms are all inscribed, and the gods and humans of the ten directions are together recorded. Daring to rely upon this fast and prayer, I presumptuously intrude upon your divine majesty.

Previously relying upon the petitioner’s intent, I reflect that I am of mediocre talent and dull nature, having presumptuously received nurture through transformation. Presumptuously assuming office at the altar, I fear to overstep in cultivation. Without the refining influence of your power, how could the fast’s affairs be accomplished? We humbly beseech you to briefly divert your immortal procession and condescend to descend to the human realm, abundantly bestowing compassionate grace and broadly extending vast forgiveness. Survey this altar ground and erase our errors and faults. Perfect the fast’s merit and deliver those suffering in the depths of darkness.

The memorials for the altar’s opening have been respectfully presented.

Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition:
The foregoing memorials and petitions have been presumptuously submitted. We humbly beseech your sagely compassion to deign to bestow your merciful aid.

Briefly divert your simurgh-drawn carriage to gracefully alight upon this numinous precinct. Pity and forgive our transgressions, abundantly extending blessings and felicity. Should the hidden and manifest together find benefit, it shall truly be by the profound grace of creation.

We, the fast officers, can scarcely contain our fervent entreaty.

Proceeding to the Heavenly Master’s curtain, the High Priest and fast officers offer incense and bow.

Inviting the Heavenly Master:
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Heavenly Master to descend and attend this altar.

The chime sounds:
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the crane-drawn carriage has arrived. The fast’s affairs are complete and perfect; it is now time to reverently send them forth.

The High Priest kneels to present tea and announces the fast:
Your humble servant, [Name], respectfully bows twice and addresses the Perfected Lord of the Three Heavens, the Great Dharma Master of the Orthodox Unity Teaching, the Quiescent and Responsive True Lord.

I have heard that the golden writings expound the wondrous, and the teaching of the Cavern Spirit is broadly disseminated. The jade register radiates light, and the wind of the Orthodox Unity is greatly propagated. Establishing the models of past and present, they open the ford between the hidden and manifest. Having formed this fast alliance, it truly relies upon your governance.

Previously relying upon the petitioner’s intent, I reflect that my mastery of the Dharma is not refined, and my learning is not profoundly deep. Presumptuously relying upon the mysterious grace, I have usurped the office of chief. The teachings and regulations are solemn and weighty; I fear to fall short in virtuous affinity. By the master’s compassionate pity, I humbly beseech your gracious consideration of this fast’s sincerity.

The memorials for the altar’s opening have been respectfully presented.

Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition:
The foregoing memorials and petitions have been respectfully submitted. We humbly beseech your masterly compassion to deign to bestow your oversight.

Briefly divert your crane-drawn carriage to briefly halt your cloud-borne steeds. Perfect the fast’s affairs from beginning to end, extending virtuous merit to the hidden and manifest. May demonic obstacles be dissolved, truly by your sheltering protection.

We, the fast officers, can scarcely contain our fervent entreaty.

Proceeding to the Curtain of the Great Dharma Master Who Oversees the Fast, the High Priest and fast officers offer incense and bow.

Inviting the Overseer of the Fast:
To perform the fast and practice the Dao, we reverently invite the Overseer of the Fast to descend and attend this altar.

The chime sounds:
The cloud-borne chariot has descended, the sagely carriage has arrived. The fast’s affairs are complete and perfect; it is now time to reverently send them forth.

The High Priest kneels to present tea and announces the fast:
Your humble servant, [Name], respectfully bows twice and addresses the Great Dharma Master Who Oversees the Fast of the Numinous Treasure.

I have heard that the Numinous Treasure revealed its chart, and the Cavern Mystery governed its course. Greatly propagating the standards of deliverance, it opened the gate of the fast’s uprightness. The teaching has its overseers, and the affairs pertain to the canonical records.

Previously relying upon the petitioner’s intent, I reflect that my endowment is base and my nature dull. Presumptuously dwelling within the true teaching, I have erroneously assumed the chief office at the altar. Desiring the vastness of the fast’s merit, I truly rely upon the master’s sheltering protection.

The memorials for the altar’s opening have been respectfully presented.

Reading the Memorial and Burning the Petition:
The foregoing memorials and petitions have been respectfully submitted. We humbly beseech your masterly compassion to deign to bestow your luminous scrutiny.

Condescend to attend this altar ground and briefly halt your wheel-borne carriage. Perfect the fast’s affairs, extending blessings to the hidden and manifest.

To perfect virtue’s fruit and banish all demonic hindrance,
To magnify the fast’s merit and broadly suffuse its blessings—
Should these prayers be answered, it shall truly flow from the true grace.
We, the fast’s officers, can but prostrate ourselves in utmost urgency.

Next, pause briefly, withdraw into the oratory chamber,
or proceed directly to the ritual precinct to commence the rites.

a fragrant cloud densely woven,
ascending straight to the Nine Heavens.

May the Golden Lads attending the incense,
and the Jade Maidens transmitting words,
convey our petition and supplication,
so that it may be heard before the August Presence.
May all that we have petitioned
be granted as spoken.

On this day, as we commence and establish the ritual precinct,
we reverently honor the Dharma-seat.

For the native of [place name], on behalf of the deceased [name], who was born on [year, month, day, hour] and, to our sorrow, passed away on [year, month, day]. Having now elapsed [duration], I, [name], a disciple of the Numinous Treasure Registers, reverently establish at [location] a grand Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Retreat of [number] days and nights. We burn incense and kindle lamps, pay homage to the Perfected, perform the Dao, proclaim talismanic commands, conduct rites to summon and gather the soul, recite the true scriptures, and offer universal deliverance through feeding.

First, we extend our prayers to the divine effigies of our ancestors, the august numina of the altars of soil and grain, that their luminous spirits ascend to the Ninefold Purity and their souls rise to the Ten Poles. For our present Emperor, may he ride the Qian hexagram, inherit the sagely lineage, embody the Dao in accordance with Heaven, extend his lifespan without bound, and secure the imperial destiny forever. May the realm enjoy radiant peace, the frontiers profound tranquility, all people perpetual joy and abundance, and all things be free from blight and pestilence. May the suffering beings of the Three Wretched Realms have their punishments suspended and their toil stilled. May the ten classes of sunken souls be released from delusion and ascend to deliverance. May the fruits of compassion and the supreme good causes be gathered, dedicated especially to the retreat’s sponsor, to aid and recommend the deceased [name]. May their transgressions be washed away, their karmic entanglements dissolved, their spirit liberated from the Northern Bureau, their soul refined in the Southern Palace, and their return to the household assured, together increasing harmony and prosperity.

As the retreat is now solemnly established and the rites are about to commence, we proceed in due order, first offering this announcement. We humbly pray that the myriad numina deign to witness, and the host of sages bestow their radiance, that the merit may be perfected and the benefits to the hidden and manifest be fulfilled. May the response be granted, and the resonance awaited. With hands clasped, we purify the precinct and proceed with the ritual.

**Distributing the Lamps**
First, a lamp is kindled before the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy. If within the altar, it is lit before the Three Treasures. According to the old method, a yang-burning mirror is used; when the sun is at its zenith, fire is drawn from its rays to light the candle before the Jade Purity. The High Priest then takes the Wisdom-Light Talisman for Distributing Lamps, rolls it into a paper lamp, and holds it in hand. Two ranks of Daoist adepts are invited, each holding a talismanic candle, standing to the left and right of the High Priest’s position. The High Priest kneels in reverence, makes his announcement, then advances before the Celestial Worthy, draws the light into the paper lamp in hand, returns to his position, recites the invocation, and distributes it to the two attendants, who proceed to pass the light in order. This is called "inviting the light."

Recently, some have dispensed with lighting candles within the ritual precinct. Instead, the High Priest first ignites a rolled paper lamp in hand, then makes his announcement, after which he hands the lamp to the attendants, who recite the invocation and proceed to light the lamp before the Celestial Worthy. This method, however, amounts to presenting the lamp to the Celestial Worthy rather than inviting the light from before the Dao. The principle is greatly inconsistent, though its proponents claim some justification; thus, it is mentioned here.

**Rite of Distributing the Lamps**
The High Priest returns to his position, kneels, and makes his announcement:

*Your subordinate, [name], twice bows and reverently announces to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Vast and Spontaneous, the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of the Mysterious Cavern of the Upper Purity True Realm, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Virtue of the Mysterious Cavern of the Grand Purity Immortal Realm. We humbly beseech your Dao compassion to deign to regard and record our plea.*

We have heard that above the Nine Poles and cloudy firmament, radiance is unceasing between dawn and dusk. Within the Two Modes and the vast cosmos, brightness and obscurity alternate between day and night. When yang brilliance lies hidden, the world remains in gloom; when yin qi congeals at its root, the realm grows ever more dim. Thus, the true statutes of the Western Sun of Inherited Light esteem nothing more than kindling lamps to receive its radiance. The flowing pardon of the Northern Capital truly begins with dispelling darkness.

Daring to implore your compassion, we humbly permit this petition. We reflect that we, your subordinates, are of base endowment and humble station. Though fortunate to be counted among the ranks, we have long failed to accumulate merit or diligence. We ought to withdraw in self-examination, not presume to advance with prayers. Yet the Dao’s priority is to succor beings, and the teachings exist to benefit others. Moreover, the sincerity of the words we have received cannot be suppressed. Following the intent of the petitioner, we have already submitted our plea to the lofty heavens; now, we reverently open the Dharma-seat.

May the orchid-oil lamps continue through the night, first scattering their radiance across this altar. May the numinous light illumine the hidden, and may your grace extend throughout the Three Realms. We pray that you bestow the qi of life to deliver those sunk in delusion.

We humbly beseech your Dao compassion to deign to grant this mysterious response. We, your subordinates, have presumptuously offended the majesty of the Dao and tremble with fear. In our guilt and awe, we prostrate ourselves, kowtowing repeatedly, and respectfully speak these words.

**Invocation by the Cantor**
The Ten Directions Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies.

The High Priest advances before the Three Treasures. If within the ritual arena, he proceeds before the Jade Purity Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

I have heard that the Dao’s workings are inexhaustible, manifesting responses according to the needs of beings. The celestial radiance knows no bounds, infusing all things with its flowing light. Thus, I dare to reverently knock upon the Gate of Profound Mystery and presume to address the highest heavens. I humbly beseech that you especially extend great forgiveness and graciously bestow profound benevolence. Pity this mortal sincerity and record these earnest supplications.

May the imperial court of Jade Purity bestow the Dao’s qi to dispense grace. May the Clear and Subtle Heaven spread the elixir of life to nurture all beings. Permit me to petition for your command, allowing the sharing of your light. Illuminate the Six Poles to bless the Ten Directions, shine upon the Ten Thousand Heavens, and radiate across the Nine Lands.

I bow and hold fast to this invocation, that the flow of grace may flourish. The Primordial One Qi unfolds and spreads its light. Vast and boundless, it merges with the void, extending peace to the distant and desolate. The suffering souls of nine nights ride the dawn’s first rays. Evil roots transform in response, uniting their essence to attain well-being. The Ten Thousand Perfected assent in harmony, and the qi of life surges like an ocean.

*Sound the chime*
The Most High Three Pure Ones, Heavenly Worthies.

The High Priest visualizes as prescribed. With the talisman, he flicks it before the Jade Purity, inviting the light into his hand. He retreats to his position, holding the paper taper in his left hand. Two acolytes, each holding an unlit taper, stand to the High Priest’s left and right.

The High Priest intones again:
I have heard that the Primal Chaos of the Undifferentiated Origin gives birth to the One, and the One becomes Two as its essence. The congealed and clarified Two Qi initiate the Three as their foundation. The myriad forms of heaven and earth are thus established. The beings of yin and yang are nurtured and brought to life. This spiritual pivot is none other than the ancestral qi. Therefore, I return sincerity to the source and petition for the sharing of qi and light.

I humbly pray that from the One, the Three dawns’ brilliance may unite. From the Three, the life-giving elixir may flow to the Nine Poles. May we embody the divine work of the Great Dao in generating beings and realize the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Beginning in opening the heavens. Above in the heavens and below on earth, may all dwell forever in the Land of Unending Day. In the human world and the dark realms, may all become pure yang realms. May the living and the dead receive blessings, and the hidden and manifest be enveloped in grace.

The High Priest takes the lamp and lights the two candles to his left and right. The three, holding their candles, stand together and recite the incantation:

The Crimson Clarity unfolds the chart, the workings of natural deliverance.
The Three Luminaries shine from a hundred kalpas past.
Today’s great vow: suffering souls receive refinement.
The heavy gloom of the dark realms forever sealed in the cold springs.
We pray for the light of wisdom to illuminate the gates of darkness.
May the ice pools warm, the furnace’s flames subside.
May the mountains of knives and forests of swords sever all attachments.
Turn the light to the Ten Directions, illuminating all heavens.
Harmonize and dissolve the Five Burdens; karma’s entanglements be cut.
The Three Dawns shine as one, forever in the primal origin.
Light-Opening Lads, bear the grace of the Upper Immortals.
Three Luminaries Jade Maidens, fulfill these words as spoken.

The High Priest recites the secret incantation:
The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, the Three give birth to the Ten Thousand Things, universally illuminating the hidden and submerged.

I petition for the sharing of qi and light, humbly receiving the Dao’s shelter. May auspiciousness flow and blessings descend, gloriously adorning the heavens. With the assembly’s shared sincerity, all lamps and candles are lit.

The two attendants each take a candle and distribute them among the Dao assembly, lighting all lamps around the altar. Then, gathering all the lamps, they place them before the Jade Purity and burn them.

I reverently follow the profound ritual, supplicating for mysterious aid. I pray for the sharing of light to illuminate the darkness. I humbly beseech the exalted Great Dao, the Most High Sage of the Mysterious Heavens, to universally extend numinous shelter and abundantly bestow compassionate grace. Shine upon the Ten Directions, manifesting brilliance across the Three Realms. May people be freed from afflictions, souls delivered from darkness, the Ten Classes ascend, and all beings enjoy peace and prosperity.

For the supreme karmic conditions, we invoke the Ten Directions Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, whose inconceivable merits and virtues—

In the *Lamp-Sharing Rite*, after requesting light before the Supreme Emperor, one proceeds again before the Heavenly Master to announce and pray, reciting:

The Heavenly Master’s chariot soars lightly,
Five ranks arrayed at the Gate of Mystery.
Nine Lights blaze in radiance,
Illuminating the Three Realms with universal brightness.
Golden talismans inscribe jade tablets,
Resounding echoes emerge from the void.
The Great Tenuity waves the Yellow Banner,
The Peerless commands the Numinous Pennant.
Summoning the long-night abodes,
Opening deliverance to receive the living souls.

This is the format used in the *Jade Hall Fast Ritual* of the *Lu Realized Officials*, a practice of the *Cavern Spirit Orthodox Unity* tradition. It centers on the Heavenly Master, differing from the ancient *Numinous Treasure* ritual codes. Later *Cavern Mystery* Dharma Masters, adhering to ancient methods, have also incorporated this incantation, mixing it into their rites. Alternatively, proceeding again before the Master to share light is improper. Moreover, each ritual tradition has its own foundational principles; they must not be conflated or lightly employed.

In the ancient *Numinous Treasure* rites, only the incantation *“The Crimson Clarity unfolds the chart, the workings of natural deliverance”* was used. The addition of the incantation *“The Primordial One Qi unfolds and spreads its light”* is a supplicatory prayer, already overly detailed. To return again before the Supreme Emperor and then revisit the Master’s presence is truly unwarranted.

In the *Established Rites of the Jiang Lineage*, an additional incantation was appended to the *Lamp-Sharing Rite*:

Nine Yang Jade Purity,
Three Lights Dao Brilliance.

This is not used in the ancient *Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure* rites. Today, we adhere to our lineage’s traditions and dare not indiscriminately adopt or augment.

The *Requesting Light* rite involves using a yang-sundial to reflect sunlight, igniting a candle before the Jade Purity. The High Priest then recites the invocation, bows twice, advances, requests the light into his hand, returns to his position, and shares it with the two attendants, who then distribute it in sequence. This is the proper way to request light from the Great Dao.

However, in several prefectures of eastern Zhejiang, a lamp is first lit in the High Priest’s hand while he kneels and recites the invocation. The Dao assembly then receives it, proceeding before the Three Pure Ones Heavenly Worthies, reciting the announcement text at each position before sharing the light. This method has the High Priest presenting the lamp’s light before the Supreme Emperor, rather than requesting the light of wisdom to illuminate the Three Realms. The logic is greatly flawed; thus, we adhere strictly to the ancient format.

*Gold Bell Jade Chime Rite*

Your Majesty, we have heard that the true scriptures conceal wondrous mysteries, harboring the myriad transformations yet remaining formless. The Void and Cavern generate the divine, originating from the One Spirit to assume form. Thus, the Five Sections unfold, and the Three Caverns grandly open. The Dao’s teachings have become manifest, and the rituals of its teachings are now fully established. With canonical principles arrayed in full, the institutions are accordingly set forth. Drawing from the patterns of yin and yang, gold governs firmness while jade embodies moisture. Aligning with Heaven and Earth, the bell resonates above while the chime penetrates the depths. Moreover, as the fast and covenant have reached the Jade Palace, and the host of sages is about to descend upon the sacred seat, we array the ranks with solemnity, gazing afar at the immortal chariot’s ethereal approach. We straighten our demeanor and observe the rites with reverence, lifting our eyes to behold the pure countenance amidst the distant mists. Therefore, we present the instruments to perform the rites, employing sound to move the spirits. Tigers leap and dragons soar, auspicious qi filling the Dharma realm. Phoenixes wheel and simurghs ascend, divine winds stirring the sacred jades. Communication between the manifest and the subtle is instantaneous, and in but a moment, resonance is achieved. We, your servants, bind ourselves in humility to seek the mandate, prostrating in sincerity. We offer our meager devotion to the numinous might, trembling with awe.

**Strike the golden bell twenty-five times.**
We humbly observe that its noble form and vast sound are cast from refined metal to establish its essence. Its suspended corners and elevated seal-like engravings resound with the clamor of signal fires to produce its tone. It aligns with the yang virtue to shine above, solemnly upholding the Mysterious Net in its entirety. Its resonance ascends to the utmost heights, following the Brahman sound to pierce the void. Within the true lies the truest, permeating the numinous radiance to bestow blessings. The *Incantation for Summoning Yang Spirits* is reverently recited. The primordial model expands boundlessly, the nine rosy clouds illuminating the sky. The cinnabar spirits manifest brilliantly, the five planets aligning in harmony. True yang stirs intensely, its melody harmonizing with the Mysterious Palace. The Primordial Beginning lingers, and the host of immortals respectfully follows. The myriad qi unite in transcendence, descending their subtle decrees in concealment. The Dao arises naturally, its transformations without end.

**Strike the jade chime thirty times.**
We humbly observe that its floating material and moistened essence produce a sound that is clear and drawn out. Its ancient, elongated form and square edges serve as symbols. Modeling the Kun trigram’s stabilizing power, it resonates with yin to summon the numinous. Its pure tones, like jade chimes, subtly reach beyond the four directions. Its refined sincerity shines through, silently connecting the six poles’ hidden depths. Harmonizing the five qi in profound accord, it gathers the five spirits in true witness. The *Incantation for Summoning Yin Spirits* is reverently recited. In the lofty Great Void, the jasper palaces and purple chambers stand. The Mysterious Altar’s instruments, the jade chimes, resound like jade. The rosy clouds soar, Heaven and Earth unite in expansion. Yin arises in Brahman chant, flowing forth the primordial net. Auspicious clouds emerge at the gates, raising the sunken and delivering the departed. May they achieve exalted transcendence and eternally dwell in the land of blessings.

**Strike the bell and chime together thirty-six times.**
We humbly observe that yin summons and yang congeals, their wondrous workings hidden beyond measure. The golden bell and jade chime’s pure tones penetrate the infinite. Though the Kan trigram is solid and Li is empty, water ascends and fire descends. The way of resonance arises naturally, and the function of harmony is duly enacted. Thus, hardness and softness shape the instruments, tuning their sounds to welcome felicity. The ringing of bells and chimes reaches above and below. The *Incantation for Reaching the Spirits* is reverently recited. The two qi intermingle, manifesting yin and revealing yang. Gold harmonizes to stir auspiciousness; jade moistens to bring tranquility and prosperity. They interact above and below, resonating throughout the ten directions. Their distant vibrations shake the Mysterious Palace, the jade pendants ringing in harmony. The numinous talismans proclaim their commands, solemnly ordering the altar grounds. The secret model is solemnly recited, and the myriad spirits unfold.

**Strike the golden bell nine times and the jade chime six times.**
We humbly observe that the Qian trigram’s canopy floats above, while the Kun trigram’s chariot is firmly established below. The myriad phenomena of the forest of existences remain formless and unfathomable in their solemnity. The ten directions encircle all, their vastness impossible to encompass. Yet, in purifying the fast to serve the Emperor, how could high and low be scattered and disparate? Only through utmost sincerity in moving the spirits should Heaven and humanity interact. Now, as the altar grounds are to be solemnized, bells and chimes sound in unison, their melodies composing the music of the celestial spheres, as if the spirits wander in the Emperor’s presence. The lofty tones of Brahman chant faintly resemble the scenes of the Mysterious Capital. We redouble our sincerity and join in praise. Next, the ritual proceedings commence, circling the altar before exiting. The High Priest enters the oratory to consecrate the water, while the Dao assembly continues the rites at the altar. A Daoist of dignified bearing is pre-selected to perform the *Rite of Prohibiting the Altar*.

**Rite of Prohibiting the Altar**
Visualize the Three Masters in the west. Envision the crimson-robed perfected officials descending upon the water vessel in the Dipper’s chariot, their swords placed at the Earth Gate. Offer incense and declare:
Your subordinate, [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates twice, humbly addressing the sacred assembly.
We have heard that at the inception of the primordial qi, yin and yang were set in motion to establish the ultimate. At the beginning of the Two Modes, purity and turbidity initiated the unfolding of Heaven. Having nurtured the multitude of beings, the manifold transformations were thus revealed. Therefore, the Five Sections were disseminated, serving as the foundation of scriptures and canons. The Three Caverns were proclaimed, grandly inaugurating the lineage of teachings. They safeguard the kalpas, stabilize Heaven and Earth, bring fortune to the nation and peace to the times, dispel poisons and calamities below, deliver the hidden and aid the manifest, universally guiding Heaven and humanity.
We, your subordinates, are but illusory forms bound in delusion, dull and ignorant in our endowment. Fortunate to receive the transformation of the true and correct, we have gained access to the steps of the Dao and its methods. Unable to restrain ourselves in seclusion, we presumptuously aspire to labor in service. We present our words and list our requests, conveying the worldly entreaties. We establish offerings and perform fasts, expounding the canonical models of the August Void. Deeply aware of overstepping our station, we can only hope for your gracious favor. Daring to express our pressing concerns, we disturb the lofty ears of the celestial heights.
We, your subordinates, respectfully follow the petitioner’s intent, with all sincerity detailed in the memorial. Reverently adhering to the luminous statutes, we solemnly open the ritual seat. In the ninefold purity of the Dao’s realms, we pray for a single thought’s resonance. Among the true administrations of the Three Realms, we wish for the multitude of spirits to witness and reflect. For this humble and mundane domain is nothing but a realm of dust and俗. We fear that defiling impurities may rashly intrude, or that malevolent and deviant forces may not yet be expelled. Only by borrowing the pervasive radiance of Heaven may we hope to dispel the influences of pernicious sorcery.
We humbly beseech the exalted Emperor to deign to consider our petition. May the Heavenly Perfected and Great Sages graciously review our words. May they specially command the relevant offices to dispatch the divine generals, infusing the ritual water with numinous light and embedding majestic brilliance within the sacred blade.

The five qi intermingle in misty profusion, as water, charged by incantation, washes away the turbid vapors of pine. The Seven Stars blaze resplendent, and the sword, following the celestial pivot, annihilates demonic essences. The ten directions stand purified, myriad spirits attend in guard—commands issued reach even the farthest bounds, and words uttered resonate with all responsive beings. Your servant reverently simplifies the writ to preserve the numinous, awaiting the celestial grace of response.

Your servant, [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground in repeated prostration, respectfully declares.

Again simplifying the writ, he closes his eyes, raises the Mudra of the Supreme Emperor with his left hand, and the Sword Mudra with his right, then clasps them firmly at his side. Visualizing three steps and nine traces, he summons the Four Numinous Beings.

The Azure Emperor divides his spirit, gathering true essence in the Thunder position. His form extends a thousand fathoms, azure scales manifesting auspicious signs. His nature originates as the Green Dragon, descending to expel evil and sweep away filth, coming to stand at my left.

The Vermilion Emperor divides his spirit, gathering qi in the Fire Palace. Radiant crimson hues gleam with dazzling red wings. His form appears as the Vermilion Phoenix, incinerating malevolence and anomalies, coming to stand before me.

The White Emperor divides his spirit, condensing true essence in the Lake. His dark form of pristine purity roars with celestial resonance. His aspect is the White Tiger, executing deviance and severing monstrosities, coming to stand at my right.

The Black Emperor divides his spirit, nurturing essence in the Water Palace. Crimson serpents and dark tortoises unite in yin-yang harmony. This is called the Dark Warrior, solemnly guarding the altar’s bounds, coming to stand behind me.

Four Numinous Generals, hasten to arrive upon summons. Receiving the imperial decree, you race like lightning and wind.

Next, approaching the altar table, he takes up the water and sword, holding them in hand. For the sword proclaims might and issues commands, while water can scour impurity to restore clarity. Moreover, through recited incantations and the summoning of spirits, the invocation of qi, demonic traces vanish and defiling impurities dissolve without a trace. Reverently following the esoteric canon, he openly declares the celestial decree.

Holding the sword horizontally above the water vessel, he draws qi.

Reverently invoking the Demon King of the Azure Heavens in the East, descend your true qi into my water.
Reverently invoking the Demon King of the Vermilion Heavens in the South, descend your true qi into my water.
Reverently invoking the Demon King of the White Heavens in the West, descend your true qi into my water.
Reverently invoking the Demon King of the Black Heavens in the North, descend your true qi into my water.
Reverently invoking the Demon King of the Yellow Heavens in the Center, descend your true qi into my water.

Great Demon Emperors of the Five Directions, progenitors of the myriad spirits. Wielding banners and drums, you traverse the vast heavens, proclaiming your majestic glory, as all heavens unite in merit. Each descend your true qi into my water.

Your servant [Name], proclaiming the imperial decree of the Supreme Emperor:
My sword suffices to aid water and fire, its form modeled on Heaven and Earth. Its unyielding strength sharpens the blade tempered a hundred times, its snowy edge embodying the Seven Stars. Pointed to the sky, it causes malevolent stars to fall and darken; summoning thunder, purple lightning soars. Now wielding it to rebuke demonic vapors, all ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms are seized and subdued. With a single flourish, ten thousand miles are wholly purified, and earthly realms’ demonic essences are utterly extinguished.

Spraying water once:
My water flows only as directed, congealing or dispersing in due time. Earth’s six qi achieve the power of moisture descending, while Heaven’s one generates the nature of supreme softness. As mist and dew, it engenders without limit; as frost and snow, it enforces stern order with constancy. Now using it to cleanse the altar grounds, I universally summon the upright qi of the Five Heavens. With a single spray, the Six Directions are all without dust, and the earth’s expanse levels into gleaming jade.

Spraying water once.

Next, reciting the Tianpeng Incantation, he sprays water once more.

Then, reciting the incantation, he proceeds to the East to establish the boundary.
Reverently invoking the Limitless Numinous Treasure officials, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, envoys, functionaries, and soldiers of the East, descend through the void to arrive at the altar grounds. Deploy spirits and distribute qi, search out demonic essences, drive away ghostly bandits—those guilty shall not be spared.
I establish the boundary from the Earth Gate to the East.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Reverently invoking the Limitless Numinous Treasure officials, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, envoys, functionaries, and soldiers of the South, descend through the void to arrive at the altar grounds. Deploy spirits and distribute qi, search out demonic essences, incinerate ghostly bandits—those guilty shall not be spared.
I establish the boundary from the East to the South.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Reverently invoking the Limitless Numinous Treasure officials, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, envoys, functionaries, and soldiers of the West, descend through the void to arrive at the altar grounds. Deploy spirits and distribute qi, search out demonic essences, execute and behead ghostly bandits—those guilty shall not be spared.
I establish the boundary from the South to the West.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Reverently invoking the Limitless Numinous Treasure officials, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, envoys, functionaries, and soldiers of the North, descend through the void to arrive at the altar grounds. Deploy spirits and distribute qi, search out demonic essences, scatter and disperse ghostly bandits—those guilty shall not be spared.
I establish the boundary from the West to the North.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Reverently invoking the Limitless Numinous Treasure officials, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, envoys, functionaries, and soldiers of the Center, descend through the void to arrive at the altar grounds. Deploy spirits and distribute qi, search out demonic essences, bury and conceal ghostly bandits—those guilty shall not be spared.
I establish the boundary from the North to the Center.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Next, holding the sword horizontally over the water, he summons the troops and horses.
Reverently invoking the soldiers and cavalry of the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Humans, Sun, Moon, and Constellations, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, and the City Gods and Earth Spirits. Array your ranks within and beyond the altar grounds to guard and defend its boundaries. Should there be lingering corpses, old qi, or essences of earth, wood, or stone that do not comply with the Dao, consign them beneath the Dipper’s pivot, buried a thousand fathoms deep, never to move or act again.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Proceeding to the Ghost Gate, he traces a character for "ghost" on the ground with his sword, then thrusts the blade into the ghost’s heart. Reciting the incantation, he sprays the ground and withdraws the sword.

The Nine Heavens issue their mandate, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits. Hastening to summon the Heavenly Perfected, all assemble in the imperial court. The Great Unity gazes downward, the Twin Sovereigns attend in form, scrutinizing and suppressing deviance, governing qi and seizing life.

Should any inauspicious forces dare test the divine luminaries,
the Dao of the Azure Sovereign commands the marshaling of spirit troops—
seven gods assume their stations, the Celestial Blade advances to the right,
sword brandished at the vanguard, fire-bells flung in radiant arcs.
The armored couriers are spurred to action, tiger-soldiers and Heavenly Ding,
wind and fire join in battle, striking down deviance and strangling pernicious essences.
Above, they overawe the Six Heavens; below, they seize demonic spirits.
Once awed, once seized, the myriad malevolences are obliterated in form.
The divine halberd sweeps like lightning—no treachery or deviance shall arise.
The Immortal August One holds the tally; those who dare delay the mandate
shall be executed and punished for defying the tally and violating the command.
Let each be reverent, each be vigilant, to preserve this Yellow Tranquility.
The edict of the Nine Heavens is proclaimed—let the ten thousand spirits heed with reverence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and ordinances!

Next, return to one’s station, restore the water and sword, take up the tablet once more,
and withdraw with a bow. Then ascend the altar to perform the overnight rites,
each according to its proper protocol.
Exiting the oratory, proceed to the master’s tent, observing all sequential rites—
all are found in the *Thirty-Five Ranks of the Yellow Register’s Sequence*.
The protocols for overnight rites and the establishment of fasts are contained
in the *Protocols of Master Guangcheng* and will not be repeated here.
All methods for visualization upon ascending the altar, exiting and entering the chamber,
and the High Priest’s burning of talismans and recitation of secret incantations
are detailed in the *Forty-Second Rank: Altar Talismanic Methods*.
The external protocols for conducting fasts are fully set forth herein.

Here ends *Scroll Twenty of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites*
Here begins *Scroll Twenty-One of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites*

**Scroll Twenty-One of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites**
*The Altar Talismanic Methods, Compiled by Jin Yunzhong of the Right Auxiliary Office of the Primary Bureau of the Southern Court of the Numinous Treasure Daoist Masters*

Whenever establishing an altar for a fast, within ten or seven days prior to the formal petition, first inscribe in cinnabar on green silk the *Talisman for Descending Perfected Ones* and the *Talisman for Summoning Spirits*. Arrange their positions, prepare incense, fire, lamps, candles, pure tea, seasonal fruits, and offerings. The master burns incense morning and evening, recites the central scripture, and devoutly invokes the talismanic messengers. Alternatively, one may carve the talisman’s form onto a lacquered plaque for veneration, or ascend the altar to pay homage, summoning and refining spirits, and invoking divine generals. Both talismans must be inscribed and burned first before proceeding; all employ the seal of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites Bureau.

*Talisman for Descending Perfected Ones*
*Talisman for Summoning Spirits*
Inscribe these two talismans in cinnabar on green silk, and offer incense and flowers to their messengers. After seven days, a thousand perfected ones may descend, and ten thousand spirits may be summoned by writ. When establishing the great Yellow Register altar or conducting refinement rites for the deceased, inscribe them on yellow silk, burn to ash, and scatter to the ten directions—then a thousand perfected ones and ten thousand spirits will gather at the altar, and numinous resonance will be achieved. Those whose faith is not steadfast will be tested by the Five Marchmounts. Without these talismanic texts in a great fast, true spirits will not descend, and all efforts will be in vain. In refinement and summoning rites, without them the Three Officials will detain the soul, and no manifest response will occur. In all altar rites of profound vision, these two talismans are primary. They are the divine script of the Nine Heavens’ Great Radiance, concealed in the Mysterious Palace and not transmitted to the lower world. Whoever leaks this Way will have their soul sink into the Northern Bureau, forever bereft of immortal hope.

*The Three Dawns’ Wisdom-Light Talisman*
Use yellow paper, nine inches long and three inches wide. Inscribe three cinnabar talismans, fumigate them over incense, and employ the *Jade Emperor’s Oral Formula* to visualize the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, descending a stream of wisdom-light to permeate the talisman. When invoking the light, twist the paper into a torch. The High Priest and two Daoist adepts each hold one. The High Priest invokes the light into his hand, returns to his position, then distributes them to the left and right adepts, who scatter and infuse them in sequence.

*Morning Entry Incantation*
Four Luminaries’ Merit Officers, Messengers of Communicating with Perfected Ones,
Transmitting Jade Lads, Attendant Pure Maidens of the Oratory—
for this servant’s communication, may the oratory’s true spirits
and the Upper Prime’s generative qi enter this servant’s body,
so that all my petitions may be heard above.

*Exit Incantation*
Exiting yin to enter the viscera, the myriad spirits open the passageways.
When affairs are concluded, I request the Yellow Chamber be sealed.
Attendant Pure Maidens of the Oratory, clearly guard the divine palace.

*Night Entry Incantation*
Four Upper Merit Officers, Dragon-Tiger Messengers,
Orthodox Unity’s generative qi, Attendant Pure Maidens of the Oratory—
for this night’s petition, may the Illuminating Lad and the Upper Prime Maiden
accompany me into the Yellow Chamber,
so that all my communications may be heard above.

*Exit Incantation*
The Mysterious Upper Supreme Yin opens the eight windows.
Whatever I have declared, may the Maiden communicate the numinous.
When affairs are concluded, return to your positions; the myriad spirits silently repose.

For left and right foot placement, see the *Morning Audience and Entering the Oratory* section. When entering, always lead with the right foot; when exiting, lead with the left. Before entering, visualize the Incense Official’s Messengers and the Dragon-Tiger Lords flanking the incense table. At dawn, also visualize the Four Luminaries’ Merit Officers, Messengers of Communicating with Perfected Ones (one each), Attendant Jade Lads of the Oratory, and Transmitting Jade Maidens (two each)—six in total, arrayed left and right. At night, visualize the Four Upper Merit Officers, Attendant Pure Maidens of the Oratory, Illuminating Lad, Upper Mysterious Maiden (one each), and Dragon-Tiger Messengers (two)—six in total, arrayed left and right. "Entering the chamber" refers to entering the Earth Chamber. When ascending the altar, visualize and recite secret incantations to the left of the Earth Chamber. When exiting, visualize the officials, generals, and jade maidens transmitting the fast’s sincerity, then dispersing. In all Three Caverns’ scriptural protocols, the jade maidens’ entry and exit employ these incantations. Recently, some shallowly learned individuals, seeing these incantations in the *Orthodox Unity’s Essential Pointers* applied to morning audiences, have claimed them as part of the Cavern Mystery’s ritual registers. Such arbitrary alterations, driven by a fondness for novelty, are unreliable.

*Ascending the Altar*
When ascending the altar, first offer incense to the Six Canopies. Next, one attendant carries the hand censer, and one rings the chime, leading the master to ascend the altar. The High Priest and Daoist adepts divide left and right, standing in order before the altar. Before entering the altar’s interior, the High Priest first enters the Earth Chamber, ascends the inner altar, and the adepts follow. Recently, some have merely circled as usual, with the High Priest trailing the adepts, entering the Xun Chamber to the outer altar’s rear before bowing. The High Priest should enter the Earth Chamber first, while the adepts stand aside, allowing the High Priest to pass through—this lacks solemnity. Thus, the *Jiangshi Established Rites* also states: when ascending the altar, the High Priest leads; when exiting, the High Priest follows. This accords with ancient protocols and is most fitting. The High Priest recites secret incantations upon entering the Earth Chamber, and all adepts enter the altar. The Precentor circles to the central altar’s east, facing west; the six officers stand at the central altar’s west, facing east. The High Priest and the fast’s sponsor ascend the Heavenly Gate together, enter the inner altar, and offer incense to the ten directions. During the day, begin with the east; at night, begin with the north. Next, offer incense at the imperial table. The High Priest burns incense, recites secret incantations, and visualizes as prescribed. The officials in attendance offer incense. When finished, exit the Heavenly Gate, circle left to the central altar, and face north. The High Priest returns to his position, offers incense in the hand censer, and recites secret incantations. Then proceed according to protocol until the censer is returned. The chime-ringer intones the *Hymn of Studying Immortality*, leading the way, followed by the adepts. The High Priest exits the inner altar through the Heavenly Gate to the central altar’s foremost position. The adepts exit the Earth Chamber, recite incantations, circle through the Xun Chamber, proceed to the master’s tent, turn toward the oratory, and enter as usual.

All gates outside the altar are to be sealed, leaving only the Xun Chamber open. The central altar is entered and exited through the Earth Gate, while the inner altar is entered and exited solely through the Heavenly Gate. Recently, some have taken to entering both the central and inner altars through the Earth Gate and exiting through the Heavenly Gate—this is entirely incorrect. Both the *Rituals of Master Guangcheng* and the *Dharma of Lu Jianji* state: "Enter through the Earth Gate, ascend through the Heavenly Gate, and offer incense to the Ten Directions." This has been the ancient practice, and one must not follow vulgar custom.

The inner altar emulates Heaven, thus entry and exit are through the Heavenly Gate. The central altar symbolizes Earth, hence entry and exit are through the Earth Gate—this must not be altered.

**Morning Visualization:**
At dawn, visualize *qi* of azure clouds filling the ritual hall. Azure dragons and lions, eight in number each, guard as prescribed in the scriptures, securing the altar as the central axis. Front and rear are defended. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, sun, moon, and stars, the five emperors’ legions, nine hundred million cavalry, overseers of the fast, and officials of the Three Realms array themselves to left and right.

This follows the initial visualization of the Three Supreme Lords upon the altar, seated in the Heavenly Treasure Terrace with the scripture to the left and the master to the right, as if in solemn audience. Then the host of immortals and myriad spirits take their stations, forming the Mystic Terrace’s immortal assembly. Subsequent rituals proceed in order, consistent across the three daily audiences, differing only in *qi*.

Next, visualize azure *qi* rising from the liver like ascending clouds, with azure dragons and lions within it. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, and the five emperors’ legions of the five directions envelop the bodies of all present in the ritual hall. This begins with visualizing the azure *qi* of Heaven descending from above, while one’s own azure *qi* emerges from within, merging and filling all space.

At night, *qi* withdraws; at dawn, sunlight has yet to shine. The power of Wood flourishes, and azure *qi* arises naturally. The heavenly, earthly, and flying immortals are the divine soldiers and cavalry invoked at the altar’s founding. The Five Emperors are the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center—these are the true *qi* of the five directions, governing the seasons and their sequences, commanding legions to protect the ritual altar as their duty.

Thus, the ritual officers—First Mystery, Second Mystery, Third Mystery, and Four Beginnings—are all deities of the seasonal nodes, corresponding to this system. Further visualize the five viscera and five sacred peaks, the true *qi* of the Five Emperors, emerging from the nose to envelop one’s body, filling the altar with radiant light that illumines the Ten Directions. A circular halo appears above the head, bright as the sun and moon, while the body shines golden, revealing all within and without.

These Five Peaks are not external but correspond to the five viscera within the body, as depicted in alchemical diagrams. The earlier reference to the Five Peaks’ legions invokes the spirits of mountains and rivers, who dispatch their forces to guard the altar. Thus, the visualization of Heaven’s azure *qi* naturally extends to the legions—these are external, not internal.

All such practices operate through internal-external resonance. The middle passage again mentions the Five Emperors of the five directions, who are the deities of the four seasons’ *qi* and nodes, as previously described. Here, the Five Emperors refer to the *qi* within the body, for when *qi* is numinous, spirits are born. As in the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the Five Emperors appear in the visualization of the spine—this pertains to the Heavenly Treasure, and thus is not frequently cited in the Numinous Treasure rites.

The five viscera are detailed in the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court*; one may consult it for further study. For altar rituals and fasts, simplified methods suffice: merely visualize azure *qi* from the liver, white *qi* from the lungs, yellow *qi* from the spleen, vermilion *qi* from the heart, and black *qi* from the kidneys, first filling the body, then emerging from the nose like ascending clouds. Within each of the five *qi*, an emperor appears, clad in flowing ceremonial robes matching the direction’s color. The *qi* fills the ritual hall, and as one’s body rises with its lightness, inner and outer shine brilliantly. No longer a vessel of blood and filth, a halo like the sun’s disk forms behind the head, illumining the Ten Directions and gilding the body in radiant light.

**Noon Visualization:**
Visualize *qi* of yellow clouds filling the ritual hall, with qilin and lions guarding front and rear as before, along with heavenly and earthly immortals—all as in the dawn rite. Further visualize yellow *qi* rising from the spleen like ascending clouds. The five viscera, five sacred peaks, and the true *qi* of the Five Emperors emerge from the nose. Ascend the altar at the *si* hour (9–11 AM) and descend after the fourth quarter of the *wu* hour (noon). As the sun nears its zenith, yang *qi* flourishes. The spleen, which governs Earth, dominates the four seasons and arises in the South through the Fire-Earth cycle. This corresponds to the nurturing of primordial *qi* below, but one must not exceed the central *qi* of noon, lest the visualization clash with the hour, resulting in grave error.

**Evening Visualization:**
Visualize *qi* of white clouds filling the ritual hall, with white tigers and lions as before. Further visualize white *qi* rising from the lungs like ascending clouds, with white tigers and lions within it—all as in the dawn rite. Visualize the five viscera, five sacred peaks, and the true *qi* of the Five Emperors emerging from the nose, as in the morning method. Ascend the altar before sunset, while *qi* is not yet fully yin, and white *qi* flourishes, aligning with the primordial *qi* to harmonize the visualization.

The primordial *qi* within the body resides in the lower cinnabar field, while the lungs are the mother of Water. Lung *qi* flourishes at dusk, as Water is about to arise. Thus, white *qi* from the lungs merges with the celestial *qi* above.

I have observed in Master Guangcheng’s *Du Jun’s Compilation of the Yellow Register Fast Rituals* the following: "According to the ancient *Golden Register* rites and the old *Yellow Register* methods, on the eve of the fast’s commencement and at the time of announcing the merits, one first performs the *Natural Audience* before proceeding with the fast."

Thus, the *Initiation Rites of the Fast* states: "Proceed first with the *Natural Audience*, and after the *Three Bows*, announce the fast’s supplementary offices, recite the precepts, and proclaim the prohibitions." This method has been transmitted from Master Lu and Celestial Master Kou through the ages, and over time, all have regarded the *Natural Audience* of the *Numinous Treasure* as the origin and ancestor of fast rituals. Therefore, the *Natural Audience* is performed first to demonstrate that one has not forgotten its roots.

Recently, however, foolish and mediocre scholars, failing to grasp the intentions of the ancient worthies—misled by Zhang Yunguang’s errors—have followed his misguided example. They first appoint the *Six Offices* before the *Mysterious Master*, establish the regulations, and confer the tablets, only then ascending the altar. They claim this follows the fast method of Master Jianji, yet their ignorance has led them to such extremes. Some even imitate and perpetuate this practice, not only inviting the transgression of disordering the Dao but also incurring the sin of slandering the worthy. Those of discernment in the teachings should jointly reject this.

Within the old methods, there is a transmitted error: during the *Natural Audience* at the time of initiating the fast and announcing merits, one should pay homage to the *Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy*, yet the title of the *Jade Treasure August Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Heaven* is not transmitted. This slightly deviates from the original intent of the *Natural Audience*. It may be due to the passage of time and scribal errors. This ritual has now been corrected accordingly.

This is not a matter of presumptuous conjecture, but rather where ritual propriety naturally leads—so states Master Du. In all the ritual codes of Lu Jianji and Zhang Qingdu, even the slightest divergence is meticulously examined against the original sources, with obsolete texts discarded, as Master Du establishes his own school of thought.

Regarding the three colors of blue, yellow, and white:
At dawn, one visualizes blue *qi*; at noon, yellow *qi*; and at dusk, white *qi*. The commentary further explains: these are the primordial origins of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the *Scripture of Spirit Generation* states: "The blue, yellow, and white *qi* constitute the Three Realms and Three Palaces, the foundational origins of all generations." This aligns perfectly with the ritual codes of Lu Jianji, with no discrepancies. It is therefore clear that the three daily audiences involve visualizing the blue, yellow, and white *qi*.

In recent times, Lu’s ritual codes have become fragmented and incomplete. Though I, Yunzhong, have examined several versions that closely resemble one another, those transmitted in eastern Zhejiang uniformly alter the noon visualization to red *qi*—a matter of grave consequence. For the blue realm pertains to Heaven as the Jade Clarity Realm, and to humans as the Upper Cinnabar Field, its *qi* rooted in the liver. The yellow *qi* pertains to Heaven as the Highest Clarity Realm, and to humans as the Middle Cinnabar Field, its *qi* rooted in the spleen. The white *qi* pertains to Heaven as the Great Clarity Realm, and to humans as the Lower Cinnabar Field, its *qi* rooted in the lungs. These principles derive from the orthodox scriptures. Thus, the *qi* within the body harmonizes with the *qi* of Heaven, each in its proper time.

Yet some, having received transmitted ritual codes with minor variations, claim these as Lu Jianji’s definitive teachings—though such interpretations may not align with the underlying principle. Master Du Guangcheng, while noting divergences in Lu’s codes, did not fail to address them. During the Tang dynasty, Lu Jianji’s texts showed no alteration in this regard. However, with the passage of time and repeated transcriptions, errors have proliferated, not limited to this single instance, and even minor discrepancies exist among the original codes. Guangcheng explicitly clarified their origins and lineages. The color of *qi* visualized at noon is a matter of great importance in the fast. Had Lu Jianji’s codes prescribed red *qi* at noon while Guangcheng’s specified yellow, how could he not have detailed their differences?

Guangcheng’s codes, presented to the Supreme Mystery and pledged before Heaven and Earth, have been practiced by later generations with manifest responses. Not even the *Established Rites* of the Jiang lineage, which claims to surpass Guangcheng in textual verification and to surpass the ancients in breadth of study, can match this. Thus, in their altar rites—from the establishment to the dispersal of the altar, and in the Nine Audience codes—they must rely on Master She’s texts. Yet in matters of ritual structure and procedures, they sometimes adopt Master Du’s phrasing and sometimes reject his arguments. Such inconsistencies pervade the *Established Rites*. Claiming superiority over predecessors and surpassing all others, they meticulously reexamine each detail, making their own selections to forge a distinct school. They ought to have entirely rewritten Guangcheng’s ritual texts, discarding his wording to eliminate the flaws of inconsistency and impurity, thereby establishing a lasting model. Yet by rejecting his theories while retaining his language, they risk the blemish of a single oversight in a thousand considerations.

The noon visualization of yellow *qi* is precisely as recorded in Du Guangcheng’s *Altar Establishment* and *Nine Audience* codes. The *Established Rites* incorporates his wording but alters the noon visualization to red *qi*, thereby rejecting one of the three daily visualizations—implying that Du’s teaching is incorrect. If the theory is unsound, how can its language be included?

I, Yunzhong, having been ordained as a preceptor and received transmission of Du Guangcheng’s ritual methods, dare not alter them. Yet among the teachings of my revered masters, it is said: "At the inception of primordial chaos, the Two Modes remained unformed. From the source of the Great Dao, the Three *Qi* were yet unmanifest." Only after the Primordial Unity divided did the Three Spirits emerge, thereby nurturing Heaven and Earth and shaping the myriad things. The Dao is their foundation, the true ancestor of all *qi*. From the One dividing into Three arose the Primordial Three *Qi* of Mystery and Origin. Together, they are called the Great Dao; separately, they are the Three *Qi*. In form, they are named the Three August Ones of the Supreme.

Without this *qi*, Heaven cannot move, Earth cannot stabilize, and humans cannot live. The Three *Qi*, also termed the Three Primes in the scriptures, are the ancestors of the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth, the origin of all existence. Within the Six Directions, all is the *qi* of the Dao. Where the Dao resides, the Three Primes abide. From utmost emptiness arises numinosity; from supreme numinosity, spirit is born. Thus, the fast altar establishes only the Boundless Great Dao, encompassing the Three *Qi* in its totality. The One *Qi* transforms into Three *Qi*, initially unnameable and formless. When gathered into form, they become the Three August Ones of the Supreme.

Teachings are established through scriptures, and scriptures are transmitted by masters. Thus, scriptures and masters are listed together. In practice, one venerates the master’s dignity and the scripture’s authority. First, one visualizes the Three August Ones of the Supreme within the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, with the Thirty-Six Divisions of August Scriptures to the left and the Great Master of the Mystery Center to the right—this is the teaching of the scriptures. From scriptures to masters, and thence to the thousand perfected and myriad spirits, all are the *qi* of the Dao. The Three August Ones of the Supreme are the ancestors of *qi*. The ritual codes and methods of the fast are transmitted only by masters, hence the veneration of the master.

In this way, self and other, Dao and scripture, remain distinct. Yet through *qi* harmonizing with *qi* and spirit summoning spirit, the mechanism of resonance and the path of response are achieved. Here, the arts of calculation arise—waxing and waning, flourishing and declining, each corresponding to the *qi* of its season. Within the human body, too, the Three *Qi* exist, yet submerged in a single form, they cannot manifest their numinosity.

Without first borrowing the *qi* of the Dao, one cannot invigorate the *qi* of the self. Without settling the spirit of the self, one cannot summon the spirit of the Dao. Thus, the three periods of dawn, noon, and dusk must not err—this is the *qi* of generation and life, filling the *qi* of one’s body to abundance.

The blue-green *qi* resides in the human body within the Upper Cinnabar Field, its root in the Liver-Wood, flourishing between *yin* and *mao*. Therefore, one seizes the moment before dawn, riding the Wood’s ascent. At the altar of the fast, first visualize the *qi* of blue-green clouds, suffusing the ritual space—this is the mysterious *qi* of Heaven. Then contemplate the blue-green *qi* rising from the liver like ascending clouds—this is the mysterious *qi* of the body. Thus, the *qi* of Heaven and the *qi* of the self merge. Thereafter, the hosts of immortal soldiers, the thousand perfected and myriad spirits, encircle and guard the altar—this is the principle of resonance and response.

The yellow *qi* resides in the human body within the Middle Cinnabar Field, its root in the Spleen-Earth. Its flourishing is entrusted to the four seasons, not confined to *zi* alone. Among the Five Phases, only Earth dwells in the Central Palace, lacking a fixed season of generation; its birth arises from Fire. Fire flourishes at *wu*, thus Earth thrives by borrowing the generative *qi* of its mother. Therefore, at the noon audience, first visualize the *qi* of yellow clouds, suffusing the altar—this is the primordial *qi* of Heaven. Then contemplate the yellow *qi* rising from the spleen like ascending clouds—this is the primordial *qi* of the body. Thus, the *qi* of Heaven and the *qi* of the self merge. Thereafter, the hosts of immortal soldiers, the thousand perfected and myriad spirits, encircle and guard the altar—this is the principle of resonance and response.

The white *qi* resides in the human body within the Lower Cinnabar Field, its root in the Lungs. Metal flourishes between *shen* and *you*, at the hour of sunset, thus one rides the Metal’s ascent. At the evening audience, first visualize the *qi* of white clouds, suffusing the altar—this is the original *qi* of Heaven. Then contemplate the white *qi* rising from the lungs like ascending clouds—this is the original *qi* of the body. Thus, the *qi* of Heaven and the *qi* of the self merge. Thereafter, the hosts of immortal soldiers, the thousand perfected and myriad spirits, encircle and guard the altar—this is the principle of resonance and response.

The three *qi* correspond to the Three Fields, yet they issue from the liver, spleen, and lungs—all according to the ritual codes and scriptural norms. The liver, spleen, and lungs are the roots of *qi*; the Upper, Middle, and Lower Fields are its abodes. Now, Wood and Fire are both yang; Metal and Water are both yin. Earth, among the Five Phases, governs Fire as its mother, thus borrowing Fire to determine its season of flourishing. The liver pertains to Wood, which generates Fire—all three are yang in nature. Therefore, though the blue-green *qi* roots in the liver, it belongs to the Upper Field as yang. The lungs pertain to Metal, which generates Water—both are yin in nature. Thus, though the white *qi* roots in the lungs, it belongs to the Lower Field as yin. Only the spleen emits yellow *qi*, corresponding to Earth. Heaven’s five and Earth’s ten converge in the Central Palace to generate Earth, residing at the extreme of Heaven and Earth’s numerology as the root of yin and yang. Its source lies in the Middle Field, flourishing with its mother between *si* and *wu*. Hence, dawn is aligned with blue-green, noon with yellow, and dusk with white, harmonizing with the Three *Qi* of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original. Through this, one refines the mortal to become a sage, verifies the degrees, and attains communion with the perfected—all fundamentally derived from this principle, which cannot be fully expounded in words.

The methods of practice are scattered throughout the scriptures. The manifestations and colors of *qi* vary greatly, and these are not the same as this method of cultivation. The blue-green, yellow, and white *qi* employed in purification altars are preserved within the various classics and canons. As for Du Guangcheng’s compilation, his retention of the blue-green, yellow, and white *qi* in purification altars follows the *Scripture of Natural Ritual Propriety*. The external Lingbao scriptures are vast, yet only the *Scripture of Salvation* encompasses all methods. Bestowed by the Primordial Beginning and transmitted with commentary by the Dao Lord, it serves as the essential mechanism of the Middle Vehicle. Even should heaven and earth be remade, this scripture cannot be abandoned. The purification rites originate from the Lingbao tradition, a fact universally acknowledged in both ancient and modern times. When performing purifications, the great Lingbao method is taken as the foundation.

The *Scripture of Salvation* states: Enter the chamber, face east, and strike the teeth thirty-two times to ascend through the thirty-two heavens. Bow in reverence thirty-two times, close the eyes, and silently envision the body seated amidst clouds of blue-green, yellow, and white *qi*, both within and without shrouded in mist. There appear the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, lion, and white crane, arrayed to the left and right—this is the method described by the Dao Lord. When reciting scriptures, one cultivates by unifying the three, for chanting the scriptural text may continue from dawn to dusk without fixed hours, thus necessitating the inclusion of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original Three *Qi*. The phrase "both within and without shrouded in mist" refers to the merging of human *qi* with the *qi* of heaven, the way of resonance between heaven and humanity. Within *qi* arise images, hence the appearance of the four numinous beasts and the like.

In morning purification rites at the altar, the three periods are fixed and unalterable, each aligning with the flourishing of *qi* in the human body to facilitate celestial resonance. First, one visualizes clouds of *qi* filling the purification hall, then imagines the *qi* within the body rising like clouds, harmonizing with the method of resonance described in the scriptures. As *qi* fills and forms images, in the morning one visualizes the Azure Dragon and lion; at noon, the qilin and lion; and at dusk, the White Tiger and lion—consistent with the usage in the scriptures. When reciting scriptures, one envisions them collectively; in purification rites, one visualizes them separately—there is no difference in principle.

Though Master Du’s work is based on the *Scripture of Natural Ritual Propriety*, in Lingbao practice, the methods employed follow the standards of the Most High Dao Lord’s scriptures. Those who preside over these rites must study them deeply. The method of visualization is to be cultivated in daily life as what ought to be practiced, so that when one approaches the altar, one may evoke what is otherwise difficult to evoke.

If at the noon audience one emits red *qi* from the heart, given that fire flourishes at noon, the reasoning is sound. However, one must first visualize clouds of red *qi* enveloping the purification hall. Yet in the celestial realm, none of the ancient scriptures ever speak of red *qi* existing within the three realms. This differs entirely from Master Du’s teachings. In recent times, there have been those who presumptuously exalt themselves.

Those who focus solely on rites of vast emptiness and boundless freedom, seeking to emulate Zhuangzi and Liezi yet falling short, do so merely to deceive the world and steal fame. Thus, in the conduct of fasts and the setting of jiao rites, they employ grand words and lofty discourse to conceal their deficiencies. Many scholars, failing to examine the depth of their teachings, are led astray by their ignorance. As for the Primordial, Original, and Initial Three *Qi*, they speak of them as if tracing back to an undifferentiated beginning. From the Nine *Qi* they reduce to Three *Qi*, and from the Three Realms they condense into One *Qi*. Yet they do not discuss the transformation of the Three Worthies—Primordial, Original, and Initial—nor do they investigate the division of the Three Colors: blue-green, yellow, and white. This is nothing but boastful talk meant to delude others.

The Three *Qi* as blue-green, yellow, and white are also described in the *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts and Admonitions*. It states that when *qi* first congeals, it forms the blue-green, yellow, and white Three *Qi*, placed within the Three Palaces of the Upper Prime. The central *qi* is that of Blue-Green Yang; to the left is the Original Yellow *Qi*, and to the right is the Cavernous White *Qi*, governed by the Heavenly Officials. All these belong to the Jade Purity and are encompassed within the Upper Prime, where the Primordial, Original, and Initial Three *Qi* divide and coalesce.

When the Yellow *Qi* descends and disperses, it forms the Original, Cavernous, Chaotic, and Numinous *Qi*, condensing the essence of Ultimate Yellow. Thus are established the Three Palaces of the Middle Prime, governed by the Earthly Officials. When the White *Qi* descends and disperses, it forms the Chaotic and Moist *Qi*, condensing the essence of Divine Brightness. Thus are established the Three Palaces of the Lower Prime, governed by the Water Officials. This is the division of the Three *Qi* into the Three Primes, as outlined in the scripture.

As for the Three *Qi* residing in the Three Fields within the body, this does not mean that the human body is directly equated with Heaven and Earth. Rather, humans emulate Heaven and Earth to form their bodies, and thus the Three *Qi* are contained within. Heaven is pure yang, condensing the light and clear *qi* to form above. Though Heaven is not the *qi* of Wood or Fire, among the Five Phases, Fire flames upward, being purely yang without doubt. Fire is born from Wood, and Wood is the mother of Fire. The fundamental nature of Wood is that when it grows from the earth, it rises; when placed in water, it floats. Metal, Water, and Earth are all denser than Wood. Fire resides in the southeast—how could it not belong entirely to yang? Being wholly yang, it is above, and thus the Blue-Green *Qi* resides in the Upper Field, symbolizing Heaven. Using the mother while the child follows, the *qi* issuing from the liver becomes the root of the Blue-Green *Qi* within the body. Heaven, with its Blue-Green Yang *Qi*, forms the Three Palaces of the Upper Prime, and thus the Blue-Green *Qi* within the body dwells in the Upper Field.

Water is wholly yin, endowed with the most yielding nature to moisten below. Among the Five Phases, Water’s nature is to seek the low; when placed on earth, it seeps; when forced to a height, it flows, ever-changing yet always settling beneath Earth. Water’s pure yin is also without doubt. Water is born from Metal, and Metal is the mother of Water. The fundamental nature of Metal is that it emerges from Earth, being hard, solid, and heavy. Earth, Water, and Fire are all lighter than Metal. Water, being Metal’s child, resides in the northwest—how could it not belong entirely to yin? Being wholly yin, it is below, and thus the White *Qi* resides in the Lower Field, symbolizing Water. That Water dwells in the Lower Field yet is not Black *Qi* but White *Qi* also follows the principle of the child following the mother, for the *qi* issues from the lungs, becoming the root of the White *Qi* within the body. Water, with its Divine Brightness *Qi*, forms the Three Palaces of the Lower Prime, and thus the White *Qi* within the body dwells in the Lower Field.

Earth, thick and heavy at its root, stabilizes the center of the Two Modes. Earth is Kun and belongs to yin, yet its body is formed of soil. It rightly occupies the Central Palace, and thus the Yellow *Qi* resides in the Middle Field to symbolize Earth. Moreover, the Middle Field is the Crimson Palace. That it emits Yellow *Qi* rather than Red *Qi* is because the *qi* issues from the spleen and dwells in the place of its birth, the child following the mother. Just as the Blue-Green *Qi* does not reside in the liver but in the Upper Field, and the White *Qi* does not reside in the lungs but in the Lower Field, the Three Fields are the dwellings of the Three *Qi*.

According to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* and the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*, three inches inward between the eyebrows is the Upper Cinnabar Field; the heart, called the Crimson Palace, is the Middle Cinnabar Field; and three inches below the navel is the Sea of *Qi*, the Lower Cinnabar Field. Visualizing the Three Fields and Three *Qi* within the body follows the model of the Three Primes and Three Palaces. Thus, the division of the Dao’s Crimson *Qi* manifests in the body’s function and substance.

Visualizing the blue-green, yellow, and white Three-Colored Clouds in the celestial realm as the Three Beginnings—Primordial, Original, and Initial—is the foundation of the Dao and the source of *qi*. When ordering the Five *Qi* within the body, one does not abandon the function of the Five Phases. Metal and Wood interact; Water and Fire descend and ascend. One must seek the Yellow Matron to mediate within the Central Palace, uniting the Four Images into the Great Elixir. Here, Metal and Water are yin, Wood and Fire are yang, with Earth as the foundation. Thus, the Three *Qi*—blue-green, yellow, and white—are the origin of all methods and the root of all transformations. They initiate the Six Poles and establish the Eight Directions, give birth to the Three Powers and nurture the myriad things. Vastly they encompass Heaven and Earth; minutely they enter the tip of a hair—where do they not pervade as the blue-green, yellow, and white Three *Qi*?

The ritual codes of successive dynasties have been practiced for ages, and the ancient scriptures are all clear on these matters. If one were suddenly to take yellow for red, not only would proper principle be difficult to reconcile, but Heaven’s principle would also be violated. In conducting fasts and visualizing the blue-green, red, and white Three *Qi*, it is evident that one must not mislabel them as the Primordial, Original, and Initial Three *Qi*. Within the body, they are the sources of Wood, Fire, and Metal, born of the liver, heart, and lungs. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the Five Phases—are all equal, yet one discards Water and Earth to employ only Wood, Fire, and Metal—how can this be reasonable? The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—the Five Viscera—form a single body, yet one discards the spleen and kidneys to employ only the liver, heart, and lungs—there must be a definitive explanation. If one speaks in terms of yin and yang, then Wood and Fire belong to yang, while Metal belongs solely to yin. Among the Three *Qi*, this would result in two yang and one yin, their weight and lightness unequal.

Neither does it align with the Three Realms above nor accord with the inner elixirs of the *Dan Jing*. The practice of visualization in ritual altars begins at dawn: first, one contemplates the azure clouds overhead, then the azure *qi* within the body, ascending like clouds. At noon, one visualizes the yellow *qi*; at dusk, the white *qi*—all following this pattern. These are the *qi* of the Three Palaces within the body, corresponding to the *qi* of the Three Realms in the heavens above. Subsequently, one proceeds with the invocation of martial forces, descending the upright *qi* of the Five Directions. It is further clarified that one visualizes the *qi* of the Five Viscera and Five Peaks, the true *qi* of the Five Emperors, emanating from the nose to envelop the body and fill the altar. Here, the Five Viscera are paired with the Five Phases, employing the *qi* of the five colors—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.

If the aforementioned azure, yellow, and white *qi*, emanating from within the body, are not to be equated with the Primordial, Original, and Initial Three *Qi*, then does this not imply that the functions of the five *qi* within the body each have their own governance? Beyond these explanations, some may seek to substitute the Primordial, Original, and Initial Three *Qi* of the heavens with the azure, red, and white *qi*. Even if one were to argue this before the Original Celestial Worthy, the just and balanced discourse would not yield. The principles of antiquity and the present are decisively unassailable.

There exist private collections of scriptures whose contents are likewise unreliable. Thus, I dare not follow such teachings. Lu Jianji’s ritual manuals have recently been altered by others, rendering them difficult to verify. Master Lu distinguished the origins of the Three Caverns, categorized the Four Auxiliaries, discerned authenticity from falsehood, and examined right from wrong—his achievements surpass those of antiquity and are incomparable to later generations who blindly boast. The two or three preceding arguments are so well-founded that they could not have originated from Master Lu. His works, transmitted from the Song and Qi dynasties to the present—nearly a thousand years—have been copied with varying errors.

Du Guangcheng’s ritual manuals, composed during the Great Tang, not only examined the ritual codes of the Three Caverns but also took Lu’s protocols as their standard. Had such teachings existed in Lu’s works, how could Du have omitted their details from his writings? Even minor discrepancies in other matters are meticulously recorded—how could he have overlooked this? Thus, Lu’s texts remained uncorrupted during the Tang. What I have observed, however, already contains inconsistencies. If such matters did not originate from Master Lu, then the teachings of Cheng and Guangcheng would not only sow confusion within the tradition but also incur the sin of slandering the worthy.

For twenty years, I have boldly practiced and adhered strictly to Guangcheng’s established forms. All fellow disciples who have received and followed this text may do so with confidence. If errors arise in the noon visualization of yellow *qi*, it is not due to Du Guangcheng’s careless use of the *Weiyi Ziran Jing*, nor is it a fault of the Lingbao Great Rites, which follow the *Duren Jing* of the Most High Dao Lord in employing the azure, yellow, and white *qi*—such practice is not to be abandoned.

As for the arrangement of the Three Treasures, the Most High Boundless Great Dao should not be visualized as the Three Worthies or the position of the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. If the Three Worthies of the Most High are added, then the methods of visualization recorded in the *Lishi Weiyi Jing* would be rendered improper—this, too, is not my fault. I follow the transmissions of the Three Masters as recorded in the scriptures, and my teacher in turn followed Du Guangcheng, who based his work on earlier texts. The azure, yellow, and white *qi* are fundamental to the visualization practices of the *Duren Jing*. Though other scriptures may differ, one should not abandon the foundational source of the *Duren Jing* in ritual practice.

The *Feitian Shibu Miaojing*, comprising thirty-six scrolls, mostly consists of mutually transmitted and copied texts. A few scrolls were printed later, being works of later engraved editions. Among them, the *Duren Jing* is of such antiquity that its authenticity cannot be questioned. The Lingbao Great Rites take the *Duren Jing* as their foundational text, with the visualization of the azure, yellow, and white *qi* as their essential practice. To conduct rituals and fasts while forsaking the foundational principles of the Lingbao tradition—citing obscure and tangential evidence—is impermissible.

Du’s ritual manuals have been followed for four or five hundred years, and later generations must not alter them, for their volumes remain intact. Unlike Lu’s texts, which have endured for ages and become fragmented, they cannot be so easily corrupted. Some recent additions—such as the alternate titles for the Three Worthies of the Most High and the appended verses to the Three Treasures—are the inventions of private individuals. Though these may temporarily confuse the multitude of extant copies, over time, truth and falsehood will become clear.

Fellow disciples who practice this text may proceed with confidence, unburdened by doubt. One may forthrightly report to the Celestial Emperor that the azure, yellow, and white *qi* are employed in the Three Audiences. As I, Jin Yunzhong, now follow Master Du’s ritual manuals, there should be no cause for suspicion. Should any impropriety arise, it is not due to Du’s misguidance of later generations, for the visualization of the Three *Qi* truly originates from the scriptural standards of the Most High Dao Lord. What, then, should I fear?

**Section on Talismanic Methods for the Ritual Altar: The Arrangement of the Three Treasures in the Ritual Altar**

Within the Boundless Dao of the Most High, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures stand to the left, and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center stands to the right. These are the inscribed positions of the Three Treasures, as recorded in Master Guangcheng’s ritual manuals. In all regions where these rites are observed, the original text remains precisely thus—seventeen characters in total, without variation or addition. Recently, however, some have recklessly altered the text, incorporating it into Lu Jianji’s *Ritual of Simplicity*. For instance, the act of offering three pinches of incense with the prayer "May it reach the Three Realms" finds no further elaboration in Du Guangcheng’s manuals. Yet now, the titles of the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High have been appended, followed by the Three Treasures, each assigned to one of the Three Realms, and arbitrarily inserted into Master Du’s ritual texts. Those who first introduced such innovations deserve the most severe condemnation. Neither the unseen nor the manifest realms will tolerate them; the wrath of heaven and humanity alike will descend upon them. To disrupt the teachings and deceive the world is to invite the loss of one’s soul—truly, no pity is warranted. Their nine generations of ancestors will be implicated, a fate most lamentable. The punishment is grave, the calamity profound, and the retribution far-reaching. Yet the Dao is not unkind; it is humanity that brings this upon itself. Let later scholars take heed.

**The Offering of Three Pinches of Incense:**
First pinch of incense: "May it reach the Grand Clarity Realm."
Second pinch of incense: "May it reach the Highest Clarity Realm."
Third pinch of incense: "May it reach the Jade Clarity Realm."

Next, bow reverently and hold the ritual tablet, reciting the incantation in secret:
*"The incense is the scattered radiance of jade blossoms, the congealed smoke of the Nine Qi. The fragrant clouds form a dense canopy, ascending straight to the Nine Heavens. The Golden Youth who attends the incense and the Jade Maiden who conveys words shall transmit my petition, making it heard before the Celestial Emperor. May all that I declare be granted as spoken."*

According to Master Guangcheng’s ritual manuals, the offering of incense proceeds thus: the first pinch is dedicated to the Grand Clarity Realm, the second to the Highest Clarity Realm, and the third to the Jade Clarity Realm—nothing more. Yet in recent times, miscellaneous ritual texts have circulated, claiming instead:
First pinch of incense: "May it reach the Jade Clarity Realm, in offering to the Supreme Dao-Treasure."
Second pinch of incense: "May it reach the Highest Clarity Realm, in offering to the Supreme Scripture-Treasure."
Third pinch of incense: "May it reach the Grand Clarity Realm, in offering to the Supreme Master-Treasure."

Some attribute this to Lu Jianji’s *Ritual of Simplicity*, unaware that Master Lu, who established the teachings and set the model for ten thousand generations, meticulously examined the scriptures to distinguish truth from falsehood across the ages. Having attained liberation and ascended to the ranks of immortals, his compiled ritual texts, though few, were all grounded in scriptural authority and systematic principles. Later generations, failing to investigate their origins, have ascribed many eccentric and novel practices to Lu’s ritual manuals. This abuse was already prevalent during the Tang dynasty. To deceive later learners and slander the worthy ancestors is a grievous offense.

For example, in the *Established Rituals*, it is written:
First pinch of incense: "May it reach the Jade Clarity Realm, in offering to the Wondrously Non-Existent Supreme Emperor, the Self-So Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings, the Supreme Dao-Treasure."
Second pinch of incense: "May it reach the Highest Clarity Realm, in offering to the Wondrously Existent Supreme Emperor, the Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord of the Empty Sovereign, the Supreme Scripture-Treasure."
Third pinch of incense: "May it reach the Grand Clarity Realm, in offering to the Perfectly True Supreme Emperor, the Venerable Lord Lao of Myriad Transformations and Primal Chaos, the Supreme Master-Treasure."

Moreover, a clear annotation beneath these lines states: "From Master Guangcheng’s ritual manuals." Yet Master Guangcheng’s works have circulated widely from antiquity to the present, and such phrases have never appeared. It is unclear from whence they originate. Furthermore, in Master Du’s forty-scroll corpus of 230,000 characters, the titles of the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High do not appear in this form, nor are the Three Treasures ever assigned to the Three Venerables, each governing one. Master Jiang, erudite and well-versed in ritual teachings, would not have made such claims. If this doctrine were drawn from obscure or esoteric texts, later scholars could not be expected to know; but to attribute it to Master Du is unfounded. Master Du’s expansive teachings and writings contain not a trace of such eccentric language. Reading his works, one can well imagine his character—how, then, could such a doctrine be falsely ascribed to him? It is unlikely that Master Jiang would have done so; perhaps it was an error in the carving or printing of his texts. Alternatively, the version of Master Du’s ritual transmitted by Master Jiang may have been altered by later hands without proper verification. Master Du’s manuals have spread throughout the world; if only a privately held copy contained such additions, how could they have been universally inserted into every household’s version?

The Boundless Dao of the Most High is the ancestor of the myriad *qi* and the source of all transformations. The forms of heaven and earth, the myriad beings and kinds, all emerge from the Great Dao. The scriptures are the writings of the Dao, and the masters are the ministers of the Dao—they, too, arise from the Dao. Thus, in the ritual altar, the Boundless Dao is established, with the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures to the left and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center to the right. For the Dao is fundamentally a single *qi*, formless and nameless. When this single *qi* divides into three, it becomes the Three *Qi* of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original, and from the emptiness, spirits are born—hence the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. Though all transformations and beings emerge from the Dao, the Three Venerable Ones serve as its principal embodiments. In the establishment of the teachings, during the Dragon Han kalpa, the *Dongzhen* scriptures were revealed; during the Crimson Brightness kalpa, the *Dongxuan* scriptures emerged; and during the Highest Sovereign kalpa, the *Dongshen* scriptures appeared—these constitute the Thirty-Six Scriptures. With the revelation of the scriptures, the teachings flourished, and the transmission of the scriptures and teachings depended upon the masters. Thus, the establishment of scriptures and masters in the ritual altar is the foundation of the ritual manuals.

The Three Venerable Ones of the Most High are all manifestations of the Great Dao; the scriptures of the Three Caverns are all true scriptures; and the teachings of the Three Vehicles are all transmitted by masters. To assign the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings alone to preside over the Great Dao and serve as the Dao-Treasure is indeed appropriate. Yet the Three *Qi* and Three Venerables are fundamentally of one body. If the Dao Lord and Lord Lao were excluded from this arrangement, then the Dao Lord and Lord Lao would be without the Dao.

Moreover, to assign the Dao Lord alone to preside over the scriptures and serve as the Scripture-Treasure and Scripture-Transmitter would be inappropriate. If this role were exclusively attributed to the Highest Clarity, then the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings and Lord Lao would be without scriptures. Furthermore, to regard Lord Lao solely as the teacher of humans and heavens and thus make him the exclusive Master-Founder, or to claim that the Mysterious Center is Lord Lao’s transformed body—these are rigid and untenable positions. Such assertions appear only in texts like *The Veritable Records of Lord Lao*. If these claims were true, then Lord Lao, as a Heavenly Venerable, would be deemed the Supreme Emperor; if he manifested a transformed body to propagate the teachings, he would merely be the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, and one should not trace his origins to name him as such.

According to the *Scripture on the Ritual Dignity of Masters*, within the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High are enshrined, with the thirty-six sacred scriptures on the left and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center on the right. This arrangement signifies that scriptures possess form, masters take shape, but the Great Dao is formless and beyond conception. Since the Dao is the primal origin, governing all life, serving as the ancestral root through kalpas, and forming the foundation of the Three Realms, it is fitting to enshrine the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, assisted by the scriptures and attended by the masters—this principle is self-evident. How, then, could one claim that the Dao Lord exclusively presides over the scriptures while Lord Lao serves solely as the master?

Furthermore, the titles of the Three Venerable Ones in the scriptures are simply the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings, the Most High Dao Lord, and the Most High Lord Lao. Their alternate titles are the Heavenly Treasure Lord, the Numinous Treasure Lord, and the Divine Treasure Lord. When named after the Three Realms, they are called Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Supreme Clarity; when named after the Three Caverns, they are called Cavern of Perfection, Cavern of Mystery, and Cavern of Divinity. Such is the established convention.

In the ritual manuals of Master Jiang, the titles of the Three Venerable Ones differ, yet in the *Guangcheng Ritual*, such exalted titles were never used. Master Du, as a Grand Academician of the Chongyuan Institute and a chief minister of the Tang court, honored Lord Lao as the imperial ancestor. Thus, he bestowed upon him the august title *Sacred Ancestor Golden Portal Wondrous Non-Existent Heavenly Emperor*. When Master Du compiled the ritual codes during the Tang, how could he dare to discard the court’s exalted titles and replace them with the mutable and chaotic theories of later ages? The claim in Master Jiang’s ritual manuals that the sacred titles of the Three Venerable Ones and the division of the Three Treasures derive from Master Du’s works is unfounded.

As for Lord Lao’s title *Supreme Virtue Emperor of Primordial Chaos*, this was an honorific bestowed by the Song dynasty and did not exist in the Tang. Moreover, the Three Treasures of the Most High, though divided from a single *qi* and originating as one body, are fundamentally without hierarchy or distinction. Between the wondrously non-existent and the wondrously existent lies the ineffable, which defies differentiation. To designate the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings as the Wondrously Non-Existent Supreme Emperor and the Dao Lord as the Wondrously Existent Supreme Emperor is a principle that cannot be justified.

In the second year of the Guangming era, Master Du Guangcheng presented his *Chart of the Primordial Chaos of the Three Realms* to the court. In its preface, he stated: "The Heavenly Venerable is the primordial origin of the ultimate Dao, spontaneously arising. When dissolved, it becomes *qi*; when condensed, it takes form. It is neither non-existent nor existent, neither form nor emptiness, without end or beginning, eternally abiding. Dwelling in the upper realm, it is the origin of the myriad heavens; in the middle realm, the root of the myriad transformations; in the lower realm, the most venerable of the myriad transformations. Without a name to honor it, it is forcibly called the Heavenly Venerable. For the people of the world revere it as they do Heaven—gazing upon it, it is boundlessly high; striving to reach it, there are no steps. Vast and obscure, it cannot be fathomed by reason, expressed in words, ascended by stages, or measured by lifespan. It gives birth to the myriad things yet does not govern them; it guides the myriad transformations yet does not speak. Most exalted and supreme, it is called the Heavenly Venerable."

This is Master Du’s discourse. Since the *Chart of the Primordial Chaos* has been carved in stone and disseminated throughout the world from the Tang to the present, its contents are widely known and cannot be privately altered. Given the origins and development of Master Du’s theories, how could he have designated the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings as the Wondrously Non-Existent and the Dao Lord as the Wondrously Existent?

Consider the beings of the world: they possess form and substance and may be called "existent." The spirits of the yin realm, being formless and bodiless, may be called "non-existent." As for the Heavenly Venerables of the Three Realms, to call them "existent" would be incorrect, for they cannot be seen or exhausted; yet to call them "non-existent" would also be incorrect, for they give birth to heaven and earth and nurture the myriad things. From the ancient scriptures and classics to the works of Zhuangzi, Liezi, and the hundred schools, none have definitively asserted their existence, nor have they decisively denied their non-existence. If the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings is fixed as the Wondrously Non-Existent, then he cannot be said to exist—thus, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings would be no more than a yin spirit. If the Dao Lord is fixed as the Wondrously Existent, then he cannot be said to be non-existent—thus, the Dao Lord would be no more than an ordinary person. Such a view utterly fails to comprehend the nature of the Three Venerable Ones. If this theory were truly derived from Master Du’s ritual codes, then even the most ignorant and vulgar would surpass Master Guangcheng in understanding.

Master Jiang’s works have been widely published. If later scholars do not examine Master Du’s complete writings, they will mislead future generations—how profound would such an error be! Should any scripture claim that the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginnings is the Wondrously Non-Existent Supreme Emperor and the Dao Lord is the Wondrously Existent Great Emperor, unless these words issue from the golden mouth of the Heavenly Venerable himself, they must be the fabrications of mortals. Those who first propagate such falsehoods deserve punishment without pardon. If such claims lack any basis and are arbitrarily asserted, then to slander Master Du Guangcheng in this manner—does one’s conscience remain untroubled?

It is unclear who interpolated these ideas into Master Du’s ritual codes, leading Master Jiang to be misled as well. As for the tablets of the Three Treasures inscribed on ritual altars, all traditional versions of Master Du’s ritual codes state simply: *The Most High Boundless Great Dao*, *The Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures*, and *The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*—these three positions alone. In Master Jiang’s *Established Ritual*, however, the central tablet reads *The Most High Boundless Great Dao*, the left reads *The True Writs and Treasure Talismans of the Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures*, and the right reads *The Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, the Saints of the Ten Directions, and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*.

Master Jiang does not annotate his sources, yet the world claims his teachings derive from Lu Ke. Upon examining Lu Ke’s works, however, one finds that in Zhedong such transmissions are indeed written thus, while in other regions most versions remain identical to Master Du’s ritual codes. Moreover, the texts of Lu Ke’s codes are of great antiquity, rife with errors. Yet where principle resides, there stands the Boundless Great Dao and the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. Thus the scriptures say: *“Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body”*—these are the Three Venerable Ones. Again, it states: *“The Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures to the left”*—the true writs and treasure talismans are already contained within the scriptures, so it seems unnecessary to add these four characters. This may still be tolerable. But to further append the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High to the master’s position—is not the Boundless Great Dao itself the Three Venerable Ones? Does this imply that beyond the Three Venerable Ones there exists another Great Dao? Moreover, the scriptures are merely the books expounded by the Three Venerable Ones. Now, with the scriptures placed to the left and the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High occupying the master’s position to the right, the Three Venerable Ones are thus positioned below the scriptures. If the Three Venerable Ones descend to become the master, then the Great Dao no longer has a sole sovereign. The Three Venerable Ones and the Great Dao cannot be divided into two separate paths. If the Great Dao is these Three Venerable Ones, and the master’s position is likewise occupied by the Three Venerable Ones, this inevitably leads to repetition. Or if the Three Venerable Ones in the master’s position are not the Three Venerable Ones of the Great Dao, then there would be two sets of the Most High’s Three Venerable Ones. Among the various scriptures and canons, some may have different origins. If they are not to be ranked equally with the Dao, the scriptures, and the master as the Three Treasures, then to regard the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High and the Saints of the Ten Directions all as masters—what objection could there be? Yet if their provenance does not pertain to ritual affairs, it becomes difficult to cite them indiscriminately.

Within the ritual altar, since the central position is already occupied by the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the master’s position cannot again be occupied by the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. The *Scripture on Ritual Dignity and Etiquette* explicitly states: *“First visualize the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High in the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, with the Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures to the left and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center to the right.”* This aligns with the earlier principle that the Great Dao is formless and thus visualized as the Three Venerable Ones. Supported by the scriptures and transmitted by the master, this arrangement matches the inscribed tablets, its reasoning evident and beyond doubt. Now, if the Three Venerable Ones are moved to the master’s position, the scriptural instructions cannot be followed, nor can one visualize them thus during the ritual. In Master Jiang’s *Established Ritual*, at the outset of the visualization, he cites the *Scripture on Ritual Dignity and Etiquette*, saying: *“First visualize the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, with the scriptures to the left and the master to the right.”* Yet in the remaining position tablets, he appends the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High to the master’s position. Thus, while others in his lineage must visualize the Three Venerable Ones at the Great Dao’s position, and again at the master’s position, his followers alone must visualize six Venerable Ones—one might call this thorough. But if the Three Venerable Ones are visualized at the master’s position, then the Great Dao has nothing left to visualize. Since the Three Venerable Ones have been relocated to the master’s position, Master Jiang ought to have omitted the visualization passage from the *Scripture on Ritual Dignity and Etiquette* to align with the position tablets and avoid self-contradiction. The proper course is to unify them according to principle. This is not a matter of clinging to one’s own views to refute others, nor of citing unrelated scriptures to fabricate falsehoods. How could the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High share the same position as the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center? Neither in heaven nor on earth does such a principle exist.

Furthermore, in the position tablets, if one follows Master Du’s ritual codes—placing the Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures to the left and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center to the right—what obstruction arises? What matter is left incomplete? What principle is violated? What standard is transgressed? Why then append redundant phrases and embellishments? Yunzhong does not stubbornly uphold Master Du Guangcheng’s texts to the exclusion of all others. Yet when reasoning fails, when heaven is deceived and the world misled, one cannot blindly follow. Though compelled to clarify, this is not a task he relishes. Yunzhong does not wish the world to adopt this teaching, nor does he dare claim Master Jiang’s argument is unsound. Since Yunzhong has received the transmissions of his three masters in this manner, and upon examining the scriptures finds the same, he dares not deviate in practice or proclamation before the Emperor on High. Thus he outlines these points for fellow practitioners of the shared lineage. This is not an attempt to coerce others into agreement. Those who do not share Yunzhong’s aspirations need not adopt this teaching. Followers of Master Jiang’s lineage should not proceed by this path but seek other grounds. Since Yunzhong finds its reasoning unsound, he dares not follow it—how much less when it is falsely attributed to Master Du’s ritual codes? Yunzhong’s wanderings have been extensive, and he has encountered many fine editions of Master Du’s ritual codes, practicing them for a long time. None contain such teachings, hence his strong disapproval. His conviction is absolute and unshaken; though heaven and humanity are vastly distant, the oversight of divine response is swift. Those who perform this ritual should, along with the prior visualization of the green, yellow, and white *qi*, jointly report to the Emperor on High in plain terms.

Yunzhong transmits this as received. Should any part be incorrect, he willingly bears the responsibility. Yet since Yunzhong teaches what he has been taught, and does not claim these are his own innovations or alterations to the ancients’ texts, he will incur no blame.

**Burning the Talismans**
After the secret incantation following the offering of incense (with three pinches), the true writ and the talismans for descending spirits and summoning numina are burned. This is recorded in the *Comprehensive Methods of the Numinous Treasure*. The true writ is the celestial script from the *Central Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, carved into woodblocks and stamped in cinnabar on light yellow paper. Before burning, visualize the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning in the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, as when expounding the scriptures like a millet-grain pearl.

Next, burn the true writ and blow the ashes into the air, visualizing the boundless hosts of the utmost true and great spirits of the ten directions arriving upon the void. Burn and scatter the talismans for descending spirits and summoning numina, envisioning the overseers of the fast, the true numina of the Three Realms, and the myriad chariots and riders encircling and attending the Three Worthies.

**The Imperial Table**
The imperial table is the central table before the Supreme Emperor. It is also called the *Dong* table. *Dong* means "to penetrate," signifying the passage through which the true and the numinous communicate—the place where incense is burned. In the oratory, it stands before the Jade Purity; on the altar, it stands before the Three Treasures. The verse for scattering flowers reads: *"From the Dong table, the censer’s smoke arises; the incense of the effortless Dao and virtue."* This refers to this table. Some from distant regions mistakenly refer to the ritual table as the *Dong* table, which is incorrect.

**The Ritual Table of One’s Position**
This is the ritual table. At the beginning of the fast, the morning memorial is foremost. Standing reverently before the lofty perfected, one fears disorder in speech, so the ritual text is established. Holding the jade tablet upright, one must not grasp the scroll, hence the ritual table is placed before the position where the high priest stands—thus called the "table of one’s position." Since the Song dynasty, the tables used in various regions have been simple horizontal desks, barely sufficient to hold the ritual texts. Therefore, when offering incense and reciting the secret incantation in the hand censer, it serves as the invocation. The intent is to proclaim the words while the heart visualizes the Supreme Emperor.

Jiang’s *Established Rites* places the incense burner on the ritual table, but this practice has not been universally adopted. Moreover, the ritual tables in most places are not so spacious; placing the incense burner to one side would be improper. While a larger ritual table might be desirable, narrow altars cannot accommodate it. Thus, for the incense of one’s position, it is convenient to follow the old custom of offering incense in the hand censer.

**The Incantation**
*"Through form, the empty is revealed; the heart is conveyed by incense. What the heart reaches is neither fire nor smoke. Let your servant’s petition ascend directly to the Nine Heavens. The true numina partake and respond without need for words."*

**Another Incantation**
*"The Dao is studied through the heart; the heart is conveyed by incense. As incense burns in the jade censer, the heart abides before the Emperor. The true numina gaze down; the immortal lattices draw near. Let your servant’s petition ascend directly to the Nine Heavens."*

The master typically transmits the former incantation. As it is a secret incantation recited inaudibly, the heart visualizes the audience with the Supreme Emperor—hence the phrase *"without need for words."*

**Paying Respect to the Master**
Whenever the cantor recites from the ritual text, each participant pays respect to the master while visualizing as prescribed. The high priest closes his eyes and envisions the Three Worthies of the Most High upon the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, with the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures to the left, the Great Master of the Mysterious Center to the right, the Ten Perfected and Five Emperors, and the assembled immortals in attendance, as in the assembly of the host of perfected upon the Jade Capital Mountain. Next, he contemplates the direction of the scripture master and bows three times in his heart, saying: *"May the master attain the immortal Dao; may my person ascend and be delivered."*

Master Guangcheng said: *"Jing* (scripture) means 'distant.' The scripture master is the distant master, the master of one’s master. Through the master’s transmission, one does not forget the origin." Next, he contemplates the direction of the register master and bows three times in his heart, saying: *"May the master attain flight as an immortal; may he deliver me, and may my seven generations of ancestors ascend early to the heavenly halls. May I attain the true Dao and ascend into the formless."*

Master Guangcheng said: *"Ji* (register) means 'to rely upon.' The transmission of the true and the study of the Dao depend upon the master-disciple relationship. The register master is the disciple of the scripture master and the master of the deliverance master." Next, he contemplates the direction of the deliverance master and bows three times in his heart, saying: *"May the master attain deliverance and ascend as a lofty immortal; may he deliver me from the five sufferings and eight difficulties, inscribe my name in the immortal register, and let me forever be a perfected person."*

Master Guangcheng said: *"Du* (deliverance) means 'to advance.' He delivers my mortal body, advancing it to the ranks of the Dao. From mortal to perfected, none do not rely upon the master—this is one’s own master." The three masters are the scripture master, the register master, and the deliverance master. The Dao cannot be without a master. Even in minor arts and single instructions, none are transmitted without a master. How much more so for one who bears the scriptures and registers, performs the great rites, presides over fasts and offerings, and delivers humans and heavens—how could this be without a master? In ancient times, when transmitting registers, the one who possessed the register was regarded as the master. From the middle ages onward, with the establishment of ancestral altars, it was no longer permissible for the master to deliver. Thus, the transmission of scriptures and the bestowal of registers were combined, with the ancestral altar serving as the master. If one inherits and practices the Lingbao ritual for memorials and fasts, one should visualize and bow to the three masters according to the method received. If, apart from the register, one has also received the transmission of scriptures from someone, this should also be included. However, if one were to omit the master who transmitted the method due to having received the scriptures, this would be improper. The practice of scriptures is the thread of the Dao; other methods are the application of the scriptures. The transmission of the scriptures is truly the foundation, and if the one who transmits the method is not counted among the three masters, this would be partial. The method arises from the scriptures; apart from the scriptures, it is not the method. Those who practice heterodox teachings and miscellaneous methods outside the orthodox teaching are not included in the visualization and reverence at the altar.

**The Five Directions’ Guardians of the Numinous Incantation**
Each line consists of four characters. The beginning of the eastern direction is called *"Ninefold Radiance of the Azure Heaven."* The beginning of the southern direction is called *"Southern Vermilion Heaven."* The beginning of the western direction is called *"Heaven of the Seven Qi."* The beginning of the northern direction is called *"Northern Mysterious Heaven."* The beginning of the central direction is called *"Yellow Center Regulating Qi."*

Recently, it has been observed that in the south and north, the character for "direction" (*fang*) is included, while in the east, west, and center, the character for "direction" is added, making each line six characters. This is a matter of the ancient scriptures’ composition having different sentence structures—how could one arbitrarily add to them? Those of discernment should correct this. However, the visualization pertains to the proper *qi* of the five directions, not the three primordial clouds. The three designations combine to generate the nine *qi*, which in their dispersion become myriad distinctions. Dividing their greatness into the five *qi*, in heaven they are the five stars, on earth the five peaks, in humans the five viscera, in things the five phases, and in affairs the five constants.

Now, by reciting the incantation, one visualizes and invokes the proper *qi* of the five directions to expel malevolent vapors and purify the ritual altar. The *qi* of the east pertains to wood, its season is spring, and its ruler is the Azure Emperor. The remaining four directions follow this pattern. Thus, the armies of the Five Directions and Five Emperors are governed by these deities.

The method of visualization and invocation is as follows: in an instant of focused thought, one envisions the true *qi* of each direction, corresponding to its color. Within each *qi*, there are divine soldiers and officials who respond to the incantation, guarding and protecting the ritual altar. Recently, some have used talismans for the Five Directions’ guardian spirits, but these do not belong to the *Dongxuan Lingbao* tradition and are therefore not employed here. Instead, we adhere to the guardian incantation transmitted by former masters, as recorded in the *Scripture of Essential Explications of the True Writ* and also found in the *Golden Register of Simplified Writs*.

**Striking the Ritual Drum**
Master Guangcheng states: The ritual drum serves to rectify the inner spirit-*qi* and dispel outer demonic influences—it is the first act in all ritual proceedings. Striking the teeth on the left is the Heavenly Bell, on the right the Heavenly Chime, and in the center the Ritual Drum. The rhythm follows eight beats as a measure, and three sets of eight—twenty-four in total—correspond to the twenty-four spirits of the three divisions and eight luminaries within the body. The ritual drum dispels demonic forces externally and gathers the twenty-four body spirits internally; it is not performed in vain.

**The Ritual Brazier**
The Most High Lord Lao of the Three Primordial *Qi* of the Supreme Three Heavens summons forth the Three and Five Merit Officials within our bodies, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six of each. Let them emerge in solemn array. We hereby notify the local earth gods and true officials of this domain.

We now reverently burn incense and perform the Dao rites, offering this for [Name], for state and family, in the grand *Huanglu* fast. We pray for the prolongation of Heaven’s mandate, the prosperity of the nation, and the well-being of the people. All sincere supplications are set forth in the memorial text. May the life-*qi* of the Most High’s ten directions and true perfected beings descend and flow into our bodies, that our entreaties may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Perfect, Boundless, Supreme Dao—the August Jade Sovereign of the Limitless Heaven.

This ritual was established by Lu Jianji and Du Guangcheng. While their versions differ in certain details, Master Guangcheng, though basing his work on the *Golden Register Simplified Texts*, cross-referenced the scriptures and precepts of the Three Caverns, leaving nothing undetailed. The present incense-offering rite follows the original *Dongxuan* format, which admits no further alteration. The invocation of the Most High, Mysterious, Primordial, Fivefold Numinous Lord Lao to summon the spirits within our bodies—this pertains to the *Zhengyi* incense-offering rite of the *Dongshen* division and differs from the present form.

Recently, some have presumed to alter the text at will. For instance, the line “thirty-six of each emerge in solemn array, notifying the local earth gods” has been changed to “thirty-six of each emerge; summon the local earth gods to swiftly come forth and receive notification.” This is a grave error. The original text refers to the thirty-six spirits within the body, all of whom emerge in solemn array, surrounding the practitioner front and back to notify the earth gods and fulfill their duty of transmitting sincerity. It should not be altered to read as if the earth gods themselves are to swiftly emerge.

Jiang’s *Established Rites* also briefly outlines the incense-offering rite but with variations. For example, the *Golden Register Simplified Texts* omits the Left and Right Attendant Envoys beneath the Three and Five Merit Officials. Another version omits the phrase “Incense Officials of the Day” beneath the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans. Many such discrepancies exist. The present text follows Guangcheng’s version as definitive, for while variant texts—including those of Zhang Wanfu and other Celestial Masters—predate Guangcheng, he has already edited and refined them, swearing oaths to Heaven in their execution. Thus, his version is to be upheld.

As for the phrase “the presence of the Perfect, Boundless, Supreme Dao—the August Jade Sovereign of the Limitless Heaven,” Guangcheng’s research is exhaustive. The “Boundless Supreme Dao” refers to the Primordial Three *Qi* of the Mysterious and Origin in aggregate. These Three *Qi* coalesce into the Three Realm Celestial Worthies in form and disperse as *qi*; together, they are called the Supreme Dao. Moreover, *qi* is the ancestral origin of the myriad *qi* and the root source of Heaven and Earth—most revered and supreme. That which transcends form is called Heaven; since Heaven has form, how could it lack a sovereign? Thus, the August Sovereign of the Vast Heaven is the ruler of Heaven. The sincerity of the fast is rooted in the Supreme Dao and governed by the August Sovereign of the Vast Heaven; hence, it is said to “swiftly ascend to the presence of the Perfect, Boundless, Supreme Dao—the August Jade Sovereign of the Limitless Heaven.” This encompasses all origins without omission.

Recently, some have added “the Three Clarities, Supreme Thearchs” to “Boundless Supreme Dao.” Jiang’s *Established Rites* briefly addresses this, noting that recent additions of the “Three Clarities, Supreme Sages” cling to superficial forms and do not conform to ritual standards. However, it does not systematically analyze the ritual texts or elucidate the principles to dispel worldly confusion. Since the Jin dynasty under Lu Jianji and the Tang under Zhang Qingdu, and later with Guangcheng’s compilation of ritual methods, no one has altered these words for hundreds of years. Yet now, some still introduce strange innovations into the incense-offering text, perpetuating errors without correction. Such transgressions are what scholars must deeply guard against.

**Commanding Demons**
The High Priest turns left and stands facing west at the Ghost Gate. The Cantor proceeds to the Heavenly Gate and stands facing east. The High Priest knocks his teeth three times, swallows saliva three times, and visualizes the sun and moon before his face, entering through the nose into the Cavern Chamber’s Golden Flower Palace. Two-thirds of the way between the eyebrows, it divides into the Twin Cinnabar Fields. Further inward by three-tenths into the bone is the Terrace Gateway. Directly inward by seven-tenths, to the left is the Azure Gate and to the right the Purple Gate. Three inches inward from between the eyebrows is the Cinnabar Field Palace, also called the Mud-Pill Palace. Four inches inward is the Flowing Pearl Palace. Five inches inward is the Jade Emperor’s Palace. One inch directly above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace. One inch above the Yang Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace. One inch above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace. One inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Sovereign Palace. These are the palaces listed in the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*.

Master Wucheng cites the *Nine Palaces Formula*, stating that five inches inward is the Jade Emperor’s Palace, also called the Golden Flower Palace. The nine palaces each span one inch square. The Golden Flower lies south of the Cavern Chamber. Radiance emerges from the back of the head, forming a resplendent nine-colored orb that penetrates the Jade Pillow, illuminating the ten directions. It revolves with me as I recite the secret incantation, which must not be audible to the ears. Those who violate this will incur fault. Beware.

**Secret Incantation:**

Within the Yellow Center, strategize qi to sever demonic traces,
Inspect and restrain fierce spirits, sever the roots of wayward elders.
The Supreme Lord issues a decree to the Supreme Lord’s Chamber,
Urging the Northern Emperor to hasten to the Jade Palace.
Receiving the mighty command, proclaim it to the Demon Kings—
Five qi billow and surge, clashing with fate.
The secret jade scriptures now flourish in full.

As the Three Heavens turn bright, the Six Heavens reach their end—
How wise the adept!

It is essential to note that the protocol for summoning demonic forces has been recorded in fasting rituals since antiquity. From Lu Jianji to Du Guangcheng and other masters, all compiled their works in accordance with ancient codes, mandating the summoning of demonic forces during the three daily audiences—no room for doubt. Jiang’s *Ready-Made Ritual* states that Zhao Daosheng’s *Yellow Register Ritual* summons demonic forces only at the noon audience, following the *Zhenghe Golden Register*—both rooted in ancient tradition. However, the *Golden Register Ritual of the Daoist Altar* commissioned by Emperor Xuanhe arranges its sequence such that demonic forces are summoned during all three audiences, followed by *Step Void*, the setting of the offering, and then the dispersal of the altar rites. This version was compiled by Yang Jie. Other ritual manuals prescribe that when incense is offered in the hand-held censer, the incantation "Through emptiness, form manifests; the heart transmits through fragrance" is used—a slight variation from the incantation for holding the jade censer while visualizing the Nine Heavens. As the teachings flourished, the examination and refinement of ritual codes became meticulous. Thus, the imperial *Golden Register Ritual* largely adheres to ancient methods.

Jiang’s *Ready-Made Ritual* further cites Zhang Qingdu, who said: Before the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scriptures, the demon kings of all heavens roamed the vast skies, wielding power and spreading poison. After the Heavenly Worthy preached, the demon kings submitted to transformation, and thus the assembly of sagely generals would first command the demon kings to lead the way. Jiang adds: The scriptures state that demon kings respectfully receive their duties and thereby attend upon all heavens. Therefore, during *Step Void*, one first visualizes and commands the demon kings. Yuan Zhong insists that this passage refers to Zhang Qingdu’s explanation that after the scriptures were preached, the demon kings submitted to transformation, receiving divine mandates to universally sweep away inauspicious forces. Whenever the Heavenly Emperor is to travel, the demon kings are commanded to lead the way—this is one interpretation. Yet to directly apply this meaning to justify commanding demon kings before *Step Void* is somewhat inadequate. If the Heavenly Emperor is to travel and the demon kings are to lead the way, then when offering incense to the ten directions, the Three Worthies are already visualized at the altar’s center. From the invocation of the sagely to the proclamation of words, the repentance toward the directions—all are addressed to the Emperor, with the deities already long present in the altar. The demon kings should clear the path and fulfill their duties at the very moment the Emperor descends to the altar. Why wait until *Step Void* to command them? Such reasoning is flawed.

Moreover, the sequence of the audience rites proceeds as follows: First, the High Master offers incense to express reverence and convey sincerity. Next, the furnace is activated to announce the intent of the fast, manifest the body’s spirits, summon the local deities, and proclaim the register. Each then declares their dharma rank, as the High Master and Daoist assembly state their positions and names. Together, they sincerely petition the sagely hosts, articulating the High Master’s purpose in receiving the words and conducting the fast. Up to this point, all are the High Master’s words. Having stated the purpose of receiving the words, the Green Petition is then proclaimed to express the fast-officiant’s innermost sentiments. Once the officiant’s intentions are thus revealed, the morning’s merit begins with prayers for the emperor, universal blessings, the liberation of the nine generations of ancestors, and the well-being of the living—this is the meaning of the threefold offering of incense. All requests and prayers are contained within these words. For the deliverance of the deceased, one considers their accumulated sins in life. For the protection of the living, one fears their past transgressions. Though earnest in seeking blessings and grace, if misfortunes remain entangled across the ten directions and three realms, and sins are recorded in the celestial and terrestrial courts, how can the mysterious grace descend, or the records of evil be erased? Thus, one pays homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, repenting toward each quarter, extending to the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and peaks—all beseeching the absolution of transgressions and the erasure of sinful records.

All these actions take place within the fast altar, yet the officials of the three realms are involved in examination and judgment. The sagely hosts and protective deities of the fast merely assist and guard. Next, one models the practice after the Jade Capital of the Jade Clarity Heaven, the Jade Metropolis of the Mysterious Capital, the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace of the Golden Watchtower, and the Supreme Palace of the Purple Tenuity—where the sagely hosts of all heavens gather thrice monthly, and from the Heaven of Pure Tenuity downward, all pay homage to the Primordial Beginning. This is recorded in the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure*.

Master Guangcheng states: The *Ten Verses of Step Void* originate from the *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Capital of the Numinous Treasure*, wherein the sagely hosts of the ten heavens circumambulate the Jade Capital Mountain, chanting verses of perfected cultivation. The scripture says: When establishing a fast and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Emperor Kings ride cloud chariots of green, drawing eight-jewel jade carriages. Perfected beings and jade maidens hold flower banners, leading with phoenix songs and following with celestial harmonies. White cranes and lions roar in unison, burning incense and scattering flowers as they float through the air, venerating the rites and listening to the Dharma’s sound. At this time, the recording of sins and blessings, the relevance or irrelevance of documents, the summoning or dismissal of petitions—all depend on the circumambulation of *Step Void*. As the heavenly perfected deities, vast and boundless, descend from the void without regard to distance, the cosmos must first be purified. This is not limited to the confines of a single altar.

The method requires the High Master to secretly employ divine radiance and reverently proclaim the Dao’s decree, summoning the Northern Emperor by the Supreme Lord’s command to dispatch the Demon Kings, inspect and restrain fierce spirits, and sever the roots of evil. As the jade scriptures flourish, the Three Heavens turn bright, the true teachings spread, and the immortal Dao prospers. The roots of evil are sealed, the demonic path vanishes, yin qi crumbles, and the Six Heavens cease. Within the six directions, the Dao’s qi overflows, ascending to the nine skies and pervading the ten thousand realms. Countless sagely hosts can then float through the void, observing and listening to the Dharma’s sound.

Thus the High Master’s ability to proclaim the Supreme Lord’s decree and evoke such resonance lies in their mastery of internal refinement through exhalation and inhalation, embryonic breathing, and tranquil spirit-cultivation, whereby the Mud-Pill Palace becomes radiantly luminous—with but a single visualization, divine radiance shines forth. Further empowered by the Supreme Lord’s incantations and commands, the Demon Kings receive their charge. Thereupon, in reverent fulfillment of the Celestial Emperor’s mandate, they sweep clean the cosmos, purifying all realms near and far, so that the host of sages may float through the void to listen to the *Step-in-Emptiness* hymns.

This efficacy extends beyond the confines of a single altar’s inner or outer precincts, nor is it limited to the assembled perfected of the precept-retreat. It is precisely for this reason that such rites are performed after the repentance and thanksgiving liturgies, yet before the *Scattering Flowers* and *Step-in-Emptiness* ceremonies. At the inception of ritual protocols, the teachings are established through scripture. Once the circumambulation of the *Step-in-Emptiness* is complete, the proper observance is to venerate the scriptures.

Thus it is said: “The demon kings of heaven stand in reverent protection, and the world receives great blessings.” This arises from upholding the scriptures, maintaining the precepts, contemplating the Dao, and dispelling desires—such is the merit that elicits veneration. Next, it is proclaimed: “As the scriptural Dao flourishes and spreads, households and nations prosper. With unceasing cultivation, one enters the Great Vehicle, enabling the seven generations of ancestors to ascend, while the practitioner’s own form transcends the mundane.” Here, a second bow is rendered. For those who cherish the scriptures and savor the Dao, who dwell within the teachings to attain immortality, ultimately becoming companions of the Dao—refining their corporeal form to transcend the tribulations of the Three Realms and deliverance from the sufferings of hell—the very source of such merit lies in the scriptures. Thus, the rite concludes with three prostrations. Such is the significance of the threefold veneration of the scriptures.

From the retreat to the scriptural recitation, one hears the scriptures and awakens to the Dao, cultivates authenticity and bears the talismanic registers, propagates the teachings to deliver gods and humans. Now, the retreat officiant repents of transgressions and venerates the Ten Directions, entreating blessings from the celestial realms, extolling merit and bowing to the scriptures. Thereupon, gratitude is offered to the Three Treasures, the dharma ranks are solemnly invoked once more, and in reverence before the celestial gates, a universal repentance and thanksgiving is performed—not merely directed to the Ten Directions and the sacred peaks and watercourses, but encompassing all, hence called the *Great Thanksgiving*. Only then does the recitation of vows resume at the incense burner, its principle now fully elucidated.

As for those like Zhao Daosheng, who regard the summoning of demons as an exclusive focus on internal visualization—claiming the Supreme Lord never leaves the Mud-Pill Palace, the host of perfected reside within the body, and the demon-summoning operates solely within the corporeal frame—such an interpretation misconstrues the scriptural intent and misidentifies the true source. It is akin to silently petitioning the Celestial Emperor, reporting retreat affairs within the upper cinnabar field—an egregious error.

Indeed, the Mud-Pill Palace contains the Nine Palaces, and the body harbors the myriad spirits; how could this be otherwise? From the *Cavern-Real Heavenly Treasure* Dao to the Three Vehicles of the *Numinous Treasure* and *Divine Treasure* teachings, all encompass cultivation within the body. Some practices emphasize internal focus, while others harmonize inner and outer dimensions. When the Dharma Master enters seclusion to sit upright, refining form and spirit, this is the internal aspect. Ascending the altar to pay homage, expounding the rites and conducting the retreat—this is the engagement of mortal sincerity to reach the Celestial Emperor. Submitting memorials and petitions, projecting the spirit to visit the celestial heights—this is the spirit’s departure from the body to approach the lofty heavens. Repenting before the perfected, performing circumambulation, burning incense, descending the Five Qi to purify the altar, uniting the Three Primes to invoke the Great Dao, summoning the Demon Kings to purify the Six Directions, emulating the Jade Capital in chanting the *Step-in-Emptiness*—all these are the resonant pathways of inner-outer correspondence, the means of evoking spiritual response. How could the summoning of demons be entirely confined to the body’s interior?

Others claim that yang arises at *zi* and culminates at *wu*, while yin arises at *wu* and culminates at *zi*, and that the intersection of yin and yang necessitates summoning demons at the *wu* hour. This, too, lacks scriptural basis and stems from rigid adherence to internal cultivation. If the Jade Emperor and the Three Pure Ones never leave one’s body, and the thousand perfected and myriad spirits all reside within, then why erect altars, conduct retreats, or draft memorials with itemized petitions? If the retreat officiant addresses the self, the self knows—and the Mud-Pill Palace knows—then all ritual documents, retreats, and offerings could be dispensed with. This directly contravenes the sagely masters’ intent in bequeathing liturgical protocols to save the world.

The twenty-seven ranks of retreats and forty-two grades of offerings each possess distinct hierarchies and classifications; how could one focus solely on internal practice while neglecting the scriptural registers and retreat observances? As for the harmonization of metal and wood, the pairing of *kan* and *li*, the coagulation of mercury and lead, the descent of the dragon and the subjugation of the tiger—these pertain to internal alchemy and have no external dimension. Yet they cannot serve as the foundation for liturgical protocols or the conduct of retreats and offerings in the world. Scholars must understand the origins and currents of both internal cultivation and external refinement. Those who uphold the teachings and perform the rites should clarify their fundamental principles, lest they mistake south for north and fall into confusion and error.

To assert that demon-summoning incantations are purely internal practices, with demon kings and spirits all residing within the body, is a principle difficult to reconcile. As the *Step-in-Emptiness Scripture* states:

> “Looking up and down, I contemplate the Supreme Lord,
> The radiant splendor flourishes in the cinnabar field.
> Glancing left, I raise Yu Yi,
> Gazing right, I accompany Jie Lin.
> The Six Perfections crown the Brahman conduct,
> Dao and virtue renew in paired progression.”

This describes the constant contemplation of the Supreme Lord, practicing the superior methods of the sun and moon, such that Dao and virtue are daily renewed—achievements cultivated internally yet manifesting externally. Further:

> “Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
> Delighting in reciting the subtle and profound scriptures.”

This means that without transcendent talent, one cannot grasp the subtle scriptures or fully comprehend their chapters and profound principles. Again:

> “The qi of profound emptiness and great harmony,
> Exhaling and inhaling the essence of rosy clouds.
> Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages,
> In solitude, I master the Three Conveniences.
> The Mud-Pill Palace shines with luminous splendor,
> And I attain the Golden Flower Immortal.”

This speaks of awakening to the deep mechanisms of the scriptural instructions, applying them through exhalation and inhalation, practicing embryonic breathing to attain secret techniques, illuminating the Mud-Pill Palace, and ultimately achieving true immortality in unity with the Dao—an internal refinement culminating in success. If this is so, then even the demon kings of heaven will respectfully receive their charge, not merely offering protection but enabling one to ascend and pay homage to the myriad heavens.

Thus it is said: when demon kings respectfully receive their charge, one may ascend to pay homage to the myriad heavens. All that brings this about arises from the accumulation of merit through fasting and precepts. Therefore, the text concludes: “All begins with fasting and precepts, / Merit accumulates to bind past affinities. / Soaring through the Great Void, / One is borne aloft to join the exalted immortals.”

To fly through the vastness of the heavens is to achieve lightness of being—no longer confined within the body. If the demon kings remain within the body, dwelling only above the head, then they receive their charge in the field of the body and pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor in the Mud-Pill Palace. Though this may bring success, when one’s allotted span is exhausted, one becomes but a corpse-guarding ghost, not a true immortal. Such homage to the Mud-Pill Palace marks only the beginning of cultivation; it is not the ultimate attainment. To ascend into the empty mystery and serve as minister to the Three Realms—this alone is true immortality. The practice of inner refinement and the lightness of ascent in the heavens reflect the intent of the *Scripture of Pacing the Void*.

Now, in the ritual altar, when commanding the demons, one first visualizes the sun and moon entering the nostrils, then the radiance of the Cavern Chamber shines forth. This is because the luminosity of the Mud-Pill Palace has not yet arisen spontaneously, so one relies on visualization to proceed. Since one’s body has not yet become a true immortal, one cannot immediately command the demon kings; thus, one invokes the authority of the Most High to enact the rite. This practice aligns in principle with the chapter on pacing the void. Hence, the tenth chapter of *Pacing the Void* also states: “Scattering flowers to declare my vow, / Grasping the tally to summon the demon kings.” This expresses the same meaning.

The scriptures speak of immortality as a natural attainment, while altar rites employ provisional methods. Once the Way of Embryonic Breathing is perfected and the radiance of the Mud-Pill Palace shines forth, one need not visualize sun and moon—light will illumine the ten directions; one need not recite secret incantations—the demon kings will receive their charge. Yet to reach this stage, one must not personally tread the ritual altar or seek fame among the worldly. These are the regulations of fasting rites, and thus they are set forth in detail.

**Section on Memorials and Petitions**

Memorials follow ancient forms. Though the ritual documents of each age differ, the structure of memorials admits no private alteration. For instance, in the Yellow Register Retreat, five standard memorials have always been used, all in vermilion script: the *Memorial of the Plain Chariot and White Horses*, the *Memorial to Break Fengdu and Release from Sin*, the *Memorial to Open the Road*, the *Memorial for Bathing and Refining the Transcendence*, and the *Memorial for Ascending and Delivering the Deceased Soul*. Recently, some have altered or rearranged these forms. Yet the master’s transmitted tradition cannot be changed with the times; thus, the ancient forms are followed.

**Memorial of the Plain Chariot and White Horses**

Your servant [Name], holding the register and office of the Numinous Treasure of Highest Clarity, with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses the exalted heavens:

I have heard that to deliver and assist the hidden souls, their ascent truly depends upon the mysterious blessings of the Dao. To issue and proclaim the true talismans, their announcement must rely upon the divine officials. With humility, I dare to express my earnest devotion and presumptuously address the lofty heavens.

Your servant, residing in [State] Prefecture, [County], [Location], holding the Daoist office of [Rank] [Name], together with his household, respectfully undertakes the establishment of the Great Yellow Register Grand Fast of the Most High for [number] days and nights. This offering is made to augment the nation’s fortune, universally bless all living beings, open the path for the deliverance of the seven generations of ancestors’ souls, and broadly rescue the lonely spirits of the Nine Dark Realms. Gathering the merits of good deeds, we seek to transcend and deliver the deceased [Name], that they may swiftly ascend to the Dao-realm.

Your servant, moved by the sincerity of these words, finds them impossible to suppress. Having already prepared and submitted the memorial petition, I now presume to address the boundless heavens. In reverent accordance with the ritual codes, I have established the altar precinct, performed the circuit of the Dao, recited the scriptures, and offered morning audiences to the Perfected, repentances, and thanksgivings. Today, I proclaim and enact the primordial talismanic decrees: the Golden Register and White Tablet, the True Talismans for Deliverance from Suffering, the Most High’s Edict of Pardon and Birth in Heaven, the Most High’s True Talisman for Breaking Open the Earth-Prison, the True Talisman for Rescuing Lonely Souls, the Nine Dragon Decree of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Palace, and the Jade Seal of the Great Unity’s Mysterious Darkness and Primal Divine Tiger.

By these means, I deliver the seven generations of ancestors—parents and kin—of the deceased [Name], along with all categories of lonely souls, that they may all assemble at the fast’s altar. On the [day] of [month], the imperial altar was established at dusk, summoning the deceased spirits to manifest signs of response and guiding them to attend the Perfected. On [day], at dawn, the main fast commenced, unfolding over three days. Universal offerings of grain were distributed, broadly aiding the lonely souls; their spiritual consciousness was refined and delivered, and the precepts and talismans were transmitted.

Your servant respectfully invokes:
One Great General of the Plain Chariot and White Horses,
One hundred and twenty Official Lords, Generals, and Clerks,
One Clerk of the Mysterious Capital’s Water-Chestnut Dragon Post,
One Flying Celestial Divine Person,
One Messenger of the Nine Dragon Decree of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Palace.

These are commanded to proclaim and transmit the talismanic decrees, announcing them to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the one hundred and twenty offices, the Five Thearchs’ Examiners, the clerks of the Six Palaces, the officials of the Fengdu Palace, the officers of punishment and judgment, the Five Marchmounts and Nine Dark Realms, the sources of rivers and springs, the Five Paths’ Capital, the Great Spirits of the Dark Abyss, the Four Drainages and Three Rivers, the Nine Jiang and Eight Seas, the Yellow Springs and the Fields of Hao, the Earth-Shrine Lords of the Nine Provinces, the Heavenly Prisons and Earthly Hell, the Dark Passes and Nether Roads, and all kings and rulers—all are to receive and heed the talismanic decrees.

May the seven generations of ancestors, parents, and kin of the deceased [Name], along with the lonely souls of the Nine Provinces’ domains, the Three Paths and Five Ways, the ten thousand kinds of the Four Modes of Birth, and all suffering spirits of the dark realms, be granted pardon. May their myriad sufferings be wholly dispelled, may they depart from the earth-prison, forever bid farewell to the eternal night, and behold the light. May their transgressions be absolved, their evil roots severed and extinguished, and by virtue of these meritorious causes, may they undergo refinement and be reborn.

With compassion, O Most High, discern and respond to this single entreaty.

Your servant, relying upon the Direct Envoys of the Two Officials, the Merit Officers of the Three and Five, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Clerks of Yin-Yang Divine Decisions, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Clerks of the Gale-Riding Posts, the Memorial-Mounting Envoys, and the Flying Dragon Riders—these officials are commanded to carry this petition to the Three Heavenly Courts of the Most High, awaiting the proclamation of response.

Your servant [Name], with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this memorial.

The *Plain Chariot and White Horse Memorial* follows the old format as such. In recent times, some have added *Officials of Purification and Altar Guardians* after the requesting officials, petitioning for their descent together. Others have altered its name to the *Purification Memorial*, omitting the *Great General of the Plain Chariot and White Horse*. Each follows their master’s transmission or personal judgment. In this method, the old formula as transmitted by the master is preserved. Those of different lineages may follow their own traditions.

Purification is the duty of subordinate officials—dispelling impurity and expelling malevolence to await the descent and inspection of the Imperial Perfected. It is not fitting to request the Supreme Emperor to dispatch Dharma officials for purification.

**Memorial for Extracting Sins from Fengdu**

Your servant [Surname] [Name], of the [Rank] of the *Lingbao* Register of the *Shangqing* Dao, with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this memorial.

I have heard that sentient beings, accumulating sins, fall into the dark judgments of the netherworld. The Great Dao, flowing with compassion, broadly delivers those suffering in the springs’ prisons. To lift the sunken and stagnant, one must rely on the grace of the divine.

Your servant, in accordance with the residence of [Official Rank] [Surname] [Name] of [State] [Prefecture] [County] [Location], who serves the Dao, petitions to deliver and uplift the souls of the departed, guiding them to ascend to the realm of the Dao.

With utmost sincerity and rightful duty, I hereby report: Having already recorded and submitted this petition in advance, I shall, on [day], begin the fast and establish the altar, and from [day] onward, commence the *Huanglu* Grand Fast for [number] days and nights. I shall perform morning rites to the Perfected, offer repentance, conduct Daoist rituals, recite scriptures, request decrees and bestow talismans, summon souls, and deliver transformations, that both the hidden and manifest may together bathe in the blessings of creation.

Your servant respectfully petitions for the descent of the *True Summoning Spirit Talisman* and the *Spirit-Summoning Youths*. Reverently, I request the *Taiyi True Talisman* to be bestowed upon the *Great Compassionate One, the Most Benevolent Taiyi Savior from the Azure Palace of the Eastern Ultimate*.

I beseech the descent of merciful light to universally illuminate the ten directions of the world, the Northern Yin Fengdu, the Six Heavens and Ten Caves, the Five Sacred Mountains and the depths of the nether springs, the courts of punishment in the dark realms, and all celestial prisons and earthly hells, that all may receive the grace of compassion and attain universal peace.

I petition for the dispatch of *Savior Perfected Ones*, *Savior Youths*, and *Azure Mystery Jade Maidens* to descend into the hells, nether offices, dark prisons, and night bureaus, opening barriers, pardoning sins, and halting suffering. Let blades shatter, fetters be destroyed, records of sins sink and vanish, registers of transgressions melt away, confrontations be resolved, and enmities reconciled.

May the multitudes bearing sand and stone, the laborers drawing waves from the dark depths, the spirits driving thunder and wielding lightning, the ghosts sweeping mountains with wind, the souls enduring unjust retribution, the dragons burrowing earth and drawing water, the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of forebears, and the lonely spirits of the six directions and myriad paths—all be released from their exiles, and all imprisoned be granted amnesty.

May they be ranked in the Southern Palace, liberated from the Northern Bureau, their earthly labors ended, and their names inscribed in the registers of rebirth. May the moving and still, the flying and submerged, the feathered, furred, scaled, and shelled, each return to their true nature and attain revival and awakening.

With compassion, I distinguish and humbly implore the Most High.

Your servant respectfully entrusts this memorial to the *Direct Envoys of the Two Offices*, the *Meritorious Clerks of the Three and Five*, the *Left and Right Official Envoys*, the *Yin-Yang Divine Central Clerks*, the *Disciplinary Chariot and Red Talisman Clerks*, the *Gale-Riding Courier Clerks*, the *Post-Horse Memorial Envoys*, the *Flying Dragon Riders*—these officials are commanded to carry this petition to the Three Heavenly Courts of the Most High, awaiting the proclamation of response.

Your servant [Name], with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this memorial.

*Petition to Open the Way*
The servant [Surname and Name], holding office in the registers of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure Methods, with reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this memorial.

Your servant has heard that the dark paths of the netherworld are vast and desolate, where rare is the opportunity for transcendence and deliverance. Yet the compassionate and benevolent Mysterious Dao has greatly established the canon of promotion and ascension. Without relying on the gracious favor of the Celestial Vault, none could expand the bridge between the hidden and the manifest. Daring to overstep the august majesty, I presumptuously present my humble sincerity.

Your servant respectfully states that, residing at [Residence Location] in [Prefecture], [Subprefecture], [County], [Place], the Daoist official [Surname and Name], along with named family members, petitions to undertake the establishment of the Great Yellow Register Retreat of the Most High for [number] days and nights. Though the rite aims to summon souls and deliver the transformed, we remain concerned that the barriers between yin and yang may yet obstruct, and that hun and po spirits may remain bound and submerged.

We reverently beseech the Most High Direct Talisman Envoys, and the Direct Talisman Envoys of the Three Realms—one each—to bear the Most High’s talismanic decrees and memorials, and to proclaim them to the Three Primes and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Examiners of the Five Thearchs, the Chief Scribes of the Four Departments, the Northern Yin Fengdu, the inner and outer palace caverns, the Nine Dark and Ten Thousand Offices, the boundless hells, the springs and bends of rivers, the depths of the Mingling Waters, the Five Paths’ Capital Bureaus, the Nine Mounds’ Earthly Sovereigns, the Earthly Bureaus below, the Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces, the renowned mountains of the Five Peaks, the grotto-heavens and hidden retreats, the examining officials and clerks, the elders of forests and mountains, the city gods of the world, the deities of altars and temples, this year’s Grand Year Star, the local earth gods and true spirits, the chief scribes of the good and evil departments, the one hundred twenty office officials, the celestial prisons and earthly hells, the dark passes and hidden retreats, and all those who preside over these domains.

May they all respectfully heed the commands of the Supreme Mystery, open the passes and clear the paths, release the guilty and free the imprisoned. May the soul of [Name] be delivered, and [Names] and others be attached in offering; may all ancestral kin within the gates, and the myriad souls of the Nine Provinces’ fields, the Five Paths and Four Births, the boundless ghostly multitudes of every kind, each be liberated. May their forms and souls be escorted and protected, all proceeding to the retreat altar to attend the Three Treasures, hear the scriptures, listen to the Dharma, receive the precepts, and transmit the talismans. May the long night’s paths be brightly illumined, and the roads of the nether realms be widely opened. When merit is complete and fruit is full, may they ascend the immortal ranks. As for those spirits who obstruct or delay, may the dark bureaus demote them in office.

We humbly implore the Most High to distinguish and compassionately grant these petitions.

*[As in the previous closing formula, the outer envelope may be omitted, following the prior format.]*

*Wooden Envelope Label:*
Your servant petitions for the establishment of the Yellow Register Great Retreat at [Place], requesting the descent of officers and envoys to proclaim and summon. We await your august decree.

We have followed the *Fengdu Release-from-Sin Memorial* and the *Petition to Open the Way*, both of which take universal deliverance as their aim. Though the retreat officials may offer prayers for a single individual, the benefit naturally extends to all souls in the hidden realms. Moreover, the hells are too numerous to describe in full, and the instruments of interrogation too many to recount.

Thus the Master of Vast Accomplishment said: “Hells are so named because they are prisons beneath the earth. Yet the examination and judgment of sinful souls may also occur in the yin palaces within cities and settlements—these too are called hells.” The *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Conditions* states: “For yang sins and yang transgressions, worldly officials judge them; for yin sins and yin transgressions, the dark officials preside.” It speaks of thirty-six hells. The *Scripture of Immortal Precepts* mentions eighteen hells, the *Orthodox Unity Scripture* eight great earthly hells, and the *Sutra of Conditions* twenty-four hells under the Three Officials of Fengdu. The accounts in the various scriptures are thus too vast to exhaust.

What the scriptures leave unspoken knows no bounds. As for instruments of torment—golden hammers and iron staves, forests of swords and mountains of blades, cauldrons of boiling oil and searing coals, fire chariots and pits of filth—these too are but briefly sketched in the scriptures to evoke their dreadful aspect, that they may warn the world and deter men from sin. Yet in the *Chapter on Expiating Sins*, it is said that copper pillars and iron beds, once tools of torment, become instruments of precious transformation, and cauldrons of boiling oil and furnaces of fire become lamps of cool radiance. To enumerate the torments of hell in full would be endless, and in the end would only narrow their meaning.

For instance, in the *Chapter on Opening the Road*, to list the names of the Great and Lesser Iron Enclosures, the Hell of Unrelenting Torment, and others would be overly restrictive. The names of hells are too numerous to know in full. Thus, in the *Chapter on Right Conduct and Judging Sins*, the text merely speaks of confronting accusations, balancing accounts, and reconciling enmities, without recounting the forms of each infernal instrument. In the *Chapter on Opening the Road*, it broadly refers to the palaces and caverns of Fengdu and the boundless hells, without exhaustively naming each one. In this way, the words remain concise while their meaning deepens, the phrasing spare while its scope widens. For in the art of exposition, one cannot exhaust all things in sequence.

The realms of the hidden and the dark are too numerous to name exhaustively. Thus, by employing general terms to encompass all matters, every place where hells exist is embraced by imperial grace, and all who suffer the torments of infernal instruments receive mysterious pardon. Why must one specify each name to dissolve their sins or define each location to amplify the merit of the fast? If the Supreme Lord extends compassion, none shall remain beyond deliverance. Scholars must therefore broaden their minds and not cling to the shallow and narrow. This is the foremost principle in the study of the Dao—petty and constricted minds cannot embody the expansive spirit that liberates heaven and humanity.

**Chapter on Ritual Ablution and Refinement for Deliverance**
*From the Register of the Orthodox Numinous Treasure’s Dharma Ranks*
Your humble servant, [Name], prostrates in awe and reverence, bowing twice with head touching the ground, respectfully submits:

I have heard that when form and spirit temporarily dissolve, the entanglements of worldly dust still cling. When the hun-soul and consciousness scatter and wander, the root of the numinous remains unrecovered. Without refinement, how can rebirth be attained? Thus, I knock upon the gates of heaven to express my mortal sincerity.

Your servant, acting on behalf of the household of [Official Rank, Name] of [Prefecture, Subprefecture, County, Place], humbly petitions to perform the rites for the deliverance of the departed soul, guiding it to ascend to the realm of the Dao. With utmost reverence and rightful cause, I shall lead the ritual current, establishing the altar on [date] and conducting the *Great Fast of the Supreme Yellow Register* for [number] days and nights. Through reciting scriptures, circumambulating the Dao, repenting before the perfected, and invoking the descent of talismans, I shall summon the soul for deliverance, universally extending salvation to the stagnant spirits of the Three Paths and the myriad kinds of hidden souls. May all bathe in the divine nectar, melting away the dust and filth; may they return to the transformation of the Dao, reintegrating with yin and yang.

For this purpose, I respectfully invite:
- Five *Ling Tongzi* (Numinous Youths) from each of the Five Directions, totaling twenty-five;
- One hundred twenty *Jie Hui* officials, generals, and soldiers;
- One *Huan Zhuo Furen* (Lady of Ablution) and one *Huang Hua Yu Nü* (Jade Maiden of Yellow Splendor).

May they descend at once to draw the *Yellow Splendor Divine Water*, refine the *Plain Essence of the Corpse*, the *Numinous Fat Jade Liquor*, the *Sweet Dew Golden Nectar*, and infuse them into the fragrant bath. Thus shall the delivered souls and hidden spirits be cleansed of yin impurities, washed of worldly toils, purging both inner and outer roots of karmic debt, dissolving the filth of heat and affliction.

Then, the Five Directional Youths shall:
- Invoke the *True Qi* of the *Azure Numinous First Elder* of the East, feeding them the *Nine Qi Azure Nectar*;
- Invoke the *True Qi* of the *Cinnabar Numinous True Elder* of the South, feeding them the *Three Qi Cinnabar Splendor*;
- Invoke the *True Qi* of the *Luminous Numinous August Elder* of the West, feeding them the *Seven Qi Plain Essence*;
- Invoke the *True Qi* of the *Five Numinous Mystic Elder* of the North, feeding them the *Five Qi Mystic Spring*;
- Invoke the *True Qi* of the *Primal Numinous Primal Elder* of the Center, feeding them the *One Qi Yellow Splendor*.

Thus shall all refined souls receive this nourishment, stabilizing their hun and po, and naturally generating the Five Spirits.

I further invoke the *Hundred-Forged, Thousand-Harmonized Jade Liquid*, the *Flowing Light of Venus*, and the *Primal August Scattered Nectar* to dispel stagnation, purge impurities, refine body and mind, and illuminate wisdom.

Additionally, I beseech the *Orthodox Qi of Yin and Yang*, the *Numinous Nectar of Metal and Wood*, to descend from the *Cinnabar Heaven Realm*, the *Vermilion Mound Fire Palace*, and the *Southern Prosperity Upper Palace*. May the *Refinement and Deliverance* officials, lords, generals, and soldiers descend to the altar, refining and delivering the departed souls, awakening their original nature. May their form and spirit be restored, reborn in the land of blessings, forever sheltered under the Dao’s shade.

With utmost reverence, I humbly implore the Supreme’s discerning mercy.

Your servant respectfully concludes.

[Seal] *Void Practice*. The closing follows the previous format. Any omissions in the square envelope shall adhere to the prior model.

---

I have further heard: when a person lives, flesh and blood form the body, and the circulation of *ying* and *wei* qi brings illness and pain. As the *Daode Jing* states: *"My greatest affliction is that I have a body."* For the body is the burden of the spirit. The *Book of Transformations* by Song Qiqiu of recent times says: *"Time itself harms me not, yet sinews and bones do; I feel no pain, yet blood and flesh cause it."* These words nearly grasp the Dao.

Once the spirit departs, the hundred bones become mere rotting earth. Where then are the former wounds of limbs, the ailments of heart and belly? Yet if the singular spirit lingers—whether bound by karmic confrontation or sunk in delusion—it may suffer endless rebirth. But if its original nature is awakened, deliverance follows in due course.

Thus, the Supreme’s intent in establishing rituals and the purpose of fasts lie in building merit through scripture recitation and Dao-circumambulation, illuminating the obscure and awakening the lost. The *Chapter on Ritual Ablution and Refinement for Deliverance* addresses the soul’s passage through the *Great Yin*, where it is ensnared in the net of sins. First, its dust and filth must be purged; then, its spirit and consciousness gathered, temporarily reuniting yin and yang to reestablish its foundation and return to the human path. Initially human, it became a ghost; through the deliverance of the Supreme Mystery, its spirit is reassembled, and the ghost becomes human again. At the moment of rebirth, it receives the *Decree of the Celestial Lord*, the *Nine Qi Generating Spirits*, and a renewed body.

Yet one fears the fast’s merit may not reach heaven, and the *Two Qi* may not descend upon the departed soul. If, as in older ritual texts, one requests divine physicians and celestial medicines to heal past illnesses or mend broken bones, this strays far from the Dao. Not only does the human form perish while the spirit endures, but the *Orthodox Qi of Heaven and Earth and Yin and Yang* refines and transforms the departed soul, restoring it to life. Why then worry that its spirit suffers incurable afflictions?

Thus, following the transmission of my late master, I dare not conform to the vulgar or transcend the world. Should the teachings differ, I shall adhere to my master’s method.

Thus, with due reverence, I dare not overstep.

**Memorial for Ascending and Delivering the Departed Soul**
*By [Rank] [Surname] [Given Name], Servant of the Registers of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure Methods, with awe and trembling, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses:*

I have heard that the boundless grace of the teachings lifts those mired in stagnation to higher realms, and the infinite merit of the fast delivers the shades of the underworld to transcendence. May You deign to take note and, in the end, bestow Your compassionate mercy.

I, in accordance with the residence of [Official Title] [Surname] [Given Name] and their household at [Prefecture] [Subprefecture] [County] [Place], have reverently undertaken the grand fast of the *Yellow Register* of the Most High, lasting [number] days and nights, to offer prayers for the departed soul and guide it to ascend to the immortal realms.

Having followed the ritual instructions and conducted the rites as prescribed, I have performed the ceremony for delivering the bound and offering souls, the sacrificial refinement of the departed’s original lineage, and the salvation of the nine dark and stagnant shades. By the power of the Dao and the grace of Heaven, I now humbly invoke:

The Lords of the Southern Palace—
the *Lord of Life Mandates*,
the *Lord of Records*,
the *Lord of Longevity*,
the *Lord of Augmented Destiny*,
the *Lord of Deliverance from Calamity*,
and the *Lord of Ascension*—
each one, to ascend and deliver the departed soul, raise it to the Southern Palace, inscribe its destiny upon the jade tablets, and record its name in golden script.

I further invoke:
the *Great Divine Marshal Sima*,
the *Holy Mother of the Protective Chamber*,
and the *Youth of Cavernous Yang*,
to refine the departed soul’s jade-like eyes and temper its form, purify its body with yellow blossoms, inscribe its living name upon the purple registers, and accord it rank in the vermilion palace. May it, ever dependent on Your sheltering care, forever attain carefree wandering.

In profound reverence, I beseech the Most High to distinguish and heed my plea.

I respectfully conclude.

*[Blank space for ritual closure.]*
The dimensions of the memorial envelope may be adjusted as needed, following the previous format.

According to *The Essentials of the Orthodox Unity*, when submitting memorials in the twelve months, the names of the Most High’s palaces are specified, and for daily submissions, the names of the palace bureaus are given. This pertains to the regulations of the Orthodox Unity tradition, to be observed accordingly.

However, this memorial’s method belongs to the *Cavernous Mystery* rank and is found in the upper scriptures, differing in origin from the Orthodox Unity. It is thus termed the *Upper Clarity Ritual Form*, though it incorporates Orthodox Unity memorials. In the past, there have been instances where palace bureaus were not used. While *The Definitive Collection of Daoist Regulations* now stipulates their inclusion, such usage is not deeply appropriate. Moreover, for disciples of the Numinous Treasure, submitting memorials to the *Lord of the Dao of the Most High* has always been directed to the Three Heavenly Bureaus alone.

Having repeatedly presented such memorials before and after, and having received numinous responses, I dare to compile and continue this text—not out of personal inexperience or to mislead the world. Let scholars examine this carefully.

**Memorial Envelope:**
Length: one foot, two inches, and eight fen; width: two inches and eight fen, measured by the ancient ruler. Made of yellow silk, sealed in a bag, and wrapped in a yellow gauze cloth.

**Memorial Tablet:**
Shaped like an incense table, with curved legs, draped in a yellow gauze cover on all sides.

**Writing the Memorial:**
Conducted in a quiet chamber, with no one passing through.

Before the appointed time, sweep and purify the space. At the moment of the ritual, use the *Fu of Dispelling Filth*, fumigate with vinegar and charcoal. Those who are to inscribe memorials, petitions, or documents must first bathe, change into fresh garments, and enter the chamber to write all required texts.

Each line shall contain seventeen characters, with eight fen of space above and a continuous "ant-trail" margin below. (One account holds that the "ant-trail" should not be continuous, but if the characters are too close to the lower edge of the paper, strokes may be lost—thus, a continuous "ant-trail" is proper.) Each line shall be one cun and two fen in width; the paper shall be one chi and two cun in height. From beginning to end, the number of lines must be odd. Leave two blank lines before the *Fǎwèi* (Ritual Position). The *Fǎwèi* through the phrase "prostrate twice" shall occupy a single line. The phrase "the above words" shall be aligned with the preceding line’s indentation.

The characters *chén* (臣, "your servant") and personal names, as well as the characters *guǐ* (鬼, "ghost") and *sǐ* (死, "death"), must not appear at the beginning of a line. The character *shēng* (生, "life") must not hang at the end of a line. Cover the table with a clean cloth before writing. Leave three blank lines after the date and month; if the text is lengthy, continue on additional sheets. Immediately burn any leftover paper scraps—do not let them scatter onto the bed, mat, or floor.

Use only new and clean brushes and ink; do not mix them with others. Characters connoting misfortune or impurity must not appear at the beginning of a line but should be placed in the middle, concealed from view. No women, Buddhist monks or nuns, chickens, dogs, cats, or other animals may enter the chamber where the memorial is written. While writing, one must not speak or cause disorder. Do not leave the chamber before completing the text. Do not set down the brush before finishing a character. When dotting the brush, face the memorial—do not read aloud. The phrase "I have heard" shall be written with the characters *wén dī* (闻低) aligned with the preceding line. The phrase "reporting below, your servant" shall be followed by three blank lines.

The servant’s surname shall be indented two cun and four fen. Before the *Fǎwèi*, no surname is written; at the point of the servant’s surname, it shall be introduced as "the servant, surnamed..."—for example, "the servant, surnamed [X], residing in [Y] jurisdiction, at [Z] hermitage, engaged in purification rites," and the like. Since the surname is absent at the beginning of the memorial and only the servant’s name is used within, it is here, in the concluding section, that the surname is declared—lest the document end without it. Those who write the servant’s full name here err against the proper form.

As recorded in the memorial template previously transmitted by my late master, High Master Gao: "The servant, surnamed Gao, of Huizhou Prefecture, Qimen County, at Ziyuan Hermitage, engaged in purification rites"—this does not pertain to my own lineage, but may be followed as convenient.

Leave three blank lines after the servant’s surname, and three blank lines after the *Sacred Position of the Most High*. Conclude with the date and month. Memorials must be written without interruption across days; filling in "Your Majesty" must not be delayed. When submitting the memorial, face east by day and north by night.

A standard memorial sheet shall have seventeen lines, each containing seventeen characters. Only the *Yellow Silk Vermilion Memorial* allows twenty-four characters per line; otherwise, follow the standard form. By ancient rule, the sixty *jiǎzǐ* spirits are not to be included in the memorial.

When writing, place paper beneath the hand to prevent sleeves from brushing the text. Grind ink with forty-nine leftward turns of the inkstone. Do not lick the brush, nor exhale breath onto the memorial. By proper method, one should hold fragrant water in the mouth, burn incense, and face north while writing. Those inscribing memorials must not tread upon impurity. If one has encountered birth, death, or defiling pollution, another must be chosen for the task.

The paper must not be torn; characters must not lack strokes. In summer, one must not write while lightly clad or bare-bodied. Do not lean on the table while writing, nor pick at or smear corrections. Once written, do not allow others to read the text, nor place it where people pass by.

The *Sacred Position of the Most High* shall be written in a single, meticulously aligned line—do not constrain it by fixed measurements. The ancient rule of three cun in length, if insufficient to accommodate the content, may result in disorder. The characters *Bìxià* (陛下, "Your Majesty") shall not be written in small script; only careful, standard calligraphy is valued.

When presenting the memorial, place a copy before the throne while the original is displayed. Set the brush to the right of the *Sacred Position* and the dragon-headed writing knife to the left. The ritual master shall kneel before the altar, dispatch the memorial, then pass it over the incense. Roll it tightly, seal it within the envelope, recite the *Opening the Envelope Incantation*, place it inside, add a piece of *chenxiang* (agarwood), and bind it with three passes of green silk thread. Formerly, a wax seal was used—though solid wax is impure.

Now, only paste adhesive is used, sealing where the thread binds the envelope. Next, place it into the outer case.

Hand it to the attendant incense master, who shall reverently carry and uphold it according to the prescribed form.

**Memorial Offerings and Ritual Colors:**
The Son of Heaven uses bolts of silk by the *pi* measure; nobles and marquises use bolts by the *zhang* measure; commoners use forty-nine *chi*.

**Offerings:**
- Cash: twelve thousand *wen*
- Salary rice: one *shi* and two *dou*
- Oil: one *dou* and two *sheng*
- Incense: five *liang*
- Paper: one hundred sheets
- Brushes: two large, three small
- Ink: three sticks
- Inkstones: two
- Golden fish: one
- Jade wild goose: one
- Dragon-headed writing knife: one, six *cun* in length, with a blade of copper or iron and a dragon head of half a *liang* of silver
- Salt: one *jin*
- Fermented beans: one *jin*
- Firewood: fifty *jin*
- Charcoal: fifty *jin*
- Ritual towels: two
- Life talismans: one for each year of age

**Ritual Formula:**
"In presenting the memorial with its full offerings, one bears witness to the sincerity of the heart. If the heart seeks merit and virtue yet begrudges wealth and goods, the divine spirits shall not accept it. Should the supplicant be a reclusive scholar or a destitute household, the master shall provide on their behalf."

**Yellow Silk Vermilion Memorial**
From the *Ordinances of the Master of Vast Accomplishment*, each line of the full text contains twenty-four characters. The memorial is presented without a Pass.

[Ritual rank and titles of the officiant are fully set forth.]
Your servant [Name], with utmost reverence, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the Most High, Boundless, Supreme Dao, Perfectly Real, and Spontaneously Self-So, the Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures and Jade Palace:

We, Your servants, base and foolish, have presumptuously partaken in the Great Dharma. Our merits are but specks of dust and dew, while our transgressions weigh like mountains. Overwhelmed with shame, body and soul are at a loss. With utmost reverence, we prostrate and bow twice.

We, Your servants, truly humble and insignificant, have fortunately relied upon past blessings. We have encountered the wondrous transformation and rejoice in this undeserved favor. Though unworthy of the Mysterious Office, we are charged with the duty of salvation. Though our nature is dull and our learning dim, we pledge our sincere devotion and uphold the wondrous teachings. Seeing righteousness, we think of courage, and day and night, our hearts are earnest. Given the circumstances, how dare we not make this known?

Now, residing at [Place] in [County], [Prefecture], [Province], the Daoist official [Surname] [Name], having listed their name, prostrates and presents this memorial.

We have heard that the Supreme Orthodox Dharma, the Great Register of the Yellow Register Retreat, dissolves the sins of past lives and the present existence—those of the heart, mouth, and intent. It benefits the Emperor above and all beings below, safeguarding the nation and the household, averting disasters and harm, augmenting blessings and longevity, resolving transgressions and faults, delivering the Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations, and all departed spirits. It saves and delivers both the living and the dead, bestowing universal grace.

We respectfully offer the Ten Directions’ Golden Dragon Pledges, the life-thread silk, incense, flowers, oil, and candles—all requisite offerings—to attest our sincere hearts and present this memorial.

Through our practice of the Dao, repentance, and confession of past transgressions, we sever calamities and misfortunes, accumulate merit, and deliver the deceased [Name], enabling their ascension to the Dao’s realm. Our words are sincere and earnest; the principle demands this presentation.

We reverently lead a single altar of Daoists, strictly following the *Yellow Register Simplified Text of the Lower Primordial*, the ranks of the numinous immortals, and the chosen [Place] to establish the altar and enact the Mysterious Ordinance’s form, modeling Heaven and Earth. With the gold dragons and silk banners we have brought, we consecrate the Ten Directions, beseeching Heaven and invoking the mandate to save and deliver both the living and the dead. Together, we exhort and encourage one another, purifying our hearts and striving in devotion, surrendering to the Perfectly Real.

Our prayers and wishes are to conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Great Retreat for [Number] days and nights, with nine daily audiences and ten recitations of the scriptures. Beginning on [Day], the retreat is established and the rites commence. Concluding on [Day], we perform the gratitude-offering Pure Offering, encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine positions.

We reverently report the merits and dissolve the altar, casting the dragon into the mountains and waters, and presenting the cinnabar-written memorials to the numinous altar. We prostrate and present this memorial to the Nine Heavens, humbly beseeching the Most High, Boundless, Supreme Dao, the Primordial Celestial Honored One; the Supreme Dao Lord; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Elder; the Supreme Mysterious Elder; the Ten Directions’ Spontaneously Self-So Numinous Treasure Celestial Honored Ones; the perfected great sages who have attained the Dao; the perfected lords and elders; the Celestial Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors; the Heavenly Master Lords; and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center.

May You deign to examine our memorial and take pity on our sincere hearts. As above, we beseech You to command the officials to proclaim to the Ten Directions’ Five Elder Thearchs, the True Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the true spirits of the Ten Realms. Deliver the deceased [Name] and their Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations, whether karmically connected or not, treating enemies and kin equally, and all departed souls. Enable them to emerge from the eternal night and the Nine Dark Realms, ascending to the Southern Palace. Clothe their dry bones, restore their decayed forms to bloom, end the cycle of rebirth, and transform them into the gate of blessings. In their resting places, protect their corporeal forms, restore their spirits, and reunite them with the light and the dark.

For the retreat sponsor [Name], may all sins of past and present lives be eradicated, grievances resolved, calamities averted, disasters dispelled, life prolonged, and destiny preserved. May the living and the dead flourish, and their kin enjoy peace. We pray that the Seven Luminaries shine brightly, the Two Modes endure, the Six Harmonies remain pure, the imperial reign be prolonged, yin and yang harmonize, the Nine Grains yield abundance, pestilence be forever banished, auspicious signs daily increase, the nation prosper, the people be at peace, and the world attain great tranquility. May we eternally encounter the Dao’s grace and preserve primordial auspiciousness.

We reverently dispatch the celestial immortals’ troops and horses, the perfected immortals’ troops and horses, the earthly immortals’ troops and horses, the sun and moon’s troops and horses, the stellar constellations’ troops and horses, the Five Thearchs’ troops and horses, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ troops and horses, and the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways’ troops and horses—each numbering nine hundred million ten thousand chariots.

Within our bodies, each of us bears the registers of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the true immortal officers and attendants of the Dharma, the numinous treasure officials, the overseers of the retreat, the Three-Five Merit Clerks, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Incense-Attending Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks for transmitting memorials, the Flying Memorial Officers, the assembled officers, generals, and clerks of the memorial, the Talisman Envoys for descending the true and summoning the numinous, the Lads for descending the true and summoning the numinous, the Direct Envoys of the Most High, the Direct Envoys of the Three Realms, the Scarlet Dragon and Golden Dragon Post Officers of the Mysterious Capital, the Great General of the White Horse and Plain Chariot, the officers, generals, and clerks, the Bathing and Purification Officers, the Refining and Deliverance Palace Generals of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Divine Tiger Summoning Officers, the Jade Maiden Spirit Soldiers, the various departments of the Orthodox Dharma, the officers and clerks jointly pursuing souls and capturing spirits, the City Gods and Earth Rectors, the House-Protecting Generals, the local earth gods, the true officials and deities of the neighborhood, the deities and spirits of the Three Realms, the altar-monitoring divine generals, and all those overseeing, protecting, transmitting commands, and safeguarding the retreat. May those who have diligently performed their duties be fully adorned.

Following this memorial, may it ascend to the Mystic Capital, where merits shall be enumerated and rewards bestowed. Upon audience at the Immortal Palace, may ranks of the Perfected be advanced, noble titles elevated, and appointments made according to grade—high and low alike—all to be promoted in accordance with the rites of the Great Perfected.

We, Your servants, have yet to master the Daoist arts in full; in our reverence and humility, we have erred in deportment and transgressed against the statutes, failing to conform to ritual propriety. We fear reproach from the Four Offices, punishment from the Five Emperors, and the accumulation of myriad faults and sins. We humbly beseech Your pardon, that through compassion for our ignorance, we may be spared from condemnation and penalty.

The true officials within the five constituents of our bodies, having fulfilled their duties, shall each return to their respective palaces within us. May we, Your servants, through the study of the Dao attain the Dao, through the pursuit of immortality achieve immortality, and forever become Perfected Ones, radiant as the Three Luminaries, enduring with the Five Qi.

We implore the Most High and the assembled Venerables to discern and show mercy.

Your servants respectfully entrust this memorial to the Flying Immortal Direct Envoys of the Two Offices, the Merit Registrars of the Three and Five, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Clerks, the Vermilion Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Just Wind Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Memorial Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, and the Heavenly Immortal Riders—twenty-four of each. Bearing this memorial, may they ascend to the Three Heavenly Courts of the Most High and await the decree.

We, [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bow our heads to the ground, prostrate ourselves, and bow again to make this known.

Your servant, of the [Surname] clan, residing in [State] at [Location], hereby conducts this offering through incense and refinement.

In the year [Year], the [Month] month, the [Day] day, at the [Hour] hour, this memorial is respectfully presented at the altar of the retreat.

---

This vermilion memorial, in accordance with the teachings of Master Guangcheng, is to be inscribed on six *chi* of fine, well-woven yellow silk, using the final width. Red borders shall be drawn, and the text written in vermilion, with twenty-four characters per line. The first line shall contain the name and title, continuing through the "bow again" to the end of the line. The phrase "make this known" shall occupy a line by itself, centered.

No character denoting "life" may appear at the end of a line, nor may "ghost" or "death" occupy the beginning of a line. No line may end with a truncated personal name, nor may the character for "servant" (*chen*) begin a line. The format of memorials must be strictly observed, with no crossing out, smearing, interpolations, or damage that mars the text. Precision is paramount. Even in worldly memorials, meticulous calligraphy is required—how much more so when addressing the Heavenly Perfected? Failure to adhere to these standards risks divine censure, the memorial’s failure to reach its destination, or even the incurrence of fault. How then could resonance with the Most High be achieved?

The presiding Dharma Master shall personally inscribe the memorial, completing it within twenty-four sections. In ancient times, silk was ruled with lines for writing, a practice still observed by elder Dharma Masters who uphold the old methods. Modern silk, being thinner, may require backing with paper to prevent ink bleed. My late teacher used thick, pristine yellow paper for ease, which is equally suitable. While silk adheres to ancient tradition, its fibers may produce residual *qi* when burned, and the ruled lines become indistinct. This memorial, however, is accompanied by the officers, generals, and clerks as it ascends to the Heavenly Court, so no additional documents are required—it is presented directly during the dispersal rites at the altar.

Yet many in the world blindly follow Master Guangcheng’s template for the yellow silk memorial. They fail to recognize that in ancient times, grand retreats were conducted with the primary intent of praying for the sovereign’s well-being and the nation’s prosperity, followed by personal blessings, then broad salvation, and finally deliverance for the deceased. The memorial’s intent was thus coherent from beginning to end, making the template appropriate. In modern retreats, however, prayers for peace focus solely on the individual, neglecting the nation’s welfare. Memorials for the deceased fixate on the departed, ignoring universal salvation. High-ranking Dharma Masters, catering to the retreat sponsor’s wishes, obsess over ensuring the sponsor receives the full benefits, lest they be diminished. Thus, the five yellow registers of the *Huanglu* retreat now entirely omit prayers for the sovereign and the nation, and the emphasis on universal salvation has waned. To then employ Master Guangcheng’s format for the vermilion memorial creates a stark contradiction with the preceding five registers—is this not deceiving Heaven?

The memorials I have composed retain the ancient intent, making this vermilion memorial compatible. If, however, one uses only contemporary memorials, pandering to the sponsor’s desires, this vermilion memorial is wholly unsuitable.

Moreover, Dharma Masters today lack concern for all beings. During retreats, they tremble with anxiety, fearful of even the slightest displeasure from the sponsor, lest they forfeit future commissions. They flatter incessantly, never daring to voice dissent. How then could they discern right from wrong or expound upon the orthodox canon?

In ancient times, those who sponsored retreats dispersed wealth and treasures to broadly aid the departed in the netherworld. First, this dissolved their own miserliness; second, it honored the sovereign, delivered the nine generations of ancestors, and extended blessings to the common people, universally benefiting the realm; third, it broadly salvaged the beings of the Five Paths, Four Births, Three Realms, and Ten Classes, even encompassing birds, beasts, grasses, and trees within the retreat’s grace. Through such means, one safeguards family and self, ensuring boundless fortune and longevity. Through such means, one delivers ancestors and the deceased, enabling their transcendence. If retreat sponsors were to heed my humble words, they might expand their benevolence.

Alas, those who preside over retreats today, when facing sponsors, are so preoccupied with flattery that they dare not broach this subject. In my ordinary capacity, I have conducted retreats and offerings in accordance with these principles, and sponsors have never insisted on their private agendas. If fellow practitioners could likewise uphold integrity and dignity for the sake of the Daoist tradition, rather than being constrained by meager offerings or compelled to bow and scrape, it would be a blessing for our tradition.

Ultimately, the gain or loss of wealth is determined by one’s karmic destiny.

Poverty and wealth, lowliness and eminence—each has its destined portion. To seek the crooked as though it were straight, or to employ flattery in pursuit of favor, is truly in vain.

**Petition for Salvation from Suffering**
The Daoist official of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Register, your subject [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this petition.

On the [day] of this month, your subject has, on behalf of [Name] of [Prefecture, Subprefecture, County, Location], established an unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights, to deliver and uplift the deceased [Name] and the souls of the male and female ancestors thus invoked. A grand offering of sustenance has also been set forth to universally deliver all lonely and wandering spirits.

Your subject has heard that the ceaseless revolving of the great transformation arises from its inherent conditions, and that boundless salvation stems from the vast vow of compassion. Relying upon the numinous grace of the Dao, your subject ventures to lay bare his humble devotion.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground and prostrates himself.

Your subject humbly reflects that the great transition of life and death is inescapable, for all things must have a beginning and an end. The karmic consequences of good and evil determine whether one ascends or descends. Moreover, after the body has passed through the Great Yin, the soul abides in the endless night, forever cut off from the light of the sun, silently trapped in the netherworld, unable to transcend the dark prisons. It is only through the compassionate teachings of the Divine Master that the sunken souls of the black earth may be universally uplifted.

Yet your subject, lacking in profound understanding of the ultimate truth, is ashamed of his ignorance. Though unworthily occupying the office of ritual proclamation, he has vowed to exhaust his efforts in the work of salvation. Thus, he records his sincere prayers, beseeching deliverance. He reverently invokes the **Celestial Worthy of Compassion and Salvation of the Eastern Peak, Supreme One of the Azure Palace**, Sovereign of the Heavens.

Your Majesty’s Dao is as all-embracing as heaven and earth, and your grace extends to both the living and the dead. You open the gate of the utmost truth to guide and receive, and expound the teachings of great transformation to nurture and perfect. Your radiant majesty permeates all, bringing purity and peace to the nine lands. Your divine blessings spread throughout the ten directions, illuminating all with prosperity and harmony.

Your subject humbly implores that your mercy flow into the Fengdu underworld, bestowing protection upon the Yellow Springs. May you dispatch the flying celestial deities and specially command the Salvation Lads to descend with the talismanic decree of the Nine Dragons, unlocking the six gates of the netherworld. May all the lonely spirits of the ten thousand kinds, and the stagnant souls of the three evil paths, receive your extraordinary favor and together ascend to the immortal realms. May the souls thus invoked and delivered be freed from the obstacles of their many lives, refined and transformed, and forever attain carefree wandering.

With this petition, your subject respectfully submits his plea.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully concludes.

In the year [Year], the [Month] of the [Cyclical Year], your subject [Name], in his humble capacity, respectfully submits this petition.

**Petition for the Refinement and Deliverance of Souls through the Orthodox Yin-Yang Qi**
The Daoist official of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Register, your subject [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this petition.

On the [day] of this month, your subject has, on behalf of the faithful official [Name] of [Prefecture, Subprefecture, Location], established an unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat. On the night of [day], he will refine and deliver the souls present at the assembly, universally saving all lonely spirits and the ten thousand kinds of the three evil paths. On the night of [day], he will refine the soul of [Name].

Your subject has heard that the root of life is bestowed by destiny, and form arises from the differentiation of qi. To lose this root and stray from the truth is to invite calamity and retribution. To escape the realms of suffering, one must rely upon meritorious deeds. Thus, your subject ventures to present his urgent plea, daring to intrude upon the lofty hearing of the heavens.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground and prostrates himself.

Your subject earnestly considers that when the body is destroyed, the spirit departs, and the soul scatters while the po sinks. Having passed through the Great Yin, they are entangled in the net of suffering. Without the orthodox qi of the perfected truth, the spirits of the dark and obscure cannot be uplifted. Your subject, though of mediocre talent, has unworthily assumed the leading office. Fearing his lack of mastery over the profound mysteries, he truly despairs of achieving spiritual resonance.

Now, the faithful official [Name] and all the assembled officials, soldiers, and common people have reverently prepared the sacred space, respectfully opened the ritual platform, prayed to heaven and earth, arranged the images, and performed the rites. They have laid bare their grieving hearts and poured forth their sincere devotion.

Your subject reflects that the stagnant souls of the nine springs do not awaken to the original source of their single nature. Relying upon this humble cause, he seeks to illuminate their past lives.

He reverently invokes the **Golden Mother of the Nine Numina, Supreme Perfected of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace**, and the **Jade Sovereign of the Eastern Flower, Lord of the Azure Lad, Prime Minister of the Wooden Duke**.

You are the ancestors of the Two Qi and the origin of the ten thousand beings. You established the ultimate in the primordial heavens, bestowing blessings and nurturing all things, delivering and saving according to the needs of each. Moved by compassion, you respond to the cries of suffering.

Your subject humbly implores that you extend your vast mercy and broadly bestow your great grace. May the souls, spirits, and consciousnesses receive the divine radiance of metal and wood. May their original root and source fully recover the orthodox nature of yin and yang. May the nine netherworlds cease their trials, and may the ten thousand kinds receive your favor.

Overwhelmed by the urgency of his plea, your subject respectfully submits this petition.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully concludes.

In the year [Year], the [Month] of the [Cyclical Year], your subject [Name], in his humble capacity, respectfully submits this petition.

**Petition to the Nine Heavens Sovereign**
The Daoist official of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Register, your subject [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this petition.

On the [day] of this month, your subject has, on behalf of [Official Title and Name] of [Prefecture, Subprefecture, Location], established an unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights, to deliver and uplift the distant ancestors of [Name] and all others, enabling them to together ascend to the realms of goodness. He universally delivers the ten thousand kinds of the nine provinces and all lonely spirits. On the night of [day], he will refine and deliver the souls present at the assembly, the male and female souls thus invoked, and the principal soul of [Name].

Your subject has heard that when the primordial unity first began, the two images congealed and divided the numinous. The nine luminaries took form, enabling the ten thousand beings to receive their destinies. Without returning to the root and reverting to the source, how could one recover their nature and gather the true?

Daring to presume upon the celestial statutes, your subject respectfully submits his humble plea. He knows he has overstepped his bounds and is truly filled with trepidation.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground and prostrates himself.

Your subject reflects that he is but a dusty and mediocre talent, dull and ignorant. Unversed in the rhythms of qi, he has presumptuously assumed the numinous office of salvation. Unfamiliar with the canonical rites, he has rashly taken up the leading role in the sacred altar. He recalls that when humans die, they become ghosts, and only through refinement can they begin the journey back to life.

Only through smelting and refinement can ghosts be delivered and restored to human form. Without the alchemy of transformation, how could they receive their new substance? As wood shines and metal gleams, so too does the work of harmonizing qi bring forth radiance. When yin reaches its extreme and yang returns, one must rely on the shelter of the life-generating spirits.

With utmost reverence, we turn to the August Emperor of the Nine Heavens. Above, You uphold the Three Realms, loftily enthroned in the layered skies. Through non-action, the myriad beings flourish of themselves; without speech, the ten directions are pervaded by Your grace. Moved by compassion for those sunk in suffering, You specially bestow the blessings of nurturance. You spread the life-essence across the nine limits, completing the ten-month gestation. You grant the purest qi of the Five Phases, so that the body becomes replete with the hundred spirits. Bending down, You rescue the yin souls and swiftly elevate them to the yang realms. Those trapped in the three paths, their spectral forms stagnant, are all relieved of their penal labors. The orphaned souls of the ten thousand kinds alike attain the joy of renewed life.

Your subject, overwhelmed with gratitude and urgency, respectfully presents this memorial for Your august perusal. With utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject bows his head to the ground and prostrates himself, again bowing to offer these words.

In the year... month... day, your subject [Name], holding such-and-such office, respectfully submits this memorial.

Yunzhong has observed that the format of memorials is an ancient institution, its origins long established. The five chapters now compiled for use in the Yellow Register Retreat also follow ancient rites. The invocatory phrases therein still adhere to the transmission of the masters. The vermilion memorials for the dispersed altars follow the style of Master Guangcheng, with only minor additions of the divine officials and generals invoked in the ritual. As for presenting memorials before the Celestial Emperor, this practice arose in middle antiquity and became a secular convention, thus it is fitting to adhere to the ceremonial forms of both ancient and modern courts.

The *Memorial for Salvation through Refinement*, the *Memorial for the Refinement and Deliverance of Souls*, and the *Memorial to the Nine Celestial Emperors* compiled by Yunzhong all follow the masters’ instructions, though the wording is presumptuously composed by Yunzhong himself. He does not dare claim it is entirely appropriate, but only that it does not contradict the *Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Refinement and Deliverance* texts in practice. Those of lofty attainment may replace it with more majestic prose, provided it does not violate the ritual canons—this too would be excellent.

The Nine Celestial Emperors are addressed in nine separate memorials, which is particularly thorough, though each must be presented individually. Arranging them according to the sequence of the nine qi would be ideal. Yunzhong, lacking talent, cannot fully accomplish this task; he must await later scholars to perfect this model for posterity.

**Green Petitions**
For the Yellow Register Grand Retreat, seven petitions are required for the dedicated altar rites:
1. Jade Clarity,
2. Highest Clarity,
3. Supreme Clarity—these three pertain to the Great Dao.
Next are:
4. Wu Heaven,
5. Northern Culmen,
6. Celestial Sovereign—these correspond to the Three Qi and govern the heavens.
7. Earth Only—this is the consort of Wu Heaven.

Herein lies the utmost reverence and supremacy. For smaller-scale retreat and jiao rites not dedicated to a specific altar, one may follow the chapter format and address the ranks of the Great Dao.

Additionally, in Yellow Register retreats and jiao rites, there are petitions to the Great Emperor of the Southern Culmen and the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation, each with their own conventions. Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, following the masters’ transmissions, court Green Petitions have listed the sacred ranks, a practice continued in the Song dynasty. Below is a Green Petition from an inner court jiao during the Jingde era of Emperor Zhenzong’s reign, preserved for reference, along with contemporary formats.

**Green Petition from the Inner Court Jiao of Emperor Zhenzong**
On the day of [Year], in the cyclical year [X] of the reign [Y], the [X] month, the [X] day of the new moon, the [X] cyclical day, the Filial Son and Heavenly Sovereign, Your Subject [Name], respectfully dispatches the Inner Palace Attendant [Name] to bow in proxy at the Chaoyuan Hall of the Great Inner Palace, inaugurating the Yellow Register Grand Retreat for [X] days. On the concluding day, with utmost reverence, a Luo Heaven Grand Jiao is established, comprising 2,400 divine positions.

With profound reverence, we kowtow and humbly address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Three Clarities and Sacred Hosts, the Ten Poles and Lofty Perfected, the Northern Culmen Star Lord, the Nine Luminaries Star Lords, the Northern and Southern Dipper Star Lords, the Three Primordial Emperors of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all the numinous spirits.

We reflect that the Three Heavens and Two Earths cover and sustain all without partiality. Yin’s gloom and yang’s warmth govern generation and transformation beyond comprehension. Encompassing the myriad spirits above and discerning the myriad beings below, they respond to compliance with auspicious omens and to defiance with calamities. Thus did the former kings hold them in awe, and the ancient sages establish their bounds.

Your subject, inheriting the legacy of his ancestors and governing the multitudes, observes the lofty heavens to take his model and follows the precedents of the former sages to maintain their achievements. Now, with the frontiers pacified and the years abundant, what meager virtue of mine has aligned with this felicitous destiny? How could I forget the caution of steering decay or the admonition of treading deep waters? To repay the blessings of the divine, I reverently inaugurate this jiao altar.

We humbly pray that You bestow fortune upon the state and blessings upon all beings, that the two qi may be free of pestilence and the eight winds forever still the weapons of war. May the ten luminaries traverse the heavens without deviating from their proper courses, and the four seas mark the earth without surging waves. May the black-haired people all live in peace, and the myriad kinds thrive in harmony. May the court be steadfast in its manifold achievements, and the realm be spared the three disasters. We earnestly implore the mysterious spirits, prostrating ourselves with sincere devotion.

Your subject, overwhelmed with awe... [text incomplete]

To the Most Sacred Heaven, with utmost reverence, we present this solemn petition.

**Yellow Register Petition Formula**
On the [day], the [day]th day of the [month] in the year [year], cyclical year [stem-branch], at [location] in [prefecture/state/county], the Daoist officiant [name and title], respectfully entrusts Master [name] of the [scripture/register] Dharma to inaugurate the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast of [number] days and nights at [location]. May it supremely benefit the state and universally bless all beings. May it open the path for the ascent of the seven generations of ancestral souls and broadly deliver the nine realms’ lonely spirits. Gathering these meritorious fruits, we dedicate them specifically to deliver the departed soul of [name], that they may transcend to the realms of goodness.

With utmost reverence, we prostrate and present this petition, supplicating the Supreme, Formless, Nameless, Void, Spontaneous, Perfectly Real, Great Dao, the Most High Primordial Honored One, before the Golden Portal and Jade Threshold.

Your subject, overwhelmed with awe, gazes toward Heaven and longs for the Sacred with fervent devotion, prostrating in utmost sincerity, respectfully submits this petition.

**Yellow Register Scattered Altar Jiao Petition**
On the [day], the [day]th day of the [month] in the year [year], cyclical year [stem-branch], at [location] in [prefecture/state/county], the Daoist officiant [name and title], respectfully entrusts Master [name] of the [scripture/register] to inaugurate the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast of [number] days and nights at [location]. May it supremely benefit the state and universally bless all beings, ascend and deliver the departed ancestors, and broadly rescue the lonely spirits. Gathering these meritorious fruits, we dedicate them to the deliverance of the soul of [name], that they may transcend to the realms of blessedness.

Upon the completion of the fast, we reverently conduct the Pure Jiao of the Three Realms’ Lofty Perfected Ones, encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine stations, to manifest our gratitude for Heaven’s grace.

The minister humbly prostrates and presents this memorial, reverently invoking the Supreme Dao—formless and nameless, void and spontaneous, the utmost true and great, the primordial honored one of the Golden Portal and Jade Sovereign. Your servant, though unworthy, dares not but gaze toward Heaven, yearning for the sagely presence with utmost reverence and trepidation, and thus respectfully submits this petition.

This memorial’s sacred rank pertains to the worship of the Great Dao, distinct from the memorials addressed to the Three Realms’ Heavenly Worthies. For the Three Qi constitute the Three Realms, and the Three Realms are the Great Dao. This single hierarchical rank encompasses the Three Qi, embracing and unifying the primordial unity—nothing is left incomplete. If one were to employ the rites of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* while using the memorial format of the *Taiqing* tradition, it would constitute a grave transgression of protocol, both logically inconsistent and improper.

For instance, in the memorials of Orthodox Unity (*Zhengyi*) masters, where the *Taiqing* rank is used, the blue petitions (*qingci*) must likewise conform to that rank. Alternatively, if divided into the Three Realms, they address the Heavenly Worthies accordingly. Now, if the Great Dao’s rank is used exclusively, the Three Realms are not separately venerated. When distinctions in rank are made, the titles are as follows: in the Jade Clarity Realm, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, Void and Spontaneous; in the Highest Clarity Realm, the Supreme Dao Lord, Celestial Worthy of the *Dongxuan Lingbao*; and in the Great Clarity Realm, the Supreme Lord Lao, Celestial Worthy of the *Dongshen* and *Daode*.

Recently, some have used the title "August Emperor of the Void" beneath the Heavenly Worthies, which is incorrect. The August Emperor of the Void holds a distinct rank of its own. Likewise, those who designate the Dao Lord as the "August Emperor of Wondrous Existence" and the Primordial Beginning as the "August Emperor of Wondrous Nonbeing" demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the ultimate Dao. The Heavenly Worthies embody qi, and thus the Dao. The One Qi divides into Three, forming the Three Realms. Born of the same qi, to speak of its existence is inexpressible, and to speak of its nonexistence is untenable. All three dwell within the realm of wondrous nonbeing, for the Three Realms share a single body. To assign one Worthy to wondrous existence and another to wondrous nonbeing would imply that existence cannot become nonexistence, nor nonexistence existence—how far this strays from the Dao!

Such eccentric innovations, distorting the sacred ranks of the Three Realms’ Heavenly Worthies, violate ancient traditions and contravene ritual canons. These practices originate chiefly among the Daoists of eastern Zhejiang. Having traveled extensively across rivers and lakes, I have observed that such deviations are less prevalent elsewhere. The *Orthodox Unity Memorials and Taiqing Ranks* states: "The Supreme Lord Lao of the Great Dao, the Three Heavens, and the Ultimate Void; the Supreme Elder; the Heavenly Thearch; the Heavenly Elder; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital; the Nine Qi Elders; the myriad layers of Dao qi; the twelve hundred officials; and the Jade Sovereign of the Great Clarity." This rank pertains exclusively to the Great Clarity and belongs entirely to the *Dongshen* tradition. Thus, it is appropriate for Orthodox Unity fasts and jiao blue petitions. Separate memorials may still be offered to the Jade Clarity and Highest Clarity Realms.

For this reason, it is preferable to address the Three Realms’ Heavenly Worthies collectively. Beyond these, the memorial to the August Heavenly Sovereign reads: "The Supreme One Who Opens Heaven, Holds the Talisman, Governs the Calendar, Embodies Truth, and Upholds the Dao—August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven." For the Northern Pole: "Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity at the Center of Heaven and Northern Pole." For the Heavenly Sovereign: "Great Emperor of the Celestial Palace of the Curved Array." For the Earth: "August Earthly Sovereign Who Receives Heaven’s Mandate, Emulates the Law, and Embodies Profound Virtue and Radiant Light."

All other fabricated and uncanonical language must not defile the celestial realms. Exceptions are made only for those outside our tradition. Having examined ancient models of fasts and jiao from beginning to end, I find that all memorials and petitions are meticulously prepared—this is the responsibility of the high officiant. The blue petition, however, expresses the sincerity of the fast’s sponsor and serves as the basis for the high officiant’s ritual actions, known as the "transcribed petition." The blue petition lays bare the liver, and the cinnabar script symbolizes blood—thus conveying the sponsor’s utmost sincerity. Its language should be concise rather than verbose, plain rather than ornate, pouring forth the heart’s truth to implore the August Thearch.

In recent times, those skilled in literature indulge in florid excess, while those with strong memories cite historical anecdotes. Even in Confucian examination essays, one should not invoke history to interpret the classics—how much less appropriate is it to reference mundane records of a post-celestial world before the primordial August Thearch? Modern memorials and rhapsodies often quote passages out of context, while blue petitions have become riddles akin to child’s play. That such texts dare be transcribed and presented is truly lamentable.

If Daoist scriptures are to be cited, one must carefully consult the texts preserved in the *Daoist Canon*. Recently, authentic and spurious works have become entangled, making distinctions difficult. For example, the Chongdao Abbey in Tongbo, Tiantai, was established at the end of the Five Dynasties by King Qian of Wuyue. The scriptures in its repository were hastily compiled by young Daoist novices and Buddhist temple attendants, who copied them en masse to fill the collection. Written in silver ink on blue paper and bound into scrolls, these texts were produced under pressure to meet quotas amid the political fragmentation of the time. As a result, errors abound—omitted characters, missing phrases, entire passages rendered unreadable, and crude, obviously fabricated language. The extent of their inversions and mistakes is beyond enumeration.

Nearly three hundred years have now passed, spanning several generations, and the origins of these texts have faded from memory. Thus, it is claimed that the Daoist canon indeed contains such scriptures. Those of profound discernment can naturally distinguish right from wrong, but the shallowly learned cling to them as orthodox scripture. Might one cite or employ them? In Yunzhong’s observation, the confusion of scriptures and teachings across the land is no less severe than at Tiantai. Moreover, in places Yunzhong’s feet have never trod—books his eyes have never beheld—such errors abound. In distant regions and remote commanderies, within Daoist abbeys and jade palaces, countless scriptures have lost their correctness. Scholars must scrutinize them carefully and not apply them indiscriminately.

Among the various miscellaneous scriptures used for worldly affairs, people often extract entire sentences to incorporate into their compositions, yet these frequently contradict reason. The views of the vulgar, when offering prayers for the deceased, invariably extol the virtues and deeds of the departed, recounting their diligent labors in life—how does this align with the intent of petitioning Heaven for forgiveness? Which child does not love their parents? If one wishes to praise their conduct, one should seek the brush of a master to compose epitaphs, biographical accounts, sacrificial texts, or elegies, wherein their deeds may be recorded in full. Such words are not of this category. Is it to boast of the deceased’s merits and parade them before the world? Does one suppose the departed are unknown to Heaven?

In prayers for healing or averting disaster, one fails to repent of faults or acknowledge blame, instead harboring resentment toward Heaven and reproaching others. Some borrow phrases from classics and histories to serve as petitions for blessings, or seek rank and emolument, or crave longevity and felicity, describing these desires in extravagant terms without modesty or restraint—what do they take Heaven to be? From ancient times to the present, the printed *qingci* have been vast in number. Many are magnificent in literary splendor, yet few conform to ritual standards. The ritual masters of former generations would prepare *qingci* in advance, scrutinizing each character to ensure compliance with the ritual forms before submitting them. The revered masters of Yunzhong were well-versed in ancient and modern learning, upright and unyielding. Even when great nobles requested the performance of fasts and offerings, they would examine the *qingci* for accuracy, never submitting them merely to conform to vulgar expectations—how could they fear the reproach of the patrons?

Scholars and gentlemen of lofty standing, if their texts deviate from Daoist canonical forms, may be reasoned with. But when ignorant commoners present coarse and vulgar petitions, how can one deign to offer them in prayer? In recent times, the ways of the world have grown increasingly decadent. Ritual masters, bending to the times, have abandoned all sense of integrity and shame, fearing only that patrons will not employ them—how could they concern themselves with the propriety of the words? Among them, those unversed in ritual teachings and ignorant of principle, who rashly perform the rites, are hardly worth reproaching. Such petitions may not ascend to the heavens, and the Perfected Ones will surely respond—but considering their ignorance, one may apply the *Spring and Autumn*’s principle of holding the worthy to account.

Those well-versed in canonical texts, though they recognize the impropriety, dare to indulge sentiment and comply with vulgar demands, unafraid of divine scrutiny or punishment. They passively submit to the dictates of the unlearned, transcribing their crude words for submission—what punishment do they deserve? The opening of a *qingci* reads, “In the such-and-such year of the reign of [Dynasty Name],” a form established since antiquity. Recently, some have claimed that the character *wei* (維) offends Heaven’s taboos and have replaced it with *shi* (時). Yet the meaning of *shi* pertains to inscribing beams, writing on walls, or recording prefaces—it denotes the year and month of composition so that later readers may know the circumstances of the time. But *qingci* are written and burned in the altar at the very moment of offering, not stored for future use across years or dynasties. To place *shi* at the beginning—what meaning does this convey?

The Lady of Purple Tenuity stated that the writings of the celestial realms are not the defiled traces of the mundane world. All hidden taboos of the heavens are celestial characters, unrecognizable to the world. As scriptures descend in successive eras, they are translated into worldly writing, thus acquiring mundane characters. The names of the celestial realms and the taboos of the Perfected Ones should not be avoided before the supreme majesty of the Great Dao. From Heaven, the Dao has no name, and without name, the hidden taboos of the heavens exist. Only after the division of Heaven and Earth, as scriptures descended, did the world come to possess them. Now, the mundane character *wei* is mistakenly deemed a taboo of the Great Dao—even if scriptural evidence existed, it should not be followed.

Since the Tang dynasty, successive courts have presented jade tablets to the Heavenly Thearch, all uniformly beginning with *wei* in the year designation. For over a hundred years since the Sui, only *wei* was used. Why, then, has this taboo arisen only recently in petitions to Heaven? The court does not use *huang* (皇) in the imperial title, for *huang* means “great.” The Son of Heaven, though he styles himself a subject before Heaven, should not omit *huang*. Yet the court omits the dynastic name because the following text includes “the heir of the Song, Son of Heaven,” avoiding repetition. When ministers address the Son of Heaven, they say, “In the such-and-such year of the reign of the August Emperor,” a usage consistent through antiquity. Some stone inscriptions also attest to this. Those who claim *wei* offends Heaven’s taboos have no basis for their assertion.

Here, a *qingci* from the Jingde era is recorded, along with one from Jiang’s *Licheng Yi*, which includes a Tang-dynasty *qingci*—their forms are similar. In court rituals, the sacred positions of all emperors are listed, following ancient precedent. In private petitions for individual positions, seven scrolls are offered: one each for the Three Clarities, the Three Enclosures, the August Heaven, the Northern Culmen, the Heavenly Thearch, and the Queen of Earth. In ordinary Jiangdong fasts, sometimes only the August Heaven is petitioned, as the sovereign of Heaven to whom affairs are subordinate. When the Three Realms are collectively addressed as the stages of the Great Dao of the Supreme, only one scroll is used.

Petitions are expressions of earnest sincerity. Court *qingci*, addressing the Supreme Thearch and extending to the officials of the Three Realms, are for universal prayer. Thus, in the Northern Dipper fasts, *qingci* are also presented, though the wording should distinguish between weighty and light matters, and the term “memorial” is not used.

Moreover, there are reckless charlatans who deceive the world, claiming that *qingci* petitions are directed solely to the Heavenly Thearch, while those for the Dipper Stars may be written on white or yellow paper. They absurdly assert that *qingci* can distinguish ranks within the paper itself, even equating their memorials with those presented to Heaven—how preposterous! Do they not know that *qingci* (green petitions), *sushu* (plain documents), and *danshu* (cinnabar writings) embody the meaning of "carving the liver and dripping blood"? When addressing Heaven, one uses terms like "present" or "memorialize"; when addressing the ranked immortals, one says "submit" or "offer"—nothing more. The wording must be carefully weighed, never equated with that for Heaven.

At the outset of a *qingci*, the petitioner’s native place, name, location of the fast, and purpose are already stated; within the text, only the sorrowful plea remains. If one or two couplets describe the altar’s construction, the performance of Daoist rites, or the burning of incense and lighting of lamps, the logic becomes redundant. The text must be concise and precise: a single thought arises in the heart, and the myriad spirits witness it in the void. One need only express the plea earnestly—why require verbose, overflowing documents to move Heaven?

In ordinary fasts and Offerings where I, Yunzhong, am not involved, when assisting others, I often receive requests from scholar-friends to compose *qingci*, and many presumptuously accept. Yet the writings of the unlearned should not be transmitted far, so I refuse to include them in ritual manuals, merely noting the vulgar errors here.

This matter rests entirely with the High Priest (*gaogong*), who must be well-versed in ancient and modern precedents, meticulously examining ritual canons. When transcribing and presenting petitions, they must scrutinize them rigorously. Should any transgression occur, the officiating official is not without fault, and the High Priest’s punishment is doubled—how can one not be vigilant, how not be cautious?

Whenever I, Yunzhong, participate in fasts and Offerings, serving as the chief officiant, I do not compose *qingci* myself. If the petition’s intent contains even the slightest impropriety, I must report it to the fast’s sponsor and amend it before use—and the scholars have never refused to heed me. Petitions that wholly violate ritual standards are never transcribed or presented.

My rise or fall is entirely determined by fate; why would I flatter or ingratiate myself with scholars to seek petty gains? This is truly the teaching of my master, and by nature, I dare not slight the scholars of the fasts or profane the Supreme Thearch.

For Yellow Register fasts, the Offering to disperse the altar is conducted only after the fast concludes, as a thanksgiving to the spirits for safeguarding the altar grounds and conveying sincerity. Once the rites are complete, the Offering expresses gratitude to the true spirits. This differs from the forty-two types of independent Offerings.

Thus, the *qingci* in a fast are pleas for mercy and forgiveness, articulating the purpose of the fast. The *qingci* in a thanksgiving Offering, however, recount the fast’s shortcomings, petition for grace, and express gratitude. For example: "The fast’s rites have concluded, yet I fear errors in the ceremonies"; or "The departed soul has attained deliverance, bathed in the profound grace of the Dao"—this is the intent of *qingci* in thanksgiving Offerings.

Common fast sponsors, if not composing the petitions themselves, often delegate the task to others. Scholars, preoccupied with official examinations, may lack the time to refuse. Thus, they request *qingci* for the fast, then again for the Offering. Even those skilled in composition merely describe the fast and Offering, ignorant of the Daoist purpose behind post-fast Offerings.

Scholars versed in the Classics often model their petitions on classical exegesis, resembling examination "topic breakdowns." Those trained in *ci* and *fu* poetry mimic secular correspondence. For instance, when recommending deceased parents, they borrow lines like *"Sheng wo qu lao"* ("Born me with toil")—a phrase from the *Book of Songs* meant for private reflection, not for addressing a sovereign. How can one casually adopt such language when petitioning Heaven? Another example: *"Mu xi ju wo"* ("Mother nurtured me")—equally inappropriate.

Some scholar-officials write in their *qingci*: *"Having passed the age of knowing fate, I have repeatedly disgraced the observance of customs."* The phrase *"fifty and knowing fate"* is Confucius’s self-description, acceptable when speaking before others. But to state *"knowing fate at fifty"* as a veiled reference to age—is this fitting for Heaven?

In petitions for the deceased, one finds: *"Ju zhu yun mai, ai dao he qiong"* ("Dwelling in the clouds, grief knows no end"). The intent is *"ri ju yue zhu"* ("days and months pass"), but if one omits *"ri yue"* ("sun and moon") and uses only *"ju zhu"*, what is this? What does it mean? Another example: *"How could I expect a dream’s brief absence, only to see eighty years suddenly pass."* Using *"a dream"* to describe death is acceptable in elegies or miscellaneous writings, but omitting *"years"* and using only *"eighty"*—does this mean eighty days or eighty years?

Phrases like *"suddenly afflicted with river fish’s illness"* (a euphemism for diarrhea) or *"swiftly inciting the sigh of the crack’s steed"* (a riddle for death) are especially irreverent. The saying *"Life is like a white colt passing a crack"* is a metaphor—how can it be used when petitioning the Supreme Thearch? Lines such as *"Jade Capital and Golden Gates, treading the eight scenes’ clouds and mist; Round Peaks and Square Isles, dwelling in the three mountains’ towers and pavilions"*—if these are requests to deliver the deceased, can the Supreme Thearch act upon them?

Or consider: *"Morning dew has dried, vainly does the mournful wind howl."* This is idle phrasing. *"Morning dew dries quickly"* illustrates the fleeting nature of life, but if one uses only *"morning dew has dried"* out of context, it merely describes sunrise—how can this be used for Heaven?

As for poetic forms, there are *cangtou* (hidden head), *xiehou* (cut-off tail), riddles, and double entendres—none of which belong in petitions to the Dao.

Removing the first one or two characters from a line is called *cangtou* ("hidden head"). Su Dongpo once composed a playful verse: *"Virtue and goodness reach the age of standing firm; / Rare are the years my father has attained."* The first line alludes to the saying *"At thirty, one stands firm"*—implying his mother was thirty—while the second draws from the proverb *"Seventy is rare"* to suggest his father had reached seventy. This is an example of *cangtou*.

Omitting the last one or two characters from a line is called *xiehou* ("cut-off tail"). Someone once wrote a poem about a stone: *"The Milky Way’s loom is stilled; / An immortal holds the armrest in hand."* This refers to the *"Milky Way’s loom stone"* and the *"immortal’s armrest stone."* Su Dongpo also wrote: *"It alone can end a life; / Nothing else can undo all things."* The original full lines read: *"Wine alone can end a life; / Nothing else can undo all things like wine."* Dongpo removed one character from each line to adapt it into lyrics, exemplifying the *xiehou* style. During the late Tang, Zheng Rong was known for such witticisms, earning the nickname *"Xiehou Zheng the Fifth."*

Describing something without naming it is called *yinyu* ("hidden speech"). A recent poem reads: *"Soughing, it rises from the house—a thousand fathoms of jade; / Billowing, it hangs in the air—a single wisp of cloud."* The first line refers to bamboo, the second to incense. This is the *yinyu* form.

Using a line’s meaning in one sense while implying another is called *shuangguan* ("double entendre"). Su Dongpo wrote: *"Rain from the western mountain at sunrise— / No clear skies, yet skies are clear."* The word *"clear"* (*qing*) ostensibly refers to weather but subtly alludes to *"feeling"* (*qing*), suggesting *"no affection, yet affection exists."* This is the *shuangguan* technique.

Such devices belong to the realm of poetry, lyrics, and miscellaneous writings. In letters, they may be used among peers of equal status. When addressing high-ranking officials or submitting memorials to the court, however, they are inappropriate. Yet in recent times, *qingci* memorials to Heaven often employ *cangtou* and *yinyu*, deploying unconventional forms to plead for mercy or favor. How can one’s conscience allow such irreverence? This is but a brief overview.

Beyond these, there are many who fail to observe taboos, and all who violate the forms and canons of the Daoist scriptures fall into this category. Without careful study, they merely seek to preside over ritual affairs—how can the office of *gaogong* be so easily assumed? The ignorant are not worth reproaching, while the discerning dare not speak out. Greedily offering favors to curry favor with ritual officials, flattering worldly sentiments while deceiving the Creator—how alarming this is! The use of liturgical texts carries no small consequence. If a *gaogong* does not diligently examine and broadly consult, seeking what is most fitting, but instead approaches matters without discrimination, to whom shall the fault be ascribed? Though Yunzhong’s words are of little account, fearing that Heaven must not be trifled with, I cannot help but set forth this one ten-thousandth of my concern. Those of noble aspiration will surely heed this humble intent. As for the ignorant, they may well respond to such upright admonitions with slander and clamor. Yunzhong’s discourse is directed toward those of profound understanding. In time, may there be those who grasp this meaning—it would serve as an aid to the teachings.

*The Twenty-Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites concludes*
*The Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites*

The Master of Dongxuan Lingbao Rituals, Keeper of the Southern Bureau’s Enforcement Canon, and Right Adjunct of the Golden Chamber of the Youthful Repository, Jin Yunzhong, compiles the *Regulations for Memorials*

The Three Caverns have transmitted their regulations, and the Five Scriptures have unfolded their splendor, their mechanism established since antiquity—only the Dao of Dongzhen stands preeminent. Though its descent has flowed long, it was not until the late Warring States period that the Three Mao Perfected Lords first revealed auspicious signs at Mount Juqu, establishing their ancestral altar. Thereafter, figures such as Director Xu, Xu Yuanyou, Minister Yang of Destiny, and Perfected Guo followed in unbroken succession, none failing to refine the Supreme Dao, recite the Cavern Scriptures, and propagate the teachings of Jade Purity, without imposing cumbersome formalities.

The regulations of Dongzhen originally contained no protocols for memorials. It was not until the Han dynasty, when the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master emerged in response to the cosmic mandate, that statutes and ordinances were promulgated. Thus, the rituals of purification and the radiant standards of ceremonial conduct became the hallmark of the Dongshen Dao and the foundation of the Orthodox Unity tradition.

During the Eastern Wu, the Left Immortal Master Xuanguan received the *Categorized Rituals of Dongxuan Lingbao*, transmitting the protocols for memorials to the Celestial Emperor and the esoteric methods of soaring steps. By the Jin dynasty, Xu Jingyang practiced the teachings of the Filial Dao and the Luminous King, introducing techniques for expelling demons, severing toxins, and establishing merit for the salvation of the world. All these belong to the Dao of Dongxuan and the lineage of Lingbao, an unbroken truth from antiquity to the present.

The Lingbao method of memorial prostration is a forbidden and secret text of Dongxuan. From the wondrous inner practices of the Supreme Ultimate Immortal—soaring in spirit to petition the Emperor—to the transmission of the auspicious realms of the Supreme Mystery, it enables the refinement of the true self and the tempering of form, far beyond mere transcription of memorials for mundane affairs. To transmit it to the unworthy brings calamity upon oneself; to disseminate it without proper petition dooms nine generations of ancestors.

If the officials and generals invoked in the memorial—such as the Yin-Yang Divine Envoys, the Just Wind Courier Officers, the Post-Horse Memorial Officers, or the Flying Dragon Scribes—are to be employed, they must be used in conjunction with the Orthodox Unity memorials, for the bureau of the Just Wind Couriers admits no dual paths. As for the various functionaries of memorial review and verification, since practitioners first receive the registers of the Capital Merit, their roles may be combined or omitted as needed.

However, the Merit Officers and Jade Maidens, the methods of seal-script talismans, the techniques of shielding qi, visualizing spirits, treading the Dipper’s steps, and soaring in flight, the initiation of audience with the Primordial, and the communion with the Dao to attain the Perfected—these belong exclusively to the categories of Dongxuan and the original canons of Lingbao. Above, they do not usurp the rites of the Great Cavern of Jade Purity; below, they do not intermingle with the methods of Orthodox Unity or Dongshen. The Dao has its roots, like refined gold or flawless jade. Even the slightest admixture renders it counterfeit. Only through absolute purity and singular focus can resonance be achieved. The Immortal Master cultivated this and attained the Dao, becoming Perfected. Sima Chengzhen, having obtained its secrets, once secluded himself on Mount Shaoshi, disseminating these Dongxuan memorial methods to the world. Those who encounter them must guard them closely. Without swearing oaths to Heaven and Earth and receiving transmission before the altar, they must not be lightly employed. Those outside this lineage should especially refrain from practicing them. Better to dismiss them as invalid and discard them than to treat them with negligence.

When at leisure, one should first cultivate stillness. This stillness is not the lifeless void of the Buddhists but approximates the heart-fasting and sitting-in-forgetfulness of the Confucian Yanzi. Inner thoughts do not stray outward; external distractions do not intrude. In profound tranquility, one abides continuously, as if present yet not present. Within stillness, movement arises, and from it, methods and arts are born. Embracing the Three Qi to fill the interior, gathering the One Spirit to stand at the center, one establishes this wondrous foundation, forgetting both self and world. Gradually, this spirit becomes light and ethereal, rising imperceptibly from the body, riding the void and harnessing qi, ascending weightlessly. Following the method of soaring steps—whose secrets are scattered throughout the texts—scholars must discover them for themselves. It begins with what all know, but its culmination lies beyond mortal comprehension. Without relying on elaborate calculations, merit naturally flourishes; without forced promotion, the form refines itself; without projecting the spirit, the spirit departs on its own; without striving for the true, the true naturally manifests. Applied to memorials, it severs delusion and falsehood, annihilates malevolent spirits, transcends the living and the dead, and averts neighboring calamities. Myriad methods converge into one, simple yet not cumbersome—truly the pivot of Lingbao and the path of the Perfected Immortals.

**Purification Before Memorial Prostration**
Whenever presenting a memorial, first cleanse external impurities. Bathe and change clothes, using fragrant water for washing, then don fresh garments before entering the quiet chamber. If the body is unclean, the spirits will not reside within, the methods will lack efficacy, and the rites will fail to reach Heaven.

**Decoction for Bathing**
Peach bark: half a catty
Maoxiang: half a catty
Huoxiang: half a tael
Fragrant Angelica: half a tael
Linglingxiang: half a tael
Grind into coarse powder and decoct together.

**Talisman for Internal Purification**
*Incantation:*
The workings of Heaven and Earth,
The essence of sun and moon,
Radiate through the four seas,
Severing evil spirits.
Slay demons, dispel illness,
The body shines with light.
Divine water sprinkled,
Ten thousand misfortunes vanish.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*

Recite the incantation, write the talisman, burn it to ash, and mix with pure water to ingest. Place another copy beneath the memorial table, ensuring no one sees it.

**Regular Talisman Ingestion**
Those who present memorials should habitually recite the sacred texts and ingest talismans, resonating with the numinous qi to refine the body and spirit, thereby ensuring efficacy when the time comes. The talismans for regular use are contained within the methods. To enumerate them here risks carelessness and neglect, so no fixed format is established. Simply use proven talismans from daily practice, ingesting them as needed.

**Method for Ingesting the Memorial to Notify the Spirit**
When approaching the altar to present a memorial, three days prior, briefly outline the memorial’s intent on a thin sheet of paper, two and a half inches wide, and write in fine script. Then enter stillness, visualize the spirit, and swallow the memorial. This is the function of memorial prostration.

The Lingbao method of "memorials with intent" pertains to urgent and confidential matters, differing in detail from the above.

In recent times, those who have heard of this method and received its transmission call it the "Memorial of the Heart," measuring three inches and three fen in length—this is indeed the memorial for notifying the spirit of the heart. However, many nowadays mistakenly use this format for the "Memorial of the Heart" to petition Heaven, which is a grave error.

The format for ingesting memorials has already been received through altar vows and will not be repeated here.

**Burning Talismans in the Incense Burner When Presenting Memorials**
This is a commonly used talisman, also known as the "Master Artisan Talisman." According to ancient ritual, it is burned in the incense burner on the altar table when presenting memorials and prostrating. One must not disregard it simply because its name is familiar.

**Blank Space Before and After the Memorial**
For Orthodox Unity memorials, twelve small seals are used. From the second bow to the section following the Great Year, all are sealed. One school’s seals include borders. Another school’s small seals, like talismans, omit borders. Thus, in Orthodox Unity memorials, no blank lines precede the Great Mystery Capital, whereas in the Dongxuan (Cavern Mystery) tradition, blank space is left before and after the memorial. All talismans are written according to the prescribed format, without the twelve small seals. Only the "General Memorial Seal" is used on the year and month.

Some, seeing the "General Memorial Seal" recorded in the *Divine Empyrean Register*, hastily claim it belongs to the Jade Clarity (Yuqing) and Cavern Realms (Dongzhen) Department. They fail to recognize that before the rise of the Divine Empyrean teachings, the Dongxuan memorial system had long used this seal since before the Five Dynasties. The text of the "General Memorial Seal" is derived from the *Lingbao Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven*, merely omitting its lower portion. When used by the living, it serves as an "ascension memorial," providing evidence in the celestial court. The seal signifies mark and trust—this is its essential meaning.

The Dongxuan memorial system employs the "General Memorial Seal," which is part of the original Lingbao canon. Some, upon seeing such practices—a single talisman or seal—borrowed from other texts, mistakenly label them as "Jade Clarity Lingbao." This is incorrect. The *Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven* has always belonged to the Dongxuan Department. When issued to the deceased, the nine characters of the "Messenger of the Nine Mysteries" include phrases like "summon the soul and ascend." When used by the living as a seal, the lower text is omitted—how could this then be attributed to the Dongzhen Department? The *Divine Empyrean Register* merely includes it among its auxiliary materials. Neither its register nor its methods explicitly claim this seal does not belong to the Dongxuan Lingbao tradition. At the time, the Divine Empyrean was regarded as the "Celestial Altar," encompassing all methods. Thus, one or two Lingbao talismans were incorporated into its register. This does not justify altering the ancient system’s categories.

**Lingbao Memorial Presentation Ritual**
The High Priest establishes the oratory, ingests the talisman, and visualizes the proper procedures. Thirty-six offerings of wine and fruit are arranged in two rows along the side halls. With full ritual dignity, the High Priest proceeds to the oratory, leads the officiant to the master’s altar, and announces the matter at hand. Upon completion, he ascends the outer altar to the Earth Gate and recites the "Entering the Gate Incantation." He then ascends the Heavenly Gate, offers incense on the Ten Directions’ incense table, burns the incense talisman, and presents incense at his proper station.

The High Priest moves the ritual table to the right side of the altar, facing northwest. He then visualizes the Four Numinous Beasts guarding his body, the sun and moon illuminating his form nine inches from his face, the Northern Dipper covering his head, and the demon-quelling banner before him. He pays homage to the master as in the fasting ritual.

He visualizes the Three Generals descending from the Heavenly Gate: the Upper Prime’s black *qi* at the left kidney, the Middle Prime’s black *qi* at the right kidney, and the Lower Prime’s red *qi* at the heart. He envisions red-clad officials and soldiers guarding the altar grounds.

The Cantor intones, and each pays homage to the master while maintaining visualization as prescribed. The High Priest recites the incantation:

**Incantation:**
At the Great Beginning, the Primordial True,
The Five Elders in lofty reverence stand.
The Supreme Constancy shines in hidden radiance,
No darkness left unillumined.
Above, they govern the Nine Heavens;
In the center, they command Mount Feng;
Below, they pacify rivers and seas,
The twelve river sources.
The Eight Mighty Divine Incantations,
The Five Sacred Scriptures of the Numinous Register.
Summon dragons to float upon the waters,
Gather *qi* and amass clouds.
Ten thousand spirits shattered and fallen,
All slain without reprieve.
Sun, moon, and five planets,
The Northern Dipper’s seven origins.
All heavens, all earths,
All waters, all mountains.
Heavenly Kings at leisure,
The Five Emperors bearing banners.
Celestial Soldiers lead the way,
Golden Tigers rush behind.
Fierce beasts of Heaven,
Seal and close the four gates.
What is called arrives instantly,
What is summoned hastens forward.
The Red Script of the Radiant Fall,
Wind and fire without pause.
Whatever is commanded,
The Golden Dragon swiftly transmits.

The Cantor intones, and the ritual drum is sounded twenty-four times.

O Most Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Origin of the Three *Qi*, Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six each of the Direct-Day Incense Officials—emerge. Let those who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire. Notify the local earth gods and the deities of the soil and grain of this domain. This servant now burns incense and offers it with sincere intent, that all sentiments and supplications be fully conveyed in the memorial text. May the life-*qi* of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ Orthodox True Ones descend and flow into this servant’s body, that this servant’s entreaties swiftly reach the presence of the August Heavenly Jade Emperor of the Limitless Great Dao.

Each declares their ritual rank:

This servant, [Name], along with the assembled altar officials, humbly and with utmost sincerity, respectfully addresses the Limitless Great Dao, the August High Perfected, the Imperial Lord of the Sun Palace, the August Sovereign of the Moon Mansion, the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper, the Three Origins’ Lords of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Four Sage Marshals of the Northern Culmen, the Five Virtues’ Stellar Lords of the Five Directions, the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Quarters, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Orthodox Unity Perfected of Serene Response, the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures’ Transmission, the Left Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate, the Perfected of Thorough Response, the Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces’ Immortals, the Lofty and Illustrious Great Envoy, the Perfected of Divine Merit and Wondrous Aid, the Ancient and Present Transmitting Perfected Masters, the Sagely Hosts of the Three Caverns’ Altar, the Divine Immortals of the Numinous Treasure Registers, the Sagely Multitudes of the Cavern Mystery’s Ritual Codes, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions, the Three Perfected Lords Tang, Ge, and Zhou, the Inspectors of the Fast, the Numinous Treasure Officials and Attendants, the Thousand Chariots and Ten Thousand Riders of the Memorial, and all true numina.

This servant has heard that the August High Perfected are the sovereigns of the Mysterious Culmen’s utmost reverence. The Jade Capital and Golden Gates, the Purple Clarity’s supreme heavens—gazing upward, they are distant and unfathomable; looking toward them, their vault is boundless. Their majesty permits no verbal approach, their form admits no ascent by steps. Though the paths of high and low diverge, and the tracks of sage and mortal differ, yet the offices of ritual codes and memorials are established, and the teachings broadly expound the rules of flying petitions. Though communication between heaven and humanity occurs in the space of offerings, it is truly the master’s guidance that connects in the moment of contemplation. Only by issuing forth one’s spirit may one ascend to the Emperor; by purifying one’s person, one is permitted to reach Heaven. In an instant, soaring and ascending, the response is swift and sudden. Before presenting the sealed memorial, the true chariot is first expected to descend. Summon forth the gods within the body, reverently welcome the heavenly officials, and may the original vows be upheld, the mysterious compassion steered. Bowing in submission and offering sincerity, this servant now respectfully invokes.

**Invoking the Memorial Officials’ Ranks:**
Incense is offered, tea is presented, and the initial offering rites commence.

Again declaring their ritual rank:
This servant, [Name], humbly and with utmost sincerity, respectfully concludes the address to the Limitless Great Dao, the August High Perfected, the Sagely Hosts of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Three Officials and Four Sages, the Five Masters and Perfected Lords, the Divine Immortals of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Registers, and the Three Generals of the Origins.

May all gaze upon this true compassion and deign to grant their penetrating insight. This servant has heard that the Cavern Mystery initiates the workings, greatly expanding the rites of memorials and petitions. The Numinous Treasure bestows its codes, broadly demonstrating the standards of fasts and cultivations. The true wind universally permeates, the mysterious transformation is abundantly spread. Through the true masters opening the gate of aid and deliverance, the sagely hosts above unfold boundless grace. The myriad regions look up in reliance, and for a thousand ages, all follow. How could a latecomer of the earthly realm presume to praise? It is truly the sagely masters of the upper realms who condescend to guide. Still, we pray for compassion and aid, and in the end, bestowance and support.

This servant reports on behalf of [Name], who has roused his will with diligence and submitted words with fervent urgency. He begs to present the memorial text for transmission above, desiring to implore the boundless heavens’ descending compassion. Yet this servant is a mundane being entangled in the worldly net, a base vessel of earthly conduct. Presumptuously assuming this office, he has been entrusted with the duty of transmitting and proclaiming. He has not yet been able to lighten his body with the *qi* of kindness, nor has he ascended on flying clouds to pay homage to the Emperor. He merely follows the established standards, vainly adhering to the set rules. Without relying on the master’s grace, it would be difficult to reach the heavens’ hearing. Reverently gazing toward the Teaching Master of the Jade Capital, the Venerable Master of the Golden Gates, may the Merit Officers of the present day and hour be dispatched, and the memorial-transmitting officials be ordered to the altar to convey the supplications, ascending the memorial as prescribed. May the ritual codes be made manifest, that the response and retribution be made clear. Daring to extend this humble offering, this servant exhausts his foolish sincerity. Bowing his head in reverence, he respectfully presents the secondary offering.

**Incense-Offering Rites:**
This servant humbly and with redoubled sincerity addresses the Limitless Great Dao, the August Sagely Masters, the Three Perfected Lords Tang, Ge, and Zhou of the Three Origins, the Memorial-Transmitting Divine Officials of the Three Heavenly Gates, the True Officials who guide and advance, the Register-Keeping Officials above, the Flying Memorial Attendants within the Dharma, the *Qi*-Hastening Merit Officers, the Courier Station Magistrates and Assistants, the Four Divisions’ Inspectors of Merit and Petitioners, the Examiners of Deceit and Upholders of Rectitude, the various lords and officials, the Precious Memorial Presenters, the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, the Day and Hour Officers, the Direct-Day Incense Officials, the Year-Star Official Lord, the Ten Stems’ On-Duty Generals and Officials, the mountains and rivers, streams and valleys, seas and peaks, grotto-heavens, the divine officials and generals, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders of the memorial, and all true numina.

Prostrate in reverence, we acknowledge that the boundless celestial heights above cannot be approached by mortal means. With utmost humility and devotion, only the divine may be reached. To exhaust the subtleties of meditative contemplation, we rely wholly upon the numinous efficacy of transmission and presentation. Today, so-and-so, in observance of ritual protocols, submits this memorial to initiate affairs, offering these written petitions, desiring that they penetrate the loftiest exalted realms. Without the celestial officials to convey them, how could these earthly words attain such profound penetration? Humbly we present these modest offerings, invoking the descent of the divine steeds, that they may witness this sincere devotion and bestow their sacred blessings. Aid the practitioner’s meditative visualization, guide them upon the cloud-path to ascension. Lead forward the Perfected Officials, escorting before and behind; the Register-Keeping Officials above shall review, examine, and transmit these supplications. May this earnest sincerity swiftly meet with manifest response. We dare conclude with three libations, thus completing the jiao rites.

*Reading the Memorial for the Spirit-Money and Horses:*
We address the Fivefold-Bodied Perfected Officials, the Eight Radiant Divine Clerks, the Golden Halls and Jade Chambers, and all exalted numina. Prostrate in reverence, we note that the Nine Palaces are arrayed at the head, venerating the Celestial Thearch of the Mud-Pill Palace. The Five Qi govern the center, harmonizing the hundred spirits within the body. To grasp the true mechanism, one must activate its wondrous function. Moreover, in the transmission of scriptures and conferral of registers, bonds are severed and tally-tokens divided—whenever there are prayers and entreaties, the Dharma rightfully brings salvation and relief. Today, we present this memorial, ascending to the Cinnabar Gate. The spirit of the upright qi of this body shall petition the exalted perfected ones of the Three Realms. From the mortal to the sacred, from earth to heaven. First, they traverse the Gāng winds, offering passage through the floating void; they regulate the qi through Horn and Neck, revolve to shield the form with Winnowing Basket and Dipper; they pay homage at the divine palaces of the Two Luminaries, cross the stellar bureaus of the Five Constants. Through the Desire Realm, the Form Realm, the Formless Realm, and the Seed People, they ascend to the heights of the Golden Gates, presenting their audience before the sacred ones of Jade Capital. The petition’s affairs concluded, they return once more to the body. In strict accordance with ritual statutes, we dispatch the generals and officials.

Kneeling in reverence, they dispatch the officials. With utmost care, they send forth from within this servant’s body the True Officials of the Five Bodily Vessels and the Merit Scribes; the Twelve Executors of Law and Transformers of Yin-Yang from the Upper Three Heavens; the Twelve Lords and Clerks who Dissolve Disasters, Dispel Calamities, and Resolve Adversities; the Great Generals who Establish Standards and Supervise Merit in the Central Realm; the Vanguard who Effect Merit and the Rear Guard who Effect Punishment; the Post Station Commanders and their Deputies; the Fourfold Supervisors of Merit and the Audience Heralds; the Flying Memorial Attendants within the Dharma; the Qi-Urging Scribes; the Three-Five Scribes; the Left and Right Envoys; the Direct Attendants of the Five Thearchs; the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens; and the Yin-Yang Divine Seal Clerks—all emerge.

Those who emerge don their solemn regalia and manifest vestments, their caps and sashes adorned with hanging tassels, their dignity and bearing impeccably arrayed. The Merit Scribes wear crimson yang headbands, crowns that reach to heaven, black silk unlined robes, and sashes bearing dragon-headed swords, holding the audience registers in their hands. The Envoys wear dark yin headbands, crowns of the Nine Virtues, vermilion unlined robes, and sashes bearing tiger tallies, carrying jade tablets in their charge.

The Direct Scribes stand at the four directions, the Three-Five Scribes stand at the center, the Healing Scribes patrol and guard this servant’s body, the Left Envoys plant their standards at the fore, the Right Envoys hold their banners at the rear, the Yang Divine Seal Clerks stand to the left, the Yin Divine Seal Clerks stand to the right, the Upper Scribes stand at the upper direction, the Middle Scribes stand within the body, the Qi-Urging Scribes hasten the qi of the ten directions, the Upper Envoys gaze afar toward the heavens, the Middle Envoys survey the eight directions, the General Envoys encircle this servant’s body, the Celestial Couriers and armored soldiers, the Wolf Clerks and Tiger Warriors, the Inspectors of Deceit and Cavalry Scouts, the General Commanders and Archers, the Celestial Ding Warriors, the Clerks who Rectify and Uphold, the Clerks who Gather and Nourish Spirits, the Clerks who Capture and Consume Ghosts, the Clerks who Absorb and Ingest Qi, the Clerks who Neutralize and Devour Poisons, the Clerks who Seize and Consume Essences, the Clerks who Execute Talismans and Destroy Shrines, the Gāng Wind Couriers, the Post Horse Memorial Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, and all other officials—all assemble and station themselves to this servant’s left and right, front and rear.

All receive this servant’s proclaimed words, distinguishing and transmitting them to the local earth gods of this place, the rectifying deities of the domain, the supervising and summoning inspectors, the Left and Right Lords of Universal Balance, the Twenty-Eight Treatments, the Thirty-Six Quiet Abodes, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Named Mountains, the Upper Palace of Kunlun, the Grotto-Heavens and Sea Peaks, the Two Mysteries upon the Dao, the Three Origins and Four Beginnings, the Twenty-Four Qi, the Twelve Hourly Spirits, the August Heaven and Venerable Earth, this year’s Grand Year Star and Great Yin, the various officials of the sixty celestial stems and earthly branches, the wind qi and infused qi, the village and hamlet altars, the four directions and eight quarters, the Nine Yi and Hu Elders of the East, the Eight Man and Yue Elders of the South, the Six Rong and Shi Elders of the West, the Five Di and Qiang Elders of the North, the Three Qin and Cang Elders of the Center, the Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin, the twenty-six thousand divine immortals, the river sources and stream valleys, the mountain forests and marsh elders, the Twelve Stream Perfected, the root origins and fundamental beginnings, the lords of this native land, and the numinous officials and generals of the altars and granaries.

With unified sincerity, they reverently address the Most High, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Utmost True and Great Dao, the Most High Dao Lord, the Jade Sovereign of the Upper Clarity.

This servant, by virtue of karmic affinity, has been so fortunate as to receive the transmission of the teachings and the Dharma. On the day of the covenant, it was pledged to circulate and propagate them. I vowed to spread and exalt the true wind, to invigorate and proclaim the wondrous Dao, to eternally uphold the nation’s destiny, and to universally succor living beings. For all who submit in sincerity, it is fitting to transmit and memorialize their pleas.

Now, with utmost care, there is one who has submitted words and intentions, bearing the Dharma tokens and seeking to present a memorial. This servant prostrates upon the earth and bows to present the memorial text, which now rests upon the plain table. I humbly beseech the attending officials above to deign to examine and consider it, to transmit it upward in due time, and to request that the memorial be reviewed.

The memorial is raised aloft upon the imperial table, the dragon-headed writing knife stationed to the left.

To the right, the vermilion brush and fish-shaped inkstone stand guard. The duplicate of the memorial is proclaimed. According to old protocol, the memorial is first dispatched, then sealed. Yet if no official is sent ahead, the sealed memorial is never again opened for invocation—this is deemed improper. Now, sealing precedes dispatch. Should one wish to follow the old rites, the Daoist assembly may carry the memorial text, the memorial case, the face seal, silk thread, and paste to the High Priest’s table. The High Priest holds the memorial case, silently reciting the *Opening the Case Spell*; the case is not opened first, but the memorial is placed outside it. Formerly, wax filled the seal’s impression, and a wax seal was used—yet wax is impure. Now, only silk thread is tied, and paste is applied to the seal’s impression, stamping it without wax on the paper.

The scribe is summoned, the minor clerk of the case. Grasping the dragon-headed writing knife, he opens the case’s mechanism. The memorial ascends to the imperial presence, opening the path of communication. May what is petitioned swiftly reach its destination, and may this servant fulfill his duty from beginning to end.

Next, the memorial is passed over incense while silently reciting the *Fumigating the Memorial Spell*:
*"Smoke of five colors, ascend with the memorial to heaven.
Qi of five hues, carry the memorial to the Emperor.
Lesser officials’ stale qi must not recklessly interfere."*

The memorial is sealed: the Dharma Master personally places the memorial and petition into the case, a Daoist hands the thread, paste is applied to the seal’s impression, and the High Priest affixes the paper seal. Then, silently invoking the *Commanding the Memorial Spell*:
*"This servant’s brush, spirit-bright, commands the Upper Clarity.
Immortal youths and jade maidens, open the dragon case.
Let this servant’s petition swiftly reach the Celestial Court.
Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law and command."*

Again, silently reciting the *Dispatching the Memorial Spell*:
*"The solemnity of dispatching the memorial ensures timely transmission.
The secret seal is heart-transmitted; the numinous memorial is discreetly entrusted.
Vermilion smoke rises by night; cloud paths traverse the day.
I gaze upward in hope of profound grace, silently bestowing blessings and aid."*

The High Priest, having sealed the memorial, places it upon the tablet, kneels in reverence, and dispatches the official. He solemnly dispatches the Five Body True Officials within his person, one minor clerk, twelve scribes, thirty-five Merit Clerks, Left and Right Official Envoys, Urgent Qi Merit Clerks, Flying Memorial Attendants, Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, Flying Dragon Mounted Clerks, and other officials. Adorned in formal attire, caps with hanging tassels, swords at their sides, and talismans in hand, they are to promptly carry the memorial on behalf of this servant, ascending directly to the Three Heavens, reporting to their respective bureaus, and presenting the memorial in audience.

This servant, by karmic fortune, has presumptuously assumed a sacred office, yet fails to comprehend the true and orthodox, remains ignorant of qi’s signs, is of humble rank and coarse understanding, dull in perception and foolish in judgment. The memorial now presented may violate regulations, its script untidy, its phrases erroneous, its words omitted or misaligned, its language irreverent. I beseech the memorial’s attending clerks and minor scribes to timely correct and amend it, ensuring its proper presentation, lest the officials above reject it.

This servant, holding his breath, follows the memorial as it ascends to the Supreme, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Perfectly True Great Dao—Most High Dao Lord of the Upper Clarity Jade Thearch—humbly praying it not be delayed. May the officials at each checkpoint and the numinous officers within the memorial sequentially distinguish and act: granting what is requested, summoning what is called, healing what is afflicted, delivering what is saved, annihilating what is condemned, and advancing what is promoted. Should any lesser official’s stale qi intercept this servant’s memorial in the void, preventing its ascent, I hereby request it be recorded and handed to the appropriate celestial prison, punished according to celestial law, to uphold the celestial statutes. All memorial documents must assuredly reach the throne above.

This servant prostrates to the right of the imperial presence, reverently awaiting celestial favor and praying for a response.

The High Priest hands the memorial to the Daoist assembly, placing it upon the memorial table. The bell-keeper initiates the ritual; the supervisor of the fast accompanies the memorial, leading it to the burning site. The memorial is burned with fierce fire. The announcing official, within the altar’s precincts, recites the *Fumigation of the Memorial Hymn*. The High Priest escorts the memorial out, then prostrates, visualizing the process, performing the rites as prescribed.

At the four corners of the altar, incense burners are placed, and talismans are burned in the four directions. The High Priest rises from prostrating over the memorial and announces the *Hymn of Memorial Burning*, concluding the proclamation of the rites.

The minister, with utmost sincerity, reverently addresses and invokes the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Perfected Masters, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, the Orthodox Unity Pacifying Response Perfected Lords, the Perfected Lords of the Lingbao Scriptures and Registers’ Three Masters of Salvation, the Perfected Lords and Marshals of the Four Saints of the Northern Culmen, the Left Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate and Impulse-Response Perfected Lord, the Grand Historians of the Nine Provinces’ Immortal Assembly, the Lofty and Illustrious Great Envoys, the Perfected Lords of Divine Merit and Wondrous Aid, the Sacred Ones of the Three Caverns’ Altar, the Eternal Patriarchs of the Transmitted Teachings, the Perfected Immortals of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Three Perfected Lords of Tang, Ge, and Zhou, the Memorial-Offering Divine Officials under the Three Heavens’ Gate, the Guiding Perfected Officials, the Merit-Recording Jade Maidens, the Attending Direct Talismans, the Cloud-Road Escorting Immortal Colleagues of the Void, the Fivefold Perfected Officials, and the Myriad Spirits within this minister’s body.

I have heard that preserving authenticity and contemplating the Dao may aspire to commune with the loftiness of the Brahma-qi. Yet in bowing to present this memorial and transcribing its text, I have not yet penetrated the subtleties of the teachings. Merely following the ancient rites to perform this task, I deeply know that this mortal frame is no immortal.

Having presumptuously drawn upon private grace, I dispatch the Twenty-Four Spirits to soar this memorial to the Purple Ultimate. Reverently relying on the nurturing embrace of the cosmos, I gather the Thirty-Five Divisions to unify qi and ascend to the Supreme Mystery. Yet my thoughts remain impure, my offerings crude in ritual—still, I dare to grasp at the cloud-borne regalia, humbly bathed in your condescending presence. How could I bear to lag behind your cloud-borne chariot? I can only pray that you might graciously pardon my reckless presumption and, in the end, bestow upon me the gift of life and completion.

All that I request, all that I beseech, may it be heard and answered. My gratitude runs deep; bowing my head, I know where my duty lies. Stretching my neck toward the celestial thoroughfare, I prostrate myself in reverent farewell.

*Ode to the Departing Sages:*
The High Master kneels in devotion, receiving the talismans.

This minister’s memorial now concluded, the Fivefold Perfected Officials within my body, the Merit-Recording Envoys, and all attendants withdraw through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries—those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right, pervading heaven and earth. The Direct Envoys and Merit-Recording Officials, charged with oversight, return to their proper stations, securing the golden halls and jade chambers, ensuring no misstep or disorder. When summoned again, let all proceed as before.

*The Twelve Vows:*
The incense burner is sealed.

O Fragrant Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Spirit-Officials of the Incense—may this place where I present my memorial spontaneously generate golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the Hundred Spirits and Myriad Perfected gather here before this incense burner. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality; may the officiating priests receive blessings; may the world be enveloped in grace; may the departed souls be delivered; and may the trapped and benighted ascend.

O Immortal Youths and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions, attend the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey this minister’s memorial and supplications directly to the presence of the Most Perfect, Boundless, and Great Dao—the August Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven.

Exiting the chamber, descending the altar, the master concludes with words of gratitude.

Withdrawing into the oratory chamber, the memorial officials take their positions at the altar of offering.

Having duly received the master’s transmission of the memorial method, which is the Dao of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, and as memorials also derive from ancient ordinances akin to the Orthodox Unity tradition, the practices commonly employed in the world, along with the Numinous Treasure’s ranks, share great similarity with minor differences among their officials, clerks, soldiers, and generals. However, when it comes to flying spirits to petition the Thearch and the visualization practices employed, the Numinous Treasure and Orthodox Unity diverge entirely. Without transmission through celestial oaths, such methods may not be openly revealed. As with the Jade Purity’s ranks and the Cavernous Perfection’s division, memorial formats are not prescribed—this has been universally acknowledged throughout the ages.

In recent times, the Tiantai method has claimed that "heart memorials" of the Jade Purity rank should employ the *Tongzhang* seal. This assertion arises from seeing the *Tongzhang* seal recorded in the Divine Empyrean Registers and thus inventing this theory, unaware that the seal’s inscription is in fact the *Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven* of the Numinous Treasure. It further claims that the Cavernous Mystery division should employ the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps* memorial seal. Yet the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps* merely describe the actions performed during memorial presentation—such a practice is unattested in antiquity. For the Cavernous Spirit division, it prescribes the *Yellow Spirit Transcending Memorial* seal, which is also not exclusively tied to the Orthodox Unity tradition. Such errors stem from insufficient investigation.

Jiang’s *Established Rites* states that purification rites derive from the Numinous Treasure, while memorial presentation originates from the Orthodox Unity. Given its lineage’s transmission from the Orthodox Unity’s ancestral altars, and as the Heavenly Master follows the original ordinances for memorial presentation, it does not extensively reference the Numinous Treasure. Following the argument in *Established Rites*, one may omit the Numinous Treasure’s original ordinances yet still preserve the Orthodox Unity’s memorial format. This approach, though somewhat precarious, offers a measure of stability. However, failing to recognize that the Cavernous Perfection division lacks memorial formats and instead dividing the Three Caverns’ memorial presentations based on Tiantai methods risks deviating from the canonical teachings.

Some claim that the *Three-Five Flying Steps* constitute the Orthodox Unity’s memorial method, while the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps* belong to the Cavernous Mystery division’s practices, even going so far as to conflate the Divine Empyrean’s officials, clerks, soldiers, and generals with memorial presentation. Yet the Divine Empyrean’s teachings flourished only during the Xuanhe era of the Song dynasty. Before the Divine Empyrean’s emergence, the Numinous Treasure’s ordinances had long been transmitted in the world, never intermingling with the Divine Empyrean. Thus, in recent times, those who practice the Great Cavern by incorporating the Divine Empyrean while also practicing the Numinous Treasure, calling it *Jade Purity Numinous Treasure*, may seem comprehensive, but such a format is unattested in antiquity.

The Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s method for memorial presentation should be practiced during moments of leisure in daily life, cultivating qi and refining spirit to ascend into emptiness and enter subtlety. Internally, this is called *Ten Revolutions Returning the Numinous*; in memorial presentation, it is termed *Primal Net Flying Steps*. At the altar, one avoids cumbersome actions, manual gestures, or footwork. Instead, the Dao assembly is instructed to place four incense burners at the four corners of the memorial altar, each filled with abundant fragrant flames. As soon as the High Merit kneels in prostration, four talismans are burned in the incense burners at the four corners. Once the High Merit has dispatched the officials, the memorial is reverently held and presented to the Dao assembly, who convey it for burning. The High Merit then prostrates in submission to the memorial. This is what is meant by "still and unmoving, yet responsive and thus penetrating"—the effort must be cultivated in ordinary times. This approach differs greatly from the Orthodox Unity’s visualization of flying spirits.

Only by transmitting this lineage, receiving this dharma title, inscribing this memorial format, invoking these sacred ranks, employing this seal, and practicing this method from beginning to end, from exterior to interior, as a unified whole, can one achieve thorough resonance. If one merely appropriates a few practices to augment existing studies, or if the transmitter of the method feels ashamed to follow tradition, refusing to amend the seal’s script, memorial format, titles, or positions, yet falsely adopts the name of *Primal Net Flying Steps* to deceive the world, then the Dao’s constancy and its statutes cannot be violated.

**The Petition and Thanksgiving Section of the Six Memorials**
*Compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Right Assistant of the Initial Office of the Divine Youth, Enforcer of the Southern Bureau of the Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Dharma Masters*

Presenting memorials before the sovereign is proper ritual. From the Crown Prince and various princes to the chief ministers and high officials, the use of *jian* or *qi* petitions is likewise ritual—this is the way of the world. When the Daoist teachings were first established in antiquity, only memorials in *zhang* form existed. From the middle ancient period onward, imitating worldly conventions, documents such as proclamations, memorials, and petitions emerged. Since these draw from ancient canons and are governed by ritual classics, the six petitions should uniformly employ *jian* texts. The old format of using *biao* memorials before the master violates ritual propriety. Recently, some have used *shu* memorials, and upon examination, Han and Tang dynasty court officials all used *shu* when discussing matters—akin to the "palace memoranda" of the Song. Yet the *shu* presented before the master begins with a narrative, followed by parallel prose in four-six rhythm, which is not the ancient form of *shu*. Therefore, adhering to antiquity, one should follow the example of addressing the Crown Prince and various princes by using *jian*, which does not contravene ritual and strikes a proper balance.

According to the *Wen Xuan*, there are nine *jian* petitions from the Jin and Liang dynasties. Two of these are addressed to the Supreme Emperor, where the writer refers to himself as "your subject," beginning with "Your subject so-and-so respectfully states" and concluding with "Death penalty, death penalty." The remaining petitions to the imperial court’s chief ministers and various princes do not use "your subject," and their openings and closures are uniform, without any "middle thanks." As for the *jian* format in the Song dynasty’s official regulations, it resembles today’s *biao* memorials, only replacing "kowtow" with "knock head" and omitting "your subject." Following my master’s transmission, I use memorial documents only when submitting petitions before the Celestial Emperor; all other enumerated documents employ *jian*. Upon comprehensive examination of ancient and modern formats, I adopt the example of addressing the Crown Prince, using *jian* with "your subject." If one follows the old Jin and Liang style, it should be in unadorned prose. Alternatively, if conforming to current practice, parallel prose may be used. Either approach is acceptable, provided it adheres to classical norms and avoids impropriety. To treat master and disciple as equals in status is improper; the language should be concise and direct, avoiding irreverence. If one pursues ornate rhetoric, stringing together allusions like the memorials and petitions of secular courts, this violates Daoist canons and betrays the original intent of responding to heaven with sincerity.

What I, Yunzhong, have compiled here serves provisional use and is not presumed to be a fixed format. Those of great talent, broad learning, and mastery of ritual teachings may refine it with profound, elegant, and vigorous prose—this would be most fortunate.

**Six Formats for Petitions to the Six Altar Platforms**

**Petition to the Mystic Master**
Your subject [Name] respectfully states: On the [Day] of this month, for [Person] I am conducting the [Name] Retreat for [Purpose], and now humbly establish the altar platform.

I have heard that when the Dragon Han unfolded the celestial charts, it embraced the ancestral *qi* of the ten thousand heavens. When the Vermilion Brightness inaugurated its destiny, it arrayed the luminous canons of the Three Caverns. Having expanded the means of salvation, the forms of retreat observance were established. Following the master’s teachings, I reverently knock upon the gates of heaven.

Your subject, unworthy and insignificant, presumptuously oversees the ritual canons. Unfurling the altar and unfolding the rites, I exhaustively fulfill the retreat’s covenant. Listing the articles and transcribing the words, I lay forth my earnest sentiments. Moreover, upholding devout sincerity, I respectfully adhere to the protocol of court memorials. Were it not for relying upon the master’s compassion, how could I ascend to the imperial threshold?

With reverence, I consider...

The Venerable Celestial Master of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Master, the Serene Elderly Heavenly Worthy—his Dao equals that of Heaven and Earth, his transformation parallels yin and yang. He refines and molds the ten thousand images yet does not claim merit for himself; he instructs and nurtures the Three Powers, and all beings receive his beneficence. Gazing down, he perceives the utmost sincerity of those who present retreat petitions, never deviating from the original intent of establishing the teachings. He guides the foolish and deluded, compassionately pitying those pressed by karmic deeds. May the memorial’s words ascend, safeguarding the retreat’s integrity from demonic interference. May this single-minded devotion rise to reach the hearing of the Ninefold Heaven.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

Your subject, [Name], knocks his head in awe, trembling with fear of deathly transgression, and respectfully speaks.

In the year [Year], the cyclical year being [Stem-Branch], on the [Day] day of the [Month] month, the duly ordained ritual officer, your subject [Surname and Name], presents this memorial.

I address the Five Emperors:

Your subject [Name] states: On the [Day] day of this [Month] month, on behalf of [Person’s Name], I have established the [Name] Retreat for the purpose of [Matter]. Having now prepared the altar with the preliminary rites, I declare:

I have heard that in the primordial chaos, the origin was endowed, and the Three *qi* coalesced to form the true. In the vast expanse, forms were fashioned, and the Five Directions were established as guardians. They oversee the records of merit and transgression, wielding the authority to reward and punish. Relying upon their sheltering grace, I dare to present my earnest plea.

Reflecting upon myself, I was born of impure dust and received a dull and foolish nature. Yet, by chance, I have relied upon past karmic conditions and obtained the shade of the profound. Having received the teachings of the Orthodox and True, I dare to propagate the canons of salvation. I solemnly prepare the altar and perform the morning rites, arranging the words of the memorial to present my plea. Were I not to implore the scrutiny of the celestial records, how could I achieve spiritual resonance?

With reverence, I consider the Central Yellow Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Northern Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Western White Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Southern Red Emperor Heavenly Lord, and the Eastern Bluegreen Emperor Heavenly Lord. From the wondrous kalpas of the beginning, they fused the divine and transformed the primordial. Assisting Heaven and Earth, they uphold the Pole Star; grasping the workings of creation, they govern the directions. Their grace permeates the ten thousand beings, their benefits extend to all classes of existence. May they embody the sincerity of my prayers and bring to fruition the merit of this retreat. May my earnest devotion ascend to the Nine Heavens, and may their benevolent influence widely moisten the Six Directions. May the hundred spirits fulfill their duties, and may the Ten Lands radiate their light.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

I, your humble servant [Name], kowtow in reverent fear, dreading the gravity of my transgressions, and respectfully submit this memorial.

In the year [Year], month [Month], and day [Day], I, [Name], a duly ordained Daoist officiant, present this memorial.

To the Three Officials,

I, your humble servant [Name], declare: On the [Day] of this month, I shall conduct the [Name] Retreat on behalf of [Person] for the purpose of [Matter]. Tonight, I humbly establish the altar and commence the rites.

I have heard that the utmost benevolence unfolds the teachings, bestowing the luminous statutes of salvation and deliverance. The Great Dao proclaims compassion, arraying the scriptures of retreat and cultivation. Thus, the blessings of humans and heavens are shared alike, and the hidden and manifest realms together know repose. I have recorded these humble circumstances and now present them before your profound scrutiny.

I reflect with awe upon my own foolish and impure nature, my humble and mediocre endowments. Though I have long been touched by good causes and molded by the transformative power of the True, I am ashamed by the paucity of my talents and the dimness of my understanding. To conduct the Dao and establish the retreat is to presume upon the foremost office; to deliver the living and ferry the dead, I fear, may scarcely reach the lofty heavens. Without relying on your completion and perfection, how could this endeavor be brought to fruition?

With utmost reverence, I invoke the Lower Prime Water Official Emperor Lord, the Middle Prime Earth Official Emperor Lord, and the Upper Prime Heaven Official Emperor Lord. You govern the revolutions of the ten thousand transformations and hold sway over the Three Spirits. All living beings are subject to your oversight, and every good deed is recorded in your registers. Now, at the very inception of this retreat and covenant, I dare to petition the offices of your examination and judgment. May my plea ascend to the Nine Heavens and be made known.

May the Three Realms pardon transgressions and forgive faults, that the retreat’s uprightness remain untainted by demonic forces, and the refining of souls and cultivation of spirits deliver those sunk in darkness. May the celestial retinue pause in its procession to look upon the merit of this retreat.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

Your humble servant [Name], kowtowing in awe and dread of mortal offense, respectfully states:

On the [Day] of this [Month], [Year], I, [Name], a duly appointed ritual officer, submit this memorial.

To the Heavenly Master:
Your servant [Name] declares: On the [Day] of this month, I shall establish a retreat on behalf of [Person] for the purpose of [Matter], beginning tonight with the opening of the altar.

I have heard that when the turning of the Dao aligns with the true season, it spreads numinous winds to nurture all things. When heaven unfolds its divine transformations, it magnifies the supreme Way to bequeath its texts. Illuminating the canonical rites, it perfects past and present. Thus, I humbly invoke your compassionate protection to inaugurate this pure precinct.

Reflecting on my long-standing karmic affinity with goodness, I have early been steeped in your gracious blessings. Yet ashamed that my merits remain unestablished, I recall that salvation and deliverance demand diligence. Moreover, moved by the earnest entreaties of the sponsor, I dare to present this petition.

In accordance with the standards of the canonical statutes, I shall exhaust my efforts in reverent observance. Truly, I rely on your guidance to hope for a response that pierces through.

With utmost reverence, I invoke the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, the Rectifier of the Dao, the Pacifier of Primordial Qi, the Illustrious and Protective Perfected Lord. Born of the purest essence of the Dao and endowed with the most potent of numinous qi, your merit has saved the world in its myriad directions, and your office attends the imperial throne of the Three Realms. You refine and shape the unlearned, guiding and drawing forth those yet to come, ever expanding the reach of your teaching. May you deign to record the sincerity of this retreat.

I pray that my words ascend to the celestial palaces, that your decrees be issued to the terrestrial bureaus, that the officers and lords of the Three Caverns’ registers be dispatched, and that the generals and functionaries of the ten directions’ scriptural and disciplinary codes be commanded to receive the talismans and carry out the orders, opening the Dao and unsealing the passes. May the retreat’s uprightness be perfected, and may both the hidden and the manifest realms attain radiant peace.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

Your humble servant [Name], kowtowing in awe and dread of mortal offense, respectfully states:

On the [Day] of this [Month], [Year], I, [Name], a duly appointed ritual officer, submit this memorial.

To the Three Masters:
Your servant [Name] declares: On the [Day] of this month, I shall establish a retreat on behalf of [Person] for the purpose of [Matter], beginning tonight with the opening of the altar.

I have heard that when the turning of the Dao inaugurates the profound mystery, it arrays the myriad paths to spread transformation. When auspicious signs open the Three Caverns, they gather the host of subtle wonders to radiate their splendor. Illuminating the canonical rites, they expand the compass of the model. Presumptuously trusting in my foolish sincerity, I venture to appeal to the numinous offices.

Reflecting that in delivering the hidden and protecting the manifest, no merit precedes that of retreat blessings, and that the enumeration of merits and the listing of petitions fall under the jurisdiction of the Masters’ domain, I now, in accordance with steadfast devotion, consult the ancient canons. To hope for a response, I must rely on your compassionate consideration.

With utmost reverence, I invoke the Perfected Lord of the Registers of the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Lord of the Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, and the Perfected Lord of the Scriptures and Disciplines of the Numinous Treasure. From the inception of the teaching, you have bequeathed the codes for eternal kalpas. The transmission of the Dao’s registers and the multitude of texts on its methods and talismans have accumulated through your scriptures and registers. May you, in your profound and far-reaching benevolence, take pity on later learners.

I pray that you may specially dispatch the true chariot to pause at the imperial altar. May the retreat’s uprightness be brought to completion, and may the memorial’s words ascend to the throne.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

Your humble servant [Name], kowtowing in awe and dread of mortal offense, respectfully states:

On the [Day] of this [Month], [Year], I, [Name], a duly appointed ritual officer, submit this memorial.

To the Inspector of the Retreat:
Your servant [Name] declares: On the [Day] of this month, I shall establish a retreat on behalf of [Person] for the purpose of [Matter], beginning tonight with the opening of the altar.

I have heard that when the Dao unfolds its subtle codes, it establishes the standards for retreat observances. When the teaching spreads its true blessings, it divides the offices of canonical oversight. Affairs are entrusted to the offices of the mysterious, and sincerity is grounded in the humble petitions of mortals. I earnestly implore your profound scrutiny to record this retreat’s covenant.

Reflecting that I, a mere clod of dust bound in the web of illusion, have been granted a dull and obscure nature, fundamentally lacking in discernment, I have presumptuously stained the ranks of the mysterious. Yet, having received the wholehearted devotion of the retreat’s sponsor, I reverently strive to fulfill the ritual currents and present my petition. I pray for the joint deliverance of the manifest and the hidden, that distant and near may alike partake of your blessings. Without relying on your oversight, how could this endeavor be accomplished?

With utmost reverence, I invoke the Great Dharma Master and Perfected Lord, Inspector of the Numinous Treasure Retreat. Having refined the true through countless kalpas, you have magnified transformation across the myriad directions. Your grace universally permeates the paths of the lost, and your beneficence broadly encompasses later learners. May you briefly halt your celestial retinue, that a thousand spirits may guard the mysterious altar. May you slightly rouse the canonical rites, that the Three Qi fill the Dharma realm.

With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.

Prostrate, I, your humble servant [Name], bow my head in trepidation, dreading the gravity of my transgressions, and respectfully submit this memorial.

In the year [Year], the month [Month], and the day [Day], I, [Name], a dharma-officiant of the ordained rank, present this memorial.

**Six Memorials of Gratitude for the Dispersal of the Six Canopies of the Altar**
**Memorial of Gratitude to the Mysterious Master**

I, your humble servant [Name], declare: On the [Day] of this month, I presided over the establishment of the [Name] Retreat for [Name of Patron], which has now been brought to perfect completion.

I have heard that Heaven covers the ten thousand beings, and even the dust-like ignorant rely upon its nurturing transformation. The teachings emerge from the Nine Purities, and both the hidden and the manifest alike receive deliverance through their unfolding. Thus, I, a latecomer to learning, have been enabled to complete the retreat’s observances. Daring to exhaust my mortal devotion, I offer this memorial to the lofty hearing of the Perfected.

Reflecting in awe, I recognize that in erecting the altar and performing the Dao, I must rely upon the canonical rites. In invoking the spirits and contemplating the Perfected, I have surely fallen short of the standard forms. My conduct is base and my understanding shallow; my actions and restraints are coarse and careless. My nature is dull and my knowledge dim; my words and compositions are profane and irreverent. Though the rites have now been completed, I am mindful of the many transgressions I have committed. Beating my breast in self-reproach, I search my heart and find it wanting.

With utmost reverence, I contemplate the Great Dharma Master, Master of the Mysterious Teachings: your merit transcends the Ten Poles, and your rank is arrayed among the Three Heavens. You regulate the principles of yin and yang, and your grace universally permeates the Six Directions. You sustain the workings of creation, and your teachings broadly extend across the ten thousand directions. Thus, even one as insignificant as a blade of grass or a speck of dust may presumptuously shelter beneath the protection of your august authority.

I humbly beseech you to bestow your great compassion and graciously extend your merciful regard. May you forgive my profound faults and expunge my name from the registers of the Five Emperors and the Four Offices. May you perceive the sincerity of my mortal devotion and deliver the souls in the Three Paths and Nine Hells. May your beneficence extend without end, and your grace reach all sentient beings.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

The humble servant [Name] knocks his head to the ground, trembling with fear of the deathly offense, and respectfully states:

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], the duly ordained servant of the Daoist rites, [Name], presents this memorial.

**Memorial of Gratitude to the Five Emperors**

The servant [Name] declares: On the [Day] of this month, on behalf of [Name], I conducted the [Name] Ritual Fast, which has now been successfully completed.

I have heard that the primordial radiance of the Mystic Vastness stirs the numinous mechanism of transformation. As the boundless deliverance of humanity is its aim, so the salvation of the world has its scriptures. By the grace of the canonical records, I have been permitted to complete the rites of the Ritual Fast. Daring to exhaust my humble sincerity, I offer this to continue the numinous majesty.

Reflecting upon myself, I am of base constitution, endowed with meager and foolish faculties. My dull self has presumptuously assumed the talismans and registers, yet my learning has not attained mastery of the canonical texts. Though I have pledged my heart in solemn vows, the urgency of my devotion could not be restrained. Through the recitation of words and the display of reverence, the ritual assembly was brought to its conclusion. I am ashamed that no merit can be recorded, and only transgressions accumulate to be feared. Without beseeching compassionate aid, I cannot hope for pardon.

With reverence, I contemplate:
The **August Sovereign of the Central Yellow Emperor**,
The **August Sovereign of the Northern Black Emperor**,
The **August Sovereign of the Western White Emperor**,
The **August Sovereign of the Southern Red Emperor**,
The **August Sovereign of the Eastern Bluegreen Emperor**.

Each shares in the true division of the Dao and follows the celestial inception of purity. They examine the promotion and demotion of the ten thousand spirits and govern the circulation of the five qi. All mortal dust is embraced within their compassionate embrace, and both the hidden and manifest depend upon their nurturing care.

I humbly pray that the meager blessings of this Ritual Fast may be inscribed, and that the profound offenses of transgression may be graciously pardoned. May the suffering souls ascend and their spirits be transformed, bringing clarity and peace to the Six Heavens. May all living beings fulfill their nature and the ten thousand kinds attain tranquility and peace.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

Your Majesty,

I, [Name], prostrate myself in awe and dread, acknowledging my mortal offenses, and respectfully submit this memorial.

On the [Day] of this [Month] in the year [Year], I, [Name], a duly appointed ritual officer, present this memorial in gratitude to the Three Officials.

I, [Name], declare that on the [Day] of this month, I conducted the [Name] Ritual Fast on behalf of [Name], which has now been successfully completed.

I have heard that the jade altar’s solemn rites have already received the grace of divine regard, and the sacred tablets have returned, bearing the fullness of our prayers. Offering the prescribed texts and presenting our pleas, I humbly beseech that your sacred attention be bestowed anew.

Reflecting upon myself, I am but a humble vessel of this degenerate age, a student of dust-laden toil. My thoughts lack coherence, leaving me ignorant of the steps toward cultivation. My countless transgressions remain unexpiated—how could I presume to master the canons of ritual fasting? Merely following the forms to perform the rites, I fear my errors may violate the proper standards. Knowing well that punishment is inescapable, I dare yet lay bare my sincerity and confess my faults.

With reverence, I invoke the **Lower Prime Water Official Emperor**, the **Middle Prime Earth Official Emperor**, and the **Upper Prime Heaven Official Emperor**, who govern the Nine Treasuries and oversee the Three Primes. All spirits and mortals are subject to their judgment, and both the hidden and manifest depend upon their molding power. Moved by this foolish ignorance, they grant forbearance, pardoning the grave offenses of ritual failure and forgiving the many faults of those who fasted together. May their mercy extend throughout the Three Realms, inscribing the merits of this Ritual Fast. May their blessings spread across the Ten Directions, universally elevating the lingering souls.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

Your Majesty,

I, [Name], prostrate myself in awe and dread, acknowledging the gravity of my transgressions, and humbly submit this memorial.

On the [Day] of this [Month] in the year [Year], I, [Name], a duly ordained Ritual Master, present this memorial in gratitude to the Heavenly Master.

I, [Name], declare: On the [Day] of this month, I conducted the [Name] Ritual Fast on behalf of [Name], which has now been successfully completed.

I have heard that the primordial net unfolds its mysteries, establishing the statutes for delivering the hidden and guiding the world. The true teachings bequeath their scriptures, enumerating the ranks of ritual fasts for the cultivation of affairs. Thus, even the unlearned may fulfill their virtuous endeavors.

Reflecting upon myself, I recognize that my being has not yet penetrated the true, nor is my talent sufficient to fathom the principles of things. In reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao, I merely adhere to the established norms. Yet in transgressing prohibitions and failing in ritual propriety, I have truly fallen short of the perfected canon.

It is only by the forbearance of the Venerable Master that the guilt of my humble and coarse nature may be pardoned.

With reverence, I invoke the **Great Law Master of the Three Heavens, Who Upholds the Dao and Assists the Primordial, Orthodox Unity, Serene Response, Manifest Protection, Perfected Lord**—born of celestial vision, refined upon the cloud terrace. Moved by the jade bureau’s repeated descents, he transmitted the thousand-scroll treasury of the jade caskets. May he take pity on this humble talent and further expand his vast vows. May he support both the hidden and manifest, bending to record merits. By bestowing grace and pardoning transgressions, may he prevent this ritual fast from becoming a source of fault.

May all sentient beings together realize the unconditioned.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

I, [Name], prostrate myself in awe and dread, acknowledging the gravity of my transgressions, and humbly submit this memorial.

On the [Day] of this [Month] in the year [Year], I, [Name], a duly ordained Ritual Master, present this memorial in gratitude to the Three Masters.

I, [Name], declare: On the [Day] of this month, I conducted the [Name] Ritual Fast on behalf of [Name], which has now been successfully completed.

I have heard that the wondrous root is wordless, yet adapts its teachings to the capacities of beings. The primordial pivot establishes its models, responding to the world with the proclamation of compassion. Through the vastness of its canonical principles, it enables the accomplishment of ritual fasts.

Unworthy as I am, I dare to offer my sincere prayers once more.

Reflecting upon myself, I, though base and insignificant, have presumptuously received the mandate of transformation and nurturance. Gazing upon my own foolish and mediocre nature, I have overstepped my place in the office of deliverance. Erecting the altar, burning incense, and reciting scriptures, I have presented memorials to deliver the hidden and manifest. Fortunately, the ritual proceedings have been completed, yet I am ashamed that from beginning to end, I have violated the statutes.

Without the grace of the Masters, how could I escape the unseen retribution?

With reverence, I invoke the **Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure, Master of Salvation**; the **Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure, Master of the Registers**; and the **Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure, Master of the Scriptures**. They uphold the celestial canon and propagate the Dao, transmitting the true. Their pure transformation is inexhaustible, and their divine blessings are boundless. May they bend to pity this unworthy student, expunging the records of sin and pardoning transgressions. May they deign to record the sincerity of this fast, inscribing its merits and manifesting its beneficent influence. May the Ten Directions share in the rejoicing, and may the Nine Nights receive their blessings.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

Your Majesty, I, [Name], kowtow in trepidation, dreading the gravity of my transgressions, and respectfully submit this memorial.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], I, [Name], a duly ordained ritual officer, present this memorial in gratitude for the oversight of the fast.

I, [Name], declare: On the [Day] of this month, on behalf of [Name], I conducted the [Name] Fast, which has now been successfully completed.

I have heard that establishing rites and unfolding affairs must adhere to the regulations of fasting rectitude. Following the teachings and performing the rituals truly depend on the grace of divine observation. Daring to persist in my foolish sincerity, I venture to offer this devotion to the numinous compassion. Reflecting humbly, I recognize my lifelong lack of talent, yet have been fortunate to receive the shelter of the mysterious. Unversed in the canonical protocols, I have presumptuously occupied a rank in the ministry of salvation. My mindfulness has not been true, and I have wrongly held the office of register and transmission. Though I have striven to complete the rites, I am alarmed by the depth of my transgressions and deviations. Relying entirely on your merciful forbearance, I hasten to express my repentance and gratitude.

With reverence, I invoke the **Perfected Lord, Grand Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure, Overseer of the Fast**, who presides over the standards of ritual and the records of the teachings. Having already received the accomplishment of meritorious deeds, I still pray for the remission of severe punishments. May the memorial ascend to the Nine Poles, and the petitions be conveyed to all bureaus. May the blessings of the fast be boundless, and the true felicity universally bestowed. May all the assembled ritual participants have their records of transgressions expunged, and may all beings under heaven partake in the joy of life.

With reverence, I present this memorial in gratitude, to make known my plea.

Prostrate and trembling, I, your humble servant [Name], bow my head in fear of capital offense and respectfully submit this memorial.

In the year [Year], the [Month] day, I, [Name], a dharma-officiant of the ordained rank, present this memorial.

Having duly followed and examined Du Guangcheng’s *Ritual Regulations for the Fast*, I have arranged the sequence of the Six Canopies. After weighing ancient and modern canonical rites, I have therefore employed this memorial format.

Now, the Five Emperors of recent times are often conflated with the Five Venerable Lords of the Supreme, and their positions are thus assigned to such figures as the Azure Numinous First Elder Heavenly Lord of the East. Yet the Five Qi abide in the midst of Heaven as the Five Venerable Lords of the Supreme; in celestial patterns, they are the Five Planets; on earth, the Five Marchmounts; in affairs, the Five Constants; in things, the Five Phases; among spirits, the Five Emperors—such as the Azure Emperor of the East, the Majestic Numinous One, and the like; and in humans, the Five Viscera. Truly, the Five Qi are present in all things without exception.

However, the Five Venerable Lords of the Supreme are the root and origin of the Five Qi, the Supreme Lords in the midst of Heaven. If the scrutiny of mortals’ merits and transgressions and the recording of worldly blessings and misfortunes were to be their concern, it would be unfitting for the Heavenly Emperors to descend to such tasks. Thus, when the Master of the Mysterious Center oversees the teachings’ standards, it is the Three Officials and Five Emperors who examine merits and transgressions—these Five Emperors are in fact but functionaries of the Three Realms.

As for the Azure Emperor of the East, Majestic Numinous One; the Vermilion Emperor of the South, Blazing Fury; the White Emperor of the West, White Summoner of Measures; the Black Emperor of the North, Exhaling Radiance and Discipline; and the Yellow Emperor of the Center, Containing the Pivotal Axis—these are glossed in older scriptures as the Five Venerable Lords, though this identification is already questionable. Moreover, the attribution of the Azure Emperor to spring, the Vermilion Emperor to summer, and so forth, refers to the Five Directional Emperors, who should be ranked alongside the Three Officials as examiners.

Beyond these, the positions of the Five Emperors are not limited to these alone. Weighing the matter carefully, the altar for the fast should only employ the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center, for this is the most universally applicable arrangement. There is no need to fix the Five Venerable Lords of the Supreme as the definitive model.

Furthermore, earlier scholars have debated the Five Emperors without reaching a settled interpretation. Since the oversight of covenant fasts is the duty of the Three Realms’ functionaries, their positions lie below the Master of the Mysterious Center and are ranked alongside the Three Officials—this makes it all the more improper to definitively equate them with the Five Venerable Lords of the Supreme. Those well-versed in the scriptures and teachings should examine this further. This matter is also addressed in the sequence of ranks for the Offering and Thanksgiving Rites to the Sage.

Here ends the twenty-sixth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure*.
Beginning the twenty-seventh scroll of the *Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure*.

The Master of Rituals of the Southern Bureau of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure, Compiler Jin Yunzhong of the Right Wing Office of the Initial Repository of the Authority of Youth, presents the section on *Memorials, Petitions, and Edicts*:

The gateways to immortality are manifold, yet establishing merit to succor the world stands foremost. Thus, those who practice the registers and observances of the Dao must exert themselves in the teachings and precepts. Since they have yet to attain communion with the perfected and penetration of the numinous, whenever petitions are made, they must rely upon written memorials and edicts. These must be reasoned in their wording and flawless in their adherence to canonical forms. Just as memorials to the imperial court follow fixed formats, how much more should reverence be shown to the August Heavenly Thearch, the Boundless and Most Honored? To act recklessly or profane the sacred would be unthinkable. Those who preside over fasts and offerings bear the duty of proclaiming and conveying sincerity, aiding and delivering both the hidden and the manifest. Though they must be versed in the teachings and precepts, they must also possess some mastery of literary expression. Moreover, in the Great Yellow Register Fast, revered by both humans and heavens, everything depends upon the high priest’s conception and phrasing. They must not blindly follow vulgar sentiments, carelessly preparing memorials that obstruct reason and make resonance impossible. Within the precepts and methods, matters must first be reported through memorials and petitions, hence these are provided here in accordance with ritual use and may not be omitted.

**Memorial Format**
[Official Title] Your subject [Name], with awe and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice to memorialize:

Your subject, having considered the matter, respectfully records the petition and memorializes [Name of August Thearch] the Jade Sovereign of [Realm].

Your subject humbly beseeches the Heavenly Compassion to grant this petition and specially bestow its implementation.

Your subject, having presumptuously offended the Heavenly Majesty, is filled with terror and dread, awaiting punishment. Respectfully memorialized.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], [Official Title] Your subject [Name] memorializes.

This memorial format is seldom used among common people, and in the Zhe region, its form is particularly unknown. Master Yunzhong transmitted this lineage, which has been practiced for a long time, yet it is employed only for the Three Clarities Thearchs and the August Thearch of the Northern Culmen of Primordial Heaven. The Three Clarities Heavenly Worthies are the Three Qi of the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Origin—root and source of the myriad transformations, ancestors of the Three Realms. They give birth to Heaven and Earth, initiate yin and yang, formless and nameless, unfathomable and unknowable, styled as Heavenly Worthies, a designation given by necessity. As for the August Thearch of Vast Heaven, He governs the myriad heavens, commands the ten thousand spirits, and corresponds above to the Mysterious Qi. The Great Thearch of the Northern Culmen records the myriad stars, serving as the pivot of Heaven, corresponding above to the Primordial Qi. The Heavenly Thearch appears in the celestial patterns beneath the Curved Array, ranked below the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, corresponding above to the Origin Qi. Beyond the Three Realms and within the Six Ultimates, none are more exalted. Thus, this memorial format, resembling the opening text of a memorial, is not to be treated with the casual familiarity of worldly etiquette. Therefore, the requests made therein are not to be verbose; one merely petitions for the bestowal and implementation of the matter.

When making offerings, before the Thearch, one may simply state: "It is desired that the Heavenly Grace deign to take note." This suffices.

The *tie-huang* (attached yellow slip) is placed to the right of the official title, with its lines aligned in spacing to match those of the memorial. It is affixed level with the "上言" ("memorializes") line, using an odd number of characters. At the end of the memorial, the *yi-huang* (supporting yellow slip) states: "Petitioning the relevant True Bureau to bestow and implement." It is affixed to the right of the date, extending upward to the *tie-huang*, and sealed with an impression, following the format of worldly memorials.

**Inner Envelope**
To the Jade Sovereign of [Name] Thearch,
Respectfully sealed by [Official Title] Your subject [Name].

**Outer Envelope**
Memorial Petition Respectfully Submitted to
[Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully seals.

To the Heavenly Pivot Bureau under the Three Heavens.

The outer envelope may also read: "Memorial Petition Respectfully Submitted to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau under the Three Heavens for presentation." Alternatively, a separate petition may be submitted to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau, called an *Introduction Petition*. If sending a single document, it is enclosed within the memorial envelope; if multiple documents are sent, the petitions are listed separately and enclosed in another envelope for submission to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau. This is analogous to worldly memorials being separately submitted to the Chancellery.

**Petition to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau**
[Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully states:

Regarding [Matter], the petition is hereby recorded and memorialized to the Heavenly Court. It is necessary to report as follows:

Respectfully submitted to the High Perfected who govern the Three Heavens under the Heavenly Pivot Bureau. May the True Compassion of the common hope deign to facilitate its presentation and implementation.

Your subject, having presumptuously offended the True Majesty, is filled with terror and dread. Respectfully submitted.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], [Official Title] Your subject [Name] submits.

Upon examining the canonical teachings, Master Yunzhong found that while some aspects of the High Heavenly Governance may be known, others remain unfathomable. Without thorough penetration of the Jade Clarity and direct audience before the Golden Gate, one must not presume to conjecture or fabricate names and ranks. Thus, in the celestial bureaus and ministries, one refers only to "the High Perfected who govern," avoiding transgression of prohibitions. The orthodox canons do not specify these, and the transmitted texts of incantations circulating in the world cannot be relied upon.

Among the celestial ranks, the Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Thearchs, Dao Lords, Primordial Ladies, and Heavenly Lords—such as the Heavenly Worthy and Heavenly Thearch—are proper canonical titles. For instance, the Dao Lord of the Luminous August of the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity is one such title. The Primordial Ladies, such as the Primordial Lady Ancestress of the Myriad Qi, are of the same rank as the Heavenly Thearchs. All these may use the memorial format, following the style of worldly memorials.

In recent times, transmitted ritual texts have arbitrarily established names and ranks for the Highest Perfected, which cannot be enumerated here and are not to be followed. For example, addressing the Celestial Master as "Heavenly Lord" or calling the Jade Maidens of Soul-Summoning "Primordial Ladies" creates even greater disorder in the canonical system. One must not be misled into error. Beware, beware.

**Memorial Format**
[Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully states:

Your subject, having considered the matter, respectfully records the petition and memorializes [Name of August Thearch] the Sovereign.

It is desired that the Heavenly Compassion grant this petition and specially bestow [specific action].

Your subject, having presumptuously offended the Heavenly Majesty, is filled with terror and dread, trembling in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], [Official Title] Your subject [Name] memorializes.

The previously affixed yellow slips, along with secular legal documents, shall be submitted to the respective palaces and courts as designated. If not recorded in the orthodox canon, no palace or court names may be fabricated. Some seek to distinguish themselves from others, deceiving the common folk, yet they fail to realize they profane the celestial symbols and invite divine punishment upon themselves. Fools who imitate them lead later learners further astray. Strict adherence to antiquity is thus imperative.

In secular memorials, the format typically begins with the official’s title and name, followed by the matter at hand, and concludes with the right-aligned submission. Daoist practitioners have recently adopted this, fully conforming to the secular style.

**Secular Memorial Format**
[Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully states:

In accordance with the prescribed form or the petition’s intent, this matter requires submission for Your August Majesty’s consideration.

Having recorded the above, it is desired that the True Compassion grant this petition and specially bestow [specific action]. Respectfully submitted for Your Majesty’s decree, awaiting the imperial edict.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], [Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully memorializes.

**Alternative Secular Format**
[Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully states:

Having recorded the petition’s intent, this matter is respectfully submitted for Your Majesty’s consideration. Respectfully submitted.

In the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], [Official Title] Your subject [Name] respectfully submits.

The yellow slips before and after shall follow the standard format. However, in secular formats, only Daoist memorials vary in the titles of the August Thearchs, making it difficult to ascertain proper transmission. In recent times, these two formats have been widely used, with the addition of sacred titles, differing only slightly from secular conventions. The memorial style described herein is employed solely by the Yundun lineage. Those who follow secular customs often adopt this format for practical purposes.

The celestial ranks—palaces of the sun, courts of the moon, the Five Stars and Four Luminaries, the Northern Dipper and Three Officials, the Four Saints and Five Masters, the High Celestial Assistants, the Noble Ministers of the Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Bureaus’ directors, and the various offices of the upper realms—all employ petitions (*shenzhuang*).

It is said that the rituals of fasts and offerings, the protocols of proclamations, and the documents of memorials and announcements bear no trivial consequences. Yet in recent practice, memorials (*zoudu*) are used even for the Seven Primes, Five Masters, and the celestial ranks of the upper realms. Even the Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau has adopted memorials. This blind imitation of secular court titles, arbitrarily assigning exalted ranks to the perfected, is a grave profanation.

Take, for instance, the Master of the Mysterious Center (*Xuanzhong Fashi*). Though revered as the founder of ritual teachings, he remains a subject before Heaven. Some claim he is Lord Lao’s incarnate manifestation, yet no orthodox canon records this. Even if he were indeed Lord Lao’s transformed emanation, he could not be honored as an emperor. For the Primordial Qi resides in the Great Clarity, where he is the Heavenly Venerable. If he assumes a form to propagate teachings, he is called the Master of the Mysterious Center—a subject of the Three Realms.

Lord Lao, who established the Dao before Heaven and delivered beings across kalpas, cannot be fully recounted. In the Zhou dynasty, he served as the Archivist Under the Pillars, concealing his name and assuming a mortal guise to save humanity, disregarding rank. At that time, he was but a subject of the Zhou court. Yet when his purple qi crossed the pass, his blue ox returned to the celestial gates, and he consolidated his true form in the highest heavens, assuming his rightful place in the Great Clarity, he was then called the Heavenly Emperor or Supreme Thearch. Thus, when he manifested to serve the Zhou court, he did not deem it lowly; when his qi returned to the celestial heights to rule the upper realms, he did not consider it exalted. His being resides between wondrous existence and wondrous non-existence, and he may be named according to his manifestations.

As the Heavenly Venerable of the Dao and Virtue, he is the sovereign of Heaven and thus warrants memorials (*zhangzou*). As the Great Master of the Mysterious Center, he is a subject of Heaven and thus warrants petitions (*shenzhuang*). To directly equate the Master of the Mysterious Center with Lord Lao is incorrect. Some further err by calling him the Heavenly Venerable of Serene Old Age (*Jinglao Tianzun*), which is even more absurd.

The Three Treasures of Dao, scriptures, and masters: the Dao cannot be named, so teachings are established through scriptures. Once teachings are set, they are transmitted only by masters. Within the fast altars, the fundamental lineage must be revered. Thus, from the Dao come the scriptures, and from the scriptures come the masters. It is not that their rank among the Three Treasures elevates them to the status of the Supreme Thearch.

The old *Luotian* Offering Rites, later revised during the Song dynasty, were compiled by the Daoist Registry after consulting canonical standards. Even then, the Five Masters’ positions were placed below the Three Officials, Four Saints, and the assembled perfected. The Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master must not be misrepresented.

According to records, the Heavenly Master was born during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han at Mount Tianmu in Wu. Later, a Temple of the Divine Immortals was established there. In the second year of *Yongshou* of the Han, he ascended to the heavens in Shu. The Supreme Lord dispatched envoys of the Five Emperors to confer upon him the title of Orthodox Unity Perfected, facing the Ninefold Clarity and serving as a subject of the Three Realms. This is clearly documented in his biographies and scriptures.

In the rituals of fasts and offerings, the master is the fundamental lineage, and establishing a separate tent for him is proper etiquette. In documents, petitions (*shendu*) should be used, deferring to the Heavenly Emperor. How can one submit memorials before both sovereign and subject alike? Can the Heavenly Master and the Jade Emperor be equated? On the day of the Heavenly Master’s ascension, his rank was merely that of a Perfected. Only during the Song dynasty was he posthumously honored as the Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, which already elevated his celestial rank. Some further address him as the Heavenly Lord (*Tianjun*), equating him with the Heavenly Emperor.

The Heavenly Lords of the Three Qi—Celestial Treasure of Pure Tenuity, Numinous Treasure of Jade Clarity, and Divine Treasure of Great Red—are the Three Qi Heavenly Lords. The Azure Spirit Elder of the East, along with those of the West, South, North, and Center, are the Five Directions’ Heavenly Lords. Can the Heavenly Master share this rank?

The Heavenly Master transmitted and mastered the scriptures, delving deeply into the Nine Schools and Hundred Philosophies. His merits accomplished and conduct illustrious, he was summoned to ascend to Heaven. His adherence to ritual propriety and rank was most precise. Yet now, witnessing the flattery and obsequiousness of foolish men, who address him as Heavenly Lord in their memorials—how can the celestial ranks not be enraged?

Yet I fear such memorials may never reach the celestial realms. That the ignorant dare act thus is truly alarming. The names and ranks of the highest Perfected are not for the world to presume to detail. To follow the ancient canons in their use is proper; but to indulge in excessive titles—calling a Perfected One a True Lord, a True Lord a Heavenly Lord, or a messenger a mere "envoy"—is to brazenly violate the celestial prohibitions.

In the upper realms, the most revered among male Perfected are called Dao Lords, and the most revered among female Perfected are called Yuan Ladies, akin to the various Heavenly Worthies. Yet in this age, men know only how to fabricate extravagant titles, even to the point of addressing female lords with the honorifics due a Dao Lord. Moreover, for ranks unattested in the scriptures, they claim on their own authority that so-and-so is the Perfected Overseer of such-and-such an abbey, that so-and-so presides over such-and-such a ministry, or that so-and-so governs the Celestial Bureau—whatever their whim desires, they arbitrarily promote the celestial offices and the sagely ranks, then boast of their own exceptional usage. Alas, the world may be deceived, but can Heaven be deceived?

The celestial bureaucracy’s divisions and appointments are far stricter than those of the mortal realm. Hence the saying among divine immortals: "The upper realms are replete with offices and courts." Not even the slightest transgression is permissible, yet mediocre men dare to recklessly profane and desecrate. I have personally witnessed those who engage in such practices, and they are not without karmic retribution—yet those who remain heedless are still many.

Now, when addressing the celestial ranks in memorials, one uses the term "your servant." Some argue that if one uses "your servant," one should employ the formal "memorial," and if one uses "memorial," one should not use "your servant." In my humble opinion, during the Three Dynasties, vassals addressing the lords of other states all used "your servant," and even when addressing the Son of Heaven, they used "your servant." Later ages abolished the feudal system in favor of commanderies and counties, and the realm became one family, so the rites of vassals were no longer seen. The formats for memorials and petitions in the mortal realm, prior to the Qin and Han, lack clear textual evidence. Yet when vassals submitted documents to their own lords, they surely did not dare equate their rites with those due the Son of Heaven.

Moreover, the distinction between ruler and subject is one of the great constants of Heaven and Earth. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius established teachings to instruct all under Heaven and posterity. The distinction between ruler and subject, the bond between father and son, and the righteousness between husband and wife were all established in accordance with Heaven. As for the celestial patterns: the sun, moon, and stars, resplendent and visible, were already ordained at the dawn of creation, before the emergence of the sages. The distinction between ruler and subject was eternally fixed in Heaven.

The Northern Culmen resides at the center of the sky, opposite the Southern Culmen, serving as the pivot of Heaven. The sun, moon, and myriad stars revolve with the sky, while the two Culmens remain unmoving, enabling Heaven’s rotation. The Northern Culmen, situated within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, is perpetually visible. The *Astronomical Treatise* of the Jin states: "The five stars of the Northern Culmen lie within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The Northern Culmen is the most revered of the Northern Asterism." Within the Curved Array, the star at its mouth is called the Heavenly August Emperor, residing beneath the Curved Array. According to my observation: the Heavenly August Emperor’s rank is equal to the Northern Culmen, making it the celestial sovereign. Above it are the Canopy and the Curved Array treading upon it; to its left and right are the Upper Minister and Upper Guards encircling it. The Dipper’s... (text missing) resides before it, serving as the office of the tongue and throat. It regulates the four seasons, measures the primordial qi, issues the Emperor’s decrees, and governs the Three Realms. Beyond it, the Celestial Market Enclosure, Supreme Subtlety Enclosure, and Purple Tenuity Enclosure each have their own imperial thrones, which are merely branch offices of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure.

The myriad phenomena of the celestial sphere—sun, moon, and stars—are all governed by the Northern Culmen. The Northern Asterism stands as the celestial image, and the host of stars pay it homage; this is the pattern. The sages observed the celestial patterns to examine the profound measures, and they also followed what was eternally fixed to establish their system. Was it not that before the sages emerged, Heaven already had its ruler and subjects?

Moreover, even the imperial thrones of the Celestial Market and Supreme Subtlety Enclosures cannot rival the Northern Culmen. How much less can the two dim stars within the Dipper’s bowl—the imperial throne within the Dipper—compare? In recent times, ignorant men, relying on books like the *Comprehensive Diagram*, the *Wuwei Scripture*, and the *Register of the Northern Dipper*, have altered their names entirely. They have fabricated the *Method of the Celestial Mechanism*, directly venerating the Seven Primes of the Dipper and the two stars of the Dipper’s imperial throne as equals to the Heavenly Emperor. In their documents and memorials, they follow the same protocol as for the Jade Emperor. Such impropriety is beyond words.

The ancient liturgies indeed included Dipper Offerings. The term "offering" is the Daoist general term for collective sacrifices; it does not mean that because there is an offering ritual, one may arbitrarily exalt the recipient as the Supreme Emperor. Since the ritual pertains to the Dipper Palace, it collectively venerates all the Perfected within the Dipper, focusing the offering to express prayers. How can one, merely because there is a specialized offering ritual, elevate the stellar Perfected of the Dipper to the rank of Heavenly Emperor?

Some texts refer to the Dipper stars as the "Celestial Grand Commandant" or the "Celestial Supreme Emperor," but this is in terms of their governance. For example, Mount Tai’s title "Heavenly Equal" signifies that its merits and virtues can equal Heaven, not that the god of Mount Tai is the Jade Emperor. The ancient liturgies included forty-two offerings, among which were offerings to the Generals of Ding and Jia and the Eight Scribes. If one were to extend the logic of specialized offerings, would it then be permissible to elevate the Generals of Ding and Jia to the rank of Great Emperor?

Beyond the stellar realm lie the Nine Purities and Ten Poles, realms not recorded in the Confucian classics and without measurable celestial patterns. Yet the Three Caverns’ orthodox scriptures and the Four Auxiliary Perfected Canons describe them in great detail. The Three Qi of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin—congealing to form shape—become the Three Realms’ supreme sovereigns. Below, they correspond to the August Heaven, Northern Culmen, and Heavenly August Emperor; above, they govern the myriad heavens as the lords of Heaven.

Now, following my teacher’s transmission and consulting the relevant precedents, I employ the first-rank memorial format, for one must not profane Heaven with the common rites of the mortal world.

The abbreviated forms of memorial formats—ancient practitioners of prayer and supplication most often presented *zhang* petitions. Now, since the *zhang* format cannot be employed as a regular practice, one must resort to the *zoudu* memorial instead, which retains only the residual intent of the *zhang* and does not constitute its proper form. Few in this world understand this distinction, and some simply follow conventional formats without adopting this one—such flexibility is permissible.

From this point downward, for all Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Emperors, and Heavenly Lords as recorded in the ancient ritual canons and orthodox scriptures, the first-rank memorial format must be used. This practice was established after the founding of the Daoist teachings in the Middle Antiquity, adopting the secular memorial format of the mortal world. However, secular memorials do not employ sacred titles, for the world recognizes only one sovereign. Yet the Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Emperors manifest in countless forms and appearances. Following the scriptural canons, those with established names and titles must be addressed in memorials, though their designations vary. Thus, sacred titles cannot be omitted from the memorial text. Those not recorded in the orthodox canons but merely invoked in later ritual traditions—such as designating the Mysterious Center as a Heavenly Worthy, or addressing a Heavenly Worthy as Heavenly Master or Heavenly Lord—are numerous and cannot be lightly employed without authoritative basis.

For all others besides Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Emperors, Dao Lords, and Primordial Ladies, the *shenzhuang* petition format is uniformly used. This applies even to those of the highest rank, such as the Perfected Lords of the Upper Realms; those of the greatest authority, such as the Central Ministers of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure; and the Four Sagely Upper Assistants, the Lofty Perfected of the Heavenly Ministries, the Three Officials, the Five Masters, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges—all follow the *shenzhuang* precedent.

As for those who style themselves "ministers," this reflects the fact that practitioners, fearing they may not yet transcend the Three Realms to become direct ministers of the Golden Towers, may have attained realization only to the extent of receiving scriptures in the Grotto Heavens and shedding their forms in the Void Mystery. Thus, before the host of Perfected Ones in the Upper Realms, they must still assume the role of ministers—much as ancient feudal ministers served their lords. The *zoudu* memorial is not used here, for just as feudal ministers dared not address their lords as "Son of Heaven," so too must restraint be observed. If, however, a practitioner’s Dao is profound and virtue exalted, and they judge that one day they will ascend lightly to the Nine Purities and directly serve the Three Realms as ministers, then before the Perfected Ones of the Upper Realms, they need not adopt the title of minister or follow the precedent of feudal subordinates. This depends entirely on the individual; in my humble opinion, it seems that officials of the earthly realms are not yet suited to such a rank. Yet one cannot assert that no such persons exist in the world, and thus I dare not presume to judge arbitrarily.

As for using the *biao* memorial before one’s teacher—later ages adopted the practice of presenting *biao* only before a sovereign. To employ it before a teacher is improper in terms of ritual propriety. One should emulate the ancients, who presented *jian* memorials to the crown prince. The *Wen Xuan* and other ancient texts contain such formats. Thus, before one’s teacher, the *jian* should replace the *biao*. To disregard distinctions of honor and rank, to ignore canonical formats, and to reduce the Three Clarities, the Jade Emperor, the Five Masters, the Four Sagely Ones, the Three Officials, and the Seven Primes to a single category—using the *zoudu* format uniformly—would be unreasonable both in the human world and in the heavens above. Some ritual manuals, in establishing formats, instruct practitioners to use the *zoudu* before the Five Masters and Seven Primes; this reflects a temporary oversight in aligning with the canons and should not be taken as grounds for disrupting proper principles.

I, Yunzhong, am but a latecomer, fortunate to have been nurtured by the true teachings. Yet my karmic obstructions are deep, and I have not encountered a perfected master. Unversed in the ritual canons and limited in understanding, I dare not deliberately advance heterodox views. To deceive the world and seek undeserved fame would violate the principles I hold dear, and I cannot willingly submit to falsehood. Before the Great Clod was divided and the Supreme Dao merged indistinguishably, before texts were inscribed and names distinguished, there were no memorials to submit. From the Middle Antiquity onward, as ritual canons expanded and rites were established in accordance with the times, memorials and petitions came into use. Once written forms were instituted, they had to conform to canonical regulations. Yet later generations, in their ignorance, either cling solely to their teachers’ transmissions or blindly follow old formats. Can one remain deluded by tradition and insist on teacher-centered transmission? Can one obstruct principle by adhering to vulgar formats? Some reckless and deceitful individuals claim that the Dao is realized through spiritual communion, that Heaven is reached through the heart’s resonance, and that written texts are not strictly necessary. If this were so, they would already be able to appear before the Emperor in spirit and attain the Great Stability of the Celestial Court. Then memorials and petitions could be abolished, and *biao* and *zhang* dispensed with. But so long as affairs remain bound to form and matter, and the spirit has not yet transcended the Void Mystery, such boastful and exaggerated claims—using words to conceal faults—risk consigning one to the ranks of the benighted and deluded.

The formats of memorials and petitions pertain to matters of rank and hierarchy and cannot be treated lightly. To address a minister as a sovereign in the human world is to sow chaos. To address a minister as a sovereign among the Lofty Perfected—would that not sow chaos in the heavens? To sow chaos in the world is a crime deserving of execution; to sow chaos in the heavens—can that be without consequence? The principles of Heaven and humanity are one; the unseen and the manifest are in accord. To disrupt celestial regulations in vulgar fashion is impermissible even in the heavens above. As for the law of condemning the heart’s intent—what punishment would suffice?

If one conducts oneself in this manner, as a minister one would be disloyal, as a son one would be unfilial. The ancients condemned rebellious ministers and treacherous sons who usurped power in their time. Treacherous ministers who betray their states first exalted their sovereigns to provoke the ambitions of power-hungry officials. Such individuals, heedless of falsehood and indifferent to ritual propriety, resort to deceit in their schemes and harbor flattery in their hearts. Their fate in the netherworld is thus evident, and their conduct in the human world can be imagined. Practitioners who, having received but a single register or transmitted a single method, immediately employ uncanonical texts to flatter the heavens—if this is how they conduct their affairs, their character as human beings can be surmised.

The rites of memorials and petitions are of great importance in the ritual canons. Thus, I, Yunzhong, have no choice but to set forth these distinctions in detail. My arguments here may be presented before the Supreme Emperor and declared to the host of Perfected Ones. They are not private opinions, nor are they forced interpretations; they do not exalt the self while denigrating others, nor do they seek reputation by currying favor with the multitude.

The myriad spirits stand in luminous array, the ten thousand phenomena spread in solemn order—truly they witness the sincerity of Yunzhong’s intent.

**Memorial Format for the Upper Realm**

The undersigned humbly memorializes [Sacred Title].
May the Perfected Compassion grant this petition and specially authorize its implementation.
This minister, daring to offend the Perfected Might, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Humbly submitted.

Memorial submitted by [Official Position] [Rank] Minister [Surname].

**For the Middle and Lower Realms**, including the Great Emperor of Fengdu, the Great Emperor of Fusang, the High Ministers of the Five Peaks, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Lords of Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands, the Water Emperors of the Nine Rivers, the Prefect of Mount Tai, the Six Heavens of the Earthly Prison, the Ten Feng Halls of Darkness, and all deities with official titles or those who have received ennobling sacrifices—memorials shall be used.
The recipient’s title shall be placed at the beginning, followed by the year and month. Alternatively, the title may precede the memorial text.

**Memorial Format for the Middle and Lower Realms**
Office of the Great Ritual of the Numinous Treasure.
It is noted that this office, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent, must submit this memorial for consideration.

The undersigned humbly memorializes [Sacred Title], reverently hoping that the Sacred Will may grant this petition and specially authorize its implementation.
Respectfully submitted.

[Year, Cyclical Year] [Month] [Day]
Memorial submitted by [Official Position] [Rank] Minister [Surname].

For deities of the Middle and Lower Realms of slightly lesser rank, such as those of the Feng Halls, Springs, and Crooked Waters, the Prefects of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars, City Gods, the Officials of the Year-Star in the Sacrificial Register, and the Divine Tiger Generals and Clerks—documents shall be in the form of *die* (official notes).
The ritual master shall write in regular script, sign with full name, and affix a careful seal, without any hint of irreverence.

For example, City Gods of prefectures and counties have, since ancient times in the Heavenly Heart and other ritual systems, been addressed with public *die*. This is because ritual masters act for the benefit of others and the world, and their affairs are conducted publicly. Moreover, in the Middle Realm, deities such as the Great Emperor of Fengdu and the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks hold positions of such exalted dignity that distinctions of rank must be observed.

In later times, however, those who dispatch documents have lost the mean: reckless individuals write with grandiose seals and disrespectful, irreverent language, while timid practitioners even address City Gods with memorials. Both excess and deficiency are departures from proper form. Here, two types of *die* formats are provided.

**First-Class *Die* Format**
Office of the Great Ritual of the Numinous Treasure *die* to [Deity’s Title].
This office, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent, must issue this document.

The *die* requests that the preceding matters be duly considered. [Text continues.] Respectfully submitted.

[Year, Cyclical Year] [Month] [Day]
*Die* issued by [Official Position] [Surname] [Seal].

For deities of the Middle and Lower Realms of slightly lesser rank, or those listed in the sacrificial register but not yet ennobled, or the principal spirits of mountains and rivers who have not received ennobling titles, as well as lower-ranking generals and clerks in the ritual system, or deities who serve as branch officials under the main deities of venerable temples—second-class *die* shall be used, omitting the word "to" before the deity’s title. The closing shall read "therefore *die*," as the ritual propriety is already diminished.

If the deity is listed in the sacrificial register but has not received a title from the present dynasty—yet was a sage emperor, renowned king, loyal minister, or martyr in antiquity, whose former rank was exalted and who still receives sacrifices today—memorials shall be used, not *die*. For example, the temple of Great Yu in Yue is dedicated to an ancient sage ruler; how could such a deity be treated lightly? One must carefully consider the nature of the matter and act accordingly.

**Second-Class *Die* Format**
Office of the Great Ritual of the Numinous Treasure *die* [Deity’s Title].
This office, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent, must issue this document.

The *die* requests that the matters be duly considered. [Text continues.] Therefore *die*.

[Year] [Month] [Day]
*Die* issued by [Official Position] [Surname] [Seal].

For minor deities of the Middle and Lower Realms, as well as generals and clerks of this office—such as the borrowed troops and soldiers under the Five Peaks in the Heavenly Heart system—*tie* (notes) shall be used.

The registers of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements have fixed ranks, but in modern ritual texts, schools proliferate, lineages diverge, and the names of generals and clerks are limitless, no longer confined to the Three Caverns and Four Supplements. Since their ranks and precedence are not prescribed in the canonical texts, practitioners must exercise careful judgment.

**Tie Format**
Office of the Great Ritual of the Numinous Treasure *tie* to [Deity’s Title].
This office, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent, must issue this document.

The *tie* states: [Text continues.] Therefore *tie*.

[Year, Cyclical Year] [Month] [Day]
*Tie* issued by [Official Position] [Surname] [Seal].

For the *Gongcao* (Functionaries) and the office’s clerks and soldiers, *guan* (official communications) shall be used. Do not fabricate the names of the *Gongcao*; instead, issue clear instructions. The closing of the *guan* for delivering offerings must not include phrases such as "if disobeyed." Ritual masters rely entirely on the *Gongcao* for transmission. Since ancient times, the *Gongcao* have been held in high regard in the altar rites of fasts and offerings. Since ritual masters cannot ride the void and command *qi*, on whom else can they depend? If one were to treat them with arrogance or write "if disobeyed," thus invoking the altar statutes, what punishment would the ritual master impose if the *Gongcao* were to disobey? The closing should instead read: "Transmit this promptly; do not delay," or similar language.

In recent times, deceitful and eccentric individuals, relying on their own opinions and arbitrary judgments, have fabricated ritual texts. This has led to alterations of ancient texts, embellishments of old canons, or the extraction and modification of talismans and incantations from other books, which are then compiled under false names. They invent seals, forge heavenly statutes, and fabricate altar laws, creating endless variations that confuse and mislead the world. Their ritual forms are flawed, their dispatches crude and improper, resulting in disrespect toward the sacrificial register, contempt for the Perfected Deities, ignorance of precedence, and inappropriate use of documents—errors too numerous to recount. Those of profound understanding must carefully examine right and wrong.

**Guan Format**

**Guan to a Specific Deity of the Divine Treasure Grand Ritual Bureau**

To the deity [Name] of the Divine Treasure Grand Ritual Bureau:

This Bureau, in accordance with the submitted petition, hereby issues this *guan* for transmission.

This *guan* is to be executed by the deity [Name]. Issued accordingly.

*Guan* issued in the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day].
Sealed by the ritual master [Name and Title].

---

For household deities such as the Controller of Fate and local earth gods—whose ranks are the lowest and may be directed—use the *lu* register.

**Divine Treasure Grand Ritual Bureau**

This Bureau, in accordance with the submitted petition, hereby issues this directive for command.

This *zha* is hereby entrusted to the deity [Name], who is to deliberate on the matter and comply with its execution. Issued accordingly.

*Zha* issued in the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day].
Sealed by the ritual master [Name and Title].

---

For transmitting documents along the way—such as petitions from local earth gods to city gods, or memorials from mountain spirits—where the *guan* to the Merit Officer is unnecessary, use the *yin* dispatch.

Deliver to the local earth god for onward transmission.

**Divine Treasure Grand Ritual Bureau *Yin***

This Bureau now issues this memorial to [Location], requiring command.

It is hereby directed to the local earth god of [Location], and to the earth gods of subsequent locations in sequence, to transmit it accordingly.

Issued in the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day].
Sealed by the ritual master [Name and Title].

---

The formats for *guan*, petitions, and memorials are as described above. In ancient times, talismanic methods derived from the classics and canons. When drafting official documents, they followed secular conventions. Yet the transmission of ritual authority from master to disciple has endured for ages. One should modestly adhere to the old canons, neither transgressing ritual propriety nor erring in matters of precedence. Let the language be neither excessive nor deficient, that it may properly convey reason. Thus may the unseen and seen worlds be harmonized, and sincerity reach the divine.

If ritual offices deviate from ancient forms, or transmissions employ vulgar terms, the consequence is that the names and ranks of the Perfected Deities are altered, and the bureaucracies of the Three Realms are reshuffled—all for the sake of novelty and eccentricity, to dazzle the moment. For instance, the Northern Dipper’s stellar palace is falsely elevated as the "Nine Mornings Jade Palace," or the Solar Palace is referred to by an alternate name from the scriptures, such as "Luminous Splendor Palace." Such examples abound, all of which are inappropriate.

This is why the Yellow Register Retreats—uniting the manifest and the hidden, revered in both ancient and modern times—must be upheld.

Here now is a draft of the requisite documents for memorials and petitions, prepared for use in ritual construction. As for the weight of the matters at hand and the degree of detail in their execution, these shall be left to the High Master’s discretion when the time comes—no fixed rule is prescribed.

The following presents the forms for petitions and memorials, from preliminary announcements to the dispersal of the altar. All documents pertaining to the matter are listed below.

Whenever the Yellow Register Retreat is to be conferred, a memorial must first be submitted in advance.

**Memorial to the August Emperor of Supreme Heaven**

[Your] subordinate, [Name], of such-and-such ritual rank, respectfully submits:

To the right, [I] humbly record that persons of such-and-such prefecture, subprefecture, county, and township have petitioned to establish the **Unsurpassed Great Yellow Register Retreat** at such-and-such location.

[This rite] shall ascend in offering to the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain, elevating their numina to the Empyrean. May the present emperor’s longevity equal heaven and earth. May the seas and lands enjoy peace, the living beings radiant prosperity. May the three paths and five destinies all ascend in deliverance; may the nine earths and six heavens all attain transcendence.

This accumulation of meritorious fruit is dedicated especially for [Name], to deliver and uplift ancestral spirits and the departed, and to safeguard the fivefold kinship and sixfold relations.

[Your] subordinate, having received this earnest supplication, dares not refuse. Having already selected an auspicious day to open the altar and commence the rites—details of which shall be separately reported—I now humbly submit this memorial in advance, reverently memorializing the **Most High, Heaven-Executing Tally-Holding, Calendar-Wielding, Truth-Embodying Dao, Jade Sovereign of the August Heavenly Emperor**.

[Your] subordinate respectfully beseeches Your Celestial Compassion to deign, in Your boundless grace, to grant permission for this memorial to proceed.

Still, [Your subordinate] humbly beseeches that this be proclaimed to all offices under the Three Realms, that they may accord due response. Upon the establishment of the fast-altar, wherever the ritual documents are transmitted, all shall comply and act accordingly.

[Your] subordinate, having presumptuously trespassed upon Your Celestial Might, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation—this entreaty is most earnest. Respectfully submitted.

To the right, respectfully submitted to the **High Perfected Rulers of the Supreme Mystery Capital Ministry under the Three Heavens’ Gate**. [Your subordinate] earnestly hopes for Your True Compassion to deign to present this to the **Heavenly Portal**, permitting [your] subordinate to proceed, and further beseeches that a decree be issued to all offices under the Three Realms, that the true bureaus may accord due response. Upon the establishment of the fast-altar, wherever the ritual documents extend, all shall be commanded to comply and act accordingly.

Furthermore, may [Your subordinate] be permitted to carry out these rites, that the **Yellow Register Retreat** may be brought to completion.

[Your] subordinate, having presumptuously trespassed upon Your True Might, is filled with overwhelming trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

**Pre-notification to the Five Masters**

[Your subordinate], of duly attested ritual rank and surname [X], humbly following the intent of the petitioner as before, must duly report it.

To the right, respectfully submitted to the **True Lord of the Numinous Treasure Dharma Master**; the **True Lord of the Numinous Treasure Register Master**; the **True Lord of the Numinous Treasure Scripture Master**; the **Great Celestial Master of the Three Heavens, Upholder of the Dao, Assistant of the Primordial, Orthodox Unity, Serene Resonance, Perfected Lord**; and the **Great Master of the Mysterious Center**.

Earnestly hoping for the compassion of the Masters to jointly review this petition in accordance with celestial protocols.

**Pre-notification to the Earth Deities of the Nine Provinces**

The **Great Numinous Treasure Dharma Bureau** issues this document to the Earth Deity of [X] Province.

Within the jurisdiction of [X] Province.

This bureau, having received the petition of [X], a resident of [X] village, states: [X], born on [X] year, month, day, and hour, passed away on [X] year, month, and day at [X] location.

Now, [the petitioner] seeks to conduct a **Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Grand Retreat** of [X] days and nights to deliver and transcend the deceased.

As this bureau cannot refuse the petition, and having already memorialized the Celestial Court, this document is hereby issued.

It is requested that the Earth Deities of the Nine Provinces be notified to inform all sacred mountains and great rivers, city gods, and deities of ancient altars throughout the realm. Let them examine the merits and transgressions of the living, weigh the virtues and faults of the departed, govern the souls and spirits, and administer the netherworld, ensuring all relevant jurisdictions act in accordance with the established protocols.

Wherever this document reaches, let it be obeyed and executed.

Furthermore, it is requested that [the deities] proceed to the retreat altar to jointly assist in the accomplishment of this virtuous endeavor.

Upon receipt, act swiftly in accordance with these instructions.

Respectfully issued.

In the year-cycle [X], month [X], day [X], issued by [your subordinate], of duly attested ritual rank and surname [X].

**Pre-notification to the City God of the Locality**

The **Great Numinous Treasure Dharma Bureau** issues this document to the City God of [X] Province.

This bureau, having received the petition as before, hereby issues this document.

It is requested that the matter be reviewed and that the document be issued to all sacred mountains, great rivers, and city gods within the jurisdiction.

[Same closing as above.]

Such is the general outline of the **Yellow Register Pre-notification**. Should greater detail be desired, additional documents may be issued as circumstances require.

However, in recent times, many have issued documents to the **Central City God Bureau of the Realm**. Upon thorough examination of canonical precedents, no such office is found. Even in the Song dynasty’s capital, only the **City God of the Capital Prefecture, Protector Sage King**, was established. In the present imperial residence at Lin’an, only the **City God Temple of Lin’an Prefecture**, enfeoffed as **Manifest Righteous King**, exists.

Now, the term *city* refers to the walls of a prefecture or commandery, while *moat* denotes the surrounding ditch. This deity governs the affairs of the city moat and is thus the local protector of a single region. If one were to speak of a *Central City God*, the realm is vast, and it would be impossible to encompass it within a single city and moat. Even the Great Wall of Qin Shi Huang, stretching from Lintao in the east to the Liao River in the north, barely encloses half of the northeast. Given the vastness of the realm, which cannot be enclosed by a single city and moat, the title *Central City God* is inappropriate.

The term *city god* arises from the construction of city walls and moats, with a deity appointed to govern them. Without such a city and moat, it is difficult to establish such a deity. From the perspective of the imperial court, there is no temple for a *Central City God*. From the perspective of Daoist canons, no such office exists. Thus, it is appropriate to issue documents to the Earth Deities of the Nine Provinces, distributing them according to their respective jurisdictions.

Recently, some have pointed to other deities of the netherworld, whose functions appear similar, and claimed them to be the *Central City God*. Yet they fail to recognize that the term *city god* cannot be applied to the entire realm as if it were a single city encircled by one moat. If one wishes to follow popular custom and issue such documents, it may be done. However, there is no such deity in the netherworld, nor is there such a temple in the human realm.

Moreover, the protocols of the **Yellow Register Retreat** are solemn and weighty. The examination of merits and transgressions, the oversight of spirits and deities—once the pre-notification is issued, not a single talisman or character may be used carelessly. Without verifying the facts, to openly seal and issue documents invoking such a deity would be improper. If there were indeed such a deity, and documents were not issued, it would violate canonical protocols. If no such deity exists, to indulge in falsehoods for the sake of appearances would invite divine retribution.

This explanation is offered for those of broad learning and deep understanding. The ignorant and unlearned may well scoff at it. Scholars should further investigate and act accordingly.

For private dedications, a single petition suffices, following the same intent.

[Your subordinate], of duly attested ritual rank and surname [X], respectfully states:

According to the petition of [X], [the deceased], born on [X] year, month, day, and hour, passed away on [X] year, month, day, and hour. [X] days have now elapsed since their passing, and their fate remains unknown. With sincerity and devotion, [the petitioner] has established a **Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat** of [X] days and nights.

May this benefit the state and bring universal blessings to the realm. May it open the paths of the **Five Destinies and Three Ways**, and safeguard the **Nine Provinces and Four Seas**.

Having amassed these virtuous fruits, [the petitioner] dedicates them solely to the deliverance of the deceased [X], that they may transcend suffering and attain liberation. As the petition is earnest and sincere, [your subordinate] dares not refuse or delay. Apart from having already selected an auspicious day to establish the altar and proceed with the rites in due order, it is necessary to first submit this memorial for presentation.

Thus concludes the report.

The above memorial having been submitted, the document is forwarded to the celestial **Office of Merit** (Shangjie Gongcao), where the officials in charge of time and affairs shall transmit it accordingly.

**Memorial to the Jade Purity**

[Your subordinate], of duly attested ritual rank and surname [X], respectfully states:

Long have I been unworthy of my office in the numinous bureaucracy, lacking in virtuous conduct. Charged with propagating the Dao and aiding the times, I dare offer my humble sincerity to reach the imperial attention.

In accordance with the petition submitted by [X] and others, beseeching the establishment of a **Grand Yellow Register Retreat**, for the protection of the state and the household, the deliverance of the hidden and the salvation of the manifest, their plea is earnest and unwavering. I dare not decline. I have already, on the [X] day of the [X] month, submitted a preliminary report to the celestial court.

Yet the rites of the **Yellow Register** are of the utmost solemnity. My insignificant self, dull and unworthy, ignorant of the proper **qi** and timing, has presumptuously presided over these rites. I fear that demonic obstacles may remain unremoved, hindering the salvation of both the manifest and the hidden. Moreover, the universal deliverance of souls is a matter of profound urgency. Without prior notification, I worry that the gates of the netherworld may remain obstructed.

It is therefore necessary to submit this memorial.

Respectfully presented to the **Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity** (Xuwu Ziran Yuanshi Tianzun).

May the **Dao’s** compassion deign to bestow mercy and grant this preliminary petition.

May the original pardon extend to this servant’s sins and transgressions, both from past lives and the present one, which are deep and weighty. May demonic obstacles be dispelled, and the grace of propagation be granted.

Further, I humbly beseech that the **Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau** (Taixuan Du Sheng) be instructed to review this petition and swiftly bestow its issuance and implementation.

This servant, having rashly trespassed against the **Dao’s** majesty, trembles in awe and awaits punishment with utmost reverence.

Respectfully submitted.

On the [day] of the [month] in the year of the Great Epoch, this servant, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank, presents this memorial.

To the **Jade Clarity of the Supreme Dao Lord of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure** (Shangqing Taishang Daojun Dongxuan Lingbao Tianzun), the **Jade Clarity of the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Cavernous Spirit and Mysterious Power** (Taiqing Taishang Laojun Dongshen Daode Tianzun), the **Jade August Thearch of the Primordial Opening Heaven, the True-Embodying Dao, the August Jade Sovereign of the Vast Sky** (Wutian Taishang Kaitian Zhifu Yuli Hanzhen Tidao Wutian Yuhuang Shangdi), the **Jade August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity at the North Culmen of the Central Heaven** (Beiji Zhongtian Ziwei Beiji Dadi), the **Jade August Thearch of the Celestial Sovereign of the Star Palace of the Curved Array** (Tianhuang Gouchenshi Gong Tianhuang Dadi), and the **August Earthly Deity of the Rear Soil, Who Receives Heaven’s Mandate, Emulates the Law, and Embodies Profound Virtue** (Diqi Chengtian Xiaofa Houde Guangda Houtu Huangdiqi).

The Preceptor of Salvation states: For the **Three Clarities and Jade Emperors**, memorials may employ the *Petition for Introduction*. As for the **North Culmen**, **Celestial Sovereign**, and **Rear Soil**, the first two belong to the stellar realm, while the latter pertains to the earthly domain. These three memorials ought not be submitted through the **Three Heavenly Gates**. This was an oversight by Master Jin at the time.

The seven memorials above follow the same format. Use the *Petition for Introduction* and submit it to the **Celestial Pivot Bureau** (Tianshu Yuan), where the imperial positions may be inscribed on the upper slip, and the yellow slip sealed above, both marked as memorials to be presented at the **Three Heavenly Gates** to the **Celestial Pivot Bureau** for submission.

Memorial to the **Eastern Culmen**:
This servant, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank, presents this memorial.

In accordance with the memorial to the **Jade Clarity**, this petition is respectfully submitted to the **Celestial Worthy of Salvation and Suffering of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Culmen** (Dongji Qinggong Taiyi Jiu Ku Tianzun).

May the **Dao’s** compassion deign to bestow mercy. May the vast vows and radiant light of compassion illuminate the **Three Realms and Ten Directions**, the **Heavenly Prisons and Earthly Hells**, the **Yin Realms and Nether Bureaus**, and all dark paths and nocturnal abodes, causing them to be cleared and brightened.

Further, I beseech that flying celestial spirits be dispatched to command the lords of the netherworld, hastening the resolution of all pending cases for souls under judgment. May those eligible for deliverance be swiftly released and directed to the ritual altar. Throughout the cosmos and the nine provinces, may wandering spirits and lost souls—whether with masters or kinless, traversing the **Five Paths and Three Ways**—be gathered from every quarter. May they all await the arrival of the **Nine Dragon Talisman’s** decree, whereupon they shall be sent to the ritual altar to receive the **Dao’s** beneficence.

This servant, having rashly trespassed against the **Dao’s** majesty, trembles in awe and awaits punishment with utmost reverence.

With due reverence, this memorial is respectfully submitted.

A sealed petition is hereby enclosed and presented to the **Azure Palace of the Eastern Ultimate**, to be again reported to the **Celestial Ministry**.

This humble servant, [Name], of the duly ordained rank, by unworthy capacity has presumptuously received the great transformation of the **Dao**. Yet, ignorant of the proper timing of **qi** and seasons, I stand in the ranks of the ordained. Day and night I tremble in vigilance, knowing not how to render service. I vow to exert myself in acts of salvation, that I may repay even a fraction of this grace.

Recently, upon receiving the petition of the attending servant, whose words were earnest and sincere, I dared not suppress or refuse. Having reverently consulted the canonical statutes and selected an auspicious day, I have already, on the [day] of [month], submitted a preliminary report.

Yet the **Yellow Register Retreat** is a rite of utmost solemnity and gravity. This servant, a mere mortal of flesh, possessing mediocre talent and shallow learning, has been mistakenly entrusted with this weighty duty—how could my strength suffice? Moreover, the preparation of talismans and registers, as well as the prior issuance of decrees to the relevant authorities to summon and verify the sin-laden souls for timely dispatch, cannot be accomplished without Your Majesty’s decree. Without such authorization, how may the swift response of spiritual resonance be attained?

Thus, this matter is again respectfully submitted for Your Majesty’s consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Three Heavens’ Gate, the Most Exalted Office of the Supreme Mystery, governed by the Lofty Perfected Ones:

With reverent hope in the true compassion of the Perfected, may this petition be specially presented before the Celestial Court. By Your decree, let it be issued throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, to the Heavenly Prisons, Earthly Hells, and all yin-bound underworld bureaus—wherever jurisdiction extends. Command the relevant authorities to swiftly conclude the cases of all presently detained, fettered, and arraigned sin-laden souls. Release the multitudes destined for deliverance and dispatch them to the retreat altar. Furthermore, for the nine provinces and their corresponding celestial domains, the Five Paths and Three Ways, and all wandering lonely souls, instruct the local City Gods, Earth Deities, and Village Protectors to assemble them without delay, that they may await the rite of liberation.

This servant, in daring presumption before the true majesty of the Perfected, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

Again, this petition is respectfully addressed to the Five Divine Courts by the legally ordained minister [Name].

This servant, though of mediocre capacity, jointly submits this petition in accordance with the Office’s protocol.

Respectfully submitted to:
The Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, who Upholds the Dao and Assists the Primordial;
The Perfected Lord Zhenwu, Numinous and Responsive, Protector and Sage;
The Perfected Lord Yisheng, who Stores Blessings and Guards Virtue;
The Perfected Lord Tianyou, Vice Marshal of the Primordial;
The Perfected Lord Tianpeng, Marshal of the Great Primordial.

Jointly submitted to:
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
The Perfected Lord of the Lingbao Deliverance Master;
The Perfected Lord of the Lingbao Register Master;
The Perfected Lord of the Lingbao Scripture Master.

Submitted to:
The August Lord of the Lower Yuan, Water Official;
The August Lord of the Middle Yuan, Earth Official;
The August Lord of the Upper Yuan, Heaven Official.

The above three petitions are submitted in accordance with the format of the Celestial Office’s protocol.

Again, this petition is respectfully addressed to the Underworld’s Great Lingbao Dharma Bureau.

As the Bureau has received the petition and finds its content irrefutable, it has already memorialized the Celestial Court for implementation. Given that the luminous statutes of the Yellow Register prescribe matters concerning both the hidden and manifest realms, and that the principle of universal deliverance fulfills virtuous merit, this matter is hereby recorded and respectfully submitted for consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

The August Emperor of the Northern Darkness, Fengdu.

We humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to specially issue decrees to the Six Heavens and Ten Caverns, the Five Sacred Peaks and Nine Nether Realms, the Springs’ Crooked Passes, the Yellow Springs’ Dark Prisons, the Middle Yuan Earth Bureau, the Forty-Two Courts, and all relevant jurisdictions. Command the responsible authorities to promptly summon the guilty souls for confrontation, swiftly gather evidence, and conclude their cases. Release all those eligible for deliverance—across the Nine Provinces’ domains, the wandering luminous spirits, the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, the ownerless and kinless, and all who perished in times past—every solitary soul. Further, instruct the local City Gods, Earth Deities, Village Masters, and territorial governors to assemble and escort them forthwith, that they may reverently receive the celestial grace and duly partake in the Emperor’s benevolence of creation and nurturance.

Respectfully submitted.

In the cyclical year [Tai Sui] ____, on the ___ day of the ___ month, recorded by [Name and Dharma Rank].

Again, this petition is respectfully addressed to the Water Bureau’s Great Lingbao Dharma Bureau.

As the Bureau has received the petition and finds its content identical to that submitted to the Earth Bureau, this matter is hereby recorded and respectfully submitted for consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Eastern Glow Supreme Emperor of Fusang in the Water Bureau.

We humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to issue decrees to the Nine Rivers and Four Waterways, the Eight Seas and Five Lakes, the Dragon Courts of the Water Realms, the Springs and Deep Pools, the Dark and Cold Water Prisons, the Three Lower Bureaus, the Forty-Two Offices, and all relevant jurisdictions. The matter is identical to that submitted to the Earth Bureau.

Respectfully submitted to the Eastern Prison Lingbao Great Dharma Bureau. The Bureau finds its content identical to that submitted to the Earth Bureau. This is hereby recorded and respectfully submitted for consideration.

Respectfully submitted to the Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of the Eastern Prison. The conclusion is identical to that of the Earth Bureau petition.

**Memorandum to the Community Deities**
*Lingbao Great Dharma Bureau Memorandum to the Community Deities of [State Name]*

The Bureau, having reviewed the earnest and reasonable petition submitted, finds it proper to comply. Apart from having repeatedly memorialized the Celestial Court, we note that the ritual laws are solemn and the true ordinances weighty, requiring coordination across the Three Realms. Thus, a formal dispatch is necessary.

We hereby request that you, upon reviewing the matter, promptly transmit this memorandum to notify all City Gods, Earth Deities, and officials governing ancient sacred mounds, altars of soil and grain, underworld palaces, spirit lodges, suburban roads, village valleys, mountains, and forests—all relevant jurisdictions. Command your subordinate authorities to gather and detain those languishing in dark paths and confined to local domains. Further, examine and record all lingering spirits yet to have their sins absolved, ensuring swift verification and resolution.

Release all those eligible for deliverance, along with the wandering souls across the four wilds, the flying and drifting spirits, the beings of the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad forms of life, and all unattached, solitary souls. Upon receipt of this dispatch, assemble and escort them forthwith to receive the merit of the ritual and ascend in due time. Upon completion, memorialize the achievements in accordance with the prescribed format.

Respectfully submitted.
In the cyclical year [Tai Sui] ____, on the ___ day of the ___ month.

**Memorandum to the City God**
*Lingbao Great Dharma Bureau Memorandum to the City God Governor of [State and Prefecture Name]*

The Bureau, having reviewed the matter, finds it identical to the previous submission. We request that you, upon reviewing the details, issue decrees to all jurisdictions under your authority—counties, towns, villages, mountains, forests, valleys, ancient sacred sites, altars of soil and grain, and all relevant domains—following the previous memorandum.

---

**Memorandum to the Officials and Generals**
*Lingbao Great Dharma Bureau Memorandum to the Officials and Generals of the Tongchu Prefecture of the Lingbao Administration*

The Bureau, having reviewed the matter, finds it identical to the memorandum to the Community Deities. We request that you, in accordance with the ordinances of the *Dongxuan Lingbao Scriptures*, promptly lead your subordinate officers and soldiers to the ritual site for stationing. There, you shall proclaim the celestial decrees, distribute talismans, summon souls and capture spirits, transcribe memorials, and extend your influence across the Three Realms—reaching the Nine Heavens above, the Earth Bureau and Water Bureau below, and the underworld and nether regions. Wherever the documents reach, respond accordingly to ensure resonance. Upon the completion of the ritual, memorialize the achievements as prescribed by law.

Respectfully submitted.

---

For memorials submitted to the upper realms, notify the Direct Talisman Deities of the Upper Realm, the Day-Officers, the Earth Bureau, and the Mountain Bureau. For dispatches, notify the Merit Officers of the Middle Realm and the local deities of the respective domains. For petitions to the Water Bureau, notify the Direct Talisman Deities of the Lower Realm for transmission.

The precedent for the *Huanglu* secondary petitions follows this general outline. If seeking a mandate from the Celestial Court to announce the ritual, memorialize only the upper realms; it is permissible not to notify the middle and lower realms. If the ritual date is distant, a third petition may follow after the initial announcement. Here, we establish the third petition’s template for practical use. Should the ritual date be imminent and already fixed, the preceding secondary petitions may be omitted, and the third petition may serve as the secondary dispatch after the initial announcement.

Consider the weight of the matter and the proximity of the ritual date, adjusting as circumstances require to achieve balance. Excessive elaboration in documents is unnecessary and wasteful. Those of discernment may adapt these guidelines accordingly.

**Third Memorial**

To the Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Great Clarity;
To the August Heaven, Northern Culmen, Celestial Sovereign, and Queen of Earth;
To the Eastern Culmen.

Memorial submitted to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau for Transmission,
the Supreme Mystery Capital Office,
the Five Bureaus of Youthful Primordiality,
the Mysterious Masters,
the Three Masters,
and the Three Officials.

Official dispatch to the Divine Generals.

Three memorials to the Three Clarities, uniform in form.

[Your] subordinate, the Daoist adept of such-and-such rank and surname, respectfully states:

Whereas, in accordance with the petition submitted by a resident of such-and-such village and prefecture, it is declared that the deceased relative of the said petitioner, born on such-and-such year, month, day, and hour, departed this life on such-and-such year, month, day, and hour at such-and-such location—

[The petitioner] humbly requests the solemn establishment of a supreme, numinous-treasure, Yellow Register Great Ritual of several days and nights, wherein the Dao shall be practiced and the Perfected venerated, offerings presented and rites performed, to invoke blessings upon the state and safeguard the realm, to extend aid to all sentient beings and universally deliver the orphaned souls. By this accumulation of meritorious virtue, [the ritual] is dedicated specifically to the salvation and deliverance of the departed soul of the aforementioned deceased, raising them to life and transformation.

It is respectfully proposed that on such-and-such day of the present month, at such-and-such location in such-and-such prefecture and county, the altar shall be unfurled and the rites commenced.

For this purpose, [your] subordinate intends to proclaim and enact the Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, the Golden Register and White Tablet, the Longevity Numinous Talisman, the Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering, the Talisman for Shattering Hell, the Talisman for Deliverance of Shades, the Nine Dragons Mandate, the Supreme Edict of Pardon and Register for Ascension to Heaven, the various true talismans and mandates of the Numinous Treasure fundamental scriptures, and the Jade Tablet of the Primal Divine Tiger.

[These shall be] universally transmitted to the Ten Directions and Three Realms, to the Hells and the Dark Bureaus, to absolve and pardon the beings of the Three Paths and Five Ways, the Ten Classes and Four Births. All orphaned souls to be delivered, along with the nine ancestors and seven generations of the petitioner’s family, inner and outer kin, and the soul of the aforementioned deceased, shall be summoned to depart the dark realms, assemble at the ritual altar, manifest their forms, and receive deliverance in due time.

With reverence, [your] subordinate again records this memorial and, at risk of death, respectfully submits it to the Jade Augustness of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous.

May the compassion of the Dao deign to grant [your] subordinate’s petition.

All aforementioned talismanic commands shall be entrusted to [your] subordinate for execution. Still, [your] subordinate humbly implores that the boundless compassion of the Dao may especially bestow clarity and prosperity upon the dark underworld.

[Your] subordinate, having rashly trespassed against the majesty of the Dao, trembles in awe, awaiting punishment with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

Memorial presented by the ritual officiant of duly conferred rank, [your] subordinate [Name], concurrently addressing the August Celestial Sovereign of the Northern Culmen, the Heavenly August Empress of Earth, and the Four Quarters.

As previously petitioned, [your] subordinate again records this memorial and, at risk of death, respectfully submits it to the Jade Augustness of the Most High, Opener of Heaven, Holder of the Talisman, Ruler of the Calendar, Embracer of Truth, and Embodiment of the Dao—the Jade Sovereign of the August Heavenly Thearch.

May the Celestial Compassion deign to grant [your] subordinate’s petition. May a special edict be issued, proclaimed throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, to all places concerned. May universal pardon be decreed, that the soul of the aforementioned deceased, along with the ancestral kin of all families, the myriad beings of the Three Paths, and all orphaned souls of the dark realms, may assemble at the ritual altar to receive deliverance.

All aforementioned talismanic commands shall be entrusted to [your] subordinate for expedient transcription and sequential proclamation. [Your] subordinate, having rashly trespassed against the Celestial Majesty, trembles in awe, awaiting punishment with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

Memorial presented to the Eastern Culmen.

The Dharma-ranked official, [Name] of [Surname], respectfully submits this memorial.

Having previously recorded the petition as before, [your] subordinate now humbly resubmits this memorial to the Jade August One of the Eastern Culmen, the Azure Palace, the Great Unity Savior-from-Suffering Celestial Worthy.

May the Dao’s compassion deign to grant [your] subordinate’s petition. May a special edict command the Flying Celestial Beings to descend with the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands, dispatched throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, to the dark prisons of hell. The cloud-script shall follow the same format as that for the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven.

For the third time, [your] subordinate submits this memorial to the Celestial Pivot Bureau for transmission, in the same initial form as before.
For the third time, [your] subordinate submits this memorial to the Supreme Mystery Capital.

The Dharma-ranked official, [Name] of [Surname], respectfully states:
[Your] subordinate, though unworthy, has presumptuously received the great transformation of the Dao. Unenlightened to the rhythms of qi, [I] have rashly joined the ranks of the ordained. Day and night, [I] tremble in awe, unaware of how to render service. [I] vow to diligently aid and deliver, perhaps thereby repaying a fraction of [my] debt.

Previously, [your] subordinate received a petition from [Name] of [Surname] from [such-and-such] village, who stated that their kin, [Name], born on [year, month, day, hour], passed away on [year, month, day, hour]. [They] beseech the establishment of a Grand Yellow Register Daoist Ritual to bless the nation and bring peace to the times, to deliver the hidden and aid the manifest. May the merit thus accumulated be dedicated to the deliverance of the aforementioned deceased soul.

[Your] subordinate, leading the Dharma assembly, has prepared the ritual space at [location], unfurling the altar and erecting the scriptural tablets, arranging the images and ritual implements. Beginning on [date], [we] shall perform the preliminary rites to establish the altar, summon the hidden souls, and commence the ritual proceedings. From dawn on [date], for three days and nine periods, [we] shall invoke the Perfected, offer repentance, present incense, recite scriptures, perform boundless almsgiving, and conduct the universal feeding of the hungry ghosts. The ten classes of hidden souls, including the soul of [Name], shall be summoned, refined through qi, delivered, transmitted talismans, and receive the precepts, that they may swiftly attain rebirth.

On [date], [we] shall perform the Grand Offering to the Lofty Perfected of the Three Realms, encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine positions, to manifestly repay the celestial grace.

Now that the ritual has reached its appointed time, [your] subordinate intends to proclaim the Primordial Talismanic Commands of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, the Golden Register and White Petition, the Talisman of Longevity, the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering, the True Talisman of Liberation from the Cycle of Birth and Death, the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands of the Eastern Culmen and Azure Palace, the Precious Register of the Celestial Worthy’s Edict for Rebirth in Heaven, the Primordial Talismanic Commands of the Numinous Treasure Fundamental Dharma, the various talismans of all ranks, and the Jade Tablet of the Primordial Divine Tiger.

May these be dispatched throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, to the underworld courts of hell, to pardon and absolve the deceased soul of [Name], along with their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, departed kin of their lineage, the hidden souls and lingering spirits of the Four Seas and Nine Provinces, the Three Paths and Five Roads, the ten classes and four modes of existence. May they all depart the dark realms and assemble at the ritual altar.

This is respectfully submitted for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Venerable High Perfected of the Supreme Mystery Capital under the Three Heavens’ Gate, who govern the Celestial Bureaus.

With reverence, we beseech your true compassion to grant this petition. May it be specially presented to the celestial courts, that an edict be issued to the underworld registrars of the Three Realms, directing the deceased soul in question to its rightful place of belonging. May all be duly attended to, gates unlocked, bonds released, and sinful souls absolved.

We further entreat the dispatch of the officials, generals, and soldiers from the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, the scripture and talisman dharma ranks—those of the Numinous Treasure’s divine retinue, the Divine Tiger’s soul-seizing and spirit-capturing officers, the summoning officials of all rites performed by this servant, the flying divine beings of the Ten Directions, the couriers of the Mysterious Capital’s Golden Dragon Post, the Courier Officers of the Flaming Dragon, the messengers of the Three Realms and Four Quarters, the transmitting and memorializing straight talismans and merit officers, the jade lads and jade maidens, the inspectors of the ritual altar, and the myriad chariots and legions of true spirits. May these be entrusted to this servant’s administration to proclaim the commands, issue the talismans, pursue and seize the souls and spirits, convey the divine will, and safeguard the ritual altar. Thus may resonance be achieved, benefiting both the hidden and the manifest.

This servant, daring to offend your true majesty, is filled with utmost trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Third submission to the Five Bureaus**
By the dharma-ranked servant [Name].
This servant respectfully states.
The intent follows the standard format of the ministry’s memorial.

Respectfully submitted to:
The Heavenly Master,
Zhenwu,
Yisheng,
Tianyou,
Tianpeng.
(As per the ministry’s memorial format.)

**Third submission to the Mysterious Master**
By the dharma-ranked servant [Name].
This servant respectfully states.
The intent follows the standard format of the ministry’s memorial.

Respectfully submitted to:
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.
With reverence, we beseech the Master’s compassion.
(As per the ministry’s memorial format.)

**Third submission to the Three Masters**
This servant observes that in the Yellow Register Ritual Dharma, the myriad spirits are commanded, and any error or transgression cannot escape reprimand or punishment. As for this servant—a humble scholar of the dusty world, born in a degenerate age—without the grace of the Masters’ favor, it would be difficult to attain enlightenment.

This servant, following the previously stated intent as above.

Respectfully submitted for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted to:
The Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure Salvation Master,
The Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure Registry Master,
The Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure Scripture Master.
With reverence, we beseech the Masters’ compassion.

**Third Submission to the Three Officials**

As per the previous memorial’s intent.

**Third submission to the Three Officials**
This duly ordained servant, [Name], humbly states:
By long-standing karmic affinity, I have long received the shelter of the Perfected. Though unworthy, I have assumed the office of the Dharma Register and hold the duty of salvation and aid. At the time of my oath, I feared that any lapse would incur punishment. Thus, I submit this second appeal, offering my sincerest devotion, lest I weary the numinous compassion.

This servant, following the stated intent, seeks to transcend the bounds of mortal existence. With reverent and earnest words, I hereby fulfill the proper procedure. I respectfully lead the assembled ritualists to [location], where we prepare the altar, arrange the sacred images, and present the offerings and rites. We have chosen [date] to begin the preliminary rites and establish the altar, and on [date] shall conduct the fast and perform the ritual.

In addition to the previous memorials submitted to the Celestial Court, the talismanic decrees have been issued to summon and deliver the souls. Now, I must formally record and submit this report for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted to:
The August Lord of the Lower Prime, Water Official,
The August Lord of the Middle Prime, Earth Official,
The August Lord of the Upper Prime, Heaven Official.
With reverence, we beseech your true compassion to grant this servant’s request.

May it be decreed that throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Three Primes and Nine Palaces, the Twenty-Seven Bureaus, and the One Hundred Twenty Offices—wherever authority extends—all shall act in accordance with the established protocols. Wherever the talismanic decree reaches, may the bound souls be swiftly released from interrogation and detention, no longer detained, and summoned to the altar to partake in the ritual offerings.

Furthermore, we humbly beseech your pardon for this servant and the assembled ritualists, for the myriad transgressions of our past and present lives. Grant us leave to proceed without demonic obstruction, that good causes may be fulfilled, and that both the living and the dead may receive your grace—a true bestowal of life and deliverance.

This servant, daring to trespass upon your true majesty, is filled with awe and trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

To the Third Memorialized Officers and Generals—
A Memorial from the Great Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure to the Divine Offices of the Numinous Treasure, the Five Bureaus of Youthful Primordial Officials and Generals.

As this Bureau, in accordance with the petition previously submitted to the Three Officials, has already recorded and memorialized the Celestial Court and issued talismanic decrees, and as the ritual proceedings now draw near, swift action is required.

All wandering souls and stagnant spirits throughout the world, along with the bound and detained souls of the deceased [Name], are to be summoned and gathered to report in timely fashion at the altar in response to the ritual—this necessitates the issuance of this document.

Upon receipt of this memorial, you are respectfully requested to act in accordance with the principles herein: promptly notify and instruct the Officers, Lords, Generals, and Clerks of the Three Caverns, Four Auxiliaries, Scriptural Registers, and Ritual Methods to perform the summoning, refinement, and deliverance; transmit talismans and memorials; extend the decree to the Ten Directions, Three Realms, Five Sacred Peaks, and Four Great Rivers; oversee the ritual proceedings; deploy the hosts of divine soldiers; distribute and infuse the qi; station and establish the ritual bureau; facilitate the transmission of documents; safeguard the ritual proceedings; disseminate talismans and proclamations; present memorials and transcribe petitions; summon souls and capture spirits; communicate with both the hidden and manifest realms; circulate the ritual offerings; and upon completion of the rites, report the merits accomplished and memorialize the Celestial Court—all in strict accordance with the Mysterious Statutes.

This memorial, upon arrival, is to be swiftly and duly executed.

Respectfully memorialized.
With reverence observed.

The Three-Boundary Heavenly Worthies are titled thus: the Vast-Void Self-So Cavern-Real Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Supreme Dao Lord Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, and the Supreme Venerable Lord Cavern-Spiritual Dao-Virtue Celestial Worthy—no more may be added. For the Three Qi constitute the Great Dao, which in essence cannot be named; only when they coalesce into form are they called "Celestial Worthies," a designation reluctantly applied out of necessity. As for the titles "Supreme Dao Lord" and "Supreme Venerable Lord," these appear in ancient scriptures. In the establishment of teachings, there emerged the distinctions of Cavern-Real, Cavern-Mystery, and Cavern-Spiritual. Thus, the appellations of the Three Worthies are strictly limited to these.

In recent times, within the Orthodox Heart of Heaven Teachings, they are styled Jade Purity Supreme Emperor, High Purity Great Emperor, and Grand Purity Great Emperor—these being worldly honorifics, designating them as sovereigns. Beyond these, any arbitrary fabrication, driven by a fondness for novelty and eccentricity, verges on blasphemy.

For memorials and petitions submitted to the Yellow Register, as well as communications addressed to the Three Realms and all relevant domains:
Jade Purity, High Purity, Grand Purity, Luminous Heaven, Northern Culmen, Heavenly Sovereign, Queen of Earth, Eastern Culmen, Southern Culmen, Lord of Wood, Queen of Metal, Nine Heavens, Supreme Emperor, Thirty-Two Heavenly Supreme Emperors, Five Elder Heavenly Lords—all the above are to be presented in memorials.

Memorial to Jade Purity, and petition to the Seven Imperial Lords:
[Your] subordinate, [Name], of such-and-such rank and office, humbly submits:

Born of impure flesh and possessed of mediocre talent, I have been graced with profound karmic fortune and honored with the bestowal of sacred scriptures. Yet my merits remain unmanifest, while my transgressions are already evident. Only through delivering the manifest and rescuing the hidden may I hope to establish merit and redress my faults. Thus, though unworthy, I dare to trouble the exalted realms. Moreover, as I have received sincere entreaties, how could I refuse?

I respectfully report that a certain person of such-and-such village and lineage has petitioned to undertake the grand construction of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Great Retreat, praying for the sovereign’s well-being and the nation’s peace, the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors and the six clans of kin, and the universal salvation of the five paths and three destinies. Gathering all virtuous causes, I specifically seek to offer deliverance for the souls of the deceased, such-and-such, and to safeguard the living kin of such-and-such household.

Having previously submitted reports on several occasions, I now reverently prepare to conduct the ritual proceedings according to the established liturgy. The retreat shall commence on the appointed day of such-and-such month, beginning at dawn. For three days, the main retreat will proceed with nine audiences of memorials, summoning and delivering the souls of the deceased, as well as the myriad beings of the nine provinces and four seas, the ten thousand kinds of the four births, the five paths and three destinies, and all sunken souls and stagnant spirits, that they may partake of offerings, undergo refinement, attain ranks, and achieve rebirth. Upon completion, a pure offering shall be conducted for the three hundred and sixty divine positions, in grateful response.

May the boundless grace descend. Thus may the souls long trapped in the dark passes be delivered from drowning, and may this people ascend to the realm of longevity and well-being.

I, with utmost reverence and at peril of my life, submit this memorial to the Jade Augustness of the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Vacuous and Spontaneous, the Cavern-True, the Origin-Beginning. Humbly beseeching the compassion of the Dao, I pray that You grant me the authority to perform this deliverance. May You command the relevant true bureaus to oversee and enact the rites. I implore that Your grace and radiance descend to witness and validate this offering.

I, having presumptuously trespassed against the majesty of the Dao, am filled with trembling awe and await punishment. Respectfully submitted.

To the Jade Augustness of the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Cavern-Mystery, the Most High Dao Lord.
To the Jade Augustness of the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Cavern-Spirit, the Most High Lord Lao.
[The above three memorials follow the same format.]

To the Jade Emperor of Supreme Heaven, the August Thearch Who Opens Heaven, Holds the Talisman, Administers the Calendar, Embodies the True, and Upholds the Dao.
To the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Culmen of Central Heaven.
To the Great Emperor of the Celestial Thearch of the Star Palace of the Curved Array.
To the August Earthly Thearch Who Receives Heaven’s Mandate, Enacts the Law, and Embodies Profound Virtue, Vast and Illustrious.
[The above four memorials follow the same format as the Three Caverns, with "Celestial Compassion" substituted for the Three August Ones, and "Imperial Compassion" for the Earthly Thearch.]

Memorial to the Celestial Pivot Bureau for Presentation, in the same format as above.
Memorial to the Eastern Culmen.

Square Envelope, presented to the Azure Palace of the Eastern Culmen.
[Your] subordinate, [holding] the dharma-rank, [bearing] the surname [of] so-and-so, respectfully states:

The undersigned humbly notes that this memorial follows the same format as those for the Three Caverns.

With reverence, [I] transcribe the memorial once more and present it to the Jade August Thearch of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Culmen, the Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.

May the compassion of the Dao grant [Your] subordinate’s petition. May [You] specially issue a decree to the flying divine persons of the ten directions and primordial ultimate, the Youths Who Save from Suffering, and all the officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers under [Your] command.

In accordance with the already enacted [protocols], may [You] dispatch the Mandate of the Nine Dragons in all its details, sending it throughout the ten directions and three realms, to the night palaces, hidden chambers, bureaus of investigation and judgment, and all places of interrogation and jurisdiction.

May [You] open the gates and release the barred, absolve sins and dissolve grievances, deliver and ferry across the bound and recommended souls. Extending to the four seas and nine provinces, the three paths and ten thousand kinds, the wandering spirits and flying souls—all lonely and suffering beings—may they depart from the realms of suffering, assemble at the ritual altar, receive the grace of the Imperial Luminance, and ascend in due time.

[Your] subordinate, in presumptuous defiance of the majesty of the Dao, is without limit in dread and trepidation, awaiting punishment to the utmost.

Respectfully presented.

Memorial to the Southern Culmen.

To the Southern Culmen’s Imperial Abode,
Presented by the ritual-officiant minister of [such-and-such] rank, [Name].

Right: Your subordinate, reflecting on the shallowness of his virtue and the depth of his transgressions, grieves over his own impurity.  Who could have foreseen that in this flourishing age he would be bathed in the dark ford of the Dao?  Never having encountered a true master, he has no means to repay the favor.  Yet he dares to inscribe this deliverance-ferrying, hoping thereby to make slight amends for past faults.

Your subordinate respectfully submits the memorial of the Three Realms’ proceedings.  As the matter requires written record, he now presents it to His August Majesty the Southern Culmen’s Great Emperor of Long Life.

May the Celestial Compassion deign to grant your subordinate’s petition.  Let it be specially decreed that the Southern Vermilion-Heaven World and the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau dispatch refining-ferrying officials, lords, officers, and soldiers to descend to the ritual altar, where they shall refine and transform the delivered souls of the deceased, together with the lonely spirits of the Five Paths, Three Ways, Four Births, and ten thousand kinds.  May they ascend to the Vermilion Palace’s Flowing-Fire Court, their names inscribed on the Purple Register, and be transformed to be reborn.  Thus may the blessings of the ritual spread universally, the hidden and the manifest rejoice together, the myriad regions enjoy peace and prosperity, and all beings awaken to life.

Your subordinate, in presumptuous defiance of the majesty of the Dao, is without limit in dread and trepidation, awaiting punishment to the utmost.

Respectfully presented.

Memorial to the Mother of Metals and the Lord of Wood, each in a separate document.

It is commonly said that the Lord of Wood is the Great Emperor of the Eastern Vermilion Grove; this is a distinct office, not the Lord of Wood.  The Mother of Metals is sometimes called the Vermilion Sovereign Dao Lord; this too is a distinct office.  The supreme male perfected are called Dao Lords; the supreme female perfected are called Primordial Ladies.  She is also called the Primordial Lady Ancestress of the Myriad Qi; though a female perfected, this is yet another distinct office, not the Mother of Metals.  The ranks of the ancient Luo Heaven Offerings may be verified in the scriptures, liturgies, and memorials.  They should not be altered by common custom.

Metal and Wood are the root and origin of yin and yang, the domains of refining and ferrying.

Memorial to the Lord of Wood
To the Eastern Vermilion High Minister’s Office,
Presented by the ritual-officiant minister of [such-and-such] rank, [Name].

Right: Your subordinate, forgetting his own insignificance, has overstepped the bounds of the lofty.  He humbly implores the grace of pardon and begs to be spared punishment.

Your subordinate respectfully submits the memorial of the proceedings as before, recording it at the risk of death.

Presented to His August Majesty the Eastern Vermilion High Minister, the Lord of Wood, the Azure Lad Dao Lord.

May the Dao’s Compassion deign to grant your subordinate’s petition.

Having compassion for the humble learner, may the ritual’s merit be perfected.  May its blessings extend to the hidden and the manifest, its felicity embrace the cosmos entire.

Your subordinate has set the altar on [such-and-such] day to commence the rite of refining and ferrying souls.  Humbly beseeching the secret descent of the celestial effulgence of Qian, may the true yang’s life-giving qi be specially bestowed.

May it refine and deliver the bound souls of the departed, together with those in the Three Paths and Five Ways, the myriad kinds of the Four Births, and all hidden spirits.  May their nine orifices reopen, their hundred passages be remade, their surfaces and interiors become utterly transparent, their interiors and exteriors radiant with light.  May they return to their nature and gather their spirits, know their roots and recover their mandates, ascend to the realm of goodness, and together ascend to the immortal homeland.  May the darkest night awaken, heaven and earth be at peace.

Your subordinate has presumptuously offended the majesty of the Dao; his lowly feelings are overwhelmed with dread and fear as he awaits punishment.

Respectfully submitted.

Memorial to the Lady of Metal
To the Western Numinous Tortoise Terrace,
Presented by the ritual-officiant minister of [such-and-such] rank, [Name].

Right: Your subordinate’s memorial follows the previous form, recorded at the risk of death.

Presented to Her August Majesty the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Ninefold Numinous Supreme Perfected, the Lady of Metal, the Primordial Sovereign.

May Her Sagely Compassion deign to grant your subordinate’s petition.

Having compassion for the humble learner, may the ritual’s merit be perfected.

On such-and-such a day, your subordinate established the altar to commence the Rite of Refining and Deliverance for the Souls. Humbly beseeching the subtle effusion of the numinous essences from the Western Terrace, may the wondrous *qi* of true *yin* deign to descend. Thereby refining and purifying the souls of the departed, along with those in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all suffering spirits of the dark realms. May their nine orifices reopen, their hundred passages be remade, their inner and outer selves become utterly transparent, their inner and outer radiance restored. May they return to their nature and gather their spirit, return to their root and recover their destiny, transcend to the realm of goodness, and together ascend to the immortal homeland. May the darkest night awaken, heaven and earth be at peace.

Your subordinate has presumptuously offended the majesty of the Dao; his lowly feelings are overwhelmed with dread and trembling as he awaits punishment.

Respectfully submitted.

Memorial to the Emperor of the Nine Heavens
Presented by the ritual-officiant minister of [such-and-such] rank, [Name].

Right: Your subordinate, with utmost sincerity, ventures to lay bare his heart before the scrutiny of the celestial throne. Though of common and foolish nature, polluted in substance, I have been so favored as to bear the sacred texts. Charged with their propagation and entrusted with the salvation of souls, how dare I fail to bring every petition before Your August Majesty?

Your subordinate respectfully records the proceedings as before, at the risk of death, and presents this memorial to His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the Immeasurable Lifespan Heaven of *Uttarakuru*.

May His Celestial Compassion deign to grant your subordinate’s petition.

May it be specially decreed that the relevant true bureaus be notified to attend accordingly, so that upon the completion of the ritual fast, demonic obstacles shall not arise, blessings shall extend throughout the realm, and grace shall suffuse both family and state.

We humbly beseech the descent of the primordial *qi* of the Imperial Perfected Womb-Mandate—*Yuanyuan Huangyan*—to be spread below upon the ritual altar, to bathe and refine the departed souls of [Name] et al., as well as the beings of the Five Paths and Four Births, the myriad kinds of the Three Wretched Realms, and all lonely spirits. Thus may their skeletal remains be revived with *qi*, their shadows gather spirit, and they be washed in the mysterious stream, their Dao-nature re-enforced. May they know their roots and return to their mandate, fulfilling the accomplishment of life and creation.

Your subordinate, in presumptuous defiance of the celestial might, trembles with awe and dread. Respectfully submitted.

The nine memorials to the Nine Heavens shall follow the same format, altering only the sacred titles and the specified *qi*, to be written according to the *Shengshen* chapter. For the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, thirty-two memorials shall be used, with sacred titles transcribed as in the *Scripture of Salvation*.

The ritual-officiant minister of [such-and-such] rank, [Name], respectfully submits:

Right: Your subordinate, with dust-like sincerity, ventures to trouble the celestial heights. Reflecting upon my humble self—a dull vessel of this degenerate age, shamelessly sustained by grace—I have presumptuously received the Great Dao, though my virtue is meager and my transgressions profound. Yet, in my delusion, I dare to propagate its vastness, hoping to make some small amends.

Your subordinate respectfully records the proceedings as before and presents this memorial to His Celestial Majesty the Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign Yellow Canopy Heaven. With reverence, we await His Celestial Compassion.

May Celestial Compassion assent to this subordinate’s memorial. By special grace, bestow the radiance of favor to illumine and reflect upon the ritual altar. Confer and transmit the registers of the *Dongxuan* liturgy, that the subordinate officials, child-attendants, marshals, and officers of the Numinous Treasure bureaucracy may, in accordance with the statutes, receive their duties and accomplish the merit of the retreat. Still, we humbly beseech the spreading of the Numinous Treasure’s wisdom-light and the modeling of the Dao’s creation after the patterns of Heaven and Earth.

This is for the deliverance of the departed souls of [Name] and others, and for the five destinies, three paths of woe, the myriad kinds of the four births, and all hidden spirits—those who cling to emotion, embrace consciousness, dwell in darkness, and partake of the yin and yang. May their obscuring mists be swept away; may they drink from the dark dews and generate the vital fluids; may they take root and receive their ancestors; may they, in the realm of the indistinct, assume form; may they, moved by qi, congeal spirit.

Thus may the hidden paths be free of sunken and stagnant souls, and may the human world enjoy the blessings of great peace. May grace extend to the state and the household, and may its beneficence cover Hua and Yi alike.

This subordinate, having rashly affronted the Celestial Might, is overwhelmed with awe and trembling. Respectfully submitted.

On the [Day] of the [Month] in the year of the [Celestial Stem-Branch], the subordinate of [Rank], [Name], presents this memorial.

Here ends *Scroll Twenty-Eight of the Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure*.
Here begins *Scroll Twenty-Nine of the Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure*.

The Master of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, Keeper of the Southern Bureau’s Enforcement Codes, Provisional Youthful Aide of the Right Wing Governance Office, Jin Yunzhong, compiles:

**Memorial to the Heavenly Court for Atonement of Faults**
Presented by the Ritual Officer of [Rank], Minister [Surname, Name].
This minister, undeterred by the severity of punishment, ventures once more to lay bare his humble heart, beseeching Your compassion to pardon him from beginning to end.
As previously reported in the myriad memorials, a retreat of [X] days and nights was solemnly conducted for [Purpose]. A pure offering was held to give thanks, and the ritual procedures have been duly executed.
This minister humbly reflects that his capacity is base, his nature and understanding dim. Unversed in the teachings and statutes, he has failed to grasp their profound mysteries. He has violated prohibitions, misapplied the canons, erred in audience etiquette, and fallen short in memorials and petitions. His compositions have been verbose and irreverent; his talismans and seals, erroneous. Such transgressions have incurred the wrath of the Heavenly Court, and his name is inscribed on the Black Tablet. The entire altar trembles in fear, with no place to stand. This memorial is thus respectfully submitted.
Respectfully presented.

To the Venerable High Perfected of the Three Heavens’ Gate, Governors of the Supreme Mystery Capital:

May the True Compassion deign to incline its gaze and attend to this plea. We humbly beseech that this memorial be presented before the Heavenly Threshold, that pardon and absolution may be graciously bestowed. From the establishment of the retreat to its completion and dispersal, may all transgressions committed be expunged from the records of offenses, and all faults cleansed. Thus may the blessings of the retreat remain unblemished, and the living beings receive protection.

This minister, having presumptuously trespassed against the True Majesty, is overwhelmed with dread and awe. Respectfully submitted.

On the [day] of the [month] in the year of [Tai Sui], the memorialist, [Name], of such-and-such ritual rank, respectfully presents this petition.

**Petition of Gratitude and Atonement to the Youthful Primordial Mansion**
The memorialist, [Name], of such-and-such ritual rank, respectfully states:
This minister, undeterred by the severity of reproof, once again lays bare his humble plea.
[Text follows the previous memorial format.]

Respectfully presented.

**To the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Supporter of the Dao, Auxiliary of the Primordial, Orthodox Unity, Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord; and to the Four Sacred Seats:**
May the True Compassion deign to attend.
[Text follows the previous memorial format.]

**Dispatch Notice**
From the Great Lingbao Dharma Bureau:
Two urgent memorials are hereby dispatched, addressed to:
- The Three Heavens’ Gate, Supreme Mystery Capital;
- The Supreme Clarity Youthful Primordial Mansion.

This dispatch is respectfully issued.

**Dispatch Notice**

On the [day] of this month at [hour], the Duty Merit Officer and the Heavenly Direct Talisman Messenger shall swiftly traverse the cloud paths and urgently hasten the wind-borne chariot. May the sincere plea swiftly reach the celestial realms, and may the words of the memorial soon penetrate the true offices. Awaiting the divine response, may the numinous efficacy soon manifest.

Thus, this dispatch is issued.
In the [Tai Sui] year, [month], [day], [hour].

The two memorials of repentance are to be accompanied by repentance memorials to all the Perfected Ones of the Six Canopies, as both the Celestial Bureau and the Five Mansion Offices must receive them. The initial confession of transgressions includes the Celestial Master within the Six Canopies. Now, in addressing the Five Mansion Offices, the Celestial Master’s position cannot be omitted. However, for those who do not perform this rite, the memorial should be addressed solely to the Celestial Bureau.

Furthermore, regarding the **Announcement Placards for the Ritual Altar**:
The old placards prescribed in the ancient statutes were not excessively cumbersome. If augmented by俗 conventions, they risk becoming mere waste of paper and ink, without substantive benefit. For instance, in recent times, there have been oaths appended to proclamations for generals and officials, as well as separate disciplinary placards—obvious redundancies. Such superfluities abound. Here, only the indispensable placards are retained, following the old forms and recomposed as follows.

The **Placard for the Divine Tiger Altar** belongs under the *Divine Tiger Summoning Rites*. The **Proclamation to Enlighten Wandering Souls** belongs under the *Feeding and Universal Salvation Rites*. To facilitate the transcription of memorials and documents, all placards are gathered under the *Documents and Proclamations* section, while memorials remain a separate category.

**Placard for the Sequence of Ritual Stages in the Altar**

**Great Altar of the Yellow Register of Lingbao**

On [day] of this month, [Name] reverently establishes the **Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register of Lingbao**, lasting [number] days and nights. May it benefit the state and the realm, universally blessing all living beings. May it deliver the Five Paths and Three Wretched Realms, and liberate the Four Kinds of Birth and the myriad species. Gathering these meritorious fruits, it is dedicated to the deliverance of the deceased spirit of [Name], guiding them to a blessed realm.

The participants, united in this ritual, shall together uphold the supreme statutes. Proper regulations shall be established to avoid transgressing the numinous norms. The sequence of ritual proceedings shall be followed as outlined below.

[Details are fully expounded in the *Sequence of the Yellow Register*.]

This placard shall be prominently displayed in the altar space for all to know. All shall attire themselves properly, maintain solemn demeanor, and adhere to the prescribed forms. Conduct must be orderly, and memorial presentations must not breach ritual decorum. Together, let us devote our utmost sincerity to beseech the celestial response.

Thus, this placard is issued.
In the [Tai Sui] year, [month], [day].

**Placard for the Scripture Recitation**

**Altar of the Yellow Register**

On [day] of this month, [Name] reverently establishes the **Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register**. May it bring fortune to the state and peace to the times, deliver the hidden and aid the manifest, broadly benefit all beings, and universally save the Three Wretched Realms. Gathering all meritorious deeds, it is dedicated to the deliverance of the deceased [Name], hastening their ascent to the blessed realms.

Having already submitted the memorials and set the date for the ritual, we shall first, on [day], recite and expound the sacred scriptures. These shall be offered to the lofty Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, enlightening the wandering souls of all kinds. The scriptures and their categories are listed below:

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation of Lingbao from the Caverns of Mystery**,
**The Jade Chapters on the Spontaneous Generation of the Nine Heavens from the Caverns of Mystery of Lingbao**,
**The Central Scroll of the Numinous Writ of the Origin, the Great Brahma Hidden Words**,
**The Scripture on Constant Purity and Stillness Spoken by the Supreme Lord Lao**.

The above are offered to all the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Three Realms, and the lofty Perfected Ones of the altar and ritual.

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation of Lingbao from the Caverns of Mystery**,
**The Scripture on the Spontaneous Generation of the Numinous Chapters from the Caverns of Mystery of Lingbao**,
**The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**,
**The Central Scroll of the Numinous Writ of the Origin, the Great Brahma Hidden Words**,
**The Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court**.

The above are for the deliverance of the deceased spirit being offered.

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation of Lingbao from the Caverns of Mystery**,
**The Scripture on the Spontaneous Generation of the Numinous Chapters from the Caverns of Mystery of Lingbao**,
**The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue**,
**The Central Scroll of the Numinous Writ of the Origin, the Great Brahma Hidden Words**,
**The Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court**.

The above are for the deliverance of the Five Paths, Three Wretched Realms, Four Kinds of Birth, and all wandering souls.

We humbly submit: the jade tablets and numinous scrolls awaken the divine mechanism in the celestial realms; the golden writings and precious missives manifest wondrous transformations in the human world. They preserve the kalpas from endless cycles and universally save the manifest and hidden. Now, as the ritual period approaches and the scripture recitation begins, we rely on these meritorious deeds to beseech auspicious blessings.

May all participants in the ritual—feathered and robed, and the officiating altar officials—devote their utmost sincerity and focused minds. Let no stray thoughts arise, and let demeanor be solemn and conduct upright, ensuring no breach of ritual propriety. May we thereby move the Nine Clarities and secure peace for all beings. May the imperial domain endure, the altars of soil and grain flourish, the Chinese lands know peace, and the manifest and hidden be fully saved. Even as we deliver the deceased [Name] and universally save the submerged souls, may all partake of the wind of purity and attain the subtleties of the formless. May all beings of understanding together realize the non-action.

Thus, this placard is issued.
In the [year], [month], [day].

This **Scripture Placard** is for recording the recitations. After each evening’s recitation, the number of times each scripture was read shall be noted beneath its title. When the daily quota is met, the totals shall be tallied and recorded. This ensures no omissions or repetitions, and there is no need to predetermine the number of recitations, lest the quantity become excessive and sincerity wane.

The scriptures listed here differ somewhat from those used in recent times. According to the ancient Lingbao methods, as stated by [Name]: thirty-six days prior to the Yellow Register ritual, a scripture-recitation hall is prepared. The participants, united in the ritual, enter the oratory to fast and recite, abstaining from worldly affairs. With utmost sincerity, they recite the *Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation*, the *Scripture on the Spontaneous Generation of the Numinous Chapters of the Nine Heavens*, the two scrolls of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, and the *Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court*. The final days are devoted to rehearsing the rituals. This is the ancient method.

The term "entering the oratory" means to prevent worldly dust from intruding, maintaining inner and outer focus. There shall be no coming and going of people, nor idle chatter.

Only then may one preserve the spirits and recite the scriptures, contemplating the true and meditating upon the Dao—this is no reckless fabrication of "oratory" names, as in the Tiantai or Lingbao traditions, meant to deceive the world and mislead the people. Thus, the scriptures here number only four, not even a tenth of the countless others. Among them, truth and falsehood intertwine, right and wrong blur, and without exceptional discernment, one cannot easily distinguish them. Only the *Scripture of Limitless Salvation* and the *Nine Chapters on the Spontaneous Generation of the Numinous* stand as the most profound and ancient. Reciting them summons the flying heavens to descend in observation, and the myriad spirits to pay homage in reverence. For they are the celestial sounds that move the loftiest numina.

When summoning and calling forth the souls of the departed to hear the scriptures and receive the Dharma, the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue* contain the secrets of the Primordial Chaos. The *Inner Radiance*’s "Lute-Heart Formula" encompasses the mechanisms of creation and transformation. If the reciter penetrates deeply into the Mysterious Pivot, how could the departed souls not awaken instantly? Other scriptures may contain passages of wondrous meaning, yet the *Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Jade Scripture of the Yellow Court* defy exhaustive description by brush or tongue. Those of lofty and far-reaching learning will naturally grasp their essence. For the shallow and ignorant, this proclamation is thus issued—without such measures, it could not be called the Extraordinary Dao.

**Proclamation to the Divine Officials of the Altar of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast**

This altar, in strict accordance with the statutes of the Yellow Register, is subordinate to the Central Palace of the Lower Prime. It commands the myriad spirits, governs the nine bureaus, records the Three Realms above, and oversees the Six Heavens below. Its blessings extend universally, and none are beyond its deliverance. Its numinous radiance shines brightly, and all who are moved find response. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all may perform and honor it. From the hidden gates to the sunlit realms, it encompasses all in its nurturing embrace.

Now, the sponsor of this fast, [Name], offers precious faith and earnest devotion, humbly beseeching to conduct this fast and rite, wishing to aid both the living and the dead. Thus, in accordance with the established forms, the petition is transcribed, the rites are prepared, the altar is arrayed, the offerings are set forth, the roles are assigned, the fast is observed, the scriptures are recited, the Dao is practiced, oaths are sworn to heaven and earth, memorials are presented, the departed are summoned and delivered, and all suffering souls in the hidden realms are universally called forth. The Three Paths and Five Ways are broadly traversed, and the myriad kinds of the Four Births are universally assisted. Transgressions are cleansed, bondage is released, and the departed are led from the dark prisons to the altar, where they hear the Dharma, receive the scriptures, partake of the offerings, and attain deliverance.

Above, we pray for the eternal stability of the imperial domain, the boundless longevity of the sage ruler, the harmony of the six qi, the well-being of the four peoples, the cessation of war and smoke, and the abundance of harvests. Gathering this meritorious affinity, we specifically dedicate it to the deliverance of the souls of the departed, [Name] and others, extending to the nine ancestors and seven generations, the five tones and six clans, the recently departed spirits, and all who have gone before. May they transcend the heavy yin, dissolve their accumulated impurities, ascend to the Crimson Palace, refine their forms in the Cinnabar Heaven, gather their qi to unite with the true, and return their natures to clarity.

Next, we pray for the peace and prosperity of the household and the harmony of all kin. Yet we fear that the altar grounds may not be solemn, the prohibitions may not be strictly observed, and that lesser officials, polluted by defilements and impure dust, may profane the sacred precincts, violate the prohibitions, disrupt the order, or transgress the regulations. Or perhaps the earthbound deities may be negligent in their duties, the messengers may delay in transmitting reports, the guardian spirits may fail in their vigilance, or the local deities may not exert themselves diligently. Any flaw in the fast’s merit would truly violate the Jade Statutes. The gravity of the matter is immense, and the standards are not to be taken lightly. As the appointed time has arrived, it is fitting to make this known.

This proclamation is posted before the altar, calling upon the divine officials of the Lingbao tradition, the myriad spirits in their roles, the celestial generals of the Five Primes and Elemental Bureaus, the lords of the thunder departments, and all deities with jurisdiction over the altar. Reverently adhere to the statutes of the Yellow Register and jointly uphold the standards of the Lower Prime. Lead your subordinates and troops, assemble with the city gods of this place, supervise the local deities, guard the altar’s boundaries, pacify the directions, drive away malevolent vapors, and sweep clean all defilements. Should any resist or encroach, immediately report them to the authorities, swiftly deliver them to the Heavenly Prison, investigate according to the law, and execute punishment.

All memorials, documents, talismans, and commands shall be conveyed and transmitted without obstruction. Spread the blessings of the Nine Pures and Ten Poles, deliver those bound in the Three Realms and Ten Directions. Pray for the gaze of the Imperial Perfected, that this fast may be free of demonic interference. Exert yourselves to revive and universally save all. When the altar is dismantled and the rites conclude, present the memorial to report the merit, following the rites of the Supreme Perfected to give thanks for the divine favor.

**Proclamation issued on the [Day] of [Month], [Year].**

**Summons of the Divine Tiger for the Ritual Altar**

**High Priest of the Ritual, [Surname] [Given Name], Seal**

**Yellow Register Grand Fast Altar Summons**

This altar, on the [Day] of this month, shall establish the Yellow Register Grand Fast for [Purpose]. In accordance with the ritual codes, we hereby summon and deliver all bound souls—each household’s ancestral spirits, those in the Five Paths and Three Wretched Realms, the Four Births and Ten Thousand Kinds, all who cling to consciousness and bear awareness, lingering in darkness and sinking in obscurity. Let them manifest in form, receive deliverance, and attain liberation.

As recorded in the sacred jade scrolls and purple registers, the great rites for universal salvation are set forth; in the vermilion texts and golden writs, the protocols for summoning souls are made manifest. We dispel the gloom of the Nine Springs and rescue the myriad realms from their abyssal depths. We issue the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands to bestow grace, and dispatch the Seven Bureau Jade Maidens to proclaim the decree. Male and female officers, left and right, ascend the Three Realms and descend the Six Heavens. Yang illuminates the yin spirits, pursuing the host of souls and gathering the legions of ghosts. Summons shall not be delayed for even a moment; responses shall be immediate. Thus is the divine work of the Great Dao accomplished, fulfilling the earnest prayers of the imperial subjects. All shall be gathered and made manifest.

A sacred altar has been established; all must be duly notified.

**This Proclamation is addressed to:**
The officials of the Northern Culmen Mystic Range Prefecture, the Seven Perfected Jade Maidens, and all relevant officers of this bureau responsible for pursuit and summoning.

In obedience to the True Talismans and the issuance of the Jade Writs, you are to traverse the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Five Peaks and Nine Netherworlds, the Ten Caves and Six Heavens, the Nine Provinces and Ten Thousand Lands. Visit the sacred mountains and blessed sites, the rivers, seas, and their sources, the altars of ancestral rites, the city gods and earth deities, the Yellow Springs and Barrows of the Dead, the dark roads and gates of the underworld, the bureaus governing souls and spirits, and the courts weighing sins and blessings. Pursue and summon without delay, root out and trace all bound souls and obscured spirits of the myriad kinds. Dispatch officers and generals to escort their forms and souls, bringing them forth from the nightly abodes to attend the ritual, where they shall manifest upon the spirit banners and respond to the summons. Upon the completion of the rite, a memorial shall be presented to recount the merit.

**Proclamation issued on the [Day] of [Month], [Year].**

**High Priest of the Ritual, [Dharma Rank] [Surname] [Given Name], Seal**

**Exhortation to Altar Officers**

In the establishment of fasts and the performance of rites, the High Priest presides over the altar, his rank surpassing all others—such is the law of the fast. Yet those who share the altar are but fellow disciples, united by the assembly of officers and collectively revering the High Priest. The High Priest, too, ought to conduct himself with humility and restraint. Recently, some have issued proclamations to strictly govern the altar assembly, imposing constraints upon the officers—this is not an appropriate measure. Henceforth, only the High Priest’s name shall be recorded, exhorting the altar officers, that this may be deemed fitting.

I have heard that the Great Dao first opened the Way, and the exalted perfected took pity on all beings. The primordial teachings were established to deliver beings across kalpas, unfolding the twenty-seven ranks of fasts and the forty-two grades of rites. They harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, safeguarding the state and securing the household. Thus were the ranks of the Registers of Destiny ordained, and the offices of proclamation and transmission established. Those who receive the teachings and perform the rites are the very ones who deliver the hidden and save the manifest.

If one can exhaust sincerity in every matter, one may accumulate merit and transcend the world. To maintain unwavering devotion, one must uphold the ritual codes without fail. Should one’s conduct breach propriety or one’s heart harbor reckless intentions, the vast and boundless heavens will be difficult to move, and the luminous and impartial divine law may impose punishment. Transgressions shall be recorded in the offices of the Three Officials, and faults shall be marked in the palaces of the Five Emperors. One must fear the depletion of lifespan and the dissipation of fortune, even the descent of the soul and the fall of the body.

As for myself—a humble scholar of the mountains and forests, a wanderer of rivers and seas—my studies have been diligent, yet I have not encountered a true master to transmit the teachings. My practice has been rough and long, yet by the grace of the Most High, I have been shown forbearance. However, no matter the weight or triviality of the matter, no fast is too great or small. It wholly depends on the altar officers and fellow practitioners, who must unite in heart to assist and mend any shortcomings. With mutual support, left and right, we guide beings toward virtuous merit. From reverent beginning to diligent end, we strive to perfect the rites. In ascent and descent, let there be harmony and smoothness in proclamation and transmission. Let no action transgress the true codes, and let no thought stray from the Great Dao.

Rectify the heart and sincerify the intent; revere the rites and uphold the rules. If the heart grows lax while the form remains reverent, one will swiftly incur the punishment of deceiving Heaven. If the intent is sincere and the principle pure, one will avoid the fault of violating the codes. One must be inwardly and outwardly devoted, body and mind wholly sincere. Even in private, among beloved friends, there shall be no jesting within the altar. Those who harbor resentment in daily life must not dare to indulge anger during the fast.

The propagation of the great transformation is no trivial matter. In the presence of the exalted perfected, one must examine oneself. May you heed these words with clarity and together witness my earnest heart.

**I, [Name], respectfully submit this exhortation.**

**Proclamation to the Lonely Souls**

**Supreme Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure**

On the [Day] of this month, this bureau, on behalf of [Name], shall establish the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. We shall widely set forth the offering of grain, universally delivering all lonely souls and the multitudes of the departed.

Some met their end through execution, their heads severed from their bodies; others drowned in rivers or hanged themselves, dying unnatural deaths. Some perished with broken bones and torn sinews, or fell in battle; others succumbed to chronic illness, their viscera and hearts burdened with stagnation. Some suffered from swelling, pain, sores, and ulcers, their limbs rotting away; others plunged from cliffs or were crushed by falling trees, their bodies shattered. All, in their time of life and while embodied, met untimely ends, losing the proper way of death. Their deluded attachments left them bound in darkness, their homeless souls lingering endlessly.

Yet the human body is but a temporary convergence. The five grains and five flavors nourish the flesh; hands grasp, feet walk, ears hear, and eyes see. Hunger and cold, satiety and warmth, a thousand movements and a hundred actions—none of these arise from the skin, muscles, blood, or flesh alone. Rather, they are born of this single spirit, gathered as divine qi. When spirit congeals and qi flows, the five flavors are generated. When qi scatters and spirit flees, the hundred bones cannot endure. Thus, though limbs may be maimed and flesh incomplete, the heavy and turbid essence is but a material thing. The office of the single spirit—how can it be harmed?

Yet the obscured souls and lingering spirits, the lonely souls and bound spirits, some bearing knives and bound by ropes, dwell in the dark gates...

Some suffer decapitation or mutilation, lost in ghostly realms. Those who perished from illness remain bound to their chronic afflictions; those who died in childbirth are forever steeped in blood and stench. At times their forms appear in hazy visions, or their likenesses manifest in dreams—this is but the damage their corpses suffered in the world of men. How could their souls and spirits be scattered and forsaken in the nether regions?

The four elements and the hundred bones are but vessels of qi and blood, from which issue the foulness of blood, filth, and decay. Though the spirit has returned to emptiness and the body has crumbled into dust, the putrid remnants of their material form defile the departed spirits. In life, humans possess spirit; in death, they become ghosts. Yet blades and ropes, devoid of consciousness or emotion, serve their purpose in a single moment before rotting away—how could such mindless things cling to a ghost’s form? Material objects may wound the physical body, but once the soul has departed, how can it bear such tangible burdens? The truth is plain, the principle resoundingly clear.

This delusion stems from clinging to the physical frame and lingering attachment to the corpse. The dead recall only the moment of their passing, the wretchedness of their end. Meanwhile, the spirits in the dark realm, still bound by old memories, fix their thoughts upon the realm of form. Thus, their appearance remains as it was at the moment of death, their ghostly confusion shaping their form, while the living, in their doubt, perceive their likeness.

Yet how can they not know that a body may be whole or broken, a form healthy or afflicted? The body does not endure—where then can suffering reside? To cling to the injuries of life even after death is already folly. For a bodiless soul to fret over the pains of its former existence—is this not sheer foolishness?

Though their fates may differ in ascent or descent, most are ensnared by their own attachments. We have already petitioned the officials of the Divine Treasure, the myriad spirits who hold office, to enlighten the lonely souls and awaken their true nature. It also falls to those gathered at the altar to deeply comprehend this truth. All who met violent ends—those stained by blood and filth, those who died in agony—must understand that their ruined bodies need not be clung to. The enlightened spirit may ascend of its own accord; do not let deluded attachments bind you, nor linger over the corpse.

The moment of awakening is like emerging from a darkened alley. Those who perished from wounds no longer see their wounds. Those who died in filth are no longer defiled. Those who suffered from disability are no longer disabled. Those who were deaf or mute now hear and speak clearly. A single nature, unbound and harmonious, dissolves all delusions at once—yet how can love and attachment be so easily severed?

If longing persists without end, if grudges are not swiftly forgotten, how then can retribution be resolved? When they come to the altar, all enmity is dissolved in an instant. Moreover, wealth and fame cannot last forever; gold, jewels, and treasures cannot follow one into death. The body is gone—how can material things still be cherished? At this point, poverty is no burden, riches no glory. All worldly concerns fade, the heart turns, and thoughts shift. The scattered spirit is gathered, the divine form restored. Bathed in the dawn of truth, they partake of offerings and receive blessings. Tempered by the numinous essence of Great Harmony, refined by the radiant brilliance of cinnabar and lightning, they return to their true nature, transcend life and death, ascend to the blessed realms, and empty the hells. This is the supreme cause and condition—now is the time for deliverance.

Let this proclamation be made clear.

**Notice:**
This proclamation is hereby posted to enlighten the lonely souls gathered at the altar. Let all take heed.

**Proclamation.**
*Dated: [Year] [Month] [Day]*
*Sealed by the High Priest [Name].*

I, Yunzhong, have privately examined the rites of altar construction, which adhere to ancient traditions. The documents and petitions serve to embody the form and convey the matter. Yet if the procedures are followed with precision and applied appropriately, there is no need for excessive elaboration. If one’s virtue is insufficient to move the netherworld, or one’s learning has not penetrated the sacred canons, then even a thousand words and ten thousand scrolls would be in vain.

For dispersed-altar jiao rites, it suffices to present an offering document. Since the main fast and memorial have already been conducted to invite the descent of the deities, no separate invitation is needed. However, for ordinary rites not part of a grand fast but dedicated to a specific jiao, separate invitations and offerings should be prepared for each deity.

For jiao rites following a fast, no invitation document is required—this follows the method of Master Guangcheng for descending spirits and setting up the jiao, not one devised by the officiant. As for the deities to be invoked in the jiao, they should correspond to those mentioned in the memorials and petitions, as well as the relevant officers and scribes from the fast. All should be duly honored.

Recently, memorials have been submitted extensively, yet the jiao rites may include only sixty or so deities, without reference to the original petitions. This is illogical. Beyond petitioning the Celestial Emperor, one should also submit documents to the authorities of the Three Realms, requesting the release of sinful souls. The dark prisons and nether dungeons are not places where the writs of ritual officers hold sway. Thus, for matters concerning the earthly realm, petitions are addressed only to the sovereigns of Fengdu and the officials of the underworld, so that the departed souls may be delivered. The sovereigns will then issue decrees to the prisons under their jurisdiction, leaving no soul beyond redemption.

Yet if the sincerity of the fast fails to reach the heavens and no celestial mandate is granted, even if documents are dispatched in succession, the underworld may not comply. Moreover, the hells of the middle and lower realms are beyond count. Scriptures and treatises vary in their accounts—such as the *Immortal Precepts Sutra*, the *Orthodox Unity Scripture*, and the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution*—some speak of eighteen hells, others of thirty-six, or the Three Officials’ twenty-four hells. These are but summaries.

In the shadowy and obscure regions, the dark and hidden realms, bureaus record transgressions, examine the sins of souls, and imprison them. Such offices are established everywhere, with countless officials and infinite multitudes. Yet their authority ultimately rests with the Northern Emperor of Fengdu. The Lords of the Six Heavens and the Ten Palace Lords are among the highest of these officials, while the Four Bright Real Lords and the Ghost Officers of the Northern Dipper are among the most essential of their subordinates.

Thus, each has been reported in detail. As for the remaining hells, since their names cannot all be enumerated, the documents and missives of the earthly prisons are no longer employed. When talismanic decrees are issued and reports are made known, the governing bureaus shall naturally transmit them to their respective dark prisons. Those who propagate teachings and seek to alarm the senses with warnings of sin and fortune may proceed as they see fit—this format need not be followed.

*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Twenty-Nine concludes.

**Section on Memorials and Decrees**
**Memorial of the Five Venerable Lords of the Dao**
A sealed memorial, addressed to the Palace of the Azure Spirit Heavenly Lord of the East; the remaining four memorials follow the same format.

[Your] subordinate, [Name], of such-and-such ordination rank, humbly submits:
With utmost sincerity, [I] dare to present this matter for Your Celestial Attention. Reflecting upon [my] long-held office, [I] have failed to render meritorious service. Hoping to atone for past faults, [I] have resolved to benefit and deliver all beings.

[I] respectfully submit this memorial, recording the matter as previously stated, and present it to Your Majesty, the Azure Spirit First Elder Heavenly Lord of the East. Earnestly beseeching the compassion of the Dao, may You deign to approve [my] petition and bestow radiant illumination upon the altar, acknowledging the sincerity of the fast. May good deeds be accomplished and the hidden and manifest realms be uplifted. Thus may grace extend to households and nations, and blessings permeate the world. Further, [I] implore the secret bestowal of the life-essence of the Five Qi, to refine and restore the myriad obstructed souls, that all may be revived and restored to life.

[I] have presumptuously offended the majesty of the Dao; [my] humble sentiments are overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial for the Appointment of an Assistant to the Six Offices**

To the Sacred Enclosure, I humbly present myself at the Palace of the Numinous Treasure Jade Master—or as it may also be styled, the Gate of Instruction. I, [Your] servant [of] such-and-such dharma rank and surname, dare not shrink from the penalty for presumption and irreverence, but venture to lay [this petition] before the audience of the Most Perfect.

I reflect with trepidation that [my] person abides in the defiled realm while [my] awareness races along the numinous path. [My] devotions at dawn have strayed from the proper course, and [my] diligence has lapsed, leaving many faults uncorrected. Yet, though [I] linger in this residual life, [I] still bear the burden of boundless grace. Now, having been graciously permitted to serve in office, [I] desire to propagate the Great Teaching, and know that nothing precedes the deliverance of beings.

Recently, [I] have received petitions from those seeking ordination, whose sincerity truly demands the salvation of both the hidden and manifest realms. In duty and principle, [such requests] ought to be endorsed and transcribed; to suppress or reject them would be untenable. Yet, measuring [my] own transgressions—threefold in their offenses against discernment—[I] find it difficult to revive the deluded souls lost in the ninefold darkness. Without the aid of compassionate mercy, how could [this] task be accomplished?

[I] have consulted the ancient rites and fasts of the Numinous Treasure tradition, which originate from the *Lingbao* scriptures. Only those who have received and wear the registers of the *Dongxuan* section may properly ascend the altar to assume office. At present, however, [I] have been unable to ensure that all candidates fully meet the prescribed standards. Thus, within the Six Offices, [I] have provisionally employed disciples of the various ranks of the *Zhengyi* tradition to fill positions and undertake duties. [I] fear that this may fall short of the established canon, and so, with due caution, [I] have arranged for the provisional appointment of altar officials and dharma officers, whose names are listed above. This matter requires Your attention and report.

Respectfully submitted to:
The Numinous Treasure Master of Deliverance,
The Numinous Treasure Master of Registers,
The Numinous Treasure Master of Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Who Upholds the Teaching and Assists the Primordial, Orthodox Unity, Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord,
and the Most Venerable Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

May the True Compassion deign to review and approve.

Granting provisional arrangements to fulfill these duties may, with hope, extend grace to both the hidden and the manifest realms. [I] further beseech that [this matter] be presented to the Celestial Court, petitioning for decrees to be issued from the Three Palaces and Five Emperors, that the respective Perfected Bureaus may oversee and enact them accordingly.

[Your] servant has rashly presumed upon the awe of the Masters’ authority; [my] humble sentiments are overwhelmed with dread and trembling.

Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial for Praying for Clear Skies, Presented to the Five Bureaus**
Now sealed and respectfully addressed to the Primordial Response Palace of the Grand Sovereign.

[Your] servant, holding the dharma rank of [Name],
dwells entangled in the dusty net of the world, [his] name blemishing the Mystic Bureau. Though bearing the sacred texts, [he] has yet to receive true investiture. Repeatedly trespassing upon the august hearing [of the Perfected], [his] offenses are beyond pardon. Yet [he] dares to hope for boundless compassion, that [his] transgressions may be graciously forgiven.

Recently, according to the petition of [Name] and others, [they] chose [Date] to establish at [Location] a grand *Huanglu* fast, for the blessing of the state and the well-being of the age, to deliver the hidden and succor the manifest. Yet [your] servant’s learning is shallow, his immortal rank unfulfilled. Reluctantly opening the altar, [he] has committed many errors and omissions. Below, [he] fears the lingering of uncleansed malevolence; above, [he] dreads the untimeliness of wind and rain. Moreover, at the site where the altar is now established, some regions harbor hidden perversities, some grounds conceal ominous portents. Without relying on the Masters’ compassion, the good fruit cannot be fully realized. This matter requires recording and reporting.

Respectfully submitted.

Before the sacred presence of the Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Auxiliary of Primordial *qi*, Grand Master of Orthodox Unity, the Tranquil and Responsive Perfected Lord; the Northern Culmen’s Perfected Lord of Dark Martiality, Protector and Sage, Numinously Responsive; the Perfected Lord Who Assists the Sagely and Preserves Virtue, Treasuring Felicity; the Perfected Lord, Vice Marshal of Heavenly Strategy; and the Perfected Lord, Marshal of the Heavenly Legion:

Reverently may the Perfected Ones’ compassion deign to look down in merciful assent. May [this petition] be specially presented before the Celestial Threshold, that an edict be issued to the thunderous and lightning-wielding [deities], the winds, rains, clouds, and lightning—all under the jurisdiction of the Perfected Offices. At the appointed time, may clouds and mists be gathered and restrained, rain halted, winds stilled, malevolent vapors swept away, and Heaven and Earth purified. May the Three Luminaries shine resplendent, the Four *qi* clarified and serene.

Further, may [the Perfected Ones] dispatch and send down the officers and functionaries of the *Jiehui* and *Yinggan* [bureaus], who shall descend as one to supervise and command the local deities of the altars, domains, and altars of soil and grain in [Location]. With united effort and single mind, may they sweep clean the dust and filth, dispel and purge the noxious vapors, rectify and solemnify the fast-altar, and pacify and secure the boundaries. Should any demonic spirits transgress or malevolent specters intrude, may the dispatched officers and functionaries promptly seize and bind them, escorting them to the Celestial Prison for punishment and execution.

Thus may the fast’s merit be perfected, and demonic obstructions not arise.

[Your] servant...

Having presumptuously trespassed upon the august authority of the Master, [this servant] trembles with utmost dread. Humbly submitting this memorial.

A single memorial is hereby prepared in duplicate, to be presented at the Gate of the Three Heavens to the Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau.

The foregoing memorial, submitted in proper form to the Celestial Bureau, is summarized as follows. Further adjustments may be made as circumstances require at the appointed time. Should the nature of the rites differ, modifications may be incorporated accordingly.

[Your] servant, [Name], holding the duly appointed rank of Ritual Master, now presumes—though it risks repeated transgression and invites the severest punishment—to prostrate himself and implore the boundless grace of the Perfected Ones, that [his] offenses be mercifully pardoned.

Recently, [your] servant received a petition from [Name] of [Place], who humbly entreats the establishment of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Grand Fast, to bless the realm and bring prosperity to the age, deliver the hidden and succor the manifest, transcend the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages, and broadly aid the five destinies and three paths. By amassing this virtuous merit, [the petitioner] seeks to deliver the deceased [Name], enabling their transcendence, and to safeguard the well-being of their living kin.

Having reverently assembled the ritual tradition, [your] servant has undertaken the rites as follows. Now that the fast’s schedule is fixed, each detail must be duly reported:

1. On [Date], the fast shall be proclaimed. The rites shall commence with the *Suqi* vigil and altar establishment. At [Time] on that day, the *Plain Chariot and White Steed Petition* shall be presented. That night at [Time], the *Breaking Open Fengdu and Delivering from Sin Petition* shall be presented, along with the proclamation of the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decrees: the *Golden Register and White Tablet of Salvation from Suffering*, the *Perfected Talisman of the Most High for Breaking Open Earth’s Prisons*, the *Perfected Talisman of the Most High for Delivering the Hidden Souls*, the *Precious Register of the Most High’s Edict for Pardoning and Ascending to Heaven*, the *Primordial Beginning’s Talismanic Decree of the Numinous Treasure Fundamental Rites*, and the *Jade Tablet of the Chaos Origin Spirit-Tiger*. These shall be proclaimed to all heavens and earths, the yin and yang sovereign bureaus, the three realms and ten directions, the dark passes and hidden roads, the celestial prisons and earthly hells, and all relevant jurisdictions. In accordance with the talismanic decrees, the imprisoned and petitioned souls, along with the five destinies, three paths, four births, and ten thousand kinds—all lingering spirits and stagnant souls—shall be pardoned. Ancient transgressions, accumulated karmic debts, and long-standing grievances shall all be absolved. Following the jade tablet’s command, they shall be summoned to the altar to receive deliverance and enact the rites.

2. On [Date], the main fast shall be observed, with three audiences before the Perfected Ones and scripture recitation while pacing the Dao. At noon, the *Crimson Memorial to the Celestial Court for Deliverance from Suffering* and the *Petition for Opening the Roads* shall be presented. In the stillness of night, the prisons shall be broken open, and the souls of the petitioned [Name] and others, along with the five destinies, four births, three paths, and ten thousand kinds—all lonely spirits—shall be summoned to bathe, pay homage to the Perfected Ones, and partake in the offerings.

3. On the second day of the main fast, three audiences before the Perfected Ones shall again be held, with scripture recitation while pacing the Dao. At [Time], the *Petition for Bathing and Alchemical Transmutation* shall be presented. That night, the three paths, five destinies, ten kinds, and four births—all lonely spirits—shall undergo alchemical transmutation, receive talismans, take precepts, and be delivered and transformed to transcendence.

4. On the third day of the main fast, three audiences before the Perfected Ones shall again be held, with scripture recitation while pacing the Dao. At [Time], the *Petition for Ascending and Delivering the Deceased Souls* shall be presented. That night, the souls of the petitioned [Name] and others shall undergo alchemical transmutation, receive talismans, take precepts, and be delivered and transformed to transcendence.

5. On [Date], the *Crimson Memorial of Merit Report* shall be presented, and a grand offering shall be conducted for the lofty Perfected Ones of the Three Realms, encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine ranks, to manifestly requite their grace. The altar shall be dismantled, the feast concluded, and the dragon tablet and memorial slip deposited, with the fast’s merit inscribed and recorded.

The foregoing is respectfully submitted to the sovereign high Perfected Ones of the Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau at the Gate of the Three Heavens. [Your] servant humbly beseeches their true compassion to deign to grant assent. May they specially present this memorial to the Celestial Court and obtain the decree to proclaim it to all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, the three realms and three origins, the grotto-heavens and sea mountains, the dark passes and hidden wilds, the halls of sacrificial deities, and all relevant jurisdictions, that it be swiftly enacted.

Thus may the commands resound universally, and the sincerity ascend above. Further, may the Three Luminants shine brilliantly, the Four *qi* become radiant and clear, the ten thousand sages flank the imperial carriage, and the thousand Perfected attend the imperial progress. May the celestial blessings permeate the cosmos, the fast’s merit extend to the hidden and manifest, the six extremes share in repose, and the four births all attain peace.

[Your] servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon the true authority [of the Perfected Ones], deserves ten thousandfold punishment.

A respectful memorial is hereby presented.

**Memorial to the Northern Dipper**
In a square envelope, respectfully submitted to the Star Palace of the Central Heavenly Northern Dipper.

[Your] servant, [Name], holding the dharma rank, humbly lays bare his foolish heart, presuming to trespass upon the true hearing [of the Perfected Ones]. Though unworthily practicing the Great Dao and passing the seasons in vain, [his] learning has not penetrated the obscure, and no path exists for self-offering. Yet he dares to exert himself in benefiting and saving [beings], thereby repaying the grace of blessings.

[Your] servant respectfully states that, as the matter at hand necessitates, this memorial is recorded and submitted for your hearing.

The above is respectfully set forth and presented to the Great Sage Northern Dipper Nine-Star True Lords of Central Heaven. May the true compassion [of the Perfected Ones] graciously grant assent to the petition. May it be specially proclaimed at the celestial court and announced to the true offices governing the three realms, that they may act in accordance with the Dao and respond accordingly. Thus may the merit of the fast be accomplished and its blessings extend to the manifest and hidden.

Further, may it be commanded to the Northern Culmen Mysterious Model Prefecture to dispatch the Divine Tiger Chief Officers, the two envoys He and Qiao, to await the Three Departments’ Pursuing-Soul Envoys of Wei and Zhang, along with the Jade Maidens of the Seven Offices, the relevant officials, generals, and soldiers, all to descend together and proceed to [your] servant’s ritual office. Bearing the jade missives, may they traverse the dark passes and hidden paths, all relevant jurisdictions, to root out and summon the souls of the deceased [Name] and others being offered, as well as those of the five destinies and three paths, the four births and ten thousand kinds, all sunken spirits and stagnant souls. May they arrive at the altar in due time to report and respond, erase the records of transgressions, extinguish the roots of evil, listen to the Dao and hear the scriptures, and ascend in timely deliverance.

May the cloud chariots deign to descend and witness the sincerity of the fast. [Your] servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon the true authority [of the Perfected Ones], is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial to the Palace of the Sun**
In a square envelope, respectfully submitted to the Palace of the Grand Yang Sun.

[Your] servant, [Name], holding the dharma rank, presumptuously disturbs the Radiant Brilliance, wishing to turn the profound gaze [of the Sun]. Reflecting upon [his] humble receipt of resources and coarse inadequacy, [he] has presumptuously joined the ranks of the worthy. Measuring [his] offenses and probing [his] guilt, how dare he think of making amends? Yet, in reverent compliance with the plea, he dares not fail to make it known above.

[Your] servant respectfully states that, as the matter at hand necessitates, this memorial is recorded and submitted for your hearing.

The above is respectfully set forth and presented to the Grand Yang Emperor of the Sun Palace. May the true compassion [of the Perfected One] graciously grant assent. May the immortal retinue briefly detour to look upon the fast altar, oversee the prayers and supplications, and fully accomplish the fast’s affairs. Thus may grace pervade the cosmos and blessings extend to the hidden and manifest.

On [Date], [your] servant will refine and deliver the beings of the five destinies, three paths, four births, and ten thousand kinds. On [Date], [your] servant will refine and deliver the souls of the offered [Name] and others. May [the Sun] deign to spread forth divine radiance, descend the flow of true *qi*, match water with fire, harmonize yin and yang, restore each to clarity of nature and consciousness, and fully raise and transform all from the depths of obscurity.

[Your] servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon the true authority [of the Perfected One], is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

Respectfully submitted.

**Petition to the Lunar Palace**
Enclosed in a square envelope, respectfully presented to the Palace of the Great Yin Moon. The petition follows the same format as that to the Solar Palace.

**Petition to the Nine August Ladies of the Northern Dipper**
Enclosed in a square envelope, respectfully presented to the court of the Nine August Ladies of the Northern Dipper. Your servant, [Name], a ritual master of the duly conferred rank, presumptuously ventures to address the Celestial Bureau. Deeply aware of my overreaching, I yet dare to hope for leniency. I reflect that I, a mere insignificant being, have presumptuously undertaken the practice of the Great Dao. Without merit to record, I have sins enough to inscribe. May I but deliver the manifest and the hidden, and in some small measure seek to make amends. In all matters of supplication, I dare not fail to make this known.

Your servant, in accordance with ritual necessity, respectfully submits this petition for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted to the Nine August Ladies of the Northern Dipper. Humbly beseeching your true compassion, deign to grant your assent. May you graciously dispatch the Divine Tiger, Chief Officer He Qiao, the Seven Bureau Jade Maidens, and the Three Divisions’ Soul-Summoning Envoys, along with all relevant officials, generals, and soldiers, to attend my ritual bureau. Bearing the Jade Edict, may they traverse the ten directions and three realms, the hells and nether gates, and all the myriad spirits who hold office in the underworld courts. May they summon and seize the beings of the five destinies, four births, three paths, and ten thousand kinds—all the orphaned souls and lingering spirits—as well as the souls of the offered [Name] and others. May these be delivered from the yin realms, gathered at the numinous altar, their forms made manifest, and their karmic retributions made clear. I further beseech that you deign to dispatch your divine retinue to descend upon the fast’s altar, to accomplish the meritorious work and bear witness to the rites performed. Your servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon your true authority, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Petition to the Five Virtue Star Lords**
Each petition, enclosed in a square envelope, is presented to the Palace of the Wood Virtue Star of the East. Your servant, [Name], a ritual master of the duly conferred rank, ventures to express his sincere devotion and look up to your exalted brilliance. I dare to hope that your great compassion may graciously extend your favor and protection.

Your servant, in accordance with ritual necessity, respectfully submits this petition for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted to the True Lord of the Year Star of the Wood Virtue of the East. Humbly beseeching your true compassion, deign to grant your assent. May you dispatch your divine retinue to descend upon the fast’s altar, to witness the prayers and supplications and bear witness to the rites performed. Thus may grace pervade the cosmos and blessings extend throughout heaven and earth. On the night of the proper fast of [Date], your servant will refine and deliver the beings of the five destinies, three paths, four births, and ten thousand kinds—all orphaned souls. On the night of [Date], your servant will refine and deliver the souls of the offered [Name] and others. I humbly beseech that you greatly manifest your compassion and benevolence, widely bestow your vast grace, spread forth the true *qi* of the Five Phases, harmonize the generative fluids of the Two Modes, refine the departed souls, restore their nature and consciousness, lead them to the fruits of goodness, and raise them into the Vermilion Palace. Your servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon your true authority...

Your servant, overwhelmed by awe before your true majesty, prostrates himself in reverent dread. Respectfully submitted.

To the True Lord of the Southern Fire Virtue, Mars the Radiant Deluder.
To the True Lord of the Western Metal Virtue, Venus the Grand White.
To the True Lord of the Northern Water Virtue, Mercury the Dawn-Watcher.
To the True Lord of the Central Earth Virtue, Saturn the Quelling Star.

The above four petitions follow the same form as that for the Eastern Direction, with the directional enclosure and invocation adapted to each quarter.

**Petition to the Twenty-Eight Constellations**
*(Same form as the Five Planets’ petitions)*

Respectfully submitted to the Star Lord of Horn.

I humbly beseech your true compassion to deign to grant assent. May you specially dispatch your immortal retinue to descend briefly upon this fast-altar. Witness and record my prayers, attesting to my devotions. Thus may grace pervade the cosmos and blessings extend throughout heaven and earth. May you unfold your benevolence and, bending low, bestow deliverance. May all souls hastening to this altar be refined, fully partaking of the fast’s blessings to transcend and live anew. May the three paths be stilled, the nine hells unlocked, the flying and sinking alike fulfill their nature, and all that moves or grows revive.

Your servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon your true authority, is overwhelmed by awe and dread. Respectfully submitted.

The above petitions, from Horn through Wing, number twenty-eight in all, each following the same form, with the directional enclosure addressed to the respective constellation’s stellar office. The remainder follow likewise, submitted to each constellation by name—save for Dipper, whose petition is separately provided below.

Now Dipper, among the twenty-eight constellations, is Dipper and is also called Southern Dipper. The Daoist canon speaks of the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper Star Lords—this is precisely that constellation, located in the northeast. For fuller detail, one may consult the armillary sphere. Yet common folk know only the Southern Dipper, pairing it with the Northern Dipper without considering where this star truly lies—how laughable! If one cannot prepare a separate petition for each constellation, they may all be omitted, and the submission made solely to Dipper.

**Petition to the Southern Dipper**
*(Directional enclosure addressed to the Dipper Star Palace)*

Petition in the same form as above.

Respectfully submitted to the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper Star Lords.

I humbly beseech your true compassion to deign to grant assent. May you specially dispatch your immortal retinue to descend upon this fast-altar, accomplishing meritorious works and attesting to my devotions. Thus may grace pervade the cosmos and blessings extend to the manifest and the hidden.

All souls within this ritual precinct—those of the five destinies, three paths, four births, and ten thousand kinds, every sunken spirit and lingering *po*, as well as the souls of the offered [Name] and others—I dare to hope for the profound merit of nurturing all beings and the vast grace of refining souls. May all restore their long-sunken nature, may all recover their once-scattered spirit. May they be regenerated in yin and yang, reinvigorated by the creative powers, all ascending to the Vermilion Palace, all ascending to the immortal realms.

Your servant, having presumptuously trespassed upon your true authority, is overwhelmed by awe and dread. Respectfully submitted.

Respectfully submitted.

A petition from the disciple of the Mysterious Master, sealed in a square envelope, humbly presented at the gate of the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

The ordained servant of the Dharma, [Name], with utmost sincerity, lays bare his heart and ventures to address the true audience of the Perfected.

Ever mindful of his presumptuous transgressions, he trembles lest divine punishment swiftly descend. Reflecting upon himself, he acknowledges his deep entanglement in worldly defilements, where true devotion is easily obscured. His strength is meager for so weighty a task, his virtue shallow for so lofty a duty. Day and night, he is filled with dread, at a loss for what to do.

Thus, he dares to devote his heart to salvation, that he might slightly atone for his faults. For the statutes and ordinances of the Yellow Register are grave and solemn—without the nurturing guidance of a revered master, how could one so foolish and crude presume to act? Only by relying entirely on compassionate mercy may he hope to achieve success.

Regarding the petition submitted by [Name], beseeching the establishment of a grand Yellow Register retreat: having already reported this in stages, from this day forth, the altar shall be erected and the rites completed, following the prescribed sequence of the Yellow Register. It is thus necessary to record and submit this petition for your esteemed attention.

Respectfully presented to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. Humbly awaiting the master’s compassion.

May the master’s compassion extend from beginning to end, granting assent in full measure. Having prepared the petition with utmost care, we humbly present it to beseech the issuance of commands, that the authorities of the Three Realms may be duly notified and attend to the rites. We dare to implore that the cloud-borne chariot descend and briefly alight upon the retreat altar, that the memorial’s words may ascend to the Three Clarities, and the seven-day retreat be brought to perfect completion. Thus shall the hidden and the manifest rejoice as one, and the realm be suffused with grace.

We further entreat that the master issue decrees to the officials, generals, and soldiers of the registers of the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, as well as to the divine bureaus of the Three Realms and Five Marchmounts, and the military guards of the retreat, that they may be apprised of our sincere devotion. Let commands be issued and talismans distributed to summon souls and seize spirits, delivering the stagnant and benighted of the ten thousand kinds and four births, and liberating the sinful souls of the Three Paths and Nine Nights. Thus may the spirits for whom this retreat is dedicated all ascend to the realm of Primordial Emptiness.

This humble servant, in presuming to invoke the master’s authority, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial of the Three Masters**
A single memorial, identical in form to that addressed to the Master of the Mysterious Center.
The Perfected Lords of the *Lingbao* Scriptures,
The Perfected Lords of the *Lingbao* Registers,
The Perfected Lords of the *Lingbao* Salvation.

**Memorial of the Five Bureaus**
In a square envelope, respectfully presented to the First Youthful Bureau of Supreme Clarity.
From your subordinate, [Name], holding the dharma rank of [Title].

This humble servant, undeterred by the risk of punishment, ventures once more to trouble your divine mercy. Reflecting upon my own coarse and unworthy existence, I have been fortunate to live in an age graced by the Dao’s transformative influence. By the boundless grace of nurturing guidance, I have been enrolled in the service of the true bureaus, vowing to dedicate this life to the propagation of the Great Teaching. I dare to beseech your compassion and protection from beginning to end.

Recently, upon receiving the petition of [Name] requesting the establishment of a grand Yellow Register retreat, I reported this in stages as required. Now, beginning on [Date], the altar has been erected to commence the rites. In accordance with my authority, I have issued the requisite talismanic commands of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* fundamental dharma, along with the true talismans and secret scripts of the Five Elemental Bureaus, to deliver the hidden and succor the manifest, to aid the Teaching and bring peace to the age, to summon divine spirits, and to ensure the perfect completion of the retreat.

Yet this humble servant is dull-witted and shallow in learning, his virtue meager and sins profound. Without relying on the master’s grace, no communion with the divine can be hoped for. It is thus necessary to record and submit this memorial for your esteemed attention.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Most August and Illustrious Lords of the Primordial Radiance Bureaus:

The Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Auxiliary of the Primordial, Grand Law Celestial Master, Orthodox Unity’s Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord;

The Perfected Lord of True Martial Numinous Response and Protector of the Sagely, of the Yuanhe Rectification Bureau;

The Perfected Lord of Numinous Illumination and Vacant Brilliance, Guardian of the Sagely, Treasurer of Blessings, and Protector of Virtue;

The Perfected Lord Vice Marshal of the Heavenly Plan, of the Vermilion Heaven Bureau;

The Perfected Lord Marshal of the Heavenly Vanguard, Commander of the Great Primordial Forces, of the Supreme August Bureau.

With reverence, I beseech Your Perfected Compassion to look upon this humble disciple with mercy. Kindly review the matters I have previously submitted and once more petition the Celestial Court on my behalf. Issue proclamations to all bureaus, that they may respond in accordance with the dharma.

Dare I hope that Your cloud-borne chariots may descend and briefly alight upon this retreat altar, allowing this servant to proclaim the talismanic decrees and issue the requisite commands.

Furthermore, I humbly entreat that You dispatch edicts to the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, to the scriptural registers and dharma realms, to the divine youths, generals, and officials, to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to the Five Sacred Peaks and Four Great Rivers, to the hosts of martial spirits, to the overseers of the retreat, to the divine retinues of the *Lingbao*, to the Five Generals of the Monthly Watch, to the twelve hourly wardens, to the assembled forces of the Five Bureaus, and to the officials, lords, generals, and marshals of the dharma I practice—along with the spirits who seize souls and capture hun and po.

May they respond in timely fashion, descend at Your summons, and garrison the retreat altar, transmitting the talismanic decrees and proclamations. May their words resound across the Nine Provinces, their commands spread through all bureaus. May they accomplish the virtuous work and universally bless the hidden and the manifest.

Thus may the departed souls of [Name] and all others, along with the beings of the Five Paths and Four Births, the myriad kinds in the Three Wretched Realms, and all sunken souls and lingering spirits, be released from the shadowy realms. May they all come before the retreat altar, receive the grace of Heaven, ascend to the realms of goodness, and fulfill their natures—whether soaring or sinking—while all things, moving and still, revive and flourish.

This servant, having presumptuously invoked Your Perfected Might, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

The above document may be amended by those who do not practice the orthodox methods of the Five Bureaus. This petition is addressed solely to the Heavenly Master, though it may also be presented to the Northern Dipper’s Four Sage Marshal’s Court.

Petition of Master Ge the Immortal
Sealed in a square envelope, to be delivered to the gate of the Left Immortal of the Grand Ultimate.

[Your] humble servant, [Rank] [Surname] [Given Name], states:
I have long presumptuously enjoyed the protection of the Perfected and obtained a position within the ranks of the Daoist clergy. Yet my transgressions remain many, and how dare I speak with confidence? Still, in the labor of assisting and aiding, the foremost duty is to benefit and deliver. Thus, I venture to transcribe my common sentiments and reverently submit them to Your profound wisdom.

As for the matters at hand, apart from those already recorded and presented to the Heavenly Court, I must confess that my talents are base, my learning shallow, and my conduct light. I cannot penetrate the mysteries of the unseen realms, and I fear my efforts may fail to evoke a response. I can only pray for the aid of my revered teacher, that the work of deliverance may be accomplished. It is therefore necessary to submit this petition for Your consideration.

Respectfully submitted to the Venerable Left Immortal of the Grand Ultimate, the Marvelously Responsive Perfected Lord. I humbly beseech Your compassionate grace to grant this request, that I may not violate my original vows and may further invigorate the Mysterious Wind. I specially present this for Your memorial.

To the Heavenly Court, I hereby issue this edict to the officials, generals, and officers of the Registers and Methods within the Dongxuan Department; to the spirit officials of the Lingbao tradition; to the jade lads and jade maidens; and to the celestial generals and immortal soldiers. May you unite your strength and will, guard the altar precincts, transcribe the invocations, proclaim the commands, bestow the talismans, and bring to fruition the merit of this retreat. May your numinous shade spread widely, so that blessings bathe the earthly realm and grace extend to both the seen and unseen.

Deliver and uplift the departed souls of those here named, along with all beings across the nine provinces, the five paths and three destinies, the four modes of birth and ten thousand kinds—every submerged spirit and stagnant soul awaiting salvation. May they depart the dark night, receive the merit of good deeds, awaken to their true nature and root, and transcend to be transformed and reborn.

I further beseech that the cloud chariots descend to witness and record the cultivation of this retreat.

I, your servant, have presumptuously approached the awe of my teacher, trembling with fear. Respectfully submitted.

Petition of Master Xu, the Perfected.

Sealed and respectfully presented to the gate of the August and Illustrious Great Envoy.

During the Zhenghe era of the Song, he was honored with the title "Perfected Lord of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation." Having received the jade register and with Emperor Huizong addressing him as a subject, as the Grand Scribe of the Immortals of the Nine Provinces and the August and Illustrious Great Envoy—this being the celestial rank—your servant, a humble official of the ritual office, surnamed [so-and-so],

I, your servant, am but dust-born and dull-witted, long tempered by cultivation. Though I belong to the Mystery Gate, I have yet to fathom its profound depths. I can only strive to repay this extraordinary grace through my service.

I, your servant, humbly submit this matter: my learning is no greater than others’, my methods not yet perfected. Unworthily holding this leading office, how could I move Heaven? Without the grace of my teacher, the retreat’s work cannot be fulfilled. It is therefore necessary to submit this petition for Your consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Grand Scribe of the Immortals of the Nine Provinces and the August and Illustrious Great Envoy, the Perfected Lord of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation,

May Your true compassion deign to grant this petition. Thus shall my great vows be strengthened, and the subtle teachings of the Dao be widely expounded. In consideration of my unlearned foolishness, may this merit of establishing the retreat come to fruition. I dare to hope that, by the power of casting fire and streaming bells, You might condescend to descend upon the altar where the retreat is held and the Dao is practiced. May You witness and record my sincere prayers, and bear witness to this offering and devotion.

I further beseech that the words of this petition be transcribed and presented to the Heavenly Palace, and that decrees be issued to all bureaus, commanding the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, the registers of scriptures and methods, the official youths and functionaries, the divine attendants of the Numinous Treasure, the jade lads and jade maidens, the hosts of gods across the ten directions and three realms, and the legions of soldiers and spirits. May they all heed the summons and arrive in timely response, guarding the altar grounds, conveying the sincerity of the retreat, presenting the memorial and transcribed documents, and bestowing talismans and decrees. Thus may the nation be secure and the people prosperous, all things flourish, and the times be harmonious.

May the souls of the deceased, including [so-and-so], and all beings in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad forms of life in the Four Births, and every lingering spirit and stagnant soul, be delivered from the dark night. May they partake of Heaven’s grace, awaken to their past lives in clarity and peace, forever release their former transgressions, and attain liberation. May the living and the dead alike rejoice, and the hidden and manifest realms together find repose.

I, your servant, have presumptuously trespassed upon the dignity of my teacher and am filled with trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

Three copies of this petition are prepared:
One for the Celestial Bureau, enclosed in a square envelope, to be presented at the Palace of the Supreme Prime Celestial Bureau.

I, your servant, a humble official of the ritual office, surnamed [so-and-so],
am but dust-born and of impure nature, ignorant and unworthy. Unworthily occupying this immortal rank, I have been undeservedly nurtured by the true transformation. With bound body and fearful heart, how dare I speak? Yet my prayers and sincerity cannot be restrained. I humbly beseech Your indulgence and gracious understanding of my innermost devotion.

I, your servant, humbly submit this matter, and it is necessary to record and present this petition.

Respectfully submitted.

To the August Lord Emperor of the Supreme Prime Celestial Bureau.

With reverence, I beseech Your true compassion to graciously incline toward mercy and grant assent. May the immortal retinue deign to descend and alight upon the ritual altar, witnessing and recording these sincere prayers, and bearing witness to this act of devotion. Thus shall Your grace encompass the cosmos, and Your blessings extend to both the manifest and the hidden. I further humbly implore that You proclaim this petition before the Celestial Gate, and issue decrees to the Supreme Prime Celestial Realm, the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the Thirty-Six Ministries, and all relevant jurisdictions. In accordance with the ritual statutes and the commands of the talismans, may the bound souls of the deceased, [name(s)], be delivered and uplifted, along with the beings of the Five Paths and Four Births, the myriad kinds of the Three Ways, and all submerged spirits and stagnant souls. May their transgressions dissolve like mist, their entanglements be released, their passage from the dark gates be opened, and their ascent to the realms of goodness be secured. May the Hua and Xia rejoice as one, and all that moves and grows find rest.

I, Your servant, have presumptuously invoked the true majesty of the Dao and am filled with trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

One copy of this petition is prepared for the Earthly Bureau, enclosed in a square envelope, to be presented at the Palace of the Prime Earthly Bureau.

I, Your servant, a humble official of the ritual office, surnamed [so-and-so],
am of base endowment and dull nature, undeserving of the grace that has nurtured me. Though I have long borne the registers of the Dao, my merits and diligence remain unworthy. I humbly beseech Your indulgence and gracious understanding of my innermost devotion.

I, Your servant, humbly submit this matter, and it is necessary to record and present this petition.

Respectfully submitted.

To the August Lord of the Earthly Bureau of the Middle Prime.

Reverently I beseech Your true compassion to bend and grant indulgence. May the immortal retinue deign to descend and alight upon the ritual altar. Witness and record my sincere prayers, and attest to my devout offerings. Thus shall Your grace encompass the cosmos, and Your blessings extend to the hidden and the manifest. I further implore You to present this petition at the Heavenly Court, and proclaim it throughout the Middle Prime Earthly Realm, to the Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus, the Forty-Two Offices, and all subordinate domains.

[Following the same form as the petition to the Heavenly Bureau.]

To the August Lord of the Water Bureau of the Lower Prime:
A square envelope is prepared, to be presented at the Palace of the Lower Prime Water Bureau.

I, Your servant, a humble official of the ritual office, surnamed [so-and-so],
am dull-witted and unworthy, having received a post beyond my deserts. Daily I fear punishment, yet have no means to make amends. As I now present these words, it is only right that You extend deliverance. I humbly beseech Your leniency and special grant of forbearance.

I, Your servant, humbly submit this matter, and it is necessary to record and present this petition.

Respectfully submitted to the August Lord of the Water Bureau of the Lower Prime.

Reverently I beseech Your true compassion to bend and grant my request. May the immortal retinue deign to descend and alight upon the ritual altar. Witness and record my sincere prayers, and attest to my devout offerings. Thus shall Your grace encompass the cosmos, and Your blessings extend to the manifest and the hidden. I further implore You to present this petition at the Heavenly Court, and proclaim it throughout the Lower Prime Water Realm, to the Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus, the Forty-Two Offices, and all subordinate domains.

[As above.]

Petition to the Five Emperors.

Petition to the Eastern Green Emperor’s Palace.

I, [Name], a humble servant occupying a ritual office, though unworthy, have long been nurtured by the transformative power of cultivation. Yet in my appointed role, I have long lacked merit and diligence. Should reproach and punishment befall me, none would precede the salvation of others. Moreover, bearing this sincere plea, how dare I not bring it before the August Ones?

I, Your servant, humbly submit this matter, and it is necessary to record and present this petition.

Respectfully submitted to the Central Yellow Emperor, the Northern Black Emperor, the Western White Emperor, the Southern Red Emperor, and the Eastern Green Emperor.

Reverently I beseech Your sagely compassion to bend and grant my request. May the imperial carriage deign to descend and alight upon the ritual altar. Pity this unworthy student’s ignorance, and absolve the transgressions committed at the altar. Expunge my name from the ledgers of sin, and bring to fruition my good works. Thus may the cosmos be suffused with grace, and blessings extend to the manifest and the hidden.

All souls of the deceased [Name] and others here commended, as well as those in the Five Paths and Three Realms, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all submerged spirits and stagnant souls—may they all be pardoned and fully embraced by Your merciful forbearance. May they swiftly depart the dark and benighted realms, and together ascend to the pure and empty domains. May they awaken to their roots and restore their nature, gather qi and generate spirit, so that all things—moving and still, flying and crawling—may know peace and harmony.

I, Your servant, have presumptuously trespassed upon Your sacred majesty, and am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial for the Supervision of the Retreat**
Presented in a square envelope, respectfully addressed to the Gate of the Great Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure Retreat Supervision.

I, Your disciple [Name], holding the dharma rank, humbly submit. Born of lowly station and common endowment in this degenerate age, I have, by the grace of my teacher’s kindness, been entrusted with this dharma office. Though I know myself unworthy and ought to restrain my conduct, I have nonetheless received these sincere words and thus venture to offer my service. I earnestly pray for Your nurturing guidance and compassionate regard for my humble circumstances.

Recently, in accordance with ritual proceedings, it has become necessary to record this memorial and submit it for Your attention.

Respectfully presented to the Great Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure Retreat Supervision. I prostrate myself in hope that Your merciful grace may deign to grant assent. May Your immortal retinue temporarily alight at this retreat altar. Bestow the boundless grace of magnanimity, and let the blessings of Your overflowing virtue descend. Preserve this unworthy disciple, and bring to fruition my good works. Thus may the cosmos be suffused with grace, and blessings extend to the manifest and the hidden.

I further beseech You to deliver and elevate the souls of the deceased [Name] and others here commended, as well as those in the Five Paths and Three Realms, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all submerged spirits and stagnant souls. May they depart the dark and benighted realms and ascend to the immortal lands of the immortals. May the blessings of this retreat extend to all, and may both Hua and Yi know peace and harmony.

I, Your disciple, have presumptuously trespassed upon Your sacred majesty, and am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Report of the Inspector-Deity**
A sealed document is hereby presented to the court of the Inspector-Deity. The duties of the Inspector are manifold, and thus in the ritual protocols of Lin Shen’s Offering Rites, only this single position is established beside the Eight Superior Seats—akin to the role of a surveillance commissioner overseeing officials. It is, indeed, of paramount importance. The title "Inspector-Deity" is no trifling designation; it is a celestial appellation, and as such, it may not be altered. For instance, the Perfected Lord of Responding to the Primordial and Preserving the Mandate was but an honorific bestowed by the Song dynasty. Yet in recent times, worldly folk, in their offerings to the Supreme Perfected, have taken to omitting the word "Deity," addressing the office simply as "Inspector." This is a grave breach of propriety. Little do they realize that in the celestial hierarchy, there exists only the *Inspector-Deity*, never merely an *Inspector*. That the vulgar elevate the title by secular standards is a practice that ought to be rectified. Even a single character’s omission creates a profound obstruction to principle.

I, [Name], a humble servant of the ritual ranks, presumptuously risk the punishment of unforgivable transgression to address the office of the Most Perfect. I can only pray for Your compassion and deliverance, and that You deign to review this humble petition.

As the matter requires, this report is respectfully submitted for Your attention.

Respectfully submitted.

The Inspector-Deity of the Nine Heavens, Responding-to-the-Dao Protector of the True Fortune, Most Perfect Sovereign.

May Your True Compassion deign to look upon this petition with mercy and grant assent. May the celestial procession condescend to cast its gaze upon the ritual altar. Receive these earnest prayers and transmit them on high; overlook these transgressions of the statutes and grant universal pardon. Bestow the grace of completion and lend the power of uplift. Thus may the blessings of the ritual extend throughout the world, and the mysterious ford saturate both the hidden and the manifest. Deliver and ferry the souls of the deceased, [Name] and others, as well as those in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all submerged spirits and stagnant souls. May they forever depart the eternal night, transcend the layered darkness, gather their original spirits, and return to life to realize their true nature. Thus may the trials of the Nine Earths cease, the labors of the Three Ways end, and all beings—whether rooted or mobile, flying or sinking—receive equal protection and universal peace.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed against Your True Majesty and am filled with dread and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Petition to the Two Perfected Ones of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering**

Presented in a sealed document to the gate of the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering.

I, [Name], a humble servant of the ritual ranks, dare to reflect: the establishment of ritual statutes and teachings places deliverance and salvation foremost. Though I am foolish and ignorant, I venture to fulfill my duty. Moreover, in reverent prayer, it is proper to present this petition in full.

As the matter requires, this report is respectfully submitted for Your attention.

Respectfully submitted.

Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Perfected One,
Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering.

In reverent hope of Your True Compassion,
may You deign to present this petition to the Azure Palace of the Eastern Extremity.
We beseech the issuance of a Dao-decree,
universally commanding the Three Realms,
proclaiming to all bureaus and offices.
Dispatch flying celestial beings in full,
to descend the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands,
dividing their numinous power to save the suffering,
responding to prayers with benevolence.
Release those bound in the prisons of the Dark Realm,
illuminate the shadows of the Night Terrace.
Deliver and ferry the souls of the deceased, [Name] and others,
along with all beings in the Five Paths and Three Wretched Realms,
the myriad kinds of the Four Births,
and every languishing spirit.
Dissolve karmic grievances,
awaken those sunk in delusion,
restore their original spiritual nature,
and enable them to know their roots and recover their true nature.
May they swiftly ascend to the realm of ceaseless rebirth,
forever departing the land of stillness and silence.
Thus shall the blessings of this ritual extend throughout the world,
and the profound grace of the Dao pervade both the hidden and manifest.
So too may all beings endowed with consciousness and form,
who have received their substance and taken shape,
attain awakening and revival,
and wholly return to peace and joy.
We further pray that Your numinous chariot descend,
gracing the altar with Your presence,
accomplishing the virtuous merit,
and perfecting the ritual affair.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed against Your True Majesty and am filled with dread and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Nine Heavens Office of Life and Destiny, presented in its square casket,
delivered to the Palace of the Nine Heavens Office of Life and Destiny.
The humble petitioner, [Name], of such-and-such ritual rank,
relying upon Your boundless grace, presumes upon my mortal sincerity.

In accordance with the matter at hand, it is necessary to submit this memorial for Your hearing.

The undersigned respectfully petitions the True Lord of the Nine Heavens Office of Life and Destiny.
May Your true compassion, in its infinite mercy, deign to grant this plea.
May Your divine chariot, in its singular journey, briefly descend upon the jade altar.
May You cast but a glance upon this ritual offering,
and specially safeguard this foolish and unworthy one.
May no demonic obstacles arise, and may the virtuous merit be accomplished.
Thus shall blessings extend to the hidden and manifest,
and grace encompass the entire world.

All souls of the departed, including [Name] and others here invoked,
along with those in the Five Paths and Three Ways,
the myriad beings of the Four Births,
and all wandering spirits across the Nine Provinces,
shall rely upon this transformative power and receive compassionate deliverance.
May this plea ascend to the Nine Ultimates,
and may the hundred spirits descend in secret.
May a special mandate be issued,
originating from the Three Primes and perfected in purity.
In unison, they shall chant their reverent assent,
receiving the Nine Qi to shape their forms.
Thus shall yin and yang be recreated,
and consciousness and nature be restored in full.
May all ascend to the realm of transformation and rebirth,
and together transcend the land of stagnation and obscurity.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed against Your True Majesty and am filled with dread and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

A petition to the Demon Kings of the Three Realms, sealed in a square envelope, to be presented at the palace of the Demon King of the Formless Realm. The undersigned, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname, having long served among the ranks of the dharma officials under the shelter of Your numinous grace, humbly beseeches Your boundless forbearance and records this sincere entreaty.

Recently, in accordance with ritual proceedings, it has become necessary to submit this petition for Your august hearing.

With utmost reverence, this is respectfully submitted to the Great Demon Kings of the Realm of Desire, the Great Demon Kings of the Realm of Form, and the Great Demon Kings of the Formless Realm. May Your sagely compassion deign to grant this plea with merciful assent. May Your exalted banners and standards briefly descend upon the ritual altar, that the merit of good deeds may be perfected and the fast and prayers be witnessed. Furthermore, we beseech You to command and dispatch the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, jade lads and jade maidens, the Three and Five Merit Officers, the attending officials on the left and right, the Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs, the overseers of the fast, and all the divine generals and soldiers under the registers of the Dongxuan Lingbao scriptures. May they descend to the ritual altar, assist in the performance of the rites, guard the altar’s precincts, transcribe the petitions and present the memorials, bestow mandates and confer talismans, and deliver the souls of the deceased [Name] and others under ritual commendation, as well as those of the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all wandering spirits and lingering souls. May all be protected and recommended, their ranks elevated in the Southern Palace. May the spirits of the hidden realms receive this grace and thereby transcend the land of stagnation and obscurity. May the living receive Your blessings, that all may be guided toward longevity and well-being.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed against Your sagely majesty and am filled with dread and trepidation. Respectfully submitted.

A petition to the Demon Kings of the Five Thearchs, sealed in a square envelope, to be presented at the palace of the Demon King of the Azure Heaven. The format follows that of the petition to the Demon Kings of the Three Realms.

With utmost reverence, this is respectfully submitted to the Demon King of the Yellow Heaven of the Center, the Demon King of the Black Heaven of the North, the Demon King of the White Heaven of the West, the Demon King of the Red Heaven of the South, and the Demon King of the Azure Heaven of the East.

A petition from the Yellow Register Office, sealed in a square envelope, to be presented at the Lower Yuan Yellow Register Office. The undersigned, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname, having long been entrusted with the transmission of the supreme dharma despite my mediocre talents, have gratefully received Your nurturing care and been granted this office. Relying upon Your gracious indulgence, I now venture to present this plea.

Recently, in accordance with ritual proceedings, it has become necessary to submit this petition for Your august hearing.

With utmost reverence, this is respectfully submitted.

To the Sovereign High Perfected of the Lower Yuan Yellow Register Office.

Moreover, I implore You to present this petition before the Celestial Court, that by imperial decree the appropriate officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers of the Yellow Register Office may be dispatched to the ritual bureau, there to proclaim the talismanic mandate and transmit the memorial’s words.

May the souls of the deceased, [Name] and others, be delivered and uplifted, along with all those bound in the Five Paths and Three Wretched Realms, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and every suffering spirit in darkness. May they depart the shadowy realms, attend the Daoist sanctuary, awaken from their delusions, cast off karmic retribution, return to the realm of goodness, and forever bathe in the true repose.

Thus may the blessings of the ritual extend to both the hidden and the manifest, the mysterious grace pervade all that moves and grows, the ten directions know purity and peace, and the myriad beings revive in clarity.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed upon Your true majesty, and am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

Memorial from the Upper Palace of Nanchang
The undersigned, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

I, [Name], unworthy and untalented, have rashly assumed this office, my merits meager and my faults grave, with no means to redress my failings. Far from aiding the true Daoist wind, how could I even slightly repay my long-held aspirations? Yet I venture to lay bare my sincerest devotion, continuing to seek the ear of the exalted.

Recently, in accordance with ritual proceedings, aside from the rites already conducted in observance of the statutes...

On the second night of this retreat’s construction, we shall universally perform the refinement and deliverance of the Three Paths and Five Realms, for the myriad kinds of the Four Births and all responsive, deliverable souls in darkness. By the third night, we shall refine and deliver the souls of those bound for salvation—including [Name] and others—each attaining transcendence and rebirth, all beseeching transformation through deliverance. I, in my singular devotion, dare not presumptuously distinguish between the weighty and the slight. Yet as a foolish and unlearned one, I cannot deeply penetrate the numinous mechanism. Relying solely upon talismanic writ, I fear the connection may not be fully established, and thus must submit this memorial to make known these matters.

Respectfully submitted to the August Perfected of the Southern Palace, Ruler of the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture.

May the true compassion of the Perfected, in its boundless grace, deign to grant assent. May the immortal retinue be specially dispatched to cast its gaze upon this retreat altar, bringing to fruition the retreat’s cultivation and universally enacting deliverance. Furthermore, we entreat that the divine youths, officials, and subordinate spirits be commanded to disseminate qi, divide their numinous presence, and descend in accordance with the appointed time. Upon arrival at the altar, may the souls of those bound for salvation—including [Name] and others—as well as those of the Five Realms and Three Paths, the myriad kinds of the Four Births, and all sunken souls and stagnant spirits awaiting deliverance, receive particular nurturance and universal refinement. May the Two Qi be reunited in harmony, and the Five Phases be inaugurated anew. May they know their roots and recover their nature, return to their origin and revert to their primordial state, forever severing delusion and all attaining life and transformation. Thus may the Nine Wildernesses be free of sunken ghosts, and the Three Paths cease their punitive labors. May the moving and the still alike know repose, and the manifest and the hidden together rejoice.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed upon Your true majesty.

Memorial to the Three Yuan Perfected Lords

This memorial is respectfully submitted to the Most High Yuan, to the court of Perfected Lord Tang of the Upper Yuan.

[Name], holder of the dharma-rank, humbly states:

In accordance with ritual procedure, on the [day] of [month] at [hour], I shall present and prostrate myself before the memorial of [specific title]. Each item is set forth in full, transcribed with utmost sincerity, to supplicate for numinous response.

Though I have long been graced by Your spiritual favor and for many years attached to the Dharma Bureau, though I have roughly familiarized myself with the teachings and ritual protocols, I have yet to attain deep mastery of the arts of spirit-flight and audience with the Emperor. Fearing the memorial’s text may prove difficult to present, and thus the fast may fall short, I now, in my capacity as overseer, must make this prayer and petition, and therefore submit this memorial for Your hearing.

Respectfully submitted to:
Perfected Lord Zhou of the Lower Yuan, Who Stabilizes the Will,
Perfected Lord Ge of the Middle Yuan, Who Guards the Right,
Perfected Lord Tang of the Upper Yuan, Who Transforms through the Dao.

I prostrate myself in hope that Your Perfected Compassion may grant this petition. May You deign to dispatch the immortal retinue to descend upon the altar of the fast. May You command the host of memorial-presenting deities to notify the officials of the adamantine winds, sweep clear the cloud-paths, and ensure the smooth transmission of the memorial text. May my mortal spirit ascend to the imperial palace on high. Thus may the sincerity of the fast remain unobstructed, the celestial blessings widely bestowed, all beings revived in clarity, and the Six Heavens restored to tranquility.

I, [Name], have presumptuously trespassed upon Your true majesty.

**Section on Memorials, Petitions, and Edicts**

**Edict to the Divine Kings**
An edict may seem too light or hasty; it may be compared to a petition to the Three Yuan, which is also acceptable.

**The Numinous Treasure Great Rites Bureau Edict**
To the Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Eastern Direction:

In accordance with the matters at hand, this document must be transmitted.

We hereby edict and request that you examine the principles of the matter and promptly notify the officials and attendants of the Numinous Treasure, the great deities and messengers, the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, the left and right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Golden Lads who attend incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Flying Memorial Attendants, the Urgent *Qi* Merit Officers, and all the divine generals, officials, and soldiers of the Numinous Treasure Dharma.

Let them descend together and assemble at the altar of the fast. There, they shall proclaim the talismanic texts, ensure the smooth transmission of memorials, announce commands, and guard the observance of the fast.

Thus may blessings extend to both the manifest and the hidden, grace permeate both households and the state, all living beings receive protection, and all things—moving and still—attain repose. Upon completion of the rites, merits shall be reported, and rewards bestowed, all in accordance with the rites of the Supreme Perfected.

Upon receipt of this edict, act swiftly and in full compliance.

Respectfully edicted.

*If a separate edict is issued to each Divine King, then ten edicts shall be prepared, one for each of the ten directions. If only one edict is used, then according to the Dharma’s method for the day’s direct hour, petition the Divine King of the corresponding direction.*

**General Edict to the Divine Generals and Officials**
**The Numinous Treasure Great Rites Bureau Edict:**

In accordance with the matters at hand, this document must be transmitted.

We hereby edict and request the following:
The immortal officials and generals of the Numinous Treasure Registers and Dharma, who govern the myriad spirits;
The Great General of the Unified *Qi* of the Youthful Prime Bureau;
The Five Generals of the Direct Month;
The Directors of the Twelve Hours;
The immortal soldiers and officials of the Five Bureaus;
The great deities of thunder, sudden fire, and the law of command;
The Five Thunder Messengers;
The Duke of Thunder and the Mother of Lightning;
The Earl of Wind and the Master of Rain;
The Earth God and the Thunder Deities;
The officials and generals responsible for pursuing souls and seizing spirits;
And all the officials, generals, and soldiers who transmit memorials, guard the scriptures and rituals, and oversee talismans, charts, seals, and mudras—

Each is requested to examine the principles of the matter, assemble with their respective subordinate deities of proper sacrifice, and command the local earth gods within and without. All relevant divine spirits shall unite in purpose.

From the day the fast is established, sweep away stale *qi* and inauspicious influences, dispel defilement and malevolent anomalies, maintain strict order within and without, and guard the altar grounds. Ensure the sincerity of the fast is transmitted and the memorials ascend.

For all souls arriving at the altar—whether those being offered for the deceased, those in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, the newly departed, those who met violent or untimely ends, those with no kin to care for them, or those who cling to emotions and attachments—
And for all lingering spirits and obstructed souls:

We request that their nature and consciousness be illuminated, that they awaken from delusion, and that they no longer cling to their bodies or yearn for their corpses. May all enmities be resolved and grudges released.

Let them come to know that their physical forms have dissolved into the earth, while their souls belong to the void. Past illnesses and injuries no longer afflict them, for they have no body to suffer. The emotional bonds and affections of former days are now but empty memories. May they return to their one true nature, free from external disturbances.

May they transcend the unending cycle of rebirth and be transformed into immortals. Then, as the blessings of the fast expand and the merits of good deeds become manifest, may grace universally extend to all things—moving and still—and the hidden and the manifest alike be deeply permeated.

May the state be secure and the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace. When the rites conclude and the altar is dismantled, merits shall be reported, and rewards bestowed, all in accordance with the rites of the Supreme Perfected.

We earnestly request swift compliance.

Respectfully edicted.

*For the above memorials, petitions, and edicts, all transmissions to the upper realms shall be directed to the Direct Talismans and the hour’s presiding deities. The number of memorials and petitions may be adjusted as needed.*

Respectfully submitted to the Northern Yin Fengdu Palace.

**Memorial from the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites**

To the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites:

In accordance with prior matters requiring submission, it is necessary to record and present this memorial for report.

Respectfully submitted to the Great Emperor of the Northern Yin Fengdu.

We humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to deign to grant assent. May Your ritual procession briefly descend to the altar of purification, bearing witness to our sincere devotion and overseeing the rites offered. Thus may the merits of the fast be perfected, the numinous blessings universally bestowed, virtue extend to the manifest and hidden alike, and grace suffuse the cosmos. May all living beings receive protection, and may households and the state partake in felicity.

We further implore the issuance of a special decree, to be transmitted to the Northern Capital of Luo Feng, the gloom-shrouded realms of the Cavernous Yin, the Six Heavens and Ten Caves, the nether prisons and underworld offices—all relevant jurisdictions. Let them act in accordance with the ritual and respond accordingly, ensuring all comply with the talismanic command.

May the souls of the deceased, so-and-so and others, along with the beings of the Five Paths and Four Births, the myriad kinds of the Three Ways—ghosts who sweep mountains with winds, laborers who bear sand and stone, dragons that tunnel earth and draw water, and all officials repaying karmic debts—every lingering spirit and stagnant soul, have their names swiftly expunged from the ledgers of sin, their evil roots severed, their transgressions pardoned, and their grievances dissolved. May they be summoned and delivered from the depths of darkness, their delusions wholly dispelled, that they may partake in the blessings of this fast.

Should any of the summoned souls remain unexamined or unfit for immediate absolution, we further petition that officials and generals be dispatched to escort them temporarily to the altar, that the workings of karmic retribution may be made manifest.

We earnestly pray for swift compliance.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Most Exalted Minister of the Eastern Peak,

We humbly address the Most Exalted Minister and Controller of Destiny, the Perfected Lord of the Eastern Peak. May your true compassion incline toward mercy and grant assent. We beseech your transcendent presence to descend upon the altar of this fast, to witness and record our sincere devotion, and to oversee our offerings.

Further, we implore your sacred decree be issued to the courts of the Five Peaks, the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens of the world, the blessed lands and numinous retreats, the halls of governance and chambers of tranquility, as well as Mount Mao’s Hua Yang and Liang Chang grotto-heavens, the Earth-Lung blessed land, the divine courts and immortal pavilions of the middle realm, the administrative offices of the Nine Provinces and their corresponding domains, the city gods and local deities, and all places under their jurisdiction.

In accordance with the established protocols, may all be commanded to comply with this divine mandate. May the souls of the deceased, including those of such-and-such persons, the beings of the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad forms of the Four Births, the ghosts that sweep mountains with winds, the laborers who bear sand and stone, the spirits bound by karmic retribution, and all lingering spirits and stagnant souls, have their grievances expunged, their transgressions pardoned, and be delivered from the dark paths, that they may partake in the blessings of this fast. May all be dispatched and summoned forthwith.

Should any of the summoned souls remain unfit for immediate absolution, we further petition that the local authorities be instructed to dispatch officials and generals to escort them temporarily to the altar, that the workings of karmic retribution may be made manifest.

We reverently await your celestial decree for its execution, that the fruits of goodness may be perfected. May your august favor universally suffuse, the living be blessed, and all beings—moving and still—be graced with your mercy.

To the Five Peaks,

This memorial is respectfully submitted to the Imperial Palace of the Eastern Peak.

We beseech your transcendent presence to cast your gaze upon the altar of this fast, to witness and record our prayers, and to validate our offerings.

Further, we implore your special decree be issued to the subordinate courts and bureaus, the dark prisons and hidden cells, the domains of the Nine Provinces, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, the sacred mountains and great rivers, the altars of ancestral rites, the city gods and village shrines, and all places under their jurisdiction.

Memorial to the Lord of Mount Tai

This memorial is respectfully submitted to the Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak.

The Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites, as per the matter at hand, presents the following.

We humbly address the Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak. May your divine compassion incline toward witnessing and recording our plea.

This memorial further beseeches that Your Divine Chariot descend in grace to the ritual altar, that good works may be perfected and our devotions attested. May the manifest and the hidden alike receive your protection, and may both household and realm be blessed with your favor.

We humbly petition that this decree be transmitted to all jurisdictions under the governance of the Peak’s Court: the nether prisons and yin tribunals, the renowned mountains and grotto-palaces of the world, the blessed lands and numinous altars, the halls of governance and tranquil abodes, the divine courts and immortal sanctuaries, as well as the nine provinces and their corresponding domains, the city gods and earth deities, and all places under their purview. Let all these follow the prescribed forms and respond accordingly, each obeying and upholding the mandate of this talisman.

May the souls of the deceased, including those named herein, as well as all beings in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad forms of the Four Births—even the wind-swept mountain ghosts and the toilers burdened with sand and stone, those repaying karmic debts or bound by unresolved entanglements, those awaiting testimony or self-ensnared, and all lingering spirits and obstructed souls—be absolved of their transgressions, pardoned of their faults, and liberated from the dark paths. May they be deemed worthy of the offerings of this ritual, fully dispatched, and summoned to attend.

Should any of the summoned souls not yet be fit for immediate release, we beseech that official marshals be dispatched to temporarily escort them to the altar, that the workings of retribution may be made manifest. Thus may the fruits of goodness be brought to perfection, the imperial favor widely bestowed, and all living beings—both animate and inanimate—be graced with your protection. Respectfully submitted.

To the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands,
this memorial is respectfully submitted to the Registrar of Immortals and Perfected Beings governing such realms.

In accordance with established form:

Within the bounds of Heaven and Earth, there are the Ten Grotto-Heavens, the Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Twenty-Four *Zhi* revived by the Han Celestial Master upon ancient sites, the Four *Zhi* later established by his successors, and the Thirty-Six *Jing* founded by the Jin Perfected Lord Xu to suppress demonic forces—altogether one hundred seventy-eight sites. Were each to be memorialized individually, not only would the documents become cumbersome, but the number of altar stations would exceed propriety. Yet if, for instance, the Ten Grotto-Heavens were collectively addressed in a single memorial, there would be no receiving office to accept it, thus violating principle.

Therefore, only those grotto-heavens and blessed lands within the same commandery as the site of the fast shall be memorialized locally; if none exist, the matter shall be set aside. This has already been petitioned for in the memorial, requesting that the decree be issued accordingly. Further deliberation is invited.

By the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites.
As recorded by this office.
Procedures as before.

Respectfully submitted to the Registrar of Immortals of [Name] Grotto-Heaven.

We humbly beseech that this petition be reviewed and transmitted, that the divine host be specially dispatched to descend upon the altar of the fast, to accomplish the work of goodness, and to bear witness to our devotions. We further entreat that the celestial bureaus governing these sacred domains be notified to record the shades of the departed, weigh their merits and transgressions, and direct them to their rightful destinations. May all comply with the talismanic command to deliver and deliverance the souls of [Name] et al., along with the beings of the Five Paths, Four Births, Three Wretched Ways, and all lingering spirits and obstructed souls. May their names be swiftly expunged from the ledgers of sin, their evil roots eradicated, their entanglements untangled, and may they be summoned and dispatched to the altar to manifest the workings of retribution. Thus may their penal servitude in the nether realms cease, their trials at the gates of darkness conclude. May blessings extend from the manifest to the hidden, and felicity pervade the cosmos. We earnestly pray for your response and enactment.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Nine Ramparts,
this memorial is respectfully submitted to the Earth Sovereigns of the First Rampart.

The sacred stations of the Nine Ramparts follow below.
The First Rampart comprises four Earth Sovereigns; the Nine Ramparts together number thirty-six. Since each rampart shares a common jurisdiction, it is fitting that each be addressed in a single memorial.

By the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites.
As recorded by this office, procedures as before.

As recorded by this office, procedures require the issuance of this document.

We petition that you, in accordance with the principles of this matter, swiftly command the altars of worship, divine offices of the altars and boundaries, local spirits, and mountain and forest elders under your jurisdiction to act in accordance with the ritual. May all comply with the talismanic command to deliver the souls of the deceased, [Name] et al., as well as those bound in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, the newly departed, those who met with violent or peaceful ends, those with living kin yet no relatives, those deluded in truth or confused in nature, or those detained in local realms—whether bound by karmic entanglements, unresolved disputes, incomplete testimonies, or unfinished trials—along with all spectral beings, mountain and stone spirits, wandering gods, flying souls, and stagnant spirits.

Should any souls among those summoned fall under the count not yet due for original release, may they nonetheless be temporarily escorted forth to reverently attend the celestial decree. May the divine chariots swiftly advance, encircling and safeguarding the altar precincts, pacifying all quarters, and sustaining the rites in full rotation. Thus may the virtuous merit be perfected, the imperial favor universally bestowed—extending blessings throughout household and realm, and granting protection even to the hidden and obscure. May all living beings and growing things awaken to joy; may the departed ascend through timely deliverance. Upon completion of the rites, let merits be recorded in accordance with the numinous statutes. Hasten to comply and act accordingly.

*Petition of the Year-Star*
*Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Law*

Petition to the Year-Star Venerable Deity of [Year].

The Bureau, having received the submission, finds it necessary to issue this missive. We hereby petition and instruct in full detail: dispatch orders with all haste to the various offices of the Earthly Mansion and the local earth gods now overseeing the construction of the altar site. Command them to temporarily withdraw and make way. Should the site harbor lingering *qi* of the dead, concealed malevolence, or hidden defilements, let all be gathered, concealed, and expelled to prevent interference.

All earth deities under the jurisdiction of the Earthly Mansion, wherever their duties lie, if any deceased souls remain detained due to unresolved matters, must comply with the talismanic command and dispatch them forth to ascend and be delivered in due time. May the divine chariots descend to bear witness to the rites. Thus may the virtuous fruits be perfected, the imperial grace universally conferred, the hidden and manifest alike receive protection, and household and realm be blessed with favor.

Upon receipt, hasten to comply and act accordingly.

Respectfully petitioned.
*Petition to the Netherworld*
*Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Law*

Petition to the Elder of the Yellow Springs and Netherworld Barrens.

The Bureau, having received the submission, finds it necessary to issue this missive. We hereby petition and instruct in full detail: notify and command the dark realms of the Yellow Springs, the shadowed wilds of the forest barrens, and all jurisdictions responsible for the custody of the deceased and the registry of spectral souls. Thoroughly gather and summon the souls of [Name] et al. for deliverance, along with those bound in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, the newly departed, those who met with violent or peaceful ends, those lingering in ruins or roaming the wilds, the kinless and unvenerated, the unmoored and unsheltered, those entangled in disputes or bound by karmic transgressions, and all stagnant spirits and wandering souls. Let all comply with the talismanic command, swiftly expunge their records of sin, eradicate their evil roots, and dispatch them forth to reverently receive the rites of deliverance.

Should any of the summoned souls remain under incomplete investigation and thus not yet due for release, still summon officials from each jurisdiction to escort them to the altar, where their karmic retribution shall be made manifest. May the divine steeds swiftly advance to bear witness to the rites. Thus may household and realm receive favor, the hidden and manifest alike be blessed with protection.

Petition to [Deity’s Name].

The Bureau, having received the submission, finds it necessary to issue this missive. We hereby petition and instruct in full detail: from the commencement of the altar rites on [Date], you are to personally lead your officers and soldiers to the altar site and take up station. Oversee and command the local earth gods and all relevant deities to guard the altar precincts and dispel malevolent influences.

Prior to the rites, should the site harbor lingering *qi* of the dead, ensure it is concealed and prevented from manifesting. Any residual *qi* of deceased officials must be promptly removed and not allowed to linger. Within a radius of one hundred and twenty paces from the altar, all Year-Star officials, taboo deities, and baleful stars must temporarily withdraw to avoid conflict or obstruction.

Upon the conclusion of the rites and the dispersal of the altar, all deities shall return to their original positions. Thus may the rites be perfected, demonic obstacles averted, blessings extend throughout the realm, and favor bestowed upon the hidden and manifest alike. Record merits and submit a memorial in gratitude for the divine beneficence.

Hasten to comply and act accordingly.

**Memorial of the Dragon Kings**
From the Great Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure.

To the Abyssal Sage Vast-Virtue King of the Eastern Sea:

In accordance with the received intent, it is necessary to issue this directive. Upon review of the matter, You are hereby commanded to instruct the water offices under Your jurisdiction and all relevant subordinate authorities to act in accordance with the law and ensure compliance with the divine mandate. May the souls of the deceased, [name(s)], as well as those in the Five Paths and Three Ways, the myriad beings of the Four Births, and all who toil in the depths of the boundless waves or labor in the earth’s waterways—whether they drowned by their own hand, perished in capsized vessels, suffered punishment for broken oaths, or expiated accumulated sins—be released from their lingering obscurity. May their offenses be pardoned, their karmic bonds dissolved, and their entanglements severed, that they may be summoned to the altar and dispatched in due time.

Should any of the summoned souls still bear unresolved karmic testimony, and thus cannot be immediately released, we request that officials be dispatched to temporarily escort them forth, that the law of cause and effect may be made manifest. We further entreat that Your divine entourage proceed in concert to witness the rites. Thus may the merit of good works be perfected, the imperial grace universally bestowed, the realm rejoice as one, and the living and the dead alike know peace.

Upon receipt of this memorial, act swiftly and in accordance with its directives.

Duly memorialized.

The above directive is issued in identical form to the seventeen revered Dragon King Water Palace deities as previously listed.

**Talisman for the Summoning of Divine Tigers**
From the Great Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure.

In accordance with the received intent, having already memorialized the Celestial Court and issued the divine mandate, we now request the descent of the Jade Edict to all relevant authorities for the execution of this summons. Herein are recorded the names, native places, and particulars of the souls to be delivered. It is necessary to issue this directive.

To the Divine Tiger Chief Officer He Qiao, the Three Division Soul-Pursuing Envoys Hou, Wei, and Zhang, the Great Generals of Soul-Pursuit, the Officers and Generals of Soul-Seizing and Spirit-Capturing, and all subordinate officials of this Bureau charged with soul-pursuit and spirit-capture:

Upon review of the matter, You are commanded to traverse the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Grotto-Heavens of Seas and Mountains, the City Gods and Village Altars, the shadowy prisons of the nether regions, the underworld bureaus of all domains, the offices that record deeds and weigh transgressions, the halls that adjudicate sin and merit, and all authorities that govern souls and preside over yin spirits. Seize the aforementioned souls of [name(s)] and all beings in the Five Paths, Three Ways, Four Births, and every lingering, obscured spirit—whether bound in confinement, imprisoned in dark precincts, self-ensnared, long fallen, or wandering the wilds and mountains, their consciousness dimmed and their spirit yet unrecovered, still trapped in the yin realms without deliverance.

In strict accordance with the Celestial Mandate and the Jade Edict of the Primal Origin, You are to urgently seize and deliver them to the altar, that they may respond in due time. Should any of the summoned souls bear unresolved karmic testimony and thus cannot be immediately released, You are to temporarily escort them forth to reverently receive deliverance.

Upon receipt of this talisman, act swiftly and in accordance with its directives.

Duly talismanized.

Memorandum from the Seven Jade Maidens to the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites.

Memorandum to the Divine Tiger Pursuit Officers and the Seven Bureau Jade Maidens.

As this Bureau’s intent remains as previously stated, the memorandum requests that the details of the matter be thoroughly examined and that you proceed to all directions of the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the dark prisons and nether passes, and all places under your jurisdiction.

Pursue and seize the souls of the deceased, [Name(s)] and the like, as well as all beings in the Five Paths, Three Ways, and Four Births—every lingering, obscured spirit. Whether detained in the yin realms, held in opposition before the underworld courts, sunk in the ruins of desolate sites, or wandering the wilds and fields, entangled in the Five Sufferings, exiled to the Three Ways, clinging to their corpse-forms, or lost in confusion of mind—all are to strictly adhere to the Celestial Mandate and the directives of the Jade Edict now received.

Execute the root-seizure in full, so that by the night of the [day] of this month, they may all arrive at the Bureau of Rites, manifest their forms, and receive deliverance. Should any of the seized souls remain under review and their records incomplete, such that they cannot be immediately released, you are hereby instructed to coordinate with the authorities of each respective place, dispatching officers and generals to temporarily escort them forth, that the majesty of the Dao and its laws may be upheld. Await their response without delay.

Upon completion of the matter, report shall be made to record merit, in accordance with the statutes.

**Memorial of Urgent Summons**

Memorial of Urgent Summoning
Approved by the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

To the Divine Tiger Officers and Generals of the Seizing-Souls Bureau, and all attendant spirits:

In accordance with the present matter at hand, excluding those already dispatched by talismanic command and Jade Edict, as well as those transferred by official writ to seize and deliver the wandering souls of the deceased, along with the beings of the Five Paths, Four Births, Three Wretched Ways, and the ten thousand kinds—all lost spirits and lingering souls—you are to ensure their prompt arrival at the ritual altar for timely ascension and deliverance.

Now, as the appointed hour for the summons draws near, the souls to be seized must manifest beneath the ritual banner, their responses made clear and evident. It is therefore necessary to issue this renewed writ.

To the Divine Tiger Officers He and Qiao, the Seven Bureau Jade Maidens, the Envoys of the Three Divisions for Pursuing Souls, and all relevant officers and generals of this Bureau:

Upon careful consideration of the matter, you are urgently commanded to hasten the seizure of the aforementioned souls of such-and-such, as well as the beings of the Five Paths, Three Wretched Ways, Four Births, and the ten thousand kinds—all lost spirits and lingering souls.

Some may be sunk in mountains and marshes, hidden in mounds and ruins; others may drift without refuge, wandering the four wilds; some may have no fixed abode, their names unrecorded in registers; others may be scattered in mind, their souls yet ungathered; some may have died yet remain unaware, or be bound by attachment and self-entangled; some may linger within the courts of the Three Primes, or be cast beneath the ninefold darkness of the Yellow Springs; some may await resolution of their records, or remain ensnared by karmic grievances.

Throughout the Three Realms and the ten directions, wherever they may be, you are to pursue and seize them in accordance with the statutes, compelling them to appear at the altar without delay. There, they shall manifest beneath the banner, their responses made plain. You are further to instruct them, that they may awaken to their original nature, listen to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, understand their roots and recognize their fate, reverently receive the grace of the Dao, and dutifully partake of the merit of the ritual.

Should the blessings widely extend to the hidden and the dark, then the merit shall truly rest with the officers and generals. Upon completion of the matter, a memorial shall be submitted for promotion and reward as prescribed by ritual.

Upon receipt of this memorial, act immediately in accordance with its directives.

Respectfully submitted.

On such-and-such a night, with reverent preparation of the ritual feast, universal deliverance shall be performed. Excluding those already memorialized to the Celestial Court and communicated to the true bureaus of the Three Realms and their subordinate offices...

**Universal Summons to the Ten Directions and Three Realms**

A universal summons shall be issued to the ten directions and three realms, the six extremes and four quarters, within the myriad states and beyond the nine provinces; to the spirits of the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of humanity, the Dao of earthly prisons, the Dao of hungry ghosts, and the Dao of beasts; to all wandering souls and multitudes of the unseen. Whether they met their end in wealth and honor or suffered in solitude and cold; whether they perished in virtue or died in wickedness; whether they drowned themselves in rivers or hanged from ropes; whether they fell into ravines or tumbled from cliffs; whether they were left with no refuge or bound by their own attachments; whether they clung to grass and trees or concealed themselves in illusory forms; whether they harbored grievances and died in violence or endured bitterness and perished unjustly; whether they were maimed in battle or executed by state decree; whether they were struck down by blades or confined in prisons; whether they wandered far from their homelands or drifted along roads; whether they garrisoned the frontiers or journeyed as merchants; whether they took their own lives or poisoned themselves; whether they owed lives or debts; whether they broke oaths or violated vows; whether they were struck by thunder or consumed by fire and flood; whether they died in childbirth or were cursed by sorcery; whether they were ensnared by hexes or poisoned by toxins; whether they drowned in shipwrecks or were crushed by falling trees and stones; whether their spirits scattered or their souls took flight; whether they were crippled, blind, or deaf; whether they were monks, nuns, or artisans of every craft; whether they were buried in haste or left unburied; whether their bones were cast aside after cremation or abandoned without offerings; whether they were exiled to foreign lands or held captive by barbarians; whether they were mute, foolish, or wise; whether they died in old age or perished young; whether they were orphans, widows, or solitary elders; whether they were recluses, scholars, entertainers, or butchers; whether they were stubborn or fell into banditry; whether they were ancient heroes or recent warriors; whether they were clerks in government offices or soldiers in military camps; whether they were sinners in the dark prisons of hell or prisoners in the shrines of city gods; whether they lingered in the Yellow Springs or the watery depths; whether they were trapped in the nine layers of darkness or awaiting judgment in the courts of the Five Peaks; whether their karmic bonds remained unresolved or their retributions unfulfilled; whether they had already endured punishment or yet awaited sentencing; whether they were souls exiled to the three paths or spirits repaying their debts in the five sufferings; whether they were spirits of beasts, demons, or malevolent forces; whether they were specters, goblins, or unseen apparitions; whether they were birds, beasts, insects, or fish; whether they flew through the air, crawled on the earth, or swam in the waters; whether they dwelled in the wilds or hid in the mountains; whether they were born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; whether they were sentient or insentient, conscious or unconscious; whether they were trapped in cycles of suffering or bound in endless rebirth—spanning the vastness of heaven and earth, through the ages past and present, without distinction of high or low, limit or end, their kinds too numerous to name, their stories too vast to recount—all wandering souls of the night realms and unseen courts shall be gathered and brought forth to the ritual altar to receive deliverance. This decree is hereby issued.

You, Divine Tiger Generals—Left Male and Right Female—Chief Scribe He Qiao, the Two Great Marshals, the Seven Bureau Maidens of the Souls, the Envoys of the Three Departments for the Pursuit of Souls, and all relevant officers, generals, officials, and soldiers, are to examine this matter with care. Proceed with haste to the gates of the underworld, the shadowy paths, the courts of the Nine Earths, the offices of the Three Primes, the spirits of mountains and rivers, the deities of the stars and lands, the city gods and earth spirits, the shrines and temples, the Yellow Springs and the Fields of Reeds, the bureaus that govern wandering souls, the local earth gods that record the dead, and all places under heaven and earth, across the four seas and nine provinces, that fall under your jurisdiction. Command all to obey this decree, issued by jade writ and talismanic mandate, to absolve the wandering souls of the three realms and ten directions, the myriad beings of the four births, and all unseen spirits. Swiftly erase their names from the registers of sin, extinguish their evil roots, and release them from the dark realms. Bring them all to the ritual altar at the appointed time, without delay or obstruction. May the vastness of the Dao’s grace extend to them, that all spirits of the unseen may rejoice together. May the ten directions know peace, and all beings find tranquility. Upon completion of the rites, report the merits as prescribed by law. This decree is to be executed with all haste upon receipt.

**Note on the Summons**
This universal summons has been transmitted since antiquity. The *Established Rites* of the Jiang family also include it as a standard text. Its purpose is simply to gather wandering souls, without other intent. There is no need to cite distant scriptures, nor does it contain obscure or difficult passages. However, phrases such as *"whether they were formless or formless, whether they had appearance or lacked appearance"* closely resemble the terminology of Buddhist teachings. Even if such phrases have origins elsewhere, their use here is unnecessary. Moreover, in the *Established Rites*, the summons is directed to the city gods, local earth spirits, and Divine Tiger officers, instructing them to allow the wandering souls to enter. If this were the case, the souls would already be at the altar, and the officers would be preventing their entry—contradicting the very purpose of the universal summons. If the intent were merely to permit the entry of ghosts already present, such a decree would be superfluous. The details of ritual procedure must align with reason; there is no need to seek novelty. After consulting ancient texts and verifying their contents, I have rearranged the language for clarity and coherence, making it easier to read. The summons to the Divine Tiger officers and generals, in accordance with the jade writ, to universally gather the souls, remains logically sound. The rites of the Jiang family’s *Established Rites* shall be followed as their tradition dictates. For our own community’s use, we need not conflate the two. This shall suffice.

**Distribution of Spirit Money and Registers for Wandering Souls**
Issued by the Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

On such-and-such a day of this month, on behalf of such-and-such a person, an Offering of such-and-such a Ritual shall be solemnly conducted. Deliverance shall be universally extended to the five paths and three ways, the four births and myriad beings, and all wandering souls.

Those who have already bathed and paid homage to the True, partaken in offerings and received deliverance, heard the scriptures and listened to the precepts, shall all be enabled to ascend and advance.

Herein lies the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven* of the Most High, the *True Forms of Mount Fengdu*, and the *Central Chapter of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*. Separate scriptures shall be transcribed here, along with silver and spirit money, the quantities of which shall not be limited. These shall be distributed without delay, as a matter of exclusive conduct.

To the Right: The Merit-Officials of the Six Paths, and the Ritual Masters’ trusted generals and officers, shall be additionally assigned to oversee the distribution. The local earth gods and territorial deities shall guide all wandering souls to the altar. With reverence for the power of the Dao, which transforms boundlessly, the aforementioned talismans, registers, and scriptures shall be distributed at the altar, one by one, ensuring thoroughness and completeness, leaving none omitted. Each soul shall be led forth accordingly. Upon completion, all shall be dispatched to their respective true bureaus for verification, promotion, and deliverance.

Thus, the writ is issued.

**Dispatch of Memorials and Writs**
Most ritual altars employ writs addressed to the Three Realms. Beyond these, talismanic methods for invoking the true spirits, as well as writs to the Dipper Palace, the Five Bureaus, and other offices, are prepared for urgent use and implementation. These are recorded below.

**General Writ to the Merit-Officials**
The Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

In accordance with the petitioner’s intent, having already memorialized the Heavenly Court and issued writs to the Three Realms, it is now necessary to transmit this document. A writ is hereby issued to the Direct Envoys of the Three Realms, the Four Duty Merit-Officials, the Hourly Duty Deities, the Merit-Officials of the Six Paths, the Supervisors of the Ritual, the local earth gods, and all relevant deities within and beyond the ritual altar.

All are requested to take note of the present ritual’s purpose and immediately open the gates of the celestial palaces, universally notifying the numinous bureaus of the Three Realms. May the myriad sages witness and observe, the hundred spirits receive their duties, the memorials be transcribed and presented, the talismans be disseminated, and the writs be transmitted and proclaimed. From the utmost heights of the Great Void to the unfathomable depths of the abyss, wherever directed, no distance shall be too far. Responding to the call, the spirits shall attend to their tasks, ensuring the ritual’s completion and the deliverance of the hidden. May blessings extend without limit, and grace pervade all sentient beings. Upon the dispersal of the assembly and the closing of the altar, merits shall be recorded, promotions granted, and memorials submitted to the Heavenly Gate, all in accordance with the rites of the Great Perfected.

Thus, the writ is issued.

**Writ for Memorializing the Upper Realm**
The Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

This Bureau, having reverently received the ritual registers and talismanic seals, serves under the Numinous Treasure and holds office in the Southern Bureau, administering the governance of the Youthful Beginning. We adhere to the ritual canons and are authorized to issue writs. Given the urgency of the present entreaty, we must rely on the transmission and memorialization of the relevant bureau.

Herein lies a memorial, to be presented to the Heavenly Court, requiring exclusive issuance and dispatch. One memorial, in a square envelope, fully sealed, is to be delivered to [such-and-such] Palace, as itemized below.

To the Right: On such-and-such a day at such-and-such an hour, the Duty Merit-Officials and two Envoys shall be requested to mount the clouds and ride the lightning, traversing ten thousand leagues in an instant and ascending the nine heavens in a breath. The memorial shall swiftly reach the heavens, and sincerity shall directly attain its destination. Should any demonic forces intercept or malevolent qi intrude, they shall be seized and delivered to the true bureaus, bound and sent to the Heavenly Prison. In accordance with the intent of the Great Dao’s established canons and to extend the Celestial Emperor’s benevolence toward life, the dispatch shall be swift, and the response immediate.

Thus, the writ is issued.

**Writ for the Middle Realm**
The Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

This Bureau holds office in the Southern Bureau of the Three Heavens and is registered in the Five Primordial Bureaus. It is our duty to suppress deceitful and false entities and our obligation to deliver and illuminate the hidden. Matters requiring notification must be processed through the relevant bureaus.

Herein lies a document to be presented to the true bureaus of the Middle Realm, requiring issuance and dispatch. One petition, in a square envelope, fully sealed, is to be delivered to [such-and-such] office.

To the Right: The Merit-Officials and Envoys of the Middle Realm are requested to ride the whirlwind and hasten forth, moving swiftly and silently to all true bureaus, universally notifying the Middle Realm. May the documents swiftly reach their destinations, and the responses be promptly manifested. Should any wayward demons or improper spirits intercept, they shall be seized and delivered to the nearest mountains and rivers, bound and sent to the local City Gods for investigation of their crimes, in accordance with heavenly justice. Awaiting swift execution, let there be no delay.

Thus, the writ is issued.

**Writ for the Lower Realm**
This Bureau, having reverently received the numinous writs and been entrusted with the Great Rites, universally benefits beings and governs the hidden. Having assumed our office, we must adhere to the ritual protocols. Given the urgency of the present notification, it must be transmitted through the relevant bureau.

Herein lies a document to be presented to the true bureaus of the Lower Realm, requiring issuance and dispatch. One petition, in a square envelope, fully sealed, is to be delivered to [such-and-such] office.

To the Right: The Merit-Officials and Envoys of the Lower Realm are requested to silently traverse the impenetrable, descend to the Yellow Springs, reach the hidden palaces of the earthly realm, and enter the yin governance of the underworld. Wherever they arrive, they shall communicate accordingly. Swiftly manifest your numinous power, and promptly clarify the response. Let there be no delay; proceed immediately as commanded.

Thus, the writ is issued.

**Writ to the Direct Envoys of the Three Realms**
The Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure.

This Bureau holds the office of enforcing the law in the Three Heavens and ranks among the record-keepers of the Five Bureaus. The established protocols are in place, and writs must be universally transmitted across the Three Realms. The ritual canons are illustrious, and memorials must reach the Nine Heavens.

Herein lies an urgent petition, requiring comprehensive issuance and dispatch, as itemized below.

To the Right: The Transmission and Memorialization Merit-Officials of the Three Realms, along with the assigned officers, generals, and soldiers, are requested to dispatch their divine mounts and hasten to the true bureaus. Above, reach the Three Realms and Nine Heavens; below, penetrate the Ten Heavens and Six Caverns; universally extend beyond the Eight Extremities and within the Four Directions; and notify the bureaus of the grotto-heavens, mountains, and rivers, as well as the abodes of gods and temples. Swiftly transmit the documents and urgently convey the entreaties. Act with haste, manifesting numinous power in the human world.

Herein is made manifest the revelation of karmic retribution, with merits rewarded in the Celestial Court. Proceed forthwith upon the cloud-path, and let there be no delay.

Respectfully,

**Ten Directions’ Boundless Worlds**

**Longevity Talisman**
Primordial Mandate Talisman, universally proclaimed to the Three Realms,
Boundless Spirit Lands, Springs’ Curved Bureaus,
Northern Capital of Fengdu,
Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, Twelve River Sources—
May the ancestors and billions of kalpas’ kindred be delivered above.

May illnesses be eradicated, sins expunged from the ledgers,
Evil roots diminished and severed.
Above, Heaven delivers humanity;
Solemnly, the Northern Fengdu is commanded.
Today, joyously passing through the gates,
We petition Heaven to petition for annihilation,
Receiving deliverance from the Three Evil Realms,
Cutting off the roots of earthly existence.
Swiftly ascending through the Five Primes,
The Dark Lords of the Mysterious oversee the gates,
Names inscribed without hindrance at Heaven’s Gate.
Souls cross into the Vermilion Mound,
Refined and reborn through purification.
Universally delivered without end,
Ascending to truth, lives transformed.
Forms refined, essences cleansed,
Names inscribed on the Purple Register,
Receiving rebirth according to rank,
Returning to the Hall of Blessings.
The Heavenly Worthy proclaims the mandate—
Dare one not reverently heed?
Hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and decrees!

**Proclamation Text**
The Primordial Mandate Talisman,
Golden Register, White Writ,
Longevity Spirit Talisman,
is proclaimed below to the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South,
the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau,
the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace,
the Lord of Longevity,
Han Jun Sima,
the Controllers of Destiny and Records,
the Venerable Deities of Lifespan Extension and Calamity Deliverance,
the Great Deities overseeing resurrection and life-monitoring,
to transcend and deliver the soul of the departed, [Name],
ascending to the Vermilion Palace’s Flowing Fire Court,
where jade eyes refine the essence,
yellow blossoms purify the form,
names inscribed on the Purple Register,
receiving transformation and rebirth.
By the merit of this Golden Register’s life-delivering power,
may promotion proceed moment by moment,
as decreed in this mandate.

At the auspicious hour of the year, month, and day,
proclaimed before the Three Treasures.

**Longevity Talisman Format (Leaked Version)**
Golden Register, White Writ, Longevity Spirit Talisman proclaimed below.

Respectfully,
[Your Name], [Your Title],臣姓某, seals the proclamation to the
**True Position of the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South**

**Jiaolong Courier Talisman**
As recorded in the celestial registers:
The Jiaolong Courier Historians hasten to deliver commands,
requiring no written pass—only the talisman’s transmission.
For those who travel now,
if they have yet to commune with the Mysterious Void,
they may append a Petition Gate Talisman at the end,
that the mandate may reach the Mysterious Bureau.
Alternatively, bind a new Jiaolong to a courier,
placing the talisman within the straw figure’s body,
letting it bear the writ.
A separate memorial must also be submitted,
notifying the Fengdu of the fast.
One must not fail to invoke the Supreme Perfected,
nor summon the courier historians,
and recklessly proclaim this talisman of one’s own accord—
just as an imperial amnesty in the mortal realm
is not for ministers to presume.
Thus, only after a grand offering to Heaven and Earth
may it be proclaimed and enacted.

The Mysterious Capital’s Jiaolong Couriers,
one hundred twenty thousand in number,
transmit commands to the Spring Palaces,
illuminating the dark bureaus.
When proclaiming the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering,
one must invoke the Primordial Venerable Jade Emperor
and summon one of these couriers.
When inscribing the talisman,
form the Jade Emperor’s mudra,
drawing the light of the Northern Culmen Star.
Write in black ink on yellow paper,
and the courier’s talisman will descend accordingly.
The paper should be made from locust wood,
inscribed in black,
for the courier’s arrival.
The Northern Culmen Star’s light
does not refer to the sixth star of the Northern Dipper, Wuqu,
but to the right Northern Culmen of the Celestial August,
the Celestial Pivot.
The True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering
must not be proclaimed without a grand offering to Heaven and Earth.
If one submits a petition,
one should chant the Mysterious Text,
scatter lamps,
and recite:
*May the returning light of the nine earths
illuminate and shatter the eight darknesses,
that the souls thus commended
may also attain ascent and deliverance.*

First, place a lamp before the Heavenly Worthy,
bow and kneel,
burn incense,
and pray for the descent of dawn’s light to suffuse the candles.
For nine nights,
hold torches to divide the lamps,
making their radiance scatter like a wheel.
Construct a wheel the size of a chariot,
with three tiers,
stacked thrice,
lighting forty-nine lamps.
Invoke the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Cavernous Spirit Realms,
opening the karmic gates of the five fetters for all beings.
By this returning light,
may the five fetters be dissolved.

**Golden Dragon Courier Talisman**
In the world, there are those who relieve the destitute,
deliver gods and humans,
uphold the precepts and perform fasts,
venerate the Three Treasures;
or refine truth and nurture spirit,
yet whose merit remains insufficient,
whose lives end in extinction,
who wander through the Great Yin—
for these, beyond the winding proclamation of the amnesty’s True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering,
a Cypress Wood Writ of Longevity Spirit Talisman
is separately proclaimed to the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South,
to be elevated in the Emperor’s Hall,
refined in the Spirit Fire Bureau.
If the sinful souls have no merit before gods and humans,
they must not presumptuously receive the Register of Ascending to Truth.
To merely behold the divine radiance
and be reborn in the yang realm
is already fortunate.
Thus, at the outset of the grand offering,
the Longevity Spirit Talisman is not proclaimed.
Its writ’s dimensions match those of the Salvation Talisman.

The Mysterious Capital’s Golden Dragon Couriers,
two hundred fifty thousand in number,
bear the talismanic commands,
open the demonic paths,
and hasten the transmission of decrees.
When proclaiming the Longevity Spirit Talisman,
one must summon one courier in advance.
Inscribe in cinnabar on green paper,
form the Jade Emperor’s mudra,
draw the rays of the Supreme August Star,
and sweep the brush over the writ.
Upon completion,
burn it with the talismanic command in green smoke.
The Supreme August Star,
when gazing south from the Northern Dipper,
lies between the Central and Lower Terraces,
slightly to the north.
North of the Supreme August Star are four stars,
arrayed like a military well;
south of it lies the Lesser August,
which is to the north.
The Lesser August resides in the Neck Mansion,
its stars yellow and bright,
due south of the Celestial Slope and Celestial Pivot.
Draw its rays with the nose,
and sweep the brush over the writ.
The rays of qi differ in kind,
with clear and turbid destinies.
When drawing the qi of the Three Lights and Five Stars,
inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
For the qi of flourishing clouds and smoke,
inhale through the mouth and exhale accordingly.
During inhalation,
let no sound reach the ears—
if heard, the rays of qi will not descend.
Nor should one inhale too deeply,
lest the breath lose its rhythm.
The key lies in concentrating the mind,
uniting intention with spirit,
in the boundless void,
so that inhalation follows thought,
and the descent of resonance is natural.
Those who ingest and guide luminous radiance,
practicing the Way of exhalation and inhalation,
are not bound by these limits.

For the talisman on the right,
face due east,
and envision within the Golden Tower Jade Palace at the Eastern Culmen’s center,
the Primordial One, Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering,
clad in nine-colored cloud-feathered robes,
seated upon a nine-headed lion’s jade lotus throne,
holding in the left hand a jade vase of sweet dew,
in the right a malachite branch,
accompanied by the Two Perfected Ones of Great Wisdom and Salvation,
the Youth of the Azure Mystery,
and eighty-one spirit officials.
From the crown emerges a white hair-mark,
its light like a sword,
within the red sun’s halo,
each detail distinct.

Silently recite the petition, then follow with the left and right hands to form the Three Paths and Five Peaks mudra. Inhale the luminous wisdom-light and swallow it, then intone the sacred name forty-nine times. Again, blow upon the brush and inscribe—no need for excess. Once more, visualize, draw in qi, and blow upon the talisman to transform it. Thus, the myriad lost souls of the Nine Provinces shall all attain immortal rebirth.

Should you deliver but one or two departed spirits, this talisman alone suffices, its numinous efficacy boundless.

**Nine Dragons Talisman Petition**

This talisman is to be crafted from cypress wood, nine *cun* and nine *fen* in length, three *cun* in width, and five *fen* in thickness.

**Precious Register of the Most High’s Edict for Absolution and Ascension to Heaven**

The *Supreme Mysterious Origin Most High Precious Register for Ascension to Heaven*.

Having examined the petition submitted by [Name] of [native place], on behalf of the deceased [Name], born on the [year, month, day, and hour] of their original destiny and deceased on the [year, month, day, and hour], and in observance of the present solemn rite for their deliverance:

Whereas the petition has already been recorded and presented to the Heavenly Court, and the command for its execution has been granted, it is now necessary to issue the talismanic register as follows.

**Inscribe the form of the Precious Register Talisman**
The Divine One Who Delivers People from Death
The Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen

**Marshal of the World-Deliverance Office, the Great Divine Controller**
**The Lord Han, Master of Life-Preservation, and the Venerable Elder**

To the right, by virtue of the *Supreme Most High’s Edict for Absolution and Ascension to Heaven*, this register is proclaimed to the Three Realms, the Celestial Bureaus and Earthly Prisons, the mountains and rivers, the peaks and valleys, the Springs of the Underworld and the Gates of Darkness, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Six Caves and Ten Palaces, the Three Officials and Nine Ministries, the One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Lands of Desolation, the Realms of Gloom, all the great earthly hells, the Nine Provinces and their domains, the blessed lands and sacred mountains, the city gods and local deities, the places under the jurisdiction of spirit-controllers, and the precincts of the immortal courts—wherever the tallying of sins and blessings, the scrutiny of merits and transgressions, is conducted—let all wardens of celestial prisons and earthly hells receive this talismanic decree.

For the departed soul burdened by karmic debts from past lives and all manner of evil roots and manifold sins committed in this present existence, by the boundless compassion of the Most High, let the ledgers of transgression be swiftly expunged, and the roots of wickedness obliterated. No longer shall they be detained; let them forthwith depart the underworld, forever severed from the shades of darkness, and all attain the wondrous fruit.

Like those who bear sand and carry stones, or ceaselessly draw from the boundless sea; like those who command thunder and harness lightning, who sweep mountains and bore through earth, or channel waters across the heavens—let all such laborers of the underworld be released from their toil, forever granted ease and freedom.

Henceforth, let the departed soul, from this moment onward:
- By the Seven Qi, attain perfection of the true;
- By the Six Rites, restore the body’s harmony;
- By the Five Spirits, mend what was severed;
- By the Two Luminaries, sustain what has waned.
Let them ascend the cosmic web, tread the void, and stride through the palaces of the immortals. Though their embryonic origin had a beginning, their dust-bound kalpas shall know no end. Let their essence be refined in the Golden City, their spirit congealed in the Jade Grotto; let the true qi nurture them within, that they may become perfected beings. Above, they shall ascend to the Jade Void; below, they shall traverse the Dark Springs. In the cloud-palaces and jeweled towers, their true soul shall dwell, moving freely through the lands of blessing, circling the gates of life. Let them chew the numinous fungus, rinse with golden springs, drink the flowing sweet dew, and bathe their cinnabar fields in the dark effulgence. Let the purple auroras dawn upon them, the Three Qi condense into mist, and their jade chambers transform them into immortals. Seated upon golden lotuses, their true countenance shall outshine the sun, and dust-bound kalpas shall become their years—all in accordance with this edict.

Proclaimed on the [year, month, day, and hour].

For grand rites, the six officiating ranks may be listed here.
Executed by the High Merit Officer, Minister [Name], in solemn proclamation.

To the right, first face the Heavenly Gate and submit a secret memorial.
Upon completion, take the ink brush and inscribe the absolution edict.
Then, facing the Heavenly Gate, recite the secret incantation:
*"The Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, instructs this minister to enact the talisman, illuminating and shattering all hells. (Or: the dark hells.) Let the dead souls depart and be freed—hasten, hasten, in accordance with the Most High’s statutes and commands for deliverance!"*
Recite the incantation seven times, then in vermilion ink trace the form of the Southern Dipper, writing the true name beneath it. Envision a jade youth descending from the Heavenly Gate, riding golden light and bearing a yellow memorial. Inhale the qi and write the four characters, reciting each one four times—four repetitions in total—then combine the forms and apply as prescribed.

The talismanic register and script are to be inscribed in black on yellow silk, with both inner and outer seals made of yellow paper. Twenty copies may be issued: ten to proclaim to the ten directions of the cosmos, nine to the Nine Provinces, and one dedicated to delivering the departed souls whose names are listed.

Once read, burn in a blazing fire. Thus shall ten thousand sins be absolved, a thousand transgressions dissolved; the soul shall refine itself within and swiftly ascend to the immortal realms.

**Inner Seal Formula:**
*Same as the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Most High’s Edict for Absolution and Ascension to Heaven.
Proclaimed by Minister [Name], in solemn execution.
**To the Wardens of the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, the Rulers of Celestial Prisons and Earthly Hells:**
Minister [Name], with reverence, seals this twice.

It is said that talismanic decrees for delivering souls from darkness rely upon the written talismans, derived from the ritual canons. When conducting rites before the altar, one petitions the celestial vault and issues proclamations to the nine earths—this is the ancient method. Yet in recent times, ignorant and deceitful practitioners have misled the common folk. Regardless of the gravity or nature of the case, they claim all talismans descend from heaven. Even the seals they use often mimic those of the Three Heavens and the Most High Dao Lord. Little do they realize that cinnabar and yellow paper are crafted by mortal hands—how crude their schemes, to falsely assert heavenly descent!

The *Register for Ascension to Heaven* holds the same significance as the ancestral altars of the world. Its talismans, incantations, and ritual protocols originate from the Most High. Only after performing the rites of purification, alliance, and memorial may one proceed accordingly. Thus, at the end of the register, the High Merit Officer’s rank is listed to signify that the proclamation is made to heaven before execution. Some, however, alter this to "by imperial decree, respectfully executed," which strays far from the original intent.

Even more egregious are those who openly declare crimes such as regicide or patricide, or the unfilial murder of parents—how can such deeds be absolved? As human beings, one must discern right from wrong. To kill one’s father or sovereign, and then dare to inscribe such acts in words, seeking absolution—how could heaven and earth, gods and spirits, tolerate it? Though some ritual canons may occasionally mention such crimes, modern practitioners should not explicitly record them in their proclamations. Moreover, the myriad sins of the world cannot be exhaustively listed. It suffices to broadly refer to "all manner of evil and manifold sins," allowing the talismanic text to remit them. Thus, even without detailing every transgression, the soul may still ascend. If the talisman itself is ineffectual, then no amount of exhaustive cataloging of sins will render it valid—such verbose records would be mere empty words.

After the date, some falsely fabricate celestial titles to mimic imperial amnesties, which is already a violation of proper protocol. How much more absurd to presume to rank the celestial bureaucracy like an earthly court, arranging the true immortals in a hierarchy to deceive others for profit! Such practitioners risk not only failing to gain advantage but also incurring divine retribution, losing their lives in the process.

Recently, some have even plagiarized imperial amnesty decrees as their own proclamations, including phrases such as "whether the crimes are discovered or not"—a transgression so grave it defies absolution. Let scholars reflect deeply upon this with a clear conscience.

In all matters, one should favor sincerity and uphold righteousness, adhering to simple and practicable standards. This is not merely for personal benefit, to avoid worldly calamity, but also to enable one’s nine generations of ancestors to escape punishment in the underworld.

Moreover, this practice does not mislead others, thereby accruing boundless merit and retribution.

For the four talismans above: when delivering and salvaging the departed souls, inscribe only one talisman, using a simplified document as per the *Rescue and Deliverance Document* format. If conducting a grand ritual, proclaim all talismans universally, inscribing them in cinnabar on yellow paper, sealed in a square case, and used as prescribed.

Yunzhong has examined the *Primordial Decree Talisman*, *Talisman for Passing Through the Myriad Heavens*, and *Talisman for Commanding Earthly Deities*—all four talismans originate from the *Scripture of Salvation for the Numinous Treasure* and have existed since antiquity. As the scripture establishes the dharma, the talismans do not deviate from it. The doctrine holds that disciples of the Numinous Treasure, upon receiving transmission, may ascend their nine generations of ancestors and deliver themselves; thus, the transmission ritual grants these talismans. Other applications, such as delivering and uplifting the departed, use the scripture’s words as the proclamation, never straying from its original intent. Among the forty-nine grades of Tiantai, this dharma text is not practiced, yet its adherents employ it when the occasion arises. Some add matters like *Jade Purity* to the original text, or label a single talisman as the *Numinous Treasure Decree* or *Numinous Treasure Talismanic Decree*. Most do not grasp the meaning of these terms—do they seek to alter the names to deceive the common folk, or do they misuse them without regard for their origin? In either case, fabricating new names is impermissible.

**The Four Quadrants Joint Talisman in the Register of Ascending Mystery**
This talisman is also called the *Golden Text and Jade Contract*. One portion is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk and burned to the celestial gatekeepers. Another portion is inscribed in cinnabar on white jade and cast into the sacred mountains, blessed lands, grotto-heavens, and cave paradises. A third portion is inscribed in cinnabar on green silk and given to the departed spirit to hold. The fourth portion is carved on the back of a golden fish and released into flowing water. All portions bear the intent of the ritual.

The northern quadrant serves as the witness between heaven and the human realm, certifying the merit of the ritual to elevate the departed spirit. Yunzhong respectfully notes: the ancient ritual system divides the *Four Quadrants Joint Talisman* into four parts, validating the merit across the Three Realms and bestowing it upon the departed spirit. This fulfills the merit of the ritual, liberating the spirit from the dark realms, enabling it to roam freely wherever goodness prevails. The doctrine is profound, and the format is ancient.

In recent times, the transmitted *Four Quadrants Joint Talisman* has been altered: one corner is labeled the *Numinous Treasure Talismanic Decree*, using the *Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms* as its text; another corner is called the *Primordial Decree*, using the *Ascension at the Appointed Hour* as its text; a third corner is named the *Jade Purity Precious Register*, using the *Passing Through the Myriad Heavens* as its text; and the fish portion is termed the *Numinous Treasure Imperial Decree*, using the *Command of Earthly Deities* as its text. During the refinement and deliverance ritual, these are burned in the fire pool. Yet during refinement, the living and the dead stand before the altar to undergo the ritual—not to summon or deliver the departed. With both water and fire present on the altar, why burn the four pieces of the joint talisman? What then becomes of the meaning of "joint"? The source of this deception remains unchecked.

On Mount Tiantai, there are even those who rationalize, claiming the delivered spirit has already ascended to heaven and need not be jointly certified in the main realm. Such trickery may deceive the common folk. Since ancient times, the *Yellow Register* has been buried to report the ritual to the Three Realms, ensuring the merit of the ritual extends everywhere. Moreover, a sinful spirit, once delivered and refined to dispel its dark obstructions, may escape the depths of the Yellow Springs. To be reborn according to its karmic grade is already great fortune—how can it be made to ascend directly to the Nine Heavens? The *Four Quadrants Joint Talisman* grants one portion to the departed spirit, yet even a high priest must reflect: if his own merit and conduct are insufficient to penetrate the netherworld, even if the highest immortals take pity and approve his petition, how can he ascertain the destination of the departed spirit? Thus, the four quadrants of the talisman are dispatched to the Three Realms, guiding the departed spirit to its destined path, allowing it to be reborn according to its grade and avoid remaining a sinful spirit. This is the true intent. How can one claim the spirit has ascended to heaven and no longer requires division among the Three Realms? If so, there would be no need to burn it at the refinement site. The essence of this practice is rooted in deception, and its implementation is fraudulent—no wonder it is so.

**Great Contract for Ascending to Heaven**
This contract is made of yellow silk, sixteen inches square, folded in half and sealed. The front bears the *Cavern Chapters of the Three Realms*, and the back bears the proclamation text, rolled and bound with yellow silk. When bestowed upon the departed spirit to wear, its essence, qi, soul, spirit, and consciousness shall fully depart the earthly courts, undergoing transformation and rebirth as a celestial or human being.

Each heaven is described in two lines; eight heavens comprise sixteen lines in total. One quadrant contains eight heavens, written in four lines. The four quadrants together form thirty-two heavens, written in sixteen lines.

The left contract uses even numbers; the right contract uses odd numbers, following the above format. At the end is written the proclamation text:

The realm of the formless, where the Heavenly Emperors and Jade Perfected Ones reside.

**The Secret Names of the Emperors of Austere Conduct, the Heavenly Titles of the Three Realms—**
their hidden sounds, their hidden rhymes, the emptiness within the heavens.
The spontaneous numinous scriptures, the honored ones within the heavens.
The great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens.
Nine harmonies and ten unions transform into Supreme Clarity.
The mysteries of the boundless are profound and beyond full comprehension.
The divine perfected scatter forth, universally delivering heaven-dwellers and humans.
The departed spirit [Name] receives this merit, ascending to the realm of the Dao,
all in accordance with the proclaimed decree, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

[Year] [Month] [Day] [Hour] the proclamation is issued.
Executed by the duly ordained official [Name], who reverently carries it out.

The reverse bears the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, not transcribed here.

Both left and right contracts are inscribed in blue-green silk and cinnabar.
They are horizontally divided at the center:
one half is sealed in a cypress-wood casket and entrusted to the celestial gate officers;
one half is given to the male spirit, one half to the female spirit.
The recipient’s forehead is sealed as before, and the contract is presented to the celestial gate for verification.

Without this contract, the earthly bureaus and local administrations will not allow the spirit to depart whole;
the Five Marchmounts will not grant passage by name;
the fire officials will not bestow the full radiance of numinous light;
the celestial gate will bar entry.

With this contract, one may proceed directly into the celestial gate and ascend to the Hall of Blessings.

**Outer Envelope / Inner Envelope**
*Right Contract for Ascending to Heaven*
Executed by the duly ordained official [Name], who reverently seals it.

*Proclamation of the [Left/Right] Contract for Ascending to Heaven for [Name]*
Executed by the duly ordained official [Name], who reverently double-seals it.

**Celestial Gate Guardians and Host of Divine Sentinels**
Having carefully examined the *Left and Right Contracts of the Numinous Treasure for Ascending to Heaven*—inscribed in blue-green silk and cinnabar, horizontally divided at the center—
one half is formally sealed and entrusted to the celestial gate officers;
one half is given to the recipient, the departed spirit.

Once the spirit obtains this contract,
the Three Realms will no longer detain it,
and it may avoid stagnation.
This is not merely for ascending into the celestial gate:
even if its merit and conduct are incomplete,
when it pays homage to the Supreme Emperor,
it may dwell in the middle realms,
serving as a treasure for the body,
delivering and transforming for rebirth.

Those who propagate the teachings should employ this with care.

In the human realm and in heaven, let it be revered and practiced, all in accordance with the mysterious statutes and ordinances.

*Supervised by:* [Name and rank of the Monitoring Master] (seal).

Yunzhong notes: The origin of the Dao is formless and wordless, thus nameless and invisible. Yet when the subtleties of the Inaudible and Invisible are dissected and the embryo of primordial chaos is cleaved, then the brilliance of yin and yang emerges, the separation of purity and turbidity begins, the numinous and void conceive refinement, and the empty and cavernous give birth to the divine. Some coalesce qi into patterns; some weave the mysterious into images. Thus, the Five Canons unfold, the Three Caverns propagate—all arising naturally, in accordance with the times, descending into the world. In the grand scheme, they preserve and regulate the kalpas, assisting the primordial net. In the lesser, they mold and transform the common people, reviving the hidden and the manifest. All emanate from the primordial ancestor of the myriad Dao, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning. In due time, he expounds the teachings, establishing the Three Vehicles to receive beings and issuing the Nine Grades to deliver humanity.

The scriptures of the Three Caverns descend as registers, and from the registers, the dharma manifests. The practice of the Dao and its methods begins with talismans—this is their inherent principle. For talismanic texts arose at the inception of heaven and earth, containing the wonders of the natural. Applied to the world of mortals, they assist the upright and expel the perverse, dispelling calamities and rescuing from distress. Applied to the nether realms, they liberate the nine generations of ancestors and deliver the sunken souls. After the Middle Antiquity, retreat rituals flourished, and the lineage of the Cavernous Mystery spread its numinous influence. Thus, in cultivation and purification, in the establishment of jiao offerings, prayers ascend to the lofty heavens, commands are issued, and talismans are bestowed—illuminating the darkest nights, ever placing talismans first.

Talismans are the wondrous qi of the primordial heaven, the numinous texts of the natural. When proclaimed and enacted, the gates of the unseen open, and nothing remains unaverted. Yet how could this depend on the multitude of talismanic scripts or the diversity of their names before resonance is achieved? In recent times, those who uphold the dharma and enact the statutes often fail to deeply investigate this principle. Their views differ, their intentions stray from rectitude, and in conducting rituals before the altar, they seek to surpass others.

The original dharma of the Numinous Treasure belongs to the Cavernous Mystery Department. Among its talismans for ascension and salvation—such as the Talisman of Long Life, the True Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering, the Talisman for Shattering Hell and Delivering Sunken Souls, the Primordial Talisman Command, the Nine Dragons Talisman Command, the Talisman for Ascending to Perfection and Salvation of Destiny, the Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms Talisman, the Talismans for Traversing the Passes of the Myriad Heavens, the Decree for Controlling the Earth’s Offices, the Four Quadrants Unified Talisman, and the Three Certificates for Ascension—these alone comprise the ancient talismanic commands. When invoking talismanic commands, one fears only that the Most High Emperor may not grant permission for their enactment. If even one talisman proves efficacious, then the soul being delivered cannot fail to be saved—how could the value lie in the multitude of talismans?

In compiling this edition of the Numinous Treasure talismanic commands, I dare not intermingle other talismans nor add extraneous dharma talismans. I employ only the talismanic commands of the Cavernous Mystery’s original statutes, all drawn from the orthodox dharma of the Numinous Treasure, to preserve the integrity of the teachings. Scholars should examine and discern this carefully.

**Chapter on the Reception of the Staff**
For crafting a staff, one must select a propitious site in a renowned mountain or blessed land, a pure domain or numinous precinct. On an auspicious day, obtain a single bamboo stalk from the south, five feet and five inches in length, with nine nodes. Place it in a purified location. Choose an *jiǎ-wǔ*, *bǐng-wǔ*, or *dīng-mǎo* day, or the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, or the ninth day of the ninth month.

At the first node, make a slight bend to the left, then a slight bend to the right. On the lower part of the third node, open four apertures on all sides and insert the inner names of the Four Sacred Mountains.

At the central node atop the staff, open an aperture and place the inner name of the Central Sacred Mountain within, then fill it with the middle section of the Numinous Writ. Seal each with wax to secure. For those who intend to carry and employ the staff in dedicated practice, insert the Five Thearch Talismans into the staff, and fashion a pouch from yellow-patterned silk, its length and breadth just sufficient to hold the staff.

When performing rituals, suspend a small yellow pennant from the lower part of the second node, seven inches in length. Inscribe upon the pennant the titles of the Ten Directions’ Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthies, along with the Ten Directions’ Mysterious Transformation Talismans. When carrying the staff in ordinary practice, remove the pennant.

Another method prescribes an unbent staff. The ritual of receiving and invoking it requires that it accompany one in sitting, reclining, rising, and resting. In places where it cannot be carried, place it in a purified location. With prolonged devotion, when the staff is pointed toward heaven, celestial spirits will render homage; when pointed toward earth, terrestrial deities will attend in welcome. Pointed toward the northeast, myriad ghosts will bind their forms.

Through persistent and diligent practice, one may emerge and enter cloaked in a mantle of bamboo’s concealment. In all applications, one should strike the teeth thirty-six times, visualize the Five Thearchs’ talismanic attendants—each clad in the color of their respective direction—and five jade maidens of the Five Thearchs, guarding the staff with five-colored radiance streaming upon it. Recite the incantation softly:

Mountain of the Great Yang,
Primal essence of the Original Beginning.
Opening heaven, unfurling earth,
Sweet bamboo channels the numinous.
True talismanic guardian-wardens,
Hosts of divine soldiers in array.
Five hues flowing in splendor,
Crimson fire and golden bells.
Assisting the perfected on high,
Exiting darkness, entering shadow.
Summoning heaven, heaven bows;
Seizing earth, earth yields.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish;
Demons and malevolent spirits bind their forms.
Numinous talisman, divine staff,
Might to govern the hundred directions.
With me it attains completion,
With me it attains life.
After ten thousand kalpas,
It shall take my form.
Mastering my five liberations,
My spirit ascends to the Supreme Clarity.
By talisman’s command and decree,
None dare fail in reverent obedience.

Upon concluding the incantation, draw in the true *qi* of the five directions, swallowing thirty-six times, then cease. Alternatively, on the Three Primes, the Eight Nodal Days, or one’s own birthdate, one may invoke *qi* for practice, burning incense and performing obeisance. Or, at dawn each day, practice the incantation with unwavering sincerity; the divine perfected will manifest in form, and the staff shall bear one in flight. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, the staff shall assume one’s form in an instant, and one shall become a true person.

**Five Sacred Mountains Talismans**
- **Eastern Sacred Mountain**: Inscribed in cinnabar on green ground, placed on the staff’s eastern face.
- **Southern Sacred Mountain**: Inscribed in yellow on red ground, placed on the staff’s southern face.
- **Western Sacred Mountain**: Inscribed in black on white ground, placed on the staff’s western face.
- **Northern Sacred Mountain**: Inscribed in green on black ground, placed on the staff’s northern face.
- **Central Sacred Mountain**: Inscribed in white on yellow ground, placed at the staff’s center.

**Ten Directions’ Mysterious Transformation Talismans**
The Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering.

**Heavenly Worthies of Immediate Salvation**
The Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering,
The Great Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Crosses the Vermilion Mound and Bestows Life,
The Heavenly Worthy of Six Transformations Who Vastly Delivers the Sunken,
The Great Worthy of Vast Compassion and Boundless Deliverance,
The Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Sacred Power,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Turns the Wheel of the Sacred King,
The Great Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to One’s Wishes,
The Perfected of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Kindness,
The Perfected of Great Compassion and Mercy Who Saves from Suffering.

**Talismans of the Four Quarters’ Divine Spirits**
By decree of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, the Directors of the Five Sacred Mountains, the Nine Hells, the Six Caverns, the Ten Palaces, and the Lords of Fengdu—universally deliver all departed souls, liberating them from hell and ascending them to heaven. Unite with their forms.

- **Eastern Azure Emperor Talisman**: Inscribed in red on green ground.
  **Azure Emperor’s Hymn**
  Facing east, bow with hands joined,
  To the Azure Emperor, Jade Sovereign.
  Divine winds stir the bellows,
  Nurturing all things in the primal spring.
  Cloud-dragons harness the solemn chariot,
  Jade trees embrace the wheel of jade.
  Withered sprouts revive with moisture,
  Great kindness knows no bounds.
  The myriad immortals sing of the Dao,
  Exhorting heaven and humankind in detail.
  The root of the heart, deluded, clings fast,
  Yet all revere and uphold vast benevolence.

- **Southern Vermilion Emperor Talisman**: Inscribed in yellow on red ground.
  **Vermilion Emperor’s Hymn**
  The grand radiance opens the jade pivot,
  The golden steps of the cavern-hall unfold.
  Cold forests shade the jade terraces,
  Crimson simurghs tread upon jasper trees.
  The treasure chambers, resplendent and curved,
  Gleam with bright pendants where spirits dwell.
  Soaring through cloud-wreathed paths,
  The gaze lingers on the true capital.
  The sun of heaven knows no dusk,
  Thick mists veil the blue-green hut.
  The Supreme’s seal unfurls,
  Silk and bamboo bear the writ.
  Gentle winds nurture the mysterious transformation,
  Earnest devotion surely suffices.

- **Western White Emperor Talisman**: Inscribed in black on white ground.
  **White Emperor’s Hymn**
  The Six Armies guard the golden gates,
  The Seven Governors keep the sacred altar.
  Alchemical bells cast transformative fire,
  The mighty sword coils with a giant dragon.
  Distant, the pure numinous ones,
  Who dares defy their bright decrees?
  They bind and restrain demonic spirits,
  The cold winds of the empyrean howl.
  Once the chill breath is stilled,
  The myriad heavens swiftly find peace.
  The true companions bear great shelter,
  Bowing their heads, they sing in joy.

- **Northern Black Emperor Talisman**: Inscribed in green on black ground.
  **Black Emperor’s Hymn**
  The formless governs all things,
  Profound, the heart of the Supreme Emperor.
  The Dao, unopened and unrevealed,
  Harbors subtle mechanisms of transformation.
  Fear lest your leaks remain unstaunched,
  Dark thoughts suddenly overflow.
  Endless waves churn and turn,
  The bitter path leads astray.
  Ten thousand years of caution,
  Yet in a single day, one sinks into oblivion.
  Without impetus, one falls into the ghostly realm,
  Calamity and retribution cannot be borne.

- **Central Yellow Emperor Talisman**: Inscribed in white on yellow ground.
  These five talismans are the **Five Sprouts of the True Writ**.
  **Yellow Emperor’s Hymn**
  The myriad heavens bow to the central palace,
  Guiding the chariot from the roots of the Jade Pool.
  The trigger of the mechanism spans memory,
  Illuminating and opening the four gates.
  The Great Possession blends with the Yellow Truth,
  Binding and restraining the souls of the stars.
  Without the Emperor, the Dao does not move,
  The directions rely on him for existence.
  Wrath becomes autumn’s frost,
  Indulgence becomes spring’s warmth.
  The earth completes the grasp of the primal record,
  Gazing upward, one bears the boundless.
  Faithfully heed the master’s teachings,
  The cultivation and application of the Dao’s methods are manifold.

The staff serves as a vessel to lodge the numinous. As the Perfected Dong achieved success with the divine ruler, so too does this belong to the same category. In times of leisure, one should receive and uphold it without neglect, reciting incantations with diligence. In great matters, it may serve for liberation through the corpse or transformation of form; in lesser matters, it may rescue from peril and deliver from distress. Employed in fasts and Offerings, it breaks open hell’s prisons. Combined with the divine talismans of the Supreme Emperor and the staff’s numinous spirits, it may move the distant and obscure, illuminating the darkest recesses.

In recent times, many do not carry it but instead request the staff from their master when needed to break open prisons—this is improper. Those who rightly receive the secret registers of the Central Alliance and inherit the Great Method of the Numinous Treasure must use the **Five Numinous Staves**, for they are integral to the register and the method. Thus, one should choose an auspicious day, craft them according to the proper form, and install them with the ritual register. At dawn, during morning devotions, recite the incantations as prescribed. When the time comes for their use, there is no need to request their descent before the master. Those not of this register’s rank should not presume to use them. If, in daily life, one has failed to carry them, then before the Supreme Emperor, one must pray and entreat for the true talisman to break open prisons, beseeching the descent of the **qi of life from the ten directions** and the **numinous sprouts of the Five Sacred Mountains** to infuse the staff. Thus, the gates of darkness will open smoothly, and the departed souls will ascend, their use no different from the daily practices of reception and upholding.

These are the matters of the Dharma Master’s concentrated mindfulness and secret conduct. In recent times, rituals have been established and proclamations made to enhance the splendor of the observance, pleasing the patrons with their detail. Yet those who do not understand the principles behind the use of ritual texts find it difficult to patch together conventions to suit custom. Such matters are better performed in silence than openly. Thus, when breaking open prisons, one should request the Daoist assembly to perform the rituals, while the High Priest silently concentrates in mindfulness. Though this may offer some small aid, common opinion holds that hell’s abyss is too profound to be represented on earth in the hope of a response. In terms of outward form, this is indeed unfeasible. Yet the ritual codes include this method, and for the High Priest, one must refine one’s thoughts and intentions, devoutly beseeching the Great Dao to implore the Supreme Emperor’s compassion. Then, what prison would not open? Therefore, to break open prisons, one must exhaust one’s heart in supplication to the Supreme Emperor.

Once the staff is employed to break open prisons, the procedures for its use may continue uninterrupted. In ancient times, the staff was first used for self-cultivation and not solely for fasts and Offerings. Thus, the methods for breaking open prisons are treated as a separate category.

**The Upper Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Method, Scroll Thirty-Five**

**The Southern Bureau’s Enforcer of Ritual Codes, Junior Prefect of the Right Auxiliary Office of the Golden Censer, Jin Yunzhong, Compiles**
**The Lamp-Lighting Rite for Breaking Open Prisons**

The ritual codes for breaking open prisons were originally not connected with the lighting of lamps. However, Master Guangcheng of the Tang dynasty’s codes included the *Nine Dark Lamps*, which later became the *Nine Goblet Lamps*. In their grandest form, these comprise eighty-one lamps, though nine may also suffice. The ancient ritual texts describe their use to illuminate the Nine Dark Prisons, and their procedures resemble those of the standard lamp-offering rites. Thus, lamps are now lit before the prison, the Dao assembly recites the codes, and the High Priest engages in visualization and ritual performance.

The Dao assembly arranges itself before the prison lamps, and the High Priest begins the invocation, first offering incense according to form:

*"Reverently, we burn precious incense and wholeheartedly address the Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Northern Culmen, the Heavenly Emperor of the Celestial Hook, the August Earth Deity of the Rear Land, the Heavenly Worthy of Compassion and Salvation from Suffering of the Eastern Azure Palace, the Nine Heavenly Emperors, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Azure Lad Dao Lord of the Eastern Flowery Upper Minister, Lord Wood Duke, the Golden Mother of the Nine Numina of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, and the Ten Thousand Heavenly Emperors.*

*May the august grace of Heaven flow forth in compassion, its radiance shining upon us. Jade blossoms scatter their light, and the ninefold qi congeals into mist. Fragrant clouds weave densely, ascending straight to the Nine Heavens. The Golden Lad attendant upon incense and the Jade Maiden transmitter of words convey our petition before the Emperor. May all we now declare be granted as spoken.*

*I, your servant [Name], by long-accumulated good causes, have received the shelter of the Dao’s blessing. Presumptuously bearing talismans and registers, I have been unworthily ranked among the ritual assembly, arrogating the role of officiant in this fast and rite, and wrongly assuming the foremost office. With urgent concern, I now commend the deceased, [Name], and all the wandering souls of the Nine Provinces and Four Seas, the Five Paths and Three Ways—those who bear consciousness and spirit, all the shades of the lower realm, the sinful dead who, having cast aside their illusory bodies, have fallen into the dark prisons, bound and confined in the nether bureaus. Without the Emperor’s bestowed grace, how could they receive the command of the Dark Capital?*

*We humbly pray for the descent of edicts to deliver the souls and the issuance of true decrees to break open the prisons. May the bureaus of the Six Heavens and Ten Caverns unlock their bolts and open their gates. May the realms of the Five Marchmounts and Nine Darks release their sins and remit their transgressions. Thus may the imprisoned and commended dead, even all the stagnant spirits of the Nine Provinces, transcend suffering and behold the light of compassion. May the talismanic commands be issued and the responses swiftly manifest.*

*I, your servant, reverently face the heavenly portals, performing this rite according to the prescribed forms. Unable to contain my plea for grace, I await the arrival of the mandate."*

The High Priest visualizes the transformation and performs the ritual, while one member of the Dao assembly recites the codes:

*"We have heard that in the eight directions of Heaven and Earth lie the Nine Dark Hells, where sinful souls are examined and punished. All this arises from the evil karma they created in their earthly lives; after their bodies perished, they sank into the Three Ways. Their retribution lasts for ages, with no hope of deliverance. In the endless night of darkness, they never glimpse the light. Were it not for the great sages’ compassion and the opening of good causes for their deliverance, they would dwell forever in blackness, their suffering stretching across kalpas without end.*

*Thus, the Heavenly Worthy’s esoteric codes include the rite of lighting lamps, which continues the brightness of the setting sun and shines upon the depths of the Yellow Springs. Where its flowing light reaches, submerged souls find respite from suffering. Where its divine radiance illumines, the shades of the dark realms cease their anguish. The merit of lighting lamps is boundless.*

*Now, the officiant [Name], with urgent concern for the deceased [Name], who has suddenly departed the realm of daylight and returned to the nightly abode—perhaps still bound and detained, unable to ascend—reverently follows the teachings to entreat grace, performing the fast and practicing the Dao. We burn talismans to break open the prisons and, according to the prescribed forms, light the lamps. We pray that the records of the Nine Prisons be dissolved, that the suffering of the Three Ways be ended, and that where the numinous light shines, the black wastes be illuminated. Reverently facing the lamp altar, we proceed with the ritual."*

Since the lighting of lamps to break open the hells has generated boundless good causes, we now prostrate ourselves for the Nine Dark Hells and the immeasurable sinful souls therein—extending to the ten kinds of beings, the four modes of birth, the three evil destinies, the five paths of rebirth, and the九州 regions—where suffering spirits and submerged souls, countless and boundless, cling to emotions and embrace consciousness, whether with or without karmic ties, whether enemies or kin. Cast into these hells, they endure all manner of retribution: some for transgressions in past lives bearing fruit in this one, others for the three karmic actions or six sensory afflictions, or for unresolved debts from former lives. In their time of living, they failed to awaken to good causes, acting solely by their own will, defying Heaven and betraying Earth. After the end of their lives, they are shackled in the dark prisons of the Earth Bureau, tormented by the five sufferings, enduring every evil. Before their sins are exhausted, they cannot attain rebirth, revolving endlessly through the three evil destinies and the six paths of existence, passing through eons without hope of escape. Once the human form is lost, the path to wisdom is forever closed. Were it not for the deliverance of the Great Dao and the compassion of the Most Sagely, how could they ever emerge from the endless night?

Now, through the lighting of lamps and the offering of repentance, may they all behold the light. Gathering these good causes, we dedicate them to the Ordination Hall, making offerings for the deliverance of the deceased [Name]. May their single nature shine forth, all sins be extinguished, and by this virtuous fruit, they attain transformation and rebirth. For this cause, we wholeheartedly invoke the Ten Directions’ Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy of Inconceivable Merit.

The High Priest faces the altar to express gratitude.

The High Priest silently performs the ritual, and before announcing the procedures to the assembly, first secretly petitions the Supreme Perfected, fully presenting the sincerity of the ordination. Then, taking up the ritual staff, they use nine strips of the Hell-Breaking Talisman—each written on half a sheet of thin paper without formal proclamation. Together with one scroll of the central scripture, these are rolled and placed in the Dharma Master’s sleeve. Grasping the staff, the Dharma Master transforms into the Savior from Suffering, Heavenly Worthy, and steps the Dang pace once.

Exiting the Dang, they face the Eastern Hell and burn one talisman. Visualizing the qi of blue, yellow, and white hues dispersing with the ashes, their radiant light penetrates ten thousand fathoms into the earth, revealing the countless hells below. The myriad bureaus and courts of judgment all face the altar to receive the talismanic command. Chains are shattered, gates flung open, and all sinful souls released, following the light to the ritual arena. The talisman is burned, and the local Sanskrit chant and incantation are recited, completing the visualization.

Next, an image of Mount Fengdu is burned, its ashes scattered with the qi. With the staff, the Hell Lamps are stirred, revealing the highest heavens above and the deepest earth below, all brilliantly illuminated, the hells emptied and desolate, the nine prisons alike. When all is complete, the Dharma Master turns to face the altar, offers incense in gratitude, and retires.

The Hell-Breaking Talisman is found in another section.

**Diagram of the Nine Hell Lamps**
Following the transmission of the masters and consulting ancient models, the procedures for breaking open the hells are fully recorded herein. The texts for extinguishing the lamps are drawn from Master Guangcheng’s *Huanglu Ordination Rituals*. The method is similar to the lamp-offering ritual, though scriptures are not recited. Ancient versions simply called them the Nine Dark Lamps. Later generations’ Nine Goblet Lamps required reciting the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* for each direction, though the texts differ slightly. Now, used in the Hell Altar, the ordination officers are still required to offer lamps, while the Daoist assembly performs the recitations according to the ritual, assisting the High Priest’s practice.

When offering the Eastern Lamp, the High Priest proceeds to the East to perform the Hell-Breaking ritual, reciting the central scripture and circumambulating to align with the High Priest’s visualization.

As the Daoist assembly recites the texts for the second directional lamp, they circumambulate and chant as before. This is done for all nine hells, ensuring the High Priest’s spiritual *qi* remains settled and harmonious, aligning with the invocations of the lamp offerings to avoid disrupting his visualization.

In recent times, the lamp texts for the nine hells have included a gatha for each direction during the lamp-closing ritual. However, their language lacks refinement and bears no relation to the Hell-Breaking practice, only serving to confuse the High Priest’s ears and offering no benefit to the ritual. If the Nine Dark Lamps are used elsewhere in the Daoist ritual space, the lamp-closing procedures may follow secular conventions. Yet the Hell-Breaking rite was originally established for universal salvation. Though the scale of the fast and its rituals depends on the patron’s resources, whenever a three-day altar is opened or closed, or the fast’s methods are observed, offerings of grain and food should be prepared as appropriate to broadly deliver the Three Paths, ensuring all beings receive deliverance. Only then should talismans be requested, commands issued, and the Hell-Breaking practice performed—this is the proper way.

Nowadays, in the texts of the fast, the highest invocations no longer extend blessings to the sovereign and the realm, nor do the lower petitions deliver the nine generations of ancestors but only the Five Paths. The intent has become narrow and self-serving, focused solely on the three deceased souls being offered. In this case, the Celestial Thearch would not descend special talismans to open all nine hells for the sake of a single person—such a thing is impossible. Not all hells may be emptied, nor all lonely souls delivered, yet if one’s intention lacks even the slightest thought for others, how can this align with the original purpose of the Most High’s ritual codes?

The offering of food for universal deliverance is not constrained by quantity; even a small contribution, if given with sincere goodwill, allows the Hell-Breaking ritual to proceed. If the rites are dedicated solely to the deceased without a single word for all beings, then lighting the lamps and reciting the texts suffices—there is no need to perform the Hell-Breaking rite. Those with discernment may judge whether this is correct.

Yet those who seek patronage dare not voice such concerns. I shall practice this myself as I see fit.

*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Thirty-Six

The *Divine Tiger Summoning Rites* from the *Lingbao Tai Chi Jin Ke*, compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Keeper of the Law in the Southern Bureau of the Cavern Mystery Lingbao Masters, Right Assistant of the Initial Office of the Youthful Authority:

The Lord of Green Yang governs the Palace of Generative Qi, where the Eastern Dipper Lord of Life-Calculation resides. The Lord of Cinnabar Spirit presides over the Palace of Nurturing Light, where the Western Dipper Lord of Name-Recording dwells. The Lord of Primordial Qi oversees the Palace of Crimson Flame, where the Southern Dipper Lord of Upper Life holds office. The Lord of the Great Abyss rules the Palace of Dark Obscurity, where the Northern Dipper Lord of Falling Death is stationed. The Lord of Central Harmony commands the Northern Culmen Palace of Mysterious Model, where the Central Dipper Great Culmen Lord, Overseer of All Spirits, resides. All receive the singular qi of the Great Tenuity, determining fate, fixing life-calculations, and inscribing the registers.

A great lifespan is called *shou*; a small one, *suan*. One *suan* equals three days; one hundred twenty *suan* make one *shou*; twelve *shou* form one *ji*. Great merit and virtue extend lifespan; minor goodness and conduct increase *suan*. Heinous evil and grave transgressions shorten lifespan; petty wrongs and faults reduce *suan*. The augmentation or reduction of lifespan and *suan* each has nine degrees, all governed by the Eastern Dipper Lord, overseen by the Star Lord of Greedy Wolf of the Yang Brightness Palace, with Sima Mingzhang respectfully assenting.

At the inception of male and female differentiation, names are inscribed and characters carved. All good and evil, merit and transgression, are recorded by the Western Dipper Lord, under the jurisdiction of the Star Lord of Great Gate of the Middle Prime Palace. The division of spirit and descent of qi, the Holy Mother’s protection of the chamber, the determination of transformation and birth, nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, lands beyond and within the Middle Kingdom, and the place of birth—all are governed by the Southern Dipper Lord, overseen by the Star Lord of Emolument Storage of the Yin Essence Palace.

All merits and transgressions in life, every sin and karma, the brevity or length of years, until the exhaustion of fate and the end of life, when the soul returns to the Great Night—all are governed by the Northern Dipper Lord of Falling Death, overseen by the Star Lord of Literary Brilliance of the Northern Culmen Palace. From the moment of birth, the recording of names and calculation of lifespan, the granting of life and the falling into death—none escape the oversight of the Central Dipper Great Culmen Palace.

This palace determines the ten directions of the world, the four births and six destinies, the souls, spirits, and consciousnesses. Within it reside the Seven Primordial Divine Tigers and the Lady of the Great One, who oversee these duties. Below them are seven Jade Maidens, who manage the registers, control life and death, and govern all souls and spirits:

1. The Jade Maiden of the Mysterious Bureau of Reversed Birth, Who Upholds the Soul and Seizes the Spirit: Jiang □□.
2. The Jade Maiden of Wind, Leprosy, Epilepsy, Gu Poison, Dysentery, Miasma, and Malaria, Who Governs the Souls of the Dead: Zhang □.
3. The Jade Maiden of Consumption, Paralysis, and the Souls of the Dead: Zhao □.
4. The Jade Maiden of Epidemics and Seasonal Pestilence, Who Governs the Souls of the Dead: Li □.
5. The Jade Maiden of Fright, Hanging, Execution by Blade, Suicide by Hanging, Drowning, Fire, and Self-Mutilation, Who Governs the Souls of the Dead: Xu □.
6. The Jade Maiden of Poison, Curses, Blade and Banditry, Execution by Royal Law, and Harm by Beasts, Who Governs the Souls of the Dead: Bu □.
7. The Jade Maiden of All Illnesses and Natural Deaths, Who Governs the Souls of the Dead: Ying □.

These seven Jade Maidens determine the fates of those who die from illness or violent causes, the souls of the deceased, their names and surnames. A separate Mysterious Bureau Divine Tiger Great Sage is charged with collecting and retaining these souls and spirits. The granting or withholding of life and death is their office.

The Male Left Jade Bureau governs the soul, overseen by the Mysterious Elder He □. The Female Right Martial Luan governs the spirit, overseen by the Chief Clerk Qiao □. These two Great Sages each command twelve thousand officers for seizing souls and spirits. At their head stand three Soul-Summoning Envoys, who bear the Northern Culmen Mysterious Mandate and the Great One’s Jade Tablet, pursuing and seizing the spirits of those who died from grave yin illnesses, violent deaths, the suffering souls in all prisons, the myriad ancestors of past generations, and all souls and spirits across the ten directions, three realms, and nine earths, to stand in attendance beneath the Great Sage’s command.

The Upper Soul-Summoning Envoy: Hou □zhong.
The Middle Soul-Summoning Envoy: Wei □xia.
The Lower Soul-Summoning Envoy: Zhang □shang.

Formerly, the Realized One Liu Gen of West Mountain encountered the Jade Maiden of the Great One and received the transmission of the Three Envoys. Upon achieving success, he concealed it within the Lu Cave of Dragon Tiger Mountain, where it remains to this day. From the Orthodox Celestial Master’s Outer Pavilion of the Three Heavens, the decree of the Golden Portal of the Mysterious Origin was received and recorded among his retinue, then inscribed again within the cave. The inscription consists of forty-two seal-script characters:

Written in cinnabar on green paper and burned, the Divine Tiger Bureau manifests the forms of the deceased souls.

The main inscription reads:
*The Divine Tiger Book of the Northern Blessing of the Heavenly One,
The Purple Text of the Great One’s Treasure Chapter Talisman.
The Northern Culmen Mysterious Model resides in Dragon Tiger;
Those who obtain it must seek the West Wall of Lu.
Upholding the soul and seizing the spirit belong to the Mysterious Bureau;
Life and death, departure and retention—this office is entrusted to you.
The light of sun and stars
Illumines the eight directions.
Iron traces, golden radiance,
The Treasure Light Platform’s chapter.
Majestic brilliance blazes,
Illuminating the Three Heavens.
Kan Water and Li Fire
Sweep away yin and transform yang.
Soul and spirit return to infancy,
Divine qi flows eternally.
The Eight Gates open the hidden,
Avoiding death and harm.
When the soul-spirit is summoned,
It cannot hide.
The Chapter of the Iron Trace Platform’s Light.*

This chapter is the secret treasure of gods and spirits. Those who obtain it may take form as Heavenly Immortals. Souls and spirits follow the light, attending the altar to open the yin and sever karmic bonds.

To summon the souls and spirits of the Avīci Hell, write in cinnabar on green silk, seven inches square, with twenty-four *zhu* each of *fu shen* and *hui ling*, boiled in one *sheng* of water until bubbling. Place this within the Eight Gates Soul-Summoning Altar, raise the soul-summoning banner, and chant the Dipper Chapter to summon them.

The Eight Gates Soul-Summoning Altar
The Dipper Chapter.

As yin and yang shift their course,
The kalpas turn and change.
Life and death flow in cycles—
Who is foolish, who is wise?
The wheel turns endlessly,
By the mystery of the Supreme Mystery’s creation.
Yet before leaving the Three Realms,
One is bound by divine transformations.

□□ the Eastern Dipper,
□□ the Western turn.
□□ the Southern Star,
□□ the Northern face.
O yin spirits, yin spirits—
Vast and formless, lost in obscurity.
O yang souls, yang souls—
Restless and dim, wandering in darkness.

When heaven and earth are bright,
The ten thousand ghosts lie hidden.
When heaven and earth are dark,
The ten thousand ghosts arise.
As yin and yang move,
Ghosts and spirits receive their due.
The Great One summons—
Why do you delay?

Whether first or last to arrive,
The law rewards and responds.
Those who linger in hesitation,
Come to my banner!
I bestow upon you the sacred script to return to the Upper Clarity.

Hold the soul-summoning banner in the right hand,
The Heavenly Emperor’s Seal in the left,
Face the northeast,
And chant the Dipper Chapter.
Raise the banner to summon the souls,
Without limit to the number of times.
After a long while, when the banner hangs heavy to the ground,
The souls have come.

The souls, beholding the Chapter of the Iron Trace Platform’s Light,
Compete to enter the altar and partake of the offering.
The master then sprinkles purification with a willow branch,
Imparting the salvific dew to awaken the souls’ consciousness.
This chapter dissolves suffering and distress,
Transforms the body to regenerate flesh,
And illumines the spirit to transcend,
So that speech and form become clear and distinct.

**Banner-Face Talisman**
**Great Conductor General Talisman**

For the right banner, use sun-red silk.
Divide the center into two banners:
Each should have a canopy of one foot five inches,
A body of two feet,
And limbs of three feet five inches.
Craft two banner heads.

On the front, inscribe the Great One’s Return-to-Form Talisman in cinnabar,
Below it, write the deceased’s surname.
On the reverse, inscribe the Great Conductor General Talisman,
Below it, write the names of the three *hun* and seven *po*.

**Upper Region Messenger Talisman**
**Middle Region Talisman**
The Middle Region’s Marquis Messenger wears a purple embroidered robe,
A red headband,
And is painted on the back of silk.

*(Talisman missing)*
**Middle Region Messenger Talisman**
**Lower Region Talisman**
The Lower Region’s Wei Messenger wears a red embroidered robe,
A yellow headband,
And is painted on crimson silk.

*(Talisman missing)*
**Lower Region Messenger Talisman**
**Upper Region Talisman**
The Upper Region’s Zhang Messenger wears a green embroidered robe,
A red headband,
And is painted on blue-green silk.

*(Talisman missing)*

For the Three Divisions’ Soul-Pursuing Messenger Talismans,
Use blue, red, and yellow silk, each nine inches square.
On the upper portion, paint the messengers’ forms in five colors;
Below, inscribe the True-Form Talisman in cinnabar,
Along with the deceased’s surname.
Combine these with the Primal Jade Tablet and the Passport,
And burn them together in a blazing fire.

These messengers, bearing the talismans,
Ascend to the Nine Clarities,
Descend to the Nine Ramparts,
And reach the Ten Directions and Three Realms,
Luofeng of the Northern Capital,
The Nine Dark Prisons,
Grotto Palaces, and Immortal Abodes.
They open barriers and clear paths,
Pursuing and seizing the departed souls,
Guiding them directly to the ritual assembly,
Unobstructed in all places.

Before dispatching them, step into the Dipper and recite the incantation:
*"Great One, Purple Primordial Sovereign,
Heavenly One of the Northern Blessing, command!
Divine Tiger, soaring and swift,
The Dipper’s Unity follows in accord.
Where the Jade Tablet reaches,
The ten directions’ essence-light is drawn in one breath."*

After reciting the incantation seven times,
Spray a mouthful of water,
And fan the ashes toward the ten directions.
Proclaim to the messenger:
*"Swiftly go to the living’s realm and the dead’s path,
Pursue and seize the soul of so-and-so,
Hasten to the ritual assembly,
To receive the merit of the Numinous Treasure’s ascension and deliverance."*

**Northern Dipper Great One Dark Warrior Jade Tablet Formula**
Another formula:
Before the stars, present the ritual’s intent to the living’s realm.
As the petitioner’s words are irrefutable,
Proceed according to the prescribed method.

Now, with the ritual altar solemnly prepared,
The time for summoning has arrived.
To deliver the multitude of souls,
It is fitting to pursue and seize them.
The Jade Tablet must be issued as follows—
Yet beneath the stars, do not inscribe the deceased’s name, year, or month.
Instead, beneath the star to which the deceased belongs,
Write their name, year, month, day, and hour of death and birth.
For delivering the multitudes of Avīci Hell,
Simply write "so-and-so et al."

*This governs the capture of souls of those who died from illness, violent ends, self-inflicted harm, or long imprisonment in the nether courts, and all such spirits.*

For both altars, spread two *shi* of fresh, pure sand upon the ground, forming a square of six *chi* or three *chi* and six *cun*, ensuring the sand is fine and evenly sifted. With the left hand, press the Heavenly August Seal; with the right, form the Jade Clarity Mudra. Using the middle finger, inscribe the talisman accordingly.

Erect the name and rank of the Prison Overseer, placing the name of the prison before it. Cast the Divine Tiger Soul-Seizing Talisman into a westward-flowing stream, then spray and scatter the water. All departed souls will instantly manifest in their true forms, able to converse with the living as clearly as if in life. If the living weep in sorrow, the spirits will withdraw afar.

If the living rejoice, then the departed souls will all manifest their true essences, no different from the living—visible to all eyes, coming and going as usual, and treated with even greater reverence. Those summoned or dispatched will respond as swiftly as echo follows sound. The retribution or response occurs in an instant; wrath is especially forbidden. Beyond refraining from selfish or reckless summoning, no other prohibitions apply.

**Divine Tiger Soul-Seizing Talisman**
*Divine Tiger Great Sage Decree: Seize the Soul and Manifest the Form*
*Divine Tiger Soul-Seizing Officers: Fifteen Men*
*This locale submits to the corner’s jurisdiction, consigning [the soul] to prison*
*Transformative Origin, the White Star flies to the testicles*
*Prison Overseer Liu □□, hasten to manifest!*
*Summoning Envoy Zhang Xin, Wei Da, Hou Di—pursue and bring forth the soul-spirit!*
*Unite the form!*
*Divine Tiger Divine Lords, mobilize the Left and Right Guardians!*
*Saintly Pursuing Soul-Officers, lead the Soul-Attendant Lads!*
*Comply with the Divine Tiger’s command—hasten as the statute decrees!*

Inscribe this talisman in black upon white silk. Press the Heavenly August Seal and form the Jade Clarity Mudra. Blow northern *qi* into the water, then spray and scatter it upon the altar and throughout the chamber’s four directions—the true form will instantly appear.

**Divine Tiger Secluded Quietude Talisman**
*Left: Divine Tiger Great Sage Decree*
*Right: Divine Tiger Great Sage Decree*

**Divine Tiger Soul-Pursuing Envoys Wei Da, He Chang, Qiao Xun, Hou Di, and Zhang Xin—**
**Divine Tiger Jade Maidens, Seven in Number: Inner Mystery Bureau Jade Maiden Jiang Wanggui, receive the talisman and carry out the decree.**
**Envoy Liu □□, deliver the form hither—Divine Tiger’s halberd flies, the Dipper’s Handle unites and follows.**
**Transformative Origin, the White Star flies to the jade-green.**
**Unite the form!**
**Swiftly, by the Divine Tiger’s power, □ cover and deliver the bodily form.**
**Hasten! Hasten! As the statute decrees!**

Inscribe this talisman in vermilion upon yellow silk and submerge it in flowing water. The master should first swallow one talisman, then employ it in practice—immediate verification will follow.

For those who have died within three years of their transformation, the talisman may be inscribed, burned to ash, and held in the hand. Raise it aloft while reciting the incantation for the deceased of such-and-such a household, then blow toward the northeast. Next, spray the previously prepared talismanic water upon the wall—the departed soul will instantly appear.

There are also cases where death arrives before its appointed time, suddenly and without warning. Or where one is seized by malevolent ghosts or frenzied spirits, abruptly cut short. Or where sudden illness claims a life before the great destiny is exhausted. For those who have died within three days, drape the corpse with a crimson silk banner the length of the body. Inscribe this talisman in vermilion upon a seven-inch strip of white silk, then burn it beneath the deceased’s philtrum. Proceed as before, petitioning with the Jade Tablet—before long, the spirit will return to its original body, and the person will be restored to life. If the celestial allotment of years has truly ended, the soul will be sent back after inquiry. If not within this limit, memorialize the Supreme Emperor to impeach the unjust.

Those who have not attained the ancient transformations or aligned their Dao with the true wind shall not be favored by Heaven. Beyond the threefold resonance, there is no numinosity. This is what is meant by reviving the corpse and raising the dead, delivering boundless beings.

**Heavenly Sovereign Mudra**
Press the root of the thumb with the index and middle fingers, then press the center of the middle finger with the thumb. Extend and retract the remaining three fingers, bending them backward like the handle of the Dipper, with the front resembling the Dipper’s mouth—within it reside the two august stellar deities. With this seal, one may summon thunder and command lightning, halt rain and call forth dragons. It restrains the fury of thunder, subdues the ferocity of tigers and leopards, and deploys spirits while capturing ghosts—all through this seal.

**Divine Tiger Vajra**
**Straw-Body Ascension Rite**
First, fashion a straw effigy in the likeness of the deceased’s living form, dressed in their former garments. Place within its abdomen the *Great Brahma Concealed Incantation*, and upon its head, the *Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven*. Suspend the straw body from a scale’s hook, ensuring it hangs in midair without touching the ground. First, balance the scale, then set it outside the door within the *Abiding Soul Altar*. Have a child hold a white silk soul-summoning banner while the Dharma Master chants the *Dipper Hymn* to call the soul forth. When the straw body suddenly descends from the hook, weighing more than before, and the soul banner likewise grows heavy at the pole’s tip, know that the departed soul has arrived. Then, take the fragrant infusion from the *Luminous Terrace Scripture*, and with a willow branch, sprinkle it thoroughly. Next, invite the Daoist assembly to recite the *Great Brahma Concealed Incantation*, guiding the departed soul to the ritual bath. Upon completion, proceed before the Three Treasures to receive talismanic precepts and partake in the vegetarian offering. When finished, the High Priest shall prepare a chamber of three rooms to establish the *Soul-Capturing Altar*. First, plaster the four walls with white paper, ensuring not a single blemish remains. Three feet and four inches from the rear wall, construct the *Yang Radiance Passage Altar* and the *Yin Spirit Soul-Capturing Altar*, ensuring both altars are evenly aligned.

The Dharma Master presses the *Heavenly Sovereign Seal* with the left hand and forms the *Jade Clarity Mudra* with the right, tracing talismanic patterns with the middle finger. At the center of the altar, erect white paper spirit tablets, each inscribed with *Warden of the Underworld Prison*. Before the altar, place yellow spirit tablets, each bearing the altar’s name. Then, upon the *Cave Table* before the two altars, arrange the sacred stations of the *Soul-Capturing Generals and Officers*—as detailed in the altar canopy ritual manuals. Offer fresh flowers, pure tea, wine, fruit, incense, and candles in three presentations.

When finished, the Dharma Master instructs two young boys to carry banners to the altar and place them at its center. The Dharma Master first swallows the *Secluded Stillness Talisman*, then burns another to ashes, blowing them over the altar site. He invokes the *Divine Tiger Officers, Generals, and Jade Maidens*, commanding the assembled troops to lead all departed souls to the Dharma altar, making their forms clearly visible. Next, he immerses the *Soul-Capturing Talisman* in water and sprays it in the four directions and across the two altars. He then burns the *Warden of the Underworld Prison’s Memorial* and the *Divine Tiger Generals’ and Officers’ Paper Horses and Money Documents*. The Dharma Master burns all relevant talismanic decrees, then seals the area with a blue curtain for a short time. Gradually, the deceased’s kin enter the altar, gazing upon the walls in all four directions to behold the departed soul—its form indistinguishable from its living appearance.

At the time of ascension, the two boys again hold the banners, guiding the soul out of the altar to return to its position. The Dharma Master carves a *Divine Tiger Seal* from purple maple wood, measuring one *cun* and nine *fen*, and stores it in a five-colored pouch, wearing it at the elbow before proceeding with the summons.

The *Two Great Saints of the Divine Tiger* appear like ancient kings and nobles, wearing felt caps, pale red robes, vermilion shoes, swords, and embroidered sashes, holding ledgers. The seven *Jade Maidens* wear purple-sleeved garments with phoenix crowns, vermilion shoes, feathered skirts, jade pendants, and hold the *Ledgers of Life and Death*. The *Upper Realm Envoys* wear purple robes; the *Middle Realm Envoys*, red robes; and the *Lower Realm Envoys*, green robes—all in embroidered gowns, with *chaotian* headscarves, red forehead bands, jade belts, fish-tail knives, and green boots.

Present the *Jade Tablet Petition*, perform the threefold offering ritual, conduct the Daoist rites, purify the space, and the High Priest burns the talismans to transform the spirits and summon the generals.

The *Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Law* hereby issues an urgent summons to the divine generals and officials:

To the *Mighty Left Pursuing-Soul He General* of the Divine Tiger, the *Right Soul-Governing Qiao General*, the *Seven Bureau Jade Maidens Governing Souls*, the *Three Divisions’ Pursuing-Soul Zhang, Hou, and Wei Envoys*, the *Pursuing-Soul Great General Ma*, the *Yang-Radiance Permeating Passes, Yin-Spirit Seizing-Soul Divine Officers*, the *Assembling-Soul, Confronting-Soul, Ordering-Soul, and Lifting-Soul Divine Generals*, all the *Bureau Pursuing-Soul and Seizing-Spirit Generals and Officers*, the *Xuan Du Water-Chestnut Dragon Post Station Officers*, the *Six Paths’ Merit Functionaries*, the *Three Realms’ Summoning-Soul Envoys*, the *Guiding Deceased Souls Lads*, the *Yellow Springs’ Hao Li Elders*, the *Nine Provinces’ Earth Altar Divine Lords*, the *Local Land and Domain Deities*, and the *Supervising Altar-Monitoring Officials and Generals*.

Hasten to the altar and receive the Heavenly Mandate’s proclamation. As you deign to arrive in response to the summons and transmitted talismans, pursue and seize the officials, generals, officers, and soldiers. Having condescended to attend, we now humbly present this petition.

We have heard that in the *Beginning Azure Heaven*, within the grain of millet and pearl, the scriptures were expounded ten times, and the myriad perfected received their mandates. The *Mysterious Model* thus became manifest, and the Great Law thereby spread and flourished. The regulations for issuing commands through the *Water-Chestnut Dragon* were established, and the rites for summoning souls through the *Divine Tiger* were instituted. When the *White Tablets* were issued, the Three Realms complied; when the *Crimson Writs* descended, the Nine Earths shone with light. Through kalpas, they delivered beings; in every era, they saved creatures. Now, in response to earnest prayers, it is fitting to proclaim and transcribe.

This Bureau, acting on the petitioner’s intent, has already memorialized the Heavenly Court, reported to the Earthly Prison, notified the *City Gods and Earth Altar Lords*, and dispatched missives to the *Sacred Peaks and River Bureaus*. Today, we disseminate talismanic writs, issue *Jade Tablet Petitions*, and universally reach the realms of darkness, all the courts of investigation and confrontation. We must rely on the divine spirits to assist in delivering the stagnant souls.

Having condescended to descend in cloud-borne chariots, we now present humble offerings to express our sincerity. Reverently facing the divine radiance, we offer the *First Libation*.

**First Libation Wine**
We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that the *Primordial August Lord* unfolded the wondrous store at the dawn of *Red Clarity*. The *Great Chief of the Northern Dipper* governs the numinous pivot within the *Mysterious Model’s* repository. Left male and right female, they traverse the Three Realms and Nine Netherworlds. Yang radiance and yin spirits can seize the thousand souls and myriad spirits. Thus, their grace extends boundlessly, beseeching great pardon from the Three Heavens. The statutes are demonstrated in scriptures, illuminating vast blessings for the ten thousand dwellings. To manifest salvation for both the hidden and the manifest, talismans and petitions must be jointly employed. Gazing up to the divine chariot, we now present the *Second Libation*.

**Second Libation Wine**
We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that in the *Spring Palace*, post station officers received talismans and disseminated them below. In the *Yin Mansion of Summoning Souls*, the *Purple Writs* issued commands to achieve resonance. The nether bureaus of the *Five Peaks and Four Rivers* ceased their investigations. The nightly courts of the *Ten Lands and Six Heavens* shone with radiant light. Where summoned, they must arrive; no distance is too remote. Were it not for the special efficacy of their numinous might, how could such luminous responsiveness be achieved? If we obtain partial deliverance for the submerged, how dare we not report their merits in the records? To avoid delaying the multitude of spirits’ conveyance, we respectfully complete the threefold libation rite. Having fulfilled this sincere devotion, may each deign to accept and witness.

**Final Libation Wine**
We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that teachings preserve regulations and methods possess canonical forms. For the rite of seizing souls, one must rely on written summons. Relying on the swift efficacy of the utmost numinous, we may achieve proclamation and communication. Seizing the deceased souls from the nether realms, we set a time for response. The official documents of pursuit and summons are presented one by one. We now hope that all the spirits at the altar will receive them.

**Proclamation of the Summons Document and Talismanic Writs**
The High Priest steps the *Divine Tiger’s* *Ding*-pattern, performs the rites, and ascends. The official documents have been issued and disseminated; the divine spirits may now receive them and must comply.

We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that the Nine Poles bestow statutes, and the Ten Directions are transformed. Thus, we adhere to canonical forms to rescue the submerged. We summon the yin souls to depart the dark realms. From the uppermost Three Realms to the lowest Nine Springs, the one hundred twenty bureaus of investigation and recording, the thirty-six earthly courts of measurement, the domains of *City Gods and Local Lands*, the numinous peaks and sacred rivers, the divine courts of sacrificial rites, the registries of sins and blessings, the governors of souls, the *Hao Li of the Yellow Springs*, the *Ming Ling* watery realms—wherever relevant, all belong to the competent authorities. Upon arrival, root out and seek, seize and present them at the appointed time. We must rely on the divine spirits’ assistance to harmonize the hidden and the manifest. Act with utmost urgency; report swiftly.

**Sending Forth the Spirits**
*Turning toward the spirits who have come...*

**Summons of the Divine Tiger: Urgent Edict for Spirit Convocation**

The High Priest of the Daoist Ritual, facing the palace, respectfully declares:

The humble servant [Name], bowing twice and offering incense, petitions the Three Pure Realms of the Uppermost, the Eight Directions of Heaven’s Center, the Great *Luo* of Eternal Kalpas, the Supreme Compassionate Honored Ones, the Thirty-Six Heavens, the Formless Worlds, the Celestial Emperors and Lofty Perfected, the Heavenly Worthy of Eastern Relief from Suffering, the Jade Assistants and High Ministers, the Arrayed Perfected of the Celestial Bureaus, the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper of Central Heaven, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Masters of *Lingbao*—

Reverently beseeching the celestial grace to deign to witness and record.

We have heard that the numinous wind bestows its blessings upon all things, truly boundless in its aid; the radiance of the true teachings flows forth, thus the standards for ascension and deliverance are established. Matters now demand supplication—how dare we not make them known above?

Previously, in accordance with [Place], we established a ritual altar to deliver the deceased [Name] of the departed, guiding them back to the realms of goodness. Though this servant is but dust and unworthy, having been entrusted with the sacred charge and consulting the true canons, we have already memorialized the highest heavens and reverently requested the descent of talismanic decrees, universally dispatching them to the nether realms to pursue and summon the wandering souls.

Now, as the appointed time has arrived and the hour of convocation is at hand, we must assemble the departed spirits at the altar to receive deliverance. Herewith, we issue this edict anew, urging the officers and soldiers to action, that all earthly bureaus may comply with celestial law. We humbly pray that the mysterious compassion may proclaim the heavenly decree, sternly commanding the generals and officials to notify all competent authorities, adhering to the previously descended talismans and obeying the present orders.

Open the gates and clear the paths, absolve sins and release souls—hasten to arrive, report swiftly without delay. Should the gates of darkness pose no obstruction, then the dark and the manifest shall all partake in the mysterious grace.

This servant, daring to trespass upon celestial majesty, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Summoning the Generals and Officers**

Herewith, we kindle incense and reverently invoke:

The Divine Tiger Marshal He Qiao the Three Great Marshals,
The Jade Maidens of the Seven Offices of Soul-Pursuit,
The Officers and Soldiers of the Two Divisions of Soul-Pursuit, Soul-Summoning, and Soul-Seizing,
The Spirit-Generals of Soul-Gathering and Soul-Confronting,
The Great General of Soul-Pursuit, Marshal Ma,
The Two Envoys of the Dark Pass for Soul-Seizing and Soul-Pursuit,
The Yin-Yang Officials and Generals of Soul-Pursuit and Spirit-Seizing,
The Officers and Soldiers of All Bureaus for Pursuit and Seizure,
The Elder of Huangquan and Haoli,
The Generals of the Five Paths,
The Merit-Recording Envoys,
The Local Deities of Earth and Domain.

May the divine retinue soar through the void, the spirit-chariots ride the radiance, emerging from the Immortal Palace of the Northern Dipper, adhering to the mysterious statutes of the *Lingbao*. May all hasten before the altar to receive and execute the written edict, manifesting swift response and instantaneous communion. We lift our gaze to the Great Void, eagerly awaiting your descent.

*Scattering flowers*

The High Priest proclaims anew:
We uphold the august golden statutes and the luminous jade decrees. Following the mysterious laws with utmost devotion, we present the concerns of mortals in supplication. We have heard the petitions to the Nine Purities and Three Realms, issuing commands to the Six Caverns and Nine Netherworlds. We deliver and recommend the bound and petitioned souls, liberating them from the depths of darkness.

Moreover, the true talismans have already descended, the jade missives have been presented, the statutes and orders proclaimed, and the documents widely disseminated. As this concerns the netherworld, the law invokes the divine bureaus. To open the paths of darkness, we must enlist the power of the gods. We urge the relevant offices and strictly supervise the assigned officers and soldiers to verify names, examine native places, gather and assemble souls and spirits, and align forms with their essences. From the utmost depths of the Three Heavens and Nine Earths to the farthest reaches of the Six Directions and Four Quarters, all are to be pursued and seized. We await their arrival.

All documents are hereby solemnly proclaimed.

*Proclamation of the Edict*
*Burning of the offerings*

We reflect upon the distant and boundless celestial courts, the vast and misty cloud paths. Though our gaze may not reach them, only utmost sincerity can bridge the divide. The aforementioned documents have now been recited and proclaimed. We trust that you, the most divine, will surely respond and turn your favor toward us. Relying on the swift might of the gods, seize the souls and spirits in an instant. Display the statutes and sternly proclaim the orders, extolling the transformation of goodness and accomplishing the merit of the ritual. Let the bound and recommended souls hasten to the altar and report without delay. The paper money and horses are offered in devotion, transmitted by the wind and fire couriers.

*Declaration of dedication and return*

Here ends *The Great Ritual of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Thirty-Six.
Here begins *The Great Ritual of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Thirty-Seven.

**The Chapter on Water and Fire Refinement and Salvation**

The rites of refinement and salvation have been established since ancient times. Though they flourished in recent ages, within the ancient scriptures and admonitions, adepts of the true cultivation have never ceased to ingest talismans and invoke qi, refining the body and spirit within. Thus, Master Liu Hun Kang said: "For the living, these practices refine the spirit; for the souls of the dead, they enable salvation and transformation." This is the original intent of refinement and salvation.

Hun Kang was the lineage master of the Three Mao Mountains of the Song dynasty, known as the Master of Observing the Wondrous and Harmonizing the Subtle, a Daoist of Huayang. In the second year of the Daguan era, he returned to the capital and dissolved his form. Therefore, the talismans of refinement and salvation were none other than the methods the master himself practiced.

Yet today, this is no longer the case. Without tracing the source or distinguishing the grades, talismans from various scriptures and methods are indiscriminately gathered and all deemed suitable for refinement and salvation, without examining their origins. As a result, talismans lacking canonical basis have proliferated in recent times.

As for the fundamental nature of water and fire, they are the true qi of yin and yang. They are the brush with which heaven and earth write, the source from which all beings are born—yet this is scarcely considered. Some mistakenly take the Southern and Northern Poles as water and fire, unaware that the mutual encounter of metal and wood could ever correspond to the Southern and Northern Poles. If this were so, the Northern Pole would belong to yin, and the Southern Pole to yang.

Often, people merely see the sayings of the Southern Dipper shaping souls and the Northern Dipper forging spirits, and thus seek water and fire from these two poles. Yet the Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper, and the Southern Dipper is the Dipper constellation among the twenty-eight lodges, located at the northeastern corner—it is not the Southern Pole. The Southern Pole, in fact, stands opposite the Northern Pole as the pivot of heaven. The Northern Pole rises thirty-six degrees above the earth, visible above the horizon, while the Southern Pole sinks thirty-six degrees below the earth, concealed by it and thus invisible to the world.

The heavens comprise three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees, half visible above the earth and half hidden below. The Northern Pole rises only thirty-six degrees above the earth, and thus appears directly to the north when viewed from the world. In terms of the celestial sphere, the Northern Pole is the center of the heavens—this is not the position of Kan. The Southern Pole is likewise not due south. Due north lies from the fifteenth degree of the Wei constellation to the tenth and one-quarter degree of the Xu constellation—this is the position of Kan. Due south lies from the sixteenth degree of the Zhang constellation to the seventh degree of the Xing constellation—this is the position of Li. Only these are the true north and south, the positions of Kan and Li.

As for the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture of the Southern Heavenly Realm, it is the celestial domain of the south, yet it is not called the Southern Pole. There is reason for this. Who would claim that water and fire emerge from the Southern and Northern Poles? Those who preside over fasts and jiao rituals and compose writings propagate such flawed theories.

In contrast, the *Jade Hall Ritual Method* of Lu Zhen’guan merely invokes qi from the Great Yang and Great Yin. Though its approach may seem simplistic, it does not violate principle. When petitioning the Wood Lord and Metal Mother as the origins of yin and yang, it harmonizes both inner elixir and outer medicine. Metal as yin and wood as yang have their place, and those who attain them—whether living or dead—may achieve perfection or return to life. Whether refinement and salvation can be practiced thus remains uncertain. Whether one attains their qi or not depends on one’s ability to summon and respond.

Moreover, this method does not lose sight of celestial degrees while remaining accessible through the human body. Yet in pairing yin and yang, it never departs from water and fire. Wood is the root of fire, and metal is the mother of water. When the elixir is completed and the medicine perfected, the four images converge in the Central Palace, mediated by the Yellow Dame. Wood and fire are both yang, while metal and water are both yin. When employing water and fire, one must draw from the positions of Kan and Li; when seeking wood and metal, one need not look beyond the palaces of Zhen and Dui. This is the fixed teaching of the immortals’ scriptures and the common discourse of past and present.

To point to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s imperial throne as the palace of Kan and invoke water from it is a grave error. In rituals, one may preemptively bow to the Wood Lord and Metal Mother or do so during the refinement and salvation rites, as circumstances allow.

The prior summoning of souls has already been described in the *Divine Tiger* chapter. Next follows the bathing, incantation, feeding, and refinement of souls. There is no need to establish a separate location; it may be conducted before the Supreme Emperor within the ritual arena. The officials and generals of refinement and salvation should await the dispersal of the altar before proceeding with the jiao offerings, for this embodies the principle of venerating the true numina. Alternatively, a dedicated jiao for refinement and salvation may be held, following recent customs.

The liturgical procedures for the refinement and salvation jiao should also be composed. As the practices of former masters and venerables were conducted solely before the Supreme Emperor, I dare not incorporate them into this method. The liturgical texts for bathing, the *Morning Audience with the True*, the *Hymns of Guidance*, the incantations for feeding, and the *White Texts of Orthodox Salvation and Precept Transmission* have all been rewritten and compiled in order below.

**Rite of Orthodox Salvation: Bathing Ritual**

Use the commonly employed incantations of all schools. Lead the souls to the bathing chamber and make the declaration:

Prostrate, we consider: the flesh decays, the form crumbles, and the substance returns to dissolution. The spirit departs, the qi scatters, and the soul belongs to the void. Though the initial filth may be washed away, the divine luminosity inherently purifies itself. Yet we fear that some may remain mired in darkness, their ascent delayed indefinitely. In the land of eternal night, the radiance of yang is sparse; in the deepest recesses of the unseen, the qi of yin is dense and obscure.

Moreover, their thoughts and attachments linger on worldly ties, and their souls, scattered in the Yellow Springs, are easily clouded by dust. Because their nature is not pure, their hundred spirits struggle to return. Thus, we descend the life-breath of the nine heavens and summon the crystalline essence of the two luminaries. The illusory and boundless waters are transformed into a vast, cool, and pervasive purity. The inner defilements of a hundred passions are severed, and the true root of a single thought is illuminated.

Let the deceased, so-and-so, understand: that which is not extinguished was never the physical form, and that which endures forever is the original nature. The impurities of the embodied world have now dissolved into emptiness and returned to yin. Unresolved attachments should be cleansed of their own accord. Then, bathed in these limpid waters and purified in spirit, face the palace with reverence, approach the altar, and receive deliverance. Chant the sacred verses of the immortals and enter the bathing canopy.

The Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Salvation and Guidance,
We humbly acknowledge the wondrous efficacy of water, whose virtue is most profound. It divides its numen from the two images and crowns the five phases with its descending moisture. Adaptable to all shapes, it congeals and melts in due season. As it secretly accords with the workings of creation, so too may it wash away the toils of the dusty world. Moreover, when the upright qi of the nine heavens descends and the numinous chapters of the Three Caverns are recited, virtue extends even to the hidden yin realms, and merit lifts the sunken and stagnant.

May the departed soul, so-and-so, clarify pure thoughts and awaken to a nature beyond the mundane. Bathed in orchid-scented waters at the appointed time, may they be cleansed and purified. We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing and Dispelling Impurities*:
The heavens are limpid, the qi is clear; the five qi ascend in radiance.
Sun and moon emit their splendor, refining the bodily form.
The spirit within is cleansed, the fragrant waters refine the essence.
Light and brilliance shine through, illuminating the Supreme Purity.
Qi admits no dust; the five viscera receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the three paths; misfortunes dissolve in the nine shades.
The five senses are severed; blessings arise of themselves.
Today, the great vow is declared; all is made manifest.
The body receives liberation and ascends to the imperial court.
We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing and Refining the True*:
The Most High and Lofty Perfected, essence of the nine numina,
Cause the soul to fly as an immortal, ascending to the Purple Court.
Bathed in the Flowery Pool, body and spirit become limpid and clear.
Essence penetrates the Great Void; the myriad qi are naturally harmonious.

We humbly acknowledge that the body is the root of suffering, and emotions are the source of delusion. From this body arise the seven emotions; from the six desires spring a hundred cares. Myriad conditions stir, and countless impurities accumulate. If the body ceases to exist, impurities too shall vanish. Yet we fear that at the moment of death, defilements may cling, and in life, dust may adhere. Though the soul departs and returns to emptiness, doubts may remain unresolved. Truly, attachment to the form leads to confusion of the true. Now, by means of the true scripture, we awaken the original nature. We spread the upright qi of the three luminaries and cultivate the life-essence of the two images. Severing the roots of delusion, we release all doubtful thoughts.

We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing, Refining, and Deliverance*:
The Dragon Han is vast and boundless, formless and nameless.
Through countless eons, the Yellow Way opens and clears.
The spirit shines with clarity; the nine souls emit purity.
The Jade Void gleams with radiance; the Great Auroral Light ascends in brilliance.

At the dawn of primordial transformation, all heavens descend in unison.
The Three Origins nurture the Dao; the Two Images embrace life.
The undelivered are delivered; the unaccomplished are accomplished.
The dead are transformed; the withered flourish anew.
All creatures that stir and breathe, every hidden spirit—
those gestating in the womb, all receive their forms.

For the departed whose fate has passed, their souls return to the Three Clarities.
Their po receive refinement and deliverance; in the Southern Palace, their forms are transformed.
Today is most auspicious—all attain radiant illumination.
The Five Emperors witness and reflect; all spirits are universally proclaimed.
Heavenly gods and earthly deities, all river sources,
the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains,
the Caverns of Mystery, Emptiness, Void, and Immortality—
the Boundless Great Sage, the Most Perfect and Revered Deities—
limitless and boundless, universally witness and deliver life.
The roots of earth are severed; names are inscribed in the Dark Capital.
All spirits respond universally; all heed in completion.

Thus, the law of karmic retribution is no falsehood.
The cycles of ascent and descent arise entirely from past deeds.
Retribution naturally exists; fortune and misfortune are not absent.
Merely through a single deluded thought, though spanning a thousand lives, one remains obstructed.
Now, having bathed and refined the divine abode, the true origin is gathered and restored.
Though the heavy and turbid form has long since decayed,
the pure and empty nature of consciousness remains eternally preserved.
Thereafter, casting off the old and embracing the new, emotions are redirected and thoughts transformed.

We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing in the Eastern Well*:
The Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well; the essence of the Stone Radiance and Water Mother.
The circular light brushes the divine brilliance; the Dark Void cultivates lofty clarity.
The Primordial Beginning parts the heavy night; heaven and humanity follow the moon’s rebirth.
Bathed upon the Orchid Pool, the dragon bears the full Long Star.
The Golden Youth sprinkles fragrant water; the Jade Maiden washes the Five Stars.
Crown and sash are rinsed in jade nectar; the Five Immortals’ forms are refined and delivered.
The body fragrant, myriad perfected ones descend; riding the light, they ascend to lofty clarity.

Thus, former obstructions are removed; defiling dust is cleansed entirely.
The vast expanse of past habits resembles a dream.
The solemn immortal countenance receives the profound shade.
Though the spirit’s departure is not late, the return to life has its appointed time.

We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Inscribing the Name and Restoring the Years*:
Heaven and earth are thoroughly purified; filth and dust are washed away.
The nine paths are refined and transformed; the form returns to the Great Perfected.
The hundred joints receive the numinous; each segment is renewed.
The Pure Void reflects and illuminates; within and without, all is arrayed.
The day is auspicious, the hour favorable—life is delivered, and years are restored.
Jade Youths and Jade Maidens hold your towels for you.
The Dark Numinous Purple Canopy crowns and girds your body.
May you attain long life, rooted in the same origin as heaven and earth.

Thus, qi and consciousness are purified; form and spirit are restored.
Clad in immortal robes and girded in body, crowned and shod to pay homage to the Perfected.
Again, the sacred verses are recited; the feathered garments are manifested.

We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for the Golden Pool’s Crown and Sash*:
The Golden Perfected descends in truth; the qi of all heaven is purified.
The Golden Pool is refined and transformed; the body is bathed in form.
The Three Lights shine resplendently; our Dao grows ever brighter.
Feathered immortal robes ascend to the Jade Capital.
The Five Turbidities are cleansed; the Eight Sceneries are illuminated.
Today, having received refinement, sins are extinguished and blessings arise.
Ever to join the Five Emperors, equal in perfection to the lofty spirits.

Thus, the divine mechanism is unfathomable; spiritual transformation is boundless.
Illusory feathered sleeves dance gracefully; the celestial countenance is restored in purity.
Proceeding with guidance, they advance to pay homage.

We offer this for the departed spirit, to aid their ascent to the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Delivering the Soul with Pure Water*:
The majestic and revered Dao of virtue, its merits complete and perfect,
descends in bodily form to receive and guide, the Precious Master accompanying.
With compassion, the Dharma-water is sprinkled to wash away the deluded masses.
Forever delivered to the Three Clarities’ shore, eternally parting from the Five Turbidities’ mire.

Thus, the bathing and cleansing are complete; the solemn attire is prepared.
Externally and internally purified, thoughts and perceptions are all reverent.
Respectfully approaching the sacred altar, gazing upward to the heavenly gates,
all proceed with guidance, together raising the immortal hymns.

The assembly recites the *Middle Chapter for Guiding the Soul to Pay Homage*.

**Proclamation and Praise for the Guiding Homage:**
Though heaven and humanity are distinct, sincere thoughts and reflections may subtly connect them.
Though the hidden and manifest differ, the gathering of form and spirit enables union.
Moreover, the exalted altar is established, the wondrous model expanded.
Multitudes of perfected ones array their banners before the throne; lofty sages radiate light upon the steps.
This day marks the turning of misfortune into fortune, truly the moment to confess faults and repent transgressions.
Now, the departed spirit must wholeheartedly direct their thoughts, present their words and petitions,
returning body and spirit, submitting life and destiny, paying homage to the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master.

For the Dao is the root and origin of heaven and earth; the scriptures are the canonical models revealing the hidden.
Yet without the Master, how could the teachings be propagated? Without the sages, how could the scriptures be transmitted?
Revered through myriad ages, relied upon by the Three Powers.
When hidden souls take refuge, they are delivered; when worldly people cultivate and uphold, they ascend as immortals.
Beyond forms and within the world, they are ever to be revered.
Between heaven and earth, they must never be momentarily forsaken.
The departed spirit, with utmost sincerity, wholeheartedly and reverently pays homage.

Prostrate with devotion, pay homage to the *Supreme Boundless Great Dao*.
Prostrate with devotion, pay homage to the *Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures*.
Prostrate with devotion, pay homage to the *Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery*.

Reverently, the Most Perfect Great Dao, the Supreme Revered Scriptures, the Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery,
the lofty sages of the sacred altar—
they are the pivot of yin and yang, truly the fundamental source of creation.
Since the departed spirit has obtained refuge, henceforth they shall forever awaken and understand.
Let them not stray into heterodox paths nor be deluded by deviant teachings.
With every thought, let them constantly abide; with every heart, let them remain unwavering.
Across the Three Realms and Ten Directions, without obstruction; throughout the Six Heavens and Nine Earths, all is emptiness.
Awaiting the profound grace, to be delivered in due time.

Again, proceed with guidance, inviting them to the sacred banquet,
to listen to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, partake of offerings, and receive sustenance.

**Recitation of Scriptures, Guiding the Departed to Return to Their Place**

**Incantation for the Offering of Food:**
The revolutions of heaven and earth are inexhaustible in generation and transformation.
The movements of fate and destiny cycle endlessly.
Only through the interdependence of growth and decline do emergence and disappearance alternate.
Since all things have a beginning and an end, this is no extraordinary matter.

Yet when the departed enter the hidden realm, severed from the manifest, how can one not be stricken with sorrow?
Born, their form and spirit dwell in the yang; dead, their corpse and poise sink to the earth.
The courts of the Five Emperors and Three Officials record both good and evil.
The bureaus of the Six Caves and Ten Palaces register both the manifest and the hidden.
Even those who cultivate purity in the world of men cannot escape examination before the underworld tribunal.
Their merit and conduct determine their depth, their karmic conditions govern their transformations.
Thus the boundaries between hidden and manifest, dark and obscure, defy all measure of ascent or descent.
Amid the fumes of burning mugwort and the chill of mourning, how dare we forget our offerings and devotion?

We look up to the Supreme Dao, which unfolds the true statutes.
It bestows grace upon both the living and the dead, extending blessings even to the deepest shades.
Today, on behalf of the departed [Name], we reverently perform this wondrous scripture,
humbly invoking the highest heavens, conducting the rites to deliver and guide the soul, and setting forth the sacred banquet.
Though the offerings are prepared in the world of men, their divine verses derive from the immortal scriptures.
We summon the sacred sprouts of the Five Directions, descend the wondrous *qi* of the Three Mornings.
The food and drink are infused, transformed into celestial fare.
The spirit and form are cleansed, altering the essence of the true origin.
The initial intent shines forth, the original nature becomes luminous.
Awakening to the emptiness of both hidden and manifest, one traverses life and death without obstruction.
Thereafter, the Southern Palace refines the poise, the Eastern Limit pays homage to the true.
The womb is returned, the substance renewed, and yin dissolves;
*qi* gathers, the spirit is born, and immortality is achieved.
We dedicate these merits to the underworld blessings, reverently reciting the true scriptures.
On behalf of the departed soul, we pray for rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recitation of the Jade Clarity Wisdom-Life Invocation:**
We bow to the Dark Wisdom, the Venerable of Emptiness and Non-Being.
We bow in devotion to the Lord of the Profound Mystery.
You shape heaven and earth without claim to virtue,
yet serve as the refuge for all beings.
With compassion, you turn the wheel of the Five Paths,
moved to pity by the suffering of the Three Ways and hell’s torments.
We bow to the Venerable One in the Golden Palace of Heaven,
to the Compassionate Father of the Six Paths.
We bow to the Supreme Venerable of Jade Clarity,
who has transcended life and death, eternally enduring.
Emerging from existence, entering the void, beholden to none,
you transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
Once in a thousand, ten thousand kalpas, such an encounter is rare.
For the multitudes, you expound the causes and conditions of karma.
You reverse decay, restore the dead to eternal life,
ensuring their form and spirit remain unchanging.

Consider the realm of perpetual existence, where form and substance struggle for purity.
In the silent abode, the soul suffers from dispersion and wandering.
The mourner imagines the departed as present, invoking them through incantation to return.
Gathering that which is empty and formless, we console this longing.
First, we gaze toward the Jade Palace to invoke the sacred,
then illumine the underworld courts to guide the spirit.
We proclaim the transforming scriptures, recite the secret incantations of ascent.
Thus may the departed soul gather its poise and restore its life,
its essence and intent ascending to truth.
Unobstructed in life or death, it partakes of the earnest offerings of the mortal world.
Ultimately, it returns to the Dao’s transformation, paying homage in the boundless courts of the Great Veil.

With focused devotion, we now make our prayer,
on behalf of the departed soul, to aid their rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recitation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Incantation for Guiding the Spirit:**
Amidst the vastness of Fengdu,
layered with mountains of vajra,
the boundless light of the Numinous Treasure
illumines the scorching pools of flame.
The seven generations of ancestors and all hidden souls,
their forms follow the fragrant clouds and banners.
With the purity of samadhi and wisdom, the lotus blooms,
ascending to where the spirit finds eternal peace.

On behalf of the departed soul, we pray for rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recitation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Incantation for Ascension:**
The golden light of merit,
faintly opens the gates of the hidden.
The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance,
the lotus canopy drifts upon the clouds.
A thousand spirits, layered in primordial harmony,
dwell ever in the Twelve Towers.
Hasten to proclaim the edict of the Numinous Treasure,
that they may roam freely in the celestial paradise.

On behalf of the departed soul, we pray for rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recitation of the Three Lights’ Flowing Essence Incantation:**
The wondrous Dao gives birth to the primordial *qi*,
within which yin and yang divide.
Condensing, they form the sun, moon, and stars,
radiant, the Three Lights flow.
The Nine Splendors merge with the Nine Paths,
the Eight Hues delight the Eight Chambers.
Resplendent, they illumine the true body,
the flowing essence returns to the Great Radiance.
Below, they descend to the Abyssal Spring Palace;
above, they ascend to the Realm of Non-Being.
The body, unbound, leaves no trace,
suddenly, all is forgotten.
The Seven Treasures’ flowing essence coalesces,
mingling in the chaotic Flower Chamber.
Swallowing the Nine Clouds’ elixir,
this joy is without end.

On behalf of the departed soul, we pray for rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recitation of the Jade Yang Dharma-Food Incantation:**
The true *qi* of Jade Yang,
the wondrous Dao divides the Three Luminaries.
The primordial harmony intones the sacred sound,
the Eight Assemblies unfold the jade scriptures.
The Five Elders drink the cinnabar nectar,
floating upon the clouds of light.
The Great Sages and all heavenly hosts,
mount their chariots to drink the jade wine.
The Three and Five determine the register of life,
playing in the Supreme Capital.
The radiance of the flowers shines boundlessly,
hand in hand, they pay homage at the Jade Throne.

Thus, the sacred verses transform all things, shaping their forms.
The incense possesses the power to return the soul,
the flowers reveal the mountain forests’ remedies.
The fruits become fire-jujubes, the drink transforms into Supreme Harmony.
Heaven descends with numinous light, water returns as golden liquid.
Consumed, the spirit is refined; partaken, one soars as an immortal.
This is the mysterious work of the wondrous Dao,
the divine transformation of the Supreme Perfected.

In accordance with the rites, we now universally present these offerings.

**Offering of Priceless Incense to All Heavens:**
Incense of Returning Souls, incense of Returning Life,
Wondrous Cavern True Incense, Heavenly Treasure Incense,
Storax Incense, Infant Valley Incense, Seven Treasures Incense.
The fragrance billows and swirls, inexhaustible in use,
circulating through the Ten Directions, employed in offering.

**Offering of Wondrous and Rare Flowers to All Heavens:**
Golden lotuses, rare flowers of the Jasper Garden,
azure stamens and golden blossoms, jade and gem-like radiant flowers,
phoenix grove immortal flowers, great and lesser wondrous flowers,
seven-colored lotuses.
The fragrance of the flowers is sweet and enduring, inexhaustible in use,
circulating through the Ten Directions, employed in offering.

**Offering of Jewel Forest Rare Fruits to All Heavens:**
Hollow numinous melons, ten-thousand-year immortal peaches,
golden-purple intertwined pears, primordial light white crabapples,
crimson numinous fire-jujubes, flying cinnabar pomegranates.
Inexhaustible when consumed,
circulating through the Ten Directions, employed in offering.

**Offering of Four Kinds of Fragrant Rice to All Heavens:**
Abundant Mountain fragrant rice, Dragon Mountain fragrant rice,
Floating Mountain fragrant rice, Supreme Harmony fragrant rice.
The fragrance spreads abundantly, inexhaustible when consumed,
circulating through the Ten Directions, employed in offering.

**Offering of Seven Precious Elixirs to All Heavens:**
Sun Essence Precious Elixir, Moon Radiance Precious Elixir,
Star Essence Precious Elixir, Sweet Dew Precious Elixir,
Golden Fluid Precious Elixir, Numinous Light Precious Elixir,
Jade Treasury Precious Elixir.
The fragrance spreads abundantly, inexhaustible when consumed,
employed in offering.

Thus, with immortal blossoms and wondrous fruits,
fragrant rice and numinous elixirs,
we invoke the power of scriptures and incantations to purify,
summoning the departed spirits for sacrificial offering.
May they receive the rites and be uplifted,
fully bathed in grace.

Hence, the perfected deities of harmonized light
bow to the Three Treasures to restrain the seven poisons.
The wondrous incantations of the Cloud Palace
order the Three Departments to nourish the seven meridians.
Returning qi to gather spirit, refining form to transform substance,
they listen with compassion to the Dharma,
advancing to pay homage to the perfected.
Facing the numinous presence, we once more recite and expound.

Dedicated to the departed soul,
to aid their ascent and rebirth in the immortal realms.

We chant the *Celestial Worthy’s Three Lights Incantation*:
Turn back and gaze upon the Primordial Net,
harmonizing light to receive its radiant essence.
Seizing the hun to restrain the seven po,
contemplate the navel to stabilize the center.
In movement and stillness, tread the void;
in rest and sleep, repose in the mysterious chamber.
Hunger is sated with yellow coptis blossoms,
thirst quenched with the nectar of the Jewel Forest.
The divine banner commands human demons,
uniting the body to refine true light.
Reflecting upon the vast emptiness,
one roams forever within the void.
Circular penetration dissolves the waves’ edge,
the true blossom knows no end.
Boundless, without beginning or end,
the practitioner must clearly understand.
In silence, forgetting doctrine and teaching,
responding to the mandate, the great rule is fulfilled.
Those who observe the Dao yet fail to transcend
must first enact what is required.
Converging in the non-dual realm,
following the heart’s intent, they unite or part.

Dedicated to the departed soul,
to aid their ascent and rebirth in the immortal realms.

We chant the *Incantation for Nurturing the Hun and Cultivating the Po*:
The rootless numinous mushroom,
source of all wondrous things.
Within, it congeals the seven po,
above, it binds the three hun.
The twenty-four perfected,
enter and exit without gate.
In the profound darkness,
the primordial essence flickers.
Through kalpas, it persists or perishes,
arising with qi.
Externally, it solidifies primordial simplicity;
internally, it nourishes the seven perfected.
The five spirits plant blossoms,
the Three Terraces spread glory.
Purple radiance and white youths,
return to the womb and revert to infancy.
Ascending on clouds, riding mists in the void,
within dwells the Jade Perfected,
named Divine Work.
To the left, embracing Non-Excellence;
to the right, guarded by White Prime.
The dark beast blocks behind,
the cinnabar bird escorts ahead.
Above floats the emerald canopy,
below, golden lotuses support.
Fragrant clouds condense in the void,
sweet dew knows no end.
Inexhaustible in use,
tracing the source without cease.

Thus, the *Numinous Treasure* is the origin of all methods,
the salvation of beings its essence among the Three Caverns.
Profound beyond all scriptures,
its wonder culminates in the central chapters.
Through it, creation shifts and transforms;
by it, kalpas are preserved and regulated.
Ordinary beings who cultivate it attain the Dao,
the departed rely on it to become human.
A thoroughfare for the mundane world,
a treasure tome of the Nine Heavens,
we respectfully recite and intone,
solemnly dedicating it as offering and aid.

Reciting the *Great Brahma Hidden Words* in dedication:
The incantations and offerings of fragrance and delicacies,
the revelation of secret scriptures,
are devoted to the wondrous Dao,
aiding and dedicating the numinous presence.
We humbly pray to hear the divine voice,
to follow the path of virtue,
that in life and death, there be no confusion,
soaring beyond the realm of flowing fire.
May the spirit know no pause,
crossing the hall of blessings.
May the remaining grace
extend universally to descendants.
For this supreme cause,
we wholeheartedly invoke the *Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Numinous Treasure*,
whose merits are inconceivable.

**Establishing the Refining and Salvation Altar**
According to old rituals, the altar is arrayed with:
the *Celestial Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm of Fire*,
the *Celestial Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering*,
the *Celestial Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells*,
the *Celestial Worthy of Vermilion Mound Who Liberates Life*,
the *Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Numinous Treasure*,
the *Celestial Worthy of the Great Bridge of the Dharma*,
the *Celestial Worthy of the Golden Palace Who Manifests Transformation*,
the *Celestial Worthy of the Perfect Jewel Blossom*,
the *Celestial Worthy of Carefree Joy*,
encircling the altar.

Then, the Dharma Master, through ninefold perfection,
gathers the Nine Celestial Worthies,
conducting the ninefold refinement.
Though this ritual is long-established,
its form is not one that ordinary beings may presume to perform,
nor can it be easily replicated.

Yet in the *Numinous Treasure Dharma* of Mount Tiantai,
beyond the Nine Celestial Worthies,
the first refinement is called the *Bureau for Swiftly Erasing the Register of Sins*,
the *Bureau for Extinguishing Evil Roots*;
the second refinement, the *Bureau for Severing Earthly Bonds*,
the *Bureau for Liberating Ancestors*,
the *Bureau for Delivering from the Earth’s Gates*,
the *Bureau for Eternally Departing the Ghostly Officials*.
Among the nine refinements, such bureaus number over thirty.

Alas! How unfortunate is the *Supreme Scripture of Salvation*!
For the text states that the perfected of the Ten Directions,
the flying heavenly divine kings,
the immeasurable great deities who grant long life and salvation,
all descend from the void,
even the ministers of the heavens.
The recorders of the multitudes of perfected
gather before the Emperor,
reviewing the souls to be delivered,
proclaiming to the Three Realms and the netherworlds,
the domains of Mount Fengdu and its dependencies,
to liberate ancestors from countless kalpas,
and all karmic kin yet unliberated.
This refers to the souls of the already deceased,
who ought to be delivered,
and the burdens of ancestral ties from past lives,
the unliberated karmic kin of countless kalpas,
who should all be pardoned.
Only then are the registers of sins swiftly erased,
evil roots extinguished—
their transgressions dissolved,
their wicked origins absolved.
Freed from the ranks of sinful souls,
departing the company of ghosts,
they receive the talismans of the Primordial Beginning,
transforming through immortality to become human.
The principle is clear and distinct,
not to be obscured or denied.

Yet now it speaks of the *Bureau for Liberating Ancestors*,
the *Bureau for Swiftly Erasing the Register of Sins*—
what meaning does this hold?
The original text describes it thus;
how can one extract a single phrase to create a bureau?
The error is grave indeed.
This has already been thoroughly discussed in the *Chapter on the Bureaus of the Three Realms*.

Yet this matter, where each phrase is taken to establish meaning,
disrupts and confounds the scriptures,
deafening the world—
the offense is unforgivable.
In this *Chapter on Refining and Salvation*,
lest later generations confuse it with the heterodox teachings of Mount Tiantai,
we cannot but address it.

If refining and salvation are conducted solely before the Emperor within the ritual arena,
then to the left is placed fire,
to the right, water—
a single vessel suffices for the canonical form,
without need for extraneous embellishment.
The response to a single thought
lies in the practitioner.
The High Priest offers incense,
secretly petitions,
then ascends the seat, stands, and invokes the incense.

Your Majesty, I have heard that intent cannot communicate itself, but relies upon words to convey its meaning. Since sincerity must ascend to the highest realms, we borrow incense to embody that sincerity. With the first pinch of incense offered, we honor the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Most High. Through this merit and virtue, may it ascend to benefit the successive sagely ancestors of past dynasties, the august spirits of the imperial ancestral temples, that they may verify the Dao, ascend to perfection, and enter the subtle mysteries. May our present Emperor enjoy ten thousand springs of eternal longevity, his person ever accorded with the hundred harmonies, his court purified by loyalty and goodness, and his realm suffused with the transforming influence of his teachings.

With the second pinch of incense offered, we honor the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures. Through this merit and virtue, we dedicate it to the patron of this retreat, so-and-so, to aid and deliver the departed ancestors of his lineage, the deceased relatives by marriage, and all souls to be delivered, that their spiritual consciousness may receive salvation. We humbly pray that all transgressions be dissolved, all cares be stilled, that they may bathe in the grace of rebirth and swiftly recover their original nature.

With the third pinch of incense offered, we honor the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. Through this merit and virtue, may blessings return to the patron of this retreat, so-and-so, and to each of his household and living kin. We humbly pray that Heaven bestow abundant felicity, and the Dao extend its wondrous shade. Whether male or female, may they seek the renewal of longevity and rank; whether sons or grandsons, may they see their family’s prosperity endure forever.

**Invocation:**
Your Majesty, I have heard that when the Three Powers first took their places, the ten thousand images were thereby distinguished. The clear and the turbid were molded to form humanity, and through yin and yang, they received their substance. Endowed with the purest essence, they became the most numinous of beings. Yet when qi descended and customs diverged along different paths, and simplicity scattered into varied practices, prosperity and decline arose in the human world, and ascent and descent were apportioned at the gates of the unseen. No sin or blessing escapes scrutiny, no merit or fault eludes judgment. Moreover, life and death are inescapable for humanity, and the cycle of return is the inherent principle of all things. The form and substance cannot endure, and in the end, they follow fate to dissolution. Yet the spirit-soul does not perish, and must inevitably follow its course. If not for the flowing compassion of the Great Dao, how could the hidden souls receive deliverance?

We rely upon Heaven’s descending numinous aid, the yearly clarification of teachings, the great promulgation of canonical rites, and the vast manifestation of models and standards. The precious talismans of the Nine Purities are issued, their talismanic writings resplendent. The divine radiance of the Three Realms is distributed, and the scriptures are thereby disseminated. They can summon the upright qi of yin and yang, and draw in the true essence of water and fire. When hidden souls obtain them, they are transformed into immortals and become human again. When ordinary people cultivate them, they verify the Dao while still alive.

Thus, though I do not measure my own baseness and impurity, I have dared to aspire to emptiness and tranquility, to serve in the offices of the Mysterious Bureau, and to dwell within the Great Teaching. I now humbly follow and adhere to the canonical forms, wishing to deliver the hidden and the dark. Since this retreat has been solemnly established for cultivation, we must carefully follow the rites to transform and deliver. As the patron of this retreat is diligent in remembrance and earnest in prayer, we now deliver the departed souls, that they may swiftly ascend to the good realms.

We reverently look to the Purple Clarity Highest Sages and the Golden Portal Primordial Honored Ones to spread their commands from Heaven and extend their light to illuminate the earth. We proclaim to the Eastern Flowery Upper Prime Minister’s Palace, the Western Terrace Tortoise Portal, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, the Bureau of True Refinement, the Palaces of the Sun and Moon, the Lords of Yin and Yang, and all offices responsible for molding souls and casting spirits. May they descend the essential brilliance of the Two Luminaries and distribute the harmonious purity of the Two Modes. We command the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Immortal Clerks and Immortal Bureaus to descend together and promptly arrive in full. May they spread the flowing true qi and bestow the elixir of life. May they permit the proceedings to commence and graciously grant deliverance, that the submerged souls may recover their nature, and the hidden spirits may generate their divine essence. We reverently await Heaven’s grace and humbly beseech its response.

Your servant, in awe and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates himself again and again.

**Ritual Proclamation:**
We now burn the Talisman for Summoning the True and Beckoning the Spirits, and from our seat, we summon the generals.

**Invocation of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies:**
The original writ of the Numinous Treasure delivers the souls of the departed. In the supreme and wondrous head, the ten cycles deliver humanity. Within it are the gods who deliver people from death, the Southern Culmen Lord of Longevity, the Marshal of the Bureau of Deliverance, the Lord Han of Life-Nurturing, the Southern Supreme Directors of Destiny and Records, the Venerable Gods who extend life and increase years, the deliverers from calamity, the restorers of bones and revivers of the dead, the immeasurable deliverers of humanity.

Today, for this refining and deliverance, the myriad heavens draw near, inclining their chariots and turning their steeds. They oversee the verification of truth and the deliverance of the living. The chancellors of the heavens, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Han Directors of Destiny and Records, the Fire Gods who oversee life, those who hold the registers and grasp the records—all assemble before the Emperor. According to those who should be delivered, they strictly examine the heavens. The Emperor’s command is heard by all spirits.

We reverently summon the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Perfected of the Refining and Deliverance, the Great Spirits of the Refining and Deliverance, the True Yang Qi Master of the Wooden Palace who holds the numinous essence, the Flame Radiance Lad of the Solar Palace, the Cinnabar Rosy Cloud Jade Maidens, the Immortals of the Solar Palace, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Fire Mansion, the Fire Bell Lads, the Fire Refining Lords, Generals, and Clerks, the True Yin Qi Master of the Metal Palace who holds the numinous essence, the Round Radiance Lad of the Lunar Palace, the Scattered Brilliance Jade Maidens, the Immortals of the Lunar Palace, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Water Mansion, the Water Refining Lords, Generals, and Clerks, the Sacred Hosts who refine souls and deliver spirits, the officials and retainers of the Numinous Treasure, and all the mighty numina. Hasten to descend to this altar, receive the command, and carry it out.

The High Priest visualizes and performs the rites. Next, he visualizes the true names of the Five Emperors.

When the ritual is complete, at noon, press the *Cutting Horn Seal*; at dusk, perform the *Rising Life Turn*; at dawn, execute the *Solitary Servant Shift*; center the decree, and gather the souls for refinement and summoning.

From the southeast qi, pierce Kan (☵), refining the departed souls. Burn the true writ and recite again:
*"Vermilion Haze holds to the dawn,
Silent Black swiftly unites at midnight,
Grind the Needle, wield the Blade at dusk,
Socks and Wax achieve completion at noon—
Numinous Treasure of the Ten Thousand Things."*

Align the central text with the middle finger. Cease profit, unite with the Orthodox Unity, perfect the dharma wisdom, augment the true, and issue the courier decree to summon and refine.

Draw the five-colored qi. Visualize the various bureau functionaries and *qi*-riding messengers descending upon clouds, each binding and refining the departed souls, summoning their spirit-souls, and clarifying their nature and consciousness to receive refinement.

Recite the *Summoning Souls Capital Incantation*:
*"Jade True Ten-Thousand-Flower Palace,
Lofty Immortals conceal the Emperor’s scripture.
Master the chart of the Nine Heavens’ surface,
Penetrating insight reveals no sentient beings.
Seven revolutions summon the ten thousand spirits,
The Five Peaks come at once to court.
The Three Officials summon the host of souls,
The Recorder examines what is presented.
Plucked from the registers of the Yellow Springs’ depths,
Inscribed in the Upper Clarity’s immortal records.
Seven generations’ bonds are untied,
Defiled blood wholly sinks and scatters.
Return to the womb’s vermilion fire chamber,
To receive rebirth in the Cavern’s midst.
Elder Scribe, guard the divine body,
Let me preserve the Yellow Peace."*

This incantation derives from *The Thirty-Six Chapters of the Great Cavern*. *"Dead souls receive refinement, Heavenly Worthy."*

**Transforming the Water Pool**
With the left hand form the *Hai* (亥) seal and hold the sword in the right, trace the ground from afar to create a water pool. Open the Gate of Heaven, release the Door of Earth, leave the Gate of Man open, and clear the Ghost Road.
*"The Gate of Heaven admits the ten thousand perfected at Hai,
The Gate of Man admits true qi at Shen,
The Earth’s path empties the ten thousand yin at Si,
The Ghost Road conveys yin qi through Yin."*

Recite the *Purifying Heaven and Earth Incantation* once, then sprinkle the pool with dark water. Burn the true writ and secretly petition:
*"White Jade Tortoise Terrace, Nine Numinous Supreme Perfected, Golden Mother of Primordial Sovereign, pray bestow flowing yin qi into the pool below, transforming it into a vast expanse."*

Visualize true water flowing into the pool from the northwest corner, limpid and clear. Draw another breath of northwest qi and blow it into the pool. Next, recite the hidden words once, draw the north qi, blow it into the pool, and spray a mouthful of dark water, releasing the mudra.

Burn the *True Water Moon Essence Talisman*. From the left hand, trace from *Zi* (子) to *Wei* (未), silently intoning:
*"Water Sovereign, descend."*
Seven times, draw north qi and spread it over the water pool.

Burn the *Twelve River Sources Talisman*. Form the *Zi* seal, chant the incantation while drawing north qi, recite twelve times, blow into the water, and visualize the boundless Yellow Flower divine water.

Then cry out in a stern voice:
*"Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, officials and retainers of the refining pool, water pool generals and divine clerks, refining and delivering jade lads and jade maidens—lead the departed souls to the water pool to receive refinement."*

Visualize the departed souls entering the water pool to bathe their forms. Burn the *True Water Unification Talisman*. Draw the north water qi and merge it with the qi from your own kidneys, then blow it into the water pool.

Recite the incantation:
*"Lord of the North,
Essence of the Black Emperor.
Messenger of the Morning Star,
Generals Ren and Gui.
Mysterious Warrior’s yin spirits,
Solemn and pure tones.
The Five Phases engender transformation,
The myriad things arise.
By the Celestial Emperor’s decree,
Messengers must heed.
Summon the departed souls,
Cleanse and bathe their forms.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands,
By the decree of the Primordial Life Sovereign."*

Burn the *Stone Radiance Water Mother*. Recite:
*"Eastern Well’s Yellow Flower,
Stone Radiance’s royal essence.
Flying Dark Water Mother,
Golden body, jade nectar.
Flowing ceaselessly, source upon source,
An inexhaustible pool pavilion.
Nine Dragons refine and bathe,
The Three Luminaries renew their essence.
Immortals exhale moisture,
Refining and delivering the departed.
Inner and outer shine brightly,
Surface and interior glow with clarity.
Hundred joints, nine orifices,
Primordial qi nourishes and flourishes.
Five viscera, six bowels,
The ten thousand spirits arise of themselves.
Womb knots and fetal bonds,
Open with the water’s flow.
Dead qi severed, evil roots sink and scatter.
Now I refine and transform,
Dead bones into living souls.
Return to the former, change the countenance,
Jade body, golden visage.
Transform and refine the defiled,
Ascend in flight to the Purple Court.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands."*

Recite again:
*"Great Mysterious Dharma Water,
Number of the Five Phases.
Engendering the ten thousand things,
Cleansing suffering in death.
Were it not for the Great Dao,
How could salvation be achieved?
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Purple Tenuity Emperor’s decree commands."*

Recite this incantation three times. Burn the *Golden Nectar Refining Form Talisman*. Recite:
*"Golden nectar refines the form,
Uniting with the Dao to become true.
Illuminating the Three Luminaries,
This is the root of Heaven.
No darkness, no limit,
No beginning, no end.
Primordial Sovereign, Primordial Origin,
Spiritual demons of the Crimson Palace.
Purple clouds ascend to Heaven,
The body rides the six dragons.
Water above, fire below,
Flowing into the Three Palaces.
Spirit returns to yang brightness,
The Great Dao opens of itself.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Upper Clarity’s Golden Nectar Refining Form decree commands."*

Next, sprinkle the water pool with dark water and recite:
*"Withered, revive; extinguished, live again.
Attain birth in Heaven above,
Receive once more the Supreme Numinous.
By the Nine Heavens’ decree,
Return and renew the fetal infant.
Defiled qi severed,
White corpse returns to life.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands."*

Three times. Then recite again.

Transform the Fire Pool

The master approaches the fire pool. With the left hand, trace from *zi* to *hai*, then thrust outward; reverse from *yin* to *si*, firmly sealing the gesture. The right hand forms the sword mudra, tracing in the air to shape the fire pool.

Open the Gate of Heaven,
Release the Door of Earth,
Seal the Gate of Man,
Clear the Path of Ghosts.

Recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth* incantation once, then sprinkle the fire pool with dark water. Burn the true writ and make a secret petition.

East Flower Supreme Minister, Lord of the Azure Lad and Green Youth, I beseech you to spread the flowing yang *qi* and send it down into the pool, transforming it into a vast expanse.

Visualize searing flames melting metal, flowing from the *xun* gate into the pool, blazing fiercely. Draw three breaths of southern *qi* and exhale them into the pool. Then recite the hidden words once, draw one breath of *bing* *qi*, exhale it into the pool, and spray a mouthful of dark water. Release the mudra.

Burn the talisman *Sun Spirit of True Fire Descends*.

With the left hand, trace from *yin* to *wu*, then thrust outward. Silently intone:
*"Fire Sovereign, descend."*
Seven times. Draw southern *qi* to fill the pool.

Next, seal the *wu* talisman and recite:
*"Cast fire ten thousand leagues,
Streaming bells through the eight directions."*
Thirty-two times. Draw one breath of *wu* *qi* and exhale it into the fire pool.

Visualize your nostrils emitting fire bells, illuminating the earth with radiant brilliance.

Then cry aloud:
*"Palace of Southern Prosperity,
Officials of the Refining Bureau,
Spirit Officers of the Fire Repository,
Refine and deliver the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens,
Lead the departed souls to the fire pool for refinement.
Fire-Refined Cinnabar Realm Heavenly Worthy."*

Burn the *True Fire Unification Talisman*.

Seal the *wu* talisman, draw one breath of southern fire *qi*, and merge it with the red *qi* from your own heart. Exhale it into the pool, visualizing the departed souls entering the fire pool for refinement.

Recite the *Fire Incantation*:
*"Lord of the Southern Quarter,
Essence of crimson *qi*,
Mars Envoys,
Generals *Bing* and *Ding*,
Vermilion Bird, Flame Spirit,
Resplendent yang essence.
The Five Phases engender transformation,
All things arise.
By the Heavenly Emperor’s decree,
Envoys, heed my command.
Seize and summon the departed souls,
Refine and deliver their true forms.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Southern Fire Sovereign’s decree commands.
Fire-Refined Cinnabar Realm Heavenly Worthy."*

Burn the *Fire Bell Talisman* and the *Body-Refining Talisman*.

*"Flame Spirits, Flame Spirits,
Fire Bells, Fire Bells.
Above, connect to the Purple Tenuity;
Below, reach the Yellow Profundity.
Repel evil, refine souls,
Spirits of the Crimson Emperor.
Two flame essences,
Three Terraces streaming light.
Refine the embryo, transform the substance,
Temper the *po*, strengthen the *hun*.
Defiled *qi* severed and cast away,
Riding smoke to soar.
Yin *qi* dissolves,
Yang *qi* harmonizes and flourishes.
Spirit and essence grow robust,
Entering the Fire Realm in profound union.
Merge with the Nine *Qi*,
Wholly attuned to the Primal Emperor.
By the decree of the August Heaven,
Molten gold radiates brilliance.
The Nine Heavens gleam,
Enduring fortune and uprightness.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands.
Fire-Refined Cinnabar Realm Heavenly Worthy."*

Recite again:
*"Qi transforms into man,
The corpse transmutes into the mysterious.
Three transformations, nine refinements,
Ascend into the Nine Heavens.
Through the Nine Heavens’ kalpas,
Deliver the departed souls anew.
Refined and reborn,
Attain the state of True Person.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands."*
Three breaths of *bing* *qi*.
*"Immortal Transformed into Heavenly Person Heavenly Worthy."*

Next, address the fire pool’s officials and generals, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, commanding them to lead the departed souls out of the flowing fire pool. Bathe them in the *Five Sprouts* true *qi*, merging with the hundred spirits.

Visualize the fire-refining spirit generals, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens leading the departed souls from the fire pool.
*"Five Spirits, Five Elders Heavenly Worthy."*

Burn the *Five Sprouts Talisman*—the true writ of the Five Sprouts.

*"Reverently summon the Azure Emperor of the East,
Azure Spirit Lad,
Officials of *Jia* and *Yi*,
Come from the empty void,
Bearing the *Jueyin* *qi*,
Azure mushroom and jade nectar,
To bathe the departed souls in the Purple Tenuity Palace.

Reverently summon the Crimson Emperor of the South,

Yellow Spirit Lad,
Officials of *Wu* and *Ji*,
Come from the void of mystery,
Bearing the *Taiyin* *qi*,
Golden mushroom and moonlight,

Recite:
*"Thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
Naturally attain the true.
Within the true, there is spirit,
The Great Lord of Longevity.
Lord of the Peerless,
Venerable White Prime.
One Supreme Unity, Controller of Destiny,
Peach and Plum unite to prolong.
Grasp the talisman, hold the register,
Preserve life, plant the root.
Roam the Upper Clarity,
Enter and exit the Flowery Chamber.
Within the Eight Profundities,
In the subtlest of subtleties.
Below, govern the human body,
Mud Pill and Crimson Palace.
Within, regulate the Five *Qi*,
Merge with the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions return the spirit,
Myriad *qi* ascend as immortals.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands."*

Raise the banner and stand upright at the center of the altar. The High Master petitions again:

*"The departed, so-and-so, early entangled in the world’s net,
Long ignorant of true cultivation.
The Nine *Qi* found no return,
The Five Phases lost their balance.
The Three Hun suffered judgment,
Myriad decrees left them adrift,
Without good causes to reverse their fate.
Difficult to restore life’s principle.

Now, in accordance with the canonical rites,
I invoke the true numina.
Embodying the creative power of Heaven and Earth,
Following the harmonizing numbers of yin and yang,
I pair water and fire,
Bathe and refine spirit and form.
Descend the essence of the Two Luminaries,
Congeal the flourishing pivot of the Five Phases.
Establish the root, receive the ancestor,
From murky depths generate vital fluid.
In profound obscurity, gather the true,
In vagueness, take form.

For all things must end and then begin,
Principle flows through transformation.
Ghosts return to become men,
Bodies undergo immortal transfiguration.

Having already reported to the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperor,
I beseech the bestowal of auspicious blessings,
Recording the life spirits of the departed.
Grant the upright *qi* to the Nine Passes,
Unite the fetal embryo in the tenth month."*

Once more, I draw from primordial chaos,
To behold anew the clear and bright.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Primordial Unity, the Yellow Pervading Essence of the Womb-Mandate,
To enfold the womb,
That its source may flow freely,
Ascending to Heaven to engender and complete.

I burn the first talisman and recite the chapter:
The *qi* of empty vastness blends,
The soul soars through the dim and distant.
Eternal well-being is decreed without end,
Yet how remote from the root’s origin.
The suffering soul sinks through nine nights,
At dawn, it yearns for the sun’s ascent.
The Great Possession opens the Gate of Mystery,
The Highest Heaven descends in morning radiance.
Yellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,
Yin and yang *qi* intertwine in form.
The womb’s origin knits long life,
Evil roots dissolve in transformation.
Peach and well-being merge with refined essence,
The Two Emperors flourish like jade petals.
I irrigate the Gate of Womb-Mandate,
Refining essence, spirit unmarred.
The Nine Heavens’ Numinous Chapter commands,
The spirit of life transcends itself.
The Primordial Lord bars the path of death,
The Marshal expounds the Cavern’s hymn.
One chant summons the myriad Perfected in harmony,
Nine recitations bring all heavens to court.
I bow my head in reverence through kalpas of ages,
Celebrating this flourishing of the old sprout.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Womb-Mandate, the Cavernous Purple Gate of the Dark Profundity,
To enfold the embryo,
That its knotted roots may unbind,
Resounding below to Earth to secure the numinous.

I burn the second talisman.
Boundless, the Purple Gate is formed,
*Qi* exalted as the Heavenly King.
I open the passage for the soaring soul,
Congealing transformation in the wheel of empty vastness.
The old root severs past attachments,
The fundamental cause recalls its former lineage.
Through long nights, it sinks in distant kalpas,
Yet faces the great cycle’s thoroughfare.
The Imperial Perfected first clarifies essence,
Named and called the Primordial Yang.
The Infant, Historian Bo Hua,
Forms the embryo, guarding the Yellow Chamber.
Severing roots, closing the gate of death,
Nurturing the infant with joyful countenance.
Meditation and goodness guide the numinous *qi*,
Mysterious nourishment sends forth celestial fragrance.
Radiant splendor refines the jade substance,
Essence is tempered, form naturally perfected.
Devoted to the profound, fostering life’s ascent,
Arrayed in order, the Hall of Light is complete.
The Great Void stirs numinous convergence,
Commanding me to compose the Life-Spirit Chapter.
One chant moves the Nine Mysteries,
Two recitations unite Heaven and Earth.
Blending in mutual harmony,
Nine recitations accomplish human perfection.
The Great Sage celebrates primordial felicity,
Scattering blossoms in homage to the Great Void.
All heavens rejoice in unison,
All bow their heads in reverence.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Long-Numinous Bright Immortal, the Essence of the Soul-Mandate,
To enfold the three souls,
That the Gate of the Soul may be refined,
Communicating with spirit to reach essence.

I burn the third talisman.
Xu Yan governs the Three Numinous,
The Primordial *qi* divides from the Mysterious Origin.
Vast and boundless, the Great Brahma spreads,
Radiant splendor adorns the jade vessel.
The bright mirror flies with the numinous light,
Opening the passage for the long-night soul.
The wandering soul hastens to its destined return,
*Qi* upon *qi* returns to its original root.
The Great Emperor is titled Yang Hall,
Named the Lord of Eight Numinous.
The Nine Passes turn the path of Lu,
The embryo’s *qi* engenders the Upper Origin.
Ascending Brahma, the life register is reviewed,
The Great One assists in refining essence.
The Mud Pill Palace spreads the Emperor’s seat,
The Three Sections and Eight Sceneries divide.
The soul’s birth gathers the wandering *qi*,
Nine revolutions self-attain immortality.
Resounding, the Nine Heavens’ tones,
Jade chapters give rise to the myriad spirits.
Three recitations array the proper positions,
*Qi* joins the Eight Celestial Gates.
The Mysterious Pass bars the gate of death,
The numinous guards the source of fluids.
Responsive convergence stirs the numinous count,
Illuminating the Dao through revolving numina.
Celebrating this infant’s transformation,
I bow my head in praise of the Cavern Scripture.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Yang Corpse’s Dark Pervading Evolution, the Essence of the Po-Mandate,
To enfold the seven *po*,
That the gate of sighs may close,
The Heavenly King descend as an immortal to bring peace.

I burn the fourth talisman.
Silent, the colorless origin,
Dou Shu resists the Great Luo.
Numinous transformations divide the Four Sceneries,
Myriad strands of emerald and crimson clouds.
The wandering *po* does not look back,
Once departed, it pierces the host of demons.
The Divine Duke gathers the wandering *qi*,
Floating, refining the plain blossoms.
Flourishing splendor anchors the kalpa’s term,
Riding the cycle in accord with the numinous chart.
The Cavern’s Life-Spirit Chapter,
Jade tones soar through the Nine Clouds.
One chant convenes the myriad Perfected,
The soaring soul unites in harmony.
Nine revolutions complete the numinous radiance,
Lush and resplendent, the jade blossoms shine.
Dou Shu opens the Great Possession,
One celebration enjoys abundant blessings.
The Supreme Sage turns the Emperor’s chariot,
The infant suddenly sings.
Overwhelmed by this propitious gathering,
All bow their heads in harmony.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Five Immortals’ Central Numinous, the Essence of the Viscera-Mandate,
To enfold the five viscera,
That the viscera may be cool and clear,
The Five Emperors attend the Perfected to preserve spirit.

I burn the fifth talisman.
Fluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots,
Floating, the Mysterious Upper Gate.
Strolling through the Yellow Flower Wilderness,
The returning soul rejoices in joyful serenity.
Gathering the soaring light of empty space,
The old souls are mostly gone.
The Great Tenuity turns the Yellow Banner,
Wu Ying commands the numinous pennant.
Summoning the long-night palace,

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Lofty Perfected’s Thorough Fusion, the Essence of the Spirit-Mansion Mandate,

That the stomach’s tube may generate fluids to receive harmony.

I burn the sixth talisman.
Responding to sound in the colorless realm,
Radiance crowns the ten directions.
Revolving transformations leave no shadow,
The dark term hastens to the Dao’s arena.
The numinous chariot awaits no bridle,
Brightly, the Life-Spirit Chapter arises.
The empty vastness is truly boundless,
The numinous soul, too, grows strong.
Refining the embryo, returning to the original beginning,
Ever riding the flying mysterious beam.
Accumulating loss of Heaven’s truth,
Scattered thoughts await the constant path.
Severing and felling the womb’s stagnant tree,
The heart roams beyond the Upper Capital.
The profound convergence is most mysterious,
Awakening me to forget both principle and self.
Bestowing blessings at the Nine Heavens’ summit,
Exchanging rites with the Earth’s auspicious stars.
Blending transformations, returning to the Primordial One,
Loftily uniting with the Primordial King.
I bow my head, accompanying the numinous journey,
Forever parting from the clamor of dust.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Lofty Immortal’s Cavernous Scriptures, the Essence of the Primordial Mansion Mandate,
To enfold the nine orifices,
That the nine orifices may open,
The heart’s spirit grow bright and clear to unlock the gates.

I burn the seventh talisman.
The Mysterious Convergence governs the boundless,
Blended *qi* returns to Brahma’s aid.
Devoted to the plan, the numinous transformation unfolds,
Silently advancing through cold and heat.
Riding the count, constructing the steadfast branch,
Sleeves flutter, brushing light feathers.

Within the jade chamber hums a wondrous resonance,
Ascending to the lofty abodes of the divine.
The wheel of perfection turns without cease,
True immortals arrayed in solemn ranks.
Above, the celestial thoroughfares stretch boundless,
The profound origin plunges into myriad depths.
Lush leaves veil kingfisher mists,
Their shade lingering o’er limpid isles.
Roaming in delight, the five spirits rejoice,
Abundant thoughts soar with radiant companions.
The five trials depart by principle’s course,
The unburdened heart finds joy in itself.
The luminous soul follows its root-source,
Lingering weightless in empty space.
Seven recitations unseal the layered gates,
Obstructions dissolve—not by divine might,
But through the inner workings that set all in motion.
In lofty chant, I bow and raise my head.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Flourishing Mansion Mandate, the Primordial True Numinous Transformation’s congealed *qi*,
To enfold the eight luminaries,
That the three divisions and eight luminaries
May fully integrate form and spirit,
Illuminating the darkest night to guard the body.

I burn the eighth talisman.
In the clarity of the highest heavens,
At the appointed hour amidst felicitous clouds,
Jade verses scatter into the unburdened heart,
A solitary radiance seeks the numinous assembly.
Resplendent, the auroras unfurl,
No spirit’s lapel fails to advance.
Jade branches stream with ethereal echoes,
Leisurely discoursing on the subtleties of the void.
Divine tones vibrate through the hollow vastness,
The nine mysteries depart from their hidden lineages.
With keen perception, no stagnation remains,
Coming and going like loosening a sash.
Illumined, one recognizes the *Shengshen* chapters,
Soaring on high without end or defeat.
The mysterious radiance gleams on the celestial thoroughfare,
Traces transcend the divine realms beyond.
Resonance knows no bounds of form,
Merely circulating the four great elements.
With focused mind, I bow and recite,
All sages together proclaim their joy.

Reverently, I invoke the Imperial Perfected *qi* of the Sacred Peak Mansion Mandate, the Primordial Spontaneous Mysterious Illumination’s *qi*,
To enfold the body,
That the three barriers, five viscera,
Six palaces, nine chambers,
Golden towers and jade halls,
Twelve layered gates,
Purple portals and jade pavilions,
Thirty-six thousand body spirits,
Eighteen thousand palace precincts,
Three hundred sixty mechanisms,
Root and origin, primordial beginning,
May all at once generate spirit.
Let the spirits deploy *qi*,
*Qi* fills to resound with voice,
Voice exalts the spirits’ completeness,
Hair and body come into being,
All heavens descend to witness,
To protect this body.

I burn the ninth talisman.
Without entanglement, there is no attachment,
In profound profundity, the void clarifies.
Transformations wheel without fixed order,
Numbers arrive yet cycle back.
Who claims the colorless is level?
Lofty, it brims with hills and mounds.
The darkened mind surrenders to its course,
Aspiring high to purify the spirit’s journey.
Such encounters transcend years and ages,
How can kalpas be named?
The floating soul follows its former branch,
Returning to the womb by its own constancy.
Numinous resonance pervades the Great Void,
Treading upon the heavens’ frost in flight.
The ford’s currents stir myriad streams,
Silently congealing, the true spirit ascends.
Without love, there is no sorrow,
In lofty contemplation, I bow and rise.

The adept again declares:
The three *qi* are heaven and earth’s honor,
The nine *qi* are the myriad things’ ancestors.
Thus, the three unite to form virtue,
The nine yang become the true.
Truly heaven and earth’s mysterious work,
The marvelous function of yin and yang.
Now, for the deceased [Name],
I invoke the nine heavens to descend *qi*,
The five constituents to gather spirit.
Having received the Great Dao’s singular grace,
One ought to heed the Highest Perfected’s compassionate instruction.
For the nine *qi* generate the spirit,
The three origins nurture the substance.
Yellow and white achieve mutual transformation,
Chaos merges form.
The six jia circulate,
The five phases take root.
Modeling heaven and emulating earth,
Embracing yin and exhaling yang.
Thus, earth’s hardness and softness,
Respond to heaven’s patterns and degrees.
A thousand perfected stand arrayed,
Myriad images stand in solemn rows,
Uniting with the Dao and communing with the true—
Both exalted and noble.
Hence, the head becomes Kunlun,
Hair becomes stars,
Eyebrows become the canopy of flowers,
Eyes become sun and moon,
Nose becomes the pillar of heaven,
Ears become heaven’s windows,
Mouth becomes heaven’s gate,
Face becomes heaven’s mirror,
The five peaks and four rivers,
Eight seas and nine rivers,
One origin and two principles,
Three luminaries and four images,
Five phases and six pitch-standards,
Seven origins and eight luminaries,
Nine palaces and ten directions,
Thirty-six heavens,
Thirty-six earths—
None are not complete herein.
All are the wondrous responses of the Great Dao,
The wellsprings of the divine and numinous.
If you cannot honor its *qi*,
Revere its spirit,
Reflect upon this beginning and end,
Contemplate its original truth,
And yet succumb to restlessness, vulgarity,
Lust, evil, and chaotic thoughts,
Then you injure its spirit and *qi*.
When *qi* is exhausted, spirit departs,
The hun sinks into the five paths,
The po perishes in the three ways,
Karma accumulates in the nine yin,
Calamities flow to the seven ancestors,
Life after life, kalpa after kalpa,
Without respite—how can this not be lamentable?
You ought to purify the void,
Extinguish desire, rectify thought,
Avoid rebirth,
Receive form in the human Dao.
Above all, nurture purity, embrace simplicity, return to the origin,
Within the wisdom-nature, unite with the true Dao.
Then the study of immortals becomes possible,
Ascension to heaven attainable.
Thus, the meaning of spiritual transformation
Is the gateway to studying immortality and refining spirit,
The heart’s goodness that turns toward the Dao in later times.
After the two principles nurture substance,
The nine *qi* form the body,
Proceed to burn and transform the Jade Infant’s Numinous Transformation Talisman.
You must thoroughly grasp this intent,
Never forget this moment.

I burn the Jade Infant’s Numinous Transformation Talisman.

The Upper Origin True One guards and secures the muddy radiance.
The Middle Origin True One guards the spirit in the Crimson Palace.
The Lower Origin True One guards and protects the Gate of Life.
The three origins unite in radiance,
Preserving life and prolonging years.
Summoning spirits to induce *qi*,
Life descends naturally.
Transforming form, refining the skeleton,
Bones transmute into immortality.
Feathers light, they soar,
Ascending before the Emperor.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Next, sprinkle water upon the initiated departed soul, and recite the incantation:
Heaven’s *qi* is limpid, the five colors resplendent on high,
Sun and moon exhale their essence, refining the body’s form.
The spirit’s essence within grows bright,
Dharma fire refines the true.
Radiance and light pervade with brilliance,
Shining upon the Highest Clarity.
*Qi* does not receive dust,
The five palaces receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the three ways,
Misfortunes dissolve in the nine darknesses.
Evil roots are severed,
Fortune and blessings arise of themselves.
Today’s great vow,
All is proclaimed and pledged.
The body receives liberation,
Ascending into the imperial court.

Another incantation:
The Northern Dipper brings death,
The Southern Dipper bestows life.
Myriad spirits attend and guard,
All heavens record the name.
Unobstructed vision,
Primordial harmony, advantage, and uprightness.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Release the water vessel, and declare:
You departed souls,
Having received refinement,
Bow beneath the altar,
Receive the merit and virtue,
Entrust your transformation to the realms of humans and heavens,
Roaming freely and at ease.

Next, perform the Two-Hand Seal of the Writ, lifting the Register of Ascension to the Celestial Realm from Fengdu. Blow a breath of Central Heaven’s qi into it, then place the register down and recite the incantation:

By the Primordial Mandate of Yuanshi,
The hour and moment of ascension arrive.
From the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool,
The host guards the form and soul.
Subduing demons, ensuring protection,
Promoted to ranks in the Southern Palace.
Departed souls receive refinement,
Transmuted into immortals, reborn as humans.
The living body receives liberation,
Enduring through kalpas without end.
Revolving with the kalpic cycles,
Attaining years equal to Heaven.
Forever delivered from the Three Paths,
The Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships.
Transcending the Three Realms,
Roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.

**Proclamation of the Precepts**

We have heard that before the Great Ultimate divided, a single qi blended in harmony. From the One, the Three emerged, and the primordial net unfolded. Above, the pure canopy of Heaven was established; below, the earthly chariot of Earth was laid, nurturing the essence of the void to give birth to all beings. The human body, modeled after Heaven and Earth and harmonized with yin and yang, is thus uniquely endowed with spirit among the myriad things.

This single qi, in its origin, precedes Earth and Heaven. Heaven and Earth rely upon it to achieve their covering and bearing; all beings receive it to form their shapes and substances. Once shape and substance are established, there is a beginning and an end. If one can recognize the mechanism of life and death and comprehend the transformations of existence, then death is not to be feared, nor is life to be overly rejoiced in. The body is a burden to the self, and the world is not truly real. Wealth and honor are like floating clouds; love and affection are but dreams and illusions. One must awaken to this truth, turn inward to examine the true source, sever the heart of greed and attachment, and extinguish deluded thoughts. When a hundred cares dissolve, the singular nature remains serene. Life and death, coming and going—what binds them? One may ascend to the breath of the void.

For we receive this single numinous essence, which shares its beginning and end with Heaven and Earth. Why then be burdened by the cycle of death and life? Humans do not inherently despise life and delight in death; it is only because they are entangled in the world’s net, sunk in the darkness of love’s bonds, their thoughts impure, and myriad delusions arising. They indulge their passions without limit, never awakening to the finitude of life. Wealth and honor burn the body; fame lingers in the mind. Treasures accumulate like mountains, yet desires remain unfulfilled. When the great reckoning arrives, none of it remains one’s own. After the body perishes, attachment only deepens. In the silent, shadowy paths and the abyssal night, one realizes that karmic retribution has its end, but the delusion of attachment knows no conclusion.

Thus, the Most High initiated the transformation of the Void, and the Great Dao opened the gate of purity, rescuing those lost on the path and delivering them from the web of doubt. This is the fundamental intent behind the establishment of teachings and precepts. Now, these departed souls have severed their worldly ties, yet their spirits have not fully restored. Though the cycles of fate naturally allow for rebirth, their inability to transcend arises from lingering attachments and unrelinquished desires. Therefore, we now petition the Perfected Ones above, beseeching the descent of the Mandate. We spread the true qi of yin and yang, unite the essence of water and fire, restore their spirit and clarity, refine their corporeal awareness, renew their primordial chaos, and re-establish their foundation. This may serve as a fortunate bond through countless kalpas, a blessing for a thousand lives.

Yet the departed souls must also awaken and reflect, adopting a lofty and enlightened perspective, so they may forever escape the cycle of rebirth and bid farewell to obstacles and afflictions. They must deeply comprehend the principle of life and death and thoroughly penetrate the mechanism of existence and cessation. They should recognize that the world’s gold, jade, pearls, and treasures are not true valuables; fine silks and brocades are not wondrous; wealth and extravagance are not honorable; grains, silks, and material goods are not worth clinging to. As for husbands and wives, parents and children—though they are said to embody the weight of great ethics—gathering in life and scattering in death is the natural order. How can one ensure their permanence and longevity?

Yet these are all matters of human sentiment, unavoidable in their nature. Now, we declare that material things are not worth cherishing, and love is not worth clinging to. What, then, is the reason? The four great elements and the hundred bones—who does not cherish and value their own body? Yet when fate is exhausted and destiny fulfilled, the form dissolves and the spirit scatters; blood, corpse, flesh, and substance all decay and rot. Looking back upon this body, one cannot even possess it—how much less wealth and love? From this, we see that in life, one cannot avoid following worldly ties, but in death, one need not be deluded by love and attachment. What should be reflected upon is the single numinous essence, which through kalpas and lives has never perished. Thus, we know that form and appearance burden us, the corpse and corporeal soul confuse us, treasures bewilder us, and love and affection delude us. Our original true nature is inherently pure, void, and tranquil, transcending the Five Phases. Then, the causes of sin and fortune, the retributions of enmity, all melt away like ice, and Heaven and Hell become as empty space.

One must recognize that before the body’s birth, there was nothing at all. Only then can one know the root of consciousness, awaken to the original nature, and transcend the mundane. Bathing the form in the Great Sun and returning to the human realm is but a minor matter. Now, the refinement and transformation are complete, and the time of ascension approaches. If reborn among humans, do not forget cultivation and discipline. In life after life, always return to the true path; in generation after generation, never fall into delusion. The Three Refuges and Nine Precepts of the Most High shall be solemnly proclaimed in the human and celestial realms—do not forget these admonitions.

**Proclamation to the Departed Souls: The First Refuge—The Supreme Treasure of the Dao**

The Treasure of the Dao precedes Heaven and Earth, formless and nameless. To call it "non-existent" would deny the root of creation; to call it "existent" would make it difficult to glimpse the threshold of the subtle and profound. It generates the myriad qi, yet its bounds cannot be fathomed; it establishes the Three Powers, yet takes no credit for its work. Sometimes it conceals its name, sometimes it gathers form and disperses qi. Its blessings flow through ten thousand kalpas, its height encompasses the One Origin. In life after life, generation after generation, one should revere the Treasure of the Dao.

**Eulogy of the Treasure of the Dao**

**Proclamation to the Departed Souls: The Second Refuge—The Supreme Treasure of the Scriptures**

The Treasure of the Scriptures refines emptiness into Brahma, weaves qi into texts, establishes the ultimate and dispenses blessings, adapting teachings to the needs of beings. It reveals the secret store of the Three Vehicles and arranges the sacred books of the Four Assistants. It safeguards kalpas and stabilizes Heaven and Earth, connecting with the cosmos to support creation.

The Treasure of the Scriptures broadly encompasses the profound mysteries, eternally ferrying across the ford of delusion. In life after life, generation after generation, one should revere the Treasure of the Scriptures.

**Eulogy of the Treasure of the Scriptures**

**Proclamation to the Departed Souls: The Third Refuge—The Supreme Treasure of the Masters**

The Treasure of the Masters transmits the truth and expounds the Dao, establishes teachings to deliver beings, serving as the model for past and present, guiding both the hidden and the manifest. As the Lord of the Mysterious Teachings, the Orthodox Celestial Master—whether ranked among the heavens or descending in divided forms—presides as the patriarch of the Three Caverns’ ancestral altars, the perfected immortals of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao. They rescue and instruct those yet to come, illuminating the correct transformation, their regulations enduring as standards, their blessings permeating boundlessly. In life after life, generation after generation, one should revere the Treasure of the Masters.

**Eulogy of the Treasure of the Masters**

The three refuges proclaimed above constitute the orthodox teaching of past and present, the true宗 of Heaven and Earth. Know that the myriad transformations arise thereby, and the Three Powers are established therefrom. Whether hidden as spirits or manifest as humans, within the Three Realms and the bounds of yin and yang, one must discern the inverse and the upright, rightly distinguish the true from the deviant. From this moment onward, forever return to the correct Dao. Do not fall into demonic teachings, nor be deluded by heterodox paths. With a single thought sincere, no evil shall enter. The correct principle is without admixture, and the great Dao is smooth and unobstructed.

Now that the departed soul has thoroughly grasped the true mechanism, it is fitting to clarify the precepts. The statutes of the Most High shall be reverently proclaimed.

**Hymn of Wisdom**

**Proclamation of the Nine Precepts**
The First Precept: Reverence and yielding, filial piety and support of parents.
The Second Precept: Diligence and toil, loyalty to the sovereign.
The Third Precept: No killing, compassionate rescue of all beings.
The Fourth Precept: No licentiousness, rectifying the body in its interactions.
The Fifth Precept: No theft, extending righteousness and diminishing the self.
The Sixth Precept: No wrath, avoiding fierce anger that harms others.
The Seventh Precept: No deceit, guarding against flattery and treachery that injure the good.
The Eighth Precept: No arrogance, forsaking haughtiness toward the utmost truth.
The Ninth Precept: No duality, upholding the precepts with single-minded devotion.

**Hymn of Upholding the Precepts**

The nine precepts above are the sagely instructions bestowed by the Heavenly Worthy. If one can constantly uphold and maintain them, after the body perishes, one shall never sink into suffering. Today, as the departed soul stands in the darkness of the netherworld at the hour of deliverance, it must first comprehend these teachings. In the future, when assuming a new form, loyalty and filial piety shall be foremost, integrity and prudence self-maintained, every action conforming to the rules and measures of the Dao. At such a juncture, this is not merely rooted in innate nature but is the fruit of cultivation before rebirth. Thus, whether hidden or manifest, one should invariably align every thought with the Dao, every念 with truth. In departing and returning, never stray from the correct principle, not a speck of dust clinging, all cares dissolved into emptiness—how could this depend solely on the precepts?

We now respectfully present the Golden Tablet of the Jade Inscription, the Longevity Spirit Talisman, and the Most High’s Register of Ascension to Heaven as the warrant for transcendence. Departed soul, listen carefully as we reverently proclaim and enact this.

**Proclamation of the Register and Altar Document**

The High Priest stands and intones in a loud voice:
*Temporarily conjoined yin and yang, returning to the original true self,*
*The numinous spirit restores itself to the body it once inhabited.*
*Unattached to the myriad conditions, freed from the wheel of rebirth,*
*One strides through mist and clouds to pay homage to the Imperial Perfected.*

The ritual concludes, the Dharma service ends, and the vows are sealed.

**Announcement of Deliverance for the Soul**

This may also be universally applied for collective deliverance and refinement at the Bridge of Transformation. For dedicated deliverance and proper offering, its exclusive use is preferable.

The Rite of the Bridge of Deliverance has existed since antiquity. In recent times, it has been employed with a pavilion at the four gates, each accompanied by a crude verse. However, Daoist rituals include hymns, eulogies, *Step-in-Emptiness* verses, *White Crane* verses, and other forms of chanting, none of which have ancient precedents for such verses. Though adding vulgar forms during the sending-off of the departed may not cause grave harm, in completing the fast and establishing the ritual, one must adhere to canonical propriety. How could improper words be proclaimed before the assembly? Therefore, we now remove the verses and replace them with plain text, followed by the invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s name, thereby avoiding ridicule from the discerning.

We humbly consider that the transformations of time are unfathomable, and life cannot endure forever. The succession of generations is not constant, and death should not long linger. The essence lies in illuminating the mind and perceiving one’s nature, the crux in awakening to the correct and transcending the mundane. The profound and quiescent Mysterious宗, the wondrous and empty Dao—Heaven and Earth are founded thereby, yin and yang are shaped therefrom. One should henceforth take refuge therein. May the departed, through the encounters ahead and the merits of this fast now accomplished, attain the fruition of goodness, receive the talismanic insignia, partake of the accumulated virtues, cross the Dharma Bridge and proceed onward, and ascend the cloud-path to lofty realms.

The assembly, with utmost sincerity, extols and escorts the departed.

**The Heavenly Worthy of the Great Bridge of Deliverance**
*A Step-in-Emptiness Verse*

The Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Qi of the East arrives at the eastern pavilion.
We humbly consider that the Dao’s grace responds with goodness, and the blessings of the fast are boundless. The obscure and benighted are thus elevated, and the shades of the yin realm are freed from lingering. Gazing toward the imperial palace of Azure Radiance, we pay homage to the Celestial Palace of Eternal Joy. May we receive the shelter of guidance and be embraced by the transforming blessings. This is the direct path—most fitting for taking refuge. Pointing straight to the azure heavens, we aspire to stride aloft. With shared sincerity, we escort and reverently extol.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Three Qi of the South stands at the southern pavilion.
We humbly consider that the mechanism of cyclic change is inherently without stagnation. The view of attachment, however, often leads to self-entanglement.

Now, having bathed in the purifying winds of the spirit, one may fully illumine the original nature. Gazing toward the heavens and revering the sages, we ascend to the realm of flowing fire. Turning to the Dao and returning to the true, we proceed to the palace of soul-refinement. With single-minded seeking of deliverance, the six desires are cast aside from delusion. Looking upward, we bathe in the mysterious ford to nurture immortal transformation. Once more we proclaim the sacred countenance and reverently escort the cloud-borne journey.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Seven Qi of the West stands at the western pavilion.
We humbly consider that when the One True is self-realized, the nine earths are all emptied. Yet without the radiant essence of the two luminaries, how could the five spirits attain clear perception? Thus, gazing toward the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, we bow our heads; envisioning the Golden Perfected Sagely Mother, we incline our hearts. Looking upward, we beseech the powers of generation and transformation to implore deliverance. Whether hidden or manifest, ever delighting in the Dao, we roam freely; illuminating nature and mind, we forever receive grace and attain purity. We must maintain right thought and never indulge in wayward passions. With shared devotion, we extol and thrice reverently escort.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Five Qi of the North proceeds to the northern pavilion.
We humbly consider that gazing northward, this is the Central Heaven. Looking upward, it is ever higher—this is the zenith of the heavens. Contemplating the vastness of the vaulted sky, its boundlessness is unfathomable. Beholding the distant Gates of Heaven, their towering majesty knows no limit. Having revealed worldly sentiments in our supplication, we universally pray for the rebirth of the obscured and benighted. By the grace of the imperial favor, the rites of the fast are fulfilled. Riding this wondrous benefit, we may further purify thoughts and clarify the spirit. Relying on this good cause, we swiftly return to the true and realize our nature. With no obstruction, let there be no hesitation. The sacred name is proclaimed again to aid our progress.

The Heavenly Worthy of Joyous Freedom leads to the incense-burning altar.
The Realm of Ultimate Bliss and the Three Clarities—having come, we now offer in return.
We humbly consider that the exalted perfected, in their compassion, emit the auspicious radiance of the Three Caverns. The Great Dao, in its profound emptiness, spreads wondrous shade across the ten directions. Grace extends through the six heavens and nine earths; teachings pervade the three realms and four quarters. Both the obscure and the manifest receive shelter; the living and the dead share in blessings. In boundless compassion for the world, none are left undelivered. The fast’s sponsor, [Name], has exhausted sincerity in reverently conducting these rites, dedicating them to the state and universally benefiting all beings. Gathering these meritorious deeds, we pray for the deliverance of the departed soul of [Name], that they may ascend to a blessed realm. We humbly pray that heavenly grace universally bestows salvation, the Dao’s blessings widely unfold, good fruits come to perfect fulfillment, and below, all karmic entanglements are cast off. Through the true talismans of deliverance, above, they transcend the heavens of the Three Qi. Naturally understanding the causes of past lives, they forever dissolve obstacles on the path ahead. May their spirit be free, in harmony with the Dao, returning blessings to the living and leaving a fragrant legacy for posterity. May the three paths and nine nights all attain tranquility; may the myriad kinds and four births all receive ascent and deliverance.

For the supreme karmic connection, with wholehearted devotion, we invoke and praise the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, and their inconceivable merits and virtues.

The Talisman of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Hymn
This talisman embodies the qi of the Nine Heavens from the original hymn. It belongs exclusively to the Supreme Clarity Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure’s original canon and cannot be mingled with other methods. The talismans of the Nine Yangs or the Brahma Qi of the Nine Empyreans differ from this one. The talisman is recorded in another text and will not be transcribed here.

The Talisman of the Jade Infant’s Spiritual Transformation
The True Form of Mount Fengdu

The talismans for refinement and deliverance are generally as described above. Only the Talisman for Refinement of the Body derives from the Divine Empyrean. Yet this talisman consists merely of the ten celestial stems, for humans are born through the five phases, and now they draw once more upon the qi of the five phases to refine their souls. These twelve characters correspond to:
- *Jia* and *Yi* as Wood,
- *Bing* and *Ding* as Fire,
- *Wu* and *Ji* as Earth,
- *Geng* and *Xin* as Metal,
- *Ren* and *Gui* as Water.

Thus, when summoning the numinous sprouts of the five directions, one invokes the qi of the five phases. Though not exclusively belonging to the Divine Empyrean, its methods naturally include formulas for refinement and deliverance. In the original Numinous Treasure canon, all refinement and deliverance employ the talismans of self-refinement from the *Scripture of Life-Generating*.

The twelve meridian talismans commonly used today should not be incorporated, for the true qi of yin and yang refines the hun and po, gathers the scattered and wandering, restores luminous spirit, and dispels turbid obstructions. This enables the departed soul to recognize that the decayed corpse is not worth clinging to, while the re-gathered spiritual consciousness may return to life. Only then does one petition the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Thearch to send down numinous essences, allowing the ninefold qi to descend and infuse the form, so that spirit and body are restored, the Dao-nature is re-endowed, and the root of life is re-established.

As for the twelve meridian talismans, they pertain to the post-conception stage when the ninefold qi coalesces into form, and after nine months, when spirit spreads and qi fills the body, enabling sound—at which point the meridians naturally arise. Thus, the process begins with the dual refinement of water and fire and concludes with the coalescence of the ninefold qi. The work of returning the ghost-soul to life is then complete.

The Talisman of the Jade Infant’s Spiritual Transformation is also used by practitioners of self-cultivation to refine their spirit. Therefore, at the conclusion of its application, one instructs the adept to illuminate their spirit, after which they receive the precepts, accept the talismanic command, and proceed directly onto the path of rebirth. Though the response to illumination depends on Heaven, the practice itself must follow reason.

In recent times, the protocols for refinement and deliverance have fallen out of alignment, and talismanic commands have diverged, making it improper to mix them and risk losing the original tradition. Take, for instance, the True Form of Mount Fengdu, which has been transmitted for ages without alteration. Yet in the east of Zhejiang, some have added the Black Pool to its side, while in the west of Zhejiang, others have appended the Gorge Stone Hell. Such additions are unwarranted.

Those who added the Black Pool do so without clear intent or textual basis. Some may have noted that the *Scripture of Immortal Precepts* lists eighteen hells, while the mountain diagram marks only seventeen, and thus appended the Black Pool to complete the count. They fail to recognize that the diagram’s labels—such as the Palace of the Heavenly Thearch, the Palace of the Ghostly Thearch, and the Gate of Heavenly Communication—refer to its palaces and halls, while the Upper Six Caves and Lower Six Bureaus denote its administrative offices. The seventeen marked locations are merely palaces and bureaus; the actual hells are innumerable. To conflate bureaus with hells is to grossly misconstrue the scripture’s meaning. Moreover, within a single bureau, the number of hells under its jurisdiction remains unknown.

The *Scripture of Karmic Retribution and Causation* speaks of thirty-six hells, while the Three Officials are said to govern twenty-four—these accounts vary, and the mountain diagram should not be altered lightly. If there is scriptural justification, then the True Form of Mount Fengdu, transmitted since antiquity, has never been modified by immortals or advanced adepts; it is not for modern practitioners to seek novelty.

As for the Gorge Stone Blood Lake, it was fabricated solely to frighten households with childbirth, extorting money for deliverance rites—its absurdity is self-evident.

All ancient protocols for purification rites differ from the vulgar practices recorded in external ritual manuals. The newly compiled version here replaces the common secular usages, aiming for greater relevance to the matter at hand, not out of a desire for innovation.

*Universal Feeding Rite for Salvation*

At the commencement of the fast, first establish the *jiakuo* enclosure upon open ground, ensuring it is spacious, and strictly prohibit noise and disturbance. When conducting the universal summons, set up an incense table, where the High Priest faces the celestial palace to make an oral memorial. Then, invite one Daoist to perform the universal summons. This entails first submitting documents to the Three Realms and petitioning the Divine Tiger Generals and officials to carry out the universal summons in advance. If, at the time of the rite, the High Priest does not wish to make another announcement, this may also be permitted.

Set up the incense table before the *jiakuo* enclosure. The High Priest offers incense, faces the celestial palace, and makes an oral memorial:

*"In full ritual attire, your subject [Name], bowing reverently with trepidation, humbly memorializes the Vacuous and Spontaneous Original Celestial Venerable of the Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Northern Culmen, the Celestial August Emperor of the Gouchen Star Palace, the August Earthly Deity of the Rear Land, the Celestial Venerables of the Lingbao in the Ten Directions, and the Most High Lord of Great Compassion and Salvation of the Eastern Culmen Azure Palace. May the celestial compassion deign to cast its illuminating gaze upon this offering. Your subject has heard that the Supreme Dao has inaugurated the lofty perfected ones of boundless mercy and the vast salvific protocols."*

That mortal beings may be gathered under the transforming authority, and late learners may be linked to the dharma office. This is to broadly extend beneficent grace and thoroughly permeate the imperial favor. All that moves and grows shall be embraced within the nurturing transformation, and all that is hidden and obscure shall be encompassed in compassionate care.

Your subject has long received the luminous teachings yet has achieved no extraordinary merit. In governing households and transforming the people, how dare I forget my fundamental duty? In delivering the hidden and aiding the manifest, I have but slightly demonstrated my humble diligence.

Now, the patron of this retreat, [Name], has roused their resolve to perform the fast, pouring forth their heart for universal deliverance. Though already memorialized at the celestial court, what remains is to broadly succor those of the nether paths. Having prepared modest offerings and disseminated the esoteric scriptures, we summon the multitudes of the Six Paths to assemble at the retreat’s feast, gathering the souls of all beings to partake in this offering.

We reverently beseech that a special mandate be issued from heaven and transmitted to the nether bureaus, pardoning transgressions, absolving faults, and unlocking the barred gates. May the hidden souls of the Three Realms all gather, and may the sunken spirits of the Six Directions together arrive. Permit their ascent, and allow your subject to initiate their deliverance. We dare to hope for a manifest response, fulfilling the earnest prayers below.

Your subject, daring to offend the celestial majesty, prostrates in utmost supplication, awaiting the command’s descent.

The Daoist assembly raises the banners and chants the *Dou* hymns:
*"The Great Tenuity returns the Yellow Banner,
The Wu Ying commands the numinous streamers.
Summoning the long-night repositories,
Delivering and receiving the living souls."*

First, the Six Paths are summoned.
Now, the Six Paths are: the Heavenly Path, the Divine Path, the Human Path, the Hell Path, the Hungry Ghost Path, and the Animal Path.

The official documents are dispatched, some invoking the Six Paths and Three Ways, others the Five Paths and Three Ways. The Three Ways are: the Heavenly Way, where thunder drives and lightning serves; the Earthly Way, where sand is borne and stones are carried; and the Watery Way, where waves surge in the boundless deep. The Five Paths refer to the verse in the *Scripture of Salvation*: *"If one wishes to traverse the Five Paths, what then shall I do?"*—these are the realms of the Five Sufferings, namely the Five Paths. When the Five Paths are used in the documents, this is the model followed, though the Six Paths may also be employed.

Yet in delivering the suffering souls, priority is often given to the Five Evil Paths. Now, at this summoning and gathering, sages and mortals alike are universally included, high and low equally partake—thus the text of the Six Paths cannot be omitted. The details in the documents may be further deliberated.

The form and explanation of the rites have all been transmitted from antiquity and are not recent innovations. Where no canonical basis exists, we have resolutely excised such additions, daring not to introduce confusion.

We reverently extend the supplication to the multitudes of the Heavenly Path.
Now, the Heavenly Path: they dwell within the Three Realms, arrayed in the ranks of the various heavens, governing with distinctions of grade and title, their names and orders beyond reckoning. Born with extraordinary endowments and long infused with the numinous *qi*, their merit complete and the Dao perfected, their elixirs refined and cinnabar congealed, some attain the ranks of immortals, others receive the scriptures of the grotto-heavens. Thus they ascend the empyrean, soaring through the void, assisting in the regulation of yin and yang, aiding the work of creation. As their virtuous deeds accumulate, their exalted positions gradually rise, their divine transformations becoming inexhaustible, their awe-inspiring power unfathomable.

We pray that they may temporarily depart their celestial palaces and briefly descend to the dusty realm, riding the *qi* to arrive below, floating through the air to condescend. May they guide the multitudes of the Five Paths, enlighten the souls of the Ten Kinds, record this sincere devotion, and bear witness to the offerings.

The multitudes of the Heavenly Path, deign to descend.

We reverently extend the summons to the multitudes of the Divine Path.
Now, the Divine Path: their workings are subtle and unfathomable, their manifestations boundless. They govern fortune and misfortune among humans, determine good and ill beyond the world, grasp the mountains and rivers, command the spirits and gods, regulate the winds and rains of the four seasons, and govern yin and yang across the nine lands. Responding to the heart’s call and the object’s plea, they bestow grace as they encounter it, dwelling in obscurity yet governing with clarity, pacifying the people and aiding the multitudes. Their authority varies, their appointed offices differ. Some are sagely emperors or illustrious kings, others loyal ministers or martyrs, or local heroes, or the luminous spirits of the altars and temples, those who established merit and were enfeoffed as gods. They guard the borders to bestow blessings, protect the living to spread felicity, their merit returning to the true Dao, their virtue aiding the mysterious workings.

We pray that their divine transformations may swiftly occur, their numinous traces momentarily appear, that they may come to the celestial court and assemble at the retreat’s altar. May they witness the pure feast and receive the offerings of the dusty realm.

The multitudes of the Divine Path, deign to descend.

We reverently extend the summons to the multitudes of the Human Path.
Now, the Human Path: they receive the *qi* of yin and yang, are shaped by heaven and earth, and dwell within the Five Phases, thus becoming the most numinous of the myriad beings. Divided into male and female, they vary in beauty and plainness; ranked in nobility and baseness, their natures and perceptions differ. Some are noble, others base; some wise, others foolish. Some are sheltered in the Central Lands, others born in foreign lands. Some attain office through literary refinement, others serve as claws and teeth through cunning strategy. Some face the peril of cold and hunger on the dusty roads, others endure chronic illness in thatched huts. Such distinctions indeed depend on cultivation.

The common folk are numerous, their kinds diverse, yet all belong to the Human Path, sharing the numinous essence. Alas, their lifespans have limits, their existence and demise are fated; their forms and bones are not their own, their souls and spirits belong to the void. They cannot live forever in the yang world, nor should they long linger in the nether bureaus.

We pray that they may purify their thoughts, compose their forms and spirits, awaken to the Dao and transcend the mundane, recognize the illusory and know the insubstantial. May they come to the sincere offerings, look up to partake in the grace of deliverance, listen to the dharma and hear the scriptures, pay homage to the perfected and receive the memorials.

The multitudes of the Human Path, along with all their kin, are each summoned to come.

We reverently extend the summons to the multitudes of the Hungry Ghost Path.
Now, the Hungry Ghost Path: some are confined in the long night, others have fallen into delusion; some due to past lives’ cultivation, others because of accumulated deeds over many lives; some suffer karmic retribution, others are summoned by decree; some are mired in habitual delusion, their perceptions rigid and attached. Thus their souls drift and scatter, their spirits wander and disperse, floating within the Six Directions, languishing across the Nine Provinces.

The rare reach of memorial offerings, the unmet partaking in ancestral rites—liberation remains distant, ascension lacks a path. Where to find solace? So remote, with no refuge.

If not for awakening to one’s nature and returning to the true, how could one emerge from delusion and enter enlightenment?

We humbly pray to rely on the shelter of the perfected, solemnly invoking the grace of the Dao, that all may be guided to gather at the ritual altar, summoned to assemble at the dharma assembly. Reverently pay homage to the Ninefold Celestial Thearchs, to break free from the ninefold earthly bonds; listen to the proclamation of the sacred scriptures of the Three Caverns, to dissolve the obstacles of the three wretched paths.

The multitudes of the Hungry Ghost Path, along with all their kin, are each summoned to come.

We reverently extend the summons to the multitudes of the Four Births Path.
Now, the Four Births Path: some receive life within the womb, others take form within the egg; some dwell in burrows, others nest in trees, hide in forests, or conceal themselves among rocks. Some are born in rivers, lakes, and marshes; others are nurtured in deep abysses and accumulated waters. Some arise from qi, others transform with the elements. Their names are manifold, their forms myriad—flying and walking through mountain valleys, sinking and floating upon waves. Though their endowment of qi differs, their instinct to cling to life is fundamentally the same. Some are ensnared by hooks, nets, and traps; others are wounded by blades, arrows, and bows. Naturally, they seek benefit and avoid harm, yet at worst, they drown in flesh and force themselves to feed. Dull and dim, they live; scattered and disordered, they perish. Though they are of different kinds, all emerge from the molding of the supreme transformation. Having shamefully indulged in desire, they all fall within the number of those pitied by the Celestial Thearch.

We humbly pray that all may partake in the pure offerings, together attend the virtuous gathering, be cleansed by the sacred fluid, and forever forsake the realm of birds and beasts. Bathed in the dharma rain, may they ultimately depart from the company of fur and horn. Awakening to their origin and knowing their root, may they return to the source and restore their nature.

The multitudes of the Four Births Path, along with all their kin, are each summoned to come.

Next, the summoning of the lonely souls.

We humbly observe that as the primordial unity cycles without cease, the two forces congeal and transformations know no end. Receiving qi and dividing spirit, the myriad forms begin. With diverse endowments and varied natures, the multitude of beings flourishes.

Yet what begins must end. Where there is birth, there is death. Though distant ages shift and affairs change, the principle of life and death remains constant, the sentiment unchanged. Though noble and base differ, worthy and foolish each attain their lot. Life’s span is unpredictable—long or short, unknown. Death’s fate is uncertain—ascension or descent, unknowable.

Moreover, the age of simplicity has gradually faded, the era of primordial vastness long passed. Prosperity and decline alternate, rise and fall follow one another. The abdicating rulers of Yao and Shun are unmatched; the warring states of Shang and Zhou share a common fate. By the end of Zhou, weapons and armor proliferated; at the dawn of Qin, strife and turmoil raged. From the Han and Wei onward, north and south repeatedly divided, rising and falling in turn, now ordered, now chaotic. Customs waxed and waned, people flourished and declined accordingly. Some lost their integrity and were cast out in enlightened times; others upheld loyalty yet found no place in turbulent ages. Some achieved merit only to invite disaster; others reached the height of power yet faced mortal peril. Thus, wielding authority beyond the palace gates, bearing commands beyond the borders, some perished in battle by chance, others met their end in distant lands. Some, though skilled and talented, wandered unrecognized; others, though steadfast in principle, were cast aside in despair. Traveling as strangers, they encountered chaos and separation; serving in the military, they died by blade and arrow. Such cases are not rare in recent times, and even more numerous in the past.

And consider the scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, shamans, physicians, and minor ritualists—thousands of callings, myriad categories, the countless streams of a hundred schools. In their time in the world, glory and decay were never equal. After their bodies perished, how different were they in the silent darkness? Some arts promised longevity, yet those who attained it were few. Without foresight, how could one evade death? Inevitably, it was seen as commonplace. Wise and foolish alike crumbled into tomb dust; rich and noble became guests beneath the springs. Reflecting on this, how endless the sorrow that arises.

Reverently contemplating the boundless compassion of the Great Dao, it specially revealed the true precepts to broadly deliver all beings. Thus, consulting the sacred canons, altars were solemnly arrayed. Unobstructed feasts were laid out, universally offering sustenance to all sentient beings. The edict of the Nine Dragons was invoked to descend, reviving the sunken souls of the six realms.

We pray that the true spirits of the unseen and manifest, the lords of yin and yang, the ritual altars in every place, the city gods of the world’s commanderies and towns, the Elder of the Yellow Springs and the Hao Li, the masters of the netherworld’s dark depths, the bureaus of the water palaces, the offices of the mountain courts, the great deities of the Five Paths, the community lords of the Nine Provinces, the spirits of mountains, forests, villages, and domains, and all local deities—may they all obey the talismans of the Most High, jointly receiving the special mandate of the Azure Palace. May they release the bound from the ten thousand prisons, end the banishment and servitude of the Three Ways. May they dredge and free the imprisoned souls, elevate and transfer the guilty shades, even those wandering the wilds, mired in dark yin, with masters or without, harboring feelings and consciousness—all beings of the Nine Provinces and Six Extremes, the myriad kinds of the Four Births, every lonely soul, the endless ghostly realms—may they all be gathered and summoned to arrive, equally partaking in the sublime and wondrous connection, immediately crossing into the realm of purity and peace. May they all rely on the power of the supreme spirits to magnify the grace of the August Emperor. When the summons is issued at the appointed time, may swift response be entreated.

With this offering of incense, we first reverently invite the emperors and sovereigns of past dynasties, the former rulers of bygone eras. Some gained the realm through yielding virtue, others laid foundations through expansion; some bestowed lasting benefits and eradicated harm, their merits enduring for ten thousand generations, while others restored order from chaos, establishing fleeting yet monumental legacies. Their grace extended across the seas and lands, their virtue embraced all living beings. Some still receive offerings in human temples, others have ascended as spirits to the celestial palaces, yet all retain their love for the people and compassion for all creatures. May they guide the lost, uplift future generations, turn their sagacious gaze downward, and heed the sincerity of mortals.

This includes the heirs who maintained the throne and the rulers who preserved its legacy, governing with policies of stability and inheriting foundations of great peace. Through successive reigns and flourishing eras, they brought prosperity and safeguarded the mandate. Yet after generations, even the most prosperous eras may decline, and fortune’s cycles may bring unforeseen changes. The royal authority may falter, the sword of state may be inverted; treacherous ministers may seize power, or barbarian hordes may bring invasion and plunder. In minor cases, capitals may be relocated; in grave ones, nations may fall. Though virtue may have waned, fate too has its limits. Once, the imperial carriage vanished into the distant wilds; now, the palace halls lie in ruins. If their noble spirits have not yet ascended to the vermilion heavens, we fear their sacred presence still lingers in the yellow earth. We humbly beseech them to momentarily divert their retinue, glance upon this altar, and witness this rite of liberation. May they deeply comprehend the mysteries of the subtle and profound, recognizing that wealth and honor are but dreams, success and failure alike are emptiness. The past cannot be reclaimed, but the future may yet be pursued. We implore their celestial mercy to descend and grace us with their presence.

With this offering of incense, we invite the consorts and courtiers of former courts, the ladies of ancient inner palaces—from the exalted empresses to the attendant concubines. Some graced the rear gardens with their renown, others upheld the virtue of the earthly realm. Outwardly, they aided sagacious rule; inwardly, they maintained proper decorum. Though eras have changed, their compassion and love endure. We hope their spirits in heaven will look down and perceive the sincerity of our prayers. Some enjoyed profound favor, others faced the ebb and flow of fortune; though they dwelled in golden chambers and jade towers, these became desolate as the Long Gate Palace. Their secluded halls now echo with sorrow. Some lie buried in distant tombs, their return uncertain; others met sudden misfortune at Mawei. Some departed within the vermilion gates, others grew old in the Shangyang Palace. Lingering regrets remain unfulfilled, their pure souls without refuge. We humbly beseech their discernment and entreat their descent. May they recognize that wealth and honor are fleeting as blossoms, glory as brief as a spark. Let them proceed forward without clinging to past footsteps.

With this offering of incense, we invite the prime ministers and court officials of successive dynasties, the pillars of state through the ages. Endowed with the timber of great beams, they displayed the skill of governing hands. Within, they maintained measured stability; without, they pacified the four directions. Some drafted edicts in the western chambers, others composed decrees at the northern gate; some were entrusted with the governance of prefectures, others ranked among the assembly of officials. They aided the workings of transformation and upheld the nation’s plans. Great or small, civil or martial, they averted disasters before they arose and brought great peace where none was visible. Yet when their allotted time ended, their bodies returned to the dust of the world. Some still receive offerings among mortals, others serve in the courts of immortals. We humbly pray they will momentarily divert their retinues and descend with their banners. May they witness this mortal sincerity and bestow upon us abundant blessings. For some, high rank did not endure; honors and emoluments were easily lost. Some fell into disgrace and exile, never to return; others faced ruin, their families destroyed, or even suffered punishment through poison. Endless grievances linger, their startled souls without refuge. Let them know that past footsteps cannot be retraced, nor overturned carts restored. They need not dwell on old grievances but may yet plan for the future. By heeding the rites of purity and emptiness, may all pent-up emotions be dissolved. We universally hope for their arrival and immediate assent to attend.

With this offering of incense, we invite the heroes and generals of ages past, the marshals and commanders through the dynasties. They ascended the altar to receive their commissions, were enfeoffed and rewarded for merit. Some subdued the Tianshan with three arrows, others captured the southern barbarians with seven stratagems; some quelled rebellions, others restored order to the realm. Their splendid deeds aided their times, their loyal devotion pierced the sun. Some perished in service to the throne, others retired in old age; some suffered harm for upholding righteousness, others lost their lives in distant lands. Yet their integrity remained unblemished—what harm is there in principle? Some were never enfeoffed in life, others now receive offerings in temples after death. We humbly pray they will momentarily raise their banners and descend to this altar, partaking in our sincere offerings and bestowing their divine protection. Some faced precarious circumstances, their merits unrecognized; others erred in loyalty or incurred suspicion. Unforeseen disasters arose, changes emerged from form. Some died in exile, others were executed; some saw their families ruined, others their descendants wither. The misty clouds of battle have faded, their grand ambitions of old now gone. In the depths of the night’s abyss, their lingering consciousness remains deluded. We hope they will respond to the summons and arrive, awakening in accord with the moment. Freed from past hindrances, may all be cleansed and renewed.

With this offering of incense, we summon the soldiers and ranks of military camps, the marching armies through the ages. Within the six directions, the rise and fall of dynasties are beyond count, the battles and conflicts beyond reckoning. Whether bandits and thieves raged within the cities or barbarian hordes defiled the land, wars were waged out of necessity, yet lives were inevitably lost. Bodies perished by bow and spear, blood and flesh stained the wild grasses. Some were defeated in sieges, others ambushed and routed; some were left unsupported in distant campaigns, others lured into poisoned traps. The victorious could not emerge unscathed, the defeated were surely annihilated. Cities and towns were left desolate, the living suffered slaughter. Though fate may have ordained it, the sorrow of humanity is profound. Yet they strove with righteousness to serve, and died with loyalty to their duty.

Should they not return to the world of the living, they remain bound as servants to the nether bureaus. We humbly pray that you briefly halt your writ at the sacred altar, jointly aiding the primordial transformation. May all alike partake in its blessings and protection, swiftly attaining ascension.

Among them, some may have lacked loyalty and sincerity, or faltered in doubt; some collapsed before battle was joined, or surrendered when no crisis pressed; some were executed for violating discipline, or punished for deserting their ranks. Fearing that a single misguided thought might yet bind them to the nine depths, we trust that with the decree now issued, all fetters shall be loosed. Let them repent and redress past faults, cleanse and wash away former transgressions, each receiving the great amnesty’s grace, fully escaping the ninefold abyss of suffering. We earnestly invite them to come forth and together partake in meritorious deeds.

With this burning of incense, we summon the refined scholars of the examination halls, the learned Confucians of the sea of letters—those who mastered the books of a hundred schools, plumbed the depths of the Six Classics, whose reputations soared in the academies, whose conduct and righteousness crowned their villages. Some rose to towering rank, their names topping the lists of many scholars, knowing that prominence stems from fate, and thus followed the times in action or retreat. Others never tasted the honors of office and emolument, yet fully grasped the principles of nature and destiny. Unbound by gain or loss, unobstructed by life or death, their heroic souls endure through the ages, their numinous spirits pervade the ten thousand directions. We humbly pray that you deign to descend to this altar, swiftly arriving by chariot. Those who achieved renown in the land of Hua Xu now know the awakening from dream; those who inscribed records in the White Jade Tower have already ascended as immortals.

Yet some, though ardent in aspiration, were thwarted by fate; though learned, remained blind to the ultimate truth. Their soaring ambitions faltered, their dazzling rhetoric dissolved into languor. Repeatedly thwarted in the examination halls, the gates of rank ever distant, their last breath expired, all ties severed. We fear they have yet to grasp the distinction between poverty and success, or fathom the workings of fortune and misfortune. In life, they served the pure and unwavering; in death, their souls may linger in the curves of the Yellow Springs. We humbly pray that they cast off attachments, awaken their spirits, and recognize that the true precepts of the Most High are none other than the great Dao of the sages. They should set aside cunning and worldly concerns, savor the Dao and virtue, and comprehend life and death. Once they fully attend this dharma assembly, they shall immediately transcend to the realm of purity.

With this burning of incense, we summon the true priests of jade shrines and feathered transcendents, the yellow-crowned dwellers of jasper halls—those who renounced the dust of the world to leave home, delighting in emptiness to enter the Dao. Deeply awakened to the dreamlike illusions of floating life, they gazed upward to explore the ultimate truth’s subtlety. At white tablets and yellow altars, they communed with the numinous; amidst green mountains and emerald waters, they roamed freely with staff and sandals. Some, for their lofty merits, were summoned to the Dark Capital; others, their elixirs perfected, received scriptures from grotto palaces. We humbly pray that you especially pity these late learners, graciously descending in flying chariots to enlighten the sunken souls of the hidden depths, guiding them toward the virtuous fruits of this offering.

Yet some, though blessed with scant karmic roots, labored in vain with good intentions. Their studies never met a true master, their inner refinement lacked secret methods; some abandoned their practice midway, others faced obstacles arising unbidden. Phoenixes and cranes never came, leaving only vain hopes for the azure heavens; tigers and dragons proved elusive, consigning them to the black soil’s embrace. Now, with this summons of the decree, they arrive at this assembly of merit and deliverance. Let them not be entangled by old attachments, but swiftly purify their spiritual roots. Once they fully grasp the mysterious mechanism, they shall ascend to the registers of immortality.

With this burning of incense, we summon the recluses of mountains and forests, the secluded dwellers of cliffs and valleys—those who regarded wealth and honor as floating clouds, equated merit and fame with external things. Amidst emerald peaks and verdant cliffs, beneath full moons and misty vapors, they wandered in wooden clogs and green bamboo staves, delighting in springs and rocks, befriending neither princes nor kings, refusing to serve even emperors. Some concealed their traces in suburban gardens, others roamed freely by lakes and seas. Their lofty bearing surpassed the common, their pure qi overawed others. In life, they already transcended the crowd; in death, they should naturally remain unobstructed. As apes cried in the stillness of night, they lamented the fading of orchid sashes; as cranes mourned in empty mountains, they sighed for the desolation of orchid curtains. Their spirits untrammeled, we earnestly invite them to descend. May they together partake in the pure offering and bestow their presence.

Yet some, though dwelling in reclusion, yearned for merit and fame. Some provoked the *North Mountain’s Reproach*, others used seclusion as a shortcut to officialdom. Unable to uphold their noble integrity, they reverted to worldly entanglements. Their aspirations unfulfilled in life, their regrets may deepen in the netherworld. They should know that advance and retreat are matters of life’s planning, while cherishing these achievements is also a strategy for navigating the world. Once cold and lifeless, they have relinquished the world. Nobility and baseness both vanish, success and failure alike forgotten. Receiving this transformative grace, may they swiftly attain the joy of rebirth.

With this burning of incense, we summon the great virtuous ones of the monastic groves, the eminent monks of the ranked monasteries—those who wielded the blade of wisdom to sever afflictions and obstructions. In square robes and round crowns, they awakened to the emptiness that is not empty; with hearts of iron and bowels of stone, they cultivated the fruit that is hard to cultivate. Breaking through the principle of non-birth, they preserved the mechanism of not dying. Their single nature, pure and numinous, though long in duration, never fell; their six senses utterly extinguished, they respond to summons from afar. Having shattered all barriers, why should they be confined to Dao or Buddha? Swiftly descending with staff and tin, they deign to alight upon this altar. Witnessing this good cause, may they partake in the offerings.

Yet some, their Chan hearts not yet stilled, their awakened nature still deluded, the five aggregates not empty, the six thieves still raging, drifted with the times or mingled with the world, floating and sinking in the mundane. When their allotted span ended, they did not realize their corporeal forms had forever ceased. In the vast, dim netherworld, the distant, shadowy Yellow Springs, when might they attain liberation? Now, with this path of ascent open, let past wrongs and present rights alike be cleansed by boundless grace. Forsaking the old for the new, they shall ascend to the shore of purity and emptiness.

With this incense now kindled, we summon the female Daoist adepts of palaces and abbeys, the nuns of temples and convents—
some awakened to truth and entered the Dao, some left the world for circumstance;
some embraced the Western Paradise’s stillness and extinction, some revered the Supreme’s serene and empty teaching.
Black robes and plain forms have shed the dust of rouge and powder;
feathered sleeves and starry crowns remain unstained by leaden adornment.
Their Chan hearts, still as water, return to the Buddha-nature’s perfect clarity;
their pure qi, lighter than floating clouds, shall at last witness the transcendent traces of immortals ascending.
We humbly pray they deign to heed this earnest plea, sparing not their compassion.
Witnessing this devotion, may they accept these offerings.
Yet some, though their Dao-bound karmic ties remain shallow, their past blessings yet unprofound,
though clad in the garb of worldly renunciation, have not fully shed the thoughts and cares of the dust.
Some weary in their accumulation of merit, some fail to see their true nature clearly.
They know only the world’s endless entanglements, unaware of the great term’s approach.
Pondering the silence of the dark netherworld, fearing the chill of wandering spirits,
through this act of reverence, we beseech them all to come forth.
May they be doubly blessed by sacred grace, their lives renewed.
With this incense now kindled, we summon the generations of the wealthy and powerful, the long-established noble houses—
heirs to ancestral halls, inheritors of refined lineage.
Treasuries overflow, chests and coffers brim;
spacious mansions and lofty halls pass through seasons unnoticed.
Grand carriages and towering canopies shield them from wind and sun.
Their eyes grow weary of pearls and jades, their attire scorns the finest silks.
If they could but govern themselves and nurture others, they might yet begin well and end nobly.
Yet even they must pass through the Great Yin, though born again in privilege.
Some, swept away by excess, grow ever more extravagant—
indulging endlessly in music and beauty, amassing horses and chariots to their whim.
In life, they followed every desire; in death, they fear their souls will wander lost.
We humbly pray they forsake worldly glory, cast aside past attachments,
turn their carriages toward this altar, and arrive as one.
May they awaken to the numinous, attaining together the realm of goodness.
With this incense now kindled, we summon the scholars of the nine schools, the masters of diverse arts—
some versed in the trigrams and divination, some learned in astronomy and geography;
some who discern fortune and misfortune through the five phases, some who read fate in a single visage;
some skilled in astrology and qi observation, some who heal the sick with life-saving hands.
If one art reaches its deepest mystery, or many virtues perish together,
then neither success nor failure can obscure their truth, nor life nor death burden their nature.
For arts reveal the changes of things, while principle penetrates the workings of creation.
In life, they are keen; in death, they are enlightened.
Neither existence nor extinction confounds them; neither concealment nor revelation binds them.
We look up to their radiant spirits, praying they witness this earnest devotion.
Yet some, though their names match their arts, their practice remains shallow;
their skills meager, their knowledge base.
They peddle their crafts for profit, or wander seeking patronage,
drifting from place to place, lingering in foreign lands—
some dying as strangers, some perishing on the road.
For their understanding of truth was dim, and they feared their souls would linger after death.
We humbly pray they gather their wandering consciousness, unite their scattered spirits.
May they arrive at this pure altar, awaken to the Dao’s wonders,
renounce their former natures, and together ascend to the land of the living.
With this incense now kindled, we summon the cloud-roaming sages, the enlightened friends of rivers and lakes—
with single gourd and straw hat, they wander sacred lands and famed mountains;
their five qi and three essences silently gather at Kunlun’s peaks and Penglai’s summits.
Some refine metals and minerals with precision, some heal ailments with herbs and roots;
some wield talismans to aid the times, some emit qi to cure afflictions;
some feign madness to blend with the world, some feign drunkenness to preserve truth;
some face the wall in non-action, some practice deeds with purpose.
When their elixir is complete and their work done, they shed their shells and ascend as spirits.
We humbly pray they uplift the mysterious gate, uphold the great teaching,
graciously accept these offerings, and together deliver the lost.
We await their cloud-borne chariots, that they may descend to this dharma seat.
Yet some have wandered mountains and rivers in vain, never meeting a teacher beyond the world;
though their practices are many, they lack the secret to true attainment.
They linger in their bodies, wasting years in emptiness—
in life, drifting with the crowd; in death, their spirits scattered.
We beseech them to turn their pure thoughts, swiftly escape the dark paths,
form this unobstructed bond, and once more find the joy of rebirth.
With this incense now kindled, we summon the wandering youths of streets and markets—
parading in carriages with canopies, traversing the ornate lanes of pleasure;
hunting with hawks and slings, stirring the red dust of imperial gardens.
They cage rare birds, pour jade cups of wine;
by silver candlelight, they curse the brevity of the night at dice;
to the tune of jade flutes, they dread the feast’s end.
Though their hearts delight in youth, their deeds may lack virtue.
When frost touches their temples, they startle at time’s passage—
vainly recalling the traces of past romances, already feeling age’s press.
Their acquaintances fill their eyes, yet none plan for their earthly stay;
their affections overflow, yet these are the roots of life’s undoing.
Only the silence of the tomb awaits, and the vast, dim road of the underworld looms.
We humbly pray they forsake the old for the new, return to their roots and restore their mandate,
come to receive these blessings, and ascend in due course.
Let them not cling to illusions like empty flowers, nor fix their hearts on external things.
May they cast off all former ways, hasten toward the path ahead.
With this incense now kindled, we summon the fishermen on the rivers, the anglers by the streams—
casting nets and lines, they’ve known countless autumn moons and spring winds;
drifting homes on floating boats, they’ve sailed through clouds, waves, snow, and swells.
With lines a thousand feet long, they plumb the depths of the Five Lakes;
in the misty waters, they wander at leisure.
Before Xisai Mountain, they watch the white gulls dot the sky;
on Fuchun’s shoals, they embrace the layered emerald peaks.
Beyond the world’s traces, they often meet kindred spirits.

Some have delved deep in the perfect Dao,
some have silently awakened to the true mechanism.
Standing alone in their excellence, transcending all without extinction.

We humbly pray that you briefly depart your immortal courts,
descend for a time to the dusty world,
to guide the hidden souls together,
and specially fulfill this ritual offering.

There are those who toil ceaselessly with nets and traps,
who exhaust themselves with hooks and lines—
not for love of mountain streams’ purity,
but merely to sustain body and mouth.
Their labor has reached its limit; is it not time to pause?

The two luminaries hasten each other,
a hundred years pass in an instant.
Life’s span is finite,
and all must meet their end.
Short oars and long poles can no longer be tended;
wind-blown hats and rain-soaked caps—
alas, their traces remain empty.
The graves by the shore stand silent,
while the boat’s occupants have gone.

We humbly pray they cast off old habits,
release past attachments,
emerge from hidden retreats,
and specially attend this ritual.
At the first hearing of the wondrous Dao,
may all awaken to the realm of life.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the tillers of the soil, the farmers and silkworm-tenders—
foremost among the four labors,
pillars of all governance.
They bear plows and shoulder hoes,
enduring cold and heat without respite.
Their bodies caked in mud, their feet drenched in mire,
they toil ceaselessly through wind and sun.
They know the hardship of feeding above and nurturing below,
yet even in good years, barely sustain themselves.
They long for autumn’s harvest,
but in famine, suffer deeply.
Some grow old and meet a peaceful end;
others perish in hunger and want.
Some leave scattered bones,
others rest in lonely graves.
Amid the desolate wilderness, where do their souls find refuge?
In the quiet of the seasons, who offers them sacrifice?

We pray they gather and come forth,
that we may lead them together.
May they see through the illusions of this floating life,
and not sink into the depths of ghostly delusion.
By this good affinity,
may they ascend to the immortal realms.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
those who trade on rivers and roads,
who peddle goods across lakes and seas—
drowning in worldly entanglements,
rushing to the paths of commerce.
They drive grand carriages,
chasing endless journeys.
They hoist sails and turn rudders,
adrift on boundless waves.
Many become tumbleweeds in foreign lands,
or sojourners in distant places.
Some fortunately amass wealth,
while others languish in life’s desolate snares.
Some fall ill in distant lands,
others perish in lonely inns.
Some grow old yet never cease,
others die young.
Some lose all to bandits,
others drown in shipwrecks.
They grieve for bones that cannot return,
and mourn souls too far to call.

We humbly pray they come to hear the true teaching,
and together ascend the Dao’s shore.
Wealth and goods are but things beyond the body,
unable to follow the soul into the underworld.
Hometowns are but dwellings in this world—
do not cling to them in life.
With resolute abandonment,
they shall surely ascend.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the performers and musicians,
the wandering entertainers and singers.
Their words are witty and playful,
their arts refined in strings and winds.
They weave through dance troupes and song circles—
is this truly their nature?
Or are they driven by circumstance,
chasing horse tracks and carriage dust?
Seeking warmth and sustenance,
they endure endless welcomes and farewells.
Yet they gather like floating clouds,
scatter like flowing water.
As years pass, few remain to rely upon.
When their allotted time ends,
they fear becoming companions without refuge.

We humbly pray they remain unstained by worldly ties,
forget all former thoughts,
and come together in attendance.
May they receive guidance and transcendence.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the street performers and market artisans,
masters of diverse skills from north and south.
Some train birds and insects,
others store and sell flowers and fruits.
Some carve wood and pull strings to make puppets dance,
others conjure smoke and flames for dazzling displays.
Some walk tightropes with agility,
others twirl blades in midair.
Some wrestle to prove strength,
others mimic shadows and candlelight in graceful motion.
Their kind is many,
and modern skills ever more numerous.
Yet all seek warmth and sustenance—
a common human desire.
But their lives on the road are inescapable.
Not all delight in this path,
but fear no better plan.
Time slips by in vain,
years pass without foundation.
In life, their gatherings are uncertain;
in death, they fear drifting without return.

We humbly pray they abandon false ties,
awaken to this truth,
hear the scriptures and the Dharma,
illuminate their nature and mind.
Bathed in the mysterious stream,
they shall surely be born in the Land of Bliss.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the officials and clerks of past and present,
who wield brush and ink,
assisting prefectures and counties in governance,
upholding laws and decrees,
aiding the sagely court’s civilizing mission.
Some act with wisdom to do good,
others accumulate hidden merit through humble service.
Their families prosper, their descendants flourish,
and though their bodies perish, their souls do not fall.

We humbly pray they witness this ritual,
serve as witnesses together,
cleanse their spirits,
and increase their good deeds.

Yet some crave wealth and take bribes,
abuse power for personal gain.
They bully the weak, oppress the strong,
mock laws to spread harm.
Some cheat in measures,
others harm the times and creatures.
Disaster strikes in an instant—
exile to distant lands,
lives lost,
families ruined.
Though punished in this life,
their hidden transgressions may yet remain.
By this Dao’s grace,
may all past sins be forgiven.

We humbly pray they all come to this sacred ground,
share in this offering,
turn sincerely to the heavenly court,
repent past wrongs.
May they transcend the gates of hell,
seek the path to rebirth.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the butchers and cooks,
those who slaughter for a living.
Some stab sheep and pierce pigs,
others butcher dogs and carve oxen.
Some roast and broil for fine flavors,
others raise livestock for fresh delicacies.
This brings honor to their persons and mouths,
securing clothing and food.
Though such work is hard to avoid in this world,
it is not the wisest choice.
Not that they intend to kill excessively,
but their compassion may yet fade entirely.

As their lives suddenly end,
some may yet remain entangled.
We humbly pray they wash clean their old hearts,
awaken kind thoughts,
partake in this pure offering,
and swiftly return to human bonds.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
those who abstain from meat,
the vegetarian followers.
Some transmit the teachings of the Two Schools,
others proclaim the Four Fruits’ doctrine.
Some claim allegiance to the White Buddha’s Dharma,
others style themselves as Vajra Chan.
Some follow the masters of the Two Meetings,
others chant the melodies of the Five Comings.
Some gather men and women indiscriminately,
others forsake ancestral rites.
Some dazzle with heterodox arts as merit,
others burn frankincense as ritual.
By day they scatter their traces,
by night they assemble their followers.
Some adopt the name of Śākya’s teaching,
others invoke Daoist precepts to mask deceit.
Outwardly they feign miracles,
inwardly they serve demonic forces.
All people are born with a good heart,
yet as their nature drifts, they turn to heretical teachings.
The common person’s nature may rise or fall—
groundless doctrines bewilder and multiply.
Once trapped in such shame, escape is barred;
once life is lost, though they repent, what use?
To abstain from meat and forswear wine
is indeed a foundation of goodness.
Yet to rebel against the Dao and abandon kin
is to reap evil fruit.
We humbly pray they sever their deceptions,
dispel their foolish delusions,
greatly awaken the will to goodness,
and never indulge in wayward curiosity.
Within heaven and earth, right principle endures;
between humans and ghosts, the true nature never perishes.
Attending this pure and sincere gathering,
they bathe in this cleansing breeze.
Why pursue what is difficult?
To practice what is fitting is itself enlightenment.
With uprightness in all actions,
transcendence may be attained.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
women who died in childbirth,
children lost in the womb.
Some suffered from carrying a fetus,
ultimately perishing.
Others endured hardship in bearing a child,
finally losing their lives.
Some died undelivered, mother and child as one,
others perished before their blood stilled.
In common feeling, this is already shocking;
for the dead souls, it must breed confusion.
We humbly pray they return to their original nature,
awaken to their heavenly truth.
Let them know that the body forms from impure filth,
while the pure and empty mind receives its nature.
The single spirit transcends past and present, never fading;
the myriad impurities vanish with dust and grime.
Why cling to death in childbirth or loss in the womb?
They too receive the refining of yin and yang,
dissolving all obstacles,
proceeding to rebirth and completion.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
the bandits and plunderers,
the raiders and thieves.
Some are driven by hunger and cold,
others by famine and scarcity.
In great crimes, they beat oxen and rob graves;
in lesser ones, they tunnel through walls and scale fences.
Villages grow uneasy,
prefectures and counties move to arrest them.
Some face execution,
others exile and banishment.
Some perish in prison cells,
others die on the road.
Some lie as exposed bones,
others as shattered corpses.
Not that their natures are all thus,
but that their habits compel them.
Born to misfortune,
where do they go in death?
By this boundless grace,
may they repent their lingering evils,
swiftly transcend the苦 realms,
and soon depart the dark lands.

With this incense now kindled, we summon
those condemned to punishment,
the souls of the legally executed.
Some were dismembered and carved apart,
others beheaded or mutilated.
Some died under heavy flogging,
others perished in long confinement.
Some were exiled to distant frontiers,
others executed in public squares.
Some paid with their lives for killing,
others met death for lawless acts.
To suffer such extreme punishment—
was this not their destined fate?
Yet since their cases are closed in the courts of men,
may they find pardon in the courts of the unseen.
By this Dao’s grace,
they must return to their original nature.
Let them know that though the five limbs may break,
the single spirit remains unharmed.
Repenting past wrongs,
they receive this great forgiveness.
Amending their ways without relapse,
seeking deliverance, they may ascend.
No need to glance back at the old dwelling;
turn your thoughts to the new sprout.
Once freed from the six heavens and nine earths,
never forget the Three Bonds and Five Constants.
As ghosts or as humans,
uphold propriety and the law,
forever leave the evil paths,
and board the ferry of compassion.

Thus we summon the multitudes of the Three Ways,
the souls of all kinds—
those with consciousness and feeling,
those with no refuge, no support.
Their stories cannot all be told,
their voices cannot be fully recounted.
Boundless and endless,
numberless and limitless,
neither far nor near,
nameless and without form.
Some died of old age,
others met violent ends.
Some perished from consumption,
others from plague.
Some fell from horses or overturned carriages,
others drowned in rivers or plunged into waters.
Some took their own lives,
others hanged or mutilated themselves.
Some tumbled into ravines or off cliffs,
others sank into ditches or fell into wells.
Some died from poison,
others from venom.
Some perished in their hometowns,
others on the road.
Some passed in old age,
others died young.
Some were devoured by tigers or bitten by snakes,
others struck by thunder or lightning.
Some were cut by blades,
others pierced by arrows and spears.
Some were common folk,
others artisans and craftsmen.
Some were officials or clerks,
others wise or foolish.
Some were rich and noble,
others poor and lowly.
Some were orphaned or widowed,
others male or female.
Some had no means,
others had households and property.
Some were servants or slaves,
others left destitute and alone.
Some suffered deafness or blindness,
others dumbness or muteness.
Some were afflicted with spinal ailments,
others missing limbs.
Some dashed about in youth,
others wandered in their prime.
Some left no descendants,
others had children and grandchildren.
Some were cremated,
others buried in tombs.
Some wander the wilds,
others linger in ruins.
Some are bound in the prisons of the earth,
others in the palaces of mountains and waters.
Some are detained by city gods and earth spirits,
others sunk in the Yellow Springs of the netherworld.
Some bear grudges,
others harbor resentment.
Some have already settled their accounts,
others await karmic retribution.
Some are driven by lightning or thunder,
others bear sand and carry stones.
Some are trapped in endless night,
others drown in boundless waves.
Some have not yet ascended,
others have not yet crossed over.
Some sank in past kalpas,
others perished in recent times.
Some are spirits of earth and stone,
others ghosts of mountains and forests.
Some are demons lurking in hidden places,
others specters drifting in the indistinct.

All hidden spirits and boundless ghostly souls,
may you all hasten here and now arrive.
Fortunate that you are not bound by rank,
summoned together in compassion’s embrace.
Let none exalt themselves in pride,
nor harbor resentment or grievance.
Refrain from strife, avoid clamor,
calm your thoughts, compose your spirits.
Seize this auspicious cause,
and meet with kindness.

Proceed to the ritual chamber,
first entering the bathing canopy.
The assembly chants in praise,
leading the way forward.
Invoke the Great Sage, the Yellow-Flowered, Form-Washing Heavenly Worthy,
guiding them to the bathing chamber,
where the rites of ablution are proclaimed.

The High Priest visualizes the bathing chamber transformed,
inviting the descent of vital qi,
to pour into their bodies.

For long have you departed the human world,
dwelling in the dark realms.
Some drift with the Five Turbidities,
others fall into the Three Paths as penal laborers.
Some wander, their spirits unreturned,
others scatter, their souls incomplete.
Having just escaped the gloomy crossroads,
you fear lingering in the shadows of the netherworld.
Without purifying the spirit and cleansing the mind,
how can you approach the Emperor and pay homage to the True?

Thus, a pure space is opened,
the bathing chamber solemnly prepared.
Relying on the wondrous shelter of the High Mystery,
and the divine power of the Great Dao,
this mundane realm is transformed,
all becoming a sacred domain.
In an instant, it encompasses the Six Directions;
in a fleeting moment, it parallels the Two Modes.
All ghostly beings of every kind
are able to bathe and cleanse.
The souls of the Nine Provinces
attain clarity and brightness.
All thoughts are purified,
the Six Dusts become immaculate.
Reverently receiving this gracious blessing,
all are permeated by the Mystic Stream.
Every yin spirit,
calmly proceeds to bathe.

We pray for the lonely souls,
to ascend and be reborn in the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing and Dispelling Filth*:
The heavens’ qi is clear,
the Five Colors resplendent.
Sun and moon radiate their light,
refining the body’s form.
The divine stream washes within,
fragrant waters refine the essence.
Luminous brilliance shines through,
illuminating the Highest Clarity.
Qi does not receive dust,
the Five Palaces receive the numinous.
Sins of the Three Paths diminish,
misfortunes of the Nine Netherworlds dissolve.
The body receives liberation,
ascending to the Emperor’s court.
We pray for the lonely souls,
to ascend and be reborn in the immortal realms.

Recite the *Incantation for Bathing and Refining the True*:
The Supreme High Perfected,
essence of the Nine Numinous.
Let souls fly as immortals,
ascending to the Purple Court.
Bathe in the Flowery Pool,
the divine body becomes pure.
Essence merges with the Great Void,
myriad qi arise of themselves.

We have heard that only water can wash the roots of dust,
and without incantations, past obstructions cannot be dissolved.
Proceed with care and slowness,
that all may be thoroughly cleansed.
Recite the mystic scripture again,
to aid in refinement.

whose merits are complete.
Descending to guide and receive,
the Precious Master accompanies.
Compassionate, bestowing the Dharma-water,
used to wash away ignorance.
Forever delivered from the Three Paths’ shores,
eternally departing the Five Turbidities’ mire.

Now that all dusts are purified and the six desires emptied,
forever departing the realm of dim obscurity,
ascending to the realm of radiant light.
One must recognize the true and return to the origin,
awaken to past transgressions and reflect on faults,
rouse the spirit with solemnity,
and strictly maintain focused contemplation.
Reverently approach the ritual feast,
devoutly draw near the sacred altar,
gazing toward the golden gates of the Mystic Capital,
to pay homage to the Supreme Saints of Jade Capital.
Pray to heaven in ranks,
and present offerings with the power of the Dao.
This is the gateway to returning to goodness,
the path to self-renewal.
One must not be careless or irreverent,
but rather approach with utmost devotion.
The Daoist assembly chants scriptures,
together performing the guiding rites.

**Chanting the Middle Section**
Now, the netherworld’s dark capital
may not yet have been touched by the Dao’s grace.
Sunken souls and stagnant spirits
fear they may never encounter good karmic conditions.
Yet today, by this fortunate encounter,
we may call it an extraordinary and joyous gathering.
Gazing afar toward the Jade Gates,
we bow in homage to the Pure Capital,
reverently facing the ritual altar,
directing our spirits toward the Purple Ultimate.
All present devoutly pay homage,
fulfilling their sincere devotion.
We, with devoted hearts, bow our heads in reverence,
to the **Supreme Boundless Great Dao**.
We, with devoted hearts, bow our heads in reverence,
to the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures**.
We, with devoted hearts, bow our heads in reverence,
to the **Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm**.

Now, in paying homage to the Great Dao,
we respectfully venerate the exalted Perfected.
Having already pledged our sincerity,
we must steadfastly uphold our resolve.
Having known the wondrous origin,
we should recognize the root source.
Do not be deluded by heterodox teachings,
nor casually believe in deviant paths.
Those who have strayed shall return here,
and those who clung to obstinacy shall here find liberation.
With every thought free from deviation,
and every heart aligned with rectitude,
how could the yang realm be difficult to attain?
How could the netherworld still detain them?
Retire to the ritual feast,
where all are gathered to receive sustenance.
Guide the lonely souls to the vast expanse,
and sequentially perform the incantations over the food.
If the food has not yet been consecrated,
then first transfer the assembly of lonely souls,
so that their audience with the Perfected may be complete.
Once the homage toward the gates is concluded,
they shall withdraw to the pure space,
awaiting the offering of ritual provisions.
For this auspicious cause,
we invoke the **Lingbao Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions**,
whose merits are inconceivable.

**Incantation for Consecrating the Food**
Now, the wondrous workings of the true mechanism
can subtly penetrate all.
The divine efficacy of the Supreme Dao
arises from sincere devotion.
Moreover, the ancient precepts are clearly established,
and the great Dharma is expansively manifested.
The Jade Script shines like thunder and clouds,
the Precious Declarations gleam like sun and moon,
transforming in an instant,
responding to devotion in a moment.
Today, the ritual officiant has prepared the ritual feast with purity,
solemnly arranging the offerings,
universally aiding the Five Paths
and the Three Wretched Realms.
Broadly extending to the Nine Netherworlds,
and peripherally benefiting all beings.
Yet without secret incantations,
how could these ordinary offerings be transformed?
Without the power of the Dao,
how could those multitudes of lonely souls be delivered?
Now that all have arrived for the Dharma-food,
we shall perform the incantations to consecrate it.

**The Daoist Assembly Consecrates the Food**
The High Priest holds the True Writ of the Five Paths,
gazing toward the celestial gates to secretly petition the Celestial Emperor.
Next, visualize the true *qi* of each direction
descending to infuse the ritual feast.
For each direction, burn the True Writ,
and from afar, blow the ashes into the air,
visualizing the ritual feast expanding boundlessly,
pervading all realms without limit.
The detailed methods for using the True Writ and visualization
are separately recorded.
We dedicate this to the lonely souls,
to aid their rebirth in the immortal realms.

**Recite the *Jade Clarity Bestowal of Life Invocation*:**
We bow our heads to the **Mysterious Benevolence of the Void and Supreme**,
we bow our heads in devotion to the **Lord of the Profound Mystery**.
You fashion heaven and earth without boasting of virtue,
serving as the refuge for all beings.
Compassionately deliver the souls of the Five Paths’ turning wheel,
mercifully rescue the three souls from hell’s suffering.
We take refuge in the **Celestial Worthy of the Golden Gates**,
we take refuge in the **Father of Compassion and Six Perfections**.
We take refuge in the **Supreme Perfected of Jade Clarity**,
to forever depart from birth and death, eternally enduring.
Emerging from existence and entering the void without reliance,
You transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
An encounter once in a thousand or ten thousand kalpas,
You broadly expound the karmic causes for all.
Reviving the dead and restoring their bones,
You ensure their form and spirit remain unchanging.
We dedicate this to the lonely souls,
to aid their rebirth in the immortal realms.

**On the Dispersed Altar and Offering Rites**

Compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Registrar of the Southern Bureau of the *Dongxuan Lingbao* Masters and Right Adjutant of the Initial Office of the Divine Youth—*Upper Section on Dispersed Altars and Offering Rites*

The ritual methods of the Daoist fasts (*zhai*) originated in the middle antiquity. Between the Jin and Song dynasties, Master Simplicity (Jianji Xiansheng) first distinguished the Three Caverns (*sandong*) and separated the Four Supplements (*sifu*), systematically arranging their regulations and revising the fast rituals. Later, during the Tang, even after Zhang Qingdu’s revisions, they remained incomplete. It was not until Master Broad Accomplishment (Guangcheng Xiansheng) expanded and compiled them that the liturgical canons and ritual standards of the *Huanglu* fasts became resplendently detailed. Posterity has followed them without daring to transgress.

Yet their fundamental purpose declares that the *Huanglu* fasts universally encompass both life and death, uniting the fortunes of humans and heavens. From the common folk below to emperors above, all may cultivate and revere them—such is their boundless merit. However, given the vastness of their volumes, it is impractical to incorporate them entirely into ritual manuals. Those who propagate the teachings should extract and employ the relevant liturgical texts from the complete corpus.

The rites for dispersed altars and offerings (*sanjiao*) are divided into two scrolls in the original canon. To prevent errors in transcription and account for discrepancies between ancient canons and contemporary practices, this section has been compiled separately. The remaining liturgical texts retain their original categories for ease of reference.

**Items Required for the *Huanglu* Fast Rites, Compiled by Master Du Guangcheng:**
- Narrative introductions, consecrated talismans, ritual decorum, altar diagrams, and requisites.
- Petition documents, fast proclamations, altar prohibitions, procedural conduct, and lists of ritual vestments.
- Pre-fast preparations and inaugural invocations.
- On the first day at dawn: the procession of officials and morning audience rites.
- The Great Repentance and the Twenty Directions Repentance.
- The altar ascent and scripture-circling ritual.
- **First Day of the Main Fast:** At midday, the procession and audience rites.
- **Second Day of the Main Fast:** Three periods of procession and audience rites.
- **Third Day of the Main Fast:** Three periods of procession and audience rites.
- Merit proclamations, dispersed altar rites, petition documents, offering rites, and master’s dismissal.
- Lamp offerings, including the Nine Netherworlds Lamp Ritual.
- The Dragon and Jade Disc Offering Ritual.

Additionally, there are:
- The Three Periods of Procession and Audience Rites for the *Huanglu* Fast of Transference and Deliverance.
- The Three-Day *Huanglu* Fast for the Three Primes.
- The Three-Day *Huanglu* Fast for Disaster Dispelling.
- The Three-Day *Huanglu* Fast for House Pacification.
- The Ten Directions Repentance, as well as single-day rites for house pacification, illness alleviation, and the protection of masters and friends.
- The Three-Day *Huanglu* Fast for Universal Deliverance of the Departed, along with various directional repentances, the Five Segments Repentance, the *Huanglu* Fast for the Court’s Protection of Ministers, the *Huanglu* Fast for Ministers’ Disaster Dispelling on Behalf of the State, and the *Zhenwen* Ritual Forms—totaling forty scrolls.

The *Huanglu* fasts govern both the hidden and manifest realms, equally sustaining the living and the dead. Here, the complete *Guangcheng Fast Canon* is transmitted alongside the ritual methods. Those of shared commitment should study and ponder it deeply, thereby recognizing Master Guangcheng’s profound mastery of the ancient scriptures and his devoted efforts in the teaching’s transmission—no trifling achievement.

**On Offerings**
Master Guangcheng states: The *jiao* (offering rite) is another name for sacrifice. Sacrifices involving animal victims and blood offerings are called *ji* (festivals), while those with vegetarian delicacies and refined offerings are called *jiao*—both may summon the perfected and invoke the numinous.

The *Hetu Jingpin* ranks them among the Three Caverns. There are one hundred twenty-four types, akin to fast rituals, along with fifty-six categories of miscellaneous offering rites. All were devised by sages and worthies of past and present in response to karmic conditions. Each can invoke the perfected, pray for blessings, aid beings, benefit humanity, assist royal governance, and nurture all life.

Some rites take the Most High as their principal deity, with the Northern Dipper as their foundational focus. If the offerings are abundant and refined, and the heart sincere with devotion fully expressed, what blessing will not descend, what evil will not be dispelled? Yet if the rites of invitation deviate from proper form, or gestures and postures lose their proper measure, the perfected cannot be summoned to descend.

From this it follows that the Three Caverns include twenty-seven ranks of fasts, and the Three Caverns likewise comprise forty-two grades of *jiao* rites. Yet vulgar and reckless practitioners now conduct *jiao* rites and establish fasts indiscriminately. The Orthodox Unity tradition includes *jiao* rites, sometimes performed after the dispersal of the altar following a fast. But to alter the Orthodox Unity title, change the Orthodox Unity vestments, and then proceed with the *jiao* rite—this is particularly erroneous. For *jiao* rites exist within all Three Caverns. Moreover, the *jiao* rite following altar dispersal marks the conclusion of fast observances, a thanksgiving to the perfected spirits. How can one justify altering titles and vestments to perform it in a separate manner? Such carelessness and novelty-seeking corrupt the ritual canons—how can this be adequately described? This represents the correct principle of past and present, the universal consensus of the world; how can private whims be allowed to disrupt it?

Thus, in recent times, after the dispersal of the altar and the sending off of the masters—when all matters have been concluded—some again invite the perfected and conduct another *jiao* rite, calling it a "special *jiao*" (which may be acceptable), but claiming it fulfills the meaning of a post-fast *jiao* rite entirely misses the original intent. If one follows ancient methods, there is no need to issue a separate *jiao* invitation; before sending off the Six Canopies, one may proceed with the merit-reporting, conduct the *jiao* rite in full, and then send off the masters and clear the altar. The procedure is simple yet coherent, and does not violate the classical ritual forms.

For *jiao* rites, the use of carriages and horses and the like merely serves to express sincerity; it suffices to present a dedicated document for the offering. In ancient times, beyond the submission of memorials, written documents were few. From the Supreme Emperor to the ranked perfected, offerings were made as appropriate, so the positions for *jiao* rites were not numerous. In later ages, written documents, memorials, and petitions multiplied, and wherever such documents were sent, corresponding *jiao* rites of thanksgiving were required.

Here I respectfully set forth the three hundred sixty positions for the Yellow Register Grand Fast’s *jiao* rite of thanksgiving to the perfected spirits:

Here ends Scroll Thirty-Nine of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Dharma*.
Scroll Forty of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Dharma* begins.

The Master of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, the Keeper of the Southern Bureau’s Enforcing Statutes, the Provisional Youth of the Primary Prefecture, the Right Auxiliary Administrator of the Golden Center—compiled under the section *Arrangements for Dispersing Altars and Setting Up Offerings*:

The Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Ranks of the Yellow Register Grand Fast and Offering for Repaying the True Spirits were briefly outlined in the preceding scroll. Their hierarchical order is determined by reference to the *Chart of the Luo Heaven Offering* and the ritual positions promulgated during the Xuanhe reign, cross-referenced and arranged accordingly—not compiled according to secular or private preferences.

The august names and titles of the Perfected Ones are likewise adopted only in accordance with their original sources and the honorifics bestowed by successive courts. For instance, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms and Five Directions, and the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Quarters, all being offices of the utmost consequence within the Numinous Treasure tradition, are thus accorded dedicated positions.

The Five Elder Heavenly Lords appear in the Daoist canons, yet there are also the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, whose identities have varied across ancient and modern discussions. Most commentaries in the Daoist scriptures collectively refer to them as the Five Emperors without distinction, thereby deepening the confusion. In the *Scripture of Salvation*, the Five Elders initiate the path, and the host of immortals flank the imperial chariot. Li Shaowei’s commentary cites the *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct*, stating:

- The Eastern Azure Elder, Primordial Spirit of the Treasure Florescence Verdant Grove, is titled the Azure Emperor, surnamed Yan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang.
- The Southern Vermilion Elder, True Spirit of the Flourishing Treasure Radiant Yang, is titled the Vermilion Emperor, surnamed Dongfu, named Yan, styled Chibiao Nu.
- The Western White Elder, August Spirit of the Seven Treasures Golden Gate, is titled the White Emperor, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopobao.
- The Northern Black Elder, Mysterious Spirit of the Dark Yin Solitary Obscure Fivefold Numinosity, is titled the Black Emperor, surnamed Jie, named Linghui, styled Yinhou Ju.
- The Central Yellow Elder, Primordial Spirit of the Jade Treasure, is titled the Yellow Emperor, surnamed Tongban Yuanshi, styled Hanzhuniu.

Thereafter, the Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures the qi, the Black Emperor circulates the blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transgress their governance.

Yan Dong’s commentary states: the Eastern Azure Emperor Lingwei Yang, the Southern Vermilion Emperor Chibiao Nu, the Western White Emperor Baizhaoju, the Northern Black Emperor Yuguang Ji, and the Central Yellow Emperor Hanzhuniu. Li Shaowei further annotates: these are the Five Elder Supreme Emperors, each receiving the Red Script Mandate. In heaven, they govern the immortals of the Five Directions; on earth, they oversee the Five Sacred Peaks; and within humans, they rule the Five Viscera. Though this interpretation approaches correctness, it fails to elucidate the underlying principle.

Now, according to astronomy, within the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure of the heavens, there are five stars—one at the center, four flanking it—called the Five Emperors’ Thrones, which are the Emperors of the Supreme Subtlety. The *Jin Astronomic Treatise* states: these are the Eastern Azure Emperor Lingwei Yang, the Southern Vermilion Emperor Chibiao Nu, the Western White Emperor Baizhaoju, the Northern Black Emperor Yuguang Ji, and the Central Yellow Emperor Hanzhuniu. Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, there are also five stars known as the Five Emperors’ Inner Thrones. The *Astronomic Treatise* states: these are the five stars where the Emperor resides. Thus, the Eastern Year Star governs spring, corresponds to wood, manifests in human appearance, and embodies benevolence. The Southern Fire Star governs summer, corresponds to fire, manifests in human vision, and embodies propriety. The Western Venus governs autumn, corresponds to metal, manifests in human speech, and embodies righteousness. The Northern Water Star governs winter, corresponds to water, manifests in human hearing, and embodies wisdom. The Central Saturn governs the four seasons, corresponds to earth, manifests in human thought, and embodies trust.

Confucian texts limit their discussion to what is observable in astronomy, whereas Daoist canons include the Five Elder Supreme Emperors and further assign them surnames and personal names. However, the Five Elder Supreme Emperors are identified in Daoist canons as the five deities Lingwei Yang and others, while in astronomical texts, the Five Emperors’ Thrones are also attributed to Lingwei Yang and the same five deities. Such proliferation of names has yet to attain coherence in principle. If Confucian and Daoist texts were harmonized in accordance with principle, then the Five Elder Supreme Emperors would be the root and origin of the Five Qi and the fundamental beginning of the Five Phases.

As manifested in astronomy, they become the Five Stars or the Five Emperors’ Thrones. Once heaven and earth separate, they condense into tangible forms, becoming the Five Sacred Peaks. Having formed as mountains, they must have spirits to govern them, hence the Emperors of the Five Sacred Peaks. As the year progresses and the four seasons are established, the spirits governing their commands are the Five Emperors. Extending downward to the elements, they become metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; in affairs, they are the Five Emperors; and in humans, they are the Five Viscera—all being this same Five Qi, though their manifestations differ. One must not rigidly adhere to names and conflate them into one.

In Lin Shichen’s *Jade Register*, the Emperors of the Five Sacred Peaks are equated with the Heavenly Emperors. When submitting memorials, one declares oneself a subject unified with heaven and earth, implying that the Five Qi share a common source. The intent is to regard the Five Sacred Peaks as the Five Heavenly Emperors, treating them as equivalent. Lin Shichen was a scholar of lofty attainment, yet his perspective was somewhat partial. The Five Elders are the root of the Five Qi, the gateway of the wondrous existence and wondrous non-existence within the heavens, sharing the same body as the Heavenly Worthy. When they become the sovereigns of mountains, they are merely called the Peak Spirits. If they were the same five deities, then in heaven they could be called the Five Elders, and on mountains the Five Sacred Peaks—this would be acceptable.

Moreover, from humankind to the myriad beings, none do not receive the primordial ancestral qi of the Originator. This single qi is divided to ascend in nature and receive numinosity. Yet it would be incorrect to equate humans directly with the Originator Heavenly Worthy. The inception of the Five Emperors shares a single source, but the manifestations of the Five Qi differ in their functions. Therefore, in the ritual protocols for approaching the altar, one visualizes the divine soldiers and multitudes of the Five Sacred Peaks and Five Emperors, as well as the divine soldiers and multitudes of the Five Directions and Five Emperors.

If the Five Elderly Lords of Heaven were indeed deities who command troops and horses, then in the ritual altars they would only be referred to as the Five Emperors’ encampments. The ancients did not call them the Five Elders’ encampments, for recording merits and demerits, examining sins and blessings, is not the duty of the Five Elders in the celestial realm. Following simplicity without hindrance, the altar may simply invoke the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center—what harm is there in this? If these Five Emperors are indeed the Five Elders, then calling them the Five Emperors is unobjectionable. If the Five Emperors differ from the Five Elders, then referring to them as the Five Emperors is all the more appropriate. Why cling rigidly to one interpretation? Reasonably speaking, it is best to name them according to the abode of the Five Qi. In the celestial realm, they are called the Five Elderly Lords of Heaven; in celestial patterns, the Five Emperors’ Seats or the Five Directions and Five Stars; among divine spirits, the Five Directions and Five Emperors; in mountains and peaks, the Five Sacred Peak Emperors; and within the human body, the Lords of the Five Viscera. Is this not both logically coherent and easy to practice? If one wished to trace all back to a single source, calling the Lords of the Five Viscera the Five Elderly Lords of Heaven would be as absurd as a child of three feet knowing it to be impossible. This was briefly addressed in the *Six Encampments’ Petitions and Thanksgivings*. Yet in this ritual arrangement, the Five Directions and Five Emperors are listed twice, lest later generations misunderstand the reasoning, and so it is explained in detail here. Many earlier scholars have discussed this matter, yet few have reached a definitive conclusion. Fellow practitioners should investigate further. If any arrive at a settled judgment, it would resolve the confusions of later ages—this would be most fortunate.

Moreover, in recent times, some have presumptuously altered the titles of perfected beings, such as changing "Celestial Master" to "Heavenly Lord of the One Dao" or "Xu Jiyang" to "Heavenly Pivot Envoy." Such distortions and profanations are rampant. These individuals are not worth reproaching, but scholars of broad learning should collectively reject such practices.

**Ancient Ritual for the Yellow Register Grand Fast and Scattered Altar Offerings**
In ancient times, there were no arrangements for the layout of the ritual arena; all rites were conducted upon the altar. Thus, when setting up an offering, outside the altar, azure silk and crimson seats were prepared, along with seasonal fruits and ritual libations. After presenting the memorial and casting the dragon tablets, the deities were invited to descend, and the offering was set forth. Though later generations continued to perform rites upon the altar, they also installed images, established positions, and arranged the ritual space. The altar was used for offerings, while the ritual arena itself was furnished with sacrificial provisions. If following the ancient method, after presenting the memorial upon the altar, the deities would be invited to descend, and the offering would be set upon the altar, while the threefold presentation of offerings could proceed within the ritual arena. Alternatively, after presenting the memorial and casting the dragon tablets, the incense burner would be carried out the door. The officiants would withdraw to the quiet chamber for a brief rest, then re-enter, ascend the altar, offer incense, recite the ritual texts, invite the deities to descend, set forth the offering, receive the precepts and assume their roles, chant the *Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings*, circumambulate the altar, exit the door, send off the deities, and burn the concluding offerings before concluding the rite and dispersing the assembly.

Nowadays, during the circumambulation while chanting the *Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings*, the hasty lowering of the gate placards is most improper. The ritual space is prepared to model heaven and earth, with gates and placards arranged to demonstrate proper form. Once the altar rites are complete, all should be dismantled together—why the rush to lower the placards? Such disorderly conduct disrupts the solemnity of the ritual, mingling movements and halts in a most inconvenient manner. Moreover, the words of the *Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings* merely expound upon sins and blessings to exalt the scriptural teachings, and are not part of the gate-lowering ceremony. This should be carefully considered.

The officiants form ranks before the master, and the High Priest offers incense. The *Hymn to the Dao* is chanted. They enter the Earthly Gate, ascend the Heavenly Portal, offer incense to the Ten Directions, the incense at the imperial table, and the incense at their own stations. Each bows to the master and visualizes as prescribed. The *Five Stars Mantra* is recited, the ritual drum sounded, the incense burner activated, and each announces their ritual position:

*"We, your servants [names], now humbly burn incense. May this merit be dedicated above to the ancestral spirits of the imperial lineage, the present emperor, the civil and military officials, the ministers and all underlings, and the disciples performing this fast, [names], along with their seven generations of ancestors, nine lineages of descendants, living kin, the three masters and nine generations of our own ancestors, all people under heaven, and all sentient beings—those lost in the dark paths of the underworld. We devote our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Boundless. We beseech forgiveness for the grave sins of past lives and the present, that we may escape the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings, Eight Difficulties, and Nine Calamities. May our bodies attain the true Dao, soaring through empty space, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, to serve and guard the Dao Lords, roaming freely in the supreme golden palaces and seven-jeweled natural palaces of the void, forever united with the Dao. May our supplications be received before the perfected and boundless Dao."*

**Repentance to the Ten Directions**
*"We, the ritual assembly, wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Dao. We repent for the ancestral spirits of the imperial lineage, the present emperor, the princes and ministers, the civil and military officials, the disciples performing this fast, our three masters and nine generations of ancestors, our inner and outer kin, those living and deceased, our affinal relatives, the rulers of the underworld, the suffering souls of the earthly prisons, the wandering spirits of the air, the sunken souls and stagnant spirits, all sentient beings with consciousness, and every living creature. From the distant kalpas of the past to this very day, we may have committed transgressions in bodily deeds—our four limbs and actions violating the precepts, not adhering to the scriptures. Or in mental deeds—our thoughts scattered, emotions restless, minds racing without cease. Or in verbal deeds—mixing good and evil in speech, using ornate words to conceal wrongs, employing flowery language to deceive the multitude. The great sins of the three karmas accumulate like mountains; the transgressions of the ten evils fill vast seas. Through this repentance, we beseech their complete eradication. We humbly pray that the revered ancestral spirits may roam freely in the Purple Ultimate."*

May the sacred chart endure forever, the imperial throne remain secure and peaceful,
the Emperor’s longevity match the Five Peaks, his wisdom equal the sun and moon.
May princes, ministers, civil and military officials faithfully assist the imperial enterprise,
broadcasting the transformative power of the Dao.

For the ritual master of this household, and for our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages,
our four companions and three teachers—those who have shed their mortal forms in the Southern Palace,
washed their souls in the cinnabar radiance—
may the three paths and six destinies all emerge from darkness,
ascending to the shore of blessedness.

May we ourselves enter the realm of perfected immortals,
unite with the Dao and merge with the True,
our spirits returning to profound stillness,
penetrating the spontaneity of nature,
our nature and life harmonizing with the Dao,
mysteriously attaining non-action.

We bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Most High and Perfect Three Treasures.
Following the ritual scripture, we perform the Triple Invocation and Triple Bow.
We circumambulate, then gather the True Writs.
The assembly chants in unison as the High Priest takes up the True Writs,
fumigates them with incense, strikes his teeth twelve times, and recites the incantation.

If this ritual is dedicated specifically to delivering the departed,
the middle section of the writ is placed for pacification, and this incantation is proclaimed:

Most High and Perfect, Great Sage and Lofty Venerable,
spreading transformation and circulating qi through the thirty-two heavens.
Eight gatherings and nine luminances naturally form the script.
Pacifying heaven and earth, safeguarding against kalpic years.
The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command universally notifies the Three Origins.
Below, it summons the nine earths; above, it connects with the three heavens.
At its center, it announces to the seas and mountains, the great peaks and rivers.
Today, we make this supreme declaration, and the myriad spirits all hear.

Through this fast and the practice of the Dao, we deliver the departed souls.
May the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus eradicate the roots of sin.
May the three souls be eternally delivered from the source of the five sufferings.
May they receive blessings life after life, their names inscribed in the cinnabar register.
May their spirits be born in heaven, refined and transformed by nature.
May they transcend life and death, enduring for countless kalpas.
The command of the nine heavens is transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

The assembly bows again, following the True Writs and memorial, and burns them.

If this ritual is performed for the state and the people,
to ensure prosperity, protect the age, avert disasters, and deliver from calamities,
saving both the living and the dead,
then the Red Writs are used for pacification, and this incantation is proclaimed:

The Primordial Beginning of the highest heaven, the three luminaries shining brightly,
the four seasons illuminating, the four directions made clear and pure.
Where the revolving destiny clashes, meteors surge and scatter.
The five phases are disordered, the three constellations unsettled.
The gods of the Five Celestial Palaces, the luminous spirits of the Seven Stars,
the True Lord Great Culmen, whose tabooed name is Jade Essence,
and the Lady Imperial Consort, whose name is Nurturing Infant,
together govern the Mysterious Pass, revolving the myriad heavens.

Today, a certain calamity has arisen, darkly foretelling misfortune.
We present this True Writ, also inscribed and submitted above.
We scatter our hair to confess our faults, revealing our cinnabar sincerity.
We beseech your mysterious scrutiny, restoring the celestial canon.
May qi not flow recklessly, may disasters not arise wantonly.
We burn the True Writs, dispersing their smoke in the Jade Court.
The Upper Radiance supervises and measures, universally notifying the myriad spirits.
May the qi of the three passes be purified, the disasters of the nine darknesses eradicated.
May yin and yang harmonize, the land know great peace.

We request that golden dragons transmit this by wind and fire couriers.
The assembly bows again, and the True Writs are burned with the memorial.

Again, we declare our ritual ranks:
We, the ritual master [Name], together with the assembled officials of this altar,
solemnly and sincerely address the Most High and Boundless Dao,
the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin,
the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao,
the Most High and Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerables,
the Perfected Great Sages who have attained the Dao,
the Perfect and True Lords and Masters,
the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
the Celestial Masters and True Lords,
the Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers,
the Four Controllers and Five Emperors,
the numinous palaces of the Five Peaks,
the grottoes and abodes of the famous mountains,
the officials and attendants of the three realms,
and all true spirits.

By our past karmic affinity with the Dao, we have personally encountered this orthodox transformation.
The Celestial Venerable expounded the teachings, promulgating the Three Caverns.
The precious formulas and numinous charts bring prosperity to households and peace to the state.
Having attained participation in the true mysteries, we are permitted to receive and cultivate them.
Our duty lies in establishing merit, universally benefiting both the hidden and the manifest.
We should propagate the sagely instructions, broadly delivering celestial and human beings.
None who sincerely submit should be rejected or abandoned.

Today, in accordance with the edict, we dare not withhold this from your notice.
We present this blue-green memorial from the altar, respectfully announcing it.

Proclamation:
In accordance with the words of the memorial, we are truly sincere and earnest.
It is fitting that this be reported.
We hope to attain spiritual resonance.

Together, we circulate our cinnabar sincerity, mutually guiding one another.
Examining the immortal classics and the standards of the spirits,
we unfold the yellow register’s scriptures.
On behalf of the ritual master [Name],
at [Location] in [Prefecture and County],
we establish the pattern of the mysterious rites,
modeling the two principles.
With the treasured offerings of lamps, candles, incense, and flowers,
golden dragons and silken banners,
and the pledges of our destined lives,
we verify our cinnabar sincerity.

On [Date and Time], we commence the fast,
burning incense, practicing the Dao,
repenting before the mysterious darkness,
lighting lamps to continue the illumination,
shining upon the three realms.
Below, we reach the nine earths; above, we extend to the myriad heavens,
delivering the living and rescuing the departed,
universally benefiting household and state.

For three days and five nights, we practice the Dao and recite the scriptures.
On [Date] at the hour of the boar, the ritual is completed and the task accomplished.
The lotus lamps extinguish their flames, the jade chimes cease their sound.
The immortal chariots return to the Upper Mystery, the dharma currents disperse in the lower realms.
Golden dragons soar in shadow, submitting the merits of the fast above.

May the sagely grace proclaim mercy,
opening the path to deliver the hidden souls,
rewarding merit and bestowing honors,
universally extending to the numinous bureaus.

The inner and outer true officials we bear within our bodies,
the soldiers and clerks of the Three Caverns,
the sun, moon, and stellar constellations,
the Five Emperors and Five Peaks,
the Three Rivers and Four Seas,
the cavalry and chariots,
the incense-bearing golden lads,
the flower-scattering jade maidens,
the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,
the messengers who transmit and report,
the flying dragon couriers—
all have labored diligently.

Today, we separately bow and present yellow silk and vermilion memorials,
reporting their merits and recommending their promotion.

We, whose study of the dharma is incomplete,
have erred in our demeanor and conduct,
transgressing the regulations and failing to conform to the ritual forms.
We fear being impeached by the Four Controllers,
seized by the Five Emperors.
For our thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults,
we beseech your forgiveness and pardon,
mercifully overlooking our ignorance,
that we may not incur punishment.

At the beginning of this fast, we reverently invited the Ten Precepts of the Upper Grade of Wisdom.
Now that the dharma rites are complete, we respectfully return them to their celestial palaces.

The fast we have conducted is now accomplished.
We reaffirm its merits and present a yellow silk and vermilion memorial,
placed upon our jade table.
We request that the text of the memorial be reviewed.

The memorial is presented before the imperial throne, with the dragon-headed knife placed to the left of the sacred seat and the vermilion brush to its right. The memorial is proclaimed. The High Priest kneels at his station to seal the memorial. Once sealed, an envoy is dispatched.

We reverently dispatch the Five True Officials within our body, each accompanied by a minor clerk and twelve scribal assistants. We further command the Registrar of Merit, the Flying Dragon Couriers, and the swift messengers, all in solemn attire with caps and pendants, grinding ink and preparing brushes, girding swords and ordering records. They shall act on our behalf without delay, bearing the yellow silk and vermilion memorial to ascend to the celestial bureaus, presenting it in accordance with the memorial’s petition.

Should there be any erroneous characters, omitted words, or misplaced passages that do not follow in proper sequence, the scribal assistants and minor clerks, wielding dragon-headed writing knives and sharp brushes, shall correct and amend them on the spot. Let no supervising official have cause to reject or return it.

Sealing the qi, the memorial ascends directly to the presence of the Supreme Lord of the Boundless Dao of the Three Heavens. Let it not be delayed. The officials of the left shall pass through the gates in order, while those of the right shall present it in sequence. Let all officials and lords distinguish and arrange matters accordingly.

May what is requested descend, what is delivered reach, what is summoned arrive, what is governed be healed, what is condemned be destroyed, what is proclaimed be communicated, what is promoted advance, what is wished be fulfilled, and what is sought be obtained.

Should any subordinate official obstruct or intercept our memorial, preventing its ascent, they shall be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, their crimes adjudicated according to the celestial statutes, that the heavenly decrees be made manifest.

We prostrate ourselves, awaiting the response of profound grace.

The High Priest hands the memorial to the Daoist assembly. The collected true writs are placed upon the memorial table and burned together. The Fast Supervisor escorts the memorial text, leading the ritual to the Gate of Heaven, where it is burned. The incantation for the burning is recited.

The High Priest prostrates before the memorial, visualizing as prescribed in the ritual form. Rising, he declares, "Let it be heard." The Mountain Tablet is proclaimed.

The High Priest holds the tablet, fumigates it with incense, and strikes his teeth nine times, reciting the incantation for the Mountain Tablet:

"Mysterious and luminous, the Primordial Lord oversees the true.
The Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor, the vermilion script of the red writ.
The origin of heaven and earth, governing the Three Primes.
Gathering qi and summoning assemblies, hastening the ascent of immortals.
The exalted mandate of the Highest, proclaimed throughout the ten directions.
Sun, moon, and stars; the Five Peaks and sacred mountains.
Above in heaven, below on earth; the great spirits of the hidden realms.
Overseeing life and recording deeds, at the Southern Three Gates.
Unsealing the jade tablet, inscribing names in the cinnabar register.
Erasing the record of transgressions, elevating to the rank of imperial retainer.
The fast’s sponsor, [Name], relies upon the Perfect Dao.
Having established the fast and performed merit, redeeming the nine generations of ancestors.
All suffering souls, the rites now complete.
We reverently follow the sacred mountain, offering the jade tablet.
Beseeching the erasure of sins, that all may attain liberation.
Let there be no enmity or kinship, departing from the Three Evils.
May souls ascend to the Nine Heavens, crossing the threshold of life and death, enduring for myriad kalpas.
Today we make this supplication, may the myriad spirits hear it.
With this dragon tablet, we pledge to the true officials.
May our plea be granted, transmitted by the golden dragon couriers."

Next, the Water Tablet is proclaimed. The High Priest fumigates the tablet as before and recites the incantation for the Water Tablet:

"The Primordial Lord and Five Elders, the Supreme Emperor most exalted.
The perfected of the ten directions, the sacred immortals of Mount Taihua.
The vermilion writ proclaims the mandate, heard in even the most hidden realms.
Ascending to the Nine Heavens, we request the descent of the jade writ.
Sun, moon, and five stars; the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper.
We announce to the Five Peaks, the sacred mountains of the four directions.
Below, we announce to the rivers and seas, the twelve springs and sources.
The water emperors of the nine bureaus, the great spirits of the hidden realms.
Today we make this supplication, unfolding myriad wishes.
The fast’s sponsor, [Name], has established the fast and performed the Dao.
For the sake of the living and the dead, redeeming the seven generations of ancestors.
The roots of past transgressions, we reverently offer the jade tablet.
Beseeching that it be heard above, recorded in the water府.
May the departed ascend to heaven, crossing the threshold of life and death.
May the myriad spirits hear this.
With this dragon tablet, we announce to the water officials.
May our plea be granted, transmitted by the golden dragon couriers."

Next, the Earth Tablet is proclaimed. The High Priest holds the black tablet and, as before, recites the incantation for the Earth Tablet:

"Heaven and earth unfold, the myriad qi divide and bestow spirit.
The grottoes of the Three Primes, the radiant purity of the ten directions.
The Five Elder Supreme Emperors, governing life and death.
The cinnabar script of the red writ, the primordial essence of the Primordial Lord.
Proclaimed throughout the world, the august spirits of the nine lands.
Today we make this supplication, may the myriad immortals affirm life.
The fast’s sponsor, [Name], has established the fast and performed the Dao.
For the sake of the living and the dead, we wish for our immortality.
We offer the jade name to the Supreme Emperor of the Earth府.
Erasing the record of crimes, presenting the tablet to the upper palace.
Inscribed in the registers of Huaqing, the body attains flight.
In harmony with heaven and earth, the nine generations of kin.
Rotten bones renewed in glory, souls ascending to the Southern Palace.
Transformed in the immortal courts, today we proclaim this mandate.
May the myriad spirits hear it.
With this white tablet, we manifest our utmost sincerity.
May our plea be granted, transmitted by the golden dragon couriers."

The Hymn of the Dragon Tablet is recited.

Praying to ascend to the Purple Palace, the High Priest enters the ritual enclosure to perform the jiao offering.

We reverently and earnestly supplicate the Supreme Lord of the Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Most Exalted Mysterious Elder, the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Perfected and Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable masters of all ranks, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the responsive and perceptive spirits of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard that the yellow writs of the Registers of Destiny, the celestial ranks of the Mysterious Capital, the sacred writs and secret seals, are of solemn majesty and awe-inspiring dignity. Above, they dispel celestial disasters; below, they avert terrestrial calamities. They bring blessings to households and the state, safeguarding and securing the emperor. Their boundless merit extends to all beings, who are enveloped in fortune.

We, in reverent compliance with the fast’s provisions, have earnestly revealed our prayers, arrayed the symbols, and performed the rites. Having completed the ritual proceedings, we have received abundant protection. The nation and the realm rejoice together. The dark paths and suffering realms, by the blessings of the fast, are revived. The cold courts of the night府, bathed in compassionate grace, are opened and prosper.

Now, the fast’s sponsor, [Name], holds profound gratitude yet lacks means of repayment. Daring to take this moment at the conclusion of the altar rites, we humbly offer the reverence of the jiao offering.

Looking up in gratitude to the True Spirits for their compassionate regard, we offer slight repayment for the diligent service of the divine marshals. Gazing toward the numinous radiance, we earnestly renew our plea for descent.

We, together with the fast’s sponsor, prostrate in utmost reverence, yearning for the sagely presence. With due solemnity, we proceed to the rites of invocation, audience, tea offering, and the first oblation.

We, in all sincerity, reverently address the Most High Dao, the August Sovereign of the Myriad Heavens, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the Divine Immortals of Heaven and Earth, the Lords of the Sun and Moon, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Northern Dipper of the Three Terraces, the deities of mountains and rivers, the host of Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones, the officials of the Three Realms, and all the assembled divinities of this jiao altar.

By ancestral blessings, we were born into this life. Having received the sacred texts, we have followed the teachings of the Mysterious Dao. Our merits are as light as dust and dew, while our transgressions weigh like mountains. Rightly, we should restrain ourselves and cultivate discipline. Yet the Dao permits deliverance and aids the state in establishing merit. Thus, when beings seek refuge, it is only proper that we not refuse.

Now, the fast’s sponsor, in utmost sincerity, has poured forth his heartfelt vows. Through this fast, he seeks to deliver the departed, revive the souls of the night’s dark courts, beseech grace and forgiveness, atone for transgressions, bring fortune to the state, and universally benefit all beings, moving and still. With the fast’s merit now accomplished and demonic obstacles dispelled, we rely entirely upon the responsive presence of the True Spirits, the sagely assembly of the altar, the inner and outer officials, and the ritual officers and soldiers of the talismanic register—all of whom have brought this great blessing to fruition, fulfilling the sponsor’s earnest prayers.

Yet in our morning observances, we may have offended the celestial patterns; in our reverent constructions, we may have failed in proper decorum. The fast’s offerings may have been deficient, the altar’s regulations incomplete. In movement and stillness, we may have transgressed the proper measures; in posture and gesture, we may have strayed from the norm. Thus, we have presumptuously offended the True Spirits and violated the statutes and prohibitions. For these faults, we now confess in this jiao offering. We beseech the relevant authorities to proclaim these matters to all under their charge, to erase our transgressions, and to absolve our faults. Daring to rely upon the grace of their trust and protection, we pray for the descent of future blessings.

With the assembled Perfected Ones in attendance, we offer the second libation to express our sincerity. Presumptuously disturbing the august spirits, we are filled with trepidation. We, together with the fast’s sponsor, prostrate in awe and reverence, bowing twice.

**Second Oblation Rites**
We, in all sincerity, reverently address the Boundless Dao, the Most High Perfected Ones, the authorities of mountains and rivers, the underworld bureaus, the yin and yang overseers, the officials of the Three Realms, and all numinous powers.

We have heard that the Three Clarities’ August Saints, the Five Emperors’ Venerable Divinities, the True Spirits of Heaven and Earth, and the Mysterious Controllers of the Supreme Offices shape creation and nurture all beings. Embracing non-action, their merit precedes even the covering of Heaven and the bearing of Earth. Their divine mechanisms are unfathomable, their virtue extends to the hidden and the manifest. They secretly protect the state, subtly assist all beings, dispel all disasters, and ward off all calamities. Whatever is beseeched, they surely oversee and protect.

We humbly pray that they witness and record the merit of this fast. May the fast’s sponsor, [Name], his seven generations of ancestors and nine degrees of descendants, his five relations and six clans, the departed and the long-gone, and all the souls thus delivered ascend to the Vermilion Palace, roam the Azure Heavens, and know no suffering, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided. May we, our four companions and three masters, our worldly and Daoist kin—those who have passed attain transcendence and deliverance, and those still living realize the fruit and achieve immortality.

Next, we pray for the fast’s sponsor, [Name], and all his living kin: may misfortunes scatter, sins dissolve, true qi flourish within, and divine officials guard without. May his years be prolonged, his fortune and longevity renewed. In all his comings and goings, may the gods protect him. May he be transformed in the Northern Palace and reborn in the Southern Dipper. May the local earth gods ever watch over him.

Above, we pray for the emperor’s eternal longevity, the state’s flourishing prosperity, universal peace under Heaven, and the cessation of warfare. May the long night of the Nine Dark Realms lead to rebirth in Heaven. May all beings within the Four Seas together ascend to the realm of longevity.

We, whose mastery of the Dao is incomplete and whose cultivation remains unfulfilled, fear transgressing the Mysterious Statutes, making our petitions difficult to convey. We humbly pray that our unexpressed supplications swiftly ascend to the Nine Heavens. May the true texts and numinous scriptures universally succor the hidden and the earthbound. May the Mysterious Wind spread widely, its beneficent influence descending to moisten the hidden and the manifest, bringing prosperity to the living and the dead.

The rites of invocation and gratitude now complete, may the responsive presence be felt in this moment, and may the jiao offering reach its conclusion. Daring to present the third oblation, we, together with the fast’s sponsor, prostrate in deepest gratitude and reverence, bowing twice.

**Final Oblation Rites and Memorial Presentation**
We, in all sincerity, reverently address the High Perfected Ones of the Three Realms, the Saints of the Ten Directions, and all the assembled divinities of this jiao altar.

With the fast’s proceedings concluded and the jiao rites completed, we now present our disordered offerings and humble tributes, hoping for the grace of lenient protection and the pardon of our foolish transgressions. May fortune flow to all beings, and blessings spread to all directions.

Our worldly merits are meager, unworthy of the divine hosts. The Perfected Ones dwell in distant realms, far beyond the Jade Palace. May the celestial beings of the Upper Realms ascend to their palaces. May the lords of mountains and rivers return to their divine offices. May the True Spirits of the talismanic registers, the soldiers and horses of the Three Realms, report to the Heavenly Court and receive their ranks and rewards. May the local earth gods and city gods, having received the fast’s blessings, all partake in the Mysterious Fortune.

Bowing at the celestial steps, we send them off with shared reverence. Overwhelmed with longing and devotion, we prostrate in deepest sincerity.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Spirits**
Vast and formless, the empty void—

**Next: Precept Hymn, Circumambulation, and the Cantor’s Position**
The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Preaches the precepts to deliver all beings.

Next, the Cantor chants the Return of the Precepts. Three bows are performed, and the officiants submit their ranks. In order before the sacred table, they present their rank tablets, perform three bows, withdraw, and relinquish their offices.

At the commencement of this fast, and throughout the presentation of memorials, the dispatch spirits from within this servant’s body—the functionaries of merit, the Three and Five True Officials, and the hundred nodal divine clerks—all return to this servant’s body. Entering through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Merit Functionary supervises and oversees, each resuming their original positions without error. When later summoned again, they shall return as before.

The incense is replenished, and three bows are performed. Circumambulation begins, and eight hymns on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings are chanted while circling the altar thrice, as in the *Step of the Void*.

*"The Three Powers and the myriad things..."*
*"Great worthies, guard these precepts..."*
*"Sin and fortune arise not from others..."*
*"Lust and jealousy are the roots of calamity..."*
*"Past lives are surely so..."*
*"Human life is already spent..."*
*"To learn the Dao and practice it is urgent..."*
*"Great worthies delight in the scriptures and precepts..."*

**Hymn for Dismissing the Altar**
Vast emptiness enfolds all forms.

Descending through the Heavenly Gate, exiting the Earthly Portal. Departing the altar, the ritual concludes. Proceeding to the master’s tent, gratitude is expressed, and the memorial is presented.

The old rites for sending off the master lacked a formal address in the ritual manuals. Fearing disorder in speech at the moment, six texts for addressing the overseers before the tents have now been composed, appended below for the use of the entire tradition. Should any text be imperfect, revisions may be made.

First, proceed to the head of the western three tents, approaching the Overseer of the Fast. Offer incense, and both the High Priest and the Fast Officer bow, kneel, and deliver their address:

*"This humble servant, [Name], in proper ritual position, respectfully bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Most August Master of the Numinous Treasure, Overseer of the Fast. In delivering salvation to heaven and humanity, nothing precedes the blessings of the fast. In expanding the teachings, all depends on the master’s grace. Fortunate indeed is this sincere offering, born of your boundless compassion. Private devotion is fulfilled, and divine favor knows no limit. Yet this servant, dull and ignorant, errant in learning, has but roughly completed the listed petitions and memorials, while often violating the ritual’s true intent. Thus, I present this memorial to confess my faults before your eyes, unashamed of my importunity, and humbly make this declaration. I implore your compassion and special consideration."*

**Reading the Memorial**
*"The memorial just presented has presumptuously reached your divine attention. May you pity this later student and graciously bestow your lenient favor. Though five days have passed and nine mornings completed, a thousand transgressions have amassed into ten thousand faults. I beseech their thorough cleansing and full pardon. May good deeds be recorded, and divine blessings flow forth. The ritual concludes, the mats are rolled, and the altar is dismissed. The celestial retinue does not tarry—already their rainbow banners are arrayed in the layered heavens. The divine steeds are harnessed, yet none may follow the crane-drawn chariot through the long sky. The ritual assembly extols and bows in shared reverence, sending them forth."*

The *Hymn for Completing the Fast* is raised, as before.

Next, proceed to the Heavenly Master’s tent and deliver the address:

*"This humble servant, [Name], in proper ritual position, respectfully bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Most August Master of the Three Heavens, Supporter of the Dao and Assistant of the Mysteries. This servant observes how the sincerity of the fast universally reaches all, completing the perfection of the altar rites. The blessings of the Dao spread afar, truly through the master’s sheltering grace. Reflecting on my own reckless presumption, I have received profound compassion. Yet this servant, dull and slow, shallow in learning, dares not falter before the altar but fears violating the ritual’s standards. Overwhelmed with shame, I can but confess my faults in this memorial. Humbly, I present it for your perusal. I earnestly hope for the master’s mercy and gracious consideration."*

**Presenting the Memorial**
*"The memorial has now been presented. May you pity this later student and forgive these deep transgressions. Command the bureaus of investigation to dissolve the records of faults. Notify the offices of assessment to record the merits of this fast. Gratitude wells within, yet no ground suffices to repay such grace. Gazing afar at your divine radiance as if still present, I now see only your retinue soaring through the sky. The altar assembly extols and bows in shared reverence, sending you forth."*

The *Hymn for Completing the Fast* is raised, as before.

Next, proceed to the Five Emperors’ tent and deliver the address:

*"This humble servant, [Name], in proper ritual position, respectfully bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center. This servant observes how prayers to heaven and earth follow the ritual codes, and the completion of the fast depends on their scrutiny. Having fulfilled the nine mornings’ rites, all beings receive blessings. The fulfillment of good karma truly stems from your divine regard. Ashamed, I lower my head in submission. Yet this servant, of flesh and blood, with learning from mere hearsay, has trodden the altar and practiced the teachings while often violating the true canon. Though the fast’s construction is complete, I fear my transgressions are inescapable. Thus, I dare present my sincerest thoughts and respectfully offer this memorial. Presumptuously reaching your sagely attention, I implore your consideration."*

**Presenting the Memorial**
*"Having read this memorial, it has already reached your enlightened oversight. May you forgive the punishments for my errors and stay the might of investigation. Command the bureaus of records to erase my faults and the offices of merit to inscribe my good deeds, that my name may be marked. The ritual concludes, and your chariot is prepared. Unable to follow your retinue, I can but gaze longingly at your clear passage. The ritual assembly extols and bows in shared reverence, sending you forth."*

The *Hymn for Completing the Fast* is raised, as before.

Next, proceed to the eastern three tents. First, approach the Three Masters’ tent and deliver the address:

*"This humble servant, [Name], in proper ritual position, respectfully bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Most August Master of the Ancient Numinous Treasure Scriptures, the Master of the Numinous Treasure Registers, and the Master of the Numinous Treasure Salvation. This servant observes how the vast dissemination of the ritual teachings stems from your clear transmission, and the completion of the fast truly arises from your protection. Sincerity reaches heaven, and gratitude fills the earth. Bound in humility, I know my fortune; carved in bone, my gratitude is endless. Yet this servant, crude and rustic, slow in learning, has presumptuously held the office of proclamation and completed the rites of salvation. Though the affair is fulfilled, my faults remain grave. Thus, I rely on this memorial to confess my transgressions."*

With reverence, I now proclaim and present this memorial, humbly beseeching your gracious review.

The memorial is recited:
The foregoing memorial is respectfully submitted, laying bare my sorrowful sincerity. May the ritual teachings be upheld, and my faults and flaws be forgiven with compassion. May my transgressions be erased from the records of the Three Primes, and the merit of this fast be inscribed in the Nine Poles. May the celestial registers be fully reported, and the echoes of the Brahma-voice be gathered. Cloud chariots cannot linger in the mortal realm; feathered canopies shall ascend the heavenly path. This humble body cannot rise, yet the true conveyance is distant. The assembly of the Dharma raises its voice in praise, bowing together in reverent farewell.

The fast proceeds as before.

Next, approaching the tents of the Three Officials, the address is made:
This servant of the Dharma rank, so-and-so, humbly bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Most August Heavenly Official of the Upper Prime, the Earthly Official of the Middle Prime, and the Water Official of the Lower Prime. This servant observes how the recording of good deeds and the inscription of merit rightfully belong to the courts of the Three Primes. The completion of this five-day fast and offering is a fortunate fulfillment of the ritual norm. That this wholesome fruit has come to fullness is truly owing to the vast and universal grace bestowed. Were it not for the great creation, how could this humble servant’s private prayers be answered? Yet this servant, of feeble and withered capacity, with crude and neglected learning, possesses but narrow vision and thus commits many errors in conduct. Though the good cause is roughly accomplished, I fear hidden retribution. Desiring to implore pardon, I now present this memorial. Unfolding the memorial, I humbly beseech your gracious review.

The memorial is recited:
The foregoing memorial is respectfully submitted, hoping it may reach your true hearing. I beg a measure of leniency in the mysterious statutes and pray that my sins may be wholly erased from the celestial records. May the offices of the immortals be commanded to inscribe the merit of this fast. May the power of the Dao be magnified to extend its sheltering cover, and may its profound shade be boundless. Now that the jade altar’s rites are complete, the jade chariot cannot be delayed. As it is destined to ascend the empyrean, I can only gaze longingly toward the jeweled vault. The assembly of the Dharma raises its voice in praise, bowing together in reverent farewell.

Next, approaching the Mysterious Master, the address is made:
This servant of the Dharma rank, so-and-so, humbly bows and offers sincerest devotion, reverently addressing the Great Master of the Mysterious Center. This servant observes how the mysterious net has been raised, and the fast has fortunately reached completion. The numinous shade has manifested its trustworthiness, universally bestowing blessings upon both the seen and unseen worlds. In this, I rely entirely on the gift of life and accomplishment. Yet this servant, of petty and insignificant capacity, with shallow and limited learning, though supported to complete the affair, must have committed errors and violated the ritual codes. Hanging my head in shame, I bind myself and beg forgiveness. I now present this memorial, presumptuously laying it before you. I humbly hope for your true compassion, that you may graciously review it.

The memorial is recited:
The foregoing sincerity has reached the depths of your profound hearing. May the great pardon of your mercy be extended, universally remitting boundless punishments. May the merit of good deeds be inscribed throughout the Three Realms, and the blessings of this fast flow to the Ten Directions. The dusty and turbid paths are difficult to traverse; the immortal retinue abides in the mysterious celestial realm. As the numinous steeds prepare to depart, though my heart is filled with longing and attachment, I know that pursuit is beyond reach. Overwhelmed by your boundless grace, my sincerity cannot be fully expressed. The assembly of the Dharma raises its voice in praise, bowing together in reverent farewell.

Next, addressing the supervising deities, the prayer is offered:
This servant of the Dharma rank, so-and-so, reverently burns incense and addresses the supervising deity of the altar. I observe how the support and exaltation of the ritual net rely on the power of the deities who oversee the sacred rites. The solemnity and strictness of the altar’s precincts depend on the diligence of the earthly spirits in fulfilling their duties. Now that the great fast has reached completion and the rites of the immortal ceremony are concluded, the protection and defense, the summoning and proclamation, all stem from your sustaining care, and your labor in stationing and guarding has been weighty. Having already reported your merit to the heavenly courts and prayed for the advancement of your kind to the ranks of immortals, the subtle rites are now complete, and the divine conveyance cannot be delayed. Each returns to your respective abodes, resuming your numinous offices. Should there be future fasts, I shall again pray for your presence and favor.

The ritual proceeds to the burning site, where paper money, horses, and memorials are consumed.

**Burning Prayer and Hymn of Redirection**

The foregoing prayers and dedications are now redirected:
I observe how the Scarlet Writs unfold wondrous teachings, inexhaustibly aiding the world. The Yellow Registers and mysterious codes deliver countless beings. Today, the officiant so-and-so, with heart set on salvation and resolve fixed on cultivation, has established the Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Great Fast for five days and nights. He has prayed to heaven and reported to earth, presented memorials and petitions, burned incense and lit lamps, recited scriptures and performed the Dao, safeguarding the state and family, benefiting and protecting the living and the dead, conducted offerings to give thanks, and now concludes the altar and disperses the assembly. The majestic good fruit and vast wholesome cause have fortunately reached completion, all now fully accomplished.

I humbly pray that the nation and kingdom be tranquil, the realm and earth be at peace, the nine generations of ancestors ascend to the realms of goodness, and the six relations of kin be bathed in descending blessings. May the souls of the deceased, so-and-so, who are hereby commemorated, by virtue of this fast’s merit, come to know their past lives, forever escape the realm of delusion, and directly ascend to the land of purity. May those in the three paths be released from the toil of punishment, and those in the nine earths be freed from the suffering of bondage. May all who bear kinship and hold consciousness attain enlightenment and revival. May all who possess nature and form receive benefit and aid.

For the supreme karmic connection, I invoke the great sagely Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, and their inconceivable merit and virtue.

The High Priest concludes the rites, offers incense, and exchanges congratulations on the completion of the fast. He retires from his position, and the assembly disperses.

I reverently hear that the Dao cannot be named, and thus scriptures were established to propagate the teachings. The scriptures cannot be fully encompassed, and thus auspicious signs unfold according to the times. The primordial qi divides into three, forming the mysterious, original, and primordial three qi. The mysterious qi constitutes the Qingwei Heaven, known as the Jade Pure Realm. In the Dragon Han kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve sections of the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Reality* in this heaven, from which the texts emerged—this is called the Heavenly Treasure. The original qi constitutes the Yuyu Heaven, known as the High Pure Realm. In the Yan Kang kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve sections of the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Mystery*, from which the Lord of the Dao produced the texts—this is called the Numinous Treasure. The primordial qi constitutes the Great Red Heaven, known as the Supreme Pure Realm. In the Red Bright kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve sections of the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Divinity*, from which Lord Lao produced the texts—this is called the Divine Treasure. Thereafter, in the aftermath of the Kaihuang era, the Three Caverns were proclaimed and disseminated, descending to transform the human realm. Since the era of the Supreme August, the multitude of scriptures and canons have flowed forth without end. The scriptures of the Three Caverns sometimes conceal and sometimes reveal themselves, now preserved, now lost. Were it not for the Uppermost Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, they could not be fully possessed.

The complete corpus of the thirty-six divisions totals 1,844,200-odd scrolls. Yet in the world, what is present is often lacking elsewhere; what descends later may conceal what came before. Since the opening of heaven and earth and the flourishing of the teachings, the human realm has never possessed the Three Caverns in full. At the end of the Qin dynasty, the Three Mao Perfected Lords cultivated and preserved the Supreme Dao, and the teachings of the Cavern of Perfection first began to sprout. By the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of the Eastern Jin, Lady Wei of Southern Marchmount transmitted the multitude of *Great Cavern Scriptures* to Yang the Director of Destinies, from whom they were gradually disseminated. In Eastern Wu, Master Ge the Immortal received the scriptures from Xu Laile, and the canons of the Cavern of Mystery spread widely. When the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master encountered Lord Lao at Crane Cry Mountain, the teachings of the Cavern of Divinity were broadly expounded—these were their great origins. Beyond these, some appeared in other books, some were recorded in historical annals, some were bestowed upon individuals by special descent, and some were transmitted in accord with the times, emerging and vanishing unpredictably, now concealed, now revealed.

Between the Song and Qi dynasties, Lu Jianji, endowed with a spirit of numinous refinement, revived the teachings of the August Void, widely promulgating the Daoist canons and broadly opening the wellsprings of the Perfected. He distinguished the differences among the Nine Purities and Three Caverns, arranged the variations of the Five Methods and Four Auxiliaries, and discerned the true from the false, the refined from the coarse. Of the scriptures and decrees that remained, only 18,000 scrolls survived. Later generations referred to the "thirty-six divisions and eighteen thousand chapters" as the catalog compiled by Lu Jianji.

Thereafter, as the north and south fell into turmoil, the scriptures scattered and perished. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Later Zhou, the Tongxuan Abbey was established to gather Daoist canons, still numbering ten thousand scrolls. By the end of the Sui dynasty, warfare raged across the land, the Central Plains were in chaos, and the scriptures were either burned or destroyed, their teachings nearly eradicated. During the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras of the Tang, when the realm was at peace, Emperor Xuanzong began to collect and restore them, recovering only slightly over seven thousand scrolls. This was the time when Tang compiled the *Compendium of the Jade Scriptures*.

Before long, great bandits pressed in, the Son of Heaven fled into exile, and Daoist abbeys and jade palaces fell into ruin wherever they stood. Later, Master Guangcheng once again faced perilous times, exerting every effort to seek out and gather lost texts, supplementing what had been lost. Compared to the Kaiyuan catalog, less than half remained. After collating the scriptures of the Three Caverns, he incorporated the ritual codes compiled by Lu Jianji and Zhang Qingdu, weighing ancient and modern practices, carefully determining what was appropriate, and re-edited the *Forty Scrolls of the Yellow Register Retreat Rites*, achieving perfect accord and deviating not from the ancient norms.

He observed that while many scriptures had already been lost in his time, the situation was not as dire as it is today. After the book’s completion, he exposed the text to the heavens in a solemn declaration, and its numinous efficacy was manifestly revealed. Nearly four hundred years have passed since then, and none have dared to question or alter its precedents. Those who follow its rituals in practice have all received responses, with evident retributions too numerous to count.

After the Tang, the Five Dynasties descended into chaos, and the Daoist teachings were lost and regained seven or eight times. In the divided lands of the realm, some regions also revered and expanded the scriptures. Some built jade palaces, others compiled *Daoist Canons*, often incorporating whatever texts were available in their locales, resulting in many errors and corruptions. After the Song dynasty unified the realm and peace prevailed, Emperor Zhenzong commanded his minister Wang Qinruo to collate the Daoist canons. Yet the refined and the coarse remained indistinguishable, the true and the false intermingled, and errors could not be avoided.

During the Xuanhe era, Emperor Huizong promoted ritual codes, and the teachings flourished for a time. Yet the scriptures and orthodox canons could never be fully purified. After the Jingkang incident, when the court settled in Qiantang, the north and south were sundered, and Daoist scriptures became even more incomplete. When Master Guangcheng compiled the retreat rites, he resided in the imperial academy, holding concurrent offices of authority. The court’s archives, provincial and prefectural libraries, the Daoist officials of the two capitals, and the secret repositories of the two capitals were all at his disposal, and he could gather and examine them at will. Thus, his writings and treatises each had their textual basis, and later generations throughout the realm followed them without exception.

Today, the *Daoist Canons* across various regions can be counted in number, yet few scriptures remain free of error. Moreover, private transmissions and local copying make it difficult to rely upon them. Yet some, having obtained a few scrolls, esteem themselves highly, unable to distinguish true from false, claiming superiority over their peers and attacking the ancients. In their words and arguments, they even presume to alter Master Guangcheng’s retreat rites, though they dare not openly criticize them, instead subtly raising objections and making unauthorized changes. They believe that their privately transmitted "secret scriptures" place them above Guangcheng, unaware that when Guangcheng compiled his work, he relied on the power of the court to search and collect—how could the meager holdings of a single household compare?

Lu Jianji compiled his ritual codes during the Song and Qi dynasties, and Zhang Qingdu preceded Guangcheng, yet Guangcheng’s work never omitted their teachings or adhered solely to his own views. Thus, he often recounted where Zhang Qingdu had already discussed a matter or where he had followed Lu Jianji’s codes, demonstrating meticulous attention to both the grand and the minute, encompassing all details. For later scholars today to presume to critique him—it is doubtful their arguments could endure.

The scriptures privately held today cannot compare to those of that time. The present compilation of the *Numinous Treasure* strictly follows ancient methods. The *Yellow Register* fully adheres to Guangcheng’s codes. Though it may not conform to worldly customs, it can stand without shame before gods and spirits. As for the section on scattering the altar and setting up the offering, it differs slightly from the local customs of the Zhe region. Even the *Established Rites of the Yellow Register* by the Jiang family largely adhere to ancient codes, citing scriptural sources. Yet some parts also incorporate modern practices, such as scattering the altar and removing the mats before issuing the invitation memorial for the offering, then conducting the offering separately—this is merely a recent custom.

In the Jiang family’s rites, these practices are adopted from the customs of eastern Zhe, yet no scriptural source is cited for this format. According to the liturgical codes of the middle antiquity, the prostration, invocation of merits, submission of memorials, and the three petitions to mountains, waters, and earth spirits—along with the descent of the deities and the setting up of the offering—were all sent off together with the master at the conclusion of the altar rites. Only Master Lu of the Orthodox Unity tradition, in his observance of the *Yellow Register* rites, performs the submission of memorials and scattering of the altar *after* the offering, then sends off the master and concludes the rites together. The Orthodox Unity school follows different principles, yet Master Lu’s intent was to establish a standard based on ancient rites.

Though these practices differ from those of Jiangdong and Jiangxi, applying ancient methods in eastern Zhe conflicts with local customs. Moreover, the Jiang family’s *Established Rites* has already been published, and its conventions align with Zhe’s popular practices. Many will surely follow it. As this text serves as a public instrument for the world, I dare not alter antiquity with such changes. In time, may there arise scholars of profound antiquity and broad learning who will fairly assess these matters, lest they be easily dismissed.

The post-offering rites of sending off the master and expressing gratitude are the oral declarations of the High Priest. Though such minor details are not recorded in ancient codes, they remain indispensable at the altar. I, Yunzhong, have already composed and fixed these in advance, ensuring their proper use to prevent disorderly speech at the critical moment. This is not a case of mixing modern practices with ancient canons.

For the overnight invocation and the establishment of the altar, the nine-day purification fast, and all corresponding liturgical texts, refer to Master Guangcheng’s *Fasting Codes*—these are not repeated here.

Here ends *Scroll Forty of the Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure*.
*Scroll Forty-One of the Great Rites of the Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure* begins.

The *Investiture of Dragon Tablets and Dispatch of Memorials* from the *Numinous Treasure Rituals of the Dongxuan Tradition*, compiled by Jin Yunzhong, Right Attendant of the Initial Prefecture under the Southern Bureau of Enforcement for Numinous Treasure Daoist Masters:

**Section on the Yellow Register Memorials for Liberating and Ascending the Spirits of the Lower Realm** states: Upon completing the rites of deliverance from karmic roots and the purification fast, in accordance with the *Red Writ Jade Formulary*, inscribe a jade tablet with cinnabar, attach one golden dragon and nine golden clasps, bind them with azure silk, and seal them within an inaccessible cliff. This serves as a pledge to the spirit immortals of the Five Marchmounts, a token of their ascension.

It further states: After concluding the rites invoking the Five Thearchs, inscribe a jade tablet with cinnabar, attach one golden dragon and nine golden clasps, bind them with azure silk to a stone, and cast them into the Three Rivers. This serves as a pledge to the Water Thearch, a token of ascension, strictly following the true text of the *Jade Formulary*.

It further states: Upon completing the rites for the Water Thearch, inscribe a jade tablet with cinnabar, attach one golden dragon and nine golden clasps, bind them with azure silk, and bury them at the altar site to notify and ally with the Earth Officials, all in accordance with the ritual codes.

The *Jade Casket of Luminous Perfection* states: When performing the *Yellow Register of the Numinous Treasure*, one should use three *liang* of superior gold to cast three dragons, each weighing one *liang*. The state uses superior gold, nobles and high ministers use secondary gold, while scholars and commoners gild silver. Accompanying the memorial, inscribe the purpose of the purification fast, the year, month, and day of the *Tai Sui*, and the name of the officiating master. These are to be cast into renowned grotto-heavens, numinous springs, dragon pools, or at the altar site to notify and ally with the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic bureaus, ensuring the validation of the fast’s merit. Those who omit this will be examined by the Earth Officials.

The *Codes of the Nine Capital Bureaus* state: The dragon rides the clouds and qi, governs yin and yang, coalesces into form or disperses into patterns, its transformations unfathomable, descending into earth or ascending to heaven. Thus, in the thirty-six heavens—the realm of utmost yang—it serves as a courier to transmit messages and communicate with the mysterious and numinous. Is this not the role of the dragon? The dragon embodies the yang soul, hence its use in celestial affairs. The heavens employ dragons as steeds, traversing between the celestial and human realms. Gold, the noblest of the five metals, is unyielding and steadfast, treasured by heaven and earth, and capable of uniting with the numinous. Thus, superior gold is used to cast dragons in their likeness, which are then cast into grotto-heavens to notify and ally with the Two Primordials. The true officials and subordinate officers of the grotto-heavens transmit the dragon pledge and memorial, recording the meritorious deeds to be reported to the Most High Saints. The response to such resonance is as inevitable as a shadow following form. Those who perform purification fasts must not omit this.

The *tablet* (简) signifies notification; the *memorial* (札) signifies record. It records the good deeds of the age and notifies the Highest Perfected. Its length is one *chi* and two *cun*, symbolizing the twelve earthly branches; its width is two *cun* and four *fen*, corresponding to the twenty-four qi; its thickness is two *fen*, symbolizing the Two Modes. Its top and bottom are square and upright, representing the sun’s square shadow, straight and unobstructed, yielding to nothing. The state uses jade for these, as jade possesses the Nine Virtues and serves as a pledge to the celestial and terrestrial spirits, hence its use. Nobles, ministers, and commoners universally use hibiscus wood, its purity and fine texture comparable to jade, thereby distinguishing the hierarchy of honor.

The *bi* disk is the treasure used in rites for heaven, earth, and mountains and rivers, made of jade. For mountain memorials, a green *bi* is used, circular in shape with a diameter of two *cun* and a hollow center. The mountain memorial serves as a pledge to the Nine Heavens, hence the use of a green *bi*, symbolizing heaven and earth. For water memorials, a *bi* with six projections is used, black in color, with a diameter of three *cun* and a hollow center. The water memorial serves as a pledge to the Water Officials of the Nine Rivers, hence the use of a dark *bi*, the color of water, with six projections, the number of water. For earth memorials, a yellow *bi* is used, square in shape with a diameter of two *cun* and a hollow center. The earth memorial serves as a pledge to the Nine Earths; yellow is the color of earth, and square its shape.

The *bi* and dragon accompany the sealed memorial, bound with azure silk. The codes state: The method for casting the Three Memorials requires nine golden clasps to accompany each, totaling twenty-seven clasps for the three memorials. The golden clasps substitute for blood oaths, and the azure silk for severed hair, signifying the utmost sincerity in forging alliances. Thus, the clasps and *bi* are bound with azure silk, attached to the memorial and dragon, and then cast. The state uses gold clasps, ministers use silver clasps gilded with gold. Each clasp has a diameter of nine *fen* and is circular like a ring.

The codes further state: Upon completing the purification fast, select an auspicious day or a time of ritual purity, prepare the offerings, and let the master, officials, and the fast’s sponsor—whether by boat to a water grotto or by ascent to a mountain—arrive at the grotto-heaven. Clear the area outside the grotto of杂草, sweep and purify it, arrange the ritual mats, and set out offerings of wine, fruit, grains, venison, broth, and tea. The state provides sixty portions, while ministers and commoners provide twenty-four, all in accordance with the ritual protocols. Then, don ceremonial robes, perform ablutions, and pay homage to the ritual proceedings, strictly adhering to the codes. The local spirit officials and supervisory officers should notify the immortal bureaus within the grotto, transmitting the memorial of the fast. Thus, blessings and good fortune will swiftly manifest. However, one must not omit the notification and directly cast the memorial into the grotto, lest it fail to reach the true spirits and instead incur punishment.

If the mountain or water grotto is too distant for the master and assembly to travel together, select one or two ritual officers from the altar to accompany the disciples and memorial to the grotto. There, perform the rites of notification, casting, and offering, strictly following the prescribed protocols. For state rituals casting dragons at the Five Marchmounts and other mountains, refer to the *Golden Register Codes*, which differ in complexity from these ordinary rites.

One must not conceal or delay the memorial texts; the local earth officials will record and report such omissions, and the resulting punishment will be severe. Exercise utmost caution.

Three memorial tablets shall be made, each of paulownia wood, twelve inches in length, two inches and four fen in width, and two fen in thickness. Three golden dragons, each crafted from one tael of silver and gilded. Three jade bi-discs: the azure bi of circular form, the black bi of hexagonal form, and the yellow bi of square form, each with a hollow center measuring three inches in diameter. Twenty-seven golden knobs, made of silver and gilded, each nine fen in diameter, ring-shaped with a hollow center.

Outside the grotto gate, select level ground, sweep it clean, and sprinkle it with pure water to prepare the altar site. Alternatively, use the bank of a deep pool or marsh, or the deck of a boat, laying down several clean mats to form seats, ensuring the mats are new. Arrange twenty-four or thirty-six portions of the five fruits, tea, and wine. Offer incense and candles, setting them out according to the ritual protocol. Once all is prepared, appoint a Daoist priest to consecrate the water and purify the altar. The High Priest then performs the liturgy and invokes the deities. Neglect of these duties incurs severe divine punishment.

**Ritual for Casting the Mountain Tablet**

Purify the altar, offer incense, and intone the hall-opening hymn. Each participant bows to the masters and meditates as prescribed in the fasting ritual. Recite the Five Directions Incantation:

*"The Five Stars array their radiance, illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star averts disaster; the Wood Power brings prosperity.
Mars dispels calamity; Venus repels warfare.
Saturn’s fourfold governance ensures the nation’s flourishing.
Names inscribed on jade tablets, records kept in the Celestial Chambers.
Riding the whirlwind, scattering light, soaring through the Great Void,
Emerging from the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds form canopies, summoning spirits and commanding winds,
Commanding the myriad spirits to ascend and protect the Immortal Elder."*

**Response:** *"In harmony with the Dao, united with the True."*

Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.

*"To the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Qi of the Original Beginning, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, I summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the left and right attendant messengers, the left and right incense-bearers, the courier dragon riders, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Duty Officers, the Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six in all—to emerge. Let them appear in solemn attire, adorned with robes, caps, and hanging tassels. I hereby notify the local deities of the mountains, rivers, and land: I now burn incense and, with utmost sincerity, present this petition for the casting of the tablet, as fully detailed in its text. May the sacred qi of the Most High and the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones, the numinous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, descend and enter my body, that my supplication may swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Upper Palace of Kunlun, and the deities of the Five Sacred Mountains’ grotto-fu."*

**Announce the Ritual Officiant’s Title:**
*"The humble official [Name], together with all assembled ritual officers, with utmost sincerity, reverently addresses the Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, the Great Ritual Master of the Mysterious Center, the Heavenly Bureau’s Sovereigns, the Perfected Immortals of the Grotto-fu, the Upper Palace of Kunlun, the Sacred Mountains and Blessed Lands, the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the Elder of Qingcheng, the Envoys of Mount Lu, the Northern Department of Dark Yin, the Numinous Hosts of the Netherworld, the Recording Immortal Sages of [Location]’s Sacred Mountain, the Void-Scrutinizing Inspectors, the Three Realms’ Officials and their subordinates, and all majestic spirits.*

*We humbly recall that the precious scriptures and numinous diagrams emerged as canons to save the world and bring peace to the age. The vermilion writings on jade revealed texts to pacify heaven and stabilize earth. They encompass all methods as their foundation, governing the Three Origins to record merit. Now, as the ritual at the numinous altar concludes and the fast’s blessings are fulfilled, we dare to inscribe virtue to erase transgressions and beseech the Perfected to descend. May the numinous light shine down and the immortal retinue arrive from afar. We prostrate ourselves in devotion and reverently present our petition."*

**Invoking the Deities:**
*"The Three Supreme Worthies, the Five Masters and Five Emperors, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Perfected Immortals of [Location]’s grotto-fu, the local deities, the Incense Officials, the Daily Merit Officers, the Earth Deities, and others."*
First, arrange the spirit tablets in order and invoke them sequentially.

**First Offering of Tea and Wine:**
*"The humble official [Name], with profound sincerity, reverently addresses the Boundless Great Dao, the Three Supreme Worthies, the Perfected Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, the Great Ritual Master of the Mysterious Center, the Nine Poles’ Lofty Perfected, the Sun, Moon, and Constellations, the Upper Palace of Kunlun, the Perfected Immortals of the Sacred Mountains and Grotto-fu, the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the Perfected Lords of Qian and Huo, the Elder of Qingcheng, the Envoys of Mount Lu, the Gloom of Mount Zhong, the Western Dark Pond Terrace, the Three Officials and Northern Department, the Six Grottoes’ Nether Bureaus, the deities above heaven and below earth, the numinous hosts of the unseen, the Registrars of Life and Death, the Three Southern Gates, and all supremely numinous spirits and immortals.*

*Born of dust and defilement, blind and ignorant, I have, through ten thousand kalpas of good fortune, relied upon the Dao’s transformation. I have received the compassionate teachings, assisted the state in establishing merit, saved beings and delivered people, and propagated the Dao to glorify the Dharma. If I were to cast the mountain tablet to cultivate immortality, I could omit the following section. Instead, for this fast’s sponsor, on behalf of the state and family, extending blessings to the living and the dead, at [Location], I have conducted a five-day and night Yellow Register Grand Fast. Having completed the ritual proceedings, I now cast the tablet at the sacred mountain, beseeching the erasure of sin records and praying to the spirits and immortals. I knock my head upon the ground before the divine Perfected, presenting this petition. I, along with the fast’s sponsor, can but implore your grace with utmost urgency, reverently bowing twice."*

**Second Offering:**
*"The humble official [Name], with profound sincerity, reverently addresses the Three Realms’ Heavenly Worthies, the Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Five Emperors’ Numinous Offices, the Perfected Immortals of the Grotto-fu, the Sacred Hosts of the Famous Mountains, the deities arrayed at this ritual feast, and all majestic spirits.*

*We have reverently come to the sacred mountain to perform this ritual feast for the Yellow Register fast’s sponsor, [Name]. Having completed the rites, we now cast the tablet to pledge our covenant, hoping to inscribe merit, absolve transgressions, and pardon faults. May the nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, the six clans’ kin, the departed and the transformed, have their evil roots redeemed. May they be freed from Fengdu, Mount Tai, the Twenty-Four Prisons, the Five Peaks’ Bureaus, and the Nine Dark Realms, their souls beholding the light, eternally receiving deliverance, reborn to receive transformation, entering the gates of fortune, their tombs secure, lawsuits dispelled, the entire household blessed, and all receiving grace. May demonic influences be eradicated, auspicious signs arise daily, the Dao be cultivated to attain the True, and immortality be forever harmonized. I, along with the fast’s sponsor, can but submit with utmost devotion, bowing twice."*

**Final Offering.**

**Proclamation of the Document**

The document is sealed, bound with jade script, golden dragons, and golden knots, wrapped in azure silk upon the tablet. It is then placed within a casket, suffused with incense, and the teeth are clicked nine times. Recite:

*The Darkly Luminous Opener, the Primal Origin’s Watchful True Spell.*

Cast the tablet into the cavern.

**Hymn of Casting the Dragon Tablet**
Praying to ascend the Purple Peaks, the mandate is proclaimed at the sacred mountain.
Jade maidens stir the echoes of Sanskrit, golden lads waft the incense smoke.
Names inscribed penetrate the Nine Earths, characters arrayed ascend the Three Heavens.
May boundless life be eternally enjoyed, and the loftiest immortality be attained.

**Resuming the Rite**
With utmost sincerity, I reverently invoke the exalted perfected and supreme sages, the immortals of mountains and peaks, the august deities of the Five Emperors, the sovereigns of the Three Realms, the assembled hosts of the offering altar, and all mighty numina.

The rite of proclaiming the document is now complete, the casting of the dragon tablet concluded. Humbly I receive fulfillment, graciously beholding your gaze. The exalted perfected have returned to the Supreme Mystery, the ranked sages each to their immortal abodes. The functionaries and officers have resumed their spirit offices, the earth gods and all deities have settled in their domains. Merit is recorded throughout the Three Realms, blessings extend to the Ten Directions.

I, along with the fast’s sponsor, can but submit with utmost devotion, bowing in reverence to send them forth.

**Hymn of Escorting the Deities**
The incense burner is restored.

Fragrant Office Envoys, the Lords of Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit-officials of incense: may this place where I have established the altar and performed the rites naturally give birth to golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. May the hundred numina and assembled perfected gather here before the incense burner. May it be wished that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions attend the orchid smoke, conveying the sincerity I have just proclaimed, swiftly reaching the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Supreme Dao in the Kunlun Upper Palace and the grotto-heavens of the Five Marchmounts.

**Hymn of Studying the Dao**
The burning of offerings concludes the preceding dedication.

**Rite of Casting the Water Tablet**
The arrangement of altar positions follows the mountain-simplicity model.

The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Three Qi of Yuanshi.

It is now fitting to summon the river and sea deities, the marsh and pool spirits, the local earth gods and true officials of this place to swiftly emerge and receive the announcement. I now burn incense and humbly present this proclamation to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Supreme Dao, the Divine King of Yang Valley, and the Water Palace and Water Thearchs.

**Declaring the Dharma-Positions**
I, the insignificant official [Name], together with all assembled altar officers, with unified sincerity, reverently address the Boundless Dao, the Most High Three Venerables, the great holy hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Way, the perfected lords and elders, the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, the great Dharma masters of the Mysterious Center, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations, the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper, the Eternal Radiance of the Sun’s Cavern, the immortals of the Dark Yin, the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Nine Jiang and Huai Marshes, the Nine Palace Water Thearchs, the Twelve River Sources, the great spirits of the Vast Cold, the numinous springs and pools, the Lower Yuan Water Realm, and all mighty numina.

We have heard that the source of the vast expanse, floating earth and sky, is unfathomable. The gathering of currents and accumulation of force in the profound depths are inexhaustible. Hidden dragon spirits dwell in the grotto-palace abysses, governing retribution and fortune between the hidden and manifest realms. Moreover, we humbly rely upon the mysterious canon, fortunately completing the Register of the Yellow and the White. We record meritorious deeds, reverently following the standards of the Red Writ. We respectfully approach the pools and marshes—or, it is said, the rivers and seas—to present our supplication to the numinous perfected. May it be wished that the immortal decrees descend upon the altar, cloud chariots rein in, and that they gaze upon the altar platform, reviewing the rites performed. We, along with the fast’s sponsor, can but earnestly pray for grace, longing for the sagely presence with utmost devotion. We now humbly invoke their descent.

**Descending of the Sages**
First offering of tea and wine.

**Re-declaring the Dharma-Positions**
I, the insignificant official [Name], together with all assembled altar officers, with redoubled sincerity, reverently address the Boundless Dao, the Most High Venerables, the sun, moon, and stellar perfected, the sages of the Ten Directions, the sovereigns of the Water Palaces, the river and sea deities, the great spirits of the nether realms, the holy hosts of the river sources, and all mighty numina arrayed upon the offering altar.

Born in the lower earth, we hold humble and insignificant offices. By karmic affinity with the Dao, we have encountered this sagely dispensation. The Numinous Treasure bestows transformation, the great Dharma saves beings. We assist the state and establish merit, upholding the compassionate teachings. Today, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor [Name], for the sake of the state and family, universally extending to the living and the dead, we reverently follow the immortal statutes, performing the Register of the Yellow and the White, conducting the nine-hour Dao-recitation, and observing the five-day fast. The mat is rolled up, the altar dispersed, the rites completed, the tasks fulfilled. We humbly present the dragon tablet, reverently approaching the numinous springs, beseeching the gods and immortals to dissolve transgressions and erase sins. We knock upon the gates of the numinous perfected to extend this announcement. We now present the secondary offering, expressing the sincerity of our red hearts.

We, along with the fast’s sponsor, can but earnestly pray for grace, our devotion most fervent, bowing twice in reverence.

**Secondary Offering**
I humbly address once more the high venerables of the Three Realms, the sages of the Ten Directions, the sovereigns of the river sources, the numinous spirits of the rivers and seas, the Fusang and Yang Valley, the immortal hosts of the Water Palaces, and all mighty numina arrayed upon the offering altar.

We reverently approach the numinous springs to perform the offering rites for the sponsor of the Register of the Yellow and the White, [Name]. The fast is now complete, the tablet cast, and the covenant sealed. May it be hoped that good deeds will be recorded and merit inscribed, transgressions dissolved and faults pardoned. For the fast’s sponsor [Name], may enmities be resolved, the register of life extended, the name struck from the ledger of death and inscribed in the book of rebirth. May transgressions be expunged, and renewal granted. May the nine ancestral lineages and seven generations of forebears be delivered from the roots of suffering, escaping the dark and cold realms of Yang Valley, bathing and refining, ascending to the celestial halls. May tombs be peaceful and auspicious, calamities averted, the whole family receive blessings, spirit and qi be purified and serene, learning and understanding be keen and bright, aspirations and wisdom be complete and luminous. May the true Dharma be propagated, treachery and malice subdued, the Three Realms attain deliverance, merit fulfilled and conduct perfected. May the emperor be secure and the state prosper.

We humbly present this supplication, praying that our petition be granted as stated.

We, the officiant and the sponsor of this rite, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, bowing twice in reverence.

**Final Offering**
The announcement text is declared, the document sealed with dragon, jade, and knot, bound in silk, placed in a casket, and perfumed with incense. Nine times the teeth are clicked, the incantation of the Primordial Supreme Perfected is recited, and the document is cast into the water.

**Hymn for Casting the Dragon Document**
The Heavenly Worthy imparts precepts,
The Most High expounds the true scriptures.
To uphold the Dharma requires diligent resolve,
Merit and virtue prize the spirit’s essence.
With sincere heart, we invoke the Three Treasures,
Burning incense to petition the hundred spirits.
Inscribed names cast into the watery abode,
Meritorious deeds ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

**Re-entering the Ritual**
We, the officiant of such-and-such rank, humbly reaffirm our sincerity, reverently invoking the lofty perfected and exalted sages, the immortals of rivers and seas, the administrators of the water realms, the rulers of the lower worlds, the assembled deities of the altar, and all mighty spirits.

We announce the completion of the document presentation and the casting of the dragon document, humbly receiving fulfillment and graciously bearing witness. The perfected of the upper realms have returned to the celestial palaces, the immortals of the water palaces have each returned to their divine offices, the functionaries and messengers have all resumed their posts, the local earth deities have returned to their original ranks. Merit is recorded across the Three Realms, and blessings extend to all directions.

We, the officiant and the sponsor, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, bowing to send them forth.

**Sending Forth the Deities**
The incense is replenished. The *Hymn of Learning Immortality* is recited, offerings burned, and merit transferred.

**Rite for Casting the Earth Document**
The earth document is buried in the ground before the altar.

If preparations are made in advance, a pit three feet deep is dug at the earth gate. After the merit-recitation and petition-presentation, once the three documents have been declared, the earth document is placed in a bag, sealed with green silk, attached to a golden dragon and golden knot, and buried—eliminating the need for a separate announcement rite. If time does not permit on the night of the altar’s dispersal, a separate covenant may be made, though the rite must not be omitted. Thus, this is recorded for use as needed. The arrangement of ritual positions and sequence follows the same form as the mountain and water document rites.

**Invocation of the Supreme Three Heavens**
Here, the local earth deities, the spirits of the village and soil, and others are summoned. Proceeding directly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless Dao of the Nine Lands, the August Spirit of the Earthly Sovereign of the Great Underworld.

**Addressing the Deities by Their Titles**
We, the officiant of such-and-such rank, together with all altar officials, humbly unite our sincerity to reverently invoke the Great Dao of the Primordial Ultimate, the Three Honored Ones of the Most High, the great sage assemblies of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the Five Elder Thearchs, the thirty-six divisions of exalted scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, the perfected of the sun, moon, and stars, the celestial administrators, the Great Emperor of Fengdu, the Nine Bureaus and Three Palaces, the lords of the Yellow Springs, the boundless world, the August Spirits of the Nine Lands, the Central August Spirit of Earth, the Five Thearchs of the Earthly Bureau, the officials of the Three Realms, the local earth deities, and all mighty spirits.

We have heard that the nine lands and nine regions are fathomless in their depths, the six heavens of the yin realms vast and boundless. Above stand the perfected of the Five Peaks, below are the myriad spirits in their offices, extending to the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, the immortal realms and sacred mountains—all establish bureaus to weigh sins and blessings, dividing governance over the registers of living beings. Moreover, in conducting this rite of purification, it is fitting to make covenant.

Reverently approaching the numinous altar, we beseech your lofty scrutiny. May celestial radiance descend to illuminate, divine chariots arrive from afar, this rite’s merit be inscribed, and our sincere prayers recorded.

We, the officiant and the sponsor, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, bowing twice in earnest supplication.

**Inviting the Sages**
The initial offering of tea and wine is made.

**Re-addressing the Deities by Their Titles**
We, the officiant of such-and-such rank, together with all altar officials, humbly reaffirm our sincerity to reverently invoke the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Honored Ones, the perfected of the sun, moon, and stars, the exalted sages of the ten directions, the celestial administrators, the underworld officials, the august immortals of the Nine Lands, the assembled deities of the altar, and all mighty spirits.

We, though of humble qi and foolish nature, have by past karma encountered the true Dharma and auspicious causes. At the revelation of the *Lingbao* scriptures and the proclamation of the Red Writs, we, though unworthy and defiled, have reverently served the Orthodox Perfected, assisting the state and the times, establishing merit and propagating the teachings.

Now, on behalf of the Yellow Register sponsor so-and-so, we conduct the great Yellow Register purification rite, dedicating it to the state and universally delivering the living and the dead, seeking blessings and beseeching grace, dispelling calamities and repenting transgressions. For five days the rite is held, nine audiences completed, the altar dispersed, and the work fulfilled.

We humbly present the dragon document, reverently approaching the numinous altar, daring to reveal our sincere hearts and beseech your divine scrutiny. We dare to present the secondary offering to express our utmost sincerity.

We, the officiant and the sponsor, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, bowing twice in earnest supplication.

**Secondary Offering**
We, the officiant of such-and-such rank, humbly reaffirm our sincerity to reverently invoke the lofty perfected of the Three Realms, the exalted sages of the ten directions, the earthly administrators, the august spirits of the Nine Lands, the assembled deities of the altar, and all true spirits.

Reverently approaching the numinous altar, we conduct this rite of offering on behalf of the Yellow Register sponsor so-and-so. With the purification rite completed, we cast the document and make covenant.

May good deeds be recorded and transgressions pardoned. For the sponsor, may disasters be resolved and grievances absolved. We beseech the erasure of the earth document to remove the record of sins. May vows be fulfilled and lives preserved, the body safeguarded.

In the Nine Elder Immortal Capitals, may names be inscribed in the Jade Register. For the nine generations of ancestors, parents, kin of the womb and seed, the previously and recently departed, may all enjoy blessed causes, escape the nine darknesses below and the eight gates’ realms, calamities dissolved, tombs and homes purified, evil roots severed, and ascent to the halls of blessing achieved.

May our studies be perfected, our merit and conduct resplendent, sharing in the same fortune in life and death, forever preserved without peril. May the emperor receive blessings, the world know peace.

We beseech the fulfillment of these wishes, humbly making covenant.

We, the officiant and the sponsor, prostrate ourselves in utmost reverence, bowing twice.

**Final Offering**
The announcement text is declared.

The document is sealed with a dragon, jade tablet, and knot, bound with silk into the document pouch, placed in a casket, and fumigated with incense. Nine times the teeth are clicked, and the incantation of Heaven and Earth’s opening is recited. The document is cast into the earth and buried within the altar. Choose an auspicious day under the lunar mansion to open the pit and inter the document.

**Hymn of Casting the Dragon Tablet**
The ritual work is now complete,
The talismanic command announced to the sacred altar.
Jade tablets bear our sincere devotion,
Golden dragons swiftly transmit the pledge.
With reverent hearts we look to the Central Palace,
Returning our lives to the Yellow Circle.
In life and death, all find joy,
Soon to bow before the Heavenly Countenance.

**Second Rite**
The officiant, your humble servant [Name], respectfully reaffirms sincerity and petitions the exalted perfected, the supreme sages, the immortals of the nine earths, the administrators of the earthly treasury, the lords of mountains and peaks, the deities arrayed at the ritual feast, and all mighty spirits.

We announce the conclusion of the document presentation and the completion of the dragon tablet casting. Humbly we receive the fulfillment of our work, graciously granted your observation. The ten thousand perfected have ascended to the jade heavens, the host of sages have each returned to the central realms, the officers have resumed their posts, and the local deities have returned to their ranks. Blessings extend to all sentient beings, and grace covers all without exception.

We, the officiant and the sponsor, overwhelmed with gratitude and longing, now humbly bid farewell.

**Hymn of Sending Forth the Deities**
The incense is replenished.
The *Hymn of Studying Immortality* is recited, the offerings burned, and merit dedicated.

The method of casting the three documents is fundamentally for receiving the Central Covenant, for scholars seeking immortality, for erasing sins and casting documents to inform the Three Origins. If used for one’s own receipt of registers, the section concerning the sponsor’s construction of the Yellow Register retreat is omitted, and the following is appended:

Your servant [Name], in the year and month, respectfully approaches the Master of the Three Caverns [Name], to receive the *Five Elders’ True Writ of the Red Script*, the *Inner Sounds of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries*, the *Registers of Immortals and Two Talismans*, the *Eight Mighty Writs*, the *Five Emperor Talismans*, the *Central Covenant Scriptures*, and other texts. Upon completion of transmission, the dragon tablets are cast upon the sacred mountain, the water tablet into the clear spring, and the earth tablet into the central palace. The golden dragon swiftly transmits the plea to erase the records of sin. The remainder follows the same rite.

For cultivators of the Dao, on the Three Origins and Eight Festivals, to repent sins and invoke the perfected, the *Red Script Tablets of the Five Elders* are cast. The *True Writ Jade Instructions* are produced, and the document records the officiant’s title, the year, month, day, and hour of birth, the ruling deity of one’s fate, the mountain to which one’s name is tied, and the vows to become a spirit, an immortal, to attain eternal life, transcend the world, and ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Perfected of the Five Peaks, most divine and numinous,
We beseech the erasure of sin records and the inscription of names in the Nine Heavens.
We petition the sacred mountain, the golden dragon swiftly transmitting.
In the year, month, and first day of the Tai Sui, the announcement is made at [Location].

For the earth and water tablets, follow the Yellow Register document format, recording only the officiant’s title and birth details. The sealing, dragon, jade tablet, knot, and silk binding proceed as before. At the ritual site, the casting is performed.

For the first casting, each document uses nine golden knots. For the second and third castings, only the dragon tablet is used, without knots.

The detailed procedures for Daoists casting documents are compiled according to the scriptures and have been presented in the *Jade Writ True Seal Chapter*; they are not repeated here. In the *Rites of Master Guangcheng*, after the earth tablet of the Yellow Register sponsor is read to declare merit, once the recitation is complete, it may be buried in the altar the next morning without further notification.

Here, following the method of Master Zhang Chengxian, the three-document petitions differ in the ranks of the perfected addressed, hence their inclusion again. If within the ritual altar, after the merit declaration and incantation, the documents may be cast immediately. This refers to burial immediately after recitation. For the mountain and water tablets, though the merit declaration is complete, if a ritual is held at the grotto, the sequence should be followed: recite the sealing incantation again before casting, ensuring thoroughness. One must not, having completed the altar announcement, proceed directly to casting at the mountain or grotto, lest the local spirits fail to receive the message. The merit may not reach them, resulting in great loss.

It is further said:
To deliver the good men and women of all heavenly realms from the Three Evils, Five Paths, and Eight Difficulties, enabling them to pass beyond the Three Evils and meet the Dao in every lifetime, on the Eight Festivals and Jiazi days, cast the three jade tablets to erase the records of past sins. Declare the merit to the heavens, and the matter will be transmitted three times through the Three Officials, Nine Treasuries, and various heavens, each relaying the message upward. All spirits will respect and protect, the Five Emperors will attend and guard, the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome, and the gates will be purified. The deities of heaven and earth, the sun and moon, will come to pay homage, while thousands of demons and myriad spirits dare not intrude. Wishes will be firmly established, and all endeavors will succeed. The seven generations of ancestors and parents will be liberated, ascending from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings to the heavenly halls. The blessings of life and death, good and evil, will be repaid in kind. The Three Officials and Nine Treasuries record human merits and transgressions, the principles clear, with karmic connections spanning lifetimes, leaving no detail unaccounted.

For the noble, the emperor, the ruler of the land, officials, all people, and the nine generations of ancestors languishing in the Three Paths, perform the great Yellow Register retreat for three days and nights. Pledge allegiance to the Nine Heavens, cast documents to the Three Origins, and the blessings and benefits will be immeasurable.

Listen carefully and practice diligently; do not be negligent, lest demons corrupt your body.

Master Daoist Zhang Chengxian says: Upon ascending the altar and receiving the Central Covenant of the *Numinous Treasure*, follow the *Scripture of Spontaneity* and cast ten golden knots, then the dragon tablet into the clear spring, as the path to immortality. Upon re-ascending the altar to receive the *Red Script of the Five Elders*, the *Two Registers and Staff of the Eight Mighty Writs*, and the *Vows of Resolute Faith*, follow the covenant’s true rite and cast three dragons with twenty-seven knots at the mountain, water, and dwelling, as tokens of the quest for immortality. Then, according to the *Jade Instructions*, separately cast nine dragons with twenty-seven knots on the Eight Festival days at the mountain, water, and dwelling, to erase the Black Registers, report names to heaven, and seek the removal of sin records.

Upon completing the Yellow Register retreat, cast the dragon tablet following the Three Origins document format.

Thus, these three memorials for the mountain, water, and dwelling each address their respective immortal bureaus, ensuring the erasure of sins, the inscription of names in the Nine Mysteries, and the elevation of one’s entire household to honor.

It is further said: The Great Dao, through the singular *qi*, transforms and gives rise to the Three Realms, shaping the myriad existences. Therefore, the Three Origins’ courts were established to govern transgressions and blessings—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who truly preside over the Three Origins. Human life and death, longevity and premature demise, blessings and misfortunes, good and evil, fortune and calamity—all are bound to them. The Three Registers are likewise the canonical works of the Three Origins. The method of retreat requires casting three tablets to petition the Three Origins: the mountain tablet is offered to the celestial grottoes and palaces, presented to the Heavenly Official of the Upper Origin; the water tablet is cast into the numinous White Water Prefecture, addressed to the Water Official of the Lower Origin; and the earth tablet is placed at the altar or dwelling, directed to the Earth Official of the Middle Origin. Within the details of the tablet texts, the titles of the true spirits and the principles of the matter are made manifest and clear.

Now, the Primordial Beginning settled and stabilized, unfolding the Five Scriptures. Thus, the Five Elder Lords received the *Red Writs of True Text*, anchoring the root of Heaven and the source of Earth, descending to guard the Five Peaks and establish the Five Directions. This is indeed the root and origin of the *Lingbao* tradition, the pivot of salvation for humanity. Those who study the higher Way, aspiring to the Dao and seeking immortality, transmit the scriptures of the Middle Covenant and bear the *Lingbao* registers. They all inscribe the *Red Writs of True Text* in cinnabar upon hibiscus-wood tablets, write the memorials on their faces, and cast them into mountains, rivers, and dwellings, thereby forging covenants with the Three Realms and severing the roots of sin. Even at the Five Peaks, tablets are cast and dragons dispatched to extinguish transgressions and dissolve faults—this is their fundamental purpose. The matter is recorded in the *True Writs*, *Jade Instructions*, and various scriptures.

When conducting a retreat to establish a Yellow Register altar, upon the conclusion of the altar’s dissolution rites, one petitions with the three tablets for mountain, earth, and water, accompanied by golden dragons, golden knots, and jade disks, to record and inscribe the merits of the retreat and address the Three Origins. This method truly derives from and employs the *Red Writs*. Since Master Zhang Chengxian of the Tang compiled the *Retreat Regulations*, it has been explained in detail. When Master Guangcheng later compiled the *Yellow Register Retreat Regulations*, he exhaustively described the origins and ends of the *Red Writs* and the canonical forms of tablet-casting, rendering the matter luminously clear and beyond doubt.

In recent times, many have appended a talisman after each of the three tablets. Yet, as the transmitted ritual texts differ among individuals, so too do the talisman forms. How can one not know that the original intent of tablet-casting lies in the *Red Writs*—can it be practiced otherwise? Thus, the incantation for the mountain tablet reads:

*"Mysterious and luminous above, the Primordial Beginning oversees the true. The Five Elder Lords, the Red Writs in cinnabar. The origin of Heaven and Earth, governing the Three Origins."*

The incantation for the water tablet reads:

*"The Primordial Beginning and Five Elders, the exalted Lords of the Supreme. The perfected of the ten directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua. The Red Writs proclaim the mandate, penetrating all, even the hidden."*

The incantation for the earth tablet reads:

*"Heaven and Earth unfold, the Nine *Qi* divide their numen. The grottoes of the Three Origins, the ten directions radiantly pure. The Five Elder Lords, opening the true and guiding life. The cinnabar writings of the Red Writs, the Primordial Beginning of the Highest Clarity."*

The openings of all three incantations clearly invoke the *Red Writs of the Five Elders*. Now, to replace them with other talismans in tablet-casting is to deviate from the original intent, especially when the incantations no longer align. Therefore, here we adhere strictly to the scriptural principles: the memorials follow the ancient forms, and the true texts after the tablets employ the *Red Writs of the Five Elders*. In meaning and text, they serve as the tokens of tablet-casting. This derives from the orthodox scriptures, unlike the private manuals of later masters.

Though ritual texts may vary by lineage, their fundamental forms must not be altered. Tablet-casting directly concerns the courts of the Three Officials, where the weight of transgressions and blessings is profound—particular care must be taken. All procedures for tablet-casting and memorial petitions follow the *Retreat Regulations* of Master Guangcheng. However, as these texts have circulated for ages, errors and omissions have crept in through transmission, often reducing them to mere opening and closing invocations. The core method remains akin to the *Jiao* rites. Such incomplete transcriptions force the officiant to improvise, risking errors in the moment.

To prevent this, the present text meticulously records the sequence: the proclamation of incantations, the kindling of the incense burner, the invocation of the gods, the three offerings, and the sealing of the burner—all in accordance with the *Jiao* rites, ensuring smooth execution. Written as a ritual manual, it facilitates recitation and avoids impropriety. The wording adheres entirely to the texts of Master Guangcheng.

*Transmission and Ordination with the Retreat Rites*

The Dao of *Lingbao* rightfully belongs to *Dongxuan*. Yet it encompasses the pivotal mechanisms of the Three Caverns and embraces the profound mysteries of all scriptures. From the time when the Perfected One Xulai transmitted it to Lord Ge Xuan, the teachings gradually became manifest. When King Xiaodao bestowed it upon Xu Jingsun, the ritual codes and methods reached full completion. It can stabilize heaven and earth, safeguard the state and secure the household, deliver the dead and rescue the living, dispel evil and uphold the upright, inwardly refine form and qi, outwardly gather the myriad spirits, effortlessly attain spontaneity, and merge indistinguishably with the Dao.

Thus, it is transmitted only to those deemed worthy; it is not passed on to the unfit. The scriptures state: *"The most devoted offer gold and treasures to express their sincerity, swearing an oath to heaven before transmission."* They also say: *"If there is one of utmost devotion who offers gold and treasures to pledge sincerity, following the old protocols to swear an oath before the Ten Heavens, only then shall it be conferred."* The presentation of tokens serves to embody sincerity, while the oath to heaven serves to solidify the vow. Between master and disciple, they drink cinnabar in place of blood pacts and divide a ring to signify their shared covenant. Though gold and treasures may be gathered, the heart must follow—proof of sincerity cannot be lacking. Those who are wealthy yet stingy are unworthy of transmission. Those who dwell in poverty yet delight in the Dao need not offer gold.

However, since the middle ages, as the Three Caverns have spread, the rules of transmission and reception have followed a graded sequence. Study proceeds in order; one must not presumptuously advance. First, one must receive the secret registers of all ranks of the *Dongshen* division and practice the various methods of *Zhengyi*. With unwavering resolve and merit in aiding others, one may then approach the ancestral altar to receive the secret registers of the *Zhongmeng* rank and advance to the highest grade of *Dongxuan*. Only then may one request sponsors and supervisors for ordination, submit a petition to the master, record it in the heavens, notify the Three Realms, and hold the altar rites for transmission, promotion, and practice.

The so-called oath before the Ten Heavens refers to invoking the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthies* of the ten directions and swearing an oath to heaven. The division of the contract and breaking of the ring pertain to the oath between master and disciple, not to the division of contracts with the Heavenly Worthies. Thus, there are the *Three Sovereigns’* wooden tablets and the *Simwei* contract for stabilizing resolve. As this pertains to the general teachings of the ancestral altar, such ritual objects should be issued along with the registers. They are not elaborated here to avoid overstepping the transmission protocols.

Following the *Lingbao* scriptural regulations, the *Five Numinous Tablets* and the *Staff of Authority* are to be used in accordance with the respective methods. The seals, swords, certificates, and promotions of this Dharma are not lightly bestowed in transmission rites, for they honor the primacy of the scriptural tradition. Thus, the Dharma concludes with transmission and ordination.

The disciple who inherits the Dharma must first secure sponsors and ordination supervisors before presenting incense and tokens before the master, submitting a petition that states:

*"The Dharma-rank holder, [Disciple’s Surname and Given Name], born on the [Day, Month, Year, and Hour] of [Disciple’s] original destiny, hailing from [State, County, Ward, and Residence]."*

Mindful that I, [Disciple’s Surname and Given Name], have long been nurtured by karmic blessings and refined through the transformative power of the True, I now bear the talismans and registers, standing in rank among the ordained. Formerly, I received transmission of [specific Dharma] from my ordination master, [Master’s Name], and have upheld it for some time, humbly sustained by his protection. Deeply ashamed of my lack of merit, I dare not falter in diligence. With reverence, I present the Dharma tokens and pour forth my sincerest devotion, bowing before the master’s sanctuary to petition for the transmission of the *Shangqing Lingbao* Great Dharma, including its talismans, charts, seals, and oral instructions. Should I receive this transmission, I vow to devote myself to its cultivation, redouble my resolve, and join in exalting the Mysterious Design, striving to propagate the Great Teaching. If, after receiving the Dharma, I were to lightly disclose or profane it, transmit it to unworthy recipients, fail to uphold its true and orthodox nature, mingle it with heterodoxy, violate my oaths, or betray my vows—thereby incurring the resentment of the Dao and the wrath of my master—then may I alone suffer the punishment of wind and blade, and may my nine generations of ancestors share the condemnation of Mount Feng.

I hereby submit this petition, with the endorsement of my sponsor, [Sponsor’s Name]; my ordination supervisor, [Supervisor’s Name]; and my ordination master, [Master’s Name]. Humbly I beseech the master’s compassion to record this transmission in the Celestial Register, file the petition with the Three Realms’ respective true bureaus, and open the altar for the transmission rite. Respectfully submitted.

[Year, Month, Day] by the Dharma-rank holder, [Disciple’s Surname and Given Name].

Upon receiving the petition, the ordination master shall invoke the August Thearchs and Perfected Ones, submit the petition for their consideration, and file it with the Three Realms.

**Petition Template**

The Dharma-rank holder, your humble servant [Surname and Given Name], with awe and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the throne:

Your servant, unworthy though I am of my rank among the numinous hosts, has long lacked virtuous conduct. I ought to reflect upon myself rather than presume to engage with others. Yet as the Teaching demands propagation, its affairs cannot be suppressed. Thus, I dare to present my humble sentiments, venturing to address the lofty heavens.

Your humble servant, holder of the Dharma-rank, respectfully submits this petition on behalf of the disciple of the register [Register Name], [Surname and Given Name], who hails from [Native Place] and holds the Dharma-office. With reverence, I report that this disciple was born in the year, month, day, and hour of his own fate, and is now in his [Age] year of life. Previously, he sought a master and received the transmission of the Orthodox Dharma. Having passed some time since then, he has fortunately been nurtured by the powers of life and growth, and has from time to time attained communion with the numinous. Now, he aspires to receive and transmit the Great Dharma of the Supreme Clarity and Numinous Treasure, dedicating himself to its cultivation and vowing to deliver both the manifest and the hidden. Should he ever reveal it to unworthy persons, thereby confounding the Orthodox with the false and the heterodox, he willingly accepts the severe punishment of Mount Feng and offers no plea in defense. Given this steadfast sincerity, it is fitting that the transmission be granted.

Your servant proposes to promote and appoint [Name] as a disciple of the Middle Alliance of the Numinous Treasure, serving as an officer in the Southern Bureau of Dharma Execution. At the risk of death, I record this petition and submit it to Your August Majesty. I humbly beseech the sagely compassion of the Heavenly Dao to grant my request, allowing me to confer the appointment and proceed with the transmission.

Your servant, having dared to offend the majesty of the Celestial Throne, trembles with awe and trepidation, awaiting punishment with utmost urgency and anxiety.

Respectfully submitted.
On the [Day] of the [Month] in the year of the Great Year Star [Year], your humble servant, holder of the Dharma-rank, [Surname and Given Name], presents this petition.

Among the seven petitions above, those that may be omitted for each august presence are to be enclosed in separate envelopes and all delivered to the Celestial Pivot Bureau, to be forwarded as follows:

- To the *Nine Celestial Emperors* (nine petitions);
- To the *Thirty-Two Heavens* (thirty-two petitions);
- To the *Lord of the Wood* (one petition);
- To the *Queen Mother of the West* (one petition).

This servant, daring to offend the True Majesty, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted,
On the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year] of the Great Era,
The Dharma-rank holder [Surname and Given Name].

**To:**
The August and Sagely Nine Imperial Star Lords of the Northern Dipper of the Central Heaven. *One petition.*

The Heavenly Official Emperor of the Upper Prime,
The Earthly Official Emperor of the Middle Prime,

The Great Demon King of the Three Realms. *One petition.*

The Five Emperor Demon Kings. *One petition.*

The above twelve petitions are of uniform format. Whether submitted as separate or combined petitions, there is no distinction in weight or precedence. However, as each is governed by its respective celestial bureau, they must be presented to their respective offices. Thus, petitions to distinct bureaus—such as the separate palaces of the sun and moon or the divided administrations of the Three Officials—cannot be combined but must be submitted separately.

Additionally, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions require ten separate memorials, each following the same intent as the petitions above. Their formats are not further detailed here.

*Petition format.*

The undersigned [Name], of [such-and-such] native place and rank, respectfully states the following, in accordance with the intent of the memorial as previously described, and hereby submits this petition for recording and presentation.

Respectfully submitted to the Most Sagely Northern Dipper Nine August Star Lords of the Central Heavenly Great Sage.

May the true compassion of the Perfected Ones grant this petition, that it may be presented to the Supreme Mystery, promulgated throughout the Three Realms, and enacted in accordance with the law.

Furthermore, we humbly beseech your merciful consideration to permit transmission and ordination.

Respectfully submitted.

Beyond these prescribed forms, for any additional deities in attendance, or for the various bureaus, officials, generals, and departments, those of the same rank shall be addressed in a single petition. Any omissions, issuances of passes, or summonses shall be reported in the appropriate memorial or official dispatch.

*Ritual Requisites for Transmission and Ordination:*
Two silver rings, each two cun and four fen in diameter.
Uninscribed, save for the engraved signature (*hua ya*) of the Preceptor.

One silver dragon-headed writing knife.
Forged of steel and iron, with a blade six cun in length, its hilt fashioned as a dragon’s head.

One yellow silk ordination certificate (*quan wen*).
Nine cun in height, seven chi and two cun in length.

Three zhen-cai silks, totaling thirty-six chi in length:
Nine chi of blue, three chi of red, seven chi of white, five chi of black, and twelve chi of yellow.

Zhen-tan rice: three dou and six sheng.
Zhen-tan coins: three thousand six hundred wen.

One ming-cai silk, the color corresponding to the life-sign of the dharma-successor disciple. A full bolt is acceptable regardless of measure, or it may follow the year’s reckoning.

*Form of the Numinous Writ and True Certificate:*
Inscribed with the rank, title, and name of the Preceptor, with his signature (*ya*).
Year and month of the Great Year as above. By the Mysterious Statutes and Ordinances, let it be as one with the Cavernous Mystery’s supplementary appointment and receipt of office.

The right half of the divided certificate, matching the left, is hereby conferred upon [Name] as successor in the Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure, advancing in rank.

*Vermilion Seal Script of the Central Numinous Writ:*
Written in reverse from right to left, in seal script as recorded in the *Jade Script Seal Compendium*. This certificate must be issued.

All heavens escort and receive, having appointed [Name] as fully ordained dharma-successor disciple, newly appointed to the rank and title of office. Through perpetual filial devotion and loyal service, may nine generations of ancestors receive blessings. The numinous writ is herewith bestowed, in accordance with the statutes for succession in the Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure. Advancing in rank within the Cavernous Mystery, ascending to the office of immortal official.

*Under the Three Heavens’ Southern Bureau:*
Under the Three Heavens’ Southern Bureau, in accordance with the statutes for succession in the Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure, advancing in rank within the Cavernous Mystery, ascending to the office of immortal official. Through perpetual filial devotion and loyal service, may nine generations of ancestors receive blessings. The numinous writ is herewith bestowed. All heavens escort and receive, having appointed [Name] as fully ordained dharma-successor disciple, newly appointed to the rank and title of office. This certificate must be issued.

The matching true certificate is hereby conferred upon the disciple [Name], to be kept and worn. Henceforth, the five sufferings shall be wholly dissolved, the three evils entirely absolved, sinful records forever erased, and the name inscribed in the register of higher rebirth. Through kalpas unending, may life endure, coeval with heaven.

Hasten! As the Most High commands.

Year and month of the Great Year as above.
Endorsed by the Recommending Preceptor: [Name] with signature (*ya*).
Witnessed by the Supervising Preceptor: [Name] with signature (*ya*).
Conferred by the Preceptor: [Name] with signature (*ya*).

This is the true certificate of the Numinous Treasure’s original dharma, divided before heaven. The right half is retained by the Preceptor, while the left half is placed in a pouch and given to the dharma-successor disciple. Should the Preceptor not retain it, the right half may instead be submitted with a memorial to the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Pivot Bureau for verification, serving as proof of the disciple’s cultivation of immortality and study of the Dao.

To erase the record of sins and inscribe the name in the register of higher rebirth, revise the closing lines of the right half as follows:

The right half of the Numinous Writ and True Certificate is hereby conferred upon the dharma-register disciple [Name], successor in the Supreme Clarity Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure, advancing in rank within the Cavernous Mystery, appointed to office and receiving the transmission. Upon completion of the transmission rites, the certificate is drawn to seal the covenant, eradicating the roots of evil, dissolving the records of transgressions, and ensuring the disciple’s cultivation of immortality and study of the Dao shall attain perfect fulfillment. Praying for enactment in accordance with the Mysterious Statutes.

Year and month as in the preceding form.

*Form of the Rings.*

The ring serves to manifest the solemn vow, akin to the ancient practice of casting jade tablets in covenant. The ring itself is originally round and uninscribed. In contemporary altar traditions, however, the preceptor affixes their signature upon it, and the same is done during dharma transmissions. The ancients, embracing simplicity and eschewing adornment, valued plainness in all matters. Yet when the Perfected Official of the Dao compiled the *Orthodox Methods of the Celestial Heart*, inscriptions were added to the ring. Its text reads:

*"The Orthodox Methods of the Celestial Heart,
Revered by the myriad spirits,
Transmitted in covenant with Heaven,
Cyclic and unending."*

This, too, reflects the purpose of the ring, though it departs from ancient forms. As the Numinous Treasure constitutes the highest rank of the Cavernous Mystery, it should not follow common custom. The ring signifies the vow of fidelity. When Master Lu presided over the altar to divide the certificate, he did not split the ring, implying that once the certificate is divided and the covenant sealed, the ring need not be sundered. The disciple wears the ring to uphold the unbroken vow. Those of profound discernment should deliberate carefully on this practice.

*Form of the Inscribing Knife*
The inscribing knife is forged from steel as a sharp blade, its upper half sheathed in silver shaped as a dragon’s head. The same form is used for presenting memorials, its edge serving to correct errors. For dividing certificates, a blade is especially necessary. Modern practitioners fashion these from silver leaf, which is incorrect.

*Form of the Appointment Document*

**Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure**

Upon verification of the petition submitted by the disciple of the register of transmitted methods, [Name], of such-and-such native place and lineage, the Bureau finds:

Born under the original destiny of his person on the year, month, day, and hour recorded, he has long relied upon good causes and received the refining transformation of the True. Having presumptuously practiced the Orthodox Rites and been recklessly enrolled among the ranks of the Numinous, he now steadfastly offers his sincere devotion and presents his earnest sincerity. Previously, he had already submitted a petition to the ancestral altar and been promoted to receive the secret registers of the Middle Covenant. Now, he wishes to advance further in transmission, receiving the talismans, charts, seals, and oral instructions of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Clarity, pledging himself to reverent observance. His vow is to succor the hidden and manifest, to sever poison and expel demons, and to assist the Dao and aid transformation.

Should he dare to intermingle heterodoxy or falsehood, confuse sacred texts, recklessly transmit to the unworthy, or frivolously divulge celestial treasures, he willingly offers his person in atonement to Heaven and Earth and the Three Officials of the Water Bureau.

As his oath is firm and unwavering, his sincerity unshaken, and his qualifications meet the standards for propagation, it is fitting to receive and guide him. Having already recorded and memorialized this before the Three Heavenly Thearchs and submitted documents to the true bureaus of the Three Realms, the altar shall be opened in accordance with the proper form, and the transmission shall be conferred facing Heaven. It is hereby ordered that his appointment be processed, and he be granted the secret texts of the original rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Clarity, along with the requisite seal, sword, scepter, and staff. The following items shall be itemized and issued by official document:

1. The petitioner, having already received the secret registers of the Middle Covenant, now advances to transmit the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure. In accordance with the statutes and regulations, he shall be promoted to the position of **Executive Officer of the Southern Bureau, Enforcer of the Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Middle Covenant**.

2. One set of the **Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Supreme Clarity** shall be issued.

1. Issue the following seals:
   - One seal of the **Bureau of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure**,
   - One **General Petition Seal**,
   - One **Supreme Petition Seal**,
   - One **Yellow Spirit Seal**,
   - Three **Divine Tiger Seals**.

2. Issue the **Sword of the Eight Radiant Spirits**, measuring three feet and six inches in length.

3. Issue the **Five-Spirit Scepter-Staff**, to be carried and held in accordance with the statutes and rituals.

4. In accordance with the regulations, grant the **Disciples of the Cavern Mystery** the following:
   - A **Lotus Crown**,
   - A **Purple Robe**,
   - A **Yellow Skirt** with thirty-two strips and a **Yellow Cloak**,
   - A **Luminous Jade Scepter**,
   - **Jade Pendants**,
   - **Red Sandals**.

5. The **Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure** belong to the **Cavern Mystery** and serve as the pivot of the **Three Caverns**, constituting the supreme method of the **Middle Vehicle**. Their dignity and sanctity surpass ordinary regulations. All petitions, receipts, and administrations must be reported to the **Five Constant Demon Kings of the Three Realms**, and in accordance with the rites, official documents shall be sent to the **Flying Heavenly Divine Kings** of the respective domains. Whenever talismans or consecrated water are issued, the **Divine Kings** shall be dispatched, along with their subordinate **Envoys, Officers, and Soldiers**, to carry out the issuance and bestowal. The **Numinous Treasure** shall be served by the **General of Accordant Will**, who shall oversee the execution of duties.

6. When presenting memorials, entering the chamber for meditation, paying homage to the Emperors, and flying the spirit to initiate affairs; when burning incense, reciting scriptures, and praying for divine assistance; and when summoning and employing divine spirits, the following shall be duly invoked:
   - The **Three and Five Merit Officials**,
   - The **Left and Right Envoys**,
   - The **Golden Lads of Incense**,
   - The **Jade Maidens of Flower Scattering**,
   - The **True Talismans of the Five Emperors**,
   - The **Incense Officials of the Day**.
   They shall act in accordance with the rites and serve in accordance with the seals. Once the task is completed, they shall return to their original positions and respond to summons as required.

7. When summoning and capturing wandering souls, the following shall be dispatched in accordance with the statutes:
   - The **Divine Tigers**, the **Two Great Saints He and Qiao**,
   - The **Envoys of the Three Departments for the Pursuit of Souls**,
   - The **Jade Maidens of the Seven Offices**,
   bearing talismans and documents to carry out the task.

8. When performing purification rites and setting up altars, proclamations and talismans shall be issued, and the **Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions** shall be invoked to descend. The **Talisman Envoys for Summoning the True and Divine**, the **Couriers of the Golden Dragon of the Mysterious Capital**, and the **Jade Dragon Post** shall receive the talismans and carry out the proclamations. Once the task is complete, they shall promptly return to their original ranks.

9. The **Divine Officials of the Numinous Treasure**, the **Jade Lads and Jade Maidens**, the **Heavenly Generals**, and the **Immortal Soldiers** are subordinate to the **Supreme Mystery** and are not ordinary functionaries. In accordance with the scriptures and regulations, they shall be invoked as needed to assist in the performance of rites. The **Dharma Master** must not shout, scold, or point at them, for these spirits are not bound to the mundane world or registered in the registers. One must purify the mind, regulate the breath, recite incantations, burn talismans, visualize with focused gaze, and secretly summon and employ them. Once the task is complete, each shall return to their original rank.

10. Any unauthorized claims of divine officers, arbitrary establishment of immortal bureaus, or mixing of vulgar practices with scriptural rites are strictly forbidden. Those who violate these precepts and杂用杂法 shall be forsaken by the oaths sworn to Heaven. Thus, the **True Scripture of Admonitions for the Emperor’s Brush** was compiled from the **Four Translations**, serving as the essential canon of the **Three Caverns**. It harmonizes Heaven and stabilizes Earth, bringing fortune to the state and peace to the family. Revered by a thousand sages, its benefits extend not only to the manifest and the hidden. Serving as a model for all directions, its blessings endure through past and present.

The dharma-successor disciple [Name], holding the rank of *Dongxuan* and transmitting the *Lingbao* scriptures, has privately sworn oaths and completed the transmission. The matter is not trivial, and the office is most weighty. One must forever steadfastly maintain singular resolve, secretly refine the hundred spirits, examine oneself and cultivate the body, never transgressing the statutes nor violating the precepts. In aiding others and benefiting all things, one ought to establish virtue and build merit. The Five Emperors and Great Demons observe one’s diligence or indolence; the Three Officials and Capital Prisons expose one’s faults and transgressions. Be meticulous, secretive, and devoted: when the ten thousand *qi* are whole, the Three Heavens bestow their summons. Be careless in leakage or negligent in reverence, and one’s own body shall fall while nine generations suffer abandonment. Maintain constancy in observance—let this admonition never be forgotten.

Thus, this document is issued.
*Dated: [Year], [Month], [Day] of the Great Year-Star.*

**Guarantor and Recommending Master:** [Full Rank, Name] (seal)
**Supervising Transmission Master:** [Full Rank, Name] (seal)
**Transmission Master:** [Full Rank, Name] (seal)
**Register Master:** [Full Rank, Name] (deceased, no seal)
**Scripture Master:** [Full Rank, Name]

For transmission rites conducted alongside fasts and offerings, if the host is of sufficient means, a prior petition shall be submitted in advance. On the evening before, an imperial edict-water purification of the altar shall be performed, with the fast’s procedures observed as in standard ritual. At dawn the following day, the altar shall be ascended to commence the rites. Over three periods, the Dao shall be practiced, the Perfected invoked in repentance, and gratitude expressed. The *Lingbao* three-day ritual texts may be employed. An evening offering for transmission is especially fitting. Yet, all too often, worldly practitioners limit transmission rites to mere offerings. Therefore, the present text sets forth the full transmission-offering liturgy, which constitutes the proper transmission of the dharma—an affair of this very tradition, not of the *Huanglu* rites. The details are as follows:

The offering mat is arranged with the Supreme Emperor at the center, flanked by attendant sages—either sixty or one hundred twenty in number. The Three Treasures’ stations are set in the middle, with the imperial brush placed as in fast-altar protocol. The Five Masters’ tent is erected to the left of the altar. The Perfected Lord of Wondrous Merit and Salvation, the *Taiji* Penetrating Responsive Immortal, is positioned to the right; alternatively, the Five Masters and these two may share a single tent. Petitions and memorials for the offering are arrayed before the masters, then dispatched.

The Daoist assembly stands in ranks before the masters. The *Zhiqing* initiates the ritual proceedings, while the *Gaogong* and the disciple each offer incense and bow. The *Gaogong* kneels to receive the memorial. The assembly bears the petitions in grand procession to the dispatching site, where a ritual officer recites incantations and performs purification. The *Zhiqing* initiates the ritual proceedings. The *Gaogong* burns the *Jiangzhen Zhaoling* talisman to transform the spirits and summon the generals. Next, the initial offering is announced. Then, the second offering is announced. Finally, the third offering concludes the rites. The transmission document is proclaimed. The *Gaogong* dispatches the missives. The disciple performs the libation. The burnt offerings are consumed. The preceding is concluded. Dedication and recitation of merits follow. The evening offering proceeds as usual.

**Rites for Transmission During Fasts**
**Protocol for Transmission Offerings During Fasts**

A Daoist of authority, one in number, performs the consecration of the altar and the exorcism of water. Next, within the offering hall, the Dipper Lamp is lit, and the *Huaxia* hymn leads the procession. The High Priest emerges from the oratory and stands in rank before the master. The High Priest and the disciple offer incense and bow in reverence.

Next, the fast is observed, and the master, the Mystic Master, the Heavenly Master, and the Preceptors of the Scriptures and Registers—Xu and Ge—are invited. The Cloud Chariot is raised. The High Priest kneels in reverence and makes the invocation. The *Hymn of the Dao* is chanted. Led by the *Huaxia* hymn, the High Priest approaches the offering altar, enters the Earthly Gate, ascends the Heavenly Portal, offers incense to the Ten Directions, presents incense at the Imperial Table, burns the talismans for summoning and invocation, and recites the secret incantations. Kneeling in reverence, incense is offered at his proper station. The Master of Ceremonies announces the commencement.

"I have heard that the hidden fusion of primordial *qi* first took form in the chaos of the beginning. The division of the Three Powers drew sustenance from the vast primordial kalpa. The mysterious grace is universally bestowed, the Dao’s sheltering shade encompasses all, the bellows and keys regulate *yin* and *yang*, and the potter’s wheel shapes humanity and all beings. Thus, there is no darkness it does not illuminate, and all prayers are answered. Reverently, we burn the incense of the Dao, the incense of virtue, the incense of Non-Action, Purity, and Natural Spontaneity.

We humbly present this offering to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Virtual Non-Being and Natural Spontaneity, the Most High Great Dao Lord and Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery, the Most High Lord Lao and Heavenly Worthy of the Cavernous Spirit and the Dao and Virtue, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole, the Heavenly Emperor of the Star Palace of the Curved Array, the Heavenly Worthies of Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions, the August Earthly Deity of the Rear Soil, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering of the Eastern Culmen and Azure Palace, the Azure Lad and Dao Lord of the Eastern Flowery Realm and Upper Minister Wood Duke, the Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Golden Mother of the Nine Numina and Primordial Sovereign of the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Nine Heavenly Emperors, the Five Elderly Heavenly Lords, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected Lords of the Five Fortunes and Ten Spirits and the Great Unity, the Eleven Luminaries of the Upper Clarity, the Filial Daoist King of the Solar Palace, the Filial Illustrious King of the Lunar Palace, the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper of the Central Heaven, the Three Primordial Lords of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Four Sagely Perfected Lords of the North Pole, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Cavern, the Three Heavenly Great Dharma Masters Who Uphold and Assist the Dao, the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Quiescent Response, the Three Perfected Lords of the Registers and Scriptures of Numinous Treasure, the Left Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate and Perfected Person of Impulse and Response, the Grand Historiographer of the Nine Provinces and Great Envoy of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation, the High Perfected Who Govern the Bureau of the Supreme Mystery, the Sagely Lords Who Preside over the Heavenly Pivot Institute, the Stellar Perfected of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Degrees of the Celestial Circuit, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms and Five Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, the Perfected Official of the Original Destiny of So-and-So, the Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness and Fengdu, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Glow and Fusang of the Water Palace, the Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Sagely Emperors of the Five Heavens of the Five Marchmounts, the Transcendent Officials of the Oratories and Governance, the Sagely Multitudes of the Sources of Rivers and Seas, the Divine Generals and Clerks of the Registers and Scriptures of the Three Caverns, the Official Lords of the Year Star, the City Gods and Deities of Sacrificial Rites, the Officials and Retainers of the Three Realms, and all mighty numina.

By the power of this fragrant cloud, we universally extend our offerings. May the Jade Sounds gather *qi*, may the numinous winds assemble the mists, may the purple void flourish in splendor, may the myriad immortals be assisted, may those who hold registers and grasp scriptures together arrive before the Emperor. Grant that our petitions be conveyed, that our prayers be answered, that our exorcisms be effective, and that our salvations be accomplished. May the lictors and messengers, the flying dragon riders, distinguish and convey these petitions, delivering them in due time.

The matters having been presented, may they return to their stations within my person and resume their places in the palaces. When summoned again, let them arrive as before, in accordance with precedent."

Each announces their dharma rank.

The humble official So-and-So, along with the assembled altar officials, reverently and with one mind, present this memorial to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Virtual Non-Being and Natural Spontaneity, the Boundless Great Dao and Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole, and the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions.

Your servant has heard that the formless and nameless are the wondrous subtleties of the Mysterious Perfection, while the luminous and manifest are the numinous mechanisms of sagely transformation.

Before the cosmos took form, at the origin of heaven and earth’s foundation, there stood the primordial singular qi. It divided to nurture the Three Powers, governed the myriad spirits, and molded all living kinds. Thus were the primal principles first revealed, establishing the root and lineage of ten thousand kalpas. The Great Brahma radiated its splendor, disclosing the secret mysteries of the Nine Purities. The Three Caverns spread forth, and the Nine Grades were proclaimed. These served not only to assist the transformative mechanisms of heaven but also to manifest the essentials of the Dao. Through the opening of instruction by the venerated masters, they have been reverently upheld across ancient and modern times.

Your servant, though of humble and unworthy capacity, has presumptuously attached himself to the end of the ranks. Overwhelmed by the perfection of the supreme transformation, he has been granted a glimpse of the numinous texts. It is fitting that he exert his utmost to propagate the teachings, and dare not neglect his duties on account of others. Having received the admonition to purify himself and advance, he must now open the path of diligent cultivation of the Dao. The transmission is inexhaustible, thus fulfilling the intent of the great teaching’s accomplishment. To achieve a structured succession, one must pray for the scrutiny and grace of the exalted perfected ones. Therefore, gazing toward the azure heavens, he offers his sincerity; envisioning the White Jade Towers, he bows his head. Though his rites be coarse and unrefined, he ventures to address the loftiness of the Mysterious Ultimate.

May the five-colored clouds of the celestial ministers surround the flaming bells and flowing talismans. May the Three Flowers and the Yellow Path of Dao descend in chariots drawn by flying dragons and phoenixes singing in harmony. May the host of sages draw near, and the myriad perfected ones take their places. Your servants, a hundred spirits trembling in awe, with minds of singular purity, bow before the jade altar and dare to present this solemn offering.

**First Offering of Tea and Wine**
Your servant, with utmost sincerity, reverently addresses the Three Supreme Realms of the Void and the Natural, the Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven of Wu, the Imperial Throne of the Purple Tenuity, the Ninefold Exalted Ones, the Lords of the Three Heavens, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerated Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious, the Three Heavens, and the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Lords of the Three Masters of the Registers of Salvation, the Divine Officers and Generals of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms, and all the mighty numina.

Your servant has heard that the Dao is fundamentally wordless, yet it is established through scriptures and precepts. The teachings and transformations are transmitted through the revelation of dharma registers to deliver humankind. The Nine Grades and Three Vehicles interconnect and permeate one another. The Six Scripts and Eight Styles mutually elucidate and clarify. Transmitted within the heavens, they become the guiding path for the ten thousand kinds. Descended to the human world, they open the gate for all beings to cultivate and advance. Without the good causes accumulated over kalpas, how could one even glimpse the orthodox canon? Thus, only after the teachings are rigorously refined may one become a master. Only with a mind pure and lofty may one receive the dharma. By establishing merit and accomplishing deeds, one may above assist in the profound plans of the Mysterious. By disciplining conduct and adorning the self, one may within rectify one’s mortal nature.

The statutes and ordinances are of utmost gravity; transmission and empowerment are not to be taken lightly. Your servant, inherently lacking in good capacity and truly devoid of penetrating insight, knows not the source of refining the Five Sprouts and Three Primes. The Six Desires and Seven Emotions merely chase the waves of delusion. He ought to reflect upon himself—how could he presume to instruct others? Yet, having pledged his heart in solemn oath and ascended the altar to receive the precepts, though he dare not rashly divulge them, neither is he permitted to conceal and lose the transmission. Moreover, moved by earnest and sincere words, he wishes to be enveloped in the transformation of the orthodox and perfected. How could he, on account of his own inadequacy, ultimately suppress and reject this? Fortunately, the aspirant possesses the will, and thus he presumes to present this petition.

Though your servant is ignorant of the mechanisms of penetrating the true and attaining the wondrous, he dare not transmit treacherous and deceptive methods. In accordance with the eternal canons, he admonishes the numinous altar. Reverently receiving the reflected light of the exalted sages and gazing upon the presence of the supreme perfected ones, he ventures to lay bare his mortal sentiments and offend the august majesty. Having prepared the blue-green memorial and the jiao offering, he respectfully proceeds to proclaim it.

**Proclamation of the Memorial; Burning of the Memorial.**
In accordance with the words of the memorial, the sincerity and earnestness of the sentiment warrant reception and guidance; he dare not decline.

Thus, the divine chapters of the Numinous Treasure, the supreme grade of the Cavern of Mystery, trace their origin to the beginning of the Kalpa of Extension—unfathomable in their inception. From the dawn of the Kalpa of Dragon Han, their wondrousness gradually manifested. They coalesced the upright qi of the Flying Mystery, forming the hidden and secret numinous sounds. They issued the root and lineage of the Five Marchmounts, spreading and illuminating through the four translations. They pacify states and families, assisting the governance of emperors and kings. They harmonize yin and yang, aiding the workings of creation. The exalted sages and lofty perfected ones all attain the Dao through these. The submerged spirits and hidden souls of the departed are none who do not ascend thereby. Truly, they are the bridge for the ten thousand kinds and the model for the thousand spirits.

Though this canon is majestic and its transmission not to be taken lightly, its vast and boundless merit encompasses all without exclusion. Your servant, a foolish and ignorant novice, has presumptuously occupied the rank of master and preceptor. The successor of the dharma, so-and-so, is of mundane and ordinary capacity, yet has audaciously received the office of the immortal and numinous. His actions exceed his station; in principle, he is ashamed at heart. He can only pray for the compassion of heaven’s creation and further hope for the nurturing grace of his masters. May he be permitted to transmit and empower, enabling advancement and promotion. May the nine generations of your servants’ ancestors be absolved of their long-standing transgressions, and the myriad lives of their heavy faults. May their records of sin be erased from the black tablets, and their true ranks be early inscribed in the Mysterious Capital.

Your servants, alarmed by the increasing presumption of their offenses, yet following the prescribed forms of the jiao rites, dare to present the secondary offering to express their utmost sincerity.

Your servant and the successor disciple, trembling with awe, bow their heads again in reverence.

**Secondary Offering Rites.**
Upon completion of the offering, the *Ten Directions Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy* is invoked.

The successor disciple bows again and makes his declaration. This may be recorded by the officiant or led by the cantor.

The officiant of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma, your servant so-and-so, with trepidation and reverence, bows his head and prostrates himself again, addressing the exalted perfected ones of the Three Realms, the August Thearchs of the Myriad Heavens, the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the East, South, West, North, Southeast, Northeast, Southwest, Northwest, Above, and Below.

May they deign to take pity and condescend to scrutinize and record. Your servant, blessed across a thousand lives, has encountered this singular opportunity to succeed to the dharma, advance in rank, and assume office. He pledges to forever uphold his pure resolve, never daring to betray his heart. Should he violate his oath and covenant, he willingly accepts punishment and censure. Today, he and his master divide the jade ring and inscribe the pledge, drinking the cinnabar elixir. He humbly beseeches their witness and permission to receive the empowerment.

Your servant, overwhelmed with gratitude and awe, prostrates himself in utmost reverence.

The Heavenly Worthies’ names are invoked. Master and disciple stand facing one another in their ranks. The High Master begins the declaration, proclaiming the precepts.

We reverently acknowledge that the Dao of the Numinous Treasure, the profound and mysterious lineage, strides alone through the Jade Capital, delivering countless beings. Those who receive it elevate the merit of nine generations of ancestors; those who cultivate it ascend bodily through the nine skies. It is the spiritual pivot of the myriad dharmas, the summation of the true teachings of the ten directions. Its majestic model of virtue is beyond all praise. Those who receive its dharma must surely cultivate it, observe the precepts that must be observed, and maintain their practice without fail—thus may they attain the rank of divine immortals. Before Heaven, we now proclaim and elucidate the Ten Precepts.

The First Precept: Never forget the Eight Poles.
Loyalty is the pole of reverence; filial piety, the pole of compliance; fasting, the pole of restraint; respect, the pole of ritual; magnanimity, the pole of breadth; generosity, the pole of joy; forbearance, the pole of harmony; endurance, the pole of wisdom. Heaven takes the Northern Asterism as its pole; Earth, the Five Peaks as its poles; a house, its ridgepole as its pole. Heaven, having its pole, can gather the host of qi; Earth, having its poles, can gather the host of forms; a house, having its pole, can gather the host of timbers. So too does a person, possessing the Eight Poles, gather the host of virtues. When virtues are established, the Dao is complete; when the Dao is complete, one’s vision naturally becomes clear and expansive, one’s responses naturally become harmonious and fitting—this is the foundation of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Second Precept: Never forget the Mirroring Waters.
The mirror is an analogy for the heart; water, an analogy for nature. When the heart is clear, the myriad dharmas are all reflected; when nature is still, the Five Turbidities do not intrude. The Dao within a person is perfectly penetrating—it cannot be understood through obscuration, nor attained through restlessness. Through the mirroring waters, one awakens to heart and nature—this is the essence of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Third Precept: Never forget the Daily Record.
The Daily Record is the means by which one examines one’s good and evil deeds. In navigating the world, people suffer from not knowing themselves, not hearing their faults, and not heeding advice. Without self-knowledge, there is no awakening; without hearing faults, there is no correction; without heeding advice, there is no benefit. Now, through the Daily Record, whatever one does that cannot be written down—these are one’s own transgressions. To correct them is paramount. Thus, the Daily Record becomes one’s uninstructing teacher, one’s unspeaking friend, one’s uncommanding sovereign and father, one’s unenforced code of law. It must not be forgotten—this is the aspiration of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Fourth Precept: Never forget the Pursuit of Deliverance and the Pacification of the Realm.
Of those to whom one is close, none are closer than parents and ancestors; of those one reveres, none are more revered than lords and sovereigns. To repay the virtue of lords, sovereigns, parents, and ancestors—this is the Pursuit of Deliverance and the Pacification of the Realm. *Pursuit* refers to reciting scriptures and enacting talismans for the sake of departed parents, ancestors, and the six relations, thereby aiding their journey in the netherworld. *Deliverance* refers to reciting scriptures and enacting talismans for the sake of living parents, ancestors, and the six relations, thereby augmenting their fortune and lifespan. *Pacification* refers to reciting scriptures and enacting talismans to pray for the longevity of the king, the emperor, and the lord, to pacify the four quarters, to summon dragons and bring rain, to expel demons and eradicate toxins, to protect the people and all beings, and to avert calamities caused by the stars—all of which are encompassed herein. Whether one fulfills the aspirations of ancestors while at home or carries out the duties of office on behalf of one’s sovereign, there are manifold benefits and repayments to be made—all should be undertaken accordingly. Even the leaves of trees, when they fall, nourish their roots—this is the principle of returning to the root and reverting to the mandate. One must not fail to strive in returning to one’s roots and reverting to the beginning—this is the proper course of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Fifth Precept: Never forget the arts of healing and salvation, with compassion as the foremost priority.
For all who are ill, enact talismans and recite scriptures with utmost sincerity to dispel their afflictions, as if they were one’s own beloved children or parents. In all matters of convenience, bestow kindness and grace to the fullest extent of one’s heart. If one holds office and administers the law, one must strive to accumulate hidden merit, enacting policies with leniency and fairness, reflecting thrice before acting and deliberating twice before moving. Whether repairing bridges and roads or planting trees along thoroughfares—anything that benefits the world—one should exert oneself to accomplish it. Just as a person’s kindness is rooted in the roots of trees, so too is a person who lacks benevolence no better than a beast. Thus, the orangutan saves the elephant, the righteous osprey wrestles the snake to rescue its prey—those who witness such acts may reflect upon them. This is the origin of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Sixth Precept: Never forget the arts of refinement and cultivation.
Harmonize with Heaven and Earth, emulate the patterns of yin and yang, maintain thoughts of perfect authenticity without lapse, and with sudden clarity transcend all constraints, transforming without limit. Even among insects and reptiles, some abandon their terrestrial abodes to take flight, while others forsake their aquatic paths to dash away. If such transformations occur in creatures, how much more should they be expected in humans? This is the method of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Seventh Precept: Never forget firmness and purity.
Firmness entails uprightness, refraining from improper conduct and licentiousness. Purity entails observing the precepts, not coveting improper sustenance. Refraining from improper conduct preserves the spirit and essence of the body; refraining from improper sustenance spares the lives of beings. Regard the wives and daughters of others as one’s own revered kin; regard the lives of beings as one’s own offspring. Thus, one’s spirit remains whole and grievances diminish—this is the substance of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Eighth Precept: Never forget frugality and restraint.
In all things one seeks, one should recognize that they are transformations of the primordial ancestral qi of the Origin. To cleanse filth, water and lye suffice—no adornment is needed. To sate hunger, grains and beans suffice—no delicacies are required. This is the fortune of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Ninth Precept: Never forget vows and covenants.
*Vows* are the good intentions one forms upon first entering the Dao. *Covenants* are the oaths one swears before Heaven and Earth after entering the Dao, which the gods and spirits oversee—one must not arbitrarily alter them. The precepts and regulations must be upheld—this is the mindfulness of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Tenth Precept: Never forget one’s master and companions.
The master is the one who teaches; companions are those who admonish.

The teacher is like a father; the admonisher is as an elder brother. Having become father and brother, can one fail to revere and honor them, or cast them aside? This is the fundamental principle of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The foregoing Ten Precepts were transmitted by the master and expounded from the ancient scriptures. The scriptures contain the mechanism of the Dao; the methods are the application of the scriptures. To follow the orthodox teaching, diligent practice comes first. Uphold and enact them without slackening midway. Countless generations of ancestors—suffering souls in the hidden realms—shall all receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Palace. The more diligently one practices and the more tirelessly one studies, the sooner one’s merit will be fulfilled and one’s attainment achieved. All may become divine immortals, soaring to the Golden Portal and roaming in the Jade Capital. Strive earnestly in this.

Next: The Division of the Ring Contract
The ring contract serves to swear oaths before the Three Officials, to pledge allegiance to the Ten Heavens, and to affirm enduring fidelity. The ordaining master must not conceal truth or disseminate falsehood; the disciple must not betray the Dao or forsake the master. The divided ring ensures the covenant remains unbroken; the torn contract ensures the vow is never violated. Those who begin with diligence but end in slackness shall have their transgressions recorded by the Five Emperors. Those who respectfully uphold their practice with devotion shall share in the blessings of the Nine Heavens.

Before the sacred presences, the contract is received and treasured for life. Next, the disciple and the ordaining master together take up the vermilion brush. The memorial and ring contract are each placed in their respective pouches.

The ordaining master says: *Turn the brush toward Heaven.*
The disciple responds: *I shall not betray Heaven. If I betray Heaven, may my seven generations suffer punishment. If Heaven betrays me, may the sun and moon lose their light.*

The ordaining master says: *Turn the brush toward Earth.*
The disciple responds: *I shall not betray Earth. If I betray Earth, may my body suffer the blade. If Earth betrays me, may grass and trees cease to grow.*

The ordaining master says: *Turn the brush toward the heart.*
The disciple responds: *I shall not betray my heart. If I betray my heart, may my family line perish. If my heart betrays me, may the transformation of the Dao cease to unfold.*

Next, the ordaining master holds a water vessel and brush, declaring: *The transmission is now complete. We renew our oath with a blood covenant, substituting cinnabar for blood. Each must steadfastly uphold their resolve. Drink this cinnabar essence to commune with the divine and penetrate the hidden, to harmonize the five qi within, and unite the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous; ten thousand qi coalesce into immortality.*

The master, disciple, and Daoist assembly each return to their ranks and original positions. The High Master again addresses the sacred, presenting the official certificate to supplement the transmission. The memorial is recited, and the certificate of office is proclaimed before the sacred.

The disciple kneels and receives the memorial, ring contract, and certificate. Holding the contract, the disciple declares:
*This humble one is dull-witted by nature, of base endowment. By error, I have received Heaven’s grace and presumptuously advanced upon the immortal ranks. Having divided the ring and torn the contract, I have pledged oaths and sworn covenants. Before Heaven, I have received office and been granted favor beyond my deserts. Dare I not redouble my resolve and forever abide in the orthodox teaching? Should I violate this pledge, I submit to the profound statutes.*

*Overwhelmed by gratitude, I am moved to the utmost. With reverence, I bow my head in gratitude.*

The High Master proclaims the statutes:
*With utmost sincerity, I humbly invoke the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Emperor; the Nine August Perfected; the divine administrators of the Three Realms; the sacred assemblies of the Ten Directions; the deities arrayed in the ritual altar; and all majestic numina.*

*I have heard that the Dao flourishes through people, and the Dharma is transmitted by masters. Unbroken succession enables the true wind to spread; boundless dissemination allows the great teaching to shine forth. It guides later generations from darkness toward light, elevates the people onto the path of reform and distance from transgression. To achieve the work of aiding the upright, delivering beings is paramount.*

*Yet this humble one is of dull capacity and foolish nature. My learning has not reached the perfected ones, nor has my path encountered true transmission. Presumptuously undertaking ordination, I have gravely failed in ritual propriety. How could I have expected the myriad sages to extend their compassion, the host of perfected to grant their protection? Without rejecting my lowliness, they have graciously bestowed forbearance, allowing me to proceed with the rites despite my inadequacy, enabling me to complete the transmission with their support. The division of the ring, the tearing of the contract, the swearing of oaths, the presentation of memorials before the altar, the drinking of cinnabar, and the receipt of office—though the ritual forms are roughly prepared, I am deeply indebted to their grace.*

*I am ashamed that my offerings lack full sincerity and purity, and that the rites of the altar are not perfectly refined. The ritual space is not grand; my entreaties fall short of proper form. If you pity my ignorance, I may be pardoned; if my faults are recorded, I cannot escape. I beseech your boundless mercy to universally forgive the punishment for my reckless folly.*

*May this humble one and my dharma-heirs soon encounter the wondrous essence and awaken to the numinous mechanism. May our cultivation proceed without obstruction, and may our talismans and methods receive the aid of the divine. May our breath and invocation find response, and our petitions reach fulfillment. May our bodies attain the true Dao, and our names be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets. Below, may we and our karmic burdens together rely on your grace.*

*Above, may the Dao and its methods flourish, and the true statutes spread widely. May Heaven be clear and Earth tranquil, the sun radiant and the moon bright. May the altars of state and ancestral temples, along with the former sages, ascend to the halls of eternal sunlight and roam the courts of the great desert. May blessings extend to the imperial domain and felicity flow to the divine descendants. May the present emperor receive the blessings of Heaven and Earth, his years equaling Mount Song and Mount Hua. For a hundred million years, may boundless fortune endure. For a thousand myriad generations, may auspicious omens manifest. May the realm be profoundly at peace, the frontiers serene. May the five weapons remain unused, the six qi harmonized. May crops flourish abundantly, and the people enjoy well-being.*

*May those who dwell in hidden valleys and rocky peaks, who cultivate truth and advance the Dao, complete their merit and soon receive the summons of the Nine Heavens. May they ascend in spirit and refine their forms, becoming ministers of the Three Realms.*

*Next, I pray for the ancestral spirits of this humble one, the departed masters and teachers, and all who have known their past lives. May they swiftly transcend the dark realms and awaken to the true origin, ascending to the realms of carefree wandering. May the Six Heavens and Ten Lands, the Three Paths and Nine Netherworlds, all be bathed in imperial radiance and receive the healing of primordial harmony. May punishments and torments cease, and entangling grievances be resolved. May wandering souls and flying spirits without refuge, sunken souls and lost spirits yet undelivered, be awakened and universally attain peace. May they be endowed with form, receive life with emotion, and assume their destined natures.*

*May feathered, furred, scaled, and shelled creatures; grasses, trees, and insects—all avoid untimely harm and together attain the principle of life.*

We, your humble servants, deeply ashamed of our repeated trespasses, dare not detain the assembled Perfected. We now offer our final private devotion, hoping to intoxicate ourselves with gratitude for your boundless grace. We, along with our disciples, tremble in awe, prostrating ourselves again in reverence.

**Final Offering Ritual**
We, your devoted servants, humbly and earnestly invoke the High Perfected of the Great Dao, the August Saints of the Jade Heavens, and all majestic spirits overseeing this altar and salvation. We have heard that the Dao, though formless, responds with perfect benevolence, and that Heaven, though lofty, heeds the lowly. Thus, this altar of transmission and salvation is specially blessed by your presence and observation. Yet we, in our presumption, have dared to disturb the celestial hearing and lightly profaned the divine majesty. Our fear and trepidation run deep, leaving us shaken and at a loss. We humbly implore your forbearance and gracious pardon.

Now that the rites of transmission are complete and the ceremonial offerings concluded, the realms of immortals and mortals must part, and the protective guardianship cannot remain. The clear processional music fades as the jade chariot departs. The purple clouds withdraw their radiance, no longer tracing the path of the imperial carriage. The officers return to their posts, the Perfected spirits resume their stations, and we are left only with longing and attachment, yearning for your presence. Fixing our thoughts upon the celestial steps, we bow a hundred times in farewell.

**Hymn of Sending Forth the Spirits, Receiving the Mandate, and Restoring the Incense Burner**
Exiting the altar, we proceed to the master’s tent. The High Priest kneels in reverence to express gratitude for the master’s teachings. The purification fast concludes, the cloud chariot is invoked, and the offerings are burned. As before, we pour libations of wine. We reflect on virtue, express thanks to the master, exchange congratulations, and withdraw.

We have long heard that the Dao is rarely encountered. Since the middle ancient era, ritual codes and teachings have flourished, yet the Great Dao has grown obscure. As the world declined further, techniques and arts proliferated, branching into many paths and becoming increasingly fragmented and impure.

The Three Caverns’ scriptures trace their lineage to the Han-era Celestial Master, who propagated the Orthodox Unity tradition, from which the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Rites emerged. When the Celestial Master received the seal and sword at the Jade Bureau and purged the realm of malevolent anomalies, the efficacy of the rites in aiding the times was truly magnificent. The Heavenly Heart Spring Writs endured the upheavals of the Wei and Jin dynasties and the division of the Northern and Southern regimes, scattering and falling into obscurity until they were nearly lost to record.

After the Five Dynasties, Masters Tan and Rao successively inherited and compiled the teachings into texts. Though they claimed the Three Talismans and Two Seals as their foundation, their titles, ranks, formats, and terminology all departed from the Han system. Even their celestial statutes and ghostly ordinances introduced penalties such as three years of penal servitude and one hundred strokes of the rod. Such terms as penal servitude and caning were established only during the Later Zhou’s Xiande era, not in the original texts of the Han Celestial Master. The Han punishments—such as three hundred or two hundred strokes of the cane—differed from later practices.

We have heard that Master Rao was well-versed in the affairs of the netherworld. Perhaps he sought to use secular conventions to admonish and inspire the world, or he may have had other insights. During the transmission rites, he issued immortal decrees to appoint officials in the netherworld. The secular system thus influenced the Yuanmiao Tradition, which adopted and codified his methods.

At the beginning of the Shaoxing era, the Daoist official Lu reorganized the Heavenly Heart Rites, further incorporating secular conventions. Master Lu, a scholar of great talent and erudition, composed the ritual codes for transmission and prefaced each of the ten volumes of his system with a treatise, surpassing all predecessors in precision and insight. Yet his vision was partial: he ranked the Celestial Master alongside the August Emperor, an act of presumption in the hierarchy of reverence. He placed the Heavenly Worthy alone above the myriad Perfected, a deviation from principle that is truly regrettable.

Regarding the issuance of immortal decrees, Master Lu departed from precedent, providing only appointment certificates rather than full mandates—a far more appropriate approach. In the human world, official ranks are conferred by the sovereign, and appointment documents are issued accordingly. Even when high ministers act on their own authority to fill vacancies, they issue only provisional certificates, not formal mandates, which require the sovereign’s command.

The transmission of Daoist teachings follows ritual codes with established forms, which we adhere to in practice. Yet these rites do not involve direct audience with the August Emperor or the public receipt of celestial decrees. They merely record the petitions and proceed with transmission according to the prescribed ceremonies, issuing appointment certificates even within the ancestral altars. How, then, can the affairs of the netherworld fully adopt secular formats, with unauthorized mandates issued at will? Such practices are truly untenable. This issue is particularly evident in the Heavenly Heart tradition.

In the Lingbao Great Rites, from Master Ge’s expansive transmission of scriptures to Master Xu’s comprehensive systematization of methods, even the Primordial Unity tradition took Master Xu as its patriarch. The Pure Rites and Esoteric Rites, though branching from the Lingbao tradition, never exhibited such bizarre and irregular practices.

After the Shaoxing era, the Lingbao rites of Tiantai spread through eastern Zhejiang, becoming even more adulterated with falsehoods than the Heavenly Heart tradition. For instance, the scriptures prescribe a ritual of pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens, wherein one presents a golden treasure to the master, invokes the Ten Directions, and takes an oath. The words spoken are binding, for Heaven does not deceive. The intent is to solemnize the matter and prevent irreverence.

The golden treasure has no fixed number. In the ritual of pledging allegiance to Heaven and transmitting the teachings, master and disciple fast together, swear their oath, and divide a contract. This ensures that the master does not conceal the truth and the disciple does not betray the master—such is the meaning of the rite.

Yet in the Tiantai Lingbao tradition’s *Registers and Contracts of Seals*, ten pieces of yellow silk are inscribed in vermilion with the disciple’s name and the invocation: “Your disciple so-and-so bows to the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction.” The Ten Directions each follow the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred titles from the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering*. During the transmission, the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions are split down the middle, a practice called “pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens.”

In secular documents, terms like *ganshe* (interference), *chengxing* (impetuous conduct), *gongjin* (palace prohibitions), and *bibao* (brush and carriage) are written with omitted strokes to show deference to the sovereign. How, then, can the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies be split down the center? Furthermore, the contract format arranges the scriptures and registers of the transmission master in proper order at the top, while the names of the disciple’s parents and three generations are written in reverse order at the bottom, a style called the *Three Heavens Textual Contract*. Ancient rites invoked the nine generations of ancestors in oaths, praying to Heaven.

Should this disciple attain enlightenment, let the nine generations of ancestors share in the punishment—such is the gravity of this covenant. Yet to inscribe the contract and invert it at the bottom—how can this be? Who devised such a grotesque distortion? They know not that the titles of the Heavenly Worthies are not texts to be split asunder, nor are one’s ancestors objects to be upended. If this can be tolerated, what cannot?

The remaining protocols may be inferred by analogy. Fearing that men of virtue might fail to trace the source and thus fall into transgression, I have expounded upon this at length.

The division of contracts arises from the mutual apprehension between master and disciple, lest either betray the other. Yet when has the Heavenly Worthy ever betrayed you? The Heavenly Worthy does not enter into contracts with mortals. The contract above merely embodies the sincerity of mutual accord, with a talisman placed at the point of division—nothing more.

In the *Lingbao* rites before the altar, the invocation is directed to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions. What is compiled herein adheres strictly to ancient forms: the issuance of certificates for office and the supplementation of ranks follow old precedents. As for the wording at the end of the certificates, since it pertains to the principles of the Dao, I have composed it accordingly. If embellishment is desired, it may be altered at will, but the established protocols are not of my own invention.

The marshals and scribes of the Dao all belong to the Supreme Mystery. They are not generals under Heaven’s Heart Orthodox Rites, dispatched to command troops beneath the sacred peaks. Rather, they are summoned through the examination of various methods, which may be interchanged as needed—this pertains to those invoked for specific occasions.

In the Tiantai tradition, scriptural passages are corrupted to serve as names for marshals, officials, and bureaus, all concocted from baseless conjecture. This has already been thoroughly refuted in the *Rankings of the Three Realms’ Palace Offices*; one must not perpetuate error by blindly adopting such practices.

The certificates briefly outline the method and the marshals or scribes to be summoned, serving to complete the ritual protocols. These are not examples of interchangeable summons but follow established precedents. To imitate the imperial court by privately fabricating edicts and decrees is utterly impermissible—those of discernment must take heed.

The Heaven’s Heart Orthodox Rites have long been confounded, and the sacred writ of *Lingbao* must not follow vulgar custom. As for transmission rites, many have recently added the *Ten Heavens’ Pledge of Allegiance*, introducing a profusion of miscellaneous ceremonies that vary across regions, none of which derive from the original scriptures or ancient canons. They must not be employed lightly.

In the transmission of precepts and the performance of rituals, some use the texts of the Heaven’s Heart transmission, while others intersperse invocations from unrelated rites—this diverges entirely from the proper conduct of *Lingbao* great rites. Though such phrases may appear in ancient methods, their protocols remain incomplete. Here, I have collated and revised them in accordance with the original canons, aligning them with the principles of the Dao, lest one stand before the Celestial Thearch speaking of one matter while the ritual pertains to another.

Lineages and their origins each have their proper authorities. If one does not transmit the methods of this tradition yet employs the protocols I have compiled, the mismatch will be glaring. Those outside this lineage would do well to devise their own.

Here ends *The Great Rites of Shangqing Lingbao*, Scroll Forty-Three.
*Here begins The Great Rites of Shangqing Lingbao*, Scroll Forty-Four.

The Master of Dongxuan Lingbao Rituals, Jin Yunzhong of the Southern Bureau’s Enforcement Office—Holder of the Right Assistant Governance of the Novice’s Initial Prefecture—compiles the *Refinement and Salvation* rites.

The High Priest first approaches before the Celestial Thearch to present matters in secret petition. Then, withdrawing, he proceeds to the southeast side of the ritual arena and arranges the seat according to protocol.

**Invocation of Incense**
This incense is endowed with numinous essence and refined fragrance, its substance planted in purity. It serves to convey the heart of reverence and devotion, ascending to reach the realm of the Void and the Subtle. Auspicious mists rise, moving the Nine Heavens to respond; propitious smoke spreads, its scent pervading the Three Realms.

With the first pinch of incense now offered, we make obeisance to the Boundless Dao and the Supreme Perfected of the Celestial Thearch. Through this merit, may it ascend to benefit the august spirits of our ancestral temples and the sagely forebears of the altars of soil and grain. May the divine souls ascend to the Purple Ultimate, the imperial destiny flow with blessings, the succession of sages endure without end, and the divined years stretch long. May the Emperor of this day attain a lifespan equal to heaven and earth, his fortune vast as the deep sea. May all beings revive, and the ten directions know peace and prosperity.

With the second pinch of incense now offered, we make obeisance to the sun, moon, and stars, the sovereigns of the celestial bureaus, the scriptures and registers of the Three Caverns, and the sagely assembly within the Dharma. Through this merit, may it be dedicated to the Ritual Officer so-and-so and their kin—nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of forebears, the five clans and six relations, the recently departed spirits, the long-deceased souls, the soul of so-and-so being delivered, and all wandering spirits of the ten thousand kinds in the dark realms, the lonely souls of the Five Paths. We humbly pray that they awaken to their roots and know their origins, emerge from delusion into enlightenment, traverse the shadowy gates and hidden roads, and attain clarity and fulfillment. May they dwell in joy forever, whether in heaven or among humanity.

With the third pinch of incense now offered, we make obeisance to the true numina of earth and water, the sovereigns of the sacred peaks and rivers, the ranked sages of the ten directions, and the officials of the Three Realms. Through this merit, may it flow back to benefit the Ritual Officer so-and-so and their present kin, their families and dependents. May they be blessed with abundant fortune and renewed longevity. May all receive the grace of nurturance and be transformed by the Void and the Subtle. May the animate and inanimate alike flourish, and all beings attain their full growth.

Next, we invoke the August Heavenly Thearch. Your servant, the Dharma-ranked official So-and-so, now prostrates twice and petitions the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Vacuity and Spontaneity, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Northern Culmen, the Heavenly Thearch of the Purple Tenuity, the Earthly Thearch Houtu, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering, the Eastern Flowery Lordly Minister Lord Wood and Azure Lad Dao Lord, the Golden Mother of the Nine Numina and Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Nine Heavenly Thearchs, the Five Elderly Heavenly Lords, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, the Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Four Holy Lords of the Northern Culmen, the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure, the Grand Immortal Historian of the Nine Provinces and Highly Illustrious Great Envoy True Lord, the True Lord of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate Who Responds with Empathy and Assists with Sincerity, and the Highest Perfected and Supreme Sages of the Three Caverns, Four Supplements, and Registers of the Dharma.

We reverently beseech Your Celestial Inspection and humbly record our foolish sincerity.

We have heard that as creation divides its forms, Heaven and Earth establish their positions. In the manifest, they give birth to humans and creatures; in the hidden, there are ghosts and spirits. Neither death nor life escapes the wheel of rebirth, and karmic retribution determines ascent or descent. Thus, banishment and service are assigned to the three evil destinies, while obscurity and submersion are divided among the six paths. Some endure kalpas without pardon; others accumulate years without release. The long night stretches endlessly, and the nether regions remain boundlessly remote. Were it not for the boundless grace of the August Heavenly Thearch, how could the hidden spirits receive even the slightest relief?

Your servant, unworthy and shallow, has presumptuously joined the ranks of the numinous. Rashly assuming the duties of ritual and carelessly overseeing the canonical teachings, I now act on behalf of the Ritual Officer So-and-so and their company, who have completed the rites according to the liturgical protocols and poured forth their sincerity. We pray for the equal repose of those in the abyssal chasms and implore the deliverance of all hidden souls.

We have previously submitted our petition and, by Your mercy, have been graciously granted assent. Thus, we have prepared the altar with solemnity and now seek to universally perform the refinement and transformation. Yet the nurturing of the myriad beings and the shaping of all life are the work of Heaven alone, not the strength of mortals. Nevertheless, the establishment of liturgical teachings must prioritize salvation and deliverance. Without the compassion of the Mysterious Creation, how could the hidden souls attain liberation?

We humbly pray that the grace of the Dao may broadly encompass all, that the work of Heaven may universally show mercy, and that You deign to issue a decree to the Palace of the Eastern Flowery Lordly Minister, the Western Numinous Tortoise Terrace, the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South, the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Palaces of the Sun and Moon, and all places where refinement and deliverance are to be conducted. May You swiftly command their response and immediately grant Your enactment.

Descend the divine radiance of Metal and Wood, bestow the true darkness of Heaven and Earth. Sweep away the shadows of the netherworld, restore and rectify the hun and po souls. May the myriad kinds and four births all receive the blessings of generation and transformation. May the three evil destinies and six paths all depart from the realm of obscurity and darkness.

Your servant respectfully follows the liturgical protocols and awaits the response of Heaven’s grace. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead to the ground.

We reverently submit these words.

The True Summoning Talisman for Descent is burned. Taking our seats, we summon the generals and functionaries.

The original Numinous Treasure petition for the deliverance of the departed souls:
*"The wondrous foremost of the highest rank, ten cycles of deliverance for humanity.
Within it is the spirit who delivers people from death,
Within it is the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,
Within it is the Great Spirit Sima who delivers the world,
Within it is the Benevolent Elder Han Jun,
Within it are the Registrars of Life and Destiny of the Southern Upper Realm,
The revered spirits who extend life, increase destiny, and deliver from calamity,
Who restore bones and raise the dead, delivering boundless multitudes."*

Today, for this refinement and deliverance, the various heavens draw near, inclining their light and turning their chariots to oversee the deliverance of the living. The chancellors of the various heavens, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Registrar Han, the Inspector of Life, and the great spirits who hold the registers and grasp the records all arrive before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, the heavens are strictly examined.

The August Heavenly Thearch has issued a command; all spirits heed it.

We reverently summon the Cinnabar Heaven World of the South, the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Perfected of Refinement and Deliverance, the Great Spirits of Refinement and Deliverance, the True Lord of Wood Palace who governs the generative qi of Yang and holds the numinous essence, the Flame Radiance Lad and Cinnabar Rosy Cloud Jade Maiden of the Sun Palace, the immortals of the Sun Palace, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Fire Bureau, the Fire Bell Lads, the officials, generals, and functionaries of the Fire Refinement, the True Lord of Metal Palace who governs the correct qi of Yin and holds the numinous essence, the Round Radiance Lad and Scattered Splendor Jade Maiden of the Moon Palace, the immortals of the Moon Palace, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Water Bureau, the officials, generals, and functionaries of the Water Refinement, the holy hosts who refine hun souls and deliver po souls, the officials and attendants of the Numinous Treasure, and all mighty numina. Hasten to descend to this altar site and receive the talisman to carry out the decree.

We visualize the generals and functionaries descending. Next, we recite the true names of the Five Thearchs.

*"Gongdu completes at Wu, Qiejiao guards You,
Xingsheng turns at Zi, Kehanming at Mao,
Duli moves the central finger to the center, Gongdu gathers the souls and captures them."*

The qi of the South—make the mudra, blow, and receive the refinement of the departed souls.

We recite again:
*"Burn the true writ.
Hongxing arrives at Mao, Heihei swiftly joins Ziwen,
Mozhen plans at You, Walaxiushou completes at Wu,
The Numinous Treasure writ of the myriad things at the central finger,
Xili unites and penetrates.
The Orthodox Unity accomplishes the Dharma, wisdom benefits the true.
Take the post-haste command to capture."*

Take the qi of the five directions and five colors from the right. The attending functionaries of all registers, riding the true qi of the five colors, float through the void to arrive. Each binds and refines the departed souls, summoning and gathering their spirit-souls, clarifying their nature and consciousness to undergo refinement.

From this point until the "True Writs of the Five Sprouts," all follows the same ritual procedure as the standard offering. No further repetition is made here.

Raise the banner from the pool and proceed to stand upright at the center of the altar. The High Master declares:

"Those who have arrived at the altar are to receive deliverance—the beings of the Three Wicked Paths, the Ten Classes, the Five Destinies, and the Four Modes of Birth. Long entangled in the snares of the world, they have long obscured true cultivation. Their ninefold qi has no return, their five phases are scattered and lost. Their three hun-souls suffer punishment, drifting through ten thousand kalpas. Without the aid of good causes, they cannot restore the principle of life.

As officiant, I now follow the canonical forms to invoke the true numina. Embodying the creative power of Heaven and Earth, adhering to the harmonizing numbers of yin and yang, I pair water and fire, wash and refine form and spirit. I draw down the essence of the Two Luminaries, conjoin the vital balance of the five phases. Roots are established to receive the ancestors; from the dark depths, essence is born. In the profound and obscure, the true gathers; in the vague and indistinct, forms appear.

For all things must end and then begin anew; principles become clear only through transformation. Ghosts return to become humans, bodies undergo immortal transfiguration. Having already reported this to the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Thearch, I now beseech the bestowal of auspicious blessings and the recording of their original spirit-souls. May the true qi be conferred upon the nine barriers, and the fetal perfection be completed in ten months. May they again draw upon the primordial chaos and once more behold the light.

With reverence, I invoke the primordial qi of the Imperial True Embryonic Destiny—the Primordial Unity of the Yellow Pervasion—wrapping the embryo in its original binding, enabling the embryo’s source to flow freely and bring forth life.

Burn the first talisman and intone the first chapter.

These nine chapters are performed by the High Master and recited by the Daoist assembly, following the same procedure as the standard offering. No further repetition is made here.

Proclaim the precepts."

After the refinement and deliverance, recite the incantation until the "Carefree" passage, then perform the Shangqing mudra to completion. Proceed to read the petition aloud.

We humbly observe that the Great Dao shines resplendently, present in all without exception. Even in matters great and small, there exists a proper principle that cannot be neglected. Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits—none can depart from the Great Dao or transgress its proper principle.

The sun and moon radiate brilliance, the stars revolve in splendor; cold and heat follow their constant cycles, the seasons shift with their appointed signs. Nourished by rain and dew, stirred by wind and thunder, the Dao nurtures the myriad things without claiming merit, harmonizes the two qi without error. Its revolutions never cease—this is the Dao of Heaven, the proper principle of Heaven, and thus it is called Heaven.

The towering majesty of mountains and hills, the vast depths of rivers and seas, the fragrant flourishing of grasses and trees, the sowing and cultivation of grains—all bear the myriad things in perfect stillness, establishing the six directions without limit. This is the Dao of Earth, the proper principle of Earth, and thus it is called Earth.

It modulates the somber and luminous forces of yin and yang, aiding the work of creation. It brings misfortune to the excessive and blessings to the virtuous, abhors evil and harms the overreaching. Upright and impartial, perceptive yet concealed, its transformations are unfathomable, its adaptability boundless—this is the Dao of spirits, the proper principle of spirits, and thus it is called spirit.

Endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth, harmonized by yin and yang, though the body is formed from illusory and fleeting elements, the essence is bestowed with clarity and awareness. As a ruler, one acts on Heaven’s behalf, protecting the people and reigning with virtue, spreading beneficence to all living beings, extending grace through the ages—thus fulfilling the Dao of the sovereign and establishing a grand foundation. As a minister, one is loyal; as a child, filial. Among the common people, one cultivates constancy, practices trust and righteousness, establishes virtue, and embraces kindness. Whether noble or base, rich or poor, all have their destined lot; in life and death, honor and disgrace, one does not alter the original heart—this is the Dao of humanity, the proper principle of humanity, and thus it is called human.

The Dao cannot be departed from even for a moment. Heaven and Earth are formed by following the Dao, and thus they endure forever, their end unknowable. As for ghosts and spirits, they are divided into the upright and the perverse, with distinctions of ascent and descent. As for human cultivation, habits, and the retribution of fortune and misfortune, all take shape according to their kind and cannot be generalized. Yet if even Heaven and Earth cannot depart from the Great Dao or transgress its proper principle, how much less can humans—and how much less ghosts and spirits?

As for the myriad things, their endowment of qi is impure, and their forms may differ. Some become beasts, some birds and insects; some can cry out yet lack awareness, possessing nature but little wisdom—these cannot be held accountable to the Dao or corrected by principle. Humans, the most spiritually endowed of all things, are thus the noblest of Heaven and Earth’s creations.

Thus, while alive, one is human, yet life cannot be without end; upon death, one becomes a ghost. If the original nature does not perish, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born—thus ghosts return to being human, and the doctrine of cyclic rebirth arises. The Great Dao shines resplendently, its proper principle never obscured—what separation exists between Heaven and Earth? What obscurity between beings? What constraint upon ghosts and spirits? From Heaven above to Earth below, boundless and infinite, all is encompassed within this.

Now, in performing purification rites and practicing the Dao, burning incense and lighting lamps, entreating the true spirits, repenting transgressions, summoning the wandering souls, and delivering the spirits—these are the teachings bequeathed by the Supreme Thearch, the exalted perfected, and the sagely masters of old, established to benefit both the living and the departed, to instruct future generations, and to awaken those lost in delusion.

Today, the officiant, turning toward truth and embracing the Dao, has prepared offerings and arranged the rites, wishing to aid both the living and the dead. Having received the petition and made the announcements, I dare not deceive my heart or violate the established forms. The proclamations have been made in full, and the merit is complete.

Thus, we universally summon all within the six directions, all kingdoms, the six paths and three realms, the four births and ten thousand kinds—whether ordinary or sacred, all wandering souls. Bathed and purified, they attend the true rites, hear the scriptures, and partake of the offerings. Their spirits are gathered, their transgressions repented and cleansed, and all good affinities have been fulfilled. Bonds are released, sins dissolved. The steps to deliverance and the path to ascension lie within oneself, not in others; within, not without. When the original nature is fully awakened and all distractions dispelled, the spirit will not sink—what need is there for other schemes?

Moreover, we hope that all gathered at this altar—with the wise instructing the benighted, the awakened rescuing the deluded—will exhort and transform one another, deeply reflecting and reforming. May the divine spirits above also deign to listen: do not turn from the Great Dao, do not transgress its proper principle. Do not wantonly wield power and fortune, do not oppress living beings, do not mingle with demonic forces, do not presume to manifest as omens or specters. Do not seek bloody sacrifices, do not traffic with the living, do not display forms and apparitions, do not obstruct or encroach upon the royal domain. Assist Heaven and aid transformation, bringing peace to the times and protecting the people. Thus, you will ascend step by step, attaining ever higher ranks.

Those who were once human but are now ghosts—if in life you were noble and prosperous, do not cling to glory and splendor. If in life you were wealthy, do not grasp at riches. If in life you were poor and lowly, do not resent or fear hardship. If in life you harbored grudges, do not conceal or nurse resentment. Whether you pursued the true path without success or studied the teachings of the Buddha without attainment, now is the time to plan anew—do not tread the old paths.

Artisans, laborers, scholars, farmers, merchants—all the multitudes of the five clans and ten thousand kinds, of high and low estate, wise and foolish—none escape the decay of the body and the emptiness of worldly affairs. You must relinquish all emotional attachments and cease your delusions. Only those who have lost virtue and accumulated transgressions, who have transgressed principle and amassed faults, must deeply repent and sternly reflect.

This does not mean discarding all past affairs while still clinging to them here—rather, it is to reflect on past transgressions and misguided thoughts, avoid repeating the same mistakes, take them as warnings for the future, and make plans for rebirth. How could one, having already lost virtue and transgressed principle in life, repeat such errors after returning to the shades?

Thus, one should not linger to haunt the living, nor entangle and harm kinfolk. One must not seek vengeance for old grudges, nor cling to former dwellings. One should not act on mere echoes or shadows, nor crave sacrificial offerings—all these bring no benefit to the departed soul, but only serve as burdens to transcendence.

For those who met violent ends—whether through misfortune, untimely death, death in childbirth, or dismemberment; whether decapitated, maimed, deaf, blind, or afflicted with festering wounds—all who perished with injuries or in impurity, their forms incomplete: know this—humans take shape through essence and blood, their bodies nourished by the five grains, while the single spirit-nature arises from emptiness. When life ends, blood putrefies and flesh decays; the material form returns to earth. As for the one nature, how could it be harmed? It has never been defiled. Therefore, one need not dwell on the moment of death, nor fixate on the form of one’s final moments. Whether ghost or human, to awaken to this truth is to grasp the right principle. The blades once clenched in the teeth and the ropes once bound around the neck are now gone. The filth and stench of the past are now purified. Between heaven and earth, wherever one goes, one is transcendent—this fruit lies within oneself, not in others.

All beings, whether sacred or profane, once they understand that the Great Dao is not distant and the right principle is clear and open, will find that heaven does not abandon them, nor does earth confine them. As spirits, they may transform; as ghosts, they need not sink into darkness. If reborn as humans, they will surely rise to greatness. Grudges and enmities, though unresolved, will dissolve of themselves. The hun and po, the spirit and essence, though not forcibly restored, will recover naturally. From this, we see that heaven’s halls are surely attainable, while hell will never again be seen. Should one return to the human world, the right principle will take root in the original heart, and loyalty and filial piety will arise from innate nature. Whether in darkness or in light, one will forever abide with the Dao.

Thus, take refuge in the Three Treasures, penetrate to the root and source. Let all—saints and ghosts, gods and spirits—listen carefully.

**First Refuge: The Supreme Treasure of the Dao**
The Treasure of the Dao is formless and nameless, existing before heaven and earth. It gestates in Kan and Li, initiates Qian and Kun, enduring in boundless vastness, profound and unfathomable. At times, it manifests teachings with the times; at others, it governs the ages to reveal its radiance. Though all beings use it daily, they know it not; its grace flows endlessly through ten thousand kalpas. Between heaven and earth, all take refuge in it.
*Praise to the Treasure of the Dao*

**Second Refuge: The Supreme Treasure of the Scriptures**
The Treasure of the Scriptures comprises the Nine Pure True Classics and the Three Caverns’ sacred texts, their eight corners radiating brilliance, their five sections lush with wisdom. Some are formed by the flight of wondrous qi through the void, others penned by sages into chapters. Through countless kalpas, they broadly spread transformations; the thirty-six divisions nurture all beings. From ancient times to the present, they bestow blessings upon the manifest and hidden alike. Between heaven and earth, all take refuge in them.
*Praise to the Treasure of the Scriptures*

**Third Refuge: The Supreme Treasure of the Masters**
The Treasure of the Masters is the Lord of Teachings within the Mysterious, the lineage masters of the Three Caverns. They transmit registers, bestow scriptures, propagate precepts, and expound the Dharma, dividing their forms to practice the Dao and save the world through their writings. They serve as models for ten thousand generations and exemplars for the ten directions. They guide later learners, lead the lost back to the path, sometimes reflecting light in the void, sometimes leaving their forms beyond appearances. Between heaven and earth, all take refuge in them.
*Praise to the Treasure of the Masters*

Having thus taken refuge in the Three Treasures and penetrated to the root and source, what distinction remains between sacred and profane? The principle is one. Though promotion and rebirth may follow their own timing, and one may temporarily dwell in the shades, one must always follow the right principle. The Ten Precepts for Ghosts and Spirits should first be received and upheld. When one later re-enters the human realm and takes form in the yang world, one should take loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, conduct oneself with integrity and caution, and next, strictly observe the Nine True Precepts. Let all beings, sacred and profane, heed these precepts.

Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts; the true Dao takes precepts as its master. Through them, the Three Treasures flourish, bestowed by exalted immortals. Riding this deathless vessel, swiftly cross the great expanse. At this moment of preaching the precepts, all the heavens bow their heads.

**The Ten Precepts for Ghosts and Spirits**
**First Precept:** Do not appear at improper times, rush into the living, recklessly enter the human world, or collude to create disturbances, causing people to dream in confusion.
*All respond:* May the yin spirits wholeheartedly receive deliverance.

**Second Precept:** Do not associate with external demons or guest spirits, demand food and drink, throw sand or hurl tiles, or frighten the living.

**Third Precept:** Do not lead epidemics into realms, violently harm good people, cause illness, or implicate kinfolk.

**Fourth Precept:** Do not guard royal lands to hinder cultivation, forcibly seize forests, trees, flowers, or fruits, or conceal heavenly taxes.

**Fifth Precept:** Do not stir the fire spirits of the four directions to burn people’s homes, damage their property, or ruin their families.

**Sixth Precept:** Do not demand blood sacrifices, deepening karmic obstacles, perpetuating retribution in the cycle of rebirth without end.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not send various demons, crows, magpies, foxes, dogs, or rats to startle and frighten the living.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not harm people’s livestock; in future lives, you will forever sink into the dark yin.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not recklessly ride horses or chariots, obstructing the living’s travels, causing disasters, or seeking private gain.

**Tenth Precept:** Do not bring misfortune upon people, accept bribes to act, cause illness, pursue souls, or lead people into delusion.

**Chorus:** May the hidden spirits, with one heart, receive deliverance.

**Nine Wondrous Precepts of the True:**
**First Precept:** Reverence and deference, filial piety and care for parents—this is called the Precept of the Initial Truth.
**Chorus:** May the hidden spirits, with one heart, listen and receive.

**Second Precept:** Diligence and devotion, loyalty to one’s lord—this is called the Precept of Mindful Truth.

**Third Precept:** Do not kill; with compassion, save all beings—this is called the Precept of Upholding Truth.

**Fourth Precept:** Do not commit adultery; keep the body upright in all things—this is called the Precept of Guarding Truth.

**Fifth Precept:** Do not steal; extend righteousness and diminish the self—this is called the Precept of Preserving Truth.

**Sixth Precept:** Do not rage; let not fury harm others—this is called the Precept of Cultivating Truth.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not deceive; let not flattery and treachery harm the good—this is called the Precept of Perfecting Truth.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not be arrogant; let not pride neglect the Supreme Truth—this is called the Precept of Attaining Truth.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion—this is called the Precept of Ascending Truth.

**Recitation of the Precepts:**
The precepts just expounded—may they be reverently received.
In heaven and on earth, in the hidden realm and the world of the living,
let the heart remain unconfused, let every thought be without transgression.

Yet the original nature is inherently pure and luminous,
the good heart and virtuous intent arise naturally.
Why fear the rise and fall of existence?
Why rely on precepts and disciplines?

Only because, through habit, one sinks into evil destinies,
drifts into deviant paths,
and even precepts cannot then be applied.
Awaken to the root of the original self,
realize the nature of true reality—
as a ghost, one will neither sink nor be deluded;
as a human, one will know no misfortune nor fault.
Every action, every deed, is none other than the great Dao;
every thought, every consideration, does not stray from right principle.
At this stage, one may be without precepts yet naturally uphold them.

However, in the days of the hidden realm,
one must not cling to worldly things:
fame and fortune, wealth and nobility,
grand mansions and lofty towers,
silken allure and brocade finery,
gold, pearls, jade, and precious stones,
rare delicacies and exotic flavors,
stately canopies and towering carriages,
the pleasures of music and beauty,
the joys of horses and chariots,
the comforts of service and sustenance,
the resources of enjoyment,
the affections of family,
the love of wives and children—
even hunger that craves food,
cold that seeks clothing,
gains that sustain life,
losses that bring death—
these are truly indispensable,
yet none are free from the burdens of the body,
the affairs of the world, which are thus.

Since the body cannot endure forever,
none of these can long remain.
One should know that this body cannot be detained,
all things will turn to emptiness.
Life and death follow separate paths;
attachment is of no benefit—
is this not the right principle of heaven and earth,
as it ought to be?

Moreover, after death,
the form vanishes into boundless void.
The food of the yang world cannot be eaten,
the clothing of the human realm cannot be worn.
Hunger and cold—how can they burden one?

Thus the *Daodejing* says:
*"My greatest affliction is that I have a body.
If I had no body, what affliction would remain?"*
The principle is perfectly clear.

Just because attachments and affections are not forgotten,
worldly affairs linger in the mind,
and one clings to sacrifices and offerings,
longing for kin and loved ones—
having strayed from the path of delusion and fixation,
hunger and thirst arise in thought.

All the solemn offerings presented above,
the reverent arrangements of grain and feasts—
how could these defile the spirits and gods?
They serve only to fulfill the yearnings of those not yet fully awakened,
to dissolve their fixations and delusions.
From this moment onward, having thoroughly perceived this principle:
*"Since there is no body, what need is there for food and drink?"*

Yet the rites of ancestral veneration,
the sincerity of sacrificial prayers,
demonstrate that human sentiment does not forget its roots.
Once the luminous nature is realized,
what need remains for offerings?

Whether as ghost or human,
in darkness or in light,
unattached to the myriad conditions,
one attains perfect freedom—
how could there still be divisions of the six paths,
the toils of the three realms?
Even those of feather, fur, scale, and shell,
birds, beasts, insects, and fish,
all return to their original root,
abandoning their divergent destinies,
forever attaining the joy of rebirth,
all bathing in boundless bliss.

There are the *Tai Shang Chang Sheng Ling Fu* (Numinous Talismans of Supreme Longevity),
the *Sheng Tian Bao Lu* (Precious Registers of Ascension to Heaven),
the sacred scriptures and precious decrees,
the merit certificates—
these serve as credentials for ascension.
With reverence, they are proclaimed and transmitted.

Having read the talismans, announced the documents, and conveyed the registers,
the transmission of talismans and conferral of deliverance are complete.
The virtuous work accomplished,
each departs from the altar,
all ascending the path of liberation,
entering the realm of purity and emptiness.
Proceed forward without delay.

All saints and mortals, take care.
The solitary souls and yin spirits,
now refined and perfected,
scatter and ascend like soaring clouds.

Rising, they declare:
*"The burdens of the mortal body are hard to shed,
but in death, without form, affairs are no more.
Having grasped this truth at last,
the true nature shines, revealing heaven’s mystery."*

The High Priest descends from the seat,
the announcer escorts the souls across the bridge.

Thus we invoke the majestic Dao,
the vast and wondrous power,
opening the gate of expedient means,
illuminating the path of ascension.
Boundless grace descends,
enveloping the realms of darkness.
Mysterious blessings pervade,
reaching every yin abode.
The three realms cease their toil,
the six paths are reborn anew.

Today, in reverence, we initiate the sacred rites,
cultivating blessings through the fast,
dedicating all merit to the wandering souls,
offering deliverance to the netherworld.
All classes of ghosts and spirits,
the souls of the nine provinces,
having attended the audience with the True,
heard the Dao and the scriptures,
received the incantations and the sacred banquet,
transmitted the wondrous precepts,
expounded the profound texts,
and recited the numinous scriptures—
the virtuous work thus established is complete.

All are released from their karmic bonds,
their dark records erased,
all sins absolved,
their spirits unobscured.
Each receives the merit of the fast and departs in goodness,
all ascending to the pure realms, transcending rebirth.

The *Faqiao* (Dharma Bridge) of the Greatly Merciful Heavenly Worthy is crossed.
The offerings are burned.
The *San Qing* hymns are chanted,
and the merit is dedicated.

Sincerity moves heaven;
the devotion of the fast has ascended to the Three Realms.
The teachings save all beings;
the grace of the Dao descends to the Nine Springs.
Far and near receive blessings,
the manifest and the hidden rejoice together.

Today, the officiant has performed the rites with utmost reverence,
establishing the fast to bless the sovereign and kin,
universally aiding the living and the dead.
May all virtuous fruits be perfectly fulfilled.

We humbly pray that the souls of the departed,
the nine ancestral spirits,
the lingering souls of the ten directions,
the wandering souls of all lands,
the beings of the six paths and three realms,
the myriad forms of the four births—
all receive deliverance,
emerging from the shadows of yin.
Their forms purified, their bodies cleansed,
they roam freely beyond the Three Realms.
Their minds enlightened, their natures revealed,
they ascend to pay homage in the Ten Heavens.
All sentient beings share in this grace,
all creatures bathe in this numinous bliss.
Officials and kin alike receive favor,
all rejoicing in this boundless fortune.

For this supreme good cause,
we invoke the Great Sage, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin,
the Supreme Dao Lord,
the Supreme Lord Lao,
the Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the Ten Directions,
and their inconceivable merit and virtue.

We reflect deeply upon the various fasts of the *Huang Lu*:
their fundamental purpose is deliverance.
In the manifest realm, they pray for the sovereign’s peace and the well-being of all beings.
In the hidden realm, they rescue ghosts and deliver souls,
universally aiding all classes.
Thus, the merit is made complete.

Whether to ascend and bless ancestral spirits,
granting the departed their reward,
or to dispel calamities and disasters,
bringing blessings to the living—
if one’s concern is solely for oneself,
lacking the heart to universally deliver,
then the fast is insufficient.

Thus, the universal feeding of the hungry ghosts
must be performed with utmost sincerity.

In the ancient rites of Qi,
the altar was established the night before,
the audience with the True was held,
repentance and thanksgiving were offered,
lamps were lit, documents were cast,
the fast was concluded, and the altar was dispersed—
these were the practices of old,
as recorded in Master Guangcheng’s *Huang Lu Zhai Ke*,
not to be altered by later generations.

As for the universal summoning of the solitary souls of the six paths and three realms,
in recent times, expanded texts have appeared,
along with rituals for purification,
incantations for feeding,
and proclamations.
Alas, their compilers failed to examine them carefully,
often resulting in contradictions with principle.

For instance, in the transmitted *Rites of the Six Paths*,
when addressing the hell realm, it speaks of:
*"Molten copper poured into mouths,
sharp saws severing bodies,
skin and flesh scorched and rotting..."*
Such vulgarity is extreme.
Whether such things exist or not cannot be certain—
why must they be described in such detail?

Elsewhere, there are texts for the twenty-five classes of solitary souls,
with two or three versions,
each riddled with contradictions.
For example, in summoning the spirits of courtesans and actors,
it speaks of:
*"Wine staining fragrant cheeks,
lotus faces ever fresh..."*
How could such words be respectfully proclaimed before spirits and gods?

As for the souls of miscellaneous classes,
their faults are forcefully exposed,
their shortcomings harshly criticized—
all for the sake of crafting a text,
approaching the realm of jest.
To address them thus,
even a practitioner would disdain it,
let alone the spirits and gods.

The universal deliverance feast is the greatest affair of the fast.
One should clearly expound the great principles,
awaken their good hearts,
inspiring the spirits to turn toward goodness and distance themselves from sin.
Would there be none who awaken?
Yet instead of summoning them to come,
one indulges in slander and abuse,
spouting insults without restraint—
this is truly unacceptable.

In recent times, Lü Yun compiled the *Huang Lu Li Cheng Yi*,
intended as a one-day-and-night ritual.

Recently at the Tianqing Abbey in Lin’an Prefecture, I observed that many of the miscellaneous ritual texts in use were drawn from vulgar sources. For instance, in the section for delivering orphaned souls, one finds such lines as: *"Upon the vast expanse of the River of Love, snow-white waves float in the void; within the fathomless Sea of Desire, silver ripples overflow the eye."* Now, the scriptures speak of being *"blown by the currents of the Sea of Desire, adrift upon the waves of the River of Love"*—for human love and desire know no bounds, as deep and endless as rivers and seas, flowing with desire, drifting with love, like waters that never cease. The principle is quite clear. Yet to speak of *"upon the River of Love"* implies that the river has a fixed location and even banks. As for phrases like *"snow-white waves"* and *"silver ripples,"* they are even more excessive. To expound scripture in such a manner—would this not mislead the spirits of the unseen realm?

In recent times, miscellaneous ritual texts have largely followed this pattern. Moreover, when universally summoning spirits and gods without distinction of rank, how can one be certain there are no lofty and enlightened souls among them? With such absurd and reckless wording, one would surely invite mockery from the spirits and gods.

Thus, I have newly composed texts for the Six Paths, twenty-five categories of summons for orphaned souls, the *Muyu* Ritual, and various *baiwen* petitions—not presuming them to be perfect, but rather to ensure that the language is plain and accessible, the verses readable, and the content consistently aligned with the great principles, roughly appropriate to the circumstances. This avoids the pitfalls of harsh criticism, abuse, and disrespect toward the unseen realm.

As for transmitting talismans and conferring precepts, few of the existing ritual texts are truly proper. During the Jianzhong Jingguo era of the Song Dynasty, a scholar named Xin Ze, acting on behalf of the Daoist Chen Cheng, edited an ancient version of the *Teachings and Admonitions for Spirits and Gods Ritual*. Its style was pure and correct, though the text was rather lengthy. After the *Three Refuges*, it included recitations of the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* and the *Sutra of Purity*, concluding with a final admonition and dispatch based entirely on the meaning of these two scriptures. In ancient times, when no refinement and deliverance (*liandu*) was performed, the ritual could be simplified. However, after the *liandu* rites—which often extend late into the night—it becomes difficult to recite lengthy petitions. Furthermore, the original text included admonitions for scholar-officials, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests, phrased with blunt directness. People of old, being simple and sincere, did not take offense, but today, such words would provoke anger in many. Yet I dare not alter the structure of the ancient text, so I have composed a separate *Transmission of Precepts Ritual* to follow the *liandu*, thereby forming a complete system.

My humble efforts have resulted in a work lacking in literary elegance or ornate beauty. Yet what can be said of it is this: it does not betray the Dao or disrupt the ritual order, nor does it transgress norms or obscure principles. I make no claim to rival the ancients even in the slightest, but compared to the vulgar and coarse language in common use, it is at least more measured and coherent, avoiding bizarre or obscure phrasing to facilitate recitation at the altar.

Beyond the ancient ritual texts for fasts, I have thoroughly revised all miscellaneous ritual manuals from beginning to end, ensuring nothing is omitted. However, rituals such as the *Children’s Rite*, the *Ten Kings Ritual*, and those involving inconceivable merits have no precedent in antiquity. Moreover, their formats are flawed, their language crude and shallow, and their principles unsound—thus, they are unworthy of inclusion in the ritual canon and should not be incorporated into practice.

All revisions adhere to ancient models in phrasing and intent, carefully reworking the ritual texts without daring to contravene the teachings of the masters. If one practices this ancient method, employs these texts, and recites these manuals, the ritual will maintain coherence from beginning to end, properly revering the Supreme Emperor and moving the spirits and gods—leaving one’s heart free of shame. If, however, one abandons this method, transfers these texts elsewhere, or conceals their origins while using their words, the result will neither suit the circumstances nor preserve their original intent.

Additionally, in the old rite for sending souls across the bridge, fish were kept in water beneath a pavilion, symbolizing the transformation of fish into dragons and the transmission of talismanic commands. The pavilion’s four gates each bore a gatha, recited before sending the souls across. However, ancient Daoist ritual codes contain no precedent for reciting gathas. Moreover, the gathas in recent use are overly simplistic. Since the ritual already employs a straw dragon to fulfill the talismanic transmission, the fish are unnecessary and thus omitted from the revised manual.

May future generations of accomplished masters and noble scholars who encounter this work be moved to refine its redundancies, amend its omissions, and perfect its flaws—this is my deepest hope.

Here ends the forty-fourth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Supreme Purity and Numinous Treasure*.
