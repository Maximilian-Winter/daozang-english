*The Supreme Cavern-Perfection Precious Record of Primordial Qi*

The scripture is titled *The Supreme Cavern-Perfection Precious Record of Primordial Qi*. Its author is unknown, though it likely emerged during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It expounds upon the ranks and stages of Daoist cultivation, as well as the names and meanings of the Three Caverns and Twelve Categories. It comprises one scroll. The base text is derived from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Section Zheng Yi.

*The Supreme Cavern-Perfection Precious Record of Primordial Qi* is also known as *The Inner Writ of the Great Clarity*, *The Jade Mirror’s Treasured Chapters*, *The Golden Chart of Resplendent Script*, *The Talisman Breaking the Abyssal Cavern*, *The Mystic Vision’s Precious Register*, *The Scripture of Renwu Mountain*, *The Golden Life-Generating Strategy*, and *The Mighty and Martial Great One’s Scripture of Life-Support*.

Cultivated by the Jade Dawn Lord, those who obtain and practice it in the Secret and Pure Numinous Upper Palace may ascend or descend at will, conceal or reveal themselves, and attain the rank of Perfected One.

Primordial *qi* flows and transforms, congealing above to form Heaven, its hue a deep azure—hence the name *Primordial Qi*. The luminous workings of the Dao abhor killing and cherish life, warning of fortune and misfortune, serving as a mirror for the scholar. By divining good and evil, one may embrace auspiciousness and avoid calamity; in action and stillness, one preserves wholeness; through transformative guidance, merit is established; through accumulated virtue, the Dao is perfected. Without this secret, all efforts are in vain. Pursuing minor benefits invites great disaster—even ascending above the Twenty-Eight Heavens does not prevent one from falling into the realm of insects and grasses.

Thus, the highest Perfected Ones guard these treasures with utmost secrecy. If you are fortunate enough to encounter them, cultivate them in silence. All beings that contain *qi* are born through Primordial Qi, yet failing to awaken to it only deepens karmic bonds. Indulging in reckless nature dissipates one’s primordial *qi*. The deaths of the multitudes stem from unchecked evil, which annihilates the body—fleeting joy is brief, while suffering binds one in an endless night. In their compassion, the Supreme Sages reveal the wondrous *qi* of enlightenment, inscribing the numinous script of spontaneity and engraving the essential methods of cultivating goodness. Wear it, ingest it, contemplate it, recite it—practice it as prescribed, ceaselessly, and within nine years, you shall ascend to the Three Clarities.

Vast and boundless, it cannot be fully expressed—it is simply called the Spontaneous, signifying Primordial *Qi*. Primordial *qi* responds to virtue, transforming into form; forms bear names, and in broad terms, they are called Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cover and sustain, nurturing the myriad beings. The *qi* of life is abundant, and among all hues, it is foremost.

Gaze upon the form of Heaven, discern its color, preserve its spirit, and you shall obtain its *qi*. When *qi* descends to permeate the body, it harmonizes within and without, granting immortality and boundless transformation. Yet humans vary in sharpness and dullness, just as Heaven has its great, middle, and small, and its small, middle, and great. The myriad heavens array themselves in layers, their primordial numbers stacked without end; the myriad earths, too, are innumerable.

Each heaven possesses its Three Luminaries and Seven Perfected Ones without limit, while each earth has its Five Peaks, Eight Continents, Kunlun, and Sumeru—varying in size. What one encounters depends on their karmic resonance, and the benefits or harms of one’s dwelling place follow the fruits of their deeds. Some dwell in impurity yet remain pure; some dwell in purity yet remain impure. There are those of superior wisdom in lowly positions, and those of dull wit in noble ranks. Some vast lands lie barren, while small domains flourish. Some in high station suffer sorrow, while others in lowliness enjoy peace. Some men are weak and cowardly, while some women are fierce and strong. Some appear radiant yet are inwardly dim; others shine within but seem obscured without.

Some begin low and later rise; some start empty and later fill. Some are upright at first but deviate in the end; others stray at first but return to rectitude. Some stand alone, others in groups; some are alike, others different—countless variations defy enumeration.

Countless heavens share these variations, yet only the Great Canopy’s Three Heavens remain purely unified—one qi complete, lacking nothing.

Response follows perception, with manifestations myriad and boundless: some coarse, some subtle; some shallow, some profound. Though differing in weight, all are of the same pure essence, their diverse forms but branches of a single source. Traces appear according to the conditions of perception: some awaken upon witnessing celestial signs, the first rank of persons; some upon hearing divine sounds, the second; some upon seeing sacred diagrams, the third; some upon reading scriptural texts, the fourth; some upon beholding physical forms, the fifth; some upon hearing spoken teachings, the sixth; some upon perceiving reflections and images, the seventh; some upon encountering splendor and nobility, the eighth; some upon meeting simplicity and humility, the ninth; some upon witnessing manifest miracles, the tenth; some upon observing hidden obstructions, the eleventh; some upon perceiving the middle way, the twelfth. These twelve great ranks are divided into three tiers—upper, middle, and lower—each comprising four. Different practices yield different karmic fruits.

On earth, these twelve paths ascend to the Three Pristine Heavens of the Boundless, above all other heavens. Those of the highest learning traverse the twelve, refining their essence in the Three Pristine Realms. Abiding in the Three Pristine Realms, they no longer act. To act is to be bound by things—this is not what they seek. Before ascending to the Three Pristine Heavens, they may still act for others, balancing self and other in their conduct. Some devote little to themselves and much to others; some engage shallowly with others and deeply with themselves. Such variations in depth and shallowness give rise to the twelve ranks. Only those beyond depth and shallowness ascend to the Three Upper Realms.

The Three Upper Realms are originally one, responding to the three tiers. Before arrival, the three names remain distinct; upon arrival, they merge, and the three names dissolve. The lower realms acknowledge their existence and forcefully call them "One," though "One" is not a name—it is the master of all names. The master cannot be nameless, so it is designated as "One." This "One" unifies the countless honorific titles, such as "Mysterious Origin" and "Primordial Beginning." The Most High Honored Spirits are those whom practitioners must invoke as their master—yet these are not their true names, for names cannot be discarded.

Companions of the highest learning deeply understand causes and conditions, embodying them without doubt. Their cultivation is single-minded, and their single-mindedness yields results; their aspirations are certain to be fulfilled. Fulfillment comes from following the Daoist laws, which comprise three vehicles, each corresponding to twelve practices. These practices are expounded in the scriptures, with upper, middle, and lower ranks responding to the Three Caverns, which emerge in succession. At times, they manifest simultaneously, encompassing all texts. All texts and diagrams belong to the Three Caverns; the Three Caverns and the Three Pristine Realms correspond to the three vehicles. Each vehicle has twelve scriptures and precepts, totaling thirty-six divisions, which ferry boundless heavenly and human beings.

The depth of one’s karmic conditions determines what one attains—some more, some less; some shallowly, some deeply. Without utmost virtue, one’s name will not be inscribed in the Jade Register, the Azure Record, or the White Tablet. Such individuals cannot fully hear, see, understand, or practice the teachings. Each progresses according to what they receive, gradually ascending the ranks. Only those who attain completeness ascend to the Three Pristine Realms.

The Three Pristine Realms are Jade Purity, Highest Purity, and Supreme Purity. The Three Caverns are the Cavern of Perfection, the Cavern of Mystery, and the Cavern of Divinity. The Three Scriptures are the *Highest Purity* of the Cavern of Perfection, the *Numinous Treasure* of the Cavern of Mystery, and the *Three Sovereigns* of the Cavern of Divinity. The twelve practices are as follows:

Expounding the myriad dharmas, the mind abides in non-action while the traces engage in action. Though not acting for others, others benefit from their presence. Though not acting for themselves, they too are preserved. This appears to involve both mind and traces, yet the mind and traces do not dwell in such action. They give without seeing supplication, bestow without seeing the act of giving. This unseen seeing perceives the wondrous and constant, beyond thought or discussion. They turn evil toward good, responding to perceptions as they arise—not by their own desire, for desire is absent. How can there be burdens? The trace of burdenlessness is the responsive form of the Dao. This is what divine immortals and perfected beings all revere and cultivate, and its mastery is the first practice.

The mind abides in non-action while the traces engage in action. Forgetting the self to act for others, their virtue for others is lofty—this is the second practice.

The mind engages in action while the traces abide in non-action. Dwelling in seclusion with few affairs, they reduce complexity to simplicity, governing effortlessly and guarding stillness in non-action. Yet their minds remain contemplative, vigilant against wrongdoing, seeking goodness and avoiding evil—this is the third practice.

Abandoning the household to dwell among people, they relinquish attachment to loved ones, living in the world as equals. Cultivating virtue and establishing merit, they minimize selfishness and desire—this is the fourth practice.

Taking their household into the mountains and marshes, they conceal themselves to avoid temptation. They instruct and supervise superiors and inferiors, dispelling noise to attain tranquility. Wearing coarse clothes and eating simple food, they study the presence and absence of things. Resting on stone and rinsing with flowing water, they consume mist and ingest qi. Hearing nothing, their thoughts do not stray—this is the fifth practice.

Leaving the world to sever ties with others, they no longer cling to rulers or kin. Cutting off all attachments, they dwell alone and cultivate their master’s teachings—this is the sixth practice.

Remaining in the world, they harmonize with its dust and light, differing not in marriage or official rank. Their qi blends with darkness and brightness, yet they alone perceive refinement and simplicity. Without bias, they study independently and teach others to adapt to circumstances, whether open or obstructed. Their resolve remains unshaken—this is the seventh practice.

Severing desires to clarify resolve, they abandon wives and abstain from grains. When desires arise, they immediately examine themselves. Living in seclusion, they constantly perform rituals of repentance, wishing to sever all attachments—this is the eighth practice.

Without severing desires, they naturally transcend them, their essence preserved without stagnation. Wives and concubines gather around, musicians and entertainers are present, superiors and inferiors rejoice together, harmonizing in moderation. Without indulgence or excess, they follow only the Daoist laws. The rites of nobility and humility do not overstep their bounds. Celebrations gather in the pure wind, returning to the mysterious qi without stagnation. They remain vigilant to the end as they were in the beginning—this is the ninth practice.

Roaming the void, centering the will, neither clinging to the lower nor coveting the higher, they nurture their nature and cultivate their spirit, harming no beings. In their leisure, they aid the multitude without depleting themselves. Through gradual accumulation, they ascend of their own accord—this is the tenth practice.

Dwelling below the earth, residing in grottoes, they uphold stillness with sincerity, contemplating divine communion. Concealed yet without distress—this is the eleventh practice.

Abiding in the heavens, dwelling in radiant splendor, they extend grace and nourish all life, drawing from the primordial qi to preserve eternal existence. Their dignity remains unblemished—this is the twelfth practice.

These twelve practices are complete within the Three Vehicles. The teachings of the Three Vehicles each have their adherents, and many receive their names according to the Vehicle they attain. The Upper Grotto is called the Great Vehicle, the Middle Grotto the Middle Vehicle, and the Lower Grotto the Lesser Vehicle. Generally, they are named according to the preponderance of their practices, much as brocade is named for its most abundant hues.

Each of these twelve practices further contains twelve subdivisions: first, the script of nature; second, talismanic writ; third, annotated esoterica; fourth, diagrams and images; fifth, genealogies and records; sixth, precepts and disciplines; seventh, dignified deportment; eighth, methods and techniques; ninth, protective numerology; tenth, chronicles and biographies; eleventh, hymns of praise; and twelfth, memorials and petitions. Those who practice the twelve practices each possess these twelve subdivisions, arranged within the Three Grottoes, which interconnect and mutually illuminate. The mysteries vary in depth, and guidance is given according to causes and conditions. Those who cultivate them with refined understanding will swiftly perceive their effects; those who seek them carelessly will find their results delayed. Those who remain deluded and imprecise in their practice will find no confirmation of their efforts. To expect fruition through deviation is to invite prolonged scrutiny. Advanced learners and those of resolute aspiration must apply themselves with utmost care and caution.

The Talisman for Dispelling Stagnation is as follows:

All beings dwell within boundaries, where purity is scarce and impurity abundant. Filth and obstructions entwine them, preventing the establishment of good conduct. Malevolent qi encroaches, and fierce demons test the profound. Those who pursue the highest learning gradually purify the turbid through movement. Through fasting, purification, and meditative contemplation, they bar the clamor of the dusty world. Yet uninvited entities may intrude, coming and going without restraint. Within the household or other chambers, childbirth may occur; among relatives near or distant, there may be mourning or misfortune. Imprisonment, litigation, startled livestock, fleeing birds, sexual union, weeping, bloodshed, and wounds—all such sights are inauspicious. These are the entanglements of stagnant impurity, binding and unrelieved, clouding the spirit and causing confusion. One must immediately bathe, purify, and meditate to dissolve them.

Yet precise contemplation is difficult to sustain, and vigilant defense requires method. One should choose an auspicious day under a ruling star, fast, and make offerings to receive and wear the Talisman for Dispelling Stagnation. The qi of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine phoenixes, each with a head matching the body, soaring through the Three Realms. They draw the wondrous qi of the Three Clarities to sweep away the clamor of the Nine Earths. Worn upon the body, whether in motion or stillness, one remains perpetually pure. No impurity can encroach, no dust dare intrude. All calamities are averted, years extended without decline. Both hun and po are stabilized, ascending together to the Jade Clarity.

In the year of the Grand Year Star [X], on the first day of the [X] month of the [X] year, at the [X] hour, [X] prefecture, [X] commandery, [X] county, [X] village, [male/female] named [X], aged [X], respectfully requests the Great Talisman for Averting Calamity, Prolonging Life, Increasing Longevity, and Preventing Decline, to safeguard the years of life, traverse the Nine Calamities, sharpen hearing and sight, heal the joints, pacify the hun and settle the po, and ward off all stagnation. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Nine Elders of the Supreme!

Here ends the *Supreme Record of the Primordial Granary of the Cavern of Perfection*.
