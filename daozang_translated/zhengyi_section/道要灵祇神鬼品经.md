**General Preface on Spirits and Ghosts**
The *Lingbao Infinite Salvation Scripture* (Lingbao Wuliang Duren Jing) states:
*"The Central Dipper Grand Marshal (Zhongdou Dakuai) oversees all spirits, records life and death for the Earth Deities (Dizhi), and attends to their departures and arrivals, extracting them from the five sufferings and eight hardships of the Earthly Gate."*

The *Tongzhen Shangqing Secret Book of the Dragon Scripture* (Tongzhen Shangqing Yinshu Longwen Jing) states:
*"The Most High Dao Lord (Taishang Daojun) and the Primordial Heavenly King (Yuan Shi Tianwang) return to the Palace of Great Existence (Dahou Gong), where they revel in the wondrous courtyards of refined elegance (Miaoting Yanyuan). There, they gather violet clouds, chant the Seven Treasures (Qibao), spread crimson radiance (Danxia), array the Mysterious Platform (Xuantai), and all the splendid hues blaze forth. The light shatters the empty void (Yuxu), illuminating all the heavens, while the fragrance pervades the ten directions. Their brilliance is resplendent and ineffable—words cannot fully describe it. Thus, they convene the spirits of the boundless Dao (Wujing Lingzhi), from the teeming multitudes down to the smallest creatures, all rejoicing in their presence."*

**Spirits and Ghostly Manifestations**
The *Tongshen Sanhuang Jing* (Scripture of the Three Sovereigns’ Hidden Mysteries) states:
*"The divine (Shenming) knows what has not yet arisen—this is called *spirit* (shen). Clear hearing and sharp sight—this is also called *spirit* (shen)."*

The *Taiping Jing* states:
*"Spirit (Shen) arises from the Dao/Way (Dao) and moves through it, not from virtue/power (De). Thus, those who practice the Dao/Way (Dao) attain divine clarity (shenming), while those who rely on virtue/power (De) align with ghostly counsel (shenmou). The distinction between Dao/Way and virtue/power is clear—spirit and humanity are internally interdependent, and this can be observed today."*

It further states:
*"The ancient sages, divine and holy true persons (Shensheng Zhenren), all guarded the Dao/Way (Dao). In times of purity and stillness (Qingjing), even the spirits of food would call out and converse with them, just as people today summon guests."*

It also states:
*"The spirits of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases (Wuxing) all directly govern human destinies (minglu). How can one not revere them and remember their kindness? If one does not seek goodness, one offends the Heavenly Spirits (Tianshen). The Heavenly Spirits will then disrupt the seasons—when warmth should come, cold arrives, and when cold should come, warmth intrudes."*

It further states:
*"Great spirits are like loyal ministers to a state, maintaining and assisting the public order—this is what makes them great. If great spirits harbor private selfishness, the Heavenly Sovereign (Tianjun) will perceive it and withdraw their support. Thus, they dare not neglect their duties. Small spirits, however, are unrestrained."*

It also states:
*"The vital essences (shen) of the four seasons are like winds and waters, shifting to align with human intentions—whether benevolent or malevolent. When humans are upright, the spirits are upright; when humans are depraved, the spirits are depraved. Thus, one must find the right person to establish matters. Without the right person, the Dao/Way is difficult to apply."*

*"Water naturally conforms to the shape of its vessel—whether square or round—its form is without fixed constancy. Likewise, the winds and vital essences (qi) follow human cultivation, shifting between good and evil without fixed rule. This is their clear admonition (mingjie). The spirits of Heaven and Earth, along with the winds and vital essences (qi), all follow human actions—this is their clear admonition."*

The *Laozi Observing the Body Scripture of the Great Purity* (Laozi Guan Shen Taqing Zhongjing) states:
*"The eight trigrams’ Heavenly Spirits descend upon humans, eternally guarding the Great Unity (Taiyi) as emissaries of the eight directions. They oversee the calculations of the eight seasonal nodes (Bajie), determining the auspicious and inauspicious fortunes of the world.*

*The Heavenly Spirit of Qian (乾神) is surnamed Zhongni (仲尼), with the title Fuxi (伏戏).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Kan (坎神) is surnamed Dashangzi (大象子).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Gen (艮神) is surnamed Fei Xianwang (非先王).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Zhen (震神) is surnamed Xiao Zengzi (小曾子).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Xun (巽神) is surnamed Dayouhou (大忧侯).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Li (离神) is surnamed Wenchang (文昌).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Kun (坤神) is surnamed Yangzhuo (扬擢), with the radiant title Ruyang (耀王) and the name Nüwa (女娲).*
*The Heavenly Spirit of Dui (兑神) is surnamed Yishi (一世).*
*If humans regularly observe and honor the eight seasonal nodes (Bajie), it brings auspiciousness (ji)."*

The *Taishang Nüqing Guilü* (Most High’s Regulations for the Green Ghostly Woman) states:
*"For the first ten days of Jiazi (甲子), the malevolent spirit (Xingshen) is surnamed Xuan (玄), named Yuchong (玉冲).*
*For the second ten days of Jiaxu (甲戌), the malevolent spirit is surnamed Heng (恒), named Peng (捧).*
*For the third ten days of Jashen (甲申), the malevolent spirit is surnamed Ji (既), named Guinyinying (闺音盈).*
*For the fourth ten days of Jimao (甲午), the malevolent spirit is surnamed Ben (本), named Man (满).*
*For the fifth ten days of Jacheng (甲辰), the malevolent spirit is surnamed Heng (恒), named Jianzi (坚子).*
*For the sixth ten days of Jiayin (甲寅), the malevolent spirit is surnamed Su (苏), named Zaoyinluo (造音落).*
*These six malevolent spirits of Jia (六甲凶神) oversee calamitous and rebellious affairs (Eni Sha Shi)."*

The *Taishang Bashu Zhenjing* (Most High’s Scripture of the Eight Substances) states:
*"The first precept is: Do not dare to disrespect Heaven, nor claim that Heaven lacks spirit (shen), or that Earth lacks ghosts (gui)."*

**On Demons (Mozheng Pin)**
The *Taishang Taixiao Langshu Jing* (Most High’s Scripture of the Azure Tower’s Hidden Mysteries) states:
*"The Azure Tower’s youth (Langshu Qingtong) said: Demons (Mo) have many kinds—there are Heavenly Demons (Tianmo), Earthly Demons (Dimo), and Ghostly Demons (Guimo)."*

*"The Six Heavenly Great Demon Kings (Liutian Damo Wang) are the greatest of all demonic sovereigns. In their past lives, they cultivated great virtue/power (De), and thus they attained these demonic ranks. They compare their virtue/power with the Emperor of Heaven (Dishesa) and jointly oversee affairs in Heaven, Earth, and humanity. They are subordinate officials of the Most High Jade Capital (Taishang Yujing), beneath the Heavenly Emperor (Tiandi). They control all else."*

*"When humans study the Dao/Way (Dao), they first undergo trials by lesser demons (Xiao Mo). Once the Dao/Way is perfected, the Great Demon Kings (Damo Wang) all descend to test them. After passing the great trials, they are then recommended to ascend and take their place on the Jade Capital Platform (Yujing Tai)."*

The *Shengxuan Jing* (Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious) states:
*"The Most High said: Among eight men and eleven women who first hear this scripture, if they do not believe in it and leave their seats in doubt, the Heavenly Demons (Tianmo) will mislead them with false teachings, disturbing their hearts."*

**On Warrior Spirits (Lishi Pin)**
The *Tongyuan Jing* (Scripture of the Hidden Abyss) states:
*"Guardian Warrior Spirits (Shu Tang Lishi) record the names of humans and submit them to the officials of judgment (Kaoguan). These officials examine the spirits of those marked for calamity (Sha Ren), causing their vital essences (qi) and life forces (li) to stagnate, their souls (hun) and spirits (po) to wander, and thus leading to their deaths. Throughout the world, there is a Warrior Spirit named Wuxuan (乌玄), commanding 490,000 men. They patrol the borders, and if there are three-cavity (San Dong) masters reciting scriptures (Zhuanjing), even a single guardian or two will protect them, preventing any harm."*

**On Void Spirits (Kongshen Pin)**
The *Shengxuan Jing* (Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious) states:
*"The Most High incantation reads: ‘From the Eastern Void (Dongji Xukong), the Heavenly Spirits (Tian Shen) and Earthly Deities (Dizhi), the dragons and ghosts down to the lowest extremes, all descend into the Western Void (Xiji Xukong).’"*

**On the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Deities (Tian Shen Di Zhi)**
*"Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Deities, dragons and ghosts—listen truly to my command! This virtuous man, Dao Ling, now takes a solemn vow for the future, to become a great Master of the Dao, protecting all beings. You spirits should, from this day onward, take a solemn vow as well, leading your officials with earnest devotion to guard and protect him."*

**On the Community Deities (She Shen Pin)**
*The Laozi: Catalogue of Heaven, Earth, Ghosts, and Spirits* states:
*"The community deity of the capital is the Heavenly Right Minister. Left Yang, Right Yin, surnamed Huang, named Chong, originally from Jiangling in Yangzhou’s Jiujiang. His rank is *wan shi* (ten thousand bushels), and he oversees all famous mountains of the world, with all great deities of the communities serving under him. The community deity of Henan is the Heavenly Three Lights. Left Qing, Right Bai, surnamed Dai, named Gao, originally from Bohai in Ji Province. His rank is *wan shi*, overseeing the interplay of yin and yang, cursing and taking lives—thus, at the end of his term, the Heavenly Court seals him, and he supervises all blood-feeding ghosts and malevolent spirits across the land, great or small, none of whom dare disobey him.*

*The San Huang Jing* states:
*"The community deity of Yuzhou is surnamed Fan, named Li; of Yongzhou, surnamed Xiu, named Li; of Liangzhou, surnamed Huang, named Zong; of Kezhou, surnamed Zhang, named Yu; of Yangzhou, surnamed Zhou, named Hun; of Xuzhou, surnamed Han, named Ji; of Qingzhou, surnamed Yin, named Yu; of Yanzhou, surnamed Fei, named Ming; of Jizhou, surnamed Feng, named Qianji, and surnamed Dai, named Gao.*

*These nine communities correspond to the nine stars of Heaven and the nine palaces, overseeing the nine regions. Even common people can recall the names of the nine community deities—when one invokes them by name and asks of right or wrong, they reveal auspicious or inauspicious omens. They can reward the virtuous, punish the wicked, and save the people."*

**On Mountain Spirits (Shan Shen Pin)**
*The Lower Section of the Scripture of the Daoist Official’s Inquiry* states:
*"If one wishes to dwell in secluded mountain retreats, one must first receive the scriptures, practice with reverence, and perform good deeds to subdue the mountain spirits. Mountains, great or small, all have spirits. The greater the mountain, the greater its spirit; the smaller the mountain, the smaller its spirit. When the spirit is harmed, the person cannot stand either. If one does not understand the highest teachings and does not cultivate virtue or perform deeds, how can one long dwell in the mountains?"*

*The Laozi: Catalogue of Heaven, Earth, Ghosts, and Spirits* states:
*"The prison overseer of Taishan is surnamed Jun, named Hou.

**Língzhī Guǐpǐn** (灵祇鬼品):
*The Tai Shang Tai Zhen Ke Shang Jing* (太上太真科上经) states:
"All ghosts, regardless of refinement or coarseness, upon reaching the seventh generation, their good or evil deeds are resolved.
Good ghosts ascend to the **Guǐxiān Lù** (鬼仙录), while evil ghosts endure the trials of the **Knife Mountains, Sword Trees, and Fire Churns** (刀山剑树火擭之考).
When their bones and flesh are utterly consumed, they enter the **Mínglíng Dìyù** (溟泠地狱), where they suffer for ten thousand *kè* (劫) without rebirth."

*The Shòuxiān Dào Jing* (授仙道经) states:
"The Four Directions' Iron Encircled Mountains (铁围山), vast beyond the mountains themselves.
The **Tai Shang Lao Jun** (太上老君) out of compassion for life, established the Iron Encircled Mountains.
To isolate malevolent ghosts, preventing them from harming mortals."

*The Dàodé Jing* (道德经) states:
"With the **Dao/Way** (道) governing the world, its ghosts are not numinous.
If its ghosts are not numinous, the numinous ones will not harm mortals."

*The Dòngyuān Jing* (洞渊经) states:
"The **Dao/Way** (道) speaks of the time since **Fuxi** (伏羲), when armies were defeated, countless lives perished in vain by the sword, and the multitudes of the dead—some with **Língshī** (灵尸), their bones disjointed, heads separated from their bodies—cannot reunite.
Some have no heads, hands without arms, mouths without eyes, numbering in the thousands and millions, wandering and guarding themselves, leaning against mountains, resting by waters.
They converse with **Lǐ Zǐ'áo** (李子敖) in the clouds, roaming the shores of the seas, encompassing the **Shù** (束) of the four directions, riding the wind and steering sparrows, snatching humans' chickens and dogs, and forcing them to become malevolent spirits.
Thus, **Yāo** (妖) and **Méi** (魅) thrive, seeking human blood for sustenance.

It further states:
"Also, there is the **Dōulú Nuòguǐ** (都卢那鬼), three *zhàng* (丈) in height, with eyes and mouth askew, ears six *chǐ* (尺) long, and hands gripping iron rods.
They specialize in striking and killing evil humans in their paths, and there are also sixty-nine thousand ghosts, some becoming great **Wū** (乌).
Where these **Wū** (乌) pass, all fall ill, and the illness leads to death.

There are thirty-six thousand malevolent ghosts, named **Tian Chi** (天池), each accompanied by thirty thousand followers.
They roam the world, wrongfully killing the innocent.

In the year **Rénwǔ** (壬午), there are thirty-nine thousand **Chìguǐ** (赤鬼), named **Dàtóu** (大头), descending to kill mortals.

Ghosts of the mountains and forests are named **Jiāng Zǐdū** (江子都), leading two million nine hundred thousand ghosts.
They lurk to kill humans, assuming the guise of old men, entering households, and startling chickens and dogs.

Additionally, there are thirty-nine thousand **Chìjī Xiǎoguǐ** (赤积小鬼), who also enter households and take humans' livestock.

There are also the **Dàyùn Qīngguǐ** (大运青鬼), three *zhàng* (丈) in length, numbering four hundred ninety thousand.
They wield red rods, striking down the populace, but do not approach those who uphold the **Dharma** (法) with virtue.

It further states:
"There are the **Dàléi Guǐ** (大雷鬼), named **Jiǔchāng** (九昌), leading eight million lesser ghosts.
They hold red rods, entering the Central Realm (中国), and striking down evil mortals, inflicting thirty-six kinds of illnesses, which kill the wicked.

There are eighty million **Chìwěi Guǐ** (赤尾鬼), named **Duōhé** (多河), with one head and three tails, nine *chǐ* (尺) in length.
They hold water in both hands, causing mortals to suffer from chills and fever, and inflict ninety kinds of illnesses, which kill the wicked.

There are also the **Dàtóu Guǐ** (大头鬼), three *cùn* (寸) long, numbering in the thousands and millions.
They descend with **Chìniǎo** (赤鸟) numbering a hundred thousand, entering households and killing mortals.

There are thirty-six kinds of **Cǎoguǐ** (草鬼), which kill mortals.
When humans enter grasslands to gather vegetables, the white roots, stems, leaves, and branches of the grass may contain ghostly toxins.
The toxins are named **Shēngrú** (生如), with brothers numbering a hundred million.
Their **Qi** (气) can kill mortals, and when they strike, the illness enters the human body within ten days or a month, affecting all four limbs and hundred joints.
These are the **Huángchì Guǐ** (黄赤鬼), three *cùn* (寸) and seven *fēn* (分) in length.

Female ghosts of the mountains are named **Luó Wēng** (罗翁), with twenty million female attendants and officers.
These female ghosts also dwell at the edges of mountains, forests, and waters, lurking to kill mortals.

There is also a female ghost named **Shíjiāng** (石姜), whose appearance is most grotesque.
She is one *zhàng* (丈) in height, with a black face and eyes askew, her entire body red and yellow, and her body reeking with foulness.
Mortals who see her flee in terror, but **Daoists** (道士) who have cultivated boundless merit and are destined for transcendence, should respect the **Three Heavenly Saints** (三天圣人), and honor their teachers in three ways:
1. Teach them to receive the **scriptures** (经) and respect their teachers, without slandering others;
2. Teach them to nourish and support all **Daoists** (道士), without harboring jealousy;
3. Teach them not to consort with ordinary mortals.

If they do not follow these three precepts, the **Heavenly Beings** (天人) will censure them, and the ghosts will stir up malevolence, making the **Dao/Way** (仙道) difficult to establish.

It further states:
"There are eight million ghosts named **Wūtú Lúnnuò** (乌涂伦那), seven *zhàng* (丈) in length, numbering in the thousands and millions.
There are also great **Chìniǎo** (赤鸟), as large as chariot wheels, flying to devour mortals.
Those who uphold the **Three Caverns Scriptures** (三洞之经) and walk in the **Dao/Way** (道) will see these plagues die out.

There are also eighty-nine million **Chìmiàn Guǐ** (赤面鬼), named **Míngzhēn** (明真), each leading thirty-nine thousand lesser ghosts.
All hold red rods, striking down evil mortals.

There are also three million **Báitóu Guǐ** (白头鬼), named **Qiānlún** (千轮)."

The **Thousand-Headed Ghosts** (千输身) are three *zhàng* in length, with black faces and white heads, numbering in the tens of millions, and they bring down thirty-nine thousand kinds of diseases upon mortals.

There are also three thousand six hundred ghosts of various kinds that kill people.

There are thirty thousand **Harmful Ghosts** (害鬼), one hundred thousand **Stone Ghosts** (石鬼), twenty thousand **Wood Ghosts** (木鬼), three million six hundred thousand **Water Ghosts** (水鬼), six hundred thousand **Earth Ghosts** (土鬼), and one hundred sixty thousand **Insect Ghosts** (虫鬼)—all capable of killing mortals. These ghosts attach themselves to these elements to slay people: drowning in water, struck by stones in mountains, felled by trees, struck by the **Yin Qi of the Tiger** (寅气), buried in earth, or injured by insects in grass—all are unnatural deaths.

From this day forward, Daoists must exhort and transform the common folk, men and women alike, urging them all to follow the Dao. If they do not, the ghosts will drive them away, and they will daily fear the ghostly armies coming to punish them.

There are also eight thousand **Black-Eyed Ghosts** (黑目鬼), six *cùn* in length, riding birds as they fly, appearing in water or arriving with wind and rain to afflict mortals.

When people die, there are also thirty-nine thousand **Sand Ghosts** (沙鬼), three *cùn* long, red and white in color, multiplying in water to afflict mortals. There are also eight hundred thousand **Great Lǒu Ghosts** (大漯鬼), named **Great-Headed** (大头), with their leaders likewise named. Each leads thirty thousand ghostly bandits into the homes of evil people, causing fires that cannot be extinguished.

There are also great ghosts named **Bēngzhōu** (崩周). The **Ten-Directional Great Ghosts** (十方大鬼) are named **Jìzǐ** (季子), **Yāngxiōng** (央兄), and **Táojiāng** (桃姜). In years of the **Renwu** (壬午) cycle, they each lead twelve ten-thousands to China, killing evil mortals.

There are also eighty-nine thousand **Black-Faced Great Ghosts** (黑面大鬼), named **Red-Headed** (赤头), two *zhàng* and two *chǐ* in length. Forty-nine ten-thousands lead their groups, each falsely claiming to be an emperor’s spirit, terrifying households and gathering all unregistered ghosts—those questioned by the **Worldly Spirits** (世问魍魉), male and female calamities, **Tóuluōdīnglè** (头罗丁勒), **Nányáng Yègōng** (南阳叶公), **Shímǔ Dàzǐ** (石母大子), **Yúnzhōng Lǐzǐ** (云中李子), and the **Three Heavens’ Unrestrained Ghosts** (敖三天捺无着之鬼). A thousand ten-thousands and billions gather in human dwellings, taking young children, old women, and men, causing illness and death across the land—villages are ravaged, households perish, ghostly armies assemble in alleys, seizing people and livestock, creating eerie phenomena, leading to slander, imprisonment, and failed harvests. All matters turn ominous.

The *Tàishàng Nǚ Qīng Guǐ Lǜ* (太上女青鬼律) states:
Since the beginning of the **Huángtiān Yuán** (皇天元) era, beings have been reborn with cunning deceit, failing to believe in the Great Dao. The **Five Directions’ Retrograde Calamities** (五方逆煞) and pestilential qi have grown rampant. Tigers, wolves, and ten-thousands of beasts grow large with this qi, while insects, serpents, and spirits worsen daily. There are a thousand ghosts flying and wandering chaotically, unrestrained. The Great Dao does not govern, the Celestial Masters do not intervene, and chaos spreads across the land, relentlessly killing the common folk—billions perish. Later, when Daoist men and women are born in office and encounter my secret scriptures, knowing the names of these ghosts, they will all be preserved from calamity, and the ten-thousands of ghosts will not dare approach.

In the **Highest Heaven** (高天), spanning ten-thousands of *zhàng*, the **Great Ghosts** (大鬼) and **Hundred Ghosts** (百鬼) are led by **Middle Sovereign** (中皇), surnamed **Mó**, named **Tiān**—the lord of the six ten-thousands of ghosts, residing at the southeast corner of **Tàishān** (太山). The ghosts of those who drowned in water are also summoned to the heavens for questioning and punishment, once a month.

Since ancient times, there have been thirty-six thousand ghosts.

There are also the **Three Elders of the Southern Region** (南乡三老鬼), the **Five Path Ghosts** (五道鬼), surnamed **Chē**, named **Shì** (适), overseeing the registries of the dead, calculating the sins of the living—all under their jurisdiction. Their palace is in the northwest corner of Tàishān, also belonging to Tàishān. There is a **Summon-and-Return** (召一还) ritual here, and this ghost is the **Heavenly Calamity** (天煞) responsible for official documents.

The **Three Stars of the Eastern Dipper** (东斗三台鬼) are surnamed **Jué** (角), named **Chē** (车).
The **Three Stars of the Southern Dipper** (南斗三台鬼) are surnamed **Bìn Wǔdiàn** (殡武殿), named **Wēnfū** (温夫).

These three are the **Heavenly Yin-Yang Ghosts** (天阴阳鬼) who govern the killing of mortals.

When these plague spirits descend, all people and diseases obey them.
**Liúyuándá (刘元达)** and others spread their poisonous harm across the Five Directions. Those who do not follow the Dao/Way or uphold its precepts are struck by their disasters. But those who practice goodness, purify themselves, preserve the Dao/Way, and follow its teachings—if they know the names of these ghosts—shall all subdue them.
Those who must depart shall be sent far away;
Those who must remain shall be driven back, their evil cohorts dispersed.
They shall then make new pacts, no longer harming the virtuous."*
