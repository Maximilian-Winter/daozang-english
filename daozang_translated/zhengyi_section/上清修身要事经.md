### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Essential Practices for Cultivating the Body*

#### **Method One: The Purple Text of the Grand Tenuity’s Numinous Book for Restraining the Three Hun**
Daoists must first discipline the *hun* and *po*, eliminating corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, the *gengshen* day, and the *jiayin* day, one should enter seclusion in purity, bathe to cleanse the dust, and sit upright upon a mat. Those who remain awake gain greater benefit. With a brush of cinnabar, mark the lower corner of the left eye; with a brush of realgar, mark the lower part of the right nostril, allowing the pigment to penetrate slightly inward.

Upon completion, strike the teeth three times and recite the incantation:
*"The twin luminaries coil in flight, cinnabar and realgar scatter mist.
Qi seizes the empty and perverse; corpse-filth sinks into oblivion.
Harmonize the hun, refine the po; unite form with the great spirit.
Grant me undying life, eternal wholeness,
keen vision, and ever-flowing divine essence."*

Finish by striking the teeth three more times, swallowing saliva thrice, and pressing the second finger of the right hand to the lower corner of the left eye, then the second finger of the left hand to the lower part of the right nostril—seven times each. Press firmly without lifting the hands. This concludes the practice.

These two points are the gateways through which the seven *po* and wandering corpses roam, the bridges by which demonic spirits and malevolent forces traverse. Thus, they receive the essence of cinnabar and realgar, sealing the paths of corpse-demons and infusing the twin luminaries’ fragrance to extinguish the qi of licentious chaos. This is a supreme method of the Great Ultimate. By practicing it regularly, the *hun* and *po* will harmonize, corpse-filth will disperse and vanish, and one may attain longevity as a divine immortal with penetrating vision. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts will entirely fade.

These days are called the "Days of Strife Between Corpse and Demon." Men and women must not share the same mat. Be cautious.

Whenever studying the profound Dao or reciting sacred scriptures, after every ten or twenty words, lick the lips and swallow saliva three times. After every fifty or a hundred words, strike the teeth two or three times to summon spirits, harmonize the divine, and settle the blood and qi, causing the numinous essence to congeal and fill the body, delighting the Celestial Unity. This is what is meant by "the qi flows without effort, dim yet not dissipated."

Daoist methods forbid weeping or spitting, for these deplete the fluids and leak the essence, exhausting the throat and brain. Thus, perfected ones and Daoists constantly practice exhalation, inhalation, and swallowing to harmonize the six fluids.

Daoists should always visualize their own form, making it vividly appear before them. Imagine the face perpetually illuminated by the light of the sun and moon, bathing the entire body in radiance—the sun on the left, the moon on the right, nine inches from the face.

Upon completing the visualization, peck the teeth three times and recite:
*"Primordial womb, perfected one of the upper realm,
twin luminaries of the two mysteries,
on the right, embrace the seven po;
on the left, restrain the three hun.
Grant me divine clarity, that spirit and form may endure together."*

Finish by striking the teeth twenty-one times and swallowing saliva seven times. This is called the "Method of the Celestial Lord for Visualizing the Form, Restraining the Hun, and Disciplining the Po." It bestows keen intelligence, immortality, and eternal life. If unable to recite the incantation, visualization alone suffices.

All Supreme Clarity methods for striking the teeth and swallowing saliva follow specific procedures, with a proper sequence. They must not be practiced haphazardly, lest the true spirits become confused.

Striking the teeth commands the spirits; swallowing qi harmonizes the true. Inhaling and swallowing the six fluids to circulate and restrain the spirits requires the sounding of the ritual drum in proper order.

In all Supreme Clarity practices, when performing rites or reciting incantations, first peck the teeth, striking upper and lower together—never side to side. With each exhalation and inhalation, swallow the qi and fluids. This is called "summoning the spirits and harmonizing the true" for the sake of ascending as an immortal.

On the evening of the third and thirteenth days of the lunar month, the three *hun* become unsettled. The Radiant Spirit wanders, Fetal Light manifests its form, and Dark Essence stirs and calls. *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing* are the names of the three *hun* spirits. On these evenings, they abandon the body and roam, swiftly departing their chambers. They may be detained or restrained by other spirits, seized by ghostly entities, or fail to return, causing the form to disperse. They may clash with external spirits, their two qi contending, agitating the "red child" and inducing stray thoughts, aimless comings and goings, sorrow, and melancholy.

Cultivators must restrain and retain them to prevent their escape. The method for restraint is as follows: Lie supine with the head elevated, extend the feet, and cross the hands over the heart. Close the eyes, hold the breath for three cycles, strike the teeth three times, and visualize a red qi the size of a chicken egg rising from within, emerging through the eyes. As it exits, the red qi expands, enveloping the body, flowing downward and upward to the neck, transforming into fire that engulfs the entire form, inside and out, like burning charcoal. When finished, one should feel a slight warmth in the body. Then strike the teeth three times and visualize calling the names of the three *hun*: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, *Youjing*—commanding them to halt at once.

Recite softly:
*"Palace of the Grand Tenuity, Primordial Yellow and First Green,
refine the three hun within, Fetal Light be at peace.
Jewel chamber of the divine treasure, born with me,
do not move recklessly. The Great Numinous One oversees.
If you wish to fly, ascend only to the Great Ultimate and Supreme Clarity.
If you hunger or thirst, drink only the Jade Essence of the Returning Spring."*

This concludes the practice.

#### **Method Two: The Purple Text of the Grand Tenuity’s Numinous Book for Restraining the Seven Po**
On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and last day of the lunar month, the seven *po* wander and drift, roaming through filth and impurity. They may commune with blood offerings, consorting with ghosts and spirits, or enter into dead corpses. They may seduce the "red child" into licentiousness and assault the home, or report a person’s sins to the Three Officials and the River Earl. They may transform into *wangliang* spirits, causing people to be afflicted by malevolent forces, or lead ghosts into the body to summon evil and slay the essence.

All afflictions and ailments that befall the living arise from the sins of the *po*; delight in others’ deaths is the nature of the *po*; desire for others’ ruin is the malady of the *po*. The Daoist must restrain and discipline them, refine and transform them, suppress and halt them, subdue and overawe them.

The first *po* is named Corpse Hound; the second, Crouching Arrow; the third, Sparrow Yin; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Non-Poison; the sixth, Removing Filth; the seventh, Stinking Membrane. These are the yin names of the seven *po*, the turbid ghosts within the body.

The method of restraint and regulation: cross your hands over the nape of your neck, hold your breath seven times, and click your teeth seven times. Visualize a white *qi* at the tip of your nose, small as a bean, which gradually grows larger until it envelops your body in nine layers, descending to your feet and ascending to the crown of your head. Once complete, the white *qi* suddenly transforms into a Celestial Beast. Command two Azure Dragons to stand within your eyes, two White Tigers within your nostrils, all facing outward. A Vermilion Bird perches above your heart, facing your mouth. A Green Dragon lies beneath your left foot, a Numinous Serpent beneath your right. In your ears stand Jade Maidens clad in dark brocade, stationed at the ear gates, each holding a flame in hand.

After a long while, swallow your saliva seven times and click your teeth seven times. Then call the names of the seven *po* and softly intone:
*"Pristine *qi* revolves ninefold,
Restraining the *po*’s malevolence and ferocity.
Celestial Beast guards the gate,
Maidens wield the bolts.
Refine the *po* to harmony and gentleness,
That they may dwell in peace with me.
Do not stir recklessly,
But observe and examine the origin of forms.
If you hunger or thirst,
You may drink the Moon’s Yellow and the Sun’s Cinnabar."*

This concludes the practice. Thus, the seven *po* are inwardly sealed, bound to submission. If practiced constantly, the turbid *po* will dissolve below, returning to goodness and abiding in the body. Above, they harmonize with the Three Palaces and unite with the primordial to merge with the numinous.

#### **Method Three: The Venerable Perfected of the Great Simplicity’s Teaching for Beginners to Avert Nightmares**
If one frequently encounters nightmares, they may be of three kinds: first, *po*-demon harassment; second, trials of the heart; third, corpse-thieves. Here is the method to dispel and dissolve them.

Upon waking from a dream, pinch your philtrum with your left hand thirty-four times, click your teeth thirty-four times, and softly intone:
*"Great Cavern, truly mysterious,
Zhang refines the Three *Hun*.
Let the first *hun* swiftly guard the seven *po*,
The second *hun* swiftly guard the Muddy Pellet,
The third *hun* receive the heart’s command,
Swiftly summon the Three Lords of the Great Simplicity."*

*"The inauspicious dream just encountered
Was the seven *po*’s wandering corpse come to conspire,
The source of ten thousand evils.
Hasten to call Peach-Kang to protect life,
Report above to the Imperial Lord,
The Five Elders and Nine Perfected,
All guarding the gates of the body.
Yellow Gate Divine Master,
Purple Portal General,
Grasping halberds and holding bells,
They rout and destroy evil miasmas,
Turning misfortune to fortune,
Severing ties with life and death."*

This concludes the practice. If you lie down again, you will surely receive a favorable response. The malevolent *qi* that once formed the nightmare will be sealed beneath the Celestial Pass. After three years, only divine resonance will evoke dreams, and all dreams will reveal clear foresight of things to come. No longer will there be ominous portents or inauspicious visions.

If you encounter a propitious dream at night, a fortunate omen or pleasant vision that your heart deems auspicious, then upon waking, rub your eyes thirty-four times, click your teeth thirty-four times, and softly intone:
*"Supreme High Essence,
Three Emperors’ Cinnabar Numinous,
Crimson Palace luminous and clear,
Auspicious resonance declares its intent.
The Three Origins soften the *po*,
The Heavenly Thearch bestows the scripture.
All directions harmonize,
Flying immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity,
Ever with the Jade Perfected,
Together assembling in the Purple Court."*

This concludes the practice.

This is the profound secret method of the Great Cavern, transmitted to those who first wade into the stream of the Dao.

**Four Methods of Auspicious Dreams Received by the Perfected of Supreme Simplicity**
Whenever a scholar in training dreams of a woman dressed in purple silk, bearing a tray of food to offer, partake of it without fear or aversion. This food consists entirely of the true essences of the Eastern Sea or the wondrous herbs from the Five Peaks of Mount Song, and consuming it may extend one’s lifespan.

Whenever a Daoist lies down to rest during the day, first press the eyes with both hands four times, thirty-seven cycles, and click the teeth thirty-seven times before reclining.

Whenever a Daoist retires at dusk, press the nostrils with the left hand thirty-seven times, click the teeth thirty-seven times, and then recline.

**Five: The Yellow Simplicity Daoist’s Prayer for Peaceful Sleep**
When a Daoist is about to sleep, stroke the heart three times with the hand, close the eyes, and softly intone:
*"Supreme Numinous Nine Palaces,
Great One guards the chamber,
A hundred spirits attend their stations,
Hun and po harmonize as one,
Long life without death,
Sealing away all evil and misfortune."*
Then sleep.

**Six: Jade Clarity’s Prayer to Dispel Demons and Subdue Malevolent Spirits**
Whenever a Daoist travels alone and lodges in a place haunted by demonic essences or evil ghosts, click the left teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath, and softly intone:
*"Supreme Thearch of Yang Primordial,
Four Nether Gates of the Dark,
A thousand demons, ten thousand poisons,
Dare not face me!
Mighty beasts with layered jaws,
Rip open bellies, sever livers,
Divine lords and messengers,
Guard and patrol in rotation,
Yellow-robed master soldiers,
Slay and behead demonic spirits,
Decapitate a thousand demons,
Crush and cast down all evil,
Exterminate their kind, annihilate their lineage,
Render them utterly destroyed,
By the command of the Jade Emperor,
Purify and sweep the Three Origins."*
Then click the teeth thirty-six times again. This is called the *Supreme Thearch’s Inner Prayer to Wield the Spirits and Annihilate Myriad Demons*.

**Seven: The Yellow Simplicity Daoist’s Method for Encountering Inauspicious Objects During Purification**
When a Daoist enters a chamber for purification and encounters an inauspicious object, perform the Northern Emperor’s prayer to expel ghosts. First click the left teeth thirty-six times and intone:
*"Two Images reverse their course,
Banner of the Dark One,
Seven Numinous protect life,
Ascend to the Three Clarities,
Twin August Ones drive away,
Terrifying the legions of Luo,
Three hundred thousand soldiers,
Attend the divine encampment,
Mighty beasts a hundred yards long,
Spit forth might to seize essences,
Brandish swords to chase away evil,
Behead and cast down demonic spirits,
By the prayer of the Divine Lord,
A thousand demons annihilate their forms."*
Then click the teeth thirty-six times again.

**Eight: The Azure Waist Purple Writ’s Method for Refining and Praying Over the Dead**
When cultivating the Dao of Upper Clarity, if the practitioner’s parents, uncles, brothers, or other kin die in the world, and the practitioner has not yet severed their traces, thus encountering the corpse of one who has died among the living, on the third day take a jar of pure water and one tael of true cinnabar, cast them into the water, and stand facing south in the central courtyard before the water. Click the teeth nine times and intone:
*"Qi transforms into spirit,
Corpse transmutes into the mysterious,
Three transformations, five refinements,
Ascend into the Nine Heavens,
Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens,
Cross over into a new body,
The body further transforms,
Attaining the Perfected."*
Afterward, if the deceased is male, visualize three Jade Lads; if female, visualize seven Jade Maidens. Fill the jar with water and pour it over the corpse, then wash one’s own hands and face with the water, rinsing the mouth toward the sky.

Then secretly intone:
*"Heavenly qi is now pure,
Human transformation is now born,
Attaining birth in the heavens above,
Nine transformations renew the form,
Five sufferings, Three Paths,
Sever the name of death,
Deliver the destitute souls,
Return to the Southern Court."*
Cease. Thus the deceased will undergo further transformation and be reborn in the heavens above, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace after nine years. This method surpasses the Great Cavern’s method for delivering the seven ancestors. It is a secret of the Jade Emperor, not to be transmitted to the unworthy. Those who possess the *Golden Name Imperial Chart* in green characters on purple script—having seen this text—must not lightly employ it or recklessly disclose it to others. Otherwise, the seven generations of ancestors will be eternally confined to the ghostly bureaus, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release.

The *Four Extremities Bright Statutes* have existed for seven hundred years. Perfected Ones, heed this transmission.

**Nine: The Azure Waist Purple Writ’s Method for Encountering Another’s Corpse While Traveling the Dao**
Whenever a scholar of the highest learning traverses the paths of the world and suddenly encounters a corpse along the way, its defiling qi assailing the body, the practitioner should walk twenty-four steps, stop, face north, and click the teeth nine times. If the corpse is male, visualize three Jade Lads; if female, visualize seven Jade Maidens, coming to invite the practitioner to the Jade Valley, where they draw yellow mushroom and pure water to pour over the corpse. In a moment, visualize the corpse transforming and reviving as a living person, then secretly intone:
*"Withered, revive in glory,
Extinguished, revive in life,
Attaining birth in the heavens above,
Receiving the Supreme Numinous,
Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens,
Reversing and renewing the embryo,
Defilements and burdens dissolve and vanish,
White corpse revives."*
Cease, then wipe the eyes fourteen times. Thus the defiling qi will disperse, and the dead will undergo further transformation, later becoming a spirit-person.

If the practitioner encounters this twenty-four times and performs this refining prayer, merit will be fulfilled, virtue augmented, and their name inscribed in Upper Clarity. After twenty-four years, they will be able to ride the spirit-chariot and soar through the Nine Mysteries.

**Ten: The Method for Assessing the Auspiciousness of Mountain Dwellings Based on Foreign Categories**
*Inner Inscription of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds of the Abyssal Cavern:*
**First Rampart:** Earth of lustrous color—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*, each one.
**Second Rampart:** Earth of rigid color—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*, each one (same below).
**Third Rampart:** Earth of stone-fat luster—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.
**Fourth Rampart:** Earth of moist luster—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.
**Fifth Rampart:** Earth of golden millet luster—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.
**Sixth Rampart:** Earth of adamantine iron color—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.
**Seventh Rampart:** Earth of water-controlled luster—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.
**Eighth Rampart:** Earth of great wind luster—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound*.

**Ninth Rampart:** Earth of cavernous abyss, colorless and adamantine—*Correct Sound, Moving Sound, Wandering Sound, Brahma Sound* of the qi of the cardinal directions.

When desiring to ascend a mountain for dwelling or to establish a residence, examine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the land. On a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe the thirty-six sounds of the nine earths in yellow script upon white paper, place it at the center of the intended dwelling, and cover it with an earthen jar. After three nights, uncover and observe: if the paper appears moist and yellow, it is greatly auspicious; if blue, there lies a corpse of the dead beneath; if white, it is inauspicious; if red, there will be fright and terror; if black, there is buried treasure; if purple, one will attain immortality. If no changes appear, the land is correct and may be dwelt upon securely for three years—beyond this, harm will surely follow.

**Method of Invocation for the Eight Mighty Wieldings of the Divine Staff (11):**
*"Primordial Supreme Perfection, Five Numinous Exalted Ones, Radiant Sovereign of Great Brilliance, Luminous Eight Gates, Five Elders Declare the Mandate—none in the hidden depths escapes their hearing. Above, they govern the Nine Heavens; at the center, they command Mount Feng; below, they rule the rivers and seas, the twelve water sources. The Eight Mighty Divine Incantations, the numinous staff of jade script, summon dragons to bear water, gather qi to amass clouds, bind demons and dispatch ghosts, sweep away hordes of malevolent spirits, shatter the myriad spirits, and annihilate all that is condemned without exception. Sun, moon, and five planets; the Northern Dipper’s seven luminaries; all heavens and all earths; all waters and all mountains; the jade perfected under their command; the great spirits of the netherworld; the Immortal Kings at their feasts; the Five Emperors with their staves and banners; the Heavenly Soldiers as vanguard; the Golden Tigers in pursuit; the fierce beasts of the celestial apes; the guardians arrayed at the four gates—what is called arrives instantly, what is summoned appears before one. The vermilion script blazes forth, wind and fire unceasing. Wherever there is verification and subjugation, the golden dragon swiftly transmits. Conclude by knocking the teeth nine times, raising the head to the sky and emitting three whistles, drawing in the celestial qi three times, and pointing the Eight Mighty Staff’s script toward the designated place. Hold the breath for nine breaths and cease."*

**Method for Wielding the Divine Staff (12):**
When a Daoist wishes to employ the method of the divine staff, they should knock their teeth thirty-six times and visualize the *Direct Talisman Officials* of the Five Emperors, each clad in the color of their respective direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. Each of the Five Emperors’ Jade Maidens stands in attendance, guarding the staff to left and right. Silently intone:
*"Mountain of the Great Yang, primordial essence of the Highest Beginning, opener of heaven and extender of earth, sweet bamboo conduit of the numinous. Direct Talisman Guardians, officials who command the divine soldiers, five-colored radiance flowing upon the staff, crimson robes and golden bells—assist the perfected ones, emerging from darkness into obscurity. Summon the heavens, and the heavens obey; subjugate the earth, and the earth yields. Point at ghosts, and ghosts perish; bind demons, and malevolence takes form. The numinous talisman and divine staff command might over the hundred directions. With me they are accomplished, with me they are born. After ten thousand kalpas, they shall replace my form, their shadows becoming the Five Liberations. My spirit ascends to the Upper Clarity, receiving the talisman and proclaiming the mandate—none dare fail to heed with reverence."*
Conclude by drawing in the qi of the five directions twenty times. Point the staff toward the heavens, and the celestial deities will render homage; point it toward the earth, and the earthly spirits will receive and welcome. Point the staff toward the northeast, and the myriad ghosts will be bound in form.

**Purple-Script Method for Rescuing the Sun During an Eclipse (13):**
Purple-script oral formula: On the day of the eclipse, expose oneself in the central courtyard. Face the sun with a bright mirror, wield a large blade, and knock the teeth thirty-six times while facing south. Raise the head and intone:
*"Luminous Child of the Sun, essence of the radiant yang, Illuminating Perfected One of the Net, Jade Spirit within the shadow—through the cycles you ride the qi, ascending and descending in solemn clarity. The dark sphere plots within, encroaching upon the sun’s court. The Heavenly Mirror wields the staff; the Emperor’s ministers command the soldiers. The Three and Five hold their proper positions; the yang light shines through. Heaven and earth alternate in devouring—what presumptuous phantom dares arise? Return each to its place; let no deficiency or excess occur. The Jade Emperor proclaims the mandate—none dare fail to halt in reverence."*
Then draw in the qi twenty-four times and cease. Thus, heaven and earth return to their positions, the Three and Five shine in unison, the Luminous Child is moved to joy, the sun’s radiance returns, and the mysterious influx of flowing light descends upon one’s form. One’s name is inscribed upon the purple tablets, recorded in the jade chapters of the Upper Clarity. Within nine years, one shall ride the green chariot, soaring through the void, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

**Purple-Script Method for Rescuing the Moon During an Eclipse (14):**
Purple-script oral formula: On the day of the lunar eclipse, at dusk, expose oneself in the central courtyard. Take a jar of pure water, wield a blade, and face the moon while knocking the teeth sixteen times. Raise the head and intone:
*"Heaven and earth separate and unite; the round qi waxes and wanes. Encroaching upon the moon’s chamber, it offends the yellow radiance. The Emperor’s ministers wield their staves; the Jade Dawn mends the flaw. The heavenly soldiers array themselves; the divine lords unleash their might. What presumptuous phantom dares cling to the shadow and exploit the faint? Swiftly return to your original place; let no transgression occur."*
Repeat this invocation three times while facing the moon. With the blade, stir the water in the jar three times to the right, then cease. Face the water and draw in the qi sixteen times. The lunar eclipse will then dissolve, the celestial scene will be solemn and clear, the Three and Five will shine in unison, and the myriad palaces will be at peace. The True Person and Lady of Luminous Radiance within the moon, moved to joy and delight, will turn their mysterious radiance toward you. They shall record your name before the Northern Emperor, strike your name from the ledger of the dead, and inscribe it in the jade chapters of the Azure Palace. Twelve Jade Maidens shall be granted to attend and guard your form. After nine years of such practice, you shall ride the flying rosy clouds to ascend to the Moon’s Court. This method is most wondrous—do not practice it in the world. Those who obtain it must treasure and conceal it; be cautious never to transmit it lightly.

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Dispelling Filth and Impurities (Fifteen)**
Whenever a Daoist encounters a corpse, blood, or any impure substance, they should take a *zhū* of cinnabar, scatter it into water, and use it to wash their eyes, rinse their mouth, and cleanse their hands and feet. Upon completion, they shall enter their chamber, assume a proper resting posture, cross their hands over their heart, and knock their teeth together twice seven times. Then, bowing in the four directions, they shall recite the prayer:

*"The Three Primes and the Supreme Dao,
The Great One guards my form.
The Lord of Life and the Divine Youth,
The Five Spirits bring yellow peace.
Blood-corpses scatter and vanish,
Ominous filth sinks and decays.
The Seven Fluids coil and infuse,
The Five Viscera bloom anew.
Grant that I, a divine immortal,
Enjoy enduring prosperity and purity."*

After the prayer, close both eyes and hold the breath for a long while; a slight warmth within the body shall serve as the sign. Then knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva thrice. This is the Inner Method of the Three Primes for Dispelling Impurities.

---

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Combing Hair and Washing the Head (Sixteen)**
Whenever a Daoist combs their hair to arrange their topknot or washes their head with unbound hair, they shall first knock their teeth together seven times, then recite the prayer:

*"The Supreme Emperor scatters blossoms,
The Mysterious Yin, great spirit.
On this auspicious day,
I comb my hair and wash away dust.
Banish evil, dispel misfortune,
Attain long life as a divine immortal."*

After reciting, arrange the topknot. Upon completion, knock the teeth together seven times again. This is called the Supreme Emperor’s Blossom-Scattering Inner Method for Combing Hair. Practicing it ensures freedom from illness throughout the year, sharp hearing and vision, and no pain in the head or brain.

---

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Bathing the Body and Washing Hands and Face (Seventeen)**
Whenever a Daoist bathes their body or washes their hands and face, they shall first stand before the water and knock their teeth together three times, then recite the prayer:

*"The Four Great open and brighten,
Heaven and Earth endure as constants.
Mysterious waters cleanse impurity,
Banishing inauspicious omens.
The Twin Stars guard the gate,
The Seven Spirits settle the chambers.
Cloudy essences refine and bathe,
Myriad qi harmonize in health.
Within and without, prosperity and purity,
Preserve this yellow robe."*

After the prayer, knock the teeth together three more times, then wash the hands and face. This is called the Seven Chambers Prayer Method for Bathing Away Filth and Dispelling Misfortune. Those who practice it regularly shall attain divine clarity, vigorous blood, and repel all malign qi.

---

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Praying Before Fasting and Eating (Eighteen)**
Whenever a Daoist enters seclusion for fasting, before eating, they shall hold their chopsticks in their left hand, knock the plate three times, and recite the prayer:

*"The Two Mysteries and the Supreme Dao,
The Four Poles are pure and cool.
The Supreme One, Lord of Emperors,
The Hundred Spirits bring yellow peace.
Receive sustenance in the Three Palaces,
Irrigate the numinous spleen.
Offer up the Supreme Harmony,
Feast on the five fragrant flavors.
The soul-embryo receives life,
The Seven Fluids flow and settle.
The hundred passages open in harmony,
The Five Viscera bloom with light.
The Twin Stars merge their radiance,
Soaring to ascend the Upper Clarity."*

After eating, knock the plate three more times. This is called the Way of the Soul-Embryo Receiving Fragrance and the Hundred Spirits Feasting on Sustenance. Practicing it regularly ensures divine clarity, harmonious qi, peaceful hun and po, dispels evil and trials, and perpetually preserves prosperity. The prayer is recited before eating.

When a Daoist faces a sumptuous feast, they shall compose their mind and focus on unity, visualizing the food before consuming it. After eating, they shall silently recite the prayer:

*"The hundred grains enter the stomach,
Uniting with the spirit in qi.
They replenish blood and fluids,
Causing corpse-demons to fall away.
Ascend in flight to the Golden Towers,
Abide long between Heaven and Earth.
Command the Six Dings,
Divine youths attend and guard."*

Those who practice this consistently shall cause malign qi to retreat and true qi to advance. The prayer is recited after eating.

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Daoists’ Self-Massage of the Head and Face (Nineteen)**
To seek the Dao, one must first ensure clear eyes and sharp ears. The ears and eyes are the ladder for seeking the true and the gate for gathering the numinous; gain and loss are determined in an instant, and life and death are discerned by them. The great teachings are here revealed for practice:

Press the small hollows behind both eyebrows twenty-seven times. Then, with the palms and fingers, massage the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones. Next, rotate the ears thirty times, then stroke the forehead upward twenty-seven times, swallowing saliva as needed, without limit. Practicing this regularly sharpens hearing and vision. Perform it discreetly in private, and do not speak of its details.

Next, stroke the head in all four directions, smoothing the hair toward the topknot, repeating often. This disperses blood flow and prevents wind-dampness from congealing. Upon completion, press the four corners of the eyes eighteen times until one’s vision becomes clear and bright. This is the method for refining the spirit of the eyes. Practicing it regularly allows one to perceive the hundred spirits.

**The Supreme Yellow Plain Method for Seeking Responses Before Transmitting Teachings (Twenty)**
When transmitting the above methods, the master possessing the scriptures shall first seek a response before imparting them. They shall enter their chamber, burn incense, and secretly vow before the spirits. Then, bowing before the scriptures, they shall softly recite the prayer:

*"Supreme Primordial Sovereign,
Great Spirit of the Immortal Capital,
On this auspicious day,
I present eight vows.
Desiring to transmit the superior methods,
I dare to inform the numinous origin.
Whether it is permissible,
Await your response before proclaiming."*

After the prayer, retire to rest, and a numinous response shall surely be received. The disciple shall then know in their heart whether it is proper to transmit the teachings.

**The Jade Clarity Demon-Quelling Jade Emperor’s Prayer for Ghostly Defense and Numinous Protection (Twenty-One)**
The Jade Emperor’s prayer states:

*"The Nine Heavens issue the decree,
The Supreme Decree of Jade Clarity.
Hasten the summoning of the thousand perfected,
All to assemble in the imperial court.
The Great One gazes downward,
The Twin Sovereigns flank the form.
Scrutinizing the myriad evils,
Governing qi and preserving life.
If any inauspiciousness
Offends and tests the divine,
Invoke the Emperor’s Way,
Command the divine soldiers to prepare.
The Seven Spirits wield their axes,
The Celestial Blade marches to the right.
Brandish the sword to lead the vanguard,
Fling the fire-bells with radiance.
Issue the summons to the armored couriers,
The martial warriors and celestial Dings.
Wind and fire join the battle,
Vanquishing demons and subduing spirits.
Above, awe the Six Heavens,
Below, subdue the demonic numina.
Having awed and subdued them,
The myriad evils vanish in form.
The divine halberd sweeps like lightning,
No treacherous demons shall arise.
The Immortal Sovereigns hold the tally,
Dare any disobey the command?
Those who resist the tally and defy the decree
Shall be executed and destroyed.
Each be warned, each be vigilant,
Preserve this yellow peace.
The Nine Heavens proclaim the decree,
The myriad spirits heed with reverence."*

When a disciple travels at night and feels fear, their heart trembles and their will falters, or when plagued by nightmares, demonic forces test them, violating the true and disrupting qi to cause illness and harm, they shall swiftly perform the Jade Emperor’s Prayer for Ghostly Defense and Numinous Protection. The disciple shall focus their mind on the Supreme Dao, seeking aid from the Emperor. Facing north, they shall knock their teeth together thirty times, hold their breath, and secretly recite the prayer. Upon completion, knock the teeth again as before and swallow saliva ten times. Thus, treacherous evils shall be shattered, and demonic hordes subdued.

The Seven Spirits entwine in harmony,
The Great One surveys and governs,
Myriad numina guard the true,
Repelling malevolent qi from without.

This may also be chanted daily, resonantly recited,
Whether sitting or reclining at will,
To block the approach of all demonic trials,
Sealing the ominous traces of treacherous ghosts.
When retiring to rest, one may also recite it often,
To calm the spirit and clarify the mind,
Dispel nightmares and banish afflictions,
Dissolve all poisons and evils,
Ensuring lifelong freedom from fear.

On days of recitation, one need not face north or hold the breath.
The method of holding the breath and secret prayer
Is used when demonic forces have already tested one’s surroundings,
When pernicious essences have invaded the chamber of the spirit,
Thus commanding the numinous and summoning the true
To gather and suppress their ominous traces.
Yet the prayer for rest and repose
Differs from this method.

**Jade Clarity Demon-Dispelling Daoist Teeth-Knocking Ritual Protocol (22)**
All Highest Clarity methods of knocking teeth and swallowing saliva
Follow specific directions, with a proper sequence before and after,
Lest the true spirits become confused and disordered.
Knocking teeth summons the spirits,
Swallowing qi harmonizes the true.
Drawing in harmony and swallowing the Six Fluids
Directs and restrains the spirits,
Requiring the drum’s resonance to proceed in order.

In all practices of the above methods,
During rituals and prayers,
First tap the teeth,
Upper and lower knocking together,
Not side to side,
With each inhalation and exhalation,
To enable the swallowing of all qi and fluids.
This is called "summoning the spirits and harmonizing the true,"
A practice for those seeking ascension as immortals.

The method of knocking teeth:
Upper and lower knocking together is called the "Heavenly Drum,"
Left teeth knocking together is called the "Heavenly Bell,"
Right teeth knocking together is called the "Heavenly Chime."
To subdue ghosts and summon demons, knock the bell and chime;
To practice the Dao and seek the true, knock the Heavenly Drum.

**Supreme Simplicity Numinous Daoist Prayer for Ringing Ears (23)**
Upon hearing ringing in the ears,
Cross the hands to cover the ears and pray:
*"The Red Child dwells in the palace,
The Nine True Ones reside in the chamber.
All spirits, heed the command,
Examine and avert misfortune.
The Great One flows fire
To extinguish the ten thousand evils."*

Afterward, cover the ear gates twenty-one times.
When warmth is felt in the face, it is an auspicious sign.
If cold sensations arise in the head or neck,
It signals the entry of malevolent qi.
One should swiftly lie down, close the eyes,
And visualize the True Lord of the Great One in the Cinnabar Palace,
Wielding a flowing-fire bell to cast it forth,
Driving the malevolent qi out of the ears,
With firelight following behind,
Brightly illuminating the entire body.
After a long while, peace will be restored.

**Supreme Simplicity Numinous Method for Discerning Auspicious and Ominous Ear Ringing (24)**
If one suddenly hears the sound of rushing water,
Thunder, or drumming in the ears,
It signifies bodily exhaustion,
The heart’s storehouse severely damaged,
Unable to savor the true or sustain life,
Indulging in dissipation and disorder,
Causing the Six Palaces to lose control,
The hun and po to wail in sorrow—
A portent of impending illness and death.

Thus, the Muddy Pellet’s governance falters,
The Nine Palaces lose their regularity,
Sorrow and disturbance overturn order,
Drumming sounds chaotically,
As if abandoning their abode to forsake the body.
Upon hearing this, one should concentrate the mind
On the Great One True Lord,
To reverse delusion and restore the true heart.
If the transgression is not grave,
The condition may naturally improve.
Deafness occurs because the ear spirit has departed.

If one suddenly hears the sound of gold or jade tones,
It signifies the arrival of true qi,
And the Dao is nearing fruition.
If one hears the sound of stringed or wind instruments,
The Six Ding Jade Maidens have come to guard your Dao.
One should retreat into seclusion,
Devoting oneself to cultivation with greater diligence than before.
Thus, the Perfected One will gradually manifest in form.
Yet unless they are your master,
Do not speak of this to others.

Hearing the sound of flutes or horns
Is an auspicious omen heralding nobility.
Hearing cries, shouts, or wails
Is an ominous sign foretelling misfortune.
If one smells a foul odor,
There will surely be unclean matters.
Hastily change clothes, bathe, burn incense,
And sweep the bedchamber to respond,
For this is the Celestial Lord’s warning to the practitioner.

If one smells blood or qi,
Or unexpectedly sees a gathering of blood,
It portends military strife.
Swiftly retreat from the mortal realm,
Seek refuge with the Three Origin Lords,
Pray for deliverance and conceal yourself,
Observe a fast for three months,
And the calamity will cease.
These are all the Celestial Lord’s advance warnings of fortune and misfortune,
To inspire awe and caution regarding blessings and disasters.

Upon witnessing ominous signs,
One should practice hidden virtue,
Engage in acts of kindness and rescue,
Do what others cannot,
And undertake what others will not,
Only then may one escape the certainty of death.
Strive diligently, and do not remain complacent.

**Golden True Jade Radiance Pacifying Ritual Hall Five Directions Talisman Method (25)**

Once the talismans are fully inscribed, face north and strike the teeth thirty-six times, then softly intone the prayer:

*"By decree of the Nine Heavens,
A summons is proclaimed to the myriad spirits.
Three eras succeed one another,
Five qi intermingle and merge.
The Jade Emperor reveals His chariot,
Guiding the reins in the celestial court,
Disseminating the true Dharma,
Subduing demons and restraining spirits,
Severing and slaying primordial evil.
May the ten thousand Dao be leveled as one.
Disciples of the Dao and later learners,
Your names are recorded by the Imperial Lord.
Summon the true and penetrate the hidden,
Where qi converges without form.
Transform the luminous and refine the Dao,
Ascend to the Three Clarities,
Attain swift-flying chariots,
And ascend to the Jade Court."*

Upon completion, place the talismans according to their positions. True immortals will descend at once, and the practitioner will be free from misfortune and calamity. Those who do not study this Dao seldom escape bodily ruin. Truly, this is a wondrous method—without study, one attains immortality by nature.

**Golden True Jade Radiance Dao-Practicing Qi-Absorbing Visualization of the Three Perfected Ones Method (26)**

The Upper Prime Palace resides in the *niwan* (mud-pill palace) within the brain. Its spirit is the Red Child, named Three Primes First, also called Zhongxuan Shengdi Qing.

The Middle Prime Palace resides in the crimson chamber of the heart. Its spirit is the Perfected One, named Zinan Dan, also called Zhongguang Jian.

The Lower Prime Palace resides in the cinnabar field three inches below the navel. Its spirit is the Infant, named Yuanyang Chang, also called Guxia Xuan.

These are the Three Ones’ spirits. When seeking to restrain the hun and po souls, first silently invoke their names. Visualize the three spirits as jade-like with golden radiance, appearing in the form of infants. The Middle and Upper Primes both wear red, while the Lower Prime wears yellow. Their heads resemble those of newborn infants. During Dao-practicing and qi-absorbing, also visualize their names.

**Seven Sacred Mysteries: The Prohibitions Against the Seven Harms (27)**

For all scholars of the Mystic Register who possess the countenance of immortality, they should naturally unite with the true. Yet there are seven harms:

**The First Harm:** Donning the true while practicing falsehood, indulging in lust and dissipating spirit. The hun’s essence leaks, the radiance of essence withers, qi scatters, and the po disperses. Bones hollow, the form trembles, the spirit weeps in the exhausted palace. This is heard at the Celestial Gate, and true immortals journey far away. One thus binds karmic ties with the Nine Dusts, becoming akin to the Earthly Bureau. How can one still attain immortality?

**The Second Harm:** Outwardly appearing devoted to the Dao while inwardly harboring malice. Wickedness festers within, wishing others ill and failure. Envy of the capable and jealousy of the worthy. Sweet words with treacherous hearts, smiling faces with inner wrath. Judging others’ gains and losses, recklessly creating the roots of sin. Slandering fellow disciples, attacking the foundation of one’s teacher. Recorded by the Three Officials as an evil gate, immortals ascend on high while demonic forces assail the body. The form becomes a wandering shadow, the spirit scatters, and one suffers unjust calamities. At the extreme of evil’s origin, the body is reduced to ashes, and one is extinguished in the Nine Springs. Though bearing a mystic name, how can one preserve the natural?

**The Third Harm:** Drinking to profound intoxication, harming qi and losing spirit. The five palaces collapse, the myriad spirits are startled, the hun and po scatter, and the inner and outer decay. The original chamber stands empty, the Red Child wails in sorrow, true immortals ascend on high, and demonic forces enter the form. Such learning only wastes essence and sincerity. Though one bears the Mystic Register, the jade name is lost in vain. The spirit ascends to the upper palace, while the body turns to ashes in the dark underworld. Seeking to prolong life in confusion, how can one endure?

**The Fourth Harm:** Conduct that does not benefit others, demanding reverence from others. Heart filled with resentment, words of abuse without restraint. Anger and joy without moderation, temperament erratic and unsteady. Qi agitates and spirit scatters, the inner true flees, the po departs, and the hun wanders. The nine orifices gather dust, the five palaces flee in disarray. All stems from an impure nature and inauspicious conduct. True immortals ascend on high, while external afflictions enter the form. With such learning, what benefit can one hope for? Though bearing the Mystic Chart, one cannot escape this calamity. The hope for immortality grows distant, while the path to the underworld lengthens.

**The Fifth Harm:** Possessing the Mystic Chart’s outward signs, having received treasured scriptures, or encountering a spiritually attuned master who imparts sacred texts. Yet failing to adhere to the precepts and covenants, one leaks celestial truths. Before nine years have passed, one petitions famous mountains, causing the Azure Palace to record the name and the Golden Portal to compile the account. Then, one transmits these to others, dispersing them among the world. Treating the true lightly and leaking the treasured, one incurs karmic retribution upon oneself. Though bearing a mystic name, one instead burdens the Seven Mysteries. The immortal Dao ascends on high, while the body perishes in the dark springs, forever bearing ghostly debts, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas.

**The Sixth Harm:** The body treading in filth and impurity, the form and shadow lacking fragrance. Inwardly devoid of purity and emptiness, outwardly lacking orchid-like fragrance. The pure and numinous lose their immortality, the spirit does not dwell in its chamber. Qi is disturbed, essence is muddled, the numinous origin loses its radiance. The five spirits scatter, the Red Child flees, demonic forces attack, and the inner and outer perish together. With such learning, hoping to succeed only brings harm. True immortals ascend on high, while the solitary luminous scene wanders alone, sinking into turbidity. How can one attain immortality?

**The Seventh Harm:** Consuming the flesh of all living beings, slaughtering and harming the beauty of those with limbs and mouths. Foul qi fills the viscera, cutting short the lives of others for one’s own form. True qi is disturbed at the numinous gate, the wandering spirit startles the Red Child. The hun and po wander through the palace chambers, turbidity and stagnation cling to the mouth and teeth. Immortals ascend to the Jade Clarity on high, while one’s own body sinks into the underworld. Though bearing a mystic name in the Imperial Register, one cannot escape certain death.

The Most High Sage Lord said: The foundation of studying the Dao lies in urgently avoiding the Seven Harms. Once one has gazed upon the gates of the Mystic Caverns and perused the jade scriptures, without transgressing the prohibitions of the Seven Harms, one may sit and await the descent of the numinous, ascending to the dawn in broad daylight. If one outwardly strives in learning yet inwardly does not dispel the Seven Harms, one will seek immortality but instead meet defeat, hope for life but instead perish, aspire to fortune but instead encounter misfortune, and long to ascend but instead sink. The numinous immortals depart to the High Clarity, the five spirits scatter to the eight wastes, the Red Child wails in the central chamber, and the wandering hun cries out in the Mystic Void. Thus, the countenance of immortality has its successes and failures, and advanced learning has its Seven Harms. For those who earnestly uphold the Dao, who can purify their truth?

**Purple Text of the Numinous Book: The Ten Failures of the Immortal Countenance (28)**

**The First Failure:** Do not indulge in lust. Lust causes the hun’s essence to leak externally, the radiance of essence to wither, the spirit to scorch, and the po to scatter. Bones thin, marrow becomes foul, the hun wails in the numinous palace. This is heard at the Celestial Pavilion, the Three Palaces contend for authority, and the Embryonic Flower laments in error.

**The Second Failure:** Do not engage in treacherous malice or cruelty. Cruelty causes the Yellow Court to descend into chaos, the Three Corpses to delight in slaughter, the hun-spirit to spy on deceit, and the po-ghost to invade the chamber. The eyes’ light perishes, and the mouth emits harmful qi. **This is the second failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Third Failure:** Do not become drunk on wine. Drunkenness causes the bodily form to decay, the numinous true ones to intermingle in disorder, the hun to forget its original chamber, and the po to wander into depraved dwellings. The Red Child takes flight and cries out, while the throat and brain are scorched by fire. **This is the third failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Fourth Failure:** Do not indulge in filth or disdain purity. Filth and disdain cause the pure and numinous to lose their truth, essence and hun to abandon their abode, the Three Palaces to breed worms, the Red Child to drift aimlessly, blood to turn foul, and marrow to reek. The spirit’s light loses its dwelling, the po flees through the demonic gate, and one seeks the scriptures of death. **This is the fourth failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Fifth Failure:** Do not consume the flesh of any living being. Doing so severs the primordial form at its origin, destroys the root and foundation, and causes the Embryonic Spirit to wail in lament, the Crimson Lord to cry out in longing. The Three Hun grow bitter with poison, the po wanders among graves and mounds. Once this flesh enters the mouth, life plunges into eternal night. **This is the fifth failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Sixth Failure:** Do not consume the flesh of any living being from the waters. Doing so violates the true form and spirit, the Mud Pill Palace collapses, the Three Palaces seal their gates, and the Infant becomes entangled in disorder. The luminous hun flees in flight, and the po seeks a coffin and outer casket. **This is the sixth failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Seventh Failure:** Do not consume the flesh of flying birds. Doing so causes the qi, form, voice, and odor to stagnate, the essence-spirit to grow turbid, the brain to yellow, the teeth to wither, and the spleen to nurture dead qi. The hun refuses to receive the true, the po generates demonic vigor, the body sinks into the abyss, and the bones and marrow perish. **This is the seventh failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Eighth Failure:** Do not consume the five pungent vegetables. Doing so causes the Five Viscera to reek, the Three Flowers to dissolve in chaos, the spirit to fail in ascending, and the essence-embryo to sink downward. The hun and po grow estranged, the Red Child becomes weary and distressed, the Flying Spirit loses its guard, and the eyes’ light scatters in flight. **This is the eighth failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Ninth Failure:** Do not kill creatures from insects upward. Doing so arms the myriad beings against you, binding your bones in blood resentment. The form grows violent, the po ferocious, and the hun-qi engages in battle. The Embryonic Spirit panics in terror, the Infant flees in all directions, the Mud Pill Palace turns treacherous and wild, the Red Child rebels and abandons you, and the corpse-form is boiled in cauldrons, cooked in water, and burned by fire. **This is the ninth failure of the immortal countenance.**

**The Tenth Failure:** Do not face north to relieve yourself or bend over, nor gaze upward at the Three Luminaries. Do not face north when cutting your hair, removing your clothes, spitting, or cursing, lest you offend and destroy the King. "Destroy" refers to the earthly branch beneath the year, and "King" refers to the location of the royal qi. Do not curse the sun, moon, or stars. Do not impose punishments or execute authority on the eight solar terms. Do not harbor anger or resentment on the first day of the lunar month. Do not harm creatures with shells—tortoises, dragons, or scaled beings—on days of the *liu jia*. Do not harm pheasants on *bingwu* days, black beasts on *bingzi* days, or entertain other thoughts on *gengshen* days; instead, focus on contemplating the true. Do not consume wine or meat on *yimao* days; maintain purity and a tranquil mind. Do not kill living beings in the first month. Do not consume meat on the ninth day of the second month. Do not eat the hearts of any herbs on the third day of the third month. Do not cut grass or fell trees on the eighth day of the fourth month. Do not draw blood on the fifth day of the fifth month. Do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month. Do not contemplate evil deeds on the seventh day of the seventh month. Do not purchase shoes, sandals, or any footwear on the fourth day of the eighth month. Do not move bedding or mats on the ninth day of the ninth month. Do not punish or reprimand people or things on the fifth day of the tenth month. Do not fail to bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Do not neglect to fast, burn incense, or recite the true scriptures during the last three days of the twelfth month. **Such taboos are the great prohibitions of heaven and humanity. The Three Officials record and examine them, deeming them grave offenses.** They may cause the Three Hun to turn against one another, the Seven Po to scatter in contention, or the Embryonic Spirit to grow resentful, bringing the Three Palaces under a time of evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, demonic forces seize the vermilion tower, essence and fluids transgress, and the numinous true ones grow distracted. The transformations and prohibitions are manifold, and the taboos and techniques are unrecognized. If you can uphold and cultivate these precepts, you will become a candidate for immortality. If you violate the heavenly prohibitions, you will suffer harm and failure.

**The Twenty-Ninth Method: The Yellow Plain and High Clarity Robes of the High Clarity Scripture**

The High Clarity ritual robe is made of purple and blue silk, with purple on the outside and blue on the inside. The robe’s width is four feet and nine inches, corresponding to the number of the four seasons. Its length is five feet and five inches, aligning with the qi of heaven and earth. The outer and inner layers follow a single pattern: the outer layer has twenty-four strips, and the inner layer has fifteen strips, corresponding to the thirty-nine positions of the Perfected Emperors. Thus, wearing this robe signifies donning the attire of the Thearch and Sovereign. Without this robe, one must not recklessly handle the precious scriptures. This ritual robe is bestowed upon twelve Jade Lads. It must not be lent to others, nor may it be defiled by impurity or treated with disrespect.

For women, the purple gauze robe uses two zhang and four chi of fabric. The sleeves should be made long enough to suit the body. The robe should have sixteen strips on the sleeves and twenty-three strips on the body, totaling thirty-nine strips. Additionally, a blue gauze skirt is made using forty-five chi of fabric, divided into eight panels. Each panel is four feet and nine inches long, with the remaining fabric used for the waistband. The eight panels are further divided into thirty-two strips, forming the Flying Blue Skirt. Without this ritual robe, one must not recite the High Clarity precious scriptures. This robe is bestowed upon twelve Jade Maidens. It must not be lent to others, nor may it be defiled by impurity or treated with disrespect.

**The Thirtieth Method: The Jade Clarity Demon-Quelling Ritual for Daoist Travel Through Mountains and Marshes**

When Daoists travel through the Five Marchmounts, traverse rivers, or cross marshes, they must perform the incantations of the Three Heavens and the Orthodox Unity, employing the methods of summoning spirits and attracting immortals through awe-inspiring trials. At the outset of ascending a mountain, one should first knock the teeth together nine times outside the mountain, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored clouds billowing and converging from all directions, enveloping the entire mountain and oneself within the cloudy mist. After a long while, one will see the immortal officials of the Five Marchmounts, the mountain’s form, the forests, the myriad creatures—plants, trees, birds, and beasts—all coming to pay homage. Then, facing upward, recite the incantation:

**The August Thearch’s Procession**

When the August Thearch sets forth on his journey, the day is auspicious, the hour propitious. Jade radiance spreads its canopy; the Great One lends his support. On the left, the White Prime attends; on the right, the Peerless Flourishing assists. The Eight Thearchs and Nine Perfected, ascending Brahmā’s realm, treading in prosperity, guide me and escort me, sharing their brilliance with me. As I traverse the Five Marchmounts, the host of immortals comes forth to welcome me. Entering and exiting rivers and seas, ten thousand paths open wide. I command the Six Dings and tread the Five Phases. The Three Heavens issue their decree, sweeping away the myriad evils. With a mighty sweep, defilement is purged; flowing metal annihilates calamity. The Orthodox Dharma flows pure and clear, stern as the frost’s authority. Resplendent essence shines forth; the dragon chariot rears high. Verdant plumes and azure feathers flutter; flying brocade and silk robes trail. Wherever I go, wherever I turn, all is felicitous and prosperous. The myriad Perfected come to pay homage, ascending together to the Jade Capital.

When finished, draw in qi thirty-six times and cease.

Practicing this for a thousand days, one will have the True Immortals of the Five Marchmounts descend in cloud chariots with feathered canopies, soaring through the Great Void.

**Auspicious Days and Taboos for Daoists Entering Mountains**

When a Daoist wishes to enter a mountain, the seventh day of the third month is auspicious.

Another method: In spring, do not enter eastern or western mountains; in summer, do not enter southern or northern mountains; in autumn, do not enter western or eastern mountains; in winter, do not enter northern or southern mountains.

For entering mountains, *Bao*, *Yi*, and *Zhuan* days are auspicious; *Zhi* and *Fa* days are inauspicious.

*Yi* days (auspicious): Jiazi, Bingyin, Dingmao, Jisi, Xinwei, Renshen, Guiyou, Yihai, Gengchen, Xinchou, Gengxu, Wuwu.

*Bao* days (auspicious): Dingchou, Bingxu, Jiawu, Gengzi, Renyin, Guimao, Yisi, Dingwei, Wushen, Jiyou, Xinhai, Bingchen.

*Zhuan* days (auspicious): Wuchen, Jichou, Wuxu, Bingwu, Renzi, Jiayin, Yimao, Dingsi, Jiwei, Gengshen, Xinyou, Guihai.

*Zhi* days (inauspicious): Yichou, Jiaxu, Renwu, Wuzhi, Guisi, Jiachen, Gengyin, Xinmao, Yiwei, Bingshen, Dingyou, Jihai.

*Fa* days (inauspicious): Gengwu, Bingzi, Wuyin, Jimao, Xinsi, Guiwei, Jiashen, Yiyou, Dinghai, Renchen, Guichou, Renxu.

If a Daoist suddenly encounters inauspicious or malevolent omens, strike the Heavenly Bell thirty-six times and knock the left teeth.

When passing through mountains and reciting the mighty incantation to ward off evil spirits, strike the Heavenly Chime thirty-six times and knock the right teeth.

When meditating on the Dao to summon the True and attract the numinous, sound the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times and knock the upper and lower teeth together.

**Incantation to Subdue Mountain Spirits and Malevolent Ghosts**

If a Daoist, lodging alone in mountain forests, is often harassed or tested by mountain spirits and malevolent ghosts, knock the teeth fourteen times, hold the breath, and recite:

*"Yesterday, I was summoned by the Thearch to assume command of the True Prime, ordering me to seal and govern the Northern Marchmount and demolish Mount Feng. The myriad spirits receive their duties and assemble before the Thearch. The Seven Spirits initiate their departure; the Three Origins govern the True. If any minor demons dare act, they shall be instantly annihilated. Mountain spirits and marsh wardens, hasten to receive my command. The divine master’s oral decree is heard above by the Three Clarities. All proceeds according to the Great Cavern’s method; no delay is permitted."*

After reciting, knock the teeth fourteen times again.

This is the incantation of the Thearch-Lord to supplement the spirits and subdue mountain spirits and the hundred ghosts. When the mountain gods, earth deities, and the spirits presiding over shrines and temples hear this incantation, they all wield whips to welcome, and divine soldiers stand guard. It is as if ten thousand people were lodging together.

**Incantation to Dispel Demons**

Those who have received the Three Superior Daoist Teachings but have not yet ascended to the Three Clarities to receive their immortal titles and ranks are often tested by heavenly demons and harassed by the myriad spirits. They should chant the incantation to dispel demons, which stirs the numinous sounds of the Upper Heavens above and summons the mighty spirits of the Three Realms below. It binds the myriad spirits to the Heavenly Bell and beheads demonic forces with the Cavern Scripture.

To perform this method, always face north. First visualize a round image like the sun rising from the nape of the neck, with a vermilion phoenix on the left and a dark dragon on the right. Purple radiance spreads its canopy, illuminating the body’s form. Immortal youths and jade maidens hold five-colored standards, accompanied by the myriad spirits of the Three Realms. Before them, nine phoenixes cry; behind them, eight simurghs sing. White dragons clear the path; the Great Ultimate attends the chariot.

First knock the left teeth thirty-six times, then the right teeth twenty-four times, then the upper and lower teeth together twelve times, and recite:

*"O ravenous beasts of the Nether Heavens, guarding the four great gates! Swallowing and drowning, severing oaths, the mountain’s ugliness gathers in myriad hordes. They bare their throats to the heavens; fierce horses gallop high. Poisonous dragons brandish their claws; golden heads devour horizontally. Mighty soldiers number in the tens of thousands, receiving talismans to examine immortals. The Six Heavens are unrestrained, joining evil to form hordes. Demons drum and surge; defiled qi swirls in profusion. Empty cavern songs and chaotic sounds obstruct the clouds. Petty ghosts trade punishments, targeting the gate of human life. The divine kings proclaim: there is no seclusion they do not hear. Above, they seize the Six Qi; below, they inspect the river sources. The Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses swiftly distinguish good from evil. By the tens of thousands, by the thousands, they come before me. The Five Thearchs examine and record: those with merit are pardoned. A thousand demons and true spirits, their forms bound by the Thearch-Lord—dare they not obey the command? Those executed shall know no reprieve. Their livers shall be carved, their bellies ripped open, their heads severed, their roots extinguished. In the northern cauldron, they shall be steeped in boiling water; in the southern mound, they shall be burned by fire. The Golden Perfected records their qi; the Flowing Bell captures their souls. No trace of demonic corruption shall remain; their forms and origins shall be utterly exhausted. Bearing the Heavenly Scriptures on their bodies, their Dao and conduct follow the Orthodox Text. They cleanse and purify the Nine Qi, clarifying the Three Origins. The Mysterious Void uplifts the True, uniting above with the Natural. Let none dare harass or test me; any disturbance shall be reported above."*

When finished, draw in qi twelve times and cease.

This is the **Incantation of Wisdom to Dispel Demons**.

Whenever a scholar of the Dao travels through famous mountains, lodging alone amidst a hundred ghosts, trembling with fear, or when illness clings like an infant, and a host of ghosts guards the door—reciting this incantation once is like ice melting in a boiling cauldron or metal dissolving in scorching flames. The hun-soul and spirit become serene and upright; qi is calmed, the body strengthened. Even if one’s fate were not destined to end thus, in the end, death itself would be unattainable.

**The Essential Scripture on Cultivating the Body from the Supreme Clarity Tradition, Concluded**
