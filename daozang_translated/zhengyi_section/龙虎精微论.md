**The Subtle Essence of Dragon and Tiger**

Before the Great Ultimate was undifferentiated,
Its form was nameless, its essence unmanifest.
When the Great Ultimate began,
The Primordial Chaos arose.

Within it lay the True One’s essence,
The genuine origin of Heaven and Earth.
The Four Symbols emerged from it,
And all things took form through it.

In the fierce heart of fire, the Dragon soars—
Graceful, spirited, in flight;
In the depths of clear water, the Tiger leaps—
Swift, intent, in motion.

Yin and Yang cannot fathom its nature,
Ghosts and Spirits cannot trace its path.

The Sage acted, opening the source of Transformation.
The scholar, with focused mind,
Unlocks the profound intent—
Thus, the Dao of Golden Elixir may be spoken of.

Now, to gaze into the profound and hidden:
Its secret lies in lead and fire.
The Palace of Separation emits qi,
Facing Jia-Yi to bloom with splendor;
The Abyss ascends with essence,
Entering Geng-Xin to refine the pure.

The Golden Womb, divine chamber,
Establishes the Dan Platform.
The Holy Mother’s Pool,
Opens the lineage of the Alchemical Ancestor.

Thus, the Yang Furnace and Yin Cauldron
Follow the Primordial Patterns of Heaven and Earth;
Fierce Fire and Gentle Symbols
Concentrate the Great Authority of Cold and Warm.

Circulating through the Eight Extremes,
Moving above and below,
Water and Fire revolve—
Motion and stillness are ever-changing.
Hence, the Dragon and Tiger unite,
Facing the Primordial Void and taking form;
The Husband and Wife merge,
From indistinctness to solid shape.

Thus, the Abyss forms the Yang Male in a Yin position—
Yin within Yin adheres,
So the Golden Tiger appears in the Water’s domain,
Becoming the Moon’s Shadow.

The Separation is the Yin Female in the Yang realm—
Yang within Yin generates,
Thus the Mercury Dragon emerges from the Fire’s depths,
Becoming the Sun’s Spirit.

As for the divine chamber’s boundaries,
Its form resembles a phoenix.
Two strings unite as one body, fused.

From the *Pì-Tài* (Negation-Transformation) cycle,
Receiving this responsive qi,
Nurturing the *Yīn-Yù* (the hidden, the subtle),
Establishing the roots—
Until solidified, a divine being is formed.

Should one overdraw or underdraw,
Advance or retreat untimely,
The Symbols of Fire misaligned,
Cold and Warm out of harmony,
Then Yin and Yang diverge,
The Four Directions suffer drought or flood;
Heaven and Earth fracture,
All things face ruin.

Harmonious qi descends not,
True essence remains unpreserved.
The failure lies in the Fire’s movement,
Not in the medicine’s nature.

One must distinguish lead from mercury,
Recognize water as gold,
Personally receive the secret teachings,
And be directly transmitted the Great Decision.

Extract the Yellow Sprout from within lead,
Transforming into the Golden Field;
Scatter the White Snow in the sand’s domain,
Constructing the divine chamber.

At its center, the Cauldron—
Modeling the *Qián-Kūn* (Heaven-Earth).
On all sides, the Symbols circulate,
Following the Sun and Moon’s revolutions.

Yang ascends, Yin retreats;
Yin advances, Yang falters.
When the Moon’s Light is full, gold and water take form;
When the Rabbit’s Shadow fades, Dragon and Tiger lie dormant.
When the years are complete, the work attains divinity.
Bathing in the cold night’s clarity,
Half the pill enters the mouth,
Steaming within the Five Viscera;
One dose consumed,
The Golden Body ascends in radiance.

This is the attainment of the adept.

The beginning and end of lead and fire—
though one may obtain the lead,
the fire remains difficult to master.
To ponder deeply the ultimate truth,
to fathom the arcane mechanisms,
is already hard enough—
how much more so without a teacher,
to ever attain self-enlightenment by oneself?

Ah, subtle! Ah, wondrous!
Ah, divine! Ah, sacred!
If one truly grasps the essence,
then no words are needed—yet belief comes naturally.
Or, if one remains lost in its path,
then even sincere warnings will be met with doubt.

Thus, some bare their hearts recklessly,
forcing interpretations through contrivance,
clinging to vague scriptural hints,
adorned with empty rhetoric.
Though they may name their methods similarly,
the true Dao remains distant and unattained.

In secret, they invoke the Two Qi,
misnaming them "spiritual sand."
They take safflower yellow as yang-lead,
and quicksilver as yin-mercury.
They manipulate water and fire,
reconstructing cauldrons and furnaces,
only to produce the semblance of cinnabar,
fit for decorative illustration—
while boiling dew and snow-water,
collecting grass juices and wood ashes,
or refining with urine,
or burning with filth,
or deeming ancient well-water as divine elixir,
or calling morning dew "river vehicle."
They transmute salt into lead,
extract mercury from sand,
or alloy gold and silver,
or blend ores and mercury—
using five metals equally in the furnace,
boiling eight minerals together in the cauldron.

Thus, years pass in vain,
wealth is wasted in futility,
leaving only a white-haired emptiness,
a deadened spirit unfulfilled.
The Dao eludes them—
how can they escape their decline?

Those who truly know the sacred medicine
are the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth,
the essential path beyond the world.
They gather the qi of yin and yang, the Five Phases,
extract the essence of sun and moon, the Four Symbols,
shifting from formlessness to form,
from substance to non-substance,
crossing death and life eternally,
endless in transformation.

Ascending to the Milky Way’s heights,
aligning with the vault of Heaven—
how could they compare with the mundane and perishable?
The foolish, longing for immortality,
delve deeply into ultimate truth.
Though they cannot glimpse its hallowed depths,
they dimly grasp its shores,
ever hoping to meet a lofty adept,
to reverently hear sacred teachings,
to verify the wondrous Dao,
and escape the dust of the world.

Often, they hold it silently in thought,
ever vigilant in mind,
concealing it in the Vermilion Palace,
lest subtle words be leaked.

Now, having pondered repeatedly,
expounding without restraint—
how dare they measure the Dao of Heaven?
They do not presume to reveal its mysteries.
Yet, as it lingers in their hearts,
there is reason for its utterance.

They wish to gather like-minded, virtuous scholars,
those of profound insight beyond俗,
to abandon worldly vanities together,
and await one another in secluded valleys.

And so, they append ten poems at the end—
the first of which follows:

**The Ten Poems on the Dao of Alchemy**

**II**
The mercury’s nature and lead’s essence known,
The fire-gold’s profound truth—how dimly shown!
If worldly men but grasp these common things,
In vain they toil till hoary heads they bring.

**III**
A tiger lurks where crystal waters gleam,
A dragon hides where fiery light doth stream.
Harmonize yin-yang, let no discord rise—
Then moon’s elixir blends with crow’s dark skies.

**IV**
The Dragon’s scales bristle, poised to ascend,
The Tiger’s might is seized—both forces blend.
When two breaths merge as one, the Dao’s revealed:
The golden cauldron’s secret far excelled.

**V**
A woman turned to man—this truth is plain,
South to North transformed—this path is sovereign.
When men ask of the boundless elixir’s grace,
They doubt it, though I point with steadfast face.

**VI**
Four thousand three hundred drops of pitch-black essence,
Divine decree shifts in but a moment’s presence.
Fire’s records hold the hidden, sealed intent—
Who knows the years, the months, the days, the hour’s intent?

**VII**
The Star Hall shines o’er the imperial city’s glow,
Ten thousand leagues of celestial river flow.
Emerald waves surge back to the boundless sea,
Black clouds dissolve—now pearls of mystery.

**VIII**
The phoenix’s essence, oft refined in vain,
Do not let the soul-bird lurk in hidden plain.
Many seek life’s boon through this false pursuit,
Lost travelers curse the void’s unyielding suit.

**IX**
The water of *gui* spans sky and sea’s embrace,
*Geng* and *xin* forge wood’s refined grace.
The two maidens of *kan* and *li* blend and meet,
In harmony born, as one kin complete.

**X**
With steadfast will, the sacred hall is raised,
Where jade-blue flowers bloom by heaven’s maze.
When next we meet in wedded, alchemical bliss,
Each day’s embrace grows deeper, kiss by kiss.

**The Daoist Fire Refining Method (Zhuang-Lao’s Fire Control)**

For mortals who would traverse the **Microcosmic Orbit’s fire control**, first sever cravings, abstain from rich foods. Let your diet be pure—this is essential.

Do not covet wealth or chase profit.

When beginning practice, first employ **Dao Yin** (guided movements). Perform them lightly, opening the channels and pathways. The more varied, the better.

Do not grow weary or exhausted, lest your vital essence be depleted—this is most unwise.

**The Dao Yin Framework** includes the following:

**Swinging the Limbs**
With hands, swing wide; with feet, stride boldly. Then lift one foot, suspending it midair, stepping forward as if echoing. Make a sound.

**Mountain-Tossing Hands**
Clasp hands behind, palms upward, release, and lift straight up, pressing down with both feet for a moment.

**Bow-Drawing Stance**
Draw back hands as if stringing a bow, then twist the torso as if shooting a bird. Repeat left and right.

Also, clasp hands behind the neck, swaying the upper body and head together.

**Knees and Legs**
Rub the knees vigorously at **Chize (赤泽)**, and perform **dry bathing (乾浴)**. Warm the hands and press them above and below the **Qihai (气海)** acupoint.

Clench fingers tightly, making a sharp sound, then **knock the teeth together** and gather the spirit.

**Strike the Heavenly Drum** thirty-six times, pressing the sides of the nose with both hands—this subdues the **Seven Spirits (七魄)**.

Call upon the **Three Souls (三魂)** by name—**Shuangling (爽灵), Taiguang (胎光), Youjing (幽精)**—repeating three or once. First, close and steady the breath, then exhale forcefully to purge stale, corrupt energies.

Stretch limbs fully, letting *qi* flow to the fingertips.

Visualize the **Five Celestial Animals**—**Qinglong (青龙), Baihu (白虎), Zhuqiao (朱雀), Xuanwu (玄武)**—surrounding you in yellow *qi* at front, back, left, and right. These are the **true forms of the Five Zang (五脏)**.

Then, calm the breath and still the mind before performing the **Yarrow Stalk Method (打爻)**.

**For the Yang Stalk:**
With each stalk, breathe evenly in and out. When exhaling, retain half the breath, then close the passage and, with intent, draw your own **original *qi*** (元气).

The **original** is the **source**—when raised to the **circular layers above**, drum it down at the **throat center (咽)**. When swallowing, take the left side first, then turn the face right and swallow again, completing **thirty-six swallows**.

If you begin with three or two swallows, rest for thirty-six, then visualize swallowing down to the **field of elixir (田层环)**, passing through the **stomach’s divine mouth (胃神口)**, entering the **Dan Tian (丹田)**, and exhaling to adjust the breath before performing another stalk.

Each time you swallow, let the *qi* rise with a **gurgling, bubbling sound**.

After completing all six stalks—**totaling 216 swallows**—gather the *qi* fully in the Dan Tian. Then, shake the body left and right **five to seven times**, and rub the Qihai to assist.

**Timing:**
During **yang hours (sunlit)**, perform the **Yang Stalk**; during **yin hours (moonlit)**, perform the **Yin Stalk**. Close your eyes, banish all distractions—no thought shall linger.

**The Hours of Zi and Wu** belong to **bathing**—do not practice then.

If one mistakenly treats **all afternoon as yin** and **all night as yang**, they contradict the true **yin-yang and Five Phases**! Follow this instead:
- **Afternoon (Wu to Shi)** performs the **Yin Stalk (坤卦)**.
- **Midnight (Zi to Chen)** performs the **Yang Stalk**.

Each hour corresponds to one stalk. Excluding the initial **144 counts**, the rest follow the same sequence.

**Burning the Scriptures:**
Once per season, burn this text in a fire ritual. The method of burning follows the same procedure as your lord’s—briefly stated, not elaborated here.

**What is Practiced Without Fire:**
This is the **fire control’s stagnation of impurities**.

**Results:**
One year—**minor attainment**,
Two years—**full attainment**,
Three years—**transformation of essence**,
Six years—**six yin retreat, six yang complete**, and your name is recorded among the immortals.
Nine years—**ascension**.

Initially, take **elixirs** to aid the process, **yin virtue** to support it, and **quietude** to nourish it. Seek one or two like-minded companions to assist.

The **Dao** is not confined to mountains and forests alone—it may also be cultivated in cities.

One must not lend out one’s own footwear, garments, or headgear to others, lest it diminish one’s **virtue/power**.

If near water or woodlands, dwell there as the center.
If in walled cities or rugged markets, then take the heights as your place.

The **Way** of **Zhuangzi** and **Laozi** is the most precious treasure—guard it naturally, and success will follow of its own accord.

The **source of Dao and virtue**—engrave it, wear it as an amulet, and ponder it deeply.
