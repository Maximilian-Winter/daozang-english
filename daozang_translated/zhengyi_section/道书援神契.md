**Preface to *Daoist Scripture in Concord with the Divine***

Those who discuss the teachings of Laozi in the world all call them heterodox, claiming their origins lie in Confucianism, though their later currents diverged. Yet Confucianism cannot be termed a "teaching"—it is the constant Way of all under Heaven. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius arose in succession—what "teaching" is there to speak of? When the Way of Zhou declined, rites and music fell into disuse, and customs grew deceitful. The Way of Confucius was seen as at odds with the times, and thus it was labeled a "teaching," its roots traceable to this.

Laozi lived contemporaneously with Confucius and was most renowned for his mastery of ritual. Confucius often consulted him on matters of propriety. Laozi, recognizing that the Dao could not be practiced in an age of chaos, purified himself and departed the state, dedicating himself to clarity and emptiness. Confucius, grieving that the Dao went unfulfilled and that the cultural legacy would be lost, traveled among the various states. Though their paths of advancement and retreat differed, their attire and observance of ritual and law never varied.

In later generations, the followers of Confucius altered their garments with the customs of each state, while the followers of Laozi did not shift with the times. Thus, the robes of today’s Daoist priests resemble those of the ancient Confucians. As for cultivating life and nature, they are rooted in the *Book of Changes*; in offering sacrifices and invoking spirits, they are rooted in the *Rites of Zhou*, particularly the *Spring Offices* and the *Minister of Rites*. Their talismans, seals, caps, and sashes likewise never stray from ancient institutions.

Yet due to the corruptions of later currents, they have been ranked alongside shamans and spirit-mediums. This book is thus composed to exalt them, tracing their origins and currents in thirty-four entries. It is titled *Daoist Scripture in Concord with the Divine*.

Composed in the ninth year of the *Dade* era.

Palaces and Abodes
In antiquity, the residences of kings and lords were all called *gong* (palaces), while the tall towers flanking city gates were called *guan* (observatories). The halls featured eastern and western staircases, connected by a gate in alignment. Ancestral temples followed the same design. Today, the Hall of the Most High and the Hall of Great Accomplishment share this form—an ancient institution. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Harmonious within the palace."* The *Commentary* states: *"Then they ascended the observation terrace."*

Altars for Offerings
In ancient times, all sacrifices required an altar. Later, prefectures and commanderies established altars for the gods of soil and grain. The *Records* say: *"An altar without a roof."* Ancient offering altars stood in the open, but today they are placed beneath roofs for simplicity.

Bells and Chime-Stones
In antiquity, ritual music employed sets of sixteen *bianzhong* (bronze bells) and *bianqing* (chime-stones), corresponding to the twelve pitch-standards and the four clear notes of the *gong* mode. There were also *texuan* bells and *texuan* chime-stones—*texuan* meaning "suspended alone." Today’s bronze bells and jade chime-stones of the cavernous registers, along with large bells, all derive from these. The great bronze chime-stones originate from the practice of striking jars. As the *Rites of Zhou* states: *"The Fu official casts bells; the Qing official fashions chime-stones."*

Incense and Lamps
In ancient times, sacrifices involved burning offerings. During Emperor Wu of Han’s worship of the Great Unity, incense and lamps were first used. The *Book of Rites* says: *"After the libation, then ignite the fragrant reeds."*

Divine Spirits
In antiquity, the House of Chongli could summon celestial and terrestrial spirits. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: *"Thereupon Chongli was commanded to sever the connection between earth and heaven."* The *Rites of Zhou: Offices of Spring* records that at the winter solstice, music was performed at the Circular Mound, and after six changes of the music, all celestial spirits descended. At the summer solstice, music was performed at the Square Marsh, and after six changes, all terrestrial spirits emerged.

Cakes, Fruits, and Wine Offerings
In ancient times, sacrifices used millet, glutinous millet, and animal victims. Emperor Wu of Liang substituted animal victims with flour effigies. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang further replaced these with cakes and pastries. The *Rites of Zhou* states that the *Bian* official was responsible for dates, chestnuts, water caltrops, and delicacies, as well as parched grain cakes and powdered offerings. The *Wine* official oversaw the five fermented liquors and three wines.

**Tents and Curtains**
In ancient times, palaces and chambers were all furnished with tents and curtains. The *Rites of Zhou* states that the *Muren* official was responsible for them.

**Ritual Attire**
In ancient times, ritual attire for sacrifices included the inner garment, knee cover, pendants, and lower robes—what is now called ritual attire is descended from these. Mencius said: "Without complete attire, one does not dare to perform sacrifices." The *Book of Rites* states: "The noble man of old always wore jade pendants."

**Caps and Robes**
In ancient times, scholar-officials all wore caps, tied with cords but without hairpins, except for ceremonial *bian* and *mian* caps, which used hairpins. Master Quan wore the *zhangfu* cap, saying: "I grew up in Song, so I wear the cap of Song." Zhuangzi said: "Yuan Xian wore a birch-bark cap and carried a birch staff"—this was the birch-bark cap. The *Book of Rites* mentions wide sleeves, referring to robes with large sleeves; Daoist robes belong to this category. When Li Bi of the Tang became a Daoist, he was granted purple robes, and later generations followed this as a custom. The straight collar embodies the spirit of ease and detachment.

**Jade Tablets and Simplified Wands**
In ancient times, dukes and marquises all carried jade tablets. The *Rites of Zhou* records the *huan* tablet, *xin* tablet, *shen* tablet, and *gong* tablet. The *Book of Rites* states that scholars held wands of fishbone-patterned bamboo or wooden slips.

**Spirit Tablets**
In ancient times, wooden tablets were used in ancestral temple sacrifices, and stone tablets in sacrifices to the altars of soil and grain, as recorded in the *Book of Rites*. Today’s spirit tablets are of the same kind.

**Tally Slips**
In ancient times, bamboo slips two *chi* long were used, bound together with leather cords. Some were made of wooden tablets, called *du*. Today’s tally slips follow this model. The *Preface to the Spring and Autumn Annals* says: "For minor matters, slips and tablets sufficed." When Confucius edited the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he "wrote when he should write, and excised when he should excise"—these were wooden tablets. In ancient times, summons and commands used tally tokens. Tallies were made of bamboo slips; today’s yellow-paper spirit-summoning talismans replace bamboo. The human-shaped talisman represents the messenger.

**Chanting the Void**
In ancient times, sacrificial music included hymns, or sometimes the *Mao Odes*. Today’s ritual chanting in Daoist ceremonies originates from this. The *Book of Documents* says: "Sound follows prolonged melody, and tones harmonize."

**Memorials and Petitions**
In ancient times, sacrifices used prayer tablets; later generations used paper. The *Book of Documents* states: "The scribe then inscribed the prayer." The *Rites of Zhou* records that the Grand Master of Ceremonies oversaw prayers, and the *fanghan* box replaced the wooden tablet case. When Yin Hao sent a letter, it was mistakenly delivered as an empty box—this was a wooden case.

**Kneeling and Bowing**
The *Rites of Zhou* records nine types of bows. Today’s prostration with forehead to the ground follows Zhou practice. The *Book of Documents* says: "Bow, prostrating the head." The *Book of Rites* states: "When receiving [gifts] while standing, one does not kneel."

**Ritual Staff**
In ancient times, peach branches were used to dispel misfortune. Hou Yi was killed with a peachwood club, so later generations used it to expel ghosts. Today’s *Tianpeng* staff belongs to this category. The *Rites of Zhou* says: "The shamans and invocators use peachwood and reeds."

**Ritual Sword**
In ancient times, scholar-officials all wore swords. The *Book of Han* records: "Swords and shoes were permitted in the palace." The *Rites of Zhou* mentions bows and arrows used to rescue the sun and moon—this is its origin. The *jieshui* ritual embodies the meaning of the Rain Master cleansing the dust.

**Directional Silks**
In ancient times, sacrifices to the Five Thearchs used colors corresponding to each direction. The five-directional silks follow this practice.

**Incantations**
Originally, the character for "prayer" (*zhu*) was written with the "speech" radical, but later people used the vulgar form with the "mouth" radical. When Tang of Shang prayed at the net, or Guo Luo prayed over the mantis eggs, this was the same idea.

**Talismanic Script**
The *Rites of Zhou* records that to exorcise inauspicious birds, one wrote the names of the ten days, twelve months, and twelve years on a talisman and hung it on a tree to drive them away. The ancients used seal script; today’s talismanic script resembles this.

**Lamp Arrangement**
When Cang Jie created writing, grain rained from the sky, and ghosts wailed at night. Thus, in Daoist rituals, the earth is marked as a prison, with rice as the boundary. Later generations used rice in all lamp arrangements, following this precedent.

**Spirit Embodiment**
Since ancient times, sacrifices required a *shi* (spirit impersonator), who was the grandson of the deceased, wearing the ancestor’s attire and sitting in the seat of the spirit tablet. This was also called *jia* (blessing). The *Book of Rites* says: "The invocator announces with filial piety; the *jia* responds with kindness." Today, when offering to the deceased and borrowing a medium, this practice is transmitted from that origin.

**Hand Warmer**
In ancient times, the *guanxian* ritual used the *guizan* (jade ladle). The ladle’s shape was a basin with a handle like a jade tablet, filled with wine; when holding the ladle, one did not hold the tablet. Today, when Daoists hold a hand warmer, they do not hold a tablet—this follows the same principle.

**Emperor’s Bell**
In ancient sacrifices, dancers held *nao* bells, of which the *dizhong* (Emperor’s Bell) was the smallest.

**Qi Formulae**
Daoist texts write *qi* with the "fire" radical.

The Dao of Drawing Qi: The Principle of Inhaling and Exhaling Yin and Yang
The *Yi Lüe Li* states: "When the note *gong* is struck, *shang* responds; when the low is cultivated, the high descends—this is the principle of stirring the spirit to its fullest." The Qi maiden’s wail summoned wind; Zou Yan’s lament brought frost; and harmonious *qi* arrived when the pitch-pipes were blown—all belong to this category.

**Command Tablet**
The *Rites of Zhou* records: "The *ya zhang* (tusked jade tablet) was used to muster troops." The Han bronze tiger tally, round above and square below, bore five tusk-like characters resembling drooping dewdrops, while its reverse depicted a crouching tiger with the inscription: "Made in the manner of the ancient *ya zhang* as a tiger tally." Today, the command tablet used to summon generals follows this method.

**Banners and Canopies**
The *Rites of Zhou* includes standards such as *jing*, *mao*, *pei*, and *di*—these are their forms.

**Yun Ao**
In ancient times, sacrifices were accompanied by music, which this practice emulates. The banners are typically taller than usual, and the music employs only pure tones to reach Heaven and Earth. Those who carry them in hand symbolize celestial music, allowing it to be performed while moving.

**Praying for the Sick**
A saying goes: "When Confucius fell ill, Zilu requested to pray." The *Book of Documents* records: "When King Wu was ill, the Duke of Zhou erected three altars to pray for him."

**Praying for Clear Skies or Rain, and Dispelling Disasters**
Anciently, there was the *chongyu* sacrifice for drought and the sacrifice for floods. King Tang offered himself in place of a sacrificial victim to pray in the mulberry grove. Dong Zhongshu’s *Chunqiu Fanlu* describes methods for summoning or halting rain: crafting five-colored dragons according to the day and celestial stem, each with its own prescribed form—these are not repeated here. To dispel fire, in the eighteenth year of Duke Zhao of Lu, Song, Wei, Chen, and Zheng all suffered fires on the same day. Zichan, acting on behalf of fire, thus made great sacrifices to the earth spirits, performing exorcisms in the four directions to quell the conflagration.

**Fasting from Grain**
The *Confucian Family Sayings* states: "Those who consume *qi* attain spirit clarity and longevity; those who eat grain gain wisdom and skill; those who consume nothing do not die."

**Daoists**
Confucius said: "A scholar devoted to the Dao—one who eats merely to sustain himself is unworthy of discussion. Likewise, one who feels shame at coarse clothing and poor food is unworthy of discussion." The Daoist texts cite the *Aid to the Divine Contract* in full.
