### **Ritual for Initiating Thought, Subtle Contemplation, and Resolute Will**

**First:** Upon initially entering the altar, the master circumambulates the scriptures to the left of the hall. Facing north, he offers incense thrice.

**Second:** The master remains facing north, bowing to the scriptures three times. The disciple faces south toward the master and bows three times.

**Third:** The master turns to the west, standing facing east, and concludes the meditation on the deities.

The ritual drum is struck twenty-four times.

*"Unsurpassed Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six of each—forth to report to the local earth deities and territorial true officials. This servant now burns incense and performs the transmission ritual, praying that the Supreme Ten Directions’ True Qi of Life may enter my body, that my petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme Jade Thearch of the Boundless Dao."*

Next, kneeling, the master summons the officials, saying:

*"Reverently, I dispatch from within this servant’s body the Five Body True Officials and Merit Officials; from the Upper Three Heavens, the Enforcing Transformation Yin-Yang Merit Officials of the Dao’s Transmission, the Dispelling Disaster and Dissolving Calamity Officers—twelve of each. From within this servant’s body, the Governing Duty Officers, the Great Generals of Establishing Authority and Supervising Merit, the Vanguard of Merit Verification, the Rear Guard of Merit Execution, the Courier Court Commandant, the Courier Court Aide, and the Four Divisions’ Merit-Overseeing Heralds. From within this servant’s body, the Transcendent Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officials, the Healing Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Decree Officers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Gale-Wind Posting Officers, the Courier Horse Memorial Officers, the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers—two of each—forth!"*

Those dispatched don their solemn regalia, crowns and sashes, and compose their dignified bearing. The Direct Envoys and Merit Officials wear the Heaven-Penetrating Crowns and black silk unlined robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officials wear the Vermilion Yang Headbands and crimson unlined robes. The Envoys wear the Nine Virtues’ Crowns, five-colored longevity unlined robes, tiger talisman belts, and hold jade tablets.

The Direct Envoys and Merit Officials stand at the four directions; all other officials stand at the center. The Healing Merit Officials guard this servant’s body. The Left Attendant Envoys hold authority staffs at the front; the Right Attendant Envoys bear banners at the rear. The Yang Decree Officers stand to the left; the Yin Decree Officers to the right. The Upper Division Merit Officials stand above; the Middle Division Merit Officials stand within this servant’s body. The Qi-Urging Merit Officials hasten the ten directions; the Upper Division Envoys gaze afar to the heavens; the Middle Division Envoys survey the eight directions. The Capital Envoys encircle this servant’s body.

The Wolf Officers, Tiger Warriors, Inspecting Hook Cavalry, Capital Officials’ Aides, Heavenly Couriers, Armored Soldiers, Heavenly Might Warriors, Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers, Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers, Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers, Evil-Gathering and Evil-Consuming Officers, Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers, Poison-Gathering and Poison-Consuming Officers, Talisman-Executing and Shrine-Destroying Officers, Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, Gale-Wind Posting Officers, Courier Horse Memorial Officers, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers assemble before, behind, left, and right of this servant.

When the Merit Officials and Envoys have completed their solemn preparations, they array the ceremonial regalia and report to the Numinous Treasure Officials, the Transcendent Overseers of the Retreat, the Celestial Masters’ twenty-four established dioceses, the thirty-six sacred abodes, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty named mountains including Kunlun, the upper palaces of the thirty-six thousand deities, the sun, moon, and stars, the Jade Armillary Sphere, the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth, the officials and generals of the Three Realms, the Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, the directional winds, the qi-infusing cyclical officers, the Examiners and Summoners, the Nine Yi and Hu Elders of the East, the Eight Man and Yue Elders of the South, the Six Rong and Di Elders of the West, the Five Di and Qiang Elders of the North, the Three Qin and Cang Elders of the Center, the Lords of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, and Marshes, the deities of all temples, the local mountain and river spirits, the valley and forest elders, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the original land deities, the altars’ generals and officers—all at once don their solemn attire. Together with the Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers within this servant’s body, they ascend to report to the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable, the Unsurpassed Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao and Virtue’s Multitudes of Sagely Heavenly Worthies, the Perfected Thearchs, Heavenly Thearchs, Celestial Masters, Numinous Treasure Retreat-Overseeing Great Dharma Masters, and all officials and lords."*

*"On the day this servant received the Dharma, it was vowed to proclaim the Dharma’s resonance, extol the great transformation, transmit it to later learners, and deliver heaven and humanity. Now, there is a man or woman of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, named so-and-so, who has purified themselves and cultivated conduct, aspiring to transcendence. Having already received the Three Caverns’ great deliverance Dharma, yet the profound mysteries remain ungrasped, the true path not yet fully realized. Today, bearing sincerity and offering devotion, they seek to receive the Heavenly Worthy’s expounded *Two Halves Diagram of Thought, Subtle Contemplation, and Resolute Will*, the Ten Precepts’ essential instructions. Their cinnabar sincerity is earnest, and this cannot be refused. This servant, in accordance with the Dharma, has fasted with them. The day’s rites concluded, I now transmit and deliver them. Reverently, I present a yellow silk memorial with red borders. The Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers shall swiftly ascend to the Supreme Celestial Courts, placing the memorial upon the Jade Tablet, clearly requesting review."*

Next, the memorial is read aloud.

Then, the drum is struck thrice, and it is said:

*"This servant, again relying on the Upper Officials of the Multitudes of Perfected Ones, the Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, has separately reported and submitted this servant’s memorial for transmitting the precepts of resolute will—a yellow silk memorial with red borders—to be heard in the presence of the Pure Mystery. Let no subordinate officials obstruct or intercept the document, preventing its ascent."*

The servant seals the qi within the mouth, and the memorial ascends to the Courts of the Three Heavens, awaiting the report in response. Once the memorial is prostrated upon the ground, the palace rites proceed as in the preceding petition.

Next, the master rises, turns left, and faces south, while the disciple turns to face north, the two standing opposite one another. The master kneels at length and says:

*"The Duly Appointed Dharma Master, Master of the Sacred Peak [Name], your servant [Name], bows his head and prostrates himself twice, reverently addressing the Supreme, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneously Self-Arising Perfect Great Dao; the Utmost Primordial Honored One; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Heavenly Worthies of the Boundless Dao and Virtue in the Ten Directions; the Most Perfect Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Perfected of the Great Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity; and the Heavenly Master Lord.*

*This servant, of foolish and lowly station, is but a walking corpse of foul flesh. By the karmic conditions of past lives, I have presumptuously borne a burden far beyond my worth, advancing to receive the precious scriptures of the Three Treasures. Yet I have failed to retire into secluded forests, transcending worldly traces, nor have I widely propagated the imperial teachings, broadly established fields of merit, delivered the suffering through ascetic practice, or accumulated merit to redress my faults. Instead, I remain indistinguishable from ordinary men, unable to discern the demonic from the mundane. The Great Dao, in its boundless compassion, has preserved my life and limbs, allowing me to behold the sun, moon, and stars to this day. The depth of its grace is measureless, and I am truly without limit in my gratitude.*

*This servant, trembling with awe, bows his head and prostrates himself, acknowledging his mortal transgressions, mortal transgressions indeed.*

*I have heard that the sacred scriptures are of such exalted dignity that they cannot be practiced by the vulgar and base, and their profound meanings are so abstruse that they cannot be gazed upon by the shallow understanding and fleshly eyes of a humble servant such as myself. Yet by a stroke of fortune, I have encountered this turning of the kalpa, when the Three Caverns govern the age, and the worthy are sought out. Thus, this defiled vessel has been deemed fit to receive the numinous texts.*

*Having only recently received the scriptures, I am unworthy to reveal them. Yet now, in the ren-chen cycle, the Great Peace draws near, and fortune and misfortune intertwine. Without those who have attained the Dao, the kalpas cannot be preserved. Though the hearts of men are inscrutable, the wise diligently seek, and the Way should not be entirely cut off.*

*Thus, I humbly present [Name], a male or female Daoist official of [Prefecture, County, Village], who has purified himself and cultivated a pure conduct, aspiring to the attainment of immortality. Having already received the great deliverance of the Three Caverns, he has yet to fully awaken to the Mysterious Teachings or traverse the true path. Now, bearing sincerity and offering his heart, he seeks to receive the Ten Essential Precepts of the Two Halves of the Diagram, as expounded by the Heavenly Worthy to stabilize resolve and fathom subtleties. His earnest devotion is such that it cannot be refused. Therefore, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, I have divided the covenant, received the diagram, transmitted the prohibitions, and made oaths before the Three Officials, pledging not to recklessly disclose them.*

*I now reverently submit this for your consideration, awaiting your decree for its implementation. This servant, trembling with awe, bows his head and prostrates himself twice to make this known."*

Next, the text of the diagram is read aloud:

The Four Qi of Pristine Emptiness and Spontaneity are originally one, scattering into two halves. Through the intermingling qi, one half descends, and the four components reunite as one. Having received the *Sutra of Stabilizing Resolve and Contemplating the Subtle*, one must not commit the Five Heinous Crimes, ascending to return to the One. Pristine Emptiness and Spontaneity, though present in the realm of desire, receive the merit of the Ten Precepts of Stabilizing Resolve and Contemplating the Subtle, naturally ascending by degrees. The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, their virtue unceasing, abide in eternal joy. Those who do not receive the *Sutra of Stabilizing Resolve and Contemplating the Subtle* and persist in evil naturally accumulate it, descending as wayward souls. Thus, wayward souls naturally summon the upper half, and the lower half enters here. When the two halves are exhausted and reunite as one, from there they enter the Eighteen Hells, ceaselessly as hungry ghosts and beasts. Yet again, the four components reunite as one. For evil, one descends; for goodness, one ascends through the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Formless Heavens are empty and do not abide; the Heavens of Form are empty and do not abide; the Heavens of Desire are empty and do not abide—non-abiding, all is emptiness, and emptiness cannot be grasped. One hundred seventy-seven characters.

Next, draw a single line: the master holds the brush above, the disciple holds it below, and together they draw one stroke. The disciple follows the master’s words, saying: "After drawing the One, I reverently adhere to the covenant, honoring the Dao and esteeming virtue, revering the Three Treasures. I will perform purification rites, uphold the precepts, and deliver beings from the cycle of birth and death. Beyond this, any violation of the regulations shall be as the *Scripture of Luminous Perfection* decrees."

Next, the diagram contract is broken: male disciples receive the left half, female disciples the right.

Next, inscribe the ring: on the left, write "Left Primordial Above," the disciple repeating after the master. On the right, write "Right Mysterious Elder," and afterward inscribe the ring’s center with "Most High." The master then says: "These Three Masters are the Heavenly Worthy, the Left Mysterious Perfected, and the Right Mysterious Perfected."

Next, the master threads the ring through the diagram contract and places it on the altar. The disciple faces south, kneeling lengthily, holding cinnabar water before the heart. The master faces north and begins the oath, saying:

"Most High Numinous Treasure, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns or Cavernous Mystery, Master of the [Dharma] from [Sacred Peak], your servant [Name], humbly invokes the cinnabar water. From [Prefecture, County, Village], [Full Name], aged [Number] years, presents words and pledges, entrusting their life to this servant, seeking to receive the Ten Essential Precepts of the Two Halves of the Diagram of Stabilizing Resolve and Contemplating the Subtle. Previously, they have submitted a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the Most High and the assembly of Worthies. May the overseeing covenant lords, the Numinous Treasure Lords, the Numinous Treasure Venerable, the Lords and Officers of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—and the seven generations of my ancestors witness that [Name] has come seeking life, purifying themselves, offering their heart, and receiving the numinous and wondrous scriptural instructions. They vow to uphold the great Dharma, revering it in every action, guarding their speech, conducting themselves with care, casting aside worldly attachments, severing external distractions, calming the mind, and maintaining silence, focusing their resolve on the Dharma. They must not pollute it, nor lead others astray to disrupt the true qi. In every act, they shall practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings, bringing peace to the realm and prosperity to the people, unifying the Four Seas. May their seven generations of ancestors all ascend and be delivered, their bodies entering radiant light, reborn swiftly among humans. When the great kalpa ends, may they together ascend to the Upper Clarity. For those not yet delivered, the term shall be forty years. They must not leak this in the interim, recklessly transmitting it to the unworthy, breaking the covenant, violating the oath, or carelessly divulging the sacred texts. Should they do so, their parents in life and death shall be bound in eternal night, tormented by wind and blades for ten thousand kalpas, without cause for complaint. Any transgression of the prohibitions shall be as the *Scripture of Luminous Perfection* decrees."

Next, the disciple makes their own oath, saying:

"Disciple [Name], having received the true command and oral instructions from the Dharma Master, dares not violate or recklessly transmit them to the unworthy, lest calamity extend to my person. I vow not to betray the true deities of the above and below, center and periphery, the four directions and eight quarters. Today, I together consume the covenant water, abide by the Dharma, purify myself, and cultivate the wondrous instructions. I pray that both disciple and master may transcend heavenly disasters—the ninety-six solar cycles, the great calamity of the Jia-Shen year—passing from kalpa to kalpa without loss or excess, the sun and moon shining together, the Three Treasures turning in harmony. Humbly receiving the Three Cavern Heavenly Scriptures from the Numinous Treasure Venerable, I acknowledge the grace of this life."

Next, the master exhales the cinnabar water three times, passing it to the disciple, who exhales it three times until it is consumed. Then, the master passes the diagram contract to the disciple, who kneels lengthily to receive it—males with the left hand, females with the right. The recipient circles their waist three times with their left hand, bows three times to the master, then recites the Three Wisdom Chapters to completion and turns to pay homage to the Ten Directions. Next, the master stands in the south, and the disciple faces the master, bowing three times, visualizing the Great Saints of the Ten Directions above. Then, they receive the Nine Precepts.

The master recites the precepts:

The Heavenly Worthy says: "The two halves reuniting as one holds five meanings. Do you understand?"

The Two Perfected answer: "We do. Is it not that from the qi of Pristine Emptiness, through the mingling of misty vapors, one half descends, and these four halves reunite as one? Is it not that those who falsely claim the One to do evil summon the spontaneous qi, sinking into the Three Wretched Realms? Is it not that by doing good, one departs these four halves, returns to the Great Void, restores the qi of Pristine Emptiness, reunites the two halves, and abides in spontaneity?"

The Heavenly Worthy says: "You have grasped it. Now, I shall display the revolving diagram of the two halves in the empty space before the Left Perfected."

The Heavenly Worthy says: "Though you have received this instruction, you must take the Nine Precepts as the foundation:

1. Do not kill; contemplate the lives of all beings.
2. Do not engage in licentiousness or entertain wayward thoughts.
3. Do not steal or take wealth by unjust means.
4. Do not deceive; do not reverse judgments of good and evil.
5. Abstain from alcohol; always reflect on pure conduct.
6. Harmonize with clan and kin, without partiality.
7. Upon seeing others do good, rejoice and assist in their merit.
8. Upon seeing others in distress, aid them in performing good deeds.
9. Do not harbor expectations for those who have not attained the Dao."

Disciple [Name], having received the precepts, shall uphold and cultivate them for life."

The disciple bows three times to the master. Then the disciple recites the *Five Hymns of Wisdom and Praise*. Flowers are scattered, good omens are chanted, and three bows are made.

The Supreme Mystery of the Great Void,
Reveres its scriptures to propagate the Dao.
In reverence and awe, one attains immortality,
Passing through kalpas without number.

Majestic is the virtue of the Great Perfected,
Serene in the cause of non-arising.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
Riding the void in natural ascent.

Sun and moon serve as blazing torches,
Peace and harmony bring endless joy.
To learn immortality, sever ornate thoughts,
Each念 builds upon the last.

Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restless, it knows no stillness.
Extinguish念 and dwell in emptiness,
Whispering into profound silence.

Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
Hold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.
Preserve the child and soar the mysterious path,
The Five Numinous Talismans will ferry your register.

Deliver me through the Six Perfections,
Thus able to unbind the Three Nets.
Purify the fast and honor the Primal Simplicity,
Exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-sprout.

Roam within the Golden Gates,
The Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
Each person seated upon a blooming lotus.

Gazing up, I chew the fruit of the Mystic Capital,
Bowing down, I hold the melon of the Empty Cavern.
My countenance shines like the ten suns,
Why reckon the multitude of kalpas?

The dharma drum summons the celestial immortals,
The tolling bell subdues the great demons.
A divine wind fans the fragrant blossoms,
Resplendent, unfurling the brocade robes.

The Great Perfected strums the cloud zither,
The assembled immortals pluck the cloud harps.
Elegant songs of the Three Heavens’ radiance,
Scatter wisdom through the Jade Flower Grove.

The seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,
By this, they tread the mysterious tones.
If past-life virtue was insufficient,
This scripture remains distant and hard to find.

If faith in the Dao is not whole,
Even with the chart to soar, one sinks instead.
The Dao of the Supreme is non-action,
Its propagation lies in the heart of the multitudes.

To learn the Dao, trust in the cinnabar faith,
Honor the master as if they were your closest kin.
Draw near the radiance and pair with purity,
Diligently renew yourself with each passing day.

Until all beings are delivered,
I shall not cross over myself.

Here concludes the *Transmission Rites of the Two Sections of the Supreme Mystery and Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*.
