**Scripture of the Sequence of Names, Styles, Appearances, Abodes, and Locations of the Three Masters and Five Guarantors**
It is said: Without a master, one cannot attain salvation; without a master, one cannot attain immortality.
It is also said: First visualize the Three Masters, then perform the Dao.
Whenever one wishes to read scriptures, expound teachings, perform rituals, burn incense, enter chambers, or ascend altars, one must first pay homage to the master and visualize them.
Next, one should make vows to deliver the nine generations of ancestors and oneself; if this method is not followed, the Perfected Spirits will not descend.
When paying homage to the master, one must know their location; when visualizing them, one must clearly recognize their appearance.
At the time of receiving the Dao, the master shall instruct accordingly.
Thus, from the Orthodox Unity upward to the Cavernous Perfection, upon receiving the Three Masters’ names, styles, appearances, abodes, and locations, they are listed as follows:

**Names of the Three Masters**
In the *Da Ming* year of such-and-such, such-and-such year, such-and-such month, such-and-such day of the first lunar day, so-and-so, from such-and-such prefecture, such-and-such county, such-and-such township, such-and-such village, such-and-such abbey, the Orthodox Unity Covenant Disciple, affiliated with the Celestial Master’s such-and-such treatment, the Supreme Central Qi of such-and-such qi, the Orthodox Unity Covenant Disciple, the Perfected of the Original Destiny of the Three-Five Step Net, the Perfected of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins, the Grand Capital Merit Golden Button Disciple, the High Mystery Ritual Master of the Supreme, such-and-such Master, the Supreme Three Treasures Disciple of the Great Mystery Capital, the Lesser Perfected of the Cavernous Abyss Divine Mantra Nine Heavens Ritual Master, the Cavernous Divine Disciple, the Cavernous Divine Supreme Unity Vajra Complete Contract Disciple, the Numinous Treasure Ascending Mystery Inner Teaching Ritual Master, the Numinous Treasure Disciple, the Cavernous Mystery Disciple, the Supreme Numinous Treasure Cavernous Mystery Disciple, such-and-such Mountain Perfected, the Cavernous Divine Three Sovereigns Inner Vision Disciple, the Supreme Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavernous Divine Disciple, the Supreme Mystery River Chart Treasure Register Nine Palaces Perfected, the Upper Clarity Disciple, the Upper Clarity Great Cavern Disciple, the Upper Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple, such-and-such Mountain Perfected, the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple, such-and-such Mountain Perfected, [name], aged so many years, of such-and-such original destiny, born in such-and-such month.
Now, at such-and-such abbey in this prefecture and county, having received the Orthodox Unity and Three Caverns scriptures and methods, I request the names of the Three Masters as follows:

Initiation Master, Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master, [name], aged so many years, secondary form: red.

Register Master, Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master, [name], aged so many years, secondary form: red, complexion: pale, with slight beard.

Scripture Master, Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master, [name], aged seventy-two, secondary form: yellow-white.

Names of the Three Masters Presiding at the Altar
Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master [name].
Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master [name].
Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Great Cavern Master [name].

Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple [name].
Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple [name].
Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple [name].
Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries Disciple [name].

The Three Masters and Five Guarantors above are all the disciple’s fellow students, persons of lofty virtue and close acquaintance, or advanced disciples and later scholars of exceptional talent, jointly appointed to these roles. They encourage and support one another, revered as masters, hence called the Three Masters.

Offering the ritual cloth and knife, with which to brush away dust and grime, sever entanglements and bonds, unravel the nets of affliction, and break through the webs of obstruction—thus abiding in liberation, carefree and luminously pure.

This humble and unlearned disciple, undeservingly receiving this register, states: Disciple [name], respectfully following the master’s method, has received the names of the Three Masters as above, to be held in mind throughout life, never daring to violate or transgress. Should any violation occur, the seven generations of ancestors shall together suffer the wind-knife. Bowing twice in reverence.

Whenever writing the names of the Scripture, Register, and Initiation Masters, one must include their respective prefecture, county, abbey, age, name, physical appearance, and ritual rank. For the Three Masters Presiding at the Altar and the Five Guarantors, age need not be recorded, but their ritual rank must be included.

Senior General: one person.
Deputy General: one person.
Middle General: one person.

For men and women receiving these Three Generals: men take the left, women take the right—this is the standard practice.

**Fourth Rank: Supreme Clarity Abbey**

On the seventh day of the first month in the second year of Han’an, at noon, the Supreme Clarity bestowed the Twenty-Four Abbeys, aligning the three eights with the twenty-four qi of Heaven and the twenty-eight lodges, entrusting them to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling to proclaim and propagate the Dao. Those who received them were granted the Upper Kitchen, with twenty-four worthy ones to partake in the feast.

To the left: the Balanced Qi of the First, Yangping and Lutang;
To the right: the Balanced Qi.
To the left: the Senior Qi of the Second, Heming and Liyuan;
To the right: the Senior Qi.
To the left: the Metropolitan Overseer of the Third, Gegui and Gengchu;
To the right: the Metropolitan Overseer.
To the left: the Divine Overseer of the Fourth, Qinzhong and Zhenduo;
To the right: the Divine Overseer.
To the left: the Metropolitan Supervisor of the Fifth, Changli and Lishang;
To the right: the Metropolitan Supervisor.
To the left: the Divine Supervisor of the Sixth, Yongquan and Jushan;
To the right: the Divine Supervisor.
To the left: the Inspector of the Seventh, Choujing and Benzhu;
To the right: the Inspector.
To the left: the Merit Overseer of the Eighth, Mengqin and Pinggai;
To the right: the Merit Overseer.
To the left: the Merit Supervisor of the Ninth, Yuntai and Jinkou;
To the right: the Merit Supervisor.
To the left: the Metropolitan Qi of the Tenth, Houcheng and Gongmu;
To the right: the Metropolitan Qi.
To the left: the Tribute Qi of the Eleventh, Pinggang and Zhubu;
To the right: the Tribute Qi.
To the left: the Inspecting Qi of the Twelfth, Yuju and Beimang;
To the right: the Inspecting Qi.

The twenty-four qi officials of the Yin-Yang Libationer ranks were conferred upon Daoling on the same day. The qi had only two original versions, with *Wan Tong* as above, while the remaining three versions followed the Senior Qi onward, each disordered and impossible to collate. Now, *Wan Tong* is deemed correct, and thus marked in red to clarify the sequence, each paired with its respective abbey in order.

At the conclusion of this, the Yin names pertain to women, and the Yang titles to men. Men occupy the left Balanced Qi, women the right Balanced Qi. The accumulation of old conflicts in transmission has led to this origin—how could it be otherwise? As the *Official Rites* states: the twenty-four qi of men and women make clear that men and women share these twelve, doubled left and right to form twenty-four. The evidence is sound; there should be no doubt.

Some say: Yangping is assigned to the left, Lutang to the right—how could a man receive Lutang without a Yin name, or a woman bear Yangping, usurping a male title? Such reasoning is decisively incorrect; other texts follow this pattern.

1. **Ganghu Abbey**

The Master of Fire governs the Upper Realm of the Starry Lodge, located within the boundaries of Hanyang County.

**2. Baishi Abbey**
The Master of Metal governs the Upper Realm of Zhang Lodge, located within the boundaries of Hanyang County.

**3. Zhongmao Abbey**
The Master of Water governs the Upper Realm of Yi Lodge, located within the boundaries of Fukou County.

**4. Jushan Abbey**
The Master of Earth governs the Upper Realm of Han Lodge, located within the boundaries of Guangyang County.

In the third year of Jian’an, the Celestial Master, in the *Taizhen Code*, stated: On the seventh day of the first month of the first year, the four Lower Abbeys were bestowed, transmitted to the Heir Master, and from the Heir Master to the Lineage Master, to complete the twenty-eight lodges. Upon receiving an abbey, eighteen worthy individuals were to be feasted.

The *Taizhen Code* states: Those outside are called Separate Abbeys; those within are called Supplementary Abbeys, totaling twenty-four and completing twenty-eight. The Separate Abbeys correspond to the three eights.

**1. Liyuan Abbey**, Master of Metal, paired with Changli Abbey.
**2. Lilǐ Abbey**, Master of Wood, paired with Lishang Abbey.
**3. Pinggong Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Yongquan Abbey.
**4. Gongmu Abbey**, Master of Earth, paired with Chougeng Abbey. (Note: Gongmu shares its name with the fourth of the Lower Eight Abbeys.)

**5. Tiantai Abbey**, Master of Wood, paired with Benzhu Abbey.
**6. Laixiang Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Mengqin Abbey.
**7. Zunling Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Pinggai Abbey.
**8. Daiyuan Abbey**, Master of Metal, paired with Yuntai Abbey.

On the fifth day of the tenth month of the first year of Jian’an, at sunrise, the Celestial Master bestowed the eight paired abbeys, transmitting them to the Heir Master, who then passed them to the Lineage Master. Upon receiving an abbey, fourteen worthy individuals were to be feasted. One version states fourteen, another twelve, and another omits the feasting of worthies. If following the previous convention of descending by fourteen, twelve would be appropriate; the discrepancy is likely an error.

Among the four versions, all include Stone Chambers, but none include Zunling or Stone Hall. The *Taizhen Code* also omits Stone Hall but includes Zunling; thus, Zunling is now confirmed as correct.

These are all paired with the Middle Eight, yet Jushan is uniquely absent, and Yuntai is irregularly paired among them. This creates a deficiency of one, deepening the confusion. Moreover, their locations within commanderies and counties remain uncertain, and their exact placements are unclear.

**1. Emei Abbey**, Master of Metal, in Shu Commandery.
**2. Qingcheng Abbey**, Master of Water, in Shu Commandery.
**3. Taihua Abbey**, Master of Wood, in Jingzhao Chang’an. (Note: One version mistakenly writes "Wood Leaf"; the *Taizhen Code* also places Taihua here.)
**4. Huangjin Abbey**, Master of Wood, in Quyang County of Shu Commandery.
**5. Cimu Abbey**, Master of Metal, in Chengdu Commandery.
**6. Afeng Abbey**, Master of Fire.
**7. Pingdu Abbey**, Master of Water, in Jianwei Commandery.
**8. Jiyang Abbey**, Master of Earth, in Ye County of Wei Commandery.

The above eight abbeys were established by the Lineage Master and disseminated on the fifth day of the tenth month of the third year of Jian’an. Upon receiving an abbey, twelve worthy individuals were to be feasted. These are called the Itinerant Abbeys, and their sequence is now confirmed in alignment with the *Taizhen Code*. Some texts, however, list Jiyang as the seventh and Pingdu as the eighth, which is incorrect.

Left: **Lingjue 1**, Emei’s Right: **Lingjue**.
Left: **Xuanwei 2**, Qingcheng’s Right: **Xuanwei**.
Left: **Gongping 3**, Taihua’s Right: **Gongping**.
Left: **Lianping 4**, Huangjin’s Right: **Lianping**.
Left: **Xingjiao 5**, Cimu’s Right: **Xingjiao**.
Left: **Weiyi 6**, Afeng’s Right: **Weiyi**.
Left: **Chengqi 7**, Pingdu’s Right: **Chengqi**.
Left: **Jianyi 8**, Jiyang’s Right: **Jianyi**.

The above sixteen Official Libationers were established by the Lineage Master. Only two versions preserve the sequence as above; three others are disordered and difficult to clarify.

Since these officials were established by the Lineage Master, they should correspond to the abbeys disseminated by the Lineage Master, such as Emei and others. Now, each abbey is annotated below. If pairing abbeys, the preceding *Du Jian* and subsequent qi should be used; if separating, *Jian Gong* and subsequent qi should be applied. Each should be paired according to its proper sequence.

In total, there are four ranks and forty-four abbeys. According to the abbey rituals, from the earliest to the most revered, the order is: first the Itinerant Abbeys, second the Separate Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Three Eights’ Principal Abbeys—these are the four ranks of abbeys.

The *Taizhen Code* lists them as: first the Separate Abbeys, second the Itinerant Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Unified Abbeys. Reasoning from the code, this would imply the Itinerant Abbeys outrank the Separate Abbeys, which is incorrect. How do we know this? The Itinerant Abbeys were established by the Lineage Master, while the Separate Abbeys were bestowed by Heaven, embodying the principle of supplementing the lodges for the spring and autumn seasons. A child does not precede the father; how could a grandson’s establishment surpass the grandfather’s? This is decisively incorrect. Following the principles of Rong’s exegesis, the Itinerant Abbeys are subordinate to the Separate Abbeys; this is the true and correct understanding.

The **Gongping** office governs the qi and numbers of Heaven and Earth, ranks alongside the Master, oversees all abbeys, and manages the affairs of spirits.
