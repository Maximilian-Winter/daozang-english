### *Yellow Plain Threefold Alliance Ascension Altar Rite*

On the first day of the [X] month in the [X] year of the reign of [X] state, at the [X] hour, [X], a Master of the Three Caverns, Wandering Master of the Five Peaks, and Black Prime One Daoist of the [X] Ordinance under Celestial Master [X], residing in the [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, and [X] village, hereby transmits the following:

Formerly, [X], a male official, received from the Master of the Three Caverns and Black Prime One Daoist [X] the primordial mandate of Lord Lao, the unity of Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon, and the Five Planets, as well as the Upper Three Heavens, the True One, the Prime One, the Universal Overseer of the Five Hundred Fifty-Five Quintillion, Five Hundred Fifty-Five Billion, Five Hundred Fifty-Five Million Layers of All Heavens, all the sun, moon, and stars, all immortal courts, all worldly and otherworldly mountains and peaks, celestial spirits and earthly deities, the Five Peaks and Four Seas, the Three Rivers and Nine Streams, the Four Seas and Eight Extremities, mountain gods and water spirits, the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits—all of which belong to the Upper Three Heavens, the True One, and the Prime One.

Now, at the [X] hour on the first day of the [X] month in the [X] year, [X], a Perfected of the [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, and [X] village, aged [X] years, of pure and sincere disposition, devoted to the Dao and fond of life, harmonious in yin and yang, with the Five Blacks governing the body, having previously received the *Yellow Diagram* and the *True Heaven Red Register*, the *True Heaven Three Ones*, the *True One*, and the *Prime One Plain Contract*, yet after years of cultivation still unable to ascend as an immortal, seeks to advance and receive the talismanic credentials of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thrones of the Upper Three Heavens, the True One, and the Prime One.

[He] shall hold the Vajra, divide the true form, and cast it into the golden fish, swearing an alliance with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Together, they shall split the golden contract, carve the arm to drink the cinnabar blood, and bind their hair and lives in oath, becoming one body with [X], united in heart and covenant to uphold the celestial Perfected, cultivate the immortal path, and ascend together to Heaven.

[He] must not indulge in sensual desires or deviate from the Orthodox Unity. After receiving the Dao, for thirty-six years, should an worthy recipient appear, transmission may be granted. No reckless dissemination is permitted. [He] must not seek exalted rank while neglecting the root, nor turn away with false words, harbor dual intentions, slander the Dao of the master, or assault the master’s authority. Any violation of this covenant shall result in [his] body being handed over to the Three Officials, becoming a lowly ghost forever, with [his] name erased from the registers of the living. [He] shall harbor no resentment.

[X], of his own volition and joy in the immortal path, without coercion, hereby marks this as a pledge.

**Right:** The Upper Contract of the True One’s Alliance, inscribed on both sides.

---

In the [X] year of the reign of [X] state, on the first day of the [X] month, at the [X] hour, [X], a male or female official, Prime One Daoist, and Perfected of the [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, and [X] village, aged [X] years, approaches your servant [X] to receive the Prime One’s altar alliance and covenant, the oral transmission of the True One’s alliance, and deliverance from life and death. No violation is permitted, as per the statutes and decrees of Lord Lao.

**Right:** The Middle Contract of the Prime One’s Alliance.

---

[X], a Wandering Master of the Five Peaks under Celestial Master [X] of the Black [Ordinance], your servant [X], having previously, in the [X] year, on the [X] day of the [X] month, at the [X] hour, received from the Master of the Three Caverns, the Left and Right Black Masters of the Yangping Ordinance and the Five Blacks, and the [X] Peak Master [X], the method of the Prime One’s True Contract and Threefold Alliance, for deliverance from life and death, ascension from the Nine Dark Realms, the registration of the seven generations of ancestors, and the deliverance of [his] own body and three sons, ensuring their attainment of immortality alongside the Prime One, hereby records the following:

The Prime One Daoist [X], male or female, born [X] in the [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, and [X] village, swears an alliance, receiving the tonsure and binding [his] hair, pledging life and death to the covenant, never betraying the great alliance of the Prime One Emperor Lord and the immortal statutes. The Five Thearchs, demon kings, and all beings of the Three Realms shall be delivered. [X], the Prime One Daoist, shall ascend beyond the Three Realms, [his] name recorded among the ranks of the immortals.

**Right:** The Lower Contract of the Prime One’s Alliance, inscribed on both sides.

---

For those receiving the Threefold Alliance, five, seven, or nine persons must jointly swear the covenant; fewer is not in accordance with the law. This rite delivers from the sins of a hundred generations above and ensures passage through the palaces of the Three Realms below. The Threefold Alliance is the utmost [method] for transcending life and death to attain immortality, without error or deviation.

After receiving the alliance, one must form a covenant with others. Before five days have passed, the reverse upper alliance shall be reported to the twenty-four prisons of the prefecture and county ordinances to deliver [X] and his seven generations of ancestors and parents. After the completion of the five-day purification, this secret oral transmission of the master may be conferred—worth ten thousand gold, transmitted only to the worthy, never to the unworthy.

[X], male or female official of the [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, and [X] village, aged [X] years.

**Right:** [X] persons, having previously received the *Yellow Diagram*, the *Red Register*, the oral transmission of the Three Ones, the True One, and the Prime One, yet after years of cultivation still unable to fathom the mysteries of past karma, now present their credentials and approach your servant to receive the True One and Prime One’s contract and the Threefold Alliance Register.

---

Respectfully submitted by your servant [X], Wandering Master of the [X] Peak under Celestial Master [X] of the Black [Ordinance].

I humbly state: According to the documents, though your servant is of lowly station, with flesh still tainted and bones exposed, I have been graciously favored by this enlightened age and the teachings of the venerable master. Overwhelmed by the burden, my efforts at instruction and transformation have been ineffective, and my exhortations have gone unheeded. Day and night, I tremble as if treading upon ice or a ravine.

Now, the male and female officials and Prime One Daoists [X] and others, [X] persons aged [X] years, having previously received the oral transmission but not the secret method of the Prime One’s Threefold Alliance, each present their ritual credentials and approach your servant to swear the alliance. The primordial cinnabar, the red elixir, moves the divine spirits, though their entreaties are as faint as shadows.

Your servant, having received their credentials, instructed them in the oral transmission. Yet the Dao is weighty, and the people are light—I dared not confer it lightly. Together, we ascended the Yellow Altar, where they received the covenant, swearing by Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon as witnesses. They carved their arms, drank the cinnabar, and pledged before the divine spirits never to recklessly transmit it.

After receiving the alliance, they must not lightly disseminate or reveal its true essence. They shall uphold the master’s teachings as per this covenant. Any violation shall result in their bodies being handed over to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. After death, they shall harbor no resentment.

I beseech forgiveness for all transgressions committed by [X] before receiving the transmission. May all be pardoned. I humbly implore...

The Most High Supreme Unity Emperor, the Merciful Father and Sacred Mother, have deigned to review and govern. Herewith, this humble servant confers the Threefold Covenant of the Supreme Unity’s Ascent to the Altar, transmitting its essential instructions.

**Yellow Silk Petition:**
From [X] Prefecture, [X] County, [X] Township, the male official [X], aged [X] years, and others, humbly beseech pardon and present this petition. Born of flesh and blood, I have been fortunate beyond measure to enter the gates of the Dao, belonging to the household under the governance of my master [X], who holds the Mandate of Heaven. In former times, by the grace of an enlightened era, I was permitted to study the secret Yellow Chart and Red Registers, the true and supreme teachings of the Three Ones and the Supreme Unity’s *Returning Chariot and Completed Contract*. Yet, though I have practiced for many years, my merits remain unestablished, and my transgressions are manifold. Day and night, I tremble with dread, as though treading upon ice or crossing a chasm. Though I have cultivated life and nurtured my primordial qi, and though I have received boundless grace, I have yet to fulfill the Nine Sincerities and One Hundred Twenty Deeds, nor have I offered reverence to the Thirty-Two Heavens or sought the method of transcending karmic destiny. The Great Covenant of the Supreme Three Heavens’ True One and Supreme Unity’s Ascent to the Altar is a teaching I have never before encountered. Not only have I been blinded by the Six Obstructions, but I have also known only advancement and forgotten retreat. Thus, I humbly present thirty-two ritual offerings, bringing them to the altar to beseech completion. Should I be deemed worthy of instruction, I swear never to recklessly reveal or betray its essence. Should I attack the root or sever the source, violating this covenant, I shall offer my body in repayment to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Even in death, I shall harbor no resentment. Respectfully submitted in the year of [Tai Sui’s reign].

From [X] Prefecture, [X] County, [X] Township, the male and female officials [X] and others, we respectfully list the ritual offerings as follows:

One *hu* of raw rice, sixty-four *chi* of fine silk, one bundle of willow firewood, one pair of brushes, two hundred fifty *jin* of iron, one cake of ink, two hundred fifty *chi* of black silk, one writing knife, twelve *liang* of gold, one large mat, two hundred forty *chi* of yellow silk, one *liang* of true pearls, one ritual headscarf, one coarse robe, one pair of gold rings, five ritual tables, one bright mirror, one five-colored ritual pouch for precepts, thirty-two thousand covenant coins, one brocade pouch for scriptures and collected texts, thirty-two *liang* of life-thread silk, one cold-water jar and spoon, one blue-green bronze sword, five sets of blended incense, one male and one female substitute of living flesh, one hundred twenty *chi* of radiant brocade, eighty *jin* of copper, eighty-one *chi* of blue-green silk, sixty-four *liang* of raw cinnabar, twelve *liang* of silver, one hundred sheets of large paper, three hundred sixty bolts of white silk.

The above thirty-two offerings are respectfully presented to the altar to receive the Threefold Covenant of the Ascent.

**Petition:**
In accordance with the scriptural texts, though I am of humble station, I have been entrusted with the exalted duty of the Supreme Unity to seek out and transmit to the worthy and capable. As recorded in the registers, the male and female officials [X] and others, who have cultivated pure and refined qi, delight in the Dao and cherish life, have now received the Five Qi, mastering the yin-yang governance of the body and refining their qi over many years. Their talents qualify them for advancement to the highest ranks of the Supreme Three Heavens’ True One and Supreme Unity. They shall oversee the five hundred fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five billions of all heavens, all suns, all moons, all provinces, constellations, and starry lodges, all immortal courts, sages, palaces, and mountain peaks, the deities of Heaven and Earth, the Five Peaks and Four Seas, the Three Rivers and Nine Jiang, the Four Seas and Eight Poles, the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, the divine chambers, mountain spirits, and water numina, all myriad ghosts and ten thousand spirits. They shall universally gather the thirty-six thousand spirits, govern all numinous beings, command all officials, attend all immortals, and oversee the three *hun* and seven *po* of their households and states, the three ghosts and five spirits, the one thousand two hundred forms and shadows, and the ten thousand two hundred essences and luminosities—all shall come at once to refine and transform them. From this day forth, having received the Supreme Three Heavens’ True One and Supreme Unity, they must not betray the covenant of the Supreme Three Heavens, attack their master, recklessly transmit, or lightly reveal its teachings. They must select the worthy and transmit but once every thirty-three years, never violating this pact. Should they break this vow, their spirit-bodies shall sink into obscurity, forever becoming lowly ghosts, their lives reduced to dust. Their immortal names shall be erased, and they shall never again be counted among the ranks of immortals. They shall be eternally bound by the Three Officials’ judgment, summoned by the lords and clerks for examination. Only when their karmic debts are repaid may they be reinstated among mortals. Thus, we respectfully present this petition to the Supreme Three Heavens’ Most High Supreme Unity Emperor, the Supreme Three Heavens’ Most High Primordial Sovereign, the Supreme Three Heavens’ Great Dao and Myriad Ways, the Root and Origin of Heaven and Earth, the Primordial Beginning, extending upward to the Most High and downward to the boundless, reaching afar to the infinite and limitless, the subtle and myriad officials and spirits of the Supreme Three Heavens above the five hundred fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five billions of heavens. We invoke the lords, generals, clerks, functionaries, messengers, scribes, minor officials, generals, officers, cavalry, and all attendant officials—five hundred fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five billions of hosts—to descend as one from the Supreme Three Heavens above, from the canopy of Heaven to the depths of our bodies, from head to foot, suffusing our bones and joints, the five viscera and six bowels, the nine palaces and twelve spirit-chambers, the four limbs and five bodies, the one hundred eighty mechanisms, the three hundred sixty bone-joints, the orifices, defensive and constructive qi, sinews, bones, blood, and vessels. We beseech you to pacify our three *hun*, stabilize our seven *po*, immortalize our three *hun*, rectify our five spirits, generate our five viscera, align them with the Five Stars, and summon back the thirty-six thousand remaining spirits to their offices. May each be settled in their chambers, that the immortal Dao may be perfected, our forms ascend in flight, and we become True Persons. May our immortal lifespans be fixed at eighteen thousand years. We pray to the Supreme Three Heavens’ Supreme Unity, the Lord of Myriad Ways and Ancestor of Myriad Spirits, to send the Heavenly Immortals to guard our bodies, inspect the registers of the myriad spirits, and grant that the flying immortals, divine immortals, world-transcending immortals, divine humans, True Persons, Primordial Yang, Myriad Lives, Myriad Qi, Guiding Immortals, Embryonic Breath, Primordial Essence, Longevity-Extending, and Supreme Polarity Lords of the Supreme Three Heavens above may descend into our bodies, refining and transforming us without end.

May the Generals of the Supreme Unity, the Great One, the Lords of the Pure Tenuity Heaven, the Jade Capital Heaven, and the Great Scarlet Heaven descend in unison, leading their hosts of officers, soldiers, cavalry, and chariots, to enter our bodies. May they nurture our lives and cultivate our natures, restore our years and replenish our brains, circulate the generative qi and distribute the primordial breath. May the golden elixir, divine nectar, and jade fluid enter our bodies, accompanied by divine maidens to attend and guard us on left and right. May the Nine Heavens’ Prime Ministers erase our names from the registers of death and inscribe them in the Three Heavens’ records of life, granting us boundless existence with heaven and earth. May we traverse the world, our names inscribed upon the sacred mountains of the Six Directions. May we move freely among people, extending our years and increasing our longevity, warding off the five weapons, quenching fires and floods, dispelling official calumnies, illnesses, deaths, and misfortunes. May tigers, wolves, and fierce beasts, venomous creatures, vengeful foes, thieves, and bandits be submerged in the Yellow Abyss, buried ten thousand fathoms deep, never to emerge or spread falsehoods.

Should any talisman masters, Daoist priests, or miscellaneous spirits of the Six Heavens’ former breath, or those who feast upon ghosts and spirits, attempt to intrude or conceal themselves, may the myriad spirits assist and escort us as we traverse the world. May the earthly deities and celestial spirits descend in every place we tread, manifesting the verification of the immortal Dao. May we surely achieve embryonic breathing, ingesting and guiding the divine breath, illuminating our inner and outer selves. May clouds course through our bodies, ascending to the Pure Heavens. May the Yellow Emperor and Laozi establish their grace, and may we befriend divine immortals, associating with True Persons. May we soar aloft, ascending to replenish the ranks of the Heavenly Immortals, riding clouds and driving dragons to pay homage to the Dao Lord. May we never age unto death, our luminosity equaling that of the sun and moon. May we fly and transcend, concealing or revealing ourselves at will, floating upon the wheel of existence. May our seven generations of parents, extending to the hundred million ancestors of myriad lineages, all ascend to the Three Heavens and be appointed to the ranks of immortal officials.

We humbly implore the Supreme Venerable, the Boundless Supreme Unity Lord, to bestow mercy and accept our plea.

**The Red Writs of the Three Covenants to be Conferred After the Breaking of the Pacts**
**Rites of the Three Covenants of the Supreme Unity and Yellow Simplicity**

We reverently present the Yellow Simplicity and Cinnabar Covenant, addressing all disciples:

We, [Name] and others, affirm our allegiance to the Gate of Boundless Purity of the Supreme Clarity and Supreme Unity, where the True One and the Five Qi, the Supreme Unity and the Nine Palaces, are fully perfected, thereby attaining immortal deliverance. The Supreme Venerable, upon ascending the Heavenly Summit of Kunlun and entering the Seven Treasures Abbey, summoned the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling and declared:

“Our Dao emerged from Non-Being, prior to the Great Beginning, unoriginated and yet nowhere unaccomplished. Formerly, upon this abbey, I received the wondrous Dharma. Through keen wisdom and focused devotion, I practiced and attained subtlety, penetrating the mysteries in pursuit of the Dao. None who ascend as immortals bear the name of negligence. Those who uphold the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi must master the secrets of life and death, ever fearing the Dharma and revering the precepts. Within the Gate of Life, there is but one path to life and nine paths to death. Tested by the Great Deliverance, one must ever tremble as if treading upon ice and blades, ever wary of poison lest it harm the self. Be humble and yielding, speak modestly, and lower oneself before others. Practice with diligence and endure hardship, never failing in filial piety and reverence. After receiving the precepts, uphold the Dharma and observe the prohibitions, never transgressing the numerical methods of the Nine and the One—the ultimate path of life.”

The Celestial Master bowed twice, pledged to uphold the covenant, and ascended to the rank of Celestial Master. Later, he transmitted the teachings to Wang Chang, Zhao Sheng, the Three Ladies of Luoyang, and the Three Dukes, all of whom attained ascension in broad daylight. The altar rites are as follows.

---

We reverently invoke the covenant and oath, presenting them to the Three Officials. We, [Name] and others, who receive this covenant, swear by heaven and earth as our witness, by the sun and moon as our bond, and call upon our three generations of ancestors, five lineages of forebears, seven generations of parents, and ourselves to bear witness. We shall not lightly transmit or divulge the altar precepts, which may be taught to three persons over nine years. Should no worthy recipient exist in the world, we shall report to the Three Officials, open the original covenant, seal the precepts and matters therein, and conceal them within a mountain’s stone chamber, never violating the covenant.

Should we uphold this pact, our seven generations of parents shall ascend to the Mysterious Palace, receive blessings from the Heavenly Officials, and attain immortal deliverance, their fortune flowing through ten thousand generations, their descendants forever honored. Should we recklessly transmit these teachings to the unworthy, our seven generations of parents shall descend to endure the trials of the Wind Blade, our bodies submerged in the River of Accumulated Nights, our misfortunes flowing through ten thousand generations, our descendants suffering eternal torment, drinking blood and consuming cinnabar, their divine hearts laid bare.

We open the seals of the Three Officials, witnessed by the sun and moon, heard by heaven and earth. After this covenant is sworn, the Controller of Destinies shall erase our names from the registers of death and inscribe them in the records of life. The Heavenly Officials shall register our immortal names, the Earthly Officials shall remove our death records, and the Water Officials shall sever our karmic trials. The Generals and Officers of the Three Officials’ Summoning Courts, along with the generals and officers we bear, shall protect our mortal bodies and ensure our immortal deliverance.

Should our past karma or unresolved grievances prevent immediate ascension, we must undergo temporary corpse liberation, passing through the Great Yin. Having ascended the altar and undergone the Great Deliverance, our sins shall be eradicated, our blessings born, and our ascent assured. The Twenty-Four Spirits of the Divine Chamber and Blessed Hall shall guard our forms, preventing the dispersal of our souls and the decay of our flesh and bones. After twenty-four years, our forms shall transform and emerge. Though our karmic debts demand death, we shall transcend and revive, our withered bones receiving immortality. Though submerged or concealed, we shall be unbound and unrestrained—such is the power of ascending the altar and swearing the Three Officials’ covenant, transcending kalpas and bestowing the fortune of deliverance from death.

We must cultivate ourselves with clarity and caution, never daring to violate this pact.

---

We reverently proclaim the covenant, addressing all disciples who share this altar and witness together:

Should our master or parents encounter calamity, we shall collectively aid them. Should they suffer unjust imprisonment, we shall exhaust all means to rescue and deliver them swiftly, never abandoning them lightly or betraying the covenant. Should any fail to respond to such pleas for help, the afflicted shall invoke the covenant and beseech the spirits for deliverance. Those who violate the covenant shall endure trials, while those who uphold it shall receive blessings.

Should we face calamity in perilous places, we shall, whether our master lives or has passed, silently pray at night, baring our cinnabar hearts to seek deliverance. Should we remain unrelieved, we shall report to the spirits of the luminous realm, who shall know our merit and transgression. The Generals and Officers of the Covenant, along with the Three Officials of the Altar, shall guard and protect us, ensuring our safety. We must only reverently uphold the covenant and never violate our oaths, thereby attaining immortal deliverance. The Guardian Generals and Officers shall record our merits and transgressions, while the Three Officials of the Altar shall adjudicate our sins and blessings. We must bear witness with clarity and caution.

On the first day of the [specific] month in the [regnal year] of the Great Year of [specific state], at [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village, under the qi-administering governance of Celestial Master [name] of [specific] Abbey, your servant [name], having received transmission from Daoist [name] of [specific] Abbey, hereby transmits to [name] of [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village the Three Covenants of the Yellow Plain Vermilion Alliance of the Most High.

All who ascend the altar shall inscribe their names in cinnabar upon yellow plain silk, bearing it upon their person. In life, they shall receive the contract of immortality; in death, they shall sever the roots of retribution. The Three Officials shall bear witness to their deliverance, and in every rebirth, they shall receive blessings, free from the entanglements of sin.

**Rite of Transmission for the Three Covenants of the Yellow Plain of the Great One Ascending the Altar**

Face east and strike the teeth twenty-four times.

Reverently summon the True Officials of the Five Corpsoreal Deities and the Immortal Qi Functionaries from within your servant’s body, along with the Twenty-Four Qi Functionaries of each: the Direct Envoys of the Great One’s Vajra Primordial Qi, the Divine Communicators, the Five Primordial Qi Functionaries, the Harmonizing Qi Functionaries, the Qi-Directing Functionaries, and the Celestial Functionaries. Also summon the Left Envoys of the Kingly Qi, the Right Envoys of the Balanced Qi, the Yin-Yang Divine Seal Clerks, the Immortal Transformation Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Vajra Wind Courier Station Masters, and the Memorial-Presenting Clerks—twenty-four of each.

Summon the True and Upright Officials of [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village, the Qi-Recording Overseers, the Examiners and Summoners of the Four Lords, and the various Generals and Officers. Also summon the Left and Right Balanced Qi Lords, the Left and Right Capital Inspectors, the Left and Right Enforcers of Balance, the Left and Right Enforcers of the Law, the Nine Qi Lords of the Nine Heavens of the East, the Three Qi Lords of the Three Poles of the South, the Seven Qi Lords of the Seven Conjunctions of the West, the Five Qi Lords of the Five Primordials of the North, the One Qi Lord of the Center, the Twenty-Four Qi of the Yangping and Lutang Abbeys, the Thirty-Six Quiet Chambers, the Generals and Officers under the Celestial Master’s command, the Officials of the Two Mysteries, Three Primordials, Four Beginnings, Five Powers, Six Harmonies, and Jiazi, the Lords of the Flying Immortals of the Eight Extremities of the Cosmos, the Lords of Nourishing Nature and Longevity, the Azure Dragon and Victorious Serpent Lords, and all others charged with executing this document.

Your servant, acting on behalf of the male and female people, Daoist [name] of the Great One, having completed the Vajra Contract, or having ascended the altar for the Three Covenants of the Yellow Plain, now presents this memorial with one bow, placing the revealed memorial upon the jade table in the central courtyard. The Functionary Envoys, Generals, Officers, and Soldiers are requested to examine this matter. Should the verification of [name] and the conjoined qi of the guarantors be confirmed, summon those required to fulfill their duties. Once the task is accomplished, your servant shall present a memorial to report the completion, after which all shall return to their respective abodes. Awaiting the efficacious response, your servant prostrates himself before the memorial.

**Right: Memorial for the Transmission of the Vajra Completion Contract**
**Oral Memorial for the Transmission of the Great Contract of the Three Covenants of the Great One**

The male and female officials [names] of [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village, aged [number] years, styled [name], household under the mastership of [name], and the male and female officials of [name] Abbey—all of virtuous and benevolent nature, inherently gentle and refined, having cultivated qi for years, aligned themselves with the secret gates, and delved into the essentials of the true teachings—have ascended the path. Having received the Vajra Contract of the Great One, they now comprehend the secrets of the Three Qi and the Flying Immortals. Though they possess numerous contracts, they have yet to ascend the altar for the great covenant of life and death. Now, in true sincerity, they bind their bodies and pledge their bones, beseeching your servant to transmit the Great Contract of the Three Covenants of the Great One Ascending the Altar, the True and Luminous Great Taboo, the Three Hundred and Sixty Diagram Titles, and the One Thousand Two Hundred Oral Instructions, in accordance with the original methods of the former masters. Respectfully submitted.

Your servant, [name], of the qi-administering governance of Celestial Master [name] of [specific] Abbey, bows twice and reverently addresses the Most High Primordial Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Great One Emperor Lord, the August Heavenly Thearch, the Primordial Lord of the Primordial Ultimate, the Venerable Ones of the Dao and Virtue, the Three Heavens’ Dharma Masters, the Orthodox Unity Perfected Ones, and the Executors under the Flying Immortal Lords:

Your servant, having encountered the celestial communion of destiny and aligned with the Mysterious Teachings, bears the mandate to propagate the Dharma and transform the world. Searching for those of the Dao, I traverse the realms to deliver and elevate both celestial and mortal beings. Now, by virtue of karmic conditions from former lives, emerging from the Void Primordial, [name], male or female official of [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village, aged [number] years, has long been steeped in the Mysterious Teachings, mastering the true texts, receiving numerous contracts, and cultivating the true and secret practices. Though possessing the superior methods, they have yet to break the primordial oath. Now, they gather in earnest, binding their bodies and pledging their bones, beseeching your servant to transmit the Great Contract of the Three Covenants of the Great One Ascending the Altar, the Yellow Plain’s Witnessed Oath for Life and Death, and the Dao of Transcendence.

Formerly, your servant received the covenant from the Great Cavern Perfected [name], charged with transmitting to worthy successors. Having observed [names]’s sincere devotion to the Dao and their potential for accomplishment, on the [specific] day of the [specific] month at [specific] mountain, we jointly established the yellow altar, witnessed the oath by the Five Thearchs, divided the talismans, broke the contracts, and pledged before Heaven and Earth. The secret instructions were transmitted, and the oral instructions were imparted.

Respectfully, I first present this revealed memorial at [specific] prefecture, commandery, county, and village to the Celestial Bureaus. May the Great One Emperor Lord and the August Great Dao deign to observe and examine: if [names] possess the requisite bone structure, they shall be transmitted the Mysterious Capital’s methods in accordance with the Dharma. If they lack the bone structure, may they be verified and corrected, their names recorded in the Jade Registers of the Upper Heavens, and enrolled among the Celestial Immortals. On the [specific] day and hour, an auspicious time, at the sacred mountain, upon the yellow altar, we shall bow and pledge before Heaven and Earth, transmitting the Supreme and Mysterious Dao of the Primordial One, the great covenant of life and death, and the attainment of immortality in both life and death.

Respectfully submitted, awaiting the efficacious response. Your servant [name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows twice and presents this memorial.

Your servant [surname],
Before the August Great Dao, the Primordial Lord of the Three Heavens, the Great One Emperor Lord, and the Jade Emperor of the Grand Clarity,
In the [regnal year] of the Great Year.

To the Right, the Memorial:

With utmost reverence, this memorial is respectfully submitted by the Five-Body Immortal Officials, the mounted generals, the flying ministers, and the ascending servants. Presented to the Jade Chamber beneath the Supreme Left Lord, it is to be delivered to the Jade Maidens of the Fragrant Waist, and the like. Should any errors, omissions, or deviations from the ancient methods be found in their words, may they be examined and corrected according to the original scriptures. If any violate or intercept official documents, may the immortal officials, mounted generals, and divine riders seize and deliver them to the local prisons, where they shall be punished according to the offense. May the matters herein submitted be conveyed upward, and may a response be awaited in due course. Once the matters presented are concluded, may the immortal officials, officers, and soldiers depart, each returning to their palaces, governing the Five Palaces and Six Treasuries, resuming their posts and duties. On the appointed day, they shall be summoned forth again. Beat the drum twice, sound the three qi-chants, and conclude.

**Ritual for the Transmission of the Three Covenants of the Great One**

Face east and strike the teeth twenty-four times. Reverently summon forth the divine immortals within the servant’s body: the Directing Envoy of the Orthodox Unity Divine Officials, the Functionaries of Yin and Yang, the Radiant Light Envoys of Qi-Circulation, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Clerks of the Qi-Chariot, the Scarlet Talisman Clerks, the Courier Riders of the Steadfast Wind, the Flying Dragon Riders, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Scarlet Flying Immortal Youths—twenty-four of each. Let those who emerge be clad in solemn attire, arrayed in full regalia. Reverently notify the True Officials of Qi-Registration in such-and-such prefecture, county, and village; the Inspecting and Summoning Four Lords and their officers; the local deities of the communities and hamlets; the Earth Spirits; the supervisory divine immortals of the eight directions; and all officials in their true ranks, bound by the indissoluble contract of the Heavenly Master, the Great One’s Qi, the Boundless Vajra, and the Golden Tablet. The Master of the Sacred Peak, your servant [name], bows twice and respectfully memorializes the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao; the Lords and Elders; the Great One Emperor Lord; the Heavenly Emperor Lord; the August Great Dao; the Heavenly Master; the Three Masters; the Great One Divine Immortals; the True Statutes of the Jade Registers; the Envoys of Transmission Rituals; and the Directors of Flying Immortal Affairs.

Your servant, through ten thousand kalpas of karmic affinity, has fortuitously encountered the Great Law. By fortunate circumstance, I met the Great Cavern Dharma Master, the Perfected One [name], who transmitted to me the Great Covenant of the Altar, the oaths of life and death, the Dao of ascension, the essential secrets of the Mysterious Origin, and the contracts of the host of Perfected Ones. By the good fortune of past lives’ awakened nature, I have received the Dharma for many years. Though I have yet to perceive the hidden or witness the unseen, to sit in stillness or stand in dissolution, I humbly hope for the descent of the Mysterious, that I may bear its statutes in my person. In accordance with the statutes, I transmit it to worthy successors.

In such-and-such prefecture, county, and village, [name], aged [number] years, previously received the Yellow Register Covenant and was commanded to uphold the Five Vajra Covenants. Having cultivated qi for many years and mastered the disciplines, he now presents his credentials and sincerity, seeking to receive the Great Secrets of the Three Covenants of the Altar. Witnessing the original methods of my former master, I, together with [name], establish the altar, invoke the Five Emperors as witnesses, divide the gold, break the tablets, and proclaim the cinnabar oath. After [name] receives the Dao, may it forever be his personal treasure. He must not undermine his roots or sever his foundation, revile his master or slander the Dao, reveal essential secrets to the unworthy, or disseminate sacred texts among the worldly. Should he violate this even once, his parents in life and death shall sink into eternal damnation, their sins irredeemable for ten thousand kalpas. Respectfully submitted for your consideration and enactment. Your servant [name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows twice.

**Next: Reading of the Tablet**
Read the Yellow Covenant.

**Next: Drawing the One**
Draw the One: with the left hand pointing to Heaven, the right hand drawing on Earth, then the left hand pointing to the Center. The master then declares:
*"Bound by the Heavenly Master of such-and-such district, [name], from the Great Cavern disciple [name], I transmit the Altar Covenant Tablet of the Great One. Now, in accordance with the Dharma, I transmit it to the disciple [name], who receives this covenant. He shall abide by the great oath of the Perfected Master’s altar, never undermining his roots or severing his foundation, reviling his master or slandering the Dao, or revealing the sacred covenant. Should he violate this even once, he shall perish and bear the guilt, sinking into eternal damnation. Above, he invokes the numinous spirits of Heaven; below, he invokes the deities of Earth; and in the center, he swears before the worthy. The Three Numinous Covenants bear witness, and none shall betray their pledge. Together, we draw the One as a token."*

**Next: Tying the Hair**
Make the first knot, declaring: *"The Heaven of Pure Tenuity."*
Make the second knot, declaring: *"The Heaven of Vast Surplus."*
Make the third knot, declaring: *"The Heaven of Great Redness."*
*"By the true emperors of the Three Heavens above, we swear anew, tying our hair at the altar of the covenant, never to betray the sacred pact."*

**Next: Inscribing the Register**
Declare: *"The Great One of the Mysterious Elder, the Barrier Gate."*
Inscribe the center, declaring: *"The Great Supreme Gate of the Great One, the Stone Gate."*

**Next: The Disciple’s Oath over the Cinnabar Water**
*"The male/female Daoist of the Great One, [name], of such-and-such prefecture, county, and village, dares to proclaim to the Cinnabar Water: I, [name], delight in the immortals and revere the sacred, and have come to the Boundless Daoist of the Great One, [name], to receive the Great Tablet of the Three Covenants of the Altar, the Luminous True Great Name, the three hundred sixty diagrams, and the one thousand two hundred oral secrets. As a disciple, I must not betray the master’s Dao, recklessly transmit it to the worldly, or violate the covenant, lest my clan be overthrown and I perish for breaking my oath. Together, we swear by the Cinnabar Water, pointing to Heaven and drawing on Earth to invoke the divine spirits. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!"*

**Next: The Master’s Command over the Cinnabar Water**
*"The Boundless Daoist of the Great One, [name], dares to proclaim to the Cinnabar Water: In such-and-such prefecture, county, and village, [name] seeks to receive from me the secrets of the Great Tablet of the Three Covenants of the Altar and the Luminous True Great Name. May the myriad divine spirits monitor [name] as a disciple, that he never betray the covenant. Above, the Three Heavens and the Venerable Lord Lao bear witness. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!"*

**Next: Holding the Cinnabar Water**
The master holds the Cinnabar Water with his left hand, the disciple with his right, and together they sip it three times, the disciple first, then the master.

**Ritual of the Offering Altar**
Prepare five offering trays and five incense burners, with five portions of dates, and face east to sacrifice to the Five Emperors.
Prepare nine offering trays and nine incense burners, with nine portions of dates, and face east to sacrifice to the Nine Lords of the Great One.

*"The Perfected One of the Boundless Great One, the Heavenly Master of such-and-such district, your servant [name], respectfully presents this offering to the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Qi Emperor of the North, the Yellow Emperor of the Center, the Great One Emperor Lord, the August Great Dao, and the Jade Emperor of the Grand Clarity. With nine billion myriad riders, they shake Heaven and move Earth, descending upon this sacred peak and imperial altar to partake of this humble offering. May their numinous presence deign to grace the world, and in their compassion for the transgressions and shortcomings of living beings, I humbly beseech their forgiveness and pardon. I bow twice."*

Next, the recipient of the contract shall first perform five bows. Then, the master shall present the contract to the disciple with his left hand, and the disciple shall receive it with his left hand. After circumambulating the body three times, he shall face east and bow nine times in three sets. Then, he shall face north and bow nine times. He shall bow three times in three sets to the Lord of the Great One, and then bow nine times to the master. Next, both shall rise, and at the earthly gate, they shall point to heaven and trace upon the earth, circling left three times and right to summon the seven generations of the disciple’s ancestors as witnesses, as fully prescribed.

**Next, the Rite of the Weighty Kalpa:**
Respectfully, from within this servant’s body, the five bodily Perfected Officials and Attendants emerge—two hundred forty Attendants of the Great One’s Vajra Longevity, two hundred forty Attendants of the Great One’s Kalpa-Transcending, two hundred forty Attendants of the Great One’s Life-Prolonging, two hundred forty Jade Maidens of the Great One’s Azure Waist, two hundred forty Jade Maidens of the Great One’s Ehuang, two hundred forty Generals and Attendants of the Five Venerable Lords, two hundred forty Attendants of Eternal Longevity, two hundred forty Generals and Attendants each of the Eastern Nine Yi, Southern Eight Man, Western Six Rong, Northern Five Di, and Central Three Qin, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descending from the canopy of heaven, Attendants and couriers of the刚风骑驿马上章, each two hundred forty in number. Now, to bestow upon [name] the Great Secret of the Three Pacts of the Great One’s Ascent to the Altar and the Register of Illuminated Perfection, or the Vajra Single-Word Secret—upon [name]’s reception of the Dao, may he attain longevity and enduring vision, robed in the same vestments as the immortals and sages, bearing the sacred vessel as an equal. May his spirit shine without seeking, and may divine elixirs, golden liquors, numinous mushrooms, and myriad herbs refine his form. May the thousand Dao and ten thousand spirits serve him in sitting, rising, walking, and resting. May the Great Yang stand to his left and the Great Yin to his right, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger flanking him, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior guarding front and rear. May celestial spirits descend and earthly spirits emerge, the Five Venerable Spirit Lords expunging [name]’s name from the register of death, inscribing it in azure script on yellow tablets, and elevating his seven generations of ancestors to the Southern Palace of Rebirth. May his entire household enjoy eternal extension. Should [name] violate this pact even once, may he be punished by the stones of Mount Meng, his bones filling the Three Rivers, forever bound as a lowly ghost and eternal prisoner of the earth. All shall be as the contract decrees, in accordance with the commands of the Most High Lord Lao, the Host of Venerable Ones of the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Five Qi of Virtue and Power, the Lord of Myriad Lives, Myriad Salvations, and Myriad Blessings, the Heavenly Worthy, the Newly Manifest Lord Lao of the Supreme Clarity, the Primordial Elder of the Three Heavens of the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of the Three Qi, the Heavenly Emperor, and the Five Qi of the Celestial Mandate.

**From the Terrace of Grand Mystery, the Orthodox Unity, the Master of Balanced Qi, the Celestial Master of such-and-such district, the Great One Daoist, the remote descendant of the Most High, this humble servant [name] bows twice and respectfully declares:**

In accordance with the scriptures, we, your servants, are but withered bones and crawling insects, yet our descendants for a thousand generations have been fortunate to dwell within the gates of the Dao. By the great grace bestowed upon us, despite our dullness and folly, we have cherished the methods of life. We have been favored by our venerable masters, who granted us the contracts and commands of the Great One. Though our merits are meager, we aspire to the lofty Perfected Ones. On this day of such-and-such month, together with our fellow disciples [names], we approach the Central Palace of the Boundless Great One, the Daoist abbey of such-and-such district, in such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, to receive the Supreme Pacts of the Great One’s Ascent to the Three Heavens, the Three Oaths of Life and Death, and the Register of the Altar. First, to deliver the suffering souls of our seven generations of parents from the dark realms, and next, to ascend and deliver the transgressions of life and death for [names], their rotting bones and exposed flesh. Though we have rendered no slight service, we have been granted mountains of favor—gifts beyond the worth of your servants’ foolishness. Overwhelmed by this profound grace, we prostrate ourselves and present this petition in gratitude.

We humbly pray that the attending officials will take pity on us and inscribe our names in the Jade Register of the Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Capital, that we may be counted among the seed-people of the immortals. We respectfully dispatch the Generals and Attendants of the Three Officials from within our bodies—the Celestial Official’s Examiner, the Terrestrial Official’s Examiner, the Aquatic Official’s Examiner, the Examiners of the Pure Tenuity Heaven, the Jade Clarity Heaven, and the Great Red Heaven—and the Perfected Officials of the four directions in this locale, who oversee the infusion of qi and the scrutiny of all attending Generals and Attendants. We entrust our lives and vital qi to the venerable elders. Having prepared all that is fitting for the wondrous and mysterious Central Mystery Altar upon the mountain’s peak, beneath the Great Yang, we prostrate ourselves and present this vermilion petition to the Most Supreme Great One’s presence.

Together with your servants [names], we make this solemn declaration to the august spirits above and point to the earthly deities below. Presumptuously, we transmit this grace, having received the favor of the Illuminated Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Ultimate, whose radiance infuses us with qi. We respectfully invite the Perfected Immortals of the Boundless and Natural, the Primordial Heavenly Emperor and the Supreme Primordial Lord, bearing their names and titles, leading their retinues of chariots and riders, the Five Stars and Five Emperors, the Nine Palaces and Five Marchmounts, the Four Seas, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Three Rivers and Nine Jiang, the divine armies of immortals, the Great One’s chariot of the single shaft, the horses of the Boundless before, and the true spirit and essence behind. May they attend the Five Emperors’ presence, the immortals’ chariots and riders flanking left and right, banishing all inauspicious omens before and all calamities behind. May the Jade Armillary revolve above our heads and the Northern Dipper tread beneath our feet. May the sun, moon, and Five Stars lead before and follow behind, shaking heaven and moving earth as they descend in perfect order to left and right. Together with your servants [names], may we be received in the Palace of the Three Primordials, becoming lords of the divine immortals and emperors. May the life-giving qi of the Three Heavens be extended to us, the divine elixirs of the Great One, the golden liquors and jade nectars entering the eighty-one palaces and twelve spirit chambers of our bodies, the Four Inflows of the Great Mystery. May the five spirits and essence of the Great One, the five qi as adornments, the three elixirs of the Nine Origins, refine our lives and reverse death, ascending to the morning’s zenith. May they infuse the Mysterious Palace, soaring over the Five Marchmounts, rising high and drifting aloft, their radiance illuminating the Golden Gates, their phoenix-like ascent to the Purple Court. May the immortal Dao swiftly be accomplished, feathers sprouting in due time. May we roam the eight wilds, play upon the eight terraces, traverse Hua and Huo, and be granted the cinnabar essence, the ninefold numinous convergence. May our seven generations of ancestors ascend and be delivered, their souls entering the homeland of the Dao, the halls of leisure and joy, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally.

For all who share this pact, when the day of reckoning arrives, we shall rescue and deliver one another, with the deliverance of our masters as our foremost duty, followed by our fellow initiates. From this day forward, we dare not betray the words of the Three Pacts. We shall revere our masters and hold goodness as our priority. For past sins and transgressions against the pact, we humbly beseech forgiveness and pardon.

We humbly invoke the boundless grace of the Supreme Venerable Dao, the Most High Mysterious Ancient, the Three Qi Heavenly Emperor Lord. Through the direct envoys of the Two Bureaus, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Upper Right Bureau Messengers, the yin-yang divine writ officials, the chariot-bearing vermilion talisman officers, the刚风 courier post riders, and the memorial-presenting officials—each pair in their station—we, your servants, having received the Three Pacts of the Great One, now prostrate ourselves for three days to offer this petition of gratitude. One scroll of thanksgiving is hereby submitted to the Celestial Bureaus, awaiting your decree. With utmost reverence and awe, we bow our heads and kowtow twice.

*Memorial of Thanksgiving after Three Days.*

**The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles: Texts and Precepts for Liberation**
*Composed by the Assembly of the Ten Thousand Immortals*

To receive the thirty-six sacred scriptures of the Numinous Treasure without submitting a *huian* is to remain barred from transmission for ten thousand kalpas. Once the *huian* is submitted but the Three Pacts of the Great One—the Golden Perfection of the Altar’s Threefold Alliance—are not fulfilled, the Seven Mysteries shall not depart from Dengdu. How then may one presume to take disciples? Only upon completing the Three Pacts do the Seven Mysteries transcend; life and death become as one with the immortals. Then the *huian* is conferred, and one is ordained as a Master of the Cavernous Mystery.

Should the seven generations of ancestors remain unredeemed or the Three Pacts be broken, to lightly bestow the *huian* is to incur the sins of leaking scriptures and profaning the sacred. By the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, one shall suffer the trial of the Wind Blade; by the Three Pacts’ covenant, the living and the dead shall be liberated, their names inscribed in the heavens. Thus is one ordained as a Master of the Numinous Treasure.

To receive the scriptures of the Numinous Treasure’s liberation without manifesting it to one’s master is to leave the register of death unbroken and one’s name absent from the Jade Texts. Though one may hold the sacred scriptures, they shall never be transmitted, and the Great Dao shall remain sealed—bringing only harm to oneself. Upon completing the transmission, one becomes a conduit of liberation, manifest above in the heavens and recorded below upon the earth. One’s name resounds among the perfected as a master; by the upper pact with the Five Emperors, one is a Master of the Cavernous Mystery. Without such merit, to lightly initiate disciples is to incur the sins of reckless transmission and error. The master shall suffer the Wind Blade, bound for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Let future generations heed these words and not treat them lightly, lest they be ensnared in the net of transgression, sinking into eternal damnation without pardon. Judgment falls under the Four Poles Bureau.

In times of urgent peril or affliction, call upon the name of the Great One. Grasp the Dao Father with your left hand, then raise your head and thrice invoke the name of the Boundless Great One. Say: *"I now face dire straits—pass me through fire and water, beneath the white blade, and deliver me within nine breaths."* Know the Dao as divine; know the Dao as true. Turn left, look back twice.

**Nine Harmonies Incense Method:**
When burned, its fragrance reaches nine *li*, moving the spirits and gods. The ingredients are:
- One *jin* of aloeswood,
- Three *liang* of *qingmu* incense,
- Three *liang* of *jia* incense,
- One *jin* of frankincense,
- Three *liang* of *zhantang* incense,
- One *jin* of *xie* incense,
- One *jin* of *qingjian* incense,
- One *jin* of *quetou* incense,
- Twenty dried *daqian* jujubes.

Grind each of the nine ingredients separately, then blend with white honey until thoroughly combined. Seal in a vessel for three nights; after three days, the incense is ready. Its fragrance carries nine *li*. This method is secret and must not be recklessly transmitted. To summon the gods or compound elixirs, burn it, portioning small amounts into separate containers to prevent the *qi* from dissipating. This is the ancient *Nine Harmonies* incense.

Here ends the *Orthodox Unity Scriptures, Ritual Registers, and Liturgical Texts*.
