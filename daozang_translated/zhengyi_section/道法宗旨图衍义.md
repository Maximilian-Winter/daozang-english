**Preface to *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings***

*"Nurturing the Way"* unites the Three Families as one—though the Dao/Way cannot be depicted, if one seeks its essence, the Dao/Way is not distant from mortals; it is attainable through personal cultivation. It is not a matter of guessing the key or hearing the bell to mark the day. Let scholars strive earnestly.

In the second year of *Zhidà* (Great Virtue), the thirty-eighth Patriarch of the Celestial Masters, Guangwei Zi, inscribed this work.

The Dao/Way says: *"I do not know its name; forcefully named, it is called Dao/Way."* Since the Dao/Way has no name, how can it be described? If one seeks its essence, even eight thousand volumes would not be excessive.

Iron Cliff Master Deng lamented the Dao/Way’s decline and pitied the common folk’s superficial understanding. He compiled all its symbols into *Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated*.

Ah! How vast his heart was!

When the *Longhu* (Dragon Tiger) edition was published, reading it was like gazing into the boundless expanse.

The Hopeful Sage (Zhang Xi’an) did not shame the common or the wise—he had long aspired to elucidate the subtle teachings of the Three Families. Later, through inquiry and reflection, as if awakened from a distant void, he fulfilled his original intent.

Moreover, since the dawn of antiquity, the true essence has not been revealed, though its symbols exist. Yet its nature and alignment with the cosmic Dao/Way remain beyond mortal comprehension. As Master Su said: *"The Dao/Way cannot be spoken of; all that can be spoken of are mere semblances."* This book is also such a semblance.

Thus, the enlightened discern the true essence through its semblances, while the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into deception. I hope those who share my aspiration will likewise recognize the true through the semblances.

Those who seek to illuminate the Dao/Way need not examine this work. But to gaze at empty flowers or grasp at reflections in water—this is not my wish.

On the *Jǐhài* (Great Virtue) day of the second year of *Zhidà*, Zhang Xi’an of Linchuan inscribed this at the Nurturing the Way Hall.

The Dao/Way is vast and boundless; its subtleties are profound and replete with mystery. Hence, the Dao/Way is expounded through its laws, the laws are illustrated through images, the images are revealed through visions, the visions are rendered in the mysterious, and the mysterious is further refined—emptiness and marvelousness permeate the One.

Zhang Jun of Nurturing the Way, beyond the confines of secular governance, amidst the realms of misty peaks and flowing waters, renews himself through harmony with nature, ever-transforming without limit. Is this not the work of the creative Dao/Way itself, its merit and practice manifesting thus?

Now, to compose this preface, I have taken from the Daoist Canon a single resolution, to verify and praise the sublime mysteries of the high Dao/Way.

In autumn of the year *Jiāchén* (Jia Chen), Xūngxuán Zi (Empty Mysteries) respectfully inscribed this.

*Xūngxuán Zi* is of the Wang clan, given name *Wànqǐng*, courtesy name *Qīngbó*, a native of Linchuan. Born into a noble household, he took the Daoist path as a *Huángguān* (Yellow Crown), adopting the title *Yàoshān* (Herb Mountain). He consorted with Dao Mountain Master Xu Shùnsūn, traversing sacred peaks, and eventually retired into seclusion beneath the woods.

Sometimes he sat atop towering pines, sometimes in modest chambers, while others secretly observed him murmuring to himself—when they left, he ceased. Others sought his writings, and he would speak at length or concisely, yet compose a thousand words in an instant.

During the era of *Zhidà*, Dao Mountain Master Xu passed away at the *Longxīng Xiāoshè* (Dragon’s Rest Hermitage) on the 14th day of the 11th month of the year *Dàwùshēn*. His disciples, when summoned by his portrait, composed an elegy and departed. He then revived, sat upright, and wrote: *"Residing in Herb Mountain’s generosity, emulating the lofty spirit of Dao Mountain."* Such was his Dao/Way.

At the *Língyān* (Nebulous Chamber) records, this was not the true account—his Dao/Way was within himself, a single breath of wind and moon. He cast aside his brush and laughed heartily before departing again.

In autumn of the year *Zìshùn Gēngwǔ* (Cultivating Virtue Geng Wu), Zhang Línshū of Linchuan said: *"A humble servant entered Fujian and saw him."* Cai Zhìfū of *Shàowǔ* (Shao Wu) also said: *"A traveler in straw hat and gourd bag spoke of encountering him in Wuyi."*

Niè Jìng’ān of *Jiāhé* (Jia He) said: *"The Dragon Tiger saw the golden *Tuó* (Dharma) head and inquired of him, saying that he would soon appear in Wuyi."*

Hence, Mencius said: *"Where he passes, transformation occurs; where he dwells, the divine manifests."* This is the very Dao/Way.

Ah! Who but a great man could attain this?

Zhang Xi’an, who studied in Linchuan, elaborated.

**Dao/Way Law Essentials Illustrated with Extended Meanings – Volume One**

**Illustrations of the Primordial Dao/Way of the Original Ancestor**

The Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way (*Yuánshǐ Zǔjié*) gave birth to all the celestial realms. He illuminated the Three Landscapes (*Sǎnjǐng*), which became the celestial foundation (*Tiāngēn*). Extended Meanings:

The *Taishang Dùrén Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Sage on Deliverance) states: *"The Original Ancestor of the Primordial Dao/Way gave birth to all the celestial realms, illuminated the Three Landscapes, which became the celestial foundation—above him, there was no further ancestor, only the Dao/Way as his form."*

The Daoist texts say: *"One *qi* divided into three *qi*; the three *qi* each formed a palace."* At the dawn of the *Longhàn* (Dragon Han) era, the *Xuánqì* (Mysterious *qi*) coalesced into the *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Chīmíng* (Vermilion Brightness) era, the *Yuánqì* (Primordial *qi*) coalesced into the *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) Palace. At the dawn of the *Shànghuáng* (Supreme Sovereign) era, the *Shǐqì* (Original *qi*) coalesced into the *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) Palace.

The *Yùqīng* (Jade Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Saints (*Jiǔshèng*) dwell. The *Shàngqīng* (Upper Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Worthies (*Jiǔzhēn*) reside. The *Tàiqīng* (Great Purity) governs twelve heavens, where the Nine Immortals (*Jiǔxiān*) abide. The three heavens governed by the Three Purity realms, comprising thirty-six heavens, are called the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven). These thirty-six heavens are distributed across the Four Extremities (*Sìjí*), each extremity containing nine heavens.

Below the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) lies the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven). In total, there are four such heavens, and they are categorized into four kinds of celestial beings and heavens.

Above the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) is the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven), and above the *Dàluó Tiān* (Great Naked Heaven) are the Three Purity realms. These celestial realms are all from prior *jié* (kalpas/epochs) where beings cultivated the true essence (*xiūzhēn*). When they merged with the Dao/Way in truth, they gathered to form shape and dispersed to become *qi*—naturally merging and dispersing without fixed form or appearance, spanning countless *jié* (kalpas/epochs), never falling back or degenerating.

Below the *Dàfàn Tiān* (Great Dharma Heaven) lies the *Wúsè Jiè* (Formless Realm), beneath which is the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm), and beneath the *Sè Jiè* (Form Realm) is the *Yù Jiè* (Desire Realm). The Desire Realm contains six heavens; the Form Realm contains eighteen heavens; the Formless Realm contains four heavens—totaling twenty-eight heavens in the Three Realms (*Sānjiè*).

Humans who accumulate virtuous deeds may be reborn in the Desire Realm heavens, becoming either celestial sovereigns (*Tiānzhǔ*), celestial beings (*Tiānrén*), or celestial multitudes (*Tiānzhòng).*

The beings of the Desire Realm still harbor desires and thoughts; without desires and thoughts, they ascend to the Form Realm. The beings of the Form Realm still cling to colored perceptions; without colored perceptions, they ascend to the Formless Realm. The beings of the Formless Realm still retain the thought of awareness; without the thought of awareness, they ascend to the Great Dharma Heaven, thus emerging beyond the Three Realms.

The twenty-eight heavens of the Three Realms dwell in the four directions, each direction containing seven heavens—known as the **Eight Circles** (*Bāyuán*), also called the **Four Great Brahmā Small Rāga Heavens** (*Sìfàn Xiǎoluó Tiān*).

Mere mortals with virtuous deeds and high merit may ascend to the Three Realms’ heavens but remain there. When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they no longer cultivate virtue, they fall back and degenerate, hence the varying lifespans of each.

Within the **Six Paths** (*Liùdào*), the **Path of Heaven** (*Tiāndào*) refers to these Three Realms’ heavens. The beings of the Three Realms’ heavens—should even a single thought stray from truth—descend from higher immortals to lower ones, and if lower immortals fail to progress further, they return to the human path, known as **degeneration** (*Tuìduò*).

Before the **空洞** (*Kōngdòng*, Void of Emptiness), the *qi* mother was in chaotic unity—unforced, it is **truth** (*zhēn*); undual, it is **refinement** (*jīng*); unobscured, it is **awareness** (*jué*); unmeasurable, it is **divinity** (*shén*).

Who is pure, who is turbid? Who is mundane, who is sage? Who is short-lived, who is long? Who is demonic, who is orthodox? The lightest *qi* gives rise to the heavy, and the heavy forms the light; thus, the high and low take shape. The lower ascends, the higher descends, as water and fire transmit essence—so there are sun and moon, and day and night govern the light.

One and two form the sovereign; three *qi* refine into subtle *qi* (*wéi*), three subtle *qi* coalesce into the **Three Augments** (*Sānhòu*), and three augments establish the **Three Festivals** (*Sānjié*). The Great Bright culminates in the beginning, and five and six cycle eternally. The sun moves from the left, while the stars align from the right, circulating through the **Six Void Points** (*Liùxū*). Thus, new phases arise, yielding and firmness alternate, and the **Three Powers** (*Sāncái*) are firmly set.

In the boundless void, the **Three Pure Ones** (*Sānqīng*) dwell. None know its origin, yet they name it **Primordial** (*yuán*). None know its beginning, yet they call it **First** (*shǐ*). None know its vastness, yet they term it **Great** (*tài*). None know its summit, yet they label it **Highest** (*shàng*). Lofty yet without end, it is called **Venerable** (*zūn*). Hosting yet without self, it is called **Lord** (*jūn*).

It can be empty or full, singular or myriad. It manifests all heavens, completes all worlds. Within it lies the **Mystic Mountain** (*Miàoshān*), called **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*). The four directions are established, the eight directions divided, and the **Thirty-Two Sovereigns** (*Sānshíèr Dì*) reside in the jeweled palaces.

The **Big Dipper** (*Dǒu*), **Net** (*Jī*), **Horn** (*Jié*), and **Weighing Scale** (*Gé*) align; the **Well** (*Jǐng*), **Parameter** (*Shēn*), **Pivot** (*Kuí*), and **Wall** (*Bì*) form constellations; the **Vanguard** (*Kuí*) upholds the **Pole** (*Gāng*), and the **Five Convergences** (*Wǔhé*) create celestial motion. The finest hairs and smallest particles flow with the Dao, boundless in their vastness. The **Effulgent Minor** (*Tàishǎo*) fills the void, and the **Great Void** (*Hún*) is sealed.

When the **perverse *qi*** (*xiéqì*) loses its origin, it scatters into all living beings. Through their **nine orifices** (*jiǔqiào*), emotions and cognition arise. Emotions flow, cognition obscures, and beings twist and turn in confusion. From this flow, **attachment** (*ài*) arises; obscured by attachment, **aversion** (*zēng*) takes form. Aversion and attachment clash, one surges forward while the other lingers behind. Abandoning clarity for darkness, they accumulate darkness into **yin** (*yīn*). Yin congeals into **obscurity** (*yōu*), and entering obscurity, they become **ghosts** (*guǐ*). Extending into human form, branching into other paths—devouring, oppressing, and dominating one another in strength. Their nature cannot be stilled, and their lifespan cannot be prolonged.

The **Black *qi*** (*hēiqì*) darkens like a shroud, defiling the celestial heights. The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Three Heavenly Sovereigns** (*Sāntiān Dìjūn*), survey from below, and in a single moment of compassion, the **subtle *qi* of mercy** (*miàoshén*) naturally weaves into patterns. The **Spirit Wind** (*Língfēng*) stirs and plays, forming sounds of its own. With boundless compassion, they deliver from suffering; with boundless benevolence, they cherish life. With boundless orthodoxy, they crush evil; with boundless clarity, they break through darkness.

Above, they arrange the **palaces and offices** (*gōngcáo*); below, they establish the **mountains and altars** (*yuèdú*). The **multitude of immortals** (*Zhōngzhēn*) divide their duties, and the **ranked sages** (*Lièxiān*) manage their affairs. When the **true mechanism** (*zhēnjī*) leaks, the **Jade Scriptures** (*Yùzì*) emerge. Fire refines the **Sun Cavern** (*Dòngyáng*), and the pen records the **Void Blue** (*Kōngqīng*). The **Jade Registers** (*Yùjiǎn*) and **Golden Tablets** (*Jīnbǎn*) inscribe talismans and spells, teaching the **myriad immortals** (*Zhōngxiān*) while commanding the **demonic hosts** (*móqún*). They purify and refine **souls and spirits** (*húnpò*), and summon the **ten thousand spirits** (*wànlíng*).

The **Mixed Primordial Transformation** (*Húnyuán Huàshēn*)—Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty’s inscription reads:
*"Great is the Supreme Dao! Effortless, natural.
From kalpa’s end to its beginning, it precedes earth and heaven.
Encompassing light in silent stillness, it endures through endless kalpas.
In the East, it is taught by Confucius; in the West, it appears as the Golden Sage.
All hundred kings take its principles, and all successive sages transmit its mysteries.
It is the origin of all teachings, the deepest of the profound."*

The **Praise of Preceptor Yán Rúrú** (*Rúrú Yán Jūshì Yùlù*) says:
*"Life begins with no origin, and generations follow the Zhou kings.
Its transformed body reappears, and Śākyamuni pays homage,
still hearing the Master’s voice—
the teacher of the eighty-one thousand heavens,
the guide of countless kalpas."*

The **Tàixuān Jīng** (*Tàixuān Jīng*) states:
*"The Supreme Old Lord possesses myriad transformed bodies,
setting teachings according to regions,
establishing names by divine opportunity,
universally saving all beings—
each day descending its traces,
each age as the sovereign teacher."*

The **Wise Scholar** (*Xīxián*) cites the *Lotus Sutra* (*Fǎhuá Jīng*):
*"All Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
appear in the world solely for one great matter—
the cause and condition of dharma.
They share the same Dao."*

The *Family Sayings* (*Jiālǔ*) record:
*"Confucius told Nángōng Jìngshū:
'I have heard that the Old Guest knows the ancient and the present,
grasps the origins of rites and music,
and clarifies the return of virtue and Dao—
then he is my teacher. I will go to him now.'
Jìngshū accompanied him to the Zhou.
After asking about rites from the Old Sage,
they returned to Lu,
and the Dao became even more revered.
Even from distant lands, the disciples who came
numbered in the thousands.'*

**Ge Xianshū** (*Gě Xiānshū*)’s preface to the *Daodejing* (*Dàodé Jīng*) says:
*"The Old Master embodies the effortless naturalness of the Dao,
born before the Great Primordial,
arising from no cause,
passing through the end and beginning of heaven and earth,
ineffable and beyond description,
ending without end,
exhausting the boundless,
reaching the limitless—
thus, it is the **Limitless** (*Wújí*).'*

**Master Shāng of the Song Mountain School** (*Shāng Shānxiānshì*) in *Zhēngjīn Jí* (*Zhēngjīn Jí*) writes:
*"What the Old Master speaks of is the Great Dao.
Thus, Confucius on rites says:
'I have heard it from the Old Sage.'
The *Great Rites* (*Lǐyùn*) state:
'The Great Dao’s practice aligns with the heroes of the Three Dynasties.
Though I did not attain it, I aspired to it.'
The *Book of Changes* (*Yì*) says:
'The movement of all under heaven is governed by the **Unchanging One** (*zhēnyī*).'
Yet the *Laozi* (*Lǎozǐ*) says:
'Kings and lords who grasp the One
use it to govern all under heaven.'
Examining the principle of **non-thought, non-action** (*wú sī wú wéi*)
and the theory of **yin-yang transformation** (*yīnyáng biànhuà*),
how can these two texts not both be true?
If one insists the Old Sage is wrong,
then the *Yì* and the *Great Rites* must be burned!"*

The learned scholars of old who delighted in debate—who could surpass Mencius? In Mencius’ time, Laozi’s text had already been in circulation for over a hundred years. Yet Zhuangzi lived contemporaneously with Mencius, and if his ideas could be refuted, then Mencius had already done so. Why wait for later Confucian scholars to argue it?

Sima Qian remarked: "The Dao of Laozi is concise and easy, requiring little effort yet yielding great results." Some Confucians, however, disagreed, criticizing the prioritization of Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings over the Six Classics—this was not his intent. When Sima Qian composed *Records of the Grand Historian*, he gave Confucius a *shìjiā* (biography of his descendants) and Laozi a *lièzhuàn* (separate account). Was this not to honor Laozi? Rather, it was because Laozi’s Dao was the root of Confucianism, and to honor its origin was to exalt its foundation.

The *Records* further states: "The Daoist school makes the spirit unified, its movements harmonizing with the formless, its simplicity sufficient for all things." The *Book of Han* says: "The Daoists grasp the essential and hold fast to the root, maintaining purity and emptiness to preserve themselves, adopting humility and weakness to govern—this is the art of the sovereign ruling from the south-facing seat."

Master Chen of Lingxi’s *Guan Shi Ping* notes: "When Emperor Wu of Han abandoned Yellow Emperor-Laozi teachings in favor of Confucianism, he established the Imperial University, conducted sacrifices, standardized calendars and measurements, harmonized music and poetry, and instituted mountain-altar rituals for the gods. The brilliance of his Confucian governance is evident. Yet with so many troubles in the realm, the ruler’s mind unsettled, his relentless reforms exhausted the people—taxation halved the population, wars burned without cease, and filial piety faltered. Though his edicts claimed to stem from *rén* and *yì*, their effects scarcely differed from those of Qin Shihuang. At such times, the land knew no peace, and the people longed for the return of Wen and Jing. Thus, the Yellow Emperor-Laozi principle of *qīngjìng* (tranquility) was hardly detrimental to the realm.

Our Confucian scholars must insist on *this* being right and *that* wrong. Why not, instead of praising Wu and condemning Wen and Jing, take the best from both?"

Han Yu of Changli’s *Strategic Questions for the Imperial Examination* states: "Confucius too had a teacher—he inquired about rites from Lao Dan. Today’s people fall far short of Confucius’ wisdom, and worse, they have no teacher. Yet if they do not study, how can their scholarship flourish or their virtue be complete?" (From *Collected Works*, Volume 14.)

Master Xie of Die Mountain says: *"The Dao De Jing* reveals the mind of Heaven above, and its teachings have never been without benefit to the world’s order.

The *Rei T’ung Tu* (Diagram of Mutual Thunder) depicts the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang—rising and descending, responding in harmony.

The *Golden Edicts* state: "Heaven and Earth, pure and turbid, in essence like an egg—one thing within the Great Void. Yang ascends to Heaven, generating yin from the *Tàijí*, which embraces yang and descends in obscurity. Yin descends to Earth, generating yang from the *Tàijí*, which carries yin and ascends in hazy form. This rising and descending aligns with Heaven and Earth’s movement, giving rise to all things.

Master Zhou of Lúxī says: "From *wújí* emerges *tàijí*; *tàijí* moves and generates yang. At its peak of motion, it stirs to stillness; at its peak of stillness, it generates yin, then stirs again. This dynamic and static interplay forms their mutual root."

Master Zhu of Huì’ān says: "Yin takes yang as its substance, yang takes yin as its substance. Water is bright within yet dark without; fire is dark within yet bright without." Master Zhang of Hèngqú says: "The essences of yin and yang interpenetrate their domains—this is the very meaning."

*The True Origin* states: "The rising and falling of yin and yang within Heaven and Earth mirror the interplay of heart and kidney in human physiology."

*The Jade Book* says: "Yang bears yin upward, yin embraces yang downward. This rising and falling circulates through the Dao, ensuring Heaven’s longevity and Earth’s endurance."

The *Rei T’ung Tu* serves as the pivot of Heaven—its nature is benevolent, its domain is life, its essence is yang, its form is yin. Thus, *jiǎ* (甲), *gēng* (庚), *rén* (壬) are yang-thunder. It acts as the mechanism of Earth—its nature is malevolent, its domain is destruction, its essence is yin, its form is yang. Thus, *yǐ* (乙), *xīn* (辛), *dīng* (丁), *guǐ* (癸) are yin-thunder.

*Zhuangzi* says: "When yin and yang move askew, Heaven and Earth are shaken—thunder and lightning erupt, fire burns within the waters, and the Great Block is consumed."

*The Huainanzi* states: "When yin and yang clash, they generate thunder; when they clash violently, they produce lightning."

The *Golden Edicts* say: "Within yin, yang is concealed; if yang-qi does not descend, it strikes and produces thunder and lightning."

Master Zhang of Hèngqú says: "When yin-qi condenses, the enclosed yang cannot escape—it erupts as lightning. When yang-qi is trapped within yin-qi and cannot emerge, it explodes as thunder."

Master Hào of Huánxī’s *Jīnghéng Nèipiān* says: "Sacrificial thunder is *zhèn* (shaking)—a fixed principle. Yet why does thunder have sound? It is the four lower trigrams of *lǐ* (fire) interacting, and when *lǐ* is superimposed, it becomes *kǎn* (water). Fire entering water creates a violent, resonant sound—considering smaller things first: when fire forges metal, making it transparent, and it is plunged into water, its clamor is still fierce. How much more so with the vast *qi* of *kǎn* and *lǐ*?

The *Huntian* symbol encompasses Earth, with the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. Its light enters the earth, and when Heaven generates water, water is within the earth. The next host rises again in the east, its light emerging above ground. The sun rises from Fushang, truly ascending from the sea, hence the morning sun’s clarity. When it sets, its sound is thunderous and fierce. Thus, the *Yánzhí Tu* (Diagram of the Setting Sun) strikes drums and gongs to blend with it; otherwise, the young and old would be terrified. This is the proof of fire entering water and producing sound.

Thus, it is known that the angry *qi* of water and fire, when agitated, forms thunder—and how much more so when *kǎn* (water) generates rain and *lǐ* (fire) generates lightning, each reinforcing the other?"

The *Zǐ Zhūzǐ* (Master Zhu’s Sayings) states: "Though thunder is a manifestation of *qi*, wherever there is *qi*, there is form. For instance, the *lièyǎng* (thunderclouds) are originally but thin rain illuminated by the sun to cast shadows, yet they too possess form and can absorb water and wine."

*The Ěryǎ* (Erhya) says: "Swift thunder is called *tíng* (thunderbolt)."

The Diagram of *Sùyào Xuánjī* (Host曜 Mysterious Mechanism) states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: "The celestial *Dao* revolves to the left, while the sun, moon, and five stars traverse the four and seven [regions] in order, forming the celestial *jīngwěi* (warp and weft). Thus, they give rise to and extinguish the four seasons, nurturing all ten thousand things—all through the function of *fàn* (primordial) *qi*, as the eternal *Dao* of Heaven and Earth."

The *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture for Guiding People) declares: "It encompasses the ten directions, revolving the Big Dipper through the *lì* (Arrow) and *jì* (Winnowing Basket), returning to the Five Constants—this is its meaning."

The *Hùnyuán Sānqīng Jīng* (Scripture of the Three Pure Ones of the Primordial Chaos) states: "The *qi* of the *yángjīng* (yang essence) becomes the sun, the *qi* of the *yīnjīng* (yin essence) becomes the moon. The residual *qi* of the sun and moon disperses as stars and constellations, distributed among the Twenty-eight *xiù* (Lunar Mansions)."

The *Huángdì Sùwèn Tàishǐ Tiānyuán Yùcè Wén* (Yellow Emperor’s Plain Questions: The Supreme Origin, Heavenly Elements, and Jade Tablet Text) says:

"The Great Void is vast and boundless,
Its transformation originates the foundation.
All things derive their beginning,
The Five *Phases* (运) complete the heavens.
The *qi* is spread by the True Spirit,
Overseeing the *kūn* (Earthly) root.
Nine stars hang resplendent,
Seven luminaries revolve in cycles.
Yin and yang are named,
Softness and hardness are named.
The hidden and the manifest take their positions,
Cold and heat relax and expand.
Life and transformation, life and transformation—
All things flourish in harmony."

The Diagram of the Three Thunders (雷霆三关图) states:
- *Zhù* (Incantation) is the Heavenly Gate,
- *Què* (Formula) is the Human Gate,
- *Gāng* (Coercive) is the Earthly Gate.

The *Huángtíng Yùjīng* (Scripture of the Yellow Court) says:
"The mouth is the Heavenly Gate of spiritual vitality,
The hands are the Human Gate of grasping fortune’s rise and fall,
The feet are the Earthly Gate of the life-death threshold."

The *xīxián* (worthy sages) say: "Mencius taught: ‘Wherever one passes, there is transformation; wherever one remains, there is spirit.’ The *Dao* texts declare: ‘Though the body dies, the yang spirit endures.’ Lü Dongbin’s *Shī Jiě Fùxiàn Shī* (Poem on the Corpse’s Dissolution and Reappearance) states:
‘Once I left my vermilion robes at the Jade Spring,
Now I visit the Penglai Isles with a new name.’

The Diagram of the Big Dipper’s Handle Circumnavigating Heaven states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: "Heaven uses the Big Dipper as its mechanism, traversing the twelve *chén* (hours/constellations) above, aligning the five stars within the four and seven [regions], and thus transforming to produce all things. If the Dipper’s handle does not revolve, the celestial *wěi* (weft) and *hòu* (candidates) become disordered, then auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise from the *yáo* (line) symbols, the *fǔhuǒ* (auspicious fire) is lost at dawn and dusk, the stars and luminaries are misaligned, the sun and moon diverge, the four seasons are unbalanced, and all things fail to thrive. Thus it is said: ‘The *Kūn* and *Liáng* (Heaven and Earth), sun and moon, do not move of themselves—all are driven by the Dipper’s handle revolving its mechanism.’ When the Dipper’s handle points to the first, second, and third months, it occupies the *yín-wèi-chén* (Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon) positions, nurturing all things. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, it occupies the *wù-wǔ-wèi* (Snake, Horse, Goat) positions, fostering all things. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it occupies the *shǎn-yǒu-xū* (Monkey, Rooster, Dog) positions, ripening all things. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, it occupies the *hài-zǐ-chǒu* (Pig, Rat, Ox) positions, storing and preserving all things. When the Dipper’s handle circumnavigates Heaven, the year’s function is complete. Great is the transformation of the *Wu* (non-action)!"

The scriptures say: "Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism, while humans use the heart as theirs. Thus, the celestial mechanism operates through yin and yang, and the human mechanism is perfected through the Great *Dao*. The Dipper’s handle’s mechanism must not be overlooked."

Shào Kāngjié (Emperor Shao of Song) said: "The heavens are boundless above and unfathomable, so one observes the Dipper’s numbers to divine celestial movements. Where the Dipper’s handle points, the heavens move accordingly—when the *qiú* (handle) points to *Zǐ* (Rat), it marks the day; when the *sháo* (ladle) points to *Yín* (Tiger), it marks the night."

Yáng Zhī (Master Yang) said in the *Tàiyuán Jīng* (Scripture of the Supreme Origin): "The Dipper’s handle moves southward, leftward in revolution but rightward in rotation."

The Diagram of the Four Symbols Returning to the True states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said: "The scriptures teach: ‘The mouth’s relation to taste, the eyes’ to color, the ears’ to sound, the nose’s to odor—these exhaust human *yù* (desires), and extinguish Heaven’s *lǐ* (principle), all stirred by the heart.’ *Zhuāngzi* (Chuang Tzu) says: ‘Those whose desires run deep have shallow celestial *qi*—thus, the sage practices *wu* (non-action).’ Seal the tongue’s breath, contain the eyes’ light, concentrate the ears’ resonance, and regulate the nose’s inhalation. When the four senses harmonize, they return to the *Xūyuán* (Void Origin), still and motionless within the True Self."

Yán Zǐ (Master Yan), as a fool, attained *mò* (silent) insight through *biān* (wall) meditation, while the Master recognized the *yīguàn* (oneness). Lǎozi (Laozi) embraced the One and guarded the *pǔ* (uncarved block).

Mencius said: "No better cultivation of the heart exists than in desiring little."

The *Dao* teaches: "One must always dispel desire to achieve a tranquil heart."

The *Sìshíèr Zhāng Jīng* (Scripture of the Forty-Two Chapters) states that the Buddha said:
"To distance oneself from desires and keep the mind serene—
This is the same realm."

*Zhuāngzi* says: "When the celestial *qi* is not agitated, the five senses are complete."

*The Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean) says:
"To see without seeing, to hear without hearing,
To eat without knowing its taste—
This is called rectifying the heart through self-cultivation."

*Xúnzǐ* (Hsun Tzu) says:
"The eyes do not wish to indulge in vivid colors,
The ears do not wish to be startled by sounds,
The mouth does not wish to overindulge in flavors,
The nose does not wish to be overwhelmed by odors.
Moreover, the heart dwells in the central void,
Using it to govern the five senses—
This is called the Heavenly Sovereign.
The annotation says: ‘The five senses are the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and body.’"

The *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture for Guiding People) declares:
"The divine wind is still and silent,
Mountains and seas conceal the clouds.
The heavens are free of floating obstructions,
The four *qi* are clear and bright."

The Diagram of the Mixed Unity of the Three Talents states, as the *Jīnbì Gǔwén Lónghǔ Shàng Jīng* (Ancient Prose of the Golden Pile: The Upper Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger) says:
"The chicken’s egg is a metaphor,
Combining to respond to the Three Talents.
Again, the one-inch pearl,
Merges the Three Talents."

*Wén Zhōngzǐ* (Master Wen) says:
"'To cease the ceaselessly surging' is its meaning—
Heaven is not merely the ceaselessly surging.
Earth is not merely mountains, rivers, hills, and valleys.
Humans are not merely the head, body, and feet.
Heaven encompasses the root of the *yuán* (primordial),
Earth encompasses the form of the *yuán*,
Humans encompass the cognition of the *yuán*."

*Lièzǐ* (Lieh Tzu) says:
"The *yuán* *qi* (primordial *qi*) that is light and clear becomes Heaven,
The heavy and turbid becomes Earth,
The balanced and harmonious *qi* becomes humans."

The Diagram of the Five Thunders Gathering the Clustering states, as the *xīxián* (worthy sages) have said:
"The Five *qi* (元) ascend to the primordial,
Unstained by dust, able to purify and tranquilize—
This is called *wú lòu* (leakage-free).
The liver is the east spirit’s wood,
The lungs are the west soul’s gold,
The heart is the south deity’s fire,
The kidneys are the north essence’s water,
The spleen governs the central earthly palace."

Thus, the **sage** does not see with the eyes but the **soul** (*hún*) returns to the liver,
Does not hear with the ears but the **essence** (*jīng*) resides in the kidneys,
Does not speak with the tongue but the **spirit** (*shén*) abides in the heart,
Does not smell with the nose but the **vital breath** (*pò*) lies in the lungs,
Does not move the limbs yet the **intent** (*yì*) is governed by the spleen.
Therefore it is said:
*"The Five Thunders gather in clusters"*—the *Yùshūo* (Jade Pivot) states:
"The eastern wind-thunder resides in the liver palace,
The southern fire-thunder in the heart palace,
The western mountain-thunder in the lung palace,
The northern water-thunder in the kidney palace,
The central earth-thunder in the spleen palace.
Sever the Five Leakages (*wúlòu*).*

To remain motionless and still,
Is the **embodiment** (*tǐ*) of the Dao/Way.
To respond and flow naturally,
Is the **application** (*yòng*) of the Dao/Way.
This is the marvel of the Five Thunders.

The Diagram of the Thunderbolt Devouring and Swallowing states:
The **worthy sages** (*xīxián*) say:
Heaven moves, Earth is still,
Heaven is round, Earth is square.
That which moves must be round,
That which is still must be square.
Roundness brings transformation and fluidity,
Squareness brings steadfastness and fixation.
Square as a chariot, round as its wheel—
When the wheel turns, the chariot rolls;
When the inner wheel moves, the outer form responds.
Thus, the marvel of the thunderbolt lies in **sitting cultivation** (*zuòyùn*).

The *Huángtíng Nèijǐng Yùjīng* (Jade Classic of the Inner Landscape of the Yellow Court) says:
*"The outer is square, the inner is round; the spirit dwells in the center."*

The *Wén Zhōngzǐ* (Master Wen of the Middle) says:
*"Roundness is movement, squareness is stillness—
This reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth."*

The *Sūnzǐ* (Sunzi) says:
*"Roundness brings motion, squareness brings cessation."*

The **Illustrations of the Daoic Principles and Their Manifestations** conclude in Volume One.

The **Illustrations of the Daoic Principles and Their Manifestations** begin in Volume Two.

The Iron Cliff Deng Dan, with orthodox compilation, illustrates the nurturing of my chapter, aspiring to the worthy teacher’s bright exposition.

**The Diagram of the Dao’s Preheavenly Operation:**
Obscure and silent, dim and murky.
The *Guangchengzi* says:
*"The essence of the Ultimate Dao is dim and murky,
The extreme of the Ultimate Dao is obscure and silent.
Without sight, without hearing,
Embrace the Spirit in stillness—
Then the form will naturally rectify itself.
Be ever pure, ever still,
Do not weary your form,
Do not exhaust your vital essence—
Thus may you attain longevity."*

The *Yuanshi Shengtian Dedao Jing* says:
*"Inner observation of heart and mind,
True qi’s inherent presence.
Pure and still, luminous and bright,
Void-white, radiant and dazzling.
Dim and murky, inner and outer undisturbed.
Obscure and silent, perfectly aligned with non-action.
Ancient and eternal, ever-present—
Hold fast to still contemplation."*

The *Laozi* says:
*"There exists a primal substance,
Mingled and complete, before Heaven and Earth took form."*

Master Fu the Great says:
*"A substance before Heaven and Earth,
Formless, hidden, and tranquil.
It governs all phenomena,
Unbound by the four seasons’ decay.
The Diagram of Self-Generated Primordial Spirit:
Neither like you, nor like others,
Neither like Spirit, nor like Ghost."*

The *Liji* says:
*"Clarity and purity within oneself,
Qi and will as refined as Spirit."*

The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
*"Flickering visions in the void we meet,
Dim murk reveals its shifting forms.
A flash—flame ascends—
The True Person emerges anew."*

The Master of Void-Stillness says:
*"When the six senses are pure and still,
The mind’s measure clears like crystal.
Practice this long, and you may
Command ghosts and gods to serve,
Summon winds and rains—
How could this be trifled with?"*

The Resplendent Resident praises:
*"Six senses and mind’s measure free of dust,
Long practice reduces all to one thought’s ash.
Not like digging a pond to await the moon—
When the pond is formed, the moon comes naturally."*

Master Shao Kangjie says:
*"When a person accumulates virtue, yang increases—
Ghosts fear them.
When a person accumulates vice, yin prevails—
Ghosts do not fear them.
The Sage harmonizes with ghosts and spirits,
Shaping their fortune or misfortune."*

The *Zhongyong* says:
*"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—
How vast it is!
You see them, yet they are unseen;
You hear them, yet they are unheard—
Boundless, as if above, as if beside."*

Yang Zhu’s *Fayan* says:
*"The heart-spirit flickers—
Its threads weave the ten thousand directions."*

**The Five-Thunder Fetal Breath Diagram:**
The True Person Chenwang’s poem on fetal breath:
*"All day long you speak of empty space,
Better to return to the womb’s command.
Continuous breath, the Spirit flows—
Smoke ascends, clouds descend, misty and vast.
The Seven Elders of the Three Origins
Master this art—
My body neither drifts west nor east.
Only return to the end, not to present ruin,
Ever nurturing the subtle wind within."*

The world sees one thing but fails to recognize another—
One thought stored, another vanishes into emptiness.

Hixian says:
*"This poem appears in the Tang collection of Liu Wen’s verse; Iron Cliff Deng mistakenly attributed it to Chenwang.
According to the *Book of Tang*, Liu Wen was a recluse.
In youth, he was reckless, a man of daring deeds,
Killed a man in a drunken rage, fled as an outlaw,
Later pardoned, reformed, and devoted himself to study.
He composed songs and poems but refused to bow to nobles,
Always wearing rags.
He returned to Qi and Lu, his end unknown.
Truly, he was one who understood the Dao,
Thus he knew this."*

The world transmits the saying: *"The Sage departs in the clouds."*

*«The Scripture of the Supreme Middle-Yellow True Classic*» states:
*"The Dao of self-perfected fetal transcendence lies within—
The True Daoists nourish the *qi* through fetal breathing,
Retaining and closing the True *qi* to forge fetal breath.
The thunderous aperture is but one orifice."*

Master *Bao Pu* says:
*"The mysterious womb’s single orifice
Is neither the heart, nor the nose and mouth,
Nor the liver and lungs, nor the alimentary canal,
Nor the bladder, nor the *niwan* [脑海].
Knowing this one orifice,
Then winter solstice medicines, fire refining baths,
And shedding the fetal form to solidify the body—
All depend upon it.
This is the thunderous aperture,
And he who attains it
Need not seek the pivot of thunderous transformations elsewhere.
The Perfect Man employs this,
Thus he ascends with effortless might."*

Hixian says:
*"○ The paths of the Buddhas and Daoists are one—
The Great Dao holds no dual gateway.
*Kan* [坎] is the root of life,
Within yin lies yang,
And the interplay of True Emptiness with Marvelous Existence.
Marvelous Existence is their essence,
True Emptiness their function.

*Li* [离] is the root of nature,
Within yang lies yin,
And the interplay of Marvelous Existence with True Emptiness.
True Emptiness is their essence,
Marvelous Existence their function.

Within the Buddha lies the life-force,
Within the Dao lies the source of nature.
Nature and life intertwine,
Emptiness and existence encompass all.

Laozi is Śākyamuni,
Śākyamuni is Laozi.
Born before the Void-age,
He is the progenitor of nature and life.
Once language arose,
Distinct teachings emerged.
Thus, those who lean solely toward life-force
Must fall into emptiness and ruin.
Those who lean solely toward nature
Must sink into darkness and decline.

This leads to divergent paths in the Great Dao,
And competing heresies arise,
Yet none can ultimately grasp
The true source of nature and life.

Our Master Confucius says:
*'Exhaust the principles and perfect the nature,*
*Then one attains the life-force.*
Thus, under heaven there is but one Dao,
And the Sage holds but a single mind.
Nature and life cannot be parted,
Even for a moment.'

The True Person of Jade Creek says:
*'The ancients said: If you only clarify the True Nature but do not refine the elixir,
Even ten thousand kalpas you must know transformation is difficult.
If you only exhaust the life-force but fail to grasp the True Nature,
This is the first illness of cultivation.
Yet once you reach this point,
Do not hesitate to advance further.
Like Master Zhang Ziyang’s desire to visit Dao Guang Chan,
He instead encountered Shi Xinglin,
And thus attained the One Family of the Mysterious Essence,
The Two Marvels of clarity,
And composed the *Restoration of Life-Force* [《复命篇》] for the world.'

In ancient times, a monk asked Zhimen [智门]:
*'How is the essence of Prajñā?*
Zhimen replied:
*'A clam embracing the autumn moon.'

*'How is the function of Prajñā?*
Zhimen replied:
*'A hare bearing its young.'

Later, Master Xuedou composed a verse:
*'A single void, congealed yet free of all clinging,
From which all humans and gods perceive birth from emptiness.
The clam holds the hare of mystery deep within,
Once warring with the Chan school over this truth.'

Han Shan’s verse says:
*'The heart’s moon shines ever bright,
What can all phenomena compare to?
To know the art of the Daoist elixir,
The original spirit within the body is the key.'

Han Shan’s verse says:
*'To benefit, preserve the essence—
This is called "having benefit."
To transform, alter the form—
This is called "having transformation."
If one can both benefit and transform,
Then surely the register of the High Immortals is attained.
If neither benefit nor transformation is achieved,
Then death’s calamity is inevitable.*

Master Pi Ling’s *Restoration of Life-Force* says:
*'In my youth, I studied the Dao,
And all my teachers were men of nature’s essence.
The Chan school’s highest attainment—
A single insight directly transcends the Buddha’s realm.
If their practice is still incomplete,
They remain bound to birth and death.
As for seated transcendence or standing death,
Or seizing the fetus to snatch the shell,
I have never seen one achieve this in an instant.
I often pondered how Zhongni [仲尼, Confucius]
Exhausted principles and perfected nature to attain the life-force,
And how the Śākyamuni [释迦] taught
Neither birth nor annihilation,
While Laozi [老子] spoke of
Ascending and soaring with effortless might.
Thus, the Sage’s intent
Cannot be taken by a single path alone.

The secret I received from the Perfect Man was:
*"The progenitor of the Great Dao
Is none other than the One *Qi* [一炁],
From which all transformations arise."*
Upon hearing this, I doubted not,
Followed the method, and indeed ascended to the Sage’s rank.*

Master Su of Yingbin says:
*'The life-force is the marvel of nature.
Nature can still be spoken of,
But the life-force cannot be spoken of at all.*
The *Yijing* says:
*"Exhaust the principles and perfect the nature,
Then one attains the life-force."*
The Sage’s study of the Dao
Must begin with exhausting the principles,
Progress through perfecting the nature,
And culminate in restoring the life-force.

Master Huai’an Zhuzi [晦庵朱子] read the Daoist texts and composed:
*"In the rocky valley, I uphold steadfast virtue,
Aspiring only to the Mysterious and Void.
On clear nights, I rest in the hallowed chamber,
All day long, I study the Daoist teachings.
The body forgets itself, and the *qi* ascends naturally;
The nature is realized, and the principles leave no trace.
Though I have not yet mastered the Dao,
I escape the shackles of fame and reputation,
Finding joy in the depths of my mind—
Mountains and waters cannot entertain me.
I speak to the maddened seeker:
Your ceaseless striving is in vain."*

Again, in reciting the scriptures, he composed:
*"Weary of the dust’s encumbrances,
I cast them off, embracing the profound Mysterious.
Silently unfolding the unadorned texts,
I chant the verses of the Eastern Marvels.
Morning and evening, a single bow—
Years pass like a rushing stream.
Though the world’s chaos remains,
I rely on this to sever all ties."*

And during long rains, in secluded meditation while reciting scriptures, he composed:
*"Residing alone, I have no affairs,
Casually unfolding the Śākyamuni’s texts.
Temporarily releasing the dust’s entanglements,
I transcend with the Dao as my companion.
The gate is shut in the bamboo grove’s seclusion,
Birds call in the lingering mountain rain.
Having grasped the Law of Non-Action,
Body and mind rest in perfect harmony."*

*The three poems above appear in Master Huai’an’s *Complete Works of Zhu Wen Gong* [《朱文公大全文集》].
The Master often upheld the orthodoxy,
And benefited the world’s teachings—
Yet when he exhausted the principles and perfected the nature,
He was no longer constrained by such norms.
The three Sages’ Dao
Differs in function yet shares the same essence.
Confucius taught without intention, necessity, rigidity, or ego,
The Śākyamuni taught without duality or exhaustion,
Laozi taught without thought or action—
All three spoke of the same principle.

The Master’s poems
Diverge in path yet converge in meaning,
Thus under heaven there is but one Dao.
Who else but the Master’s poems
Can both know and condemn me?
The diagram of the *Lo Shu* [《纵横雷霆九宫图》] says:

Hixian Chen says in *The Dragon Diagram* [《龙图》]:
*"Wear the Nine on your head and the One on your feet,
Three to the left and Seven to the right,
Two and Four as shoulders,
Six and Eight as feet."*

Hixian says:
*"The Nine Palaces of Thunderous Lo Shu
Are the fifteen numbers of the *Lo Shu* arrangement.
The Yellow Emperor observed the River Diagram and drew the trigrams,
Which are based on these very numbers."*

The trigrams *Zhèn* (三) and *Duì* (七) combine to form the central palace’s fifty-five numbers.
The trigrams *Gèn* (八) and *Kūn* (二) likewise form the central palace’s fifty-five numbers.
*Qián* (六) and *Xùn* (四) do the same.
*Kǎn* (一) and *Lí* (九) likewise complete the fifty-five numbers of the central palace.

The marvelous applications of the *Lo Shu* arrangement all sum to fifteen,
Thus achieving the complete numbers of yin and yang.
Hence, *The Drilling of the Primordial* [《乾凿度》] states:
*"The strategy of Old Yang is Nine, the strategy of Old Yin is Six—
Nine and Six are the numbers of fifteen."*

The character *léi* (雷) is composed of fifteen strokes,
Thus it is said: *"Yin and yang striking and clashing—this is thunder."*

**The Diagram of Stealthy Transformation by Wuji and Guiji**
Established by *Jiǎ* (甲) and *Gēng* (庚),
By *Bǐng* (丙), *Rén* (壬), and *Mǎo* (卯),
By *Zǐ* (子)—
Only *Wuji* (戊) and *Guiji* (癸) are included.

Hixian says:
*"The East belongs to *Jiǎ* (甲), the Wood of *Zhèn* (震),
Which is Spring and Thunder, generating and transforming all things.
The West belongs to *Gēng* (庚), the Metal of *Duì* (兑),
Which is Autumn and Thunderous Peals, austerely killing all things.
Thus, thunder and thunderous peals hold the authority of command,
Spring generates, Autumn kills—
They are the origin of all things.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*'Heaven speaks not, yet all things prosper—
The year’s work is complete.'*

*Bǐng* (丙) belongs to *Lí* (离), the Fire that flourishes at *Bǐngwǔ* (丙午).
Thus, it is the convergence of thunder and fire.
Within *Lí* (离) is emptiness—
Vague and indistinct, dim and murky.
The scripture says:
*'Vague and indistinct, we meet in illusion,
Dim and murky, transformations arise—
A flash of fire blazes forth,
And the True Person emerges.'*

*Rén* (壬) is subject to *Qián* (乾), the domain of thunder,
Where it lies dormant as the formation of thunder.
*The Jade Pivot Thunder Scripture* [《玉枢雷书》] says:
*'The hidden *Qián* (乾) emerges as *Xùn* (巽)—
This is the embodiment of the Primordial Worker.'*

*Mǎo* (卯) is *Zhèn* (震), Wood as thunder,
Born at *Hài* (亥), flourishing at *Mǎo* (卯).
*Mǎo* (卯) is the gate of thunder—
Only when the month of *Mǎo* (卯) arrives does thunder sound.
*The Monthly Ordinances* [《月令》] says:
*'In the second month of Spring, thunder begins to sound.'*

*Zǐ* (子) is the eleventh branch, where Winter Solstice resides.
It is the *Earth Thunder Recovering* [《地雷复》] hexagram—
*Kūn* (坤) above, *Zhèn* (震) below,
Where one yang first arises beneath five yin.
The yang *qi* is still faint,
Thus the shoulders are closed and still to nurture the yang.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*'The ancient kings, on the Winter Solstice, closed the gates.'*

Wuji (戊) and Guiji (癸) transform into fire—not as recorded in the *Five Phases* texts.
*Kǎn* (坎) is the true essence of Heaven’s One—water.
Within *Kǎn* (坎) are Wuji (戊) and Guiji (癸), which generate true fire.
The void within governs thunder and fire,
Overseeing the four seasons and controlling the Five Phases—
This is the master of thunder and thunderous peals.
*Zhuangzi* says:
*'There is thunder and thunderous peals—
Fire within water.'*

**The Diagram of Thunder and Thunderous Peals in Motion**
The method of summoning thunder—
All know to clench the fists and cover the ears.
But why does one clench the fists and cover the ears?
To grasp the root of thunder and thunderous peals,
Vigorously moving, entering through its gate,
And thus unleashing wind and rain—
Thunder and lightning arise from this, not from mere exhalations.
The seal and flash align with the Primordial Dao’s use.
Through this practice, one attains the same as the parents, Zhu Sheng [朱生].
How could one dismiss this with ordinary, simplistic explanations?

Yang Zhu’s *Law of Speech* [《法言》] says:
*'The Sage models Heaven and Earth, then applies it to the body.'*

Kang Zhi Shao [邵康节] says:
*'Blowing, puffing, exhaling, and inhaling—
Summoning wind, rain, clouds, and mist—
Their speech resembles thunder.'*
He also says:
*'Clouds move, rain descends, lightning splits, thunder crashes—
Each follows its kind.'*

*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic* [《内经素问》] says:
*'Wind-*qi *communicates with the liver, thunder-*qi *with the heart, rain-*qi *with the kidneys.
Clear yang is Heaven, turbid yin is Earth.
Earth-*qi *ascends as clouds, Heaven-*qi *descends as rain.
Rain emerges from Earth-*qi*, clouds from Heaven-*qi*.'*

**The Diagram of the Five Sons Returning to Gēng (庚)**
The Most High Sovereign Lord obtained the *Nine-Five* Dao,
And the Emperor of Thunder obtained the *Nine-Five* Dao—
From the North to the East, only *Zǐ* (子) is included,
All of which are yang paths.
Thus, it governs Heaven,
Nurtures and withers all things,
Gives rise to and extinguishes the four seasons.
The Five Thunder Lords obtain the *Three-Five* Dao,
Which does not differ from the *Nine-Five*—
All are the Dao of thunder and thunderous peals.

Hixian says:
*'The Five Sons returning to Gēng (庚)—
One, Three, Five, Seven, Nine are all yang numbers,
Combined, they make twenty-five—
Thus the *Classic of Changes* says: "Heaven’s numbers are twenty-five."
The Five Sons returning to Gēng (庚) are the sovereign rulers of all things.
From the East, *Rénzǐ* (壬子) returns to Gēng (庚)—
This is the Nine number.
From the North, *Bǐngzǐ* (丙子) returns to Gēng (庚)—
This is the Five number.
From the South, *Wùzǐ* (戊子) returns to Gēng (庚)—
This is the Three number.
From the West, *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) returns to Gēng (庚)—
This is the Seven number.
From the Center, *Gēngzǐ* (庚子) returns to Gēng (庚)—
This is the One number.
Thus, the true numbers of Heaven are obtained—
This is the Dao of thunder and thunderous peals.'*

**The Diagram of the Great Unfolding’s Numbers**
Thunder and thunderous peals obtain the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
Thus they are called the Five Thunders.
The Dao scriptures say:
*'East Three, South Two—together they make Five;
North One, West Four—together they make Nine.
Wuji (戊) and Jǐ (己) return to their original generating numbers,
The Three Families meet to form the Infant.'*
Once the Sacred Embryo is formed,
It becomes the Five Thunder Lords.

One, Three, Five, Seven, Nine—these are the yang odd numbers.
The *Classic of Changes* says:
*'Heaven’s numbers are Two, Four, Six, Eight, Ten—
The yin even numbers,
And Earth’s numbers are thirty.'*
The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five—
The complete numbers of yin and yang are achieved.

The Great Unfolding’s fifty numbers,
Subtracting Five leaves the Five Phases’ roots.
Their use in forty-nine,
Again subtracting One symbolizes the immovable *Tai Ji*.

Liu Mu’s *Hooked and Hidden* [《钩隐》] says:
*'One combined with Five makes Six,
Two combined with Five makes Seven,
Three combined with Five makes Eight,
Four combined with Five makes Nine,
Five combined with Five makes Ten.
One and Six are Water,
Two and Seven are Fire,
Three and Eight are Wood,
Four and Nine are Metal,
Five and Ten are Earth—
This is the Five-Five.'*

Yang Xiong’s *Great Mystery* [《太玄》] says:
*'One and Six share the same origin,
Two and Seven are companions,
Three and Eight are friends,
Four and Nine follow the same path,
Five and Ten guard each other.'*

Chen Xiqí said:
The Great Unfolding’s numbers—forty-nine in use, while One is suspended and unused—its meaning.
Scholars merely know that One symbolizes the immovable *Tai Ji*, yet they fail to grasp its true significance.
Why? Because One is the fundamental root of all numbers.
All things’ principles: without a root, they are disordered; with a root, they must not be overused, for overuse brings chaos again.
Take, for instance, the motion of a cart—when its axle is centered, it stops.
Or a chariot’s wheels—when they are large, they move.
Like a net’s central cord, which is drawn taut.
Like a vessel’s handle, which is grasped.
Like the sovereign’s authority, with hands and feet acting beneath.
Like a general commanding from the center, with soldiers obeying.
Like the Sage-Emperor’s non-action, while ministers act.
Like the wise being honored, while the capable are employed—
Thus, all who grasp One are its root, its foundation, its master.
All possess the unchanging principle of unity; if moved, the rest fall into disorder.

Yichuan Chengzi said:
The Great Unfolding’s numbers total fifty.
Numbers begin at One and complete at Five; the lesser Unfolding forms Ten, while the greater Unfolding makes fifty.
When fifty is complete, it is immovable, hence One is subtracted for use.
The numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty, with five completing their transformations and animating the spirits.
*Transformations* refer to function; *spirits* refer to application.
*King Fang’s I Ching* states:
Fifty refers to the ten solar terms, twelve earthly branches, and twenty-eight lunar mansions.
Of the fifty, the unused One is the Heavenly *qi*’s birth.

Zheng Xuan said:
The numbers of Heaven and Earth are harmonized through the Five Phases’ *qi*.
The Five Phases each contain five; the Great Unfolding subtracts one, thus using forty-nine.
The Five Phases’ *qi* harmonized refers to the ten solar terms, twelve lunar tones, and twenty-eight lunar mansions—through which the Five Phases’ *qi* flows.
Fifty-five in total, subtracting five yields the Great Unfolding; again subtracting One gives forty-nine.
This doctrine originates from *The Buhrst Degrees*, aligning with King Fang’s view, though the Five Phases’ harmonized *qi* is even more refined.

*Guanzi’s I Ching* states:
Zhang Yi asked: The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five; yet you say fifty, then subtract One—what does this mean?
Guanzi replied: The *shu* divination stalks do not merely imitate Heaven and Earth; the Five Phases must operate within them.

Zhao Shuo said:
Its use of forty-nine—
The Great Unfolding is inexhaustible.
The subtraction of One demonstrates its inexhaustibility.

**Five Phases Inversion Diagram**
When the Five Phases are disordered, the tiger walks in water.
**Five Phases Inversion Technique**
The dragon emerges from fire’s embrace.

Zhongyang Zhang Zhenren said:
The Five Phases inverted—
The elixir body ever refined.
Shi Chen Wang Zhenren said:
Linked cycles, sequential transformations—
The Five Phases’ essence is inversion.
Master the intent of inversion within,
And thunderbolts strike from azure dawn.

*Inversion* refers to reversing the Five Phases,
Harmonizing the Four Symbols,
Extracting the undifferentiated *qi* of the Primordial Void,
Seizing the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union,
Entering the Yellow Chamber,
And birthing the supreme treasure—
Thus, formless gives rise to form,
The body beyond the body.
When virtue and merit are complete,
Ascension to the Celestial Immortal is attained.

*Order* is humanity’s great principle:
Dividing *jing* and *qi* to form the body,
*Qi* becomes matter, wandering spirits transform—
With a body comes suffering;
Tribulations arise from here.

*The Awakening to Reality* states:
If one seeks inversion in daily life,
Even the earth’s dust becomes treasure.

**Wind**
Yin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.
**Cloud**
Yin weak, Yang strong—wind arises.
**Snow**

**Rainbow**
Excess water becomes rainbow.
**Drought**
Excess fire becomes drought.

**Thunderbolt Essence and Function Ode**
Heaven and Earth’s void center ever open,
Only when dynamic stillness splits into Yin and Yang.
Life and death, opening and closing—
All inverted, the Dipper’s pivot steadfast.
Thunder’s clash erupts from the earth,
Lightning’s glow flashes golden.
Wind drifts, weak or strong, rising with time,
Strong or weak, clouds gather short or long.
Ascending and descending, steaming rain descends,
Soft snow falls on the silver hall.
Frost flies, oppressive Yin collapses—
Yang flourishing, dew scatters far.
When ascending and descending fail, fog forms;
Stagnant Yin, hail—no Yang.
Excess water becomes mirage, excess fire becomes drought.
Harmonized and balanced, all things flourish.
Stillness, divine wind—Heaven’s *qi* bright,
Ascending yet unrising—eternal truth.
Raging winds, sudden rains—Yin and Yang dance,
Winter warmth like summer’s heat, summer’s chill like winter’s frost.
Prolonged rain, endless drought—floods surge,
Thunder crashes in the tenth month, summer frost flies.
Self-crafted transformation unites Heaven and Earth,
Yet those who fail to grasp the pivot merely measure.

*The Soul Treasure’s Complete Methods* states:
Earth’s *qi* ascends, becoming cloud, dispersing as rain.
Heaven’s *qi* descends, dispersing as fog, congealing as dew.
Excessive Yin turns dew to frost, rain to snow.
Excessive Yang turns fog to mist, clouds to mist-haze.
Yin concealing Yang—Yang’s *qi* unchecked—
Clashing, it births thunderbolts.
Yang concealing Yin—Yang’s *qi* uncoalesced—
Firmly solidifying, it forms hail and sleet.
Yin and Yang unaligned—
Lightning strikes.
Yin and Yang mismatched—
The dragon transforms into rainbow.

Kangjie Shaozi said:
Yang obtains Yin and becomes rain;
Yin obtains Yang and becomes wind;
The firm obtains the yielding and becomes cloud;
The yielding obtains the firm and becomes thunder.

There is no Yin without the ability to become rain,
Nor no Yang without the ability to produce thunder.

Rain is yielding, yet belongs to Yin;
Yin cannot stand alone,
Thus it awaits Yang before it rises.
Thunder is firm, belonging to Yang;
Yang cannot act by itself,
And must await Yin before it erupts.

*The Treatise on Heaven and Earth’s Divine Interaction* states:
When Yin accumulates excessively, it turns dew to frost,
And rain to snow.
When Yang accumulates excessively, it turns fog to mist,
And clouds to mist-haze.
When Yin conceals Yang within,
Thunderbolts arise.
When Yang conceals Yin within,
It solidifies and births hail and sleet.
When Yin and Yang are unbalanced,
Their chaotic interaction produces the rainbow.

*Zhuangzi* says:
The Great Block exhales *qi*—its name is Wind,
Which is the state of no action.
When it acts, all openings roar with fury.

Xīyí [Kangjie Shaozi] says:
When *Zhen* obtains the initial line of *Qián* [Heaven],
Thunder erupts from beneath Heaven.
Observing the *Duì* [Lake] hexagram reveals
Rain emerges from the Earth.
Again, it says: Heaven’s *qi* descends as rain.
Again: *Kǎn* [Abyss] is Heaven, Water, and *qi*.
The *Kǎn* well is its manifestation.
*Duì* [Lake] is Earth’s Water, its form,
And now rain is its embodiment.
One Yang descending into two Yin forms *Kǎn*;
The *qi* of *Kǎn* subtly permeates all things,
As the foundation for receiving the Mandate.
Thus it is said: "None moisten things like Water."
*Yáng* [Yang] *qi* ascends upright,
Yet suddenly meets Yin *qi*—
They clash and descend as rain.
For Yang *qi* is light, Yin *qi* is heavy;
Thus Yang is pressed down by Yin *qi* and falls as rain.

Yin *qi* ascends upright,
Yet suddenly meets Yang *qi*—
It aids its flight and becomes cloud.
When Yin *qi* congeals and Yang is trapped within,
It lashes out and becomes thunderbolts.
When Yang *qi* is concealed within Yin’s depths,
It erupts violently as thunder.
When Yang remains outside and cannot enter,
It circles endlessly and becomes Wind.
When Yin *qi* congeals within,
And Yang *qi* seeks to enter but cannot,
It swirls around externally without rest,
And becomes the arrival of Wind,
Dispersing Yin *qi* until it ceases.
When harmony and dispersion occur,
It becomes frost, snow, rain, and dew.
When there is no harmony in dispersion,
It becomes *lì* [perverse] *qi* mingling with haze.
Hail, perverse *qi* in flight,
And the yellow mists of *mái* [filth],
All are Yin and Yang’s twisted, unbalanced *qi*,
Thus hailstones are foul and turbid—
Or green and black in hue.

Huì’ān [Zhu Xi] says:
The snowflake’s six-pointed form arises
When sleet is struck by fierce winds, forming prismatic petals.
Again: Six is the number of Yin,
The *Tài Yīn* [Great Yin] *Xuán Jīng* [Mysterious Essence] stone is also six-edged,
This is Nature’s inherent number.
Again: The dragon [rainbow] is a waterly phenomenon;
When it emerges and mingles with Yang *qi*,
It condenses and forms rain.
But ordinary rain is simply
The result of Yin and Yang *qi* condensing and rising—
Not necessarily requiring the dragon’s intervention.
It is merely the lower *qi* ascending,
Not yet forming rain.
Only when the upper *qi* is overwhelming,
With no outlet for release,
Can it truly become rain.

Huánxī [Wu Zhi] says:
Wind follows the *Xùn* [Wind] trigram—this is fixed.
Yet how does Wind possess *qi*?
The lower four lines represent the *Kǎn* [Abyss] hexagram.
The fifth line above is *Lǐ* [Fire].
When water enters fire, they agitate and produce *qi*.
Pushing this to the smallest of things,
A ladle of water extinguishes fire,
Yet fire rages and *qi* ascends.
How much more so for the vast *qi* of *Kǎn* and *Lǐ*?
Fire’s joy is subtle in sound,
Yet fierce in *qi*.
At the side of cascading torrents and surging rapids,
When the sound is **□** [missing character],
The *qi* becomes chilling and cold;
The accumulation of subtle forces
Condenses into Wind—
Thus water and fire become Wind.
Indeed.

The warm Wind arises in the months of *Bǐng* [3rd] and *Dīng* [4th],
While the *Jì* [typhoon] Wind arises from the sea’s *lù* [dew].
This is not only thunder raging with sound,
For all openings roar in fury—
Wind does so as well.
When *qi* is stored to its extreme and dormant,
Yet released after long suppression,
It becomes thunder.
Constant release prevents extreme storage;
Without extreme storage,
It becomes Wind.
All things that rage eternally
Are not solely water-driven.
