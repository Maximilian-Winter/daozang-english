### **A Brief Explanation on the Transmission of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures, Precepts, Ritual Methods, and Registers – Volume One**

*(Beginning missing)*

Zhang Wanfu, prostrating himself, inquires into the scriptural purport: Man emerges from the void and natural spontaneity, shaping form and embracing consciousness, modeling Heaven and emulating Earth, encompassing all things. Guarded by numinous spirits, his nobility is beyond compare, yet he cannot escape defilement by dust and toil, drifting through the cycles of life and death without self-awakening.

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, employs skillful means to expound scriptures and precepts, opening the path to salvation for gods and humans, universally guiding men and women to ascend the Orthodox Dao.

Yet qi varies in purity and turbidity, and men differ in wisdom and folly. Thus, the teachings are divided into the Three Vehicles, forms into myriad grades, and methods into gradual and sudden—all for good reason.

A concise explanation of the essentials of transmission follows.

### **Catalogue of Precepts**

**Three Refuges Precepts**
These two precepts are for those newly awakened to enter the Dao, commanding them to take refuge in the Three Treasures.

**Five Precepts**
These five precepts command the elimination of the five desires, cultivation of the five virtues, upholding of the five precepts, and emergence from the five turbidities.

**Eight Precepts**
These eight precepts involve upholding eight matters to align with the eight spirits.
The above two sets of precepts are received by the living.

**Supreme Ten Precepts**

**Initial Perfection Precepts**
These Initial Perfection Precepts are received by those newly leaving the household, signifying the first shedding of secular attire to enter the Dao.

These are received by Highest Clarity Daoists.

In the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the first day of the seventh month at noon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, upon the Floating Pearl Peak of the Long Mulberry Grove in Yuchai Mountain of the Western Jinayu Kingdom, transmitted the *Upper Grade Wisdom Precepts* to the Supreme Dao Lord.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: "Now I shall universally proclaim the Dharma-sound, awakening all beings. For all men and women, I shall dissolve calamities, avert misfortunes, invoke blessings, extend lifespans, eradicate the roots of suffering, enabling the living to perceive the Dao and escape the eight difficulties, and the dead to rejoice, feasting in Heaven, soon to be reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings.

Those who cultivate fasts and seek the Dao must wholeheartedly request and uphold the Ten Precepts, receiving them earnestly without forgetfulness, concentrating the mind in silent contemplation, penetrating the natural with profound thought. They must not indulge in scattered thoughts that disturb form and spirit."

The Heavenly Worthy further stated: "If one desires to pacify the body and govern the state, ensuring the purity and nobility of one’s household, with heavenly spirits as protectors and earthly deities as reverent allies, one must cultivate meritorious deeds, diligently observe fasts and precepts, widely bestow the Dharma-gates, placing others before oneself, benefiting all things, and universally extending merit to all. When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.

With surplus in cultivating goodness, cloud chariots descend from Heaven; with tireless propagation of the Dao, one attains immortality. These are the supreme precepts of fundamental practice—how can they not be reverently upheld?"

**Wisdom Precepts for Observing the Body**
The Emperor of the Great Tenuity Heaven said: "When I first studied, I only knew to request scriptures and did not seek precepts. Thus, I passed through kalpas of life and death without upholding the great precepts for observing the body—how could I have attained immortality?

Therefore, in Daoist study, precepts and regulations must come first; they are the honored foundation of the Daoist family. The methods should be recited, for even the highest sages keep them secret and unwritten.

If there are methods without precepts, it is like crossing the sea without a boat or oars, or having a mouth without a tongue—how can one ferry across the countless bodies? One must first recite and practice them without negligence."

Wanfu states: "All who newly enter the Dharma-gate must uphold precepts. Precepts prevent wrongdoing, halt evil, advance goodness, and ascend to immortality—they are the gateway to all practices and the key thereto.

The six passions defile and attach, the five desires sink and delude; internally, they confuse the heart, externally, they darken and pollute the realm. Chasing fame and profit, indulging in sights and sounds, one moves toward the source of evil and forever strays from the domain of the worthy.

Without upholding precepts, none can return. Thus, the scriptures say: 'Uphold precepts to restrain the six passions; contemplate the Dao to dispel desires.'

They also say: 'Studying the Dao without cultivating fasts and precepts is a vain toil in the mountains and forests.'

And again: 'All begin with fasts and precepts, accumulating merit and forging past-life affinities.'"

Soaring through the Great Void, lifting high those of superior attainment—
all who receive precepts must approach a master to humbly receive them, transcribe and recite them diligently.
If one receives them alongside scriptures, this is not required.

**Orthodox Registers of the Dao**
One General Register, Ten Generals Register.
One minor register, received by youths.
Register of the Seventy-Five Immortal Generals—governing yang, for men.
Register of the Seventy-Five Spirit Generals—governing yin, for women.
When these two registers, male and female, are combined, they form the *Register of the Hundred and Fifty Immortal-Spirit Generals*.

**Nine Palaces for Warding Off Calamities**

The aforementioned fourteen *zhong* and thirty-six registers present only a broad outline; the remaining one hundred volumes of stages are fully expounded in their respective scriptures, with no detail omitted.

The *Zhengyi Fawen Kejie Pin* states: To govern all spirits and ghosts of Heaven and Earth, subdue and vanquish demonic forces, slay malevolent essences, summon numinous *qi*, command mountains and rivers, purge polluted vapors, transmit memorials through divine couriers, and commune with immortals—none precedes the *Zhengyi* in efficacy.

Wanfu says: Before receiving the *orthodox qi*, all people are afflicted by the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens, specters, demons, and every kind of malevolent force, unable to extricate themselves or find relief. Thus, vexations lodge in the body, bringing suffering, illness, and hindrance to Daoist cultivation, cutting short lifespans. In great compassion, the Most High revealed the Dharma and bestowed transformation, subduing the fierce and unruly, establishing divine titles, deploying *qi* to summon spirits, eradicating demonic forces, and suppressing wayward essences. Thereby, purity and turbidity are distinguished, humans and ghosts separated, the self rectified, and evil expelled—unifying the myriad under one principle. For evil arises from deviation from the orthodox, while the myriad returns to a single source. Thus, all spirits are recorded and guided to return to the true Dao.

The Heavenly *Ding* and *Jia* soldiers, the immortal officials and divine troops—these are but the Dao’s emanations, congealing spirit and deploying *qi*. Outwardly, their wondrous functions radiate; inwardly, their essence shines forth. As their empty reflections manifest, true officials respond. They may be met through spiritual communion, yet defy rational contemplation. All that the scriptures elucidate cannot be fully fathomed.

These were spoken by Zuo Xian Gong and Jin Ming, transmitted for cultivation and practice.

The *Preface and Exegesis of the Daode Jing by Tai Ji Zuo Xian Gong* states: The Five Thousand Characters proclaim the source of the Dao and virtue, embracing all that is vast and penetrating all that is subtle—it is the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity. In the first year of the Shang Huang era, on the twelfth day of the first month, the day of *bingwu* in the year of *dingmao*, Lao Jun descended as the teacher of Zhou. In the first year of the Wu Ji era, the year of *guichou*, on the day of *renwu* in the fifth month, he departed from Zhou. In that year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he crossed the pass, and on the twenty-eighth day, he transmitted the *Daode Jing* to the Perfected Lord Yin.

This scripture is revered by the gods, immortals, spirits, and ghosts of the ten directions. The Daoist Zheng Siyuan said: My teacher, Ge Xian Gong, received the *Daode Jing* from the Perfected of Tai Ji and taught its oral exegesis, saying: This scripture is the ancestral source of the Dao. Those who recite and chant it ten thousand times, pacifying the heart and contemplating the mysterious, shall all ascend as immortals.

The *Hidden Commentary of the Jade Scripture of the Supreme* states: Those who can recite the Five Thousand Characters ten thousand times will be welcomed by the cloud dragons of the Supreme. If, after completing ten thousand recitations, one has not yet departed, they should read it thrice a month. When the cloud chariot arrives, they shall ascend as immortals.

The *Hidden Commentary* further states: Those who study the Dao at home should receive the Five Thousand Characters. On the first and fifteenth days of the month, their life-destiny days, and the eight solar terms, at noon and midnight, they should read it once. With sincere devotion to the wondrous matters of the scripture, one entrusts their form to the essence of the Great Yin. The celestial emperor’s cloud chariot will welcome the spirit of the person, sparing them from the trials of the Three Offices of Mount Tai and the hells. Above, they will be reborn before the Celestial Emperor in heaven; below, they will be reborn into the families of marquises and kings, their features perfected, even transforming from female to male, and forming karmic ties with the Upper Clarity. This scripture encompasses all beings, great and small, fulfilling every aspiration without hindrance. It guides the dead and nurtures the living, suiting all purposes without exception. It can pacify the state and secure the people, subduing border barbarians—none shall not submit to the Dao. This scripture is wondrous, and none surpasses it.

Wan Fu said: The Five Thousand Characters are the essence of the Three Caverns, the profound purport of the One Vehicle. They govern the body and the state, guiding existence to return to non-existence. Their meaning and imagery defy full explication, and their depths are unfathomable—yet they are the model for a hundred kings and the unchanging text across a thousand kalpas. Thus, the immortals who attained the Dao among the officials of Tai Ji, as well as the sagely perfected of Tai Xuan Du Shan, constantly studied and savored the *Daode*, reciting and chanting its mysteries. Even ordinary people who obtain it, purify themselves for a thousand days, and recite it ten thousand times will be welcomed by cloud dragons, attended by immortal youths, and attain the art of eternal preservation across ten thousand kalpas.

Lao Jun transmitted it to Yin Xi, who cultivated it and attained the Dao. Following Lao Jun, he transformed the barbarians, traversed the world, emerged from non-existence and entered existence, and gained mastery over transformations, becoming the Supreme Perfected, Wen Shi Xian Sheng, the Primordial Master.

*The Three Scrolls Transmitted by Master Tao.*

The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: The Lord of Divine Treasure is the august deity of the Cavern-Spirit. When the scriptures emerged in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, they were titled *The Three Sovereigns’ Cavern-Spirit*.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Grand Ultimate Palace* states: The Three Sovereigns are the august deities of the Three Caverns, the primordial qi of Great Existence. The Heavenly Sovereign governs qi, the Earthly Sovereign governs spirits, and the Human Sovereign governs life. The three unite as virtue, and the myriad things are transformed thereby.

The scriptures of the Cavern-Spirit Three Sovereigns, transmitted to instruct later ages, guide transformations and assist the state, aiding and protecting the multitudes. Thus, when the Son of Heaven obtains them, phoenixes descend, auspicious omens appear, and the hundred spirits are commanded, with nothing they do not ward off. Should one enter the famous mountains and traverse the eight extremities, the ghosts and spirits of the world dare not oppose them, and the superior adept ascends as an immortal.

Wan Fu says: Though the perfected, divine immortals, and sages who attain the Dao transcend the mortal realm, they also hold offices of transformation and governance, presiding over the heavens, earth, cavern-palaces, mountains, and rivers, summoning ghosts and commanding spirits, calling forth clouds and controlling rain to enliven the myriad people.

This text is the spontaneous chapter of the Most High, the pledge of the divine perfected. Spoken by the Lord of Divine Treasure, it transforms the Nine Immortals and Three Sovereigns, each receiving one scroll, thereby bringing great transformation to the world—hence its name. Its language is profound and subtle, its principles and affairs refined and minute, all recorded within the scriptures, though exhaustively detailing them is difficult.

*The Spontaneous Contract.*

**The Middle Alliance Scriptures in Forty-Seven Scrolls.**
*The Great Alliance True Writ.*
*The Inner Sounds of the Eight Luminaries.*

The *Scripture of the Vermilion Writ of True Writ* states: The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters of True Writ emerged before the Primordial Beginning, within the Void Cavern. Before heaven and earth took root, before sun and moon shone, in the profound obscurity—without ancestor or lineage—the numinous writ flickered dimly, now present, now absent. The Two Modes awaited it to divide the Great Yang; awaited it to bring illumination. The numinous chart revolutionized the cosmos, the mysterious images shifted and transmuted, riding the moment to respond in harmony—thus it came into being.

Heaven and earth, receiving it, divided and took form; the Three Luminaries, receiving it, radiated light. The numinous writ flourished in lush splendor, illuminating the Highest Clarity, emanating from the Celestial Realm of Primordial Azure, its hues unbound by fixed direction. Its branches and postures curved and turned, beyond exhaustive tracing.

The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavern Yang Palace, tempered it in the Flowing Fire Court, clarifying its true writ until it gleamed with radiance. The Cavern Yang *qi* was vermilion—hence the name *Vermilion Writ*. Once the numinous chart shone forth, the myriad emperors paid homage to the perfected, soaring through empty space, circling the Upper Palaces, burning incense and scattering flowers, their mouths chanting the numinous chapters.

At that time, heaven manifested twelve mysterious auspices, earth produced twenty-four responses. Above, it celebrated the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens; below, it extolled the luminous treasures of the Three Heavens. The divine winds stirred, the august Dao flowed unimpeded. The Primordial Beginning issued the decree; the Supreme Perfected held the brush. The Jade Consorts swept the mats; gold was cast into tablets, the jade chapters inscribed. The Five Elders recorded them, secreting them within the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital Palace, where jade maidens tended the incense, the Supreme Flower held the towels, jade lads stood guard, and jade steps led to the celestial halls. The Nine Heavens’ writ was not for ghosts or spirits to hear.

The Heavenly Treasure, by its floating, brings ascent; the Earthly Secret, by its concealment, brings stability. The Jade Emperor holds it to secure his reign; the Three Luminaries ride it to attain lofty brilliance. The highest sages uphold it to attain perfection; the Five Peaks follow it to gain numinosity. The Son of Heaven obtains it to govern; the dynastic fortune enjoys it to attain great peace. Truly, the marvelous power of the numinous writ is the mysterious root of heaven and earth. Its majestic numen vast and boundless, its great transformation vast and unobstructed—it is the ancestor of the divine and luminous, its measure unfathomable, towering into the great void.

It further states: The Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders’ Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters emerged from the spontaneous writ of the Void Cavern. Within the state of non-being, it gave birth to heaven and established earth, transforming the divine and luminous. Above, it is called *Numinous*; it stabilizes the Five Peaks and ensures the nation’s enduring existence. Below, it is called *Treasure*; the Numinous Treasure’s mystery is the most exalted of the myriad things.

The *True Writ of the Eastern Direction* states: *"The Cavern Mystery Chapter of the Numinous Treasure of Life."* The Southern says: *"The Southern Clouds’ Celestial Treasure Numinous Lift."* The Central says: *"The Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the Cavern Clarity Treasure Kalpa."* The Western says: *"The Cavern Subtlety Chapter of the Golden Perfected Treasure Brilliance."* The Northern says: *"The Primordial Spirit’s Life Perfected Treasure Brilliance Writ."*

The Five Elders’ Jade Chapters are all spontaneous writings of the Void Cavern, secreted within the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital Purple Tenuity Palace, guarded by the divine officials of the Five Emperors. According to the mysterious statutes, the Numinous Treasure True Writ emerges once every forty thousand kalpas, at the beginning of the Vermilion Clarity’s opening of the mysterious, called the *Void Cavern Vermilion Writ Radiant August True Writ*. When heaven and earth divided, heaven was named *Numinous*, earth *Treasure*—hence the *Numinous Treasure Twenty-Four Lives*.

The scripture states: In the first year of the Highest August, on the second day of the ninth month, the Later Sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River. He encountered the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King. Lord Li bowed deeply, saying: "Formerly, I received the transmission of the Heavenly Writ Jade Script’s twenty-four charts. Though I obtained the text, I have not yet fathomed its marvelous purport. Now, encountering the Heavenly Venerable, I humbly request your completion of it." Thereupon, the Heavenly King exhaled the Cavern Mystery Inner Vision Jade Talisman and bestowed it upon Lord Li, instructing him to purify himself for a thousand days, face east, and ingest the talisman. His form and spirit would then fully manifest, naturally penetrating all doubts, which would instantly be resolved.

Lord Li bowed deeply, receiving the teaching with reverence. He followed the celestial rites precisely, purifying himself for a thousand days, facing east to ingest the talisman. The Eight Luminaries’ spirits all appeared within his body; the golden writ and jade script, the twenty-four charts, shone in empty space, their patterns and colors radiant and fresh, penetrating without end.

In the first year of the Vermilion Clarity, on the first day of the first month’s *yin* hour at noon, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable, in the Vermilion Clarity Heaven’s Southern Fire Mound’s Cinnabar Numinous Cavern Palace, spread out the five colors, fashioned an altar of yellow gold, laid out a foundation of white silver, and invoked the seven treasures to transmit the Cavern Mystery. Golden writ in purple script, jade text in cinnabar chapters, the spontaneous numinous chart, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Three Divisions’ Radiant Spirits, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and their armies and mounts—all received it from the Most High Limitless Dao Lord. Following the august rites, the mysterious statutes, and the luminous true statutes, he initiated ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine persons whose names were inscribed in gold, listed in the celestial registers. Those destined for immortality, at the end of the great kalpa, shall gather the writ and return it to the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace of the Great Lofty Purple Tenuity Palace.

The *Upper Scripture of Jade Script* states: The Heavenly Perfected August One said: "The Heavenly Writ Jade Script congeals the *qi* of soaring mystery to form the numinous writ, harmonizes the eight gatherings to produce sound, and unites the five unions to compose the chapters. When the great kalpa’s appointed time arrives, the jade-like sounds arise spontaneously. The divine winds play in emptiness, the shao music resonates through the caverns, shining above the myriad heavens, illuminating the depths of the great darkness. It transforms together with the Dragon Han, unfurls the Vermilion Clarity in the Yan Kang. The Two Modes await it to divide; the Three Luminaries await it to separate. The highest sages ride it to attain the divine; the Five Peaks treasure it to gain numinosity. All things obtain it to live; dynastic fortunes enjoy it to attain peace. Its vast pattern, towering and exalted—those who uphold it endure; those who treasure it receive the descent of the perfected. Those who cultivate it become divine immortals, delivering the dead from eternal night, refining the living souls in the Vermilion Palace. The marvelous transformative writ emerges from spontaneity, undefiled when mixed, unclarified when settled, indestructible when destroyed, reborn when extinguished. Lofty and flourishing in the great void, it is the ancestor of the myriad emperors. Its majestic numen vast and boundless—its name is difficult to express."

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: The inner sounds and natural jade characters of the various heavens for transmission and empowerment must follow the standards of the *Luminous Perfection Canon*. Inscribe them in cinnabar upon white silk, consecrate them with the seven treasures to stabilize the numinous, offer gold and silk as tokens of devotion, and present yellow-silk memorials to the heavens. Proclaim the texts of transmission before the central altar, exposed for three days and three nights. If unmarred by wind or rain, with no characters scattered or lost, then the transmission is true and may be conveyed.

The Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth said: To cultivate the Dao of ascending as an immortal, or the methods of liberation and extinction, to achieve corpse-release and concealed transformation, to revolve through birth and death, and follow the cycles without constraint in the Great Yin—inscribe in cinnabar the jade characters of the various heavens and the boundless inner sounds upon white silk, and wear them upon the body. Follow the texts in attire and conduct, keeping the heart free from defilement. The five viscera become harmoniously clear, the six palaces serene and still. In empty azure non-action, after eight years one penetrates the various heavens, sits and beholds the ten directions, and divine perfected beings descend in communion. The body radiates jadelight, and one rides the dragon chariot to ascend at dawn.

The jade writ of the supreme Dao is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. Following the precepts and wearing it for a hundred days, the various heavens record it, the earthly officials erase the tally. After eight years, divine perfected beings descend of themselves, the body radiates jadelight, and one penetrates the hidden void, sitting and beholding spontaneity. The dead corpse revives, returning to the womb and regaining human form. The revolving wheel is not extinguished, and in life and death one attains immortality. But if lightly divulged or carelessly revealed, one bears the wind-knives of the River Source, and for ten thousand kalpas will never attain immortality.

The ancient standards of Luminous Perfection should be kept secret.

Wanfu said: The true writ of the Numinous Treasure arose within the empty cavern, before the Primordial Beginning. Before heaven and earth took root, before sun and moon shone, in profound obscurity—without ancestor, without origin.

The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Yang-Cavern Palace, smelted it in the Flowing-Fire Court, clarifying its true writ until it gleamed with radiant light. Then the Supreme Perfected took up the brush, the Jade Consort spread the mat, the Golden Lads scattered flowers, the Jade Maidens wafted incense, the Five Thearchs stood guard, and the Three Realms came to pay homage. Heaven treasured it to bring about floating ascent; earth concealed it to ensure stability. The Five Peaks enjoyed it and secured their tranquility; the One Man followed it to attain great peace. It governs the kalpic cycles, exhales and inhales yin and yang, teaches and transforms all things, and sets the model for the myriad heavens. All the great sages who attained the Dao, the host of perfected beings, the Lords and Elders—none failed to uphold the Numinous Treasure, reciting and chanting its scriptures. With heaven and earth they share dissolution, with sun and moon they hang together.

The great cycle of heaven and earth abides closely within my body. Diligently cultivating it, one does not die; briefly practicing it, one attains long life. It is the boat and oar of heaven and humanity, the field of blessings for emperors and the hidden. Its principles are subtle and profound, beyond full expression. Transmitted through endless kalpas, how could a fool like me presume to know them?

**The Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure**

The *Great Mystery Scripture* says: All the spirits of heaven and earth are under the command of the Six Jia.

When the Old Lord practiced them, he attained long life and delivered the world, effortlessly summoning traveling kitchens, concealing his form and altering his body, sitting or standing at will. He went forth without choosing days, traveled without selecting hours, oversaw the myriad spirits, repelled illness and disease, crossed rivers and seas without fear of wind or waves, descended from heaven into the abyss, empty and spontaneous. He entered Kunlun directly, mastered the Dao of immortality, ascended to the Great Clarity, and ascended to the Purple Tenuity.

Wanfu said: Yin and yang are the root of the Dao. Cold and heat, life and death—these are the qi of movement and stillness. That which is clear, floating, round, and moving is luminous yang. That which is turbid, sinking, square, and still is obscure yin. Yang cannot generate alone but awaits yin to complete it; yin cannot form itself but requires yang to generate it. Inhalation and exhalation, emptiness and fullness—when the two qi harmonize, the myriad forms take shape. Male to the east, female to the west; metal is white, wood is green; water flows, earth rests; heaven moves, earth is still. Above and below interact in harmony, and the hundred spirits transform. Qian and Kun divide, revolving a thousand essences—subtle and wondrous, beyond measure, yin and yang manifest.

The days Jia and Yi are the stems; Zi and Chou are the branches. When paired and combined, they form the number six. The stems are the days, the essence of yang, called odd—one, three, five, seven, nine. The branches are the hours, the numen of yin, called even—two, four, six, eight, ten. Yin and yang open and close, and the twelve thousand things possess spirits within. The Six Jia govern them. Without the Six Jia, heaven’s Three Luminaries lose their order; without the Six Jia, earth’s Five Peaks collapse. Without the Six Jia, the Son of Heaven’s hundred officials fall into chaos; without the Six Jia, the Dao student violates its wondrous principles. The Six Jia are the warp and woof of all things. Practicing their Dao, the myriad evils submit, and ghosts and spirits become one’s servants. Thus the Daoist wears them, sitting or standing at will, becoming an immortal who does not die, foreseeing the future.

The *Kaiyuan Scripture* says: The Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure are the hidden writ of the Dao, knotting the qi of soaring mystery into spontaneous chapters. Each character is a zhang square, with eight corners radiating light. They arose before the Primordial Beginning, within the empty cavern, governing the kalpic cycles to ensure heaven’s enduring existence. The Brahma qi pervades the cosmos, and the myriad patterns unfold. All in the ten directions who attained the Dao, all the spirits and immortals—none failed to wear and uphold them, thereby attaining long life, free transformation, command of the hundred spirits, ascent into formlessness, and union with the true Dao.

Wanfu said: The Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure give birth to heaven and earth, divide and transform the Five Phases, merge with qi, exhale and inhale the hundred spirits, ride the cycles of concealment and manifestation, endure through kalpas, revolve through five kalpas, and spread qi through the ten heavens. The Yellow Thearch received them from the Perfected Sovereign of Heavenly Truth and transmitted them to his descendants. Yu of Xia obtained them at Bell Mountain and concealed them in Dongting. When the King of Wu divulged them, his dynastic fortune did not prosper. The Daoist who wears them ensures the Dao never leaves the body. Spirits transform through qi, harmonizing and ordering the heart. Spirit and Dao unite as one, transformation becomes spontaneous, lifespan equals heaven and earth, refining the luminous to enter the true. The body does not perish, surviving the water kalpa alone, merit equaling the great void, virtue merging with spontaneity.

Those who lightly divulge or slander these teachings incur boundless sin, while those who guard them with reverence and care reap enduring blessings. The methods of cultivation are fully set forth in the scriptural texts.

**Eastern and Western Prohibitive Writs**
Wanfu said: These talismans, composed of the combined scripts of the Three Sovereigns, were received by Lord Jie of the White Ram. They subdue tigers, leopards, venomous serpents, wolves, and the myriad spirits of mountains and rivers, preventing them from causing harm. Thus, the mastery of tigers and the taming of serpents are among their effects—matters that Daoists keep secret.

**The True Forms of the Five Peaks**
The *Preface to the True Forms of the Five Peaks* states: Emperor Wu of Han was devoted to the Dao of longevity and frequently offered sacrifices to the sacred mountains in pursuit of immortality. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, on the jiazi day of the first month, he ascended Mount Songgao and established a Daoist palace. After fasting for seven days and completing the rites, he returned. On the wuchen night of the fourth month, while in quiet repose, Dongfang Shuo and Dong Zhongjun were in attendance when suddenly a woman in green robes, of extraordinary beauty, appeared.

The Emperor asked who she was. She replied: "I am the Jade Maiden of the Jade Palace, sent by the Queen Mother of the West from Kunlun Mountain to speak with you. I hear you seek to traverse the four seas, pursue the Dao, and attain longevity, even humbling your imperial rank to offer repeated prayers to the mountains. Your devotion is commendable—one worthy of receiving the teachings of immortality. Fast and purify yourself for a hundred days, abstaining from worldly affairs. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West will come briefly."

The Emperor descended from his seat and knelt in assent. As soon as she finished speaking, the woman vanished without a trace. From that day, the Emperor ascended the Terrace of Seeking the True, maintaining a fast and focusing on the Dao, while entrusting governance to his ministers.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, he ordered the palace to be cleansed and prepared a seat in the grand hall. The ground was spread with purple silk, incense of a hundred fragrances was burned, cloud-patterned brocade curtains were hung, and nine luminous lamps were lit. Grape wine and honey were set out as offerings for host and guest. The Emperor, clad in his finest robes, stood at the foot of the steps, the inner and outer courts silent as they awaited the celestial visitors.

After the second watch of the night, a white cloud suddenly arose in the southwest, drifting steadily toward the palace. Soon, the sounds of flutes, drums, and the clamor of men and horses could be heard within the cloud. After half an hour, the Queen Mother arrived, accompanied by thousands of immortals whose radiance illuminated the courtyard. Among them were fifty celestial beings, each over ten feet tall.

The Queen Mother ascended the hall and sat facing east. She appeared to be around thirty, of perfect stature, her countenance unmatched in the world—a true divine being. After dismounting her carriage and taking her seat, the Emperor knelt and paid his respects. Once the greetings were exchanged, he stood at attention. The Queen Mother then invited him to sit and personally prepared a feast of extraordinary delicacies, unlike anything found in the mortal realm, their sweet fragrance beyond description.

The Emperor noticed a small scroll in the Queen Mother’s sash, encased in a purple brocade pouch. When he inquired about it, she showed him the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. "This was issued by the Supreme Lord of the Three Heavens," she said. "Its script is secret and heavily guarded—how could one of your impure constitution be worthy to wear it? In the first year of the Qingxu era of the Supreme Sovereign, the Supreme Lord of the Three Heavens descended to observe the six directions, measuring the length of rivers and seas, assessing the height of mountains and hills. Following the contours of mountain sources and the winding paths of rivers and peaks—where ridges turn and mounds curve, where mountains rise and valleys stretch—he discerned shapes resembling written characters. Thus, he modeled their forms, assigned them names, and inscribed their true shapes upon the Dark Terrace, producing these talismans as tokens of divine authenticity. All immortals wear them as seals of transmission. When Daoists carry them through mountains and rivers, the myriad spirits and deities honor and welcome them."

The earnestness of your heart moves me, and so I now entrust this to you. You must honor and guard it as you would your lord and father. Should you reveal it to the unworthy, calamity will surely befall you. The rule is this: after forty years, you may transmit it to one person; if no worthy recipient appears in forty years, you may then transmit it to two after eighty years. To confer it upon the unworthy is to leak the Dao of Heaven; to withhold it from one who is worthy is to seal away Heaven’s treasure; to bestow it recklessly without regard for the time is to treat the Heavenly Elder lightly; to receive it without reverence is to slight Heaven’s ornament. These four—leakage, sealing, frivolity, and disdain—are the chariots that extend misfortune. Leakage brings death upon the road, your body buried in earth, your form soaked and your bones shattered; sealing brings blindness and deafness in the next life, your fate withered and your end unjust; frivolity brings misfortune upon your parents, and upon reaching the Dark Capital, you will face punishment; disdain brings a violent end and descent into evil, or affliction by foul diseases in later lives. There are even graver transgressions than these: the severing of your lineage and the annihilation of your clan. Those of the same Dao are called Heaven’s kin; those of the same heart are called Earth’s beloved. In transmission, you must cherish one another, sharing honor and disgrace alike. Cultivate the true unity of the heart, treasure and preserve your essence, and together nurture harmonious qi. When qi is whole and spirit returns, you will surely ascend to the assembly of the numinous. Should you fail in this, Heaven will send down affliction upon you. These are the statutes and prohibitions of the Dao—you cannot but be cautious.

If you wish to transmit it, Dong Zhongjun is the one. Once the transmission was complete, another talisman was taken, and the Queen Mother of the West personally handed it to the Emperor, who knelt and received it with two bows. The Queen Mother said, “Return in three years, and I will teach you the Dao.” After meeting the Queen Mother, the Emperor came to believe in the existence of divine immortals throughout the world and began to contemplate leaving the mortal realm. Yet he indulged in lust and gave free rein to his nature, ceaseless in warfare and killing. The people sighed under the burden of labor, and the dead lamented their innocence. He did not heed the Sacred Mother’s words and never returned. The scriptures and talismans she had given him were stored in a phoenix-shaped vessel of yellow gold, sealed in a casket of white jade, and placed upon the Cypress-Beam Terrace. Later, in the first year of the Taichu era, heavenly fire consumed the terrace, and all was lost in the flames. The Queen Mother had brought this disaster upon him for his failure to follow her instruction. However, the Emperor had earlier heeded her words and transmitted the talismans to Dong Zhongjun, who made copies, and thus they were preserved.

Lu Nüsheng, a native of Changle, loved the Dao from a young age. She abstained from grain for over eighty years, yet her complexion remained like peach blossoms, and in a single day she could travel three hundred li. Over two hundred years after she was first seen, while gathering herbs on Mount Song, she suddenly encountered the attendants of the Supreme Lord of the Three Heavens, who bestowed upon her the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* and instructed her in their use and regulations. Nüsheng attained the Dao. One day, she entered the depths of Mount Hua. Fifty years later, those who had known her before encountered her before the shrine of Mount Hua, riding a white deer and accompanied by thirty jade maidens. She sent them to greet her hometown kin, and the faces of those she met were unmistakable.

The versions of this talisman that have appeared in the world originate from two: Dong Zhongjun and Nüsheng. Zhongjun, before departing, transmitted it to Le Ba, while Nüsheng transmitted it to Feng Junda.

Ge Hong said, “In the past, Master Bai Zheng possessed the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, yet no one in Wu or Yue received it. I wonder, do you have it, Master?”
Master Zheng replied, “I seem to possess it, but the prohibitions on transmission are strict, and it cannot be recklessly disclosed. Since your heart is so earnest, I will tell you—but do not spread it further. My predecessor received this text from Master Green Ox. Since I received the talisman, I have transmitted it to no one, but now I shall bestow this text upon you.” The methods of use and regulations all derive from Master Zheng.

Master Green Ox said, “My family possesses the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. Each peak dispatches five spirits to guard and protect the talismans and texts. For those whose dwellings are near mountains and rivers, the spirits of the mountains and marshes also regularly send attendants to defend the body and safeguard the household. Should the wicked seek to harm you, their misfortune will rebound upon them. It repels the five weapons and the five pestilences—you may wear it to tread upon blades. When you carry this text to traverse mountains and forests, the officials and spirits who govern the earth’s veins of all the mountains will come forth from their domains to bow in welcome. Even the spirits of a noble kingdom, who hold fast to the rites of humility, pay such reverence—how could a mere mortal dare to treat it with negligence?”

Wan Fu said, “The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* are treasured by the highest sages, the loftiest perfected, and the divine immortals. When Daoists wear them and travel through mountains and marshes, the spirits of a thousand mountains and a hundred rivers all come forth to welcome them. Those whose households possess this talisman are attended by immortals and guarded by spirits; the ten thousand afflictions lie hidden, and their fortunes flourish. Officials rise in rank, wealth and property accumulate, descendants prosper, and households thrive. Those who cultivate the Dao and honor this talisman will naturally find their method.”

*The Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*
The *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* states: The natural writings of the Three Sovereigns all employ gold and jade. The Heavenly Sovereign received his on dark jade tablets, inscribed with azure jade; the Earthly Sovereign received his on yellow jade tablets, inscribed with white jade; the Human Sovereign received his on red jade tablets, inscribed with yellow jade. They are bound with golden hooks, linked with golden chains, held with jade handles, and covered with pearl-embroidered cloth. They are perfumed with the five fragrances and adorned with the ten blossoms. Jade lads and jade maidens wield fly-whisks at their sides, while perfected officials and immortal functionaries attend to their comings and goings. Lions that repel evil, unicorns, phoenixes, green dragons, white tigers, dark warriors, vermilion birds, numinous birds, sacred beasts, boundless musicians, the six jia and six ding spirits, the three and five attendants—all guard and protect, serving these writings.

Wan Fu said, “The writings of the Three Sovereigns are the *Scripture of the Cavernous Divine*, also called the *Three Sovereigns of the Cavernous Immortals*. Those who receive them can summon and command the myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth and the hundred essences. Daoists who wear them transform their forms and fly through the void, moving in and out naturally. They can call forth clouds and bring down rain, command ghosts and spirits, and achieve their desires instantly. They prolong life and extend years, attain blessings in life and death, and enjoy boundless fortune.”

Here ends the first scroll of *An Outline of the Transmission of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures, Precepts, and Registers*.

**An Outline of the Transmission of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures, Precepts, and Registers, Scroll the Lower**

**The Orthodox Daoist Law of the Three Heavens and the Jade Writ for Eliminating the Six Heavens**

The Dao says: I was born within the vast and boundless, in the depths of darkness and obscurity.
Within the depths of darkness and obscurity, life arose from the Cavernous Void.
Within the Cavernous Void, life arose from the Great Nothingness.
The Great Nothingness transformed, and the Three Qi became luminous.
The Three Qi merged in primordial chaos, giving birth to the Great Void.
From the Void, the Cavern was established; from the Cavern, entry into Nothingness; from Nothingness, Being arose; from Being, the Void was established.
The transformation of Void and Nothingness gave rise to the natural from the empty.
The upper qi is called *Beginning*; the middle qi, *Origin*; the lower qi, *Mystery*.
The *Mystery* qi was born from the Void; the *Origin* qi was born from the Cavern; the *Beginning* qi was born from Nothingness.
Thus, the One gave birth to the Two; the Two gave birth to the Three; the Three transformed and generated, extending to the Nine Mysteries.
From the Nine, returning to the One—this is entering the true Dao.

The pure qi formed Heaven; the turbid sediment congealed into Earth.
The middle qi harmonized to become Man.
The Three Qi divided and differentiated, and the myriad transformations received life.
The sun and moon arrayed their illumination, the Five Celestial Lodges shone brilliantly upon the Upper Three Heavens.
Born from the essence of the Three Qi, dwelling above the utmost height, reaching the limitless—thus it is called the *Limitless*.
It treads where the great cycles cannot alter, endures where the great kalpas cannot change.
Encompassing the true and the lofty void, it may be called supreme—hence the name *Orthodox Daoist Law of the Three Heavens*.

The names of the Nine Heavens also arise from the Three; the Three Qi generate the Three, thus they are called the Nine Heavens.
The Six Heavens govern the people, responding to transformations and following the cycles.
With the revolutions of the sun and moon, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the qi of Heaven and Earth reverse, minor kalpas intersect, the myriad emperors change places, and the Nine Qi alter their courses.
At such times, the wicked and defiled perish, while the virtuous people endure.
When the great kalpa turns, Heaven overturns and Earth upends, seas surge and rivers burst their banks.
The myriad evils are extinguished, ghosts and demons vanish without trace, and of the eight wastes and four extremities, not one in ten thousand remains.
Unless one diligently cultivates meditative contemplation, wears the *Jade Writ for Eliminating the Six Heavens*, and practices the *Orthodox Daoist Law of the Three Heavens*, one cannot escape this calamity—only then may one welcome the Sagely Lord at the Palace of Supreme Clarity.

The *Jade Writ for Eliminating the Six Heavens* was bestowed by the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning.
The qi of *Beginning Azure* and *Flying Mystery* coalesced into jade writ, announcing to the Six Heavens that as the cycles turn and the courses intersect, qi is gathered, spirits are restrained, and all return to the earth above.
Those who wear the Heaven of *Orthodox Unity’s* Primordial Birth command numinous spirits and govern qi, their majesty subduing the ten directions.
They emerge from the Void and enter Nothingness; the myriad Dao open and unfold.
They endure where the great kalpas cannot destroy, tread where the vast waves cannot drown.
The myriad spirits bow their heads; the Five Marchmounts dispatch their attendants.
Six hundred youthful attendants and sixty jade maidens guard and protect the wearer of this writ.
The Most High treasures it, secreting it within the Purple Chamber of the Six Directions, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas.

The Most High received it from the True King of the Nine Heavens.
The Primordial Lord received it from the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens.
The Yellow Emperor received it from the Primordial Lord of the Most High.
The Queen Mother of the West received it from the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning.
The Four Extremities received it from the Youth of the Eastern Sea.
The Perfected of Purple Yang received it from the Grand Master of the Most High.
Ning Feng received it from the August Lord of the Clear Heaven.
Tang Yao received it from the Sagely Lord of Later Ages.

After Tang, seven thousand people obtained this writ, all of whom rode dragons and soared through the void.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Jade Dawn and Phoenix Terrace, the Pure and Refined Upper Canon* states:
Within the Nine Bends of the Dark Capital stands the towering Phoenix Terrace.
The qi of the natural phoenix coalesces to form a jade chamber, dwelling above the Nine Heavens and to the south of the Jade Capital.
The empty gives birth to the qi of the Eight Convergences and True Union, ten turns and nine bends, penetrating the eight directions.
Above, it summons the pinions of the whirlwind; beside, it connects the luminous to the Dark Terrace.
Each character spans a *zhang*, its script resplendent and radiant, illuminating the Nine Heavens.
A phoenix soars with a cloud canopy; purple qi swirls in the deep.
Stag-like beasts gambol and prance; six-maned lions guard the lower gates.
The Jade Immortals of the Five Emperors wield five-colored banners of numinous command to subdue the five directions.
To the right stand the Jade Maidens of Great Flower; to the left, the Golden Immortals and Jade Youths, three thousand each.
They attend the Perfected, tending incense, with the sun and moon flanking in splendor.
The Seven Origins revolve in numinosity; the Three Dawns align in brilliance.
Mysterious light shines through the void; jade groves sway their branches.
Jade flutes resound in the courtyard; the radiance of the Seven Treasures flows and gleams in Supreme Clarity.
This is the domain of the Supreme Lord of the Jade Dawn and the Great Dao.
The Elder of the Dark Capital, with the true script of the Phoenix Writ and the melodies of *Care* and *Joy*, transmitted them in mystery to the Lord of the Dao.

Thus, the myriad Perfected of the Upper Heavens and the flying immortals of the Five Marchmounts all ascend the Phoenix Terrace on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—three times a month—to offer incense in reverent rotation and chant the verses of *Care* and *Joy*.
Above, they celebrate the divine Perfected; below, they lament the mortal people.
Their words are subtle and empty, jade-bright and penetratingly clear.
The Four Perfected bow in reverence; the myriad immortals chant in harmony.
Incense scatters into the empyrean; fragrant smoke drifts through the empty courtyard.

All who have attained Perfection in the Upper Palaces, as well as those who have just begun the path to immortality, must cultivate the true script of the *Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi* and the *Dark Mound*, and recite the melodies of *Care* and *Joy*.
In ancient times, this was transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas.
Now, if there are worthy recipients, within seven hundred years, three transmissions may be permitted.
Those who obtain this writ may soar to Supreme Clarity, ascend the Nine-Bend Phoenix Terrace, and pay homage to the Jade Perfected.
To lightly disclose it is to lose one’s sight; the seven generations of ancestors will bear the blame.
Be cautious, and you shall become a divine immortal.

The Most High bestowed it upon the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, who transmitted it to the Great Lord Azure Youth of the Square Vessel of the Eastern Sea, instructing him to pass it to Daoist practitioners whose names are inscribed in gold and who are destined to become divine immortals and Perfected Ones.
Those who wear it shall behold the Three Primordial Lords welcoming the Sagely Lord at the Golden Watchtower of Supreme Clarity.

Wan Fu said: That which transforms endlessly does not transform.
That which generates ceaselessly does not generate.
Not transforming, it endures forever without perishing; not generating, it remains eternal without collapse.
This Dao is wondrous and numinous—through cultivation, one may attain and obtain it.
All that possesses form is the qi entrusted by the Dao.
Containing essence and connecting with the numinous, awareness arises of itself, movement proceeds of itself.
Discerning as the sun and moon, wise as Heaven and Earth, thoughts surpassing ghosts and spirits, wondrously harmonizing yin and yang—none of this exists apart from the Dao, for the divine principle resides within it.

Should one aspire to extend lifespan across vast kalpas, to snatch the withered spirit from myriad heavens, to turn back the profound and embrace the radiant, to ascend to truth and guard the primordial—then through ten thousand kalpas, time remains unbegun; through a thousand cedars, the countenance stays youthful. In a single instant, one circulates the heavens and earth; within the breast, one commands wind and thunder. Nurturing all beings, serving as mentor to the host of perfected ones, spreading celestial compassion through universal wisdom, acting as the benevolent father of the original source—who but the Dharma King of the Primordial Beginning and the mysterious scriptures of the Most High could accomplish such transformation?

Yet the foolish, unaware of the transformations of the great Dao and the majesty of the Primordial Beginning, do not believe in the immortality of divine immortals. To reverse aging and halt the years is to them like the morning mushroom, ignorant of dusk and dawn; like the cicada, oblivious to spring and autumn. Alas, how grievous!

Moreover, the heavens revolve and stars turn, the earth rests still while rivers flow. The four qi generate and complete, the five phases intermingle and intersect. Wind and clouds gather and disperse, cold and heat give rise to life and death—yet who is the master that governs them? It is the numinous transformations of the supreme Dao, which distributes spirit and spreads qi, weaving a net of governance to preside over all. Though the five billion heavens and three thousand worlds, the divine immortals and sagely venerables, open realms and establish domains, expound the Dharma and teach transformation, manifesting boundless appearances—all their true and responsive Dharma-bodies, their numinous responses beyond measure—what unifies them is none other than the Primordial Beginning.

Even the human body—walking with feet, grasping with hands, seeing with eyes, hearing with ears, speaking with mouth, inhaling with nose, perceiving with mind, cognizing with intent—with po soul at rest and hun soul in motion, skin and flesh residing externally, sinews and bones sustaining internally, blood and vessels nourishing and defending, moving day and night—could there be no sovereign to govern it? Indeed, it is the Director of Destinies who receives life, the Peach Lord who preserves essence, the White Prime who nurtures the po, the Non-Ultimate who controls the hun. The twenty-four Perfected harmonize and regulate the hundred spirits, while the Primordial Father of the Grand One unifies and commands this body. In emptiness and stillness, it endures forever without collapse; in restlessness and agitation, it perishes in an instant.

Humans arise from the void and natural spontaneity, receiving spirit and embracing awareness, serene and clear in competition. Yet after receiving form, myriad desires arise and afflictions multiply. In this world, they encounter the three disasters, nine calamities, ten sufferings, eight hardships—pain and itching, ache and soreness, birth, aging, sickness, and death—vexations that torment form and spirit. In death, the hun soul enters dark prisons, enduring all manner of torments, day and night subjected to interrogation and torture, the soul and spirit in anguish. Through countless kalpas, none can escape on their own.

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, beholding the sentient beings, holds them dear in heart. Thus, he distributes spirit and spreads transformation, descending in traces to connect with the mundane. In the heavens above and the human realm below, he roams and teaches, multiplying his body a hundred thousandfold, scattering his radiance a billion times over. Adapting to conditions and karmic affinities, he broadly expounds the scriptural teachings, desiring that all beings escape suffering and forever avoid the wheel of rebirth. The Dharma-gate of today and the past remains ever the same.

The scriptures say: "To contemplate the subtle and stabilize the will is to bring peace to the spirit, focus on the Dao, and preserve the body. *Contemplating the subtle* means recalling the moment of first receiving life, when the spirit was originally pure. *Stabilizing the will* means eliminating all delusive thoughts and cutting off discursive thinking."

What causes life? The spirit resides within form. What causes death? Qi departs from the body. If you desire long life, stabilize the heart-mind. The body contains a hundred spirits, with the heart-mind as their master. Thus, the *Laozi’s Scripture of Inner Contemplation* states: "The heart-mind is restraint—master of the entire body, restraining form and spirit, preventing them from straying into error."

The heart-mind is spirit. This spirit—neither blue nor white, neither red nor yellow, neither large nor small, neither short nor long, neither curved nor straight, neither soft nor hard, neither thick nor thin, neither round nor square—transforms beyond measure, blending yin and yang. Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it enters the tip of a hair. Restrained, it is upright; released, it is wild. In clarity and stillness, it lives; in turbidity and agitation, it perishes. Illuminating the eight directions, it darkens and loses one corner.

Only by maintaining emptiness and quiescence does the Dao of life naturally endure. Preserving non-action, the body flourishes. The world, being formless, cannot be named. Fortune and misfortune, good and ill—all proceed from it.

It is also said: "Receiving one’s allotment from the Dao is called *ming* (destiny); receiving form from the One is called *xing* (nature). Responding to things is called the *heart-mind*; the heart-mind’s recollection is called *yi* (intent); the direction of intent is called *zhi* (will); knowing all things is called *zhi* (wisdom); wisdom pervading the myriad things is called *hui* (discernment); that which communicates life is called the *Dao*."

The Dao—existing yet without form, non-existent yet possessing sentiment—transforms beyond measure, connecting with the spirit of all living beings. Within the human body, it becomes spirit and illumination—this is cultivating the heart-mind. Thus, to teach people to cultivate the Dao is to teach them to cultivate the heart-mind; to teach people to cultivate the heart-mind is to teach them to cultivate the Dao.

The Dao cannot be seen; it is made manifest through life. Life cannot be eternal; it is preserved through the Dao. If life perishes, the Dao is abandoned; if the Dao is abandoned, life perishes. When life and Dao unite as one, there is long life without death, transformation into a divine immortal.

People fail to preserve this because they do not inwardly contemplate the heart-mind. When inner contemplation is not neglected, the Dao of life constantly abides.

It is also said: "The Dao is attained through the heart-mind; the heart-mind is illuminated through the Dao. When the heart-mind is illuminated, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the heart-mind is connected."

The spirit and illumination within the body are like fire within a lamp. Fire arises from fire, the stove sustains the wick, oil moistens oil, the lamp holds all four. If any one is lacking, how can illumination arise? Likewise, illumination depends on the spirit’s radiance, the spirit relies on the heart-mind’s sustenance, the heart-mind exists through form, and form is perfected through the Dao. If any single element is missing, on what can illumination depend?

Thus, what is called *spirit and illumination* refers to the eyes seeing, ears hearing, mind knowing, body sensing—discerning the subtlest principles of things, all known through the spirit’s illumination. Hence, it is called *spirit and illumination*.

Laozi said: "To speak of an *empty heart-mind* is to dispel its fullness. To speak of *no heart-mind* is to remove its existence. To speak of a *stable heart-mind* is to keep it unmoving. To speak of a *peaceful heart-mind* is to prevent it from being imperiled. To speak of a *still heart-mind* is to keep it from being disordered."

A *correct heart-mind* is one that is kept from deviance. A *pure heart-mind* is one that is made untainted. A *clean heart-mind* is one that is kept from filth. These all refer to what already exists, now to be removed.

A *straight heart-mind* does not waver or reverse. A *level heart-mind* has no highs or lows. A *lucid heart-mind* is not dim or obscure. A *penetrating heart-mind* is not obstructed. These all arise from naturalness itself.

To speak roughly of these several points is to leave the rest to reflection. Those who study the Dao must observe them closely.

Now, the teachings of the Three Caverns—with their myriad arts and thousand methods—though varying in breadth and depth, all serve to govern the human heart-mind. Yet the heart-mind may be bright or dim, wisdom shallow or deep, for the vessels of form differ in purity, and the endowment of *qi* varies in thickness. Still, right and wrong, likes and dislikes, joy and anger, approach and retreat—all proceed from the heart-mind. If one does not know this heart-mind, whose command does it follow? If its stability depends on the heart-mind, how does the heart-mind itself fall into ruin?

Tracing its root, one finds no source; examining its flow, one reaches no end. Yet in investigating its beginning and end, one ultimately returns to naturalness. Let us attempt to discuss this:

The Dao, through a single movement, generates the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things arise from the One, each generating the next. In the human body, this is the *hun*-soul of Lord Lao, also called *Dao-awareness*. That which illumines and gives life to my spirit is my *hun*-soul, also called *my awareness*. Since the body arises from the One, and the spirit is illumined by the Dao, the heart-mind arises from the spirit’s illumination. Thus, when the spirit is manifest, the heart-mind is bright; when the spirit is hidden, the heart-mind is dull. The spirit’s concealment or revelation depends on the heart-mind’s purity or turbidity.

For example, when oil is clear, the lamp shines brightly; when oil is turbid, the light is faint. The scripture says: "The heart-mind is the spirit, the spirit is the heart-mind; heart-mind and spirit are not separate." Thus, the heart-mind is illumined by the spirit, and the scripture’s lamp metaphor holds true. Let the wise examine this carefully.

**Precepts, Faith, and Ranks of Attainment**
When one first enters the gate of the Dao, one first receives the various precepts to prevent transgressions and halt offenses. Next, one wears talismans to restrain malevolent spirits and protect the central *qi*. Then, one receives the *Five Thousand Characters*, which expounds the origins of the Dao and virtue in generation and transformation. Next, one receives the *Three Sovereigns*, gradually ascending the lesser vehicle, moving from the coarse to the subtle. Then, one receives the *Numinous Treasure*, advancing to the middle vehicle, turning spirit into wisdom. Finally, one receives the *Cavern of Perfection*, refining the subtle to return to the formless, reverting to the source and returning to the One, attaining the eternal Dao.

The scripture says: "Knowing the constant, one is tolerant; being tolerant, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one accords with Heaven; according with Heaven, one accords with the Dao; according with the Dao, one endures. Though the body perish, one is not imperiled." This means that though heaven and earth may pass away, the self remains eternally, never in danger.

The Dao is attained through the heart-mind, and the heart-mind is penetrated by the Dao. Sincerity moves the spirit, and the spirit descends to connect. Thus, the ancients sought the heart-mind, while the people of the latter age seek wealth. The ancients, without the heart-mind, did not transcend the world; the people of the latter age, without wealth, do not attain immortality. Therefore, wealth must correspond to the heart-mind, and when the heart-mind is illuminated, wealth appears.

For example, when worldly people seek a beloved partner, a fine treasure, or a cherished object—whatever the heart desires—they spare no expense. This fleeting pleasure delights the heart and pleases the eye, and they exhaust all they possess. How much more so for the true Dao—should it not be prized?

Yet worldly people惜财不受经， begrudge wealth and refuse the scriptures, unwilling to honor the teacher and revere the Dao. They dismiss immortals as empty talk and long life as natural, is this not lamentable? The sages skillfully employ expedient means to seek the heart-mind: sometimes offering the Seven Treasures to invoke the spirits, sometimes administering the Six Vows to transmit the Dao. There is indeed a reason—how could this be in vain? They ensure the scriptures and Dao circulate freely, the human and the divine unite in harmony, faith and practice remain unerring, and master and disciple do not transgress. **Seven Verities**

The Seven Treasures are: first, gold and silver; second, coral; third, amber; fourth, giant clam; fifth, agate; sixth, true pearl; seventh, jasper. Alternatively, they are listed as lapis lazuli, ivory, white jade, true pearl, giant clam, agate, and amber.

In meaning: The Dao transforms through the One Qi into the Three Qi, and the Three Qi transform into the Nine Qi. Each of the Nine Qi generates Three Qi, forming the Thirty-Six Heavens, penetrating without obstruction—this is called the realm of the Dao, the Heaven within Heaven. From this point downward, the Two Qi descend and flow, dividing into the Five Phases. Primordial harmony descends as essence, congealing the hun-soul to form the body. The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother scatter the Five Spirits within the human form, known as the Five Viscera. Externally, they connect to the Seven Orifices, illuminating the Seven Origins. They contain yin and exhale yang, nurturing the spirit and cultivating qi, becoming the treasures of this body—hence the Seven Treasures. As the kidneys store paired essence, gold and silver are included together.

The Primordial Five Elders govern the Five Directions. The Three and Five radiate their brilliance, binding the spirits to the Five Viscera. Thus, these Seven Treasures are offered upward to inform the luminous spirits, verifying the sincerity of my heart-mind, hoping to commune with the divine Dao.

**Twenty-four taels of gold and silver**
In meaning: The Twenty-Four Lofty Perfected of the Purple Tenuity divide their spirits to descend and be born within the human body, preserving the spirit and nurturing qi. Transformations occur naturally—emerging from being, entering non-being, regulating the hundred passages, and circulating qi and blood. Because the Twenty-Four Lofty Perfected are ever-present, it is said they stabilize the Twenty-Four Qi of life.

**Nine taels of superior gold**
In meaning: When a person receives life, the qi of the Nine Heavens descends. Turning yellow to white, embracing the One and holding to the primordial, day and night transform to complete this body. By the ninth month, the spirits are fully formed, and the Director of Destinies announces to the spirits. Myriad spirits attend and guard, and thus life is granted. Therefore, one swears to the Nine Heavens, verifying the origin of life.

**Ten gold rings**
In meaning: Heaven revolves and earth rotates; yin and yang generate and complete. The sun rises in the east and the moon sets in the west; day and night divide their positions. The celestial sphere measures three hundred and sixty-five degrees. Dividing each degree by four, yin and yang unfold—this is the constant Dao of heaven. A year has twelve months; the Four Seasons generate and transform. Qi circulates through the Ten Heavens. Thus, one verifies and informs the Ten Directions, communicating sincerity to the Ten Poles. Then the divine Dao is heard near and far, and true spirits descend upon the body.

**Three gold dragons and twenty-seven gold toggles**
In meaning: The dragon, chief of scaled creatures, embodies the qi of Lesser Yang and contains the essence of Jupiter. It is the numinous beast of wood, transforming freely. Thus, the Seven Eastern Constellations are symbolized as the Azure Dragon. Qi turns through the Five Directions or pervades the Nine Directions. Depending on context, there are names such as Five Dragons, Six Dragons, and Nine Dragons. Those who attain the Dao ride them as one rides a horse in the world. Hence, it is said in worldly affairs: "Dragons ride the heavens; horses traverse the earth." The reason for using dragons here is to transmit reports, informing the celestial and terrestrial bureaus of the merits and faults of those who study the Dao. Toggles control the dragons, like the bit and bridle of a horse.

**Gold dragon and jade tablet with written text**
In meaning: A person’s lifespan—long or short, good or evil—wealth or poverty, foolishness or wisdom, success or failure, fortune or misfortune—even the grasses, trees, insects, and fish, wind, clouds, hail, and sleet—all arise from Heaven. Heaven is governed by the Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Culmen, who, though high, hears the lowly and examines human good and evil, overseeing gains and losses. If one is utterly sincere, Heaven is moved. Thus, good and evil arise from the heart, and fortune and misfortune respond from Heaven. The sages, with boundless compassion, employ expedient means to save and guide, urging one to turn from evil and follow good. They pray to the Supreme Mystery, composing words of supplication, inscribing them on tablets, and presenting them to Heaven. The officers and soldiers within the body, the spirits of good and evil, the Four Controllers, Five Emperors, and local earth deities—all report to the Three Bureaus of the Most High, informing the various heavens and earths, the palaces of the sun and moon, the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus, and the Twenty-Four Thousand Spirit Offices. They command so-and-so to record good deeds, cease evil, extend the short, and prolong the long. Examples include the Duke of Zhou’s *Metal-Bound Casket*, Confucius’s *Original Destiny*, Ziwei’s moving of stars, and Lu Yang’s turning back the sun. Thus, the tablet is the petition’s text; the jade, the token of sincerity; and the dragon, the courier of transmission—like tribute from all directions, listing words and items, hastening to the imperial court.

**Gold rings and jade rings**
In meaning: A ring is round and unobstructed, empty yet not stagnant. Gold is hard and can cut; jade is soft yet unyielding, pure and unchanging, radiant and moist. It urges practitioners to sever the net of the world, follow and comply with the scriptures and Dao, harmonize with the age and blend with its light, abiding among the ordinary without defilement. Externally, one does not stagnate in circumstances; internally, the heart-mind remains ever-empty. Seeing things and emotions arise, attachments naturally cease—this is the pivot of the beginning, for the ring’s continuity before and behind the heart-mind is unbroken.

**Broken ring**
In meaning: Severing worldly affection and forging a bond with the teacher, discarding life and death forever, the scriptures and Dao continue in succession. This is also the teacher and disciple sharing a single heart, their strength like metal that can be cut. Gold represents righteousness, and righteousness can sever and divide. Removing evil and pursuing good, internally cutting the net of doubt, externally discarding cravings—then delusive thoughts and afflictions are forever dispelled.

**Fifty or one hundred feet of plain silk, weighing five or ten taels**
In meaning: Plain silk is naturally pure, soft, bright, and clean. It adapts to things with grace, blending with the world’s dust and light. It strings pearls and jade, weaving brocade and damask—worn by sages or clothed by ordinary people, treasured alike in heaven and among humans. It urges practitioners to purify body and heart-mind, harmonizing internally and externally, removing rigidity and avoiding defilement by filth. Then humans and gods protect, immortals and sages descend, and the subtle and wondrous, difficult to fathom, become supremely treasured. The Five Responses correspond to the Five Qi, the Five Virtues to the Five Directions; the Hundred Responses to the Hundred Spirits, the Hundred Passages to the Hundred Knots. Inches and feet have their divisions—one must know short and long; taels and things align—one naturally discerns light and heavy.

**Azure Silk**
*Exegesis:* Azure is the color of heaven, hoping to connect qi with the celestial. It is also the color of the eastern direction, fostering the arising of goodness. It urges practitioners to follow the Dao as heaven does, nurturing all beings with compassion, emulating the virtue of spring that nourishes and flourishes all things.

**Severed Hair and Blood-Oath**
*Exegesis:* To cut one’s flesh is a pledge of self-trust, an oath sworn before the luminous spirits.

**Crimson Kerchief, Azure Kerchief**
*Exegesis:* Crimson, a vermilion hue, substitutes for sacrificial blood. Azure, a blue-green shade, replaces fallen hair. True persons do not wish to harm others—this is the transformation of great compassion.

**Five Fragrances**
Aloeswood (one), frankincense (one), white sandalwood (three), *qingmu* (four), clove (five), borneol (seven), cinnabar (three), realgar (four).
*Exegesis:* Scattering the qi of the five perfumes summons the numinous spirits of the five directions.

**Colored Silks**
*Exegesis:* The Five Thearchs record the ledgers of good and evil, and colored silks serve as their medium of exchange. The scriptures state: these are used for the officials of the Five Directions’ primordial elders. The Son of Heaven uses bolts, dukes and kings use *zhang*, and commoners use *chi*, each according to their directional allotment.

**Life-Silk**
*Exegesis:* At birth, heaven grants each person 43,200 breaths, equating to 120 years. Those who do not reach this span have violated heaven and earth, sun and moon, and stars; broken covenants and pledges; betrayed the Dao and their masters; or disobeyed scriptures and precepts—thus the Three Offices diminish their allotted breaths. Hence, patterned silk is offered to the celestial offices to beseech an extension of life, called *life-silk*. Only the Son of Heaven uses 120 bolts of purple silk or gauze; the Empress and Crown Prince are comparable. Others add bolts, *zhang*, or *chi* according to their years—nobles and high officials use bolts, the wealthy use *zhang*, and the poor and lowly use *chi*.

**Life-Rice**
*Exegesis:* Food is the heaven of humans; without it, one dies. Rice is humanity’s sustenance, deeply cherished and hard to forget. The measure of one’s official salary and lifespan depends on the Celestial Treasury and Celestial Emolument. When one’s allotted years are exhausted, rice is offered to replenish the heavenly granaries, hoping to extend a short life. Thus, the *Zhengyi Jing* states: "When breaths are exhausted, extend them; when emolument is exhausted, augment it."

**Golden Ram**
*Exegesis:* The ram kneels to nurse, called the "beast of ritual." It urges practitioners to be filial to their masters and compassionate toward all beings.

**Jade Wild Goose**
*Exegesis:* The wild goose is a yang bird. It migrates south in autumn and north in spring, following yin and yang in its comings and goings. It also flies in formation, knowing its order. This urges practitioners to follow the teachings of the Dao, ensuring their demeanor is measured, their rank understood, and their position never violated.

**Golden Fish, Jade Fish**
*Exegesis:* The fish is a yin creature, messenger of the water officials, carrying dispatches to the River Lord. It also severs the long ledgers of the Northern Thearch and submits petitions to the water officials. Jade is chosen for its purity and whiteness, unchanged even in water. Gold is chosen for its hardness and strength, softened by water—also for its closed mouth, silent and self-contained in yin seclusion.

**Five-Colored Brocade**
*Exegesis:* *Jin* (brocade) means "to restrain." Woven from five colors into patterns, it urges people to attain the Dao amid the five desires. First, one must submit to precepts and prohibitions, restraining the heart-mind.

**Azure Gauze, Purple Gauze**
*Exegesis:* Among silks, gauze is the most delicate and exquisite. Azure and purple are the colors of heaven. Advanced scripture scholars use these refined fabrics to honor their masters, filling the role of ritual garments, hoping to embody subtlety and merge with the Dao.

**Azure Cloth**
*Exegesis:* Azure is purity, also the color of spring. *Bu* (cloth) means "pervasive." It urges practitioners to purify their hearts and rectify their conduct, practicing all teachings universally, cherishing all beings with the benevolence of spring’s warmth. It is also said: immortals eat gold and jade, wear azure and plain cloth—thus gold, jade, azure, and plain cloth are used in covenants. However, this is but one school’s view and not an absolute doctrine.

**Paper, Brush, Ink**
*Exegesis:* Though the celestial bureaus are distant, spirits communicate with the world. To present petitions and express sentiments, written words are essential. Thus, these tools are used to address the celestial offices, ensuring that texts ascend and words are recorded.

**Contracts and Deeds**
*Exegesis:* On the day of receiving the Dao, one petitions the celestial bureaus, earthly courts, the Four Controllers, Five Thearchs, and all gods and immortals to serve as witnesses. The seven ancestors are summoned to oversee, and contracts are sealed before the Five Thearchs. If one later violates the covenant, breaks the pact, betrays the Dao, or disrespects their master, the contract is examined to verify the transgression. This is akin to worldly transactions, where each party holds a deed to ensure trust—it is also called the *Ascension to Heaven Contract*. On the day of attaining the Dao, when passing through the gates of heaven and earth, demon kings and officials verify it. Even in the grottoes of immortals and the bureaus of the heavens, all are examined, like a worldly passport. Examples include the *Zhengyi True Contract*, *Five-Colored Contract*, *Eight Dao Contract*, *Three-Five Contract*, *Dongshen Contract*, *Ascending Mystery Contract*, *Natural Contract*, and *Shangqing Seven Contracts*. Examples of deeds include the *Zhengyi Yellow Deed*, *Three-Five Deed*, *Thirty-Six Sections of Venerable Scriptures Deed*, and *Shangqing Four Deeds*.

**Oath**
*Exegesis:* *Meng* (oath) means "to clarify."

Since mutual trust has yet to be established, one faces the gods to make it manifest. The gods are formless, their offices hidden and unfathomable, with no visible trace. Should one violate the covenant, calamity and punishment will surely follow—this is the proof of their power. By upholding the oath and abiding by the pact, blessings will likewise be without flaw. Yet mortal hearts are easily swayed, and the principles of the divine are difficult to fathom; thus, covenants must be established to bind them, ensuring alignment with the gods and harmony with the Dao.

Such covenants include the *Lingbao* Initial, Intermediate, and Major Oaths.

**Oath**
*Exegesis:* *Shi* (oath) means "to restrain."
It is a spoken pledge of the heart, a vow made before the gods. Through it, one restrains one’s emotions, preventing dissipation and striving toward union with the Dao. The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it without need for oaths, for their resolve is already firm. Those of middling or lesser capacity, however, advance when guided and retreat when opposed; thus, oaths are necessary to restrain their hearts and prevent deviation.

This is the great compassion of the sages’ teaching, urging alignment with the Dao. Having transmitted the method, they further impose precepts and prohibitions to ensure no transgressions occur, that the Dao may be attained. Therefore, in the latter age, the transmission of the Dao invariably requires the joint establishment of oaths. Such oaths include the *Six Oaths*, *Twelve Oaths*, and the like.

The divine Way is formless, the heavenly principle vast and boundless, obscure and unfathomable, beyond the reach of words or debate. Yet if one’s devotion is absolute, resonance will occur, and thus trust is pledged from the heart. With heartfelt trust, wealth becomes轻贱; when wealth is轻贱, the Dao is prized. Despising wealth invites the descent of divine clarity, life may be prolonged, and with longevity, immortality may be attained. No immortal has ever failed to embody transformation and enter into unity with the Dao, abiding in it eternally.

Yet the worldly fail to awaken. They recklessly slander, neglecting external deeds of merit and virtue while inwardly failing to cleanse impurity and purify the spirit. Their hearts brim with greed and filth, their minds cling to love and hatred. They speak idly of entering samadhi, restless as caged apes, boasting of purity while reeking worse than swine in a sty. When one observes those who sit in meditation, their malice only deepens, their defilements grow more evident. Their talk of inner cultivation is hollow, devoid of substance. When hunger, cold, pain, or itching arise, when illness, vexation, or resentment afflict them, they differ not from ordinary people. They feign conformity to the world—alas, how pitiful!

Fools who hear these words may call them slander. Would I risk entanglement in mere words? My intent is only to dispel delusion and guide toward awakening. Let the wise ponder this deeply and not be enslaved by delusion.

Once the ritual implements and pledges are used, they are dispersed in accordance with the scriptures.

Upon examining the scriptures, one finds that the ritual objects are said to originate from the divine continent, beyond the possession of the mundane world. If one wishes to substitute certain items to accommodate the poor and humble, allowing them to enter the Dao as well, such substitutions may be made. For those of wealth and means, however, who are capable of procuring the proper items, no substitutions should be permitted.

Gold, silver, the seven treasures—these belong to emperors, crown princes, empresses, consorts, princesses, dukes, and kings; how could the common and lowly obtain them? Items such as golden dragons, jade dragons, golden fish, jade fish, golden sheep, jade geese, and fine silks are likewise beyond the reach of the impoverished. All may be substituted with other objects.

If strict adherence to the scriptures were required, the Dao would remain forever sealed, and few could be guided into its fold.

Moreover, the ritual implements prescribed in the scriptures belong to the luminous spirits and must be prepared according to their specified forms and categories. The offerings, however, are gifts from disciples to their masters, with no fixed quantity. These may include fine garments, bedding and curtains, mats and cushions, tables and staffs, decorative objects, jars and sandals, carriages and horses, servants and slaves, estates and houses, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silks and brocades, coins, silk fabrics, hairpins and combs, bracelets and rings, grains, flowers, fruits, ritual implements, meditation mats and cushions—anything one possesses may be offered to the Dao and the master. Such offerings may be used to establish temples, ordain disciples, copy scriptures, create images, release living beings, relieve hunger and cold, liberate the lowly to become free, aid prisoners and pardon crimes, broadly practice compassionate rescue, establish fields of merit, awaken the supreme mind, greatly propagate the sublime practice, benefit family and state, succor beings and oneself, and universally aid the three realms where sentient beings suffer. Each may contribute according to their capacity, all at once or as they wish, with no fixed standard.

If one is poor and humble, they may serve the master with labor, enduring hardship without complaint, accompanying them near and far, tending to incense and ritual fires, constructing and maintaining temple halls, planting orchards and gardens, cultivating fields, growing flowers and medicinal herbs, shaving their head and renouncing the body, restraining the self and laboring diligently, sparing not even the smallest effort, working tirelessly day and night to serve the venerable master—through such devotion, they too may attain the Dao.

I have witnessed the Golden Immortal and Jade Perfected Princesses, in the second year of the Jingyun era (711 CE), the year *xinhai*, on the eighteenth day of the first lunar month, the day *jiazi*, within the *Guizhen* Abbey in the imperial palace. There, they approached the Great Master of the Three Caverns, the *Jinzi Guanglu Daifu*, *Honglu Qing*, *Heinei Jun Kaiguo Gong*, *Shangzhuguo*, and Abbot of the *Taiqing* Abbey, Master Shi, to receive the *Lingbao* *Natural Contract of Breaking the Spirit*, the *Middle Covenant* of eight bundles containing forty-seven scrolls, and two registers of true writs, along with talismans, a spirit-staff, and a jade tablet.

They then constructed a three-tiered altar of rammed earth, twelve feet high, adorned with golden lotus patterns and inscriptions in purple gold. Blue silk encircled the altar’s interior. To the east, green brocade; to the south, red brocade; to the west, white brocade; to the north, purple brocade; and at the center, yellow brocade—all serving as mats.

Additionally, there were mats woven of dragon’s whiskers and phoenix plumes, spread upon altars of the Five Directions, each draped in brocade of its corresponding color. Serpentine golden dragons and jade disks were placed to anchor them. Eighteen bolts of azure silk, six of crimson silk, fourteen of white silk, ten of black silk, and twenty-four of yellow silk were arranged in the Five Directions. Two hundred forty bolts of purple silk, four hundred eighty bolts of plain silk, two hundred forty strings of cash, two hundred taels of gold, twenty-five bolts of five-colored cloud brocade, one hundred twenty catties of incense, and an abundance of the Seven Treasures were provided. Five hundred taels of green silk thread, twenty-four thousand sheets of fine paper, two hundred forty brushes and ink sticks each, twelve inscribed knives, thirty-eight sets each of precept-protecting knives and cloths, six golden dragons, and fifty-four golden knobs were all placed within the altar to pledge fealty to the spirit-officials.

Further, there were censers shaped as coiling dragons, dancing phoenixes, auspicious leaves, propitious blossoms, lotus flowers, and lingzhi fungi, along with incense boxes and cases, all crafted of pure gold or silver. There were also paired cranes and twin simurghs, soaring dragons and sinuous phoenixes, embroidered on silk cloths spread across the altars. Depictions of vajra-deva kings, immortal youths and maidens, misty mountains and flowing waters, grasses and trees, insects and fish, sacred beasts and numinous birds, along with rare and wondrous treasures, adorned the embroidered scroll-covers of the scriptures.

Moreover, there were tables carved of jade, inlaid with gold, made of purple sandalwood, white sandalwood, and aloeswood, all fashioned with soaring simurghs and dancing cranes, golden blossoms and jade leaves, exquisitely carved and decorated. There were also caskets of the Seven Treasures, the Nine Immortals, gold, and white jade, used to hold the scriptures. Brocade bags of azure, crimson, plain, purple, and yellow silk, as well as cloud-patterned and five-colored embroidered pouches, were used to store the registers of the Dao.

Additionally, there were cabinets and chests, all adorned with pearls and jade, their craftsmanship and splendor unmatched in the mortal world, unseen by human eyes, and worth countless millions. There were also banners of Perfected Ones, jade youths and maidens, vajra-deva kings, lotus-carved designs, lingzhi-carved patterns, coiling dragons, dancing phoenixes, soaring simurghs, and flying cranes. Some shimmered with misty clouds and radiant sunlight, concealing their forms in swirling mists, with characters that bloomed like flowers and gold and jade strung together. Others bore landscapes and figures, birds and beasts in wondrous forms, auspicious grasses and propitious blossoms, clouds parting to reveal the sun, hung around the four sides of the altar.

Furthermore, there were golden lotus trees, silver lotus trees, Seven Treasures trees, and five-colored blossom trees, numbering in the thousands, arranged above and below the altar and throughout the abbey courtyard, their radiance illuminating all. There were also five-colored floral candles, golden dragon candles, silver simurgh candles, thousand-petaled lotus candles, nine-colored cloud candles, paired-heart lamps, branching-flower lamps, linked-pearl candles, threaded-flower lamps, revolving-wheel spirit lamps, flying-platform numinous lamps, purple-flame orchid lamps, blue-glowing lingzhi lamps, rosy dawn hundred-branch lamps, moonlit thousand-petal lamps, Five Star lamps, Seven Luminaries lamps, Twenty-Eight Constellations lamps, Thirty-Six Heavenly lamps, light-concealing lamps, and smoke-dispelling lamps, casting their glow both within and without.

For fourteen days and nights, they performed the ritual circumambulation and recited the scriptures. When the fast was first inaugurated, auspicious snowflakes drifted like blossoms, and as the true writs were about to be revealed, propitious clouds floated like canopies. In the fourth watch of that night, Lord Lao descended upon the altar and spoke with the princesses. On the day the transmission of the Dao was conferred, five-colored auspicious clouds arose, and fragrant smoke stretched in eight directions.

After the transmission was completed, the two princesses each offered five hundred sets of bedding, couches, and mats, along with musical instruments and secular clothing, as well as ten thousand bolts of plain silk, brocade, and other ritual offerings, their value exceeding ten thousand strings of cash. The ritual objects anchoring the altar were not included in this count.

Later, in the winter of the tenth month, on the twenty-eighth day of the *jiāzǐ* cyclical year of the *Xiāntiān* era (712 CE), they received the Five Methods and the scriptures of the *Highest Clarity* tradition, strictly following the established regulations. A separate altar was constructed in another courtyard, modeled after heaven and earth, round within and square without, adorned with exquisite splendor. The ritual objects, offerings, anchoring silks, and life-bestowing silks surpassed the previous ones by a hundred thousandfold. The scriptures, inscribed in gold on precious scrolls and encased in embroidered brocade covers, were all strung with pearls and jade, unprecedented in any age and beyond description.

Wanfu, considering himself unworthy and of humble virtue, unfit for such an honor, yet by imperial decree was improperly included among the eminent masters attending the altar and the Three Masters witnessing the transmission. Having witnessed this grand ritual, he felt both awe and trepidation at the connection. The princesses’ reception of the Dao is recorded elsewhere. Here, he has roughly documented these events, hoping that ten thousand generations hence, people will recognize the solemn dignity of the Daoist teachings.

Respectfully recorded by Daoist Zhang Wanfu of the Taiqing Abbey on the twelfth day of the twelfth month, the *bǐngshēn* cyclical day, in the *Xiāntiān* era (712 CE), the year of *rénzǐ*.
