Master of the Palace Attendance said:
In former times, I wandered through over two hundred famous mountains. Once, arriving at the Pure Truth Grotto in Jinling—a place where the Tang-dynasty Master Ye cultivated the Dao—I found myself at dusk with no human habitation to rely upon. Gazing into the distance, I suddenly saw a lamp glowing in the mountains. Following its light, I came to a thatched hut, where all was silent and no one was present. My heart was greatly alarmed. Beneath the lamp, upon a table, lay a written text. Opening it, I saw it was titled *The Scripture of Hissing and Roaring Wind and Rain*. I thought it must belong to the Thunder Abode, and my mind was at ease. Taking brush and ink, I copied it onto a leaf. As I neared the end of my transcription, I suddenly heard the crowing of a cock. In an instant, an old woman emerged.

I asked her name and surname. The old woman replied: "I have no name or surname. This is the dwelling place of thunder and lightning. You cannot stay long." I asked: "Why does the crowing of the cock bear this name?" She said: "It is the Golden Cock crowing within the earth." I awoke and departed. After no more than a few steps, I turned back, but the thatched hut had vanished. Soon, after traveling a little over a *li*, I arrived at the Grotto-Heaven. Thus, I obtained the Thunder Scripture, beginning with the Pure Grotto-Heaven.

Disciple Yuan Tingzhi asked:
Master, you obtained the Thunder Scripture in the Grotto-Heaven. I suppose your celestial bearing and Daoist bones were favored by Heaven, which granted you this encounter. Yet in ancient times, one could not attain the Dao without a master. If one has no master, can one still practice?

The Master of the Palace Attendance said:
Before I obtained the Thunder Scripture, I had already met Master Wang by the Yangzi River, who taught me the Way of Flying the Spirit to Audience with the Emperor. Later, while wandering in the Pure Truth Grotto-Heaven, I obtained this scripture. After three years had passed, I again encountered Master Wang at the Junshan Inn. Later, passing by a Chan monastery, he asked me: "How fares your cultivation of the Way of Flying the Spirit to Audience with the Emperor?" I answered Master Wang: "Three years ago, your disciple arrived at the Pure Truth Grotto-Heaven. As dusk fell, I lost my way and found myself in a desolate thatched hut, where a solitary lamp burned upon a lone table. There, I obtained *The Scripture of Hissing and Roaring Wind and Rain* and transcribed it onto my person. Here, I present it to you." Master Wang said: "You are truly a destined immortal. The old woman was the Mother of Lightning. Since you have obtained this scripture, I shall now instruct you in its mysteries." When he had finished teaching, he summoned a messenger and gave instructions to the empty sky. This was my enlightenment under Master Wang’s guidance.

A question was asked:
When thunder is stirred and lightning aroused, what is the essential principle?

The answer:
Thunder and lightning are the commands of Heaven. They must not be rashly invoked unless the matter is urgent. It is like the Bureau of Military Affairs issuing an order to a regional office: those who receive it must act in accordance with the command. Yet people today, lacking innate predisposition and not having met a true master, pass down errors through hearsay. They follow diagrams to seek horses, heedless of the gravity of the matter. Some seek fame or reputation, others pursue profit or wealth, acting recklessly. They claim Heaven’s power as their own, yet when the moment comes, they accomplish nothing. Thunder possesses a precise mechanism; lightning, a decisive method. With a master’s guidance, response follows as echo to sound.

A question was asked:
As for the messengers, where does their profound mystery lie?

The answer:
The transformations of thunder and lightning reach without limit. When the spirit moves, Heaven follows; when *qi* arrives, efficacy is near. Within the inner mystery of the unfathomable and indistinct, you enact the transformations of crashing thunder and surging power. From one comes two, from two comes three, from three come the ten thousand things. Manifesting wondrous function, it ascends to the azure vault and descends to the Yellow Springs—there is nowhere it cannot go. As the Chan school says: "A thousand rivers hold water, a thousand rivers hold the moon; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky." This is precisely it.

A question was asked:
Your disciple has already received your instruction, which has dispelled my dullness. But what is the meaning of "a thousand rivers hold water, a thousand rivers hold the moon; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky"?

The answer:
This expounds the mystery of the messengers. Consider "a thousand rivers hold water, a thousand rivers hold the moon." The original nature of humanity is like the bright moon—one point of perfect clarity, serene and unmoving, its numinous radiance pervading all. Yet people today know only the name of thunder and do not investigate its essence, the original spirit. Water is still water. The world sees only the moon’s form but not its wonder. Only when reflected in water does its nature become still. As for "ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky," the nature of humanity is fundamentally good, yet it is obscured by the seven emotions and six desires. If one can purify the heart and reduce desires, all obstacles vanish, and Heaven becomes visible everywhere.

A question was asked:
The mystery within mystery has been clarified, and your guidance has dispelled my confusion. But how can one verify its efficacy in practice?

The answer:
Your question is apt. When summoning thunder to act, first call the messenger to seek it. For thunder, lightning, wind, and rain are known only to the messenger. Thus, the method requires the messenger to serve as vanguard and sharp general.

A question was asked:
The swiftness of the messengers is indeed divine. Yet when the ancestral palace issues forth, it can be employed in any direction. But in the vast emptiness, how can one verify the messenger’s arrival?

The answer:
The method requires stillness and silence. Knock the teeth, grasp the thunder tally, and summon according to the ritual. Silently recite the incantation, contain the light, and remain still. When the space between your brows itches, the messenger has arrived.

A question was asked:
Formerly, your disciple received your instruction and was taught the ritual method. While at the home of Chen Zishi in Yihuang, I saved a patient by silently summoning the messenger to slay the malevolent spirits. As I sat in meditation, a sudden gust of wind brushed against my feet. Later, I gave the talisman to the patient, who saw the messenger manifest in form. How does this verification differ from your teaching about the itching between the brows?

---

The answer:
The thought arises from a single point, and the response manifests in one’s own body. The head is round, symbolizing Heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing Earth. The verification at the space between the brows means the messenger arrives through the Gate of Heaven. The verification at the feet means the messenger comes through the Door of Earth. Now, the forms, shadows, sounds, and echoes of malevolent spirits exist in the yang realm and are confined to the earth. Thus, when the messenger breaks through the Door of Earth to search for the spirits, the sign of moving thunder is felt from the space between the brows to the depths of the five viscera.

A question was asked:
Your explanation is correct. One day, while at home, I gave a talisman to save a woman in childbirth. As I summoned the general, my heart surged violently, my left eye twitched repeatedly, and when I dispatched the talisman and sent the messenger, my mind was unsettled. I thought the messenger had not arrived, which was why this occurred. The next morning, the family came to express their gratitude, saying the woman had seen a green-faced ghostly messenger with three eyes, fire blazing from them, circling her. She felt her body burning as if on fire, and soon after, she delivered a stillborn child. What does this signify?

The answer:
This is clear verification—how can you be so foolish?

Your heart surged violently, for the moment your ancestral palace’s messenger emerged, the transmission reached your heart—hence the urgency. The green-faced, three-eyed apparition was your spirit transformed by the talisman. The twitching of your left eye: fire returning to the realm of wood. Thus the living mother was spared, while her child was lost. This principle is as clear as daylight—why so much doubt and questioning?

A question was asked:
The swiftness of summoning thunder lies solely with the messenger—then what purpose do the Five Generals of Cheng Yong serve in the method?

The answer:
They are the primordial, indestructible spirit of the Prior Heaven, the very Yuan Shi you now revere. Cheng Yong is the sun and moon; the Five Generals are the five planets. Within the human body, the messenger is the primordial spirit. Cheng Yong is the primordial qi and primordial essence; the qi of the five viscera becomes the Five Generals. On earth, the messenger is the True Sovereign of Later Soil. Cheng Yong corresponds to the Nine Ramparts of Fengdu; the Five Generals correspond to the Five Peaks. For humans dwell at the center of Heaven and Earth, borrowing the Dipper’s revolution to harmonize the Three Powers—this is what is meant by “one aperture opened, ten thousand apertures open; one general efficacious, a hundred generals efficacious.”

In general, why is the messenger’s *gang* pacing singled out as “bubbling spring”?
Water is born of Heaven. Between the second, third, fourth, fifth, and eighth palaces, Heaven and Earth, water and fire, thunder and wind, mountains and marshes—nothing is not encompassed. The pivot and mechanism lie in the position of *kui* and *gang*, which revolve and transform the creative workings of Heaven and Earth. The Five Generals serve as the messengers’ agents.

As the scripture says: “Through unity, all things are accomplished.” The profound mysteries of inner and outer realms truly arise from this.

A question was asked:
The pivot and mechanism are called sun and moon—why then do they reside in *chen* and *xu*?

The answer:
Not so. *Xu* is the sun’s pivot; *chen* is the moon’s mechanism. The key to yin and yang truly lies here. If the pivot of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and stars fails to turn, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is blocked. If scholars do not know the pivot, how can thunder be aroused? How can rain and sunshine be invoked? Within the human body, the Dipper’s pivot turns, and ten thousand transformations follow. As the scripture says: “Gently nudge the Dipper’s handle—forth pours the Silver River by the myriad bushels.” Such is the marvel.

A question was asked:
If Cheng Yong is the sun and moon, and the Five Generals govern metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, how does the earth messenger govern and revolve?

The answer:
The messenger is intent. It is also the Great *Kui* of the Center, the Star of the Grand Overseer.

The *Tanlang* star is called the Star of the Grand Overseer; the messenger, receiving this qi, transforms and gives rise to the Grand Overseer—this is the pivot of the primordial True Qi of the Celestial Pole turning once. How could the celestial mechanism fail to follow? Thus, the messenger’s talisman employs the two taboo names *xin* and *yin*, for there is an explanation.

A question was asked:
Your explanation is thorough, Master, yet your disciple still does not understand.

The answer:
In Heaven, the Dipper follows the handle’s pointer to establish the lunar station. Within a single establishment, there are two qi and six seasonal divisions. If one can, in a single moment, gather the qi of an entire year, then when set in motion, all the affairs of that year—whether auspicious or ominous, rain or shine—are fully encompassed within it. The *Kui* is the Dipper’s head, the pivot of Heaven. Extending this principle, the 384 changing lines of the hexagrams truly originate here. You should follow the Dipper’s movement in your practice. Moreover, the twenty-eight constellations of the four directions each possess their own wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, while the Dipper resides at the center to harmonize the Seven Governors. Among the thirty-six qi, the *Kui* stands at the forefront, revolving them all.

A question was asked:
Your explanation is clear, Master. Yet why is it that today’s scholars, though they neither cultivate accumulation nor possess true learning...

By chance they practice and also achieve resonance—how is this so?
I answer: First, it is due to luck; second, such a person’s fate and circumstances happen to align, yielding temporary efficacy. If you practice my method, you must thoroughly penetrate the inner workings to decisively determine external responses without doubt. When the thunder deities are untimely, if the method and incantation are authentic, what cannot be achieved?

A question was asked:
I have seen two fellow practitioners, You and Ping, who use the same method. Why is it that when they perform rituals, only six or seven out of ten succeed—what is the mechanism behind this?
I answer: The Dao affinity of You and Ping is shallow, their practice of the method is not yet refined, and their hearts waver between doubt and belief. Thus, only six or seven out of ten succeed.

A question was asked:
As for my own practice, I sit in meditation at dawn, setting a fixed time to await the response. Why is it that when I ascend the altar, the outcome does not match the talisman’s intent—what is the reason for this?
I answer: Sitting in meditation merely uses the thunder deities as a talismanic token. When people have matters to address, they may petition the Emperor in one way, report to the master in another, or dispatch the generals in yet another. Even when setting a time, they cannot fix it precisely—sometimes choosing the *wei* or *shen* hour, other times the *hai* or *zi* hour—thus causing confusion and disorder, which is why the response does not arrive as scheduled. If you set the *shen* hour, then adhere to *shen*; if you set the *wei* hour, then adhere to *wei*—like the fire of Mount Li, which was agreed to be lit at a specific time. If it is not done so, trust is lost. Those who practice thunder methods must deeply reflect on this.

A question was asked:
Some say that petitioning the Emperor may lead to errors in practice—how is this?
I answer: Petitioning the Emperor is effective only if you can project your own spirit to make the report. If you merely rely on written words, waiting for the master to compile and submit the petition, errors will inevitably occur.

A question was asked:
The True Kings have teachings on acting at one’s discretion—does this mean petitions are unnecessary?
I answer: Even with discretionary action, there are two considerations. For major afflictions that disturb human souls and destinies, or when malevolent dragons recklessly stir thunderstorms, harming people and things, as well as matters that should not be reported, discretionary action is permitted. However, if the matter concerns heavenly decrees, you must project your spirit to petition and await the imperial decree before acting.

A question was asked:
Some texts mention "celestial mechanisms" and "thunder mechanisms"—what do these mean?
I answer: Indeed, they exist. The "celestial mechanism" refers to the rotation of the Dipper’s stars, the cycle of the twenty-eight constellations, the surging of the thirty-six leaps, and the clashing of the twenty-four *qi*’s *gangsha*, where mutual opposition and alignment can stir thunder and lightning. As for the "thunder mechanism," it is the creation within the palm, the domain where divine thunder rises, falls, appears, and vanishes—observing where wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning gather, and employing the flying *gang* wheel incantations to command the thunder deities.

A question was asked:
What is the essential method for refining the generals?
I answer: The generals are a single *qi*. You emit your own *qi* to merge with Heaven’s *qi*. From this single *qi*, all other *qi* arise—these are the turbid *qi* within the human body. You must absorb Heaven’s pure *qi* and blend them thoroughly before refining. Refining *qi* relies entirely on the workings of the five waters and five fires. Without refinement, the *qi* of thunder lacks divinity.

A question was asked:
When commanding thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, one must verify the effects during seated practice to achieve efficacy.
I answer: You must cultivate the work in your breath and verify the response in stillness. When clouds emerge, their *qi* is steaming; when rain arrives, its moisture is urgent. Before rain comes, the *qi* is scorching, and the bladder’s *qi* is tense. When lightning stirs, the eyes itch, and their light suddenly flashes. When thunder stirs, the three fields drip with sound, and the five viscera roar in an instant. The practitioner must swiftly ignite the heart’s fire to excite it, surge the kidney’s water to propel it, and first seal the five senses to internally verify the five phases—this is the method.

A question was asked:
Whenever I see you, Master, perform the practice, a fierce wind arises, followed by thunder and lightning—why is this?
I answer: Fix your gaze, hold your breath, and face the *xun* direction. With your hand, stir the *gang* of the whirlwind fiercely, swallow three times, turn your body, and kick the wind wheel with your foot—passing from *xun* to *you*, exiting at *chou*—and the wind will rage. Thunder is not fierce without wind, rain does not form without wind, clouds do not rise without wind, and lightning does not move without wind. As for praying for rain, it relies entirely on the chaotic rising of the north wind to signal rain’s arrival—this is the subtlest method.

A question was asked:
Master, you often stay in the palace, yet during snowfall, it is scorching summer—how is this possible?
I answer: This transformation is the result of twenty years of my cultivation. After the summer solstice, *yin* is born within, and through this, the mercury tiger conceives. It is the subtle alignment of *qi* through the movement of my fingers, flawlessly merging the mysteries of *li* and *xu*.

A question was asked:
Praying for snow is considered difficult in the world. I thought that in winter, when cold congeals, it immediately turns to snow—why is it said to be difficult?
I answer: After the winter solstice, the *yang* of creation begins, and the mechanism originates from *yang*. When the *yang qi* of the human body is dispersed, it is not easy to summon snow. The method involves moving the heart’s fire to excite the kidney’s water, then fiercely circulating the lung’s *qi* to generate it. Afterward, you must stir the wind cave, seal the *li* *qi*, and allow it to ferment.

A question was asked:
The mechanism of killing and subduing is truly difficult to master.
I answer: What is difficult about it? Simply mobilize your own killing *qi*, command the *gang* stars of Heaven, and harness the tiger and archer of the human realm. When these three unite with the spirit, their power will shake and subdue.

A question was asked:
I often see people praying, and when night falls, they see flashes of lightning, assuming that during the altar ritual, it must align with the talisman’s intent. Yet why do most fail?
I answer:

I answer: There is no other reason—only a lack of true cultivation. They do not consider from which direction the lightning stirs, where the thunder and rain arise, or where the skies remain clear. How can they take such signs as their standard? Thus, their self-deception is only natural.

A question was asked:
The methods of praying for rain are many and varied. Why do some talismans work while others fail to bring response?
I answer:
Praying for rain is most critical in summer. The ancient sages and worthies never prayed for rain in spring, autumn, or winter. In the fourth lunar month, pure *yin* prevails, and *yin* governs affairs. If *yang* errs even slightly, drought and famine follow. Thus, the method of praying for rain was established to save the rice and millet. Today’s scholars, ignorant of the proper method, merely blame the talismans for their inefficacy.

A question was asked:
The seventh and eighth months belong to autumn. Why do they also suffer from lack of rain or excessive sun? What is the reason for this?
I answer:
Autumn corresponds to *metal*, while the residual fire of summer flows westward, making it difficult to restrain. Moreover, fire and metal clash. If by chance the celestial divisions align with a drought-inducing *qi* cycle, even slight imbalance leads to disorder.

A question was asked:
If this is so, how can one effect change?
I answer:
The method lies in the practice of silent audience, which mediates between presence and absence to produce verification. Long ago, when I entered the capital for an audience, I twice encountered the Fire Master, who said: “You have been entrusted with a grave commission in the imperial court, so I have come to inform you. This year, Heaven’s decree ordains drought—it is not something you can pray away.” I then bowed and asked the Fire Master for instruction. He replied: “All the dragon pools and springs under Heaven have been sealed by the Jade Emperor. Even with talismans and methods, if the allotted number is not fulfilled, prayer will be in vain.” I pressed further, asking what he would teach me. He said: “On this journey, only the Yellow River remains unsealed. You should dispatch a summons to its spirit, borrowing water from the Yellow River to relieve the drought.” I followed his instruction upon arriving in the capital, and the court indeed commanded me to pray for rain. I issued a decree to the Thunder God, borrowing three feet of water from the Yellow River to save the land. Later, the capital reported that the rain that fell was muddy water. Thus, the Fire Master’s words proved true.

A question was asked:
Master, you possess the bearing of an immortal and the bones of a Daoist, while I am but a common man. You have had extraordinary encounters with the Fire Master—what will I rely upon when I face doubts in the future?
I answer:
The notion of immortal bearing and Daoist bones is not unfounded, yet the connection between Heaven and humanity is the same for all. If you lack the virtue to summon a master, you should enter your chamber, sit upright, and test your own destiny. Take, for example, the matter of praying for rain: when Heaven’s decree and the *qi* cycle are thus, it is difficult to verify the mechanism within oneself. One must observe whether urine flows or not. Press the tongue against the upper palate, swallow saliva, and stir the water of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is the Water of the Celestial One, the purest and most noble substance. When this water stirs, it excites the fire of the bladder. Fire rises and water descends—this is the principle of Heaven’s *qi* descending and Earth’s *qi* ascending. When *yin* and *yang* ascend and descend in harmony, rain falls in due measure. The Dragon of the Gallbladder resides in the great abyss of the bladder. When it inverts to draw forth water, responding to the moment, rain arrives. If one does not maintain unbroken continuity—if one merely stirs the gallbladder’s water to excite the bladder’s fire and then relies on urine to verify the effect—there will not only be no result but also cause for ridicule.

A question was asked:
The subtlety of harmonizing ascent and descent is indeed profound. But how does one achieve the effect of unbroken continuity?
I answer:
Follow my words: sit in stillness and silence for three days to test the verification.

A question was asked:
I respectfully received your teaching and returned home to sit in stillness for three days, releasing all thoughts and refraining from all affairs. After completing the three days, I returned to seek your instruction.
The master said:
Have you practiced what you were taught?
I replied:
I humbly present myself before you to receive further teaching.
The master said:
What benefit did you gain from your sitting?
I replied:
Following your instruction, I only felt my body light and at ease, my mind and emotions clear and refreshed.
The master said:
How foolish you are—this *is* the effect. At the beginning of practice, one already feels thus. From three days to nine, to twenty-seven, to eighty-one, to one hundred twenty, to two hundred ten days—with prolonged practice, day by day and month by month, spirit and *qi* naturally coalesce. At the highest level, one may shed the mortal form and ascend to the origin; next, one may attain longevity and enduring vision; and further still, one may summon clouds and rain, command lightning and thunder, benefiting people and all things. What is there that cannot be achieved?

A question was asked:
Regarding the method of summoning rain, how does one apply the subtlety of unbroken continuity?
I answer:
In the state of profound stillness, it is like the time of nurturing the dragon and cultivating the Dao. If one can sit with true accumulation of effort over time, the nature of Heaven becomes clear, and the still water settles. The Mercury Dragon conceals itself within, and when the Lead Tiger responds, *yin* and *yang* harmonize. When the ancestral *qi* stirs, it ascends to the great abyss, and the dragon within the body also rouses. Through this resonance, when one wishes for rain, it can pour forth at the mere thought. Yet if, during practice, one fails to nurture and sustain it—like cultivating lotuses on dry land or binding the void—how can success not be difficult?

A question was asked:
Heaven’s decree is lofty and unyielding. Even with inner cultivation, how can one influence it?
I answer:
The decree lies with Heaven, but the intention to influence it depends on responding to the moment with adaptability. Before my journey to the capital, the local administration asked me to pray for rain. Before I began my practice, they had already performed numerous prayers without result. One day, in deep stillness, a messenger from the void silently reported: “Heaven’s decree ordains drought—no method can alter it. However, fifty *li* from the prefecture lies the Thunder Marsh, in the land of Jianchang and Xiuyuan. Though the Thunder God there has been commanded to seal the marsh, within the Daoist method, he may still be moved to act. You should use a talisman to summon him.”

I awoke and immediately dispatched the talisman, commanding the messenger to pursue the matter. Returning to my seat, I vaguely saw an old master suddenly appear upon the altar. He drew a mouthful of ink—steeped in the essence of the sun—from the bowl and departed. Soon after, the sky and earth darkened, and a light rain fell for a brief moment before ceasing. Before I could react, the drought resumed.

Later, I asked the messenger, who explained: “The old master was none other than the dragon spirit you had summoned. Though he had disobeyed the decree to emerge from his cave, the fleeting drizzle was merely the mouthful of pure water from the altar—a mere token of response within the method.”

Thereupon, I sent another memorial, flying it to the True King to petition for an imperial decree. The Son of Heaven’s edict was granted, and rain fell for three days before the drought returned.

Someone asked: “If a master such as yourself can achieve this, why then do the many ritual officers and Daoist priests of today—who fill every hall with their petitions—fail to produce any consistent response, despite their repeated memorials? What accounts for this?”

I answered: “In general, the memorials they submit reach only a single destination and must not be overly elaborate.”

Moreover, when people today have matters to address, they rush to the Drum of Petition. The heavens manifest drought through celestial reckoning, yet you submit memorials out of private whim—these must be relayed through the Censorate and transmitted down to prefectures and counties before any action is taken. By the time the imperial command arrives, would not the rain on that very day have been in vain? Thus, the Fire Master taught me the method of dispatching spirits to petition the Emperor on High. For the matter of praying for rain, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Lord of Green Waves. One need only memorialize the Heavenly Lord, beseeching him to relay the plea to the Jade Emperor. Once the decree is granted, it descends to the True Palace of Earth, where the depths are opened to release water and rescue the withered land.

Someone asked: “Thunder shakes the earth for a hundred *li*—why then does it not extend everywhere, so that one district may receive rain while another does not, a third remains dry, and a fourth is drenched only to return to drought?”

I answered: “When performing the ritual, first issue a summons to the local spirits of the ward and village to receive the rain. If the people of that square *li* are sincere and the village spirits come forth to welcome it, the memorialized rain will surely fall in torrents. But if the people of that district have accumulated evil to the point of drought and calamity, not a drop will descend, nor will the village spirits come to receive it. This principle is like dispatching an official in the mortal realm to bestow relief upon a locality: if the prefecture and county are well-governed, the relief will surely arrive; if the magistrates are derelict in duty, it will amount to nothing more than empty formalities.”

Someone asked: “The ancient masters held that praying for clear skies was more difficult than praying for rain—how does this method fare in practice?”

I answered: “The workings of creation are but the turning of the mysterious within. When rain and floods linger, there are several explanations: first, the seasonal qi and celestial reckoning; second, the reckless stirring of clouds and rain by flood dragons and mirage-serpents; third, the failure of those responsible for harmonizing the elements, leading to prolonged deluges. Thus, such matters cannot be discussed in sweeping terms.”

Someone asked: “As you instruct, what is the proper method?”

I answered: “The verification within one’s own body is of the utmost urgency.”

Begin by circulating through the cycles of wu and ji, allowing the primordial qi to complete a full revolution and return to dusk. Then, settle into stillness and observe the inner alchemy. If, upon perception, there comes a response—where the heart-fire flames upward, the gall-water trickles downward, the whole body steams with vexing heat, and the throat itches slightly—then the celestial Dao must surely bring clear skies.

Someone asked: “The signs within the body are now understood. Yet when the celestial reckoning is disrupted or the harmonizing officials fail in their duty, or when the deluge stars linger for ten-day periods, how can one discern this?”

I answered: “Those who harmonize and regulate—from the highest ministers to the local magistrates—are known by the governance they administer and the deeds they perform. Of old, it was said that when a wronged woman cried out, frost fell in the sixth month; when a single man suffered injustice, floods lasted nine years. By this reasoning, all becomes clear. As for deluges that persist for ten-day periods, dispatch Huangfu Kui of Heaven to bind them, and apply the law to restrain the flood dragons and mirage-serpents.”

Someone asked: “Dragons and mirages stir winds and summon rains—how can they cause such prolonged inundations? The schools of ritual employ talismanic scripts, written charms, and proclamations, with a thousand methods and ten thousand arts, yet cannot command the thunder gods to rouse clouds and rain. Why, then, can these creatures do so?”

I answered: “Dragons and mirages dwell in the hidden depths of mountains, where they too have their local deities. When loyal and righteous men among the people neglect their sacrifices, these beings rise in the villages and hamlets, stirring clouds and rain to ruin fields and harm crops. By law, they should be dispatched to the Demon-Quelling General Qian for execution.”

Someone asked: “The inner verification and outer governance have been made clear. Yet in practicing the ritual methods, what is the essential point?”

I answered: “For the method of praying for clear skies, establish an altar in the direction of the Fire Killer, set up the altar of governance, summon the thunder, and proceed. First, open the clouds and roll back the mists; then, ignite the fire cavern and seal the rain cavern.”

Someone asked: “How does one open the clouds and roll back the mists, ignite the fire cavern, and seal the rain cavern?”

I answered: “To open the clouds and roll back the mists within the mysterious, gather all and return them to the tomb. Hold the breath for twenty-one cycles, briefly swallow the saliva, and ignite the fire cavern. Clench both fists tightly, tilt the face upward, and exhale forcefully fourteen times—this is how the fire cavern is ignited. For rain, hold the breath, press the tongue against the upper palate, swallow the saliva three times, and direct it straight to the cinnabar field.”

Someone asked: “The inner method is thus. What of the outer method?”

I answered: “The method begins by selecting the inner general from the day’s heavenly stem and the outer general from the earthly branch of the day. When they overcome the southern direction, halt. Then observe the monthly sovereign’s element: if the daily sovereign overcomes the star, the ritual may proceed. Simply apply the mutual generation and overcoming of the five phases to verify it.”

I said: “All that you have asked, my disciple, is essential to practice and wondrous in its resonance with humanity. You should follow my methods and perform them accordingly. All the mysteries within the talismans and the subtleties of the rituals have been fully revealed. But refine your heart in cultivation, conduct yourself with upright intention, and every action will strike true—nothing will be beyond your reach. Truly, this is the black pearl of the ocean of methods.”

With these words, I composed twenty-eight characters for my son-in-law, to be inscribed later by Zhonghe and entrusted to Huiyin Yuan Tingzhi:

*My methods were never recklessly transmitted,
For I know the Dao’s law is wondrously profound.
Your family is of the immortal seed—
Ensure your descendants, generation upon generation, are worthy.*

**Method:**
Before the separation of primordial chaos,
Without year, month, or hour,
Rely only on the signs to inform you—
This is the winter solstice of the human realm.

The discourse of Master Kunxu Tongmiao, Attendant of the Celestial King, concludes here.
