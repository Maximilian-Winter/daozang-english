The *Right Golden Tiger True Talisman* was transmitted by the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety to the Celestial Sovereign of the Golden Portal. Inscribed in vermilion upon white silk and encased in a purple brocade pouch, it is worn upon the head when traveling. Thus, it commands the spirits of heaven and earth, compels the reverence of immortals, summons jade maidens bearing towels, and invokes celestial soldiers to guard the body, while mountains and peaks bow in submission. When augmented with the incantation of divine authority and the jade essence’s verses, one may sever the nine demons and annihilate a thousand specters. This is a forbidden talisman of the Supreme Clarity, not transmitted to the world. Those who bear it ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The *Inner Invocation of the Supreme Primordial’s Golden True Might* is used to summon divine soldiers and exterminate malevolent spirits. One must enter a chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Sitting or reclining as one wishes, recite the following:

*"Expel the Toxic King of Qian,
The Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo,
Eight Immortals wielding halberds,
The Five Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor,
The Supreme Mystery’s Falling Radiance,
Seven Dawns guarding the court,
The Yellow True’s luminous talisman,
Flaming bells cast forth,
Divine tigers brandishing their might,
Poisoned blades wildly raging,
Purple effulgence of the script’s majesty,
Four leaps and a cry to the heavens,
Nine Heavens and Six Heavens,
Four Heavens gleaming bright,
Externally enwrapped in primordial qi,
Internally commanding the marshaled hosts,
Leftward might, rightward vigilance,
Wind’s assault, fire’s campaign,
Roaring to slay ten thousand specters,
Seizing and beheading a thousand spirits,
Golden True awakens in thunder,
Nine demons bound in form,
Northern Feng overthrown and shattered,
All annihilated in ruin.
I bear the true talisman,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
The Three Origins declare the truth,
Mysteriously uniting with the Emperor’s sincerity,
The Supreme Subtlety’s decree,
Ascending to the Three Clarities."*

The method of the *Inner Invocation of the Supreme Primordial’s Might* belongs to the forbidden scriptures of the Supreme Clarity.

*"Expel the Toxic King of Qian"* refers to the esoteric name of the great demon of the Six Heavens.
*"The Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo"* is the hidden title of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor.
*"Four Heavens gleaming bright"* is the soul-name of the ghost-ministers of Northern Feng.
Those who know the names of these three demons may cause a thousand specters to flee and ten thousand ghosts to conceal themselves. The nine demons dare not stir, nor can the hundred evils approach to harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits of temples and shrines, one may act accordingly without needing to burn incense or enter a chamber.

Additionally, one may inscribe the talisman with realgar upon green silk, three feet in length and one foot two inches in width—or a square of one foot two inches. Surround it with a four-sided border, lined with red brocade within, and wear it on the right side of the waist. When entering a purification chamber, attending morning or evening audiences, or performing rites to subdue demons and summon spirits, one may wear it to act accordingly.

Beware: one must not approach corpses or impurities, for the offense is equal to leaking the secret. The ancestors of the Seven Mysteries shall be punished in hell.

### *The Jade Scripture of the Divine Tiger’s Inner True Talisman*

The *Divine Tiger True Talisman* originated from the Celestial Parents of the Nine Heavens. The Celestial Venerable transmitted it to the Youth of the Eastern Sea, and the True King of the Nine Heavens transmitted it to the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord treasured and concealed it within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Capital’s Supreme Subtlety, guarded by mighty beasts and defended by venomous dragons. Seven thousand divine tigers stand ready in the Golden Portal, while three hundred golden dawn jade lads and three hundred pure numinous jade maidens attend the sacred writ. Mystic radiance shines emptily, scattering mist across the purple court. Its might shakes the nine distant realms, its divine light blazes in the Supreme Clarity, its wondrous harmony arises from spontaneity, and its cavernous wisdom penetrates the formless. The divine tiger’s stripes manifest its image, the golden tiger spans its truth, wisdom marks its essence, and the vanquishing of demons unfolds its source. Its subtle purport and arcane phrases are difficult to fathom, for they record the hidden titles of celestial demons and the esoteric names of the hundred spirits. Reciting its verses startles a thousand spirits, and chanting its passages binds ten thousand specters.

At the inception of the Three Heavens’ governance, it was entrusted to the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety, empowering him to command the Six Heavens, behead ten thousand specters, summon mountains and seas, bind the myriad spirits, subdue demons and dispel trials, and regulate the five stars. Thereupon, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety received the two talismans of *Divine Wisdom for Vanquishing Demons*—the *Golden Talisman*—and wore them to roam the Supreme Clarity. Riding the void’s swift chariot, he traversed the Supreme Subtlety’s revolving wheel, alighted in the Palace of the Supreme True’s Radiance, and stood upon the Jade Emperor’s steps. At rest, he harmonized with heaven and earth; in motion, he gleamed with the seven luminaries. He governed the nine mysteries, grasped the numinous mechanism, encompassed the ten thousand measures, and unified the myriad rhythms. He stirred the hundred yang to generate lightning and wielded the thousand yin to unleash might. Divine auroras draped the Dao over the Golden Portal, and the celestial gates responded to resonance, opening of their own accord. He commanded the eight radiant ones to ascend, spurred the divine tigers to soar, and the host of immortals cleared the path as the seven stars hastened forth. Mystic light dimmed and stagnated, myriad transformations and wonders arose. Gazing into the boundless realm, he surveyed the edges of the heavens, casting his eyes upon the five turbidities and lamenting the cycle of life and death. Truly, how subtle and wondrous is the mystery of the Numinous North!

The Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety addressed the Prime Minister, the Azure Youth, and the King of the Western City, saying: *"The Supreme Clarity’s Great Wisdom Scripture for Vanquishing Demons is the jade tablet of the Supreme Ultimate, the precious formula of the Most High. Its divine and true verses are the treasured chapters of the Supreme True of the Nine Heavens. Wisdom may dispel impurities, the vanquishing of demons may bind evil, and the true talisman may subdue demons. Those who possess jade tablets with purple names and cultivate the supreme method shall not be assailed by the myriad specters or tested by the ten thousand demons. Truly, no harm may befall them, nor may any trial disturb them—all by the might of the divine tiger and the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now, I entrust this to you, to transmit it to later students who are destined to become perfected beings."*

In accordance with the statutes of the Supreme True, transmission may occur thrice within seven hundred years, and it must not be shown to the unworthy. Should the true scripture be carelessly revealed, the offender shall suffer the torment of the wind-blade, and calamity shall extend to the seven ancestral lineages. Yet if one bears a golden name from Eastern Florescence and a jade-green inscription of the Supreme Clarity, upon receiving this talisman, thirty-six jade lads and jade maidens shall attend and guard your person. With them, you may traverse perilous passes, cross mountains and seas, summon spirits and subdue ghosts, and command the sacred peaks. Wherever you go, a thousand demons shall prostrate at your side, ten thousand evil spirits shall be bound in form, and hosts of immortals shall serve as your guard, while your body radiates wondrous light. If you cultivate for less than seven years, the true numina shall descend of their own accord to your chamber, and you shall ascend at dawn in a flying chariot with green canopy.

The recipient must observe a fast for ninety days, or thirty days, or seventy days, and offer ten taels of finest gold as a token of faith to the divine perfected, ninety feet of brocade to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens, and thirty feet of blue silk to pledge the heart. One who delights in the Dao and cherishes the true, who diligently focuses on the mysterious and does not begrudge wealth, who values the Dao above material goods—such a person may be deemed worthy of discourse. But one who covets treasure within and harbors frivolous desires without, though the Dao may already shine upon them, shall have the scripture sealed in a jade casket, locked behind golden gates, and after their ascension, hidden deep within a famous mountain.

Wear the talisman of the Divine Tiger, inscribed in yellow upon a blue ground. When you enter the Five Marchmounts, or find yourself amid calamity and peril, or in places haunted by ghosts and demons, you must invoke its divine might with a great incantation: strike the left teeth thirty-six times and recite:

*"Mysterious sound of the Nine Heavens, harmonious node of the Ox,
Master of the hidden and vast, opener of a hundred divine blossoms,
Transcending stagnation without trace, the Three Baskets weave the net of waves,
Revolving purity fills the radiance, pearls cluster in the tent of sand,
Cinnabar brightness commands all, the secret of the kalpa in the pearly veil,
Containing light to illuminate the profound, ascending to fill the house,
Bo Le rides the formless, driving the demons of heaven with strategy,
Regulating and severing their lineage, annihilating their forms in the Nine Nets,
The tiger transforms with divine might, capturing and subduing the myriad evils,
Slaying without distinction great or small, all perish,
Demons vanish with the light of time, misfortune extinguished in supreme harmony,
Riding the radiance to drive the void, ascending upon flying clouds,
Entering and departing the imperial court, forever preserving the numinous stem."*

When finished, swallow the qi thirty-six times and cease.

Without receiving the talisman of the Divine Tiger, one must not recklessly speak this incantation. These words are the inner taboo names of the great demons of the Nine Heavens; a single recitation shakes the Nine Heavens, binds the forms of ten thousand ghosts, blinds a thousand spirits, and summons a hundred gods to court. To speak it without receiving the talisman is to lose one’s soul and forfeit one’s spirit. The incantation for vanquishing demons of the Most High is likewise—take heed and be cautious.

There are also the Demon-Vanquishing Talisman and the Divine Tiger Talisman within the *Scripture for Vanquishing Demons*, all of which are the hidden names of the demon kings of the Nine Heavens. When wearing the talisman and reciting the incantation, it is best to consume one talisman for added efficacy.

On the first day of the seventh month in the third year of the Xingning reign, the year *yichou*, Master Tongbai transmitted this to Xu Yuanyou. He declared that in the years *jiashen*, *yihai*, *renchen*, and *guisi*, on the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month, there shall appear a Daoist clad in seven-colored ritual robes, holding a nine-curved staff, either at a sacred altar or among the people begging alms, chanting scriptures or singing wild songs. If you encounter such a one, earnestly seek their teaching, and they shall surely bestow upon you the talisman of the Divine Tiger. This is the Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, whom the Most High frequently sends to the world during these times to observe the hearts of those who cultivate the Dao.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Golden Writ and Tiger Talisman of the Supreme Perfection of the Cavernous True*.
