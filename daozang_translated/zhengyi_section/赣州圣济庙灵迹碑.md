**Stele of the Divine Miracles of Shengji Temple in Ganzhou #1**

Shengji Temple first arose in Ganzhou and gradually spread throughout the realm, with many prefectures and counties establishing their own. The deity, surnamed Shi and named Gu, was a native of Ganzhou. Born during the Qin dynasty, after his passing, he manifested his numinous power. In the sixth year of Emperor Gaozu of Han, the esteemed Marquis Guan Ying was dispatched to pacify the Jiangnan region and arrived in Ganzhou. At the time, Ganzhou belonged to Yuzhang Commandery, bordering Nanyue. When Zhao Tuo’s forces invaded the frontier, Guan Ying led troops to repel them. The deity descended upon the summit of Jueding Peak, revealing the date of victory. After the triumph, a temple was erected in Chongfu to honor him, and the locals called it the Temple of King Shi Gu.

In the first year of the Dazhong era of the Tang, a villager named Wen Liang, intoxicated, was bewitched by a demon and fell from a cliff. Fu Shuang, a merchant traveling to Changting, nearly capsized his boat. After praying to the deity, Wen Liang returned home, and Fu Shuang saw the god come to his aid. Thereupon, they divined a site at Leigang east of the Gong River and collectively built a new temple, carving a stone statue to enshrine him. Legend holds that when the temple was first constructed, heaven and earth darkened.

Lu Shi Wu Jun and Si Hu Xiao Jun, along with officials Kang and Huang, were sent to inspect it. All stood transfixed, and the two officials soon perished thereafter. To this day, they are venerated as attendant deities. From that time onward, the deity frequently displayed auspicious responses.

To the northeast of the prefecture lay two islets, Lantian and Qiandu. Every long summer, the waters would recede, exposing them like hills, blocking boats and oars. In the eighth year of the Jiayou era of the Song, Zhao Pu returned from his governance and dredged the channels. He urgently reported the deity’s efficacy at the temple, whereupon the waters rose eight *chi* in clarity—a phenomenon called "clear rising," where water swells without rain.

In the first year of the Yuanyou era, the fifth month of summer, no rain fell, and prayers at Bianrong Mountain went unanswered. Prefect Kong Pingzhong welcomed the deity to Yugu Terrace. Before the candles could be lit, a sweet rain poured down. In the fourth year, a fire broke out in the eastern city, fanned by fierce winds, threatening the granaries. Yan Zhengpei, wearing the prefectural seal, urgently invoked the deity: *"Have mercy on my suffering people!"* Suddenly, the wind reversed, extinguishing the flames.

In the sixth year, another fire erupted. The elderly and young gazed toward Leigang and bowed. Though the moon shone as bright as day, dark clouds swiftly gathered, and a torrential rain quenched the raging blaze. In the third year of the Jianyan era, Empress Dowager Meng of Longyou sojourned in Ganzhou. Jin scouts advanced to Zaoshui, but upon seeing the deity leading a vast host of spectral soldiers, they retreated.

In the nineteenth year of the Shaoxing era, Xu Zhong, the prefect of Poyang, wished to renovate the deity’s shrine. He summoned twenty prominent families and addressed them in the courtyard. The assembly recommended Zhang Rui and Guo Wenzhen, whose minds were sharp and resourceful, to oversee the project. The two declined, claiming incompetence. Xu then divided a sheet of paper into twenty slips, matching the number of men, and wrote "chief" and "deputy" on two of them. After sealing them randomly, he had each draw one. When opened, the two who had drawn the marked slips were Zhang and Guo. The people marveled at the deity’s communion with their hearts, and the shrine was completed in no time.

In the twenty-seventh year, rebel bandits and forbidden troops seized the city, extorting women, gold, and silk, driving away nearly all the carts. Emperor Gaozong ordered Commander-in-Chief Li Geng to annihilate them. A dark mist shrouded Nitao, hindering the soldiers’ advance. Li Geng secretly prayed, and at dawn, the wind turned favorable, the sky cleared, and the city fell in a single assault. Thereafter, whenever the imperial army campaigned in the south, none failed to offer sacrifices and beseech the deity’s spectral troops for aid.

In the sixteenth year of the Chunxi era, during the triennial imperial examination, a local scholar named Liu Wenchai sought the deity’s sign in a dream. He dreamed of thirty men standing with tall bamboo poles, so he changed his name to Quan and was selected for the provincial examination. In the summer of the tenth year of the Jiading era, heavy rains caused the river to surge violently, leaving only three *ban* of the city walls above water. The people, fearing they would become fish, wept and prayed piteously. Soon after, the waters receded, sparing them from harm.

In the third year of the Shaoding era, the rebel soldier Zhu Xian led his followers Chen Da, Zhou Jin, and Cai Fa in revolt. An imperial edict promoted Chen Kai, then serving as military supervisor of Qixi and Xiang, to the position of judicial commissioner of Jiangxi, with authority to oversee the generals in their punitive campaign. One night, while encamped in Luling, Chen Kai dreamed that the deity told him: "The rebel leader will flee to Panyu—you must act swiftly." Kai secretly ordered Hu Yan and Li Qiang to hasten to Ganzhou, where they joined forces with the troops of three strongholds and executed the rebels.

In the seventh year of the Chunyou era, the Yao and Liao tribes of Hunan, led by Zeng Zhi, rose in rebellion, their clamor shaking the lands south of the Yangtze. The regional commissioner Zheng Fengchen dispatched Wang Shunjin to attack them. As if aided by a divine presence, the rebels were struck with terror and swiftly annihilated.

In the ninth year, Cui Wenguang of Anyuan staged an uprising, taking refuge in stone caves. Yao Xide of Tongchuan arrived to enforce the law, stationing troops to besiege the rebels. After a prolonged stalemate, the bandits saw what appeared to be banners fluttering in the clouds, and their courage failed. Their ringleader was soon captured.

In the third year of the Jingding era, a case involving the Li family of the prefecture was mishandled by clerks who accepted bribes, torturing innocent people into confessing. The left minister Wu Ge suspected foul play, and the deity revealed the truth through an omen, ultimately exonerating the accused.

In the seventeenth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, a soldier named Zhang Yanzhen entered the temple, his tongue lolling several inches from his mouth and his feet suspended in midair. He confessed his hidden sins in great detail, as if interrogated by an unseen inquisitor.

The deity’s manifestations of divine power number in the hundreds, with particularly numerous instances of answered prayers for rain, sunshine, and relief from epidemics. I have recorded only the most notable cases here; those omitted may be inferred by example.

During the Baoqing era of the Song dynasty, Fu Can of Putian served as the eastern magistrate of Gan County. Enamored of the deity’s efficacy, he composed a hundred *xianci* poems for the county. These verses, used by the people for divination, proved uncannily accurate, as if the deity spoke directly to them—another facet of its subtle influence on governance and moral order.

During the reign of Wu Yangpu, the deity’s ability to repel the Miao tribes and defend against calamities earned it a place in the official sacrificial canon. It was enfeoffed as **Zhaoling Wang** (Illustrious Numinous King). Under the Song, it received five successive titles, culminating in **Chonghui Xianqing Zhaolie Zhongyou Wang** (August, Benevolent, Manifest, Illustrious, Loyal, and Protective King), and its temple was granted the name **Jiaji** (Auspicious Aid). Under the Yuan, its titles were thrice revised, finally settling on **Huguo Puren Chonghui Lingying Shenglie Zhongyou Wang** (Nation-Protecting, Universally Benevolent, August, Numinous, Sagely, Illustrious, Loyal, and Protective King), which remains its designation to this day. The honors bestowed upon it are truly exhaustive.

Among the relics still preserved in the temple are the vermilion-yellow robe bestowed by Emperor Gaozong, a silk-wrapped agate belt, and the Five-Dragon Inkstone presented by Li Yu of the Southern Tang.

I have consulted the classics, which state that in times of famine or disaster, the state seeks the aid of spirits through sacrifice, while scholars afflicted by illness pray to the Five Domestic Deities. The former kings regarded the spirits as dependable, hence the establishment of these rituals of worship.

Yet many who style themselves Confucians dismiss the realm of spirits as obscure and inscrutable. If one broaches the subject, they either dismiss it as deception or condemn it as superstition—are they not, then, defying the classics?

Consider this deity: its merits have served the state, its virtue has benefited the people. From the Han dynasty to the present, who has not relied upon it? Even renowned officials of recent times—Liu Anshi, the Su brothers, Hong Mai, Xin Qiji, and Wen Tianxiang—all revered it diligently and without neglect. Are these gentlemen not Confucians? How do they differ so from the skeptics of today?

When I was first summoned to court, the deity foretold an auspicious omen of literary eminence, and I later entered the Hanlin Academy as a scholar. I privately marveled at this. Now, the temple’s invocators, Wei Zhong and his brother Zhi Qin, have presented me with accounts of the deity’s miracles from Tang and Song records, urging my nephew Fa Kai to request that I compile a comprehensive account. I could not refuse, and so I have composed this text for inscription.

Some claim that Emperor Gao never campaigned in Yue, merely sending Lu Jia to present the imperial seal and appoint Zhao Tuo as King of Southern Yue. However, I have examined the historical records: Ying’s pacification of Yuzhang occurred in the sixth year (gengzi), while Tuo’s submission took place in the eleventh year (yisi). Before his submission, how can we be certain he did not invade the border, only to be repelled by Ying? Perhaps historians, deeming the event minor, omitted it. How dare I leave it unmentioned?

I conclude with a poem:

Amidst the emerald peaks where sacred thunder rolls,
Five-glazed eaves soar, embracing subtle mysteries.
The clustered shrine, with fourfold eaves, stands lone in flight,
Its image transformed, ochre-hued, with fivefold hues applied.

Cool yin pervades, stirring memories of ancient gales,
Auspicious omens trace back to the fiery Liu’s dawn.
When Yue’s miasma pierced through, heralding victory’s hour,
Could it be a fallen star’s essence that took form?

Descending in spirit to aid the workings of transformation,
Taking stone as surname—such principle is fitting.
In *Da Zhong*, the tortoise-shell divined a move,
Resounding murmurs spread to the four directions.

Wind and thunder’s commands seem governed by unseen hands,
Rice ripples in abundance, the year knows no hunger.
The people, bellies full, revel in joy,
Yet the *Jian Yan* fire virtue met its mid-decline.

The imperial carriage halted in Gan’s marshes,
As Wanyan’s troops advanced in great strides.
Divine soldiers unfurled banners in the clouds,
Armor rolled up, they fled swift as startled raccoons.

The Mo Yao tribes howled, drawing near the encircling Yi,
Imperial troops cast down their loads to seize the city.
From the sturdiest warriors down to infants, all were slaughtered—
The deity’s awe-inspiring might aided the royal forces.

Not a single fiend remained, utterly annihilated,
As the Gan River’s waters receded, isles rose like shoals.
Mighty vessels stuck fast, immovable,
Bowing deeply, they knelt to touch the sacred threshold.

Even as flames blazed and clouds lacked raiment,
Vast waves surged, submerging rocky isles.
The hidden workings of the kingly Dao—who could doubt its merit?
From heaven descended a phoenix-sealed decree inscribed in purple mud.

Ennobled as a true king, jade tablet in hand,
He rides the wind’s steeds and cloud-borne chariots, coming and going.
Crimson robes bestow rare favor, sashes entwined with silk,
Five-dragon treasures gleam with horns and manes wondrous.

Concealed within, they radiate light in midnight’s heart,
Yin and yang revolve without trace or end.
The cries of ospreys and mallows chill the air, as if seen,
Fortune and misfortune bear signs—held in the deity’s grasp.

Entrusted to the vague and distant, beyond mortal ken,
Why not seek the stele standing in the temple courtyard?
In the *xin hai* year of *Hongwu*, first month of spring,
Composed by Song Lian of Jinhua, Supervisor of the Directorate of Education.
