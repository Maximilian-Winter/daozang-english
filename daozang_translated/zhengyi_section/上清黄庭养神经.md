The Dao speaks: Long ago in the Flowery Pearl Palace, I heard the wondrous meanings of the *Yellow Court* and the transformative Dao within the *Lute of the Heart and Spirit of the Great Way*. When humans receive life, they partake of the numinous Dao-qi, embracing the harmony of yin and yang. Yet they become ensnared by sounds and sights, deluded by flavors, and seduced by excess and lust, losing their right mindfulness and squandering their prime years.

Know that movement and stillness, departure and abiding, must be cultivated in accord with the teachings. By treading the wondrous practices to nurture the spirit, the body attains tranquility, myriad calamities are averted, and demonic forces cannot disturb. Preserve the thought of the Dao and distance yourself from evil paths.

When coming or going, call upon the name of the Day Spirit of the present day, saying, "[Name], escort me forth and back." By thus invoking, you walk in the Dao. The Day Spirit accompanies you, and no evil of the spirit-realm can assail you. You will repel all ghosts, and for a thousand years, ten thousand ages, no venomous harm shall befall you.

When submitting memorials to high officials, inscribe talismans and carry them on your person. Thrice invoke the Day Spirit, saying, "[Name], accompany me." For households afflicted by illness or death, place the talisman on your person—on the right side on yin days, the left on yang days.

If entering mountains or forests to evade peril, thrice knock your teeth and call upon the Day Spirit, as well as the Spirit of Jia-Shen. All mountain ghosts, demons, wolves, and tigers will flee in terror. To dispel malevolent spirits and ghosts, inscribe the talismans of the Six Jia and Six Yi, and invoke the Spirit of Jia-Yin—all ghosts will scatter.

To avert weapons in battle, inscribe the talismans of the Six Bing and Six Ding, invoke their spirits, and call upon the name of the Spirit of Jia-Wu. Blades shall not wound you. To guard against fire, inscribe the talismans of the Six Ren and Six Gui, invoke their spirits, and call upon the name and style of the Spirit of Jia-Zi, saying, "[Name], accompany me," and you shall not be burned.

To escape drowning, inscribe the talismans of the Six Wu and Six Ji, and invoke the Spirit of Jia-Xu—you shall be spared from water’s peril. In disputes or slander, inscribe the talismans of the Six Geng and Six Xin, invoke their spirits, and call upon the talisman of the Spirit of Jia-Chen. All hostile words shall be resolved in harmony.

The talismans described above are to be inscribed and worn in secret; do not transmit them carelessly. For example, the Spirit of Jia-Zi is surnamed Wang, styled Wenqing—Wang is the surname, Wenqing the style. The same pattern applies to all others through Gui-Hai. In total, there are eight hundred and seven spirits, each serving in rotation as the Day Spirit.

If one, at dawn each day, thrice knocks the teeth and recites the name of the Day Spirit, saying, "[Name], today’s Day Spirit, accompany me, that all I encounter may be propitious and upright," and further thrice knocks the teeth to invoke one’s Life Spirit, all desires shall be fulfilled. Moreover, whatever one eats daily should be offered to one’s Life Spirit, thereby increasing fortune and longevity. On one’s Life Day, performing great acts of merit for the Life Spirit brings even greater auspiciousness.

On the left, the Azure Dragon Mengzhang of Jia-Yin; on the right, the White Tiger Jianbing of Jia-Shen; above the head, the Vermilion Bird Lingguang of Jia-Wu; beneath the feet, the Dark Warrior Zhiming of Jia-Zi. The Moon enters the center as the Noble One.

Recite this passage in secret until memorized; do not utter it aloud, nor let others know. In legal disputes, when encountering inauspicious qi, amid the perils of battle, or when entering foreign lands with unfamiliar waters and soils, or during epidemics, repeatedly meditate upon it at dawn. When entering a household in mourning or approaching a corpse, recite it once per step upon crossing the threshold, knock the teeth thrice, and recite it three times—this is my method.

Upon awakening the next day, invoke the names of the Four Seas’ spirits:
- Spirit of the Eastern Sea: Aming
- Spirit of the Western Sea: Zhouliang
- Spirit of the Southern Sea: Jucheng
- Spirit of the Northern Sea: Yuqiang

The great spirits of the Four Seas repel all ghosts, dispel misfortune, and swiftly obey the command!

The *Scripture of the Six Jia Spirits Enveloping the Body in the Secret Essentials of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance* states:

Should one suddenly contract illness, paralysis, swelling, malign qi, the hundred poisons of corpse-curse, or suffer from nightmares, hold the breath and recite in intervals: from *jia-wu* to *wu-xu*, retaining the qi within the Upper Dipper. The Upper Dipper lies between the two breasts. Hold the breath and recite *jia-wu* to *wu-xu* ten times, then exhale. Again, hold the breath and recite *jia-zi* to *wu-chen* ten times, then retain the qi within the Lower Dipper. The Lower Dipper is the navel’s center. Recite in intervals ten times, then exhale—this cures all ailments and brings immediate recovery.

If pain or suffering arises suddenly in any of the four limbs, invoke the name of the spirit presiding over the afflicted area three times, and the ailment will cease; invoke no more than thrice. Inscribe a vermilion talisman directly upon the painful spot and swallow it. Also invoke the name of the spirit of the current day, saying, “So-and-so, protect me and accompany me on my way.” With this method alone, no illness remains uncured.

The Heavenly Master states: Before employing these talismans or consuming them oneself, one must first purify the body and maintain a sincere, unblemished heart—only then will the talismans prove efficacious. Should one act with deceit, flattery, or falsehood, seeking to profit from my methods by extorting others’ wealth or pursuing fame and gain, such persons shall incur misfortune, and the afflictions of those they treat shall not be dispelled. This is the immutable decree. Do not use my methods to seek worldly wealth, nor transmit them to the flattering or deceitful.

My Dao possesses sagely wisdom—guard it closely, never transmit it recklessly. Seal it in silence, bind your tongue, and do not leak it. Transmit it only to the worthy, and the Dao shall remain pure and luminous; transmit it to the unworthy, and the Dao shall be defiled. Bestow it upon the worthy, and both shall receive its blessings; bestow it upon the unworthy, and both shall suffer calamity. Know when to transmit and when to withhold—transmit when it is right, and halt when it is not. To withhold from the worthy is to hoard treasure; to transmit to the unworthy is to squander it. Hoarding or squandering treasure brings untimely ruin.

Lord Lao says: Guard it well, do not transmit it recklessly.

For all rituals, first observe purification and fasting. Prepare a chamber with a seat in readiness. When fasting for sixty days to consume the talisman, bathe the night before, and drink a divine decoction of ten jujubes—refrain from other food. Sit in quietude, and when the spirit-birds sing at dawn, draw a cup of well’s first water. At daybreak, face east, knock the teeth, and recite the incantation: “I delight in the Dao and its methods, and reverently consume this divine talisman. May the spirits be moved—*jia-zi* Wang Wenqing and his eighteen attending officials.” Upon finishing the incantation, bow twice, swallow the talisman with the water, and carefully determine the spirit of the current day, ensuring no error.

On *gui-hai* day, consume the *jia-zi* talisman; on *jia-zi* day, consume the *yi-chou* talisman, also invoking the spirit of the current day. From *yin* day onward, consume the talisman of each respective day until all sixty are exhausted, aligning with the spirits of the day. Should you hear the voice of the day’s spirit, do not be startled or afraid. When you first behold the spirit, offer a sacrifice of wine, jujubes, incense, and fruit. If, after consuming all sixty talismans, you immediately perceive the spirit, proceed with the sacrifice. If you engage in speech with the spirit, further sacrifices are unnecessary.

For the grand sacrifice, use the seventh day of the first month. The offerings are as described above, with the addition of a bolt of blue silk measuring one *zhang* and five *cun*. After the sacrifice, wear the blue silk as an upper garment.

For the fasting and sacrificial rites, avoid only impure colors and foul, odious foods; all else is as in the *Fu Yi Xi* for personal practice.

For the initial encounter with the spirit, lay out a mat with the seat facing west. Arrange sixty cups upon the mat in six rows. Pour wine and present six jujubes, facing east, and recite the incantation: “I humbly invite the Lords of the Six Jia to partake of these sweet jujubes and fine wine.” Only bow once the spirit is seated. For the first sacrifice, the jujubes must be presented. The rites for transmitting talismans to others or healing the sick follow the same method.

Upon concluding, recite the incantation: “Water, fire, metal, wood, earth—return each to its proper place.”

Lord Lao says: Within the heart reside three spirits, each with a name:
- The first is Ling Zhu Jun,
- The second is Ling Ming Jun,
- The third is Ling Huang Jun.

Constantly meditate upon them, reciting their names thrice daily. They shall accompany you whether walking or sitting, shielding you to traverse perilous years.

At dawn, after rinsing the mouth, recite this incantation:
*“Nihuan’s mysterious blossom, preserving essence evermore.
Left, the hidden sun; right, the moon’s root.
The Six Harmonies refine the spirit,
And the hundred gods receive grace.”*

Before each meal, first recite this incantation:
*“The hundred grains enter the stomach,
Uniting with the spirit’s qi.
They replenish blood and fluids,
Banishing corpse-demons and decay.
Ascend to the Golden Gate,
To live as long as heaven and earth,
Commanding the Six Dings,
With divine youths in attendance.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.”*

Knock the teeth seven times on the right, swallow saliva thrice, and recite in secret.

On one’s natal day, distribute alms of money, rice, and cloth according to one’s age to the poor, increasing blessings and extending years.

All impurities and filth must never be directed toward the north.

On the sixteenth day of the fifth month, strictly avoid the union of yin and yang.

When relieving oneself, never face the Three Luminaries—such is a grave transgression.

Avoid defilement above all. If entering households of mourning or childbirth, wear the talisman to dissolve impurity.
