### **The Three Evil Gates**

**First Gate:** The Gate of Sensual Desire, also called the Path of the Upper Corpse or the Realm of Heavenly Transgressors.
**Second Gate:** The Gate of Attachment, also called the Path of the Middle Corpse or the Realm of Human Transgressors.
**Third Gate:** The Gate of Gluttony, also called the Path of the Lower Corpse or the Realm of Earthly Transgressors.

These Three Evil Gates are also known as the Paths of the Three Corpses or the Realms of the Three Transgressors. They constantly dwell within the human body, blocking the mouths of the Three Passes, severing the roots of the Three Lives, obstructing the path of immortal study, and suppressing the soaring hun-souls of those who seek transcendence.

The foundation of learning lies in shedding the Corpses from the Three Paths and eliminating desires at the gates of the Three Realms. How else can the True One descend? How else can the Dao be accomplished?

Those who study the supreme methods must dispel all desires, extinguish the roots of the Corpses, and the Dao will naturally descend; immortality will naturally be achieved. Only then can one soar and ascend to the Three Clarities.

### **The Five Suffering Gates**

**First Gate:** The Gate of Sensual Bondage and Heart Suffering, also called the Path of Suffering in the Earth Prison of Mount Tai.
**Second Gate:** The Gate of Attachment and Spirit Suffering, also called the Path of Suffering under Wind and Blade.
**Third Gate:** The Gate of Greed and Bodily Suffering, also called the Path of Suffering under the Burden of Mountains and Stones.
**Fourth Gate:** The Gate of Vanity and Essence Suffering, also called the Path of Suffering in Rivers and Seas.
**Fifth Gate:** The Gate of Bodily Bondage and Multifold Suffering, also called the Path of Suffering in Boiling Cauldrons, Fire-Swallowing, and Coal-Eating.

These Five Gates of Suffering and Five Paths constantly reside within the human body, binding the roots of life, obstructing the path to summoning the True, and severing the gate of immortal cultivation.

The foundation of learning lies in dissolving the form from the Five Paths and eradicating traces beneath the Five Sufferings. If the myriad bonds are not severed, one will sink into the gates of sin—how then can liberation be attained? How can the body escape, transform, and radiate the flowing jade light?

Those who seek the supreme study must first sever all bonds and extinguish the paths of suffering. The True One will naturally descend; divine immortality will naturally be achieved. Only then can one transform the form and wander through the heavens.

### **Shedding the Path of the Upper Corpse**

To shed the Path of the Upper Corpse, inscribe the *Upper Primordial Jade Talisman for Extinguishing Desire, Beheading the Corpse, Transforming Radiance, and Flowing Light* in green, and place it upon the head.

At the Gate of Sensual Desire, face north while holding a blade in the mouth. Prepare a cup of pure water and place it before the water’s surface. The master stands behind the disciple, strikes the teeth nine times, and recites the incantation:

> *The Upper Corpse, Green Desire, styles itself Peng Ju,*
> *Transforming into nine forms, with a bird’s head and serpent’s body,*
> *Chaotic and heartless, now sinking, now floating,*
> *Gluttonous for fine flavors, dwelling in gaudy beauty,*
> *It roams as the human hun and po, secretly recording transgressions,*
> *Severing life’s roots, scattering qi, and causing the spirit to wander,*
> *Rampant through the Three Palaces, a tiny worm without toil.*
>
> *True Person Jia Yi, bearing the register and wearing the talisman,*
> *Has severed sensual desire and removed the path of death.*
> *By the command of the Primordial Beginning, I beseech the beheading of the Corpse’s head.*
> *The Three Terraces oversee the form—depart swiftly, linger not!*
> *Eradicate the root, exterminate the lineage, leave no remnant behind.*
>
> *Jia Yi refines the True, the Three Palaces purified and void,*
> *The Five Emperors descend in radiance, the Great One inscribes the register.*
> *Bathed in the Northern Primordial, crowned and girded, traversing the realms,*
> *Ascending boundlessly, riding the jade chariot of flowing radiance,*
> *Escaping and transforming in the Supreme Clarity, roaming the void.*

Upon completion, the master takes the blade held in the disciple’s mouth and circles the disciple’s head nine times. The rolled jade talisman is then buried beneath the Gate of Sensual Desire, and the cup of water is poured over it.

By practicing this method, the Upper Corpse is extinguished, sensual desire is eradicated, and the body transcends the Realm of Heavenly Transgressors. The form and hun-soul are freed from the afflictions of suffering.

**The Great Perfection’s supreme path must not be lightly transmitted.**

Proceed in order to the Middle Gate to shed the Middle Corpse.

### **Shedding the Middle Corpse**

To shed the Middle Corpse, inscribe the *Middle Primordial Jade Talisman for Extinguishing Desire, Beheading the Corpse, Transforming Radiance, and Flowing Light* in yellow, and place it before the heart.

At the Gate of Attachment, face the sovereign while holding the blade toward the abdomen. Place a cup of pure water before you. The master stands behind, strikes the teeth twelve times, and recites the incantation:

> *The Middle Corpse, Peng Zhi, styles itself the Central Yellow,*
> *Dwelling in attachment, hiding within the abdomen,*
> *Sinking and floating, transforming without fixed form,*
> *Seizing the human hun and po, roaming the Three Palaces,*
> *The Red Child races wildly, driving one to madness,*
> *Desire consumes the spirit—guilt lies with the tiny worm.*
>
> *True Person Jia Yi, summoned by the Celestial Emperor,*
> *Bears the jade talisman, the cinnabar script and golden seal,*
> *Inscribed in the Primordial Register. The Three Desires are extinguished.*
> *By the command of the Primordial Beginning, the Corpse’s form is beheaded and eradicated,*
> *Its root severed, its lineage exterminated—let it not take flight!*
>
> *Jia Yi undergoes refinement, the Five Talismans sustain without grain,*
> *True immortals settle in peace, light born within the hidden.*
> *The Five Emperors oversee, the Great One arrays the ranks,*
> *Bathed in the Middle Primordial, crowned and robed,*
> *Dissolving the form, escaping transformation, flowing jade radiance,*
> *Ascending to the Supreme Clarity, breathing in the Great Void,*
> *Eternally preserving the natural, boundless as heaven and earth.*

Proceed in order to the Lower Gate to shed the Lower Corpse.

### **Shedding the Lower Corpse**

To shed the Lower Corpse, inscribe the *Lower Primordial Jade Talisman for Extinguishing Desire, Beheading the Corpse, Transforming Radiance, and Flowing Light* in white, and place it upon both feet.

At the Gate of Lower Desire, face south and lay the blade horizontally upon the feet. Place a cup of pure water beneath the feet. The master stands behind, strikes the teeth three times, and recites the incantation:

> *The Lower Corpse, Peng Jiao, glories in gluttony,*
> *White and chaotic, its body without fixed form,*
> *Dwelling in the human feet, stirring emotions,*
> *Whispering gains and losses, roaming as the hun and ling,*
> *Disturbing the Three Palaces, the Red Child restless,*
> *A tiny worm of desire, trading in the dark netherworld.*
>
> *True Person Jia Yi, the Three Refinements now purified,*
> *The Gate of Desire sealed, no longer receiving demonic essence.*
> *By the urgent command of the Primordial Beginning, the Three Terraces descend to the court—*
> *Depart swiftly, hide not, nor your brethren,*
> *Nor your ninefold descendants! All forms beheaded at once.*
> *The Five Emperors deliver the True, the Great One records the name,*
> *Bathed in the Lower Primordial, crowned and feather-robed in azure,*
> *Transcending the Three Realms, drinking primordial essence,*
> *Dissolving the form, escaping transformation, ascending to the Supreme Clarity,*
> *Treading the void in dark steps, the Three Radiances shining as one.*

**The Great Perfection’s supreme path must not be lightly transmitted.**

Once the Three Realms are transcended, one then traverses the path of the Five Sufferings. The method for *dissolving form and escaping transformation* to ascend beyond the Five Paths requires the preparation of a new set of robes, headscarf, and shoes. Upon the first gate of the *Gate of Accumulated Suffering of the Heart*, inscribe in black the *Jade Talisman for Dissolving Form, Escaping Transformation, Extinguishing Hell, and Flowing Radiance*. Place it beneath the feet, stand facing north, and the master strikes the teeth five times, reciting the incantation:

*"Dissolve form, escape transformation,*
*Cast off the corpse’s five tribulations.*
*The Three Desires now purified,*
*Divine nectar inwardly irrigates.*
*Shed the old, refine the new,*
*Body fragrant as orchid and sweet herb.*
*The jade talisman erases traces,*
*No earthly bonds constrain.*
*Ascend through heaven’s realms,*
*Surpassing the clouds’ edge.*
*The Demon Kings guard the True,*
*Qi merges with the natural.*
*Seven ancestors ascend together,*
*Treading the steps of heaven’s gate.*
*The Five Emperors oversee,*
*All spirits hear and witness."*

Upon completion, remove the headscarf and untie the knots, bury the talisman beneath the feet, and discard the shoes. Proceed next to the *Gate of the Spirit of Love and Desire’s Suffering*.

Upon the *Gate of the Spirit of Love and Desire’s Suffering*, inscribe in white the *Jade Talisman for Dissolving Form, Escaping Transformation, Extinguishing the Wind-Blade, and Flowing Radiance*. Place it beneath the feet, stand facing west, and the master strikes the teeth seven times, reciting the incantation:

*"Clouds drift, steps take flight,*
*Escaping transformation in jade light.*
*Dissolve form, erase traces,*
*Loose hair soars free.*
*No bonds in the human realm,*
*Riding the void’s expanse.*
*The Heavenly Demons now guard,*
*The Five Paths open wide.*
*Cross beyond wind-blades,*
*Form ascends to the Upper Palace."*

Upon completion, bury the talisman beneath the feet and proceed in order to the *Gate of the Suffering Form of Greed and Desire*.

Upon completion of the rites, begin from the eastern tablet, bow twice, and declare: "I, so-and-so, of the rank Wang Jia, now offer a living substitute to transform my form and alter my name, passing through the gates of the Three Evils and Five Paths. Unable to endure the suffering of form and soul, I have received the celestial grace in full." Proceed thus through the thirty-two southern tablets to complete the reception.

Inscribe in blue on white silk, place upon the head.

**Jade Talisman of Radiant Escape for Dissolving Form, Concealing Transformation, and Transcending the Wind-Blade:**

**Jade Talisman of Radiant Escape for Dissolving Form, Concealing Transformation, and Transcending the Crushing Stones:**

The five talismans, inscribed as prescribed, are buried at the gates of the Five Paths of Suffering.

Having received the Great Dharma for dissolving form, severing corpses, and emitting radiant jade light, one passes through the midst of the Three Evils and Five Paths. Without a substitute to take one’s form, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus will not permit passage through the Three Realms. Thus, one offers oneself as a substitute, enlightening the Three Offices of the Upper Heavens. Upon receiving the names bestowed by the Five Emperors, the body escapes the gates of the Three Evils and the midst of the Five Sufferings. The Earthly Offices no longer restrain it, and form and soul ascend as immortals.

The one who substitutes for another’s form may later be appointed to the position of Chief Scribe of the Three Offices. Following the regulations, after 240 years of meritorious service, they too may attain the rank of Perfected. The substitute must not be a vulgar or unworthy person; suitability alone suffices. They should possess delicate bones, a fair countenance, a gentle and humble disposition—only then will both parties conform to the Dharma and achieve immortality.

**Jade Talisman of the Water-Mother Stone Mirror and Essence of Jade:**
Inscribe in yellow on a round blue-green silk, place within water. The recipient of the Dharma washes and bathes in the Jade Pool, causing the body to emit light and receive the Perfected both internally and externally. By regularly inscribing and washing with it, the spirit becomes luminously penetrating, and after nine years, one naturally attains immortality.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity’s Register of the Primal Beginning and Jade Instructions of the Great Perfected*.
