**The Great Register of the Four Dipper and Twenty-Eight Constellation Celestial Emperors**

In the reign year of [such-and-such] under the Great Year Star, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, in the [such-and-such] district, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, [so-and-so], male or female, named [such-and-such], aged [such-and-such] years, born on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, belonging to the [such-and-such] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper and affiliated with the [such-and-such] constellation among the Twenty-Eight Mansions of the Heavens—now your servant [so-and-so] humbly presents this pledge of faith and holds fast to these vows:

For the whole of my life, I shall receive and uphold [this register] without daring to treat it lightly, betray my master, or rebel against the Dao. I shall not turn to heterodox teachings, nor harbor malice, obstruction, or perversity. I shall not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or unjust. I shall cherish and nurture the common people, reverently honor the myriad spirits, abstain from all wine and meat, purify body and mind, eschew greed and desire, and forsake hatred and envy. I shall deliver and save all beings, eradicate the thousand evils, harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, protect the state and bring peace to the people, assist the sovereign, and propagate the sagely Dao. I shall not flatter or fawn, nor slander or defame. I shall be humble and yielding, putting others before myself, steadfast in purity and sincerity, earnest and diligent in familial harmony. In serving superiors and engaging with subordinates, I shall regard them as my own limbs.

Should I violate this covenant or forsake the true for the false, may I, [so-and-so], and my seven generations of ancestors be consigned to the hells, suffering the winds and blades for ten thousand kalpas, without recourse to plea. This is in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Mystic Capital.
