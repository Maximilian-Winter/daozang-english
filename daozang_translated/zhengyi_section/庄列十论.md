### **Discourse One: Zhuang Zhou’s Dream of the Butterfly**
All things share a single root; right and wrong arise from the same qi. What is Zhou? What is the butterfly? To recognize Zhou as not the butterfly is to fail to forget the self. To cling to the butterfly as not Zhou is to fail to forget things. When self and things stand in opposition, the ten thousand forms become entangled—deeming them unequal is but delusion.

Things are not things in themselves; even the butterfly is not real. The self is not the self in itself; even Zhou is an illusion. How, then, could there be division? Fluttering in dream as a butterfly, the butterfly knows no Zhou. Awakening in clarity as Zhou, Zhou knows no butterfly. This is the singularity of perception and the equality of things.

Those who regard the body as private and cling to the ten thousand things, taking waking perception as the reality of affairs and the mingling of spirits in sleep as the emptiness of dreams, fail to see that a single night’s waking and dreaming are but the opening and closing of one form, and the opening and closing of one form are but the coming and going of one nature. Transforming into a thing, one grieves; returning to human form, one rejoices. Yet what is there to grieve in things, or to rejoice in being human? This is merely the endless flux of the ten thousand transformations.

To secretly cherish one’s form is delusion. Only through great awakening does one know the great dream; only through the true person does one attain true knowledge. The dreamer does not know waking, so does not take the dream as false. The waking one does not know dreaming, so does not take waking as real. Zhou does not know the butterfly, so does not take the butterfly as unreal. The butterfly does not know Zhou, so does not take Zhou as real.

The numinous source is profound and still, yet knowledge arises wherever it touches. Transformations succeed one another, and it meets all without preference—yet the mind has never known. Thus, this discourse establishes the principle of losing the self to open the gateway of equalizing things. It takes the dreaming butterfly of Zhuang Zhou to fulfill the meaning of equalizing things.

Alas! The whole world slumbers; the world is but one dream. The tree of the sacrificial altar warns men through dreams; the tortoise of the Primordial Lord seeks the hare through dreams. The laborer of the Yin family finds joy in dreams; the man of Zheng who catches a deer sues over it in dreams. Huaxu wanders the emperor’s realm in dream—wherever the dream reaches, one rests in what is encountered, knowing it is illusion and not real. Why should this case be any different?

Those who attain the Dao loosen what obstructs to open its barriers, still the mind to gather its emptiness, cultivate sincerity to generate spirit, and embrace stillness to return to illumination. They see the world’s gains and losses, right and wrong, honor and baseness, success and failure, life and death as but dreams and illusions. Why doubt only Zhou and the butterfly?

The true persons of old slept without dreaming and awoke without sorrow. Through this discourse, I have come to know that Zhou’s tale is no mere allegory.

### **Discourse Two: The Butcher Who Carved the Ox**
Those who abide in the self-emptiness of things tread the ten thousand transformations and remain ever unobstructed. Those who cling to things as real respond to a single path and become mired.

Yet things are not things in themselves; their essence is inherently free. The Dao is unobstructed—where is there need for carving? To speak of "carving the ox" is to merge the mind with things without ever seeing the ox, to ride the void and follow the principle without ever wielding the blade—carving the ox without carving.

Moreover, the knife has been used for nineteen years, enduring the cycles of yin and yang—no short span. It has carved thousands of oxen, adapting to the world’s changes—no small number. One might suspect it worn, yet its edge remains as if newly sharpened. This is because clinging to traces means change in an instant, while grasping the root means constancy through the ages.

The wondrously still essence moves yet does not waver; the luminously empty function enters the dust yet does not stain. If even the body is afflicted, who could wield such a knife? If all things are illusory, what ox is there to carve? The knife exists because it can preserve; the ox exists because it can be established. When self and things merge, ability and object vanish. Roaming freely in the ancestor of the ten thousand things, its emptiness is unobstructed.

Thus, it never strikes yet the great gaps part on their own; it never guides yet the great cavities open on their own; it never contends yet what is uniform aligns on its own; it never acts yet the sinews and bones arrange themselves fittingly—how much more so in great famine! With this, the blade moves smoothly without the labor of responding to things. The knife’s motion is subtle, without the intent to compete with things. Releasing the knife, there is no burden of lingering things. Raising the knife, there is no pursuit of fleeing things. When its use ends, it is carefully stored away, returning to non-use. This is why the knife is never harmed.

Yet the supreme Dao is nowhere yet everywhere; its wondrous function responds without responding. The hand responds to touch without knowing the hand; the shoulder rests against something without knowing the shoulder; the foot treads without knowing the foot; the knee bends without knowing the knee. The heavenly mechanism unfolds, and none knows it; the great function is without preference, yet all is as it is. This is why the knife’s reach is vast, leaving ample space.

Once the mind perceives the ox, the burden of carving arises, and the art of preserving life is already harmed. This is why the skilled butcher replaces his knife yearly, while the mediocre butcher replaces his monthly—his blade breaks.

This knife is neither ancient nor modern, for time cannot contain it; neither long nor short, for measure cannot circumscribe it; neither new nor old, for transformation cannot alter it; neither thick nor thin, for substance cannot define it. Its inherent hardness is not tempered yet remains firm; its profound function is not quenched yet remains bright.

For this butcher, its use is as effortless as earth scattering upon the ground, while for the mediocre butcher, every task appears fraught with difficulty. Viewed through the Dao, in dissolution there is no dissolution—without obstruction, dissolution is unrecognized; in obstruction there is no obstruction—without dissolution, obstruction does not arise. When the skilled butcher observes the mediocre, he dissolves their obstructions; when the mediocre observe the skilled butcher, they obstruct his dissolution. When both dissolution and obstruction are forgotten, there is only emptiness.

Tracing back to Zhuang Zhou’s intent, he employs the butcher’s parable to illustrate the primacy of nurturing life. Yet why does this nurturing follow the teachings of *Equalizing Things* and *Free and Easy Wandering*? When every thing is fitting, those confined by the burden of form cannot wander freely; when every thing is one, those bound by distinctions of great and small cannot equalize things. Thus, to remain humbly among things, letting the blade glide through the mire of entanglement, is to preserve life without harm.

Only one who is inwardly without self can wander freely in the realm of self-attainment. Only one who is outwardly without things can equalize things in the domain of ultimate oneness. Embodied thus in the Dao and roaming among the ten thousand things, where then is any obstruction? Therefore, Zhuang Zhou introduces the analogy of butchering the ox, and Prince Hui attains through it the art of nurturing life.

**On Hiding the Boat in the Ravine, Third Discourse**
Viewed from the perspective of non-being, the true and constant abides in profound stillness, enduring without end. Viewed from the perspective of being, the great transformation shifts imperceptibly, and all passes in the blink of an arm. Those who grasp this perceive within the realm of flux the unchanging source. Thus, floating dust may merge with the vast void, and the tip of an autumn hair may contain the expanse of heaven. Entrusting the ten thousand transformations to that which does not transform—should one attempt to carry it away, where could it be taken?

Those who fail to grasp this observe their finite lives and cling to the realm of inevitable wandering. For them, the flame of a lamp is extinguished, and the later flame is not the earlier one; the body changes, and the present self is not the former self. Though they strive to hold fast, all slips away into obscurity. This is why Zhuang Zhou offers the analogy of hiding the boat in the ravine.

The ravine and the marsh serve as the function of emptiness and clarity, washing away the mindlessness of creation. The boat and the mountain are things of movement and stillness, exemplifying the corporeality of form. The Dao is one alone, and this oneness is inherently without direction—yet the ravine and marsh are bound by direction. Oneness is inherently without form—yet the boat and mountain possess form. When oneness follows movement and stillness, roaming within direction, or when it is deluded by emptiness and clarity, confined by form, then oneness becomes dual. There is flourishing and decline in opposition, new and old in opposition, life and death in opposition.

Oneness is without duality, thus it moves alone, comes alone, without past or present. Duality entails pairing, thus things take shape, vie with one another, arise, and perish. Therefore, to hide fire in fire is one, but to hide it in water extinguishes it. To hide water in water is one, but to hide it in earth buries it. How much more so for the boat and mountain, which possess form, or the ravine and marsh, which possess direction—if one grasps and hides them with intent, then there is mind. Yet the Creator has never begun with things, and so at midnight, it can carry them away.

Nevertheless, only one who is not a thing can master things; only one who does not transform can master transformation. Swift as a gallop, fleeting as a breath, it abides not for an instant. Transformation is thus without constancy—I know this well. This is how the Creator deludes the myriad beings, and how those with minds falsely perceive existence and annihilation. When the mind exists, things exist; when the mind perishes, things perish. One may hide the boat in the ravine, believing it secure, unaware that not even the slightest trace has ever stood firm. Suddenly, it is lost at midnight, and one believes it gone, unaware that not even the slightest trace has ever moved.

Only one who knows the great constancy that sustains all can roam where things cannot reach, and all is preserved in freedom. Where things cannot reach, where all is preserved in freedom—this is where the ten thousand things strike, where the single transformation abides. The ancients hid the world within the world through this principle. The world is the oneness of the ten thousand things, and humanity is but one among them. If one truly attains this oneness in its wholeness, then knowing that the ten thousand transformations have never had an end, movement is never not oneself. Thus, the beginning and end of heaven and earth are all as one desires, without aversion. Compared to those who rejoice in encountering every human form, how can their joy be measured?

The ancients have spoken of this: "All things are complete within me. Turn inward and be sincere—there is no greater joy." This joy is such that the deluded use it daily yet remain unaware, dwelling in their bodies, mingling with others, flowing with things through the inn of creation. How could Zhuang Zhou speak of hiding the world within the world?

**On Yan Hui’s Sitting in Forgetfulness, Fourth Discourse**
The mind is not yours—who possesses it? It is but the accumulation of habits, a borrowed name. The body is not yours—who possesses it? It is but the harmony of a hundred bones, a phantom arising. Knowing the mind is without mind, and the ten thousand things are all your mind—what need is there to suppress brilliance? Knowing the body is without body, and the ten thousand forms are all your body—what need is there to cast off limbs?

How much more so for benevolence and righteousness, for rites and music? If this is so, then in movement and stillness, speech and silence, there is nothing that is not the wondrous state; in freedom and constraint, reversal and compliance, there is nothing that is not celestial wandering. Who would recognize this as forgetting? Otherwise, to weary of disturbance and seek stillness, to fear existence and delight in nothingness, and call this forgetting—then clods of earth and heaps of dust could also be called forgetting.

Yan Hui approached the sage yet did not fully attain it; he surpassed the multitude yet had more to learn. Following the self-emptying of the single transformation, comprehending self and other—this is the sage.

Following all circumstances as they pass, clinging to the presence of things—this is the multitude. Comprehending the absence of things, then nowhere is not forgetting. Clinging to the presence of things, then at no time can there be forgetting. Is this what Yan Hui meant by "sitting in forgetfulness"?

Reversing the flow of the myriad things’ transformations, obscuring the unchanging source of the single nature—gazing in stillness upon the world, then benevolence and righteousness, rites and music are all but empty names. Illuminating in quiescence the numinous source, then limbs and senses, hearing and sight are all but illusory perceptions. Forgetting things and there are no things, then empty names fall away of themselves. Forgetting the self and there is no self, then illusory perceptions are exhausted of themselves.

Yet benevolence and righteousness, rites and music do not name themselves; the deluded grasp them as names. Limbs and senses, hearing and sight do not perceive themselves; the illusory recognize them as perceptions. Know the body as fundamentally non-existent, then limbs will naturally fall away. To insist on their falling away is not yet free from the view of the body. Know the mind as fundamentally unborn, then hearing and sight will naturally be cast off. To insist on their casting off is not yet free from the view of the mind.

Moreover, if limbs and senses, hearing and sight no longer exist, how can benevolence and righteousness, rites and music remain? Formerly, one acted with virtue upon the liver and diaphragm, and every thing was known; now, there is no knowing. Formerly, one toiled the mind between the brows and lashes, and every thing was seen; now, there is no seeing. Is this not "sitting in forgetfulness"?

Yet once it is called forgetting, Confucius would not tolerate questions, Yan Hui would not tolerate responses. How could one know the benefit of a single hair, or the harm of a single hair? How could one know that forgetting benevolence and righteousness, rites and music is but the beginning, while the casting off of limbs and senses, hearing and sight is the ultimate?

Viewed from the wondrous: the fallen forget their chariots, the drowned forget the water, humans forget the protective Dao, fish forget the rivers and lakes—this too is forgetting. Viewed from the coarse: the successful forget their form, the greedy forget truth, the angry forget the wheel tracks when they bare their arms, the grasping forget the market crowd when they seize gold—this too is forgetting.

Shall we say that one is right and the other wrong? The Dao has no right or wrong. Shall we say that one is true and the other false? The Dao has no true or false. Yan Hui turned his back on the dust and returned to the wondrous, diminished the substantial and gathered the empty—this is all. I know he forgot, yet he had not yet forgotten. Had he advanced further in this Dao, not forgetting would also be forgetting. This is why Confucius lived sixty years and underwent sixty transformations. What then is the value of forgetting?

*Master Ji Xian’s Physiognomic Discussion with Master Hu, Fifth Chapter*

The wondrous workings of spirit never display their marvel, and things that receive its marvel never know its marvel—this is what we call spirit. Those shamans, however, deceive with words of spirit, proclaiming to others matters of life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise. Though their predictions may prove accurate within years, months, or days, seeming marvelous yet not truly marvelous, they merely resemble spirit. Now, this shaman is named Ji Xian, for he embodies the marvel of things that respond to resonance. Moreover, *xian* implies resonance, and resonance implies a heart. When one uses one’s own heart to resonate with another’s heart, one’s own perceptions to see another’s perceptions, then false names arise—life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune. Once names are false, perceptions become false. Once perceptions grow ever more false, words become false. Those in the world who cling to appearances and cannot transcend delusion then falsely accept them as true, taking them for reality and fleeing in haste. Even Liezi, upon seeing this, became intoxicated in heart, for he had not yet cleaved his heart. His Dao had not yet reached Master Hu, for he had not yet abandoned learning. Thus, others could read his fortune.

Now, the Hu vessel takes emptiness and indestructibility as its essence, depth and unfathomability as its function. You, however, employ the Dao of emerging from the mother to engage the world, and so you lodge the formless within the realm of form. Ji Xian, being one who resonates with heart, declares with each encounter, “I see.” Master Hu, being one who responds without heart, declares with each arrival, “I reveal.” He who is without heart treads form beyond the bounds of form—how could Ji Xian read his fortune? He transcends calculation before the realm of calculation—how could Ji Xian know him? Ji Xian remains burdened by form and calculation, never free from perception, taking what he sees as the locus of life and death, from which there is no escape.

Thus, at first, Master Hu revealed to him the *earthly pattern*, and Ji Xian sighed at his death. Next, he revealed the *heavenly expanse*, and Ji Xian rejoiced at his life. He did not know that death is not inherently death—when the heart diminishes, death arises. Life is not inherently life—when the heart stirs, life arises. The life and death of form are the arising and ceasing of the heart; the arising and ceasing of the heart are the presence and absence of perception. The perfected person has never possessed a heart. At rest, they share virtue with yin; in motion, they ride the waves of yang. Sharing virtue with yin, Ji Xian could not perceive him—thus he revealed the *earthly pattern*, for pattern is where things intermingle. Riding the waves of yang, Ji Xian could not perceive him—thus he revealed the *heavenly expanse*, for expanse is where things arise. When he revealed the *Great Harmony*, Ji Xian deemed it uneven. The *earthly pattern* is where yin overcomes yang; the *heavenly expanse* is where yang overcomes yin; the *Great Harmony* is where neither yin nor yang prevails—this is the equilibrium of heaven and earth. The myriad dharmas are of one essence, originally without high or low, yet Ji Xian saw them as uneven. Still, these three are called *mechanisms*, for they are the subtle stirrings that precede perception, and thus he could perceive them.

When Master Hu revealed to him *that which has never departed from my origin*, he revealed what lies beyond all revelation. Ji Xian approached with solidity, but Master Hu responded with emptiness. Ji Xian offered something to receive, but Master Hu offered nothing. Ji Xian’s arising heart and labored perception were finite, while Master Hu’s detachment from humanity and concealment in heaven were infinite. To measure the infinite with the finite—this was his peril. Thus Ji Xian fled at the sight of him and vanished when pursued.

Nevertheless, when Master Hu told Liezi, he said, “This is seeing my *mechanism of the withered virtue*,” and again, “Perhaps he saw my *mechanism of the good*,” and again, “This is seeing my *mechanism of balanced qi*.” In each case, he said “my,” still establishing a self. But when I empty myself and go along with things, I do not know who or what I am. Even I lose myself—who then reveals, and who then reads the fortune? Thus, he fled.

Master Hu’s heart is the Great Void. The essence of the Great Void is empty, luminous, wondrous, and profound, upholding the ten thousand things. Adorn it with glory, and it does not linger; strike it with blades, and it is not harmed; drench it with water, and it is not soaked; scorch it with fire, and it is not burned—all for this reason. Master Hu’s heart, when mourned with death, receives it without aversion; when congratulated with life, receives it without joy; when named unevenly, receives it without contention. In the end, Ji Xian lost himself and vanished, yet Master Hu did not take this as victory or gain—all through this emptiness.

Zhuang Zhou, in discussing the *Responding to Emperors and Kings*, speaks of this. For emperors and kings to respond to the world, they must be still and unmoving, thus able to resonate and fully penetrate. They must withdraw and conceal themselves in secrecy, thus able to share in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people. If one were to emerge from the origin, fretting over the world as one’s own concern, enslaved by the ten thousand things rather than enslaving them, could others then read your fortune? This is why the ancient ones who responded as emperors and kings were vast and beyond all naming.

*On Xiangwang Obtaining the Dark Pearl, Sixth Chapter*
North of the Red Water’s source, yang is contained yet does not flow. The body of Kunlun’s mound is tranquil and unyielding. This illustrates the nature that is self-originating. Gazing south, one engages with things and perceptions arise; returning, one traverses movement and revolves. This illustrates the nature that returns to the origin. Once the nature of heaven opens, dusty realms arise together. Once human artifice settles in, the Great Dao is lost—is the Dark Pearl what remains? Yet nature cannot be known through others—who then could employ it? Nature cannot be known with heart—who then could seek it? Employing it is not gathering emptiness; seeking it is not silent accord.

These three—intelligence exhausted in what it desires to know, eyes spent in what they desire to see, mouths wearied in what they desire to speak—yet the Dao is never attained. For what reason?

Drifting dust gathers into clods, yet the wondrous Dao abides in all; shards and husks, chaff and refuse—within each the utmost truth resides. Near, it is not sought in brows or lashes; far, it does not depart from the formless prior. Flowing forth from the realm of the square inch, it sprawls across the space of daily use. Pursue it, and the dark mountain stands before you yet grows ever more distant; inquire of it, and the great courtyard seems not remote yet all is lost in confusion. For it cannot be grasped by seeking.

Moreover, nature is fundamentally without knowing, yet what is called knowing is not true knowing; nature is fundamentally without seeing, yet what is called seeing is not true seeing; nature is fundamentally without speaking, yet what is called speaking is not true speaking. If one knows through this nature, seeking knowledge only leads to delusion in knowing; if one sees through this nature, seeking sight only leads to obstruction in seeing; if one speaks through this nature, seeking words only leads to bondage in speech. Call it "image"—it seems to exist yet does not truly exist. Call it "illusion"—it seems not to exist yet is not truly absent. Abandoning knowledge, the deluded become numinous; abandoning sight, the obstructed become clear; abandoning speech, the bound become free. This is how illusion alone attains it.

When one probes the root of the Dao, even a sage like the Yellow Emperor, being sagely, loses it; a fool like Illusion, being without intent, gains it. Yet when one fathoms the origin of the Great Dao, a single nature is without nature—attainment is not sageliness; a single truth is without truth—loss is not commonality. Before, in losing it, the Yellow Emperor suffered not the slightest lack. Now, in gaining it, Illusion gains not the slightest thing. Once ancient and eternal, the solitary revelation of true constancy emerges—great delusion and great numinosity, one and all, become awakened nature. How could one know that the failure of the three was not wrong, while Illusion’s attainment was not right? Thus, even the Yellow Emperor was set apart.

**Zhuangzi’s "Discourse on the Joy of Fish at Hao Bridge," Chapter Seven**
What all things share is their oneness. What oneness shares is the Dao. Where the Dao extends, there is no origin from which it comes. The living live of themselves, yet life fundamentally has no life. The formed take form of themselves, yet form fundamentally has no form. All that spreads among appearances, sounds, and colors—none lacks this Dao. Why should I choose among things?

The allotment of a single nature is full and without lack; the wandering of a single heaven is carefree and without burden. Things and I both possess it. Only those who harmonize with the knowing of things and self—here, there is knowing without seeking to know, a wondrous and obscure accord, a principle silently met. The spirit first receives it, and none can escape its prior wandering. This is how Zhuangzi knew the fish’s joy above the Hao Bridge.

Emerging to leap, swimming to glide—without the trouble of gasping foam, without the peril of nets and snares—at ease within a single stretch of water: is this not the fish’s joy? If this is joy, even *Qi Xie* knows it—why wait for Zhuang Zhou to know it? For the fish’s joy lies in the Dao, not in the water. What Zhuang Zhou knew lay in joy, not in the fish.

Only when the fish forgets the water is its joy complete. Only when Zhou forgets the fish is his knowing whole. Supreme joy is without joy—the fish does not know the joy of its joy. True knowing is without knowing—Zhou does not seek to know yet knows. Yet Zhuang Zhou, in this accord beyond all things, would remain wordless. Huizi, once joined with him in a bond beyond opposition, would remain unquestioning.

Zhuangzi was not incapable of silence here; Huizi was not incapable of awakening. To say there was no question would leave Zhou’s words without ground; to say there were no words would leave the Dao’s wonder unseen. They would only sever the world’s posterity from the delusion that Zhou and the fish were two.

If things are each their own, then Zhou was certainly not the fish—how could he know the fish’s joy through knowing me? If I am my own, then the fish was certainly not Zhou—how could I know that I do not know the fish’s joy? Knowing and not knowing are but the Dao’s branches—this is why Zhou asked to follow its root.

Its root was never unknown. The ancients spoke of it: the eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth—none differ. In myself, they are all alike. Seeing death as life, seeing wealth as poverty, seeing Zhou as fish, seeing others as swine, seeing myself as others. In things, they are all alike. If alike, then every thing reaches its wandering, none without its wondrous place—why only above the Hao Bridge? If alike, then every thing is true joy, none without heaven’s harmony—why only the minnow’s joy?

I know that Zhou and the fish were never separate. Thus, in *Autumn Floods*, it begins with the River Lord and the North Sea’s Spirit boasting of their small and great domains; then with the worm Kui and the snake Feng pitying their realms of having and lacking. How could one not know that the oneness of things is the wholeness of joy? Thus, Zhou entrusted the minnow’s joy to complete his meaning, and the discourse on supreme joy arose from this.

The ancients who understood that supreme joy is without possession often revealed it in their words: "What joy? What sorrow?"

**Zhuangzi’s "Discourse on the Drunkard Falling from the Cart," Chapter Eight**
Clinging to things as real, what one sees is indeed the cart. Taking the self as substantial, what one knows is indeed the fall. With knowledge and perception established, riding and falling divide—how could there be no harm? Yet the drunkard, wholly given to wine, knows nothing, sees nothing; riding, he does not know the cart; falling, he does not know the ground; his body does not know the impact, the impact does not know the wound. All is undivided, congealed into one.

Even this temporary entrustment of wholeness to wine suffices to transcend life and death and forget fear—how much more the wholeness of heaven’s nature, which has never departed? The world is but a single cart. Those who entrust themselves to riding it, inwardly opening the bustle of knowledge and perception, outwardly chasing the turmoil of illusions—once they topple into the realm of delusions, it is not merely injury to bones and joints or the intrusion of fear.

Once the celestial nature is opened, the ten thousand forms all enter—like the sober man watching the cart overturn, how could there be no harm? Yet at the inception of form, heaven and earth arise with me as one; before the origin of numbers, the myriad things and I are undivided. What then is the cart? What is the man? What is the fall? What is the injury?

When mind and things stand opposed, the celestial is opened and the human enters; when mind and things merge, the human departs and the celestial remains. Cast aside contrivance, and what follows is the principle of heaven. Dissolve all distinctions, and what rests is the harmony of heaven. Movement without trace is called celestial wandering; action without disturbance is called the mechanism of heaven. That which nothing can perturb is the joy of heaven; that which nothing can adorn is the harmony of heaven. By this, one aligns with heaven without aid; by this, one serves heaven without toil. This is called wholeness in the celestial.

Those who regard gain and loss, joy and sorrow, life and death, prosperity and adversity—are no different from the drunkard who falls from the cart. Tracing the intent of Master Zhou in expounding this in the "Attaining Life" chapter, he declares: all that is born must perish, and all that perishes must be born. Knowing that life is fundamentally non-arising, one inwardly observes no mind, outwardly observes no body, and broadly observes no things. Only then can one unify one’s nature without duality, nurture one’s qi without depletion, harmonize one’s virtue without separation, and penetrate to the source of things without obstruction. Where then is there no heaven?

Form is whole in heaven, yet form has never truly existed. The ear is whole in heaven, yet sound has never truly arisen. The eye is whole in heaven, yet color has never truly appeared. The mouth is whole in heaven, yet flavor has never truly manifested. This is called wholeness in the celestial.

This chapter first illustrates with the drunkard’s fall from the cart, then follows with the unbroken stalk that does not snap under the weight, and then with the craftsman’s mind that does not resent the flying tile. Why is this? Things are inherently non-existent—what mind is there for existence? I am inherently non-existent—what mind is there for things? Things and I were never divided. Thus, the fallen are not harmed, the stalk is not broken, and the tile is not resented. All is the self-emptiness of heaven. Yet because it stands in contrast to the human, it is called heaven. If nature itself is without nature, how much less can there be heaven? Because it stands in contrast to the open, it is called the hidden. If heaven itself is without heaven, how much less can there be the hidden? Only by awakening to this does one grasp the sublime essence of *Attaining Life*.

**Discourse on the Guarding of the Dao, Ninth Chapter**
Those of old who spoke of the Dao asked: where does the Dao reside? They answered: there is nowhere it does not reside. If one seeks it in being—has this not been said by the ancients? In the ancient, it is not ancient; in the present, it is not present; in yin, it is not yin; in yang, it is not yang. In the distant, it does not leave the space between the brows; in the near, it alone stands before images. In gathering, it flows forth into the ten thousand beings; in scattering, it withdraws into the tip of a hair. Does the Dao truly have a place?

If one seeks it in non-being—has this not been said by the ancients? In heaven, it is heaven; on earth, it is earth; in the valley, it fills the valley; in the abyss, it fills the abyss. It is present in the ant and the worm, in the tile and the shard. Does the Dao truly reside in non-being? Non-being is not devoid of presence—it is named "non-being," yet true non-being is not non-being. Being is not confined to being—it is named "being," yet true being is not being. That which is present in all presence cannot be named as either being or non-being.

Those of old who illuminated the wondrous omnipresence of the Dao in the world dared not liken it to form or measure, dared not demarcate it with boundaries or distinctions. Instead, they observed its constancy through past and present, its oneness amid diversity, and reluctantly called it the "great body of the ancients." This is like the moon reflected in ten thousand waters, like the single wind roaring through ten thousand hollows, like the single qi accumulating into ten thousand forms, like the single Dao giving rise to the myriad things. The divine and enlightened attain it and descend to manifest; emperors and kings attain it and bring forth creation. Heavenly and earthly beings attain it without departing from their source; spiritual beings attain it without departing from their essence; perfected beings attain it without departing from their truth. The sage transforms through it; the noble person practices kindness and benevolence through it. It is the standard for the arts of governance and calculation, the pattern for the texts of poetry, books, rites, and music.

Those of old who took this as the guarding of the Dao were not burdened in mind—thus it cannot be called a "technique of the mind"; not carved by intellect—thus it cannot be called "intellectual guarding"; not a mechanism—thus it cannot be called "mechanical guarding"; not a skill—thus it cannot be called "technical guarding." To call this guarding the Dao is to encompass its vastness. Alas! The great wholeness was shattered by the scattering of the Dao and virtue. The hundred schools and masters, following their own views, became mired, believing the guarding of the Dao resided in their particular teachings.

Some, unmoved by life or death, delighted Mo Di and Qin Guli. Some, valuing others too much and themselves too little, delighted Song Jian and Yin Wen. Some, mocking the exalted and rejecting the sagely, delighting in irresponsibility and abandoning conduct, delighted Peng Meng and Shen Dao. Some, taking humility as their standard and embracing emptiness and selflessness, delighted Guan Yin and Lao Dan. These masters, whether through solitary burden or relentless clamor, whether through doctrines of life and death or vast domains, became trapped in the Dao. Their guarding, in relation to the Dao, is like a clod of earth in a great marsh, like a grain of millet in a vast granary, like a pebble on a great mountain, like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body.

From their particular perspectives, these schools diverge, yet when viewed from the Dao they have attained, one cannot perceive their divergence. Why is this? A single pebble and Mount Tai are equal in forming a body; a grain of millet and the Grand Granary are equal in completing a count; a clod of earth and a great marsh share emptiness; a hair’s tip and a horse’s body are both complete. Though the Hundred Schools split the Dao in myriad directions, in their great essence they have never departed from it.

Alas! Without the Hundred Schools, there is no Great Completeness; without the Great Completeness, the Hundred Schools cannot stand. Without the Hundred Schools, the Great Completeness cannot be seen; without the Great Completeness, the Hundred Schools have no foundation—their origin is one.

Those who dwell in the Great Completeness all day yet do not know it are the common people. Those who aspire to the Great Completeness yet have not attained it are the worthy. Those who have fully realized the Great Completeness and dissolved near and far within it are the sages. Yao and Shun passed it to each other; Yu and Tang transmitted it; the Duke of Zhou gazed upward and pondered it; Confucius immersed his heart in it; Mencius cultivated its vastness; Yi Yin was first to awaken to it. Zhuang Zhou’s writings culminate in this chapter, profoundly embracing the root of the Great Dao, forcefully rejecting the flaws of the Hundred Schools, yet ultimately employing absurd and boundless discourse, placing himself among the latter of these masters, deeply concealing the traces of his authorship, to gaze upon later generations. Who would say Zhou was obscured by heaven and became a one-sided scholar?

**Discourse on Master Song Hua’s Forgetting Illness, Chapter Ten**

Song is where fire resides and shines; yang is a nature ever floating and moving. Dwelling within is not profound; blossoming scatters and severs the root. Hua, in his infancy, was like a child, but in middle age, he sank deeply into the illness of human artifice. Forgetting returns temporarily to the nature of heaven—yet to call this an illness is the malady of the vulgar world, not the affliction of delusion.

Thus, movement opens heaven to generate wisdom; stillness conceals heaven to preserve profound silence. When virtue has a heart, it acts upon things; when things have knowledge, the heart is enslaved by them; when knowledge of things is established, the mind is disturbed. The forgetting of one’s original state is tranquil and not delusion; the cessation of false emotions is deemed an illness. How could one know that the ancients, in speaking of attaining the Dao, necessarily prized forgetting?

When people forget each other in the arts of the Dao, it is authenticity. When fish forget each other in rivers and lakes, it is their nature. Having feet, one wears shoes—not truly forgetting the feet, yet the shoes fit. Having a waist, one wears a belt—not truly forgetting the waist, yet the belt fits. Rising and falling with smoke, one forgets fire; steering a boat with divine skill, one forgets water. The drunkard falls without injury, forgetting the cart; the amputee loses awareness, forgetting the foot. Such forgetting is true. Was Master Hua’s illness near to this truth?

Truth attains unity. To take in the morning and forget by evening is unity in the morning. To give in the evening and forget by morning is unity in the evening. On the road and forgetting the journey is unity on the road. In the chamber and forgetting sitting is unity in the chamber. Not recognizing the past is unity in the present; not recognizing the present is unity in the future. Forgetting taking and giving is forgetting things; forgetting walking and sitting is forgetting place. Ultimately, not knowing before or after is not merely forgetting. How then can this be called an illness?

If it is called an illness, there must be one who suffers it. Yet who suffers forgetting? Never having asked, the household poisons him; when the poisoning does not cease, they divine for him, not knowing this is beyond the knowledge of good and ill fortune. When divination does not cease, they pray for him, not knowing this is beyond the scrutiny of ghosts and spirits. When prayer does not cease, they call the physician, not knowing this is beyond the reach of yin and yang. These three arts have no use here.

The Confucians follow behind and chant, wishing to cure him. Lu, the land of cultural refinement, where Confucians practice the arts of benevolence and righteousness—from here the Great Completeness is sought. Yet if he himself has no doubt, why consult the oracle? If he himself has no fault, why pray for forgiveness? If he himself has no illness, why attack with medicine? To cure his forgetting, they sought to transform his heart, making the heart aware; to alter his thoughts, making thoughts aware of existence. They exposed him to cold to make him know chill, starved him to make him know hunger, confined him to make him know light. The heart, no longer one, became paired with things.

Chilled, he sought clothing; hungry, he sought food; in darkness, he sought light. Seeing was no longer solitary but had an opposite. After seven days of chiseling, the seven apertures of Hundun opened; after one day of removal, the ten thousand forms of the world arose. Enraged, he banished wife and children, knowing they were close to him and reproaching them deeply. Grasping a halberd, he drove out the Confucians, knowing they sought something from him and resenting them bitterly.

Decades of circumstances suddenly gave rise to momentary forgetting. How could this be the same as existence and annihilation, gain and loss, joy and sorrow, likes and dislikes? Before, each was unknown; now, they ceaselessly toil. Without a heart, there is forgetting; with a heart, there is fear. These eight—how could they be enough to burden the heart?

Zigong questioned Confucius in astonishment, for he was submerged in the disputations of broad learning. Confucius turned to Yan Hui and recorded it, for he had attained the emptiness of sitting in forgetfulness. Yet Master Hua’s forgetting illness was not true forgetting. When he forgot, he was obscurely lost; when he awoke, he was suddenly enraged. Is this to take the restless as false and the silent as true?

Yet they knew not that in forgetting, the realm of restless disturbance still abides; in awakening, the wondrous stillness of silence is not far. What fear could there be?

Alas! The heart is originally without heart—it becomes heart through things; thus, when the heart vanishes, there is forgetting. Wisdom is originally without wisdom—it becomes wisdom through knowing; thus, when wisdom penetrates, it becomes virtue. When penetration is complete, one no longer knows forgetting as forgetting, and forgetting itself is forgotten.

The ancients prized sitting in forgetfulness to cast off illumination. Thus conclude the ten discourses of Zhuangzi and Liezi.
