**The Supreme Perfection Jade Register of Great Simplicity**

The *Dongzhen Taishang Dasu Yulu* (*Supreme Perfection Jade Register of Great Simplicity from the Cavern of Perfection*) is of uncertain authorship, likely compiled during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It synthesizes the *Shijing Jinyang Sujing* (*Stone Mirror Golden Radiance Scripture of Simplicity*) and esoteric talismanic texts of the Shangqing tradition. Comprising one scroll, its base text is drawn from the *Zhengtong Daozang* (*Orthodox Daoist Canon*), Zhengyi section.

The *Jade Register of Great Simplicity* was cultivated by the Lord of Jade Dawn. Concealed by the divine envoys of the Five Thearchs within the Chamber of Great Possession in the Upper Palace of Simplicity, those who obtain it may soar through the celestial void, conceal or hide themselves, and be attended by two jade lads and two jade maidens. Secret practice yields swift verification, but leakage invites disaster. One must be meticulous and heed the master’s instructions with utmost care.

The Lord of Great Simplicity, Yuancheng Laozi, is the celestial hun-soul. He governs within the Central Culmen of the Grand Clarity, ever attending the Thearch, presiding over the primordial qi of the True Origin. He is styled the Lord of Great Simplicity and stands in paired attendance with the Lord of Great Harmony before the Thearch.

The Lord of Great Harmony, Huangcheng Laozi, is the celestial po-soul, presiding over the qi of the embryonic origin.

The Lord of Great Simplicity constantly guards the left, while the Lord of Great Harmony ever accompanies the Thearch in his comings and goings. When the Celestial Thearch enters the Purple Tenuity, he resides in the Purple Chamber of the Kunlun Yellow Gate, at the abode of the Great One.

The Three Lords and Three Qi originate from the undifferentiated primordial source, the root of all transformations. Together with Heaven and Earth, they form four; with the manifested body, five. Those who cultivate these five merge with the Dao and attain authenticity.

On the second and third days of the lunar month, at midnight (the hour of *zi*), lie in repose with eyes closed. Visualize your manifested body within the Palace of the Grand Ultimate in the Grand Clarity, where the Thearch resides. Next, contemplate the Lord of Great Simplicity in your left eye, clad in azure robes, wearing a Nine-Flowered Crown, holding green lingzhi in his left hand and a green banner in his right. Then, contemplate the Lord of Great Harmony in your right eye, clad in white robes, wearing a Five-Flowered Crown, holding golden liquid and jade nectar in his left hand and a white banner in his right, standing to the Thearch’s left and right.

The Grand Ultimate has nine names: first, the Grand Clarity; second, the Grand Ultimate; third, the Grand Tenuity; fourth, the Purple Chamber; fifth, the Mysterious Chamber; sixth, the Thearch’s Hall; seventh, the Celestial Treasury; eighth, the Imperial Palace; ninth, the Celestial Capital and Mysterious Metropolis. In essence, the Palace of the Grand Ultimate lies one *cun* directly above the crown of the head, measuring one *cun* square, situated above the Palace of the Six Harmonies.

The Palace of the Six Harmonies is where the divine sovereign of the Great One eternally resides. After visualizing the Three Perfected Ones, further visualize your hun-soul, identical in form to yourself, ascending into the Palace of the Grand Ultimate. There, the Two Elders bestow upon you green lingzhi and golden liquid, which you consume. The lingzhi resembles a lotus blossom, and the liquid is like fine wine. After partaking, visualize yourself bowing twice before the Thearch and declaring:

*"Today, I humbly petition the Thearch in his court. You bestow upon me divine lingzhi, golden liquid, and jade nectar. The Two Elders transmit the register, the Great One presents the writ. May I attain longevity and enduring vision, my lifespan boundless."*

The Thearch replies: *"Fortunate one, observe the times. Return on the second and third days of the second month."*

Upon completion, remain in repose. Through prolonged practice, you shall attain immortality and transcendence.

The Great One is the essence of the embryonic womb, the master of transformations. The hun and po are born of the womb-spirit; invoking the yang, one’s desires swiftly manifest. Disclosure or violation of the precepts brings calamity upon seven generations. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

By ingesting the talisman of the Eastern Marchmount, the divine script unfolds, revealing the Upper Clarity. Cloud chariots welcome you, and you foreknow the myriad affairs. The Five Marchmounts follow the same method: begin with the Eastern Marchmount, then proceed in sequence. After ingesting the eighteen talismanic petitions and seal scripts, transcribe them onto purple silk and place them in a bamboo tube. In the first month, present them at the famous mountains. After submission, conceal them among great stones, ensuring no one discovers them. Take seven *sheng* of yellow earth to make mud, seal the top, and recite the following incantation:

*"I wear the Yellow Script of the Stone Mirror of the Grand Tenuity. Today, I reverently transcribe one copy to return to the Immortal Lords. May I ascend the void, ride the primordial cloud-chariot, be attended by immortal spirits, and join the company of the Perfected."*

Upon completion, apply this method to all Five Marchmounts. Then, the divine texts of the famous mountains and stone chambers will be revealed to you, and miraculous lingzhi and rare herbs will naturally appear.

To craft the seal of the Golden Radiance of the Stone Mirror, burn the seal script and ingest it along with the seal. Suddenly, you shall commune with the divine. The method for ingesting the seal: write it in ink, swallow one seal at a time as a measure. Seal the talismans with the seal, and they will mutually reinforce each other. When ingesting talismans, consume them before meals. Upon ingestion, you may experience chills and fever, but your vision will sharpen. In a moment, a white-robed jade lad or a scholar in proper attire may appear before you—do not be alarmed, for they will soon vanish. After thirty days of such visualization, your body will naturally become light and buoyant. Superior practitioners may ascend into the Clear Void, roaming and feasting in the Upper Clarity. Middling practitioners may elevate their forms a hundred *zhang*, while lesser practitioners may rise ten *zhang*.

After ingesting the eighteen talismans, you shall behold white-robed figures—this signifies your sincerity, and the jade lads and maidens who guard the talismans will reveal their true forms to you.

Before ingesting talismans, first abstain from the five pungent vegetables, meat, and sexual activity. Avoid defilement for a hundred days, then seclude yourself in a quiet chamber, free from the clamor of worldly people. Only then will the Dao be accomplished.

Those who ingest the *Stone Mirror Golden Radiance* talismans must especially refrain from defilement, sloth, and evil conduct. Cultivate the body, contemplate the Dao, and prioritize purification, stillness, and focused devotion.

Those who cultivate this Way may ascend as immortals, befriend celestial Perfected Ones, and commune with the host of immortals. They may summon divine spirits, draw forth golden elixirs and lingzhi herbs, and command traveling kitchens, dragon chariots, feathered canopies, spirit lads, jade maidens, and all the myriad spirits of the world to serve them. There shall be no knowledge unattainable, no desire unfulfilled.

The celestial talismans can repel armies for a thousand miles. If bandits in the world plot against you, they shall suffer misfortune in return. Should they raise the five weapons against you, they shall only harm themselves."

With the jade horse talismans and spirit texts inscribed upon the body, one may stride through the void, roam freely without obstruction, come and go at will. All malevolent forces dare not encroach, and the host of spirits reverently guard. The established patterns take form, the oral instructions held within—masters discern the worthy and transmit them according to fitness.

The *Dark Capital’s Interwoven Girdle: Cavern-True Hidden Writ of Stone Essence and Jade Talismans*
The Supreme Perfected of the Grand Ultimate, the Sage-Lord of Later Saints, received the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme, the Pacing of Heaven’s Net and Treading of Flying Records*, and transmitted it to the Azure Lad of Square Vessels. He in turn passed it to Perfected Wang, who bestowed it upon those of steadfast integrity and destined for immortality. In the eleventh year of the Yonghe reign of the Jin, the *yimao* year, on the ninth day of the seventh month, Perfected Wang at Red King in Linhai transmitted it to Xu Yuanyou. After purification rites, gold dragon and jade fish offerings, and ascent of the altar to swear oaths, the contract was split in two. After seven years of cultivation, one may ascend into the formless, spirit-transform without limit, and follow the heart’s desire—such is the practice of this Way.

The right column proceeds as above.

The *Three Radiances of the Grand Cavern Talisman*
Pearls gather radiance, green sheaths emulate the sun,
revolving clouds blaze bright, the Red Lad wields the numinous,
mysterious flames scatter light, the whirlwind’s form is pure.
Such is the power of the sun, the fruition of the spirit.

The sixteen-character true writ: the Golden Portal Sage-Lord plucked and served the flying root of the Upper Dao. The Supreme Primordial Perfected received it from the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. Also named the *Canon of Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother*, it is the *Hidden Characters of the Five Emperors Within the Sun* and the *Eight Simplicities’ Interwoven Girdle True Writ*, totaling two hundred characters. These are the secret names of the Five True Spirits of the Nine Heavens’ mutual resonance. One who bears this writ receives the characters of the Five Emperors Within the Sun, seals them, and wears them on the left elbow, naturally gaining sagely wisdom, understanding the affairs of the five directions, roaming the Five Marchmounts, sealing mountains and summoning seas, commanding the ten thousand soldiers, controlling ghosts and spirits. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, spirit lads and jade maidens shall attend you. Ten thousand trials shall not touch you, and the Way of seeking immortals is complete. It must not be transmitted to the world.

Daoists of steadfast integrity who encounter a true master shall ascend the altar to receive it, swearing the unbreakable oath of the gold dragon and jade fish. Upon completion, the master takes the gold dragon and jade fish and bestows them upon the recipient. Inscribed in yellow on azure as ground.

*Here ends the Jade Register of the Supreme Primordial of the Cavern-True.*
