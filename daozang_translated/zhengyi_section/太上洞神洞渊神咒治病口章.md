Let all who emerge don their solemn attire, crowns and pendants, and arrange their majestic regalia. Let them array their processional insignia, rank upon rank, standing in solemn formation.

Before, behind, left, and right of us, your servants, let each wield blades outward, ordering weapons and staves. Let a thousand voices chant in unison, ten thousand in harmony.

Three paces from us, let them regard one another, awaiting the Direct Merit Officers—each wearing a Heaven-Reaching Crown, clad in black single robes, girded with Dragon-Tiger Talismans, and wielding Vajra Halberds—seven hundred twenty thousand.

Before us, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers—each wearing a Vermilion Yang Headband, clad in crimson ceremonial robes, girded with Heaven-Reaching Spears, and wielding Luminous Swords—seven hundred eighty thousand.

Behind us, the Soaring Heaven Great Generals—each wearing a Five-Colored Crown, clad in brocade armor, girded with Hundred-Forged Blades, and wielding Nine-Bend Blades—four hundred thousand.

To our left, the Fierce Horizontal Great Generals—each wearing a Dark Yin Crimson Headband, clad in Seven-Jade Black Robes, and girded with Hundred-Forged Black Halberds—nine hundred thousand.

To our right, the Merit Officers above, the Registrars below, the Heavenly Officials to the left, the Earthly Officials to the right, the Civil Officials before, and the Martial Officials behind.

The Five-Colored Banners flutter in majestic order. They ride chariots and mount steeds, dragon and tiger cavalry. Those on foot and in palanquins proceed in ranks.

The Azure Hosts in the east, the White Hosts in the west, the Crimson Hosts in the south, the Black Hosts in the north, and the Yellow Hosts at the center.

The shield-bearers advance, the archers follow. The Bandit Officers to the left, the Guardians to the right. Drums and bells resound, horns echo—deep and thunderous.

The Five Marchmounts’ armies patrol the streets. The Four Seas’ armies blockade the nine provinces. The armies of Kunlun’s Jade Capital overflow. The voids within and without respond in unison.

Command the various Ghost Kings to order the demonic soldiers, each to slay the ghosts.

Now, from [so-and-so] prefecture, county, village, and household, [so-and-so] man or woman petitions:

Descendants of ancient officials, common folk by custom, we have, through a thousand years’ fate, entered the Daoist gate. As latter-day followers, we submit to the Great Dao, privately rejoicing in its grace.

Yet, through unclear devotion, we have incurred *qi*-afflictions and attracted misfortune. Of late, our households suffer ill fortune, our dwellings harbor calamities—ten thousand miseries, countless disasters.

Moreover, [so-and-so] has, for [so many] months and days, suddenly fallen ill, with symptoms [as described], fearing survival is unlikely.

We have heard that the Dao can reverse death and restore life. Those who surrender to it are never left unaided. Petitions that reach the throne are never unanswered. The grace lies with the Supreme Ones; the matter rests with the Overseers.

We, your foolish servants, uphold the Three Caverns’ decrees, unable to bear the urgency of the suffering before us. Great and small, high and low—we kowtow, beat our cheeks, and plead in earnest, seeking deliverance.

Unable to endure the sight of this mortal’s desperate plight, like a candle in the wind, we prostrate ourselves, presenting this oral petition once, laid upon the jade table before us.

As the petitioner’s words are recorded, we humbly submit each matter. We dare not transgress the rites, though much remains to be said.

May it be that today, the Direct Talismanic Envoys who hold the case, the Overseers, the Guiding Attendants, the Left and Right Announcers, the officials in charge of affairs, the Upper and Lower Plain Women, the Merit Scribes, the Left Millet and Right Sacrificial Officers, and the Case-Holding Clerks—seven hundred thousand each—ascend together with this petition, facing the Celestial Courts, that every matter may be judged and decided, every document transmitted and delivered, all clearly and distinctly.

May the Merit Scribes and minor clerks, once assembled, descend to heed the oral petition of your servants. When the matters are concluded, may each return to their palaces and resume their positions as before. Let the exchange of officers and soldiers be commanded by the Celestial Courts. May every matter be judged without delay; let no stagnation occur. Those who cause delay shall be the first to face punishment.

May the timing be opportune for transmission, allowing the Dao’s qi to flow downward, covering the mortal in need. May the afflicted recover swiftly, and may those who recover bring merit to the officers and soldiers. Let their merit be reported to the Celestial Courts, their ranks elevated, and their positions advanced. May all inform one another.

From the officials above to the spirits within heaven and earth, may the ghosts afflicting the sick be seized and driven away one by one. May the illness be cured, and may the Jade Maidens of healing attend to them. May every action be carried out in accordance with the ailment, and medicine dispensed as needed. May the inspectors below verify the treatment, addressing each condition according to its symptoms, ensuring clear recovery, with merit and reward for each cure.

Should any among the myriad ranks bear resentment toward the officials, soldiers, or healing officers, let them be furnished with treasured needles, medicinal tools, and the company of Master Lu and Bian Que, leading the Kings of Medicine of the world, along with three hundred sixty Healing Merit Scribes and twenty-four thousand Minor Life Officers. May seven hundred thousand Jade Lads be entreated to descend, responding to the petition in full array. Let recovery be swift, restoring health and mobility.

With dragon’s ascent and tiger’s tread, may health and fortune abide, free from all else.

Respectfully, with utmost sincerity, this petition is humbly presented for review.

From the Great Mystery Capital, the Orthodox Unity, the Balanced Qi Lineage of the Celestial Master, the Yangping Abbey, the Three Caverns Disciple, the Perfected of Mount [X]—your servant [Name]—kneels and bows twice to submit this address:

In accordance with the documents, [Name], a Daoist official of such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, aged [number] years, along with [number] household members, male and female, hereby declares the following as stated.

The entire household, born of womb and bone, is blessed with descendants. Yet like ants in the grass, we remain mired in vulgar customs, unenlightened. Through the cycles of birth and death, we have attained this present form—raised in the wilds, unable to distinguish the six livestock. Misguided by false beliefs and inverted views, we have strayed for kalpas untold. Our past lives bear the weight of a thousand years’ fate, and only by fortunate encounter have we entered the realm of pure transformation. We have embraced the teachings of the Dharma, pledged ourselves to the Great Dao, and, though but sprouts in the field, have been counted among the people of Heaven, a cause for private joy.

Yet this flesh-bound servant has violated the hundred virtues in manifold ways. My transgressions are as scattered as a wolf’s tracks, so grave that the Three Officials weigh them heavily, bringing misfortune upon me. Of late, afflictions great and small, illnesses, calamities, demonic apparitions, and malevolent spirits have plagued my home, draining wealth and fortune, while inauspicious dreams haunt my nights. Moreover, my illness has grown severe, with sufferings too numerous to recount. Though family tends to me, no relief comes. I have prayed to the myriad spirits and made offerings, yet to no avail. Now, beset by hardship, I fear I may not survive. Pressed from above and below, I lack the resolve to rouse myself. I have consulted diviners far and wide, yet the tortoise-shell and milfoil reveal no favorable omen.

I confess that from the thirty-six generations of my great ancestors and forefathers, there have been offenses against the curses of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, the Five Earth Gods, the curses of water and fire, and the transgressions of the Five Covenants and Seven Curses. The sins of my forebears have incurred the judgments of the Three Officials, bringing harm and depletion to the living. Thus, my life has been beset with hardship, and my affairs have been fraught with misfortune.

I fear that my seven generations of ancestors, during their lifetimes, defied Heaven and betrayed Earth, committing the five acts of rebellion and unfilial impiety, usurping rulers and seizing thrones, murdering sovereigns and lords. They may have wronged regional governors, high ministers, the Three Dukes, the Nine Chamberlains, the Directors of the Imperial Secretariat, the celestial ministers, or the starry hosts. Some may have deceived the gods and scorned their teachers, reviled and humiliated their parents. Others may have spurned sacred teachings, acting recklessly and self-servingly. They may have desecrated the pure abodes and tranquil sanctuaries of the gods, stolen others’ oxen, horses, livestock, or wealth, and when exposed, invoked the wrath of Heaven and Earth. They may have deceived the gods by calling upon the sun, pointed at the stars, or cursed one another beneath the altars of earth gods and ancestral temples, dying in wild places or through mutual retribution. The dead have drawn one another into endless cycles of suffering, leading to utter annihilation. Descendants have called out to one another in an unbroken chain, their torments in the underworld unceasing, extending calamity to later generations.

I further fear that my seven generations of ancestors, while serving in official posts, wrongfully killed the innocent and harmed the good and virtuous. They may have falsely accused and imprisoned worthy men, or seized others’ slaves, cattle, horses, and property, unjustly taking lives without reason. Some may have plotted against uncles and other kin, seizing their wealth, engaging in incestuous relations, or committing unspeakable acts. They may have murdered a man to take his wife, or schemed from both sides, sowing discord between two states. They knew not whose father they killed, whose son they harmed, whose husband they murdered, whose wife they took. They knew not whose state they plotted against, whose lord they harmed, whose ruler they slew, whose minister they betrayed. They knew not whose mother they killed, leaving whose child orphaned, whose goodness they deceived, whose worth they destroyed. They knew not whose possessions they stole, whose wealth they plundered, whose ancestors they felled, whose descendants they slaughtered. They knew not whose house they burned, whose lineage they extinguished. From generation to generation, the dead among my seven ancestors may have committed such sins, drawing the living into their retribution.

If any of my ancestors died by drowning, I pray they may be interred by water, their inner and outer selves cleansed and radiant. If any perished by fire, I pray they may be buried by fire, ascending as soaring immortals without hindrance. If any died by the sword, I pray they may be buried by the blade, their weapons sharp and auspicious for posterity. If any died in prison or the marketplace, I pray they may be buried there, their sufferings flowing away, ensuring no further misfortune for generations to come. If any were crushed by falling rocks, I pray they may be buried beneath them, their path unobstructed, with verdant grasses flourishing forever. If any were slain by tigers or wolves, I pray they may be buried by these beasts, their pelts and markings bringing boundless fortune through ten thousand kalpas. If any died by oppressive forces, I pray they may be buried thus, their rest undisturbed, their descendants forever secure. If any died of illness, choking, hanging, strangulation, or execution by the sword, may they each be interred according to their fate.

I further fear that those among my ancestors who met such deaths did so on inauspicious days, under ill-omened stars, their spirits condemned to the Three Officials and the Twenty-Four Hells. Some may have been forced by the living to labor in abandoned earth-god shrines, carrying sand and stones day and night to fill rivers and seas, never resting. The tormented dead have pleaded with the celestial bureaus, seeking to replace themselves with the living, thus bringing grave illness, peril, and misfortune upon me. All this stems from the inauspicious deaths of my ancestors, whose suffering harms the living, as they conspire with a hundred ghosts to deplete and afflict us. I fear that in their lifetimes, on the days they took wives, moved homes, or were buried, they violated taboos and prohibitions. Their deaths were ill-starred, their sins unexpiated.

Now I invoke the Eastern constellations—Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket—to extract and absolve the accumulated judgments and condemnations of my seven generations of ancestors and thirty-six generations of forebears, dissolving them entirely. May they ascend to the ranks of celestial beings, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided. If any remain in the Three Wretched Realms or the Eight Difficulties, may they each be delivered. If my seven generations of ancestors and forebears strayed from the Dao into heresy, their transgressions as vast as mountains, yet unabsolved, I pray that a hundred and twenty minor Perfected Officers and a host of celestial generals descend to harmonize and heal them. May they dispel all misfortune, expel malevolent ghosts, and drive away the specters of epidemics and wandering plagues, seizing and confining them all.

May the sins of my seven generations of ancestors—those of the five rebellions, the countless transgressions, the offenses against Heaven and Earth, the unforgivable crimes—all be pardoned and absolved, their judgments resolved. May my seven generations of ancestors and thirty-six generations of forebears who died by the sword, in bonds, by official execution, in prison or the marketplace, or were crushed by wood or stone, or perished from festering sores, drowning, burning, or were left unburied in distant lands, each be interred according to their fate. If in moving homes, marrying, building dwellings, or other undertakings, my seven generations of ancestors and thirty-six generations of forebears violated the baleful stars or the inauspicious lunar mansions, acted against reason, encountered adversity, or offended the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, or Hook Star, or the eight divine prohibitions, bringing misfortune, or if their burials or relocations transgressed the Great General of Disaster—may all such offenses be resolved.

May the Year Star and Great Yin, the clashes and baleful stars, be resolved. The Five Divisions’ piercing deceits and the Twelve Life-Mandating Deities; the monthly establishments, the Five Deficiencies and Six Expenditures; the celestial Year Star and the hidden dragon within the dwelling; the seven prison wardens and the spirits of wells and hearths; the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Six Harmonies, and Hook Star; the abodes of the Heavenly Queen, Heavenly Void, Heavenly One, Merit Clerk, Messenger, Grand Unity, Ascending Brightness, Heavenly Rigidity, Follower, River Marshal, Great Auspice, and Lesser Auspice; the Dipper’s encroachment; the yin and yang on all four sides, the inscribed baleful influences, the clamorous corpses, and the Six Harmings; the high merits and low merits, the celestial merits and terrestrial merits, the water merits and earth merits, the metal merits and wood merits; the ghosts of inauspicious times and the calamities of litigation and torture; the green merits, red merits, white merits, black merits, and yellow merits; the celestial fines and terrestrial fines, the green fines, red fines, yellow fines, white fines, and black fines; the ghosts of spilled water and polluted pools, the ghosts of withered groves; the spirits of relay stations and talismanic temples, the ghosts of food and drink; those who delight in blood sacrifices and money, the impure and unrighteous deities; the Mountain and Forest Elders, the Twelve Stream Women; the Male Elders and Female Elders, the Greater Elders and Lesser Elders, the Green Elders, Red Elders, White Elders, Black Elders, and Yellow Elders; the hundred hunting ghosts on the move, the destructive and slaying subordinate officials; the residual qi of mountains, rivers, temples, and shrines, the myriad malevolent ghosts and deities, the supplications and curses; the celestial prayers and terrestrial prayers, the great prayers and small prayers; the Three Examinations of the Southern Village, the Life-Mandating Great King; the deities of crossroads, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors; the Fuxi General, who styles himself among the Five Hegemons; the Slaying General, the Celestial Heart Governor; the Great Deity of the Nine Rivers, the Twelve Water Emperors; the Five Paths General and his left and right aides; all the prohibiting officials and the roving hunters of the Four Seas; the travelers on the roads, the Five Deficiencies and Six Expenditures; the Five Poisons and baleful winds, the Twelve Unyielding Ghosts; the qi of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, both pure and turbid; the years overlapping months, the days overlapping hours; may all ghosts, bandits, and entanglements that linger be distinguished and, in accordance with the times, dispersed and dissolved on all four sides, along with the curses.

From the Five Hegemons of the Yellow Emperor onward, the ghosts of ruined armies and slain generals who escaped the blade, the strange apparitions that gather and coalesce into malevolent spirits; the essences of cliffs, stones, grasses, and trees, of insects, rats, dragons, and snakes, of foxes, tigers, leopards, and crows, the myriad essences; the subordinate officials and residual qi of the Six Jia, Six Yi, Six Bing, Six Ding, Six Wu, Six Ji, Six Geng, Six Xin, Six Ren, and Six Gui, the ghosts of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches’ prohibitions in the twelve hours—may all such malevolent spirits, as they pursue one another, whether riding in chariots, on horseback, or on foot, be resolved. May the ghostly soldiers who bar the way and seize the souls of the living, harming the people of heaven, summoning the dead, and entangling the living through the unresolved oaths and curses of seven generations of parents and thirty-six generations of forebears, be dispersed.

From what place do the deceased seven generations of parents of this household come? What are their surnames and clans, and from which marriages do they derive? From which prefecture, county, village, and hamlet did they depart on the day of their death? What were the names of the officials who presided over their burials? To which stellar officials do they belong, and which constellations govern them?

The Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket—these Seven Stars of the Green Dragon govern them. Their position pertains to the East, to Jia and Yi, to the Green Emperor, the Year Star, and the essence of wood. They preside over the first, second, and third months of spring, the years, months, days, and hours of Yin, Mao, and Chen. At the onset of spring, when wood is in its prime, it can dissolve the essence of earth.

The Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall—these Seven Stars of the Black Tortoise govern them. Their position pertains to the North, to Ren and Gui, to the Black Emperor, the Chronographic Star, and the essence of water. They preside over the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months of winter, the years, months, days, and hours of Hai, Zi, and Chou. At the onset of winter, when water is in its prime, it can dissolve the essence of fire.

The Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Net, Turtle, Hairy Head, and Triaster—these Seven Stars of the White Tiger govern them. Their position pertains to the West, to Geng and Xin, to the White Emperor, Venus, and the essence of metal. They preside over the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of autumn, the years, months, days, and hours of Shen, You, and Xu. At the onset of autumn, when metal is in its prime, it can dissolve the essence of wood.

The Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Axletree—these Seven Stars of the Vermilion Bird govern them. Their position pertains to the South, to Bing and Ding, to the Red Emperor, Mars, and the essence of fire. They preside over the fourth, fifth, and sixth months of summer, the years, months, days, and hours of Si, Wu, and Wei. At the onset of summer, when fire is in its prime, it can dissolve the essence of metal.

The Seven Stars of [missing text] govern the Center, pertaining to Wu and Ji, to the Hook Star, Saturn, and the essence of earth. They preside over the intercalary months, and when earth is in its prime, it can dissolve the essence of water.

The twenty-eight lunar mansions and thirty-five stellar officials to which the deceased belong—may the celestial soldiers resolve their entanglements in accordance with the circumstances.

Since the beginning of heaven and earth, the deceased have lived and died. The dead may have committed grievous sins in their past lives, unforgivable transgressions. Cast into the Nine Dark Hells of the Long Night, they suffer for all time—thirst quenched by icy water, hunger fed by iron pellets, fire and smoke forced down their throats. For a thousand kalpas and ten thousand eons, they cycle through the Five Paths, wandering in filth and ash, dragged through the Eight Difficulties, shamed in the Three Disciplines, forever bound to the realm of hungry ghosts, with no hope of escape. Unable to endure such torment, they reach out to the living, draining vitality, bringing a thousand misfortunes—illness in the household, great and small misfortunes, and all manner of afflictions.

When *zhu* comes from the east, sever it with metal. When *zhu* comes from the south, extinguish it with water. When *zhu* comes from the north, repel it with earth. When *zhu* comes from the west, dissolve it with fire. When *zhu* comes from the center, exorcise it with wood. The *zhu* of the Five Phases, each in its proper position, will naturally cease and vanish.

If there is an ominous black qi in the east, I humbly invoke the Nine Billion and Nine Million Soldiers of the Azure Emperor Lord, leading seventy myriad azure troops, to exorcise and dissolve it.

Should the pestilential afflictions of the five directions, the Yellow Slave Brothers seventy-two in number, and the plague-bearing ghosts ride the wind and mount the sparrows, entering the homes of men to await their moments of weakness and seize their young, may all be gathered, severed, and banished ten thousand *li* away. Moreover, the *zhu* ghosts of the five directions, styling themselves Meng Tian, Chi Jing, Ji Liang, and Wang Zu, each leading a thousand men, enter homes to seize the young, bringing malarial fevers. Also, the malevolent ghosts of the five directions, calling themselves Wu Emperor, Han King, Wu Zixu, Duke of Zhou, and Great Ministers, specialize in causing abdominal distension.

I further invoke the Qiungqi, devourers of ghosts, seven hundred myriad in number, to descend together in succession and consume them, allowing none to escape.

Moreover, I, [Name], of high and low station in this household, declare: in this life’s encounter, I have been numbered among the Dao’s followers, yet I have failed to respond with devotion to the Dao, and my offenses have not been sufficiently prolonged. My household is not harmonious. Now, afflicted by illness and distress, I fear I cannot escape. I have heard that the great Dao succors all things; none who surrender themselves to it fail to receive its grace. Yet my original master is distant, and my pleas cannot reach him. Seeing that I share the same dharma as you, I hasten to welcome you to my home, beseeching a written petition to save and cure myself.

To you, who hold office and bear the beauty of the dharma’s qi, I declare my inability to fully proclaim the dharma’s power as I witness the calamities and distress of this household. With trepidation, I prostrate myself and humbly submit this petition, one document addressed to the Heavenly Courts, along with offerings to the Five Emperors.

Or slain others’ fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters; or harmed others’ masters, extinguishing their lineages; or stolen scriptures, defamed the true and upright, defiled sacred texts, betrayed the Dao to embrace heterodoxy, forsaking truth for falsehood.

Or uttered vicious curses, groundlessly slandered, or recklessly slighted gods and spirits with idle speech; or beneath the sun, moon, and stars, within village altars, talismanic shrines, or sacred precincts, or beneath trees, in the wilds, or by wells and hearths, jointly performed binding prayers.

Or in Daoist or Buddhist halls of healing, burned incense and swore oaths, invoking Heaven and Earth, pleading before the gods, claiming grievance or righteousness, forgetting gratitude for favor, and failing to requite the gods. After death, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, enduring interrogation. The deceased, bitter and distressed, unable to extricate themselves, lodge complaints in the celestial courts, dragging the living into their suits.

The ghosts of three-case and five-case judgments, the curses of myriad evils and the hundred gods, together invade the household, ceaselessly wreaking havoc. We beseech that, following this memorial, each be dissolved and eradicated, that no longer may baleful infesting ghosts or wayward spirits recklessly cause harm.

Should any of the thirty-six generations of the deceased stubbornly persist, we pray the Twelve Lords of the Five Directions’ Release, with their one hundred twenty officials, descend as one to resolve for this household all interrogations of curses and binding prayers from former lives, thoroughly pacifying and dispersing them, that they may no longer harm the living.

If any resist and refuse to depart, we pray the Lord of Execution and his one thousand two hundred officials descend as one to this household, seizing and expelling the lingering deceased qi, malevolent gods, evil ghosts, and all manner of spirits, driving them into the wild mountains, allowing no lingering.

Should any act with violence, we beseech that, following the submission of this oral memorial, the afflicted swiftly recover, the household remain free of misfortune, wealth and treasure flow in, blessings and prosperity daily increase, all wishes be fulfilled, and every direction yield compliance.

For all the lords, generals, officers, and soldiers who have rendered service in capturing and aiding, we shall, on the three auspicious days of the triennial assembly, submit a comprehensive memorial detailing their merits and recommending promotions, sparing no effort to honor our vows.

With gratitude, we implore the Most High to discern and heed our plea. Your humble servant, in reverence, respectfully entrusts this to the Inner and Outer Officials, the Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the Merit Registrars, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Decree Officers, the Chariot of Scarlet Talisman Officers, the Officers of the Rushing Wind Couriers, and the Memorial-Mounted Steeds Officers—one hundred twenty each—to carry out the task.

Your servants, in utmost sincerity, on behalf of the living man or woman of such-and-such household, whose parents, siblings, spouse, and children suffer misfortune, whose illnesses of such-and-such nature are grave, whose life hangs in peril, and who fears for survival, humbly invoke the Celestial Officials to dissolve the qi of curses and binding prayers from thirty-six generations past, to disperse baleful infestations, sever all lingering ties, restrain and admonish demon-kings, capture ghosts to treat illness, and substitute for life to seek deliverance.

Together with the Lords of the Land to the left of the altar and the right of the sacred altar, they shall accompany the memorial upward and ensure its delivery to the plain-clad men and women of the Celestial Courts, guaranteeing its unimpeded transmission.

Should the text of the memorial be improperly written, stained, or misaligned, let it be corrected with the Dragon-Head Writing Knife and the long-haired, sharp-tipped brush, amending errors, filling omissions, and ensuring its perfect conformity, so that no official in the upper courts may reject or return it.

Should any subordinate officials, baleful qi, demonic spirits, or ghostly bandits intercept or obstruct the memorial along its path, let them be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, to be punished according to the law.

We entreat that this oral memorial, submitted by your servants, proceed directly to the presence of the Most High Lord of the Limitless Dao, the Most Venerable Lord Lao.

Let the Left Lord pass through the gates, the Right Lord ascend the steps, and all officials transmit it in proper sequence, each according to their rank.

Your servants, being of humble and unenlightened minds, fear that we may have violated the statutes or failed in the rites of reverence. We humbly beseech the boundless grace of the Most High to pardon each and every transgression.

Should there be malicious persons on all sides who recklessly scheme or slander, let all such be averted and dispelled.

We pray that what is submitted be heard above, what is requested be granted below, what is summoned arrive, what is transformed be transformed, what is treated be healed, what is condemned be destroyed, what is suppressed be subdued, what is dissolved be dispersed, and what is released be freed.

Let the Merit Officers and Messengers distinguish the urgent from the routine, ascend without delay, and take care not to linger.

Your servants prostrate themselves upon the earth, awaiting your decree. We shall hold our breath as if for three meals.

The submission of this oral memorial is now concluded. Next, we present it to the officials.

The aforementioned emissaries now dispatched—your servants’ inner Merit Officers, Messengers, Generals, and attendant hosts—shall each return to their stations within your servants’ bodies. All shall pass through the Gates of Myriad Wonders, reentering in proper sequence. The Directing Messenger and Chief Attendant shall take their places: those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right. They shall coil about the bones, weave through the hundred vessels, encircle the entire body, and encompass heaven and earth. Descending, they enter the Cinnabar Field; ascending, they rise to the Mud-Pill Palace, adhering fast within your servants’ bodies. The five viscera and six bowels, the Seven Governors and Nine Palaces, the Twelve Chambers, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the hundred-and-eighty joints and mechanisms—all shall resume their hidden offices, arrayed in their proper positions, without confusion or disorder.

The Generals and attendant hosts previously summoned shall each return to your servants’ bodies, entering the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber. When your servants later issue the call, they shall emerge again, performing their duties as before.

Next, the Incense Officers and Messengers are summoned to invoke the Dragon and Tiger Lords at your servants’ left and right, and to urgently call forth the Messengers of the Five Directions. Your servants’ oral memorial is now concluded.

May the stillness of this chamber spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms before this incense flame. May your servants attain the true qi of the Dao, thereby achieving long life and transcending mortality. May all people ascend as immortals. May your servants’ names be stricken from the registers of death and inscribed anew in the ledgers of life. May the white-clad men and women, the jade youths, and the boy and girl attendants all guard the incense smoke, so that what your servants have presented may proceed directly to the throne of the Most High, Utmost, and Boundless Dao—the Perfected Jade Sovereign of the Three Heavens.

The oral memorial for healing through the incantations of the *Highest Clarity’s Divine and Abyssal Dao* is now complete.
