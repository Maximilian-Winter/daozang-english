Zhen Zhen Duo Zhi, Right Director, Divine Sacrificial Wine Officer Xi, associated with water, stationed in Jintang County of Hanzhou, corresponding to the *Bi* constellation, during the fourth month of the solar term *Lesser Fullness*.

The disciple of the Dharma Register, so-and-so, whose fate is governed by the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper’s such-and-such star, now respectfully offers Dharma tokens and presents himself at the gate of such-and-such Dharma Master to receive the *Orthodox Unity’s Register of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars*. Dispatched to inspect the famous mountains, rivers, marshes, and lakes of the Nine Provinces; the Five Peaks and Four Floods; the Five Lakes and Four Seas; the thirty-six states; and the twelve thousand townships and villages—traversing the upper, middle, and lower primal extremities, encompassing east, west, south, and north—summon all malevolent ghosts and black legions of the myriad demons to appear without delay or evasion. Heal the myriad people, and in accordance with the Dharma, subdue and register the twelve hundred ghosts. May the ten thousand spirits ever attend at his left and right, prolonging life and augmenting years, eliminating misfortune and transcending calamity.

Upon receiving and wearing this register, so-and-so shall abide by all regulations and covenants. Should he violate them, he willingly accepts the punishments of the netherworld and dares not harbor resentment. Through diligent cultivation and sincerity, he shall be appointed this very day. The vanguard clerks and soldiers, previously summoned by the Divine Lord of the Luminous Dao of the Central Realm, now present themselves to receive their commissions. Respectfully submitted.

**The Supreme Sovereign’s Talismans for All Lords**
Inscribed in vermilion on peachwood slips, one foot and six inches in length, the center of the slip sealed with the talisman of the Heavenly Emperor’s Envoy. The talisman board is entrusted to the jade clerks and soldiers, bound with hempen cords and sealed with silk, to be deployed as needed for summons and inquiries. Do not disclose this true and precious talisman. Do not summon without cause. Those who carry this register and talisman shall be recognized by all ghosts, who will cross their hands, raise their staffs, and bow their heads beneath the Supreme Clarity to receive it. Ghosts who disobey shall be beheaded and executed. Hasten! As the statutes and ordinances command.

When first receiving the talisman, the disciple swears before the August Heavenly Lord of the Great Dao, the Penetrating Supreme Sovereign of the Nine Palaces’ Primal Extremity, that divine youths and jade maidens shall attend him, escorting him to ascend and roam the Nine Heavens. In all his comings and goings among men, whatever he summons shall arrive instantly, daring not to violate the statutes and ordinances.

Wang Yanling knows this through contemplation, ensuring that people remain free from illness. Entering water, they shall fear no winds or waves; entering battle, they shall not be harmed by armor or weapons. All shall proceed in accordance with the statutes, laws, and ordinances.

Summon ghosts with the left cord, and the spirits shall arrive instantly. Those who wear the talisman shall be feared by all ghosts. Knowing the names of the great ghosts, none shall dare to cause harm. The names of the earth spirits of all provinces govern their respective counties, townships, and villages within their domains. The earth altar lords must not permit malevolent spirits, ghosts, or demons to consume blood offerings. For the great and small mountain spirits who do not submit, summon them in accordance with the Dharma, and the ghosts shall respond like an echo, arriving instantly. Hasten! Summon and inquire into the origins of matters as required.

The method for transmitting talismans: adjust the color and dimensions according to the recipient’s birth year. Provide one knife and one pair of rings. The talisman master takes one ring and the accompanying items, while the other is given to the principal to retain as a token of the master’s talisman authority. Those deemed capable may be appointed with the approval of Xu Shen. Do not transmit to unworthy recipients. The principal must examine and deliberate carefully. How could one not be cautious?

Hasten! As the statutes and ordinances command.

To perceive spirits in the ghostly realms: take white quartz, one ghost general named Ghost Supervisor, and poria, three ingredients in equal measure. Grind them finely, and ingest a one-*cun* measure—ghosts shall appear.

Another method for perceiving spirits: take white quartz, fuling, and anemarrhena, three ingredients in equal measure. Grind them finely, and ingest a one-*daogui* measure—ghosts shall appear at once.

Another formula: magpie fledglings, red quartz, azurite, and night-glowing powder; or onion seeds, lindera, white quartz, and anemarrhena powder—all enable one to see ghosts, who shall then fear the living.

The celestial talismans bear constant decrees, and when your servant arrives,
The ghostly spirits of the Northern Dipper all flee in terror.
Preserve life and extend longevity—
The Azure Dragon attends on the left,
The White Tiger attends on the right,
The Vermilion Bird leads the way,
The Dark Warrior follows behind.
Thirty-six immortals support and guard on either side,
One hundred twenty spirit talismans of heaven are bestowed for use,
Earth talismans provide sustenance.
Moving east, west, south, or north,
You walk alongside immortals.
One hundred twenty spirit-envoys are dispatched to command,
To drive away and seize the hundred ghosts.
The Southern Dipper’s life-protecting celestial talisman fortifies the body,
Immortals harness four dragons to swiftly ascend to the Heavenly Gate.
The Most High guards the body—*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with statutes and ordinances!*

*Zhen Gongmu, the Right Metropolitan Qi Master of Sacrificial Rites, affiliated with Water, stationed in Shifang County of Hanzhou, corresponding to the Xinwei and Jihai constellations, during the tenth month of the Lesser Snow solar term.*

So-and-so, a disciple of the Orthodox Unity Register, whose fate is governed by the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper’s [X] Star, being a mortal of flesh born of the womb, a descendant of the hundred officials, has unfortunately contracted an illness of unknown origin. In the present year, the condition has worsened, and fearing it may be caused by malevolent spirits or ghostly specters, unable to distinguish clearly, I now respectfully follow the rites and present ritual offerings at the gate of such-and-such a Dharma Master, beseeching to receive the *Orthodox Unity Great Register for Repelling Malevolence* to capture and subdue them. From the day of receiving the talisman, I vow to examine myself in accordance with the Dharma, severing all ties with malevolent ghosts, just as the statutes and ordinances of the Most High’s Mystic Capital command.

The talisman protects my body—
All residual *qi* and the Five You ghosts, depart swiftly, depart at once!
Know your names—*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with statutes and ordinances!*

The *Zhenping Gangzhi Zuogong Qi* Ritual Master, affiliated with Water, resides in Xinjin County of Shuzhou, corresponding to the *Ji* constellation, during the Great Snow solar term of the eleventh lunar month.

This Dharma Register disciple, so-and-so, whose fate is governed by the such-and-such Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, delights in the Dao and rejoices in the Dharma, having wandered through renowned mountains, traversed rivers and marshes, and aspired to the immortals. Today, I respectfully present:
- one great sword,
- one *shi* and two *dou* of rice,
- one bundle of firewood,
- seven feet and five inches of crimson silk,
- one pair of silver bracelets,
- forty feet of white silk,
- one hundred sheets of paper,
- one inkstick,
- one writing knife,
- one *liang* of true pearls,

as tokens of my solemn vow. I come before the gate of such-and-such a Dharma Master to beseech the bestowal of the *Orthodox Unity Supreme Mystery Hu-Xuan Western Mystery Master Hu’s Miscellaneous Incantations and Four Divisions Register for Suppressing Qi*, to repel malevolence, preserve life, support my family, and aid the state upon wearing it—all in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High.

Next, visualize the *qi* of the five directions:
First, visualize the azure *qi* of the East;
then, the vermilion *qi* of the South;
then, the white *qi* of the West;
then, the black *qi* of the North;
then, the yellow *qi* of the Center;
then, the twenty-four *qi* above the Grand Year Star.

First, visualize and swallow the *qi* above this day;
then, visualize and draw in the *qi* above this hour to swallow it.

Thus concludes the visualization of the *qi* of the five directions and others.

Next, visualize the *qi* of the five viscera:
The azure *qi* returns to the liver, governed by the Azure Dragon;
the vermilion *qi* returns to the heart, governed by the Vermilion Phoenix;
the white *qi* returns to the lungs, governed by the White Tiger;
the black *qi* returns to the kidneys, governed by the Dark Warrior;
the yellow *qi* returns to the spleen, governed by the Yellow Elder Lord.

Wood’s number is nine,
Fire’s number is eight,
Water’s number is seven,
Metal’s number is six,
Earth’s number is five.

To suppress naked insects, use the *qi* of Wood;
to suppress scaled creatures, use the *qi* of Metal;
to suppress feathered creatures, use the *qi* of Water;
to suppress furred creatures, use the *qi* of Fire;
to suppress armored creatures, use the *qi* of Earth.
The method of *qi*-suppression follows the same sequence as before.

So-and-so, devoted to the Dao with utmost sincerity, diligently cultivates prohibitions and precepts, focusing the mind with single-hearted devotion. They humbly request to receive the divine immortal method of *qi*-suppression. The recipient, holding a blade, kneels and bows twice, then performs the stellar method to draw in *qi*, stepping through the twelve hours, beginning with *zi* and executing the Yu step—left foot forward, right foot behind—while reciting the incantations:

As stated in So-and-so’s petition, they are a flesh-born mortal, a descendant of the common folk, fortunate across a thousand generations to be governed by the Lords of the Great Dao, the Venerable Ones, and the *qi* of the Three Masters for self-preservation. Having previously received the esteemed register and office from their master, they have served under their teacher’s guidance but have yet to obtain the oral transmission of the enlightened master. As a humble flesh-born mortal, they now petition the celestial courts, beseeching the cessation of former *qi* and the compassionate bestowal of stellar *qi* to illuminate the Daoist methods. With these, they may propagate the teachings effectively, achieve healing efficacy, uphold the Dao to assist the sovereign, employ the methods to cure illnesses, subdue all ghosts, and ensure the officers and soldiers within their body exert their full power in transmission. Thus, divine merit will be established, ranks and titles advanced, and all prohibitions enforced in accordance with the methods. They further request the twelve *Qi*-Governors and the one hundred twenty officials and generals, as well as the *qi*-suppression generals of the five directions to restrain poisonous insects, tigers, wolves, and the like. Together, these are transmitted into So-and-so’s body, ensuring that all encounters with suppression and restraint bring immediate peace and security. Urgently, as the statutes command.
