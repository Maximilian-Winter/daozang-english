**The Supreme Clarity Highest Jade Dawn Phoenix Terrace Winding Plain Upper Scripture**

The *Highest Jade Dawn Phoenix Terrace Winding Plain Upper Scripture* arises from the Ninefold Winding Phoenix Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, formed by the natural coalescence of phoenix *qi*. Its jade chambers reside above the Nine Heavens, on the yang side of the Jade Capital, where the void generates the Eight Convergences of Realized *Qi*. Ten turns and nine bends pierce the eight directions, summoning the soaring pinions of the whirlwind above and communing with the numinous spirits of the Eight Simplicities on all sides. It gathers the *qi* of the Nine Origins and the Orthodox Unity to compose verses of sorrow and joy, illuminated upon the Mysterious Terrace. Each character spans a *zhang* in breadth, its text resplendent and radiant, penetrating the Nine Heavens. A flying phoenix clouds the canopy; purple *qi* swirls in obscurity. Scaled creatures and bounding beasts interweave in chaotic motion. Six-maned lions stand guard at the lower gates, while the Five Thearch Jade Immortals wield five-colored banners of life-summoning demonic spirits to command the five directions. On the right, the Jade Maidens of Great Flower Mountain attend; on the left, the Golden Immortals and Jade Lads, three thousand each, serve the perfumed rites of the True One. Sun and moon flank its brilliance; the Seven Origins revolve in numinous harmony. The Three Dawns align in splendor; mysterious light illumines all. Jade groves sway their branches; jade pipes resound through the courtyard. The radiance of the Seven Treasures flows and shines in the Supreme Clarity—this is the domain governed by the Highest Jade Dawn Supreme Lord of the Dao.

The Elder of the Mysterious Capital inscribed the phoenix-script verses of sorrow and joy in the Realized Writ and transmitted them to the Lord of the Dao. Thus, the myriad perfected beings of the upper heavens and the flying immortals of the Five Marchmounts ascend the Phoenix Terrace on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month to feast, offer incense, and chant the verses of sorrow and joy. Above, they celebrate the divine perfected; below, they lament the mortal multitudes. Their words are subtle and void, jade-bright and penetratingly clear. The Four Perfected bow their heads; the ten thousand immortals chant in harmony. Incense scatters into the empyrean; fragrant smoke drifts through the empty courtyard.

All who have attained perfected status in the upper palaces, as well as those newly embarking on the path to immortality, must cultivate the *qi* of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix, study the Realized Writ of the Mysterious Mound, and recite the verses of sorrow and joy. From primordial antiquity, this teaching was transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Now, if a worthy recipient appears, it may be passed down thrice within seven hundred years. Those who obtain its text may ascend to the Supreme Clarity, mount the Ninefold Winding Phoenix Terrace, and pay homage to the Jade Perfected. To recklessly divulge it brings blindness; the seven generations of ancestors shall bear the burden. Guard it well, and one becomes a divine immortal.

Whoever bears the Five Thearchs’ banners of life-summoning demonic spirits from the Mysterious Mound of the Great Perfected Writ may command the void, summon spirits, and subdue demons. Whoever obtains the secret talismans of the Five Phases may call back the wandering *po* and secure the *hun*, preserving the spirit for eternal endurance. Whoever recites the verses of sorrow and joy transcends the Nine Mysteries of the body and roams the Jade Capital in feasting delight. Whoever wears the Winding Plain Phoenix *Qi* shall behold the advent of the Sagely Lord of Great Peace, ascend to the Mysterious Capital, and receive the rank of upper immortal.

Thus, the phoenix-script verses of sorrow and joy from the Nine Heavens, along with the Great Perfected Writ of the Mysterious Mound, are formed from the natural *qi* of the Nine Heavens. Their numinous text manifests amid the empty mystery, enduring ninety thousand kalpas before the Elder of the Mysterious Capital received it from the Great Void and transmitted it to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao. The Lord of the Dao passed it to the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, who in turn transmitted it to the Azure Lad of Square Cauldron in the Eastern Sea, instructing him to convey it to Daoists whose jade names are already inscribed—those destined to become divine immortals. After wearing it for twenty years, one may behold the Three Origin Lords and welcome the Sagely Lord at the Golden Gates of the Supreme Clarity. It may be transmitted thrice in seven hundred years, and once every century to no more than two worthy recipients. During the retreat, one must burn a *jin* of fine incense and offer five *liang* of gold. After swearing the golden-blue oath, it replaces the blood-altar covenant.

**The Luminous Verses of Sorrow and Joy from the Highest Jade Dawn Winding Plain**

**Eastern Thearch of the Bluegreen**
Gather my natural *qi*, congeal and transform the Purple Phoenix City.
The lofty terrace soars beyond the Nine Ridges; its layered heights flourish with flying jade.
Resplendent joy rises above the layered void; its winding turns pierce the Eight Clarities.
The Purple Void radiates the cloud palaces; its flowing brilliance veils the Five Numinous.
Four directions stretch into boundless wilds; the Eight *Qi* revolve in circular clarity.
The whirlwind propels the Great Void; the Seven Luminaries turn the celestial scriptures.
They arrive as if rootless; they depart with the ebb of transformation.
Within the Nine Enclosures’ intersecting paths, the Two Images contend in mutual ascent.
The Thearch of Unity secures the Central Origin; the Four Principles do not decline in numinosity.
Southward, it gathers the fruits of the Flying Sovereign; northward, it draws from the Broad Cold Court.
Mysterious chambers converge in true communion; void songs arise naturally.
The Five Thearchs command the numinous banners; their standards summon the myriad spirits.
Demons howl from the empty midst; the Dao governs in joy unending.
Thus, the Winding Plain verses arise to celebrate the divine and delight in great peace.
With whom shall we covenant? Ten thousand kalpas become a single lifespan.
Revolving through ninety thousand kalpas, we roam together in the Purple Phoenix chariot.
The Purple Phoenix Terrace emerges from the void; its jade towers align with the Supreme Subtlety.
The numinous wind pierces the Eight Convergences; the northern window opens the Gate of Heaven.
Above, the singing youths forever chant the cycles of rise and fall.
At dawn, they ride the light in roaming; at dusk, they return with the light.
The Two Luminaries merge as one; they fear losing the radiance of light.
The Nine and Five do not abide forever; heaven and earth face collapse and peril.
The great kalpa ends in a single cedar; the Hundred and Six ride the revolving fate.
Vast springs surge through the Nine Ridges; great birds soar at heaven’s edge.
The myriad creatures drift in endless currents; even the mountains cannot be relied upon.
Wailing and weeping know no bounds—how can one not grieve in one’s heart?
The worthy and sagely diligently recite the scriptures, thus riding the light in flight.
When the time comes, they shall be welcomed together at the gates of the Nine Heavens.
When the golden horse’s hour is exhausted, ten thousand plagues surge in chaotic motion.
One sees no aspiring immortals—only hears the lament of the dead.
Alas, these foolish mortals! How piteous their clinging to life!

**Southern Thearch of the Vermilion**
Dispel sorrow at the Nine Mysteries Terrace; gather joy upon the steps of the Great Void.
In fellowship with the perfected of the Ten Heavens, summon the Lad of the Eastern Sea with a whistle.
The *qi* of the Eight Convergences flows in all directions; the winds of the Towering Terrace intermingle.
Eyes brighten the Western Flower Lodge; the mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Palace.

The purple phoenix descends in graceful dance,
the Nine Peaks stand desolate and still.
My gaze drifts across boundless wilds,
I look up to behold the kalpa’s towering height.
Clear songs harmonize in palace tones,
sorrow and joy follow one another.
Two paths align in perfect accord,
principles seem opposed yet return to unity.
Together we rejoice without end,
holding fast to beginning and end alike.
Sweetly we drink the nectar of Jade Pool,
gazing in joy at the soaring Flower Sovereign.
The numinous gourd may bring contentment,
yet it cannot compare to the radiance of sun and moon.
The Seven Luminaries stream forth fragrant light—
how could such joy ever be forgotten?

Yet the great kalpa has its destined end,
when its course meets the dual forces’ collapse.
The Dragon Gate severs the River of Heaven,
the Three and Five turn against each other.
The Crimson Guardian occupies the Eastern Well,
the Flower Canopy subdues the morning stars.
Dark radiance dims the Eight Wastes,
foul *qi* veils the heavens’ essence.
The Three Offices press upon one another,
the Five Peaks lose their steadfast power.
Ten thousand plagues surge in chaotic motion,
the Northern Thearch marshals his demonic troops.
Eight nets spread beyond the heavens—
even the Sage Lord cannot purify them.
This is the knotting of natural *qi*,
scaling the layered Ninefold City.
From on high I behold the myriad multitudes,
sorrow and joy arise from this.
Mystic songs disperse the heart’s cares,
yet hidden joy turns to weeping.
Alas for these stubborn mortals,
clinging to wealth and ensnared by desire!
Joyfully they await their fate’s arrival,
heedless of calamity that coils around them.
The wise and sagacious turn toward the Dao,
day and night diligently reciting scriptures.
They venerate emptiness and contemplate the Mystery,
to transcend the limits of mortal years.
If one can trace the Dao to its source,
the Eight Festivals shall resound with jade names.
They shall escape the Nine Calamities,
and behold for you the Great Peace.

**Western Thearch of the White**
The jade phoenix stirs the morning gale,
the Purple Terrace gleams in the Jade Grove.
Flowing light brushes the layered mysteries,
its towering form pierces the Nine Yin.
Purple radiance scatters crimson clouds,
flying mists seek one another.
The Seven Treasures adorn jade branches,
spirit beasts gallop through clouded peaks.
Ten thousand immortals ride the void in song,
divine winds carry wondrous tones.
Above dwells the Lofty Dawn Master,
serene and poised in whistle and chant.
The Eight Convergences assume their natural forms,
their descent all of fragrant gold.
Jade is chewed through kalpas’ dawn,
jade nectar scatters into the centered heart.
Bright pearls sing the numinous song,
the Dharma’s countenance harmonizes with the clear zither.
Jade stanzas reveal the Dao’s ultimate lineage,
sorrow and joy unbind the human heart.
They release me from mortal limits—
how profound is this true delight!
Without the high immortal’s resonance,
how could one share in this feast?
At dawn they sport in the Eastern Flower Palace,
at dusk they wander the Western Flower Hall.
They find joy in the Twin Flower Lodges,
yet never meet with worldly pleasures.
Only the strains of the Mystic Singer are heard,
their mournful voices grieving the Heavenly Lad.
Sorrowful echoes flow through the Cold Court,
lamenting the exhaustion of the world’s fate.
The Heavenly Steed leaps across the Nine Rivers,
the Raven Mother rides the flying dragon.
The Dark Ford lacks a bridge,
the dual *qi* remain sundered and unlinked.
Ascend my layered terrace,
look up to witness the Nine Calamities.
Foul *qi* fills the Three Powers,
the myriad multitudes bear the brunt of disaster.
The Eight Domains are left without a single soul,
great and small mountains alike collapse.
Pity those who never sought learning,
hearing the scriptures as if deaf and dumb.
Together they submit to fate’s course,
heedless until their destined end.
Alas, how cruel their appointed time!
Thinking of them, my heart is wounded.

**Northern Thearch of the Black**
The purple phoenix soars into the void,
scaling the layered Ninefold Mystery.
When *qi* coalesces, its shadow appears;
when *qi* scatters, the spirit vanishes.
Drifting and swaying beyond all bounds,
heavenly music delights my heart.
In harmony with the Eight Convergences’ song,
I join the ranks of the lofty immortals.
I summon the perfected of the Ten Heavens,
feasting with the drivers of the Nine Phoenixes.
Above I ascend the Jade Capital’s gates,
below I sport in the Towering Terrace’s realm.
Feathered riders urge on jade wheels,
purple mists support them in the void.
From dawn’s audience to the next morning’s wait,
together we rejoice without end.
My gaze drifts with fate’s unfolding,
a hundred million cedars complete one cycle.
I delight in the heart’s natural ease,
dispersing the world’s sorrows from my breast.
Without the numinous immortal’s essence,
who could share in this journey?
Alas, within the Empty Cavern,
joy gives rise to sorrow once more.
At dawn I ascend the Eastern Meng Peak,
at dusk I observe the Western Mound.
I do not see the Mother of the Nine Spirits—
the Northern Perfected seek the Dao.
Vastly I inquire of the Great Image’s course,
when suddenly the dual *qi* encircle one another.
The Nine Dragons govern the Eastern Well,
the Heavenly Steed emerges from the Western Pass.
The Northern Thearch unleashes his heavenly troops,
the Five Peaks align with the Mystery.
Ten thousand demons are bound in chains,
the Five Agents plot in advance.
War’s disasters spread across the heavens,
the myriad multitudes are already ensnared.
Above and below all receive their reckoning,
swept clean without delay.
Alas for those in the Five Calamities—
when fate arrives, none are spared.
I ascend the Eight Convergences’ palace,
joining my company in the hidden realm.
Surveying those who pursue the ultimate learning,
their blessed lands support them.
Abandoning home to seek my Dao,
they shall surely transcend their mortal forms.
Diligently cultivating the supreme scriptures,
when the Dao is attained, they shall await one another.
Carefree, they observe the Phoenix Terrace—
how could this journey not be joyous?

**Central Thearch of the Yellow**
Great joy gathers at the Middle Origin,
the Middle Origin assembles in the Joyous Court.
Above, the *qi* of the Eight Convergences,
the purple phoenix is born in graceful dance.
Golden branches cling to jade roots,
the Seven Treasures weave into flowered bells.
Dragons soar beyond the utmost peaks,
phoenixes’ cries startle ten thousand miles.
No miscellaneous guests are seen—
only the sounds of wind and clouds.
Palace tones harmonize of themselves,
their resonance naturally complete.
Mystic songs chant wondrous melodies,
sorrow and joy weave into scriptures.
We seek one another of our own accord—
who knows the perfected ones’ numinosity?
Brocade clouds gird the night’s moon,
purple radiance veils flying jade.
The Three Dawns illuminate the Great Brilliance,
the Seven Origins illumine the Five Stars.
Numinous banners bear majestic light,
flowing mists shroud the purple clarity.
I call the Western Flower wondrous,
yet it cannot compare to the Purple Phoenix City.
Above dwell those who loosen their cares,
one glance brings joy for ten thousand years.
Together we rejoice through endless kalpas,
suddenly aware of heaven and earth’s collapse.
The numinous course has its own reckoning,
its end determined by the Mystery’s freedom.
Coming and going follow fate’s turning—
why should sorrow entangle the living?
Dispersing cares beyond the Eight Wastes,
the Great Image does not deviate from truth.
Carefree in the Joyous Court,
who would claim sorrow as kin?
The Five Calamities are constant gatherings,
yet those who suffer are of their own making.
Though palace tones may not harmonize,
the great return finds its own balance.
Thus I compose songs of sorrow and joy,
to guide those who cultivate the Dao.
If one studies the numinous texts,
their wondrous meaning shall naturally shine.
Simply wear the plain jade stanzas,
and you shall enter the Ford of No Sorrow.
Riding the void to ascend the Phoenix Terrace,
gazing from on high to receive the Tang’s years.
What joy could surpass this?
Where lies the space for sorrow?

The *Highest Jade Dawn Songs of Sorrow and Joy* resound upon the Phoenix Terrace in the void, their numinous texts illuminating the Five Directions, their golden tones soaring and radiant through the Ten Heavens. The Perfected Ones of the Ninefold Jade Capital all inscribe golden tablets with purple brushstrokes, joining their voices in unison to chant the mysterious *Songs of Sorrow and Joy*. Their words plumb profound depths, their wondrous essence penetrating the abyss—none but the highest company of immortals can fathom their verses.

There is one named Golden Radiance of the Eastern Flower, whose script is inscribed upon the Phoenix Gate; only thus may one behold these texts. Those who receive and wear the *Phoenix Qi Mystic Mound Perfected Writ* and the *Command Banners of Demon Spirits*, reciting the *Songs of Sorrow and Joy*, shall be guarded by the Five Emperors, protected by the heavenly demons, and sponsored for ascension as Transcendent Ones. They shall be welcomed by the Sacred Lord in the Upper Clarity Palace and wander the halls of the Phoenix Terrace.

For all who receive these texts, on the days of their own fate-star, the Grand Year-Star, the Eight Seasonal Nodes, and the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month, they must bathe, purify themselves, and enter the chamber. First, facing east, they recite the Green Emperor’s song to completion and bow in homage to the Jade Perfected. Turning south, they recite the Red Emperor’s song to completion and bow in homage to the Jade Perfected. Turning west, they recite the White Emperor’s song to completion and bow in homage to the Jade Perfected. Turning north, they recite the Black Emperor’s song to completion and bow in homage to the Jade Perfected. [Turning toward the Grand Year-Star, they recite the Yellow Emperor’s song to completion and bow in homage to the Jade Perfected.] After completing the Five Directions, they return to face north, bowing nine times to the Jade Dawn Lord, then raise their gaze and swallow qi nine times before ceasing.

In this manner, the Five Emperor Banners are displayed in the five directions of the chamber.

**Five Emperor Command Banners of Demon Spirits**

*The Highest Jade Dawn Command Banner of Demon Spirits* governs the Great Demon Spirit King of the Eastern Green Emperor, ensuring the protection of the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of Such-and-Such Year-Stem, that his body may merge with the Perfected and ascend as an immortal. It commands the immortal officials and feathered chariots of the Eastern Peak to welcome his person and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Terrace of the Jade Clarity Palace, as sure as the pledge of the Nine Heavens.
*Inscribed in white upon blue-green silk.*

*The Highest Jade Dawn Command Banner of Demon Spirits* governs the Great Demon Spirit King of the Southern Red Emperor, ensuring the protection of the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of Such-and-Such Year-Stem, that his body may merge with the Perfected and ascend as an immortal. It commands the immortal officials and feathered chariots of the Southern Peak to welcome his person and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Terrace of the Jade Clarity Palace, as sure as the pledge of the Nine Heavens.
*Inscribed in black upon crimson silk.*

*The Highest Jade Dawn Command Banner of Demon Spirits* governs the Great Demon Spirit King of the Western White Emperor, ensuring the protection of the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of Such-and-Such Year-Stem, that his body may merge with the Perfected and ascend as an immortal. It commands the immortal officials and feathered chariots of the Western Peak to welcome his person and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Terrace of the Jade Clarity Palace, as sure as the pledge of the Nine Heavens.
*Inscribed in vermilion upon white silk.*

*The Highest Jade Dawn Command Banner of Demon Spirits* governs the Great Demon Spirit King of the Northern Black Emperor, ensuring the protection of the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of Such-and-Such Year-Stem, that his body may merge with the Perfected and ascend as an immortal. It commands the immortal officials and feathered chariots of the Northern Peak to welcome his person and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Terrace of the Jade Clarity Palace, as sure as the pledge of the Nine Heavens.
*Inscribed in yellow upon black silk.*

*The Highest Jade Dawn Command Banner of Demon Spirits* governs the Great Demon Spirit King of the Central Yellow Emperor, ensuring the protection of the Master of Such-and-Such Peak, Wang of Such-and-Such Year-Stem, that his body may merge with the Perfected and ascend as an immortal. It commands the immortal officials and feathered chariots of the Central Peak to welcome his person and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Terrace of the Jade Clarity Palace, as sure as the pledge of the Nine Heavens.
*Inscribed in blue-green upon yellow silk.*

The above are the *Highest Five Emperor Command Banners of Demon Spirits*, which emerge from the void upon the Phoenix Terrace and are presided over by the Jade Perfected Ones of the Five Emperors. For those whose destiny aligns with the Perfected and immortality, the Eastern Flower shall present these texts to the Five Emperor Demon Kings for their protection and sponsorship. Following the protocols of command, the Five Peaks shall dispatch immortal officials with thousands of chariots and tens of thousands of riders in feathered wheels to welcome them and ascend to the Purple Phoenix Jade Terrace.

Those who wear these texts shall have their names recorded by the Five Emperors, be revered and protected by heavenly demons, welcomed by the administrators of the Ten Realms, and within nine years, receive the descent of the numinous and ascend upon feathered wheels. Men who receive them shall present the texts at lofty peaks, while women shall offer libations to transmit the numinous writ. After ten years, men shall again present the texts, and women shall again offer libations to the *Phoenix Qi Mystic Mound Perfected Writ*, following the same ritual protocols.

**The Jade Stanza Secrets of the Left Perfected of the Great Ultimate**
*Also named the* Mystic Mound Perfected Writ of the Phoenix Qi of the Nine Heavens

The Most High transmitted this to the Left Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who passed it to the Great Lord of the Azure Lad of the Square Pond Palace in the Eastern Sea, to be further transmitted to Daoist adepts whose names are inscribed in jade and who are destined to become Perfected Immortals. Those who wear it for twenty years shall behold the Lords of the Three Origins and be welcomed by the Sacred Lord in the Golden Gates of the Upper Clarity. After seven hundred years, it may be transmitted thrice, and only once every hundred years may it be bestowed upon two recipients.

Three days of purification are required, during which ten pounds of incense are burned and one hundred taels of gold are offered. Upon completion of the transmission, the recipient swears a golden-blue oath in place of the blood-altar covenant.

**Jade Stanza Secrets**
The *Mystic Mound Perfected Writ* contains hidden texts that summon the host of spirits and command the myriad essences.
*Inscribed in vermilion upon white silk and worn upon the body.*

Forty feet of white silk serve as the contract for blood and fluid, replacing the blood-oath of the jade stanzas. Without purity, purification, or the proper untying of the registers, the transmission is invalid.
Twelve feet of blue-green silk serve as the contract for immortality, embodying the oath of transmission once every seven hundred years. It must be worn when entering illness, fire, water, mountains, or chambers while bearing the registers.
Three pairs of golden rings serve as the contract for great transcendence and eternal life, embodying the covenant of unyielding resolve. Without this text, a Daoist cannot behold the Lords of the Three Origins.
Nine taels of incense serve as the contract for communion with the numinous, forming the alliance of luminous spirits. Without it, one cannot summon or command the ghosts of the Six Heavens.

Men receive it facing north, with the master facing south.
Women receive it facing south, with the master facing north.

Men undergo the reception for ten years, then perform one purification rite and submit the writ. Women, upon submitting the writ and performing the jiao offering, must summon the master’s oral transmission. During the reception, a jiao offering is held once every ten years. The register incense and fruits are arranged in a secluded chamber, invoking the Most High Transcendent Perfected of Scenic Clouds, the Celestial Venerable, and the official [name] to uphold the precepts. As the transmitting master’s name is recited in the register, no written text is used; instead, the master’s name is sworn upon the blue-green register and incense. The Most High Transcendent Perfected of Scenic Clouds opens the Great Register of Heaven, while the Celestial Venerable bestows it upon the Lords of the Five Peaks. Wearing it averts misfortune, dispels calamity, repels evil, expels malevolence, summons the host of spirits, commands the hundred birds, orders ghosts and spirits, extends life by a hundred thousand years, restores the soul, reverses aging, secures the body, and ensures eternal existence. It is also called the "Life-Guaranteeing Contract of the Three Heavens."

The Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Mound of Ninefold Heavenly Phoenix Qi, the Ninefold Qi Celestial Venerable, leads ten White-Silk Jade Maidens, who are arrayed within the recipient’s body. The Perfected Writ of the Mysterious Mound of Ninefold Heavenly Phoenix Qi, the Command Banner of Numinous Spirits, is inscribed in continuous script on nine feet of white silk and bestowed to be worn on the body. If one severs ties with worldly residence, the banner is inscribed on five-colored silks corresponding to the five directions. The Command Banner of Numinous Spirits is placed in the five directions to subdue the myriad spirits, govern celestial demons, summon immortal officials, and welcome the Sagely Lord of Great Peace.

According to the immortal statutes of the Celestial Venerable of the Mysterious Capital, after three days of purification upon reception and wearing, the pact is sealed with blue-green silk, three pairs of rings, incense, and silk. The transmission is recorded with the year, month, and day under the cyclical signs, swearing to uphold the Daoist laws: no licentiousness, no negligence, no excess, no deceit, no malice, no envy; practicing benevolence, accumulating virtue, preserving the spirit, and commanding the Perfected. Those who wear the register become immortals. After donning the register, this concludes the rite.

At the initial reception of this text, men submit the writ at their natal peak, notifying the spirits and transmitting the text. After ten years, the submission is repeated as before; three submissions are made in total. For women, the process is the same: one jiao offering after ten years, with three jiao offerings completed in total.

In the first year of the Yangshuo era, the cyclical year gengyin, on the first day of the ninth month, jiachen, the Perfected of the Western Peak, Master Wang, aged forty-two, born in the seventh month, now receives from the Great Master of the Lofty Dawn, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, the Winding Silk Phoenix Writ and the Mysterious Mound Perfected Writ of the Five Phases’ Upper Talismans of Sorrow and Joy. Respectfully invoking the Five Thearchs, Five Perfected, Five Immortals, Five Peaks, and Five Numinous Spirits, he submits the writ to form his own covenant and attain Perfected-hood, submitting his name to the Eastern Florescence to be recorded as a Celestial Immortal. May he eternally preserve primordial auspiciousness, in accordance with the writ of the Nine Heavens.

Five silver tablets are inscribed in red and placed upon five altars. After the master faces north and completes the invocation to the spirits, the tablets are buried at the Five Peaks. If only one peak is used, they may be buried according to its respective direction.

The master arranges five altars, faces north, and strikes his teeth thirty-six times in succession, then intones the prayer:

"To the Nine Mysteries’ Supreme Numen, the Primordial Heavenly Thearch of the Origin; the Jade Immortals of the Five Thearchs; and the Perfected of the Great Palaces of the Numinous Peaks—Wang Jia has undergone the Three Refinements and Nine Trials, his qi and bones now in accord with the Perfected. Reverently following the supremely auspicious covenant-writ of the Nine Heavens, he submits his writ to declare his destiny, burying the tablets upon the numinous mountains. Henceforth, in accordance with the writ’s curves and inflections, he petitions the Demon Kings below to safeguard and advance his Perfected-hood, that he may ascend as a Flying Immortal beneath the feathered canopy, mounting to the Purple Phoenix Palace of Jade Clarity. Should any fail to comply thrice over, in accordance with the statutes of the Great Perfected, their transgression shall be reported for due enforcement."

For female recipients, the rite is performed once every ten years.

For the first libation and transmission of the writ, it shall take place within a secluded chamber. A single altar is set, facing north, with incense burned and five trays of sweet fruits placed before the altar. The Winding Silk Writ is copied and wrapped in a gossamer silk cloth, then set upon a separate table. The master faces north, the disciple south; the master strikes his teeth thirty-six times and softly intones:

"To the Lofty Immortal of Scenic Clouds of Grand Clarity and the Celestial Register’s Supreme Elder of the Enduring Heaven—here stands the male Perfected Wang Jia, aged [X] years, born in the [X] month, who reverently receives the Winding Silk’s verses of sorrow and joy, the Five Thearchs’ Mandate-Demon Spirit Banners, the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Writ of the Mysterious Mound Perfected, and the Five Phases’ Secret Talismans. On this supremely auspicious day, he invokes the qi of the Lofty Morn to descend and illumine his person, beseeching the Five Thearchs, Five Perfected, Five Peaks, and Five Numinous Spirits to inscribe his jade name and submit it to the Five Demon Kings of the Azure Palace, that they may safeguard and advance his Perfected-hood, swiftly attaining immortality to soar through the Grand Clarity and pay homage to the Morn Thearch."

After three libations, the proceedings shall follow the Mysterious Statutes of the Nine Heavens and the Illuminated Writs of the Grand Perfected. The rite is thus performed thrice in full, after which the libations cease.

**The Supreme Winding Silk and Five Phases’ Secret Talismans**
*Composed by the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate*

The Most High addresses the Golden Portal Thearch of Later Saints, saying: When primordial qi divided and judgment was rendered, Heaven and Earth unfolded; yin and yang assumed their positions, the Three and Five took their palaces, the Six Jia were mystically arrayed, and the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—were transformed and born. They govern the Middle Prime, mutually engendering through qi, blending and coalescing into Perfection.

Later students seeking immortality who do not know the source of the Dao labor in vain with meditative visualization, exhausting body and spirit. Their accumulated efforts yield no resonance, and their hope for the Dao fades into obscurity. To seek the origin, one must return to the root; to seek life while losing the root is to attain nothing whole.

Thus, I have excerpted and compiled the Jade Writs of the Supreme August, revealing them to you so that you may select the worthy for transmission. These dharma treasures are arcane and not to be spoken lightly; follow the Illuminated Statutes and receive them with reverence.

The Most High says: The secret writs of the Five Phases came into being with Heaven and Earth, blending and transforming the myriad Perfected and governing the numinous spirits. Without the Five Phases, Heaven’s Three Luminaries would not shine; without the Five Phases, Earth’s mountains and peaks would crumble and collapse; without the Five Phases, the human body would decay and perish. Thus, the Five Phases blend and coalesce, mutually sustaining their generation.

If one is sincere of heart, one must seek the true names. Having received this method, Heaven and Earth share a common root. Summon the hun-soul and call forth the po-soul to safeguard life and command the spirits. Cultivate this for nine years, and you will ascend to transcendence as an Upper Immortal.

To receive the Winding Silk oral instructions and study the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, one must know the inner taboo names of the Five Phases’ Father and Mother True Lords. Visualize them to summon the hun-soul and restrain the po-soul. When hun and po endure, the true spirits all return to their palaces, guarding the bodily form, enabling a return to the natural state. Thus, on the appointed day, you may wander in leisure through the Jade Clarity and merge with qi into Perfection.

For all who cultivate this Dao: On *jia*-*yi* days, enter the chamber, burn incense, and face east to visualize the two true spirits of *jia*-Father and *yi*-Mother. The Father’s taboo name is Qing Ying; he wears the Nine Primordials Azure Jade Mystic Crown, a robe of kingfisher-feather patterns, and holds the Azure Essence Life-Safeguarding Secret Talisman. The Mother’s taboo name is Hao Xian; her hair is coiled in a cascading cloud chignon, she wears a flying azure brocade skirt, and holds the Elixir Radiance Spirit-Transforming Talisman. The two present their talismans to my body. Then, knock the teeth nine times and recite the prayer:

*"True Lord Father and Mother, transform and engender the Two Numinous Ones. The Three and Five return to Perfection, merging with the Primordial in darkness. Externally, gather the wandering hun-soul; internally, secure the essence of the po-soul. Abide long in the palace, never departing from the original form. Forever with the Three Primes, together safeguard the Jade Clarity."*

When finished, ingest the talisman, knock the teeth nine more times, and swallow saliva three times to conclude.

Cultivate this for nine years, and you will perceive the boundless with penetrating vision, discerning distant texts and foreknowing fortune and misfortune.

**Azure Essence Life-Safeguarding Secret Talisman**: Written in azure on white paper. Men ingest the Life-Safeguarding Talisman first, then the Elixir Radiance Spirit-Transforming Talisman.

**Elixir Radiance Spirit-Transforming Talisman**: Written in vermilion on white paper. Women ingest the Elixir Radiance Talisman first, then the Azure Essence Life-Safeguarding Talisman.

**Yin-Yang Secret Talismans of *Jia-Yi* Two Perfected**: The upper talisman written in azure, the lower in vermilion. Regularly on *jia-yi* days, face east to ingest them, and inscribe them on silk to wear on the body.

The Later Saintly Lord of the Golden Watchtower received from the Most High the **Winding Plain Oral Instructions of the Five Phases’ Secret Writings and Precious Formulas**, whereupon the Most High commanded the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate to cast gold into tablets, inscribe the text with purple brush, and conceal it within the Jade Chamber of the Great Possession Palace above the Nine Heavens. The Most High appointed three hundred Western Flower Jade Maidens to guard the sacred writ, their banners adorned with the splendor of the Seven Treasures, streaming the essence of the Five Colors. Golden Perfected and Mystic Radiance intermingle, scattering incense in the Purple Court. Flying auroras billow and swirl, the Eight Assemblies arise in unison, illuminating the Jade Palace with brilliance, resplendent in Jade Purity. Yin and yang, though obstructed, remain unharmed; treading through a hundred kalpas, they ever flourish. They govern the host of wonders, wield authority over the multitude of spirits, summon hun and call po, restoring all gods to wholeness. Their transformations reach the subtlest essence, their wonders embody the Five Phases’ true mystery.

This sacred writ is profoundly secret and must not be lightly disclosed. It is transmitted only to the worthy. Should a devoted student seek to wear the Five Phases’ secret talismans alone, permission may be granted through a separate covenant. The master and disciple observe a seven-day fast, and the disciple presents fifty feet each of the Five Colors’ silks and five pairs of gold buttons to swear an oath before the Jade Emperor’s Palace. The master then conveys the **Oath of Transmission and Salvation Text**. After receiving the teachings, one must not recklessly enter defiled places or offend the Perfected of the Dao. To lightly disclose celestial writ, allowing others to see or hear it, will cause the Seven Mystic Parents to seal one in the earthly prisons forever. One’s own body will suffer the Ten Torments and Eight Calamities, and ascension to immortality will be utterly impossible. Guard this well and practice accordingly.
