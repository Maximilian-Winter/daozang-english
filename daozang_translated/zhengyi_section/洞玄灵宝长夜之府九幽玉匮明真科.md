At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning dwelled in the Fragrant Grove Garden, accompanied by seven thousand two hundred and forty youths. There, he expounded the teachings of transformation, bestowing upon them the majesty of bodily transcendence.

Then, the Celestial Worthy emitted a radiance of five colors, which pierced through the celestial halls of perpetual joy and the hells of the ten directions’ boundless worlds. The youths, gathered in one place, beheld the men and women of virtue in the celestial halls of bliss—carefree and unburdened, their clothing and sustenance arising naturally. Yet they also witnessed the boundless worlds’ hells, where condemned souls toiled in penal servitude: hungry ghosts and deceased spirits, naked and unclothed, their heads and feet shackled in iron, standing upon mountains of blades, bearing iron staves upon their backs. Great and small dragged one another, their five viscera rotting away until no human form remained. When hungry, they ate embers; when thirsty, they drank fiery essence. They were dragged and cast into the Three Paths and Eight Difficulties.

Thereupon, the youth of superior wisdom prostrated himself, eyes closed and face to the earth, kowtowing to address the Celestial Worthy: “Today, while attending your seat, we have witnessed the roots of good and evil fates within the heavens and hells. Our hearts tremble with dread, our five spirits grieve in terror. Daring to rely upon your boundless compassion, we humbly inquire: Would that the Celestial Worthy enlighten our benighted minds, directly bestow your stern instruction, and expound the mysterious teachings, that all may attain clarity. For those of future generations who fail to behold these statutes and precepts, they shall tread into the Five Defilements’ cauldrons of poison. They will encounter calamity and harm, unable to transcend their forms. Whether man or woman, all shall become like the hell-bound convicts, hungry ghosts, and penal spirits we now see—enduring eons of suffering in the mire, never to return. Ignorant and made to answer for their deeds, how pitiful and sorrowful! May these luminous statutes and precepts of the authentic reality be established as the karmic conditions for goodness in the world to come, that all may generation after generation receive this great fortune, escape the roots of suffering, transcend the Three Paths, and ascend to the celestial halls.”

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning replied: “Excellent, excellent! Your question is of profound importance. The *Luminous Statutes of Authentic Reality* within the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository* fully expound the karmic causes of sin and fortune, the retributions of good and evil, the liberation from the roots of suffering, and the precepts for cultivating conduct. Through these, the body enters radiance, evil is shunned, and goodness pursued, ultimately returning to the gate of fortune. This Dharma is vast and universal, broadly delivering gods and humans. Those in the cycle of birth and death receive its grace, escape the Eight Difficulties, transcend the Three Realms, and partake of natural blessings. Generation after generation, they shall rejoice, enjoying endless felicity. I now impart this to you—guard it in secret.”

The youth of superior wisdom advanced, bowed, and knelt in reverence, addressing the Celestial Worthy: “We humbly inquire: By what karmic causes do we now universally behold the celestial halls of bliss and the hells of the boundless worlds, where the retributions of good and evil arise? From whence do they come?

What cultivation in life leads to flight and transcendence, carefree wandering in the Upper Clarity, and ascension to the ranks of the lofty immortals?

What karmic cause in life allows the body to attain liberation through simulated death, extinguishing all action?

What karmic cause in life leads to ceaseless rebirth after death?

What karmic cause in life results in death and subsequent appointment as an official of the celestial bureaus, the body suffused with radiance?

What karmic cause in life leads to rebirth among the various heavens, becoming a guest of the Most High?

What karmic cause in life results in death without confinement, freely associating with the Five Emperors?

What karmic cause in life leads to posthumous investiture as a numinous spirit of the earth?

What karmic cause in life results in death and ascension as one of the host of sages, driving a chariot through the clouds?

What karmic cause in life leads to posthumous ascent to the halls of fortune, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally?

What karmic cause in life results in death and rebirth in the Southern Palace, returning to the realm of humans?

What karmic cause in life leads to descent into hell after death, enduring eternal night?

What karmic cause in life results in death and the infliction of torment, myriad pains afflicting the body?

What karmic cause in life leads to death without sustenance, dwelling among hungry ghosts?

What karmic cause in life results in death and separation, the body shattered and form destroyed?

What karmic cause in life leads to death as a convict, dragged and cast into the Three Bureaus?

What karmic cause in life results in death and immersion in boiling cauldrons, never to regain human form?

What karmic cause in life leads to death and wandering among the forests of swords, wind and blades assailing one another?

What karmic cause in life results in death with the head scorched and charred, bearing a mountain of fire upon it?

What karmic cause in life leads to death without clothing, an iron staff borne upon the back?

What karmic cause in life results in death with the body shorn and mutilated, bearing stones without respite?

What karmic cause in life leads to death in shackles and fetters, imprisoned in darkness, the Three Luminaries obscured?

What karmic cause in life results in ceaseless toil, food and rest forever denied?

What karmic cause in life leads to death with the tongue torn out, pierced by iron awls?

What karmic cause in life results in death drawing the dark waves to irrigate the Four Rivers?

Now, beholding such beings in hell, what transgressions in life have they committed to endure such retribution? Their souls suffer torment to this degree—how many years must pass before they attain liberation? On the day of their release, shall they be reborn as beasts of burden, or return to the realm of humans? We beseech you to distinguish and expound upon the roots of fate, to reveal the karmic causes for rebirth, and to establish the conditions for goodness in the world to come. If we are graced with your enlightenment, we shall receive the sagely benevolence.”

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy commanded the flying divine beings of the ten directions to open the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository* and bring forth the *Luminous Statutes of Authentic Reality*, that the youths might be delivered.

At that moment, the great sages of the various heavens, the honored deities of the primordial limit, the divine immortals and jade maidens—an innumerable host beyond reckoning—all simultaneously approached the seat.

Heaven scattered fragrant blossoms, divine dragons performed with music, soaring songs resounded in all directions, jade-like melodies flowed and drifted. The sky was bright, the qi clear, all haze and obscurity dissolved. The Sun Lad poured forth essence, the Moon Maiden scattered flowers, radiant light converged from all sides, illuminating the various heavens. A hundred harmonies cleansed defilement, divine winds swept away dust. Rivers and seas lay hidden in stillness, mountains and peaks swallowed the mist. Dragon scales leapt and danced, divine beings and humans rejoiced universally. The gates of life and death opened to prosperity, blessings and felicity spread universally. The Five Sufferings were released, the Nine Dark Realms pardoned souls. Long-bound prisoners were freed, ascending to the heavens. Men and women rejoiced, everlasting joy abounded, the various heavens celebrated, prostrating to hear the decisive words.

From the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository*, the *Luminous Statutes of Authentic Reality* declared:

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, devote yourself to learning, forsake sensual desire, and sever emotional attachments. Maintain a perpetual fast, uphold the precepts, recite scriptures day and night without weariness, and cultivate the Dao at all times. Harmonize the Six Conducts, soften the heart, and darken the intent. Your thoughts dwell in the Dharma, and though you cycle through life and death, your vow remains unbroken. Through lifetimes of karmic conditions, your name is inscribed in the Golden Registers, listed among the Nine Heavens. Thus, you shall attain the ability to ride the void, soaring in broad daylight, driving the radiant chariot and spurring the dragon to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, devote yourself to learning and practicing the scriptural teachings. Ingest essence and swallow qi without weariness or rest. Maintain a fast, regulate your diet, refine yourself through breath, accumulate merit, and spread virtue. Your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity Heaven. Thus, you shall attain liberation through simulated death as a lower immortal, roaming the Five Peaks. In a later life among humans, you shall again receive the scriptural teachings, become a master of the lineage, perfect the turning of the Dao’s wheel, and attain the rank of upper immortal, soaring in broad daylight to join the exalted perfected.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, refine the authentic and ingest divine elixirs. The Five Minerals stabilize life, and the divine treasures of the Five Palaces are secured. Though your merit is modest and your virtue slight, your destiny has yet to ascend to heaven. When your body undergoes extinction, your bones shall remain fragrant and flourishing, imperishable for countless kalpas. In an instant, you shall regain form and be reborn among humans. Endowed with wisdom and keen insight, you shall foresee fortune and misfortune, your destiny unimpeded, your vision penetrating. You shall command ghosts and spirits, cycling without cessation, and attain the scriptures to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, devote yourself to the Dharma, subdue ghosts, and heal the sick. Assist the celestial rectifying qi, act with diligence and care, and never violate the statutes and precepts. Your deeds accord with the Dharma, and your merit and virtue towering. Praised by the earth deities, your name ascends to the various heavens. At death, you shall rise to the Southern Palace, receiving the title of Supreme Attendant to the Celestial Offices, governing all ghosts and spirits. In a later life, you shall be reborn as a human patriarch, teaching and transforming the world, penetrating the natural, and cycling without end. Your rank shall reach that of divine immortal.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, cultivate goodness and revere the divine. Make offerings to the Three Treasures, pay homage to and receive the teachings of your masters and lineage. At death, you shall ascend to heaven as a guest of the Most High. In a later life among humans, you shall be honored as a human patriarch, respected by the Three Realms, and praised by ghosts and spirits. Your household shall be pure and noble, delighting gods and humans. From this, you shall study and receive the great scriptures, maintain fasts, uphold the precepts, and broadly perceive the fields of merit. When your merit is complete and your virtue sufficient, you shall attain the rank of divine immortal.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, devote yourself to the Dao, journeying to renowned mountains. On the eight seasonal nodes and your natal day, pay homage to and invoke the divine. Burn incense and make vows with unwavering devotion. Relieve the destitute, rescue the distressed, and deliver sentient beings. Reverently honor your masters and the Three Treasures, moving the various heavens to respond. Recommended by the Five Emperors, your name is proclaimed in the Azure Palace. At death, you shall directly ascend to the Five Peaks, unbound by confinement, and consort with the Five Emperors. In a later life among humans, you shall receive the great scriptures, guarded by divine beings, your might subduing the Five Directions. None shall fail to submit, and all shall follow your will. Divine elixirs and jade mushrooms shall abound without seeking, your body shall command water and fire, transforming in myriad ways. With unbroken karmic conditions, you shall receive the title of Perfected of the Five Emperors.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, be courageous and resolute, pacifying the Four Directions. Assist the rectifying qi of the times, executing the treacherous and malevolent. Keep your heart pure and your body clean, your conduct aligning with the divine. After death, your soul shall ascend to receive the scriptures in the Southern Palace, becoming a Luminous Duke of the Four Poles or a spirit of blessed radiance. In a later life among humans, you shall possess penetrating insight, attaining the natural effortlessly. Revered by the Three Offices and honored by gods and humans, you shall rescue those in distress and perform great deeds. With unbroken karmic conditions, you shall attain the Dao of Non-Action and Perfection.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, be reverent and faithful, practicing the Ten Superior Precepts of Wisdom. Accumulate all good deeds, make offerings to Dharma masters, burn incense, and light lamps to assist the celestial illumination, shining upon the Ten Directions. Bestow kindness upon the virtuous, and vow to deliver sentient beings. At death, you shall ascend to the Eastern Florescence, receiving the title of Flying Immortal, your rank equal to the Ten Transformed Disciples of the Most High. You shall drive the chariots of the assembled sages, roaming the clouds. In a later life, you shall be born into the household of a noble lord or king, enjoying joy through the generations, ever encountering enlightened masters. You shall study and receive the scriptural teachings, establishing great merit. Revered by the various heavens, honored by the divine, and looked up to by gods and humans, you shall attain the natural effortlessly. Your blessings and felicity shall be towering, unmatched. When your merit is complete and your virtue perfected, you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

**The Luminous Statutes state:** In this life, delight in and honor the supreme scriptures, making offerings to the Three Treasures and broadly opening the Dharma gates. Donate wealth and distribute alms to the poor. Provide your masters with Dharma robes, establish halls of practice, and keep lamps burning through the night. Within the Nine Dark Realms, the world shall witness your radiance. At death, you shall ascend to the heavenly halls, carefree and joyful, your clothing and food naturally provided. In a later life, you shall be born into the household of a wealthy and noble king, blessed through the generations with good karmic conditions. Again, in your noble and prosperous state, you shall make exceptional offerings, maintain fasts, uphold the precepts, and deliver sentient beings. Praised by the earthly administrators, your name shall ascend to the various heavens. When your merit is complete and your virtue sufficient, your body shall emanate light, a circular image appearing above your neck. You shall soar in broad daylight, ascending to the Mysterious Capital to become a Perfected King of Immortals.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: Those born into the world who serve their masters, make offerings to the Daoist scriptures, maintain long fasts and uphold the precepts, never violating the celestial statutes, burn incense and light lamps to illuminate the various heavens, their radiance penetrating the Nine Dark Realms, bringing light to the long night—such that their seven generations of ancestors rejoice in peace, free from sorrow and suffering. Those who perform good deeds, extensively cultivate fields of merit, broadly deliver all beings, and bestow kindness upon the multitude—when their immortal destiny is not yet complete and their dharma-bound fate requires further dissolution—shall ascend at death to the Southern Palace and immediately be reborn. Returning to a noble household, within the palace of an emperor, they shall live at ease and unhurried. There, they shall renew their vows with exceptional sincerity and diligence, their resolve unwavering, their merit ever-renewing. Praised by the Three Realms, their names shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. When their destined dissolution is fulfilled, they shall attain flight, ascending to the Great Ultimate to assume the rank of Immortal Duke.

The Flying Heavenly Divine Persons declare: The *Luminous Perfection Regulations of the Nine Dark Realms’ Jade Casket* records the ten good karmic conditions and the merits accrued through virtuous conduct. Their names shall be inscribed in the golden tablets and jade characters of the divine immortals among the heavens. Before their destined ascension is complete, they shall undergo cyclic rebirth, ascending at death to the heavenly halls where clothing and food arise naturally, carefree and without striving, their blessings and joys beyond measure. Reborn into wealth and nobility, within the household of an emperor, they shall enjoy happiness through the generations, bound in karmic affinity with the Dao. Building upon this foundation, they shall diligently cultivate the great dharma, broadly establish good deeds, their devotion unwavering, their aspirations ever-renewing. Praised by the Three Realms, they shall attain the rank of divine immortals. Yet if, amid their blessings, they fail to remain diligent, indulging in laxity and regression, they shall reenter the gates of evil, committing violent and treacherous acts, their deeds disloyal, violating the laws and sinking into the roots of wickedness. Once the ladder of goodness is lost, there shall be no return. Let all future worthies reflect deeply upon these words.

Thereupon, seventy-two hundred and forty divine youths of the various heavens simultaneously voiced their approval. When the Flying Heavenly Divine Persons finished expounding the karmic retributions of the ten good conditions, the divine youths rejoiced and paid homage. Then the Flying Heavenly Divine Persons offered this hymn:

Diligent in fasting and precepts,
Reciting scriptures to restrain the six senses—
They attain flight through empty space,
Their radiance ascending to Jade Clarity.

With sincere heart they uphold the scriptural teachings,
Refining the five spirits through breath and absorption.
Their merit crowns the heavens,
Through cyclic rebirth they become superior immortals.

Through ascetic practice they cultivate the Dao of life,
Ingesting medicines and refining the essence of mushrooms.
When dissolution comes, their form does not perish,
Their bones exude natural fragrance.

Through rigorous discipline they master the methods of spirits,
Driving and striving to demonstrate their merit.
When dissolution comes, they fill the offices of the capital,
Later reborn as human patriarchs.

Receiving the Dao and revering the divine,
Making offerings to the Three Treasures in truth—
In life they are honored among men,
At dissolution they become guests of the Most High.

On the eight seasonal nodes they wander sacred mountains,
Vowing to deliver sentient beings.
They ascend to become companions of the Five Emperors,
In later lives endowed with majesty.

With courage and impartiality they calm their minds,
Turning away from evil and extinguishing treachery.
Feared and revered by the Three Officials,
They become patriarchs of heaven and men.

Reverently upholding the Ten Precepts,
Burning incense and keeping lamps ever-bright—
Their merit equals tenfold repayment,
Attaining the rank of flying immortals.

Making offerings to the Three Treasures and scriptures,
Dispersing alms to establish diligent merit—
At dissolution they ascend to the heavenly halls,
Later reborn into the household of a king.

Serving their masters beyond even the divine,
Joyfully facing the true scriptures—
Born into noble households,
At dissolution they enter the courts of the Three Realms.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life perform no good deeds, their actions rooted in evil, assaulting their masters and slandering the virtuous, committing murder without principle, showing no regard for sentient beings, practicing cruelty and oppression, harboring treacherous schemes, envying those superior to themselves, suppressing and silencing the worthy and enlightened—upon death, they shall face retribution, their sinful souls bound and confined, descending directly into hell. In the long night, they shall endure every torment, their suffering unbearable. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but only to the paths of non-human beings, forever barred from the gates of blessing, eternally mired in the roads of sin, endlessly cycling without deliverance, for a hundred million kalpas without hope of return.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life set their minds and intentions upon evil as their constant practice, inflicting boundless cruelty, deceiving and harming the loyal and good, destroying virtue and fostering wickedness, slandering and attacking the worthy—upon death, they shall face retribution, their bodies transformed into those of ox-headed jailers. Day and night they shall be tortured, their suffering beyond words. Their bodies shall fester and rot, no longer retaining human form. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but only to the lands of frontier barbarians, possessing human form but lacking human nature, forever barred from the human path, eternally mired in the gates of sin, drifting through the five sufferings and eight adversities, without deliverance, for a hundred million kalpas without hope of return.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life are miserly and greedy, seeking only to benefit themselves, never considering others, seizing from the four classes, incurring the resentment of gods and men, insatiably devouring, enriching only themselves—upon death, they shall face retribution, becoming hungry ghosts and beasts, swallowing fire and eating coals, never satisfied. Their bodies shall char and fester, no longer retaining human form, drifting through the roads of ash and embers, their suffering beyond words. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return, but only into the bodies of the six domestic animals, forever barred from the human path, eternally trapped in alien forms, without deliverance, their hope of return exceedingly remote.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women of wealth and nobility who in life oppress and bully the poor and lowly, seize what others love, separate others from their kindred, dividing flesh and bone to dwell in distant places—if they commit incest with their six relations, such sins are profoundly grave. Upon death, they shall face dismemberment, their bodies torn apart, heads severed from torsos, their souls shorn and bound in chains and fetters. They shall be dragged back and forth over beds of iron needles, unable to eat or rest, thrice daily tortured before being reborn into the bodies of oxen and horses to repay their karmic debts. Forever barred from the human path, eternally mired in the roots of sin, without deliverance, for a hundred million kalpas trapped in alien forms.

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life commit evil and treachery, cursing the virtuous, invoking gods and ghosts, swearing oaths before the Three Officials, killing living beings in licentious sacrifices, praying to and worshipping demonic spirits, engaging in lewd dances and sorcery, calling themselves "aunt" or "uncle," greedily devouring the common folk, wantonly committing senseless acts—when their crimes accumulate and their sins are fixed, upon death they shall face retribution, their souls imprisoned as convicts, drifting through the Three Officials and the Five Peaks. Thrice daily they shall be tortured, their suffering beyond words. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as lowly persons, or afflicted by the six adversities, lacking human form, sunk deep in sin. Their hope of return is dark and distant, without deliverance, forever barred from the path of blessing.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life commit crimes—hands that slay rulers and fathers, plots to betray masters and teachers, murderous harm to human lives, bullying the weak with brute strength, assaulting the virtuous, cruelty in official posts, wanton suffering inflicted without cause, false accusations and grievances cried out—shall see their vengeful karma stretch to the heavens. Some expose the Three Luminaries to nakedness, defile and insult the Northern Lord, show no reverence for Heaven and Earth, no fear of gods and spirits, destroy scriptures and teachings, and defile the celestial perfected. Upon death, they shall face retribution, their bodies cast into cauldrons of boiling broth, their five limbs stewed and dissolved until no human form remains. A hundred poisons shall be poured upon them, pain unbearable, suffering beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as beasts of burden, or as lowly persons afflicted with deafness, blindness, and the six infirmities, lacking human form, subject to slaughter at others’ whim, repaying old enmities. The path of blessing grows ever more distant, the roots of sin ever deeper, with no deliverance, forever sunk in inescapable damnation.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act without faith in the Great Law, showing no reverence for the divine, or feign devotion to the Three Treasures while their hearts remain uncommitted, treat scriptures with disdain, and defile sacred texts—some transmit teachings to disciples without regard for the ordained years, or secretly pass on the Way without invoking Heaven and Earth, forging their own doctrines in violation of the Four Illuminations. Some observe fasts and precepts with negligence, doubting and slighting the perfected. Their sins are grave and heavy. Upon death, they shall be shaved and shackled, made to climb sword trees where winds from eight directions blow the branches low and high, their feet slipping onto blade mountains, ascending and descending without end, their bodies torn and wounded, pain unbearable, agony beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as the most foolish of beings, or be afflicted with the six infirmities, deaf and blind, forever barred from the Dao, eternally shut out from the gates of learning. Trapped in the Five Sufferings, sunk deep in the causes of sin, they shall find no deliverance, forever bound to evil roots.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act without compassion or filial piety, lacking benevolence or loyalty, cursing and humiliating parents, turning kin against one another—some boil and slaughter livestock, carving and maiming, cutting short lives through hunting, poisoning and butchering living beings. Their sins are deeply perverse. Upon death, they shall face cruel retribution, forced to swallow fire and eat coals, burned by flames until their heads and faces are scorched, their bodies rotted beyond recognition. They shall bear iron cauldrons on their backs and wear mountains of fire upon their heads, pain beyond endurance, torment beyond bearing. They shall return as beasts of burden, subject to slaughter at others’ hands to repay old enmities, forever losing the human path, eternally mired in the roots of sin, with no deliverance, no hope of return.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life kill living beings in licentious sacrifices, betray the Dao to follow heresy, mock Daoist priests, slander the perfected, show contempt for the Three Treasures, abandon the Law for falsehood, indulge in wanton impiety, deny predestined fate, and forge their own doctrines—some dig up human bones, exposing them in the wild. Their sins are grave and heavy. Upon death, they shall face severe retribution, stripped naked and made to bear iron rods upon their flesh, their five limbs festering with pus, suffering beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as the most foolish of beings, dull and deaf, or afflicted with demonic illnesses, no longer human. The path of blessing shall forever diverge, entwined with sin, with no deliverance, lost for countless kalpas.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act without the Dao—robbing and plundering, committing violent crimes, taking lives with blades and arrows without hesitation, refusing to repay debts, demanding without end—shall bear grave sins. Upon death, they shall face calamitous retribution, their bodies shaved and severed, made to bear mountains and carry stones, laboring without rest day or night, mired in toil and misery beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as oxen or horses, repaying enmities with their strength. Even if reborn as humans, they shall suffer mutilation, imprisonment, and beatings, drifting through the Eight Adversities, longing for death yet denied it, tormented by endless sorrow. They shall find no deliverance, forever trapped in the gates of sin.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act without the Dao, moving under cover of darkness to break into homes, abducting wives and concubines, seizing clothing, plotting wicked schemes, and harming men and women—shall upon death face severe punishment, their heads and feet locked in shackles, imprisoned in darkness where the Three Luminaries are unseen, subjected to torture and pain beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as lowly persons, enslaved and beaten, or deaf and blind, led by others, repaying old enmities. Forever barred from the path of goodness, their evil roots deepening, they shall remain lost for countless kalpas, with no deliverance.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act without the Dao, heedless of good causes, roaming in the three spring months for hunting, flying hawks and unleashing hounds, setting snares and nets, burning mountains with fire, shooting wild beasts, and slaughtering living beings—shall bear cruel and perverse sins. Upon death, they shall be condemned to heavy suffering, made to bear iron rods, a thousand pains assailing them at once, driven to the ends of the earth without rest, their souls tormented by unrelenting agony. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as wild beasts, forever hunted and butchered to repay old enmities. Even if reborn as humans, they shall constantly suffer at the hands of evil men, whipped and tormented for ten thousand kalpas, sorrow and suffering their constant companions. The path of blessing grows ever more distant, the roots of sin ever deeper, with no deliverance, lost in an endless night.

The *Mingzhen Canon* states: In the boundless world, men and women who in life act with malicious tongues and deceitful words, stirring strife within and without, slandering the Dao and the virtuous, disbelieving in scriptures, speaking falsely while harboring evil, plotting in secret, attacking the four classes, and spreading rumors about others—whether men or women—shall incur the vengeful karma of gods and humans, cursing without restraint, uttering vile and filthy words, invoking ghosts and spirits, and hurling mutual curses. Their sins are grave and heavy. Upon death, they shall suffer cruel torment, their tongues torn out and pierced with iron awls, struck without limit by mighty celestial warriors wielding iron rods, their bodies rotted beyond recognition, pain beyond endurance. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return as dogs, forever barking at others, beaten and abused at will. Even if reborn as humans, they shall be born among barbarians, no longer human, the target of all evil, repaying old enmities. Forever barred from the human path, with no hope of return, they shall drift endlessly in the gates of sin, with no deliverance.

The *Luminous Percepts of the True* states: In the boundless world, men and women who live in the world and establish their conduct indulge in wine and lust, losing their nature in distraction, growing reckless and deluded. Their five emotions scatter in chaos, driving away spirit and harming qi. Drunk and greedy for desire, they commit evil unawares, shouting curses and vile words, acting alone without adversary. They strike the good, defile and scorn the Dao and its teachings, slander and destroy scriptures, turn from truth to falsehood, break promises and betray trust, deceive and malign the four assemblies. Their deeds stray from the Dao, and their sins run deep and perverse.

Upon death, they face heavy retribution: their souls endure bitter torment, drawing and pouring the dark waves to flood the Four Rivers. Banished to become rivers and streams, they toil day and night without rest, bound in iron fetters and shackles, dragged and pulled endlessly through the long, dark night, never to be freed. After ten thousand kalpas, they shall be born among thieves—poor, base, and afflicted with loathsome diseases, despised by all, repaying old enmities. The bonds of their karmic causes tighten, their path to fortune grows ever more distant, and their roots of sin take deeper hold. They cannot be delivered, nor find any way out.

The Flying Celestial Divine Person says: The *Luminous Percepts of the Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository* enumerate fourteen categories of karmic retribution. Past deeds accumulate, bearing the weight of perverse and evil adversities. Good binds to good, evil follows evil, each adding to the other in an unbroken cycle. Having lost the human path, they do not even realize it, sinking into the six kinds of beasts. Even if reborn among humans, they shall be utterly foolish, or born among barbarians, or afflicted with the six illnesses, dragged and pulled endlessly for ten thousand kalpas with no escape. Their lives in the world are brief, but their deaths are long and sealed. Once they lose the path of goodness, they forever stray from the realm of the worthy. In the long, dark night, when shall they find deliverance?

Men and women of future generations, take heed and rouse yourselves! Establish great merit to redeem yourselves. Receive the Ten Precepts, and you may avoid this calamity. Remember well these words, and never forget them.

Thereupon, seven thousand two hundred and forty divine youths, the Great Perfected Saints of the heavens, all proclaimed their assent.

The Flying Celestial Divine Person having expounded the fourteen categories of karmic retribution for evil deeds and the unbroken bonds of evil causes, the divine youths rejoiced, paid homage, and then the Flying Celestial Divine Person spoke in verse:

Those who in life harbor no good thoughts,
Cruelly abuse their teachers and treasures,
Shall in death suffer ten thousand agonies,
And for ten thousand kalpas lose the human path.

Those who cruelly flatter the loyal and good,
Slander and strike the worthy,
Shall in life dwell among barbarians,
And in death take the form of oxen and horses.

Those who are miserly and greedy, desiring only gain,
Never thinking to give to living beings,
Shall in death become hungry ghosts,
And later be born as beasts of burden.

Those who in wealth and power oppress the poor and lowly,
Seize and separate others from their kin,
Shall in body suffer the retribution of being torn apart,
And their souls, as ghosts, endure shaving and branding.

Those who curse the innocent,
And in lewd rites dance for evil spirits,
Shall be dragged through the Three Wretched Realms,
And for ten thousand kalpas be born in lowly bodies.

Those who plot treason and abuse their lords and fathers,
Defile and disgrace the Celestial Perfected,
Shall in death be boiled in cauldrons of scalding water,
Their suffering unending, with no return.

Those whose minds are not steadfast and resolute,
Who slight and scorn the Heavenly Treasures of scripture,
Shall after death walk the path of sword trees,
Where wind and blades never cease.

Those who harbor no compassion,
But cruelly harm living beings,
Shall in death bear iron cauldrons,
And for ten thousand kalpas wear mountains of fire.

Those who betray the Dao and turn to evil spirits,
Slander and turn their backs on the Perfected,
Shall in death have no clothes to wear,
And iron rods shall never leave their bodies.

Those who rob and steal others’ wealth,
Cutting and stabbing the people of heaven,
Shall in death suffer shaving and amputation,
And in life be maimed by punishment.

Those who, under cover of darkness, break into homes,
And act wantonly as they please,
Shall in death be forever confined in darkness,
Never to see the light of sun or moon.

Those who accumulate deeds without thought of kindness,
And roam hunting to capture living beings,
Shall have their enmity repaid with iron rods,
Driven and chased without a moment’s rest.

Those of fierce nature who stir up strife with their tongues,
Creating discord among kin and stranger alike,
Shall in death suffer the retribution of having their tongues torn out,
And later be born to bark at others forever.

Those who love wine and lose their original conduct,
Their five spirits all growing reckless,
Shall in death draw the waters of the dark waves,
And pour them to flood the Four Rivers.

Thus the Flying Celestial Divine Person chanted in verse the karmic retribution of good and evil, proclaiming it to the divine youths. At that time, the celestial beings all awakened, clearly seeing the roots of their lives. They reflected on the sources of their past sins, reformed their hearts, and roused themselves to cultivate and uphold the scriptures. Their old debts were dispersed, the Nine Dark Realms were purified, and all were reborn amid good causes.

The divine youths received the Dharma-sound with reverence, rejoiced as one, paid homage, and departed.

The *Upper Grade on Deliverance from Karmic Retribution of Sin and Fortune in the Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms*

The Most High Lord of the Dao stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: Today, while attending in your presence, I have witnessed the divine youths receiving your majestic radiance, which illumines the halls of fortune in all the heavens and the hells of the boundless world, where the retribution of good and evil differs in suffering and joy. The good rejoice in peace, carefree and endless, while the evil wallow in misery, dragged through the Eight Difficulties, their bodies lost forever—how pitiable! Such retribution, bound to evil causes, faces endless kalpas of adversity, never recognizing the roots of their lives. Do they not possess merit to redeem and deliver the dead, to lead them out of the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, to enter the light, and be reborn in the gates of fortune?

If you would show compassion, the living and the dead would bear your grace. The departed would rest in peace, and the living would prosper, flourishing in wealth and honor, their lives long and enduring. Their influence would shade the eight distant lands, and their virtue would sprinkle the forests of orchids. Men and women of future generations would hear the Dharma-sound. I only pray, Heavenly Worthy, that you distinguish and explain, bestowing upon us the decisive words, so that all may see the precepts clearly and find peace.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: Listen well to my words, reflect deeply, and inscribe them in your heart. Day and night, hold them in mind, and never forget. I shall now explain the wondrous sound for you to follow, so that you may redeem sinful souls, open the way out of the long night, the Nine Dark Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. Their old adversities shall be dispersed, and they shall turn to the roots of faith, rejoicing in life and death, their karmic bonds spanning generations.

The method is most exalted and wondrous, transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Only when a worthy and enlightened one appears in the world is it solemnly imparted. Kept secret, blessings descend; revealed, calamities draw near. The warning of the Wind and Blade is declared to the Perfected Illuminati—transgress the precepts and statutes, and blame not the heavens.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Flying Celestial Beings to expound the karmic retribution of sins and blessings, delivering the highest grade of souls. As the scripture was recited, the luminaries of the heavens—sun, moon, and stars—radiated their brilliance, universally illuminating the boundless worlds of the Nine Earths and the long-night abodes of the Nine Dark Realms. The long-bound hungry ghosts, the toiling dead souls, received the light upon their bodies and beheld their life-roots. Thereupon, they awakened, turning their hearts as one, all inclining toward goodness, contemplating the return to the gate of blessings. The Five Sufferings were dissolved, the Three Paths uplifted; karmic adversities were dispersed, and the hells found tranquility.

At that time, men and women universally heard the Dharma-sound. Those who had prepared their minds all attained divine transcendence.

The Flying Celestial Being declared: The *Highest Grade of the Jade Casket for Delivering the Dead from the Nine Dark Realms and Their Karmic Adversities* is to be performed during the six months of the year—namely, the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months. Within each month, on the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days—a total of ten days—as well as on the Eight Seasonal Festivals, the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, one should set a tall lamp, nine feet high, in the central courtyard of the home. Upon this single lamp, kindle nine lamps, each radiating light to illuminate above the Nine Mysteries and the celestial halls of blessings, and below the boundless worlds of the Nine Earths and the long-night abodes.

In accordance with the ritual decorum and prescribed method, invoke and welcome the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Perfected Ones, Flying Immortals, the luminaries of the sun, moon, and stars, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the Five Sacred Peaks and Three Rivers, the armies of the Four Seas—each numbering ninety-nine billion cavalry—as well as the thirty-two celestial overseers of the fast, the attendant incense-bearing Golden Lads, the flower-scattering Jade Maidens, the thirty-two direct messengers of the Five Emperors, and the flying dragon couriers who transmit words and memorials. Let them all descend together to oversee the ritual hall, receive the incense offerings, and bear the vows upward. When the circumambulation and rites are complete, they shall return to their celestial palaces.

By day, burn incense; by night, kindle lamps, ensuring the fragrance never ceases. Display the scripture in the courtyard beneath the nine lamps, circumambulate the lamps, and after offering incense and reciting vows, turn to the east and bow nine times, saying:

*"I, [Name], now take refuge in the Eastern Infinite Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the myriad divine officials of the Eastern Realm. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and kindle lamps, dedicating these merits to illuminate all heavens. May they universally benefit the Emperor, lords of states, officials, common folk, Dharma-receiving masters, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, recluses in the mountains and forests cultivating the true Dao, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, wriggling and creeping, all sentient beings—may they all be delivered from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, the imprisoned and wandering souls of my lineage, be bathed in light, liberated, and turned toward the roots of faith. May they depart the Five Paths, resolve karmic bonds, and find eternal joy in death, while the living receive grace. May the world know great peace, the Dao and virtue flourish. Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao."*

When finished, remove the headscarf, kowtow, and clasp the hands, repeating this eighty-one times. Then, turn to the south and bow three times, saying:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Southern Quadrant’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Divine Officials of the Southern Realm. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps, dedicating these merits to illumine all heavens. May they universally benefit emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, masters who receive the Daoist teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow students and disciples, reclusive scholars in mountains and forests cultivating the true Dao, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, the creeping and wriggling, all breathing beings—may all universally be delivered from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, the imprisoned and wandering souls of my lineage, be bathed in light, liberated, and turned toward the roots of faith. May they depart the Five Paths, resolve karmic bonds, and find eternal joy in death, while the living receive grace. May the world know great peace, the Dao and virtue flourish.

When finished, kowtow and clasp the hands, repeating this twenty-seven times. Then, turn to the west and bow seven times, saying:

Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

When finished, kowtow and clasp the hands, repeating this sixty-three times. Then, turn to the north and bow five times, saying:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Northern Quadrant’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Divine Officials of the Northern Realm. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps, dedicating these merits to illumine all heavens.

Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

When finished, kowtow and clasp the hands, repeating this forty-five times. Then, turn to the northeast and bow once, saying:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Northeastern Quadrant’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Brahman Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Divine Officials of the Northeastern Realm. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps, dedicating these merits to illumine all heavens. May they benefit emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, masters who receive the Daoist teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow students and disciples, reclusive scholars in mountains and forests cultivating the true Dao, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, the creeping and wriggling, all breathing beings—may all universally be delivered from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature.

Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

When finished, kowtow and clasp the hands, repeating this nine times. Then, turn to the southeast and bow once, saying:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Southeastern Quadrant’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Brahman Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Divine Officials of the Southeastern Realm. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps, dedicating these merits to illumine all heavens.

Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

Having completed this, they kowtowed and pressed their cheeks to the ground, each nine times. Then, facing the southwest, they bowed once and said:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, the Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Heavenly Lords of Brahma Qi, and the divine officials of the Southwest. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps. May the merit of this act illuminate the heavens, universally benefiting emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, Daoist masters who transmit the teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, reclusive scholars of the true Dao in mountains and forests, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, the creeping and wriggling, all breathing beings—may all universally be delivered from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, the imprisoned and wandering souls of my lineage, be bathed in light, liberated, and turned toward the roots of faith. May they depart the Five Paths, resolve karmic bonds, and find eternal joy in death, while the living receive grace. May the world know great peace, the Dao and virtue flourish. Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

Having completed this, they kowtowed and pressed their cheeks to the ground, each nine times. Then, facing the northwest, they bowed once and said:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, the Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Heavenly Lords of Brahma Qi, and the divine officials of the Northwest. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps. May the merit of this act illuminate the heavens, universally benefiting emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, Daoist masters who transmit the teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, reclusive scholars of the true Dao in mountains and forests, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, the creeping and wriggling, all breathing beings—may all universally be delivered from the Seven Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, the imprisoned and wandering souls of my lineage, be bathed in light, liberated, and turned toward the roots of faith. May they depart the Five Paths, resolve karmic bonds, and find eternal joy in death, while the living receive grace. May the world know great peace, the Dao and virtue flourish. Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

Having completed this, they kowtowed and pressed their cheeks to the ground, each nine times. Then, facing upward, they bowed thirty-two times and said:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, the Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens of the Jade Capital, Mystic Metropolis, and Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, and the divine officials and immortals. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps. May the merit of this act illuminate the heavens, universally benefiting emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, Daoist masters who transmit the teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, reclusive scholars of the true Dao in mountains and forests, all worthy ones, the crawling and flying, the creeping and wriggling, all breathing beings—may all universally be delivered from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell eternally in non-action, and attain universal deliverance by nature.

Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

Having completed this, they kowtowed and pressed their cheeks to the ground, each two hundred and eighty-eight times. Then, facing downward, they bowed twelve times and said:

I, [Name], now take refuge in the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, the Great Sage Hosts who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Ninefold Earthly Sovereigns, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Officials, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces, the immortals and Jade Maidens, and the divine officials of the Boundless World’s earthly deities. Today, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps. May the merit of this act illuminate the Boundless World’s eternal night abode and the Nine Dark Realms. Universally, may it benefit emperors and kings, lords and officials, the people, Daoist masters who transmit the teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, reclusive scholars of the true Dao in mountains and forests, all worthy ones, and the myriad generations of my ancestors—those long-dead souls confined in darkness, whose past transgressions of heavenly prohibitions and earthly precepts have bound them in sin, subjecting them to karmic retribution, endless cycles of suffering, and the Five Torments without escape. By this offering of incense and lamps, I repent and seek redemption, that light may universally shine upon the eternal night abode and the Nine Dark Hells. May the imprisoned souls be freed, their karmic roots dissolved, and the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus release them from confinement. May they be delivered and ascend, entering halls of blessing, departing the evil paths, and dwelling eternally in the gates of goodness. May the living rejoice, and all under heaven know peace. Thus, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts and Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless and unite with the true Dao.

Having completed this, they kowtowed and pressed their cheeks to the ground, each one hundred and twenty times, and ceased.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declared: According to the statutes of the Luminous Perfected, to deliver the myriad generations of ancestors from their deep-rooted sins, one must perform the Daoist rites with proper observance. Then, the Nine Dark Realms will open, and the long-imprisoned dead souls will receive the light. Such is the path of great compassion, an immeasurable field of merit.

To bow humbly, kowtow, and press one’s cheeks to the ground is to offer words of reverence and repentance. When the cinnabar heart and sincere intent are fully expressed, and devotion is utterly profound, resonance will naturally occur. Though the body may be weary and unable to endure further prostration, one may still offer a heartfelt bow to the Heavenly Perfected, without need for further physical submission.

If one merely adorns the exterior while the heart grows negligent, such prostrations weary the body in vain. Yet for those of sincere devotion, whose hearts and words align, the offering of incense and the voicing of vows already penetrate the myriad heavens—birth and death, sins and retributions, all dissolve without exception.

This merit is most weighty, praised throughout the Three Realms; its blessings towering and vast, beyond all measure. The Most High Dao Lord bowed deeply and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Now having heard the Flying Heavenly Spirits expound upon the karmic bonds of sin and blessing, the supreme methods of deliverance, the rites of supplication and gratitude, and the dissolution of deep-rooted transgressions—so that in future lives, men and women may receive this grace, attain universal deliverance, and enter the light—if such goodness is practiced, yet further methods remain, I ask: when heaven sends grave disasters, the nation’s destiny falters, the stars and constellations stray from their courses, the four seasons lose their order, warfare and pestilence arise, the emperor finds no peace, plagues spread, and heaven and humanity suffer harm—what methods should be employed to dispel these calamities, deliver from peril, and resolve all inauspicious omens? I humbly beseech your teaching, that we may practice and thereby harmonize heaven and earth, assist the nation, and establish merit."

"If your instructions are received and followed, then blessings will spread throughout the ten directions, the nation’s destiny will be secure, the emperor will flourish, the realm will rejoice in peace, and boundless fortune will endure, so that in future lives, all beings may hear the sound of the Dharma."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy instructed the Flying Heavenly Spirits to expound fully upon the supreme methods of deliverance from karmic bonds of sin and blessing, and the salvation of the land from plagues, perils, and disasters—whatever had not yet been fully explained—so that the Most High Dao Lord might hear it all in detail. Thus, those who had not seen would see, those who had not heard would hear, and all beings would be universally taught, enabling them to behold the light. Having spoken thus, the Heavenly Worthy commanded that the essential instructions be reverently received.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declared: "For the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository, the *Mingzhen Statutes* of the Jade Treasury prescribe this: when the emperor’s land suffers from pestilence, warfare, or dire peril, one must inscribe the five sacred texts of the *Lingbao True Writ* in cinnabar. In the central courtyard, arrange five altars corresponding to the five directions, placing one text upon each. Offer five taels of gold, fashioning one tael into a dragon for each, so that five dragons may guard the five texts. Further, present five-colored silken pledges to honor the Five Emperors. Those afflicted by calamity, according to their age, shall offer purple-silk writs to deliver their lives, secure the nation’s destiny, and dispel heavenly disasters, aligning the stars and constellations.

In spring, kindle nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred. In summer, kindle three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred. In autumn, kindle seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred. In winter, kindle five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred. During the intercalary months, kindle twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred. Additionally, set a tall lamp, nine feet in height, with nine lamps upon it, placed at the center to illuminate the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository.

The Great Dharma Master, standing at the center, shall loosen the hair and untie the topknot, anoint the body with mud and ashes, and perform the six-hour rites of supplication and gratitude while conducting the ritual in the central courtyard. If devout men and women wish to assist the nation in prayer, they shall scatter their hair and anoint themselves with mud and ashes at the gate, presenting their pleas.

In spring, the rites last nine days and nights; in summer, three days and nights; in autumn, seven days and nights; in winter, five days and nights; and during the intercalary months, twelve days and nights. Arraying the radiant lamps, their light will shine upon the boundless worlds within the Long Night, opening the Nine Dark Realms to clarity. The light will penetrate without end, the Three Luminaries will shine brightly, heaven and earth will be at peace, the stars and constellations will return to their places, the four seasons will harmonize, all calamities will vanish, warfare and pestilence will cease, heaven and humanity will rejoice, and the nation’s destiny will flourish.

When the day’s rites conclude, burn the true writs, dispersing them in the blue smoke."

The Flying Heavenly Spirits continued: "The Dharma Master shall enter through the Earth Gate, burn incense, and circumambulate the incense and lamps three times before standing facing east. Strike the teeth thirty-six times and invoke the furnace. Then invoke the furnace of the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Qi of the Most High Dao Lord, summoning forth from within the master’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Messengers—thirty-six of each—who shall emerge in solemn array. Notify the true officials of the four directions and the local deities: 'I now burn incense and perform the Dao rites. May the qi of the ten directions’ true perfected ones enter my body, so that my prayers swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Worthy, the Jade Emperor.'

Thereafter, each shall declare their dharma rank: 'The humble disciple, the minor adept [Name], Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, respectfully addresses the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural, the Most High Dao Lord of the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the great sages who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Void Emperor, the Jade Emperor, the Great Emperor, the Eastern Flowery Peak, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Golden Towers and Jade Capitals of the Mystic Metropolis, the Seven Treasures and Mystic Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, and the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of the Radiant August Dao.

By the karmic conditions of my past lives, I was born into this Dharma gate. Through the mysterious and true deliverance, I entered the root of faith. My former master transmitted to me the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures, and by the Dharma, I am to deliver ninety-nine thousand beings, ascending to the rank of the perfected. From my ancestors through the generations to my present life, I have encountered the scriptural teachings and dwelt always within blessings. Yet my merit is slight, my virtue meager, and I have not attained immortality. With exhausted devotion, I take refuge and vow to assist the nation and establish merit.

Now the land is in disharmony, warfare and pestilence arise together, yin and yang clash violently, the stars and constellations stray from their paths, and grave calamities press heavily. The circumstances are as described. Perhaps the emperor, having received the heavenly mandate to oversee the myriad people, has not yet fully extended his benevolence to nourish the ten directions, leaving heaven and humanity unprosperous and the nation unsettled. Without songs of praise, the roads echo with stifled sobs. Thus, the Three Luminaries grow dim and disordered, great disasters spread, the emperor is anxious, and the people find no peace.'"

Now, in strict accordance with the Great Rites, I reverently disclose the true scriptures, burn incense, and kindle lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens. With sincere vows, I offer myself in service, performing the Dao to atone for calamities. I humbly beseech the celestial immortals’ nine hundred million cavalry, the terrestrial immortals’ nine hundred million cavalry, the perfected beings’ nine hundred million cavalry, the flying immortals’ nine hundred million cavalry, the divine beings’ nine hundred million cavalry, the sun and moon’s nine hundred million cavalry, the stellar constellations’ nine hundred million cavalry, the Nine Palaces’ nine hundred million cavalry, the Five Emperors’ nine hundred million cavalry, the Five Marchmounts’ nine hundred million cavalry, and the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ nine hundred million cavalry. I also invoke the thirty-two heavens’ overseers of the fast, attendants of incense, golden lads, jade maidens scattering flowers, and the thirty-two direct messengers of the Five Emperors, along with the flying dragon couriers who transmit words and memorials. May they all descend together to oversee the ritual hall, witness the offering of incense and the recitation of vows, and ensure that every word ascends directly. When the Dao-performing rites are complete, those who have rendered meritorious service shall be reported to the immortal officials.

Next, three offerings of incense:
The humble disciple, a minor adept of the Three Caverns and Great Master of the Dao, now stands in attendance. With the first offering of incense, I vow that through this merit, the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people under heaven, along with the seven generations of their parents, may depart from sorrow and suffering and ascend to the celestial halls. Thus, I burn incense, taking refuge in body, spirit, and life in the Great Dao. I prostrate myself, bowing my head to the ground, and take refuge in the Most High Three Worthies. May this merit flow to the seven generations of parents under heaven, beseeching deliverance from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, that they may ascend to the celestial halls, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and they may dwell eternally in non-action. Thus, I burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of my master, the great sagely host of perfected beings. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Now, standing in attendance, with the second offering of incense, I vow that through this merit, the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers, officials, and people, the masters who transmit the Dao, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, and all those who dwell in mountains and forests to study the true Dao, along with all worthy ones, may each attain their Way. I take refuge in body, spirit, and life in the Great Dao. I prostrate myself, bowing my head to the ground, and take refuge in the Three Masters Most High. May this merit flow to the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers, officials, and people, the masters who transmit the Dao, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, and all those who dwell in mountains and forests to study the true Dao, along with all worthy ones. May each attain their Way, dwell in peace and non-action, and enjoy eternal blessings. Thus, I burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of my master, the great sagely host of most venerable perfected beings. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Now, standing in attendance, with the third offering of incense, I vow that through this merit, I may swiftly attain the immortal Dao, along with my ninefold kin, fellow disciples within the nation, all people under heaven, and all creatures—whether crawling, flying, wriggling, or breathing—both those already born and those yet to be born. May all be perfected. I take refuge in body, spirit, and life in the Great Dao. I prostrate myself, bowing my head to the ground, and take refuge in the Most High Three Worthies. May this merit flow to my own person, that I may attain transcendence and ultimately enter non-action, uniting in virtue with the Four Great Elements. May all people under heaven and all sentient beings be delivered from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, the five poisons, water and fire, bandits, epidemics, ghostly harms, and all calamities. May the nation be at peace and the world prosper. Thus, I burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of my master, the great sagely host of perfected beings. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Next, facing east, nine bows are performed, and the following is recited:
Heaven and earth are in disharmony, yin and yang clash violently. The four seasons lose their harmony, and disasters and harms spread. The stellar constellations are disordered, foretelling inauspicious omens. The nation is in turmoil, warfare and pestilence arise together. The emperor is grieved, and the people find no peace. In strict accordance with the Great Rites, I disclose the true scriptures and take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless East, the host of great sages who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable ones, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the various spirit officials of the eastern realm. Now, I establish this fast, baring my heart and revealing my form, acknowledging my faults and restraining myself to atone for the nation’s calamities. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens, casting light into the boundless darkness of the Nine Nether Realms, opening all radiance. Through this merit, may the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people be freed from disasters and misfortunes. May the Three Luminaries return to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility. Thus, I burn incense, taking refuge in body, spirit, and life in the virtue of my master, the great sagely host of perfected beings. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Upon completion, the headscarf is removed, and the forehead is pressed to the ground in full prostration, repeated eighty-one times.

Next, facing south, three bows are performed, and the following is recited:
Heaven and earth are in disharmony, yin and yang clash violently. The four seasons lose their harmony, and disasters and harms spread. The stellar constellations are disordered, foretelling inauspicious omens. The nation is in turmoil, warfare and pestilence arise together. The emperor is grieved, and the people find no peace. In strict accordance with the Great Rites, I disclose the true scriptures and take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless South, the host of great sages who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable ones, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the various spirit officials of the southern realm. Now, I establish this fast, baring my heart and revealing my form, acknowledging my faults and restraining myself to atone for the nation’s calamities. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens, casting light into the boundless darkness of the Nine Nether Realms, opening all radiance. Through this merit, may the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people be freed from disasters and misfortunes. May the Three Luminaries return to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Now, therefore, I burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the virtue of the Master, the Venerable Ones, the Perfected, and the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, ascending into formlessness after their enlightenment to merge with the Dao in truth. Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—twenty-seven times in all, and no more.

Then, facing west, I perform seven bows, saying:
Heaven and Earth are obstructed, yin and yang clash in punishment. The four seasons lose their harmony, disasters and harms arise in succession. The celestial bodies are disordered, foretelling inauspicious omens. The land is thrown into turmoil, warfare and illness spread together. The emperor and kings grieve, the myriad people know no peace.

Now, I strictly follow the Great Rites, baring the true scriptures, surrendering to the boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the West, the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, and the various spirit officials of the western realm.

Now, therefore, I burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the virtue of the Master, the Venerable Ones, the Perfected, and the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, ascending into formlessness after their enlightenment to merge with the Dao in truth. Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—sixty-three times in all, and no more.

Then, facing north, I perform five bows, saying:
Heaven and Earth are obstructed, yin and yang clash in punishment. The four seasons lose their harmony, disasters and harms arise in succession. The celestial bodies are disordered, foretelling inauspicious omens. The land is thrown into turmoil, warfare and illness spread together. The emperor and kings grieve, the myriad people know no peace.

Now, I strictly follow the Great Rites, baring the true scriptures, surrendering to the boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, and the various spirit officials of the northern realm. Now, I establish this fast, baring my heart and revealing my form, acknowledging my faults and restraining myself to atone for the nation’s calamities. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens, casting light into the boundless darkness of the Nine Nether Realms, opening all radiance. Through this merit, may the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people be freed from disasters and misfortunes. May the Three Luminaries return to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Now, therefore, I burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the virtue of the Master, the Venerable Ones, the Perfected, and the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, ascending into formlessness after their enlightenment to merge with the Dao in truth. Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—forty-five times in all, and no more.

Then, facing northeast, I perform one bow, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed and in turmoil, when yin and yang clash and punish one another, when the four seasons lose their harmony, disasters and calamities arise in succession. The stellar lodges fall into disarray, heralding omens of misfortune; the land is thrown into chaos, with warfare and illness spreading unchecked. The emperor and rulers grieve in sorrow, and the myriad people find no peace.

In solemn observance of the Great Rites, I now unfold the true scriptures, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Venerable Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless in the Northeast, to the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, to the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, to the Heavenly Lords of Brahma-qi, and to the divine officials of the Northeast quarter.

Thus, I establish this fast, baring my heart and exposing my form, acknowledging my faults and chastising myself. For the nation, I seek to dispel calamities, burning incense and kindling lamps to illuminate the heavens above and cast light into the boundless, eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms below, opening all paths to radiance. Through this merit, may the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people be freed from disasters and misfortunes. May the Three Luminaries return to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—nine times in all, and no more.

Then, facing southeast, I perform one bow, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed and in turmoil, when yin and yang clash in mutual harm, when the four seasons lose their harmony, disasters and calamities spread unchecked, and the celestial bodies fall into disarray, portending ill omens. The realm is thrown into chaos, warfare and disease rage together, the emperor grieves in sorrow, and the myriad people find no peace.

In reverent accordance with the Great Law, I now reveal the true scripture, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Venerable Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless in the Southeast, the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Heavenly Lords of Brahma-qi, and the divine officials of the Southeast. Today, I establish this fast, baring my heart and revealing my form, acknowledging my faults and restraining myself, beseeching the nation’s deliverance from calamity. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the heavens above and shine upon the Nine Dark Realms within the boundless, eternal night below, unveiling all radiant light. Through this merit, may the emperor and rulers of the nation, their ministers and officials, and all people be freed from disasters and misfortunes. May the Three Luminaries return to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Now, therefore, I burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the virtue of the Master, the Venerable Ones, the Perfected, and the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, ascending into formlessness after their enlightenment to merge with the Dao in truth. Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—nine times in all, and no more.

Then, facing southwest, I perform one bow, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed, yin and yang clash in conflict, the four seasons lose their harmony, and calamities flow forth; when the celestial lodgings are entangled, portending ill omens; when the land is thrown into turmoil, warfare and illness spread together; when the emperor grieves in sorrow and the myriad people know no peace—

I now reverently follow the Great Rites, unfolding the true scriptures, and surrender body, spirit, and life to the Venerable Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless in the Southwest, the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Heavenly Lords of Pristine Qi, and the divine officials of the Southwest Quarter.

Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—nine times in all, and no more.

Then, facing northwest, I perform one bow, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed and in turmoil, when yin and yang clash in mutual harm, when the four seasons lose their harmony, disasters and calamities spread unchecked. The constellations fall into disarray, portending ill omens; the land is thrown into chaos, with warfare and disease raging together. The emperor is grieved, and the myriad people find no peace.

In reverent accordance with the Great Law, I now reveal the true scripture, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Venerable and Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite in the Northwest, to the Great Sages who have attained the Dao, to the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, to the Heavenly Lords of Pristine Qi, and to the divine officials of the Northwest.

Then, facing northwest, I perform thirty-two bows to the Upper Realm, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed, yin and yang clash in punishment, the four seasons lose harmony, and disasters and calamities spread. The stellar lodges entangle, foretelling ill omens; the land is thrown into turmoil, war and illness rage together. The emperor and kings grieve, and the myriad people know no peace.

Reverently following the Great Law, I reveal the true scriptures and surrender body, spirit, and life to the Upper Realm’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the enlightened assembly of Great Sages, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Realized Ones of the Jade Capital, Mystic Capital, and Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Jade Maidens, Divine Immortals, and all spirit officials. Now, therefore, I establish this retreat, baring my heart and exposing my form, acknowledging my faults and chastising myself to atone for the nation’s misfortunes. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the heavens above and shine upon the Nine Dark Realms within the boundless long night below, unveiling all radiance. May this merit and power be dedicated to the emperor, kings, rulers, ministers, officials, and all people, that disasters be dispelled, misfortunes averted, the Three Luminaries restored to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—eighty-eight times each.

Then, facing southeast, I perform twelve bows to the Lower Realm, saying:

When Heaven and Earth are obstructed, yin and yang clash in punishment, the four seasons lose harmony, and disasters and calamities spread. The stellar lodges entangle, foretelling ill omens; the land is thrown into turmoil, war and illness rage together. The emperor and kings grieve, and the myriad people know no peace.

Now, therefore, I establish this retreat, baring my heart and exposing my form, acknowledging my faults and chastising myself to atone for the nation’s misfortunes. I burn incense and kindle lamps to illuminate the heavens above and shine upon the Nine Dark Realms within the boundless long night below, unveiling all radiance. May this merit and power be dedicated to the emperor, kings, rulers, ministers, officials, and all people, that disasters be dispelled, misfortunes averted, the Three Luminaries restored to their positions, the Five Phases follow their proper course, warfare cease, illnesses be cured, the nation’s fortune flourish, the people rejoice in peace, and gods and humans dwell in tranquility.

Having completed this, I bow in prostration, striking my breast—one hundred and eight times each.

Then, circling three times, I recite the *Lingzhang* of the *BuXu*.

Next, to the incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the incense-bearing dragon couriers, I command: Announce this retreat hall, where the spontaneous golden elixir, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure herbs flourish. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected gather here before this incense burner, that I may attain the Dao, achieve immortality, my household receive blessings, the world be graced with favor, and the jade lads and maidens of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, transmitting my prayers directly to the throne of the Boundless Supreme Great Dao.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: The duration of Daoist practice may be adjusted as one sees fit. Though human endeavors follow the four seasons and the cycles of the Five Phases, even three days and nights of earnest supplication with a sincere heart will move the heavens. Scholars may proceed according to their capacity.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: When kings and emperors perform rites to avert disasters and transcend calamities, they use five-colored silks corresponding to the directions, each of specified length. Dragons are adorned with superior gold, and the ritual silks bear purple patterns, honoring the celestial hierarchy. Commoners use plain silk, dragons are adorned with medium gold, and the lamp offerings follow the same protocol. Those who violate this are examined by the Celestial Bureau of the Mystic Capital.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Upon receiving the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, cast three golden dragons into the water palace, a sacred mountain, and one’s residence—three locations in total—as a pledge of one’s commitment to Daoist cultivation. Failing this, the Three Officials will retain one’s life register, and prayers will not reach their destination. Violations are examined by the Earthly Bureau of the Nine Capitals according to the Jade Instructions.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Upon receiving the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, use forty feet of patterned silk in each of the five directions to invoke the Five Emperors as a pledge of one’s oath. Without this, the Five Emperors will not accept one’s name, and the demon kings of the Five Emperors will disrupt one’s resolve. Violations are examined by the Water Bureau of the Yellow Springs.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Upon receiving the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, use five ounces of superior gold to pledge allegiance to the Five Peaks as a sign of reverence for the sacred scriptures. Without this, one incurs the penalty of disrespecting the scriptures, and the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks will not register one’s name among the learners. Violations are examined by the Yin Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Upon receiving the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, use two hundred and forty gold coins as a pledge to the twenty-four qi-generating officials, affirming one’s sincerity. Without this, the gods of the Three Departments and Eight Sceneries will not transfer one’s life register. If gold is unavailable, six hundred copper coins may suffice. Violations are examined by the General Spirit Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: If scholars do not kindle lamps and burn incense, their seven ancestors will not be liberated from the Nine Dark Realms within the long night, and their bodies will lack radiance. Violations are examined by the Supreme Yin Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: If scholars do not observe fasts and uphold precepts, their seven ancestors will not ascend to the celestial halls, their bodies will lack purity, and they will not attract the presence of spirits. Those who can uphold fasts and precepts will find their thoughts swiftly answered, and their merits naturally manifest. Violations are examined by the Supreme Yang Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: The celestial texts are profoundly sacred and are not treasured without faith. Thus, the supreme sages demonstrate their hearts through faith. Without faith, one becomes base in the Dao; without covenants, one trivializes the sacred. Violations are examined by the Left and Right Official Bureaus.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Scriptures not transmitted by a master lack the Five Emperors’ covenant. To recklessly peruse their contents is a transgression equal to stealing scriptures. Violations are examined by the Bureau of Illuminated Laws.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Those who receive scriptures must first present their pledge before wearing them. Should they later encounter a worthy person and offer their pledge to request transmission, they must use the received pledge to complete the term of their former master, with any remainder to be used for their own practice. Violations are examined by the Fire Official Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: For the pledges of transmitted scriptures, one-tenth must be offered to the ancestral master, and another two-tenths distributed to the poor, mendicant Daoists, and mountain-dwelling adepts. The remaining pledge is to be used for one’s own practice—burning incense, kindling lamps, and establishing merit for disciples. Violations are examined by the Three Officials Bureau.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: Those who regret receiving scriptures and recklessly disseminate celestial texts will be examined by the Bureau of Wrongdoing, and their lineage will be extinguished in the long night for three years.

Do not treat the Three Treasures lightly, do not leak the true scriptures, do not deceive your master or violate righteousness, do not claim merit or fame for yourself, do not disrespect heaven or belittle earth, do not defile or insult the Three Luminaries, do not pollute the Five Peaks, do not encroach upon or slight the spirits, do not speak falsely while harboring deceit, do not envy or harm the worthy and capable, do not withhold alms or begrudge acts of merit, and do not indulge in greed or seek self-glorification.

The Flying Heavenly Spirits declare: The statutes of the Illuminated True Regulations delineate the boundaries of transgression and blessing, as outlined above. Those of utmost sincerity who diligently cultivate the statutes, uphold the laws, and do not violate the scriptures will naturally evoke hidden resonance. Heaven will illumine their hearts, and their seven ancestors will swiftly be liberated from the Nine Dark Realms of the long night, ascending to the celestial halls. Their clothing and sustenance will come naturally, and they will soon be reborn into the houses of kings and nobles. In this life, they will radiate brilliance, and their blessings will be boundless. By ceaselessly practicing with devotion, they will attain the rank of divine immortals.

The *Dongxuan Lingbao* *Jade Casket of the Illuminated True Statutes for the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night* concludes.

Those who receive such retribution—should they not repent and reform, their sins will be recorded in the celestial ledgers. Even if they were to perform good deeds for ten thousand kalpas, they would still be bound by their past transgressions. Their misfortunes will multiply, their lifespans will be cut short, and they will be conscripted into laborious servitude. Their descendants will suffer poverty and hardship, and their families will be scattered and ruined.

According to the manuscript P.2406, this passage begins here, preceded by the title *"Ritual Ordinances of the Supreme Pervasive Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Illuminating the True."* Manuscript P.2442 omits this title. The ritual implements shall be nine feet in height, and all procedures must follow the established methods.

In the Dunhuang manuscripts, following the phrases *"Supervisors of the Ritual Fast, Attending Incense Golden Lads, and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,"* the text includes *"thirty-two persons"* in each instance.

The character *"et cetera"* is supplied according to the Dunhuang manuscripts. The character *"petition"* is likewise supplied. *"Emperors, kings, and lords of states"* appears as *"emperors, lords, and kings"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, and this convention is maintained throughout without further annotation. *"Rulers, officials, and common folk"* appears as *"rulers, ministers, officials, and common folk"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, and this is likewise followed in most subsequent instances without further annotation.

In the Dunhuang manuscripts, the petitionary invocations often replace *"so-and-so"* with *"Jia."* The term *"take refuge"* appears as *"return to refuge"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts.

From *"Now, therefore, we establish this ritual fast..."* to *"unite with the Dao and merge with the True,"* the Dunhuang manuscripts abbreviate the entire petitionary invocation of over one hundred and fifty characters to *"May the above dharma be remembered with devotion."* This convention is maintained in subsequent passages without further annotation.

The three sections of scripture beginning with *"Next, bow once toward the southeast"* are condensed in the Dunhuang manuscripts as follows: *"Next, bow once toward the southeast, then the southwest, then the northwest—each of the four directions—with nine prostrations, nine bows touching the forehead to the ground, and nine invocations of submission, all performed in the same manner as for the northeast."*

*"Next, face the upper direction"* appears as *"After the four directions are completed, next face the northwest upper direction"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Next, face the lower direction"* appears as *"next face the southeast lower direction."*

*"Ninefold Walled Earthly Sovereigns"* appears as *"Ninefold Earthly Jade Sovereigns"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Military incursions"* was originally *"military epidemics"* and has been emended according to the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Expounds"* appears as *"states the expounded"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Diseases and rashes"* appears as *"disasters and illnesses"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, which is more accurate.

The Dunhuang manuscripts omit the phrase *"burn incense."* *"Activate the incense burner"* appears as *"declare, saying"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. The Dunhuang manuscripts omit the phrase *"next, activate the incense burner."* *"The Attending Incense Golden Lads transmit the words of the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens"* appears as *"the Attending Incense Jade Lads and Attending Incense Jade Maidens"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts.

*"Submit one’s life"* appears as *"offer one’s body and life"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Disasters and illnesses"* appears as *"perils and disasters"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"One fears that emperors may receive the heavenly mandate to abdicate"* appears as *"truly, as emperors receive the heavenly fortune"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts.

*"Incomplete"* appears as *"unable"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"No songs are sung on the road, and voices are stifled"* appears as *"no grace is sung, and voices are stifled on the road"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, with the subsequent *"thus"* rendered as *"thereby."*

Following the phrases *"Supervisors of the Ritual Fast, Attending Incense Golden Lads, and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,"* the Dunhuang manuscripts include *"thirty-two persons"* in each instance.

*"Those with meritorious service report their merits to the Three Officials"* appears as *"Those with diligent service petition the Transcendent Officials; then rise, face east, offer incense three times, and recite the incantation"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, which omits the subsequent phrase *"next, take three pinches of incense."*

*"First pinch of incense"* appears as *"burn incense"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts. *"Now, therefore, your servant establishes this and takes a second pinch of incense"* appears as *"Next, take three more pinches of incense and recite the incantation: Now, therefore, your servant burns this incense"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts, and this convention is maintained for *"third pinch of incense."*

*"May your servant swiftly attain the Dao of immortality, along with nine generations of kin"* was originally *"May your servant attain the Dao of immortality and befriend nine kinds of relatives,"* and has been emended according to the Dunhuang manuscripts.

This sentence in the Dunhuang manuscripts reads: *"After the invocation for the offering of incense is completed, face east, bow nine times, and declare."* The Dunhuang manuscripts omit the phrase *"Most High Numinous Treasure."* In subsequent passages, the names of the Heavenly Worthies of the West, North, and other directions likewise omit *"Most High Numinous Treasure"* in the Dunhuang manuscripts.

*"Acknowledge faults and self-discipline"* was mistakenly written as *"seek and self-discipline,"* and has been emended according to the Dunhuang manuscripts. Hereafter, all instances of *"seek and self-discipline"* are emended accordingly without further annotation.
