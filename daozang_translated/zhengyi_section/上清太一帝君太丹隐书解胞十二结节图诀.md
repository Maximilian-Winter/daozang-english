The life of a person transforms from the primordial womb and takes form through the essence of blood. Thus, after birth, the womb continues to knot, and after formation, the blood ceases to flow. That which does not flow—the Supreme Unity Lord blends and harmonizes it, causing it to remain. The womb possesses twelve knotted nodes, entwining and solidifying the Five Viscera. When the Five Viscera are obstructed, the knots cannot be untied, nor the nodes removed. Hence, human illness arises from the stagnation of nodes, and human death from the solidification of knots.

On one’s life-destiny day or the eight solar terms, one should invoke the Supreme Unity Lord to blend and harmonize, commanding the hundred spirits to untie the stubborn knots within the womb and the dead nodes of deep-rooted entanglement. The womb has twelve knots, and within it, twelve nodes. The nodes reside within the knots. Those who do not know how to untie the womb’s knots and nodes will not escape death. Those who constantly untie them attain longevity.

The knots of the upper womb:
1. Within the Mud-Pill Palace,
2. Within the mouth,
3. Within the cheeks,
4. Within the eyes—
these four knots of the womb reside in the upper region.

The knots of the middle womb:
1. Within the Five Viscera,
2. Within the Great Granary,
3. Within the large intestine,
4. Within the small intestine—
these four knots of the womb reside in the middle region.

The knots of the lower womb:
1. Within the Bladder,
2. Within the yin organ,
3. Within the posterior gate,
4. Within the two feet—
these four knots of the womb reside in the lower region.

The method for untying the knots: Enter a chamber, close the door, and engage in visualization. First recite the names of the hundred spirits below the Supreme Unity Lord, then proceed to untie the knots in sequence. This method is the Way of the Supreme Unity Lord blending with the twenty-four spirits to untie knots and expel corpse-qi.

On one’s life-destiny day or the eight solar terms, at noon or midnight, sit upright facing the direction of one’s life-destiny. Join the hands, compose the mind, and knock the teeth twenty-four times, saying:

*"Male disciple [Name], humbly invokes the Womb Father and Womb Mother. On the day of my birth, the three accumulations of stagnant blood transformed into twelve great knots. Today, on my life-destiny day, I reverently summon the gods of the Three Nines and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones to untie the three barriers and twelve knots."*

The invocation of the summoned:
*"In the east, the Azure Emperor at the Carved Beam’s Edge, whose name is Qingping..."*

The Five Emperors of the Five Directions, each corresponding to their directional color, may be adorned with suitable hues:

The Red Emperor of the South, Changlaijue, styled Nanhe.
The White Emperor of the West, Zhang’anxing, styled Xihua.
The Black Emperor of the North, Baochengchang, styled Beifa.
The Old Master of the Mysterious Unity, Lin Xufu, styled Ling Shidao, clad in green—hereafter, attire follows the annotations; otherwise, colors may be chosen as appropriate.

The Three Pristine Lords, Laozhangshang, styled Shengdao, clad in plain white.
The Left Immortal of the Orthodox Unity, Zhong Chengzi, also named Dibin, styled Sihua, clad in purple.
The Right Immortal of the Orthodox Unity, Qu Youzi, also named Guangxian, styled Linghe, clad in pale red.
The Lesser Lad of the Grand Tenuity, Gan Jingjing, styled Huiyuanzhi, also named Sanjinjiao or Duizizhen, clad in crimson.

The Upper Womb’s Inner Perfected Ones, numbering nine, merge with the nine qi to form the Nine Lords, who untie the knots at the Upper Barrier. When the four knots of the Upper Barrier dissolve, the flow of essences and blood is restored, the register of longevity is inscribed above, and one becomes an Imperial Immortal forever.

The Venerable Deity of the Supreme Unity, Wuyoushou, styled Guihuichang, also named Xianming or Jipin, clad in deep purple.
The Right Unsurpassed Duke, Xuanyuanshu, styled Hefuzi, also named Yuansu Jun or Shen Gongzi, clad in pale red.
The Right White Prime of Cavernous Yang, Yu Lingbiao, styled Xuanyi Jue, also named Zhu Jing or Qicheng, clad in crimson.
The Central Director of Destinies, the Venerable Lord Limingchu, styled Xuandu Qing, also named Shenzong or Linghua, clad in purple.
The Peach Lord of the Gate of Destiny, Haidaokang, styled Hejingyan, also named Mingwang or Baogen, clad in pale red.
The Celestial Emperor of the Mud-Pill Palace, Shangyi Chizi Xuanningtian, styled Sanyuanxian, also named Bowushang or Boshi Hua, clad in crimson.
The Minister of the Celestial Emperor of the Mud-Pill Palace, Zhaole Jing, styled Zhong Xuansheng, also named Qifei or Changfu, clad in purple.
The Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace’s Central Elixir Field, Shen Yunzhu, styled Zinan Dan, also named Shengshang Bo or Shiyun Ju, clad in pale crimson.
The Assistant Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, Zhongguang Jian, styled Sihua Ling, also named Youche Bo or Dong Shi Hua, clad in crimson.

The Nine Perfected Ones of the Central Womb, forming the Nine Lords, revolve the nine qi of the spirit to transform and enter the Crimson Palace. The great knots of the five viscera, the large and small intestines, all dissolve; the four knots disperse and flourish. The Central Barrier is harmonized, its flow directed to the Great Granary. A thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes vanish in an instant. One’s name is inscribed in the register of life above, and one remains forever free from disaster.

The Lower One of the Gate of Destiny, Huangting Yuanshi Mingjing, styled Yuanyang Chang, also named Ying’er Tai or Boshi Yuan, clad in purple.
The Guardian and Protector of the Yellow Court, Guishang Ming, styled Guxia Xuan, also named Chengshen Bo or Chengguang Sheng, clad in red-yellow.
The First Lord of the White Qi within the Womb, Wuxuanzi, styled Yushang Sheng, clad in plain white.
The Second Lord of the Green Qi within the Knots, Anyanchang, styled Hehe Ying, clad in green.
The Third Lord of the Black Qi within the Nodes, Binlaisheng, styled Jingshang Men, clad in black.
The Fourth Lord of the Yellow Qi within the Womb, Zumingche, styled Shenwuji, clad in yellow.
The Fifth Lord of the Red Qi within the Blood, Hunlizi, styled Shubaojian, clad in crimson.
The Sixth Lord, the Upper Mysterious Primordial Father, Gaotongsheng, styled Zuo Huiming, clad in pale purple.
The Seventh Lord, the Lower Mysterious Primordial Mother, Shu Huowang, styled You Huiguang, clad in crimson.

The Nine Lords of the Lower Womb, the Inner Perfected Ones of the Embryo, generate and transform the nine qi, which are the nine souls. When the nine souls form knots of essence within the embryo, the nodes harden, causing one’s lifespan to be short and leading to an early demise. Today, on one’s life-destiny day, as at the time of one’s initial birth, one beseeches the dissolution of the twelve roots of death. One’s name is inscribed in the Jade Register above, the Five Talismans enter the body, and the nine qi are pacified below. One attains eternal continuity, the Nine Palaces open above, and the Nine Barriers open below.

After reciting the ritual twice, conclude by harmonizing the mind and regulating the breath, ensuring the voice does not falter or stumble. Then, with eyes closed, visualize and invoke the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate’s Purple Chamber, Feng Lingfan, styled Lü Changling, also named Qiling or Shen Zhangren.

Thus invoke thrice, then visualize the Nine True Lords who untie the knots: the Azure Emperor of the East at the Carved Beam’s Edge and the twenty-seven others, down to the Primordial Mother Shu Huowang, all clad in crimson robes and yellow headscarves. The yellow headscarves resemble the shape of a traveler’s cap. Their forms are like those of infants, varying in height. If the practitioner cannot memorize or visualize even a few of them, they may enter the chamber and proceed according to the text.

Thereafter, the colors of mountains, clouds, qi, and figures may be chosen as appropriate. Next, lead the Supreme Ultimate’s Purple Chamber to face north toward the Celestial Emperor, each kneeling in reverence, and say:

“The Nine of the Upper Barrier, beginning with the Azure Emperor at the Carved Beam’s Edge; the Nine of the Central Barrier, beginning with the Supreme Unity’s Wuyoushou; and the Nine of the Lower Barrier, beginning with the Lower One of the Yellow Court, Huangting Mingjing—twenty-seven in total—today, by the qi of destiny, swallow inwardly. The Three Barriers open above; each barrier has twenty-four knots, and each knot has twenty-four sinews. The sinews are now severed, the knots dissolved. The essences and blood surge upward, filling the Mud-Pill Palace; the Jade Fluid flows downward, nourishing the hundred spirits. Today, [Name] is inscribed in the Celestial Register as a Longevous Divine Immortal.”

Upon completion, visualize the Supreme Unity summoning the practitioner to ascend before the Celestial Emperor. The Celestial Emperor says: “The knots of the embryo are now unblocked; the light shines within and permeates without. You are granted longevity, and your destiny shall not falter. You may now merge with my form.”

The Celestial Emperor then opens his mouth, and the practitioner suddenly enters, arriving at the Celestial Emperor’s Palace of the Six Harmonies.

Within the Celestial Emperor’s Palace of the Six Harmonies, there resides the Supreme Divine One, named Chong Mingkong, styled You Liaowu. He addresses the practitioner, saying: “You may now consume the essence of the sun.” The practitioner then gathers the solar essence and ingests it, swallowing nine times before stopping.

Presently, the twenty-seven Perfected Ones, previously seen, stand arrayed to the practitioner’s left and right. The twenty-seven Perfected Ones declare: “[Name]’s embryonic register is now dissolved; all impure qi is expelled. Your countenance shines with jade-like luster, your body permeates the Great Void. You shall enjoy longevity for millions of years, your destiny aligned with the Celestial Emperor’s.”

Next, visualize the Celestial Emperor offering this invocation: “In heaven, united with the Perfected—this is [Name]’s body. In heaven, united with the numinous—this is [Name]’s form.” After a long while, the visualization is complete.

This is the Nine Lords’ Convergence, wherein the hundred spirits are inwardly transformed, the embryonic knots untied, the three barriers opened and harmonized. Above, it accords with the Six Harmonies; alongside, it merges with the Radiant Celestial Emperor. The destiny register is altered, qi stabilizes within the Mud-Pill Palace, and upon receiving the talisman of longevity, one becomes a Heavenly Immortal.

Once the visualization is fully accomplished, loosen the hair, comb it anew, untie and retie the garments, and wash the hands and feet.

Within the Celestial Emperor’s Mud-Pill Palace lies another Palace of the Six Harmonies, wherein dwells the Imperial Supreme Unity Lord, named Chong Mingkong, styled You Liaowu. Those who know this may regenerate their decayed bones, cause the five viscera to flourish, and remain unafraid for life. In moments of fear, face north and call this name thrice, reciting: *“Luo A Chong Mingkong, Lei Feng You Liaowu, born of the Celestial Emperor’s form, protect [Name] and dispel all sorrow.”* Upon completion, it shall be as though a thousand companions stand beside you.

The Supreme Unity states: “Humans possess three hun-souls, which benefit one’s preservation; they also possess seven po-souls, which harm one’s destiny. The seven po-souls dwell beneath the left eye by day and beneath the nose by night.” For those who practice the Dao and wish to sleep, first press the right fingernail to the left eye’s underside and the philtrum, each thirty-seven times—this is most efficacious, for it is the method to restrain the seven po-souls.

The Celestial Emperor says: “The Supreme Unity’s *Precious Mystic Jade Canon* is concealed within the Flowery Chambers of the Five Marchmounts. Those without immortal registers may neither hear nor behold it. Those who see it shall live; those who practice it shall ascend. Thus, solemn oaths are sworn, binding one’s celestial authenticity to prevent its dissemination or deviation.”

Since the Heavenly Worthy reveres the immortals, this Dao is kept profoundly secret. It is not transmitted to those without immortal bones, nor revealed to those lacking utmost sincerity. As the scripture states: *“The disciple receives with reverence.”* The transmission of scriptures follows the master’s instruction; receiving the scripture and applying it is the disciple’s path.

During transmission, both master and disciple observe a seven-day fast, or ten days, with an additional eight-day purification fast preceding and following—this is called the *Announcement Fast*. In ancient times, oaths were sealed with blood and severed hair, altars were erected, and Heaven was invoked to ensure secrecy and fidelity. Today, one may substitute gold rings and azure silk for the body’s hair and flesh, arranging them in a separate retreat while invoking the Supreme August One.

The ritual requires three gold rings, bright and radiant, and nine feet of azure silk to substitute for the threefold covenant—alternatively, twenty-seven feet may be used. The scripture must be copied in duplicate, one for the master and one for the disciple. All items for the oath must be prepared and may not be privately used for personal gain.

As the *Central Scripture of the Supreme* states: *“The master imparts the scriptural practice, hence the disciple is called the ‘living recipient.’ Through study, sincerity is unified; through oaths sworn to Heaven, the spirits are bound; through shared joys and sorrows, the bond equals life and death. Only then may one be tested and ultimately ascend together to the immortal courts.”*

Thereafter, bow and receive the teaching, perform the oath in a secluded chamber, and honor the three covenants with reverence. Distinguish the earnestness of your devotion, treasure the scripture’s secrecy, and practice its essential teachings. With unwavering sincerity, respect the master and scripture, and never allow negligence in your heart. Only thus may one speak of communion with the divine and the covenant of Dao and virtue.

Those who uphold the scripture and conceal its Dao, who act in accordance with its oaths, shall have their names inscribed on jade tablets and their records written in the Supreme Ultimate’s celestial register. Should one violate this Dao, their seven ancestors shall suffer the trials of the Wind Blade, their Mystic Mother endure the calamity of fetal dissolution, their body become a lowly ghost, and their lineage be extinguished. They shall be crushed beneath the stones of Mount Lianmeng and cast into the River of Accumulated Nights. Alas! Let those with hearts take heed and guard this secrecy.

These are the covenant commands of the Supreme Perfected, expounded by Celestial Master Zhang in the *Cinnabar Radiance Scripture*. Such are the solemn oaths of caution.

Those who receive the Dao of the Supreme Celestial Emperor shall proceed thus, and so it is recorded for practice.

The three gold rings seal the oath of the Three Origins. The twenty-seven feet of azure silk serve as the ceremonial cloth, binding the oath of the Celestial Emperor’s twenty-four spirits. Five ounces of red silk seal the oath of the Five Divine Lords. Two packets of blended incense serve as the medium for invoking the spirits and exchanging qi. One brush, one hundred sheets of paper, and one ounce of cinnabar are used to inscribe the oath.

These five items are to be contained in vessels and kept from exposure, all prepared by the scripture’s recipient. Once the disciple has copied the text, they shall present the scripture and offerings to the master’s chamber to receive it. Only after the oath may it be practiced.

Those who practice without receiving the oath, as per the *Female Azure Scripture*, shall lose both luminaries. Those who receive but do not practice shall suffer celestial calamities. Those who practice but divulge it shall endure the Wind Blade’s trials. Those who transmit it to the unworthy shall cause their seven generations of parents to suffer. Such are the decrees of the *Mystic Capital’s Ghostly Statutes* and the *Female Azure Scripture*.
