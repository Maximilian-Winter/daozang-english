### *Upper Clarity Scripture of the Released Grades of the Azure Lad from the Outer Realms, Scroll One*

#### *The Hidden Primordial Writ of the Lofty One from the Celestial Realm*

The Supreme Perfected Jade Guardian King of Upper Clarity and the Grand Minister of State commanded the Master of Lofty Dawn, the Azure Lad of the Jade Gate of the Eastern Sea, to receive the *Hidden Primordial Writ of the Released Grades from the Outer Realms of the Supreme Jade Emperor*.

This Dao is most wondrous, born before the Nine Mysteries, forming the natural chapters of soaring dark-purple *qi*. Its numinous writ manifests marvels, shining brilliantly in Upper Clarity. After ninety thousand kalpas, it was inscribed upon the Green Jasper Realm’s Spirit Bird Mountain, set upon the Eastern Florescence’s cavern and the Dark Garden’s piled stones to the north. Its flowing radiance illumines the Great Void; sun and moon flank its glow. The Five Dawns bear its spirit; the Eight Simplicities intertwine. The Four Convergences weave mist; flying auroras veil the *qi*. The maidens of golden splendor and the lads of jade dawn—three hundred each—attend and guard the sacred writ.

The Heavenly Consorts waft incense; the numinous winds scatter truth. Flying dragons and coursing beasts array before the Jade Pass. Vermilion phoenixes preen their wings; divine simurghs shade the dark. The Western Florescence hosts its rites; ten thousand sages bow in the celestial court.

On the first day of the third month of the inaugural year of the Central August Era, at the hour when Heavenly Virtue aligns, the Azure Lad, Minister of the Uppermost, purified himself in the empty mountains. He swore a golden-green pact with Heaven and received from the Supreme One the writ. He traversed the Six Realms, trod the famed mountains, circled the Five Peaks, and walked the sources of all rivers. The Five Thearchs lent their wings; his numinous chariot descended. The hosts of the Ten Realms and the assembled sages feasted in the vast court. He explored the remote and obscure, grasped the formless, and channeled flowing essence to illumine the Dao. The Great Yang unleashed lightning to manifest its power. The Seven Primes coursed through the purple void; the Eight Effulgences reined their steeds to ascend and fly. He chanted the jade tones of the Outer Realms, releasing the divine grades into subtlety. He commanded the Five Elders to order their ranks and summoned the ten thousand perfected to gather. The Nine Numinous harmonized; the Three Radiant merged their splendor. The Cinnabar Numinous announced auspices; the Supreme One oversaw and reflected. His rank ascended to Upper Minister; his name was inscribed in the Purple Dawn. His body was clad in a nine-hued frost-silk robe; he wore the flowing, luminous, cavernous, primordial writ of the Radiant Effulgence. His crown, the Hundred-Transformations Numinous Treasure, bore cascading bells. Ninefold cinnabar clouds entwined him. The golden-florescence jade maidens and the purple-dawn lads—three thousand each—attended the Lord.

Thus, the Celestial Mystery sounded its rhythm; the mold of virtue responded to the true. He was entrusted with the transformation of the upper realms, governing the Nine Heavens, overseeing all under Heaven, and universally leading the ten thousand immortals. The registers of life and death—nothing, however minute, escaped his purview.

The Lord’s virtue was lofty, his Dao complete. He roamed the Jade Clarity, serene and luminous. The Seven Primes shone and scattered; the Five Elders attended his spirit. The Three Luminants flanked his radiance; the Nine Thearchs aligned their chariots. Flying mists formed a purple canopy; dark clouds arose in the void. Jade maidens raised their voices; the divine net resounded. Dragons intoned; phoenixes sang. The vast court swelled with celestial music. Auroras encircled the sun; flowing lightning quickened essence. Radiant lights intermingled; divine candles merged their brilliance. Alone, he wielded the tally of the numinous writ, his hand brandishing the banner to command demonic spirits. He wandered the Purple Clouds’ palace, lingered in the Azure Florescence’s chambers. He overawed the Six Heavens with his advent; he severed the myriad spirits from their hordes of malevolence. He gathered the later disciples upon golden tablets, collated the azure registers from all directions. He summoned the ten thousand thearchs to the winding script, expounded the precious formulas in the wondrous chapters. He unfolded the Nine Mysteries through the kalpas, unraveled the arcane to enlighten the benighted. He composed the *Standing Alone* to equal the perfected; he enforced the Four Poles to restrain transgressions. He commanded the Four Offices to execute punishments, empowered the Five Thearchs to correct wrongs. Universally, he governed the boundless. The Four Quarters, the Six Realms, the Five Peaks, and the famed mountains—myriad billions of perfected beings—all submitted to the Azure Palace and served the Upper Minister.

Such a treasure writ is the Supreme One’s chapter of mysterious emptiness, naturally formed. It gathers the soaring dark-purple *qi* into hidden writ, releasing the thirty-six tones of the Outer Realms’ grades. It establishes the Six Realms within the offices of the Five Elders, to be practiced by those of the Dao who fly as immortals. The jade tones are crystalline and clear; the wondrous meanings are subtle and profound. All manifest the rhythms of the Supreme August and the Primordial Mystery. The Four Convergences and Eight Reaches intertwine to form its sounds. Its true purport is difficult to fathom; its principles are hard to trace. Unless one is of the purple womb’s woven network, the jade treasury’s unobstructed freshness, and the nine apertures’ receptivity to the numinous, one cannot grasp its subtle rhythms or penetrate its jade tones.

The Supreme One guarded this secret closely. Thus, it was transmitted mouth to mouth. The Nine Heavens appointed the Left Assistant to hold the tally in the Immortal Capital. To the right, they placed the Jade Gentlemen Attendants and the Five Directions’ Numinous Officials—fifty thousand each—to safeguard the treasure writ. Jade lads and maidens held towels and attended incense. Dark numinous purple canopies scattered mist through the distant court. The assembled perfected shone brilliantly in Upper Clarity.

Thus, the Supreme Jade Emperor and all the sagely beings, on the eight seasonal days, ascend the jasper chambers to perform rites and chant the tones. The jade echoes ring clear, shaking the Nine Heavens.

On the day this writ is inscribed, the Five Stars emerge from their lodgings; the Seven Primes halt their radiance. The Five Thearchs float in their positions; the ten thousand immortals attend the court. A thousand demons lose their sight; hordes of devils extinguish their essence. His might subdues the Six Realms; countless domains are pacified. The divine and wondrous transformations defy description. Its gaze flows through a hundred million kalpas without fading; the great transformation renews itself ever anew. Its numinous excellence is towering and majestic, beyond naming.

Whoever possesses this scripture has had their name inscribed in the imperial registers before their birth, destined to emerge as an immortal. Some celestial perfected descend to bestow this writ; others, through worldly karmic conditions, encounter a scripture master. Dreams echo with numinous responses; their spirit merges with the true. Having received the jade tones, one should burn incense in a secluded chamber, perform rites, and cultivate practice. Chanting it once summons the ten thousand perfected to gather; the Five Elders attend in form. Heavenly demons bow their heads; a thousand demons lose their essence. His might shakes the Six Realms; he summons immortals and draws the perfected near.

After nine years, the Three Primes ascend to the celestial chambers, descending in cloud-borne chariots to soar through the Upper Clarity. Even if one possesses this scripture yet fails to cultivate its practice in the world, merely revering it with sincere devotion will summon twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to attend and guard one’s person, warding off the ten thousand calamities. They subdue weapons of war, and the thousand afflictions and myriad harms dare not rashly intrude. The Five Emperors stand guard, enabling one to attain the rank of lesser immortal. Alternatively, one may undergo bodily transformation and cyclic rebirth, ascending into the numinous chambers—though one may not yet assume office in the Jade Void or wander among the Three Clarities.

**Thirty-Six Celestial Registers of the Six Realms**

The Five Directions of Heaven and Earth each possess governing hues of hardness and softness, preventing their dissolution. The earth extends twenty billion miles deep, where it receives moisture; beneath this moisture lies another twenty billion miles of golden millet marsh; below that, twenty billion miles of adamantine iron marsh; deeper still, twenty billion miles of watery marsh; descending eighty billion miles further, one reaches the great wind marsh; and five hundred twenty billion miles beyond that, the cosmic net sustains Heaven and Earth, ensuring they do not collapse—just as the sun, moon, and stars are upheld by the wind. Scholars who remain ignorant of the depths and hues beneath the earth will find the Five Emperors unable to extend their protection beyond the borders of foreign lands.

**Eastern Realm: The Land of Fuyudai**
Beyond ninety thousand miles to the easternmost extremity lies the Wasteland of Haolin, where the kingdom of Heluoti resides. Its land is perfectly round, its soil as fresh as azure rouge, devoid of mountains or hills, spanning nine hundred thousand miles in breadth. The people of this land stand two *zhang* tall and live four hundred years. The kingdom possesses six celestial registers, which the Supreme Highest established among the foreign Hu elders. The Supreme Highest often chants these registers to transform the Hu elders, revealing to them the teachings of immortality in foreign lands. If the people of this land observe rites and recite these registers, they attain a lifespan of four hundred years, free from premature death. Scholars who study the hues of foreign lands and constantly chant the six registers will summon the immortal officials of the Hu elders to guard their persons. After nine years, they naturally gain passage to the land of Heluoti, converse with the Hu elders, transform their bodies to fly through the air, and wander the easternmost realms.

**The Six Registers of the Eastern Land of Heluoti:**
1. First Register: *Chan Ayiti Nawei*
2. Second Register: *Yue Jia Moxu Yunchi*
3. Third Register: *Tan Zhen Shizhe Yuantuo*
4. Fourth Register: *Gao Bojun Yun Wuzi*
5. Fifth Register: *Xi Jin Lingfa Poyi*
6. Sixth Register: *Sheliding Quni Tai*

In the land of Heluoti, the six registers are disseminated, and the titles of the Hu elders are established. Those who master them attain a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. By cultivating this Way, one summons the immortal officials of foreign lands to guard one’s person. On the days of the Great Year Star, one’s natal star, and the eight solar terms, one should inscribe the six registers in azure ink, recite them once while facing east, and knock the teeth nine times. Chant the six registers six times each, then close the eyes, compose the body, and settle the spirit. Abandon all stray thoughts and visualize the boundless eastern realm, the land of Heluoti, clearly and vividly. Envision countless Hu elder immortal officials arriving to pay homage, reciting the foreign registers. Then softly intone the prayer:

*"The bounds of Heaven and Earth unfold,
Eight directions shine in clarity,
Vast and boundless insight,
The names of foreign lands,
Celestial registers transform through sound,
Qi coalesces into spirit,
Summoning immortals and drawing the perfected near,
Myriad hosts gather as one,
Tracing the subtle and profound,
Mirroring the formless,
Above and below resound in harmony,
Within and without grow solemn and pure,
Azure mists and flying wheels
Come to aid my form,
Bearing me aloft,
To the northern audience in the Jade Capital."*

Conclude by swallowing the qi nine times. This is the supreme method of the celestial registers of foreign lands, a practice of divine immortals. After nine years of cultivation, one summons immortal officials, gains spiritual insight into the subtle, communicates with the divine, and ascends into the void to rise to Heaven in broad daylight.

**Southern Realm: The Land of Yanfuli**
Beyond three hundred thousand miles to the southernmost extremity lies the Radiant Yang Wilderness, where the kingdom of Yishata resides. Its land is vast and level, without elevation or depression, its soil crimson, spanning eight hundred ten thousand miles in breadth. The people of this land stand two *zhang* and four *chi* tall and live three hundred sixty years. The kingdom possesses six celestial registers, which the Supreme Highest established among the foreign Yue elders. The Supreme Highest often chants these registers to transform the Yue elders, revealing to them the teachings of immortality in their land. If the people of this land observe rites and recite these registers, they attain a lifespan of three hundred sixty years, free from premature death. Scholars who study the hues of foreign lands and constantly chant the six registers will summon the immortal officials to guard their persons. After nine years, they naturally gain passage to the land of Yishata, converse with the Yue elders, transform their bodies within the vermilion palace, and soar through the southern yang realms.

**The Six Registers of the Southern Land of Yishata:**
1. First Register: *Nan Weina Xihan Luo*
2. Second Register: *Huan Molan Yulan Bo*
3. Third Register: *Le Feng Le Yuming Sha*
4. Fourth Register: *Hui Su Jie Qi Feituo*
5. Fifth Register: *Gen Zhi Sui Bai Wuhe*
6. Sixth Register: *Ying Chong Du Xuan Jingche*

In the land of Yishata, the six registers are disseminated, and the titles of the Yue elders are established. Those who master them attain a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. By cultivating this Way, one summons the flying immortal officials of foreign lands to guard one’s person. On the days of the Great Year Star, one’s natal star, and the eight solar terms, inscribe the six registers in vermilion ink, enter a chamber, face south, and recite them. Knock the teeth nine times and chant the six registers six times each.

When finished, close the eyes to settle the spirit and stabilize the qi, casting aside all stray thoughts. Visualize the boundless, infinite realm of the southern direction, its clarity and luminosity fully revealed. Envision the countless Yue elders and immortal officials arriving to attend one’s person. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Lofty numina descend their radiance,
Scattering transformation through the Vermilion Palace.
The flowing tones of the six registers
Congeal into a cinnabar countenance.
Hosts of immortals arrive in audience,
Paired with the true mandate in duality.
Penetrating vision of the Eight Luminaries,
Eyes behold the Flowering Chamber.
Divided effulgences ascend to the Upper Clarity,
Emerging from azure, entering into yellow.
Five-hued streaming essences
Become my luminous light.
I roam the Six Lands,
Ascend to the Jade Hall,
Receive the immortal Dharma robes,
Fly in azure feathered garments,
Girded with flowing gold and intertwining sashes,
Adorned with phoenix-script purple insignia.
Attaining unity with the Emperor in truth,
My form shines in the Jade Capital."*

When finished, swallow the qi nine times and cease.

Practicing this for nine years will summon the Yue elders and immortal officials of the southern lands to guard and attend one’s form. They will perceive the hidden and fathom the void, conversing with the spirits. Flying clouds and dark dragons will descend to welcome the adept.

Disseminating the registers, fasting in qi,
The Six Lands establish their names.
The Qiang elders, ever pure,
Receive the Dharma’s transformation and numinous power.
Exalted immortals command the mandate—
I am endowed with formlessness.
Qi flows in tandem,
Penetrating the Eight Darknesses.
Flying immortals arrive in audience,
Lush and misty in the Purple Court.
Cloud chariots and feathered canopies,
Verdant mists and cinnabar chariots,
Convey me upward
To ascend to the Jade Clarity."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi nine times and cease. Practicing this for nine years will summon the Qiang elders and immortal officials of the northern direction to guard one’s person, allowing one to trace the obscure and fathom the yet-unseen, commune with the perfected and attain numinous power, soar through the mysterious void, and ascend to the Purple Dawn. Above the Nine Heavens of the upper direction, within the clear yang and empty space, where there is no color, no form, no shape, no shadow—there lies the realm of the primordial essence and the naturally arising Azure Chaos, where azure qi serves as the fragrance of the world. Boundless above, it covers the four directions of all heavens, forming the root from which the Most High Jade Emperor and the myriad sage emperors and perfected beings receive life. Without age, without limit, only kalpas serve as years. Within this empty void, there are also the Six Resonances, established by the Primordial Beginning as the natural ranks of the Perfected Emperor. The Most High intones and chants these sounds to extend the lives of the host of immortals, allowing them to know that the mysterious void holds boundless perfected beings. As the Jade Emperor and the ten thousand emperors of that realm all pay homage and chant these sounds, they attain limitless longevity. Those who study and know the color of the empty void, practicing through intoning and recitation, will summon the descent of the Three Origins, with the Five Emperors visiting their chamber to bestow upon them the numinous sounds. After nine years, they will be able to ride the void and mount the floating clouds, ascending to the Great Void of Jade Clarity.

The realm of the naturally arising Azure Chaos of the primordial essence in the upper direction:
First Rank Resonance, sounding: *Qiongyao Fenlu Dingyin*.
Second Rank Resonance, sounding: *Fengyun Landan Baolin*.
Third Rank Resonance, sounding: *Yaoliang Guangdong Zisen*.
Fourth Rank Resonance, sounding: *Yuannai Jingru Kongqiong*.
Fifth Rank Resonance, sounding: *He’a Fangbihu Ping*.
Sixth Rank Resonance, sounding: *Qiyao Qi Fei Yuanqing*.

The realm of the naturally arising Azure Chaos of the primordial essence emits the Six Ranks of Resonance to mark the truth of the Jade Emperor of Supreme Clarity. Those who know these sounds will soar through the Jade Void, and the myriad immortals will come to pay homage. On the days of one’s original destiny, the year-star, and the eight solar terms, inscribe the Six Ranks of Resonance in azure script, enter the chamber, face the year-star, and ingest them. Knock the teeth nine times and intone the Six Resonances six times each. Upon completion, close the eyes, calm the spirit, settle the will, and cast aside all thoughts. Visualize the boundless Supreme Clarity of the uppermost clear yang and empty space, where there is no color, no form, no shape, no shadow—only the luminous clarity of the empty void, suffused with dense azure qi descending to crown one’s person. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Primordial Beginning, naturally arising,
Azure yang dense and dark,
Mysterious transformation of the empty void,
Boundless and formless,
Congealing qi to form the realm,
Fragrant world as its name,
Encompassing all heavens,
Universally nurturing the ten thousand spirits.
Cloud chambers and golden nets,
Towering in Supreme Clarity,
The Six Ranks emit their positions,
Inscribing the primordial essence.
Jade sounds penetrate the subtle,
Mysterious echoes resound in clarity.
Intoning and chanting issue forth,
The Perfected Emperors descend to the court.
Curved reflections hang like trailing branches—
I partake of the supreme numen,
Equal in rank to Heaven,
The Three Luminaries unite in brightness,
Forever preserving the Great Void,
Unshaken through the kalpas."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi nine times and cease. Practicing this for nine years will cause the Three Origins to descend and bestow the true sounds upon one, granting a flying auroral cinnabar chariot to one’s person, allowing flight through the Great Void and ascent to Jade Clarity. This is a most exalted and secret method, recorded in the nameless golden texts and the azure characters of Supreme Clarity. It must not be practiced without authorization. Those who recklessly transmit it to others will bring calamity upon their seven generations, incur punishment from the Three Officials, forfeit their own lives, and lose all hope of immortality. Adhere strictly to the regulations and guard this knowledge with care.

Beneath the central lands lies the vast Windy Marsh, extending five hundred twenty billion miles from the earth. The firm axis of the earth’s roots governs it, preventing its fall. The soil there is the color of golden essence. The resonance of the central lands is called the realm of the Treasured Perfection of Great Harmony and Boundless Life. Mount Kunlun of the central peaks stands at its center, bearing the alternate names of all heavens. Above it lies the Seven Jeweled Pearl Palace of the Dark Garden, where the ends of heaven meet, serving as the abode of the perfected and flying immortals. The central lands span one hundred twenty billion miles in circumference. The people there are nine feet tall, all practicing the arts of guiding and pulling, and live for one thousand two hundred years. The land possesses the Six Resonances, established by the Most High as the ranks of the central lands. The Jade Emperor and the Most High intone and chant these sounds to transform the Qiang elders of the central lands, allowing them to know that their realm holds the teachings of deathlessness. If the people of that land all cultivate the Dao of Supreme Clarity, practicing rites and recitations, they will live for one thousand two hundred years, free from untimely death. Those who study and know the earth’s color of the central lands, practicing through intoning and recitation, will have the Qiang elder immortal officials guard their persons. After nine years, they will naturally converse with the Qiang elders, ascend to the Great Void, and soar to Supreme Clarity.

The realm of the Treasured Perfection of Great Harmony and Boundless Life:
First Rank Resonance, sounding: *Dingshi Yinjie Ronghe*.
Second Rank Resonance, sounding: *Zhongbao Zhu Ruolaihua*.
Third Rank Resonance, sounding: *Guangyuan Yuanli Yun’a*.
Fourth Rank Resonance, sounding: *Tiaoqiong Fen Jin Shiluo*.
Fifth Rank Resonance, sounding: *Dongling Yin Jieshi Tuo*.
Sixth Rank Resonance, sounding: *Jingen Bao Zhuyang Po*.

The realm of the Treasured Perfection of Great Harmony and Boundless Life emits the Six Ranks of Resonance to establish the titles of the Qiang elders. Those who know these sounds will live as long as heaven and earth. Practicing this Dao will summon the Qiang elder immortal officials to pay homage to one’s person. On the days of the year-star, one’s original destiny, and the eight solar terms, inscribe the Six Ranks of Resonance in yellow script, enter the chamber, face one’s original destiny, and ingest them. Knock the teeth nine times and intone the sounds of the six lands six times each. Upon completion, close the eyes, calm the spirit, settle the will, and cast aside all thoughts. Visualize the vast Windy Marsh beneath the central lands, plunging five hundred twenty billion miles into the abyss, its clarity fully revealed. Envision the countless Qiang elder immortal officials arriving to attend one’s person. Then recite the prayer:

*"Central perfection, myriad emperors and mysterious numina,
The Nine Heavens bestow their canon,
Congealing qi and condensing essence,
Vast and yellow, the court of boundless fathoms.
The central lands emit their ranks,
Dividing the sounds into six names.
Jade faces the luminous void,
Penetrating the subtle and entering the azure.
Flowing perfection spreads forth,
Cultivating my form,
Transforming into Great Harmony,
Treasured perfection, advantageous and upright.
Below, it pierces the abyssal depths;
Above, it ascends to Jade Clarity."*

When finished, swallow the qi nine times and cease. Practicing this for nine years, the Perfected One descends to bestow upon the practitioner the true sounds, enabling converse with the Qiang elder immortal officials, riding the void to ascend to the Court of the Celestial Dawn. The Highest establishes the Six States’ ranked inscriptions, transforming them into thirty-six sounds. At the inception of the Primordial Beginning, the texts were inscribed in gold on tablets, each placed within a state, now all sealed within their borders or upon the sacred peaks of the Five Marchmounts. The sounds of the Central Lands, for instance, correspond to the northern face of the Jasper Orchard’s Piled Stones. These divine texts are each attended by three hundred Purple Aurora Jade Lads and Great Flower Jade Maidens, who serve and tend the incense.

By ancient decree, after ten thousand kalpas, they are transmitted to those of the highest Perfection. Without one’s name inscribed on the Emperor’s golden tablets or the Jade Clarity’s green script, one cannot receive these texts. Upon obtaining the Six States’ ranked sounds, one may wander boundlessly, traversing the Six States, ascending to Heaven or entering the abyss, transforming in myriad ways, treading the Five Marchmounts, and roaming the sacred peaks. Then the Hu, Yue, Di, Qiang, and Qiang elder immortal officials will escort and receive, all demons bow in submission, weapons and misfortune vanish, and one may roam the Six States at will. Reciting these ten thousand times, the Three Primes visit one’s chamber, descending with green chariots to ascend to the Jade Dawn.

These are the Highest’s spontaneous texts, the Prime Minister’s soaring mysterious purple qi script, written in realgar upon azure jade, worn upon the body to wander the Five Marchmounts, enter the Three Clarities, subdue the demonic hordes, command the myriad spirits, overawe the Six States, and subjugate the five weapons. Practicing this for nine years, the Perfected One visits one’s court, enabling flight through the void to ascend to the Great Clarity.

The Lad of the Azure Lads says: The Jade Perfected of the Celestial Emperor and the immortals of the Five Marchmounts all wear these texts and chant their sounds, bearing them upon their persons to cultivate Perfection. Without these texts, one cannot wander the sacred peaks, govern the Six States, repel weapons, or have the Five Elder Officials guard one’s form. The foundation of study lies in diligently traversing the Five Marchmounts to seek these texts, whereupon numinous might responds, and one naturally attains the Highest’s wondrous Daoist methods—even without study, one becomes immortal.

The Lad of the Azure Lads received the Highest’s texts for entering the Six States. Those who later study and wish to wander the sacred peaks, the Five Marchmounts, and the Six States, summoning the host of immortals, subduing the myriad demons, and subjugating the five weapons, must receive the Five Emperors’ texts of intersecting sounds. Wearing them for six years, one may converse with the Six States’ immortal officials and naturally comprehend the thirty-six states’ sounds.

The Yellow Emperor received the Hidden Primordial Three Lines, dominating the world, communing with the divine and luminous, commanding ghosts and spirits, and governing the myriad numina. Yu of Xia received the Three Lines of Intersecting Sounds, enabling the world’s ghosts and spirits to heed fortune and misfortune, know their past lives, and attain the ranks of numinous immortals. Zeng Xuan received the Three Lines of the Azure Grotto Text, aiding the Five Dragons and wandering the Cloud Palaces. An Yang received the Three Lines of the Nine Numinous Sounds, ascending the Emperor’s Hall and attaining the rank of Immortal King. Chi Jing received the Text of Treasured Perfection, ascending to the Four Poles and entering the Three Clarities. Wang Qiao received the Three Lines of the Primordial Womb’s Hidden Register, ascending to the ranks of the Highest Perfected and governing the host of immortals, entering and exiting the Flower Chambers.

The Highest, at the Golden Flower Palace of the Western Mound in the Jasper Orchard, transmitted the texts of the Numinous Assembly to the Prime Minister, the Lad of the Azure Lads.

The Highest’s Hidden Perfected Texts for Entering the Six States, transmitted to the Prime Minister, the Lad of the Azure Lads, written in realgar upon azure silk and worn upon the body, cause a precious radiance to arise from the nape, illuminating the Ten Heavens. They command thirty-six Jade Lads and thirty-six Jade Maidens, enabling one to wander the Five Marchmounts, traverse the sacred peaks, enter the Six States, tread the river sources, whereupon the host of immortals and the Five Directions’ officials all come to bow, the border sentinels welcome, the myriad demons are subdued, the thousand spirits are commanded, the Six States are overawed, the five weapons are subjugated, transformations are boundless, and one may follow one’s will. Descending green chariots of the cinnabar clouds come to receive one’s person, ascending to the Eastern Flower’s Azure Palace, attaining the rank of Prime Minister and governing the myriad Perfected.

The Dao is most exalted and wondrous, the August Lord’s precious writ. The Most High has now inscribed this writ in the script of men and birds, placing it within the cavern of Penglai, upon the northern slopes of the Accumulated Stones above the Dark Garden. The dark mystery of the feathered script and the radiant splendor of its luminous patterns intermingle, illuminating the vast heavens; purple mists layer in shadow, and the brilliance of its patterns shines with penetrating clarity. By ancient decree, after ten thousand kalpas one who is destined to transmit it shall have already become a Perfected. Whoever obtains this writ shall have their rank elevated to that of Immortal Minister, able to traverse the Six States, converse with the Five Elders, and penetrate the mysteries of the Dark Void. They shall command the myriad spirits, and even without jade bones, their name shall be engraved upon the purple tablets before their birth. Those who receive this writ, though they study not, shall still become Median Immortals. Should one lightly divulge this precious incantation, their seven ancestors shall bear the burden, hauling mountains and bearing stones for ten thousand kalpas without pardon. Their own person shall be bound and subjected to the trials of the world’s winds and blades, dying to enter hell, never again to attain immortality.

When wearing this writ to wander the Six States, tread the Five Marchmounts, and traverse the myriad sacred peaks, upon reaching the border of any realm, one must first strike the teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath for thirty-six cycles, and recite the incantation:

*"Jade Perfected, lingering in circuit,
Cloud chariots soar aloft.
This day is most auspicious,
Dragons ascend, phoenixes take flight.
Arrayed in feathered regalia,
The four paths open wide,
The six hosts set forth to guide,
The ten realms come to welcome.
Immortal lads bear banners,
Jade maidens scatter incense.
The Five Elders bow in reverence,
Majestic and resplendent,
Sun and moon intertwined in sash,
Divine immortals lend their aid.
Treading the Six States,
Traversing the four quarters,
The Four Waterways and Five Marchmounts
Become bridges for my passage.
By the August Lord’s command,
Sweep away all inauspiciousness.
Wherever I journey,
All shall be most propitious.
Wondrous and strange,
The immortal’s refinement flourishes within,
The foreign lands grow luminous without,
Ascending to the Jade Capital above."*

When finished, draw in the breath thirty-six times and cease. This is the mighty incantation of the Prime Minister’s excursions, by which one governs the Six States, subdues the myriad spirits, summons immortal officials to manifest, and performs boundless transformations, ascending to the Great Clarity.

The recipient must fast for seven days, or thirty days, and during the fast present thirty-two feet of azure-patterned silk, one golden fish, one jade dragon, nine pairs of golden rings, and five taels of gold as substitutes for the oath of cutting hair and tearing cloth. The master shall face north to proclaim the covenant and transmit the writ, while the disciple receives it with reverence, adhering to the statutes of the Four Poles, gathering in solemnity and restraint, guarding the precepts in secrecy and upholding them faithfully.

The Most High Clarity’s Jade Guardian, King of the Prime Minister and Grand Marshal, commands the Master of the Lofty Dawn, the Azure Lad of the Jade Gate of the Eastern Sea, to receive this from the Most High Jade Emperor and transmit it to the Perfected of the Four Poles. The Five Thearchs’ divine soldiers shall punish those who leak its secrets, break their covenant, or betray their oath: their seven ancestors shall bear the burden, their own person shall perish, enduring the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without pardon.

Here ends the *Upper Scroll of the Azure Lad’s Writ of the Outer Realms’ Ranks* of the Most High Clarity.
Here begins the *Lower Scroll of the Azure Lad’s Writ of the Outer Realms’ Ranks* of the Most High Clarity.

The *Inner Sounds of the Nine Mysteries and Thirty-Six Heavens of the Most High* and the *Inner Sounds of the Outer Realms’ Ranks of the Thirty-Six Heavens of the Cavernous Abyss and Nine Lands* originated before the Nine Mysteries of the Great Void. They coalesced from the soaring, mysterious purple qi as natural scriptures, their numinous writs dense in the layered skies, their true radiance resplendent in the Highest Clarity. Their divine marvels manifested in the Great Han, their jade tones ringing clear in the Golden Court. Whirling winds coursed through the purple mists, incense scattered across the Eight Darks. Cinnabar brilliance shone upon their jasper stems, the vermilion sun bathed the divine perfected. Through countless kalpas, they descended in emptiness from the mysterious void. The Three Primes initiated their motion, the Nine Cycles propelled their shifts. The numinous sounds appeared, inscribed upon Kunlun’s slopes, above the Jasper Gardens, and beneath the Accumulated Stones. Their radiant patterns cast forth splendor, their essence blazed toward the heavens. The sun and moon matched their light, the five stars shared their brilliance. The Four Convergences and Eight Reaches pierced through the Jade Clarity. Three hundred flying immortals and purple lads each attended the incense and awaited the numinous, girded with the beasts of the Jue Heaven, defended by myriad layers of golden heads. Nine-colored streaming clouds crowned their peaks, divine simurghs and vermilion phoenixes perched upon their pavilions. The Five Thearchs oversaw the perfected, the Four Poles governed the immortals. The Seven Luminaries exhaled their essence to refine and temper, jade blossoms scattered their truth to adorn the dust. Treading the yang’s decline without weariness, enduring ten thousand kalpas yet ever fresh.

On the first day of the third month of the first year of the Middle August Era, at the hour when Heavenly Virtue aligned, the Most High Clarity’s Jade Guardian, King of the Prime Minister and Grand Marshal, commanded the Master of the Lofty Dawn, the Azure Lad of the Jade Gate of the Eastern Sea, to purify himself in the Upper Palace for nine hundred days, to pledge alliance with the Azure and Gold Heavens, and to receive this from the Most High Jade Emperor. He traversed all heavens, penetratingly beheld the void, his gaze flowing across countless fordings. Above, he observed the boundless; at the center, he sported in the vast expanse. He circled the Six Lands, wound through the Nine Mysteries. The Four Offices examined and tested him, the Upper Prime fixed his immortal rank. The Jade Void cast its reflection, the Tortoise Mother descended with truth. The Eight Effulgences reined their steeds, the Five Elders flanked his chariot. Flying immortals raced one another, the Eight Winds played amidst the mists. Streaming lightning flashed with might, a hundred suns exhaled their essence. Jasper wheels illuminated the void, feathered canopies billowed in mystery. Golden lads scattered blossoms, jade maidens brushed away dust. The host of spirits bowed their heads, the Five Marchmounts paid homage to the perfected. The various heavens offered their rites, the ten directions’ overseers welcomed him. He governed the myriad Dao, universally oversaw the ten thousand immortals. His rank ascended to Prime Minister, he presided over the Lofty Dawn, truly by the wondrous decree of the Jade Emperor and the jade tones of the Thirty-Six Heavens. He controlled life and death in the registers, held the immortal titles in the Azure Palace, led the golden names in the mysterious records, and oversaw the white tablets in the jade chapters. Above, he governed the boundless, infinite, and inexhaustible; below, he oversaw the Cavernous Abyss, the Nine Lands, and the myriad spirits of the Five Marchmounts, Four Poles, rivers, and seas, along with the immortals of the Thirty-Six Lands—none were not subject to the Azure Lad.

By ancient statute, this was transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas, at the conjunction of the Nine and Five Cycles, when the Three Eras intersected. There were thirty-six names inscribed in the Emperor’s register. Those who beheld its writ and wore these sounds would erase their traces in the Nine Lands, be welcomed from afar by the Six Lands, and have their names recorded in the Thirty-Six Heavens. The Three Primes of the Upper Palace would descend, and they would naturally become immortals.

The mysterious canon encompassed the cavernous source, its numinous principles towering and beyond discourse. The jade depths were profound and unfathomable, its wondrous transformations too subtle to recount repeatedly. Here, but a thousandth part is briefly raised, a single truth coarsely marked from ten thousand marvels.

The *Inner Inscriptions of the Various Heavens* and the *Thirty-Six Sounds of the Nine Lands* coexisted with the Primordial Beginning, established their titles in the empty numinous, and wove their natural names to manifest in the Nine Mysteries, unfolding the Thirty-Six Sounds of the Outer Realms. Thus, heaven and earth each had thirty-six divisions: heaven had thirty-six Heavenly Kings to correspond to the thirty-six lands, and earth had thirty-six Earthly Sovereigns to correspond to the thirty-six heavens. The Heavenly Kings and true Earthly Sovereigns presided over the immortals. Those who studied yet did not know the Inner Sounds of Heaven would not have their names recorded by the Heavenly Kings; those who did not know the sounds of the earth below would not have their traces erased by the Earthly Sovereigns, and thus would remain barred from immortality.

Those who beheld its writ and received its oral instructions would have the Heavenly Kings’ mysterious scrutiny, the Seven Sages’ inscribed chapters, the Western Tortoise’s fixed register, and the Eastern Florescence’s recorded names. The Earthly Sovereigns would erase their corpses and obliterate their traces, the Nine Yin would recommend them to the Highest Clarity, the Five Numinous would reverently guard them, and the Ten Realms would support their ascent. They would circulate through the Six Lands, pacify and eliminate the multitude of evils, subdue the five weapons, and bind the heavenly demons. After nine years, they would ride the void and fly to the Highest Clarity.

The true Dao is lofty and wondrous; it must not be rashly proclaimed. Those who lightly divulge its sacred sounds shall have their seven ancestors burdened, their own persons perish, and endure the three paths and five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without pardon. Perfected adepts must heed the statutes and act accordingly.

The Heavenly Kings regularly, on the eight solar terms and the first days of each month, roam and observe the boundless, sport in the cloud chambers, and wander carefree in the Jade Clarity. Their gaze flows across the ten directions, and above the bright clouds, they constantly chant the *Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens* and the *Soaring Mystery’s Chapters* to celebrate the heavenly perfected, inwardly delighting their divine hearts. Jade tones resonate in emptiness, jasper melodies harmonize. On such days, the Five Elders rise from their seats, the Nine Thearchs attend their pavilions. The Four Offices examine and test, the Five Thearchs guard the numinous. The host of perfected sings in unison, the ten thousand immortals offer their ritual sounds. The Three Luminaries pause their brilliance, the Seven Primes blaze with light. Mountains and seas grow still, the various heavens grow solemn and clear. The Eight Primes scatter blossoms, the Four August Ones brush away dust. Numinous winds waft incense, green clouds exhale nectar. The heavenly origin dissolves its stagnation, the Jade Void contains its joy. In the bright and lofty halls of the Highest Clarity, amidst the vast and distant Great Desert, the cavernous void enters the subtle, and all-pervading scrutiny knows no end.

Those who attain this Dao and befriend the Thearch, diligently recite its chapters, shall have their ranks equated with the Immortal Kings, their virtue equated with the various heavens, and their lifespan equated with the Three Luminaries. All who study the Dao of the highest immortals, aspiring to ascend to the Jade Clarity and pay homage to the August Honored One, yet do not know the sounds of the Thirty-Six Heavens and the *Soaring Mystery’s Chapters*, shall not have their names recorded by the Thirty-Six Heavenly Kings. Their efforts shall be in vain, heaven shall not descend its truth, the Four Offices shall not revere them, the Five Thearchs shall not welcome them, and heavenly demons shall invade their truth. They shall never attain immortality.

Those who aspire to soar through the mysterious void and wander the Five Peaks, yet do not know the inner names of the Nine Earths and the Thirty-Six Earthly Thearchs, shall not have their corpse cast into the Nine Yin, nor their traces extinguished in the Nine Earths. Their toil in the hidden mountains shall be in vain, and their hopes of flight shall instead plunge them into the depths.

To practice this Dao, on each of the Eight Solar Terms and the first day of the lunar month, bathe in purity, maintain a fast, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Pay homage to the various heavens, face north, and knock the teeth thirty-six times. Softly intone the incantation:

*"Your servant, [Name], yearns for the divine immortals. On this day of eightfold felicity, I pay homage to the Heavenly Honored One. My highest wish is to ride the luminous essence, traverse the void, and drift upon the mist, to soar beyond the Jade Clarity and roam freely through the heavens. My middle wish is to transform my form, summon the Five Spirits, ascend through the Moon Gate, and drink from the Eight Steeds. May the Stone Radiance and Water Mother, the Jade Embryo and Flying Root, clothe me in the crimson sun, that I may abide in its light. My lowest wish is for the Four Poles to bestow upon me the sacred words, for the Western Florescence to guard me, and for the Golden Dawn to serve me. May I command the Five Elders and share the same chariot as the Eight Effulgences. May the upper and lower felicitations unite, and my five wishes be fulfilled. Grant that my desires be realized, my body harmonized with nature, and the true numina descend to confer upon me the rank of highest immortal."*

When finished, perform six bows and inhale six breaths while facing upward. Then turn west, perform six bows, and inhale six breaths. Finally, turn south, perform six bows, and inhale six breaths.

Next, turn east, perform six bows, and inhale six breaths; then turn northwest, perform six bows, and inhale six breaths; finally, turn southeast, perform six bows, and inhale six breaths. Having completed thirty-six bows in the six directions, the audience with the Thirty-Six Heavens is concluded. Return to face north and sit upright, then chant the "Chapter of the Flying Mystery of the Thirty-Six Heavens" once through. When finished, perform six bows again and inhale six breaths, and the rite is complete.

This is the supreme method of audience with the Thirty-Six Heavens. Practicing it for nine years will cause a cloud chariot to descend from heaven, and the Three Primes will attend your chamber. Your name will be inscribed in the Jade Purity, carved upon the azure tablets of the Green Palace. The Four Offices will distinguish you to the right, and the Ten Realms will reverently welcome you. You will ride the void and ascend to the Jade Dawn.

This method is most wondrous; it must not be rashly disclosed. To carelessly reveal its sacred texts will bring punishment upon seven generations of ancestors, consigning your body to the offices of ghosts and confining you eternally in the Three Prisons, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas.

Profound and serene, entwined with Brahma’s grace,

Essence bathes the jade-hued sky.
Phoenixes cry on peaks untrod,
Dragons startle in the Dao’s abode.
Golden tones resound afar,

Crimson hues adorn the patterned night.
Nine voids swift as racing smoke,
Eight winds scatter blossoms’ cloak.
Golden chariots with jade wheels spin,
Phoenix carriages whirl within.
Golden tones waft fragrant air,
Clouds in towering peaks repair.
Sweet nectars mingle, scatter wide,
Divine elixirs pour and glide.
Mystic valleys, jade springs flow,
Like rivers vast or boats that row.
The body merges with the natural state,
Eons pass—what weight or weight?
Lingering at the Golden Gate,
Feasting in the Radiant Emperor’s estate.
Eternally guard the Jade Void’s height,
Forever free from decline or blight.

Transcending beyond all bounds, traversing the manifold heavens,
Penetrating the formless, returning to my karmic origins.

Southward they cross floating Li, northward they descend to the Cold Palace.
Revolving truth through the four quarters, the Hall of Vast Numinosity,
Above they wield the numinous hymn, below they subdue demonic fiends.
Clouds soar through the profound mystery, four directions interconnect,
Mists of dawn spill forth essence, spreading across the great void.
Purple emptiness weaves mist, lingering in the cinnabar chamber,
Triple radiance illumines the cavern, the Seven Luminaries stream light.
The crimson sun flourishes in splendor, the verdant Brahma overflows,
Presiding over the sixteen stations, jade orchids bathe in fragrance.
The nine corners resound in unison, in meditation I am made king,
Mirroring the ten heavens, myriad immortals come to pay homage.
With luminous jasper tones, the mystery is perfected as the Immortal Duke,
Bound to the kalpa’s term, eternally preserved without end.

Aromas scatter across the Great Darkness,
Flying wheels and feathered canopies,
Ascend into formlessness,
Merge with qi in perfect union,
Ever tranquil in ultimate longevity.*

The Four Heavenly Kings, on the eight solar terms and the first day of each lunar month, together wander above the boundless, limitless, empty void of the Void-Ultimate Great Clarity, chanting the *Flying Mystery Chapter* of the Four Heavenly Sounds. On these days, they dispatch the Eight Numinous Immortals of the Central Perfected to traverse the world. Those who cultivate immortality, practice the Dao, pay homage to the various heavens, recite scriptures, and invoke goodness—these names are memorialized to the Heavenly Kings, their mysterious writings inscribed. Their lifespan aligns with the people of the Four Heavens, and after nine years of flight, they ascend to the Palace of Great Clarity.

The *Flying Mystery Chapter* of the Four Heavens states:
Dhāraṇī resounds, jade melodies arise in song,
Vermilion orchids gleam within,
Auspicious clouds unfurl their plumes,
Eight winds stir the essence,
Jasper tones drift afar,
Vast and distant, the structure soars,
Wings of the Great Empyrean spread,
Purple phoenixes luxuriate in the void,
Knotting elegance in layered depths,
Towering cloud-layers stretch,
Four directions and eight intersections meet,
Heavenly Elders and host-immortals,
Five Emperors witness the court,
The Jade Sovereign turns his numen,
Jasper chariots ride the green gales,
Four Origins guide the reins,
Six Masters steady the dragons,
Roaming and gazing through the Four Heavens,
Illuminating the nine distances,
Heavenly Perfected unfold their array,
Our joy is shared in unison,
Mysterious charts are inscribed on tablets,
Names recorded on purple markers,
To join the August Above,
Together preserving boundless eons,
Sun and moon in equal radiance,
Eternally abiding without decay.

The Flying Mystery Hymn of the Four Heavens states:
Jade mist surges vast,
Flying fragrance lush and dense,
Three blossoms radiate the sun,
Departing the cinnabar chambers of Li and Luo,
Golden smelting ten thousand fathoms,
Crimson clouds ninefold,
Floating jade buds unfurl,
Cavernous streams bathe the cold palace,
Jade immortals turn left,
Three heads interflow,
The August Supreme shines numinous,
Jade blossoms encircle the dragon,
Six reins transcend the void,
Roaming the great emptiness,
Holding covenant with the Eight Perfected,
Joining in joy with the Heavenly Kings,
Gaze flowing through the purple dawn,
Passing through kalpas without end,
Whistling and chanting jade and jasper,
Their harmonies overflowing,
Perpetual fast of the Nine Origins,
Dual luminaries shine as one,
Above transforming, below transmuting,
Seventy-four directions,
We bind our six sixes,
To pair with the Perfected as one.

The names of the thirty-six heavens within arise before the primordial qi of the Cavernous Void. Their literary splendor is inscribed upon Kunlun Mountain. The Highest Tones bear their jade script, the Supreme Ministers compile their wondrous chapters. They receive the natural hymns of the Great Emptiness, their titles emblazoned upon the Mysterious Chart. Above, they govern the Six Realms and the thirty-six sounds; below, they oversee the Nine Lands and the thirty-six Earthly Sovereigns. The numinous chapters flow unimpeded, their jade wisdom fresh and void-bright—all are the roaming songs of the Heavenly Kings, the treasured hymns of the Empty Mystery. Six sixes harmonize in rhyme, four fours align in perfection. The Nine Emperors divide the titles of the thirty-six heavens, myriad qi are wholly subordinate, universally leading the host of immortals. Above, they reach the boundless formless; below, they penetrate the cavernous sources and abysses. All who would become Supreme Perfected and Flying Immortals—without receiving the Jade Sounds, they may not roam and observe the boundless heavens. Those who obtain these texts have their names inscribed by the Heavenly Kings on purple tablets, recorded in the Jade Dawn Register. After thirty-six years, they may ascend to the formless heavens above and penetrate the sources of the Nine Lands below.

The Supreme Mystery Dao is not transmitted to lesser immortals. To recklessly divulge the treasured sounds is to incur the punishment of seven generations, to bear the knife mountain, to endure the three calamities and five sufferings, for ten thousand kalpas without redemption.

I attain the status of superior immortal.
Flying through the Great Void,
soaring effulgences move naturally.
In harmony with the numinous,
in unity with qi, eternally abiding.
Three transformations, nine transmutations,
ascending into the Emperor’s dawn.

Upon completion, bow four times in the heart and swallow qi four times to conclude. Practicing this for thirty-six years, one attains the dark cloud chariot and ascends to the *Kāmadhātu* Heaven of Brahma. The ninth stratum of the Abyssal Cavern, the Formless Rigid Axis of Earth Qi’s true tone—
the Earth Sovereign’s surname is *Ji*, personal name *Wu Shang Xuan*.
The ninth stratum of the Abyssal Cavern, the Formless Rigid Axis of Earth Qi’s moving tone—
the Earth Sovereign’s surname is *Sheng*, personal name *Xu Yuan Hao*.
The ninth stratum of the Abyssal Cavern, the Formless Rigid Axis of Earth Qi’s roaming tone—
the Earth Sovereign’s surname is *Zhao*, personal name *Shang Bo Xuan*.
The ninth stratum of the Abyssal Cavern, the Formless Rigid Axis of Earth Qi’s Brahma tone—
the Earth Sovereign’s surname is *Nong*, personal name *Le Yuan Bo*.

To the right: the nine strata of the earth’s ultimate depths, the Abyssal Cavern’s source, the Rigid Axis of Heaven and Earth, governs so that one does not fall. Above, it is five hundred twenty billion *li* from the first stratum; below, it is boundless, without end or border, all pervaded by the qi of the Rigid Axis. The Earth Sovereigns of the ninth stratum, on the first day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the third day of the ninth month, and the fourth day of the twelfth month—four times a year—ride a five-colored cloud chariot, nine-colored flying dragons bearing the writ of the Central Origin’s life-spirit, accompanied by the Elder Immortal Officials, a radiant heavenly host of twelve thousand feathered riders, ascending to the *Pāriyātraka* Heaven to report the names of those who have attained immortality through the nine earths’ Dao. For those studying the superior method, on these days enter the chamber, face the Grand Year Star, inscribe in yellow on white paper the inner tones of the four Earth Sovereigns and wear them, strike the teeth twelve times, and visualize the surnames and personal names of the four Earth Sovereigns, all clad in dark and yellow five-colored robes, heads crowned with the Nine Origins Heaven-Penetrating Treasure Coronet, feet shod in five-colored slippers woven with lion patterns, bearing the life-preserving talisman of the tattooed body, riding a yellow auroral flying chariot, accompanied by thirty-six Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs, flying upward to ascend to the *Pāriyātraka* Heaven. Then recite the incantation:

The Two Images revolve in cycles,
the Nine Essences penetrate the numinous.
The Elder Thearchs respond to the tally,
soaring through the void to enter clarity.
Fourfold connections, eightfold thoroughfares,
flying auroras and purple jades.
Ascending to the Golden Flower,
paying homage before the Emperor’s numen.
Inscribed in the immortal register,
names carved in the Azure Palace.
Attaining the Dao’s white writ,
sealed with the seven numina.
The nine strata extinguish the corpse,
the Eastern Well refines the form.
The Three Origins descend the perfected,
my Dao is now luminous.
I attain the flying effulgence,
ascending to the Jade Court.

Upon completion, bow nine times in the heart and swallow qi twelve times to conclude. Practicing this for thirty-six years, one attains the yellow auroral flying chariot and ascends to the *Pāriyātraka* Heaven. The nine earths and nine strata descend ninefold, corresponding to thirty-six tones and thirty-six Earth Sovereigns, aligning above with the thirty-six heavens and at the center with the thirty-six states. These Earth Sovereigns all hold ranks equal to the Jade Emperor’s title, differing only in the division of qi they govern and the distinctions of their names above and below. Every thirty-six years, the Earth Sovereigns transform their titles, ascending to the Upper Clarity Palace to inherit the rulership of the thirty-six heavens. The officials of the Jade Bureau, beneath the nine strata, all report the names of those who have attained immortality through the Dao to the Nine Heavens’ Heavenly Kings. Those who study without knowing the inner names of the nine strata’ earth tones and thirty-six Earth Sovereigns will not have their traces extinguished in the nine earths; the Nine Heavens’ Chancellor will not accept their names, the Five Marchmounts will not descend cloud chariots, the Five Thearchs will not protect their bodies, and though they may master foreign tones, they will not ascend through the empty void.

Thus, Heaven, Earth, and Human each receive the qi of the three threes, and only when the three unite as the perfected can one attain immortality. Those who know the inner names of the nine earths’ tones and thirty-six Earth Sovereigns will have the Nine Qi Elder constantly guarded by four directions’ five-colored numinous officials, protecting their bodies in all movements, ascending and traversing the Five Marchmounts. Immortal officials will attend and escort them, dispelling demonic trials, summoning divine perfected beings, flying through the void in nine years, sitting in disappearance and standing in vanishing. In thirty years, they will ascend to the Great Clarity. Those who possess this text in the world will have the Seven Mysteries’ Ancestor serve as the Nine Qi Life-Spirit Earth Sovereign’s official, safeguarding their forms, comforting their souls, and driving away the *Hao Li* elders and Earth Chancellor’s karmic entanglements, freeing them from confinement, punishment, and servitude. Dwelling in the world, they will be secure and free from misfortune; the twelve guardian generals will encamp and defend the eight gates, connecting with the perfected and summoning the divine. They may become wealthy if they wish, attain office if they wish, become immortals if they wish, or become divine if they wish.

This Dao is secret and wondrous, not to be idly spoken of. The Highest Oral Instructions and Precious Scrolls of the Upper Minister Azure Lad are transmitted only to those who receive them. Recklessly divulging the numinous text will condemn one’s seven ancestors to servitude, irredeemable for ten thousand kalpas. When ascending mountains to dwell or settling in a residence, to discern the land’s auspiciousness or inauspiciousness, on a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe in yellow the thirty-six earth tones of the nine strata on white paper and place it at the center of the dwelling, covering it with a basin. After three nights, uncover and examine it: if the paper is moist and yellow, it is greatly auspicious; if it is green, there are dead spirits’ corpses below; if it is white, it is inauspicious.

If the color appears red, there will be fright and terror; if black, there will be treasures; if purple, one will attain immortality as a divine transcendent. If none of these colors differ, then cease further inquiry—one may dwell in peace for three years, but beyond this, misfortune and harm will surely follow.

**The Six True Tones of the Highest Outer Realms**

**The Land of Heluoti in the East:**
First Inscription: The true tone is *Wu Yi*.
Second Inscription: The true tone is *Boni*.
Third Inscription: The true tone is *Jiu Nan*.
Fourth Inscription: The true tone is *Ji Wei*.
Fifth Inscription: The true tone is *Wu Si*.
Sixth Inscription: The true tone is *Yun Zhi*.

Beyond nine hundred thousand *li* east of the Middle Kingdom lies the Land of Heluoti, also called the Star Realm. Beyond its borders stands Fusang, amid the Azure Sea, spanning ten thousand *li*. Atop it stands the Palace of the Supreme Emperor, a secondary abode of the Perfected True King. There grows an upper-born forest resembling mulberry trees, each towering thousands of *zhang*, the largest three thousand *wei* in girth. They grow in pairs from the same root, bearing crimson fruit like mulberries, which immortals consume. Their bodies take on a golden radiance, and their fruit ripens but once every nine thousand years.

Further out lies Shengzhou, beyond Fusang, bordering Penglai to the west. Its land spans two thousand five hundred *li*, twenty-three thousand *li* from shore, and is home to tens of thousands of immortals. The land knows no cold or heat, its climate ever temperate, and abounds with divine transcendent herbs. Those who consume them may soar through the air.

East of Fusang lies Zuzhou, amid the Eastern Sea, spanning five hundred *li*, seven thousand *li* from shore. Upon it grows the herb of immortality, resembling wild rice shoots, three to four *chi* in length, also called the *Yangshen Zhi* (Nurturing-Spirit Mushroom). Its leaves resemble those of wild rice, growing not in clusters but singly. One who consumes a single stalk may ascend to the Upper Clarity in flight. Even the dead may be revived if covered with it—truly a wondrous and divine medicine. Those who enter this land must know its name. By meditating upon the immortal official Hu Lao and gathering the herb from Zuzhou, visualizing its color and ingesting it, after three years one’s face will radiate flowing light, and life will extend for ten thousand years. Over time, immortals will naturally bestow this divine substance, delivering it to the practitioner.

**The Land of Yishatuo in the South:**
First Inscription: The true tone is *Ying Hua*.
Second Inscription: The true tone is *Wang Jia*.
Third Inscription: The true tone is *Wo Mo*.
Fourth Inscription: The true tone is *Yao Pa*.
Fifth Inscription: The true tone is *Wu Du*.
Sixth Inscription: The true tone is *Fei Pu*.

Beyond eighty-one thousand *li* south of the Middle Kingdom lies the farthest reaches of Jambudvīpa, the wilds of Dongyang, the Land of Yishatuo, also called the Celestial Fire Court of Tianzhu. Beyond its borders lies Changzhou, also called Qingqiu, in the southern sea of Chen and Si, spanning five thousand *li*, twenty-five thousand *li* from shore. There grow great trees, three thousand *zhang* tall and two thousand *wei* in girth, abundant with divine medicines, sweet nectar, and jade blossoms—nothing is lacking. Its inhabitants live for three hundred and sixty years. There are also spirit foxes, as large as dogs, their fur in five colors. Their cries resound for four thousand *li*, and their majesty subdues tigers, leopards, and all beasts. Those who wear their fur live as long as heaven and earth.

To the left stands Wind Mountain, where constant rumbling echoes. Atop it lies the Purple Mansion Palace, where divine transcendent jade maidens wander and observe. Further lies Yanzhou, at the center of the Southern Sea, spanning two thousand *li*, nine thousand *li* from shore. Upon it dwells the Wind-Born Beast, resembling a leopard, blue in color, and as large as a wildcat. Its body blazes with fire that reaches the heavens, burning for months without dying, its fur unscorched. Blades cannot pierce it, and only after striking its head thousands of times with an iron hammer does it perish. If it opens its mouth to the wind, it revives in moments. Plugging its nostrils with *shi shang changpu* (stone-surface calamus) kills it. Taking its brain and mixing it with chrysanthemum blossoms to consume grants life as enduring as heaven and earth.

There is also Fire Forest Mountain, where the Fire-Light Beast dwells, as large as a rat, its fur three to four *cun* long, either red or white. Gazing at the mountain’s forests and these beasts at midnight, their light shines like burning flames. Weaving their fur into cloth produces *huohuan bu* (fire-washed cloth). If slightly soiled, burning it restores its freshness. The people of Yishatuo wear this cloth, and immortals descend in its likeness. Scholars who meditate upon the land’s tones and contemplate the immortal official Yue Lao for thirty-six years will have divine beings present these beasts and other wondrous treasures of the land to them.

**The Land of Niweiluolüna in the West:**
First Inscription: The true tone is *Hua Lian*.
Second Inscription: The tone is *Ri Gao Xuan*.
Third Inscription: The tone is *Ri Ming Shen*.
Fourth Inscription: The tone is *Ri Tu Chan*.
Fifth Inscription: The tone is *Ri Xing Zhen*.
Sixth Inscription: The tone is *Ri Zhu Tian*.

Beyond sixty thousand *li* west of the Middle Kingdom lies the farthest reaches of Juxieni, the bleak and frigid wilds of Haosu, the Land of Niweiluolüna, also called the Cloud Barbarian Moon-Branch Land. Its people live for six hundred years. Beyond its borders lies Liuzhou, in the southern part of the Western Sea, spanning three thousand *li*, nineteen thousand *li* from the eastern shore, home to tens of thousands of immortals. Upon it stands a mountain where *kunwu* stone is found. Forged into iron and crafted into swords, their brilliance illuminates caves like crystal, cutting jade as easily as earth.

Fenglínzhou lies at the sea’s center, spanning one thousand five hundred *li*, surrounded by weak waters where even goose feathers cannot float. It is home to thousands of immortals and flocks of phoenixes and qilin. There dwells the Ji Guang Beast, resembling a wildcat, capable of human speech, its voice like Sanskrit chanting. It communicates with the land’s people, its fur radiant with light, worn only by immortals.

Obtaining its fur grants life as enduring as heaven and earth. Those who master the land’s speech shall, after thirty-six years as an elder immortal official, present the *kunwu* sword and the Ji Guang Beast to the Supreme One.

**The Land of Xunta Luo in the North**

**Second Inscription:** Sounds as "Wenduo."
**Third Inscription:** Sounds as "Shanlu."
**Fourth Inscription:** Sounds as "Wudu."
**Fifth Inscription:** Sounds as "Yingjia."
**Sixth Inscription:** Sounds as "Xuanmo."

Five hundred thousand *li* north of the Middle Kingdom lies the extreme of the northern darkness, the court of the Celestial Curtain—known as the Land of Xunta Luo, or the Land of the Heavenly Mirror. Its people live three hundred years. Beyond its borders lies Xuanzhou, spanning seven thousand two hundred *li*, surrounded by seas thirty-six thousand *li* from shore. Above stands the Great Mysterious Capital, governed by the Immortal Lord Zhen Gong. There dwells the Longevity Mandarin Duck, resembling floating mist. Many hills rise there, called Wind Mountain, which borders the northwestern gate of heaven. Its halls and chambers are of gold and jade, yielding golden jade and purple lingzhi, governed by the Three Heavens.

Beyond it lies Yuanzhou, spanning three thousand *li*, ten thousand *li* from its southern shore. There grow the Five Lingzhi of the Mysterious Gorge, whose waters flow like honey. Drinking them grants life equal to heaven and earth. Thirty thousand immortals dwell there, all drinking this water to attain deathless transcendence. Those who master the land’s speech shall, after thirty-six years as an elder immortal official, offer the Five Lingzhi Water of the Mysterious Gorge.

**The Land of Primordial Essence and Pristine Chaos in the Upper Realm**
**First Inscription:** True sound, "Chonghuan."
**Second Inscription:** True sound, "Yujin."
**Third Inscription:** True sound, "Sanlin."
**Fourth Inscription:** True sound, "Zhengjing."
**Fifth Inscription:** True sound, "Xiqin."
**Sixth Inscription:** True sound, "Lüying."

Above the Nine Heavens, within the vast emptiness of pure yang, where form and shadow dissolve into the void—there lies the Land of Primordial Essence and Pristine Chaos, also called the Land of the Abyssal Azure Expanse. It is a world perfumed by pure *qi*, boundless above, covering all heavens below. Only the Jade Void and Purple Pavilion weave mist through the hollow emptiness, nestled within the Pristine Azure Chaos. Those who master the loftiest celestial speech shall receive from the heavens the method of ascending as a flying immortal.

**The Land of Supreme Harmony and Boundless Treasure Truth in the Central Realm**

The Middle Kingdom spans one hundred twenty million *li* in circumference, its depths reaching the Great Wind Marsh five hundred twenty million *li* across. At its center stands Kunlun, encircled by weak waters. The mountain rises thirty-six thousand *li* above the plain, its summit triangular, each face ten thousand *li* in length, shaped like an inverted basin—narrow at the waist, broad above. One peak points due north, infused with the essence of the Chen star, called the Terrace of Soaring Winds. Another faces west, named the Terrace of the Mysterious Garden. The third points east, called the Kunlun Palace. In one place, gold accumulates to form the Celestial Rampart City, a thousand *li* on each side. Upon it stand five golden terraces and twelve jade towers. To the north lie the Mountain of the Northern Gate and the Mountain of the Abyssal Spring, along with their subsidiary peaks. There are also rampart cities, golden terraces, and jade towers, all identical in splendor—gleaming towers of refined essence, halls of luminous azure, chambers of jasper radiance, vermilion chambers of purple and cinnabar, where rosy clouds illuminate the sun and crimson auroras glow with ninefold brilliance. Here rules the Queen Mother of the West. Above, it connects to the Celestial Mechanism, where primordial *qi* flows and spreads. The Five Constants and Jade Balance universally guide the influx from the Nine Heavens’ abysses, serving as the root of myriad immortals, the pivot of heaven and earth, the handle of all measures.

Gold and silver trees grow here, forests of jade branches and cinnabar treasures, their boughs draped in resplendent tassels, their fruits formed of refined jade. Each tree is inscribed with the thirty-six celestial scripts of the heavens and the languages of the thirty-six lands. Above soar purple falcons, phoenixes, white sparrows, vermilion owls, *kun* pheasants, spirit magpies, red birds, and azure magpies. Below, flying birds and wandering beasts thrive alongside Kunlun, never knowing death or decay. Yet the sacred texts of the Mysterious Scriptures and the hidden writings of ancient characters—comprising one thousand two hundred million words—lie upon the northern slope of the Accumulated Stones in the Mysterious Garden. Ninety thousand immortals dwell there, scattered across the numinous mountain. Those who recite the celestial sounds of the heavens, the thirty-six languages of foreign lands, and the nine subterranean tones for nine years shall have immortals descend to bestow the mountain’s divine wonders. After thirty-six years, they shall ascend Kunlun upon a five-colored cloud chariot.

The Most High addresses the Supreme Minister, the Azure Youth: All celestial writings of the thirty-six lands and nine earthly realms are the primordial, hollow, and empty scriptures—natural chapters of the highest truth. From the Supreme Thearch and the Imperial Sovereigns below, to those who study immortality and attain the Dao, none fail to receive these sounds from the Supreme Truth. Bearing these texts in their travels, they command the awe of all spirits, subdue demons, summon essences, traverse the Five Peaks, and enter the Three Armies—always escorted by the Nine Heavens’ guards, attended by the Four Directors. After nine years, they ascend to the Three Origins’ chambers. After thirty-six years, heaven sends a cloud chariot to carry them aloft into the Upper Clarity.

To receive these sounds, use azure silk as the ground and a yellow brush to inscribe the text. On the night of the *jiazi* day, at midnight, perform an open-air libation in the central courtyard. Offer seasonal delicacies, three *dou* of clear wine, nine plates, and nine cups, arranged within a nine-*chi* square of azure silk. Present the texts accordingly. The disciple shall offer nine taels of gold and thirty-six *chi* of figured silk, prostrating toward the south.

The master faces north, striking the teeth thirty-six times in succession. Above, he petitions the Nine Heavens’ Chancellor; at the center, the Five Emperors and Five Spirits; below, the Nine Lands’ and Nine Qi’s Elders. Now he reports to the Eight Assemblies: the Heavenly Source shines in clarity, the Jade Emperor reflects in witness, the Void Sovereign presides over the court, the Registers of Transcendents are overseen, and the Eastern Florescence records the name. The disciple, so-and-so, yearning for the divine immortals, pledges allegiance to the numinous and receives the thirty-six celestial writings. With sealed lips, he cultivates the practice, daring not to leak the divine and true. Offering sweet wine, he dedicates his heart: above, he summons the primordial qi of the lofty dawn; below, he oversees the signs of his fate. From this moment onward, should he violate the covenant’s statutes, his seven ancestors shall bear the blame, his person sink into the river’s source, and forever endure the knife mountains. He dares not deceive the immortals—the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus all acknowledge this sworn pact.

When finished, the disciple presents the token of faith, holding the text in his left hand. Facing the northwest, he bows nine times; turning to the southeast, he bows nine times; then, facing his own life-star, he bows nine times. All rites completed.

*Concluding the Lower Scroll of the Outer Realm’s Graded Writings and the Inner Writings of the Azure Lad of Upper Clarity.*
