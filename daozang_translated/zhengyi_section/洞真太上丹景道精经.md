**The Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao-Essence**

The Yellow Lad Perfected of Taigu, Master Gu Xizi, transmitted this. I received and practiced it, sealing one lineage within Mount Daizong, distinct in name yet akin in practice to the Eight Hidden Earth Techniques. The Eight Techniques bear eight names, concealed within a jade tome, sealed with a golden chapter, attended by jade lads and guarded by jade maidens, each numbering eight hundred. The Jade Dawn bestowed this upon the Nine Mysteries, and only after seven thousand years was it passed to me.

This *Cinnabar Radiance* also bears two names: first, *The Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao-Essence*; second, *The Jade Radiance Inner True Metal Chapters of the Three Primordials’ Curved Simplicity Verses*. It shares a name yet differs in substance from the *Verses of Sorrow and Joy*. Only after seven thousand years may it be transmitted thrice; if a worthy recipient appears within a hundred years, they too may receive three transmissions, granted two jade lads and two jade maidens.

Now, *The Jade Radiance Inner True Metal Chapters of the Curved Simplicity Verses* is the supreme composition of the August Emperor Lord of the Void and the treasured verses of the Three Primordials Lord of Grand Simplicity. Smoke coalesces into script, jade waves arise from emptiness; the true pervades the arcane discourse, while simplicity shines within the golden chamber. Thus, it can dispel the Six Heavens at the inception of the Three Transformations, summon the Five Spirits amid the Seven Revolutions, govern the One and align the Three so that numinous immortals descend to repose, and revolve the Seven and shift the Five so that responses to summons know no bounds. It venerates the Two Honored Ones in the tranquil hall and stirs luminous wisdom in the frigid numen.

Thereupon, mountains and marshes submit their essence, water sources conceal and vanish, a thousand demons are collectively executed, and the Nine Fiends lose their footing. It unlocks the Five Hundred within the golden chapters, summons the Feng and Hua to the imperial throne. Then, the Jade Flower abides in repose, the Five Elders chant in unison, divine soldiers bind demons, and perverse vapors cease their clamor. It delivers the Seven Ancestors from the Southern Palace, receives their embryonic forms in the dawn’s aurora, bows to the Supreme One at the Flowery Gate, and pays homage to the Grand Simplicity in the Western Court. It transcends the Five Ranks within the imperial chamber and exhausts the Two Modes without decay.

This is the loftiest chapter of the utmost reality, the very standard by which demons are subdued. In accordance with the statutes of the Four Poles’ Luminous Regulations, it may be transmitted twice within five hundred years.

If a practitioner regularly recites the *Curved Simplicity Verses* in a serene chamber, the Five Elders will attend at dawn, and the maidens of the Jade Flower will descend at dusk. The martial might of the Great Script will ward off inauspiciousness, the spirits of springs and marshes will come to pay homage, and the true numina of the Five Peaks will bow before them.

Should one wish to command or summon, perform the Seven Revolutions and Five Transformations. First, align the heart toward the north, visualize and venerate the Three Primordials Lord of Grand Simplicity within the Golden Flower Palace, and then bow to the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord in the Sevenfold Radiance Chamber. These Two Honored Lords—jade purity gleaming in emptiness, golden countenance radiant with lingzhi—adorn their resplendent chambers with haloed light, their brilliance flashing across the Eight Mysteries.

Once visualization is complete, strike the teeth twelve times. First, thrice recite the *Incantation of the Golden Perfected*, then recite the Fourth Chapter of the Upper Grade, followed by the Second Chapter, the Sixth Chapter, the Third Chapter, and the Fifth Chapter. The Upper and Middle Grades together comprise fourteen chapters; recite them all in sequence. Then, with eyes closed, visualize the summoned entity, and it shall arrive in accordance with the heart’s intent.

To summon the numina of the Five Peaks, the Directors of Destiny and Records, and the Three Officials of the Northern Emperor, command them to expunge the ledgers of sin, inscribe names for life, eradicate the vapors of demonic perversity, and sever the roots of trial and tribulation. Once the edict is pronounced, promptly dispatch them; take care not to detain them overlong. This Dao may be practiced thrice within a month.

If one merely seeks to dispel inauspiciousness and subdue demonic perversity, it may be performed without prior purification. First recite the Third Chapter of the Middle Grade, then the Second Chapter of the Upper Grade, followed by the Seventh Chapter of the Middle Grade, the Fourth Chapter of the Middle Grade, the Sixth Chapter of the Upper Grade, and thrice recite the *Incantation of the Golden Perfected*. This is the Dao of the Five Transformations, for summoning and subduing demonic spirits. It may be performed singly, without additional visualization or veneration.

If one wishes to absolve the sins of the Seven Ancestors and deliver their embryonic forms to the imperial honored ones, the practitioner must first perform visualization as above, then recite the First Chapter of the Upper Grade thrice in succession, each time followed by a recitation of the *Incantation of the Golden Perfected*. Within a single day, complete three to five hundred recitations, constituting one grade of passage. Upon completing five hundred grades, the Seven Ancestors shall become embryonic immortals, and the practitioner shall ascend the Three Heavens.

When reciting the scripture, take care that the verses contain no errors; ten errors incur the penalty of one grade. When attempting to pass the great grades, one must first purify for three hundred days, bathe in the five fragrances, ensure the body is clad in purity, sever all worldly affairs, and free the heart from scheming thoughts. Only then may one proceed with visualization and practice.

Whenever reciting the *Qu-Su Formula* and the *Jade Radiance’s Inner Perfected Metal Chapter*,
The Imperial One must concentrate his gaze, the Director of Destinies guards the Perfected,
The Five Spirits wield axes, the Duke’s Son guards the palace gate.
One must purify one’s garments, burn incense, and reverently bow to the four directions,
Only then may one open the text’s sections.
When the sound is emitted, a thousand demons gather and submit, myriad demons are shattered and crushed,
Mountains and peaks come to court, jade splendor shares in the feast.
Reciting one section, the jade sound resonates like chiming jade,
For seven days without negligence, ten thousand directions fulfill their wishes.

The method for receiving the *Qu-Su Formula*:
Thirty feet of cinnabar brocade, two pairs of golden rings,
Serve as the pledge of the Emperor Lord’s Mysterious Perfected.
When transmitting the text, one must seal the fast for seven days,
Bathe with the five fragrant herbs, avoid contact with others,
And seek descent and response.
Only those truly worthy may receive it;
If transmitted to the unworthy, recklessly divulging the precious scripture,
Then the seven generations of ancestors will suffer dark torture in the earth prisons.
How could one not be cautious?

The *Wondrous Perfected Supreme Great Simplicity’s Cinnabar Radiance Dao Essence Scripture* concludes.
