**Incantation:**
Spirit-Observing Great Emperor,
Divinely sagacious, keen and bright.
Sunlight Bodhisattva,
Whose qi pierces the imperial celestial court.
Golden-inscribed sacred image,
Three-eyed and divinely perceptive.
Robed in yellow silk, clad in brocade,
Feet treading the fiery wheel.
Golden bricks, golden spears,
Patrolling the cosmos.
Lords of sacred mountains and great rivers,
Perfected Lords of numinous caverns.
Fire gourds, fire crows,
Whose qi and flames wield majestic might.
Beheading demons, extinguishing evil,
Swift as lightning, fierce as thunder.
Pillar of the state, guardian of the people,
Numinous spirit of protection.
Virtue enduring for myriad eons,
Blessings for myriad multitudes.
Assisting the numinous, aiding compliance,
Two sagely generals.
With the wind a thousand *li*,
A million divine soldiers.
Delivering from calamity and distress,
Responding like echo to sound.
Transforming misfortune into fortune,
Like shadow following form.
Safeguarding this servant’s body—
What prayer would go unanswered?
Divine radiance penetrating all,
Forever dwelling in auspicious felicity.
By the Great Emperor’s decree,
Hasten! Hasten! As in the law’s command!

**Offering Incense and Invocation:**
We reverently invoke the Great Marshal of Spirit-Observation,
The Five Manifest Kings of Blessing and Radiant Splendor.
In embroidered robes and ornate caps, fierce of countenance,
With fire swords and golden spears, sacred power mighty.
Foremost among the righteous spirits under heaven,
Unmatched in goodness among the Buddhas of the world.
Beside the Jade Celestial Hall, ascending pearl curtains,
By the golden-colored terrace, erecting jeweled banners.
Breaking caverns, sealing mountains, vanquishing goblins and specters,
Summoning winds, racing lightning, destroying demonic and perverse.
Guiding and transforming the myriad people, bestowing blessings,
Securing peace in the nine regions, dispelling disasters and misfortunes.
We offer incense and prostrate in sincere reverence,
May you bestow your gracious radiance upon this Daoist sanctuary.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the Purple Radiance Hall within the Eightfold Splendor Palace, seated upon a nine-colored lotus throne, beneath a canopy of ten interwoven crane plumes. Surrounding him were the myriad celestial sages, perfected deities of heaven, celestial immortals, divine immortals, the assembled host of great immortals, golden lads and jade maidens, dharma-protecting dragon spirits, and all the attendant guards. Celestial music resounded as all listened to the Heavenly Worthy expound the wondrous Dharma of the Boundless and Utmost Real.

At that moment, among the assembly, a perfected one named Settled Wisdom stepped forth, holding a tablet and kneeling reverently. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “May this disciple be permitted to hear of the principles of the Five Transformations?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the people were transformed by the Dao. After the Five Emperors, the transformative power of virtue still remained. But when it came to the age of hegemonic states, daily engaged in warfare, at that time, the Dao and virtue were abandoned, benevolence and righteousness were not practiced. What they followed and were transformed by were merely wealth and food. How could my Dao transform them? Moreover, in this latter age, sentient beings take greed and attachment as their fundamental mind, and cunning and flattery as their own conduct. They rush along the path of profit, solidifying the roots of karmic deeds, brewing evil and incurring transgressions, not venerating the teachings of goodness. This causes enmity and grudges to intertwine, resentments and faults to entangle, disrupting the harmony of the Two Qi above and bringing harm to the Nine Provinces below. Some perish by the sword in mutual slaughter, some suffer from alternating droughts and floods. Famine and starvation follow one upon another, pestilence spreads contagiously. The people die prematurely, demons and ghosts roam freely. In such times, transformation must rely upon the numinous. Thereupon, the Perfected One of Settled Wisdom again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “As for the masters of numinous transformation in the world today, your disciple does not yet fully comprehend them. How may they cause those sentient beings to dwell in peace and freedom from affliction, to enjoy wealth, honor, and long life, and to be free from all disasters and difficulties?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “You are truly compassionate, desiring to benefit the sentient beings of the latter age, and so you inquire with such expedient means. If there are good men and good women who suffer from official calamities, illnesses, karmic lawsuits, or demonic disturbances—all manner of urgent difficulties with no means of deliverance—let them but arouse the mind of faith and devotion, pray for blessings and protection, and naturally they will enjoy prosperity and peace. The power of the sagely and divine is measureless. Pay homage to the true form of Spirit-Observation, prostrate, and recite the incantation:

O Spirit of the Utmost Numinous,
Bestowing abundant blessings.
From crown to sole, enveloped in grace,
How could it ever come to an end?”

Your discerning gaze is most luminous, and thus this humble servant dares to present his devotion. Now I prostrate in homage, wholeheartedly placing my faith and reverence.

Within the Star and Moon Palace of the Thirty-Three Heavens, in the Thunder-Sound Hall, there manifests a crown of white serpents, a body of azure hue with three heads and six arms, self-possessed and free. The Great Immortal of the Fiery Rhinoceros Aura, the Divine Official of Manifest Response—transverse across the heavens, swiftly seizing the demonic forces of the Three Realms—Sealer of Mountains and Breaker of Caverns, the Dharma-Enforcing Demon-Quelling True Deity, the August Spirit-Observation Great Sage, the Five Thearchs, the Great Marshals of the Primal Origin, whose august and numinous titles are:

First, the All-Heaven Mightily Fierce Great Marshal of the Primal Origin,
Revealer of Wisdom, Illuminator of Sageliness, King of Trust and Vast Relief, Bestower of Blessings and Goodness.

Second, the Transverse-Heaven Marshal of the Great Department,
Revealer of Clarity, Illuminator of Sageliness, King of Righteousness and Vast Protection, Bestower of Blessings and Harmony.

Third, the Penetrating-Heaven Golden-Eyed Great Marshal,
Revealer of Rectitude, Illuminator of Sageliness, King of Wisdom and Vast Favor, Bestower of Blessings and Response.

Fourth, the Flying Heaven Wind-Fire Great Marshal,
Revealer of Integrity, Illuminator of Sageliness, King of Faith and Vast Moisture, Bestower of Blessings and Protection.

Fifth, the Cinnabar Heaven Demon-Quelling Great Marshal,
Revealer of Virtue, Illuminator of Sageliness, King of Love and Vast Completion, Bestower of Blessings and Favor.

These august and numinous titles of the true form may all be received and upheld. Devout women and good men who constantly read and recite them shall accrue vast merit and boundless benefit.

All who dwell in the peace of heaven’s covering and earth’s bearing are subject to the governance of the divine. Thus, the Spirit-Observation Venerable Sage in heaven serves as the Five Marshals, and in the world as the Five Kings—fierce, valiant, and luminously efficacious, wielding authority of the utmost weight. They possess the power to bestow blessings and dispel calamities, the merit to reward good and punish evil. Though poverty and wealth differ, and success and failure vary, all matters of life and death are under their scrutiny, subject to the judgment of the August Sages. Merit and transgression are clearly manifest, not a thread amiss. Know that doing good brings down auspiciousness, while refraining from wrongdoing severs the roots of evil. When the filth of delusion is swept away, the light of wisdom shines brightly; misfortunes dissolve, and blessings and felicity all arrive.

Whenever superior practitioners recite this scripture during the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the Five La Days, or on their birthdays, they shall externally dispel plagues and pestilence, and internally enhance their undertakings. The divine protect their households in secret, while demons and ghosts flee far from their borders. When merit is perfected and fruit is fulfilled, great good fortune is attained.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke the Spirit-Observation Incantation:

Spirit-Observation Marshals, manifesting fierce might and valor,
Penetrating heaven and earth, hurling fire and riding the wind.
Above, flying cinnabar sparrows; below, galloping vermilion dragons.
Golden light blazing, black mist swirling.
Demons lose their courage, ghosts and specters hide their traces.
Pacifying the people and protecting the state, vanquishing evil and eliminating misfortune.
Disasters and calamities vanish, fortune and virtue flourish.
The five numinous qi descend upon my body.
All that is sought shall be attained; all vows shall be fulfilled.
By the Northern Thearch’s command, swiftly establish divine merit!
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Among the sentient beings of the world, when heavenly disasters, severe illnesses, or epidemics spread contagiously without abating—when one lies bedridden for long, untouched by medicine—or when monkey and dog spirits, fox and leopard demons alter their forms to delude mortals, falsely impersonate august deities, or falsely claim to be great sages, occupying people’s towers and pavilions, snatching souls, setting fires, hurling bricks, stealing wealth and goods—when doors open without wind, cauldrons heat without fire, and a thousand strange and bizarre phenomena disturb the people—then in a pure and clean courtyard, invite an Orthodox Unity Daoist priest to establish an altar according to the rites, transcribe and present memorials, and perform a jiao offering to the Five Heavenly Great Marshals. Burn incense, light lamps, and recite my divine incantation. After one day or five days, the Great Iron-Wheel Deity, the White Serpent General, the Faceless General, and the Fire Department’s troops and horses shall descend in unison, sweeping away demonic miasma, purifying and stabilizing the dwelling, bringing peace to the living and driving out misfortune.

Furthermore, if one suffers imprisonment, bound in cangues and fetters, unable to escape—if one’s household is blocked, plans fail, slander arises, unjust lawsuits erupt, wealth dissipates, life and fortune decline, the five paths are obstructed, the three disasters strike repeatedly, and years of misfortune and hardship persist—then summon a Daoist priest to perform the rites as before. The Spirit-Observation Marshals, the Immortals of Blessing and Virtue, and the Auspicious Youths shall descend in timely fashion, guarding and protecting the people, dissolving calamities, and fulfilling all wishes.

If one travels through desolate wilds, secluded mountain forests, or fears to lodge alone, simply burn incense and recite the scripture, and malevolent forces shall disperse, bringing safety and peace.

But if there are sentient beings of stubborn and evil nature, icchantikas who lack faith, slander the true scripture, and disdain incense and offerings, the patrolling generals and terrestrial emissaries shall record their transgressions, determining the severity of their crimes. Those who commit grave offenses shall be cast into water or fire, meeting sudden and unnatural deaths. For lighter transgressions, their lifespan and fortune shall be diminished, and they shall suffer from illness and affliction.

Know that the Spirit-Observation Marshals are fiercely mighty and valiant, their retribution swift. They wield the authority over fortune and misfortune, life and death, demonstrating divine transformation. Good men and good women who encounter this scripture, reverently and respectfully receive, uphold, read, and recite it—and further, transcribe it for others, teaching them to recite it, or print and distribute the scripture to widely exhort and transform—shall delight the Spirit-Observation Marshals, who shall swiftly bestow blessings and protection. Naturally, their households shall prosper, wealth shall flourish, noble persons shall harmonize, and sagely power shall support them. All their heart’s desires shall be fulfilled.”

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Settled Wisdom and the assembly of immortals, having heard these words, leapt with joy, prostrated to the Spirit-Observation, and offered their prayers:

We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May the land be preserved in peace and prosperity.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May wind and rain come in due season.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May the hundred grains ripen of themselves.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May our dwellings enjoy peace and tranquility.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May our fathers and mothers enjoy long life.

We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May our plans and fortunes align with our heart’s desires.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May our wealth and possessions be abundant and full.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May fire and theft never encroach upon us.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May our comings and goings bring profitable enterprise.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May we remain free from illness and preserve long life.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May all blessings naturally converge upon us.
We bow to the Spirit-Observation, the Five August Worthies,
May the sacred teachings of the Heavenly Perfected flourish.

The assembly of great immortals, having voiced their prayers, saw the Heavenly Worthy welcomed by a dragon-drawn chariot with banners and regalia, returning to the true realm.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Perfected One of Settled Wisdom, saying: “You who have received this scripture of mine should disseminate it among the world below. Let the faithful uphold its teachings and practice accordingly, that they may beseech and partake of its blessings and protection.”

Then the Perfected One of Settled Wisdom and the assembly of immortals, reverently obeying the Dao’s decree, bowed in homage and withdrew.

Thus concludes the *Scripture of Blessings and Virtue in Five Sections*, expounded by the Heavenly Worthy of Great Wisdom, Serene Compassion, and Wondrous Joy.
