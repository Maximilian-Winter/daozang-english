**The Supreme Yellow Court Scripture of the Central Radiance**
Annotated by Li Qiancheng, Perfected of Primordial Destiny of the Supreme Clarity
*The Yellow Emperor’s Yellow Court Scripture*

The *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber* states: "Humans possess a great chamber, the central hall of the Yellow Court, wherein dwells the Yellow Venerable Lord—this is the Primordial Beginning."

The *Record of Mount Tortoise* states: "The Yellow Venerable Lord governs transformations in the Golden Pearl Palace of the Supreme Clarity."

"Yellow" signifies the color of central rectitude. "Court" denotes the center of the four directions. Externally, it corresponds to the center of heaven and earth, above the clouds and mist; internally, it resides within the brain, amidst the heart, liver, and spleen. Those who cultivate the Dao refine and preserve form and spirit, achieving transcendence and feathered transformation to attain longevity, surpassing the bounds of the celestial net. Thus, it is called the Yellow Court.

Contemplate the celestial deities upon my crown,
The qi of the Three Origins descending to generate the twenty-four luminous spirits,
Born within the upper grotto-heaven of the human body.
One radiance gives rise to the palace of the brain-spirit, wherein resides primordial qi.
The human brain has nine petals, within which nine perfected beings are born,
All arrayed in their proper stations, encircling the cinnabar field,
Their faces outward to repel inauspicious influences.
The Supreme Perfected face upward, the Lofty Perfected southward,
The Grand Perfected eastward, the Spirit Perfected westward,
The Mysterious Perfected northward.

The *Key to the Conduct of the Twenty-Four Spirits* states: "The brain-spirit resides in the nine palaces of the head, precisely within the ninefold center, amid the brain’s marrow. Its form is one cun and one fen in length, five and a half fen in height, seated facing outward to guard the spirit of the cinnabar field."

The hair is as the stars, myriad in strands.
The hair-spirit is named Mysterious Father Hua, styled Dao-Wei,
Two cun and one fen in length, of true mysterious color,
Residing within the flesh, outside the marrow, circulating through the hair’s roots,
Centered upon the crown.

Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble.
Within a single form, heaven and earth are encompassed,
As are the sun, moon, and stars, the altars of soil and grain, hardness and softness—
Nothing is not modeled upon them.
Thus, the Son of Heaven is established,
With the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, Twenty-Seven Grand Masters, Eighty-One Primary Officers,
One hundred twenty commanderies, one thousand two hundred counties,
Eighteen thousand townships, thirty-six thousand village chiefs,
And eighteen marquises.
There are also the spirits of palaces, residences, gates, doors, wells, and stoves.

Those who partake of food and drink yet know cultivation shall attain longevity.
Thus, the head is round, symbolizing heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing earth.
The hair is as the stars, the eyes as the sun and moon,
The brows as the Northern Dipper, the ears as the altars of soil and grain,
The teeth as jade and stone.

"Giving" means governance.
The hair’s first branching is one, then the spirit is stored.
Coiled and winding, its light is as dark mystery,
Twisting and turning, coiled and knotted, the hair is combed yet the topknot remains undone.

The face possesses the divine court.
The topknot is the flower of the brain.
When the heart grieves, the hair withers.
When the marrow is full and the bones firm, essence and qi are not leaked.

The center of the crown is called "Communing with Heaven,"
One cun within the hairline, the crown is named "Communing with Heaven,"
The dwelling of the abiding spirit.

The *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* states: "The demeanor of the aperture of virtue is only that which follows the Dao."
It is the gate of the myriad mysteries.

The harmonious qi of the celestial stars emerges from here.
The head is the Three Terraces; the Nine Perfected Lords of the celestial stars reside above it.
Nurturing the human bones and marrow, it permeates the numinous root.
The Crimson Palace’s threefold radiance converges to nourish the human true self.
The numinous root is the tongue—this is the root of the numinous.

Below, it harmonizes the Six Palaces and connects the Five Offices.
The intestines, stomach, large and small intestines, bladder, and Triple Burner are the Six Palaces;
The heart, liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys are the Five Offices.
It dispels malign qi, expelling it through the navel gate.

The lower cinnabar field enters the root of life,
The foundation of essence and spirit,
The gate that severs the five qi and divides yin and yang.
In the morning, it nurtures the jade countenance; by dusk, it becomes the qi of foul dregs.

Next, contemplate the division of black and white in the two eyes.
The eyes are the bright mirrors of the body.
The incantation of Lady Lin states: "The eye-lads of the three clouds, the two eye Perfected Lords."
The *Purple Book of the Cinnabar Script* states: "Constantly storing the three spirits within the eyes, uniting with the true and looking inward, one shall see the five viscera and intestines. Prolonged practice leads to transcendence."

The left eye stores the celestial deity of the sun.
The left eye symbolizes the sun; the spirit is named Supreme Clarity, styled Yingxuan, also called Flying Numinous.
Its form is one cun in length, clad in vermilion and mystery.
Twelve spirit maidens encircle its four sides.

The right eye stores the Great One of the moon.
The right eye symbolizes the moon; the spirit is named Great One, styled Chenying, also called Bright Pearl.
At cockcrow, store the green qi from the east as it comes from the moon,
Filling the Mud Pill,
Within which green smoke arises, then emerges from the eyes in a dense cloud,
Transforming into two youths clad in azure, like infants in form.
The spirit is one cun in length.

"White-clasped" denotes plain white robes. The twelve spirit maidens encircle and return. The twelve spirit maidens of the left eye and the twelve perfected ones encircle and sit in guard of the eye. The sun and moon are three *cun* apart—this "white moon" refers to the two eyes, which are three *cun* distant from each other. Within them, the Seven Governors of the Northern Dipper are arrayed. Visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper as the Celestial Ministers of the Central Palace, the Celestial Ministers of the Mysterious Palace. The Mysterious Palace extends straight upward from the bridge of the nose to the hairline, five *cun* in height. At midnight, face east, sit upright, and loosen the hair. Invoke the Three Perfected Ones of the Upper Prime, the Great Faces of the Perfected within the Prime, each with their own gates and chambers. The Seven Governors resemble the Purple Chamber of the North Pole. The perfected ones and spirits upon the face all occupy their proper positions—this is like gazing upon the Jade Tower of the Purple Chamber of the North Pole. Above it resides the Primordial One, the Lord of the Five Flowers. The Primordial One and the Five Flowers are the spirits of the five viscera. Atop the head, they dwell like a round platter—this is the Great One in the head, for the head follows the pattern of Heaven. The round platter signifies firmness. The form is seven *cun* in length, a spirit of transformation.

The ears resemble the ceaseless emptiness of day and night, ever-attuned. In cultivating the Dao, one must first ensure the eyes are bright and the ears keen—these are the masters of one’s affairs. Ears and eyes serve as the ladder to seek the perfected and the gates to gather the numinous. The eyes should be frequently pressed and soothed on both sides, yet not excessively, to sharpen perception and clarity. Thus does one govern the city walls, inscribed in the registers of the Jade Emperor.

Within lies the Yellow Court, master of the Gate of Hearing—the Yellow Court being the perfected one within the brain. When celestial spirits descend, they appear like cinnabar red. The Nine Perfected descend into the chamber of the brain. *Dan* signifies the immortal’s raiment. It measures three *cun* in length, crowned with azure-green silk.

The ear spirit is named Jiao Nü, also called Kong Xian, with the style You Tian. Its form spans three *cun*, wearing an azure-green silk cap. It ever resides above the nose, awaiting the hundred spirits. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: the nose spirit is named Shan Yuan, also called Gui Jing. It embodies the Three Primes’ mountain peaks, able to await the myriad spirits and serve as the arbiter of the true and the deviant.

Recite: "May the nose be unobstructed, fragrant as incense," to draw the numinous into the body and harmonize the hundred spirits. Within dwells one clad in golden yellow—the perfected one of the nose, robed in golden immortal garb. The spirit measures two *cun* in length, emerging to reside within the person.

The clear and void spirit-qi abides at the center—the nose’s peak, situated centrally, internally connecting the brain’s twin apertures. The qi of the Cinnabar Field’s purity and truth serves as the capital of the true and the deviant, the martial ford of the body’s pathways. First, seal the mountain source and ghost well, so that regrets and misfortunes remain unmoved—thus attaining long life without hindrance.

Enable me to be unconfused and know the four directions. Through fasting and vigilance, constantly reforming the barbarian heart’s attachments, one stands unconfused. The ears, nose, and tongue each occupy their place, serving as the four directions.

Recite: "May the mouth be vast and red as a square," containing qi and nurturing essence. The *Book of Changes* says: "Observe my chewing, seeking sustenance from the mouth." Let jade liquid surge like golden grain—the mouth’s saliva is jade liquid; abstaining from the five grains, one imbibes wind and drinks dew. *Golden grain* signifies the appearance of one who drinks not.

The spirit spans seven *cun*, red as strength—the perfected one within the mouth is named Chi Xu Zhang Ren, with the style Su Ming. It resides below the Mysterious Portal, its form seven *cun* and one *fen* in length, three *cun* and a half in height, facing outward, clad in red robes. *Strength* denotes firmness and vigor. Left and right, it turns to absorb jade nectar.

Turning and revolving, ever returning—within lies the perfected one, who draws in the vital fluids, coming and going without weariness. Like the Dipper’s iron core receiving the four directions, the perfected one bears the vessel, warding off evil in form. *Core* is the instrument for harmonizing the spirit.

Those who study the Dao must first restrain the hun and po souls, dispelling the corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, purify yourself and enter the chamber. With cinnabar brush, mark beneath the left eye’s corner; with realgar brush, mark beneath the right nostril, allowing a small amount to enter the valley. Then, softly recite the incantation, strike the teeth thrice, swallow saliva three times, and with the left hand’s second finger press beneath the right nostril, the right hand’s second finger beneath the left eye—seven times each, pressing firmly without lifting the hands. Thus is the rite complete.

These two points are the gateways of the three *hun* and seven *po*, the bridges that annihilate essence-demons. Thus the essence of cinnabar and realgar blocks the path of corpse-demons. This is the supreme method of the Great Ultimate. Practicing it harmonizes the *hun* and *po* with qi, scatters corpse-filth, and severs impurity. The spirit becomes penetrating and clear; after three years of practice, lustful thoughts vanish entirely, the four limbs remain free of illness, and one attains longevity.

The spirit is three *cun* in length, clad in dark yellow. The spirit in the brain’s first node dwells within the bone, three *cun* in length, one *cun* and seven and a half *fen* in height, seated facing outward. Its divine maidens occupy the eastern and western chambers—within the body, all possess male and female perfected lords, arrayed in the positions of yin and yang. The chambers, left and right, are the Cavernous Palaces and Hall of Light; the perfected one resides at their center, their positions aligned in mutual regard.

They uphold the Yellow Spring and the five flavors’ longevity. The Yellow Spring lies below the chin and above the throat. The five flavors enter, chewed and swallowed, all sustained by the perfected one. This Dao is wondrously divine, its edge keen—naturally possessing numinous efficacy. *Keen edge* signifies a sharp instrument.

The Dao by which humans are born, the spirit by which they are nurtured—imbibing the numinous and receiving clarity, the body is thus formed. The common people use it daily yet remain unaware; the myriad things obtain it yet do not perceive it. Concealed within, it operates unseen, or shines without fixed direction.

The spirit is seven *cun* in length, clad in cinnabar red. Seven *cun* in length, it resides within the Jade Pillow’s brain, the inner gate of marrow and fat, seated facing forward in red garments. The host of spirits transforms and nourishes the Five Constants. The perfected one is the lord of the host of spirits and the Five Constants of yin and yang. *Host* denotes the multitude. *Nourishes* means to engender—the perfected one transforms and nurtures the human body.

The Great Tube flourishes, commanding the upper region. The Great Tube is the Mysterious Gullet, beneath the tongue and above the throat, also called the Lower Tube, receiving the upper and lower gullets. This tube receives essence and flourishes, eight *cun* in length—hence *flourishes*. Knowing the tongue’s Dao, life remains unceasing. The tongue is the dragon’s mechanism of the *Wu Ying*—if one cultivates it, one attains longevity.

The tongue’s root has jade branches, red as cinnabar. *Jade branches* is the tongue’s name—if one employs its mechanism, it can dissolve hardness and softness. It governs the discernment of flavors and the flow of sweet springs. The tongue is the heart’s official; when the tongue is harmonized, it distinguishes the five flavors. *Sweet springs* refers to saliva.

Below, contemplate the throat’s twelve rings. The throat spirit is named *Hu Ze*, the path of true qi and the source of vital fluids, also called the *Chong Tang*, located beneath the chin—hence *below*. The Crimson Palace’s twelve-tiered tower corresponds externally to the twelve hourly guardians. From below, it channels the flow between the two breasts. The two breasts are named Heavenly Storehouse, where the Jade Hall perfected one resides.

Within are the yin-yang immortal husband and wife. The left breast belongs to yang, where the male perfected one dwells; the right breast belongs to yin, where the female perfected one resides. Each is eight *cun* in length, four *cun* in height, seated facing one another—like humans facing each other, hence *husband and wife*. They wield jade halberds at the four directions’ borders. *Wield* means to grasp—the jade halberds are like the perfected ones guarding the throat. The four directions refer to the chest’s diaphragm, above and below, within and beyond the breasts.

Food and drink do not burden the great, allowing return. Once the upper burner is unobstructed, water and grain do not accumulate, returning to the lower origin. Contemplate the lungs’ five lobes, radiant as jade. Among the five viscera, the lungs rank highest, opposite the chest, with five lobes like gauze veiling the valley.

Pale blue-white, gleaming like frost and ice. *Gleaming frost and ice*—the lungs govern the west, the true position of metal. The *Zou Zhen* covers the heart, guarding the four directions. The lungs lie above the heart—hence *covers*. *Zou* are immortal soldiers; *guards* means to be near. The lung’s four lobes hang near the heart—hence the four directions.

Above is the Mysterious Youth, radiant as moonlight. The lung spirit is named *Hao Hua*, styled *Xu Cheng*, residing within the lungs. The spirit is four and a half *cun* in length, clad in white, seated facing the Dipper. *Moon* is yin essence—the lungs govern yin, like moonlight. The true essence is the canopy’s inner brilliance. The lungs are the heart’s flowery canopy, above the liver—hence *brilliance*.

The lungs are hollow and empty, moving above and below. The lungs are the palace of the *hun* and *po*; the *hun*’s nature is ethereal and floating. The nose connects to heavenly qi, its five lobes hanging to veil the inner orifices, corresponding in movement above and below. As vast as a sharp aperture, it connects to the Great Constant. Preserving qi ensures communion with the spirit; preserving essence ensures spirit clarity. The lungs’ body is light and floating, its hidden apertures internally linked—qi’s coming and going naturally ascends and descends.

If exhausted, the Dao’s envoys perish. When the six palaces are harmonized, the spirit remains; when the three regions are unsettled, my true ones must disperse.

"Enjoy" is pronounced with a departing tone. When severed, it leaves no room for the myriad spirits to prosper—when the Dao departs, the person dies; when the water dries, the fish perish. If the myriad spirits scatter, how can one not perish?

To cultivate one’s nature, examine the subtleties of breath. Cultivating the body and nurturing one’s nature—closing the breath is called "refining qi," also named "embryonic breathing." From midnight to noon is the time of generative qi; from noon to midnight is the time of destructive qi. Always practice during the time of generative qi: lie supine or prone, close the eyes, clench the fists, and hold the breath without exhalation at the center until one hundred twenty counts, then release it from the mouth, gradually increasing the count each day. Thus, the body’s spirits will manifest, and the five viscera will be at peace. After two hundred fifty days, the spirits of the Crimson Palace will guard, the Mud Pill will remain full, and the Cinnabar Field will flourish. After three hundred days, the flowery canopy will naturally brighten, and the entire body will be free of illness.

The method of guiding the breath: neither cold nor heat accumulates, water and grain pass without stagnation. In one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. If one practices this for a thousand days, one can nourish the entire body. When primordial qi is complete, there is no passage that is not open, no pulse that is not harmonized, no accumulation that does not disperse.

Raising the head and contracting the nose, the qi ascends. The turtle’s guidance: retracting the head and containing the breath, essence and qi descend. The snake’s guidance: coiling without straightening, the qi ascends and circulates. The human’s guidance: closing the mouth and gently breathing, qi enters the Cinnabar Field. By mastering exhalation and inhalation, the true spirits are internally perfected, ascending to the Purple Clarity—this is governed by the regulation of breath.

Above, the flowing spirits manifest in five forms. The flowing spirits are the luminous spirits of the five viscera.

When manifest, by careful contemplation and reflection, their forms become clear.

The Wind Lord and Rain Master regulate yin and yang:
The Wind Lord is named Bijun, styled "Long Abstinence";
The Rain Master is named Fengxiu, styled "Bantu."
Within the human body, they reside in the brain’s "Temple of the Mind";
at the nape, they are called "Minister";
at the spleen’s tip, "Grain";
in the large intestine, "Wind Lord";
and beside the navel, "Rain Master."

The *Book of Changes* states: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao."
Nearly, we draw from the body; distantly, from all things.
The *Nanhua Sutra* says: "Heaven is within man; earth is within man."
Encompassing the myriad things, the mysterious workings naturally reside in the body.

Fu Xi and Nü Wa may endure or perish—
Fu Xi, sovereign of the Three August Ones;
Nü Wa, ruler of high antiquity.
Both established reforms and innovations, founding the origins of governance.
Within the three offices and five viscera of man, these sovereigns reside.
The stomach, the Great Granary, is the transmitted palace of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.

The lungs connect to the White Flower’s Yin Land—
The lungs govern the region of Yongzhou and preside over the Western Marchmount, Mount Hua.
They emerge riding white tigers, borne upon wind and rain.
The lung spirit manifests externally as the White Tiger.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states: "The Lung Lord is the White Prime Lord."
Dwelling in the Cavern Chamber Palace, he rides forth on a white tiger or upon white qi,
attended by the Grand Harmony Lord and twenty-six hundred riders.

The heart, a purple span of five inches, tapers downward—
The heart is the Emperor Lord, situated below the lungs and above the liver,
opposite the point one inch below the coccyx.
The heart, also called the Crimson Palace, governs the entire body,
overseeing all beings, directing the breath of every spirit without fail.
Its tapering form is the heart’s aperture, through which the myriad spirits enter and exit in response to the eight trigrams.

Nurtured like the numinous root supporting the center—
The numinous root is the root of life, irrigated by jade liquid transformed into pure water.
If one can cultivate the three inches, the heart abides long in the center.

A luminous pearl, red and white as sunlight—
The luminous pearl is the heart’s essence,
its complexion like unbleached silk suffused with crimson.

Within, three apertures glow resplendently—
The heart possesses three apertures through which essence and qi flow.
"Resplendently" describes their radiant expansion.

A thousand chariots assemble at dawn in the Hall of Light—
Those who cultivate the Dao extinguish the heart and wither the body,
sitting in forgetfulness, merging inner clarity with perception,
where form and spirit intermingle in illumination.
Within the body, they witness a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders.
The Hall of Light lies one inch inward from the space between the brows.

Essence and qi flourish on Mount Huo in the south—
The heart governs the region of Yangzhou and Mount Huo of the Southern Marchmount.

The Heart Lord’s wondrous raiment is of great brilliance—
The heart spirit, a youth named "Wondrous Essence,"
is the true color of the Great Yang.

Adorned in shimmering green, radiant and crimson-crowned—
"Shimmering green" refers to immortal tresses or the heart’s inner glow of red.
He wears a flowered canopy, the Vermilion Bird.

Ninefold luminous sashes girded with crimson arms—
Within the three divisions, each has nine degrees:
the nine qi of the Upper Origin serve as canopy-bearing envoys,
the nine qi of the Middle Origin as remonstrators,
and the nine qi of the Lower Origin as grand heralds.
Twenty-seven great spirits in all govern and command the numinous,
directing the movements of the body.
Alternatively, the nine degrees may refer to the nine apertures.
The luminous sashes are crimson vessels intertwined,
linked to the arms for defense and martial prowess.
The upper division undergoes nine transformations,
the middle division has nine apertures,
and the lower division bears nine names,
thus connecting the nine provinces.

Ingesting the flowery essence of the Great Yang’s east—
The flowery essence of water and grain, transformed into fluids,
flows downward from above and must be gathered and circulated,
guided by the heart after the liver.
The left governs the east, hence it is called the east of the Great Yang.

One should be as spiritually clear as a crimson child—
The crimson child, the heart’s spirit,
is nine inches in length, four and a half inches in height,
clad in red, seated facing outward.

Emerging in a cinnabar chariot, attended by three pairs—
The cinnabar chariot is the heart’s true color,
dwelling in the Crimson Palace’s Primordial Yang Mansion.
When it emerges, it rides upon three columns of red qi.
The heart’s face governs the southern position of the yang heart,
aligned with the face.
When it departs, it is accompanied by the Southern Culmen Elder
and thirty-six hundred riders in attendance.

A towering canopy, a vermilion carriage, crimson curtains and robes—
"Towering" means lofty.

The red is the crow.
The canopy’s vermilion carriage is drawn by cinnabar serpents.
The cinnabar crow bears the tally and beats its wings in flight—
The cinnabar crow is the Vermilion Bird,
an outward manifestation of decay.
Thus the Dark Warrior governs the Water of Jade Liquid,
while the Vermilion Bird appears only when needed,
hence its presence is not constant.
The tally is qi.
Human qi rises from below, ascending like a soaring crow spreading its wings.

Emerging and entering, ascending and descending, it discourses on the Nine Stars—
The nine qi transform into nine spirits within the human body.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:
"The Celestial Sovereign’s nine souls undergo transformation to become them."

Reflect upon the purity of the spirits to transcend life and death—
"Reflect" means to contemplate.
"Transcend" means to change.
"Purity of the spirits" refers to the spirits of the five viscera.
If one can nurture qi through embryonic breathing,
one may alter the course of life and death,
and attain the state of divine transcendence.

Through transformation, one gains heavenly control over one’s robes—
The heart governs the body,
directing movement as spirit.
Subtle and wondrous, the flying form—
when profound sincerity and perfect stillness are achieved,
the five illuminations manifest.

Descending past the Long Wall to cross the Nine Beams—
Mount Kunlun has its Five Cities and Twelve Towers,
and within the human body, these exist in the lower region.
The Nine Beams are the nine qi of the lower origin.

The liver, azure with seven lobes, lodges in the gallbladder’s storehouse—
The liver, wood of the eastern direction, is azure.
Three lobes on the left, four on the right,
its color like raw silk.
Connected to the gallbladder, hence it is said to lodge there.

Its form resembles a soaring crow’s wings—
Drawing from the external analogy of the hare,
the hare being the water crow.
If embryonic breathing is perfected and the spirit emptied of all but essentials,
the liver becomes full and transcendent,
like a hare poised for flight.

Again, it resembles a pheasant soaring into the sun—
Like the nine cranes and swans.
When qi is full and the liver flourishing,
it ascends like a pheasant in high flight,
entering the sun as if rising into heaven.

Within reside many spirits, the Eastern and Western Kings—
The spirits are the Celestial Illumination Lord,
also called the Duke, the Radiant One,
the primordial true spirit of the liver.
The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states:
"The Primordial Hero Duke,
the White Primordial Venerable Spirit,
descends to guard the human body,
dwelling in the Muddy Pellet Palace."

Its palace belongs to the Imperial Succession of the Purple Pavilion District—
The liver has its Azure Yang Palace,
wherein resides the Non-Bright True Person,
whose spirit governs the register of life.
"Succession" means essence.
The Purple Pavilion District is the eyes.
The eyes’ qi is purple, governing the liver.
When one consumes turbid substances and the liver flourishes,
the eyes grow dim.
When the perfected one’s Dao is empty and the liver full,
the eyes become bright.
If breathing and absorption are perfected,
the liver and gallbladder fill within,
then spirit and essence harmonize,
essence coalesces into unified virtue,
and there is no danger of collapse.

The liver’s wondrous spirit wears azure radiance—
The liver’s color is azure,
the true color of the Wood Star of the eastern direction.
Its form, eight inches long, rides a green dragon—
Eight inches in length,
clad in azure robes,
dwelling in the Hall of Light.
When it emerges, it rides a green dragon,
a chariot of azure hue,
accompanied by the Eastern Culmen Elder
and thirty-six hundred riders.

Above, it encompasses the Year Star and the Sacred Peak of Tai—
The Year Star is Horn and Neck.
The Sacred Peak of Tai is the Eastern Marchmount,
the Azure Province.

The gallbladder, within the liver, holds greenish-yellow fluid—
The gallbladder lies between the liver’s left and right lobes,
a watery extension of bluish-green hue.
When full, it contains a greenish-yellow-white liquid,
which is the greenish-yellow fluid.

Large as a sparrow hawk, centered in true yellow—
The *Oral Instructions on the Twenty-Four Spirits’ Conduct* states:
"The gallbladder’s color is azure-yellow-green,
as large as a sparrow hawk."

Its spirit, three inches long, wears azure yang—
The gallbladder is named Dragon Leap,
three inches and eight fen in length,
azure-yellow in color,
seated facing outward.

Its essence transforms into the soaring serpent to ward off inauspicious omens—
The gallbladder is one of the six palaces,
externally corresponding to the soaring serpent,
also known as the Green Dragon.
The gallbladder’s courage and vigor
can dispel misfortune.
"Inauspicious omens" refers to poisonous creatures,
or the Three Corpses worms.

It is named the "Regulator of Enemies," governing the four directions—
Among the spirits of the six palaces,
the gallbladder is the most robust and valiant.
Human conduct, whether upright or perverse,
depends on the gallbladder.
When the gallbladder is upright, all is naturally peaceful;
when perverse, its orifices are destroyed.
It constantly defends externally,
regulating by following the gallbladder’s law,
commanding resistance against enemies.
Truly, the cultivation of the supreme Dao
cannot be achieved without the gallbladder.

The stomach holds three pints, corresponding to the sun and moon—
The stomach is the Great Granary,
moving with the five viscera and following the four seasons.
It is the sea of water and grain,
the convergence of the large intestine,
the abode of the numinous.
Its exterior is white, its interior moist and red with patterns—
The stomach’s color is white externally,
while internally it is lustrous red with patterns.

Within resides harmonious qi, subtly ruling—
Harmonious qi is true qi.
"Subtly ruling" refers to the true person within the stomach.
When the stomach opens, the five viscera are bright;
when it closes, the five viscera grow dim.
It is the overflow and blockage of the myriad spirits,
the crucial ford of the unified body.
Clouds move and rain falls—
all begins here.

When thirsty, one craves its water as jade nectar—
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:
"In practicing the method of ingesting the Dark Root,
one visualizes the stomach’s opening,
where a maiden, childlike and unclothed,
stands upright in the stomach’s conduit.
Opening her mouth to receive the infusion of ethereal liquid,
she inhales the five qi,
and when the mouth is full of saliva,
one swallows it, sending it into the Dark Maiden’s mouth.
After five repetitions,
one clicks the teeth three times,
swallowing the liquid nine times—
all according to this method."

When hungry, one craves its interior as yellow provisions—
Hunger is sated by swallowing saliva,
which is the body’s natural sustenance.
Yellow is the true color of the central direction.

Its spirit, three inches long, wears the central hue—
The spirit is named Yellow Emperor’s Son,
three inches in length,
clad in yellow robes,
seated facing outward,
dissolving and refining food.

Through transformation, the Cinnabar Field’s hundred diseases vanish—
The Crimson Child dwells in the upper Cinnabar Field,
the True Person in the middle,
the Infant in the lower.
One spirit is named True Person, styled Zidan,
also called Guangjian.
If one can preserve it,
there will be no premature death from illness.
The True Person values the three fields uniting as one—
the foundation of divine transcendence.

The spleen’s jade waist is of true yellow—
The spleen is the palace of the Yellow Court.
The spleen lies across the stomach,
its color a luminous yellow.

Two wooden points press against the Great Granary—
The two wooden points are its sharp, firm edges,
pressing against the stomach,
forming the Great Granary’s sides.

Its form resembles a golden weight, its color like a dim lamp—
Gold represents firmness and strength.

The spleen, when afflicted, bears a fatty membrane like raw silk wrapping yellow and white—this is its radiant, blended state. It constantly envelops sweetness to open the court’s hall. For all who follow the Dao, keeping the Three Passes ever harmonized is the root of essence’s firmness and the body’s stability. When the Three Passes are regulated, the Five Viscera are at peace, and the body knows no illness.

A spirit nine inches tall, clad in yellow light—
The spleen spans nine inches, robed in yellow. The Eight Radiant Divine Lads bear these names. When one desires to preserve it, its form grows three inches long, lying transversely above the stomach. At dawn, it serves as the Venerable Lord; at dusk, as the Hall of Light’s Grand Unity Lord.

It emerges riding a verdant chariot, dragon-drawn in flight—
The spleen is the Hall of Light’s office, the Supreme Palace. Within it dwells the Jade Maiden of Mystic Radiance. The maiden of the Cinnabar Field rides forth in a chariot of yellow dragons, attended by three thousand six hundred riders of the Yellow Venerable Lord.

Above, it connects to the Star of Stability and the Lesser Chamber’s hall—
The Star of Stability is the Mystic Chamber. The Lesser Chamber is the Central Marchmount of Yuzhou. It governs the five flavors to nourish the four conducts—
The spleen distributes the five flavors, restraining and strengthening the four directions; thus it is their sovereign. By this, one may remain free from hunger and perceive the numinous.

The kidneys, black, flank the spine and reside at the navel—
The kidneys dwell in the lower Water Palace, three inches below the navel, adhering to the spine. The left is the Life Storehouse, the right the Great Harmony; the left governs the Minister, the right the Marshal. The kidneys lie on either side of the navel, directing the qi of the Triple Burner and irrigating the pathways of fluids.

Master Primal Yang says: Cold and heat beget one another; male and female take form. Within the kidneys dwell two spirits in azure robes—the left male bears the sun, the right female the moon. At midnight, if one can concentrate and visualize with precision, they may be seen.

Large as a fist, like an overturned cup—
The lower Cinnabar Field is the dwelling of the life-root spirit, storing the five qi. Left is azure, right yellow; above black, below white—its size is that of a large fist. It resembles a great rat or the Gate Terrace—
The kidneys are like a crouching ox, large or small as a rat. The Terrace faces the kidney’s form; the kidney’s office is the Mystic Gate Terrace.

Swift as pure lacquer, dark as a darting bird—
The kidneys’ color is like black lacquer, resembling a frantic rat or a bird. When fetal breathing is complete and kidney qi is drawn upward in a pair, it soars like a flying bird, poised for flight—this is the state of swiftness.

Yellow and white suffuse the marrow, filling the body’s core—
True essence overflows, like the body’s radiant joy. Within abide the myriad formless spirits—
The formless arises from the formed, hidden yet able to generate the Crimson Child. The Heavenly Department is the Palace of the Great Treasure—
What is prized lies in non-use; nothing is more wondrous than the Dao in its constant sufficiency. Thus within the three degrees, each has nine attendants: on the right, the Director of Destinies; on the left, the Recorder; the left Minister of Justice—all swiftly record a person’s good and evil.

The kidneys are the Lord of Mystic Origin and Master Primal Yang. The Gate of Life is also called the Jade Capital—the lower Cinnabar Field. It is the place where essence and qi enter and exit, where the spirit resides, located behind the navel. Thus those who seek the true withdraw to secluded cliffs, severing worldly ties, fearing that defilement by women will endanger the lower Cinnabar Field, causing the Dark Bureau to record their offenses and the Underworld to shorten their allotted years.

The *Scripture of the Three Ones* states: At midnight on days of *jiazi*, *wuzi*, or *renzi*, call out to the Northern Culmen, naming the Mystic Communicant Maiden, saying, “So-and-so desires the Golden Liquid, Jade Nectar, and Sweet Spring to drink.” Thereupon, in profound meditation, visualize within the kidneys a white qi. On the left is the Director of Destinies, on the right the Recorder. Call out, “Recorder, Six Ding Jade Maiden, erase so-and-so’s name from the register of the dead.” All should speak thus to give me life. One who knows the names of the Three Ones’ spirits may attain longevity.

The *Book of Changes* says: The sage’s great treasure is called *position*—this means the ten thousand images reside within the human body.

A spirit six inches tall, clad in crimson-brown—
The spirit is named Mystic Darkness, styled Nurturing Infant. It is six and seven-eighths inches tall, robed in white, seated facing outward. It rides forth in a chariot of the Dark Warrior, drawn by a divine tortoise—
The Dark Warrior is the tortoise, the true color of the north. The kidneys are the Dark and Obscure Palace, within which dwells the Grand Unity Lord. It emerges riding the Dark Warrior and flying tortoise, attended by three thousand six hundred riders of the Northern Culmen Venerable Elder.

Bearing water above and below, it irrigates the Nine Provinces—
The kidneys’ two sides are named the Han Waters. Within dwells a divine tortoise whose breath nourishes the flowing currents, dividing into two streams that circulate through the four limbs, pervading the whole. The *Scripture of the Three Ones* says: The kidneys contain a divine tortoise, also called the Dark Warrior, which distributes moisture and nourishment, connecting the nine orifices and corresponding to the Nine Provinces.

The hundred vessels and pores flourish and are well-ordered—
Within the three regions and nine orifices, the divine tortoise bears water, moistening the nine apertures and hundred vessels, thus bringing harmony. Above, it holds the stars in mutual support—
The five stars are stored within, inwardly corresponding to outer movements. The perfected one does not boast of petty conduct but shines with mystic illumination, aligning virtue with heaven and earth, matching the degrees of the stars. The body becomes a net of separation, and the myriad images respond within.

The *Method of Returning to the Origin* states: Step through the Way of the Seven Stars, visualizing the true person’s star descending from the Dipper and flying into one’s mouth, infusing the liver with light to illuminate the Five Viscera, making inner and outer brilliantly clear. Upon completion, face north and swallow saliva nine times.

Below, it joins with Mount Heng to lend support.

At the center of the four directions and above and below, the north is the lowest. Mount Heng, the Northern Marchmount, belongs to the Jizhou division. Its qi converges with the Jade Spring, which is the lower cinnabar field.

The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: The three luminaries transform through yin to form the Three Offices, wherein the nine spirits are registered—these are the Lords of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primal Origins who govern destiny. The spirit is six inches in height and clad in dark yellow. The spirit is named Infant, styled Primal Yang Master, also called Valley Mystery. His form is six inches long and one inch eight fen tall, robed in red, seated facing outward.

The spirit-consorts share twelve curtains. The spirit-consorts—Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist and Jade Maiden of the Mystic Radiance—follow their mother within the curtains, dwelling in the cinnabar field to jointly guard the Lower Origin. The fivefold radiance of mystic luminance illumines the four directions, for below the navel lie the five viscera in their entirety—hence the fivefold radiance. Its circumference embraces the four directions—hence the four directions.

Clad in azure, red, white, and black without, and yellow within: the kidneys lie outside the navel, near its upper edge—thus the name "outer yellow." Fivefold encircling defenses stand guard at four gates flung wide, as above and below connect and the five viscera interlink in mutual circulation.

The Five Stars interlink, their quintuple essences circulating in mutual flow, the five qi harmonizing and dissolving. The four gates are the four closures of the navel. Above, they connect to the crown; below, they penetrate the womb-envelope.

At the center lies the numinous terrace, the resplendent hall—
The center void is the spleen’s domain; the numinous terrace, the heart’s abode.
Beneath the flowering canopy, the navel serves as the lower sea, universally pervading the six qi, its mansion linked to the heart.

A vermilion tower of two inches communicates within itself.
The *Shangqing Scripture* states: Within the navel lies the Yellow Gate and Golden Chamber, the Silver City and Vermilion Tower—inner palace of the Lord of Unity, treasure-hall of the Three Perfected.

Divine maidens gather and sport at the center.
The *Twenty-Four Divine Rites* states: The divine maiden is named Zhu Yuanma, styled Daojisheng. In men, she dwells within the yin organ; in women, within the womb. Her form measures two inches and two fen, of purple hue, seated facing outward, capable of engendering male and female offspring.

The *Scripture of Immortals* says: Within the human navel lie Kunlun, the Weak Waters, and the Abyss of Dark Mystery—where the sun and moon traverse, no different from the outer Kunlun. Only the perfected wander their spirits within and behold it. All the flying immortals soar above it, just as in heaven the sun and moon descend to illuminate the earth, and all things become bright. So too with man: the sun and moon shine down upon the navel, keeping the viscera ever luminous. By night, the sun rests in the stomach, casting light upon the navel—thus the navel stands at the very center of heaven, earth, and the Three Origins.

They harness the boundless to ride yin and yang—
Yin and yang are the lords of the lower cinnabar field, containing the two qi whose transformations give rise to form. Thus, when male and female unite in essence, the myriad transformations are born—this is the true spirit.

They command the Six Azure Dragons to establish the left—
The left governs yang; the Six Azure Dragons are also yang. Three becomes six, the inception of life’s image, the substance of formed being. The *Scripture of Immortals* says: "Three on the left, seven on the right, nine above, one below." Thus, those who seek the true preserve the three and guard the one.

The White Tiger grasps the bow at the right—
The right is yin, the White Tiger. The bow is the arc, governing yang. The *Book of Changes* says: "First draw the bow; if rain comes, it is auspicious." This speaks of yin and yang forming images, weighing and transforming.

The Vermilion Bird leads the way, wielding the five weapons—
The heart is the Vermilion Bird, dwelling above the spleen—thus it leads. Within the five viscera, each has its guardian spirit—these are the five weapons.

The Dark Warrior carries the drum in the rear—
The Dark Warrior is the kidneys, situated on either side of the spine—thus it follows behind. Below, near the bladder, it carries the drum.

A thousand spirits and ten thousand riders charge in all directions—
Within a single body dwell thirty-six thousand true spirits and twelve hundred luminous essences, whose encampments and defenses give form. Thus, when the perfected discard the limbs, dim the senses, and nurture the numinous essence, they command a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: "Spirit gives birth to form; form gives birth to spirit. Without spirit, form cannot live; without form, spirit cannot be complete." This speaks of the adept’s inward contemplation, which brings about immortality.

Soaring aloft like a chariot ascending the Nine Azure Heavens—
When the crane cries, the young respond; cultivation perfected, it answers purity. The host of immortals flank the chariot, ascending the Nine Heavens.

Grasping my Yellow Spirit, they turn the Eight Passes—
The Yellow Spirit is the Yellow Court; the Eight Passes, the eight directions. When the Dao is practiced through inner cultivation, completion allows one to traverse the Six Voids and wander at ease through the eight quarters.

In union with the Dao, they await and welcome—
When the hook is raised and the fork responds, nurturing the spirit brings recompense. In union with the Dao, one ascends the Purple Ultimate.

Returning once more to the center of my form—
The Dao of heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return. Is it possible or not? Yet it is not so—rather, the form returns to spirit, merging into wondrous quiescence.

In the indistinct and vague, they come and go, their faces without constancy—
The *Scripture of Laozi* says: "Within the indistinct and vague, there are things." The *True Records* say: "The face is the dwelling of a foot." The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: "The face should often be rubbed with both hands, following its contours up and down until thoroughly warm. This makes the face radiant, prevents wrinkles and blemishes, and after five years, the complexion becomes like a maiden’s." This is called "circulating qi through mountains and rivers, ever full and unceasing."

None can know whether it abides or perishes—

Those who know the true Dao do not decline or weary. Thus, the Five Viscera and Six Bowels reign as kings. The Five Viscera and Six Bowels each have spirits that govern them. Their models converge as one in the Cinnabar Field, named "the One." When virtue abounds and daily grows, the Dao and the One spread transformation to generate the Three Powers. Man, obtaining the One, forms his body and gives rise to the Three Regions. Preserving the Three and guarding the One, he becomes one with the Dao. If you can know the One, all matters are complete—the One is the spirit of the body.

Truly, if one can master this, it is the method to transcend the world. *Cheng* means "sincerity," and *fang* means "Dao." To guard one’s body is to surely attain the Dao of transcending the world.

One *cun* below the navel is called the Cinnabar Field. The Lower Cinnabar Field is named the Mechanism of Profit, also called Essence Dew, Intermingling Yin, or the Gate of Life—the life of the right府 of the Triple Burner. The various intestines coil and connect to the spine. The various intestines refer to the large and small intestines. Attached to the spine, they bear the stomach’s opening opposite the navel. The large intestine winds left in sixteen curves, the small intestine winds right in sixteen curves, circulating fluids that enter the intestines as turbid waste. The clear portion, passing behind the stomach, enters the kidney bladder, pouring into yin and yang as urine. The turbid portion, divided by the lungs, enters the intestines and exits as feces. Thus, those who circulate qi cease eating, and their spirit becomes bright and clear.

Three *cun* square is called the Pass of Origin. The Pass of Origin lies three *cun* below the navel, also named the Pass of Clarity or the Gate of Fluids. It is the chamber where men store essence and the palace where women nurture the fetus. Extending four directions forms the Vermilion Wall. The four directions are the four cardinal points.

The vertical and horizontal axes intersect at the vermilion wall. They constantly reside at the central two gateways, which lie between the two kidneys. The spirit extends five *cun* in length, clad in golden script. Storing it morning and evening prevents decline—its length is two *cun* and one *fen*. It can expand or contract, transforming as a spirit. The spirit is that which subtly governs the myriad things. Its transformations arise naturally, bearing the unity of the body.

Below, contemplate the Gate of Heaven aligned with the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is the navel, the lord of the inception of life. The ancestral origin is the Golden Gate and Jade Tower. One spirit is named the Peach Boy Lord, who governs the inception of the vital breath of luminous qi. This is the origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral root of yin and yang, the treasure of the Golden Gate and Jade Tower, the jewel of the chamber’s portal. A person’s life is governed by the Peach Lord, for the soul transforms into essence and fluids to give birth.

One *chi* below the navel lies the transforming spirit. This *chi* is above the yin bladder and below the womb, situated before the anus and behind the urethra, at the gate where the two yin meet. Within it dwells the True Person, called the Controller of Life. It is the root of a person’s years and months, the arbiter of questions concerning longevity or early demise. The Great One transforms the hun-soul, and together they attend the assembly of the Lords of Life, aligning with the Hun Emperor Lord. Thus, it is called the spirit of the Lord of Life, who oversees the register of years and the span of life’s authority. It is the repository of primordial unity, from which all records derive. It is also named the Spirit of the Numinous Flower and Ancestral Origin.

Two maidens stand in attendance, yet they may bring ruin to a person. These two maidens are the spirits of the yin, dwelling below the Gate of Life, through whom the harmony of yin and yang is achieved. If the true spirit is exhausted and the essence-fluids fail to flow, women will miscarry, and men will deplete their inner spirits, inviting calamity. If you wish not to die, gather your essence and turn your gaze inward. If you wish for long life, gather your essence and return to your form.

Who does not know the value of life? Yet one cannot refrain from intercourse. Once essence is discharged through the lower gate, qi becomes turbid and fluids leak. The brain shouts as marrow is exhausted, and all efforts merely hasten dissolution. This is not the original true state but rather an inner corruption. The primordial spirit gradually wanes, and decay draws near. As the *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: "The reason people treat life lightly and meet early ends is that they themselves invite defilement. It is not Heaven and Earth that destroy them, nor ghosts and spirits that harm them, but their own form."

Those who cultivate life earnestly sever worldly affairs and retreat to the mountains and forests. They seek to cut off all frivolous customs, seal the senses, refine the form, and preserve correctness and auspiciousness. They can become great or small, yet their minds remain unconfused. Seeing nothing, they feel no vexation. Naturally, their minds are clear and their intentions settled. When intention is focused and the three spirits are free of illness, the three cinnabar fields are purified. Sincerity and devotion bring resonance. The *Scripture of Peaceful Joy* may then be fully realized. One effort brings eternal ease, and thus long life is attained—what more need be said?

The Three Ones of the Heavenly Dao are the foremost gate, namely Qian and Kun. Uniting Qian and Kun stabilizes the six palaces. The three give rise to the six palaces, which remain quiescent and unmoving, responsive yet unborn, serene and without action. Thus, one contemplates them. Knowing the mechanism of the true spirit, one exhausts principle and fulfills nature. There is no pore or orifice that does not turn inward. Cultivation completes, one averts disasters and misfortunes, forever leaving the depths of illness. Upright and blameless, one proceeds without hindrance.

Read in accordance with the method: profound meaning enters the spirit, and deep study refines marvelous subtleties. Spirit and essence circulate and transform. Drawing breath in mutual embrace, the form and substance are already complete and return to their proper place. The five viscera generate numinous vitality, and the three fields are inwardly replete. All demonic forces and myriad intrusions flee ten thousand *li*. One enters water without getting wet, and fierce beasts cannot seize them. Guarding the five paths and preserving the Yellow Court, one securely holds the gate and transmits the mirror to worthy scholars. Those who receive it gain fortune and stand before the Most High.

Here ends the *Central Scripture of the Yellow Court*.
