**The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Cavern of Perfection on the Eight Pure Essentials, Divination, and the Secret of Entering Samādhi**

The *Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Cavern of Perfection on the Eight Pure Essentials, Divination, and the Secret of Entering Samādhi* is of uncertain authorship, approximately dating to the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. Originally part of the *Secret of the Eight Pure Essentials*, it later circulated independently as a single fascicle. The present text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Section Zhengyi, First Division.

---

The Supreme Thearch addressed the Perfected Ones of the Four Poles, saying: Those who now steadfastly believe in the Supreme Dao and cultivate its study without ceasing—all such persons have in former lives already accumulated goodness, being born in the heavens above. Yet in the heavens, they indulge in pleasures and make no further progress in merit. When their years are exhausted, they return to the world below, cycling through rebirth. Some, moved by vows, petition to be born in the world to save beings and establish merit, diligently practicing the Supreme Dao—these are no ordinary people. Ordinary people neither perceive nor recognize them; even if they recognize themselves, they do not speak of it.

Yet such persons cannot escape misfortune: their kin may decline or perish, their bodies may be afflicted by illness, or they may encounter public or private disputes, hidden or manifest calamities, evil men, hideous ghosts, venomous beasts, birds, or insects, or harm from metal, wood, water, fire, earth, or plants. This arises because their merit is not yet complete, and their reception of the Dao is not yet perfected. They must swiftly purify themselves through fasting, examine their conduct, repent of transgressions, and pray for blessings. They should concentrate their essence on the Supreme, guard the One without forgetfulness, practice the Three and Five, and sincerely recall the Mysterious Master.

The Mysterious Master, the Lord of the Azure Lad, presides over all scriptures, treasured texts, and wondrous diagrams—all proceed from him. If scholars seek a master but do not meet one, or seek scriptures but do not obtain them; if they obtain them but not in full, or fully but without clarity; if they are clear but do not practice, or practice but not for long; if they err or forget, or recall but then suddenly lose it—these are the workings of deviant spirits or the trials of demonic forces.

They must swiftly choose an auspicious day, such as the day of *dingmao*, ascend a mountain, enter a chamber, purify themselves, and burn incense. They should petition the Supreme, sincerely visualize the Azure Lad, direct their minds eastward, and imagine the Palace of the Square Cauldron. Bowing their heads in reverence, they face the golden portals of the Highest Ministers, beseeching deliverance from misfortune and hardship. They perform the customary six bows, and upon completion, kowtow and secretly declare their苦志. Whether their troubles are public or private, or their minds are scattered and forgetful, they should state their wishes accordingly. They must address urgent afflictions first, not dwelling on lesser or delayed matters. If both urgent and minor concerns must be mentioned, they should write them in detail. After bowing, they read them silently, and if not finished, burn them afterward in the same manner.

If their qi and strength are abundant, they may perform twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, seventy-two, one hundred twenty, two hundred forty, three hundred sixty, seven hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred bows—completing them at once is best, as focused devotion yields greater benefit. Those unable to do so may perform one hundred bows from the hour of *yin* to *chou* (twelve hours). Others may perform at two hours, such as *yin* and *shen*, or *zi* and *wu*, as they are able. They should practice this once every sixty days, without shifting to other days or hours.

Three to five like-minded companions may join, but no more, to avoid noise and distraction, which would render their efforts ineffective. Advanced scholars must be meticulous and cautious. Only after practicing this method should they transmit scriptures as masters, ensuring the recipient is worthy—thus bestowing without regret.

If a master transmits scriptures to an unworthy person, or to one who, though worthy, does not follow the proper method, then within twelve ten-day periods, various disasters will converge. They must swiftly petition the Azure Lad, and though suffering may persist, they will also receive blessings, for which they should express gratitude.

After receiving the Dao, if one practices according to the method and remains free of illness for ninety days, this indicates that in past and present lives, they have accumulated goodness and are destined for immortality. If for four nine-day periods (three hundred sixty days) their public and private affairs prosper, this shows that their past and present merit is sufficient to align with the Perfected. After three cycles spanning four years and one thousand two hundred days, their merit flourishes, and both the hidden and manifest realms submit in reverence—this marks an advanced scholar of utmost diligence, destined for divinity.

They may then transmit the teachings, broadly delivering the worthy and enlightened, saving the common and the loving, establishing merit with a compassionate heart, and aiding all without selfishness. Thus, they ascend to the rank of the Most High Sage, Divine Perfected Immortal Lord, or the positions of emperor, king, duke, or minister.

If, after receiving the Dao, one encounters various hardships and illnesses within a hundred days, this reveals that in past and present lives, they have accumulated many transgressions and are not destined for immortality. They must swiftly repent, vow to reform their conduct, amend past wrongs, and cultivate future goodness. Relying on the support of masters and companions, they should cleanse their remorseful hearts, strengthen their sincere resolve, and cultivate reverence and unwavering faith—thus they will surely attain blessings and benefit.

For four nine-day periods and three cycles, they should follow this example: establish virtue, perform meritorious deeds, and avoid perilous calamities. They must remain vigilant and fearful, ever mindful of shame and caution, humbled by deep transgressions and ashamed of insufficient merit. They must not act as masters or transmit teachings carelessly. As their virtue gradually ascends, after five eight-year periods (forty years), they may then select a worthy recipient to initiate.

If, despite misfortune, one forcibly proceeds and rashly becomes a master, both teacher and disciple will lead each other astray—this is an evil karmic connection. Among those of sincere commitment, if one does not observe the fast, the master bears a karmic bond with them. They must pray and petition, confessing transgressions and seeking mercy with utmost sincerity, without pretense or carelessness—neither deceitful in heart nor insincere in speech. They must not boast of their merit to others, but remain devoted and discreet, so that both parties receive blessings. Advanced scholars must clearly understand and adhere to this.

As long as the cycle of birth and death continues, it is because the roots of transgression have not been eradicated. Moving from yin to yang, in motion and stillness, one commits many faults. When faults accumulate, death follows—a sorrowful suffering that the advanced scholar fears. They diligently study to seek liberation, receive scriptures, observe precepts, practice methods to avert calamity, resolve transgressions, and extend blessings, thereby ascending to the ranks of divine immortals.

Beginners must first confess transgressions and seek mercy, tracing back through beginningless kalpas to the billions of past lives and the seven generations of parents in this life. Good and evil are interconnected: if among the seven generations there are those who attained the Dao, or were worthy, enlightened, and talented, whose merit was manifest in the hidden and visible realms, then the residual blessings will dissolve transgressions. But if there are stubborn, violent, or rebellious ones, their collective misfortunes will be difficult to dispel.

Moreover, from one’s own existence through beginningless kalpas up to the seven generations of ancestors, there have been transgressions in yin and yang, some minor, some grave. Grave transgressions are difficult to dispel, while minor ones are easily removed. Those easily removed may be resolved through purification rites and merit-making, and in a short time, one may perceive a response. Those difficult to dispel require years of devoted austerity, yet still may not receive a sign. When no sign is received, one may grow lax and retreat, failing to recognize that the root of past offenses runs deep. Instead, one may resent the divine for lacking efficacy, thereby increasing karmic entanglements—such sins are unforgivable. Yet if one remains diligent, vowing never to slacken even unto death, good effects will surely follow, turning misfortune into fortune.

If among one’s past lives or ancestors there were many who accumulated merit, and one now adds to this with further cultivation, the fruition of blessings will come swiftly. Those who lack clarity may claim their virtue is insufficient to be deemed worthy, or dismiss attainment as illusory, or attribute it to spontaneity rather than disciplined practice. Such individuals cannot be taught; they forfeit the Dao’s affinity, becoming instead part of the demonic host, trapped in endless cycles of birth and death—deeply lamentable. Those of penetrating wisdom and resolute faith harbor no such doubts. They practice diligently without cease, and regardless of difficulty, through persistent accumulation over time, all may attain the Dao.

To attain the Dao and achieve longevity, one must practice goodness. Practicing goodness and ceasing evil requires a steadfast mind and unwavering resolve. In upholding precepts, one must ensure the Three Treasures remain unviolated and the Five Virtues undiminished. One should silently comprehend and secretly act, never forgetting through speech. Good and evil need not always be enacted; practicing goodness need not involve crowds. Yet crowds may suspect and mock, giving rise to doubt, jealousy, and calamity. Thus, even the sagely do not perform goodness on another’s behalf—knowing goodness as goodness yet still acting is not true goodness. One who knows goodness without boasting, without self-righteousness, without scheming, without considering it "good," and remains serene as if nothing has occurred—only then may one attain the Dao.

To those not of like mind, one must not recklessly speak. Teach only those who can be transformed; do not force it upon the unwilling. The swift may achieve it in four, nine, or three cycles; the slow in two, four, four, or six, extending to five or eight years—none fail to attain the Dao. Those who do not attain it do so because they receive the method but do not practice it, or practice without diligence, or practice without precision. Between them, they commit offenses, mingling good and evil, so that merit cannot redeem transgressions, nor virtue compensate for faults. After death, they may become good karmic connections, their affinity growing among ghosts. If they awaken in the unseen realm and establish virtue, they may become ghostly officials, accumulating merit to ascend as immortals, or become numinous beings, or be reborn into noble and virtuous families, free from worldly toil—yet they cannot attain the Dao in this very body.

If one betrays and slanders the teachings, initially accepting but later rejecting them, death will follow the demonic faction, severing all connection to goodness. That the connection to goodness is not severed stems from faith and devotion. Even if one’s faith and devotion do not reach perfection, as long as one does not waver or retreat in confusion, the affinity for goodness will grow day by day, and this growth, unceasing, will surely lead to true attainment. A true person may live four hundred years, four thousand years, forty thousand years, or even ten thousand kalpas. Each transmission has its own instructions. Beginners should take four, nine, or three cycles as their limit, adhering to the regulations on good and evil, and carefully avoiding reckless transgressions.

In studying the supreme Dao, one must settle body and mind. If body and mind are unsettled, study will yield no accomplishment. To accomplish study and enter samadhi, guarding the One comes first. Subtle and difficult to master, if one cannot maintain this guard, the mind will become entangled with other affairs. If one cannot enter samadhi through guarding the One, one should carefully observe omens, reflecting on oneself and others, noting differences in one’s own body and strange transformations in external things. Upon perceiving them, one should reform, applying methods and remedies to dissolve and dispel them. Only after no further anomalies occur may one enter samadhi, where the host of perfected beings will accompany one.

First, if the eyes appear hazy, the light unsteady, and what is seen unreal, indistinct, and unrecognizable, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youths of the eye’s spirit pathway, each three inches long, clad in five-colored garments. In each eye resides one, joyfully facing and approaching each other, traveling from east to west, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. After a long and focused visualization, cease, then resume. Practice this twelve times daily until one can go six days without sleep. Then the divine youths will manifest, and after one hundred twenty days, one will clearly see ten thousand miles away. After three hundred sixty days, one will foreknow fortune and misfortune, harmonizing one’s virtue with the divine. The sin arises from gazing upon improper sights and failing to behold the true and real. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Second, if the ears roar or ache with fullness, unable to hear distant sounds or distinguish speech, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the ear’s spirit pathway, eight inches and one fen long, clad in white, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the two ear cavities. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from delighting in lewd sounds and failing to heed sacred teachings. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Third, if the nose drips clear fluid or becomes congested and painful, unable to distinguish fragrance, or failing to detect odors, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the nose’s spirit pathway, two inches and five fen long, clad in black, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the two nostrils. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from craving rich and rare flavors and disliking fragrant aromas. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Fourth, if the mouth cannot taste, or the teeth, tongue, and lips ache, the throat feels uncomfortable, and eating and drinking are difficult, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the tongue’s spirit pathway, seven inches long, clad in red, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the mouth. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from delighting in flavors and harsh words, lacking plainness and sincerity. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Fifth, if the head suffers from pain, itching, or hair loss without regrowth, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the brain’s spirit pathway, one inch and one fen long, clad in blue-green, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the head.

Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from frivolity and offending superiors, failing to pay reverence to the Three Honored Ones. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Sixth, if the heart and abdomen suffer from vexation, discontent, twisting pain, hardness, distension, or indigestion, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the heart’s spirit pathway, *Daomingjing*, nine inches long, clad in multicolored robes, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the abdomen. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from restlessness, capricious joy and anger, neglect of purity and tranquility, and failure to dispel jealousy and contention. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Seventh, if the lower back, spine, hips, knees, shins, calves, or feet suffer from soreness, pain, sores, or difficulty in movement, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the rib-side’s spirit pathway, *Daocheng*, clad in variegated robes, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the lower back, spine, hips, knees, shins, calves, feet, and both rib-sides. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from over-exertion and disturbance, lacking steadfast dignity. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Eighth, if the entire body, both internally and externally, suffers from illness and distress, with no self-awareness, and shortness of breath, one should enter a purified chamber, burn incense, and visualize the divine youth of the skin’s spirit pathway, *Daolianjing*, one inch and five *fen* long, clad in cinnabar and white robes, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to the body’s interior and exterior to expel evil and establish correctness. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from killing, theft, lewdness, and ugliness, disregarding the true and upright. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

Ninth, if one suddenly falls ill or is bedridden with chronic disease, unable to recover, one should enter a quiet chamber, burn incense, bow the head, and visualize the divine youth of the kidneys’ spirit pathway, *Daosheng*, with the two kidney spirits, each two inches and three *fen* long, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, returning to fill the body. Cease when the visualization reaches its peak, then resume. Healing will follow the method above. The sin arises from cruelty, violence, and recklessness, failing to reflect and repent. By reforming and focusing one’s visualization, verification will follow.

The onset of these nine conditions will have its signs. Those skilled in divination may anticipate and prepare, naturally dissolving them and forever preserving purity and auspiciousness.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees murky *qi*, gloom, dry wells, filthy pools, excrement, blood, corpses, ghosts, or people engaging in lewd acts, the eyes are likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the eye spirit, rub the palms until warm, and press them over the eyes twenty-one times. Then, use the fingernails to pinch the inner corners of the eyes. If there is brightness and clarity, it is auspicious; if dark or black, it is inauspicious. By diligently visualizing, massaging, and pressing, and repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and hears strange sounds in the void—mournful, startling, or harsh—the ears are likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the ear spirit, cross the hands to cover the ears, press them twenty-one times, then cup the hands and listen quietly. Visualize hearing the music of the *Tai Shang Yun’ao* and the *Celestial Harmony*, gathering teachers and friends to discuss and recite scriptures. By repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and smells foul or unusual odors—fishy, pungent, or strange—with something entering the nose, whether dust, insects, or vanishing without trace, the nose is likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the nose spirit, cross the hands to pinch the nose, inhale and exhale sharply twenty-one times. By diligently tending incense, blending fine fragrances, and ensuring the smoke of *qi* is continuous without interruption, and repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees spoiled or rotten food, reviled by evil people, with the mouth moving, teeth aching, or speech becoming slurred, the mouth is likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the mouth spirit, curl the tongue to rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it twenty-one times. By reciting essential precepts, silently chanting mantras, consulting scriptures, and resolving doubts, and repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees dazzling lights, falling rain or snow, or falling from heights or overturned objects, the head is likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the brain spirit, rub the hands and massage the eyebrows, then traverse the *Mingtang*, *Dongfang*, and *Dantian* palaces on the forehead. Select water from the Eastern Well, blend it with fragrant herbs, and use it to wash and comb the hair, applying incense three times. By diligently repenting, gazing upon the Three Honored Ones, and repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees water or fire spreading uncontrollably, nets and snares crisscrossing, or boats and carts overturning, with naked figures fleeing in panic, the heart and abdomen are likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the heart spirit, cover the heart with the left hand and the navel with the right, close the eyes, hold the breath until the limit, then exhale gently. Repeat this nine times. By bathing with purity, tending the flame of continuity, strictly eliminating thoughts of killing, facing south in movement and stillness, observing light and admiring scenery, and ensuring one’s conduct is pure and upright, and repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees fighting, beating, carrying heavy burdens, falling and injuring oneself, soldiers collapsing, canes or punishments in motion, or yin and yang clashing, the waist, back, and joints are likely to fall ill. One should immediately visualize the rib-side spirit, cross the hands to cover the rib-sides, pinch them twenty times, swallow *qi*, and click the teeth twenty-one times each. Reflect on one’s conduct, correct any violations of precepts, perform acts of kindness, manage one’s affairs, admonish disputes, restrain speech, and control the body. Do not move recklessly; in walking, sitting, lying, or rising, be cautious and deliberate. Move slowly, observe carefully, and align the heart and body. By repenting one’s transgressions, there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees people flaying each other, consuming strange foods, or men and women in disorder, with yin and yang inverted, the body is likely to fall ill.

Immediately visualize the skin spirit, rub both hands together, and massage the entire body until thoroughly warmed, then cease. Repeat this process, completing three full cycles. Recite and study the precepts, delve deeply into profound teachings, dispel stagnation and resolve confusion, reduce desires and selfishness, repent one’s transgressions, and there will be no affliction.

Whenever one dreams or travels and sees people fleeing in panic, great floods or fires, birds and beasts in chaotic flight, bandits or drunken brawls, weapons scattered wildly, dogs or tigers chasing and biting, or unfamiliar people falsely claiming acquaintance—these all portend sudden illness. Immediately visualize the true spirit, apply the oral instructions for women, and alternately massage and grasp the Green Dragon and White Tiger twenty-one times each. Diligently follow the Mysterious and Plain, never betray the Yellow Writ, and when giving birth to children, strictly adhere to the master’s teachings. Repent one’s transgressions, and there will be no affliction.

Among these nine matters, with their myriad details, whatever one perceives while seated in stillness aligns with dreams and journeys. Carefully adhere to these principles, and all afflictions will naturally dissolve, rendering medicine and prayers unnecessary.

To dispel afflictions and purify the body, one must recognize the need for change and reform the mind. When the mind is upright, the body becomes pure; only then may one enter concentration. Through concentration, the Dao may be attained. Without concentration, the true cannot descend; without the descent of the true, how can the Dao be realized? The Dao is attained through the descent of the true, and the true descends through purity and uprightness. If one is pure and upright yet fails to attain the Dao, such a case has never existed.
