**The Pillow Scripture**

The Lord Lao said: The Great Dao is formless, ever dwelling in profound obscurity. It transforms in response to circumstances, answering to sincerity and devotion. If you can still your thoughts, you shall receive this true scripture. One who can uphold the One purifies mouth and body. Only then may you recite it, and ten thousand evils shall not arise. It can cure illness and prolong life. A hundred demons will not approach, and all malevolent spirits will be bound in form. The reason for this is that all sentient beings who receive this true scripture and attain long life further refine their bodies within. Constantly purify the three karmas and settle the six emotions. Naturally, the five spirits will guard the Three Ones. Whether sitting or lying, your hun and po will be secure. Peace and health will fill your days and nights. Recite it twice in the morning and three times in the evening. By reciting this scripture, your ears will hear clearly, your eyes will see brightly, your body will be strong, and your form will be light—just as described below. You should listen carefully.

The Lord Lao said: Within the body dwell thirty-six thousand spirits. On the left are the three hun, on the right the seven po. The body has one thousand two hundred forms and shadows, and ten thousand two hundred radiant essences. The five viscera and six bowels are governed by twenty-four spirits. You should constantly invoke them, never allowing them to leave your body. If afflicted by illness, call upon them thrice, and their true spirits will descend.

The Lord Lao said: If you wish to transcend the three disasters and nine calamities, you should speak thus: "I take Heaven as my father and Earth as my mother; I dwell between them, ever like a newborn child. The sun is my functionary, the moon my scribe. The messengers of Lord Thunder stand at my left and right, the Master of Winds and Master of Rains before and behind me. The Six Jia spirits encircle me, and the Directing Stars surround me. The Azure Dragon supports my left, the White Tiger my right. The Vermilion Bird leads before me, the Dark Warrior follows behind. The Northern Dipper covers my head, the Celestial Stem points to my feet. The Soaring Serpent coils in my hands, eliminating misfortune for me. I dwell within the cinnabar chamber, the Great One as my companion. Three on the left, seven on the right, nine above and one below. Two and four form my shoulders, six and eight my feet. I reside in the Central Palace, filling my abdomen. Now, a thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits, return each to your origin! Those who face me shall die; those who turn from me shall perish. Flee swiftly, hide in the depths! Heavenly soldiers and divine warriors, slay all inauspicious things. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*"

The Lord Lao said: When venturing outside, you should summon beasts to guard your body. The Azure Dragon emerges from my liver, standing at my left. The White Tiger emerges from my lungs, standing at my right. The Vermilion Bird emerges from my heart, standing before me. The Dark Warrior emerges from my kidneys, standing behind me. You four beasts, sharpen your teeth and claws, standing at my left and right, before and behind. Ward off all evil ghosts and demons, driving them a thousand *li* away. They must not rashly approach my jade chamber. Let my rest outside be peaceful, free from nightmares. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

The Lord Lao said: When the recitation is complete, you should return the spirits. The liver governs the hun, the lungs govern the po, the heart governs the spirit. The spleen governs the will, the kidneys govern the kidneys. The Azure Dragon returns to my liver, the White Tiger to my lungs, the Vermilion Bird to my heart, the Dark Warrior to my kidneys. The Yellow Dragon guards my spleen, filling my abdomen. All evil ghosts and demons may not descend to dwell there. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

The Lord Lao said: After returning the spirits, strike the heavenly drum thirty-six times and swallow saliva sixteen times. Then hold your breath, counting from one to ten in your mind, stopping when you reach nine. Visualize red qi emerging from your mouth like flames, circulating in all four directions, filling the room. When settled, inwardly contemplate, and you will naturally rest within. If you can do this constantly, you will forever be free from illness. A thousand demons and ten thousand specters will not dare to approach. Aligning with the Dao and uniting with the True, you shall enjoy long life and enduring vision. Your descendants will flourish in joy, and wealth and honor will daily increase. Golden chariots will enter your gate; official rank will rise to the Three Dukes. With a loyal heart and filial devotion, you will assist the August Thearch. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the edicts and ordinances of the Most High Lady of the Azure Realm!*
