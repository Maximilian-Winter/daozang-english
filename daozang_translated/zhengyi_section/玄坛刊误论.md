**The Rectification of Errors in the Altar of Mystery**
Compiled by Wuweizi Zhang Ruohai

Wuweizi, having long worn the cap and robe of the Dao, devoted himself to the practice of purification and cultivation. The rituals of the Three Caverns were his solemn duty, yet he merely followed convention without deeper inquiry. Where contradictions arose or doubts lingered, he found no master to consult, no authority to correct his uncertainties.

One day, a figure appeared—clad in rainbow sleeves and cloud-like sashes—claiming to have come from Tiantai and Siming. His bearing was refined and harmonious, his gaze solemn and upright. He gave no name, only the title "Master Guangyun," a man truly free and unfettered beyond the world. Well-versed in both Confucian and Buddhist teachings, he was also deeply learned in the scriptures and rituals of the Three Caverns. Thus, Wuweizi set aside his staff and rested, gaining the opportunity to accompany him. The master spoke of his travels: from the Central Plains to the rivers and lakes, from Ou and Min to Long and Shu, from sacred altars to numinous peaks—he had journeyed everywhere.

"In every place," he said, "I have witnessed the old rites of purification and offering overturned and misplaced. You have followed these errors in your practice—are you willing to accept reason and correct them?"

Wuweizi replied, "This humble one is dull-witted, yet I rejoice to hear your wise instruction." He bowed deeply in reverence, humbly seeking guidance. "Whatever faults you deign to point out, I shall inscribe upon my sash. The errors in the Altar of Mystery number twenty categories—matters that past worthies have never examined. Yet these mistakes persist and spread. For those who uphold the laws of the Three Heavens, I have titled this work *The Rectification of Errors in the Altar of Mystery*, that none may cling to delusion and depart from truth."

**Chapter One: On Entering the Chamber of Stillness**

Master Guangyun said: "When preparing for a purification rite, three days prior, the Daoist must enter the Chamber of Stillness within the purification hall. There, he washes his heart and spirit, stills his wayward thoughts, avoids impurity and defilement, refrains from listening to music, and steadfastly focuses his mind solely on the rites. Today, those Daoists who assist in the purification rites of officials may maintain purity and silence, inwardly facing the dawn. When they ascend the altar in haste, they avoid contamination, yet in matters of teaching and law, standards must still be demonstrated. Though inner virtue may be full, outward decorum must also be complete. If not for such discipline, how can one avoid confusion? How can one rise from the dust at dawn and mount the altar by dusk? Let them reflect—can your conscience be at ease?"

"If within a temple, three days may not be possible; one or two days will suffice. For rites held in lay households, entering the chamber for a full day and night is also acceptable."

Wuweizi bowed deeply and said, "I respectfully receive your instruction."

---

**Chapter Two: A Further Discussion on Entering the Chamber of Stillness**

Wuweizi addressed the master: "The matter of entering the Chamber of Stillness has long been neglected. If one’s sincerity is genuine, why insist on prior preparation?"

Master Guangyun replied: "This is the deceit of vulgar Daoists, misleading the equally vulgar—it is no sound argument. Consider this: when the state conducts sacrifices at the suburban altars or ancestral temples, the officials in charge—from the Minister of Rites to the Grand Commandant—observe a dispersed fast for four days and an intensive fast for three. After receiving the precepts, they do not mourn the dead, inquire after the sick, make music, review documents involving punishment or execution, carry out punishments, engage in impure acts, or enter the chambers of wives and concubines. On the night before the sacrifice, they lodge in the Ministry of State Affairs. The next day, the Censorate clears the roads. The paths to the suburban altars and temples are demarcated by the Gold Bird Guard, who forbid monks, mourners, and funeral carts from defiling the officials, lest they offend the august spirits. How much more should this apply to the Most High Three Pure Ones?"

Wuweizi said: "If this is the rule for official residences, then so be it. But in temples, Daoists each have their own Chamber of Stillness. Must they wait until the time of purification to enter it? Would that not be self-degrading?"

The master replied: "Not so. The Chamber of Stillness where Daoists reside is a place for rest, not for entering stillness to face the True. Now, in temples, there are halls such as the Hall of Refined Thought, the Hall of Concentrated Spirit, the Hall of Subtle Contemplation, and the Hall of Preserving the True—these are the true places for entering stillness. If one were to use one’s living quarters for this purpose, what need would there be for these halls?"

Wuweizi said: "Truly, your words are correct. Henceforth, I dare not fail to follow them."

---

**Chapter Three: On the Recitation of Precepts and the Assignment of Duties**

Master Guangyun said: "Before the purification rite, when entering the Chamber of Stillness for three days, the recitation of precepts and the swearing of vows take place on the first day. If entering for only one day, the recitation and vows occur at dawn on that day. The Daoist assembly gathers in the Dharma Hall, where the Master of the Mysteries initiates the *Natural Audience of the Numinous Treasure*. The High Priest then proclaims the precepts and vows, exhorting all to purify their minds and devote themselves to the rites, upholding the essence of the teachings and precepts. Afterward, the six offices are assigned, each to fulfill its duty without omission. Once the recitation of precepts and assignment of duties are complete, the supervisor of the purification rite posts the list of duties in the purification hall."

"Now, I observe that in purification rites, the Daoists gather on the day of the rite and proceed until nightfall. Before the Master of the Mysteries, the sponsor presents the petition, and after the master’s announcement, they ascend the altar to perform the rites. Only after the Great Thanksgiving do they turn to the Cavern Tablet to recite the precepts and assign duties. This is to perform the rites first and assign duties afterward—how grievously inverted!"

Wuweizi carefully examined this ritual and only then realized the errors of past practices. From this time forward, he resolved to adhere to the correct order.

---

**Chapter Four: A Further Discussion on the Recitation of Precepts**

Wuweizi, with solemn demeanor, again addressed the master: "The practice of reciting precepts after the Great Thanksgiving has persisted for a long time. To change it now—is there justification?"

The master exclaimed: "What words are these? What words are these? If a practice is improper, why cling to the old? Sit again, and I will tell you. The rites for facing the True are akin to the state’s sacrifices, though the offerings of incense, vegetables, and sweet wine differ. Seven days before the sacrifice, the Grand Commandant gathers the officials in the Ministry of State Affairs to recite the precepts, declaring: 'On such-and-such a day and month, there will be a sacrifice at such-and-such a temple. Each shall perform his duty. Those who fail to fulfill their roles will face the standard penalties of the state. Should any omission occur, punishments will be meted out after the sacrifice.'"

The matter has never been heard of—correcting the officiants only after the sacrifice has concluded. Yet now, after Daoists ascend the altar and perform the Great Thanksgiving, when the day’s ritual is complete, they proceed to recite the precepts anew. To listen to these precepts is no longer in accord with the spirit of the fast. From the moment of first entering the Dao and receiving ordination, the sequence of the precept-text has been disordered, its order inverted. This is surely because past generations failed to revise and correct it, blindly following flawed regulations, thus passing down this erroneous version to later ages. Though it is said that eminent masters of the Dao have once examined and collated it, I do not believe it. It is as if a noble lord or appointed official were to receive his commission only after assuming office. You need only consult sound reasoning, and those who uphold principle will surely roll up their sleeves on my behalf.

Upon hearing this truth, Wéiwēizǐ realized his former error.

**On the Rite of Offering Incense (Fā Lú Pǐn) Fifth**

Master Yúnguāng said: The rite of offering incense is when the High Ritual Master, facing the Three Clarities, holds the censer and declares the purpose of the fast. The invocation reads:

> To the Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Three Qi of the Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord, and the Jade Sovereign of Spontaneous Nature—
>
> Your servant now acts on behalf of the disciple of the Great Dao, [Official Title] [Name], who undertakes this [type of] fast for [such-and-such] purpose.

This is the Ritual Master’s direct address to the Primordial Ancestor of the Original Sovereign. There is none higher than the Three Clarities, and thus no other sages are invoked alongside them.

Yet today, when Daoists perform the fast, they invoke the Supreme Three Heavens, the Mysterious Origin, the Three Qi, and the Supreme Venerable Lord, commanding them to summon the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right envoys within one’s own body—thereby making the Supreme Venerable Lord call forth the deities within oneself. They further command the local earth deity to swiftly prepare and attend the declaration, stating: “Your servant now undertakes this [type of] fast for [such-and-such] person.”

Yet the altar is modeled on the Three Heavens, its tiers constructed accordingly. When the Ritual Master ascends the altar, he stands above the Three Heavens, directly addressing the Celestial Worthy in audience. How can he then summon the deities within his own body or call forth the earth deity to witness the merit? Is the earth deity even permitted to ascend the altar of the Three Clarities? Moreover, the phrase “prepare swiftly” risks exposing what should remain concealed—truly laughable!

Furthermore, when a Daoist receives the registers of the Dao, even the lowest-ranking community earth deity of the Nine Provinces is not permitted to enter the sacred precincts, lest it disturb the harmony between spirits and deities. Now, to summon the earth deity to ascend the altar of the Three Clarities—where is it to be accommodated?

It is as if, during an imperial audience, a minister were to order his attendants to summon a street constable or market official to stand upon the vermilion steps and witness his achievements. Is this permissible? Or is it not?

Wéiwēizǐ bowed deeply in reverent listening, his shame so profound that sweat drenched his robes. He had never before realized the errors of past generations.

---

**On the Rite of Repentance (Fāng Chàn Pǐn) Sixth**

Master Yun’guang said: When the Dharma Master offers incense to the Ten Directions, he first descends the true *qi* of the Ten Directions, which ascends from below to above before reaching the presence of the Most High of Supreme Clarity. In all petitions addressed to the Three Clarities, one does not concurrently invoke the honorific titles of the myriad Celestial Worthies—this is solely to honor the Three Clarities, for just as a land has no two kings, the exalted admit no dual supremacy.

Now, those who perform purification rites, after reciting the invocation and offering the Three Incenses, proceed to pay homage to the Ten Directions and perform repentance and thanksgiving—this is erroneous and without basis. When entering the oratory, Daoists regard the *Zi Ran Chao* of the Numinous Treasure as the progenitor of all purification rites. Since all such rites derive from the *Dongxuan Lingbao* canon, it is rightly deemed their ancestor. Homage to the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions, or concurrent repentance and thanksgiving, should take place not upon the altar but within the Dharma hall. The repentance texts, whether inscribed on paper or wooden tablets, are placed before the incense tables of the Ten Directions; they ought not to be recited in sequence during the audience, nor should prayers be directed to the Celestial Worthies of the lower realms.

Yet some further bow to the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the Five Marchmounts and grotto-heavens; the Three Rivers and Four Seas; the Nine Jiang Water Sovereigns; the upper and lower realms; and the scriptural treasures—also accompanied by repentance texts, collectively termed the Twenty Directions. Still others contrive further elaborations: when chanting the litany, they prostrate nine times to the east, three to the south, seven to the west, five to the north, three to each of the four intermediate directions, thirty-two to the upper realm, and twenty-four to the lower—this is an egregious departure from proper order. While the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and the sun, moon, and stars may be accorded some deference in the presence of the Three Clarities, the deities of the Five Marchmounts and water palaces are most unseemly. Moreover, to omit homage to the Five Marchmounts beyond the seas reveals a narrow and partial view.

It is as if, when a minister addresses the throne to present a matter, or when the matter concerns the chief minister, he must wait until the court has retired, then proceed to the administrative hall or the minister’s residence to make his report—how could he turn his head during the audience to address the chief minister? The Three Clarities are as emperors, the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions as ministers; in heaven as on earth, the hierarchy of honor and subordination remains unchanged. To recite repentance texts to the Ten Directions is thus improper in principle.

Wéiwēizǐ withdrew to reflect on these words, finding the distinction between high and low most apt, and dared not but heed them.

**On Abandoning the Superfluous and Embracing Simplicity, Seventh**

Wéiwēizǐ addressed the Master: Though I have heard the reasoning regarding repentance rites, such practices have long been in use—will others follow if we change them?

The Master replied: Ritual is founded upon reverence, not upon elaboration. The texts of repentance rites were composed by later generations; though their diction may be ornate and their allusions refined, how can one make the Most High linger, awaiting the recitation of prayers from the lower realms? This is most unseemly. In ancient times, when Ji Wenzi performed sacrifices, he continued them by torchlight; the officiants, leaning on staffs, conducted the rites, and though their hearts were solemn and reverent, they were nonetheless weary. Another day, when Zilu assisted at a sacrifice, he began at first light and retired at dawn. Confucius sighed, saying: “Who would say that You does not know ritual?” This is to value simplicity and reverence.

Now, when a three-day Daoist retreat is held, there are eleven morning audiences in all, yet the repentance rites occupy nine of them. The retreat’s sponsor and officials stand for long periods, leaning against the altar mats—how can they endure it? It would be far better to inscribe the repentance text and read it but once.

Wéiwēizǐ again addressed the Master: If, during the nine audiences, the text were read at each, would that be permissible?

The Master replied: If it cannot be avoided and the text must be recited, then during the three days and nine audiences, after the principal thanksgiving and closing audience, it may be read two or three times—provided the repentance texts are varied and the same text is not repeated over the three days. This neither prolongs the Dharma assembly nor wearies the retreat officials. Proceeding thus, what objection could there be? Ritual does not descend from heaven nor spring from the earth; it is tempered by human sentiment. If elaboration is moderated with restraint, who would say otherwise?

Wéiwēizǐ bowed deeply and said: I shall act accordingly.

**On Prostration, Eighth**

Master Yun’guang said: Silent reverence in prostration requires no further embellishment. In all bending, stretching, kneeling, and rising, let inner devotion match outward form, so that inner and outer accord—this is what is meant by “the five limbs touching the earth.” *Qishou* is a single bow, the forehead touching the ground. *Dunshou* is also a single bow, the head striking the ground. *Zaibai* is two bows. When *qishou*, *dunshou*, and *zaibai* are mentioned together, this signifies four bows. “With utmost trepidation” describes holding the tablet, bowing deeply twice while crouching, then rising to a kneeling position with the tablet held high, and after a moment, bowing deeply twice more before concluding.

Now, those who perform purification rites all say, “With utmost trepidation, *qishou*, *dunshou*, *zaibai*,” yet perform only three bows, merely fulfilling the count. Thus, they lack the reverence of the body fully prostrated upon the earth, and blindly follow one another, greatly diminishing the ritual.

Wéiwēizǐ said: From this time forth, I shall observe and practice this.

**On the Recitation of Scriptures, Ninth**

Master Yun’guang said: The scriptures are the teachings expounded by the Most High, which humans receive and uphold—whether cultivated in the person or in the state—this is the essence of revering the scriptures. In all purification rites involving scripture recitation, the proper setting is within the Dharma hall. The Dharma hall is the main hall of an abbey or temple; behind it lies the hall for expounding the Dharma, where the scriptural treasures are arrayed at the center, the Master of the Mysteries to the left, and the Celestial Master to the right. If the rite is held in a palace or residence, the space is arranged behind the altar, with offerings made to the Three Treasures, thus serving as the Dharma hall, with two lion thrones set to the left and right.

After each ascent to the altar and closing audience, the High Merit Dharma Master and the retreat officials proceed to the hall to open the scriptures. Once this is done, the Precentor and Scripture Attendants ascend their seats to expound the scriptural meaning and illuminate what has not been understood.

Thus, as stated in *The Simplified Text for Scripture Attendants*: "To guard the two lion thrones of the Masters" is precisely its intent. Yet those who conduct present-day retreat rites, after concluding each morning’s memorial audience, proceed to chant the liturgy and recite scriptures upon the altar itself—how meaningless this is! Moreover, before the scriptures are opened, there are incantations to be recited, which are meant for the Dharma Master’s silent contemplation alone. Now, however, the Daoist assembly, without awaiting the Dharma Master’s completion of his meditative recitation, immediately raises their voices in loud chanting—how contrary to proper order!

I, Wuweizi, humbly bear these fine instructions in mind and dare not let them fall into neglect.

**On the Rite of the Consecrated Altar (Chapter Ten)**
Master Yun’guang states: The "consecrated altar" originally refers to consecrated water—water infused with the true *qi* of the Five Directions and Five Dragons, used to dispel impurity and defilement. In sacred altars of abbeys and temples, or in the blessed lands of immortals, there is no need for such prohibitions and consecrations, for divine officials already stand guard. What impurity or defilement is there to dispel? The concern lies only in the preparation of retreat offerings and the comings and goings of people, which may attract impure *qi*, thus necessitating purification rites. When conducting a retreat in a palace or residence, however, the full rite of purification and prohibition should be performed, invoking only the descent of the true *qi* of the Five Directional Youthful Lords.

Yet those who conduct retreats today insist on declaring: "The Azure Youthful Lord of the East stands nine thousand myriad *zhang* tall, attended by nine thousand myriad officials." The Lords of the South, West, and North are likewise described in accordance with their directional *qi*—why then fix their height or restrict their number? They further proclaim: "Flying immortals, divine immortals, sun, moon, and stars, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, each with armies of a hundred million cavalry"—how excessive this is! They claim that a single *chi* of cloud can cover three layers of a roof, encircling the altar thrice—yet when the Three Clarities’ numinous altar is already erected, why must divine officials be summoned to cover it? They speak of "spreading a celestial net above and an earthly net below"—why then, atop the Three Clarities’ altar, must nets be spread anew? Such vulgar and coarse language—let it be cast aside!

I, Wuweizi, enlightened at once, bow in reverence and receive this teaching.

**On the Offering Altar (Chapter Eleven)**
Master Yun’guang states: The term *jiao* is another name for sacrifice. Sacrifices involving meat are called *ji*, while those with vegetarian offerings are called *jiao*. In all retreat rites, offerings are first made to the Three Clarities of the Highest Realm, then to the Ten Poles and all Perfected Ones, and finally to the Five Emperors, the Three Officials, and the ranks of divine immortals and numinous officials. For three days and nights, incense, lamps, banners, and flowers are arrayed, and offerings are made to each station. Why then, on the day of the dispersed retreat, are wine and *jiao* rites offered to the numinous officials? If performed before the retreat’s dispersal, it disrupts the order of precedence; if after, it interferes with the protocol of the divine retinue. Since the Celestial Perfected already partake of the retreat’s offerings, why should the numinous officials require wine and *jiao*? Instead, on the morning following the retreat’s dispersal, offerings of *jiao* delicacies, tea, and broth may be made at the station of the numinous officials—this suffices.

Those of discernment should harbor no doubts on this matter.

Wuweizi asks: Since wine has long been used in *jiao* rites, can it be abruptly abolished?

The Master replies: If a *jiao* feast is set independently, it follows its own liturgical protocols, distinct from retreat rites, and does not require wine or dried meats—what objection could there be? Yet for three days, the numinous officials of the retreat altar receive offerings of fragrant rice. How could they not follow the divine carriage, lingering to break the retreat’s fast? Even among common folk, such conduct would be improper. Ensure all matters are just and fitting; do not heed the vulgar.

I, Wuweizi, receive this teaching and will forever bear it in mind.

**On the Three Days and Four Nights (Chapter Twelve)**
Master Yun’guang states: In retreat rites, when it is said that the Dao is practiced in nine periods, this refers to three days and four nights. Including the rites of merit and the presentation of memorials, the total is eleven audiences. The nine audiences consist of: the first night, continuing until the fifth watch and the retreat hour of the following day; the second and third days each constitute three audiences, totaling nine. The audience on the third night is called the "rite of merit." At the fifth watch of the fourth day, the "rite of presenting memorials and bearing gratitude" is performed, making eleven audiences in all.

Yet those who conduct retreats today perform eleven audiences without distinguishing between the rites of merit and the presentation of memorials. On the fourth day, they further recite the *Supreme Retreat Petition*, announcing the dispersal of the retreat—this makes twelve audiences. Why such excessive repetition?

Wuweizi says: Your humble disciple, ignorant and dull, humbly receives this enlightening instruction.

**On Chanting the Dao and Ascending the Altar (Chapter Thirteen)**
Master Yun’guang states: In every retreat, before ascending the altar each morning, the Dharma Master and the officials stand before the Master of the Mysteries. After the High Merit Dharma Master makes his announcement, the Precentor chants: "All in the Dao assembly, each direct your mind, take refuge in the Three Treasures, and praise and practice the Dao." The phrase "each direct your mind" instructs the Dharma Master and retreat officials to focus their minds on the Mysterious Ultimate, visualizing the august presence of the Celestial Worthy. The intent lies in silent contemplation and inner reflection, not in competing to chant aloud in unison.

Yet those who conduct retreats today fail to grasp the Precentor’s meaning, do not follow the rule of visualizing and directing the mind, and instead raise their voices to recite merits and virtues, disregarding the hierarchy of the sagely and divine ranks. Moreover, each time they ascend the numinous altar, they should begin at the Earth Gate, circumambulate upward, and upon concluding the audience, descend from the Heavenly Gate. Yet those conducting retreats today ascend and descend solely through the Earth Gate, never treading the Heavenly Gate. Not only will the numinous officials punish such conduct, but the discerning will also ridicule it.

I, Wuweizi, bow my head in reverence and humbly bear these enlightening words in mind.

**On Recitations Before and After Retreat Meals (Chapter Fourteen)**
Master Yun’guang states: Whenever entering the hall to take one’s seat, whether before the retreat meal or the congee, first perform the purification, then offer incense. After unfolding the cloth, present the offerings. When the Precentor strikes the chime three times, the Dharma Master silently recites the *Birth-Incantation*, then the chime is struck twice more—this signals the beginning of the meal. After the meal, the chime is struck three times. The Precentor then leads the hymns of praise and the dedication of merits. Once the hymns conclude, the retreat officials rise.

Yet those who conduct retreats today, after the meal or congee, recite merits and virtues, invoking first the Three Clarities of the Highest Realm, then the Five Emperors, the Three Officials, the Perfected Immortals, divine immortals, and numinous officials—this is excessive indeed!

And when the retreat officials ascend the altar to present their memorials, none fail to conduct themselves with solemn reverence—robes and caps immaculate, bearing themselves with utmost care before the celestial throne, ever fearful of lapses in decorum. How then can they, in the midst of seated feasting, recite the names of the Most High Sagely Celestials, claiming such recitation as the dedication of merits to bless the retreat’s patrons? Do they not realize that the merits of day-and-night devotions lie precisely in their unceasing observance? Must they wait until sated with food before invoking the sagely and perfected once more? They vie only with the Buddhist clergy, heedless of incurring heavenly censure.

Master Wuwei, suddenly perceiving his past errors, prostrated himself in repentance.

**Chapter Fifteen: On the Retreat Patron’s Intent and Petitions**
Master Yun Guang declared: For a retreat lasting one day and two nights, three days and three nights, or seven days and seven nights, the petitions must be changed daily. Though the intent of the retreat remains constant, the wording of the petitions must vary; the same text cannot be recited repeatedly from beginning to end.

At the retreat’s commencement, the first petition should outline its general purpose and objectives, without yet making any supplications. The next petition may then reveal the intent of prayer and entreaty. The final petition should begin with an apology for having wearied the sagely ears with importunity, followed by expressions of gratitude for the received blessings.

Yet those who conduct retreats today, regardless of duration, cling to a single text, reciting it over and over—does this not weary the listeners? Consider the analogy of an earthly sovereign: if a minister presents a memorial, then submits another, can he simply reuse the same words? Even for a single petitioner, this would be improper; how much more so when addressing the Three Treasures?

Master Wuwei bowed his head in reverence, vowing to heed this enlightened instruction.

**Chapter Sixteen: On the Standards of Teaching and Transformation**
Master Yun Guang declared: The standards of teaching and transformation are the models bequeathed by the sages. *Teaching* means to instruct; *transformation* means to change. It is to broadly propagate the teachings of the Most High and widely transform the natures of humans and gods. Once teaching and transformation are disseminated, standards are established—these are the rules and systems. Once standards are set, regulations follow. Regulations serve to examine conduct; once regulations are established, precepts are set. Precepts serve to examine the mind; once precepts are set, deportment is established. Deportment inspires awe and provides a model. When deportment is fully realized, every movement—whether bowing, advancing, or retreating—every step in measured procession, every preservation of authenticity and contemplation of the Dao, every ascent of the altar to present memorials, every prostration and reverent bow—must be flawless to accord with the standards of teaching and transformation.

Moreover, the profound and wondrous teachings of the Dao align with the principle of emptiness and non-being. How can one disregard the classical precedents and indulge one’s own whims?

Master Wuwei bowed his head and received the command.

**Chapter Seventeen: On the Use of Music in Retreats**
Master Yun Guang declared: When conducting a retreat and performing the Daoist rites, it is called *courtly reverence*. Once the rites are observed, music must also be complete.

When music is performed at the Circular Mound, the celestial spirits descend; when performed at the Square Marsh, the earthly deities ascend. The drums harmonize the eight winds, and the melodies regulate the four seasons. The performance of rites and music serves to communicate with heaven and earth and commune with the divine.

According to the immortal scriptures, on the Jade Capital Mountain, the assembly of celestial sages and perfected beings performs the grand music of the Celestial Court, striking cloud-chimes, blowing red flutes, accompanied by phoenix dances and crane songs, with rainbow banners and feathered canopies, burning incense and offering flowers, chanting the *Step-Void Hymns* as they circumambulate the Heavenly Worthy—such is the proper observance.

Nowadays, the music performed at suburban altars and ancestral temples extols only the virtues of ancestors, with no other lyrics. Even commonplace words are unfit for the royal court; how much more so before the Jade Emperor and Supreme Deity?

Master Wuwei asked: In today’s temple halls, a profusion of miscellaneous music is presented—songs of Ba and dances of Yu, all intermingled. If even secular verses are not excluded, how can the *Step-Void Hymns* remain unsullied?

The Master replied: When the emperor feasts his ministers, it is called *displaying benevolence*, and even performances by jesters or vulgar songs of Ba may be presented. But the lyrics for suburban altars and ancestral temples are nothing if not refined and elegant; how could coarse and base words be permitted in the sacred music? How much less before the Celestial Worthies and Perfected Immortals, where only the language of the common world is used—this is utterly improper.

Master Wuwei, having heard this principle, withdrew.

**Chapter Eighteen: On Open-Air Altars**
Master Wuwei addressed the Master: When a roof is constructed over an altar, it is called the *Terrace of Myriad Wonders* or the *Terrace of the Void Sovereign*. Master Du of Guangcheng has discussed this thoroughly. Yet in ancient times, all palaces and temples had open-air altars, and even today, the four suburban altars of the state remain open to the sky. Though practices have changed, they do not fully accord with antiquity. I humbly request your instruction.

The Master replied: I have no quarrel with Master Du’s discourse. However, the state’s various altars are used for sacrifices at fixed times; if rain soaks the participants and disrupts their composure, the rites must be abandoned. Nowadays, palaces and temples are built for the people, often through great effort. If rain disrupts the retreat, would this not impose an even greater burden on the patron? Yet if sincerity ascends unimpeded, what harm do layered eaves pose? Open-air and covered altars do not hinder one another.

Master Wuwei, having heard these words, declared: This truly accords with my heart.

**Chapter Nineteen: On the Merits of Sitting and Standing**
Master Wuwei addressed the Master: In today’s palaces and temples, the Three Worthies share a single hall, seated together, and even the Three Officials and Five Emperors are all sculpted in seated postures. If they were all made to stand in attendance, would this be proper?

The Master replied: The distinction between sitting and standing is not difficult to clarify. Within palaces and temples, each deity has its own courtyard. Consider the analogy of an earthly emperor: he has his own private chambers, while the Three Dukes and Four Ministers each have their own halls. As for the myriad officials, they each attend to their duties; when not in court, why must they stand at attention? Yet on the day of the imperial audience, when ranks are arrayed and all hasten to attend, how could the Three Dukes and ministers face one another while seated?

The so-called distinction between sitting and standing is not difficult to clarify—it lies precisely here. However, within palaces and temples, wooden and clay sculptures cannot be altered for sitting or standing at will. If the images are painted, then in a single altar’s merit-making, all should stand in attendance, for this accords with the rites of hierarchy and human sentiment.

The Master of Subtle Awakening bows his head in reverence to receive your instruction.

**Chapter Twenty: On the Ranks of Ritual Feasting**

The Master of Subtle Awakening addresses the Teacher, saying: "In the feasts of present-day emperors, even the myriad officials are permitted to be seated. How then can it be that at the Three Clarities’ ritual repast, they must stand with hands clasped?"

The Teacher replies: "The rites of attending court in the human realm, where the master of ceremonies distinguishes ranks, are no different from the rites of paying homage to the Three Clarities—this is called *audience*, not *feast*. Once the ritual repast is set forth, one retires from audience to partake in the meal; what hindrance is there in this? Yet before the Three Honored Ones, one must not fail to stand in attendance. When measured against the *Comprehensive Mirror*, these words are surely verified."

The Master of Subtle Awakening withdraws in silent reflection.

Someone later said to the Master of Subtle Awakening: "The rituals of fasting and offering have been transmitted for ages, and your present critique, though refined and just, may yet be met with resistance. For there are still shallow-minded men and vulgar sorts who cling to false doctrines, refusing to trust authoritative teachings. Given the weight of custom and the long-entrenched errors of the multitude, how can the principles you have received ever be put into practice?"

He answered: "I received this from the Master of Universal Dao, and have tested it against the judgment of learned gentlemen. Since it is deemed fitting, why should I fear the words of others? If it accords with the Perfected of Heaven above, what concern have I for worldly opinion? I hope only for the discernment of those who fathom the mysteries, and pray it will not incur reproach.

Written on the Lantern Festival of the eighth year of Tianfu, at the Purple Ultimate Palace in Changsha, to be circulated among fellow Daoists. May it serve to correct errors, spare the learned from censure, and dispel the ignorance of our followers."

*On Correcting Errors in the Ritual Altar*—concluded.
