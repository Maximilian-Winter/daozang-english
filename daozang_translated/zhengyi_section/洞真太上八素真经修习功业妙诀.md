The Four Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate respectfully inquired of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao: "We have received the methods and transmitted the scriptures, and have heard the teachings. But in the stages of cultivation and practice, where does one begin?"

The Lord of the Dao replied: "For those in the initial stages of learning, they should enshrine the scriptures in a separate chamber, upon a table or desk, and morning and night offer incense, lamps, and reverent contemplation, paying homage at dawn and dusk to what they have received.

The lofty and exalted adapt to circumstances in their practice, for the precepts and methods vary, each contained within the scriptures. Some are to be transmitted orally, depending on the individual.

If a disciple neglects the morning rites, they will repeatedly incur disrespect and humiliation, and their merit and practice will not flourish. If one truly aspires to attain perfection, they must not neglect the morning rites. If karmic obstacles arise, preventing consistency in day and night practice, one must not fail on auspicious mornings, for there will naturally be responsive effects.

I reiterate this for your benefit, to ensure it is entrusted to the right person."

The Perfected Ones bowed their heads, received the command, and vowed to follow it.

In all meritorious practice, one must diligently study the scriptures and edicts, uphold the essential precepts, recite them from memory, and contemplate their meaning with unwavering resolve. Without slackening or retreating, one must advance with daily renewal, adapting to the teachings of the age and acting in accordance with the times.

The scriptures of the Three Caverns will alternately emerge and recede; one must follow the flow to aid in urgent matters, never forcibly resisting conditions. The application may be high or low, but it must not be suppressed or cut off. Circumstances may require ascending or descending, but nothing should be discarded. One must seek the middle way, neither blocking nor forcing passage. If passage is forced yet remains obstructed, whether in the high, low, or middle, inversion and opposition will bring calamities and trials—this must be carefully considered.

When the great cosmic forces are harmonious, proceed according to rank and order. On inharmonious days, each receives a lesser portion. Depth and quantity must not transgress the stages. Advancement depends on conditions, but one must not act contrary to the cosmic flow. With focused intention and strict adherence to the precepts, one may aspire to perfection.

The fasting precepts number ten:

1. Do not consume beings containing blood or life-*qi*, nor anything pungent or sudden, except for vegetables, which may be eaten except during the months when they face their growing season.
2. At dawn, take congee; at midday, take a meal. Thereafter, all rich, sweet, or fine flavors must not be consumed again. By day, burn incense; by night, light lamps. Incense must not be lacking even for a moment, and in sitting, rising, lying, or resting, one must not depart from the Dharma.
3. Abandon all worldly entanglements and devote oneself solely to the Dao.
4. Reflect on the scriptures and precepts, purify the mind, and advance with diligence.
5. Be compassionate and filial toward all, pity the suffering and poor, reveal the path of life, and exhort the ignorant.
6. Repent and confess transgressions, seeking deliverance from hardship.
7. Forsake glory and splendor, treasuring only the Dao.
8. Labor the body and endure hardship, serving the Dao.
9. Vow to alleviate all pains, the ten sufferings and eight adversities, deliver beings from the perilous age, and become a seed of Great Peace.
10. Honor the Dao and esteem virtue, ensuring one’s words and heart align. Purify the mind and advance with diligence, aspiring to join the company of immortals. Receive the scriptures and precepts without daring to transgress, so that on the day of ascension, one may unite with the Dao.

The exalted precepts state: "The supervisor of the fast, along with the officiating officials, recites scriptures and performs the Dao. When ascending the high seat to recite a thousand words of scripture, they may receive one drink—this does not apply to those who do not recite."

This clause is from the *Middle Section of the Luminous Precepts of the Four Poles*.

---

The exalted precepts further state: "Those who receive the governance of the stellar lodges, or who uphold the scriptures and methods of the Three Treasures, the *Mysterious Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*, and who participate in the rites after receiving the fasting precepts, must all receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial. Those who do not receive these Five Precepts may not be included among the ranks of fasting officials or recorded in the registers.

Those who have received the *True Contract of the Three Ones* or the *True One* and above, yet do not receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial, may not have their names listed in the Upper Palace, nor may they submit memorials on the stellar lodges’ grand petitions. If one submits a petition without having received the precepts, their name will not be recorded in the Immortal Capital, and the petition will not be presented to the throne. The reason is that without the Dharma’s regulations, the body is not pure and upright, and thus it cannot be presented to the throne.

Moreover, the officials of the stellar lodges do not accept petitions from masters who have not received the precepts and lack integrity. Therefore, there are major and minor precepts and regulations, each to be followed accordingly."

Fasts are of five types, as follows:

1. **Emergency healing of illness**, following the teachings and methods of the Celestial Master. This includes entering the Three Primes to repent, seeking life and sustenance, binding oneself with mud on the forehead, and the methods of covering in ashes—all are within the Celestial Master’s teachings.
2. **The Brahmanic conduct of the Numinous Treasure**, gathering the worthy to observe transformation, cultivating the body and planting blessings. Within this are methods for repenting the sins of life and death, holding oneself accountable, and reflecting on transgressions.
3. **The reclusive immortality of the Highest Clarity**, a fast for the ascension of the seven generations of ancestors, also practiced according to the monthly ordinances and virtuous conduct.
4. **The True One’s guardianship of quiescence**, a fast of meditating on the spirits, swallowing *qi*, and guiding and pulling.
5. **The Divine Elixir of the Great One**, methods for offering to the furnace and fire, the Golden Liquor, and month-long seclusion in a chamber.

Other practices, such as secluded tranquility, nurturing the spirit and extending life, chanting in purity, and prolonged fasting, are not included in these five categories.

---

Furthermore, Daoist masters, libationers, and male and female officials who have already received the *True Contract*, the scriptures of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, and the methods of stellar lodge governance, and who seek to have their names recorded in the Mysterious Capital and their memorials presented to the throne, must receive the Five Precepts of the Mysterious Capital’s Dharma Trial.

The text of the precepts is as follows:

1. **The first precept**: Do not fail to revere Heaven, nor claim that Heaven has no spirits. Do not call the Earth ghostless, nor treat the earth deities, mountains, rivers, and great marshes with disdain, digging and boring without restraint. To declare that Heaven and Earth are without numen is to commit a transgression without fear. Nor may one teach others to treat Heaven and Earth with disrespect, claiming there are no spirits or ghosts.

Violating this first precept incurs a deduction of three hundred years from one’s celestial allotment. A single transgression shortens one’s lifespan by seven years and obstructs affairs for seven years. One must examine one’s faults, reflect on errors, and establish merit to atone for wrongdoing. If one’s virtue surpasses that of the past, one may prostrate and swear three times, then petition to restore one’s former rank, reckoning merit to extend life. The Dao does not fail humanity.

**The second precept**: Do not kill living beings or destroy nests and eggs. Nor may one teach others to kill living beings or destroy nests and eggs. Violating this precept incurs a deduction of one hundred sixty years from one’s celestial allotment. A single transgression shortens one’s lifespan by five years and obstructs affairs for five years. One must examine one’s faults, reflect on errors, and establish merit to atone for wrongdoing, cultivating purity until attainment. If one’s virtue surpasses that of the past, one may prostrate and swear three times, then petition to restore one’s former rank, reckoning merit to extend life. The Dao does not fail humanity.

**The third precept**: Do not engage in deceit, theft, or avarice, nor covet others’ possessions or obstruct their aspirations. Nor may one teach others to steal, covet possessions, or seize what others cherish. Violating this precept incurs a deduction of one hundred twenty years from one’s celestial allotment. A single transgression shortens one’s lifespan by four years and obstructs affairs for four years. One must examine one’s faults, reflect on errors, and accumulate merit to cultivate virtue. If one’s virtue surpasses that of the past, one may prostrate and swear three times, then petition to restore one’s former rank, reckoning merit to extend life. The Dao does not fail humanity.

**The fourth precept**: Do not consume alcohol, commit adultery with others’ wives, engage in licentious conduct, or exploit public office for private gain. Nor may one teach others to drink, seduce others’ spouses, engage in licentious conduct, or exploit public office for private gain. Violating this precept incurs a deduction of one hundred twenty years from one’s celestial allotment. A single transgression shortens one’s lifespan by four years and obstructs affairs for four years. One must reflect on errors, examine one’s faults, and establish merit to atone for wrongdoing. If one’s virtue surpasses that of the past, one may prostrate and swear three times, then petition to restore one’s former rank, reckoning merit to extend life. The Dao does not fail humanity.

**The fifth precept**: Do not slander, envy, or poison others, nor engage in malicious scheming, harm the virtuous, or burn others’ dwellings. Nor may one teach others to slander, envy, or poison, engage in malicious scheming, harm the virtuous, burn dwellings, destroy gates and doors, or seek vengeance. Violating this precept incurs a deduction of one hundred twenty years from one’s celestial allotment. A single transgression shortens one’s lifespan by three years and obstructs affairs for three years. One must examine one’s faults, reflect on errors, and establish merit to atone for wrongdoing. If one’s merit surpasses that of the past, one may prostrate and swear three times, then petition to restore one’s former rank, reckoning merit to extend life. The Dao does not fail humanity.

As for Daoists and libationers who do not receive the Dharma precepts, neglect their Daoist conduct, and violate the various prohibitions, their memorials and petitions go unheard, and their attempts at deliverance often prove ineffective. This is because their practice lacks proper method and discipline, entangling them in the trials of wine and meat, the height of carelessness. Since the ascension of the Three Sages, the true statutes have fallen into obscurity, repeatedly subjected to the world’s disdain. The Dharma regulations have scattered, and ancient canons are no longer preserved. Even if libationers have not received the precepts, their names are already marked as universally forbidden in the registers. In recent times, when submitting memorials, inconsistencies abound, and many petitions to the celestial bureaus go unanswered or unvalidated. If one in a hundred proves effective, it is due to the sincerity of virtuous petitioners whose devotion moves the highest powers, prompting the Celestial Thearch to shield and permit their pleas. The merit lies in preserving life, not in the libationer’s memorials. Yet foolish masters, seizing upon the rare success of a devout petitioner’s earnest plea, claim it as their own achievement, then intimidate the people, making endless demands. Unaware of the hidden consequences, they incur indictments, have their names stricken from the rolls of the living, and their lifespans shortened, soon meeting an untimely end. Though minor transgressions may not immediately invite punishment, one should not assume Heaven and Earth are vast and overlook small faults. If one accrues minor merit, the reckoning of errors may be deferred, prolonging the delay. Those who escape minor trials do so because their hidden sins are grave, already marked for expulsion. Only after annihilation are they consigned to the torments of knife mountains and sword trees, hence the absence of minor trials. The foolish, unaware of this, assume their sins go unpunished, believing Heaven permits indulgence. They claim the heavens are boundless and do not scrutinize minor faults, thus incurring no reckoning. Utterly deluded, they compound their daily errors, even asserting that Heaven and Earth are without spirits. Those who warn them are dismissed as deceivers, unaware they are already marked for expulsion, their doom imminent and unforeseen. How can one deceive the luminous heavens? The foolish, ignorant of the Dao’s weight, regard it lightly. I grieve for them with a pained heart. Let each clearly discern and diligently cultivate goodness, avoiding greed and impurity, for the consequences of sin are not light.

The Highest Statutes state: Daoists and libationers, both men and women, who receive the true and ultimate Dharma, the precious scriptures of the Highest Dao, and the correct governance of stellar lodges, and who hold ranks of True Unity or above, must also receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial and the Great Precepts of Karmic Conditions, even if they are virtuous and devoted. Those who receive the ultimate Dharma but neglect these Five Precepts will not have their names inscribed on the cinnabar tablets of the Immortal Capital. Their names will be absent from the Jade Register and the Ink Ledger, and their ghostly names will not be erased from the White Records of the Three Offices. After passing, they will remain as lower ghosts, their souls denied immortality, subjected to endless trials, and their misfortunes extending to their descendants. The efficacy of Daoist devotees’ sincerity or negligence is addressed elsewhere, recorded after the Ink Ledger’s upper section.

The Highest Statutes state: Those who study the Dao should be diligent and earnest, establishing merit to atone for the sins of their seven ancestral generations, advancing the immortal names of their family and themselves, and escaping the ten sufferings and eight difficulties. They must receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial, establish merit and virtue, seek inscription in the Jade Register of the Immortal Capital, and erase their names from the White Ledgers of the Three Offices and the death registers.

You, as Daoist disciples, have received the great inner and outer true covenants of the Dharma, accumulating years of practice, yet your conduct does not align with the natural Way. Moreover, you have not accepted the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial, your bodies defiled by wine, meat, and greed, your Daoist practice devoid of method. Thus, you commit transgressions and evil, forfeiting your destined years and shortening your lives. Upon death, you become lower ghosts, unable to escape the torments of blade mountains and sword trees, the cruel agonies of boiling cauldrons—how grievous, how grievous indeed!

You who follow the Dao must clearly adhere to the precepts and laws, practicing diligently for three years without weariness, thereby gaining longevity and the augmentation of your heavenly allotment. The Heavenly Bureau reviews the Ink Ledgers thrice yearly, calculating merits to extend your destined years. The Director of Destinies submits these records above, distinguishing good from evil. Meritorious deeds are inscribed on the left covenant, while transgressions and unexpiated faults are recorded on the right—all matters made manifestly clear.

The Dao does not fail humanity; rather, few truly believe, while many violate the precepts and laws, thus incurring guilt and suffering punishment. Take heed, all of you, and be cautious in your conduct. Caution itself is virtue.

All Daoist priests, libationers, and male and female officials who receive the true Dharma, seek immortal deliverance, prolong life, uphold the precepts, establish merit to atone for transgressions, heal the people, and present memorials to the throne must engage in purification rites, observe the precepts, and not transgress the statutes. By fulfilling their vows, they may calculate their merits for promotion and ascension, their blessings and longevity boundless.

The Highest Statutes state: There are those born of noble rank whose conduct already aligns with the natural Way, though they have not received these precepts in writing. They need not undergo the formal precepts again. From ancient times to the present, such individuals exist, though in this age, scarcely one in a hundred may be found. They cannot be taken as a standard. Only those whose virtue and conduct conform to the precepts—those of lofty aspiration and unwavering resolve—may establish the Daoist enterprise through the precepts. Thus, the precepts and statutes must be proclaimed without fail.

The Highest Statutes state: All who wish to study the Dao and seek truth, establishing merit and virtue in the world, inscribing their names in the heavens, and ascending to the ranks of immortal officials must receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial. They must practice the Dao in accordance with the precepts for three years, establishing true merit before presenting a memorial to the Immortal Capital. Their names are inscribed on the Cinnabar Registers, recorded in the Jade Calendar above, and their immortal titles are established. The Director of Destinies issues decrees to the Five Peaks, notifying the Three Offices to acknowledge them as perfected persons, erasing their names from the White Ledgers of death and removing their ghostly designations. Only then may they rightfully be called Daoist priests or libationers in training.

Thus, their true names and diligent efforts are recorded in the Immortal Capital, and all their memorials are heard without obstruction. Those who neither receive the precepts nor practice with earnest diligence have no merit or name in the Immortal Capital. Their memorials and petitions are all suspended, their Daoist practice unrecognized. They merely waste the people’s offerings of paper, ink, incense, and oil, while enduring the trials of consuming wine and meat. Their souls are constantly subjected to litigation, and their worldly endeavors meet with misfortune.

Some may evade punishment for violating the laws, or their names may not yet appear in the death registers of the Three Offices, so they only encounter good fortune, with misfortune yet to befall them. Others may have long-standing grievances, and the examining officials deliberately obscure their judgment, compounding their offenses for severe adjudication. Thus, they avoid minor trials, only to accumulate impurities until they are driven to premature death. How lamentable, how lamentable indeed!

Novice Daoist priests, libationers, and male and female officials—you who wish to cultivate life, endure hardship in seeking truth, subdue ghosts, and heal illnesses with proven efficacy, revered by the people—must receive the Five Precepts of the Dharma Trial. Once received, your names are recorded in the Immortal Capital. After three years of diligent practice without violating the precepts, the Director of Destinies submits your merits to the Heavenly Emperor. Your names are inscribed in the Jade Calendar, and you receive the dispersed titles of perfected persons, capable of subduing ghosts and healing illnesses with unfailing efficacy. Such goodness—how can it not be cultivated?

Daoist priests, libationers, and male and female officials who wish to study the arts of subduing ghosts and healing illnesses must receive the Five Precepts of the Middle Terrace for Establishing Life. Upon receiving these precepts, their positions are rectified in the Immortal Capital, their names recorded in the Cinnabar Registers. After three years of meritorious effort, their names are inscribed in the Jade Calendar above. The Heavenly Bureau then reviews their merits, recording them in the registers of the mountains, rivers, Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and Three Offices. Knowing of your diligent accumulation of merit, your names are revered by the celestial deities of the Mysterious Capital and the earthly spirits of the Dark Capital, subduing all ghosts. Your healing and memorials ascend above, and you undertake great inner and outer affairs, mastering the wonders of the True Unity.

If you do not receive the Dharma Trial or heed the Five Precepts, you will have no position in the Immortal Capital, no name in the Jade Calendar. You will incur the sins of libationers who conceal defilement, disrespected by the gods of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, Three Offices, and all spirits. Your memorials will be suppressed and unpresented. For indulging in wandering alleys, greed, and defilement, refusing to reform your transgressions, violating the statutes and taboos, the Director of Destinies will impeach and report your deeds, diminishing your destined years.

Though you may be teachers of others, minor violations of the laws are not counted among the trials. If you show remorse, your offenses may be compounded for severe judgment.

Now, the foolish among men, deluded and blind, suppose that so long as their transgressions bring no immediate affliction, Heaven and Earth remain unaware of their sins, or even claim there are no gods—unaware that their hidden misdeeds have already been memorialized in the unseen courts. Though minor grievances may not be reported at once, this is but to accumulate their filth until the measure is full, whereupon they shall be swept away in the great purgation. Thus, their doom is sealed: no minor reckoning shall delay the final verdict. Suddenly, they are struck down in their prime, cut short before attaining the three spans of life. Their crimes compounded, they endure the torments of blade-mountains and fire-whirls, dying to become lowly ghosts, forever subjected to agony—how can this be borne?

You who have received the True Teaching, though outwardly you seek merit in healing and salvation, and inwardly aspire to refine the Three Origins, nurture the spirit, and prolong life, must first seek out enlightened masters and uphold the Dharma Precepts. Do not indulge in wine and meat, nor sink into dissipation, nor pursue wayward deeds. Every transgression, great or small, shall be impeached and reported. Only through dawn-to-dusk vigilance, accumulating merit to redress faults, and reverently awaiting the mysterious grace of the Dao may you halt the depletion of your years and await judgment.

Thus may you extend your life, restore your allotted span, and begin anew, where merit and fault offset one another in the most minute accounting. Take heed, all of you—take heed in your cultivation, that you may preserve your immortality.

The Highest Statutes decree: Daoists, libationers, and officials of both sexes—you who wish to refine the Divine Elixir of Great Clarity, master the arts of the Three Origins’ Yin and Yang, or seclude yourselves in mountains and marshes to contemplate immortality and nurture your resolve—must first receive the Five Precepts of Preserving Life. You must further endure the Seven Trials and Nine Refinements, crushing your nature to endure humiliation, bearing others’ scorn without resentment; and you must not entertain wayward thoughts or stray desires, but keep the spirit serene and undivided.

Once more, you must endure hunger and cold, bearing humiliation without resentment or faltering. You must accumulate diligent merit on a vast scale, rescuing those in dire straits and delivering lives from death, that you may receive the beginning of renewed existence. You must subsist on meager fare in utmost austerity, amassing hidden virtue until it shines forth, yet when Heaven has not yet repaid your merit, you dare not entertain hope. When your meritorious deeds and righteousness move all to reverence, when your accumulated diligence is great, yet your body is beset by hardship and ruin, when none near or far inquire after you, you dare not lament your plight. When vast kindness flows forth, yet you suffer further unjust humiliation without taking it as harm—such is the greatness of wisdom and virtue.

There are five virtues, and without profound devotion and earnest love, none can establish such conduct. Thus, they are called the Five Virtues, and their weight is most grave indeed. Those who study the Dao for years endure tenfold trials and ninefold humiliations, with filth and malice heaped upon them, yet still harbor the compassion of forbearance and meekness—this is the first wisdom. To practice vigorously and broadly, esteeming both inner and outer cultivation, nurturing the Three Origins so that the Five Spirits remain unharmed, advancing without decline, your countenance never withering—this is constancy, the second wisdom. To persist in cultivation without retreat, traversing the eight directions, now ascending in clarity, now descending in turbidity, now floating, now sinking, diligently serving the world without seeking record or fame, accumulating virtue without cease, and never daring to deem it labor—this is the third wisdom. To inwardly refine medicinal qi, embodying virtue to nurture your nature, turning through nine years, or even twenty-four, or up to thirty-two years, enduring hardship and proving your diligence, yet suffering unjust setbacks without reckoning or complaint, dwelling in tranquil serenity, never recording merit, yet ever more deeply concerned—this is the fourth wisdom. When your Daoist practice yields no worldly merit, when you have but briefly followed your master’s teachings and devoted yourself to their gate, yet midway encounter calamity, your true nature scattered and ruined, enduring ten thousand trials of forbearance, yet still maintaining a gentle demeanor, never grinding your teeth in anger—this is the fifth wisdom.

The Highest Statutes decree: All who study the Dao must guard their hearts with steadfast singularity, practice goodness with sincerity, and though they have not yet attained enlightenment, having endured the Seven Trials and Nine Tribulations without resentment or retreat, upholding the Five Precepts and aligning with the Five Wisdoms, never transgressing the precepts or neglecting the scriptures, dwelling in secluded tranquility and harmonious non-action—even after long immersion in the dust of the world, they do not reckon unjust humiliation; when encountering misfortune and adversity, they knock upon their breasts and beg forgiveness, enduring repeated hardships without resentment, instead ever more generously bestowing kindness, humbly entreating others, ever fearful of losing past merit and diligence, ever anxious that deep karmic obstacles may bring misfortune. Those who possess such towering virtue, whose merit is vast and boundless, never deeming it labor, purifying their elixir through austerity, ever more resolute, ever fearful of falling into the abyss, whether by morning or by evening—such wisdom is truly profound and great.

With such virtue and conduct, one may truly establish the Daoist path. After five years of practice, serene and free from desire, one may withdraw to the forests and secluded peaks to entrust one’s fate. You who seek the Dao and refine your life to extend your years among mortals must first dwell in seclusion, harmonizing your spirit and nurturing your resolve, guiding and refining the Three Origins, accumulating diligence with single-minded devotion. When the numinous perfected respond from on high, and your body is beset by misfortune, you do not seek redress; when unjust humiliation and adversity befall you, you remain joyful and composed, never taking it as misfortune. By practicing these Five Precepts and perfecting the Five Wisdoms, your Daoist conduct becomes pure, your merit towering and weighty—yet you dare not hope for reward, instead redoubling your courage and advancing with ever greater vigor, surpassing all you once could not. With merit thus accumulated, what could you not attain? What wish would not be fulfilled? What plea would go unheard? What aspiration would not be realized?

The Highest Statutes decree: Immortals have nine ranks, arts have thirty-six gates, and there are one hundred twenty prohibitions—all essential to the foundation of extending life. Yet there has never been one who, following the statutes and enduring hardship, did not attain their goal. The only obstacle is that practitioners lack diligence, their thoughts of the Dao are not single-minded, they lack constancy, and have no like-minded companions to share their resolve—how then can the Dao be cultivated? Some hear of morning deeds and expect evening rewards, lightly dismissing the true teachings as devoid of numinous response. Many are stingy and greedy, indulging in humiliation, sinking into the company of wine and meat, lacking the resolve to endure austerity for the Mysterious Origin. Their conduct is confused and disordered, their sins piled high in the celestial archives, their souls tormented and battered, suffering punishment in the earthly prisons—until judgment is passed. Thus, one must deeply reflect and reform, diligently practicing virtue with single-minded devotion to seek the efficacy of true illumination. Those of wisdom, hearing this, will practice it, reverently upholding the Five Precepts—is this not wondrous?
