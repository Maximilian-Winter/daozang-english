The *Celestial Sovereign Great One’s Divine Statutes for Avoiding Defilement Sutra* states:

In the celestial immortal realms, one avoids spiritual defilement. To nurture life and govern transformation, one avoids human defilement. By wielding sacred talismans and activating fire, one avoids heavenly defilement. By compounding medicines and refining elixirs, one avoids the defilement of rivers and streams. By dispatching talismans to command spirits, one avoids the defilement of childbirth. Through sealing and prohibitive methods, one avoids the defilements of the sun and moon. The origins of great defilements are briefly outlined here.

Those who seek immortality and seclude themselves to refine the golden elixir follow three thousand seven hundred and twenty methods, all of which proceed through this gate of prohibitions—none may fail even once.

The twelve defilements are all taboos of the Dao. If one engages in refinement during these times, the elixir will never be achieved, even after kalpas.

When the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir in the Central Land, the years, months, and days of the *chen* cyclical sign, as well as the years, months, and days of the *zi* cyclical sign—these twelve cyclical signs—were all times when no work could be done, and the elixir would not form.

When purple clouds first coalesce into the defilement of dragon and tiger, if swift thunder erupts on that day, the elixir cannot be formed—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of the sun and moon’s path, when the sun or moon is eclipsed, one must not seal the furnace or set the crucible—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of the celestial dragon’s conjunction, on the last day of the *chen* cyclical sign in the third month’s first third, and on the *chen* day of the last third, one must not refine the elixir—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of the Northern Dipper’s true movement, when the Dipper points to *yin* at dawn in the first month, the same applies to the twelfth month. It is also said: when the Northern Dipper is not visible, one must not refine the elixir—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of the azure celestial dragon’s conjunction, if red clouds appear in the sky or a dragon-shaped form emerges, one must not prepare medicines or seal the furnace. To violate this is like splitting clouds.

When the Grand Year resides in *mao*, and its spirit appears in *shen*, one must not refine the elixir—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of treasuries and sacred vessels: ancient tombs, lands without springs, places where licentious women dwell, birthing chambers, dragon abodes, ancient marshlands, old city encampments, former temple foundations, ancient markets, old spirit shrines, former prison grounds, and ancient cellar sites—none of these places may be used—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of celestial and terrestrial shooting stars, one must not refine the elixir in places where ancient immortals and sages once dwelled—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of yin-yang conjunction: in spring, *ding-mao*; in summer, *jia-wu*; in autumn, *geng-shen*; in winter, *ren-gui*—one must not refine the elixir during these times—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of the Jade Maiden’s pursuit: on every *ding* day of the sixth cyclical sign, one must not refine the elixir—this is forbidden to the Six Ding Maidens.

During the defilement of color: when morning clouds appear in the sky, one must not refine the elixir—this is forbidden.

During the defilement of celestial demons’ bloody battle: when stone drums resound like thunder, one must not refine the elixir on that day—this is forbidden.

When the earth spirits are startled and flee in panic, and the land trembles before falling silent, one must not prepare medicines for seven days. If violated, the elixir will flow into the Yellow Springs and dissipate entirely.

The above taboos and defilements, regardless of their scale, apply to all golden elixirs and medicinal substances—one must be vigilant.

Furthermore, use the seal of the elixir’s essence to stamp all medicinal mud, and apply it to the chamber and its contents. Ensure that the five pungent foods, women who have given birth, chickens, and dogs do not enter the chamber. Be cautious, be exceedingly cautious.
