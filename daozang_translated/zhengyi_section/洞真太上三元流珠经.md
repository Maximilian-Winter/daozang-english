**The Scripture of the Three Primes’ Flowing Pearls**

The Scripture of the Three Primes’ Flowing Pearls is the practice of the Controller of Destiny. Its Dao is wondrous and vast, the most revered of the Five Classics. For its transmission, one employs three hundred and sixty-five white true pearls, round and luminous, each the size of a tung seed, corresponding to the degrees of the stellar lodges and the conjunctions of the sun and moon. Twenty-four feet each of crimson and yellow silk are used to swear oaths before the yin-yang spirit officials, invoking the Dao of extended harmony. Twenty-four *qi* are pledged in a pure fast, and the transmission is conferred after invocation. It is passed down once every three hundred years, and after five transmissions, it ceases to be bestowed. This is the Dao of the Supreme Polarity, the Duke, the Minister, and the Controller of Destiny.

In all people, the space between the eyebrows, one *cun* inward, is the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward, the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward, the Cinnabar Field; and four *cun* inward, the Flowing Pearl. Within the Flowing Pearl Palace resides the Upper Supreme Unity Lord, seated upon a radiant throne, crowned within the Purple Chamber. The Controller of Destiny comes and goes, consulting and receiving the records of fate. For transgressions, it subtracts from life and inscribes death; for merits, it removes death and restores life. Those who live by this method, establishing merit and avoiding fault, may have the Controller of Destiny memorialize the Upper Supreme Unity to extend their years and increase their lifespan. Though it does not yet attain the subtlety of the Four Palaces and the Feminine Unity, it is indeed the loftiness of the Five Palaces and the Masculine Unity.

For those who cultivate the *Eight Scrolls of the Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*, its effects are precise and efficacious, revealing the Flowing Pearl. Without sight of the Flowing Pearl, one sinks into the Eight Lives, toiling in cycles of return, with no means to ascend to the Mysterium. The essentials of Mysterium ascent lie in the Flowing Pearl. When the pearl shines in the Upper Palace, its radiance flows through the Nine Treasuries, penetrating within and without, unobstructed and unbound. One roams freely above the Nine Heavens and feasts within the Three Clarities.

**The Nine Terraces Talisman**
**Oral Instructions of Master Feng, the Upper Clarity Perfected**

The Dao of the student must first treat illness, ensuring the body is free of deficiency and evil, and that blood, brain, and fluids are not diminished or stagnant. Without this prior treatment, even the ingestion of medicines and the circulation of *qi* will be of no benefit to the body.

In former times, there was a Daoist named Wang Zhongfu who, from youth, was inclined toward the pursuit of immortality. He practiced the methods of absorbing the Three Luminaries and dining on clouds for over forty years, yet perceived no benefit. His son also studied these arts, practicing them for eighteen years, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Later, the Perfected of Mount Nanyue descended to Zhongfu and instructed him: "The reason you have not attained ascension is that your body suffers from grave illness—your brain palace is deficient, your sinews and fluids do not flow, and your numinous essence is not full. Though you have absorbed the luminaries and dined on clouds, it has not benefited your body."

Zhongfu then took medicines to treat his illness while continuing his practice. After another eighteen years, he too ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now, he resides on the Dark Continent, where he received scriptures and became the Perfected of the Central Marchmount, governing the Bureau of the Nine Mysteries. He remains there to this day.

The student of the Dao must cherish *qi* and nurture spirit, ingesting medicines to treat illness, filling the brain palace, and preventing the leakage of primordial essence. Only then can one preserve spirit and ingest the numinous, chewing and absorbing the Three Luminaries. If one frequently engages in sexual union, leaking and discharging essence, then *qi* becomes foul, spirit departs, essence is depleted, and the body withers. Even if one holds the Mysterious Tablet and the Jade Register, or the Golden Writ of the Supreme Polarity, how can one escape the fate of non-life?

In former times, my former teacher often warned me of this matter, saying: "For the student, one union dissipates a year’s medicinal potency; two unions dissipate two years’ potency. Beyond three, the dissipated medicine is entirely lost from the body." Thus, the true immortals are ever cautious in this regard, deeming it the greatest taboo of life preservation.

The student of the Dao must only cherish *qi* and nurture spirit, restraining *qi* to its utmost and exhaling it gently. One must not speak excessively or shout loudly, lest spirit be wearied and *qi* be harmed. Such practices are not the way of life nurturing.

For those who preserve spirit and *qi* to practice the affairs of true immortality, one must not lend clothing or belongings to others, nor wear items not one’s own. All such things as headscarves, coarse garments, shoes, and sandals should be kept fresh and pristine. The Three Hun and Seven Po may dwell within them, and the *qi* of the Five Spirits is ever averse to the defilement of foul odors.

On the eight seasonal nodes, one must fast and purify oneself, planning good deeds to cultivate the Dao. Beware of anger, contention, joy, or wrath on these days, and do not impose punishments or authority, for these are taboos of heaven and humanity, incurring grave offenses.

When studying the profound Dao or reciting sacred scriptures, for every ten or twenty words, one should lick the lips and swallow saliva once or twice. For every hundred or fifty words, one should click the teeth two or three times to summon spirit, gather the numinous, harmonize blood and *qi*, and fill the numinous essence. Thus, the Imperial Unity delights in its abode, achieving the state where *qi* flows without labor and opens without leakage.

The method of the student forbids weeping or excessive spitting, for these deplete fluids and leak essence, exhausting the brain. Therefore, the Perfected and Daoists constantly practice exhalation, inhalation, and swallowing to harmonize the Six Fluids.

On the days of *jiayin* and *gengshen*, when corpse ghosts vie and chaos reigns, and spirit is restless and defiled, one must not share a mat with a spouse or engage in conversation. One should maintain a pure fast, remain vigilant, and dispel all desires.

On the five *mao* days, one must fast, enter the chamber, face east, and bow with sincerity, preserving spirit and contemplating *qi*, awaiting the response of the divine. Whatever one’s heart desires may then be expressed. Those who practice thus will have Jade Maidens descend to attend them.

On one’s natal day, face its corresponding direction, knock the teeth three times in succession, and with heartfelt reverence bow twice, then softly recite the incantation:

*"Great Unity fills life,
Three qi unite with the True.
Womb-chamber’s upper radiance,
Mother Mysterious, Father Primordial—
You birth my five viscera,
Gather my spirit,
Below irrigate with Jade Fluid,
Above ascend to Mud Pill Palace.
At dusk refine the seven po,
At dawn harmonize the three hun.
To the right, Jade Flower commands;
To the left, Golden Dawn roars.
Make me a divine immortal,
Enlist spirits and employ the True.
Ever preserve the flowing essence,
Soar through the Ten Heavens."*

When the incantation is complete, bow in the heart to the four directions, knock the teeth three times in succession, and swallow the saliva three times. This is called the Supreme Way of the Hidden Audience of the Womb’s Primordial through the Incantation of Life. Those who practice it constantly will have their hun and po safeguarded, attaining long life as divine immortals.

Whenever entering the chamber to burn incense, one should face the mat, bow in the heart, knock the teeth, and silently recite the incantation, expressing whatever is in the heart. By maintaining single-minded focus, one will surely receive a numinous response.

One should constantly visualize one’s own form, making it as vivid as if standing before oneself, so that the face is perpetually illuminated by the light of the sun and moon, penetrating the entire body—with the sun on the left and the moon on the right, positioned nine inches from the face. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth three times in succession and softly recite the incantation:

*"Primordial Womb, Upper Perfected,
Twin Radiance, Two Mysteries.
To the right, embrace the seven po;
To the left, grasp the three hun.
Let my spirit and luminosity
Abide with my form forever."*

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth twenty-one times in succession and swallow the saliva seven times. This is called the Way of the Celestial Lord’s Recorded Form, Embracing the Hun and Restraining the Po, which grants clarity, divine immortality, and eternal life. If one cannot recite the incantation, visualization alone will suffice.

Moreover, students of the Dao must first restrain the hun and po and eliminate corpse ghosts. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, and the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, one should purify the fast, enter the chamber, bathe to cleanse the dust and grime, and sit upright upon the mat—remaining awake is even better. With a brush of cinnabar, mark the lower corner of the left eye, and with a brush of realgar, mark the lower part of the right nostril, allowing the pigment to slightly enter the inner canthus. After marking, first knock the teeth three times in succession and softly recite the incantation:

*"Twin Radiance flies and coils,
Cinnabar and realgar scatter their influence.
Qi seizes the empty and malevolent,
Corpse filth sinks and vanishes.
Harmonize the hun, refine the po,
Unite the form with the Great Spirit.
Let me not die,
But attain eternal wholeness,
Clarity of perception,
And ever-flowing benefit of essence."*

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth three times in succession and swallow the saliva three times. Then, with the index finger of the right hand, pinch the lower corner of the left eye, and with the index finger of the left hand, pinch the lower part of the right nostril, each seven times. Press inwardly without lifting the hands. This completes the practice.

These two points are the gateways through which the seven po and wandering corpses roam, and the passages through which residual essence and malevolent qi leak. Thus, by receiving the essence of cinnabar and realgar, one blocks the path of corpse ghosts, and through the fumigation of the Twin Radiance, dispels the qi of licentious chaos. This is the Supreme Ultimate’s highest method. Those who practice it constantly will harmonize the hun and soften the po, disperse corpse filth, attain divine immortality, and achieve luminous clarity. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts will vanish entirely.

All methods of knocking the teeth and swallowing saliva in the Highest Clarity tradition follow specific directions and sequences; they must not be disordered or mixed, lest the true spirits become confused. Knocking the teeth commands the spirits, swallowing qi harmonizes the True, and absorbing harmony relies on the Six Fluids to circulate within. To govern the spirits, one must sound the drum and proceed in order.

In all visualizations and practices of the above methods, when performing rituals and incantations, one should first knock the teeth, clashing the upper and lower rows—never side to side. With each inhalation and exhalation, three knocks are best. Only after completing the ritual and incantation should one knock the teeth again before swallowing the various qi and fluids. This is called summoning the spirits and harmonizing the True to seek ascent as an immortal.

I have often observed those of false and vulgar habits who misarrange scriptural texts, jumbling their order without sequence, rendering their efforts futile—a truly lamentable sight.
