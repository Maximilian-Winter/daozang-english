**The Supreme Nine Perfected Illuminating Regulations**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Nine Perfected Illuminating Regulations*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. Compiled from excerpts of *The Scripture of Great Mystery and Wondrousness*. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Orthodox Section, Part One.

The Supreme Nine Perfected Illuminating Regulations

The Most High addressed the Heavenly Thearchs, Later Sage Lords, High Ministers and Azure Lads, and Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, saying: All later disciples who obtain and behold the Three Caverns’ precious chapters, the secret scriptures of the primordial day, have their names inscribed in golden characters in the Eastern Florescence, ascending to the Supreme Clarity. Though they have not yet transcended the mundane, they hold the reins of the Purple Court—all are persons destined for ascension and deliverance.

Yet though they have seen these texts, without knowing the *Nine Perfected Illuminating Regulations*, the protocols and standards, the wondrous writings of the Three Caverns, and the Most High’s precious scriptures, they cannot readily unroll them. The illuminating regulations and precious secrets are concealed within the Palace of the Dark Capital, in the Golden Chambers of the Jade Metropolis, and are not transmitted to the world.

They clarify the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns, establish the ritual forms of the host of Perfected Ones, deliver those bound by karmic debts in the hidden bureaus, and elevate the Seven Mysteries to the registers of immortality. They truly encompass the myriad Dao, dissolve the heavy burdens of the Nine Yin, and their wonders may be immediately applied; their regulations may be solemnly observed.

Now, therefore, I set forth the three ranks of their chapters to assist in the propagation of the Three Wondrous and Primordial Numinous Scriptures, that they may serve as admonitions to later disciples. Let those who diligently aspire to the Dao take heed and be cautious in their secret covenants.

The Heavenly Thearchs, the Nine Mysterious Imperial Lords of Later Sages, the High Ministers and Azure Lads, and the Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate bowed their heads and respectfully inquired of the Most High Heavenly Worthy: The supreme and true methods are lofty, transcendent, and limpid; the myriad schools are vast and boundless, profoundly quiescent and empty. Their wonders surpass the abstruse, their teachings transform the Three Vehicles, and they encompass kalpas beyond measure—how could they be surpassed by illuminating regulations?

The Most High replied: Your words are excellent. As for later generations, unless they are descendants of the Jade Void, born of spontaneous natural harmony, they all emerge from the turbid currents of the Primordial Chaos, mired in clamor and defilement. Their conduct is not purely formed, their natures not wholly refined. Though they may yearn for the profound mysteries, their minds constantly stray, and their actions deviate. None fail to commit transgressions. Transgressions arise externally, extinguishing life internally. Those who study under such conditions—how can they not drift far from the truth?

If the Three Offices report their faults, and they face judgment in the hidden bureaus, with calamities extending to their seven ancestors and sins accumulating upon themselves—those who commit such transgressions, if they awaken to the existence of the illuminating regulations with their systems of correction and punishment, and to the greatness of the sagely transformation, which permits redemption through prescribed methods, and apply them according to the regulations, will surely draw near to the Perfected in due time.

For scholars who lack these standards, their diligent contemplation and arduous devotion are in vain. Now, therefore, I set forth the *Nine Perfected Three Ranks of Illuminating Regulations*, which may be transmitted to later disciples who are to become Perfected Ones.

The Imperial Lords, High Ministers and Azure Lads, and Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate then withdrew to purify themselves in the Supreme Clarity, receiving the *Primordial Numinous Scripture of Great Mystery and Wondrousness* and the *Nine Perfected Regulations*. They concealed them in golden repositories and jade coffers, guarded by jade lads and jade maidens, three thousand each, who attended to the numinous texts. They scattered incense in the empty courtyard, and flying dragons and poisonous beasts, giant serpents a thousand fathoms long, brandished their claws upon the cloud-walls, fortifying the Jade Pass.

Thus, the Ten Heavenly Great Sages and the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, three times each month, all ascend to the Dark Palace to receive the illuminating regulations, paying homage to the scriptural texts.

The High Minister and Azure Lad said: All who possess bones of gold and marrow of jade, whose names are recorded in the Azure Palace, and who obtain these texts, must keep them secret and put them into practice. In thus receiving and observing the rites, harmonizing with the supreme canon, applying the regulations and measures, and aligning with the Perfected in merit, they may redeem sins and dispel calamities, dissolving karmic entanglements. The ancestors of the Seven Mysteries rejoice, and their own persons ascend to feast in the Jade Metropolis.

**The Upper Rank Transmission of Scriptures from the Nine Perfected Illuminating Regulations of the Dark Capital**

**First Chapter of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital:**
The *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the *Precious Scripture of the Feminine One*, and the *Primordial Numinous Scripture of Great Mystery and Wondrousness*—the three wondrous chapters, the precious writings of the Most High Jade Emperor—are concealed in the Palace of Great Mystery above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Numinous Terrace of the Great Mystery.

The ancient regulations of the Primordial Thearch decree that these scriptures be transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. The three true and illuminating Daoist canons, the standards for studying the Perfected, and the supreme orthodox regulations permit three transmissions within seven thousand years. Jade lads and jade maidens, seven thousand each, hold incense and attend to the numinous texts.

According to the regulations for transmission, one must face the scriptures after a hundred days of purification, swear an oath with golden clasps, and unite the jade lads and jade maidens in accordance with the Four Poles’ regulations. Those who transmit without adhering to the regulations will incur sins extending to their seven ancestors, their hidden souls condemned to servitude, swallowing fire and eating coals, bearing mountains and transporting stones to fill the boundless abyss. Their own persons will suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, their bodies perishing and forms disintegrating, eternally confined to hell, never to attain immortality.

**Second Chapter of the Upper Rank of the Dark Capital:**
To transmit the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to later disciples, one must swear an oath with ten taels of superior gold, twenty-five catties of copper, five pairs of golden clasps, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and one tael of green silk to bind the clasps.

For the *Feminine One*, five taels of superior gold, fifty bolts each of five-colored patterned silk, one catty of incense, and three pairs of golden clasps.

For the *Primordial Numinous Scripture of the Cavern and True Mystery*, three taels of superior gold, one hundred feet of purple silk, twenty-seven feet of green silk, five taels of red silk, one catty of incense, and one tael of cinnabar.

The Primordial Thearch requires sincere oaths; no deficiencies are permitted, for deficiencies violate the regulations. If the master transgresses, the jade lads and jade maidens attending the scriptures will be returned to their original palaces. Within three years, the master will suffer the trial of the wind-blade and naturally lose the scriptures. Those who receive them without adhering to the illuminating regulations will lose their sight, their forms will disintegrate, and their seven ancestors and parents will be consigned to the punishments of the Northern Feng. After ten thousand kalpas, they will be reborn in non-human destinies. Disciples, be cautious!

The Third Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: All those bearing the golden name Donghua and the jade title Shangqing, having received *The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Empyrean*, *The Purple Ascension of the Flaming Radiance and the Mysterious True Transformation Sutra*, *The Seventy-Four Methods of Shangqing Transformation*, *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, *The Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of Cinnabar Scenery and Daoist Essence*, *The Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Light*, and *The Seven Transformations Dancing in Heaven*, have obtained the lofty scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Supreme Heavenly Thearch, and the Central Yellow Elder Lord, received within the Great Void and the Nine Mysteries—scriptures of the highest order from the realm of Non-Being.

All are secretly kept within the Palace of the Supreme Numinous Capital, in the Purple Chamber, presided over by the Lords of the Three Origins, attended by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens. From the inception of the Primordial Beginning, these scriptures were transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Ways and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission is permitted thrice within seven thousand years, and if a worthy recipient appears within seven hundred years, transmission is also permitted. All transmissions require a fast of ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days, followed by an oath of covenant, after which jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the regulations of the Four Poles. Should transmission occur without adherence to the regulations, the transgressor’s seven ancestors and parents will be consigned to the punishments of the ghostly officials, compelled to haul stones from Mount Meng to fill the River of Night. After ten thousand kalpas, they will be reborn in non-human destinies, while the transgressor’s own body will suffer the trial of the wind-blade, naturally lose the scriptures, and forever forfeit the attainment of immortality. Those who transmit must be cautious.

The Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: For the transmission of *The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Empyrean*, the oath requires golden fish, jade dragons, forty-two feet of green silk, and three pairs of golden seals. For *The Purple Ascension of the Flaming Radiance*, the oath requires fifty feet each of five-colored brocade, five taels of refined gold, five catties of aloeswood, one catty of true cinnabar, one scripture knife, seven golden pearls, and seventy feet of crimson silk. For *The Seventy-Four Methods of Shangqing Transformation*, the oath requires forty feet of green silk, ten taels of refined gold, six pairs of golden seals, one catty of fine incense, and golden fish and jade dragons. For *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the regulations require cutting hair as a covenant; now, ninety feet of white silk are used as a substitute, corresponding to the number of the Nine Perfected. One catty of green silk thread, twenty-four feet of crimson silk—this is the oath of the Sun’s Radiance; twenty-four feet of azure silk—the oath of the Moon’s Splendor; and three pairs of golden rings—the pledge of the Ever-Changing Lad’s transformation.

For *The Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of Cinnabar Scenery and Daoist Essence* and *The Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Transmuting through Flowing Light*, the requirements are ten taels of refined gold each, one golden fish and one jade dragon, forty feet of green silk, and forty feet of purple silk, with three pairs of golden rings each. For *The Seven Transformations Dancing in Heaven*, the oath requires five taels of refined gold, one catty of cinnabar, and thirty-two feet of green silk. The pledge must be made with sincerity; no deficiencies are permitted, for deficiencies violate the regulations. The master shall cast the heavenly pledge into the mountains to succor the destitute, while the remainder is to be used for the preparation of scriptural implements and not dispersed elsewhere. Should the master transgress the supreme regulations, their jade lads and jade maidens will be revoked, their lifespan and destiny records diminished, and their names registered for return to the Northern Feng. Those who receive the scriptures without adhering to the regulations will lose their souls and spirits, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality.

The Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: *The Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, *The Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, *The Golden Chapters of the Supreme Empyrean’s Soaring Mystery*, *The Crimson Book of the Purple Phoenix and the Eight Sceneries of the Morning Sun*, *The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, *The Numinous Book of Purple Script*, *The Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles*, *The Supreme Scripture of the Golden Root*, and *The Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* are all precious scriptures of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly King, and the Golden Portal Thearch, secretly kept within the Palace of Jade Clarity, behind the golden chambers and purple gates, guarded by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens each, attendants of the numinous scriptures.

From the inception of the Primordial Beginning, these were transmitted once every thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Heavens and the Rectification of the Dao, transmission is permitted thrice within seven hundred years, and if a worthy recipient appears within a hundred years, one transmission is permitted. Jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the illuminating regulations of the Four Poles. Transmission requires a fast of ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days. Should transmission occur without adherence to the regulations, the transgressor’s seven generations of ancestors will be condemned to eternal ghostly servitude without release, while the transgressor’s own body will suffer the trial of the wind-blade, die as a lowly ghost, and forever forfeit the attainment of immortality.

The Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: For the transmission of *The Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, *The Golden Chapters of the Supreme Empyrean’s Soaring Mystery*, and *The Crimson Book of the Purple Phoenix and the Eight Sceneries of the Morning Sun*, the requirements are ten taels of refined gold, one jade tablet, one golden fish and one jade dragon, and forty feet of purple silk. For *The Supreme Scriptures of the Golden Root* and *The Numinous Book of Purple Script*, the requirements are five taels of refined gold, one golden slip and one jade tablet each—each slip and tablet being one foot six inches in length and two inches four fen in width—one golden fish and one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of green silk. For *The Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*, the requirements are thirty feet of green silk, forty-three feet of green cloth, and five pairs of golden rings as a secret oath, along with ten taels of refined gold as a pledge to the spirits.

For *The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, *The Jade Girdles and Golden Pendants*, and *The Hidden Book of Jade Clarity*, the oath requires one golden fish and one jade dragon each. No deficiencies are permitted in adherence to the regulations, for deficiencies will result in the master’s jade lads and jade maidens being revoked and their name registered for return to the Northern Feng. Those who receive the scriptures without adhering to the regulations will lose their souls and spirits, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality.

The Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, *The Flying Feather Scripture of White Plumes and Black Wings*, *The Seven Origins’ Treading of the Celestial Net*, *The Supreme Hidden Book*, and *The Six Jia of the Numinous Flight* are all the Dao of the Supreme Thearch and the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, the secret scriptures of transformation and concealment, secretly kept within the Supreme Jade Palace, in the Purple Chamber, attended by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens.

Following the regulations, transmission occurs once every seven thousand years. After the Three Heavens establish rectitude, this is amended to permit transmission within seven hundred years, or even within a century if a worthy recipient appears. The transmission ritual requires a ninety-day or thirty-day purification fast, after which jade lads and jade maidens are assigned in accordance with the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*. Those who transmit without adhering to the regulations shall incur guilt extending to their seven ancestral lineages, condemned to perpetual servitude as *guitou* in the Northern Feng, enduring ten torments and eight calamities. Their own bodies shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, forever consigned to the dark abyss, and they shall never attain immortality.

The Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: For the transmission of *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, prepare thirty-two feet of blue silk, thirty feet of crimson damask, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, and a pair of golden clasps. For *The Flying Feather Scripture of White Plumes and Black Wings*, offer two taels of gold, thirty-two feet of blue damask, to substitute for the oath of severed hair and blood. For *The Seven Origins’ Treading of the Celestial Net*, prepare thirty feet of brocade and the oath of the golden fish and jade dragon. For *The Six Jia of the Numinous Flight*, provide sixty feet of white silk, six pairs of golden rings, and six taels of blue thread. The celestial statutes demand absolute sincerity; any deficiency violates the Mysterious Statutes. The master shall reclaim the jade lads and jade maidens, erase the disciple’s name from the Azure Register, and return them to the Northern Feng. Those who receive the scriptures without adhering to the regulations will lose their essence and spirit, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality.

The Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states: The transmission includes the *Square-Zhang Divine Manifestation*, the *Hidden Writ of the Seven Origins and Eight Heavens of the Vast Expanse*, the *Flowing Gold Fire Bell*, the *Golden Spirit Tiger Talisman*, the *Demon-Dispelling Stem-and-Branch Night-Illuminating Divine Candle*, the *Eight Arts of Concealment and the Purple Clarity Jade Talisman*, the *Five Registers of the Cavernous Mystery and the Supreme Talisman of the Six Jia*, and the *Secret Writ of the Five Phases and the Jade Canon of the Mysterious Capital*—altogether six hundred sections. The Supreme Thearch has marked these texts within the original scriptures to serve as their foundation. The transmission must strictly adhere to the regulations; any deficiency incurs the same penalty as above. Scriptures without talismans invite harm from celestial demons, while talismans without scriptures render devotion ineffectual, and the divine perfected will not descend. The statutes decree that neither may be practiced in isolation; violation of this rule incurs the same penalty. Both scriptures and talismans originate from the *qi* of spontaneity and the principles of emptiness and non-being, and thus may not be cultivated separately. Without adhering to the statutes, the Dao can never be achieved.

**The Middle Category Admonitions on Transgressions in the Statutes of the Nine Perfected of the Mysterious Capital**

The First Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states: Among later learners, those whose seven generations of ancestors have committed murder, banditry, plunder, treacherous schemes, illicit lust, usurpation, or rebellion, or whose nine clans have colluded in treason and impiety, shall bear the heaviest retribution. Their grievances and transgressions accumulate in the Nine Yin, beyond the reach of pardon. Their descendants, burdened by residual calamity, may not partake in the true scriptures or secretly receive the sacred texts. If, however, they endure hardship, aspire to self-improvement, confess their sins to the Seven Mysteries, perform meritorious deeds, liberate imprisoned souls, and expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries with unbound hair, persisting for three years without wearying, then—having prepared substantial offerings—they may cast them into the Nine Rivers to atone for past transgressions. Only thereafter may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice. Those who bear such sins yet fail to first punish and reproach themselves, confessing to Heaven and the unseen, and who receive the teachings, shall—both master and disciple—suffer the trial of the wind-blade. Their seven ancestral lineages shall be eternally confined to the dark abyss, bearing stones and mountains for ten thousand kalpas without release. Their bodies shall perish, the scriptures shall be lost, and they must exercise utmost caution.

The Second Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who wish to cultivate the supreme methods yet bear grave sins—having taken lives with their own hands, cruelly oppressed the lowly, slaughtered living beings, plundered the common folk, schemed deceitfully, colluded with their nine clans, envied the worthy and capable, or rebelled against their masters—shall incur unpardonable offenses, their transgressions accumulating in the Nine Yin. They may not partake in the wondrous methods or cultivate the scriptures. If, however, they endure hardship, confess their initial crimes, perform meritorious deeds, expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries with unbound hair, and prostrate themselves for three years to atone for their transgressions, they may redeem their faults, liberate their seven ancestral lineages, and separate their destinies from the Three Realms. Only thereafter may they observe a hundred-day purification fast and receive the sacred scriptures to proceed with their practice. Those who bear such sins yet fail to first confess, reproach, and punish themselves, and who receive the scriptures, shall—both master and disciple—suffer the trial of the wind-blade, endure ten torments and eight calamities, and be consigned to the dark springs. The scriptures shall be lost, and their seven generations of ancestors shall serve as eternal prisoners in the dark abyss, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Learners must exercise caution.

The Third Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states: Any learner who, having received the Three Wonders’ sacred texts or the *Supreme Clarity* secret scriptures, carelessly reveals their catalog, displays them to the unworthy, or profanes their mysteries, shall—upon the first to the tenth offense—be penalized with three years of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. Beyond this, their guilt shall accumulate in the Nine Yin, their seven ancestral lineages shall suffer retribution, and they shall be condemned to servitude in the Three Prisons, bearing stones and mountains, enduring ten torments and eight calamities. Only after ten thousand kalpas may they emerge, but they shall be reborn beyond the path of humanity. Their own bodies shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, lose their sight and limbs, die as lowly ghosts, and never attain immortality. Those who transmit the teachings must exercise caution.

The Fourth Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states: Any learner who, having received the *Supreme Clarity* sacred scriptures or the Three Wonders’ sacred texts, weeps, encounters corpses, or is defiled by blood and filth, shall—upon the first to the tenth offense—be penalized with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may atone in accordance with the statutes, redeem their sins in the Great Yin, and resume purification and practice. Beyond this, upon the twenty-fourth offense, their lifespan shall be diminished, and their jade lads and jade maidens shall return to their original abodes. Within three years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish. Their seven ancestral lineages shall serve as eternal ghostly laborers, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Learners must exercise caution.

**The Fifth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any learner who receives the *Supreme Clarity* sacred scriptures or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not approach women or engage in yin-yang intercourse, for these defile and corrupt the true qi. From ten to twenty-four offenses, they shall be penalized with three hundred days of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may purify themselves and resume cultivation. Beyond this, their jade lads and jade maidens shall each return to their original abodes, their lifespan shall be diminished, and within a year they shall lose the scriptures and perish. Their seven ancestral lineages shall be punished—learners must exercise caution.

**The Sixth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any learner who receives the *Supreme Clarity* sacred texts or the Three Caverns’ secret texts yet harbors malicious intent, commits acts of cruelty, kills living beings, engages in violence, schemes with deceit, envies the worthy, resents the capable, attacks kin of the same qi, or undermines their scripture master—upon the first to fifth offense—shall be permitted to atone by pledging sincerity, making amends in the Nine Yin, redeeming their sins in the Five Marchmounts, and enduring ten years of severed merit and suspended practice. They may then purify themselves and resume their studies. Beyond five offenses, up to twenty-four, the Four Administrations shall seize and execute them, capturing their hun and shen to be punished in the Northern Feng. Their seven ancestral lineages shall serve as laborers, and after ten thousand kalpas, they may return to be reborn in non-human realms. Their jade lads and jade maidens shall each return to the Upper Palaces, and within a year, they shall lose the scriptures and perish, never attaining immortality—learners must exercise caution.

**The Seventh Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any learner who receives the *Supreme Clarity* sacred scriptures or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not urinate facing north, consume the meat of the five pungent vegetables or the six livestock, drink wine, engage in licentiousness, violate the Dao, disrespect the dharma, or waver in devotion. From ten to twenty-four offenses, they may atone in accordance with the statutes by pledging sincerity, making amends in the Great Yin, enduring one year of severed merit, and then purifying themselves for ninety days before resuming their studies. Beyond this, their lifespan shall be diminished, their body shall endure the trials of the wind-knife, and their seven ancestral lineages shall be punished in the Three Ways. Within five years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish—learners must exercise caution.

**The Eighth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any learner who receives the *Supreme Clarity* sacred scriptures or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must, in accordance with the statutes, present offerings and sincerity to their master, announce their purification, and only then receive the scriptures. They must not, without declaration or oath, recklessly peruse the sacred texts. All learners who obtain the scriptures must receive them from a master—these are bestowed by unseen agents. They must not lightly copy or alter the sacred texts, impose their own interpretations, corrupt the ancient names and sounds, or devise their own methods. The Four Administrations shall record their offenses, and their sins shall be inscribed in the Nine Yin. From the first to third offense, they shall endure three years of severed merit and suspended practice, atone in accordance with the statutes, present offerings to the Nine Rivers, and purify themselves for thirty days before resuming cultivation. Beyond this, up to twenty-four offenses, their jade lads and jade maidens shall each return to their original abodes, their lifespan shall be diminished, their body shall serve as a ghostly official, and their seven ancestral lineages shall serve as eternal ghostly laborers. After ten thousand kalpas, they may return to be reborn in non-human realms—learners must exercise caution.

**The Ninth Scroll of the Middle Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who receive the *Supreme Clarity* sacred scriptures or the Three Caverns’ wondrous texts must place them in a separate chamber upon a high bed, four feet and four inches in height and five feet in width, distinct from ordinary or inferior scriptures. They shall light lamps, burn incense, and make morning and evening offerings with reverent vows, always maintaining their devotion. They must not allow those of impure qi, those defiled by filth, or women to enter and disturb the divine perfected. These are the statutes observed in the world.

The recipient of the scriptures must not wear clothing, shoes, or sandals that are improper or mingled with the common. In lying down, resting, sitting, or rising, they must always remain distinct from ordinary things. From the first to twenty-fourth offense, they shall be penalized with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may purify themselves and resume cultivation. Beyond this, they shall be seized by the Four Administrations, their transgressions reported to the Jade Clarity, and their names returned to Fengdu. Within seven years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish, and their seven ancestral lineages shall be punished—learners must exercise caution.

**The Lower Grade Redemption Scroll of the Mysterious Capital’s Nine Perfected Bright Statutes**

**The First Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** If any later learner’s seven ancestors or parents committed the sins described in the first scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades of the Mysterious Capital during their lifetimes, their punishment shall be especially severe, their sins bound in the Nine Yin. Their seven ancestors shall face their accusers, enduring eternal torment in the dark prisons, their misfortunes extending to their descendants, who shall be pursued by unseen forces without release. They must stand bare beneath the Great Yin, dishevel their hair, and kowtow, confessing their sins to the Nine Yin. After three years of self-reproach, at the year’s end, they shall present nine pairs of gold rings, one liang of blue silk, and one gold figurine, casting them into the mouth of the Three Rivers to redeem the sins of their seven ancestors and deliver their souls from the trials of the dark prisons.

The statute requires a peachwood tablet inscribed in red with five lines, recording: *"On such-and-such a day, month, and year, I, [name], of [prefecture], [county], and [village], confess that my seven ancestors, parents, and myself have committed the sins described in the first scroll of the Upper and Middle Grades of the Mysterious Capital, our sins bound in the Nine Yin. Now, in accordance with the statutes, I present nine pairs of gold rings and one gold figurine to redeem the cruel punishments of the dark prisons. I cast this petition to the Water Officials, seeking absolution. May my sins be erased by the Three Offices, and my soul ascend to the Nine Heavens."* Upon completion, they shall bind the objects and tablet with blue silk and sink them with a blue stone. At the moment of sinking, they shall face north, raise their head, and recite the incantation: *"Nine Lords of the Great Yin, divine officials of the executive bureau, I now declare my words and report to the river’s source. I cast my pledge into the Nine Springs to deliver my seven ancestors. May our grievances be dissolved, and may I ascend as an immortal."* Upon completion, the punishments of their seven ancestors shall be released, allowing them to depart the dark prisons and ascend to the Hall of Blessings. The learner may then proceed to study the sacred scriptures, and after nine years, the true numinous shall descend in form, ascending with the gods. The statutes are especially severe—no further transgressions are permitted.

**The Second Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who wish to cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected and whose own body has previously committed the sins described in the second scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their punishments deeply bound, their sins coiled in the Nine Yin, obstructing the unseen realms. This shall extend to their seven ancestors, who shall face the trials of the destitute souls, their suffering unending. They must first stand beneath the Great Yin, face north, dishevel their hair, and kowtow to the Three Luminaries, confessing their sins. After three years of self-reproach...

When the year concludes, one must provide a catty of cinnabar, a scribing knife, an ounce of gold, and a golden figurine, casting them into the confluence of the Three Rivers to redeem one’s own grievous transgressions, unbind the knots before the Three Offices, and extricate one’s seven ancestors. The ritual requires a foot of azure silk inscribed with cinnabar, bearing the following record: *"On the first day of the [specific] month in the [specific] year, [Name], of [Prefecture], [County], [Village], aged [X] years, whose person has hitherto committed no visible transgressions but has erred against the Mysterious Statutes, his hands having perpetrated primordial evil, now incurs the sins of the second scroll of the Upper and Middle Grades of the Mysterious Capital. His sins coil in the Great Yin. In accordance with the statutes, he offers a golden figurine, a catty of cinnabar, and a scribing knife to redeem his own foul transgressions. He casts this petition to declare his fate, prostrating himself before the numinous, that he may be unbound and his sins dissolved in the Nine Rivers, his person attaining longevity."* Upon completion, bind the objects and text with azure silk, then sink them with a blue stone. At the moment of submersion, face north, raise your head, and recite the incantation:

*"Above lies the Great Yin, governed by the Nine Lords.
I now declare my words, reporting to the source of the rivers.
Redeem my sins, unbind the knots,
Deliver me from ninefold calamities.
Wandering souls and paired spirits,
Each returns to their natural state.
Misfortune vanishes, and I learn immortality—
My person ascends."*

When finished, the knots of the Nine Yin shall be untangled, and the souls of grievance shall return to their natural state. One may then proceed to study the scriptures of the Supreme Clarity. After nine years of unwavering practice, the true numinous shall descend in form, merging with the divine.

The statutes are especially severe—no further transgressions are permitted.

**The Third Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who cultivate the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity and the esoteric texts of the Cavernous Mystery, yet whose person has committed the sins described in the third scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades, shall find their punishments bound to the Great Yang, seized by the Four Offices, and reported to the Jade Clarity. For such transgressions, one must sever attachments, practice self-restraint, enter the chamber to burn incense, kowtow in confession, face north, and click the teeth ten times. Raising the head, recite the incantation:

*"O profound and distant Mysterious Primordial,
Rarely heard in the lower world,
I lightly divulged the precious and true,
Offending the august honor of the Emperor on High.
I now assume responsibility,
Prostrating myself at the gates of the numinous.
I humbly beseech the Most High
To bestow the grace of the Mysterious,
Descending with numinous resonance,
Awakening the natural."*

When finished, kowtow nine times. After three years of such confessions, followed by thirty days of purificatory abstinence, one may be absolved by the Three Offices, the punishments of the Nine Yin dissolved. One may then resume cultivation, treasuring the secret recitations, and in time attain flight as an immortal.

The statutes are especially severe—no further transgressions are permitted.

**The Fourth Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet whose person has committed the sins described in the fourth scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their sins coiled in the Nine Yin, their punishments suspended before the Jade Clarity. The transgressor must, at midnight in the central courtyard, kindle thirty-two lamps to cleanse defiling qi, purifying both inner and outer. Entering the chamber to burn incense, face north, kowtow, and confess the transgressions. Click the teeth thirty-six times, then raise the head and recite the prayer:

*"The turning of the world’s fate brings ruin,
The desiccated corpse’s shadow grows manifest.
Defiling qi swirls in profusion,
Confronting the true.
I violated the statutes and breached sincerity,
My person entering the realm of sin.
I redeem myself through ritual and confession,
Washing clean with luminous lamps.
Misfortune scatters before the Three Clarities,
Fortune fills and my person prospers.
The Dao’s shade flows in curves,
Its blessings boundless."*

When finished, kowtow nine more times. After a year of such practice, followed by thirty days of purificatory abstinence, one may resume cultivation. Conduct must be meticulous, statutes observed with care, and the heart devoted to the true. After nine years, one shall ascend in broad daylight to the dawn.

**The Fifth Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet whose person has committed the sins described in the fifth scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their sins bound to the Great Yin, their punishments suspended before the Azure Palace. The transgressor must bathe in fragrant waters, then in the central courtyard provide oil to kindle twenty-four lamps for ninety days. Entering the chamber, face north, kowtow nine times, confess the transgressions, and click the teeth twenty-four times. Raising the head, recite the prayer:

*"Heaven’s firmament and Earth’s foundation,
The two images intermingle.
Yin qi obscures the upright,
Defiling qi fills all.
The spirit is lost, the treasure diminished,
The dignity of the Dao impaired.
With reverence, I kindle luminous lamps,
Illuminating the Mysterious Palace above.
Scatter misfortune in the Nine Yin,
Fortune and blessings return to the lineage."*

After ninety days, conclude with twenty-four days of abstinence. One may then resume the practice of the true methods, ever mindful and cautious, strictly adhering to the statutes. In time, the Mysterious and True shall merge with one’s form, attaining immortality.

The statutes are especially severe—no further transgressions are permitted.

**The Sixth Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet whose person has committed the sins described in the sixth scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their transgressions especially grave, seized by the Four Offices, their punishments bound to the Great Yin, confronting them in the Dark Palace. The transgressor must stand beneath the Great Yin, dishevel the hair, kowtow, and confess before the Jade Clarity to extricate themselves from the Great Yin. In accordance with the statutes, one must distribute personal treasures to the poor, providing meals for a hundred people to relieve the hungry for ten years. Entering the chamber, kowtow in self-reproach, face north, click the teeth nine times, and raise the head to recite the incantation:

*"Heaven is vast, Earth is broad,
The Nine Origins unfold.
My person treads the gates of fortune,
Yet my sins hang before the Jade Capital.
Entangled in snares, I fall into the numinous precincts of the Cavernous Mystery.
I scatter treasures to lift the punishments,
Offering sustenance to the destitute.
Sins dissolve in the Great Yin,
Fortune arises in ten directions.
Shedding the old, embracing the new,
Blessings descend without end."*

When finished, kowtow nine more times. This is the supreme method of the Most High for lifting sins, recorded in the orthodox statutes. After ten years of such practice, the accumulated sins and lingering punishments shall be dissolved in the Great Yin. Upon completing the year of self-reproach, observe a hundred days of abstinence, then resume cultivation. One must vigilantly uphold the laws, never transgressing again.

**The Seventh Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet whose person has committed the sins described in the seventh scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their sins filling the Supreme Clarity. The transgressor must offer ten catties of fine incense to fellow practitioners in ten different places, each act absolving a year of sin. Entering the chamber to burn incense, face east, kowtow nine times, confess before the Supreme Perfected, click the teeth nine times, and raise the head to recite the incantation:

Amidst the tangled five qi, the Supreme Perfected remain incomplete; the body, tainted by defiled qi, offends the Cavern Gate, harms the viscera, and severs life, disturbing the Three Passes. Violating the statutes and transgressing the precepts, one incurs prolonged karmic retribution. With reverent penance, I now report to the Imperial Honored Ones, beseeching that my case be proclaimed: may I depart from the lower worlds and ascend as a Heavenly Immortal. Thus concludes.

Upon completing this year, observe twenty-four days of abstinence, then resume the practices you have received, and the true numina will descend. The gravity of the statutes is great—never transgress again.

**The Eighth Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet commit the sins described in the eighth scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall be seized by the supervisory officials, their transgressions binding the Three Clarities. The offender must burn a *hu* of pure oil as lamps in the central courtyard, the quantity at their discretion, until the oil is exhausted. Additionally, offer ten catties of fine incense to a master who possesses the scriptures, thereby absolving three years of sin. Entering the chamber to burn incense, face north, kowtow nine times, confess the transgression, click the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:

The Heavenly Perfected are lofty and distant, their mysterious radiance descending in clarity. By virtue of past blessings, I have beheld the true scriptures. Yet, failing to grasp the mysterious statutes, I have slighted the celestial numina, violated the truth, and breached sincerity, plunging my person into darkness. Now, with rigorous self-reproach, I report to the Supreme Clarity. Henceforth, I shall purify my former form, uphold the mysterious truth, and align with the Dao. Thus concludes.

After three years have passed, observe ninety days of abstinence. If you have already received the teachings from a master, you may resume cultivation; if not, present offerings and visit a master to receive the scriptures, then practice in accordance with the statutes to ascend. The mysterious statutes are exceedingly weighty—never transgress again.

**The Ninth Scroll of the Lower Grade of the Mysterious Capital states:** Any who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected yet commit the sins described in the ninth scroll of the Upper or Middle Grades shall find their transgressions bound in the Nine Yin and their karmic retribution suspended in the Jade Clarity. The offender must light seven lamps before the hall, enter the chamber, kowtow, confess their sins before the scriptures, click the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:

The radiance of jade descends, illuminating the Supreme Clarity above. Through negligence in service and reverence, I have violated the precious scriptures. I fear the Four Offices will list my sins in the Purple Court. With solemn abstinence and reverence, I beseech the true numina to condescend and descend, erasing my sins and dissolving my punishments. I vow to uphold the mysterious statutes and eternally preserve my original integrity. Thus concludes.

After one year, observe twenty-four days of abstinence, then resume the practices you have received. The mysterious statutes are exceedingly weighty—be vigilant and never transgress again.

The **Nine Perfected Statutes of the Great Mystery**, comprising three grades and twenty-seven clauses, originate from the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Supreme, treasured and secretly guarded by the Supreme Lord, never to be disseminated in the lower worlds. Now, these essential excerpts are transcribed for the enlightenment of future sages, to illuminate the Three Marvels and be appended to the *Scripture of the Great Primordial Numinous Simplicity*. Those whose bones align with immortality may apply this text to absolve sins, resolve transgressions, untangle karmic knots, and dispel obstructions. The Seven Mysteries shall vanish, and after three years, the true numina will manifest, uniting with you to ascend the Nine Heavens together. To lightly divulge the mysterious statutes incurs the same punishment as the aforementioned transgressions. Guard them as treasures, keeping them secret and practicing them with reverence.

**The Ninth Perfected Scroll of the Mysterious Capital states:** The transmission of scriptural titles found within the Three Grades of the Nine Perfected Statutes occurred when the Sage Emperor Lord first received the scriptures from the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Lord bestowed the scriptures, derived from the Three Grades of Illuminated Statutes, to assist the Three Treasures and the marvelous texts of the Supreme Perfected scriptures. The statutes governing their application, along with the thirty-one scrolls, independent matters, and various scriptural rituals, are all contained within the *Illuminated Statutes of the Four Poles*. The Three Grades of the Nine Perfected are placed in the Nine Emperor’s Palace as the upper scrolls of the Three Simplicities. The Four Poles, governed by the Four Offices, oversee all transgressions and the prohibitions of punishments. The *Illuminated Statutes of the Supreme Perfected*, received by the Supreme Emperor Lord from the mysterious chapters of the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, contain the rituals and statutes of the Supreme Perfected. Their methods are concealed above the Nine Heavens, and the prohibitions of the Supreme Emperor Lord are stored in the Palace of the Supreme Perfected, never to be practiced in the world. The *Illuminated Statutes of the Nine Perfected* restrain later students, while the *Illuminated Statutes of the Four Poles* govern the four directions. Their purport is profound and penetrating, yet without golden characters or jade inscriptions, they remain unknown. Those who obtain these scrolls need not study to attain perfection. The statutes exist to restrain sins; seeing the statutes and reforming ensures no transgression against Heaven and Earth. To be without transgression is to align with spontaneity, and aligning with spontaneity enables one to ascend and supplement the ranks of the True Immortals. To study without statutes is to distance oneself from immortality.

**The Ninth Perfected Scroll of the Mysterious Capital states:** All who possess the utmost resolve and whose names are recorded in the Mysterious Palace may first receive the Illuminated Statutes to understand the celestial laws and prohibitions before receiving the scriptures. If their bones are aligned, they may first make a covenant and then be transmitted the teachings. The covenant’s ritual implements and offerings shall follow the quantities prescribed in the *Three Marvels’ Precious Scriptures*, with the same duration of years. Never lightly transmit to the unworthy, nor reveal the mysterious texts. Failure to adhere to the statutes will result in one’s person being consigned to the offices of ghosts, while the seven generations of ancestors and parents will tread upon the Mountain of Knives and Forest of Swords, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Even external violations of the statutes incur the same punishment as the statutory text. These prohibitions apply to both parties—students, be vigilant.

**The Ninth Perfected Scroll of the Mysterious Capital states:** All who receive the supreme methods yet fail to uphold the Illuminated Statutes, slighting the celestial prohibitions, shall incur sins that burden the Seven Mysteries and extend karmic retribution to their person. Once they repent and reform, their penance shall be rigorous. If, after resuming their practices, they transgress again, their retribution shall be heavier than before. Such individuals’ bones and life are misaligned, their form opposed to the truth, their po souls akin to ghosts—none may repent again or resume the study of the true scriptures. I now elucidate these statutes to awaken those who remain unawakened. For those who know yet still transgress, what purpose remains? Practitioners, be vigilant.

**Eulogy of the Supreme Emperor Lord.**

Amidst the obscurity of primal transformation’s dawn,
the faintest morning dews disperse.
In the Great Stillness above the Void and Mystery,
the Two Modes divide in boundless clarity.

Congealed essence embraces the hollow womb,
coalescing into form, nurturing the vision of emptiness.
Holding essence within the profound and numinous,
in a flash, the dark dawn unfolds.

At last awakening to the sorrow of fleeting years,
one’s fate turns back toward the Celestial Han.
With whispers of *buxu* steps, circling in reverence,
one pays homage to the Jade Capital.

Bowing in obeisance to the Great Nothingness,
riding the wind, scattering sacred incense.
Looking up and down within the halls of emperors,
adrift and soaring on the void.

Exquisite chants emit wondrous sounds,
intoning the hymns of the Supreme Perfected.
Flowing through the Four Great Realms,
the Ten Heavens stretch boundlessly.

From the Tower of Lang, the dark night breaks,
divine candles spout radiant light.
Jade forests bloom resplendently,
their brilliance illuminating the jasper halls.

The void gives rise to natural mist,
lush and dense, upholding the Mysterious Net.
The host of perfected beings, robed in dawn’s glory, praise,
their jeweled canopies raised with the wind.

In flying steps, they chant the hymns of emptiness,
divine songs nurturing the Dao’s growth.
Profound and vast, the Great Transformation flourishes,
abundant and thriving, the Dao’s rise.

Through daily accumulation of study, responding to inspiration,
merit fulfilled, one enters the Great Vehicle.
Blessings and fortune extend to all,
the Seven Ancestors all ascend.

Harnessing the chariot to scale the Great Flower,
turning the reins toward the celestial palaces.
Divine winds stir the hollow vastness,
fragrant blossoms ride the mist and scatter.

With whispers, they pay homage in the numinous hall,
in orderly ranks, they tread the Mysterious Han.
Bright chants open the depths of the heart,
delivering from the hardships of past roots.

The Five Sufferings dissolve in due time,
their fragrance infused in the alchemical vessel.
The luminous towers stand amidst cloud-nets,
flying auroras flank the divine carriage.

Lifting the traceless perfected,
gently they enter the Great Void.
Riding the void, they recite the jade scriptures,
in desolate elegance, they chant the feathered texts.

Vast thoughts extend universally,
all things overflow with blessings.
The Celestial Emperor Lord’s Eulogy:

The Supreme Dao arises from emptiness and stillness,
mysterious echoes seek one another in the yin.
The Three Perfected originate from the Primordial One,
yet in qi’s transformation, principles diverge.

Within the formless Dharma Wheel,
it flows, ethereal and pure in contemplation.
Verses congeal without awaiting thought,
qi coalesces, uniting with the mysterious talisman.

Divine chants emit hymns of emptiness,
intoning while treading the void in reverent circling.
The mysterious transformation is originally traceless,
yet traces give rise to the Dao’s lineage.

Roaming the Nine Heavens’ bounds,
resting the chariot at the Six Peaks’ palaces.
Lifting the exalted guests,
returning to my pristine numinous chamber.

The Dao flows freely within the vast and silent,
divine songs resound in the Great Void.
Forms respond in the Court of Utmost Stillness,
thoughts and chants connect the subtle and imperceptible.

Cloud-light veils the morning glow,
its lingering radiance shades the Jade Capital.
The Mysterious Dragon awaits no chariot,
with whispers, it soars on the void.

Hands pluck the Seven Treasures’ blossoms,
divine winds scatter wondrous fragrance.
Exquisite chants arise from the heart’s depths,
brilliant and resplendent, unfolding jade verses.

The myriad qi merge into the Primordial One,
all returning to the Three Mysteries’ beam.
Riding the heavens, how could it be called high?
Gazing afar, the Nine Mysteries stretch boundlessly.

Flapping wings, longing for the mysterious reins,
yearning to ascend the evening clouds’ empyrean.
Accumulated thoughts invoke divine resonance,
hoping to commune with the Jade Perfected.

Dimly, the Celestial Han clears,
adrift, the auroras return.
The Three Perfected soar into the void,
grasping the reins, swiftly entering the Purple Tenuity.

Bright chants deliver the later bodies,
all are enabled to ride the light and fly.
Delivering from the Three Paths’ hardships,
the Nine Mysteries escape sorrow and lament.

The Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord’s Eulogy:

The Supreme Perfected arises from the hollow vastness,
the jasper net illumines the jeweled terrace.
Circling in reverence to the Jade Capital,
the host of immortals chant subtle verses.

Turning within the traceless,
void songs harmonize with the hidden tryst.
Delivering the body to ascend heaven,
intoning to accumulate the foundations of fortune.

Urging the reins toward the Great Aurora’s palace,
occasionally feasting amidst the auroras.
Adrift without bounds,
separating to enter the Mysterious Gate.

The mind at ease, the Dao also flows freely,
the cinnabar heart and will also part.
Through daily accumulation of study, renewing,
chanting my pristine numinous texts.

The Eight Auroras propel the celestial carriage,
flying auroras embellish the mysterious banner.
The plain canopy rides the wind in return,
desolate, entering the Purple Clarity.

Exquisite praises of the myriad perfected hymns,
jade echoes—how resonant!
Unbinding the Nine Yin’s registers,
delivering the body back to the Southern Court.

Blessings flow universally to all,
wondrous transformations leave none unprosperous.
The pure and tranquil Mysterious Dao’s lineage,
luminous and radiant, illumines the Great Void.

Wondrous transformations arise from silent stillness,
inwardly contemplating the Three Primes’ palace.
Accumulated thoughts pierce the mysterious void,
subtly, the Supreme Dao is attained.

Knocking and chanting, resonating with the mysterious stillness,
divine songs leave none unexalted.
Cinnabar radiance reflects the cloud-court,
purple mist illumines the jade forest.

Resplendent, the Seven Treasures’ blossoms,
brilliant, they sway with the numinous sounds.
Gong and shang naturally harmonize,
exquisite subtleties guide the heart’s depths.

Mysterious chants sow the fields of fortune,
broadly delivering the boundless heart.
The Golden Portal Emperor Lord of Later Saints’ Eulogy:

Vast and boundless, the Primordial Beginning of Heaven,
the Three Images merge into the Mysterious One.
With whispers, the Orthodox Dao flourishes,
vast and expansive, the Great Vehicle soars.

The Six Qi return to the Orthodox Court,
all converging in the Mud-Pill Chamber.
Entering and exiting, roaming the Emperor’s halls,
essence and splendor illumine the clouds and sun.

Circulating, returning to the Celestial Han,
gently riding the Mysterious Seven.
Round blossoms reflect the luminous pearl,
the Two Auroras face the true light.

Divine radiance initiates the northern assembly,
mysterious images intersect at Fusang.
Darkly, they seek one another,
yin flows freely through the Mysterious Eight Wastes.

If one can consume this essence,
one shall long uphold the Mysterious Net.
Playfully roaming the Nine Mysteries’ terrace,
resting at ease in the Western Feather’s Alley.

Divine beasts sing in the jasper hall,
flying phoenixes intermingle in disarray.
The void gives rise to natural chants,
perfected beings sing in rhythmic harmony.

Transforming bodies in the kalpa’s court,
incense and destiny command pure songs.
Establishing merit and sowing fields of fortune,
delivering later bodies from the net.

The Seven Mysteries scatter from the dark palace,
departing, leaving no hardship behind.
Flying to tread the empyrean ridges,
soaring wings toward the Eastern Flower’s Palace.

Winds and clouds chant within the void,
jade sounds scatter in the jasper hall.
Perfected beings chant hymns of emptiness,
exquisite echoes transcend the cloud-chambers.

Unbinding my natural heart,
fulfilling my kalpas’ accumulated merit.
Long whistling above the Nine Mysteries,
clearly gazing upon the void’s sameness.

Dragons sing beyond the abodes,
phoenixes whistle in the Great Aurora’s palace.
Void chants leave no lingering taste,
mournful sounds ride the wind and scatter.

Who can fathom these verses?
Diligently reciting the pristine numinous praises,
to resolve the Nine Yin’s transgressions,
delivering from the Seven Mysteries’ hardships.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected states: *The Supreme Lord’s Pristine Numinous Cavern-Mystery Wondrous Scripture*, since the Primordial Beginning shares life with all, and the numinous texts already exist, the host of perfected beings approach the throne, burn incense, pay homage to the scriptures, and circumambulate while reciting these twenty-one chapters, to celebrate within the divine court.

The Jade Tone resounds with clarity,
piercing through the Nine Heavens.
Its lines are subtle and profound,
their wondrous essence branching wide.
Reciting once, the myriad spirits awaken;
persistently studying, one merges with the Emperor in truth.
It dissolves the heavy burdens of past confrontations,
delivers from the dark palaces of the Seven Mysteries,
releases the Five Sufferings from grieving souls,
and elevates the body to ascend to the heavens of life.

How wondrous and subtle—
this numinous scripture!
*Here ends the Supreme Lord’s Nine Perfected Bright Statutes.*
