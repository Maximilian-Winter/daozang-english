---

The Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits of the Natural Divine Perfection, at the appointed time of the Great Cycle, usher in the Crimson Clarity and the Dawn of Light. The Three Radiances shine resplendent, and the Five Kalpas begin their division.

The Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning, together with the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, the Most Perfected and Honored Spirits, the Limitless Supreme Lords of the Great Dao, the Flying Celestial Beings, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, and their innumerable hosts, all sit within the Cypress Grove Lodge of the Southern Floating Cavernous Yang. In pure discourse and serene stillness, their words flow naturally, their numinous voices harmonizing in tenfold resonance. Their wondrous hymns illuminate the True, filling all heavens with joy. The sun and moon halt their wheels, the stellar lodges traverse in silence, the Nine Heavens’ gates revolve, rivers and seas calm their waves, mountains and peaks swallow their mists, dragons and scaled creatures leap and surge, and gods and humans rejoice as one.

At this moment, the Supreme Limitless Lord of the Dao bows in reverence and addresses the Celestial Venerable: "Today, as we attend this assembly, the Great Vastness dispels the gloom, and the Limitless Worlds are all illumined. The Dharma’s sound resonates afar, its blessings extending to the Ten Directions. Yet the causes of past excesses, kalpa after kalpa, give rise to rebirth, cycling through sacred ranks, assuming the offices of the Assembled Perfected. Now, as we prepare to govern and divide the Six Heavens, to examine the kalpas and order the cycles, to assess and measure the multitudes, to reckon the long night, and to audit the records of the Three Bureaus—our duties are heavy, our labors arduous, and our joys and sorrows defy expression. Daring to ride the numinous winds, I bare my heart in resonance.

Previously, with the Celestial King of Original Beginning, I was in the Azure Grove of Long Mulberry, where we heard the Celestial Venerable proclaim to the Great Sages and Honored Spirits: Within the *Cavernous Mystery’s Celestial Writ and Numinous Treasure’s Jade Mysteries*, there exist the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits, the Twenty-Four Images—above corresponding to the Twenty-Four Perfected, the middle division to the Twenty-Four Qi, and below governing the Twenty-Four Lives. Their numinous chapters gleam resplendent, their wonders surpassing the empty void. Those who behold them have their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers, recorded on golden tablets, and attain transcendence from life and death.

Yet the coming kalpa draws near, and the Three and Five will suffer loss. Countless beings will face shortened lives, drifting through the Eight Difficulties, their bodies tormented by wind and blade, beset by the Five Sufferings, sinking into the long night, deprived of the Three Lights. Ignorant and unknowing, they endure karmic retribution, subject to the cycles of life and death. To witness this moves one to grief, stirring sorrow in gods and humans alike.

Now, the Great Compassion of the Dao’s practice bestows boundless grace. I humbly beseech the Celestial Venerable to take pity, to rely directly upon the Mystic Regulations, and to teach what has not yet been heard—so that those who have not seen may see, those who have not achieved may achieve, and blessings may flow to all, granting favor for a hundred million kalpas.

Should you deign to instruct, I shall then bear the divine winds, spreading the waves, purifying the Three Realms, suppressing the hordes of demons, rectifying the Six Heavens, beheading the legions of evil, pacifying nations and nurturing the people, so that yin and yang may rest in tranquility, enlightened governance may flourish, and the Dao may course through the Great Void."

Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable lifted his face and smiled. From his mouth emerged qi of blue, yellow, and crimson hues, their radiance penetrating all, illuminating the Ten Directions within and without. No darkness remained hidden, and for a kalpa, all was as bright as dawn. Golden script in purple characters, jade texts in cinnabar chapters—resplendent in their brilliance—appeared within the Three Qi. The Eight Radiant Spirits of the Three Divisions and the Twenty-Four Perfected, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, hovered above the Empty Mystery, guarding the numinous writ. The suns and moons of all heavens scattered blossoming light, the myriad streams converged in libation, fragrant incense coiled in eightfold spirals, and the myriad sages rejoiced, all bowing in reverence to the True.

The Celestial Venerable proclaimed: "All beings of this generation, your joy is beyond compare. With hearts laid bare and feelings fully revealed, you shall abide by the Mystic Regulations. The Seven Treasures shall guard the numinous, and a golden altar shall be raised to transmit to you the Way of the Divine Perfected. The Dao is revered, its Dharma weighty—once in forty thousand kalpas is it practiced, descending to the world to deliver beings. If kept secret, the True will descend; if revealed, calamity will arrive. Today, I impart this to you—clearly recognize it."

The Supreme Lord of the Dao rejoiced with exultant praise, standing facing north to receive the command.

The Celestial Venerable commanded the Nine Radiant Perfected of Great Brilliance, the Flying Immortals of the Ten Directions, and the Jade Lads attendant upon the scriptures to unfurl the Ninefold Radiant Jade Writ. They brought forth the golden script with purple characters, the jade-text vermilion chapters—three divisions, eight luminous scenes, and twenty-four diagrams—arrayed upon a white jade table suspended in the void. A nine-colored cloth, woven from cloud-essence and celestial patterns, served as a flying brocade canopy, draped and suspended above the scriptures.

All the Great Sages of the Heavens, the Boundless Celestial Venerables, the Flying Immortal Kings, and the Perfected of the Three Heavens simultaneously oversaw the covenant. They burned incense, scattered blossoms, chanted the numinous verses, and circumambulated the celestial palace, encircling the scriptures thrice. Following the ancient rites of reverent bearing and natural majesty, they transmitted the teachings to the Dao Lord. When the ritual was roughly concluded, the Three Luminaries returned to their positions, and the assembled Perfected withdrew from their seats.

At that time, in the Vermilion Clarity Heaven, whether man or woman, none failed to cultivate virtue, turn their hearts in faith, and aspire toward the Dao—all attained deliverance across the ages.

In the first year of the Supreme August Era, on the second day of the ninth month, the Later Sage, Lord Li, journeyed to the Western River and traversed the Eight Gates. There, he encountered the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, who rode in an eightfold luminous jade chariot, drawn by nine-colored dark dragons and threefold pure flying clouds. A procession of immortals followed, bearing floral banners, lions, and white cranes, their harmonious songs resounding as they floated through the void to convene above the Western River.

Lord Li bowed deeply and inquired of the Celestial King: "Formerly, I received your instruction and was granted the celestial script of jade characters—twenty-four diagrams. Though I obtained the text, I have not fathomed its wondrous chapters; though I possess the illustrated eulogies, their images remain absent. In my cultivation, the mysteries are veiled, and the subtleties of the Dao elude me. Today, I meet the Celestial Venerable—my joy is beyond words. I pray you bestow completion and perfect the Way of the True."

Thereupon, the Celestial King exhaled the Jade Talisman of Internal Vision from the Cavernous Mystery and bestowed it upon Lord Li, instructing him to purify himself with a thousand-day fast, anoint his body with fivefold incense, and face east to ingest the talisman. "When your form and spirit are fully prepared, you shall naturally attain penetrating insight, and all doubts will instantly dissolve."

Lord Li bowed deeply, received the celestial decree, and fully adhered to the heavenly rites. After a thousand-day fast, facing east to ingest the talisman, the Threefold Eightfold Luminous Spirits all manifested within his body. The golden script and jade characters of the twenty-four diagrams shone clearly in the void, their radiant patterns luminous and boundless, their intricate details naturally unfolding.

At that moment, he summoned the Immortal Overseer of Diagrams to render the images. The golden script with purple characters and jade-text vermilion chapters thus resounded in clarity. From the Nine Radiant Perfected Lady Wang of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Twin Floras, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the immortals of the Five Peaks, to the Pure Void Perfected—all who received the true texts were those for whom the Later Sage had inscribed the diagrams, each appended accordingly.

With concentrated focus on the Three Eight Luminous Spirits,
One transcends steps to ascend the Gate of Treasures.

In the first year of the Radiant Crimson Epoch, on the first day of the first month, at the hour of noon, celestial light shone in four directions, purple clouds coiled through the heavens, the Eight Assemblies of Auspicious Clouds gathered, numinous winds swept away dust, sun and moon emitted radiance, the five stars poured forth essences, heaven and earth merged in primordial vastness, fragrant blossoms streamed and scattered, rivers and seas stilled, mountains and peaks concealed their mists. The Five Sufferings were all dissolved, the Three Bonds released souls, the Nine Dark Realms ceased their confrontations, eternal friendships forged alliances, the deaf and blind regained clarity, the Six Afflictions all healed. Earth’s treasuries opened, gold and jade revealed their forms, white bones generated qi, decayed remains returned to human form, dragons and unicorns leapt in joy, birds and beasts flew in delight, the Three Realms knew eternal bliss, humans and spirits rejoiced together. On this day of great celebration, the myriad kalpas were renewed.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable extended his hospitality in the Jade Hall, upon the Crimson Radiance Heaven’s Southern Fire Peak within the Cinnabar Numinous Cavern Palace. He spread out five-colored silks, erected an altar of yellow gold, laid out a foundation of white jade, and with the Seven Treasures invoked the numinous. He transmitted the Cavern Mystery Golden Writ of Purple Characters and Cinnabar Scripts of the Spontaneous Numinous Charts, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminous Spirits, the flying immortals, divine immortals, earthbound immortals, and their hosts of chariots and riders, bestowing them upon the Supreme Peerless Dao Lord. Following the solemn protocols, the mysterious standards, and the luminous statutes of the Perfected, he initiated ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand individuals whose names were inscribed in gold, whose characters were arrayed in the heavens, and who were destined for immortality.

In the midst of the great kalpic cycle, these texts shall be gathered and returned to the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace of the Great Canopy’s Purple Tenuity Palace. Now, under the governance of the Three Caverns, the Numinous Treasure’s Lower Teaching is first to initiate and ascend those who fill the vacancies among the immortal officials of the empty celestial ranks, as ordained by the Worthy Ones of the Central Heavens and the Masters of the Sacred Peaks.

Your servant, [Name], formerly on [Day] of [Month] in [Year], at [Location] in [Prefecture and County], received the method from Master [Name] of the Sacred Peak, also known as the Black Emperor Perfected One or the Northern Peak Master. Your servant’s master, in turn, received the method on the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the year of the Earth Dog from Master Yang of the Central Peak in the Southern Cavern of the Central Heaven, as ordained to further transmit and initiate others. Those whose names were predestined in the golden registers and jade records, who harmonize with perfection, shall be appointed to celestial offices, traversing the Eight Poles, arriving from the midst of emptiness and non-being.

Now, the predestined [Name], Perfected One of [Emperor] of [Heaven], born in the [Stem-Branch] year, whose fate belongs to [Heaven] under [Emperor]’s registry, born in [Month], or the Red Emperor Perfected One [Name], born in the year of the Fire Horse, whose fate belongs to the Vermilion Heaven’s Southern Emperor, registered in the seventh month, refined by the Primordial Qi of the Pure Heaven, whose bones and fate harmonize with perfection, is destined to fill the vacancy of the Second Rank Immortal of the Cavern Mystery. In this year of [Stem-Branch], on [Day] of [Month], in [Heaven], following the ancient statutes of the former master’s luminous great method, ascending the yellow altar, the Seven Treasures securing the numinous, the five hues clarifying the immortal, [Name] received the initiation of the Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Golden Writ of Purple Characters and Cinnabar Scripts, the Charts of the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones of the Three Eight Divisions, and the immortal hosts of chariots and riders. Having received the great method, [Name] is commended by the Three Realms, protected and illuminated by the Numinous Treasure, transcends the Five Paths, and has their name inscribed in the golden tablets and jade records of the Purple Palace, ascending to the rank of Perfected Immortal.

Henceforth, they may roam freely, clad in celestial regalia and feathered garments, borne by cloud chariots and dragon carriages, preceded by the Three-Seven colored standards and phoenix songs, followed by the celestial zither, with the Five Emperors opening the Way and the Supreme Ultimate attending the chariot. Immortal youths and jade maidens scatter blossoms and burn incense, jeweled canopies cast their shade, and guardian spirits escort their journey. [Name]’s qi aligns with the Cavern Mystery, their body ascends to the immortal palace. They must observe proper conduct, guard their speech, refrain from all worldly entanglements, sever external distractions, calm the mind in serene silence, and focus their will upon the method. They must not allow turbidity or mutual inducements to disrupt their qi. In every action, they shall practice great compassion, broadly initiating all beings, ensuring the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity, unifying the Four Seas in tranquility. Their seven generations of ancestors shall all ascend and be initiated, their bodies entering luminous clarity, and they shall be reborn early among humankind. When the great kalpic cycle ends, they shall together ascend to the Clarity Above, carefree in the Golden Gates and the Seven Treasures Grove.

Those who have not yet attained immortal initiation shall prepare for seven years until their celestial qi is fully cultivated. When the celestial signs manifest their numinous response, those destined for immortality shall transmit the method according to the statutes. If there is no spiritual resonance, the method shall not be disseminated for forty thousand kalpas. Those who break their vows, betray their trust, or leak the numinous texts shall have their parents in life and death eternally confined to the dark night, their bodies departing the Five Paths to endure the wind blades for ten thousand kalpas. They dare not speak of this. Following the statutes with utmost sincerity, they shall share the same immortal fate in life and death, their conduct unified in the luminous texts.
