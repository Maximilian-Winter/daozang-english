*The Treatise on Fortune and Longevity by Master Sun of the Tang Dynasty, Ancient and Wondrous in Response*

The sage embodies the Dao yet does not act for it;
The worthy knows calamity yet does not deceive;
The enlightened severs fate yet does not seek;
The faithful preserves trust and abides in stillness;
The benevolent guards virtue with integrity and care;
The scholar refines conduct with humility and reverence;
The common man obscures principle and acts recklessly;
The fool clings to folly without fear;
The petty man inverts the Dao and labors endlessly.

Fortune is the accumulation of good;
Misfortune is the accumulation of evil.
Ghosts and spirits cannot bring man misfortune,
Nor can they bestow fortune—
Only man’s excessive evil shortens his life.

Wealth and nobility gained through arrogance and usurpation are beyond one’s due;
Poverty and lowliness seized through flattery and theft are beyond one’s due.
The spirits record this, though men do not know.
This recording is the cause of the hidden ledgers.
As the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* states:
Man possesses ten thousand spirits,
Governed by the Three Corpses and Nine Worms.
The youths of good and evil record deeds and report above—
How much more so the ledgers of the unseen realm?

The foolish lack spirit;
The spiritually abundant are sages.
Yet one or two faults should not forfeit a life.
Some suffer slander despite rank,
Or sudden demotion,
Their names stricken from the rolls,
Struck by unjust illness—
Mostly due to unrighteous governance.
Those who govern unjustly yet do not die
Have not exhausted their allotted years;
Those who govern justly yet die
Have fulfilled their fate.

The poor often live long;
The rich often die young.
The poor live long because poverty constrains them,
Their constant want spares them from forfeiting years.
The rich die young through excess and extravagance,
Thus their lives are cut short—
Heaven diminishes the surplus to supplement the deficient.

Yet some, impoverished and starving,
Exposed to the elements, their corpses unburied,
Are men of inauspicious hearts.
Their virtue is insufficient, hence their poverty;
Their hearts are insufficient, hence their death.
Though Heaven does not slay them,
They bring ruin upon themselves—
Unfit to dwell among men,
To bear the shelter of Heaven and Earth,
To wear the light of sun and moon,
Such are not truly human.

Thus, those who seize:
Undue rank,
Undue carriages and horses,
Undue wives and concubines—
These are the excesses of unbenevolence.
Undue mansions,
Undue grain and silk,
Undue trade and wealth—
These are the excesses of immoderation.
The spirits record these.
Three years, five years, ten years, twenty years—
Beyond this, the spirits pursue, and death follows.

**Undue Rank:**
Climbing through treachery,
Obtained through bribes,
Held by the unworthy,
Seized through restless grasping,
Forcibly taken—
This is beyond one’s due.
Disaster, illness, death ensue.
The spirits record it; men do not know.

**Undue Carriages and Horses:**
Hoarding horses for low prices,
Demanding fine fodder out of season,
Overworking with whips and bits,
Driving without restraint,
Ignoring exhaustion,
Disregarding distance and fatigue,
Failing to guard treacherous paths—
Beasts cannot speak, but Heaven pities their spent strength.
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Wives and Concubines:**
Many loves demand great expense,
Lust and indulgence breed arrogance.
Gold and jade overflow,
Orchid perfumes are discarded,
Fine silks are despised,
Delicacies are devoured.
What is hard for others is easy for them;
What is bitter for others is joy.
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Servants:**
Treating the good as base,
Reversing right and wrong,
Unmoved by suffering,
Unforgiving of joy,
Ignoring toil in heat and cold,
Unpitying of age and sickness,
Whipping without regard for submission,
Humiliating without distinction—
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Mansions:**
Building vast halls beyond need,
Skimming wages to punish labor,
Using ill-gotten wealth to adorn senseless structures,
Demanding perfection,
Shedding blood and sweat over timber and stone,
Ignoring the poor in crumbling walls,
The humble in thatched huts—
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Grain and Silk:**
Vast planting brings toil,
Harvests are burdensome,
Farming is arduous,
Profits are doubled.
Granaries swell, storing years of surplus,
Yet thieves lurk,
Sparrows and rats nest within.
Farmers are crushed by debt,
Trapped in deep grievance—
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Clothing and Food:**
Silks and brocades overflow,
Yet more are made,
Chests brim without limit,
While the poor freeze, unclothed.
Unmindful of the naked,
Uncaring of plain cloth’s lack,
Moths and rats feast,
Fragrances rot—
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits have recorded it; men do not know.

**Undue Feasting:**
A single meal spans land and sea,
A single drink demands music.
Little is eaten, much is wasted,
While the world lacks coarse grain.
Rich meats are discarded,
Servants and concubines toss scraps in the mire—
This is beyond one’s due.
The spirits record it; men do not know.

**On Gains from Trade:**
Profit from fair exchange is no transgression,
Yet extracting beyond what is just—this is beyond one’s due.

Those who seize extraordinary gain invite omens.
The petty cannot lightly accept such windfalls:
What they sell is cheap, what they charge is dear,
Their folly becomes our plunder.
To profit by plunder is misfortune;
To profit by chance is calamity;
To profit by right is fortune;
To profit by humility is blessing.

A man’s death comes not from dependence or lingering illness,
But from the weight of accumulated unkindness,
The breadth of his wrongdoing—
The spirits pursue him for this.

If one can mend their faults,
Repent their errors,
Bestow the grace of kindness,
Extend the thought of compassion,
Their virtue reaches the unseen realms,
And they may yet endure—
Though past debts still bring their trials.
Otherwise, misfortune multiplies,
Lifespan shortens,
Wealth overflows as fortune depletes.

Ill-gotten riches are shared by kin in blood:
The high are brought low,
The low are undone.
Such wealth is to me as floating clouds—
Not true prosperity.

But those who uphold hidden virtue without deceit:
The sage knows them,
The worthy protect them,
Heaven loves them,
People delight in them,
Spirits revere them.
In wealth, they keep their wealth;
In rank, they keep their rank.
Misfortune does not touch them,
Lifespan is not cut short,
The perils of theft and violence depart,
The disasters of flood and fire vanish.
Thus may one preserve life and fulfill their heavenly years.
