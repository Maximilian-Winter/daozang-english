**The Supreme Orthodox Unity Scriptural Texts**

The Celestial Master bowed his head and inquired of the Most High: "I, Dao-ling, often witness the people of the world ensnared by weariness, illness, imprisonment, and fetters—shackled by water, fire, blades, and warfare, or menaced by tigers, wolves, insects, and serpents. Beset by manifold sufferings and perils, they cannot escape, enduring anguish, bitterness, and untimely death, their misfortunes myriad. From whence do these afflictions arise? What deeds of merit may deliver them? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, to reveal their transgressions, that they may be freed from sorrow and lament."

The Most High addressed Dao-ling, saying: "All this stems from the people’s disbelief in predestined fate and the causes of sin and fortune. They scorn their masters and slight the Dao, violate fasts and break precepts, defy Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars. They sever roots and fell foundations, forsake the upright for the perverse, oppress the poor and lowly, revile and curse spirits, defile the Three Worthies, lack loyalty and filial piety, sow discord among siblings, show no kindness between father and son, no harmony between husband and wife, no propriety between man and woman. They harm one another, resort to deceit in a hundred ways, kill living beings, steal, engage in illicit unions, harbor envy and malice, wallow in greed, folly, and delusion, speak with vicious tongues and sow discord, utter false and frivolous words, consume wine and meat, pollute their innate purity. Relying on strength, they bully the weak; abusing office, they exploit their power. As rulers, they govern without the Dao; as ministers, they are disloyal. They deceive superiors and oppress inferiors, harm the common folk, wrong the loyal and good, indulge in excess without restraint. Thus, they incur illness and suffering, encounter calamities and misfortunes.

For this reason, Heaven has the Nine Shameful Slayer Spirits, each leading a host of ninety million followers. They ride the clouds and command the qi, borne by wind and rain, dwelling in forests and trees, clinging to households. They lie in wait for weakness and fear, attaching to clothing and flowing essence, entering the viscera through food and drink. Or they inhabit dwellings, inflicting the Nine Calamities upon the world, punishing the wicked to guide them back to the good Dao. If one observes fasts, prostrates in worship, practices the Dao, recites scriptures, burns incense, scatters flowers, receives precepts, repents of sins, makes offerings, vows to aid the poor, ransoms lives, builds sacred temples, erects pure abodes, constructs altars and ritual halls, and performs all manner of meritorious deeds, one may escape disaster and peril, attaining deliverance.

But those who disbelieve in the consequences of sin and fortune, who kill living beings, steal, consume wine and meat, slander the Three Treasures, disdain monastics, deface sacred images, and commit all manner of evil—upon them the calamities multiply. They encounter misfortune and ruin: fields and granaries depleted, livestock perishing, official posts revoked, family members dying young, desires unfulfilled, and aspirations unmet.

The Nine Calamities are as follows:

1. **Illness**: Afflictions such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness; epidemic qi and pestilence; sores, abscesses, lumps, and carbuncles; cholera, dysentery, and possession by malevolent spirits. All manner of sickness and suffering cling to the body, preventing eating and drinking. The form wastes away, neither life nor death attainable, day and night tormented, rest and peace impossible.

2. **Imprisonment**: Entanglement in official disputes, false documents, and unjust accusations. Shackled in cangues and fetters, beaten with rods and whips, the body tortured, pain unbearable. Parents, siblings, wives, children, and kin are implicated, enduring years of bondage with no hope of release.

3. **Blades and Warfare**: Encountering tyranny, the slaughter of the worthy and good, or unjust assault by bandits and robbers. Limbs severed, body torn asunder, or conscripted for war, struck by arrows and blades, flesh rent, bones and flesh scattered, fed to birds and beasts. The soul flies to foreign lands, forever without refuge.

4. **Drowning**: Floodwaters surging, submerging the heavens, rivers and valleys churning with waves. Engulfed, father and son perish together, bones and flesh dispersed, filling ditches and gullies, fed to fish and turtles. Or, traveling rivers, seas, and valleys, one meets with sinking and drowning, the form dissolving in the watery abyss.

5. **Fire**: While traversing mountains and marshes, encountering wildfires, or at home, engulfed in flames. The body burns to ashes.

6. **Poison**: Harmed by tigers, wolves, insects, serpents, wasps, scorpions, and all manner of venom, or by toxic plants, flowers, and leaves injuring the skin. Or, poisonous qi and substances enter the body and belly, pain unbearable.

7. **Crushing and Collapse**: Mountains, rocks, cliffs, and houses; tiles and timber collapsing, crushing and breaking the body. Hands and feet injured, head and eyes in agony, rest and repose impossible.

8. **Fright and Terror**: Threatened by official power, water, fire, blades, and warfare; struck by thunder and lightning; menaced by fierce beasts, malevolent spirits, and demons. Suddenly assailed, terror unceasing, the soul and spirit wail in despair, leading to death and ruin.

9. **Hunger and Cold**: Conscripted for public or private labor, journeying afar, encountering perilous terrain, water, fire, warfare, and bandits, pressed and oppressed, lacking clothing and provisions. Or, dwelling in poverty at home, constantly suffering hunger and cold. All these are governed by the Nine Shameful Slayer Spirits.

The Nine Shameful Spirits are:
1. Di Star,
2. Mad Cloud,
3. Multitude of Demons,
4. Heavenly Discord,
5. Swift and Sudden,
6. Sweet Poison,
7. Crystal Madness,
8. Warning Prosperity,
9. Encounter.

Each presides over one calamity, ever roaming the world.

Moreover, there are the Five Thearch Divine Officials, each overseeing five calamities to punish the wicked:

1. **The Divine Official of the Azure Thearch**: Inflicts azure pestilence, azure epidemics, azure poison, azure gu, azure miasma, and azure blight. Those afflicted suffer headaches, high fevers, cold damage, seasonal qi, cholera, dysentery, burning pain in the limbs, stiffness in the shoulders and back, inability to eat or drink, bodily agony, aching bones and flesh, confused speech, and loss of awareness."

The Divine Official of the Vermilion Thearch inflicts vermilion pestilence, vermilion epidemics, vermilion poison, vermilion gu, vermilion miasma, and vermilion blight. Those who encounter these suffer official imprisonment, cangues and fetters, legal disputes and slander, penal servitude and confinement, floggings and torture, and a hundredfold agonies.

The Divine Official of the White Thearch inflicts white pestilence, white epidemics, white poison, white gu, white miasma, and white blight. Those who meet with these face blade and banditry, tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, wasps, and poisonous creatures, all of which strike and harm, wounding and maiming the body.

The Divine Official of the Black Thearch inflicts black pestilence, black epidemics, black gu, black poison, black miasma, and black blight. Those who encounter these drown in rivers, ravines, and mountain streams, swept away and submerged, lost and perishing.

The Divine Official of the Yellow Thearch inflicts yellow pestilence, yellow epidemics, yellow gu, yellow poison, yellow miasma, and yellow blight. Those who meet with these suffer collapsing mountains and crumbling rocks, crumbling houses, broken chariots and dead horses, crushed by grass and trees, and assailed by myriad poisons.

Each of these divine officials commands three million slaying spirits, wielding five blades as they roam the world:

1. **Wood Blade**: When it strikes, the body suffers alternating chills and fever, itching skin, restlessness, aching limbs, madness and confusion, and inability to sit or lie still.
2. **Fire Blade**: When it strikes, one endures splitting headaches, high fevers, body-wide pain and vexation, incoherent speech, and a flushed face.
3. **Metal Blade**: When it strikes, one suffers coughing, labored breathing, aching joints, or sores erupting on the body.
4. **Water Blade**: When it strikes, one endures cholera, dysentery, a dark and ashen complexion, bodily swelling, and aching limbs.
5. **Earth Blade**: When it strikes, one suffers abdominal distension, indigestion, and bloating.

From these five arise a hundred illnesses, wasting the body, scattering the hun and po souls, causing one to dream constantly of wandering with the dead, who steal one’s life tally. Names are inscribed in the Black Register, or lifespans expire beneath the Black Star and Red Constellation, ensnared in Heaven’s Net and Earth’s Trap.

For all who face such calamities, first don the upper garments of one’s body, invoke the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, transcribe this precious scripture, and craft talismans for deliverance from calamity—always in multiples of nine, the more the better. Kindle ever-burning lamps, ceaseless day and night, recite the scripture while pacing the Dao, repent and receive the precepts, burn incense and scatter flowers, prepare vegetarian feasts and chant the Dao, relieve the distressed, release prisoners, bestow alms upon the destitute, redeem lives, erect high seats, summon the virtuous, expound the Great Vehicle, establish temples to deliver beings, and fulfill all good vows without rest, day or night. Only then may one escape calamity and prolong life.

The Most High further states: If one can preemptively craft images of the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies—one, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or as many as one’s strength allows—and transcribe the Three Caverns’ scriptures—one, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand copies—to circulate and recite them, or invite Daoist masters to chant all the scriptures of the Three Caverns, perform rituals, make vows, pray for blessings and avert disasters, and establish temples to deliver beings, this is the foremost and most inconceivable practice.

If unable to do so, simply purify one’s dwelling, bathe body and mind, recite this scripture day and night, bow to the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies, burn incense to dissolve calamities, scatter flowers and make vows, and one will naturally avoid all disasters and obtain boundless blessings.

The Most High says: To dissolve calamities and dispel disasters, take left-twisted blue silk and fashion a nine-stranded cord, nine feet in length. Attach nine rings of gold—or silver or bronze—beginning with one ring at the cord’s end. Burn incense and light lamps, all in multiples of nine. Sit facing east, recite this scripture, and with each recitation or scroll, tie one knot around a ring. After nine knots, add another ring, continuing until nine rings are tied. Then prepare a vegetarian feast to untie the knots, calling this "Dissolving the Nine Calamities of Heaven" and "Unbinding the Nine Knots of Heaven," delivering one’s name to the Nine Heavens, prolonging life with the Nine Perfected. After untying, retie as before. If many participate, each ties and unties their own. Upon completing ninety thousand recitations, one will be calamity-free for life, ascending to the Eastern Florescence.

If, at the time of untying, one crafts images, lamps, and talismans—each in multiples of nine—and praises the blessings of the Nine Heavens, the knots will be lofty indeed. Alternatively, one may recite and tie knots before the Three Worthies or upon the ritual master’s sash. If reciting and tying oneself, do so upon one’s own sash.

This is the Rite of Bowing to the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies.

Facing east, bow ninety times; facing southeast, bow one hundred twenty times; facing south, bow thirty times; facing southwest, bow one hundred twenty times; facing west, bow seventy times; facing northwest, bow one hundred twenty times; facing north, bow fifty times; facing northeast, bow one hundred twenty times. Then, facing northwest, bow three hundred sixty times to the Upper Realm; facing southeast, bow one hundred twenty times to the Lower Realm. Each direction totals one thousand two hundred bows, and with each bow, recite the name of the Heavenly Worthy of that direction, saying:

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Supreme Emperor of the East.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, Who Nurtures Life and Delivers Destiny.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the South, Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, Supreme Void Sovereign of Great Spirit.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the West, Supreme Mystery and Utmost Limit.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, Primordial Measure and Great Splendor.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the North, Mysterious Supreme and Jade Dawn.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, Who Delivers Immortals and Supreme Sages.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, Luminous Sovereign of Jade Clarity.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, True Sovereign and Cavern Spirit.

Upon completing the bows to each direction, kneel long, offer incense thrice, and confess:
Disciple So-and-so, a mortal of flesh, a common being in the world, has since the age of seven transgressed heaven and violated earth, cursed wind and rain, shunned dew and stars, slighted the Three Treasures, defiled the Ten Directions, disregarded precepts and prohibitions, slandered the true and upright, been disloyal and unfilial, killed living beings, stolen, engaged in deviant lust and perversion, uttered frivolous and false speech, spoken harshly and maliciously, and committed boundless transgressions beyond record. Unaware until now, I today repent and take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies, beseeching your great compassion to absolve and pardon my immeasurable sins. I pray to be delivered from calamities, my name inscribed in the Register of Immortals and Longevity. Again, I offer incense thrice, kowtow, and strike my cheeks.

The Most High said: On one’s natal year, the year of the Grand Year Star, and the great and lesser tomb positions, light lamps and recite scriptures to dissolve calamities and dispel misfortune. On the twelve hours and twenty-eight constellations, light lamps to prolong life and increase destiny. At the gate and household, light lamps to increase population and attract wealth. In the courtyard, light the Seven Stars lamps to dissolve imprisonment and confinement. In all cases, burn incense and recite scriptures.

It is further said: Regularly on the new moon, full moon, last day of the month, and during purificatory fasts, burn incense and light the twenty-eight constellations’ lamps, unwavering day and night. The Heavens will then reverse death and grant rebirth, increase destiny and prolong life. If one recites the great scriptures of the Three Caverns, blessings will descend without end.

The Heavenly Master bowed, praised its excellence, and withdrew.
