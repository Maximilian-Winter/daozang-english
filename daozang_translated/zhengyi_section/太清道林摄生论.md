**The Supreme Clarity Grove’s Treatise on Nurturing Life**

The Perfected One said: Though one may regularly consume elixirs, without knowing the art of nurturing life, it is still difficult to attain longevity.

The Dao of nurturing life abhors finishing a meal and immediately lying down, as well as sitting for long periods throughout the day—both diminish lifespan. One should engage in light labor, but never to the point of exhaustion or straining beyond one’s capacity.

After eating, one ought to stroll leisurely, finding joy in some activity. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, nor do door hinges rot, for they are in motion. One must not eat at night; after a meal, one should walk, covering several *li* back and forth. Overeating breeds a hundred illnesses, and undigested food forms accumulations.

Eat little but often; avoid large, single meals, for they are hard to digest. Always maintain a state of being neither too full nor too hungry—sated yet slightly peckish, peckish yet slightly sated.

Thus, those skilled in nurturing life eat when first hungry and drink when first thirsty. After eating, one should walk, and upon finishing, have another rub the abdomen with their hands several hundred times. This aids digestion, greatly benefits the person, enhances appetite, and prevents all illness.

Do not habitually keep the mouth open, for it leads to qi loss and allows pathogenic influences to enter. Sleeping curled on one’s side strengthens qi and vigor more than lying flat on the back.

In spring, retire early and rise early; in summer and autumn, go to bed late and rise early; in winter, retire early. All these practices benefit one’s health. Though rising early is advised, never do so before the cock’s crow; though late rising is mentioned, never do so after sunrise.

In winter, when heaven and earth are closed and blood and qi are stored, one must not labor to the point of sweating, lest yang qi be dissipated and harm befall the person.

The Dao of nurturing life avoids prolonged walking, standing, sitting, lying, listening, or gazing. It shuns overeating, forced eating, excessive drunkenness, heavy lifting, anxiety, sorrow, rage, overwhelming joy, jumping, excessive weeping, obsessive desire, or brooding resentment—all of which shorten lifespan. If one can avoid these transgressions, longevity is attainable.

Do not drink excessively; if one does, vomiting promptly is best. One must not engage in sexual activity while drunk, nor expose oneself to wind, nor fan oneself for long—all invite illness. Sleeping drunk in the open or among dense vegetation may cause leprous sores. Drinking to excess and forcing oneself to eat may lead to abscesses, ulcers, or other sores.

Engaging in sexual activity while drunk or overfull may cause minor ailments such as facial blemishes and coughing, or grave ones like severed visceral channels and loss of life. One must not run, ride in a carriage, or jump about while drunk or overfull.

One must not suppress the urge to urinate during sexual activity, for it may cause strangury, pain in the penis, or loss of facial complexion. If angered by another and one’s blood and qi remain unsettled, engaging in sexual activity may cause abscesses.

If a woman’s menstrual flow has not ceased and one engages in sexual activity with her, it may cause illness and lead to vitiligo. After washing one’s hair, avoid wind exposure, do not tie it up while wet, and do not sleep with the head as a pillow—these may cause dizziness, stuffiness, hair loss, facial swelling, toothache, or deafness.

After eating, rinse the mouth several times to preserve the teeth and freshen the breath. Do not wear damp or sweaty clothes for long, as they may cause sores or wind-pain. Do not rinse the mouth with fermented water, for it causes bad breath. If one sweats heavily, wash promptly; otherwise, it may lead to urinary difficulty.

In spring, do not wear thin clothing, lest one contract cold damage, cholera, indigestion, or headaches.

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Someone asked, “Is what you call harm solely in the realm of sexual desire?” He replied, “How could it be limited to that alone?”

The essence of long life lies in the chamber arts. The superior practitioner who masters them may prolong their years and dispel illness; the mediocre practitioner avoids self-injury. If one is still young and strong, yet knows how to return the Yin elixir to replenish the brain and gather the sevenfold essences from the enduring customs, they may live a hundred or two hundred years without medicine—though they may not attain immortality.

Those who fail to guard themselves are like ancient men who filled cups with boiling water or stored fire in halls of feathers. Moreover, straining beyond one’s capacity injures; forcing what one cannot bear injures; brooding in sorrow and anger injures; grieving in desolation injures; excessive joy injures; urgent cravings injure; lingering anxieties injure; prolonged talking and laughter injure; untimely rest injures; drawing bows and bending crossbows injure; indulging in wine until vomiting injures; overeating injures; leaping, running, and panting injure; wailing and weeping injure; and the failure of Yin and Yang to unite injures. When accumulated injuries reach their limit, one dies prematurely—such is not the Dao.

Thus, the methods of nurturing life require: spitting not far, walking not in haste, ears not straining to listen, eyes not fixed in prolonged gaze, sitting not to exhaustion, standing not to fatigue, lying not in discomfort, dressing before the cold arrives, and disrobing before the heat sets in. Do not eat only when ravenous, nor overfill the stomach; do not drink only when parched, nor consume excessively. Overeating leads to stagnation and accumulations; overdrinking breeds phlegm and obstructions.

Avoid extreme exertion, extreme idleness, profuse sweating, excessive spitting, galloping on horseback, gazing into the far distance, frequent shivering, drinking wine in the wind, prolonged bathing, ambitious scheming, or prying into strange crafts. In winter, avoid extreme warmth; in summer, extreme chill. Do not expose yourself to the stars at night or sleep beneath a fan. Great cold, great heat, fierce winds, and heavy dew—all should be avoided.

The five flavors entering the mouth should not be taken in excess: too much sour harms the spleen, too much bitter harms the lungs, too much pungent harms the liver, too much salty harms the heart, and too much sweet harms the kidneys—this is the natural principle of the five phases. What is called "harm" may not be immediately felt, but over time it shortens life.

Therefore, those skilled in nurturing life rise and retire according to the seasons, maintain harmonious routines in daily life, regulate sinews and bones through proper postures, ward off illness and repel evil with breath techniques, circulate *ying* and *wei* through supplementation and drainage, and balance labor and rest with moderation. They restrain anger to preserve Yin *qi*, and temper joy to nourish Yang *qi*. Only then do they first use herbs to remedy deficiencies, and later ingest the Golden Elixir to secure eternity. The principles of nurturing life are fully encompassed here.

As for those who seek immediate gratification, claiming to be enlightened and resigned to fate, dismissing heterodoxies, indulging their passions, and neglecting longevity—when they hear these words, they pass them by like wind through the ears or lightning across the eyes, unable to comprehend. Though their bodies wither in dissipation and their breath fails in sensual excess, they remain content. How can one speak to them of nurturing life? Not only will they refuse to accept it, but they will call it falsehood—like offering a bright mirror to the blind or silk and bamboo music to the deaf.

The Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The human body is like a kingdom. The chest and abdomen are its palace halls, the four limbs its borders, the joints its officials, the spirit its ruler, the blood its ministers, and *qi* its people. Thus, governing the people secures the nation; cherishing one’s *qi* preserves the body. When the people scatter, the nation falls; when *qi* is exhausted, the body perishes. What is lost cannot be revived; what is destroyed cannot be restored. Therefore, the sage eliminates dangers before they arise, treats illness before it manifests, heals in times of peace rather than chasing after its departure. The people are easily endangered but difficult to pacify; *qi* is easily polluted but difficult to purify. Thus, one examines virtue to safeguard the state, curbs desires to fortify blood and *qi*. Only then does the True Unity abide, the Three and Seven are preserved, the hundred illnesses retreat, and longevity extends.

At dawn, upon rising, face south, stretch both hands upon the knees, and with the mind’s eye, guide the *qi* from the crown of the head down to the *yongquan* points. Doing this daily is called "sending *qi*." Always inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, gently, without opening the mouth wide. Exhale less, inhale more. Before eating, first send *qi* into the abdomen. Be the master of your meals.

Do not speak while lying down, for the five viscera are like bells and chimes—without suspension, sound cannot be produced. Do not speak while walking; if you must speak, stand still first. Speaking while walking causes one to lose *qi*. Every person has four uprightnesses: upright walking, upright sitting, upright standing, and upright speech.

Hunger requires eating, eating requires fullness, fullness requires walking. Walk with the gait of the goose-king, speak with the resonance of a muffled bell, and sleep in the lion’s repose—lying on the left side with knees bent. Chant to yourself:

*"Fine food must be chewed thoroughly,
Raw food should not be swallowed whole.
Ask where I dwell,
In the great estate of Wulin Village.
Guard the breath to protect the five viscera,
When *qi* reaches the bones, one becomes an immortal."*

Another chant goes:

*"Daily consume three poisons,
Yet if unchewed, they dissolve on their own.
Brocade adorns the five viscera,
While the body wears a robe of filth and dust."*

Always remember: one must guard the five spirits—heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, and liver. Never indulge in idle thoughts. Dwelling alone in an empty room, if the mind drifts to desires, great evil and perverse *qi* arise. When sitting for long, rise to urinate; when standing for long, sit to urinate.

If there are scriptures or images in the home, bow to them upon entering or leaving, then pay respects to elders. Do not eat after sunset, for ghosts and spirits roam above. Keep the mind from wandering outward, focusing intent on the *yongquan* points.

Eat mallow once every ten days, for its slipperiness unblocks the five viscera and disperses stagnant *qi*. It is the king of vegetables, but do not eat it with its core—remove the core before consuming.

On the Winter Solstice, one may speak but not engage in idle talk. "Speaking" refers to self-expression; "talking" refers to responding to others. If someone asks a question, answer, but do not force conversation. Be cautious in all things, for carelessness harms one’s *qi*.

Each Winter Solstice, spread thick straw beneath the north wall to receive primordial *qi*. From the first day of the eighth month onward, warm the feet with gentle fire to prevent coldness below.

The master’s intent is to keep *qi* below and prevent its upward leakage. In spring, when the thaw has not yet risen, wear thicker clothing below and thinner above to nurture yang and gather yin, ensuring generational longevity. Nurturing yin and gathering yang leads to family ruin.

These are the practices of conduct and desire. Daily *qi*-sending ensures smooth circulation. Do not eat raw vegetables, uncooked rice, small beans, or spoiled and foul foods. Do not drink turbid wine or eat rancid food, for they obstruct *qi* and cause death. Avoid walking like a ghost or stepping on grains, refrain from excessive laughter and speech, and do not pull or grasp at others.

Sleeping with heels together is not objectionable; stretching upon waking is not objectionable. If one stretches while sleeping, ghostly entities gain opportunity—stretching is only permissible upon waking. When sleeping, first calm the mind, then close the eyes.

Chew food thoroughly so that the essence of grains enters the intestines; do not let the fat of wine enter the abdomen. Gradually reduce salt intake. Never nap during the day, for it causes loss of *qi*. If one has no deficiencies or leaks in the five fluids, one may attain immortality.

In the fourth and tenth months, avoid the bedchamber—these are months when yin and yang are purely mundane. *Qi* begins at the Winter Solstice, rising from the *yongquan* points beneath the soles of the feet. By the eleventh month, it reaches the knees; by the twelfth, the thighs; by the first month, the waist—this is called the completion of the Three Yangs. By the second month, it reaches the shoulders; by the third, the neck; by the fourth, the crown. These are the months when pure yang governs, and yin follows similarly.

When eating, do not be troubled. When consuming the five flavors, avoid sudden anger, for it startles the spirit and causes nightmares of flying. "Trouble" arises from accumulation; "vexation" from conflict.

At night, perform the Five Coverings, fearing the passage of watches. Do not face wind or sun while drunk, for it induces madness. Urinate or defecate as soon as the need arises—do not suppress it. Do not enter the bedchamber after a full meal, after sunset, or while speaking or reciting. If recitation is necessary, wait until dawn.

In all walking, standing, or sitting, do not turn your back to the sun or moon. Even when reciting or speaking, always imagine the voice residing in the *qi*-sea below the navel.

In winter, when cold prevails, do not speak loudly or open the mouth wide. After eating, rub the face and abdomen with the hands to promote the flow of fluids. Upon rising in the morning, eat first, then wash and groom.

In summer, regularly consume warm rice; in winter, eat fine rice porridge. In the second and third months, eat leeks—they greatly benefit the body. Keep the mind from wandering outward, for this is the foundational method for a true person beginning Daoist practice. One who can consistently adhere to this will sit amidst epidemics without fear.

Always practice inner visualization, seeing the five viscera like suspended bells—clear and distinct, without obstruction. Upon rising, focus on speaking only of good matters; do not first calculate wealth or property. Sleeping with heels together and stretching upon waking is not objectionable.

In dwelling, avoid ornate and luxurious decor, for it breeds insatiable greed—the root of misfortune. Instead, keep things refined, simple, and clean, shielding against wind, rain, heat, and dampness. Do not adorn clothing or utensils with pearls, jade, gold, or jewels, for they deepen faults and plant the roots of vexation.

Do not allow the kitchen to overflow with dried meats; always practice frugality. Do not eat much meat, for it generates a hundred illnesses. Eat little meat and more rice and vegetables; avoid consuming multiple kinds of meat in one meal.

If the heart harbors affection, do not indulge it deeply; if it harbors resentment, do not dwell on it, for both harm nature and injure the spirit. Do not excessively praise or criticize. Always maintain equanimity toward things; if imbalance is detected, correct it immediately.

Whether in poverty or wealth, do not assume permanence. In either state, one must uphold the Dao. Do not let poverty or wealth alter your resolve or change your nature. Understand the principles deeply, yet appear as if unable to speak. With great merit and virtue, do not boast.

From fifty to a hundred years of age, keep fine medicine close at hand, good words ever on the lips, and wayward thoughts from the mind. Always approach all things with utmost sincerity and reverence.

Guard against feigning goodness to please the heart. If, though one performs good deeds all one’s life, others still resent it, do not grow bitter—calm the heart with Dao and virtue. Never say that doing good brings no good reward, nor nurse grievance against fate.

In all circumstances, let the heart know no discontent. If discontent arises, suppress it at once; do not let it take root. Wherever one goes, excessive craving only wearies and torments the mind.

Most human illness stems from failure to nurture one’s nature. In times of peace and ease, one may claim to seek only moderation, yet still indulge in reckless desires. Whatever the heart fancies, one pursues without restraint or taboo, deceiving both the seen and unseen, sparing no transgression. One ought to reflect deeply, examine one’s conscience, and diligently cultivate body and mind through constant good deeds and self-examination.

Thus it is said: those who skillfully nurture life practice the twelve fewer—fewer thoughts, fewer cares, fewer desires, fewer affairs, fewer words, fewer laughs, fewer sorrows, fewer joys, fewer delights, fewer angers, fewer attachments, fewer aversions. These twelve fewer are the essential covenant of nurturing one’s nature.

Excessive thought wearies the spirit; excessive care scatters it. Excessive desire dulls wisdom; excessive affairs exhaust the body. Excessive speech provokes contention of qi; excessive laughter harms the viscera. Excessive sorrow bridges the heart; excessive joy stifles the mind. Excessive delight breeds confusion and chaos; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels. Excessive attachment leads to obsession and folly; excessive aversion brings emaciation and joylessness. These twelve excesses, if not eliminated, are the root of life’s ruin. Only those who neither indulge in excess nor deficiency come near the Dao.

**Miscellaneous Prohibitions of the Yellow Emperor, Chapter Three**

The *Essential Record* states:
- **Daily prohibition:** Do not eat to satiety at dusk.
- **Monthly prohibition:** Do not become heavily intoxicated at dusk.
- **Yearly prohibition:** Do not travel far at dusk.
- **Lifelong prohibitions:** Do not engage in the bedchamber by lamplight at dusk; always guard the qi at dusk.

Prolonged gazing injures the blood; prolonged exposure injures the qi; prolonged standing injures the bones; prolonged walking injures the sinews; prolonged sitting injures the flesh.

Salt injures the sinews; vinegar injures the bones. Overeating injures the lungs; hunger injures the qi. If water from a leaking thatched roof drips onto dried meat, eating it causes abdominal masses. Any dried meat that refuses to dry properly is harmful. If sacrificial meat moves on its own, eating it harms the person. If bees land on food or drink, the food is certainly poisoned.

**Daily prohibition:** Do not eat to satiety at night.
**Monthly prohibition:** Do not become heavily intoxicated at dusk.
**Yearly prohibition:** Do not travel far at dusk.
**Lifelong prohibition:** Do not engage in the bedchamber by lamplight.

If one returns from the cold while still chilled and eats hot food, it causes stabbing wind. After eating, lying supine causes black moles and head wind. Do not speak while eating; those who speak while eating often suffer chest and back pain. After eating hot food, rinsing the mouth with cold water or wine causes chronic bad breath and tooth decay. Eating raw meat harms the stomach; all meat must be thoroughly cooked and eaten only when cooled. Avoid all damp foods and beverages, including wine and water, that do not reflect one’s image when held up to the light—eating them causes sudden convulsions. If one has already eaten and feels abdominal distension, take purgative medicine at once. After eating salty hot foods, do not drink cold beverages, lest one lose one’s voice and develop corpse-throat.

If one has a chronic illness, do not eat freshwater carp, which harms the person. Never drink to the point of intoxication, or a hundred ailments will plague one for life. Prolonged drinking rots the intestines and stomach, soaks the marrow, steams the sinews, harms the spirit, and shortens life. Do not eat any brain—it is highly beneficial.

Men should not sleep with their heads facing north or directly beneath a roof beam. After returning from outside, do not leave a lamp burning, lest the hun-soul, po-soul, and six spirits grow restless, leading to frequent sorrow and resentment.

Do not place a bed against a north-facing wall, nor sit facing north for long—it invites misfortune. Do not stare angrily at the sun or moon for long, lest one lose one’s sight. If a man sees a straight wall ten paces away, do not walk alongside it, for the wind’s sharpness may cause madness or heaviness of the body.

After sweating heavily, do not remove clothing at once, lest one contract partial wind and become half-paralyzed. When sleeping at night, do not let the ear be exposed to drafts, lest one go deaf. After long travel and fatigue, do not engage in the bedchamber, lest one suffer the five taxations, depletion, and diminished offspring. If an object sinks when placed in water, eating it causes cold damage that lasts a lifetime.

If one walks while sweating, do not rest with legs dangling in the forest, lest one develop blood impediment, lumbar pain, and heavy legs. After eating hot food, do not expose oneself to wind, lest one develop convulsions, headaches, dry eyes, and excessive sleepiness.

Do not sing or chant before sleep—it invites misfortune. Do not speak loudly while sleeping, lest one deplete qi and strength. Do not place a brazier near the head while sleeping, lest the fire’s qi cause heaviness of the head, red eyes, and dry nose.

In winter, keep the feet warm and the head cool; in spring and autumn, keep both head and feet cool—this is the sage’s constant rule. Do not cover the head while sleeping, and one will attain longevity.

If someone is in a nightmare, do not light a lamp and call out to them—this will surely cause death by nightmare. Even if one hears them, do not approach or call urgently. Do not sleep with feet dangling from a high place, lest one develop kidney disease, cold feet, and depletion of the bedchamber.

After returning from outside, do not gape with the mouth open, lest one develop wasting-thirst and lose one’s complexion.

On the *yin* day of the first month, burning white hair brings good fortune. On any *yin* day, trimming fingernails and on a *wu* day trimming toenails, as well as burning white hair, all bring good fortune.

At dawn, do not be angry or vexed. In the morning, do not shout or curse. Do not speak ill, do not point feet toward fire, and do not scold or revile in front of the privy. Do not drink to excess at night. Do not overtax the mind or overwork the body. If affairs turn unfavorable, do not sigh or lament, nor cry out “what to do?”—this invites misfortune.

Do not sit with knees drawn up and arms crossed over them. Do not let hair cover the face—both are inauspicious.

At dawn, always speak of good deeds. Upon hearing of evil matters, face the direction from which they came and spit three times—this brings good fortune. If one has an ill dream at night, do not speak of it. At daybreak, recite toward the east over water, chanting: *"Let evil dreams cling to grass and trees; let good dreams become pearls and jade."* Thus, no misfortune shall come.

Whenever ascending a platform or taking a seat, remove the left shoe first. Whether walking or riding a horse, do not look back, lest the spirit depart. Do not kill turtles or snakes. Do not travel far in dense mist. When setting out on a journey, always visualize the *Kuixing* and *Waidou* constellations above your head—all directions will then be auspicious. If going to war, visualize the Dipper’s handle pointing ahead toward the enemy—this brings good fortune.

Do not urinate or defecate facing north—some say facing west. Do not spit toward the north, for this offends the *Kuixing* and *Waidou* spirits and brings misfortune. Some say, do not don robes or sashes facing north—this is inauspicious. Do not eat the meat of the zodiac animal corresponding to your parents’ birth year, for it shortens one’s lifespan and brings misfortune. Do not eat the meat of your own zodiac animal, for it causes the hun and po souls to scatter. Do not sing or mourn on the La Festival—this is inauspicious.

Upon rising in the morning, put on clothes in the order they were removed—this brings good fortune. If clothing appears luminous, shake it three times before the door while chanting: *"Away with calamity! Away with calamity!"*—this brings good fortune.

Do not block or soak abandoned wells—this causes deafness and blindness. Upon rising in the morning, do not wash your face with eyes open, for it makes the eyes dry and prone to blindness and ill fortune. Husband and wife should not bathe on the same day; bathe on the last day of the lunar month and wash hair on the first. When traveling and overheated, do not wash your face with river water, for it causes dark blemishes. If boiling water is left overnight, washing the body with it causes scabies, washing the face dims its glow, and eating rice cooked with it causes sores.

Holding back urine causes cold knees and paralysis. Suppressing bowel movements causes qi hemorrhoids. Do not urinate in anger, for it chills the feet and knees. When defecating, do not hold your breath or strain, for it causes lumbar pain and menstrual irregularities—let it flow naturally. Washing the head with hot water and the feet with cold water causes head wind; washing hair after drinking water also causes head wind. Washing hair at night and going outside without eating causes heart deficiency and excessive sweating. If dreaming excessively, do not cough, for coughing then brings illness. After sweating, do not bathe with cold water, lest the pericardium fail to recover.

Mercury must not be brought near the genitals, for it causes the jade stem to shrink and wither; nor should it be brought near the teeth, for it causes swelling, damage, and tooth loss. The two fats of deer must not be brought near the genitals, for they cause impotence. Unrefined alum must not be used in medicine, for it harms the heart and liver. Calomel must not be used to treat tapeworm, for its lead enters the abdomen and causes cold diseases. On an empty stomach, do not encounter foul odors from corpses, for they enter the nose, cause white patches on the tongue, and leave a constant stench in the mouth. If you must see a corpse, drink wine first—this wards off poison.

In summer, do not expose yourself to dew beneath the eaves, for it thickens the facial skin, causes scabies, or—some say—facial wind. Do not drink cold water from deep, shaded places, for it causes malaria. When encountering a spirit shrine, take care not to enter rashly; if you enter, do so with reverence—this brings good fortune. Do not let your eyes wander or gaze recklessly; treat the shrine as you would a stern lord, and your blessings will be abundant. If you show disrespect, you will incur misfortune. Nor should you turn your head to look back.

If you suddenly encounter dragons or serpents, do not be startled or regard them with wonder, nor fix your gaze upon them. Should you witness strange lights or uncanny transformations, forcibly restrain yourself from reacting with alarm—for as the saying goes, "See the strange and treat it as unstrange, and the strangeness will dissolve of itself."

Whenever you see an exceptionally beautiful woman, take care not to stare or grow fond of her, for she may well be a *chimei* spirit, intent on ensnaring you with deep affection. This holds true whether you are in a desolate mountain, an open wilderness, or among a dense crowd—speak neither praise nor censure.

When a woman’s monthly flow arrives, she should not eat scallions or garlic, lest she suffer from bloody strangury.

Do not use the fat of bears or boars for lamp oil, for the smoke will enter the eyes and impair distant vision.

Never let a mother’s breastmilk fall into a child’s eye, or the pupil will rupture and a film will form.

Do not let children point at the moon, or sores will appear beside their ears; these should be cut away and are called "moon-eclipse sores."

Apply toad powder to all sores, and insects will not feed on them.

A woman who has just given birth should not be near anyone with a foul body odor, lest her hair swell and fester.

Do not bathe in waters infested with sand fleas, for they harm the body.

When crossing a river, follow behind horses or donkeys—this brings good fortune.

Where water crossbows lie in wait, they will shoot at a person’s reflection and cause death. Before crossing, strike the water’s surface with an object to trigger the crossbow; then cross swiftly, and you will remain unharmed.

Do not linger in places where mountain streams flow through black soil, for drinking such water often causes emaciation, aggravates *qi* disorders, and may provoke sudden sores—especially dangerous for the sick.

In mountains with caverns, only enter in the third or ninth month to gather treasures; in all other months, the mountains are sealed, and their *qi* will kill.

When lying down, face east in spring and summer, and west in autumn and winter—this is the constant rule.

When hungry, urinate while seated; when full, urinate while standing. Observe this carefully to avoid illness and prevent depletion.

Always take your meal when the sun is at *si* (9–11 a.m.); after eating, refrain from drinking wine, and you will never suffer from dry retching.

The Dao of nurturing life lies in preserving essence and not leaking it—this is the key to longevity. If you can refrain from leakage, after fifty days your waist and legs will grow light, your eyes sharp, and you will remain tireless even after a hundred battles.

**Section Four: The Method of Self-Massage**

Perform these exercises thrice daily; after one month, all ailments will vanish, and your stride will match that of a galloping horse—this is the supreme method of the immortals.

1. Clasp the hands together and twist them as if washing.
2. Interlace the fingers loosely and turn the palms toward the chest.
3. Clasp the hands and press them against the thighs, alternating left and right.
4. Place one hand over the other on the thigh and slowly twist the torso.
5. Pull an imaginary bow with the strength of five *dan*, alternating left and right.
6. Make a fist and thrust forward, alternating left and right.
7. Push forward as if moving a boulder, alternating left and right.
8. Strike downward with the fist to open the chest, alternating left and right.
9. Clasp the head with both hands and roll it over the thighs—this is the method for stretching the ribs.
10. Place both hands on the ground, draw the body inward, arch the spine, and lift upward three times.
11. Sit with legs extended, lean to one side, and push outward as if moving a mountain, alternating left and right.
12. Strike the back with the hands, alternating left and right.
13. Sit with legs extended, then pull one foot forward in a swift motion, alternating left and right.
14. Place both hands on the ground, turn the head to look back—this is the "Tiger Gazing" method, alternating left and right.
15. Stand, place both hands on the ground, and arch the body backward three times.
16. Quickly interlace the fingers and step onto them with the feet, alternating left and right.
17. Rise and step forward and backward with the feet, alternating left and right.
18. Sit with legs extended, cross them at the shins, hook the extended foot with the hand, place it on the opposite knee, and press down, alternating left and right.

These eighteen postures, if practiced thrice daily by the elderly, will continually replenish vitality, extend life, cure all diseases, improve appetite, sharpen vision, and prevent fatigue.

**Method of Using Qi, Fifth**
Every day at dawn and dusk—these are the times when yin and yang transform.
At the first watch of the early morning, when warm *qi* arrives, frequently stretch and open the eyes while lying down; this is when the ascending *qi* arrives, called "yang grows while yin wanes."
After sunset, when cold *qi* arrives, one shivers; this is the time to sit or sleep, when the descending *qi* arrives, called "yang wanes while yin grows."
After sunset, cold *qi* constantly enters and exits.
In the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, seas and all living things—humans, animals, plants, and the myriad beings—there is ceaseless alternation and exchange.
Advancing and retreating, like the alternation of day and night, like the tides of rivers and seas, this is the Dao of the waxing and waning of heaven and earth.

Face south, extend both hands upon the knees, and slowly press and knead the joints.
Exhale turbid *qi* through the mouth, and inhale pure *qi* through the nose.
Exhaling expels old *qi*, also called "dead *qi*."
Inhaling draws in new *qi*, also called "living *qi*."
Thus, the *Laozi* says: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth. It flows continuously, as if existing; its use is never exhausted."
This means the mouth is the gate of heaven and earth, through which the *qi* of yin and yang, life and death, is exhaled and inhaled.

After a long while, slowly push with the hands—left, right, upward, downward, forward, and backward.
Glaring with wide-open eyes, tilt the head back, pull the ears, twist the hair, bend the waist, cough, and emit yang to create vibrations—perform these actions in pairs or singly, using the reverse hand.
Then pull the feet upward while lying on the back, counting to eighty or ninety before stopping.
Lie down calmly, compose the mind, and practice the method of inner contemplation.
Visualize the Great Harmony’s primordial *qi* in the void, gradually descending to the hairline, then entering the crown like sunlight breaking through clouds.
It penetrates the skin, flesh, bones, and brain, gradually descending into the abdomen, nourishing the four limbs and five viscera like water seeping into the earth.
When fully permeated, one hears a gurgling sound in the abdomen.
Focus the mind and concentrate without distraction; soon, the primordial *qi* reaches the *qi* sea, and in a moment, it flows to the *yongquan* points.
When fully permeated, the body trembles, the feet curl, and even the sound of joints cracking may be heard—this is called "one cycle."
One or two cycles, up to three or five cycles per day, will make the body feel moist and radiant, the complexion glow, the skin and hair smooth, the ears and eyes sharp.
It enhances appetite, strengthens vitality, and eliminates all illnesses.
After five or ten years of consistent practice, one will not forget it.
Achieving ten thousand cycles brings one close to immortality.

**Method of Regulating Qi**
Peng Zu said: The Dao of harmonizing the spirit and guiding *qi* requires a secluded room with closed doors, a warm mat, and a pillow two and a half inches high.
Lie flat on the back, close the eyes, and hold the breath in the chest.
Place a goose feather on the nose; if it does not move for three hundred breaths, with no hearing, no sight, and no thought, then cold and heat cannot harm you, and wasps and scorpions cannot poison you.
You will live to three hundred and sixty years, approaching the state of a true person.

Peng Zu said: The Dao is not complicated. Simply refrain from thinking of clothing and food, sounds and colors, victory and defeat, right and wrong, gain and loss, honor and disgrace.
Free the mind from vexation, avoid overexerting the body, and persist in guiding and circulating *qi*—this too can lead to longevity, living a thousand years without dying.
Ordinary people cannot be without thoughts, but these should be gradually dispelled.
The human body is empty and insubstantial, containing only wandering *qi*.
When *qi* is regulated properly, no illnesses arise.
If its regulation is improper, all diseases emerge.
Thus, those who cultivate health must know the method of regulating *qi*.

**Method of Regulating Qi**
This cures all major illnesses; after a hundred days, even the eyebrows and temples will regrow—other benefits need not be mentioned.
The method of regulating *qi* works best from midnight to noon, when *qi* is alive and can be regulated.
From noon to midnight, *qi* is dead and cannot be regulated.
When regulating *qi*, lie on the back on a thick, soft mat, with the pillow adjusted so the head and body are level.
Stretch the hands and legs, clench the fists with the thumbs inside, keeping the hands four or five inches from the body, and the feet four or five inches apart.
Inhale *qi* through the nose to the feet, then pause; if strong, inhale more and hold longer.
When the breath feels stifled, exhale slowly through the mouth until empty, then inhale slowly through the nose again, following the same method as before.
For those suffering from chills, fever, or sudden swelling, regulate *qi* before the condition flares up, within one meal’s time after noon.

Should the condition fail to improve, repeat the method the following day as previously described.

For those suffering from cold in the heart, exhale the *qi* with a *hu* (呼) breath.
For heat diseases, exhale the *qi* with a *chui* (吹) breath.
For liver diseases, exhale the *qi* with a *xu* (嘘) breath.
For lung diseases, exhale the *qi* with a *he* (呵) breath.
For spleen diseases, exhale the *qi* with a *xi* (嘻) breath.
For kidney diseases, exhale the *qi* with a *ye* (咽) breath.

After midnight: eighty-one repetitions.
Before the crow of the magpie: seventy-two repetitions.
At dawn: sixty-three repetitions.
At sunrise: fifty-four repetitions.
At mealtime: forty-five repetitions.
At the *si* hour: thirty-six repetitions.

Before practicing this method, first perform three hundred and sixty rounds of guiding and stretching exercises to the left and right.

There are four categories of illness: cold, *zheng* (症), wind, and heat.
For any of these conditions, calm the mind and apply this method—there will be no failure to recover.

All diseases stem from the five viscera; one must recognize their correspondences and understand them well.

**Heart Viscus Diseases:**
The body experiences alternating cold and heat.
In physiognomy, the heart corresponds to the color red. Those afflicted may dream of people in red garments wielding red blades or brandishing fire to frighten them.
Treatment method: Use the *hu* and *chui* breaths. The *hu* breath pertains to the heart and treats cold, while the *chui* breath treats heat.

**Lung Viscus Diseases:**
The body feels fullness and distension in the chest and back, with restlessness in the limbs.
In physiognomy, the lung corresponds to the color white. The afflicted often dream of beautiful women or men deceitfully clinging to them, or of embracing parents, siblings, or spouses.
Treatment method: Exhale with the *xu* breath.

**Liver Viscus Diseases:**
The afflicted experience sorrow, worry, and displeasure, with grief and aversion, as well as headaches and eye pain.
In physiognomy, the liver corresponds to the color green-blue. They may dream of people in green-blue garments holding green-blue staffs, or of lions, tigers, or wolves terrifying them.
Treatment method: Exhale with the *he* breath.

**Spleen Viscus Diseases:**
The body is affected by wandering wind, causing tingling, pain, and oppression.
In physiognomy, the spleen corresponds to the color yellow, akin to earth. They may dream of children striking or seizing them, or of whirling gusts of wind.
Treatment method: Exhale with the *xi* breath.

**Kidney Viscus Diseases:**
The body is cold, and the *yin* is depleted.
In physiognomy, the kidney corresponds to the color black. They may dream of people in black garments wielding black staffs to frighten them.
Treatment method: Exhale with the *ye* breath.

In all cases, perform thirty repetitions of the great *hu* breath and ten repetitions of the subtle *hu* breath.

**Breathing Methods:**
Inhale qi through the nose and exhale through the mouth, ensuring the sound follows the breath as you vocalize the exhalation. For the *hu* method, exhale while voicing the sound *hu*.

For heat diseases: perform fifty repetitions of the great *chui* breath and ten repetitions of the subtle *chui* breath. In the method of exhaling upon objects, the breath’s sound should resemble the character’s pronunciation.

For heart oppression: perform thirty repetitions of the great *xu* breath and ten repetitions of the subtle *xu* breath.

For liver diseases: perform thirty repetitions of the great *he* breath and ten repetitions of the subtle *he* breath.

For heart diseases: perform thirty repetitions of the great *xi* breath and ten repetitions of the subtle *xi* breath.

For cold conditions: perform fifty repetitions of the great *ye* breath and thirty repetitions of the subtle *ye* breath.

These twelve methods of regulating qi, when followed with reverence and care by those afflicted, will yield recovery without fail. Additionally, perform three hundred and sixty repetitions of left-right guiding and pulling exercises.

**Chapter Six: Methods of Dwelling**
When residing in a dwelling, ensure the room is tightly sealed to prevent even the slightest draft, lest wind qi enter unnoticed over time and cause wind-stroke. Many cases of sudden hemiplegia, arched-back rigidity, or loss of speech stem from neglecting such precautions. Once wind invades the body, myriad diseases converge, and malevolent spirits seize the opportunity, leading to sudden death in nine out of ten cases. Thus, utmost care must be taken to seal all gaps.

When at home or traveling and encountering fierce winds, violent storms, or dense fog—all signs of dragons, ghosts, or spirits passing—retreat indoors, close the doors, burn incense, and sit in stillness to avoid harm. Wait until the disturbance passes before venturing out; even if no immediate harm occurs, adverse effects may follow later.

Avoid frequent bathing. When bathing, do so in a sealed room, neither too hot nor too cold, as extremes breed illness. In winter, ensure no sweating occurs during bathing, and avoid exposure to wind or cold afterward. Do not bathe while hungry, nor wash your hair while full. After bathing, consume a small amount of food or drink before leaving.

If you sense a draft in the room, do not endure it or sit facing it; rise and move away. Instruct all household members, young and old, to report discomfort immediately. Do not suppress minor ailments, assuming them harmless, lest they worsen into incurable diseases. At the first sign of unease, apply massage and pressing to unblock the joints and expel pathogenic influences.

Regardless of occupation, have someone tread along your spine, limbs, and head daily. If done thoroughly, this prevents wind qi from afflicting you—a vital yet indescribable secret.

When at home or traveling, always carry a bundle of prepared mugwort, along with emergency pills, ghost-repelling pills, flesh-regenerating medicine, sweet moistening remedies, clove-swelling ointment, mercury, rhubarb, mirabilite, licorice, dried ginger, cinnamon bark, and Sichuan pepper. No other medicines are necessary, but these must never be lacking. Also carry one or two volumes of *The Hundred-and-One Emergency Remedies for Travel* and antidotes for snakebite, bee stings, and gu poison.

If you remain healthy for ten days or more, moxibust three to five acupoints to dispel wind qi. Do not assume robust health is permanent; always remain vigilant against potential dangers. When applying moxibustion, avoid the *ren shen* (spirit’s path).

For those engaged in manual labor, administer a purgative decoction each spring and autumn to prevent seasonal epidemics.

The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: "When wind injures a person, it may cause heat-stroke, cold-stroke, severe wind, hemiplegia, or tetanic wind. Wind that strikes in spring on *jia-yi* days becomes liver wind; in summer on *bing-ding* days, heart wind; during the four seasons on *wu-ji* days, spleen wind; in autumn on *geng-xin* days, lung wind; and in winter on *ren-gui* days, kidney wind. When wind qi invades the transport points of the five viscera and six bowels, it becomes visceral wind, entering through their respective gateways to cause hemiplegia. If wind qi ascends along the wind mansion, it becomes brain wind; if it enters the head, it becomes eye wind with cold sensations. Wind contracted after drinking alcohol becomes *shang feng* (injurious wind); wind contracted after sexual activity with sweating becomes *nei feng* (internal wind). Wind contracted after washing the hair becomes *shou feng* (head wind). Prolonged wind entering after sexual activity causes *shang feng qiang xie* (injurious wind with urgent diarrhea). Water retained in the intestines causes *xie feng* (diarrheal wind). Thus, wind is the chief of the hundred diseases. Though its transformations into other illnesses are unpredictable, its presence as wind qi remains constant."

**The Three Months of Spring:**
These are the months of thawing, when heaven and earth together generate life, and all things flourish. Rise early and walk briskly in the courtyard, loosen your hair and relax your body to foster the growth of vitality. Nurture life without killing, give without seizing, reward without punishing—this aligns with spring’s qi and the Dao of nurturing life. To act contrary harms the liver, leading to cold transformations and diminished vitality in summer.

**The Three Months of Summer:**
These are the months of flourishing growth, when heaven and earth’s qi intermingle, and all things bear fruit. Retire late and rise with the sun, avoiding aversion to its light. Keep the mind free from anger, allowing blossoms to mature and qi to flow outward—this aligns with summer’s qi and the Dao of nurturing growth. To act contrary harms the heart, leading to autumnal malaria and diminished vitality in winter, with severe illness recurring in winter.

**The Three Months of Autumn:**
These are the months of balanced clarity, when heaven’s qi grows urgent and earth’s qi becomes luminous. Rise early and retire with the roosters, calming the mind to ease the body’s autumnal tension. Gather and refine the spirit and qi to harmonize autumn’s qi. Do not direct the mind outward, ensuring the lung qi remains pure—this aligns with autumn’s qi and the Dao of nurturing harvest.

To act contrary harms the lungs, leading to dawn diarrhea and diminished vitality in winter.

**The Three Months of Winter:**
These are the months when yin qi seals and conceals, when water freezes and earth cracks. Do not impair the radiance of yang. Rise late and retire early, awaiting the sunlight. Let the mind remain as if hidden, as if harboring private thoughts, as if having attained something. Shun cold and seek warmth, avoiding the exposure of skin to prevent qi from being exhausted—this aligns with winter’s qi and the Dao of nurturing life.

To act contrary harms the kidneys, leading to springtime wilting and reversal, with diminished vitality for growth.

Heaven has the four seasons and five phases, giving rise to cold, heat, dryness, and dampness. Humans have the five viscera, giving rise to joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and fear. Thus, joy and anger injure qi, while cold and heat harm the form. It is said: when joy and anger are unregulated and cold and heat exceed their bounds, life is no longer secure. Extreme yin must give rise to yang, and extreme yang must give rise to yin. Thus, injury from cold in winter leads to warm diseases in spring; injury from wind in spring leads to dawn diarrhea in summer; injury from summerheat in summer leads to autumnal malaria; injury from dampness in autumn leads to coughing in winter. By adhering to these principles of seasonal nurturing, one may avoid premature decline.
