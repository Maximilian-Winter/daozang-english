*The Supreme Register of the Celestial Sovereign’s Verification of the True Jade Record of the People*

The Youthful Lord inquired of the Most High Dao Lord: "In cultivating the mind to enter the Dao, methods and techniques abound, each claiming subtlety and wonder, yet only those with karmic affinity may attain them. I wonder, what is the most essential among them, and which method is supreme?"

The Most High replied: "Though supreme principles are many, there is indeed one that is most paramount. The essential of cultivating the mind lies in *can-kui* (shame and remorse). In every movement of the mind, every glance of the eye, every turn of the body, and every posture of the self, if one constantly harbors *can-kui*, never forgetting it for even a moment, the spirit-mind will become settled. When settled, one enters the Dao—this is the most essential."

The Youthful Lord asked: "What is the nature of *can-kui* that allows one to enter the Dao?"

The Most High said: "The mind possesses spirit-awareness, and this awareness recognizes the Dao as venerable. Veneration arises from non-action, yet I act; action entails entanglements, while the aspiration for non-action is free from burdens. Yet one cannot immediately attain this—striving is arduous and progress slow, and as burdens gradually accumulate, one feels *can-kui*, which never departs from the mind.

One should also reflect: I received life from my parents, who raised me with toil and hardship. Yet as I grew, my learning and skills remained shallow, lacking extraordinary methods or wondrous arts to extend my parents’ lives, grant them immortality, and share in the attainment of transcendence. This hope remains unfulfilled, my filial offerings deficient. Public and private transgressions weigh upon them, their worries unceasing. My thoughts lack precision, my merit and practice slacken—this is *can-kui*, never departing from the mind.

Moreover, my parents cherished me, hoping I would excel. They sent me to study under masters, that my wisdom might commune with the divine, and I might become a seed of the Dao, a candidate for sagehood. My teachers and friends exhorted and guided me, refining and shaping me with skillful means. Yet I indulged my desires, defied their teachings, abandoned my progress when near completion, turned from the true to the perverse, assailed my teachers and friends, betrayed the Dao, and defiled the scriptures. My sins extended to my superiors, my calamities consumed me, and disaster loomed—yet I did not reform. Or perhaps I failed to awaken, mistaking the false for the true, and only when suffering arrived did I repent—yet repentance came too late. This is *can-kui*, never departing from the center of the mind.

Furthermore, the sovereign, in recognition of virtue, seeks out the worthy and the excellent, elevating those of noble lineage and selecting the finest among them, bestowing rank and emolument, gathering them in intimate assemblies. Yet one may fail to exhaust all methods in loyal service, to propagate sagely transformation, instead coveting glory and power, flattering and feigning compliance, advancing through sycophancy, suppressing the eminent, envying and harming those superior to oneself, forming factions and nurturing enmities. Disaster and misfortune strike, yet one remains unaware; even when aware, one cannot escape, and one’s kin and friends are implicated. This is *can-kui*, never departing from the mind.

Again, though one venerates the Dao without fail, serves parents with filial piety, and serves the ruler with loyalty, never betraying the hidden or the manifest, past-life obstructions and adversities may still entangle one. Public and private slander arises, or one is unexpectedly ensnared in disputes, lawsuits, or imprisonment. Or, though one diligently maintains integrity, standing apart in purity and uprightness, one may be detested by superiors and resented by the wicked. Or, in serving teachers and respecting friends, in all one’s comings and goings, one may encounter misfortune—malevolent spirits and evil persons conspiring to rob and harm, spreading fear and slander. Or, one’s good deeds may turn to evil, one’s generosity breed resentment, one’s utmost courtesy be taken for flattery, one’s sincerity for deceit. One may establish halls and copy scriptures and diagrams, yet though the halls stand, one finds no lasting peace; though the texts multiply, one cannot peruse them. Public and private entanglements arise, wind and fire cause loss, illness and hunger strike, one’s original aspirations unfulfilled. Days pass in vain, one’s pure wishes unrealized. Once the path of life is lost, one drifts toward darkness, suffering and affliction endless, with no foreseeable return. Now, wishing to remedy this, one lacks the essential method—this is *can-kui*, never departing from the mind.

The mind contains spirit, yet if one knows no *can-kui*, the mind races restlessly, never attaining stillness. Stillness arises from *can-kui*; when *can-kui* is established, it remains constantly in the mind. With *can-kui* in the mind, one reflects on the Dao in every movement and repose. If one never forgets the Dao for even a moment, the spirit settles within. When the inner is settled, sins depart; when sins depart, blessings arrive; when blessings arrive, one attains perfection; when perfected, one enters the Dao. Entry into the Dao comes through *can-kui*; *can-kui* leads to communion with the spirit."

The Youthful Lord said: "That *can-kui* resides in the mind, I have reverently heard. May I ask: when *can-kui* is near at hand, what are its manifestations?"

The Most High said: "Excellent, excellent—this is indeed a crucial question! Where there is form, there is mind; where there is mind, there are affairs; where there are affairs, there are traces; where there are traces, there are manifestations; where there are manifestations, there are words; where there are words, there are methods; where there are methods, there is the Dao. The Dao and its methods may thus be expounded.

For the scholar cultivating the mind, *can-kui* resides within, yet its traces manifest externally. Its manifestations are these: cautious as if crossing a river in winter, wary as if fearing one’s neighbors—such is its form.

One is circumspect in speech, fearing carelessness; one moderates diet, guarding against gluttony. One wears coarse yet clean garments, valuing simplicity and purity; one dwells in humble seclusion, upholding tranquility and sincerity. One is reverent toward all, avoiding arrogance and insult; one does not presume to take the lead, to escape envy and slander. One maintains integrity from beginning to end, subtly transforming others; one’s conduct is harmonious and unassuming, one’s practice discreet. One blunts sharpness and resolves conflicts, discerning the proper time for the Dao; one adapts in action and withdrawal, perceiving the conditions for spirit-response. Each has its method—all are manifestations of *can-kui*."

The Youthful Lord said: "Such are its manifestations—I have reverently heard. May I ask about the system of its methods?"

The Most High said: "Its methods are manifold, each with its own scriptural injunctions. To speak briefly, hearing one, one may understand ten."

To stabilize the mind, one must honor the Three Venerables. The Dao is venerable, the scriptures are venerable—both are fully embodied in one’s master. Whether the master’s teachings are manifest or subtle, one follows with reverence, never daring to defy; defiance leads to loss of stability. To maintain stability without fail, one must attend the master with devotion, observing every word and gesture, serving diligently without cease. One does not shrink from toil or shirk hardship, remaining single-minded and unwavering, even unto death. Those who can do this will stabilize the mind and attain life.

If one turns from the master to follow one’s own will, transgresses the Dao, and violates the scriptures—nursing resentment, impatience, doubt, or deceit in both hidden and visible realms—this mind will not stabilize. Fearing death, it loses life, and once gone, it cannot be reclaimed. How grievous this is!

To stabilize the mind, one must part from the master by karmic conditions, yet uphold the Dao and grasp the scriptures, keeping the master ever in mind. If shame and remorse fill the heart—unable to follow the master, whether because the master has ascended to heaven and one cannot attend, or has journeyed to other realms and one cannot accompany, or has passed beyond this life and one cannot fathom, or has suffered exile, hardship, or humiliation in distant lands, or has endured public or private imprisonment, or lies ill in mountains or waters, cut off from human company, or has perished in one of the Five Calamities, or been harmed by venomous creatures, fierce beasts, or forest perils, or fallen victim to bandits or been ensnared by wicked companions, unable to save them—one must feel shame and remorse. With remorse in the heart, sorrow burns near; one dares not indulge in pleasure, nor seek ease, nor sing or laugh, nor pursue glory. One should keep the chamber pure and secluded, barring all but the initiated, burning incense and lighting lamps, bowing in morning and evening rites, reciting and chanting the master’s scriptures, reflecting on and practicing the master’s teachings. Solemn and trembling, one eats sparingly, wears coarse cloth, and at every movement confesses faults, repents, and invokes the spirit. One performs good deeds to seek blessings, cultivates virtue and merit, liberates all beings, and instructs the ignorant—unceasingly, with reverent care.

One dares not speak words not taught by the master, wear garments not given by the master, harbor thoughts not aligned with the master’s will, or dwell in places not approved by the master. Those who can do this have mastered the method of shame and remorse.

To stabilize the mind, one must receive the *Register of the Celestial Citizenry for Stabilizing Perfection and Jade Record*. This register is of utmost importance, the first step in learning. Only by stabilizing the mind can one’s immortal name be fixed. The fixing of the immortal name depends on this register. It is worn by the Orthodox Unity Masters of the Three Heavens to determine the names of those who attain immortality. Copies are transmitted to the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Queen Mother of the West, the Lady of the Upper Prime, the Perfected of Pure Numinosity, and the True Immortals of the Five Peaks. After a thousand years of holding it, one may transmit it to three others. If one has a name inscribed in gold and jade and petitions the Azure Palace, one may transmit it thrice within a hundred years. The covenant requires one gold figurine, one jade dragon, and thirty-two feet of azure cloth, sworn before the Northern Emperor. Both master and disciple observe a nine-day fast, facing north to pledge the transmission of the register.

Without receiving this register, one’s immortal name remains unfixed. Though one may study all scriptures, merits will not be fulfilled, and one will be tested by demons, unable to attain immortality. All who attain immortality first receive this register. It is kept in a blue silk pouch and worn beneath the arm—left for men, right for women—always on the body, removed only for bathing. Never untie it otherwise. If it becomes worn, repair it with a formal announcement. If lost, one must perform expiatory fasts for three years and thirty-six months, fulfilling the daily requirements before it may be reissued and worn again. If lost three times, one may not receive it again, but must redouble shame and remorse, hoping for karmic connection in a future life.

The *Register for Stabilizing Perfection and Jade Record* is the script of spontaneity, emerging from the beginningless and ending in the endless. Once in a great kalpa, it is renewed, revealing the truth of attaining the Dao. Through accumulating merit and virtue, one must wear this text. When one’s name enters it, one receives its qi and becomes truly real—indestructible. Before the great kalpa completes, during lesser kalpas, those whose merit and virtue wane will see both name and person regress, losing this text and failing to encounter immortality. Those whose merit and virtue advance retain the text without loss, preserving their status as seed-people, neither regressing nor diminishing. Differences in merit, virtue, and wisdom determine rank. Beyond the 240,000, there are 120,000 more, totaling 360,000—those perfected in one kalpa. Those with meager merit and virtue fall outside this number and must await the next kalpa. Only those in this kalpa who are diligent and courageous may enter the limit of 360,000.

Another name for it is the *Azure Record on White Tablets of the Celestial Citizenry’s Register*. The tablets are of white metal, the characters of azure jade.
