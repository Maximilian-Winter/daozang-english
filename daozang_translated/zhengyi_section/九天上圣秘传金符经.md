**The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Secret Transmission of the Golden Talismans Scripture**

**Scripture Title:** *The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Secret Transmission of the Golden Talismans Scripture*
**Author:** Unknown
**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, First Section (Zhengtong Daozang, Zhengyi Bu)

The *Golden Scripture* states: The heavens possess nine stars, which desire to aid the world, and are applied through the five musical tones and human reckoning. For all who would make use of them, first consult the almanac to examine the days and celestial stems, then follow the four seasons and the sixty *jiazi* cycles, selecting the appropriate day for application. Yet when observing whether the celestial stars bring fortune or misfortune to mortals, many consult various books, permitting their use if deemed universally applicable—unaware that this often leads to grave errors. Thus do people lose their families and homes, suffer unjust official punishments, lose oxen and horses, see their children die young or meet violent ends, endure theft and banditry, face fires and terrors, or see their fields and gardens scattered. Such calamities arise from transgressing against inauspicious stars. But when encountering auspicious stars, desires are fulfilled without fail, and all prayers receive response—these must not be neglected.

When constructing homes or establishing graves, if one does not follow the auspicious days determined by the Three Origins and Nine Stars, misfortune will swiftly strike: loss of family members, encounters with thieves, legal troubles, depletion of wealth and grain, the sound of turtles crying or cauldrons ringing, birds flying into the house, cats and dogs behaving strangely or causing trouble from nowhere, discord between men and women, disharmony between husband and wife, self-inflicted injuries or drowning, limbs afflicted with illness, loss of eyesight or missing teeth, pregnant women suffering miscarriages, the young disobeying their elders, and all manner of inauspicious events. But if one acts in accordance with auspicious stars, officials will see their ranks promoted, all affairs will proceed smoothly, households will flourish, young and old will rejoice, sons and daughters will be clever, servants will be obedient, livestock will thrive, and all wishes will be fulfilled.

The *Golden Scripture* states: When establishing prefectures, counties, markets, temples, shrines, government residences, manors, storehouses, or shops, one must examine the year, month, day, and hour! Only when auspicious stars are present should action be taken. The sixty *jiazi* days and their corresponding auspicious and inauspicious stars are arranged and listed below.

Should this star configuration manifest, it is termed the *Xuanwu Talisman Entering the Household*. If one undertakes construction, marriage, relocation, ancestral rites, or any major or minor activity—such as moving into a residence or opening a shop—within a year, misfortune will befall the household: official calamities, theft, imprisonment, or legal punishment. The master of the house may drown, and after four hundred days, the master will suffer from abdominal pain and die, while fields and properties dissipate. As this baleful star brings harm, the family will decline, inevitably leading to mourning and the loss of the eldest son—an omen of great misfortune. On that very day, one may encounter drowning incidents involving wood or verbal disputes arising from the east or south.

Should the *Eclipse Star* manifest thus, it is termed the *Zhuque Entering the Household*. It portends fire and theft, a sign of great misfortune. Within a year, one may suffer deception, fraud, or betrayal. For matters such as marriage, relocation, official appointments, opening a storehouse or shop, or construction, within a year, the family will decline, livestock will perish, and offspring will be unfilial. Women may engage in licentiousness, and affairs will collapse. The primary female of the household will suffer from dysentery within sixty days, leading to mourning—an omen of great misfortune. If disputes or misfortune befall women or children on that day, further calamities will follow. This day is only auspicious for tomb construction; for all other purposes, it must not be used.

*Harvest Blade*"

If this star manifests thus, it is termed the *White Tiger Entering the Household*. Within a year, it will harm those of unclear fate—an omen of great misfortune. For matters such as official appointments, assuming office, construction, roofing, marriage, relocation, burial, or opening a storehouse or shop, within a year, the master of the house will fall ill and don mourning. It portends tiger attacks, violent deaths, or warfare. As this inauspicious star afflicts the household, all undertakings will meet with disaster. For families that have accumulated hidden virtue, bloodshed will still occur, and servants will surely suffer misfortune.

*Slaughter Tribute*

If this star manifests thus, it is termed the *Azure Dragon Celestial Virtue Talisman Entering the Household*. For all households undertaking construction, marriage, opening a shop, relocation, official appointments, assuming office, or bridge-building, within three years, those with official rank will be promoted to higher positions, while those without will see their fields and estates flourish, attaining wealth and prosperity, and begetting noble sons. After three years, they will amass great wealth in grain, enjoy harmonious relations between father and son, and have rows of obedient servants—all endeavors will be blessed. When auspicious stars shine upon them, no construction, great or small, need be avoided. For Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, all undertakings will be favorable.

*Direct Star*

If this star manifests thus, it is termed the *Golden Coffer Talisman Entering the Household*. When this star is in effect, for all matters such as construction, official appointments, assuming office, marriage, opening a business, or renovating an ancestral tomb, within three years, great fortune will follow. Those with official rank will be promoted, while those without will see all affairs proceed as desired, their livestock thriving and their households well-fed—whether seventy-two in number—attaining wealth and honor. In the same year, they will acquire unexpected wealth. However, if the *Metal Spirit* and *Seven Killings* inauspicious stars coincide, within half a year, on the twenty-first day, misfortune will strike. Within five months, they will suffer loss or legal troubles. For Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, all undertakings will be favorable.

*Divination Wood*

When this star is in effect, it is called the *Black Dao Talisman Entering the Household*. For those under its influence, within a year, there will emerge individuals of ill repute or malevolent persons, bringing frequent punishments and disasters. Should one undertake construction, marriage, burial, relocation, opening a warehouse or shop, or if monks and Daoists enter a monastery or make additions to its structures, within two years, there will be great disturbances—mourning, wailing, water or fire disasters, official misfortunes, conflicts among descendants, discord among brothers, theft, terror, depletion of resources, failure of livestock to thrive, and decline in all affairs. For seven years, great misfortune will prevail. If the head of the household possesses virtue and power, though misfortune in family and wealth may still arise, one may yet seek refuge with the worthy and sagely, praying for their protective aid.

*Jiǎ-Yǐ*
This star is called *Great Yin Entering the Household*. When this star is in effect, it is inauspicious. For all matters such as marriage, relocation, assuming office, altering the household gate, or burial, within three years, there will be illnesses of abdominal pain, afflictions from canes or snake bites, theft, water or fire disasters, and the dispersal of property. If the head of the household has virtue and power to support them, only verbal disputes will arise, though death will still be accompanied by inauspicious stars and ill omens.

*Rén-Zhuān*
This star is called the *Six Yin Metal Hall Talisman Entering the Household*. When this star is in effect, within a year, a noble son will be born. For all undertakings such as construction, marriage, burial, opening a business, relocation, assuming office, moving into a new residence, altering the gate, or adding to the house, within three years, those with official rank will see their salaries and positions multiply, while those without will find all their affairs auspicious, greatly prospering in wealth. They will gain assistance from outsiders, and good deeds will converge. For Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, all undertakings will be favorable.

**Lì-Zǎo**
This star is called the *Gouchen Talisman Entering the Household*. When this star is in effect, for all undertakings such as construction, marriage, burial, opening a business, assuming office, taking up a post, or renovation, petitions and memorials will be inauspicious. Within a year, the household will scatter, and all affairs will be unfavorable, leading to the ruin of the family estate. For tasks such as felling trees, stacking lumber, raising beams, or setting sail, the master craftsman will encounter disasters of blade and bloodshed. If aided by a yin person, there will be quarrels and disturbances, and all matters will be unfavorable.

The *Golden Talisman Scripture* contains the secrets of the sages, differing from other texts. It is also called the *Scripture of Salvation from Suffering* or the *Scripture of Household Treasures*. These sacred and extraordinary texts must not be transmitted to the foolish.

**Zhuge Master’s Perpetual Travel Chart**
Long ago, Master Zhuge of South Yang’s Outer Dragon selected a *Perpetual Travel Chart* and transmitted it to later generations. When building irrigation channels, releasing water, erecting pillars, raising beams, welcoming a bride, receiving betrothal gifts, installing steps, mills, or renovating, or when burying the dead, one should choose auspicious days to avoid misfortune. If an inauspicious time is encountered, even a single auspicious sign will be ineffective, and no action should be taken—only avoidance. When an auspicious time is selected, even if one does not avoid the one hundred and twenty steps of malevolent forces, its use will still be greatly auspicious.

Now, three cycles—upper, middle, and lower—are established, revolving endlessly. By determining the example month and dividing the days for selection, the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of its use will be self-evident.

**Annual Nine Good Stems for Determining Directions**
The inauspicious stars in the heavens are called the *Nine Good*. In the *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* years, they occupy monastic halls. Additionally, city gods and earth temples—renovating them will lead to great failure and multiple deaths.

In the *yin* and *shen* years, they occupy gates, wells, bridges, and roads. In the *zi* and *wu* years, they return to kitchens and the direction of the *ao* (turtle). In the *mao* and *you* years, they return to Daoist temples—renovating them will immediately bring disasters. In the *si* and *hai* years, they converge in one place—those traveling by boat must never renovate or decorate. If one does not believe in these divine malevolent forces, ten households will see nine perish.
