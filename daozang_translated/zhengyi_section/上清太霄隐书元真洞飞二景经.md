The *Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Concealed Writ of the Great Empyrean, the Cavern of Original Perfection, and the Flight of the Two Radiant Ones* expounds the Dao of the Six Assemblies’ Transference and Ascension. One must cultivate the Five Dawns to depart from the Gate of Death and ascend to the Palace of Life, thereby attaining the method of flying immortality.

On the days of *renshen*, *bingshen*, *wushen*, *jiashen*, and *gengshen*—the Five Departures—at this time, the August Emperor ever rides the radiant dragon-chariot with its green auroral canopy, accompanied by immortal officials and jade maidens, circling the Ten Heavens before descending to the mortal realm. He inspects those who study the Dao of immortality, commanding the Lord of the Northern Thearch and the Five *Qi* Numinous Sovereign of Grand Yin to present the Register of Deaths and ascend to the Abacus Palace of Pingdu, where the ledgers of life and death are examined and tallied.

The True August Sovereigns of the Five Directions and Five Stars, each governing one realm and presiding over all immortals who attain the Dao, are collectively named the Eastern Florescence. For those burdened by yin transgressions, yin faults, yang transgressions, or yang faults bound to the Northern Thearch, the Grand Yin Sovereign, named the Palace of Fengdu, distinguishes between the good and evil, the living and the dead.

Thus, on the days of the Five Departures, one first repents before Grand Yin, cultivates life through Grand Yang, erases the death register from the Northern Thearch, and seeks immortality from the Five Stars. On each of these days, don immaculate robes, burn incense, enter the chamber, repent of transgressions, contemplate goodness, concentrate the spirit within, and focus the mind upon the Mystery, free from extraneous thoughts. The August Sovereign patrols the Five Realms, and the divine officials record your merits, submitting them to the Jade August Emperor. After five years of such practice, the True August Sovereigns of the Five Stars will descend into your chamber.

On these days, at the three hours of dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, face north, bow twice, and knock the teeth thrice. Visualize and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Jade August Emperor, I beseech you to absolve the yin evils and unrighteous deeds committed by my seven ancestors and myself—killing, licentiousness, harm, and lawlessness—countless yang transgressions and yin faults, all recorded by the Northern Thearch. I beg for their erasure, the severing of death’s roots, and my passage through the Celestial Gate, to be inscribed in the Eastern Florescence upon the Jade Register. May my seven ancestors and parents be reborn as Southern Immortals."*

Conclude, then visualize the essence of the True August Sovereign of the Northern Star, the Perfected Sovereign of the Northern Culmen, clad in a purple brocade flying skirt, a tiger tally at his waist, and a floral crown upon his head. He rides a jade chariot of brocade auroras and flying clouds, attended by twelve immortal officials, descending from the north to overshadow your body. His radiance is lush and resplendent, his brilliance dazzling. Look upward and recite:

*"Northern True August Sovereign, who governs all flying immortals, riding clouds in a returning chariot, descend to crown my body. I beseech you to seal the Ghost Gate, sever death’s roots, and inscribe my name in Jade Clarity. Release me from the Celestial Gate, that I may ascend to the Southern Terrace, my lifespan bound to the True August Sovereign, eternally safeguarded by the Northern Culmen."*

Then swallow the *qi* five times and cease.

Face east, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and visualize the incantation:

*"August Sovereign of the Jade Dawn, Supreme Ultimate Sovereign of the Original Radiance, I beseech you to absolve the yin transgressions and yang faults I have committed since my first year, extending to the heavy debts of my seven ancestors bound in the Three Yins. I beg for their release, the dissolution of my sins, the sealing of death’s roots, the Northern Thearch’s removal of my karmic bonds, and the Eastern Florescence’s inscription of my name in the Jade Register. May my seven ancestors and parents ascend together to the August Dawn."*

Conclude, then visualize the Central True August Sovereign of the Eastern Star, Azure Tooth, clad in a cloud-brocade dragon mantle, a phoenix tally at his waist, and a floral crown upon his head. He rides a jade chariot of azure auroras and flying clouds, attended by twelve immortal officials, descending from the east to overshadow your body. His radiance is luxuriant, illuminating the eastern quarter. Look upward and recite:

*"Central True Sovereign of the East, whose flowing auroras fill the Nine Gates, whose light shines beyond the realms, descend to crown my body. I beseech you to petition the Northern Thearch to sever my death’s roots, inscribe my jade name, and admit me as an Inner Perfected of the Eastern Florescence. May I ascend and forever depart the path of death. May my seven ancestors and parents all enjoy blessings, growing with the moon and setting with the sun, riding the void to tread the flying steps."*

Then swallow the *qi* nine times and cease.

Face south, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and visualize the incantation:

*"Three Primordial August Sovereigns of Supreme Clarity, August Sovereign of the Southern Culmen of the Supreme Ultimate, and Jade Worthy Sovereign of the Nine *Qi* of Grand Yang, I beseech you to absolve the primordial evils and impieties I have committed since gaining awareness—disobedience, unrighteousness, lewdness, theft, yin transgressions, and yang faults—extending to the karmic bonds of my seven ancestors, all recorded on the White Slips and inscribed in Grand Yin, their names bound to the Northern Culmen. I beg for their release, the dissolution of the Three Officials’ karmic bonds, the severing of death’s *qi*, passage through the northeastern gate, and ascent through the southwestern celestial barrier. May my seven ancestors and parents all receive the Emperor’s grace."*

Conclude, then visualize the True August Sovereign of the Southern Star, Blazing Deluder, Weichun, clad in a frost-white phoenix-hua dragon-bell skirt, a tiger-script tally at his waist, and a flying azure crown upon his head. He rides a crimson chariot of vermilion auroras, attended by twelve immortal officials, descending from the south to overshadow your body. His radiance blazes like the rising sun. Look upward and recite:

*"Southern True August Sovereign, whose dark effulgence flows like celestial light, circling the Three Gates, ascending in a cinnabar chariot to the Supreme Ultimate, your inner brilliance illuminating all—descend to crown my body. Sever the Northern Thearch’s sins bound to me, dissolve karmic knots, dispel Grand Yin’s hindrances, free me from the Ghost Gate, and eradicate the roots of karmic bonds. Ascend through the Celestial Gate to enter the Southern Terrace. May my seven ancestors and parents together approach the Emperor’s presence."*

Then swallow the *qi* eight times and cease. Face west, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and visualize the incantation:

The Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity and the Four Elders of the Dao-Middle Lord, I beseech your pardon and absolution for all my conscious transgressions—envy of the worthy and capable, careless disclosure of scriptures, treading in filth and staining with dust, defiling the Three Luminaries, and weeping in oath-bound sorrow—offenses that have risen to touch the August Lords, binding karmic adversaries to the Grand Yin, and fastening my sinful name to the registers of the Ghost Officials. I implore you to unbind and release me, to extinguish the roots of tribulation, to sever the paths of death, and to pass my name through the Gate of Life, that my seven ancestors and parents may ascend together to the Hall of Blessings.

When this is complete, next visualize the True August Lord of the White Star of the West, clad in a luminous brocade skirt adorned with flowing bells, his waist girded with a tiger-patterned sash, his head crowned with the *Fuchen* coronet. He rides a chariot of pale mist, attended by twelve immortals, descending from the west to overshadow your body. His radiance pierces through, blazing resplendent in the western quarter. Then look upward and recite:

*"Western True August Sovereign, your pristine light illumines the dark standard. Mounting your jade chariot, your white splendor soars through the heavens. Turning the dawn, you descend, your true form interwoven with mine. For me, reverse the Nine Gates and pass my body into the imperial court. Remove my name from the Grand Yin’s records and ascend with me to the Mysterious Palace, where we shall share in jade-like radiance. May my years span heaven and earth, enduring for eons without decay. May my seven ancestors and parents together ascend to the dawn-lit heavens."*

When this is complete, swallow the *qi* six times and cease. Then face the center, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and visualize the incantation:

Supreme August Jade Thearch, I beseech your pardon for all my transgressions from birth to this day—innumerable faults and myriad sins, a thousand debts and ten thousand errors. My seven ancestors’ karmic adversaries remain unresolved, their affairs bound to the Grand Yin. I implore you to dissolve and absolve all, to sever the dark name of the Northern Thearch, to cut the roots of deathly *qi* from the Ghost Gate of *Gui* earth, and to pass my name through the Celestial Gate. May I traverse the Five Dawns, and may my seven ancestors and parents all be reborn as immortals.

Next visualize the True August Lord of the Central Star, *Dan Yan*, clad in a yellow cloud-dragon brocade skirt with a tiger-patterned sash, his waist bearing a golden talisman, his head crowned with a purple coronet. He rides a chariot of yellow mist, attended by twelve immortals, descending from the center to crown and overshadow your body. His radiance pierces through, blazing resplendent in the Central Primordial. Then look upward and recite:

*"Central True August Sovereign, who governs the Five Thearchs and turns the dark net of the cosmos. Mounting your yellow mist chariot, you traverse the four directions. For me, sever the roots of death and pass my name into the Southern Yang Palace. May I depart the five and return to the six, soaring with you in transformation across ten thousand streams, enjoying boundless longevity. Ascend with me to the Supreme Ultimate, to the Golden Gates and Jade Halls. May my seven ancestors and parents together bear the blessings of prosperity."*

When this is complete, swallow the *qi* twelve times and cease.

Thus, the five transgressions are severed before the Five Thearchs, and the Five Dawns are visualized to deliver life. The ritual concludes here.

If practiced without fail on its appointed days, after seven years, the five true stars of the Five Dawns will be moved to manifest in your bedchamber.

The Great Thearch will personally dispatch five jade maidens from the five directions to guard your body. The Northern Thearch and the Grand Yin will also come to your gate, yet dare not seize your sins.

Those who seek immortality and pursue the true Dao should diligently practice this. The *Way of Repentance for Life-Seeking* is the method taught by the High Minister Green Lad Lord, as requested of the Golden Gates Thearch, established as a model for later learners in their quest for life—this is not the repentance of the Great Thearch himself.

Should you perform this ritual, the Thearch will witness your sincerity. Even if your past transgressions are not fully exhausted, the officials of the Six Heavens will not inscribe your name in the registers of death, nor will the bureaus of the Celestial Gates pass your body. Thus, there are the Departure-Convergence Bureau and the Celestial Gates: the Celestial Gates are the palace for delivering life, while the Departure-Convergence Bureau is the source of filling death.

Only through earnest seeking may one attain the true essence.

The scholar of life-preservation who knows not that heaven has the Celestial Gates and earth has Fengdu—where the Celestial Gates govern spirits and Fengdu rules ghosts—fails to recognize these two Thearchs who preside over life and death, their mechanisms bound to the pivot of the Seven Stars. Thus, when the Seven Stars shift, life is delivered.

The Northern Thearch bears no name in the Six Palaces, while the Celestial Gates keep records of immortals. The dark statutes shade with canopies of blossoms, and the Seven Primordials bestow the *huoluo* ranks. The path to immortality lies near at hand.

The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen declared: "Those who possess resolve are all illumined in heart by the Seven Stars and the Nine August Sovereigns. Through earnest seeking and ardent devotion, after seven years of cultivation, one may ascend to the dawn in broad daylight."

If one merely upholds this scripture without visualization or contemplation, merely burning incense to the left and right, the essence of the Seven Stars will still constantly illumine one’s chamber, and the officials of Fengdu will not dare approach one’s body.

*The Scripture of the Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean and the Flying Two Luminaries of the Original True Cavern of Supreme Purity* concludes.
