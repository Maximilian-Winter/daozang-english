**The Supreme Clarity Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods Scripture**

The Most High Great Dao Lord, Mysterious Numinous and Transcendent, governs the transformations above, harmonizing the thousand Perfected, paying homage to the ten directions. Thereupon, he summoned the Eight Emperors, concealed his march in the morning waves, beheaded the Six Heavens, and rightly established the Three Ways. His awe-inspiring might shook the heavens, his radiance streaming across ten thousand peaks.

Thus, he commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the Four Directors of the High Ministers, who served the Jade Dawn, to reveal the lofty chapters of the Vermilion Plain and eradicate the teachings of the Cold Numinous. Thereupon, they opened the Supreme Way of the Eight Assemblies, systematizing the essential principles of divine transcendents. In all, forty-four methods were compiled into a single work, collectively titled *The Yellow Plain Scripture*. It was sealed in a casket of cinnabar blossoms, encased in a brocade pouch of mysterious numen, and entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, concealed within the Chamber of the Seven Radiant Gems.

Furthermore, he commanded thirty-seven Jade Maidens of the Northern Cold to constantly guard the bodies of those who possessed this scripture. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, within seven hundred years, it was to be transmitted to only three individuals.

*The Supreme Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods* are all celestial writings from above the Nine Heavens, hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies. Therefore, the Most High Dao Lord commanded the High Transcendents of Supreme Clarity and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to systematize and arrange their contents, compiling them into forty-four divine methods of the *Yellow Plain*. These were established collectively after the rectification of the Six Heavens. These chapters all derive from the commands of the Most High Sages and were inscribed by the brush of the High Ministers. Thus, the Dao is perfected in the Great Perfected, surpassing all other works in subtlety. They are called the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*, which overawes the malevolent *qi* of the Six Heavens and eradicates the inauspiciousness of a thousand demons.

Those with predestined affinity who are fated to behold this text are surely opened by the mysterious and transcendent, and must possess the destined portion of divine transcendents. This divine scripture is not transmitted in the worldly realm. Whoever divulges it will be punished by the Three Heavens for treachery, reported to the Imperial Lord, and their transgression of disclosure will be accounted a breach of covenant. Within three years, the Most High will dispatch the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors to punish their person. They will die as lowly ghosts, and their seven generations of ancestors will together be examined by the Water Officials.

All who receive *The Supreme Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods Scripture*—both master and disciple—must observe a retreat of forty-five days, abstaining from worldly affairs. They must first invoke the divine luminaries and, only after careful consideration, transmit it under covenant. The covenant employs a jade tablet, one foot and five *fen* in length, one *cun* and four *fen* in width, to invoke the covenant of the Perfected of the Four Poles. Additionally, forty feet of yellow plain silk and two pairs of golden rings are used in place of the blood-oath of solemn proclamation. If, after receiving the scripture, one violates the covenant, transmits it to the unworthy, the punishment is as recorded above, and they will be penalized by divine soldiers. Be cautious!

The Most High Dao Lord commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the High Ministers in attendance to compile *The Yellow Plain Divine Scripture: Forty-Four Methods* as follows:

---

All who read *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, who can comprehend its subtle sounds, discourse without hindrance on the profound, exhaustively investigate its mysteries, expound and praise its numinous chapters, whose resonant voices shake the heavens, whose subtle principles penetrate all, and who recite it in secluded chambers with crystalline clarity and no obstruction—such persons possess the talent of High Transcendents. Only those who read this scripture can ascend to the presence of the Most High, summon the Nine Perfected, share rank with High Transcendents, and hold office as Directors of Destinies. According to *The Supreme Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods*, they may be called *Dadong* (Great Cavern) Dharma Masters.

The *Dadong* Dharma Masters are truly without peer, overseeing the void and presiding over the mysterious, communicating with spirits and connecting with the subtle. Their radiance gives life to the myriad Perfected, and their rank corresponds to the High Transcendents of the Great Ultimate. This is called "refined study and mysterious resonance," not limited to ten thousand recitations. Even if one merely possesses this scripture without studying or reciting it, they may still serve as a Master of the Most High and a Teacher-Lord of ghosts and spirits.

---

All who read *The Great Vermilion Hidden Book of the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber* and *The Feminine One’s Treasured Chapters*, who can savor the mysterious and true, grasp the principles of the Cavern Scriptures, awaken to the obscure and profound, wander freely in the void, encounter all without obstruction, aspire to the Perfected with sincerity, and silently vow in secluded chambers to communicate with the numinous—such persons may, through their refined resonance with the Great Plain, ascend and descend with the Nine Perfected, harmonize the Five Spirits, and have their names recorded by the Directors of Destinies. According to *The Supreme Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods*, they may be called *Sandong* (Three Caverns) Dharma Masters and Perfected of the Primordial Radiance.

The Perfected of the Primordial Radiance hold rank corresponding to the High Transcendents of the Imperial Unity. The High Transcendents of the Imperial Unity oversee the void above the void and are the supreme Perfected among all spirits. Even if one merely possesses this scripture without being able to study and resonate with it, they may still serve as a Master of the Three Origins and hold the office of a terrestrial transcendent.

---

All who read *The Great Vermilion Hidden Book of the Cavern Perfected Mysterious Scripture* and the affairs of the Imperial Unity’s dissolution of knots and nurturing of the hundred spirits, who can refine their study to achieve mysterious resonance, penetrate the profound and reach the numinous, return their essence to the mysterious origin, disperse the seven scriptures, govern the obscure and unblock the stagnant, and savor the radiance of the celestial clarity—such persons are chosen by the mysterious and inscribed in the imperial register, their radiance mapped in the Three Origins. Their essence penetrates the divine luminaries, and they resonate with the Turtle Mountain. According to *The Supreme Highest Yellow Plain Forty-Four Methods*, they may call themselves *Xuandong* (Mysterious Cavern) Dharma Masters and High Radiance Perfected.

The High Radiance Perfected hold rank corresponding to the High Transcendents of the Nine Palaces. Such scriptures enable one to greatly harmonize with the Imperial Unity, encompass the Five Spirits, have the Nine Numinous attend as ministers, and serve as officials of the Three Bureaus. Even if one has not yet cultivated these practices, they may still serve as Masters of the Three Heavens and hold office above the terrestrial administrators.

---

All who can diligently advance in the Three Scriptures, expound and comprehend their marvelous texts, resonate with the lofty and remote, and immerse themselves in the profound and distant—such persons are surely inscribed in jade registers and inscribed with golden and jade names.

Some receive these scriptures at the very outset, granted through karmic bonds with numinous beings, while others encounter them in their entirety and suddenly obtain them. Those who receive these scriptures have all been tested by the Great Ultimate, their sincerity and devotion examined, their ranks and capacities assessed—this having already been declared prior to transmission. It is not necessary to revere an oath-bound master or enter into blood-sealed covenants.

According to the *Supreme Yellow Register of the Forty-Four Directions*, one may then style oneself as a Master of the Numinous Bureau and High Radiance Perfected, bearing the title of the Ninefold Transcendent Grandee. If one’s resonance ascends to evoke response, jade tones echo in secret harmony, myriad cycles complete, and yin and yang merge, one may then ride clouds and mount dragons, ascending in broad daylight to the void, entering the Three Clarities to become a Minister of the Great Ultimate and assume office above the High Transcendents.

All who obtain the Supreme Dragon Scriptures of the Great Perfection Dao, or the Jade Clarity’s Hidden Writings of the Mystic Plumage, and can penetrate the subtle, resolve the obscure, elucidate the marvelous, and by analogy bring forth myriad accomplishments—those who set their aspirations toward the morning clouds and savor the distant purity—such persons are surely inscribed in golden registers and jade tablets, their names recorded in the imperial chambers, their perfected beings steeped in dark radiance, their clarity and emptiness refined and serene. Such talents are all destined to become High Transcendents.

According to the *Supreme Yellow Register of the Forty-Four Directions*, one may then be called a Master of the Three Heavens and Supreme Perfected. The Supreme Perfected hold rank corresponding to the Ministers of the Great Ultimate Transcendents. Even if one merely possesses these scriptures, the Three Bureaus will attend as servants, the Four Luminaries will serve as ministers, all directions will align, and though no trial be declared, one may command spirits and commune with the numinous, assuredly attaining the terrestrial perfected.

All who diligently test their secret devotion, immerse themselves in the profound and true, purify themselves through fasting to the utmost, and yearn for the divine immortals—those who suddenly encounter these Three Grades of Scriptures without a master’s transmission—such persons are surely those whose karmic bonds with the mysterious have long been destined, their names already listed among the Perfected of the Imperial Homeland. Those who receive these scriptures in secret transmission are marked by extraordinary distinction to manifest worldly merit.

According to the *Supreme Yellow Register of the Forty-Four Directions*, one may then undertake the hidden covenant of the numinous oath. On a *jiazi* day, enter a purified chamber in fasting, and at midnight when generative *qi* arises, recline or sit as one wishes. Close the eyes in faint semblance, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and mentally bow to the four directions. When finished, softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Nine Numinous, Three Pristine Primordial Essences,
Divine Lords of the Immortal Capital, Three Clarities of the Four Poles,
Once I received the transforming Dharma and encountered the supreme scriptures,
Yet the mysterious masters are distant and unseen in form.
I beseech the hidden covenant, swearing by the numinous and bright,
With jade lads attending in guard, jade blossoms sustaining life,
Eight vows and nine unions, wondrous wisdom penetrating the numinous,
May I vow for the divine, vow for immortality, and soar through the Jade Clarity."*

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth twenty-four times again, swallow saliva ten times, and mentally bow before the scriptures. Then one may sleep or rise to recite the scriptures, and auspicious responses will surely follow. By practicing this regularly, within three years one may become a Scripture Master and fulfill the office of Perfected Grandee. This is the inner method of the Yellow Register, requiring no further recourse to oath-bound masters or blood-sealed covenants. Even after receiving the scriptures, the Perfected should continue this practice.

When receiving the Three Scripture Methods of the Great Cavern, one should retire to a secluded chamber, avoiding the company of the profane, and make a clean copy to place upon the scripture stand. One should always offer incense in reverence, and set aside a separate bed to the east for the stand. When performing rites or making vows, one should conduct them facing the stand. The scriptures that may be recited should not be placed upon the stand.

All Daoists who receive the Three Grades of Perfected Scriptures and the *Feminine One’s Mystic Plumage of the Hidden Cavern* should diligently yearn for the lofty and remote, resonate with the numinous and bright, purify the heart through fasting, and single-mindedly cultivate the Dao to secure life, unwavering in their devotion, savoring the mysterious clarity of the luminous. Such persons are assured of attaining High Transcendence. According to the *Supreme Yellow Register of the Forty-Four Directions*, one may then perform the Hidden Rites of the Eight Audiences and Three Audiences.

On the days of *jiayin*, *wushen*, *gengshen*, *dingsi*, *jisi*, *guihai*, or *yihai*, enter the chamber at dawn, burn incense to the left and right, close the eyes in faint semblance, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and mentally bow to the four directions. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Supreme Numinous, Three Pristine Primordial Essences,
Reverently on this auspicious day, I present the inner audience to the Perfected Scriptures.
Divine lads and jade maidens scatter incense in the empty courtyard,
That I may become a divine immortal, and heaven and earth incline toward me."*

When the incantation is complete, swiftly close both eyes so that inner and outer darkness merge, with no mutual perception. Knock the teeth thirty times, swallow saliva three times, then open the eyes—the rite is complete. This is called the Hidden Rite of the Eight Audiences and Three Primordials. By practicing this regularly, one may attain numinous penetration and clear vision, resonate with the Three Primordials, unite with the marvelous and responsive, ascend and descend the Great Mystery, have jade maidens attend the scriptures, present one’s prayers for life, and become an immortal undying, with heaven and earth inclining toward one. Those who have not yet received the scriptures but practice this for three years may become Scripture Masters, blessed with numinous portents and auspicious signs.

When cultivating and receiving the *Great Cavern Perfected Scriptures* and the *Feminine One’s Mystic Writings*, one should always sleep in a separate chamber, avoiding contact with others, and place the scriptures in a clean and purified stand. Morning and evening, burn incense, bow in reverence, and present vows to the world, thereby erasing the records of transgressions.

On the third, seventh, and twenty-first days of the month, the jade maidens attending the scriptures will report one’s transgressions to the Three Primordials, and together with the Supreme Unity Sovereign Lord, they will examine one’s conduct. On these days, enter the chamber, burn incense, knock the teeth twenty-one times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Numinous Directions, Great Cavern Perfected Scriptures,
Once by good fortune I encountered the numinous and bright,
Unfolded the seven charts of protection, received the audience of the Three Clarities.
If there be transgressions to shield, may the Sovereign Lord disperse the numinous,
The Three Images open in clarity, the Supreme Emperor unite in form,
That I may become a flying immortal, my divine perfection enduring forever."*

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth fourteen times, mentally bow to the four directions, then open the eyes—the rite is complete.

Those who regularly practice this will experience the esoteric resonance of the Three Origins, and the Sovereign Lord will pardon their transgressions. Any sins reported against them will be disregarded. Whenever Daoist practitioners engage in the visualization of superior methods or cultivate the affairs of the Supreme Unity, they must avoid encountering corpses, blood, or defilements. Should one inadvertently witness such things, they may perform the esoteric rite of the Three Luminaries’ Concealment to dissolve the impurity.

Take one *zhū* of true cinnabar, scatter it into water, and use it to wash the eyes, rinse the mouth, and cleanse the hands and feet. Then, enter the chamber and settle into repose. Cross the hands over the heart, knock the teeth fourteen times, and mentally bow to the four directions. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Dao of the Three Origins, Supreme Unity guards my form,
The Lord of Life’s Attendants, the Five Spirits of Yellow Tranquility,
Blood-corpses disperse and vanish, inauspicious defilements sink and fade,
Seven fluids coil and infuse, the five viscera flourish anew,
That I may become a divine immortal, ever enjoying fortune and purity."*

When the incantation is complete, swiftly close both eyes and gather the *qi*, uniting inner and outer in darkness so that neither hears nor sees the other. After a while, when a slight warmth is felt within the body, the sign is complete. Then knock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva three times, and the rite is finished. This is the esoteric method of the Three Luminaries’ Concealment for dissolving defilement.

Whenever Daoist practitioners cultivate superior methods and wish to examine, recite, or read scriptures, they must burn incense on both sides when opening the case. Mentally bow before the scripture, knock the teeth three times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Method of the Jade Emperor, ascending to the Three Clarities,
On this auspicious day of fasting and sincerity, I dare to open the divine scripture,
Ten thousand trials concealed, all endeavors shall succeed,
Jade lads attend and guard, jade blossoms scatter fragrance,
I report above to the Three Origins, that I may attain long life."*

When the incantation is complete, open the scripture and only then may one recite and read it. This is called the Great Emperor’s Method for Opening Scriptures. It commands jade maidens and jade lads to attend, burn incense, and summon the descent of numinous spirits, ascending to the Nine Heavens.

Whenever Daoist practitioners receive and study Cavern Scriptures or cultivate the affairs of the Supreme Unity, they must not reveal the name of the Supreme Unity Sovereign Lord to those of differing aspirations. To disclose it is to violate the Dark Mystery’s Yin Punishment. Should one transgress thrice, the Five Spirits will abandon their abode, and one will no longer become an immortal. Beyond three transgressions, one dies as a lowly ghost, with no hope of immortality.

After receiving scriptures, Daoist practitioners should, morning and evening, visualize and recite the name of the Supreme Unity Sovereign Lord. First knock the teeth three times, then softly recite the incantation:

*"Ascending Brahma, treading prosperity, the Sevenfold Numinous Venerable,
Supreme Unity’s sagely plans, Five Spirits of Yellow Tranquility,
Ascend to the Nine Heavens, stand alongside the Emperor,
I beseech to become a flying immortal, my seven ancestors as womb-infants,
Dissolve transgressions and release sins, ascend to the Jade Clarity."*

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth seven times and swallow saliva three times. This is the method of visualizing the spirit, releasing sins, and petitioning the Emperor for immortality. Practicing this for seven years will evoke the resonance of numinous spirits, delight the Sovereign Lord, and prompt the Mysterious Mother to record one’s life. The Five Spirits will abide constantly, the sins of the seven ancestors will be absolved, and they will be reborn as Southern Immortals. One will attain eternal life, ascending in broad daylight to the morning heavens.

Daoist practitioners receiving and studying the methods must not speak of matters concerning death. To mention such things disturbs the *qi* of life, preventing it from residing with the Emperor. Thus, the *qi* of death circulates within, the spirit of life departs, and malevolent *qi* roams the corpse, filling its orifices—this is the gradual onset of illness and death.

Those who receive the Supreme Unity’s visualization of the Five Spirits and cultivate the Nine Palaces’ Fusion with the Sovereign Lord must take care never to harbor anger or wish for their own death. After receiving scriptures, if one’s speech reaches forty instances of such transgressions, they will no longer be deemed a Perfected One. The jade lads and maidens attending the scriptures will report them to the Sovereign Lord as the sin of a fleeing life. The practitioner will surely be examined by the Dark Void and reprimanded by the Supreme Highest. Within three years, their body will perish. These are the statutes of the Yellow Simplicity and the methods of the Supreme Mystery.

Whenever cultivating superior methods or practicing the Feminine Unity or Supreme Unity’s affairs, all scriptures one possesses must be honored with incense, ritual, and incantations to serve the numinous spirits. One must not personally violate them with defilement or negligence, nor recklessly discuss scriptural methods with those of differing aspirations. Those who commit such transgressions will have their faults recorded by the jade lads and maidens attending the scriptures, who will report them to the Sovereign Lord. For each person told, one jade lad and one jade maiden will be lost, returning to the Three Simplicities’ chambers. If three people are told, the jade lads and maidens will all depart. One may then suffer disasters of water or fire, suddenly lose their scriptures, or have them vanish unawares. If transmitted to the unworthy, the Three Heavens’ Life Controllers will punish the transgressor’s body, and they will die as lowly ghosts, eternally serving the Water Officials. These are the statutes and ordinances of the Jade Emperor.

Whenever cultivating the affairs of the Supreme Unity or practicing superior methods of spirit visualization, one must take care never to see corpses or defiled objects. Seeing one corpse results in a year’s inability to practice, nullifying a year’s progress. This is the statute of the Supreme Unity, which both retroactively punishes past transgressions and obstructs future advancement. For one corpse seen in a year, the punishment is three years of severed progress and interrupted practice. If one encounters twenty-four corpses, they will no longer be able to cultivate the Supreme Unity or seek immortality.

Those who cultivate superior methods, the Feminine Unity, or the Supreme Unity’s affairs must ensure that the *qi* of the Three Hun and Five Spirits within their body constantly suffuses their headscarves and garments, while the seven *po*, nine numinous spirits, and residual essence always dwell beneath their shoes. Thus, Daoist students must not sleep on shared mats. Their hempen garments must not borrow the *qi* of others, and their shoes must not be tainted by defiled earth or allow others to touch them, lest the Three Hun be startled.

Whenever Daoist practitioners practice *qi*-absorption, spirit visualization, cloud-swallowing, or seek the Dao of long life, they must never consume the five pungent vegetables or succumb to the maladies of wine and lust. Thus, the divine persons of antiquity said: *"The five pungent vegetables are the axes that hew the viscera; wine and lust are the coffins that bury the body."*

Those who can sever the harm wrought by axes and seal the deathly abode of coffins may then tread the path of ceaseless life and erase the trails leading to divine transcendence. Whenever one seeks reverent awe, one must first strike the Celestial Bell upon the left teeth twenty-six times, then close the *qi* and hiss five times with a "chih-chih" sound to the left, thereby constantly repelling the *qi* of malevolent spirits, inauspicious entities, and foul things.

When retiring at night, just before sleep, place the hand over the heart three times, close the eyes, and softly recite the incantation:
*"Great Numinous Nine Palaces, Great One guards the chamber,
A hundred spirits attend their stations, hun and *po* harmonize as one,
Life eternal, deathless, sealing away all inauspicious and baleful forces."*
Upon completing the incantation, sleep—this is called the *Nine Palaces Hidden Incantation for Sleeping Spirits*. Practicing this regularly will pacify one’s hun and *po*, ensuring constant protection of auspiciousness.

When transmitting the above method, the master possessing the scripture must first seek a spiritual response before imparting it. Entering the chamber to burn incense, one silently vows before the deities, then bows before the scripture and softly recites:
*"Supreme Primordial Lord, Great Divine of the Immortal Capital,
On this auspicious day, I open the Eight Vows to declare:
I wish to transmit this superior method to [name],
Dare I inform the Numinous Origin—grant a sign if it may be proclaimed."*
After the incantation, retire to sleep, and a divine response will surely be received. The disciple will then know in their heart whether it is fitting to receive the transmission.

The method for a scripture master to transmit teachings begins with bowing in the four directions to invoke the divine, establishing the ancestral master as the principal authority. Then, holding the scripture, one rises, faces heaven, and recites an incantation, swearing an oath before the divine spirits as a sacred covenant. One must state the name of the recipient, invoke the great deities, and declare the title of the scripture to be transmitted, setting forth its precepts and recording the vow in writing. After the incantation, the disciple bows twice, kneels to receive the scripture, and bows twice again. This is the inner method of the Perfected One’s divine covenant—it need not involve blood-oaths or risk betrayal.

Whenever a scripture master transmits teachings, they must follow the above method: purify themselves in seclusion, avoid worldly affairs, invoke the divine, and seek a secret response before proceeding. If the signs are inauspicious or the response unfavorable, this indicates the celestial spirits are manifesting their will to prevent transmission. If a disciple disobeys the divine and receives the transmission regardless, according to the statutes of the *Yellow and White Scriptures*, they will face dark judgment, their seven generations of ancestors will be eternally confined to hell, their own body will perish, and transcendence will be beyond hope.

In matters of cultivating the Great One, when making vows or offerings, one must never kowtow. Those who kowtow overturn the Nine Heavens, disturb the Thousand Perfected, disrupt the divine palaces, and invert the Mud Pill Palace, causing the Heavenly Emperor to wail in the Upper Palace and the Great One to weep in the Central Field. Repeatedly doing so renders one’s meditative focus futile: the Three Perfected abandon their abodes, the Seven Spirits scatter, and the Mystic Dwelling invites misfortune—this is the greatest taboo of the Supreme Five Spirits. Thus, the Perfected Ones of antiquity merely stored the intention of kowtowing in their hearts, conducting affairs through refined focus and spiritual resonance, never relying on physical prostration to beseech the divine.

In practicing the Dao of the Great One, Perfected Ones and Daoist practitioners must not perform ritual bows, for this is also forbidden by the Lord Emperor and the Five Spirits. When engaging in focused contemplation and making vows, one should only bow in the heart, without physical prostration. Those who do not cultivate and receive the superior methods are no different from external scholars.

When Daoist practitioners enter seclusion to fast and cultivate, should they suddenly experience wondrous spiritual responses or auspicious dreams, these are signs that the Dao is nearing fruition. The practitioner must diligently cultivate without ceasing, and the celestial convergence will naturally occur. If one persists without interruption, the Perfected Spirits and Jade Maidens will rest in one’s chamber. Upon waking, one should lie supine, face upward, click the teeth twenty-one times, close the eyes, and softly recite:
*"Supreme Red Child, Cinnabar Emperor revolves the Pearl,
Great One, Lord of the Imperial Honored, coalesces the Heavenly Count,
Seven Numinous Ones ascend in response, Five Spirits return in wanderings,
Divine Youth and Jade Maiden, resplendent paired talismans,
Seven Stars ascend together, mounting the Dawn Mound."*
After the incantation, click the teeth twenty-one more times, swallow saliva three times, then open the eyes—this is complete. This is called the *Incantation for the Great One to Retain the Spirit and Convene the Immortal Worthies*. Practicing this for three years will cause the deities of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery to descend and guard you.

When Daoist practitioners enter seclusion to fast and cultivate, if they frequently encounter inauspicious entities, strange apparitions, blood omens, demonic spirits, or foul *qi* attempting to frighten or test them, they should perform the *Northern Emperor’s Incantation to Slay Demons and Exorcise Malevolent Spirits*. First, click the teeth thirty-six times, then recite:
*"The Two Images invert, the banner of the Mystic One,
Seven Spirits guard life, ascending to the Three Clarities,
Dual Emperors drive out, the mighty Cypress Legion,
Three hundred thousand warriors, encamp to guard the divine,
A hundred colossal beasts, spewing might to seize spirits,
Brandishing swords to expel evil, beheading demonic spirits,
What the Divine Earl incants, a thousand demons vanish in form."*
After the incantation, click the teeth thirty-six more times. This is the *Northern Emperor’s Incantation to Slay Demons and Exorcise Malevolent Spirits*. When the divine spirits and upright *qi* hear this incantation, they will all come to protect you, and the inauspicious *qi* will be destroyed.

When Daoist practitioners lodge alone in mountains and forests and are frequently harassed or tested by mountain spirits and malevolent ghosts, they should click their teeth fourteen times, hold their breath, and recite:
*"Yesterday I was summoned by the Emperor, entrusted with the true origin,
Commanded to seal and govern these Five Peaks, to hew and divide Feng Mountain,
All mountain spirits and myriad numina, assemble before the Emperor to receive their duties,
Seven Spirits initiate the procession, Three Origins administer the Perfected,
If any minor demons remain, execute them at once,
Mountain spirits and marsh wardens, hasten to receive my command,
The divine master’s oral decree, ascends to the Three Clarities,
All as in the Great Cavern’s method."*
After the incantation, click the teeth fourteen more times.

Here the Perfected Lord’s method for capturing spirits and subduing mountain demons and the hundred ghosts. All mountain deities, earth numina, and the spirits of proper *qi* in dwellings and shrines—upon hearing this incantation—will come bearing whips to receive and escort, with divine soldiers standing guard, as though ten thousand men shared the same lodging.

Whenever Daoists conceal their traces in mountains and forests, refine their thoughts to summon the numinous, or recite the Cavern Scriptures so that their voices resound, they are often tested and defeated by the Great Demon of the Northern Emperor. At each dusk and night, the adept should click their teeth thirty-six times, then recite:

*"Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor, who receives duties before the Perfected Lord,
Ghosts of the Yellow Springs’ bends, the Four Luminaries and Feng Mountain,
A thousand demons blend their forms, nine heads share one body,
Divine tigers release their venom, beheading and thunderous annihilation,
The Divine Duke utters the incantation, none spared in the slaughter,
The Supreme Subtlety issues its command, governing mountains and rivers,
Clashing bells are cast, radiance streaming through the Nine Heavens,
Wind and fire launch their assault, ten ranks of divine blades arrayed,
Malevolent tests are subdued and extinguished, ten thousand spirits beheaded,
If any demonic poison dares arise, it is sealed within the Three Passes,
Follow the Cavern’s method—none shall defy these words."*

After the incantation, click the teeth thirty-six more times. This is called the **Three Heavens’ Orthodox Method for Incanting Demons and Spirits**. Those who practice it regularly will be attended by divine soldiers, the spirits of mountains and rivers will be subdued, a thousand demons will be sealed, and ten thousand trials will not disturb them.

Whenever Daoists engage in the Great Cavern’s methods or the affairs of the Great One or Imperial One, at dusk they should enter their chamber, burn incense, and bow in reverence before the scriptures. Then, clicking their teeth fourteen times, they softly recite:

*"Supreme One, Imperial Honored One, Imperial One of the Mysterious Scripture,
Five clouds scatter their radiance, dense and penetrating through the Three Clarities,
Jade lads and jade maidens burn incense and attend the numinous,
I humbly present my wishes, that I may merge my form with the divine,
Granting me immortality as a transcendent, ever prosperous and upright."*

After the incantation, click the teeth fourteen more times. This is called **Burning Incense to the Imperial One, Presenting Wishes Above, and Merging with the Numinous**. Those who practice this regularly will be attended by jade effulgences, divine spirits will aid their perfection, fragrant clouds will scatter and ascend to the Nine Heavens. Within three years, jade maidens and jade lads will appear before them.

Whenever Daoists enter their chamber to fast and cultivate sincerity, when about to eat, they should hold the chopsticks in their left hand and tap the plate three times, then softly recite:

*"Two Mysteries, Supreme Dao, Four Poles in pure clarity,
Supreme One, Imperial Lord, the hundred spirits in yellow tranquility,
Receive sustenance in the Three Palaces, irrigating the spirit of the spleen,
Offering to the Great Harmony above, partaking of the five fragrances,
The life of the hun-soul and fetal spirit, the seven fluids flow and settle,
A hundred passages harmonize, the five viscera flourish in radiance,
The Twin Sovereigns merge with the effulgence, soaring to ascend the Upper Clarity."*

After eating, tap the plate three more times. This is called the **Method for the Hun-Soul and Fetal Spirit to Receive Fragrance and the Hundred Spirits to Partake of Sustenance**. Those who practice this regularly will find their spirit and *qi* harmonized, their hun and po at peace, evil and trials averted, and enduring prosperity and uprightness.

Whenever Daoists arrange their hair into a topknot or wash their hair to let it down, they should first click their teeth seven times, then softly intone:

*"The Supreme Emperor scatters blossoms, the Mysterious returns to the Great Spirit,
On this auspicious day, I arrange my hair and wash away the dust,
Averting evil and illness, attaining long life as a transcendent."*

After the incantation, once the hair is arranged, click the teeth seven more times to conclude. This is called the **Supreme Emperor’s Method for Scattering Blossoms While Arranging Hair**. Those who practice it will remain free from illness throughout the year, their ears and eyes keen, their head and brain free from pain.

Whenever Daoists enter their chamber to burn incense and make vows, they should first click their teeth three times, then softly recite:

*"Jade effulgences scatter their radiance, the nine *qi* merge with the mist,
Fragrant clouds densely woven, directly piercing the Nine Heavens,
The jade maiden attending the incense reports above to the Emperor,
Granting me long life, that I may become a true transcendent in this world,
Whatever I face or wish for, none shall defy these words."*

After the incantation, bow in reverence and focus the mind, expressing whatever is in one’s heart. This is called the **Supreme Constancy’s Hidden Incantation for Scattering Incense, Inviting the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Presence into the Chamber, and the Method for Wishes to Meet with Transcendents**.

Whenever Daoists travel alone and lodge in mountains, forests, or temple halls—places teeming with demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts—they should first click their teeth thirty-six times, hold their breath, and softly recite:

*"Supreme Emperor of Yang’s Origin, the Four Directions’ hidden passes,
A thousand demons and ten thousand poisons dare not stand before me,
Great beasts with double jaws, disemboweling and dismembering livers,
Divine lords and messengers guard and defend the encampment,
Yellow-robed master soldiers, slaying and beheading demonic souls,
Annihilating a thousand demons, crushing mountain traitors,
Eradicating their kind and lineage, beheading and exterminating them,
The Jade Emperor’s supreme command, purging the Three Origins."*

After the incantation, click the teeth thirty-six more times. This is called the **Supreme Constancy’s Method for Wielding the Divine Inner Incantation to Seal and Annihilate Ten Thousand Demons**. Those who recite it regularly will find divine soldiers attending them, ten thousand ghosts submitting, and a thousand demons dead and subdued.

Whenever Daoists prepare for sleep and remove their clothes, they should first click their teeth three times, stand, and intone:

*"Receiving the command of the Supreme Emperor, ascending to the Nine Palaces,
A hundred spirits settle into their positions, arrayed to attend the Divine Duke,
Hun and po harmonize and refine, the five viscera flourish in radiance,
A hundred elixirs mystically infuse, the seven fluids fill the void,
Crossed fire and bells radiate, extinguishing ghosts and averting misfortune,
I humbly wish for transcendence, eternal life without end."*

After the intonation, click the teeth three more times, then remove the clothes and lie down. This is called the **Supreme Emperor’s Method for Sleeping Spirits and Annihilating Ghosts and Misfortune**. Those who practice it will remain clear in spirit and free from illness, their hun and po ever present, and receive many auspicious signs.

Whenever Daoists bathe their bodies or wash their hands and face, they should first stand before the water, click their teeth three times, and softly intone:

*"The Four Great open the Mysterious, Heaven and Earth as constancy,
Mysterious water washes away filth, averting and dispelling inauspiciousness,
The Twin Sovereigns guard the gate, the Seven Numinous settle the chamber,
Cloudy essences refine and irrigate, ten thousand *qi* blend in harmony,
Inner and outer prosper and remain upright, preserving this yellow robe."*

After the incantation, click the teeth three more times, then wash the hands and face. This is called the **Method for Washing Away Filth and Averting Misfortune, the Seven Chambers’ Incantation**. Those who practice it regularly will find their spirit bright and blood purified, all inauspicious *qi* dissolved.

When Daoists travel at night or find themselves in places that inspire fear and trembling, they should click their teeth twice seven times, then softly intone:

*"I am the True King of Lesser Existence, the Three Heavens’ Master Lords,
Once receiving the Supreme Shang’s divine formula, the scripture for slaying evil,
Night-wandering corpse-spirits, seven malign specters,
Nine demons as thieves, a thousand fiends in swarms,
The mighty Hèbǎi Diagram’s troops, colossal beasts by the thousand,
Wielding blades to sever ten thousand perils—
Should they face me, they shall be shattered,
Seven Dragon Beacons pursue evil without pause,
The Jade Emperor’s divine incantation, sword swinging east and west,
Eradicating misfortune and expelling evil,
Ten thousand ghosts instantly suspended,
The Three Heavens’ Orthodox Dharma—all as I declare."*

After the incantation, click the teeth twice seven times again.
This is called the **Three Heavens’ Orthodox Dharma, the Hidden Incantation for Dispelling the Six Heavens’ Concealments**.
Any ghost subjected to this invocation will be struck blind and maimed, perishing of its own accord.
Wherever one travels in fear, simply follow this method—it need not be confined to night journeys.
Those who recite it regularly will find ten thousand demons subdued and a thousand perils dissolved.

The **Method for Daoists to Invoke and Eliminate the Three Corpses** is practiced on the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, and on the days of *jiǎyín*, *gēngyín*, and *gēngshēn*. On these occasions, the seven *pò*-spirits and wandering corpse-ghosts within the body, along with the various blood-corpses, ascend to heaven to report one’s transgressions. They then return to harm the body or wander into other regions, becoming so-called "external ghosts" that conspire to bring calamity.
Thus, evil dreams disturb the sleeping soul, and illnesses cling to the spirit-chamber.
All nightmares and ailments arise from the machinations of the seven *pò* and wandering corpses.
On these days, one should bathe, don clean robes, burn incense, enter the chamber, and focus the mind upward in reverence, avoiding all other distractions.
At the hour when *qi* first stirs in the night, or at dusk, lie facing east, place the hands over the heart, and first click the teeth three times seven. Then softly intone:

*"Seven Numinous, Five Spirits, Eight Vows, Four Declarations,
I report to the Spirit-Mandate, the Central August’s Twin Perfected,
Record the hun-soul, refine the pò-spirit, seal and extinguish evil essences,
Blood-ghosts and wandering corpses, lingering defilements—forever obliterated,
Harmonize my gate of life, seal my gate of death,
If any dark mandate exists, let it be judged before the Emperor,
Grant me long life, eternal kalpas preserved,
By the Great Emperor’s Dharma, I dare address the Three Origins."*

Afterward, click the teeth three times seven again, swallow saliva ten times, and conclude.
This is called the **Great Emperor’s Method for Restraining the Hun-Soul and Vanquishing the Corpse-Spirit**.
Any blood-corpses or seven *pò* subjected to this incantation will be destroyed beneath the dead corpse, their *hun* illuminated and *pò* softened, transformed within the Three Palaces.
It dispels evil, removes illness, and ensures the spirit remains bright and undying.
Those who recite it regularly will never suffer from dullness or confusion.

---

When focusing the mind on the supreme Dao and invoking the expulsion of the Three Corpses, one should gather the roots of *bái zhǐ* and *qīng mù xiāng*, boil them in east-flowing water, and bathe the body to repel all blood-corpses and malign *qi*. These herbs may also be blended into incense and burned to summon divine clarity.
If *qīng mù xiāng* is unavailable, *bái zhǐ* alone may suffice.

---

On the days of *gēngshēn* and *jiǎyín*, the blood-ghosts and wandering corpses align in their appointed cycles.
On these days, celestial *qi* intermingles, the seven *pò* vie in chaos, defilement obscures the true, and perverse essences surge.
Through diligent practice of the Dharma and the refinement of fluids, the seven spirits scatter like whirlwinds.
On such days, one must purify the body in seclusion, avoiding shared mats, and take care not to meet with spouse or share a bed.
One must also refrain from quarreling over wealth or lust, or engaging in unorthodox conduct.
During incense-burning and *qi*-cultivation, the recitation of incantations may be accompanied by scripture-chanting to harmonize the spirit.
If contemplating the affairs of the Cavern Chamber’s Imperial Unity, one must ensure the essence remains pure and true.

---

When Daoists suddenly experience inauspicious dreams—such as dreaming of fighting with others or being seized—these too are the work of the seven *pò* and wandering corpses.
They may lead external ghosts into one’s home, scatter the three *hun*, incite strife among the five spirits, or bind one so they cannot return, thus causing nightmares and foreshadowing misfortune.
Upon waking, face upward in bed, place the hands over the heart, click the teeth three times seven, and softly intone:

*"Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor, Four Gates’ Eight Numinous,
Seven Chambers’ Two Mysteries, Three Pristine Original Essences,
Grand Unity and Peach Prosperity, ascending to the Three Clarities,
I beseech the Imperial Lords, summon the Yellow Tranquility,
Hasten to gather the seven pò, verify them in the divine court,
If any inauspiciousness exists—seven corpse-ghosts and demonic troops—
I invoke the Twin Perfected, streaming torches to refine their forms,
Great Tàiwēi Emperor, sever and strike down evil essences,
Three hun harmonized and refined, blood-corpses scattered and dissolved,
Spirits return to the deserted abode, turning toward upright prosperity,
Grant me divine transcendence, eternal kalpas preserved."*

After the incantation, click the teeth twice seven times and swallow saliva ten times.
This is called the **Great Emperor’s Divine Incantation for Dispelling Nightmares and Averting Misfortune**.
Those who practice it will find their three *hun* harmonized and refined, their seven *pò* restrained, their spirit bright and *qi* upright, corpse-defilements dispersed and destroyed.
The ghosts thus invoked will have already been consigned to hell.
After these three incantations, unless blessed by numinous and auspicious responses, one will no longer dream of the extraordinary.

---

When Daoists make vows to the divine, focus their thoughts on the supreme Dharma, or recite hidden incantations, they should burn incense, bow in reverence, and whisper the words silently, ensuring no one hears.
If invoking the vanquishing of the Six Heavens and the destruction of malign ghosts, one may speak softly, but not so loudly as to be overheard or understood by others.
When reciting scriptures, however, one may proceed as desired.

---

The eight solar terms are days when the immortals of the Three Heavens gather for feasts and rites.
Those who cultivate the Dao and make vows should observe these days for their practices and morning devotions.
As for the rites performed on the new and full moons, these do not pertain to the supreme Dharma.

On such days, when preparing to perform rites, make vows, or recite incantations, one should first strike the teeth seven times, then bow in reverence to the four directions, and softly intone the following incantation:

*"Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, Three Primordial Sovereigns, Most High Numinous Ones, Divine Lords of the Immortal Capital—on this auspicious day, the Eight Vows are declared:
The first vow: to ascend the soaring heavens and attain the long-lived immortals.
The second vow: that heaven and earth harmonize with luminous winds and clouds.
The third vow: that the Five Viscera remain ever-present within me.
The fourth vow: that the Seven Ancestors be freed from karmic bonds and transgressions.
The fifth vow: that the Lord Emperor sever the roots of my mortal lineage.
The sixth vow: that in life after life, wisdom be fully awakened.
The seventh vow: to vanquish malign spirits and decapitate the Six Heavens.
The eighth vow: that numinous beings descend and heed my pleas from east to west.
May the first vow unite with all others, and may every word spoken be fulfilled.
May divine beings and immortals ascend to pay homage to the Three Origins."*

Upon completing the incantation, bow again as before. One may then express one’s intentions freely, seeking liberation for the Seven Ancestors’ transgressions and confessing one’s own offenses, appending these to the ritual proceedings.

This is called the *Hidden Incantation of the Three Origins and Eight Homages*, the essential method of the immortals’ vows. Practicing it for three years will dissolve the sins of the Seven Ancestors, one’s parents, and oneself. Thereafter, the Jade Flower will descend as a guardian, spirits will respond in kind, and the Eight Vows, once declared, will assuredly secure the covenant of the numinous immortals.

The *Forty-Four Directions of the Yellow Simplicity* above is the method of the Great Dao Lord’s primordial *qi* of the Three Heavens, later compiled into the wondrous scriptures as a model for ritual practice. According to this scriptural text, the divine method is truly sublime, enabling cultivators to apply it for the governance of the body—a proven and efficacious spiritual formula.

Without the jade tablets of the Three Origins, the imperial charts, or the registers of immortality, the Forty-Four Directions must not be transmitted. This divine formula surpasses all other texts in marvel, concealed within the imperial chambers. At the time of transmission, only those who have transcended the ranks of high immortals, undergone trials by the Supreme Ultimate, received audience with the Jade Emperor twice, and been reapproved by the Most High may receive it. This is the true method of the Three Heavens, bound by a seven-generation covenant, never to be passed to those unworthy of the mysterious and upright. Should one violate celestial prohibitions and recklessly divulge the arcane method, the covenanted ancestors will be confined together in the earthly prisons, the self will be examined by the Water Officials, and the hope of immortality shall be forfeit.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Forty-Four Directions of the Yellow Simplicity of Supreme Clarity*.
