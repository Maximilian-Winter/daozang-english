**The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Dawn Lord of the Highest Emperor, from *The Wondrous Scripture of the Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent in the Supreme Clarity, Dancing Heaven Sutra***

The Divine Continent lies north of the Celestial Pass, with the sun and moon revolving to its south. The Seven Stars turn as a wheel at its center, circling left through the Eight Latitudes by day and right through the Seven Constellations by night. As the Seven Stars complete their revolution, the celestial radiance returns in its numinous splendor.

This is the realm where the Purple Dawn of the Highest Emperor receives transformation, cultivating the method of the Seven Cycles to ascend to the Jade Clarity.

The Purple Dawn Lord of the Highest Emperor is the descendant of the Twin Radiance, embodying the essence of the Kingly Dawn. Born of the Dragon Mist in the Great Void, he enfolds the Purple Emptiness within the Permeating Numinous. Entrusted to the Nine Mysteries to contain his brilliance, he congeals the Vast Dew to form his spirit, refines the Three Qi to bathe himself, and traverses the Mysterious Mother to be born through the Dao. Enduring kalpas of transformation, he responds to the Auspicious Day to cleanse his form.

In the first year of the Highest Emperor, on the celestial stem *jia* at dawn, he was born in the Heaven of Eight Effulgences of the Divine Continent, by the shores of the Abyssal Cavern in the central plains of the Level Mound. His taboo name is *Po*, and his style is *Hufeng*. At the moment of his birth, his face shone with golden countenance, his body radiated jade light, and his five-colored purple markings underwent seventy-two transformations. His spirit illumined his jade visage, as the divine dragon spat forth mushrooms to nourish him, and the simurgh and phoenix danced their wings to adorn the Mysterious. The cinnabar auroras scattered their splendor upon the jasper pavilion, and flowing light blazed brilliantly in the distant Realms of Truth. The Twin Effulgences paused their radiance in the Eight Clarities, and the Seven Primes revolved their essence to assist the dawn. The golden immortals dispersed incense to mingle with the qi, and the divine consorts cast flowers to kindle the mist. The Five Latitudes wove their patterns, and the divine splendor suffused the purple heavens.

At the age of eighteen, he roamed freely in the Middle Prime, consuming essence and swallowing qi, exhaling and inhaling the numinous fluids. He ingested mushrooms for inner irrigation, congealed his spirit into the Embryo Immortal, drew in and rinsed with silence, and dwelled in natural detachment. His thoughts were subtle, his mindfulness of qi unceasing, and through accumulated resonance with the Cavernous Prime, his name transcended the Supreme Clarity. He received the title of Primordial Emperor, ascended to the position of Purple Dawn, and the orchid phoenix responded with auspicious omens. Following the flow of destiny, his spirit embraced the Five Luminaries, and his form coiled with the Seven Primes. Soaring through the auroras, he rode the void’s misty webs, as the host of immortals opened the path. The Three Ways merged in luminosity, and streaming lightning issued forth his might. His swift chariot traversed the Nine Mysteries, ascending the jade steps twice and paying homage thrice at the Purple Court. He wandered the jasper towers, feasted in the Three Primes, and forged bonds with the Five Elders. As an honored guest in the Jade Auroras, flying beasts rampaged and divine phoenixes soothed with their cries. The great yoke and reins were held by the numinous winds, which scattered incense and wafted fragrance in billowing waves, suffusing the Jade Clarity.

The Divine King of the Sun Valley, overseer of the jade offices of immortals, presented the *Primordial Chart of the Nine Mysteries* in azure essence and emerald numen, along with the *Luminous Chapter of the Nine Transformations and the Solar Effulgence*, to refine the true and transform the form, roaming the Cavernous Upper Palace. To the west, in the Dark Feathered Primal Wilderness by the shores of the Western Ridge’s misty expanse, within the Purple Tenuity’s Jade Hall, the Queen Mother requested the *Pristine Chapter of the Radiant Numen* and the *Primordial Register of Mount Tortoise* to determine the true and establish the royal standard, bestowing the title of Purple Emperor. To the south, he journeyed to the Great Cinnabar of the Vermilion Mound, the land of extreme flame and flowing fire, to the Nine-Tiered Jade Terrace of the Sun Palace. The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen presented the *Great Cinnabar Cavernous Prime Fire Bell and the Seven Luminaries’ Jasper Chapter*, along with the *Golden True Jade Radiance*, to summon the Twin Effulgences’ jade essence and refine the sevenfold transformations of his countenance. To the north, he traveled to the frigid lands of the Nine Mysteries in the Dark Yin. The Nine Primes True Consort of the Jade Dawn of the Great Yin received the *Flying Effulgence Treasure Chapter of Flowing Essence*, the desolate *Nine Luminaries*, and the *Seven Primes of the Vast Fall*, to part the Celestial Pass and ascend to the Jade Capital for audience. He mounted the towering terrace of the Primordial Heaven’s Effulgent Jade Capital, with its nine winding chambers.

The Great True Elder and the Most High Lord of the Great Dao received the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* to govern the Six Heavens, and the *Flying Essence Chapter of the Nine Seams*, donning the *Seal of the Flowing Gold Phoenix*. Thus, he ascended to the position of the Purple Dawn Lord of the Highest Emperor.

Thereupon, his numinous radiance shone forth, his golden countenance beamed, and his body was clad in the dharma robes. Upon his head rested the *Seven-Colored Crown of the Purple Script and Flying Frost*. His attendants—ten billion immortals and maidens—along with flying dragons and venomous beasts, guarded his jasper chariot. The night naturally brightened with divine candles, and the chamber dispersed the misty fragrance of the Void. The winds stirred the dark banners, and the dance swirled in profusion. His whistling resounded through the Great Vacuity, and the jade tones rang out in harmony. The empty chant soared as a flying song, and the eight echoes responded in unison. The simurghs cried and phoenixes played, their pure melodies attuning to the Mysterious Peace. The dark essence revolved in reflection, and the Three Dawns paused their canopies. The myriad immortals offered obeisance and celebration, all submitting in reverence. He governed the palace of the Divine Continent’s numen, the boundless and desolate halls, regulating the revolutions of the Three and Five, rescuing and transforming the difficulties of the Tang succession. He ordered the Two Modes within the Mysterious Chart and oversaw the legacy of the Highest Emperor. In tranquil recitation within the jasper pavilion, he gazed downward into the profound and played with the obscure, while the lush Three Passes unfolded their hidden verses. He commanded the singing of the Mysterious Hymn, the resounding of the Luminous Model, and the praise of the Resonant Response. The empty tones galloped freely, and the Cavernous Wisdom shone brilliantly. He spurred the Eight Winds to hasten his form, seized the streaming lightning to exalt his essence, summoned the Six Jia within the Five Phases, and employed the martial legions of the Celestial Soldiers. He dispatched talismans to the Five Peaks to await his chariot and issued proclamations of might to rouse the numinous. He transformed the heavens above the Divine Continent and revolved the Seven Cycles within the Wondrous Court. He summoned the Void and Emptiness to bathe himself and ingested jade talismans to ascend in form. He wove the celestial patterns of the sun and moon and revolved the Seven Qi within the Dipper Stars.

Thereupon, he drifted through the Nine Realms, his noble sons sharing his chariot, the Directors of Destiny aligning their wheels. He roamed and feasted in the Purple Dawn, encompassing the Cavernous Abyss and commanding the host of immortals. From the heavens downward, none failed to serve the Highest Emperor, for the Dao of the Seven Transformations was wondrous indeed.

**The Supreme Scripture of the Seven Cycles**

The Dao of the Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations was received by the Purple Dawn Lord of the Highest Emperor from the Nine Heavenly Parents. Upon perfecting his cultivation, he transmitted it to the Highest Emperor Lord of the Pure Heaven. The Highest Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, who passed it to the True Primordial Lord of the Purple Culmen. The True Primordial Lord of the Purple Culmen transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen. The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, who passed it to the Later Sage Lord of the Golden Portal. The Later Sage Lord of the Golden Portal transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Prime Minister, forming an unbroken lineage of true transmission. Through the wisdom of kalpas, each transmission was recorded in a minor register by the King of Calculations and the Queen of the Later Sage. One copy was sealed within the mountains of the Western Region. Those who obtain it are all received as sagely lords in the Supreme Clarity Palace, granted twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens to attend the numinous scriptures and protect the bearers of this scripture.

The Way of the Seven Cycles of the Supreme Prime Lord is inscribed on crimson tablets and written in purple script, concealed within the Jade Chamber of the Golden House of the Primordial Terrace of the Purple Heaven. It is conferred only upon perfected transcendents, never taught to beginners. Those who receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Cavernous Perfection*, the *Jade Tablet of the Feminine One*, or the *Wondrous Scripture of the Great Existence*—though they may dissolve stagnation and deliver the Seven Mysteries—yet remain ignorant of the Seven Cycles and thus cannot be said to chant the Jade Chapters.

The verses of the Seven Cycles are the melodies of the Divine Continent, the celestial tones of the Most High. They circulate through heaven and earth, interweaving with the Three Mornings. Turning left and revolving right, they converge at the Cavernous Gate, transmuting the Five into the Two to align with the Seven Origins, and cycling the Three into the Five to traverse the Celestial Pass. Their Way is profoundly subtle, and thus they are called the [ ] Heaven.

To chant them once is to achieve unbroken clarity; seven cycles and eight recitations harmonize the Three Luminaries as one reality. The Five Elders fix the registers, the Lords of Destiny revise the records, knots of past karma are untied, and the roots of rebirth severed. Nine generations of ancestors ascend, and the adept is reborn as a womb-transcendent. A thousand autumns are mastered, ten thousand demons bound in submission. After ten thousand recitations, one ascends to the Purple Morn.

In practicing the Way of the Seven Cycles, one must first recite the chapter of the Most High Great Dao Lord, then the chapter of the Three Origins Purple Essence Lord, followed by the chapter of the True Yang Primordial Elder Mysterious One Lord, then the chapter of the Azure Spirit Yang Peace Lord, next the chapter of the August Clarity Cavernous Perfection Lord, then the chapter of the Nine Heavens Supreme Perfection, and finally the chapter of the Primordial Most High Jade Sovereign. These seven cycles conclude with the Primordial Most High.

Next, recite the chapter of the Supreme Prime Dao, then the chapter of the August Thearch Lord, followed by the chapter of the Great Yang Lord, then the chapter of the Most High Great Simplicity Lord, next the chapter of the Central Yellow Elder Lord, then the chapter of the Non-Dual Middle Perfected Supreme Elder Lord, and finally the chapter of the August Primordial Purple Vacuity Lord. Returning to recite the chapter of the Most High Great Dao Lord, these eight latitudinal cycles conclude at the Jade Capital Mountain governed by the Most High.

Recite again as before, beginning from the fifth chapter, and repeat seven times to complete the practice. Thus, one’s voice ascends to the Jade Sovereign, and the myriad perfected ones bow in reverent harmony. Below, the ten thousand realms are summoned, and the true form is bound and refined. After a hundred days of diligent cultivation, bathing to cleanse dust and grime, seated upon the numinous mat, recite the Seven Cycles ten thousand times. When the Dao is perfected, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

The Most High Jade Chapters are to be reverently practiced in secret. Beware of revealing them to the unworthy, for leaking the numinous verses brings annihilation upon oneself and condemns one’s descendants to the Seven Mysteries.

When practicing the Way of the Seven Cycles, on the first and fifteenth days of each month, as well as during the eight solar terms, observe purification rites. At noon, enter the chamber, face east, and recite the Seven Cycles eight times. At midnight, face north and recite them seven more times. In a single day and night, complete fifteen cycles. This aligns above with the Celestial Pass, circulating the Three Luminaries; centers and harmonizes the body, unblocking the passages and stabilizing the spirit; and below, subdues the myriad demons, pacifying the thousand spirits. The cycles interweave and harmonize, uniting the Five in radiant clarity. Those who neglect this Way descend into darkness after death, but through earnest cultivation and苦念, one ascends in a flying chariot to the Purple Morn, roaming and feasting in the Jade Clarity.

The Way of the Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent’s [ ] Heaven commands the service of twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens. They traverse the Five Marchmounts, their dark-veined jade tokens in hand, riding azure radiance dragons, bearing tiger talismans of spirit, wearing lotus crowns, clad in purple embroidered feathered robes and cinnabar-green flying skirts. They ring golden bells and jade chimes, unfurl purple canopies and flowered banners, and wield nine vermilion-striped talismans to seal mountains and summon clouds, ascending to the Golden Hall of the Purple Culmen.

If one has not yet transformed into a radiant ascendant, practicing this Way while still in the mortal realm, the Nine Heavens’ Parents—the Supreme Prime Purple Morn—will bestow upon the adept the vestments of flying transcendents and feathered scriptures, though these remain concealed from the clamor of the dusty world. When cultivating this Way, one should constantly visualize oneself adorned in these sacred garments, riding dragons and driving clouds. After seven years, the true spirit will manifest, and one will ascend to the Purple Morn.

The Registrar of Destinies inscribes their immortal register,
Receiving their titles before the Jade Thearch.

The Jade Chapter of the Divine Continent is the hymn of the Fourteen Thearchs’ Cavern-Wilds, the inner names of the hundred spirits, the dark image of the Jade Heaven, the essence of the Three Mornings. Reciting its chapters, the jade resonance stirs the Upper Primordial Void, so that the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings and the ten thousand immortals all attend in the divine court, bowing their heads to the sacred sound.

Thus, when reciting the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one must first practice the Way of the Seven Revolutions. This chapter interlinks the Ten Heavens, revolves and halts the Three Mornings, ten thousand demons prostrate and flee, a thousand demons lose their forms. Reciting it ten thousand times, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

On the third, seventh, ninth, fourteenth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-seventh days of the month, take *Angelica dahurica*, *Ailanthus* wood, and peach bark—three substances, each seven parts—boil them in seven *dou* of water, and at the hour of *zi*, facing north, wash your head. Before washing, knock the teeth nine times and softly invoke:

*"Five rivers, vast pools,
Curving waters, cinnabar blossoms,
Wash away filth and dust,
Fragrant and flowing,
Spirit and form refined,
Jade nectar and mushroom mud."*

When the washing is complete, recite this secret incantation:

*"Divine Perfected transform their radiance,
Reshaping countenance and refining form,
Body containing jade marrow,
Stomach storing blossoming life."*

This is the Way of the Nine Baths for transformation and refinement. Practicing it makes the body fragrant and the spirit communicative, uniting with the Perfected in numinosity. Without knowing this method, the divine luminaries will not descend, and recitation will not penetrate. Let the scholar cultivate it.

**The Scripture of the Divine Continent’s Seven Transformations for Dancing in Heaven**

**First Transformation: Qi**
First, transform the body into cloud, summon wind and transcend qi, exhale flames to become mist, with five auroras crowning the head to transform the omen-body. Through accumulated resonance, the Dao descends, ascending to Grand Mystery.

On the days of *ren* and *gui*, at midnight during the hour of *zi*, burn incense in a quiet chamber, sit evenly facing north, calm the mind, close the eyes, and visualize qi. See mist and dew swirling, crowning and covering the body until all is settled. Utter three long whistles, sensing wind and qi entering the chamber. Then, with the left breath, exhale nine times, visualizing qi leaving the mouth and transforming into blue mist. Nine times, summon the Eastern Blue Aurora, whose name is *Fēi Xū*, to guard the left. Turn to the right, exhale seven breaths, visualizing qi leaving the mouth and transforming into white mist. Seven times, summon the Western White Aurora, whose name is *Sù Lú*, to guard the right. Glance left and right, exhale three breaths, visualizing qi leaving the mouth and transforming into red mist. Three times, summon the Southern Red Aurora, whose name is *Dān Yìng*, to stand before you. Exhale five breaths straight ahead, visualizing qi leaving the mouth and transforming into black mist. Five times, summon the Northern Black Aurora, whose name is *Xuán Xiàng*, to guard behind. Exhale twelve breaths upward, visualizing qi leaving the mouth and transforming into yellow mist. Twelve times, summon the Central Yellow Aurora, whose name is *Zǒng Shēng*, to guard the form.

When all is complete, knock the teeth twelve times and invoke upward:

*"Summon wind to command heaven,
Exhale qi to become mist,
Mist and dew swirling,
Spreading across the Ten Heavens,
Five auroras entwining,
Crowning my body,
Transforming with the form,
No delay in appearance,
Responding to the call,
Ascending to the Thearch’s morning."*

Afterward, ingest the *Flying Mystery Life Talisman of Aurora Essence and Jade Radiance*, lie down with the head to the north, stretch the four limbs upward, close the eyes, and visualize the body transforming into a five-colored cloud. The cloud-qi swirls, merging with qi to ascend lightly, drifting and rising into the void, dispersing to fill the heavens, circling without bounds, then returning from the emptiness. Rub the palms until warm, wipe the face twenty-seven times, then from the top down to the feet three times. Shake the head seven times, face north, and softly invoke:

*"Five colors transform the radiance,
Becoming flying clouds,
Merging with the body’s qi,
Together ascending the Cavern-Gate,
Riding the auroras to entwine the morning,
Ascending to meet the Three Primordials."*

Afterward, swallow qi seven times and stop.

Practicing this for seven years without daily lapse, cloud-qi will descend in resonance, responding to qi and gathering in echo. The body transforms and the form changes, merging with qi as mist, riding clouds to fly, ascending to the Thearch’s morning. This is the most wondrous Way, the Jade Scroll of the Highest Thearch. Secretly uphold and cultivate it; be cautious not to show it to others. Heaven’s statutes warn: transmit only with utmost care.

**Second Transformation: Light**
Transform the body into light, illuminating the chamber’s interior, shining brilliantly across the Eight Wastes, riding the dark to ascend into the Grand Void.

Practice this Way on the new moon, the third, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the month, at noon. Enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, settle the spirit and stabilize qi, close the eyes and meditate. Visualize the essence-light of the sun’s center, five-colored flowing auroras blazing in the east. Within the light, there is also purple qi, large as the eye’s pupil, shining brilliantly amid the five lights, flowing and dazzling across the heavens.

Then silently invoke the inner name of the Sun-Soul: "Sun-Soul Pearl Radiance Shining Green Reflected Rosy Clouds Crimson Youth Dark Flame Whirlwind Image." These sixteen characters in full. Once done, visualize the sunlight descending upon your form, entering your left eye’s pupil. After a moment, purple qi envelops your crown inside and out.

Next, visualize the essence-light of the moon’s center, five-colored flowing essences shining brilliantly in the west. Within the moonlight, there is also yellow qi, large as the eye’s pupil, glowing amid the lunar radiance, flowing and dazzling across the heavens. Then silently invoke the inner name of the Moon-Spirit: "Moon-Spirit Warm Mist Fragrant Bloom Veiled Vast Graceful Void Numinous Orchid Luxuriant Blossom Jade Purity Gleaming Gen Upright Terrace Mark." These twenty-four characters in full. Once done, visualize the moonlight descending upon your form, entering your right eye’s pupil. After a moment, yellow qi envelops your crown inside and out. The twin luminaries of sun and moon merge, intertwining and coiling around your body.

Then click your teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation: "Sun and Moon’s mysterious light, round heaven’s paired essence, nine yangs transform as one, twin vapors arise together. Dark auroras flow and shine, pouring into my form. Transform radiance into light, blending with qi. Sitting or standing, vanish—twin perfected ones unite in spirit. Mounting the three steeds, soar and float, ascending to the Jade Court."

Once done, ingest the Yin-Yang Jade Radiance Opening Brightness Numinous Talisman. Then lie down facing east, stretching your limbs upward, close your eyes, and visualize within the sun the Youthful Yang Lord, seven inches tall, wearing a flying celestial crown and a crimson silk robe, surnamed Xi, named Zhao Ling. Within the moon, visualize the Maiden of Moonlight, the Lesser Yin Woman, three inches and five parts tall, her head adorned with a seven-tiered "Advancing Worth" treasure crown, wearing a white silk flying skirt, surnamed Xuan, named E Jing. The twin perfected ones descend into your body, governing the pupils of your two eyes.

Visualize your own body transforming into the five-colored light of sun and moon, flowing and blazing brilliantly. Feel your body become weightlessly buoyant, suddenly treading the void, ascending with the light. Your entire body envelops in warmth, as if dwelling within the sun and moon, journeying through the four directions, traversing the heavens, then returning. Then rub your palms until warm, wipe your face twenty-one times, stroke from top to bottom three times, rise and shake your head seven times.

Once done, look up and recite the incantation: "Twin radiance flows and shines, light illuminating the five forms. Inside and out, thoroughly permeated, transformation arises instantly. Ascending with qi, uniting essence with light, the round blossom unfurls, bearing the luminous one’s spirit. Dark perfection spreads and scatters, carrying me into the unseen."

Once done, swallow qi twenty-four times and stop. Practicing this for eighteen years, your eyes will emit lightning-like radiance, and your head will perpetually bear the essence of sun and moon. Transforming and altering your radiance, you will equal the twin luminaries, riding the void and commanding the sky, ascending to the Jade Court.

This wondrous transformation Way must be secretly upheld and practiced; do not reveal it. If divulged, calamity will extend to the Seven Mysteries, and your body will sink into the dark springs—you will never attain immortality.

**Third Transformation: Fire**
First, cause your body to transform into the essence of fire, its radiant light flowing with flames, refining and tempering your form inside and out. From fire, rebirth arises. Your body undergoes the Three Refining Trials, enabling ascent to the Grand Clarity. Only through diligent focus can you summon the true numen.

Practice this Way on the days of *jia-wu*, *bing-wu*, *wu-wu*, *geng-wu*, *yi-mao*, *ding-mao*, *ji-mao*, and *xin-mao*. Enter the chamber, burn incense, face south, and close your eyes in meditation. Visualize above your head a qi of blue smoke, thickly crowning your head. Then visualize within your left eye the Blazing Yang Lord of Firelight, seven inches tall, surnamed Zhu, named Chi Jing, his head adorned with a three-beamed "Rosy Dawn" treasure crown, wearing a crimson silk robe. In his left hand, he holds the Sun Essence; in his right, the Talisman of Transforming Radiance and Pervading Light. Within your right eye, visualize the Crimson Jade Radiant Numinous Perfected Jade Maiden, five inches tall, surnamed Nan, named E Yan, her head adorned with a three-cornered "Flying Cloud" topknot, wearing a crimson silk garment. In her left hand, she holds the Moon Pearl; in her right, the Jade Talisman of Seven Transformations Refining Essence.

The two emerge from your eyes and ascend into the blue smoke, their mysterious light shining and illuminating your crown. Click your teeth three times and recite the incantation:

The two Fire Essence spirits transform and generate flowing flames, refining the body and altering its radiance. They ride the blue smoke and soar, merging with the primordial qi, penetrating deeply into the Fire Realm. The Peach Lord bestows the talismans, and the register of life endures forever.

When finished, ingest the two talismans: the Talisman of Transforming Radiance and Pervading Light, and the Jade Talisman of Seven Transformations Refining Essence. After ingestion, loosen your clothing and belt, let down your hair, lie with your head to the south, stretch your four limbs upward, close your eyes, and draw in the qi of the blue smoke through your nose, swallowing it twenty-one times. Then exhale red qi forty-five times. As you exhale, visualize the qi forming a fire essence that crowns your body, and see yourself within the fire until your body feels thoroughly warm, with a slight sweat being ideal.

Then rise, face south, and call three times to the spirit of your left eye, Chi Jing, and three times to the spirit of your right eye, E Yan. The two spirits together refine and deliver my body with the great flaming smoke.

Next, rub your palms until warm and wipe your eyes forty-five times, then stroke your face down to your feet seven times.

When finished, look up and recite the incantation:
Transform and refine the five spirits, solidify bones and generate life. Mysterious light flows with flames, swiftly flying Fire Essence. Three cycles and seven turns, my Dao becomes luminous. Subtle contemplation and profound visualization reveal and inspect the hidden numinous. Scatter light to the ends of heaven, brightly illuminating the Purple Court.

When finished, swallow the qi three times and stop.

This is the method of fire refinement and bodily transformation. If one constantly contemplates and earnestly recites it, practicing for seven years, flowing lightning-like light will emerge from the eyes. Inscribing talismans upon the five centers, one may enter fire without burning, exhale qi to form smoke, and in winter enter water without feeling cold. One may command the Six Jia, revolve the Celestial Pass, ride clouds and ascend through the void, and ascend to the dawn in broad daylight.

The fourth transformation involves floating and sinking with qi, refining the body into water, with the Nine Rivers as companions. Drawing in qi forms waves, exhaling qi forms currents. One may command and summon dragons, employ the Water Lords, and roam the depths of ten-thousand-fathom abysses. If you can practice this, you may ascend to the heavens without ceasing.

Whenever cultivating this method, choose the first, third, ninth, eighteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the lunar month—five days in total—when the Nine Rivers Emperor of Grand Yin is feasting in the Bright Valley of Yang and playing with Mysterious Essence during the gathering.

On those days, at midnight, enter your chamber, burn incense, face north, and close your eyes in meditation. Visualize the Nine Rivers Emperor, surnamed Xiao, named Feng Ming, wearing a "Roaming Heaven Jade Essence" crown, clad in a five-colored embroidered robe. In his left hand, he holds a golden bell; in his right, a jade pendant. He governs the Upper Palace of Clear Water in the Bright Valley of Fusang, seated upon a golden bed and jade couch within five-colored curtains, the interior and exterior radiant with light. Twenty-four jade maidens attend him, and the paths of the sun and moon weave through his court.

Focus your thoughts clearly. After a moment, visualize the Nine Rivers Emperor holding the Precious Talisman of the Nine Sources of the Life River, entering your body and residing in the Cinnabar Field Palace below your navel.

Visualize the Azure Dragon of the East, circulating the green waves of the Eastern Limit; the White Dragon of the West, circulating the pure and clear sources of the Western Sea; the Crimson Dragon of the South, circulating the ten-thousand-fathom crimson surges of the Southern Sea; the Black Dragon of the North, circulating the dark yin extreme currents of the Northern Sea; and the Yellow Dragon of the Center, circulating the yellow qi, yang essence, and mysterious infusion of the Five-Colored Jade Mushroom waters. Together, they come to refine and irrigate your body.

When you feel a slight chill, call three times to the Nine Rivers Emperor Feng Ming, asking him to govern long within your Cinnabar Field and command the dragons to circulate water and refine your body.

Then ingest the Precious Talisman of the Nine Sources of the Life River, click your teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation while looking up:
Five Divine Dragons, draw from the four seas. Five Mushroom Grand Springs refine my form. My form transformed, I walk the water’s source, sink into the dark waves of the boundless depths. The Nine Rivers open the path, dragons lead the way. Twelve River Earls all guard my body, preventing specters from falsely opposing my true self.

When finished, turn your head to the north, lie straight on your back, close your eyes in meditation, and visualize your body riding the five-colored dragons into the Western Sea. Wade through the waters and walk the rivers as if on a road, riding swift waves without difficulty. Roam beneath the deep waters, freely circling, always keeping the Emperor before your eyes.

When the journey is complete and you return, rise and draw in the nine qi of the nine directions of the East, the nine qi of the South, the nine qi of the West, the nine qi of the North, and the nine qi of the Center, swallowing them all. Rub your palms until warm, wipe your face eighteen times, then recite while looking up:
Three Rivers and Four Seas govern the Nine Rivers. Long waves stretch ten thousand miles, deep abysses without end. Divine perfected ones roam, controlling and riding the five dragons. River Earls and Water Emperors build bridges for me. Whales and leviathans clear the path, specters perish. Jade maidens of the Clear River support and escort me.

When finished, swallow the five qi and stop.

This is the method of water refinement and bodily transformation. Practicing for five years, one may draw on the ground to form rivers, spit to create abysses, enter the sea floor, whistle to command dragons, ride waves and currents at will, employ water officials, and have River Earls attend and welcome. Riding clouds to ascend, one may mount the great void.

The fifth transformation involves transforming the body into a dragon, riding and commanding the Five Stars, refining and altering one’s form, ascending on clouds to feast in the radiant light, and mounting the Mysterious Palace.

To cultivate this method, enter your chamber at noon, face south, and close your eyes in meditation. Visualize Jupiter to your left, Venus to your right, Mars before you, Mercury behind you, and Saturn above your head, the Five Stars coiling around your body.

After a moment, Jupiter transforms into blue qi, Venus into white qi, Mars into red qi, Mercury into black qi, and Saturn into yellow qi. The five qi surge and transform into five-colored clouds, crowning and covering the chamber.

Perceiving myself seated amidst the cloud-qi, I draw in blue qi with eighteen breaths from the left, white qi with twelve breaths from the right, red qi with sixteen breaths from the front, black qi with ten breaths from behind, and yellow qi with twelve breaths from above. Feeling my body suffused with warmth, I click my teeth thirty-two times and call out, facing upward:

"Eastern Jupiter Star Sovereign, whose taboo name is Zheng Lan and style is Qing Ning;
Southern Mars Star Sovereign, whose taboo name is Bao Rong and style is Fei Yun;
Western Venus Star Sovereign, whose taboo name is Wei Ting and style is San Rong;
Northern Mercury Star Sovereign, whose taboo name is Hua Ping and style is Xuan Luo;
Central Saturn Star Sovereign, whose taboo name is Liao Ling and style is Zhen Xun.
Five Star Perfected Sovereigns, together you ride the five-colored cloud-palanquin of the Mysterious Chariot, descending into my body, streaming your essence to infuse me, nourishing my dragon-saliva, feasting in Great Harmony. My embryonic breathing arises naturally, my dragon-spirit stirs my transformed body, and I ascend in radiance to the Mysterious Palace."

When finished, I ingest the talisman for dragon-embryo essence-preservation, then lie down with my head to the east, stretching my four limbs upward. Closing my eyes, I visualize the five-colored clouds shading me above, imagining my body transforming into a green dragon, slowly rising with the clouds, roaming the Five Peaks, ascending to the Three Clarities. In but a moment, I return to my bed. Concluding, I swiftly rub my palms until warm, wiping my face twenty-one times, shaking my body twenty-one times, and recite the incantation:

"Five spirits return and transform, radiant ascent in flight,
Roaming the Five Peaks, ascending to the Supreme Microcosm,
Circling heaven and earth, attaining the Dao and returning,
Eternally preserving the natural, undiminished for ten thousand kalpas."

When finished, I swallow qi twenty-one times and stop. Practicing thus for five years without missing a day, the divine dragon will descend and appear, granting all desires, transforming into a dragon-body. This is the supreme method of transformation, the Purple Dawn’s Wondrous Perfection—secretly revered and practiced, one ascends at dawn.

The sixth transformation involves the Dao of moving from existence into non-existence, the method of dissolving form, vanishing, and flowing with radiance. On each day of the six *wu* cyclical signs, enter your chamber facing south, close your eyes in meditation, and visualize your left eye as a shooting star and your right eye as swift lightning, their luminous essence blazing, streaming with dazzling brilliance in the dark. Visualize within the light a perfected person, nine inches tall, wearing a Heaven-Piercing Radiant Jade Crown, clad in a five-colored, flowing yellow cloud-garment. His surname is Duan, taboo name Liu Lan, holding in his left hand the Spirit-Tiger Whip Script and in his right the Talisman of Seven Dissolutions for Form-Transformation—this is the Lad of Non-Florescence.

Born within the streaming light, he bestows the Mysterious Talisman upon my body. I then click my teeth thirty-six times and invoke:

"Streaming light swiftly shifts, blazing with celestial might,
Five forms dissolve and transform, seven radiant scenes take flight,
Exiting existence, entering non-existence, ascending to the Purple Tenuity,
Attaining union with the Three Dawns, eternally preserving luminous splendor."

When finished, I ingest the Talisman of Seven Dissolutions for Form-Transformation to release root-bound stagnation. Then, lying with my head to the south and eyes closed, I visualize my body within the streaming light, moving swiftly with its flow. Feeling my body light and buoyant, as if ascending and flying, in but a moment the light of the shooting star and swift lightning enters my body, its brilliance resplendent, my body suffused with warmth. I visualize the perfected person returning to my Crimson Palace and call thrice:

"Lad of Non-Florescence, Duan Liu Lan, dissolve my form and vanish me,
Following the light’s flow and radiance, my form changes with the qi, my bones scatter with the light."

Then, rubbing my hands, I wipe my eyes and face thirty-six times and invoke, facing upward:

"Transforming form, dispersing qi, dividing shadow into light,
Light races ten thousand leagues, form and shadow both concealed,
Two qi ride one another, streaming through the eight wilds,
Attaining the Mysterious Chariot, ascending to the Imperial Hall."

When finished, I swallow qi thirty-six times and stop. This is the Dao of dissolution and transformation, practiced by the Thearch-Lord. Having attained the Perfected Thearch, it is a treasure beyond ten thousand gold—guard it well and do not transmit it lightly. Cultivating this for seven years, one’s body transforms into seventy-two lights, streaming with purple essence, illuminating within and without, capable of myriad transformations without limit—able to conceal, able to manifest, able to see, able to hide. Attaining this method, one ascends as a Perfected Sovereign.

The seventh transformation is the utmost essence: the body unbound, empty and cavernous, entwined with the Seven Stars, summoning wind and descending clouds; whistling and commanding the host of spirits, exhaling and inhaling the Mysterious Mushroom, refining form and altering appearance, exchanging withered for radiant hue, regenerating decayed teeth, containing the Perfected within and emitting it, reverting to infancy after ten thousand years, revolving through the Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent—only then does one ascend to the Jade Clarity. If one seeks this, meditate deeply in seclusion, accumulating resonance until the spirit descends and the Dao manifests of itself.

To cultivate this transformation, perform it thrice monthly on the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first days—these are the days of the seven transformations, the times of the Purple Dawn’s seven refinements. On each of these days at noon and midnight, enter your chamber and first recite the Chapter of Seven Revolutions. When finished, face north and visualize the hidden taboo names of the Nine Perfected Sovereigns and Inner Consorts of the Northern Dipper:

First Star Sovereign, who transforms and conceals the primordial, Inner Consort: named Tai Yi Fa Tan, styled Qian Zheng;
Second Star Sovereign, who preserves the embryo and transforms form, Inner Concubine: named Tai Yi San Peng, styled Luo Zhu Ying;
Third Star Sovereign, Mistress of the Six Vanishings and Seven Stars, Upper Prime Elixir Mother: named Tai Yi Yun Yi, styled Shuang Zhao;
Fourth Star Sovereign, who conceals radiance and hides light, Middle Prime Inner Consort: named Tai Yi Qi Lie, styled Qiu Shan Ying;
Fifth Star Sovereign, who transforms body and alters radiance, Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center: named Tai Yi Yu Shu, styled Qiu Lan;
Sixth Star Sovereign, who conceals traces and disperses images, Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center: named Tai Yi Qi Jing, styled Bao Ding Ling;
Seventh Star Sovereign, who divides radiance into myriad forms, Maiden of the Dipper’s Center: named Tai Yi Yu Mo, styled Tian Fan Shu;
Eighth Sovereign, who transforms sun, moon, water, and fire, High Thearch’s Left Consort of the Dipper’s Center: named Tai Yi Qi Zhu, styled Luo Mao Hua;

Ninth Sovereign, who transforms metals, stones, mountains, and rivers, High Thearch’s Right Consort of the Dipper’s Center: named Tai Yi Ai Tiao, styled Yun Jing Xuan.

The nine consorts’ inner radiance blazes resplendent, shining brilliantly upon the northern quarter. Then they invoke, saying:
“Mysterious Dipper Divine Thearch, nine perfected inner consorts,
Streaming essence descends to pour, refining and irrigating my body.
Transforming form through seven cycles, ascending to the Dipper’s stars,
Refining the embryo and transmuting essence, inwardly manifesting as Golden Immortals.”

When finished, ingest the Seven Primes’ Radiant Jade Talisman. Lie with head to the north, close the eyes, and visualize one’s body ascending into the Dipper’s central canopy, revolving with the Dipper’s motion and traversing the four directions. Envision the Three Terraces Perfected within the Dipper, their forms two inches and four fen in height, surnamed Hui Yuan, named Hui Ling, wearing vermilion caps and crimson robes, bestowing the Seven Primes’ Radiant Jade Talisman. Upon awakening, having ingested the talisman, one naturally ascends in flight, returning to the bed. Rise facing north, knock the teeth seven times, and thrice call upon the Dipper’s Perfected Hui Ling. Then raise the head and invoke, saying:
“Tai Yi’s nine maidens, scattering forms upon the Mysterious Vault,
Divine radiance revolves and shines, numinous winds emit blossoms.
Left hand grasps the Seven Essences, right hand steers the flying auroras,
Flowing bells undergo nine transformations, ten evolutions and seven songs.
Dividing form into thousands, spitting upon the earth to form rivers—
Whatever is wished or sought, let there be no hardship.
The numinous scripture cycles sevenfold, its might subduing heavenly demons.
Those who comply and revere shall become immortals; those who oppose the Dao shall perish.”

When finished, swallow qi thirty-four times and stop.

This is the Way of the Seven Cycles of the Divine Continent, the method of myriad transformations of radiance, the jade formula for refining form and transmuting into immortals. Practicing it for nine years, the nine consorts feast upon radiance, together ascending into flight. The body emits wondrous light, the face reflects a golden countenance, the Seven Stars entwine the body, and one rides the clouds to ascend at dawn.

The Seven Cycles of Transformation are the Way of the Supreme Thearch of Purple Dawn, who first studied the jade-perfected refining and transforming Dao. The Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother bestowed upon him the scripture of the Seven Cycles of Radiance Transformation, untying knots and releasing obstructions, dispersing the Seven Mysteries, enabling the refinement of form and alteration of body to ascend to the Jade Palace. Through profound cultivation and accumulated resonance with the Primordial Heaven, he attained the rank of Supreme Thearch and received the title Purple Dawn. This Way is lofty and wondrous; it must not be recklessly transmitted. To carelessly divulge this treasure text brings calamity upon one’s ancestors and oneself, subjecting them to ten sufferings and eight poisons, with no deliverance for ten thousand kalpas. Those of destined bone who obtain this divine scripture, keeping it secret and practicing it, shall attain perfection in due time.

**First: Cloud Essence Jade Radiance Flying Mystery Life Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in vermilion on blue paper and ingesting it; write in vermilion on blue silk and wear it. The essence of the Five Auroras enables knowledge of the Upper Clarity’s Golden Flower of the Five Auroras. Practicing it for seven years, one shares the radiance of the luminous net.

**Second: Yin-Yang Jade Radiance Opening Brilliance Numinous Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in vermilion on blue paper and ingesting it; write in vermilion on blue silk and wear it. This is the essence of the sun and moon’s two radiant forms, enabling knowledge of the two radiant forms’ essence, concealing radiance and hiding form. Practicing it for eighteen years, one ascends to the Purple Court.

**Third: Radiance-Transforming Illuminating Spirit Seven Cycles Refining Essence Jade Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in blue on white paper and ingesting it; write in blue on white silk and wear it. This is the essence of the Great Yang, enabling knowledge of its transformations, refining the body and altering form, radiance and qi penetrating emptiness, equal to fire in brilliance. Practicing it for seven years, one ascends to the Imperial Court.

**Fourth: Life River Nine Sources Treasure Chapter Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in ink on white paper and ingesting it; write in ink on white silk and wear it. This is the qi of the Vast Waves’ Jade Essence, enabling knowledge of the Nine Rivers’ inner names, transforming and dividing form, ascending to roam the Nine Sources, descending to sink into the water spirits. Practicing it for five years, ten thousand transformations are immediately accomplished.

**Fifth: Dragon Embryo Preserving Essence Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in yellow on white paper and ingesting it; write in yellow on white silk and wear it. This is the qi of the Nine Transformations of Dragon Essence, enabling knowledge of the Dragon Embryo, transforming radiance and ascending cliffs, ascending to roam the Nine Mysteries, descending to sport at the Nine Doubts. Practicing it for five years, one remains undiminished through kalpas.

**Sixth: Dissolving Form Seven Cycles Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in blue on yellow paper and ingesting it; write in blue on yellow silk and wear it. This is the essence of the primordial coagulation of thunder and lightning. This Way is supremely wondrous, dividing shadows and dispersing form, streaming light into ten thousand transformations, merging with the Perfected in darkness.

**Seventh: Seven Primes Radiant Jade Talisman**
Perform the ritual by writing in vermilion on blue paper and ingesting it; write in vermilion on blue silk and wear it. This is the essence of the Seven Stars, enabling transformations, concealment, and ascension to the Jade Court of Radiance.

The above seven transformation talismans were bestowed upon the Supreme Thearch of Purple Dawn by the Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother, comprising the Way of transforming radiance and refining form, a secret of the Great Perfected and a treasure of the Nine Heavens. Through their cultivation, the Purple Dawn Lord attained the exalted title of Imperial Thearch. This Way is revered and wondrous, the origin of all scriptures. When the seven cycles are complete, one’s celestial perfected nature becomes equal to the heavens. Without a body of golden bones and jade constitution, one may not partake in or hear of it. Only those whose mystical name is Dong Hua and whose green character is Shang Qing may behold this wondrous text and secretly practice it. In accordance with the Great Perfected’s regulations, one may receive three transmissions in seven thousand years; if a suitable person appears within seven hundred years, transmission may also be granted. The recipient must offer one catty of true pearls, thirty-two feet of green damask, and five taels of superior gold as a pledge to the Nine Heavens’ vow of secrecy. Coveting wealth and admiring the Dharma incurs the same sin as greed; lightly valuing treasures and receiving scriptures sincerely moves the Jade Thearch. Cinnabar is used to express resonance, and trust is used to clarify the heart. Without a sincere heart, why engage in superficial admiration? Such learning is like sinking into a ten-thousand-fathom abyss while hoping to climb the path of clouds—how distant it is! Lightly valuing wealth and revering the Dao, though the Dao may be secluded and silent, dark scrutiny will reveal it, leading to the steps of ascending the heights and attaining the Perfected through proper means. This text is now compiled and transmitted to those destined for immortality; it is not bestowed upon the mediocre. To carelessly divulge this treasure text and expose it to the Upper Perfected brings retribution upon one’s seven generations of ancestors and parents, who are consigned to the offices of ghostly officials, made to transport the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Night. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn outside the human realm, their bodies subjected to the tortures of wind and blades. The scripture is naturally lost, and immortality is utterly unattainable.

Let the recipient guard it in secrecy and reverence. All the three hundred scrolls of the Supreme Clarity’s precious scriptures, the nine thousand chapters of jade instructions, and the seven thousand sections of talismanic diagrams originate from the Most High Jade Emperor of the Primordial Beginning, who received the natural writ and the Dao of remote antiquity. Should a practitioner obtain even the titles of these texts, they shall ascend at once to the rank of Perfected Sovereign. The Dao is concealed in the Nine Heavens above, within the Palace of Great Existence, where the jade texts are transmitted and entrusted to the Supreme Minister, the Azure Lad of the Blue Palace. Sealed within the Jade Flower Azure Palace, they remained until the first year of the Yuanjing era, when a complete compilation was made and sealed within the Western City Mountain. According to the old statutes, these texts were transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Yet after the Six Heavens were abolished and the Three Ways were rectified, the cosmic reckoning hastened, and the Great Dao was destined to spread. The statutes were thus revised to permit transmission every seven thousand years. If within seven hundred years there appears one of utmost sincerity, whose bones and countenance accord with the mysterious, whose name is recorded in the registers of Supreme Clarity, they may receive the texts in accordance with the covenant.

One who obtains these scriptures and succeeds in becoming a Perfected may proceed through the practices in proper order; nothing in principle will be lacking, and nothing in the Dao will fail to be accomplished. When qi is full and the Dao complete, one ascends at dawn in broad daylight. The Great Emperor commanded the Solar Valley Divine King of Fusang to compile thirty-one independent scrolls of instructions, which encompass the movements of Heaven and Earth, the Jade Radiance of the Yellow Court, the regulation of the five viscera, and the free flow of the spirit gates. Reciting them ten thousand times also enables one to soar aloft.

All who undertake this study must first receive the luminous statutes, expiate their transgressions, and redeem their faults, thereby dissolving the seven mysteries and extinguishing their sins in the Nine Yin. Blessings then arise in Supreme Clarity, after which one may present a memorial on golden tablets and jade slips to inscribe their name in the Azure Palace. They shall then receive the liberation of the Seven Primes, the Flowing Gold Fire Bells, the Golden Perfection Jade Radiance Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters, the authoritative methods of the Six Heavens and Three Heavens, and the *Scripture for Subduing Demons*.

Next come the Nine Perfected and Eight Ways’ numinous books of purple writ, which enable the ingestion of sun and moon and the summoning of clouds and rosy dawn. There are the forty-four ranks of the Yellow Plain’s standards, the five-phase soul-summoning incantations of the Curved Silk, the strategies for riding the void and steering the Purple Passage of Flaming Light, the *Feathered Scripture of Flight* and the *Seven Primes’ Treading Steps*, the twenty-seven plain words for invoking the five directions, the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence that illumine sun, moon, and caverns, the Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles that blend the Two Radiant Ones, the Three Primes’ jade tallies that secure the treasure of the spirit, and the seven transformations and eight mutations of the Divine Continent’s *Seven Revolutions and Seven Changes Dancing Heaven Scripture*, which harmonize Heaven and Earth and synchronize day and night.

Only then may one recite the thirty-nine chapters of the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, deliver one’s seven ancestors, and be reborn in the Southern Palace. There are the *Single Jade Tally and Five Elders’ Precious Scripture*, the *Golden Flower Jade Chamber* where the Three Primes are concealed and courted, the *Wondrous Scripture of Great Existence and Cavern Mystery Plain Numinosity*, the *Five Registers’ Treasure Spirit of the Concealed Elixir*, and the *Three Marvels’ Precious Writ*. Reciting these ten thousand times enables ascent to the Mystery, along with the ingestion of the *Numinous Flight*, the recording of one’s form in the *Hidden Radiance*, the traversal of the Three Celestial Passes through the shifting of the Seven Stars, the Eight Arts of Concealment and the Elixir Radiance’s Dao Essence, the seventy-two transformations and myriad transmutations that are instantly accomplished, and the fusion with the Imperial Unity and the birth of the Five Spirit Embryos.

When all scriptures are practiced to completion, the Dao is full and qi abundant; above and below mutually sustain one another, and great and small are equally numinous. Entering the chamber to fast and meditate, one’s profound thoughts arise, and the Perfected Spirits descend in response. The Three Primes visit the chamber, but if one’s steps falter or retreat, spirit disperses and qi scatters. To practice in an empty body alone, like a soul without form, or to covet fulfillment without following the root, to carelessly reveal the Three Treasures and shake the Nine Heavens—such acts are seized by the Three Offices, and sins are bound in the Four Luminaries. Within three years, one’s body is consigned to the offices of ghostly officials. Should one fail to resent one’s own faults and instead blame the Dao and its scriptures, not the Dao betraying the person but the person betraying themselves.

Those who earnestly study and receive the precious texts must follow the statutes and proceed in order. There is nothing that will not respond, nothing in principle that will not be perfected, no Dao that will not descend, no form that will not become immortal. When the Dao is complete after ten thousand recitations, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight. The three hundred chapters of the supreme scriptures are each bestowed upon the Perfected according to their capacity; not all are fully provided. Later diligent learners cannot equal the practices of the Great Perfected. The world is filled with impure qi, and the correct qi is obscured, hence the study of the Dao proceeds by sequence and rank.

If one practices the thirty-one scrolls compiled by the Great Emperor and completes the Dao, one may then pursue what one desires. Beginners must not leap directly to their aspirations, lest they violate the luminous statutes, for the consequences are severe. Beware and take heed.

The Lesser Existence Heavenly King states: One who practices the thirty-one scrolls in proper order, with the cinnabar purity ascending to the heights, shall be visited by the Great Emperor, who will dispatch the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate to further instruct them in the postures and protocols of the various scriptures. Those who diligently and painstakingly cultivate without lapse shall be able to soar and wander in the Jade Capital.

All who receive the supreme scriptures must guard their speech and be cautious in their words. They must not turn their backs on one to face another, nor discuss the scriptures’ contents, thereby confusing the Heavenly Perfected. To reveal them to the world, slander fellow practitioners, falsely claim the names of the worthy, belittle those more advanced, deceive the numinous powers, attack teachers and friends, plot rebellion, or claim to possess the wondrous completeness of the cavern scriptures—such acts are seized by the Four Offices and reported to the Great Emperor. One’s seven generations of ancestors and parents are bound to the offices of ghostly officials, eternally confined to the earth prisons, their bodies subjected to the tortures of wind and blades. They shall never attain immortality. Let all practitioners beware.

The statutes of the Four Poles state: One who does not receive the scriptures but steals the Heavenly Treasures, or receives them without covenant or faith, spurns the Heavenly Dao. If one obtains scriptures through karmic conditions but there is no master in the world, one may proceed according to the statutes, bearing a pledge to a secluded peak to receive them in secret. If a master exists, one must visit them to receive the covenant and transmission. To obtain scriptures without receiving the covenant, to practice recklessly, offend the numinous powers, or idly discuss the scriptures’ titles with the uninitiated—such acts incur severe consequences. They are seized by the officials of the Four Poles and Four Offices, and one’s seven generations of ancestors and parents are consigned to the endless labor of filling the River of Night.
