**The Seven Primes Summoning Demons and Subduing the Six Heavens Spirit Incantation Scripture**

At that time, the Dao Lord addressed the thirty-six Heavenly Spirit Kings, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, the Great Spirits of the Wastelands, the Five Lakes Great Generals, the Guardians of the Numinous, the Flying Dragon Direct Riders, the Lords of the Three and Five, the Five Venerable Thearchs, and the Primal King Heavenly Perfected. He declared: "When I formerly expounded this scripture for all sentient beings, the demonic officials trembled, and the earthly spirits and gods all prostrated to listen. Each heard my command and decree, their transgressions pardoned, their sins absolved. Returning to a single mind, they all generated good thoughts.

From this day forward, wherever a Daoist saves others, I shall assist in driving away afflictions, slaying demons to cure illness, aiding the celestial orthodox *qi*, and annihilating all spirits. Summon them, and they shall arrive at once."

**The Seven Perfected Summoning Heavenly Perfected and Subduing Demons Chapter**

The Dao spoke: "In former times, I drove away evil and harm for the gods and humans, extinguishing wickedness and eliminating misfortune. If, after the Three Dragons, a Daoist can perform these meritorious deeds within this Dharma, then in regions beset by calamity, they shall establish the Altar of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes, light lamps, and perform the Daoist rites. They shall summon the Lords of the Three and Five and the spirits of the Primal *Qi*, manifesting awe-inspiring power to extinguish evil and sever the demonic hosts. All sentient beings shall have their disasters dispelled, their adversities transcended, and their years prolonged without end."

The Numinous Official Heavenly Worthy summoned the Great Demon King of the North, decreeing to all spirits and demons: "From this day forward, you shall assist Daoists in performing rituals, slaying demons and executing the wicked, so that the living may attain peace. Hasten, as the law commands!"

**The Seven Perfected Commanding the Summoning of the Five Thunder Spirit Soldiers to Subdue Demons Chapter**

The Seven Perfected declared: "In former times, I expounded the *Divine Incantation Wondrous Scripture* for sentient beings to extinguish sins and eliminate misfortune, suppressing and subduing demonic and perverse forces, aiding Heaven and assisting transformation. If a Daoist, with single-minded focus, establishes a ritual arena, lights lamps, and performs the Daoist rites, using talismans to suppress and bind, pursuing and capturing spirits and demons, I shall summon the Five Thunder Spirit Soldiers—countless legions of ten thousand myriad riders—to descend upon the ritual arena, annihilating demonic specters and severing venomous plagues and pestilential spirits. I shall summon them to appear before me."

"We invoke the Eastern Great Cloud Thunder Fire Bell Spirit Soldiers, the Nine Myriad Myriad Riders of the Wood Essence Officials, leading the spirits of Horn and Neck, treading the clouds of the Nine *Qi*, wielding blades and brandishing swords, descending upon the ritual arena to execute and smite the pestilential *qi* demon soldiers of Liu Yuanda, who spread green sickness. Swiftly gather their poisonous *qi* to give life to the people and assist the Dao in its transformative work. Hasten, as the law commands!"

"We invoke the Southern Great Cloud Thunder Fire Bell Spirit Soldiers, the Three Myriad Myriad Riders of the Fire Essence Officials, leading the spirits of Well and Ghost, treading the clouds of the Three *Qi*, wielding blades and brandishing swords, descending upon the ritual arena to execute and sever the pestilential *qi* demon soldiers of Zhang Yuanbo, who spread red poisonous plagues. Swiftly gather their poisonous *qi* to give life to the people and assist the Dao in its transformative work. Hasten, as the law commands!"

"We invoke the Western Great Cloud Thunder Fire Bell Spirit Soldiers, the Seven Myriad Myriad Riders, the Great Spirits of the Metal Essence leading the mighty soldiers of Straddling and Bond, treading the clouds of the Seven *Qi*, wielding blades and brandishing swords, descending upon the ritual arena to capture and restrain the demonic specters of the Five Directions. Zhao Gongming’s pestilential poison demons shall flee a thousand *li*, their poison gathered and restrained to give life to the people and assist the governance of the Dao. Hasten, as the law commands!"

"We invoke the Northern Great Cloud Thunder Fire Bell Spirit Soldiers, the Five Myriad Myriad Riders, the Great Spirits of the Water Essence leading the spirit soldiers of Dipper and Ox, treading the clouds of the Five *Qi*, overturning heaven and earth, descending upon the ritual arena to gather and execute the pestilential poison demons of Zhong Shiji. Swiftly depart ten thousand *li*, all subdued and annihilated. Hasten, as the law commands!"

"We invoke the Central Great Cloud Thunder Fire Bell Spirit Soldiers, the Twelve Myriad Riders, the Earth Thearch Spirit Talismans leading the mighty soldiers of the Four Directions, treading the clouds of the Yellow *Qi*, wielding blades and brandishing swords, descending upon the ritual arena to gather and execute the pestilential poison demons of Shi Wenye. Swiftly depart a thousand *li*, so that the people may live in peace and the land attain tranquility. Hasten, as the law commands!"

The Seven Perfected declared: "These Five Heavens each possess spirit soldiers in countless legions. When a ritual arena is established, their majestic radiance is instantly prepared. If there are those afflicted by illness, simply light the Seven Primes Lamps, visualize and regulate the breath, and envision the original master arriving from the direction of their affliction to suppress and subdue. All mad, perverse, demonic, and inauspicious *qi* shall spontaneously transform into blood."

"First, knock the teeth seven times, recite the Heavenly Peng Incantation one hundred and twenty times, and secretly visualize the true *qi* of the Seven Primes. Drive away the hundred poisons, dispel disasters, and summon blessings. Notify the Five Directions’ Great Cloud Thunder Talismans as follows:

1. The First Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a peachwood board one *chi* and nine *cun* long, mirrors the *Gen* Palace.
2. The Second Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a catalpa wood board one *chi* and three *cun* long, mirrors the *Xun* Palace.
3. The Third Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a paulownia wood board two *chi* long, mirrors the *Kan* Palace.
4. The Fourth Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a silverwood board one *chi* and five *cun* long, mirrors the *Dui* Palace.
5. The Fifth Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a peachwood board two *chi* long, mirrors the *Kun* Palace.
6. The Sixth Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a white poplar wood board three *chi* long, mirrors the *Qian* Palace.
7. The Seventh Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a peachwood board one *chi* and three *cun* long, mirrors the *Li* Palace.
8. The Eighth Prime Spirit Talisman, to be inscribed on a white poplar wood board one *chi* and seven *cun* long, mirrors the *Zhen* Palace.
9. The Ninth Prime Spirit Talisman, governing the Three Myriad Six Thousand Spirit *Qi*, to be inscribed on a peachwood board two *chi* long, mirrors the Central Palace."

The Seven Perfected declared: "These talismans emerged from Mount Fengdu. The Perfected who attained the Dao all summoned the Five Directions’ Cloud Thunder, the Tiger Rushing Soldiers, and the stellar spirits using these talismans. They captured the spirits and demons of the Five Directions, commanded the heavenly soldiers, stirred clouds and moved rain, and restrained evil demons. These talismans are concealed within the Cloud Cliffs of the Eight Heavens, harmonizing Heaven and pacifying Earth."

Should Daoist practitioners or those seeking immortality wish to receive these teachings, they must present offerings of silk, pledge their sincerity with gold and valuables, and transmit them with reverence—never recklessly bestowing them upon the undeserving or those burdened by past transgressions in the evil realms. If a Daoist of true lineage performs the rites according to the ordained liturgy, they may transmit these talismans beneath the stars at night. For those who receive them as disciples under a master’s guidance, adhering to the rituals with devotion and offering sacrifices to seek blessings, five silver plates inscribed in cinnabar should be used to consecrate afflicted households, banishing malevolent spirits and scattering the myriad specters in flight.

The Heavenly Emperor’s revealed talismans command and subdue pernicious influences. After a thousand days of cultivation, the practitioner shall be attended by divine beings—celestial immortals, transcendent beings, august immortals, feathered immortals, perfected ones, numinous beings, sages, and auspicious spirits—who will secretly aid the Daoist. Guard these sacred texts in concealment, transmitting them only to the worthy.

The five numinous talismans each command a million spirit soldiers and flying celestial ghost hosts as their guardians. Receiving these talismans from a master is as solemn as standing before the imperial throne.

The Seven Perfected summoned and subdued the demonic legions of the Six Caverns:

The Seven Perfected declared: "We, on behalf of the heavens, expound the Five Cloud Spirit Talismans of the Divine Perfected for self-protection, enabling flight through the Seven Primes and treading upon the Nine *Qi* of Primordial Essence. The Supreme August Highest Perfected’s Three Heavenly True Decree resides on the southern slope of Mount Fengdu, veiled by the Nine *Qi*. Should any Daoist in future generations encounter these talismans, they must, on their natal day, prepare forty *chi* of white silk, five fruits, fragrant oils, and a pledge of sincerity to swear an oath with their master. They shall then offer sacrifices to us, the Seven Prime Supreme August Nine Perfected, and receive the talismans. Store them in a brocade pouch, conceal them in a quiet chamber, and set up a high altar to pay homage morning and evening.

The Most High Northern Pole Venerable Deity, having petitioned the Supreme Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, shall attain the Five *Qi* suffusing the body, binding all demons. Myriad spirits shall pay homage, the Three Officials shall commend them, earth deities shall serve, and demonic hordes shall tremble in submission, none daring to disobey."

The incantation reads:
*"Mysterious Dipper, Primordial Essence,
Three Pure Ones radiant and bright.
Hosts of spirits open the Dao,
Sweeping away all misfortune.
Eight Mighties summon and command,
Seizing and slaying wayward spirits.
Prolonging years without end,
The receiver attains long life.
Divine *Qi* of the Four Darknesses,
Converge and restrain Mount Feng.
Bind and dispatch the Six Heavens—
Who dares delay?
Hide, vile and hideous ones!
Eight Directions’ mighty spirits,
All submit to my Perfection.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

The Seven Perfected say: Should there be in the world a Daoist who knows Our Divine Chart, they may wander in the company of the Hundred Spirits, tread the Net of Principles and ride the Chariot of Records, summoning and commanding the myriad numina. They shall attain the Dao, recover their true Dao-nature, and forever depart from the ghostly officials of Fengdu.

The Seven Perfected’s Net of Principles comprises nine Dao-paths. Treading the Net of Principles in the ritual arena, one faces north to ascend the Net of Principles above. A thousand gold pieces are left in concealment—this is not transmitted to the unworthy.

The Scripture of the Luminous Plain Maiden can summon the Hundred Demons to serve as guards; Daoists who carry it upon their person shall do so.

The Scripture of the Jade Maiden of Supreme Yin’s Engendering: Daoists who carry it shall enjoy long life and enduring vision, knowing the ways of ghosts and spirits.

The Scripture of the Jade Maiden of Vast Spirit: Daoists who ingest it shall be coeval with Heaven and Earth.

The Scripture of the Plain Maiden of Precious Life: Daoists who carry it shall have the myriad spirits pay homage, traversing the Three Realms.

The Scripture of the Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony: Daoists who ingest it shall wander the Five Marchmounts, with the myriad spirits bowing in their courtyard.

The Seven Perfected say: When I first beheld this Chart, demonic palaces trembled, mountains swallowed their mists, and the sun and moon shone brightly across the Three Realms. The demonic hordes turned eastward, divine soldiers wielded their halberds, six-tusked beasts brandished their whips, and shooting stars hung low over the Three Realms. The Black Mystery’s secret writ was arrayed upon the Starry Mechanism.

Later, those who study as Perfected Ones shall, in accordance with the statutes, establish the Great Rites, circulating through the Five Lakes and Seven Marshes, the Seven Temples and Twenty-Four Marchmounts.

Should any Daoist carry these, they must enclose them in a crimson pouch and, within a quiet chamber, transmit them to a worthy recipient once every thirty years—never to the unworthy. To transmit to one unfit is to ruin the true Dao, bringing calamity and suffering upon oneself. Guard your speech, seal your conduct, and walk the path without transgression; thus shall you behold the true Dao and be inscribed in name within the Jasper Palace.

The Seven Perfected say: Daoists of later generations, whether dwelling among men, in the marketplace, or in mountain valleys, who cultivate the true instructions and wander forth to teach and transform, healing the sick and offering expedient aid to all beings, must single-mindedly arouse compassion and widely practice the Dao-qi—then shall I assist them.

The Seven Perfected say: Should a Daoist wander through the lands and encounter the calamities of the Nine Nines and Hundred Sixes, they may, in accordance with Our statutes, establish the Seven Primordials’ lamp-images, perform the Dao, recite incantations, and submit memorials to beseech the eradication of disasters and the prolongation of years without end. Upon attaining the Dao, they may carry this Chart and image to traverse the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

The Seven Perfected say: Among the Three Realms, if there be a Daoist whose past karma aligns with the Dao and who beholds this Chart, they must wholeheartedly uphold and practice it as though standing before the imperial presence, proclaiming it within the Gate of Service.

The true images of the Upper Symbols are arrayed as follows.

The Scripture of the Seven Primordials’ Summons to Subdue the Demons of the Six Heavens concludes.
