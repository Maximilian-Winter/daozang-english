At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portals of the Jade Purity Sagely Realm’s Clear Tenuity Heavenly Palace, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Dawn Dao Lord of the Highest Purity True Realm’s Yu-Yu Heavenly Palace, the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue of the Supreme Lord Lao of the Great Vermilion Heavenly Palace of the Grand Purity Immortal Realm, the August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portals of the Supreme Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Culmen, the Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign of the Southern Culmen, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions—
the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Sovereign of the Eastern Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings of the Southern Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery and Utmost Limit of the Western Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Superior Jade Dawn of the Northern Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Ascended Immortals and Supreme Sages of the Northeast,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Life-Nurturing Destiny-Saving of the Southeast,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Void Sovereign of the Southwest,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Grand Florescence of the Northwest,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void Luminous Sovereign of the Upper Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign of the Cavern Dawn of the Lower Heaven—

spoke thus:

The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Perfected of the Eight Poles, the Three Officials of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars—all turn their gaze and radiate their illumination.

We humbly pray that the true forms of the Eight Directions may be entrusted to guard the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials, harmonizing the Three Realms and uniting the myriad beings. May the true form of the Great One transform into its original aspect, manifesting the eighty-one heavens and thirty-six earths.

Heads crowned with fiery forks, bodies riding fierce beasts, or mounted upon azure dragons, hurling fire for ten thousand leagues. The Supreme Lords of the Five Peaks, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, the Great General Perfected Warrior, the Heavenly Honored Tianpeng, the Black Killer, and the Heavenly Strategist—
with rakṣasas following behind and mighty warriors in procession,
they shake the world, topple mountains, and overturn rivers.
From the Void above to the Nether Darkness below,
the honored deities of Heaven and Earth, the Five Peaks, and the Four Waterways,
who play Mount Sumeru in their hands and bear Kunlun upon their heads,
command the Nine Palaces of Earth,
dispatching the mighty warriors to govern the celestial spirits.
The divine soldiers of the Six Dings, Six Jias, Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and Water Immortals—
three threes making nine, and a hundred million heavenly troops—
all receive the Jade Emperor’s decree and respond to the numinous power.
The demonic hordes are bound hand and foot, trembling in terror;
countless venomous dragons dare not resist, and ghosts are slain by the sword.

The Lords of the Sun and Moon, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper, the Nine Luminaries of the Heavenly Wheel, and the stellar deities of the annual cycles—
the Star Lords of Rāhu, Ketu, Wood Virtue, Water Virtue, Metal Virtue, Fire Virtue, Earth Virtue, Purple Qi, Moon Comet, Great Yang, and Great Yin.
The inner and outer lodges of the Celestial River, the Twenty-Eight Constellations—all are clearly enumerated, with the Heavenly Stem wielding the sword.

The Twelve Original Celestial Stems:
Born in *yin*, belonging to the Tiger—*Gongcao* Original Celestial Stem.
Born in *mao*, belonging to the Rabbit—*Taichong* Original Celestial Stem.
Born in *chen*, belonging to the Dragon—*Tiangang* Original Celestial Stem.

Born in *chou*, belonging to the Ox—*Daji* Original Celestial Stem.
The Twelve Earthly Branches and their corresponding creatures govern the Six Spirits of destiny.

Earth, Metal, Wood, Water, Fire—
Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire, Water—
Water, Earth, Fire, Metal, Wood—
Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, Metal—
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.

The Venerable Lord Lao said:
If there are good men and good women who uphold and recite the *True Scripture of the Grand Offering to All Heavens*, they shall be untouched by pestilence, spared from calamities, and their annual stellar deities, Rāhu, Ketu, and malevolent stars of Earth and Fire shall all be dissolved. They shall not suffer famine, nor fall into nets, nor encounter violent death, nor face the sword, nor endure fire, nor drown in water, nor meet venomous creatures, nor ingest poison.

If one has official or private matters and inadvertently enters secluded mountains, solitary hamlets, desolate gardens, dense forests, or dark and hidden places—where malevolent temples and shrines abound with ghosts and spirits, and noxious specters are plentiful—
at that time, sit in full lotus, raise the fists in reverence, and silently recite this scripture once. The assembly of sagely beings from all heavens shall gather to protect that person. Then, the Jade Talisman shall preserve their life, the Golden Elixir shall refine their form, and both form and spirit shall attain wondrous perfection, uniting with the Dao in truth. Their spirit shall not scatter, and all calamities shall vanish.

If a household is plagued by demonic influences, wild sorcery, spectral ailments, disasters of water and fire, the sword’s edge, misfortune, punishment, or any inauspicious events—upon hearing the name of this numinous scripture, all shall be dissolved. Receive it with faith and practice accordingly.
