The *Ritual of the Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register of the Supreme Clarity Grotto-Heavens* originates from the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Non-Ultimate, whose left governs the Nine Myriad, Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine Layers of True Qi of the Luminous Golden Perfected Jade Bureau; whose right accumulates the Eight Myriad, Eight Thousand, Eight Hundred and Eighty-Eight Layers of Yang True Essence Qi of the Jade Heavenly Perfected; whose center generates the Hundred Thousand Myriad Layers of Inexhaustible Wondrous Qi of the Golden Radiance Treasure Illumination Perfected; and whose governance extends to the Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Myriad, Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine Layers of Qi of the Supreme Scenery Clear Void Life-Spirit Wondrous Qi, led by the Perfected of the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens.

Your servant [Name], now presiding as the Highest Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor’s Overseer of the Thirty-Six Governances, and the General Controller of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Three Origins and Eight Poles of the Nine Heavens, the Four Symbols encompassing above and below, and the myriad spirits below—hereby universally proclaims to the boundless hosts of the Ten Directions, the divine officials of the infinite heavens, the Three Realms and Six Paths, and all the assemblies of spirits and gods:

Your servant, having received the Highest Supreme Primordial Mysterious Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five Nine Heavens Primordial Register, today, in accordance with the Dharma, proclaims and transmits it to the heavenly beings of the Ten Directions. Now, there is a man/woman of such-and-such a name, of cinnabar essence and pure disposition, whose heart yearns for the clarity of the Perfected. Having submitted a petition and sworn an oath, they seek to receive the Primordial Register of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five.

Accordingly, in accordance with the statutes, the titles of Heavenly Vajra Generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals are conferred—all in strict adherence to the Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Primordial Most High, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Unsurpassed Perfected, the Great Sage of the Ten Directions, the Most High Dao Lord, the Three Heavens’ Most High Lord Lao, the Nine Heavens’ Most High Elder, the Unsurpassed Mysterious Supreme Jade Morning Lord, and the Golden Portal Jade Emperor.

Today, the Primordial Register is transmitted, and the generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five Nine Heavens Primordial Perfected are assigned, each according to their rank and position, to guard and stabilize the Three Origins—upper, middle, and lower—within the body of the recipient. They shall array the Golden Hall, Jade Palace, Five Cities, and celestial, feathered, chamber, divine, and phoenix regalia to encamp within the recipient’s form.

Turning left, Nine Hundred Million Myriad Layers shall guard the body; turning right, Nine Hundred Million Myriad Layers shall accompany all ingress and egress, journeying and roaming. The Heavenly Vajra shall govern the Ten Directions, summoning and commanding the celestial and terrestrial deities of the Eight Poles, the myriad spirits, the Five Marchmounts, famous mountains and great marshes, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji, the Four Watercourses, Nine Regions, village shrines, Nine Provinces’ talismanic temples, hamlet altars, and the void expanses—boundless, fathomless, without darkness or obscurity, without above or below, the clear void of the abyssal grottoes, and the watery palaces’ divine hosts—all shall heed the talismanic command and celestial governance.

Should the body be concealed or the form hidden, if malevolent spirits, evil ghosts, or cloud-roving hunters of the Six Heavens, along with spectral essences, demons, and *wangliang* seek to harm the recipient, the Heavenly Vajra shall unite in power, shaking heaven and earth, their awe-inspiring might sweeping all away. None shall dare to disobey. *Hasten as the Law of the Supreme Most High Jade Emperor commands!*

The document shall be inscribed with overlapping seams at both ends. On the first day of the [such-and-such] month in the year of the [such-and-such] Jupiter cycle, at the hour of *zi*, [so-and-so], a resident of [such-and-such] village, [such-and-such] township, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] commandery, of the humble servant [name], aged [such-and-such] years, hereby pledges sincerity of heart and invokes a solemn oath in the unseen realm.

Thereafter, the talismans shall all be inscribed in vermilion: the *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Primordial Mysterious Void Jade Capital Left Auxiliary Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Vajra*, the *Three-Five Great Might Transcendent Pacifier of Heaven Great General Who Governs the Eight Poles*. The High Merit Chariot-Rider Ge Haoling, styled Wenshi, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, supervising the military affairs of the Nine Heavens’ armies, soldiers, and marshals, commanding formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, arraying celestial plumes and boundless hosts, encircling the ten directions, encamping heaven and regulating earth, soaring through the Nine Principles. His awe-inspiring might shakes the cosmos, sweeping away the Six Heavens, warding off calamity and preserving the kalpa, dispelling disaster and extinguishing misfortune. He traverses heaven and earth, wielding the celestial pivot, discerning the patterns of fate, sustaining the Three Origins, stabilizing the Five Phases, governing the Three Realms. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person. At the Left Palace of Azure Radiance and Jade Towers, the Celestial Pivot’s Nine Passes, he eternally governs the movements of the Nine Heavens’ living spirits. From the depths of the Mysterious Radiance, his light merges with sun and moon to form a single brilliance, flowing luminosity flashing like lightning, illuminating and transforming one’s form. The Vajra-riding great officials, soldiers, marshals, and officers all guard and encircle one’s body in a hundred million myriad layers. When manifest, his divine efficacy fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Highest Nine Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one goes, he follows—traversing blades and fording waters, the Three Calamities and Nine Perils dare not oppose. The divine officials of the Three Realms escort and attend, ascending with one to the Imperial Court of the Golden Towers and Jade Emperor’s Celestial Throne. With Vajra strides, he eliminates celestial disasters, annihilates legions of malevolence, beheads evil spirits, dragons and tigers frolic, subjugating the unruly. The Vermilion Bird soars in grace, the Nine Demons crumble, the Dark Warrior patrols the void, and demonic essences are exposed. The General upholds the celestial patterns and assists the nation’s fortunes, governing calamities. The Nine Origins and Three Luminaries, the Seven Luminaries and Celestial Pivot, the Jade Balance of the Five Directions, and the arrayed stars of the Northern Dipper—one’s form, as the *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One*, the Left Auxiliary Three-Five, governs the Fourteen Lunar Lodges of the Eastern and Southern Quarters, the Yang Dipper, Yang Spirits, and Yang Qi, penetrating heaven and earth. He stabilizes the *Highest Supreme-One Life-Spirit Division* of ninety-nine myriad beings, governing the Liver Mansion’s *Primordial Upper Mysterious Elder Life-Spirit Division* of eighty-eight myriad beings, and the Heart Mansion’s peace, securing the Grotto-Heaven’s Left Palace in the two directions, overshadowing the Primordial Heaven. *Hasten! As the Primordial Supreme-One’s Ordinance commands.*

**Golden Armor, Vermilion Robes, Green Sash**

The *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Primordial Void Primordial Upper Capital Right Assistant Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Primordial Vajra Three-Five Vast Might Transcendent Heaven Great General Who Governs the Eight Directions*. The High Dawn Chariot-Rider Tang Wenchang, styled Jin Xuan, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, commanding the Three Armies’ soldiers, marshals, and officers in divine martial affairs. Leading formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through the void, arraying celestial clouds in boundless ranks, encircling the eight poles, inspecting heaven and regulating earth, governing the Three Principles. Soaring in flight, he shakes the cosmos, his wind-chariots traversing the heavens, his radiance blazing across the ten thousand directions. He captures demons and summons spirits, punishing malevolence and executing demons, severing inauspicious omens. Sustaining the Three Heavens’ destiny, now having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Right Palace of the Plain Heaven’s Seven Treasures and Golden Towers’ summit, eternally governing the movements of the Three Heavens’ life-spirits. Constantly illuminating the palace of sun and moon, his light descends to shine upon one’s form, encamping and guarding with celestial myriads in myriad layers. When manifest, his brilliance fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Supreme Three Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one roams—mountains, rivers, the four seas, the eight poles, the nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, and village deities, the true officials who infuse *qi*, all must receive the talisman and obey the command.

The *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Brahmā-King Void Capital Central Stabilizer Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Primordial Vajra Three-Five Pacifier of Heaven Upright Might Vast Transcendent Great General*. The Supervisor of the Ten Directions’ High Chariots, Martial Spirit Commander of the Armies Zhou Wendu, styled Jin Guang, stands three thousand *zhang* tall, commanding the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly armies, marshals, soldiers, and officers in divine martial and punitive affairs. Leading formations of *yi* of *yi* and *wan* of *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through heaven, arraying celestial plumes in boundless ranks, securing the Nine Origins, encamping heaven and wielding awe, shaking the cloud formations. He drives away the Six Heavens, inspects and subjugates the Northern Feng, governs the myriad spirits, wields the celestial soldiers’ halberds, and commands the Three Realms. He subjugates demonic grasses and hundredfold spirits, establishes the Ghost Emperor’s standards, severs and annihilates treachery and malevolence. Hearing deceit, he punishes; hearing demonic forces, he executes; hearing evil, he slays; hearing goodness, he protects; hearing rectitude, he elevates; hearing truth, he defends; hearing fortune, he guards; hearing misfortune, he dispels; hearing auspice, he preserves; hearing inauspice, he eliminates. Thus, he sustains the destiny of heaven and earth. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Three Origins, the *Great Tenuity Jade Mansion*’s Central August Palace, the Golden Towers’ Five Citadels, and the Nine Dawns’ Hall, eternally governing the movements of heaven and earth’s life-spirits, rectifying the Celestial Pivot. The sun to the left, the moon to the right, their flying radiance illuminates the void. Fire-armored soldiers form the vanguard, venomous weapons follow behind. To the left, martial warriors array in myriad layers of Azure Dragons; to the right, divine marshals stand as White Tigers of Heavenly Assault. The Vermilion Bird, spirit fowl, spits fire and howls wind. The Curved Array and Dark Warrior devour ghosts and malevolence. To the left, the *Transcendent Heaven Force-Soldiers* behead and capture treacherous demons; to the right, the *Vajra Force-Soldiers* swallow evil and consume ghosts. Flowing luminosity and blazing lightning—should any inauspicious force dare appear, when manifest, his awe-inspiring might sweeps away filth and dust, encamping heaven and regulating earth, filling the great void. When concealed, he rests in the profound stillness of the infinitesimal, establishing heaven and earth through divine efficacy. Now, he stabilizes one’s Three Origins. From heaven above and heaven below, earth above and earth below, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one travels—mountains, broad wilderness, rivers, four seas, eight poles, nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, village deities, and true officials who infuse *qi* must receive the talisman and obey the command. *Hasten! As the Primordial Supreme-One’s Ordinance commands.*

General, enlightened in principle, embodies the rectified *qi* of the Three Origins, aiding the nation and sustaining destiny, harmonizing heaven and earth’s cyclical movements. Through the four seasons and five phases, he transforms the Nine Heavens; through the Three Origins and Seven Luminaries, the jade pivot and celestial balance, all heavenly suns and moons, stellar lodges and Three Bonds, the Six Regulations arrayed—every radiant great spirit stands ranked above one’s form in the Supreme Primordial Celestial August Jade Purity Central August Upper Origin’s Upper Palace, governing the revolutions of the Three Origins and Nine Palaces, the Great One’s primordial essence and life-generating *qi*, penetrating origins and unifying beginnings. By law, he stabilizes the Upper Origin’s division of the Nine Heavens, the twelve hundred million humans, and presides over the Spleen Palace, foremost of the Supreme Primordial August Pure True Numinous Revolutions. *All as the Primordial August Supreme-One’s Ordinance commands.*

[Three-Five Tablet’s staff and seal inscriptions (originally missing)]

Conferred upon the ordination of the Three-Five Chapters, the ritual proceeds as follows:

Next, strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times.
Next, open the incense burner.

*Clear and Mysterious, Boundless and True, Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Qi, Ultimate Great Dao, Most High Lord Lao, with your attendant Fragrant Officials, Flying Immortals, Post-Relay Dragons, and Incense-Bearing Envoys; Flying Heavenly Dragons, the Five Thearchs’ Incense-Attendants, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—twenty-four each—emerge. Humbly I petition the Vacuous Primordial, Self-So, Primordial Honored Heavenly Worthy: as I now burn incense and present this memorial, conferring ordination in the ritual, may the Supreme Ten Directions’ True Living Qi descend into my body. May this petition ascend directly before the Ultimate Great Dao, the Perfect and True Jade Thearch’s throne.*

This done, bow twice.

Next, kneel before the incense table, summon the officials, present the memorial, and confer ordination.

Reverently summon from within my body the Five-Body Perfected Officials, the Three-Five Merit Archivists—two each; the Upper Primordial Nine Heavens’ Three-Five Primordial Life, Orthodox Unity Merit Archivists—two each; the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Ordination Life Archivists—two each; the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Disaster-Dispelling Dao-Conferring Archivists—two each; the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Register-Inspecting Archivists—two each; the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Yin-Yang Healing Archivists—two each; the Supreme Upper Primordial Nine Heavens’ Upper Numinous Flying Heaven White Tiger Memorial-Delivering Dragon-Riding Officials—two each.

From within my body, summon the Three-Five Heavenly Officials, Generals, and Clerks under my command; the multitude of Perfected Envoys; the Immortals’ Capital Direct Perfected Talisman Clerks; and the Immortals’ Capital Official Envoys—2,200 each. Arrayed in solemn attire with pendent tassels, each adorned with the Three-Five Heavens’ feathered regalia and phoenix ornaments, they form cloud ranks and encamp in the four directions and eight quarters to guard my left and right, front and rear. Streaming essence and flashing lightning, their radiance illumines the Great Void. Their majesty shakes Heaven and Earth, sweeping away inauspiciousness. They witness my memorial and the conferral of ordination.

Now, in [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] township, [X] hamlet, the male/female disciples, born in the year [X], aged [X] years, submit their petition to the Mysterious and True, wholeheartedly taking refuge in the Three Honored Ones. They seek to receive the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ True Forms, the Mysterious Talismans, the inscribed tablets, staffs, and contracts. Today, inscribe the celestial officials’ titles and ranks, and, in accordance with the method, sign the register.

If ascending for registration, state: “At such-and-such a time, ascend for registration.”
If conferring ordination, state: “At such-and-such a time, confer ordination.”

At such-and-such a time, they bow and invoke the Heavenly Officials of the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven to confer ordination. Now, with repeated memorials and petitions, they reverently address the Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Origin, the Most High Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal, the Supreme Perfected and Greatly Sagely Heavenly Worthy, and the True Officials of the Immortal Capital, summoning the Director of Conduct and the Envoys of All Offices. They humbly pray that the Merciful Perfected may descend to inspect and, with divine oversight, ordain them. All ritual matters shall proceed according to rank and order. Ordain that within their bodies be established officials and fortified palaces, encircling and safeguarding them—nine hundred million myriad layers to the left, nine hundred million myriad layers to the right—shielding their lives, celestial adornments, radiant majesty, and awe-inspiring might in the ten directions. The Three-Five Generals, mounted officers, heavenly officials, generals, and clerks, in their forms and shadows, unite with divine radiance, illuminating within and without, their flowing brilliance enhancing their dignity. Let the true officials of the lands they tread, the inspectors and summoned lords and clerks, jointly assist them. Rewards shall follow merit, and their pledges shall not be in vain. This petition ascends directly to the presence of the Boundless Dao, the Perfected Jade Emperor.

This done, bow twice.

Next, present the memorial, concluding with a firm declaration of its purpose.

The petitioner now commands the Three-Five Heavenly Officials, the multitude of Perfected, the Merit-Officials, generals, clerks, soldiers, envoys of all offices, the Flying Celestial White Tigers bearing the memorial, and the Dragon-Riding Immortal Clerks: “I have now issued the official proclamation and presented the memorial. The assembled Perfected shall each return, soaring through the void and riding the clouds, to resume their posts and guard their positions, arraying heaven and spreading earth in perfect order. The hundreds of thousands of myriad Heavenly Officials and Perfected within my body shall each return to their offices through the vermilion gates and wondrous portals.” This petition ascends to the presence of the Boundless Dao.

This done, bow twice.

Next, turn the ritual table, face north, and kneel lengthily. Summon the Heavenly Officials anew, then confer the Three-Five sealed tablets, inscribed boards, and staffs.

The petitioner now commands the Five Perfected Clerks within his body, the Three-Five Merit-Officials, the Left and Right True Officials and Envoys, the Three-Five Original Destiny Orthodox Unity Merit-Officials, the Upper Primordial Three-Five Destiny-Conferring Merit-Officials, the Three-Five Calamity-Dispelling and Dao-Conferring Merit-Officials, the Three-Five Ordination Merit-Officials, the Three-Five Record-Examining Merit-Officials, the Three-Five Yin-Yang and Disease-Treating Merit-Officials, the Three-Five Directors of All Offices, each with thirty-five officers, and the generals, soldiers, and officers, each numbering ninety hundred million myriad hosts. Summon the Three-Five Vajra Envoys, the Three-Five Primordial Vajra Envoys, the Three-Five Heavenly Vajra Envoys, the Three-Five Celestial Bodies of Sun, Moon, and Three Lights, the Seven Luminaries, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Lords and Clerks of the Five Dippers’ Mysterious Spirits, the Three-Five Lords and Clerks of the Encompassing Heavens, the Three-Five Lords and Clerks of Earth’s Governance, the Lords and Clerks of the Ten Directions’ Celestial Constellations, the Spirit-Consuming Lords, the Ghost-Consuming Lords, the Malevolence-Consuming Lords, the Poison-Consuming Lords, the Essence-Consuming Lords, the Ominous-Consuming Lords, the Qi-Consuming Lords, the Northern Passage Marshal, the Eastern Passage Marshal, the Southern Passage Marshal, the Western Passage Marshal, the Crimson Yang Vermilion Heaven Jiazi Directors of All Offices and seventy-two officers, the Yang Heaven Bingzi thirty-five officers, the Flowing Brilliance Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Arrayed Heaven Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Net-Spanning Heaven Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Heaven-Arraying Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Heaven-Governing and Earth-Ordering Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Three-Five Life-Generating Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Three Primordials’ Nine Heavens’ Primordial Vajra Lords and Clerks, the Three Qi Lords and Clerks, the Five Qi Lords and Clerks, the Nine Qi Lords and Clerks, the Twenty-Four Officers’ Lords and Clerks, the Yin-Yang and Water-Fire Lords and Clerks, the Upper Primordial Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens’ Primordial Yang Upper Palace Directors of All Offices, the Three-Five Directors of All Offices, the Divine Vajra Envoys, the Flying Celestial Mounted True Talisman Clerks, the Great One’s Mysterious Palace Ordination Immortal Capital Jade Clerks and Flying Feathered Cavalry, eighty-four myriad Vajra Lords, the renowned generals, Heavenly Officials, mounted soldiers, and officers, each numbering nine hundred million myriad hosts. Let them emerge, each arrayed in solemn attire, celestial adornments, and feathered regalia, filling heaven and earth, deploying in cloud formations, their awe-inspiring might pervading the ten directions. Let them stand in attendance in the empty courtyard, aligning with the eight extremities, governing heaven and earth, summoning the Three Officials, their flowing essence flashing like lightning, sweeping away inauspiciousness. Let the encampments to the left and right and on all four sides command the Five Peaks, the Three Rivers, the Four Waterways, the Huai, Ji, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers, and the true officials governing the lands of the Nine Provinces. Let them all register their qi, jointly oversee the covenant, and, in accordance with the method, lead and seal the inspection. Let them clearly array and confer the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ True Forms, the Mysterious Talismans, the inscribed tablets, staffs, and contracts. Let them securely establish the petitioner’s Three Primordials’ Passes and Palaces, the inner and outer Five Cities, each with nine thousand myriad layers, ensuring no errors in their encampment and defense. Let them unite with the multitude of Perfected. This petition ascends directly to the presence of the Boundless Dao, the Perfected Jade Emperor.

This done, bow twice.

Next, distribute the contract documents.

Today, by this single stroke, we divide and establish the One Method—Heaven’s One Method, Earth’s One Method, Humanity’s One Method—swearing before the Three-One of the Nine Heavens to covenant with the Nine Heavenly Parents. Here and now, pointing to Heaven and tracing upon Earth, we vow neither to betray the Three Honored Ones nor transgress the Three-One. From the moment this contract is divided, should we violate or betray this oath, should we show disrespect to our master or slight the Dao, then for seven generations across kalpas, we shall endure the trials of wind-knives and water-fires, forever forfeiting the radiant light.

This done, draw and divide the contract: the master retains the right half, the disciple the left, each fastened with a golden clasp. The contract is to be worn alongside the register for the same duration.

Next, transmit the Three-Five Talismans, True Forms, and Kalpa Scriptures. First, sound the Heavenly Drum thirty-five times. When finished, recite the incantation:

Vast and boundless is the Mysterious Heaven,
The Primordial Origin flows pure and clear.
In wondrous, empty motion,
The kalpa’s span is secured and firm.
The Primordial Beginning opens the true,
The Orthodox Dao streams forth in brightness.
Heaven is arrayed, Earth is ordered,
The ten directions tremble in awe.
Divine power summons and commands,
The myriad emperors submit in form.
Encompassing the Four Symbols,
Wind and fire dare not linger.
Might shakes the Six Heavens,
Heretical paths do not arise.
When the Mysterious Talisman’s decree arrives,
Call forth the rigid and command the soldiers.
Seize the deviant, behead the demonic,
The demonic realms are utterly pacified.
Molten gold and flashing lightning,
Mount Fengdu is shattered and overthrown.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Next, issue the inscribed tablet’s decree. First, sound the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times. When finished, recite the incantation:

Decree of the Upper Primordial,
Inspecting might across the ten directions.
Heaven and Earth obey the command,
The tablet summons the divine kings.
Officials of the Three Realms,
None fail to submit in form.
True officials of the Nine Lands,
Together with so-and-so, unite as one.
Traversing mountains, crossing seas,
Mountain spirits and water emperors
All come to escort and receive.
Proclaim to the Five Emperors,
Guard so-and-so’s kalpa-span.
The starry hosts of all heavens
Shall mutually assist and encamp.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Next, issue the staff’s decree. First, sound the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times. When finished, recite the incantation:

Mysterious radiance flows and shines,
Divine power of the Five Directions.
When the staff strikes Heaven, Heaven opens;
When the staff strikes Earth, Earth yields.
When the staff strikes mountains, spirits submit;
When the staff strikes waters, dragons descend.
When the staff strikes fire, fire is extinguished;
When the staff strikes spirits, spirits come forth.
When the staff strikes ghosts, ghosts fall;
When the staff strikes demons, demons perish.
Revolving through the ten directions,
The myriad spirits protect and uphold.
After the staff is worn,
Freely traverse the Five Constants.
Form and spirit are securely guarded,
Unscathed through ten thousand kalpas.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

Next, issue the decree for transmitting qi-water. First, sound the Heavenly Drum thirty-five times. Recite the incantation:

Supreme Azure Stream,
Triple qi generates flowing essence.
Nine Origins and Three-Five Spirits,
Five qi transform into divine cinnabar.
The Celestial River’s cinnabar waters surge forth,
Heavenly rigidity arrays the Mysterious Numinous.
Nine qi, moon-transformed, take flight,
Twenty-four spirits, each wielding might.
The myriad qi’s origin,
Majestic and towering, governed by the Three Rigidities.
Guard the Nine Subtleties’ numinous life,
Follow the water to secure the passes’ mechanism.
Array the spirits, protect the qi, and defend against the external.
Only those who endure kalpas shall eternally abide.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!

When finished, administer the water, and have the disciple spit it out in three mouthfuls.

The transmission complete, rise to a long kneel.

Next, the Inner Officials report the merits:

Minister So-and-so respectfully addresses the Boundless Dao, the Primordial Origin, the Most High and Perfectly True Great Sage Heavenly Worthy. The Five Perfected Gentlemen-Officials within this minister’s body, the Three-Five Merit Registrars, the Left and Right Perfected Officials, the Three Rigidities Lords-Officials, the various heavens’ sun and moon, the Three Luminaries and Seven Luminants, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Seven Perfected...

Each shall be elevated to a higher Perfected rank, their celestial titles exalted, their imperial stipends multiplied ten thousandfold, their merits equaling those of the Five Thearchs, all recorded on golden tablets. Once the merit rewards and promotions are conferred, let each return in their numinous chariots, arraying the celestial formations, soaring through the void and ascending the skies, to resume their posts in the Mysterious Palace, the Golden Hall and Jade Treasury, where they govern the Three Origins. Let their immortal ranks be augmented, and when summoned again in the future, let them emerge once more.

To So-and-so, whom this minister has transmitted the rites, grant the Upper Prime Grotto-Heaven’s Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ Perfected Forms, the Mysterious Talismans, the Divination Tablets, the Staffs, and the Contracts. From this day forward, may they wear and bear these always, eternally guarding and protecting them through eons and kalpas, forever as treasures of their person.

This minister petitions the memorial before the Primordial Ultimate Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Thearch. The report concludes. Bow twice.

Next, replenish the incense burner, then exit.

The Left and Right Incense Officials, the Flying Immortals and Post-Dragons, the mounted bearers of incense, the Flying Heavenly Dragon Riders—let them serve the numinous altar, where naturally arises golden radiance and precious luminosity, the mysterious reflection of jade’s brilliance, the essence of golden liquid. May So-and-so, who receives the Dao, enjoy felicity and blessings, moving freely throughout the world, receiving grace from the Ten Directions. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, attend the incense smoke and swiftly present this minister’s petition before the Primordial Ultimate Perfectly True Jade Thearch.

The report concludes. Then exit. Present the memorial text.

The Pure Primordial Ultimate Orthodox One’s Mysterious Qi, as transmitted by Celestial Master So-and-so in accordance with the Dao, your servant bows twice with reverence.

O Highest True and Majestic Qi, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Statutes, the males and females born as So-and-so, having first received the grace of their master’s enlightenment and been appointed to celestial offices, bear an undeserved bounty—truly an immeasurable outpouring of compassion. Yet your servants were born in this defiled age, their lives beset by the Three Calamities, their forms tainted by the Ten Evils, their habits ingrained by nature. They have transgressed the sacred prohibitions, their sins filling the empty void, and now suffer the consequences in succession, with no merit to atone. Were it not for the mercy of Heaven, how could they be delivered?

We have heard that the Great Dao’s compassion is universally vast, its grace extending to the Ten Directions, opening the bridge of deliverance for all living beings, its methods all-encompassing. Its blessings moisten the Three Realms, its grace permeates the Six Paths. Your servants now submit this petition with utmost sincerity, pledging their lives to the Mysterious True Ones. We beseech the Three Honored Ones to appear and bestow upon us the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven’s Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ true-form talismans, the tally tablets, staffs, and contracts, to forever relieve us of the sufferings of the long river. Upon receiving these teachings, we shall adhere to the statutes without fail, never daring to violate the sacred covenants. We humbly request that, in accordance with this petition, our celestial offices be duly conferred.

We hereby record the names, ages, prefectures, counties, townships, and villages of the aforementioned males and females, submitting this memorial to the celestial bureaus as stated. We prostrate ourselves and pray:

May the Primordial Ultimate Great Dao, the Supreme Golden Portal Jade Thearch, Most True and Great Sage, issue a decree to the Upper Primordial Nine Heavens’ Immortal Capital, appointing the Jade Gentleman of the Immortal Offices and the Nine Heavens’ True Kings to oversee the deliverance of lives. May they summon the celestial officials, distinguish their proper ranks, and on such-and-such day of this month, confer upon us the teachings as prescribed. We shall present this memorial and petition before the Primordial Ultimate Great Dao.

Your servant, trembling with awe, prostrates himself again and again, acknowledging his mortal offenses. Humbly submitted to the Supreme Primordial Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal Jade Thearch, to examine and summon the Pure and True Qi.

In the year of such-and-such, on such-and-such day of such-and-such month, at the hour of *zi*, your servant So-and-so, in such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, submits this memorial to the Supreme Primordial Nine Heavens’ Supreme True and Radiant Great Assembly of Perfected Ones.

**Ritual for the Three-Five Chapter Regalia:**
The Pure Primordial Ultimate Orthodox One’s Mysterious Qi, as transmitted by Celestial Master So-and-so in accordance with the Dao, your servant bows twice with reverence.

O Highest True and Majestic Qi, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Statutes, the males and females So-and-so, numbering so-and-so, have submitted their petition and prostrated themselves, seeking to receive the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven’s Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ true-form talismans, the tally tablets, staffs, and contracts. On such-and-such day of this month, your servant has, in accordance with the statutes, appointed them to their celestial offices, as recorded in the preceding memorial.

We prostrate ourselves and pray: May the Boundless Great Dao, Most True and Great Sage, Supreme Heavenly Worthy, deign to gaze upon us with divine insight. May the Compassionate True Ones descend and open the path of deliverance for us, that these teachings may become our eternal treasure. May the decree be issued to the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Jade Thearch, the Overseers of True Deliverance, the Jade Gentlemen of the Mysterious Capital’s Immortal Offices, the Feathered Gentlemen of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Deliverance Jade Bureaus, the Three-Five Deliverance Envoys, and the Disaster-Dispelling, Dao-Conferring True Lords of the Supreme Three Heavens’ Golden Portal Jade Thearch. May they all descend together, their celestial mounts filling heaven and earth, their flowing essence swift as lightning, their radiance resplendent and serene. May they sweep away the myriad wrongs of the Six Heavens, summon the divine officials of the Three Realms, and together descend to oversee the deliverance of your servants’ ritual affairs. May the statutes and ordinances be conferred, forever anchoring within us, never to grow cold.

Your servant prostrates himself and presents this written memorial. We implore the Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Golden Portal Jade Thearch, Most True and Great Sage, to take pity on your servant’s petition and, in accordance with the matter at hand, distinguish the Pure and True Mysterious Qi, the wondrous efficacy of the living spirits. May the celestial officials and their retinues confer these teachings upon us, ever guarding and protecting, their flowing light swift as lightning, filling our palaces and chambers, and eternally safeguarding the Three Primordials.

We humbly entrust this memorial to the Directing Perfected Talisman Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, the Flying Heavenly Jade Gentlemen, the Flying Perfected White Tiger Spirit Dragon Riders, and their twelve hundred attendants each, to swiftly transmit this document and present it before the Supreme Most True Jade Thearch.

Your servant, trembling with awe, prostrates himself again and again, acknowledging his mortal offenses. Humbly submitted for your attention.

Your servant, of the [such-and-such] surname, affiliated with the [such-and-such] Abbey or Oratory as its abbot, in accordance with the Great Purity’s ritual statutes, respectfully presents this memorial on the [day and hour] of the [year and month] of the Great Year’s cycle, at [such-and-such] locale.
