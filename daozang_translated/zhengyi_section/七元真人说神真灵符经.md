**The Seven Primordial Perfected Ones’ Scripture of Divine and Numinous Talismans**

The Seven Perfected Ones proclaim to all demon kings, spirit kings, and the demon kings of the Six Cavern Heavens of Mount Fengdu in the Northern Darkness: From this day forward, you shall not recklessly slay the myriad people of the world, for all people are the limbs and vessels within my own body. I possess divine talismans that command and restrain outer demons, sealing them within the six viscera.

From this day forward, if there be any Shangqing Daoist who retreats to secluded cliffs and deep valleys, devoting themselves to a single Dharma, yielding their person for righteousness, holding wealth and goods as nothing, and concentrating their heart on saving others—practicing this Dao of mine and turning toward the Purple Tenuity Emperor and the Five Venerable Celestial Perfected—then let it be known:

If any Daoist, with whole heart, desires to receive and uphold this teaching, they shall present a white silk inscribed with their life-destiny, petition the Supreme Perfected, and follow the Dharma accordingly. They must vow never to divulge it, storing it in a jade casket, never to be transmitted for kalpas uncounted.

The Seven Perfected Ones proclaim to the hosts of the Six Heavens’ demons, bidding them heed these decisive words: The Way of cultivation and reverence shall lead to ascent in cloud chariots; the Way of arrogance and contempt shall bring calamity and annihilation across three kalpas. Now, this command is issued.

The Seven Perfected Ones say: I empower the mighty talisman of the Sword Spirit King. If any Daoist treats illness, they shall inscribe it in ink upon white silk and have the afflicted wear it—their sickness shall immediately be cured.

This talisman emerges from the Demon-Subduing Bureau of Fengdu. If a Daoist obtains it, they may traverse the world to save people, curing malevolent spirits and interrogating ghosts. When such a Daoist enters the home of the afflicted, the myriad ghosts shall submit of their own accord. Without invoking the mighty power of the Great Dao’s Life-Generating True Spirit, demons shall naturally submit, hide, and perish, and the Black Slayer’s kalpas of power shall be unattainable for transmission.

The Five Ding Talismans of the Black Slayer Celestial Soldiers: Inscribe in cinnabar upon white poplar wood, one foot and five inches in length. Use them to guard the five directions of a dwelling, writing them on the day of Heavenly Guidance.

- The Upper Celestial Ding governs the slaying of green pestilence ghosts in the East.
- The Middle Celestial Ding governs the slaying of red pestilence ghosts in the South.
- The Lower Celestial Ding governs the slaying of white pestilence ghosts in the West.
- The Left Celestial Ding governs the slaying of black pestilence ghosts in the North.
- The Right Celestial Ding governs the slaying of yellow pestilence ghosts in the Center.

The Seven Perfected Ones say: The Five Numinous Black Slayer Spirit Talismans—inscribe in ink upon catalpa wood, two feet in length, with a blue-green ground, writing on a *jiazi* day. Use them to guard places where mountain spirits, spectral anomalies, and strange beings have dwelled for many years. Employ this talisman to sever and intercept their power. Offer twelve portions of wine and dried meat, recite the Heavenly Mulberry Spirit Incantation seven times, and I shall dispatch a host of ten thousand spirit soldiers, a flowing fire stretching ten thousand miles, sweeping away demonic hordes. The myriad spirits shall tremble and submit, fleeing for ten thousand miles.

This talisman emerges from the Six Heavenly Palaces of Fengdu. The Three Heavenly True Contract Spirit Talismans are inscribed with a single *qi*.

The Seven Perfected Ones say: The Proclamation of the Eight Might Talismans—if any Daoist wishes to treat illness and suppress spectral anomalies, they may inscribe it in ink upon cypress wood, one foot and five inches in length, and hang it in the central courtyard of the dwelling. Present a silk inscribed with their life-destiny, and it may then be transmitted. It shall guard for thirty years.

The Seven Perfected Ones say: The Proclamation of the Nine Talismanic Scriptures and the Nine Dragons’ Life Mandate—thirty-six feet of white silk. Wearing this divine talisman, a single contract shall cause the hundred spirits to conceal their voices and the myriad gods to attend in ranks.

If there be any later-learning Daoist, diligent and courageous, revered by the world, they may be granted this cinnabar-script divine formula to subdue all demonic realms. In times of plague and calamity, they may traverse the borders of the realm, bestowing divine talismans upon those afflicted among the multitude. Erect a Seven Primordials altar, kindle lamps and perform the Dao, summoning and interrogating the officers and soldiers to aid the people of Heaven. Practicing such meritorious deeds, they shall be commended by the Three Realms.

This scripture is numinous and wondrous, concealed within the grotto-heavens of the Five Marchmounts by the spirit officials, each attended by twenty-four myriad spirit soldiers, who burn incense, scatter flowers, and stand guard on all sides. Those with accumulated good causes shall, at the Mysterious Assembly, be duly granted it.

The Seven Perfected Ones say: When inscribing talismans, do so at dawn on the third and twenty-seventh days of each month. Stand facing east, set up the writing desk, and inscribe in cinnabar. Swallow one talisman, and it shall suffice. This shall grant penetrating vision and unwaning spirit-*qi*. Let it not be touched by the polluted *qi* of women. After a thousand days of practice, the Divine Woman of the Grand Tenuity shall appear.

- First Primordial True *Qi*
- Second Primordial True *Qi*
- Third Primordial True *Qi*
- Fourth Primordial True *Qi*
- Fifth Primordial True *Qi*
- Sixth Primordial True *Qi*
- Seventh Primordial True *Qi*

The Seven Perfected Ones say: Long ago, the Mysterious True Treasure was received, hidden in the Great Canopy Heaven. Above, in the Golden Portal Jade Chamber of the Mysterious Mysterious Holy Mother, these divine and true scriptures are preserved. Offerings are made to the luminous sources of famous mountains and great rivers, to heal illnesses, deploy troops and dispatch generals—all thirty-two heavens shall pay homage. The ancestral lineage of the Supreme Emperor holds eighty myriad divine formulas of judicial authority, which cannot be fully transmitted. Obtaining this single Dharma suffices for a thousand days. Follow and practice it precisely as the master’s oral instructions.
