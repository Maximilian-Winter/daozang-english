**Preface to the *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**

Upon reading Han Changli’s verses on Peach Blossom Spring, one’s thoughts drift to the ethereal realm of immortals; upon reading Bai Juyi’s odes to sea and mountain, one’s heart stirs with longing to return to Tuṣita. The human mind, rootless, generates wisdom in response to words.

Alas! I have heard that immortality can be learned, that deathlessness can be attained through effort. Not that I claim mastery—only that I aspire to study it! From youth, my heart has been lashed by the pursuit of Daoist cultivation, and unawares, the years have passed from *renzi* to *dingchou*. How fleeting are the years of this world! How can this sack of skin and bone endure such weariness?

Heaven, in its grace, has granted me gradual access to the Dao. In that spring, I encountered the true master, Lord Haiqiong—Bai, styled Yuchan—who some say was from Hainan, though others suspect his family hailed from Xiang or Mian. At times, his hair wild and feet bare, he plunged into the bustling marketplace; at others, clad in a green headscarf and rustic robes, he wandered through palaces and temples. Adrift among the common folk, none recognized him.

He claimed to be twenty-one, yet had delved into the Three Teachings’ texts without exception. In conversation, his command of classics and history flowed like a spring—surpassing even the most learned scholars of our age. His calligraphy—seal, clerical, cursive, and standard—revealed a mind of wondrous clarity. The qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting were but occasional diversions. Those who associated with him were all the era’s most eminent scholars, yet even his admirers found it difficult to draw near.

Though he carried no paper, his brush filled the land; though he traversed rivers and lakes, his name resounded across the realm—so numerous were his followers. Often, his pouch held not a single copper coin or grain of millet for sustenance. At times, drunk beyond measure, he would summon thunder; in deep sleep, he could dispatch memorials to the heavens. Joy or anger, laughter or tears—his demeanor seemed unhinged, yet his words sometimes aligned with fortune or misfortune. His zeal for aiding the world and benefiting others was unceasing.

He would sit through the night by candlelight, or sing all day with hands clapping the railing. Neither morning baths nor daytime meals concerned him; for years, he treated fire and water as if they did not exist. Some marveled at his ears and eyes, while others heard him discourse in riddles with his teeth—though the meaning remained obscure. Sober without wine, dazed upon waking, his writings and sayings have been carved on steles and published by scholars across the land.

Now, his wrath outweighs his caution, and he stands at odds with the world—yet those who revere him are drawn as if by magnet and needle! He entrusted me with texts on the Nine Cauldrons, golden lead, cinnabar, and mercury; with the secrets of the Great Monad’s elixir knife, fire talismans, and golden liquor; with the *Purple Empyrean*’s writings on summoning wind and thunder. I, Yuanchang, reflect that in the past, I offended Heaven, lost my true self, and fell into this world—how could I deserve such teachings? I vow to devote my body to their cultivation, that I may not betray what I have learned.

Thus, I have gathered a few of his enlightening exchanges and had them carved into wood, that fellow seekers across the Four Seas may find inspiration. Lord Bai received these teachings from Chen Niuwan; Chen from Xue Daoguang; Xue from Shi Tai; Shi from Zhang Pingshu; Zhang from Liu Haichan; and Liu from Lü Dongbin.

Since all know his character, what need have I to elaborate further? With this, I bow twice in reverence.

**The *Haiqiong Inquiries on the Dao* Collection**
*Composed by Bai Yuchan of Haiqiong*

**The Dragon-Tiger Rhapsody**

Marvelous indeed! The ninefold-transmuted golden liquor, the sevenfold-returned Great Elixir of Reversion—truly the *tārā* of spirit and qi, the primal father of nature and life. It grasps the primordial of Anavatapta, fulfilling the illustrious merit of Dharma. The body is cinnabar, the heart mercury—emerging with the sun, entering with the moon. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird—Mars abides in *gui*, bathing in the vast; the sovereign of the *bing* Crimson Palace presides over the profound vessel of the Yellow Court. Compassionate yet solemn, majestic yet refined.

Heaven’s One is *Kan*, Earth’s Two is *Li*—*Qian* and *Kun* alternate between south and north. True lead, the qi of prior heaven, crowns the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft, inner and outer, the principles of the feminine and masculine—metal and fire embrace, gold and water engage. At *Chujiu*, before the divine transformation, the heart of heaven cradles harmonious yang. Wood-mercury engenders the body of the eastern dawn; metal-essence matures the embryo of the western *xu*. *Xun* completes its return, *Qian* its decline—spring and autumn manifest benevolence and righteousness; winter and summer, their boundaries and measures.

The cauldrons of *Danlou*, above and below—cinnabar and mercury unite, moved within the divine chamber. *Xu* and *Wei* spread their wings—metal does not split, earth does not scatter. Concealed leaps and hidden flights—coming and going, ascending and descending without fixed hexagram, returning to the Great Ultimate to enfold all minerals. Being and non-being, concealment and revelation—water and metal become the elixir, their root the sun’s essence, extinguishing *Kan* and *Li*. Floating and sinking, waxing and waning.

The Metal Elder seeks the fullness of *Kan*; the Crone knocks on the emptiness of *Li*. Metal slays wood, water treasures fire. The Yellow Emperor plants his banner in the Metal Village—metal, wood, and fire transform into the dust of the Bright Window. The primordial chaos of metal and fire—precious essence culminates in the ninefold. One *jin* of sixteen *liang*, three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The *Zhen* hexagram receives the yang tally—water is dark, metal ochre, earth yellow. Mountains and rivers, the great earth congeal the void—essence and fluid merge with cinnabar to fuse the true.

Black lead transmutes into pure vermilion; mercury gleams with azure radiance. The golden flower veils the vast emptiness. Water as one, fire as two, earth as five—soaking the flourishing metal, flying the essence of water. The supreme essence of heaven and earth—with *wu* and *ji* revolving the celestial tally, the twelve Dipper pivots and twelve bell pitches—flowing mercury, the sun’s soul; golden moon, the moon’s spirit. The dark diagram not yet worn away—yang essence is the father of the *Bifang*; *Kun* transforms into *Zhen* at the first, then into *Dui* at the second. Sun and moon conjoin as jade disks, the upper crescent level as a cord.

The three fives and three yangs complete their circle—round brilliance appears in the eastern *jia*. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s nodes; the hare’s spirit emits living light. *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, then into *Gen*—the moon shines in *xin*, revealing *bing*. Five and six cycles revolve—northeast loses its companion in the *yi* land. Earth and wood, metal harmonize into liquid, returning to the semblance of *Chan*. The divine chamber of the thunderous dawn—within, the five agents; without, the eight trigrams. Yin tally and yang fire—six decades transmute the hen’s egg; the Five Peaks stand in concealment. The pivot’s crown is *Qian*-metal; its heel, *Kun*-water. Yin and yang receive from nature—central harmony flows in purity. The numinous gate is black; lead refines true earth. The spring cavern births white metal—quicksilver.

At *hai*-end, yang stirs—the sun’s chariot traverses the southern lands. The five stars align in a pearl-string; metal and cinnabar breathe in unison. The slowness and swiftness of sun and moon—the Purple Tenuity’s sixteen stars of the Canopy, the Three Terraces’ harmonizing stars—demand governance and record. The sun’s fire unites the essence of the five agents, refining the earth of the central palace. The moon’s metal receives the discipline of the six pitches, entering the water of the northern quarter.

Fire is the elixir’s parents; the elixir, fire’s descendants. Water, earth, and metal—sixty days determine prior and subsequent life and death. Metal and mercury lock horns; the crucible and chamber stand in balance. The earth-mother summons the harmony of the four directions—*Qian* stirs, responding to the Three Luminaries. The essence and qi of metal and fire illuminate the chamber—how could water dry up and fire perish? The qi of dragon and tiger intertwine; the affections of metal and wood unite. Emotion and nature intertwine—warmly nurturing the child-pearl.

Water is the dark flower; earth, the metal-mother. The elixir chamber congeals flowing pearls—yellow and black blend the primordial essence of water and earth. Purple blossoms spread their richness; yellow liquid ripples. The divine medicine not yet mature—metal generates water. Refining lead into white metal, white metal into the divine chamber. The divine chamber holds metal-water—the fire’s hue transforms, congealing into yellow ascent. Water and fire coagulate in the central palace—golden liquor does not fly. Fire scorches the golden flower—light smoke, thin mist, then silence.

White metal is being; fire’s qi, non-being. Refining mercury heralds the divine, the twofold emptiness. Water and fire embrace purity; sun and moon hold the void. Black lead—metal’s essence, dark water—envelops *Kan*-mercury. The yellow sprout appears; the white medicine, the red bud of metal—water’s mother, the Flowery Pond overflows with the true. The plain altar, the furnace’s tortoise, holds the divine chamber—its winding paths and barrier dikes. Metal and earth unite with mercury—naturally, the divine transformation is complete!

**The Song of the Crow and Hare**

Ah! The wonder of the golden liquor’s Great Elixir of Reversion—its subtlety pervades the cosmos, sinking into the bones of the void. At dawn’s glow, the Dipper ascends to the left; at dusk’s dust, it turns to the right. In the sun’s palace, the hare leaps; in the moon’s mansion, the crow soars. The Alchemical Maiden rides the red dragon; the Metal Elder crouches on the black tiger. Cinnabar gestates mercury; lead seals silver. The four images reach their limit; the five agents govern through earth. The Yellow Matron dons a rainbow skirt; *ding* faces forward, clad in azure mist. Black and white divide the Mysterious Female; the Flowery Pond emits jade nectar. The Red Child gives birth to the dark pearl; the red furnace smelts hard metal.

The green turtle’s feet are red; the white toad’s back is black. Jade creepers flourish in the divine valley; golden millet sprouts in the cinnabar field. The *pāṭala* flower blooms; the *devas’* clouds scatter their leaves. The southern *Ji* and *Yaoyao*; the northern *Shao* and the dark record of *Li*. The celestial scheme—sun and moon repeat; Mars establishes the six voids. The wind-wheel and water-fire *Gou*—the vast womb, the three-line embryo. Two and three, nursing complete; five and six, ninety-nine cycles. Locusts fly in summer snow; grass thrives in winter’s heat.

The Yang’s vigor fortifies the martial city-pool;
The Yin’s softness cherishes the literary pearl’s treasure.
Hare and fowl bathe in orchid and angelica.

The toad’s radiance transforms into halberds and spears;
The recumbent moon’s furnace forges the celestial stem.
The cinnabar tripod stands atop Kunlun;
*Qian*’s origin, *Qian*’s *Zhun* and *Meng*;
*Kun*’s function, *Kun*’s *Pi* and *Tai*.

Chang’e pairs with Rāhu;
Yang Li weds the lunar comet.
Clear and turbid are discerned in mud;
Floating and sinking are sought in fire.
Host and guest mutually punish and empower;
Generation and conquest reciprocate grace and harm.

Two eights form double bowstrings;
Two sevens and nine compose *Qian*.
The killing mechanism kills in *Gen*;
Drilling and refining belong to *Zhen*.

The Great One gestates *Wu* and *Ji*;
All things are but wind and moon.
Iron, tin, copper, *tou*, silver—
Transform to birth the purple lotus leaves.

One asks of the lotus leaves:
A numinous fragrance suffuses the smoke-laden thoroughfare.
The Primordial Celestial Worthy as frost;
The Most High Lord Lao as cherry blossoms.

Alas!
The *Mysterious Pass* reveals its esoteric discourse:
A single word, half a phrase—thus the profound is penetrated.
Why need a thousand, ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts?
If one is not burdened by form,
Before one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Net.

Should one wish to refine form and spirit,
One must recognize returning to the root and restoring life.
Thus the Dao returns to the root through the root’s aperture;
Restoring life seeks the life-restoring pass.
As for this pass and aperture—
If one knows their true reality,
Then returning to the root and restoring life pose no difficulty.

Hence it is said:
Should one wish to know the immortal’s art,
One must but search for the root of creation.
Of old, Emptiness gave birth to the Spontaneous;
The Spontaneous gave birth to the Great Dao;
The Great Dao gave birth to the One Qi;
The One Qi divided into Yin and Yang;
Yin and Yang became Heaven and Earth;
Heaven and Earth gave birth to the myriad things—
This is the root of creation.

This is the True One’s Qi,
Antecedent to all phenomena,
The Grand Void, the Grand Nonbeing,
The Grand Emptiness, the Grand Mystery.
Vast and obscure, immeasurable by inches;
Boundless and surging, unfathomable by shores.
Its greatness has no exterior;
Its smallness has no interior.
Vast enough to embrace Heaven and Earth;
Minute enough to enter the tip of a hair.
Above, no further hue;
Below, no further abyss.
One thing, round and luminous,
Manifesting through the ages—
That which cannot be named.

The sage, with heart, apprehends it;
Reluctantly, names it the Dao.
Thus to know that the heart itself is the Dao.
Therefore, without heart, one merges with the Dao;
With heart, one strays from the Dao.
Only this word “without”:
Encompasses all existence without remainder,
Generates the myriad things without exhaustion.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
They can command the formed,
But cannot command the formless.
Though Yin and Yang are subtle,
They can command the qi-endowed,
But cannot command the qi-less.
Though the Five Phases are most refined,
They can command the numbered,
But cannot command the numberless.
Though a hundred thoughts arise in tumult,
They can command the conscious,
But cannot command the unconscious.

Now, those who cultivate this principle—
Would do well first to refine the form.
The marvel of refining form lies in congealing spirit.
When spirit congeals, qi gathers;
When qi gathers, the elixir forms;
When the elixir forms, the body solidifies;
When the body solidifies, spirit is complete.

Thus Song Qiqiu said:
Forget form to nurture qi;
Forget qi to nurture spirit;
Forget spirit to nurture emptiness.
Only this word “forget”—
This is the state of no-thing.
Originally, there was not one thing—
Where could dust alight?
This is what is meant.

If one can savor this principle,
And labor upon this word “forget,”
One may enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao,
Seize the marvelous workings of spontaneity,
Establish the elixir’s foundation in an instant,
And circulate creation within one’s body.

Yet this Dao—
Gazed upon, it is desolate and nothing is seen;
Listened to, it is obscure and nothing is heard.
Only with the heart can one see its images;
Only with the heart can one hear its sounds.
If the Daoist adept,
With darkened heart and congealed spirit,
Attains emptiness and preserves stillness,
Then the empty chamber generates brightness—
Truly, this is spontaneity.

Only the Most High saves beings,
Teaching people to cultivate and refine:
Taking Heaven and Earth as the crucible,
The crow and hare as medicinal substances,
The sun’s essence’s ascent and descent corresponding to qi and blood’s rise and fall,
The moon’s spirit’s waxing and waning corresponding to essence and spirit’s ebb and flow,
The four seasons’ nodes corresponding to a day’s hours,
The celestial revolution’s stellar count corresponding to a furnace’s alchemy.

Thus:
Gather essence and spirit as medicine;
Take stillness and quiescence as fire.
With the fire of stillness and quiescence,
Refine the medicine of essence and spirit—
Thus is the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor formed.
For the union of true Yin and true Yang,
The pairing of one water and one fire,
First discern floating and sinking,
Then clarify host and guest,
Scrutinize the operations of withdrawal and addition,
Examine the perils of reversal and repetition.

As Gao Xiangxian said:
“Gather on the appointed day;
Take at the proper time.”
As Liu Haichan said:
“Opening and closing, Heaven and Earth’s creative power—
Forge and refine a furnace of true sun and moon.”
Those who comprehend this
Emulate the sun and moon’s workings,
And share the same merit as Heaven and Earth.

How could one know:
Heaven nurtures without image;
Earth nurtures without form.
Thus Heaven is long, Earth enduring;
Sun radiant, moon luminous—
The True One eternally abides;
Emptiness never perishes.

Now, I model myself upon this:
No affairs for the heart;
No heart for affairs.
Inwardly observe the heart—
The heart has no heart.
Outwardly observe the form—
The form has no form.
Observe things afar—
Things have no things.
Know the heart is heartless;
Know the form is formless;
Know things are thingless—
Transcend the myriad illusions,
Steadfastly, one numinous essence.

The ancient scripture says:
“It gave birth to me in emptiness,
Placed me in nothingness.”
Thus one should return to the root of nature’s primordial beginning,
Revert to the state before one’s birth.
Hide the heart within the heart, yet it is not seen;
Conceal spirit within spirit, yet it does not emerge.
Thus one can:
Roundly penetrate the three times,
Stilling the myriad threads;
Purify the six roots,
Emptying the square inch to clarity.
Not clinging to emptiness,
Not clinging to nothingness—
Empty all that is empty;
Void all that is void.
Until emptiness is empty of emptiness,
Void is void of void—
Pure, bare, naked, and unadorned—
Then the numinous alone abides.

The Dao does not desire emptiness;
Emptiness naturally returns to it.
If one can empty the heart,
The Dao naturally returns to one.

The Dao is originally nameless,
Near yet cannot be grasped,
Far yet cannot be abandoned,
Neither square nor round,
Neither within nor without—
Only the sage knows it.

The three poisons have no root,
The six desires have no seed;
Sudden awakening to this principle unites all in emptiness and nothingness.
Laozi said: “Between heaven and earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
The more it moves, the more it yields.”

If one can, in the midst of stillness and concentration,
Embrace the qi of harmonious balance,
Guard the essence of the True One,
This is sealing the furnace and securing the elixir,
Proceeding with the fire phases.

Fire originates from the southern *Li* trigram,
*Li* belongs to the heart,
The heart is spirit,
Spirit is fire,
Qi is the medicine.
Refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir
Is precisely guiding qi with spirit to accomplish the Dao.

If one can grasp the sun and moon in hand,
Hold the primordial chaos in the heart,
One naturally witnesses the opening of the bellows,
The ascent and descent of the river chariot,
Water irrigating the palace of life,
Fire nourishing the terrace of the elixir,
Metal and wood merging,
Water and earth harmonizing.
The maiden rides the dragon,
The old man straddles the tiger,
Reversing through the three barriers,
Ascending to the inner court,
Transforming into liquid jade,
Descending into the tower of nine stories.
Within lies a cavity called the Elixir Terrace,
Where lead and mercury unite,
Water and fire merge.
As soon as the intent arrives,
It is like a seal matching its impression—
Natural, unforced, and perfectly aligned.

The movement of movement arises from non-movement,
The action of action arises from non-action.
At this moment,
White snow blankets the sky,
Yellow sprouts cover the earth,
Dragon roars and tiger howls,
Husband sings and wife follows,
The jade crucible boils,
The golden furnace blazes,
Thunder rumbles and lightning flashes,
Shaking heaven and earth.
The hundred meridians bristle,
The three barriers open,
The mysterious pearl takes form,
The Great One returns to truth.
Wind stirs in the mud-pill palace,
The moon shines in the crimson palace,
Mist warms the cinnabar field,
Waves settle in the valley pond.
Refining the returning elixir
Is as easy as turning the hand.

Seven reversals and nine returns
Complete the great medicine.
Refining by day and simmering by hour,
Until the pill revolves—
Heaven’s gate and earth’s pivot
Lie within one’s grasp.
The scripture says:
“If one can always remain pure and still,
Heaven and earth all return to them.”
Thus the three flowers gather at the crown,
The five qi ascend to the origin,
One may enter the gate of manifold wonders,
The mystery within mystery.

Further, by day wielding the numinous banner,
By night nurturing the fiery mushroom,
Warming and nourishing the sacred embryo,
Giving birth to the crimson child—
Until the embryo is shed and the spirit transformed,
Yang is restored and the bones exchanged,
This is preserving the spirit with the jade tally,
Refining the form with golden liquid,
Both form and spirit perfected,
Merging with the Dao in truth.

Zhang Pingshu said:
“All comes in a moment’s effort,
Eternally securing boundless ease.”
Truly so!

This speaks of it.

For it is the foundation of the Dao, the root of the elixir,
The origin of dragon and tiger, the ancestor of lead and mercury.
Where the three fires gather, where the eight waters return,
The gate where myriad spirits pay homage,
The source of the golden elixir’s wondrous workings—
This is the crucial aperture of returning to the root and restoring life.

Once one knows this,
Desires need not be banished, for the heart naturally stills;
The heart need not be settled, for the spirit naturally clears.
With not a single thought arising, all illusions subside.
The body rides the whirlwind, the spirit roams the vast expanse.
Only then does one realize:
When the wind is pure and the moon bright, all reveals the mechanism of lead and mercury;
When waters are green and mountains blue, all discloses the essence of tiger and dragon.

Bai Yuchan of Hainan, having learned the elixir method from his late master Chen Niyuan, would at the winter solstice when the sun reached its zenith,
Open Qian and close Xun, retain Kun and block Gen,
Grasp the Dipper’s handle, tilt the celestial pivot,
Pay homage to the Xuanyuan Emperor, pass through Fusang,
Enter the Broad Cold Palace, face the Quail’s Tail,
Raise the Yellow Bell, stir the sea’s waves,
Ascend Kunlun, bear the Tang talisman,
Shake the thunder of heaven, wander Mount Wu,
Summon the Yellow Lad, call the Vermilion Child,
Take the liver of the Azure Dragon, the marrow of the White Tiger,
The blood of the Crimson Phoenix, the essence of the Black Tortoise,
Place them in the earthen crucible, kindle the Sparkling Deluder,
Command Guan Bo to transform them into cinnabar,
Open the Flowery Pond, draw in the spirit-water,
Drink the knife-point’s measure,
Proceed from nonbeing into being, from formlessness into form,
Withdraw lead and add mercury,
Knit together the sacred embryo.
After ten months, when qi is full and form complete,
A body exists beyond the body—
This is called the Embryonic Immortal.

Its secret says:
“When intent is undivided, the spirit may be concentrated;
With the heart ashen and in profound stillness,
The golden elixir forms within.”
This is what the master attained.

As in the poem of Shi Jianwu of old:
*"Qi is the medicine that adds years,
The heart commands qi as its spirit.
Who masters spirit and qi
Becomes an immortal indeed."*

This verse is simple yet profoundly abstruse. Jade Toad, upon reading it, recited it naturally until the autumn moon shone bright in the sky, and the void dissolved into the realm of decay—only those who are withered wood and cold ash could not comprehend this.

Since you have attained this, I dare not keep silent. The Supreme Mysterious Statutes say:
*"To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the Heavenly Dao;
To transmit to the unworthy is to leak the Heavenly Treasure."*
Across land and sea, I have sought in vain for one worthy—transmission must not be reckless, lest I incur Heaven’s censure. Yet fearing the Great Dao may go untransmitted and the elixir arts fade into oblivion, I compose *The Manifest Secret of the Mysterious Pass*, to enlighten this world and instruct later learners, preserving the slender thread of the golden elixir.

Still, I worry that people remain ignorant of this principle, so I shall speak further: With the eye, see the eye; with the ear, hear the ear; with the nose, regulate the nose; with the mouth, seal the mouth. Concealment and soaring flight both arise from the one heart. First, cultivate stillness and concentrate the spirit, restrain anger and suppress desire. When anger is restrained and desire suppressed, water and fire achieve harmony; when water and fire harmonize, metal and wood unite; when metal and wood unite, the true earth returns to its place; when the true earth returns, the golden elixir naturally grows as large as a millet grain, adding one grain each day. Spirit returns, qi is restored, filling heaven and earth. As Mencius said of nurturing the vast and mighty qi—this is it.

When liver-qi is whole, there is benevolence; when lung-qi is whole, there is righteousness; when heart-qi is whole, there is propriety; when kidney-qi is whole, there is wisdom; when spleen-qi is whole, there is trust. If one’s qi is deficient, one lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—how can such a one be called human? Those who cultivate emptiness and nurture the vast, whose hearts are expansive and bodies at ease, find the qi-mother already formed, and the elixir easily coalesces. How can one not cherish this nurturance to preserve one’s boundless self? Let scholars ponder this.

Respectfully inscribed and entrusted to Liu Ziyuan.

**The Recluse of Hidden Mountain’s Writings**
Jade Toad withdrew from the world and reclined high upon Ge Mountain’s peak. A visitor asked: "What is the essence of reclusion in the mountains? What joy does it bring?"

He replied: "Those who excel at mountain reclusion do not know the joy of reclusion; those who know its joy are like birds that must choose their trees or fish that must choose their waters. The joy of mountain dwellers lies not in the mountains themselves, but in the heart’s joy—when heart and mountain become one. Facing circumstances without attachment, facing the heart without circumstance—this is the true joy of reclusion!"

The visitor asked: "If the essence of mountain reclusion is thus, do mountain recluses not know the flavor of the mountains?"

He replied: "The flavor of the mountains is the joy of the mountains. The recluse knows the flavor of the Dao, not the flavor of the mountains. Let me tell you of what my ears have heard and eyes have seen."

The visitor assented.

He continued: "The recluse must not let the joy of the mountains sway the heart, nor let the heart’s joy cling to the mountains. The mountain is the mountain, the heart is the heart. The recluse does not ask, 'What were people like in ancient times? What are they like now?'—this mountain is as it is, that mountain is as it is. There are those who reclude in mountains, times for reclusion, and joys of reclusion. In such times, sages and worthies gather; people esteem virtue and Dao; their joy lies in refining form and spirit. Yet I fear that with such knowledge and perception, nine or ten out of ten will fall short of the ancients!

The mountain recluse is not one who must dwell among peaks and ridges—without peaks and ridges, there are still mountains. Each person has their own mountain of reclusion. Those who are clear, empty, tranquil, lofty, and explore the profound—this is the mountain of the person, the mountain of the heart. Those entangled in right and wrong, honor and disgrace, poverty and wealth, high and low—this is the marketplace of the person, the marketplace of the heart. Today, some say great reclusion lies in secluded villages, while lesser reclusion lies in the mountains—this is not without reason.

Since the habits of fame and profit burn fiercely, and worldly desires assail the mind, one grows weary of noise and seeks quiet. But when the joy of tranquility fills the heart and the impulse for cultivation cools, one grows weary of quiet and seeks noise. Yet if one can establish this heart, whether in a secluded garden or a bustling marketplace, it remains the same heart. There is no need to flee the heart’s noise to satisfy its desires, nor to delight in a superior environment or resent an inferior one. Knowing the mountain as it is, rejoicing in the heart as it is—this is true reclusion!

To reclude in mountains, first reclude the heart. Without affairs, govern the heart—this is reclusion; with affairs, respond to the near—this is the mountain. Without heart for the mountain, without mountain in the heart. Thus, one must first recognize the Dao before recluding in the mountains. If one dwells in the mountains before knowing the Dao, seeing the mountain, one forgets the Dao. If one knows the Dao before dwelling in the mountains, pursuing the Dao, one forgets the mountain. Forgetting the mountain, the Dao-nature gladdens the spirit; forgetting the Dao, the mountain’s form obscures the eyes. Thus, forgetting the mountain reveals the Dao—even the human world becomes still. Seeing the mountain and forgetting the Dao, even the mountains become noisy.

When all dharmas are empty and merged, when every thought is empty and still—what city is too noisy? What mountain marsh is too quiet? If the mountain is quiet yet the heart is always noisy, it is no different from the marketplace. If the marketplace is noisy yet the heart is always quiet, it is no different from the mountain. Noisy yet not noisy—what quiet remains to seek? Speech and silence are but mountains; movement and stillness are but markets. Serenity rests within, undisturbed; freedom and ease manifest outwardly—like fish and kites soaring in the sky and abyss. One simply follows what brings joy!"

The joy here is not the joy of the ears and eyes, nor the joy that follows; it is not the joy of emotions and perceptions, nor the joy that follows. Joy resides in the heart—it cannot be described in form, nor grasped by knowledge or sight.

The joy of the heart is the joy of the recluse, untouched by mountains. The pure and still is one’s Dao-ground; serenity and retreat are one’s practice; peace and bliss are one’s kin. One desires no commerce with the world, no entanglement with things. In cultivating the body, one does not serve the hundred limbs; in nourishing form, one does not indulge in the five flavors. One regards the day of death as no different from the year of life, and treats possessions as though they were nothing.

In quiet meditation, clouds drift through valleys and mist swirls among peaks; in walking meditation, moonlight fills the grottoes and wind stirs the forests. Deer and elk are one’s companions; pines and bamboo are one’s neighbors. One enjoys the wealth of spring leeks and autumn chrysanthemums, the nobility of morning mist and evening dew.

As for clothing—plaited grass and knotted rushes, woven reeds and sewn orchids. As for food—steamed ginseng and mashed poria, pine-nut rice and cypress-leaf gruel. One drinks from the crystalline springs of stone marrow, feeds on the rich earth of mountain liver. One walks before withered trees, sits beneath ancient cliffs, dwells in deep forests and secluded valleys, sleeps upon mossy stones.

By day, one chants long to the secluded clouds and springs; by night, one sleeps alone in the depths of mist and haze. In heat and cold, the heart is warmed by the Dao and knows not summer’s heat; the heart is chilled by the Dao and knows not winter’s cold. Knowing winter’s cold, frost and ice crisp the skin yet do not alter the bearing of pines and cedars; wind and snow freeze the body yet do not change the integrity of mountains and stones. Knowing summer’s heat, scorching sun drenches one in sweat yet does not stir a mind of vexation; blazing fire burns without yet does not move within.

Roaming freely through valleys and hills, wandering boundlessly across open fields, the body moves with ease, the heart rests in stillness. I fear that beneath the city’s roofs, the clamor of voices and colors, the entanglements of dust and toil—five hues may blind the eyes, five tones deafen the ears, five desires muddy the heart. Once they enter the heart, if the heart does not admit them, they shake it by day and overturn it by night. With no anchor in the heart, one is swept away by affairs, ensnared by things.

Yet even in the mountains and wilds, is it truly different? Wildflowers and grasses may dazzle the eyes; rare birds and bright finches may captivate the ears. If one does not conceal the heart and seeks only to hide in the mountains—can this be called reclusion?

The intent of the ancient sages in retiring to the mountains was indeed thus; but the act of retiring to the mountains was not. The world rushes toward profit, customs drown in desire, sunk in the intoxication of fame and gain, dreaming in the realm of self and others—born and dying without awareness, trading sin for blessing without notice. This is what the sage grieves over, and so the sage retreats.

The sage’s grief is not grief of the heart, but grief for others; the sage’s retreat is not retreat to the mountains, but retreat of the heart. Thus, the body is but straw dogs to the form of the sentient, while gold and jade are to the nature of the sentient. It is not the form that is refined beyond the mountains, but the nature that is perfected within them. Only the sage understands this.

Do you wish to hear of the flavors of the mountains, the essence of the mountains? The mountain as mountain, the person as person—one need not necessarily hide in the mountains to retreat, nor must the mountains depend on people to exist. To dwell in the mountains, to walk in reclusion, without stirring thoughts of vexation—straw huts and bamboo cottages, grass mats and pine-wood stoves cannot make one cold; dense forests and tall bamboo, cool winds and chilled springs cannot make one hot. One laughs and wanders amidst mist and clouds, reclines and rises with wind and rain, finding joy where others cannot, attaining what others cannot attain.

There are leaves for writing, flowers for twilight. One’s zither plays the wind through the pines; one’s wine drips like rain upon stone. In stillness, the heart finds Chan; in practice, the heart is refined. One sees tigers and wolves as household swine, calls bears and rhinos as one’s servants. Solitary as the cold ape’s night cry, at ease as the white cloud’s evening flight—neither court nor world can constrain the heart, neither life nor fate can trap the will.

This is called cultivating reclusion; this is called the mountain of reclusion. Such a mountain is not the mountain of the world; such a person is not the person of the world. Person and mountain transform together, mountain and person forget each other. The person is the heart; the mountain is the heart. This heart knows not which is mountain, which is person.

It can be known yet not known by knowing; it can be seen yet not seen by seeing. The wondrous subtlety of pure truth and tranquil emptiness is neither mountain nor person. This marvel of neither mountain nor person—like the moon in the waves, like the wind in the bamboo—cannot be spoken of and obtained.

A guest said: I wish to follow these words and travel with you, Master.
The Master asked: Who are you?
The guest replied: I am Ziyuanzi.

*Record of the Realm of Constant Radiance*
Jade Toad Elder laughs amidst the wind and moon of the clear and empty capital, abiding in the desolate and secluded realm of streams and mountains. Morning feasts on rosy clouds, evening feeds on purple mist—his four great elements are at ease, his one nature is joyful. He knows not whether spring and autumn seek to chill or warm him, nor whether sun and moon seek to yin or yang him. Half-drunk, half-dreaming, half-wandering, half-stumbling.

The sky, unobstructed by healing clouds, dawn’s radiance dazzles the eyes. Suddenly, the wind through bamboo groves turns cold, dark clouds veil the light, a fine rain clears the dust—mountains darken, waters fade, birds take flight, fish hide. Soon, the gloom lifts, the weather pleases, warm as spring, crisp as autumn. Colorful clouds soar in the southern azure; within them stands a figure—wearing the cap of carefree spontaneity, the shoes of ultimate reality, the robes of emptiness and profound stillness, feasting on the food of Chan joy and Dharma bliss.

The ten eyes cannot perceive his form, the four ears cannot hear his voice. Mount Sumeru and Mount Lu cannot surpass his height, the ocean of Sarvajñā cannot encompass his intent. His steps follow flowing clouds and waters; his speech and silence are like emerald bamboo and golden blossoms.

Presently, he spoke: *"I am the Positionless True One—do you know me?"* The World-Honored One shares a womb with ants, Tuṣita and the Iron Enclosure dwell in the same realm. You may dismiss the ministers who govern hearing, discharge the officials who oversee sight, and wander with only your shadow in the land beyond yin and yang.

The old man assented. His heart became clods of earth, his form a withered tree—thus he met the True One. It seemed as though they had once met by chance, yet their bond felt as if they had never before exchanged words. The True One and the old man, staffed with the staff of no-thought, unfurled the canopy of great function manifest—walking and resting, they wandered beyond the measure of day and night, traversing some one hundred eight thousand *li*. They first crossed the mountain of the five aggregates, sailed the sea of the six desires, departed the land of ignorance, and emerged from the realm of greed and craving.

Suddenly, in a certain region, the True One said: *"This is the Land of Constant Radiant Light of Great Wisdom, the Precept Province of Dhyāna County, the Village of Nothing-Whatsoever, the Hamlet of Nirvāṇa."* The True One was the sovereign of this land. His dwelling was the Palace of the Empty Heart, the Tower of Liberation, the Pavilion of Suchness, the Terrace of Quiescence, the Palace of Perfect Enlightenment, the Hall of True Insight. In this land, the earth bore no dust or mud, the sky knew no darkness or brightness. Here, ruler and subject, father and child, sage and commoner, all sentient beings shared the same form and appearance, without surname or name. Its adornments were beyond description, its enjoyments beyond measure.

The True One rode the chariot of the five wisdoms, mounted the seven-jeweled carriage, opened the treasury of light contending with emptiness, and planted the banner of spiritual power and sovereignty. Together with the old man, he roamed beneath the Peak of Knowledge and Vision, where lay the Mysterious Cavern, the River of Compassionate Endurance, and the Forest of Merit. After a long while, they traversed the Garden of Bodhi, the Garden of No-Form, the Eightfold Returning Parks, the Fourfold Enclosure and Ponds, strolled through the Grove of Samādhi, and climbed the Mountain of the Four Truths.

When the True One wished to return, he boarded the Prajñā boat, crossed the Sea of Equality, and in less than the time it takes to snap a finger, completed the journey there and back. The Boundless True One bowed to the old man and sat in repose within the Pavilion of Pure Contention. He opened the sixfold doors and windows of supernatural powers, adorned the courtyard of myriad transformations, burned the incense of the five divisions, offered the six flavors of hunger, presented the tea of eightfold sovereignty, poured the water of the eight merits, displayed the pearl of the five eyes, revealed the seal of the one truth, set forth the torch of cessation and abiding, and lit the lamp of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving.

Suddenly, the True One vanished. The old man turned his head—his whereabouts were lost. Startled, he awakened, yet felt a sudden loss. He declared to the gods and men: *"That True One resembled my form, mirrored my will. Am I not awake? Am I not sober? Shall I forsake what is real and cling to what is illusory?"* Then, with a long sigh, he exclaimed: *"I am the True One, the True One is I. I shall depart!"*

He summoned Master Writ of the Walled City, Envoy Ink of the Pine, and commanded Clay Pot, White Qi, and others to record it, while Purple Prime wrote it down.

**Rhapsody on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**

Those who study the Dao must cultivate the golden elixir. When the body’s wood withers and the heart’s embers grow cold, to ascend to the jade towers, one must refine the golden elixir. The Qian horse and Kun ox guard Lord Ding within the sacred chamber; the Kan crow and Li hare unite the maiden with the true altar. The Scarlet Tower’s scattered officials and the Pure Court’s idle scholars command the Azure Dragon of Fusang to spread its wings and emerge from fire, while the White Tiger of Mount Hua bares its fangs and enters water.

The celestial furnace and earthen crucible are the pivot of the three passes’ transformations; the moon’s essence and sun’s spirit are a handful of yin and yang’s marrow.

The lead conceals earth within, while mercury yields gold at its core; the tortoise embodies the *zi* trigram, the serpent the *wu* image. The hare is the creature of *mao*, the rooster the fowl of *you*. The Four Symbols and Five Phases never depart from *wu*; the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams rely upon *ren*.

At dawn, it is *tun*; at dusk, it is *meng*. The six lines bear form—by night, it must return; by day, it must meet. All things, devoid of intent, thus converge the Three Essences within the Primordial Palace. The two qi ascend and descend, spiraling along the Yellow Way.

Only a single taste of mercury, once transformed, becomes black jade; thus, sevenfold refined cinnabar becomes a crimson jewel. Citron and pomegranate, fire-pear and jujube—universal white snow flutters in the pure breeze of the Purple Court, while golden blossoms fill the courtyard, veiling the auspicious herbs of the Elixir Field.

I know well what is drawn forth and what is added, where it is gathered, and where life and death reside. Waxing and waning follow their time; floating and sinking are the root of clarity and turbidity, while separation and union, motion and stillness, form their foundation. Nurture the upright to embrace the One; hold fullness and guard the feminine. None in the world can fathom this—all day they sit in stupor, knowing not where to turn.

Blessing gives rise to harm, harm to blessing; the Chamber star meets the Pleiades. The host within the guest, the guest within the host—the Dipper’s measure revolves past the Winnowing Basket. Truly, the Great Dao speaks not, and the inner elixir is no mere technique. The Mystic Pearl hangs in its image, yin enfolding yang’s virtue; the infant forms its embryo, the masculine containing the feminine essence.

Between sovereign and minister, there is first and last, regret and shame; beyond husband and wife, there is survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune. The heart resides in *ding*’s position, the bow in *gui*’s; the maiden dwells in *jia*’s palace, the Net in *geng*’s. Though punishment and virtue wax and wane, with prosperity and adversity, bathing and concealment hold no fixed certainty—only the weight of medicinal ingredients.

East, west, south, and north converge at the center; the fire-timing of city and moat unites the two, eight, nine, and three. Thus, the Dark Crow’s river chariot ascends for a hundred moments, while the Flowery Pond’s divine water flows backward through the four seasons. Constructive and defensive qi shift with the Quail Fire and Ghost Well; spirit and essence wane and wax with the Dark Void and Dipper-Ox. Mother and child swiftly cover one another; body transforms, heart transforms. Brothers fill the flute, fortune refines, wisdom refines.

The six moving lines reveal the changes of new moon, full moon, and crescent; the two solstices alter their course, bringing fears of locusts, floods, and drought. The Perfected One roams the cosmos, mastering the subtle and vast; mountains return to his grasp. Left army, right army—since ancient times, benevolence and righteousness endure. Great reclusion, small reclusion—now the palace and horn winds whisper softly, the moon shines bright. A solitary cloud, a lone crane—then a long, resonant cry. These writings are left for later students.

**Poem on the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid**
Crow and hare in the Qian-Kun crucible,
Tortoise and serpent on the *fu* and *gou* altar.
The world’s idle wanderers—
Within their hearts, the Great Return Elixir.

The White Tiger roars in water,
The Azure Dragon coils in fire.
Mercury and lead, muddy medicines gleam;
Metal and wood, snowflakes turn cold.

*Li* and *Kan* are not heart and kidney,
East and west not lung and liver.
Three phrases exhaust the seven returns,
Nine revolutions bring forth the Mud Pill.

**Song of the Dao’s Mystic Pivot**
Have you not seen—
A single grain of golden elixir, how resplendently red,
Large as a pellet, bright as a tangerine?
Each person’s share is originally perfect,
Nightly, its numinous light fills the Spirit Chamber.

The Spirit Chamber is this numinous terrace,
Within it, the embryo of endless life.
The Primordial Lord calls it the Crescent Moon Furnace,
Within the furnace, the medicine mirrors the Three Terraces.

At first, one father faces one mother;
Afterward, three sons and three daughters.
At dawn, *tun*; at dusk, *meng*—sovereign and minister.
By night, *fu*; by day, *gou*—guest and host.

The azure-clad maiden rides the Azure Dragon,
While the White Tiger accompanies the Golden Elder.
The Three Flowers blaze in the Divine Empyrean,
Twin cranes linger at the Palace of the Great One.

All comes from metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—
How much suffering in birth, aging, sickness, and death?
But teach benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust,
And naturally, the five tones align.

From *zi* to *si*: *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Qian*;
From *wu* to *hai*: *Xun*, *Gen*, *Kun*.
*Kan* and *Li* are the palaces of union,
*Mao* and *you* their gates of entry and exit.

The Chamber, Void, Encouragement, and Star stand through the four seasons;
The two equinoxes and two solstices open and close.
If you observe the undivided chaos before separation,
You will see the true playfulness of creation.

Who knows the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid
Lies only in the daily use of the present person?
I reveal the essence of elixir refinement:
Neither bustling city nor quiet mountain—

The elixir’s head was originally knotted before birth,
Pure, wondrous, luminous, and radiant.
Externally, it is neither cinnabar nor sulfur;
Internally, it is neither essence nor blood.

Fire and medicine originally dwell in one place—
Seeming to exist when observed, vanishing when sought.
I teach you to be silent as a fool all day,
Refining a single wish-fulfilling pearl.

The true gold of the Great Crucible never changes hue,
Yet how can it be found amid the dust?
Born and dying countless times,
Thus, now we practice refinement.

Clearly, it is gold within unformed water—
Seek it intently in the Flowery Pond.
Eight ounces of gold, eight ounces of water—
One floats, one sinks.

Gather the Five Phases within *geng* and *jia*;
The Four Symbols and Five Phases must harmonize.
At midnight, the Golden Crow enters the Broad Cold,
White as lard, yellow as wax.

The essence of metal and the fluid of wood are fundamentally empty—
Tender, they must be gathered; aged, they wither.
When hot, the *kun* fire is slightly buried;
When cold, the *xun* wind blows gently.

Within stillness, one movement; within movement, one stillness.
Within stillness, one illumination; within illumination, one use.

The wind-blown willow is true lead,
The rain-washed peach blossom is true mercury.
The Three Passes creak with the Purple River Chariot,
The Nine Cauldrons gleam with golden sand.

The Purple Court’s Dark Tortoise feeds on white snow,
The Elixir Field’s Vermilion Phoenix pecks at yellow sprouts.
The moon in the sky, the tide in the earth—
Their waxing and waning respond to fullness and emptiness.

This is the mechanism of drawing forth and adding,
The very bones of creation in the void.

Know well the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source—
The subtle interplay of mutual generation and conquest.
Seize the celestial mechanism to achieve great work—
The month within the year, the hour within the day.

When at last it is forged into a single mass,
I ask you, do you understand?

Neither increase nor decrease—why speak of drawing forth and adding?
Neither departure nor arrival—why speak of advance and retreat?
Waxing and waning, decline and flourishing come in their own time,
As punishment and virtue stand at the gate, now even, now odd.

When the elixir is complete, you must bathe it;
Defend the city, wage war in the wilds—beware of peril.
To nurture the infant, rely solely on the mother;
For seven returns and nine reversions, know well the master.

One line firm, one line yielding,
One phase civil, one phase martial.
In but a moment’s work, the refining is done,
Yet a year’s fire-tending begins the embryo’s gestation.

Nine ascents, nine returns make nine revolutions,
Thunder’s roar shakes gods and ghosts alike.
The elixir’s work takes but ten months—
Gradually gathered, gradually refined, gradually congealed.
Three years, nine years, and at last it matures,
Begetting sons and grandsons by the hundreds of millions.

Long ago, reading the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*,
I found the turning of dragon and tiger therein hard to fathom.
Songs, poems, and concordant treatises I searched through all,
Yet still the golden elixir’s learning remained unmastered.

In the spring of the *dingchou* year of Jiading,
A Daoist with unkempt hair appeared,
Slipping into my sleeve a scroll—
Each word a golden elixir’s secret.
After the Daoist departed, he vanished without trace,
Leaving no sign in the northern seas or Cangwu’s peaks.
I asked others of his form and bearing—
They said this was the Old Man of the White Toad.

Alas for those in the world who seek immortality!
Clinging to images, grasping at texts, they mistake the false.
How could they know one thing ever abides with them?
Round or treacherous, steep or flushed—ever radiant.
Returning with the secret, I tested the refining—
Dragon and tiger clashed in but a moment’s time.

Those who know it in the Nineflower Heavens,
One night’s wind and thunder shake ten thousand mountains.
I dwell by the Luojiang’s shores,
Where bright moon and clear wind are inexhaustible treasures.

Idly I compose this *Song of the Great Dao*,
To serve as a model for the people of this age.
Not yet speaking of immortality through elixir-refining,
First seek the body’s firmness to prolong the years.
If one may yet have a share in ascension,
Then, faint and distant, a white crane mounts the azure sky.

Here ends the *Collected Questions on the Dao* of Haiqiong.
