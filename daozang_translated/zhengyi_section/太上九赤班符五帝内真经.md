**The Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of the Nine Crimson Talismans and the Five Emperors’ Inner Realms**

The Nine Crimson Talismans, also called the *Nine Aerial Talismans of the Feathered Central Grove*, were concealed by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning within the Golden Chamber and Jade Abode of the Jasper Terrace of Supreme Clarity. Their divine radiance blazes forth, streaming light that illumines the void; the Four Poles oversee their trial, and the Five Emperors guard their authenticity.

The Supreme Lord appointed three hundred Jade Lads of the Cloud Palace, while the Upper Prime further assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence to attend and preserve this numinous writ. Its divine standard marks Supreme Clarity, its majesty commands the Nine Heavens; it subdues demons and dispels defilement, beheads legions of malevolence, seals and governs the sacred mountains, summons and commands the spirits of waters. It oversees boundless multitudes, encompasses the myriad immortals, and with the Five Peaks, the Four Abysses, and the bodies of later disciples, it deploys divine soldiers to punish transgressions and reward merit.

Every nine thousand years, the Nine Heavens open once; when the Nine Heavens open, this scripture illuminates the chambers of the Five Peaks, mysteriously bestowed upon those who attain the Dao. Without immortal bones or jade names inscribed for future lives, none may behold its passages. Those who obtain its text become masters and patriarchs of the Five Peaks, sovereigns of the Four Seas. Those who uphold it bring blessings to the souls of seven generations of ancestors and spread fortune to nine kinds of kin. Those who cultivate it ascend to become lofty immortals of Supreme Clarity.

The Nine Crimson Talismans are the flying, mysterious feathered chapters of the *qi* of the Nine Primes, coalesced into jade script. The primordial text was transmitted by the human realm to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning transmitted it to the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen; the Supreme Lord transmitted it to the Great Emperor of Fusang; the Great Emperor transmitted it to the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity; the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity transmitted it to the Later Sage Emperor of the Golden Portals; and thence to the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad. The Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen transmitted it to Master Hongya and the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate.

Transmission of *qi* follows in succession, each inscribed on golden tablets, bound with purple cords, encased in cloud-brocade satchels, sealed with the seals of the Three Primes, stored in dark and verdant caskets, and concealed within the chambers of the Nine Bends. Jade immortals offer incense, Mount Taihua holds the towels; the Four Directors oversee its radiance, the Five Emperors guard its carriage. The Three Primes observe the rites, the myriad immortals pay homage to the Perfected. Its Dao is most wondrous; according to the regulations, it is transmitted once every seven thousand years. To lightly divulge or expose it, or transmit it to the unworthy, brings the seven generations of ancestors to trial and causes the disciple’s body to perish in the river’s source.

Later disciples who diligently concentrate their minds, seek immortality with utmost sincerity, and resonate with the dark virtue of the Great Void, aligning with the mysterious emergence of the Three Primes, will naturally encounter and obtain this text. Only upon receiving and wearing the true talismans may one traverse the mysterious peaks, entrust one’s body to the secluded mountains, command the Nine Crimson to seal the mounds, summon the Five Agents to invoke spirits, dispatch the Water Emperor to erase transgressions, and gather the numina of the seas to open the sources. Thus, the ledgers of sins are obliterated in the Nine Treasuries, and the records of life are inscribed in the Three Clarities. *Qi* shakes the dark waves, majesty subdues the myriad spirits; demonic hosts are vanquished in trial, immortal officials descend in form. Wielding the tally of the Six Jia, one commands the celestial soldiers; penetrating the obscure and fathoming the subtle, one perceives the yet-unborn. Thus may one attain divine transcendence and soar through Supreme Clarity.

Those who study without encountering the *Nine Aerial Talismans of the Feathered Central Grove* will not receive the mysterious names of the Five Peaks, nor will the water spirits of the Four Seas erase their ledgers of sins or inscribe their names in the Three Clarities. When wandering through rivers and marshes or dwelling in secluded mountains without wearing this text, mountain spirits and celestial demons will test and thwart their aspirations, myriad harms will arise of themselves, and they will never attain immortality. The Water Emperor will compile their transgressions and present them to the Emperor of Judgment.

**The Five Peaks’ Five Emperors’ Inner Method of Transforming True Forms to Seek Immortality**

When entering the Eastern Peak, visualize the Azure Emperor of the East. If upon closing the eyes one immediately perceives his true form, that person’s five palaces will coalesce *qi*, the six viscera will generate the Perfected, the nine treasuries will become luminously clear, and internally, no obstructions will remain. Harmonious tones will resound, and wondrous principles will become lucid and penetrating—such a person possesses the talent of a superior immortal. Thus, the Dao will descend at once, and divine luminaries will respond in resonance; such a one will attain immortality without delay.

If one sees azure *qi* flourishing and dense, it is the *qi* of the upright spirit of that direction, reflecting in emptiness—this indicates gradual progress on the Dao. If one sees black *qi*, it is the office of the Perfected of one’s original life reflecting in emptiness, overseeing the trial of one’s body. If one sees red *qi*, it is the *qi* of the office of cavernous generation reflecting in emptiness, coming to guard one’s body. If one sees yellow *qi*, it is the *qi* of the office dispatched by the Peak reflecting in emptiness, coming to assist one in communicating with the Perfected. None of these should be feared; proceed according to the original method, and in time, the Dao will naturally respond and descend.

If one sees white *qi*, it is the essence of celestial demons in the void, coming to test one’s body. One should strike the left teeth thirty-six times and recite the *Golden Mystery Chapter* once; then the demonic essence will vanish of itself, and the Perfected will naturally descend.

When entering the Southern Peak, visualize the Vermilion Emperor of the South. If upon closing the eyes one immediately perceives his true form, that person’s bones will coalesce jade frost, *qi* will interpenetrate the divine palace, the cinnabar terrace will inscribe the tablets, and the purple chapters will be bound into records. Profoundly awakened to the dark path, one roams freely in the empty courtyard, encounters all things without obstruction, and through tranquil contemplation, resonates with the Perfected—such a person possesses the talent of a superior immortal. Thus, the Dao will descend at once, and divine luminaries will respond in resonance; such a one will attain immortality without delay.

If one sees red *qi*, it is the *qi* of the upright spirit of that direction reflecting in emptiness—this indicates gradual progress on the Dao. If one sees azure *qi*, it is the office of the Perfected of one’s original life reflecting in emptiness, coming to oversee the trial of one’s body. If one sees yellow *qi*, it is the office of cavernous generation reflecting in emptiness, coming to guard one’s body. If one sees white *qi*, it is the *qi* of the office dispatched by the Southern Peak reflecting in emptiness, coming to assist one’s body in communicating with the Perfected.

There is nothing strange in this—proceed according to the fundamental practice, and in time the Dao will naturally respond and descend.

If one sees black *qi*, it is the essence of the Great Demon of the Void coming to test the authenticity of the adept’s truth. The adept should strike the left teeth thirty-six times and recite the Mystic Chapter’s demon-quelling incantation once, whereupon the demonic essence will vanish of itself and the true form will descend.

When entering the Western Marchmount, meditate upon the White Thearch of the West; if upon closing the eyes one immediately perceives the true form, such a person possesses a golden palace within the chest, where the Six Palaces receive the Perfected. They penetrate the obscure and commune with the numinous, revolving and releasing the Mystic Origin. Within, there is no obstruction; without, no dust of desire. Thus their name is inscribed in the Golden Register and recorded in the Upper Clarity—such a one possesses the talent of a superior immortal. Therefore, the Dao will descend at once, and divine luminaries will respond in resonance; such a one will attain immortality without delay.

If one sees black *qi*, it is the *qi* of the office of cavernous generation reflecting in emptiness, coming to guard one’s body. If one sees azure *qi*, it is the *qi* of the office dispatched by the Western Marchmount reflecting in emptiness, coming to assist one’s body in communicating with the Perfected. There is nothing strange in this—proceed according to the fundamental practice, and in time the Perfected will naturally respond and descend.

If one sees red *qi*, it is the essence of the Great Demon of the Void coming to test the authenticity of the adept’s truth. The adept should strike the left teeth thirty-six times and recite the Golden Mystic Chapter’s demon-quelling incantation once, whereupon the demonic essence will vanish of itself and the true form will descend.

When entering the Northern Marchmount, meditate upon the Black Thearch of the North; if upon closing the eyes one immediately perceives the true form, such a person possesses a mysterious stem rising at dawn, with the five centers interlinked. Their *qi* ascends to the Purple Heaven, their name is inscribed in the Northern Mysteries, and their tally is carved in the Azure Palace. They illumine the obscure chamber, penetrate the numinous, and reach the subtle—such a one possesses the talent of a superior immortal. Therefore, the Dao will descend at once, and divine luminaries will respond in resonance; such a one will attain immortality without delay.

If one sees black *qi*, it is the *qi* of the upright spirit of that direction reflecting in emptiness—this indicates gradual progress on the Dao.

When entering the Central Marchmount, meditate upon the Yellow Thearch of the Center; if upon closing the eyes one immediately perceives the true form, such a person possesses a cinnabar palace generating radiance, where the Red Child receives the immortal. They govern the obscure and resolve obstructions, savoring the luminous clarity of the empyrean. Their name is inscribed in the Thearch’s chamber, and their image is charted in the Three Origins—such a one possesses the talent of a superior immortal. Therefore, the Dao will descend at once, and divine luminaries will respond in resonance; such a one will attain immortality without delay.

**The Supreme Method of Inscribing Names in the Five Marchmounts to Determine Immortal Rank**
*The Nine Vermilion Talismans for Pacifying the Marchmounts and Seeking Immortal Rank*

**The Nine Qi Rank Talisman of the Azure Emperor of the Eastern Marchmount, with Inner Visualization of Jia-Yi Entering Wood**

The Azure Emperor Lord of the East, surnamed Chang, personal name Jingmeng, wears the Nine Origins Heaven-Penetrating Crown upon his head. His robe is of azure brocade with jade-green flying skirts, and he bears the Supreme Nine Qi Life-Spirit Seal. His sash is woven of kingfisher plumes and interlaced with numinous cords.

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), he rides a cloud-chariot drawn by nine azure dragons, accompanied by twelve Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, each holding a nine-colored staff and banner of the Azure Grove. He traverses the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, reviewing the registers of Perfected Ones and Immortal Officials. At times, he visits the Water Emperor of the Eastern Sea to audit the merits, transgressions, and sins of those who study the Dao. Upon his return, he descends to bestow talismans upon the adept’s body.

The practitioner ingests this talisman to summon his presence, visualizes his *qi* to induce the descent of his Perfected form, and seeks to have their name expunged from the Water Emperor’s ledgers and inscribed in the Jade Registers.

On the day of *Lichun* at dawn, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Ingest the *Nine Qi Rank Talisman of Jia-Yi Entering Wood*, strike the teeth nine times, and visualize the Azure Emperor Lord of the East: surnamed Chang, personal name Jingmeng, clad in his robes and colors, descending in his azure-cloud chariot into the adept’s chamber. Azure *qi* billows densely, filling the room and encircling the adept’s form.

Within the Azure Emperor’s *qi*, visualize a crimson radiance transforming, like the essence of Jupiter, blazing and luminous. It descends from the crown of the head into the adept’s body, its brilliance illuminating the liver. Draw in the *qi* and swallow nine times, sensing warmth suffusing the body. Soon, the crimson light scatters within and emerges from the nine orifices, coalescing above the adept’s head into azure clouds. The adept feels their body within the clouds, ascending with them.

After a long while, the perception stabilizes, as if treading empty space. Then recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Supreme Cinnabar, myriad purifications,
Revolving to seal the nine gates.
Mysterious Void uplifts the Perfected,
Crimson ranks swiftly divide.
Bearing Jia to enter Wood,
Riding Yi to command clouds.
Above, govern the Five Marchmounts,
Seal mounds and summon mountains.
Below, proclaim to the Nine Rivers,
Twelve water sources.
Erase the old ledgers,
Inscribe in the Jade Chapters.
Record my Perfected form,
Azure Emperor Lord,
Descend with me in azure radiance,
Flying azure feathered skirts,
Merge with the Emperor’s light,
Petition the Jade Dawn."*

Conclude by striking the teeth twelve times and swallowing saliva twenty-four times.

Practicing this for nine years enables one to inscribe talismans and cast them into mountains, summoning clouds and rain, obscuring the sky in darkness. Casting talismans into water causes dragons to rise from the depths. Among people, inscribing talismans on wood renders the script indelible, its characters growing ever brighter. Carrying the talisman while embracing a tree transforms the body into a mountain forest, guarded by twelve Immortal Officials of the Eastern Marchmount.

After eighteen years, one can ascend to the Upper Clarity in flight.

Revealing this method carelessly invokes ghostly soldiers as punishment, extending calamity to seven generations, and the body will perish in the river’s source.

**The Nine Qi Rank Talisman of Jia-Yi Entering Wood**
Inscribe in vermilion. On the day of *Lichun* at dawn, face east to ingest it, reciting the incantation as above.

Additionally, on the days of *Jia-yin* and *Yi-mao* in the first and second months, write in azure ink on paulownia wood, nine inches wide and twelve inches long. Bury it nine feet deep at the Eastern Marchmount of one’s dwelling. *Jia* and *Yi* occur only once a year; thus, perform this ritual once every three years, not annually. However, the visualization and ingestion should follow the seasonal nodes, and after nine years, the response will invariably descend.

This is also called the *White Feather Central Grove Flying Heaven Nine Talismans*, or the *Nine Transformations, Three Unions, Becoming One*. Those who behold its scripture attain the same Perfection as the Five Emperors.

On the day of burying the talisman, face east and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize azure *qi* clouds crowning a mountain, filling the space above and below in dense obscurity.

The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, rides a nine-colored dragon, wielding a jade-green feathered banner, accompanied by twelve Immortal Officials of Mount Tai. Within the azure *qi*, they oversee and reflect upon the adept’s body. Recite while looking upward:

*"Heaven communicates with earthly principles,
The two *qi* merge with the Perfected.
Nine crimson yang luminaries,
Four seasons unfold in order.
Above, the Five Emperors open,
The Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai.
Below, proclaim to the myriad spirits,
The boundless deities.
Expunge my past transgressions,
Record this chapter of mine.
Eradicate demonic trials,
Enable my ascension as an Immortal.
Bestow honors upon the numinous Marchmount,
Merge with *qi* in mist.
Summon clouds and descend rain,
Fly through azure skies in a chariot.
Ascend into the Mysterious Void,
Before the August Emperor."*

Conclude by burying the talisman as prescribed, then draw in and swallow the azure *qi* thirty-six times.

The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, regularly on the day of *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), presents the registers of Perfected Immortals who have attained the Dao and those newly studying it, reporting to the August Emperor Lord on High to review the Mysterious Names.

To cultivate the Dao of Flying Immortals, on that day at the hour of *Chen* (7–9 AM), bathe, fast, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face east and visualize the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai: surnamed Xuanqiu, personal name Mulu, wearing the Three Treasures Nine Radiance Night Crown, clad in azure feathered skirts and a nine-colored patterned robe, bearing the Supreme August Life-Spirit Seal. He rides a flying chariot of azure clouds drawn by nine azure dragons, accompanied by twelve Immortal Officials, each holding the Five Sacred Fungi. They circle northeast, ascending to the boundless heights of the Jade Clarity Heaven, wandering within the azure clouds of the Mysterious Void.

Recite while striking the teeth nine times:

*"Today, at the supreme seasonal node,
Eight vows unfold anew.
May the divine melody revolve,
Descend to my realm.
Receive my supplications,
Present my petitions.
Inscribe my name in the Jade Registers,
Rank me in the Purple Chapters.
May the Dao Lord reflect upon me,
That I attain Upper Immortality."*

Conclude the visualization as the Lord of Mount Tai descends in his chariot, azure *qi* billowing densely to fill the chamber. He stands within the azure *qi*, holding a green bamboo slip, inscribing the adept’s name upon it. Softly recite:

*"Jade Perfected wandering,
Radiant in the East.
Riding dragons, driving chariots,
Flying through the Great Void.
Revolving numinous melodies,
Descend to my chamber.
Azure yang proclaims the beginning,
Supreme vows unfold.
Receive my petitions,
Expunge transgressions, record merits.
Inscribe my name on the green bamboo slip,
Present it to the August Emperor.
The Western Tortoise binds the records,
The Eastern Flower engraves the directions.
Five Numinous Ones assist,
Eight Emperors shine together.
Bearing Jia, riding Yi,
Exiting Wood to enter emptiness.
Six Ding spirits attend,
Jade maidens support.
Command mountains, summon seas,
Govern dragons.
Whistle to summon wind, raise clouds,
All obeys instantly.
Heavenly demons submit to trials,
Myriad spirits revere and follow.
Transform the luminous body,
Ascend to the Jade Palace.
Yearly offerings at Mount Tai,
Eternal preservation without end."*

When finished, raise the head and swallow the nine qi to conclude.

After nine years of cultivation, the Lord of Mount Tai will manifest before the practitioner, descending upon clouds of azure qi, bestowing nine divine youths and naturally occurring spirit-mushrooms, enabling knowledge of affairs ten thousand *li* to the east. After eighteen years, one attains a dragon chariot, riding the void to ascend to the Jade Pure Palace.

**Southern Marchmount’s Red Emperor: Internal Contemplation of Bing-Ding Entering Fire, Three Qi Mottled Talisman**
The Red Emperor of the South, surnamed Yan, personal name Dongdan, wears a precious crown of three qi and dark beams, a crimson cloud-brocade robe with cinnabar-patterned skirts, bears the Southern Culmen’s talisman for restraining yang, and girds the Eight Radiance Sword of the Vermilion Palace. On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), he rides a chariot of scarlet mist-wheels, accompanied by twelve Jade Maidens of Great Cinnabar, each mounted on nine-colored phoenixes and holding the three qi blossoms of solar essence. They roam Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount, reviewing the registers of perfected ones and immortals, as well as the names of learners, then proceed to the Water Emperor and Divine King of the Southern Sea to audit the merits, transgressions, and faults of those who study the Dao. Upon returning, they descend to the bodies of those who bear the talisman.

Learners who ingest this talisman summon its spirit, visualize its qi to draw down its authenticity, erase their names from the Water Emperor’s records, and inscribe them in the jade registers. At high noon on *Lixia*, bathe, purify, and fast, then enter the chamber to burn incense. Ingest the Bing-Ding Entering Fire Three Qi Mottled Talisman, knock the teeth thrice, and visualize the Red Emperor’s personal name and attire, his scarlet mist-wheel chariot descending into one’s chamber. Scarlet qi blazes, filling the room and encircling one’s form. Visualize the Emperor within the scarlet qi transforming into the Radiant Deluder Star, its brilliance illuminating as it descends from the crown of the head into the body, its light pervading the heart’s palace. Draw in qi and swallow thrice, feeling the body suffused with warmth. Soon, the Radiant Deluder Star disperses from the heart into scarlet qi, exiting through the nine orifices and reuniting above the crown to form a scarlet cloud. Sense the body within this cloud, ascending with it. After a long while, the perception stabilizes, as if treading emptiness. Raise the head and pray:

*"Three qi return to the origin,
Soaring to the Nine Purities of Heaven.
White feathers in the central grove,
Entering the subtle and numinous.
Girded with Bing’s radiance,
Riding fire to enter Ding.
Central perfection merges as one,
Transforming into the luminous star above.
Commanding the ten thousand qi,
Sealing mountains and summoning spirits.
Talismans bind the nine rivers,
Twelve water spirits.
Erasing the nine yin,
Names from the old registers.
Raising clouds, descending dragons,
Crimson chariots of the cinnabar heavens.
Eight effulgences swiftly traverse the void,
Flowing fire darkens the gloom.
Flying wheels and purple canopies,
Convey my form,
Treading the void, stepping the floating.
Ascending to the Jade Court,
Receiving refinement in the Cavern Yang.
Five spirits shine brightly,
Eternally enjoying celestial longevity,
Merging with the Emperor."*

When finished, knock the teeth nine times and swallow saliva twelve times to conclude.

After nine years of practice, one can inscribe talismans and cast them into forests, which spontaneously ignite; cast them into water, and dragons surface; cast them into mountains, and clouds and rain descend. Bearing the talisman, one enters fire unscathed. Burying it at the Southern Marchmount secures immortal officials to attend and guard the body. After eighteen years, one can fly and ascend to the Jade Pure Palace.

Revealing this Dao lightly brings calamity upon seven generations, consigning the body to the offices of ghosts, eternally confined in earth prisons, barred from attaining immortality.

**The Supreme Bing-Ding Entering Fire Three Qi Mottled Talisman** is written in vermilion. Ingest it at high noon on *Lixia*, facing south, with prayers as above. Additionally, on *Bingwu* or *Dingwei* days in the fourth or fifth month, write it in vermilion on paulownia wood, eight *cun* wide and one *chi* two *cun* long, and bury it eight *chi* deep at the Southern Marchmount of one’s dwelling. *Bing* and *Ding* share a single day; perform this burial once every three years, not annually. Merely visualizing, ingesting, and practicing according to the seasons for nine years will ensure the Red Emperor and the Lord of Mount Heng manifest before the practitioner.

This is called the **Threefold Union Attaining Dao Nine Perfected Middle Talisman**, also known as the **Ninefold Union Entering Subtle Dark Void Seven Transformations**. Those who behold its script attain the perfection of the Five Emperors and ascend as immortals.

When burying the talisman, face south, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and visualize scarlet qi clouds crowning a mountain. The Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount rides a cloud chariot drawn by scarlet dragons, holding a vermilion feathered tally, accompanied by twelve immortals of Mount Heng within the scarlet qi, overseeing the practitioner’s body. Raise the head and pray:

*"Cinnabar numen, Cavern Yang,
Above governing Heaven’s Conjunction.
Nine transformations, three unions,
Thus forming the Dao’s palace.
Scarlet effulgent talisman,
Might ruling the ten thousand directions.
Today, the supreme tally,
Three qi open the passage.
Connecting the Five Emperors above,
Announcing the script to the numinous peak.
Erasing my past debts,
Inscribing my name in the August Emperor’s registers.
May my Dao be accomplished,
Transforming the mysterious void.
Sealing the numinous marchmounts,
Summoning the sea and commanding dragons.
Raising clouds, descending rain,
All directions instantly obey.
Flying through the heavens in scarlet wheels,
Ascending to the Emperor’s chamber.
Eight qi merge with effulgences,
Three origins shine together."*

When finished, bury the talisman as prescribed, then raise the head and swallow scarlet qi twenty-four times to conclude.

The Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount, on the summer festival day, presents the registers of perfected immortals, those who have attained the Dao, and beginners to the Supreme Emperor, reviewing the mysterious names and distinguishing merits from faults.

To cultivate the Dao of flying immortality, at noon on that day, bathe, purify, and fast, then enter the chamber to burn incense. Face south and visualize the Lord of Mount Heng, surnamed Yan, personal name Yangguang, wearing an Eight Brilliances Precious Radiance Jade Crown, a crimson brocade flying skirt, and a divine radiance crimson-patterned robe, bearing the talisman for sealing spirits and restraining demons. He rides a scarlet mist flying wheel, accompanied by twelve immortals of the Southern Marchmount, each mounted on flying phoenixes and holding spirit-mushrooms. They circle the southeast, ascending to the boundless heights of the Jade Pure Heaven, roaming the void within scarlet clouds.

At this moment, strike the teeth three times and silently recite: "Today is most auspicious, the perfect hour for perfected beings. May the mysterious vow descend universally, renewing all beneath heaven. I beseech the Dao Lord to turn and send down the flying immortals, their feathered canopies descending upon my body. As the Dao Lord descends, I become an imperial minister, my name inscribed in the Upper Clarity, my destiny bound to the Eastern Flower."

When finished, visualize the Lord of Mount Heng riding his scarlet mist flying wheel, descending into your chamber. Crimson qi billows densely, filling the room. The Lord stands amidst the crimson qi, holding a vermilion tablet, inscribing your name upon its register. He softly intones:

"Vermilion guts ride the dawn, circling the Nine Heavens.
Cinnabar chariot and flying canopy, radiant through the rosy void.
Curving downward to illuminate, overseeing my heart’s devotion.
All vows I present shall move the unseen.
Unfurl the numinous guard, body and spirit in communion.
Inscribe my name on the Cinnabar Terrace, bind my script to Southern Jade.
Six Bing days escort the perfected, riding Ding to enter the whirlwind.
Command mountains and seal seas, restrain the myriad calamities.
A thousand spirits cower, all demons disperse.
As the Southern Marchmount is grasped, the Three Origins summon me.
Descend with the vermilion carriage, ascend into the imperial court.
The Three Luminaries unite in power, outlasting heaven’s decay."

When finished, raise your head and swallow the qi three times to conclude.

Practice this for nine years, and the Lord of Mount Heng will bestow upon you a treasure script, along with eight immortal officials, and grant rare spirit-mushrooms and wondrous objects, enabling you to know all affairs within ten thousand *li* of the south.

Practice for eighteen years, and you will attain the scarlet cloud wheel, soaring through the great void to ascend to the Jade Pure Palace.

**Western Marchmount White Emperor: Ingesting Metal Qi of Geng and Xin, the Seven Qi Talisman**

The Western White Emperor, surnamed Hun, personal name Rugui, wears a Seven Qi Bright Radiance Precious Crown, a white brocade cloud-light robe and plain silk flying skirt, and bears a jade-white divine sash and a dragon-tide-drooling sword.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, he rides a plain cloud flying chariot, accompanied by twelve Jade Maidens of Great Simplicity. Each holds a seven-colored flower banner, and they roam the Western Marchmount Mount Hua, reviewing the registers of perfected beings and immortal officials, as well as the names of disciples. At times, they visit the Water Emperor and Divine King of the Western Sea to examine the merits, faults, and transgressions of those who cultivate the Dao. They then descend to bestow talismans upon the practitioners.

Disciples who ingest this talisman to summon the deity should visualize the qi to attract the true essence, erasing their names from the Water Emperor’s tablets and inscribing them upon the jade registers.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn at dusk, bathe, purify, and fast, then enter the chamber to burn incense. Ingest the *Geng-Xin Entering Metal Seven Qi Talisman*, strike the teeth three times, and visualize the Western White Emperor’s name and attire, his form and colors. See him riding a purple cloud flying chariot, descending into your chamber. White qi shimmers brilliantly, filling the room and encircling your body.

Visualize the Emperor within the white qi transforming into the Great White Star, blazing with radiance. It descends from the crown of your head into your body, its light illuminating the space between your lungs. Then draw in the qi and swallow it seven times, feeling your body grow warm. Soon, the Great White Star within your lungs scatters into white qi, emerging from the nine orifices and reuniting above your head, forming a white cloud. Feel your body within the cloud, ascending with it. After a long while, the sensation stabilizes, as if treading empty space. Raise your head and intone:

"Seven qi fly as essence, Western Flower’s metal spirit.
Dragon transforms the nine paths, all things arise of themselves.
Sun and moon pass in measure, flying feathers traverse the dark.
Mysterious void and profound truth, three unite and seven complete.
Transformation enters the luminous, Xin turns the radiant star.
The Emperor’s name and talisman merge, transforming my form.
I uphold the imperial might, commanding divine soldiers.
Restrain mountains and inspect seas, seal peaks and command spirits.
All perfected beings come, receiving duties at my court.
Summon clouds and raise rain, descend with the plain carriage.
Nine dragons and seven tigers, driving the Six Ding.
Hasten my flying tiger, exiting the mysterious and entering the azure.
Ascend to the vermilion moon, gold refines and brightens.
Roam the Flowery Hall, eternally preserving the celestial scriptures."

When finished, strike the teeth seven times and swallow saliva thirty-two times to conclude.

Practice this for nine years, and you will be able to inscribe your name upon stone, refine stone into gold, and cast talismans into stone to conceal your form. Cast talismans into mountains, and they will send down plain clouds; cast them into water, and dragons will rise from the depths. Bury talismans in the Western Marchmount, and immortal officials will be granted, bestowing natural and wondrous objects.

After eighteen years of practice, you will be able to ride the void and ascend to the Jade Pure Heaven.

Revealing this Dao lightly will incur punishment by divine soldiers. Your seven generations of ancestors will suffer torment, bound to serve as ghost officials. Guard this secret in your cultivation, and you shall attain the rank of highest immortal.

**The Supreme Geng-Xin Entering Metal Seven Qi Talisman**
Write in vermilion. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn at dusk, face west and ingest it, reciting the incantation as above.

Also, on the days of Gengshen and Xinyou in the seventh and eighth months, write in vermilion on paulownia wood, six *cun* wide and one *chi* two *cun* long. Bury it six *chi* deep in the Western Marchmount where you reside. Geng and Xin occur only once a day; bury it once every three years, not annually. Simply visualize, ingest, and practice according to the proper times. After nine years, the White Emperor and the Lord of Mount Hua will descend without fail to appear before you.

This is also called *Nine Subtleties Entering the Spirit and Sealing the Numinous*, or *Red and White Self-Generating Seven Transformations Golden Gate*. Those who obtain this Dao will have the Queen Mother of the West descend in truth, myriad transformations instantly accomplished, and ascend to the ranks of imperial spirits.

When burying the talisman, face west and strike the teeth twelve times. Visualize white qi clouds crowning a mountain, and the Lord of Mount Hua riding a white dragon cloud chariot, holding a seven-colored flying feathered staff. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials of Mount Hua, they stand within the white qi, overseeing and illuminating your body. Raise your head and intone:

"Six qi circle in spirit, three unite as one.
Five clouds transform, turning nine and seven.
The Emperor’s honor merges, spirit born in the golden chamber.
At this time, what time is it? The day of my highest vow.
All I seek shall be most auspicious.
Command spirits and summon deities, all demons follow in destruction.
Eight paths scatter in brightness, my true self serene.
The Five Marchmounts bow in reverence, completing the audience with the Emperor."

When finished, bury the talisman as prescribed, then look upward and swallow white qi twenty-four times to conclude.

On the autumn equinox, the Lord of Mount Hua presents to the Supreme High Emperor a register of perfected immortals who have attained the Dao, along with the names of those newly embarked on the path. He examines their mystical names and distinguishes their merits and transgressions.

To cultivate the way of flying immortality, on that day at dusk, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Face west and visualize the Lord of Mount Hua, whose surname is Haoqiu and whose given name is Yuancang. He wears a six-fold spirit-communing flying crown, a white brocade flying skirt, and a plain silk robe, girded with an intertwined spirit-silk sash. Riding a cloud-borne flying wheel, accompanied by the twelve immortal officials of Mount Hua—each mounted on a white tiger and holding a seven-colored floral banner—they circle to the southwest, ascending to the boundless Jade Purity Heaven, drifting amidst the void within white clouds.

Strike the teeth seven times and silently intone: "I vow to become a flying immortal, to ascend to Jade Purity, to soar into Mount Hua, and to share the numinous power of the Emperor. I beseech the Dao Lord to descend my true form, to grant me immortality, and to inscribe my mystical name."

When done, visualize the Lord of Mount Hua descending to your chamber in a white-cloud flying wheel, white qi resplendent, filling the room. He stands within the white qi, holding a white tablet, and inscribes your name upon its surface. Softly intone:

"Golden gates gleam bright, white clouds tower high.
Four gatherings merge in truth, eight qi weave their net.
Auspicious dawn is proclaimed, the Emperor’s spirit ascends in mist.
Turn and descend in spirit, graciously regard my home.
Inscribe my name upon the white tablet, record it in the Western Hua.
The Seven Perfected and host of immortals command and restrain demons,
Uphold the August Might, govern mountains and rivers,
Summon clouds and send down rain, dragon wheels swiftly pass.
Convey me through the void, ascending to the Numinous Mound.
What I desire is instantly achieved, what I sever is at once undone.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, penetrating the radiance of the mystical mist."

When finished, look upward and swallow qi seven times to conclude. After nine years of practice, the Lord of Mount Hua will bestow upon you the elixir of immortality and assign seven immortal youths. In nine years, you will comprehend affairs a myriad miles to the west and discern the omens of fortune and misfortune. After eighteen years, a white-cloud wheel will descend, enabling you to soar through the great void and ascend to the Jade Purity Palace.

**Northern Marchmount Black Emperor: Ingesting Ren-Gui Water Qi and the Five Qi Talisman**

The Black Emperor of the North, whose surname is Xuan and whose given name is Shuomeng, wears a five-qi dark-morning crown, a black brocade robe with a five-colored flying skirt, a seven-fold flowing bell, and a spirit-communing sword inscribed with talismanic patterns.

On the day of the beginning of winter, he rides a dark-cloud flying chariot, accompanied by the twelve Jade Maidens of Great Mystery, each mounted on a flying turtle and holding a five-colored floral banner. They traverse the Northern Marchmount Mount Heng, reviewing the registers of perfected immortals and immortal officials, as well as the names of learners. At that time, they visit the Water Emperor and Spirit King of the Northern Sea to assess the merits, transgressions, and faults of those cultivating the Dao, then descend to the practitioner’s body.

Learners ingest the talisman to summon the deity, visualize the qi to attract the true essence, and erase their names from the Water Emperor’s tablet, inscribing them instead upon the jade register.

On the night of the beginning of winter at midnight, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Ingest the *Ren-Gui Water Qi Five Qi Talisman*, strike the teeth five times, and visualize the Black Emperor’s given name and style, his attire and form. See him riding a dark-cloud flying chariot descending to your chamber, black qi surging, filling the room and encircling your form.

Visualize the Emperor within the black qi transforming into the Chen Star, radiant and luminous, descending from your crown into your body, its brilliance illuminating the region of the kidneys. Then draw in qi and swallow five times, sensing your body suffused with warmth. After a moment, the Chen Star within the kidneys scatters into black qi, exiting through the nine orifices and reuniting above your crown to form a black cloud. Feel your body within the black qi, ascending with the cloud. After a long while, the sensation stabilizes, as if treading empty space. Look upward and intone:

"Five spirits commune with truth, transforming qi into vast yang.
Seven origins revolve in spirit, shining in the north.
The August Emperor proclaims his decree, the eight nodes govern radiance.
Above, he oversees the myriad immortals; below, he commands the boundless.
Riding qi through the void, descending to my chamber,
He bestows upon me the dark talisman, its transformations flowing freely.
Bearing *ren* to enter the cavern, carrying *gui* to ascend the sky,
Sealing and commanding the Five Marchmounts, governing the nine rivers,
Summoning mountains and invoking rain, talismanic waters ascend the dragon.
Flying chariots and purple canopies ascend to the Emperor’s palace."

When finished, strike the teeth five more times and swallow saliva eighteen times to conclude. After nine years of practice, you will be able to inscribe talismans and cast them into water, causing dragons to halt their flow and waves to still. Entering water will be like traversing empty space. Burying talismans in the Northern Marchmount will summon immortal officials to descend and bestow the elixir of immortality. After eighteen years, you will be able to sit in disappearance, ride the void in flight, and ascend to Jade Purity. This Dao is lofty and wondrous; it is not transmitted to the untrue. Those who lightly divulge its sacred texts will cause their seven ancestors to bear suffering, their bodies to be consigned to the offices of ghosts, and themselves to remain eternally as prisoners of the dark. They will never again attain immortality.

The *Supreme Ren-Gui Water Qi Five Qi Talisman* is written in cinnabar. On the night of the beginning of winter at midnight, face north to ingest it, reciting the incantation as above. Additionally, on *renzi* and *guihai* days in the tenth and eleventh months, write in cinnabar on paulownia wood, five inches wide and twelve inches long, and bury it five feet deep in the Northern Marchmount where you reside. *Ren* and *gui* occur only once a day; thus, perform this rite once every three years, not annually. Simply visualize, ingest, and practice in accordance with the seasonal nodes. After nine years, the Black Emperor and the Lord of Mount Heng will descend and appear before you. This is also called *Intersecting Ascension Cloud Gate Seven Transformations Five Unions* and *Five Spirits Dark Yin Central Dao of the Myriad Completions*. Those who obtain this text will swiftly achieve the Dao of immortality. Practicing it transforms one’s luminous form, enabling flight and ascent to the Purple Purity.

When burying the talisman, face north and strike the left teeth twenty-four times. Visualize clouds of black *qi* crowning a mountain peak, with the Lord of Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount riding a cloud chariot drawn by a black dragon, holding a five-colored feathered staff of flying immortals. Accompanied by twelve immortal officials of Mount Heng, they oversee and illuminate your form within the black *qi*. Look up and pray:

*"Dark Warrior intersects and ascends,
Five transformations complete the spirit,
Three unions and nine departures
Converge at the Jade Gate.
Eight vows fulfill the upper nodes,
I partake of their immortality.
Pacify *qi* and stabilize the numinous,
The Five Marchmounts protect and command.
Riding the void and summoning emptiness,
Myriad demons come to my body.
Descend with cloud chariots,
Dark carriages and purple chariots,
Soaring through the great void,
Ascending to the Imperial Dawn,
Forever with the Northern Lord,
Preserving life and celestial perfection."*

Conclude, then bury the talisman as prescribed. Inhale and swallow the black *qi* twenty-four times to finish.

The Lord of Mount Heng of the Northern Marchmount regularly presents, on the Winter Solstice, a register of perfected immortals and those newly embarking on the Dao to the Supreme Emperor, reviewing their celestial names and distinguishing merits from transgressions.

To practice the Dao of flying immortals, on that day at midnight, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber to burn incense. Face north and visualize the Lord of Mount Heng, surnamed Fu, named Tongmeng, wearing a five-*qi* treasure dawn jade crown, clad in a black brocade flying skirt and a dark patterned luminous robe, girded with an intertwining numinous purple sash. Riding a dark rosy-cloud flying wheel, with twelve officials of the Northern Marchmount each mounted on flying turtles and holding five-colored floral banners, they circle the northwest, ascending to the boundless Jade Purity of Heaven, wandering amidst the emptiness within the dark clouds.

Strike the teeth five times and silently recite: *"Today is most auspicious,
The eight nodes return in cycle,
The Dao Lord descends in turn,
Gazing upon my form,
Overseeing the register of life,
Forever preserving celestial years."*

Conclude, then visualize the Lord of Mount Heng descending to your chamber in a black rosy-cloud flying wheel, black *qi* surging and filling the room. Within the black *qi*, the Lord holds a purple tablet, inscribing your name upon its pages. Softly pray:

*"Dark Yin returns the numinous,
Riding the sun and governing the dawn,
Five *qi* gather the perfected,
Universally governing the host of immortals.
Pacify the luminous upper palace,
Wandering amidst the cloud array,
Descend in turn to oversee and illuminate,
Entering my chamber.
Inscribe my name on the dark tablet,
Record it in the jade register above,
Grant me penetrating clarity,
Thoroughly entering perfection.
Command the Five Numinous,
Seal rivers and summon mountains,
Descend dragons and summon rain,
Guide clouds and raise mist,
Ride the light wheel through the clouds,
Ascending into the Imperial Dawn."*

Conclude, then inhale and swallow the *qi* five times to finish.

Practice this for nine years, and the Lord of Mount Heng will descend to you with a dark dragon cloud chariot, assigning five immortal officials to summon the divine medicines of the Northern Perfected. You will clearly perceive future events in the north, discerning auspicious and inauspicious omens. After eighteen years of practice, you will soar to the Upper Clarity, jointly preserving jade perfection with the Emperor of the Northern Marchmount.

**Central Marchmount Yellow Emperor’s Internal Visualization of Earth *Qi* and the Talisman of the Cyclic Branches Wu and Ji**

The Yellow Emperor of the Central Marchmount, surnamed Ma, named Zhongshen, wears a yellow dawn jade crown piercing the heavens, a yellow brocade robe with a dark yellow flying-cloud brocade skirt, carries the Yellow Emperor’s Yueyuan tally, and is girded with a numinous flying purple sash.

On the day of the Great Year Star, he rides a yellow-cloud flying chariot, accompanied by twelve Yellow Essence Jade Maidens, each mounted on twelve flying scaled creatures and holding five-colored imperial floral banners. They traverse the Central Marchmount, Mount Song, reviewing the registers of perfected immortals and celestial officials, as well as the names of learners. They visit the spirit kings of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Twelve Waters to assess the merits, transgressions, and faults of Dao practitioners, then descend to the bodies of those wearing the talisman.

Learners ingest the talisman to summon its spirit, visualize its *qi* to descend its perfected essence, and inscribe their names on the water emperors’ tablets, recording them in the jade registers.

On the day of the Great Year Star at midday, bathe, purify, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Ingest the talisman of the Earth *qi* of Wu and Ji, strike the teeth twelve times, and visualize the Yellow Emperor of the Central Marchmount—his name and taboo, attire, and appearance. See him riding a yellow-cloud flying chariot descending to your chamber, yellow *qi* billowing and filling the room, encircling your form.

Visualize the Emperor within the yellow *qi*, transforming into the Star of Stability, radiant and luminous, descending from your crown into your body, its brilliance illuminating the region of the spleen. Inhale and swallow the *qi* twelve times, feeling your body suffused with warmth. Soon, the Star of Stability within the spleen disperses into yellow *qi*, exiting through the nine orifices, converging and returning above your crown to form a yellow cloud. Feel your body within the yellow cloud, ascending with it. After a long while, the sensation stabilizes, as if treading upon emptiness.

Look up and pray:

*"Central Numinous Yellow Origin,
Twelve flying essences,
Five *qi* blend and transform,
The August Emperor thoroughly illuminates.
Today is most auspicious,
Gathering and governing the myriad numinous,
Reviewing registers and tallying records,
Erasing sins and dissolving karmic bonds.
Returning the perfected and flowing gaze,
Descend in turn to my court,
Sever my death,
Inscribe my name on the purple tablet,
Assist my great perfection,
Grant me divine soldiers,
Rectify and command the Five Marchmounts,
Seal mountains and summon spirits,
Annihilate the host of demons,
Purify my Dao.
Riding Wu and bearing Ji,
Thoroughly entering formlessness,
Raising clouds and descending rain,
Soaring through the clouds in a purple chariot,
Attaining tranquility with the Five Marchmounts,
Merging with the Emperor."*

Conclude, then strike the teeth twelve times and swallow the *qi* twelve times to finish.

Practice this for nine years, and you will understand the languages of the thirty-six nations and perceive the forms and colors of the thirty-six Earth Emperors beneath the ten thousand abysses. Write talismans and grasp jade, your form merging with earth. Bury the talisman in the Central Marchmount, and the twelve Yellow Essence Jade Maidens will bring the natural kitchen and the elixir of immortality.

After eighteen years, you will be able to fly through the dark void and ascend to the Jade Purity.

Guard this as a divine immortal secret. Revealing it lightly will bring nine generations of ancestors to trial, and you will bear the three faults, condemned to the nether darkness.

**The Supreme Talisman of Earth *Qi* of Wu and Ji**
Write in cinnabar. On the day of the Great Year Star at midday, face the four seasons and ingest it, praying as prescribed above.

Moreover, on the days of *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jichou*, and *jiwei* in the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months, write in cinnabar upon paulownia wood, making the talisman three *cun* wide and one *chi* and two *cun* long. Bury it at the center of your dwelling, one *chi* and two *cun* deep. Perform this once on a single day of each season, repeating the rite every three years—not annually. Simply maintain visualization and ingestion, following the prescribed days. After nine years, the Lord of Mount Song Gao of the Yellow Emperor will descend without fail to manifest before you.

This is called *Xuan Zhen Zong Hui Zi Sheng Wan Du* ("Mystic Perfection’s Radiance, Self-Generating Myriad Transformations"), also named *Shen Fei Jiu Dao Ling Bian Zi Ran* ("Divine Flight through the Nine Paths, Wondrous Transformation by Nature"). Those who attain this Dao will immediately ascend to the Cloud Palace.

When burying the talisman, face the four seasons, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize a cloud of yellow *qi* descending like a mountain to crown your head. The Lord of the Central Marchmount rides a cloud chariot drawn by a yellow dragon, wielding a twelve-jointed banner of dark and yellow, accompanied by twelve immortals of Mount Song Gao. They stand within the yellow *qi*, overseeing your form. Raise your gaze and pray:

*"Three Pure Ones, streaming gales,
Five-fold coils of yellow cloud,
Dao harmonizes myriad changes,
Mystic void uplifts the true.
Spirits settle on the sacred peak,
Dao descends into my body.
Yellow and white divide early,
My name inscribed in the Purple Register.
Seal the mountains, summon the rivers,
Command the host of immortals.
Summon clouds, descend rain,
Yellow auroras, flying wheels.
Stride the void, tread the mystic,
Ascend to the lofty morn."*

When finished, bury the talisman as prescribed and swallow twelve breaths of yellow *qi*.

The Lord of the Central Marchmount and Mount Song Gao, on the days of *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jichou*, and *jiwei* in the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months, presents the names of perfected immortals and those newly embarked on the path to the Supreme Emperor on High. He examines the records of the mystic names, distinguishing merit from transgression. To cultivate the Dao of flying immortality, on these days at midday, bathe, purify yourself, and enter your chamber to burn incense. Face the four seasons and visualize the Lord of the Central Marchmount, surnamed Jiao, named Pusheng, wearing a Jade Crown of the Yellow Dawn of the Middle Prime, clad in a yellow brocade flying skirt and a dark-yellow patterned robe, bearing the seal of the Yellow Divine Central August. He rides a flying wheel of yellow aurora, accompanied by twelve immortals of the Central Marchmount, all mounted on flying *lin* beasts, wielding twelve-jointed banners of dark and yellow. They circle to the southwest, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace upon the boundless heights, drifting through the empty void within the yellow clouds.

Knock your teeth twelve times and silently intone:

*"Heaven suspends its highest vow,
I receive its grace.
Yearning for the void, descending spirits,
Thoughts subtle, attaining immortality.
Lord of the Central Marchmount,
Bind me to your chariot.
Let me fly and ascend,
Reach the Gate of Gold."*

When finished, visualize the Lord of Mount Song Gao descending in his flying wheel of yellow aurora to your chamber. Yellow *qi* surges forth, filling the room. The Lord stands within the yellow *qi*, holding a yellow tablet, inscribing your name upon it. Softly pray:

*"Yellow numen, central mystery,
Dao veils the purple heavens.
Three unite as one,
Binding the void to become immortal.
Grasp the register, preserve the record,
Secure destiny, extend the years.
Inscribe my name in Eastern Florescence,
Record the immortal in the Central Qin.
Five numina oversee and reflect,
Refining my Dao to brilliance.
Emerge from the void, enter the subtle,
Pierce the nine mysteries.
Body born of water and fire,
Transforming scenes by the myriad thousands.
Stride the void, tread the empty,
Fly without hindrance."*

When finished, swallow twelve breaths of *qi* and cease.

After nine years of cultivation, you will converse face-to-face with the Lord of the Central Marchmount, who will descend to bestow upon you a flying chariot drawn by a yellow dragon and appoint you as an immortal official, granting you natural treasures for your body. After eighteen years, the Dao will be perfected, and you will ascend as a flying immortal to the Jade Purity.

**Method for Erasing Sins and Removing Names from the Registers by Meditating on the Water Emperors of the Four Seas**
**The Supreme Nine Red Talismans for Sealing the Seas and Communicating with the True**
**Talisman of the Nine Sources of Green *Qi* of the East Sea Water Emperor**
**The Supreme Nine Primordial Green *Qi* Talismans**

On the days of *Lichun* and the Spring Equinox, at dawn, write in cinnabar upon green paper and ingest it facing east. After performing the rite, write the talisman in cinnabar upon paulownia wood, inscribing beneath it: *"On such-and-such a year, month, and day, so-and-so, a master of the sacred peaks from such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, aged so many years, born in such-and-such a month."* Bind nine *liang* of green stone with green silk and place it beneath the talisman, then cast it into the eastward-flowing waters.

On these days, maintain purity and fast, enter your chamber to burn incense, face east, knock your teeth twelve times, and visualize the Divine King of the East Sea Water Emperor, surnamed Wang, named Duyuan. He wears a Precious Bright Crown of the Great Dawn, a flying skirt of green patterned kingfisher feathers, and a belt with a seven-colored lion-headed pouch. He rides a flying dragon-drawn jade carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal attendants of the East Sea Water Emperor, each mounted on a green dragon. They ascend to the High Emperor of the Jade Sovereign, drifting through the green clouds, then descend to your body. Green *qi* billows, darkening the inner and outer.

The Divine King sits before you, erases your death register, and inscribes your name in the immortal records. Softly pray:

*"Abyssal depths of nine sources,
Ascend to join the Jade Purity.
Dividing the two *qi*, flowing streams,
Merging and harmonizing, born as one.
Above, govern the perfected,
Below, oversee the names of disciples.
This day is most auspicious,
Eight vows unite as one.
The Water Emperor erases sins,
Records merit to the highest spirits.
The Great Unity secures the years,
Preserves life in yellow tranquility.
Form joins the Nine Capitals,
*Qi* responds to the divine essence.
Left, command the Heavenly Armor,
Right, dispatch the Six Dings.
Summon mountains, call forth seas,
Descend chariots and dragon carriages.
Convey me in flight,
Ascend to pay homage to the Three Purities.
Feathered regalia, resplendent,
Golden pendants, tinkling.
Drifting, striding the void,
Roaming the Purple Court.
Below, gaze upon the water palace,
Waters receive my form.
Let me endure forever,
Equal in age to the kalpa."*

When finished, ingest the talisman and swallow nine breaths of fluid. Then cast the talisman into the eastward-flowing abyss as prescribed.

After eighteen years of cultivation, the Water Emperor will erase your sin register and report to the Jade Purity, descending a dragon carriage to traverse the great void. Your body will enter the ten-thousand-fathom abyss, where you will converse with the Water Emperor.

The Mysterious and Wondrous Dao must not be recklessly proclaimed.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Qi from the Southern Sea Water Emperor’s Cavern Source**
The *Supreme Cavern Source Vermilion Qi Talisman* is to be inscribed in cinnabar on blue-green paper at noon on the days of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) or *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), then ingested while facing south. Upon completing the ritual, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on paulownia wood, recording beneath it: *"On the day of [year], [month], [day], [name], Master of the Sacred Peaks of [prefecture], [county], [village], aged [years], born in [month],"* then affix the talisman. Bind eight ounces of red stone with red silk, attach the talisman, and cast it into southward-flowing waters.

To practice this Dao, on the appointed day, maintain a pure fast, enter the chamber, burn incense, face south, and knock the teeth twelve times. Visualize the Divine King of the Southern Sea Water Emperor, surnamed Kai, personal name Naling, crowned with the *Tai Chen Precious Radiance Diadem*, clad in a vermilion brocade flying skirt, girded with the *Intertwined Spirit Purple Sash* and nine-colored *Pan* pouch. He rides a scaled dragon, soaring upon cloud chariots, accompanied by the twelve immortal attendants of the Southern Sea Water Emperor, each mounted on twelve flying dragons. Ascending to the High August Jade Emperor, they drift amidst azure clouds before descending to my presence, where verdant qi swirls in darkness.

The Divine King sits before me, erases my sin register, and inscribes my name in the immortal ledger. Then recite the subtle invocation:
*"Vermilion Abyss of Nanyang, cavern springs of ten thousand valleys,
The Emperor pacifies and guards, governing all water immortals.
Examining sin registers, recording merits in the Purple Dawn,
Auspicious day, clear hour—guiding dragons and wielding mist.
Drifting through the mysterious void, descending to my hall,
Merging with qi, the Dao arises naturally.
Subduing demons, dispelling spirits, sealing seas and mountains,
The Six Masters open the path, connecting me to water’s source.
Summoning clouds, descending rain, whistling commands at my behest—
All wishes and petitions shall be fulfilled as spoken.
Soaring to the Upper Clarity, paying homage to the Jade Dawn."*

Conclude by swallowing eight breaths of qi, then cast the talisman into the southward-flowing abyss as prescribed. After eighteen years of practice, the Water Palace will no longer hold a sin register in my name. The Divine King will present my name to the Jade Emperor, who will dispatch a cloud-dragon cinnabar carriage to traverse the great void. I shall ascend mountains, cross seas, with ten thousand spirits guarding my passage, penetrating the subtle and entering the mysterious, uniting with the Emperor in true essence. Those who recklessly divulge this sacred text shall be punished by the divine armies of the Five Emperors; those who keep it secret shall attain immortality.

**Talisman of the White Qi from the Western Sea Water Emperor’s Cavern Abyss**
The *Supreme Cavern Abyss White Qi Talisman* is to be inscribed in cinnabar on blue-green paper at dusk on the days of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) or *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), then ingested while facing west. Upon completing the ritual, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on paulownia wood, recording beneath it: *"On the day of [year], [month], [day], [name], Master of the Sacred Peaks of [prefecture], [county], [village], aged [years], born in [month],"* then affix the talisman.

He rides a flying carriage, accompanied by the twelve immortal attendants of the Western Sea Water Emperor, each mounted on twelve white tigers, soaring through the mysterious void. Ascending to the High August Jade Emperor, they drift amidst the azure clouds of the mysterious emptiness before descending in true essence to my presence. The Divine King erases my sin register, inscribes my name in the immortal ledger, and presents it before the Jade Emperor.

Then recite the subtle invocation:
*"Yang Valley ten thousand fathoms deep, cavern abyss of nine streams,
Twelve imperial palaces, nine river lords,
Above governing the Jade Void, below presiding over the divine continent.
On this most auspicious day, the Divine King sets forth,
Holding my life’s register, guarding my mysterious talisman.
Returning true essence, bending light to descend to my dwelling,
Erasing my sin register, engraving it in celestial script.
The Dao arises naturally, ascending in the whirlwind’s cloud chariot,
Merging with primordial auspiciousness, my body one with the Emperor."*

Conclude by swallowing six breaths of qi, then cast the talisman into the westward-flowing abyss as prescribed. After eighteen years of practice, I shall traverse the Western Sea, tread the ten-thousand-fathom abyss, with sea spirits guarding my passage, unbound by water’s constraints. A dragon carriage shall descend, soaring through the great void, while the water officials erase my sins and present my name to the Emperor. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, not practiced in the mundane world. Those who encounter this text shall attain immortality without study.

**Talisman of the Black Qi from the Northern Sea Water Emperor’s River Cavern**
The *Supreme River Cavern Black Qi Talisman* is to be inscribed in cinnabar on blue-green paper at midnight on the days of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) or *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), then ingested while facing north. Upon completing the ritual, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on paulownia wood, recording beneath it: *"On the day of [year], [month], [day], [name], Master of the Sacred Peaks of [prefecture], [county], [village], aged [years], born in [month],"* then affix the talisman. Bind five ounces of black stone with black silk, attach the talisman, and cast it into northward-flowing waters.

To practice this Dao, on the appointed day, maintain a pure fast, enter the chamber, burn incense, face north, and knock the teeth twelve times. Visualize the Divine King of the Northern Sea Water Emperor, surnamed Xi, personal name Yuanyuan, crowned with the *Tai Chen Precious Radiance Diadem*, clad in a dark brocade flying skirt, girded with the *Huo Luo Seven Primes* and five-colored *Tiger-Head Pan* pouch. He rides a black auroral flying carriage, accompanied by the twelve immortal attendants of the Northern Sea Water Emperor, each mounted on twelve flying turtles, roaming the mysterious void. Ascending to the High August Jade Emperor, they drift above the mysterious numinous, amidst swirling verdant qi, before descending in true essence to my presence. The Divine King erases my sin register, inscribes my name in the jade ledger, and presents it before the Jade Emperor of the Upper Clarity.

Then recite the subtle invocation:
*"Heaven and earth divide their streams, the four rivers govern clarity,
Three river water palaces, nine river imperial spirits.
Examining registers, binding sins to the Four Luminaries—
Those with Dao earn merit; those with transgressions face punishment.
On this most auspicious day, the Emperor’s light illumines my court.
Flowing true essence returns, descending—my immortality is achieved.
Three rivers and four seas guard my form,
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—spoken, they arise at once.
Soaring through the mysterious void, ascending to the Eight Darknesses,
Eternally preserving the Three Luminaries, heaven and earth in harmony."*

Conclude by swallowing breaths of qi, then cast the talisman into the northward-flowing abyss as prescribed. After eighteen years of practice, I shall ascend through the great void, traverse mountains and seas, with ten thousand spirits guarding my passage, attaining the subtle and entering the mysterious, uniting with the Emperor in true essence.

Upon completion, raise your head and swallow the eight breaths of qi to stillness, then cast the talisman into the northern abyss of the North Sea as prescribed. After eighteen years of practice, summon the twelve Water Lords and Jiao-Dragons to command the waters and raise clouds, darkening the bright day. Soaring through the void, ascend to the Jade Purity.

This method is most profound—only the true may practice it. To violate its prohibitions or recklessly transmit it brings calamity and annihilation to one’s person, extending punishment through the Seven Mysteries. It is the secret of immortals alone.

The Supreme Nine Crimson-Striped Talisman is formed by weaving the soaring, mysterious purple qi into its script. The Supreme Perfected Lord seals the mountains and summons the peaks, governing the rivers and commanding the spirits. Its script penetrates the subtle, resplendent in the Highest Clarity.

The Primordial Heavenly King concealed it within the Jade Terrace’s Golden Chamber of the Jade Void. By ancient decree, it is transmitted once every seven thousand years. Without a name inscribed in gold or jade, or the vermilion script of the Mystic Terrace, one may not partake of its teachings. Those who behold its script and perfect its practice attain the rank of Highest Immortal.

Follow the method: on the eight solar terms, ingest the talisman, perform the rites, and offer prayers, then bury it upon a mountain or cast it into the sea. Within nine years, the immortal officials of the Five Peaks will attend and guard your person, the Water Emperor and water spirits will await your command from all directions, and the Five Emperors will report your name to the Mystic Palace. The water officials will erase your records of transgression, dragons will descend amidst clouds, and transformations will arise without limit.

You must also habitually inscribe the talisman in colored pigments and wear it upon your person. Ascend mountains and traverse rivers—then the myriad spirits will guard your form, vanquish demons and trials, subdue all spirits with your might, and five-colored clouds will descend to your chamber while purple mist arises of itself. A halo will encircle your head, illuminating within and without, the Eight Effulgences will unite in perfection, and the Three Primes will descend in chariots. Soaring through the mysterious void, you will ascend to the Jade Purity.

Those whose names are inscribed in gold and whose bones are of jade, bearing the precious script of the Highest Clarity, who obtain this talisman and wear it for three years, shall become Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks. Treading rivers and crossing seas, they shall become Lords of the Four Seas, assisted by the Five Emperors, revered by the myriad spirits. After nine years of practice, they shall traverse ten thousand fathoms of water, command and restrain the Jiao-Dragons, and if they retreat to the mountains to cultivate in seclusion, the Five Emperors and Five Peaks will manifest and converse with them. They shall summon clouds and raise rain, instantly call forth dragon mists, and achieve a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, their responses instantaneous.

After eighteen years of practice, they shall soar to the Highest Clarity. This Dao is most profound and not to be revealed in the world. To lightly disclose its sacred script brings punishment upon the seven generations of ancestors, while one’s own life is forfeit, bound eternally to the offices of the dead.

The recipient must fast with their master for thirty days—or seven days—offering three taels of refined gold, fifty feet each of five-colored patterned silk, forty feet of brocade, and one catty of finest incense. They shall proceed to the cliffs of the Five Peaks, announce themselves to the Five Emperors, and register with the Five Spirits, the celestial, terrestrial, and water officials of the Three Rivers and Four Seas, in accordance with the oath of the Four Poles, before transmission may occur.

If the recipient fails to register with the Celestial Spirits, the jade lads and jade maidens who attend the script will report to the Most High, and the recipient shall be punished by the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. Those who lightly disclose it shall be punished across nine generations of ancestors, their own person extinguished. Those who receive it without swearing the oath shall bring calamity upon seven generations of ancestors, their own body afflicted by wind and fire, and the script shall naturally be lost.

Thus did the Supreme Primordial Lady declare to the Five Emperors: a script not sworn to shall not be transmitted; one who receives without registration loses the true. Both parties bear the responsibility of life and death. Scholars must adhere to the text and uphold it.

The Dao descends without fail; immortality is achieved without exception. Life and death share in its blessings, and fortune flows to one’s kin. The sacred script is most weighty—this is the ultimate truth of the Dao.

Here ends the *Wondrous Perfected Supreme Nine Crimson-Striped Talisman: The Five Emperors’ Scripture of Inner Perfection*.
