### *The Supreme Clarity Essential Mirror Scripture*

For all practices, first bathe and observe purification rites. Relax the body from chill, and launder clothing and bedding to ensure freshness, then fumigate them with incense.

#### **Chapter One: The Method for Crafting the Luminous Mirror**

**The Method for Gazing into the Mirror to See One’s Form:**
Stand in darkness facing light, slightly opening the door. Briefly close the eyes and visualize seeing your face. At first, all appears indistinct, with nothing visible. After a night’s meditation, vision gradually becomes clear and far-reaching, revealing your face and headwrap. The mind’s eye opens, and clarity dawns.

The best times are dawn and dusk. If the sun is too bright, slightly close the door and peer into the mirror amid the glare—nothing will be seen. When using firelight to illuminate the mirror, keep the flame at a distance; do not let it burn too closely.

To open the eyes and gaze at your form, do so in bright light without strain. If you wish to close your eyes and visualize your face, stand in darkness facing light—then your ears will perceive it.

**The Essentials of Mirror Gazing:**
Lie down calmly and focus your thoughts with utmost sincerity. Before lying down, relax your body completely. After a brief moment, a red or yellow radiance will emerge from your forehead, illuminating the entire room. In this state of vague yet vivid awareness—half-awake, half-asleep—you will see your face within the light, gazing back at you for a moment before vanishing.

After waking, gaze into the mirror again. Lie down when inclined, and meditate as before. Each evening, you will see yourself. Sometimes upon waking, you may see two faces facing each other, or your form seated alongside another. In slumber, you may encounter divine youths and jade maidens, aged fifteen or sixteen, adorned in fine garments, their foreheads clearly visible—bow to them twice. Or you may hear voices at your ear, foretelling all fortunes and misfortunes under heaven. You may see through walls, or in dreams at dusk, gaze into the mirror. Or you may turn the light inward to perceive the five viscera.

Begin mirror gazing on the first day of the *jia* cycle.

**The Method for Setting Up the Mirror:**
Use a nine-inch clear mirror, free of blemishes, perfectly bright. Place two mirrors, one on each side, fifteen inches from the viewer, aligned with the eyes. Fill a basin with well-water drawn at dawn and place it below. For nighttime gazing, use a lamp fueled by hemp oil.

Once your form appears clearly, step down, bow deeply, and kneel, saying: *"I share the same body with you. Let me divide my form into ten thousand, and I beg you to always accompany me. May my body never decay, and may you follow me for ten thousand years."*

**Receiving the Vision of the Luminous Mirror:**
First, observe your form and all things within it, and listen to the voices of others. When cultivating the luminous mirror, three youths and nine maidens will attend you. The youths stand six feet tall, the maidens five feet. They wear azure sashes and robes: the central figure in purple, the *Neizi* in black, the *Sunu* in white, the *Huangnü* in yellow, the *Zhangshang* in light yellow, the *Daonü* in yellow, the *Nüying* in red, and the *Zengnü* in crimson.

The Luminous Mirror Lord commands one hundred twenty officials, governing the Kaiyang Palace. The master’s two pupils, their essence and light intermingling, perceive reflections and foresee fortune and misfortune.

#### **Chapter Two: The Scripture of the Mirror-Polishing Daoist**

Long ago, a mirror-polishing Daoist wandered among the people, offering his services to households. Regardless of size, polishing a mirror cost only six or seven coins. He used no other tools—only a medicinal paste applied to the surface, yet the mirror’s brilliance never faded.

A curious man named Yuan Zhongyang, recognizing his mastery, invited him to stay the night and hosted him generously. The host bowed and inquired of him. The Daoist told Zhongyang: *"The Way of the Luminous Mirror can divide one’s form into myriad shapes, transforming the singular into the infinite. It can sharpen the mind, foretell future events, and allow one to meet the immortals of heaven. If practiced correctly, all celestial immortals will descend. When the Daoist sees his own form, he attains ageless youth and reverts to a child’s vitality. When the Daoist enters the mountains to meditate, mountain spirits and ancient specters often test him, sometimes assuming human form. Thus, the Daoist should always hang a nine-inch luminous mirror behind him in his stone chamber to ward off all evil. Though a hundred ghosts and ancient monsters may shapeshift, they cannot alter their reflections in the mirror. Seeing their true forms within it, they vanish and flee, no longer daring to harm him."*

Thus, the Daoist possessed a mirror-polishing elixir, the formula of which originated with Bai Zigao.

**The Formula:**
Take four ounces of tin and heat it in a cauldron over a fire until the cauldron glows red, matching the fire’s hue, then add the tin. Grind three ounces of lead powder and mix it in. Carve a figure from fresh white poplar, one foot tall, two inches wide, and one inch thick, with a handle at the back proportionate to the ear. Use this to stir the mixture, ensuring no residue remains on the hands, until the figure is worn down by seven inches. Then add four ounces of true cinnabar and one ounce of lead powder, stirring again until the figure is reduced by another two inches. Add four ounces of mirror-polishing tin and stir until fully blended.

When using the elixir, grind it to the size of a mung bean, mix it with saliva, and apply it like rouge. Alternatively, grind it to rice-grain size, exhale upon it from the front teeth, then mix it with saliva and apply it to the mirror’s surface. Polishing it will make the mirror shine like the sun and moon.

**Preparation:**
First, observe purification rites for seven days. Prepare the elixir in a secluded, clean place, ensuring no one witnesses the process. The fire must be fierce. Guard this secret; do not recklessly transmit it to unworthy recipients.

In the ten-day cycle of *jiazi*, face toward *mao*; in the *jiaxu* cycle, face toward *chou*; in the *jiashen* cycle, face toward *hai*; in the *jiawu* cycle, face toward *you*; in the *jiachen* cycle, face toward *wei*; in the *jiayin* cycle, face toward *si*. To summon the Six Ding Jade Maidens, one must face the direction of the current cycle when relieving oneself, repeating this without cease—then the divine maidens will arrive, and all harm will be dispelled.

**Third: "Laozi’s Hundred-Flower Powder: A Formula for Repelling Weapons and Transcending the World"**
This formula can repel the Three Armies, ward off all evil spirits, resolve calamities, prolong life, and grant immortality to those who obtain it.
Ingredients: realgar, cinnabar, coltsfoot flower, and *yuanzhi* (polygala root).
Take two *fen* of each, grind separately, then mix with two *sheng* of flowers gathered in the seventh month. If famine or plague strikes, take half a *qianbi*. Before consumption, abstain from pungent vegetables and the meat of the six livestock. In times of urgent official crises, enemy sieges, or storms at sea, mix one *liang* of the powder with one *dou* of water to wash the face and bathe the body. One *sheng* suffices for three people; keep a small portion ready for emergencies. If bathing is impossible, swallow two pills the size of small beans, and the calamity will pass. If a disciple or another faces misfortune, give them the medicine, and they will be spared. Store this in a golden casket; do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy.

**Fourth: "Immortals’ Divine Wine Formula"**
Ingredients: half a *sheng* each of Sichuan pepper, cassia, licorice, five *fuzi* (aconite), half a *sheng* of good yeast, half a *sheng* of dried ginger, half a *sheng* of *kushen* (sophora root), and half a *sheng* of plump, high-quality dried jujubes.
Grind the eight ingredients together and sift. Steep in one *hu* of fine, undiluted wine, then dry in the sun. Repeat the steeping process until the wine is exhausted after a full year. Store in an oiled leather pouch, tightly sealed to prevent leakage. To make wine, mix a *fangcunbi* of the powder with one *dou* of water, stir, and it will transform into wine. It may also be formed into honeyed pills for consumption. In winter, steep in warm water. Immortals travel ten thousand *li* without running out of wine—this is the very method.

**Fifth: "Divine Pillow Formula for Eliminating the Hundred Diseases"**
An old man from the foot of Mount Tai, whose name is lost, was seen by Emperor Wu of Han during his eastern tour. The man was hoeing by the roadside, his back emitting a white light several *chi* high. The emperor, astonished, asked what arts he practiced. The old man replied: "When I was eighty-five, I was decrepit and near death, my hair white and teeth fallen. A Daoist taught me to eat jujubes, drink water, and abstain from grains, while also making a divine pillow containing thirty-two ingredients. The thirty-two correspond to the twenty-four qi, and the eight toxins align with the eight winds. After practicing this, I grew younger, my hair turned black again, lost teeth regrew, and I could walk three hundred *li* in a day. Now I am one hundred eighty, yet I cannot abandon the world to enter the mountains, for I cherish my grandchildren. Though I resumed eating grains over twenty years ago, I still benefit from the pillow’s power and no longer age."
The emperor observed the old man’s appearance, which seemed no older than fifty. He questioned the neighbors, who confirmed the account. The emperor then received the formula and made the pillow but could not follow the grain-abstinence and water-drinking regimen.
The pillow is made from wood boards taken from mountain forests on the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month. It should be one *chi* and two *cun* long, four *cun* high, with a hollow center holding one *dou* and two *sheng*. The lid, made from heartwood of a red tree, should be four *fen* thick, tightly fitted, and designed to open and close. Drill three rows of forty holes each on the lid, totaling one hundred twenty holes, each large enough to hold a grain of millet.
The ingredients are:
*Xiongqiong* (ligusticum), *danggui* (angelica), *baizhi* (angelica dahurica), *xinyi* (magnolia flower), *duheng* (asarum), *baizhu* (atractylodes), *gaoben* (ligusticum sinense), *mulan* (magnolia bark), Sichuan pepper, cassia, dried ginger, *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *renshen* (ginseng), *jiegeng* (platycodon), *feikang* (arsenic), *shishi* (amomum), *baiheng* (cynanchum), *qinjiao* (gentiana), *jing* fruit (or *zhuangjing* fruit), *roucongrong* (cistanche), *yiyizi* (coix seed), coltsfoot flower, and *lianwu* (asarum).
These twenty-four ingredients correspond to the twenty-four qi.
The toxic additions are:
*Wutou* (aconite), *fuzi* (aconite accessory), *lilu* (veratrum), *zaojia* ( gleditsia), *mangcao* (illicium), *fanshi* (alum), *banxia* (pinellia), and *xixin* (asarum).
The thirty-two ingredients, each weighing one *liang*, are chopped, with the toxic ones placed on top. Fill the pillow’s hollow with a cloth bag containing the mixture, then wrap the pillow in cloth for a hundred days until the face develops a lustrous glow. After a year, all internal ailments and wind disorders will be cured, and the body will become fragrant. After four years, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow, and hearing and vision sharpen.
This formula is divinely efficacious and secret; do not transmit it to the unworthy.
(*Gaoben* is the mother of *xiongqiong*.)
When Emperor Wu inquired further, Dongfang Shuo replied: "Long ago, Nü Lian transmitted this formula to Yu Qing, who passed it to Guangchengzi, who then gave it to the Yellow Emperor. More recently, the Daoist Chunyu of Gucheng used this medicinal pillow and lived over a hundred years without his hair turning white. All diseases arise from the yang vessels, but with this pillow, wind and evil cannot invade." Even when wrapped in cloth, the pillow should be further encased in a leather pouch. Remove the pouch only when about to sleep.
The emperor ordered silk to be bestowed upon the old man, who declined, saying: "Your subject’s relationship to the sovereign is like a son’s to his father. When a son knows the Way, he offers it to his father—it would be improper to accept a reward. Moreover, I am not a seller of the Dao; I presented this only because Your Majesty delights in goodness and trusts in the Dao." The emperor relented and instead bestowed various medicines upon him.

The Daoist Nine-Jointed Staff Method:
The first joint is called the Star of Great Yin; the second, the Star of Blazing Delusion; the third, the Horn Star; the fourth, the Balance Star; the fifth, the Spread Star; the sixth, the Encampment Star; the seventh, the Quelling Star; the eighth, the Eastern Well Star; the ninth, the Restraining Star.

Laozi’s Pillow Talismans and Medicinal Formulae, Scroll Six
If one’s dwelling is unsettled, with decline and frequent illness, let the head of the household wear this, and the entire family will be at peace and joyful.

If someone suddenly dies while the body remains warm, administer this medicine—two pellets the size of soybeans—and they will revive. Should the person be too weak to swallow, use a stick to pry open the mouth, administer the medicine, and they will live.

In times of pestilence or plague, or when traveling afar in lands where water and soil are unwholesome, take one pellet the size of a soybean on the first day of the month at dawn, and wear it as prescribed.

When compounding the medicine or wearing it, one must first bathe, fast, and purify oneself before donning it. Wearing it wards off all diseases, repels evil spirits, neutralizes weapons, aids official service, protects descendants, averts misfortune, and brings boundless benefit.

After wearing the medicine, the old clothes one has worn must not be lent to others. This medicine and talisman are most secret and must not be transmitted to the unworthy.

The formula uses:

Walnut, aconite (main root), peach resin, realgar, croton seed, Sichuan pepper, true pearl, dog gall, tiger’s paw, tiger’s fang, *nüqing* (a Daoist herb), white quartz, and *yinchen* wormwood.

The above thirteen ingredients, each one and a half taels, combined with the talisman make fourteen items in total. Pound them finely and sift. Take two catties of fresh ginger, chop finely, and press to extract the juice, then mix with the medicine and pound six hundred times. If the ginger juice is insufficient, supplement with white honey. When finished, form the medicine into pellets the size of sparrow’s eggs, and use a three-inch crimson silk pouch with white silk lining. First inscribe the first talisman in cinnabar on the silk, then assemble the crimson silk into the pouch. Men wear it on the left, women on the right.

When pounding the medicine, face the northwest and recite the following incantation in secret:
*"The Five Phases revolve in succession, heaven and earth unfold in harmony. Feet tread upon Wenchang, heart rests in the Great Clarity. Yin and yang qi unite, merging with me. Kui, Lou, Wei, and Mao—face the northwest in shadow. The Southern Dipper governs life; the body bears sun and moon. Journeying to the celestial court, may all obstacles yield. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Dao commands."*

If troubled by ominous or strange dreams, place three pellets beneath the pillow.

*Laozi’s Jade Casket: The Divine Immortal’s Secret of Planting Lingzhi, Scroll Seven*
*Text from the Stone Chamber*

Laozi says: Alas, you multitudes of people! You all know that life is joy and death is suffering, yet none know how to preserve life itself. Though a thousand arts and ten thousand medicines enter your bodies, they may only grant you longevity—perhaps a thousand years, or several hundred at best—yet they cannot enable you to soar and ascend as an immortal, to attend the Celestial Emperor above.

Among tree medicines, pine resin is the finest, for this tree produces *fuling* (poria), and its fat is abundant. Its leaves and fruits may all be consumed. Among herbs, the best are *ronghua* (flowering plants), *huangjing* (solomon’s seal), *tianmendong* (asparagus root), and *shanji* (thistle). These should be taken continuously without a single day’s interruption, granting perhaps five hundred years of life—but still not enough to endure with heaven and earth.

Later generations of alchemists have embellished these teachings, misleading seekers, and I deeply pity them. The Eight Stone Elixirs, mica jade nectar—those who consume them must abstain from the bedchamber, blood foods, impure meats, and foul vegetables. They must dwell in a stone chamber on a famous mountain for a year before they may see spirits and ghosts, achieving mere immortality—but still not flight, nor the power to rise lightly upon the clouds.

Have you heard that immortals consume the blossoms of *lingzhi*? This is no empty claim. On the yin and yang slopes of sacred mountains, above pure spring waters, beneath ancient trees, *lingzhi* may grow. Yet what it receives is merely the essence of mountain, water, earth, and wood—it cannot instantly make one an immortal, though it surpasses common herbs. *Lingzhi* that grows upon cinnabar, gold, malachite, or realgar—these are not seen or eaten by those who lack utmost virtue to move the spirits.

The reason such *lingzhi* can make one an immortal at once is that it absorbs the purest essence of these four substances, containing the harmonious *qi* of heaven and earth, refined by steaming vapors into a divine fluid. Its flavor surpasses the original nature of these four. If one merely takes these four substances, pounds and consumes them, they will be beneficial. But if one adds the power of resonance, gathering them in a crucible, their essence will rise and fly upward. Sweeping and consuming it will yield a hundredfold benefit beyond herbs—not merely ingesting them raw.

To truly succeed, one must draw down the pure *qi* of heaven and earth, guiding the essence of these four substances upward to form a living thing. Would this not be a hundredfold more potent than merely placing them in an earthen crucible?

I am about to depart, yet I grieve for the countless multitudes who will turn to ash and dust. Alas! Now I set down the *Celestial Patterns of Lingzhi*. Those with the destined bone-marrow may obtain this text. If their ancestors bear sins, they will not attain long life, nor receive this book. Hide it deep within a stone casket, nine layers beneath a famous mountain. Do not transmit it recklessly—beware, beware!

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), dig in the *yin* (northeast) corner of your home’s eastern side—whether inside or outside—seeking good soil, not ash or barren earth. Excavate a pit three *chi* deep and three *chi* square. Take one *jin* of malachite, grind it to powder, wrap it in *yangfulai* (sheep’s fat), and moisten it with one *sheng* of *qingxiang* (celosia). Cover it with soil and tamp it down. After seven days, a blue cloud will descend to cover it; after seventy days, blue *qi* will rise, connecting with the cloud above. After a hundred days, *lingzhi* will grow, its form as depicted in the illustrations.

On a *yin-mao* day (Tiger-Rabbit), at the hour when the sun casts no shadow, take three *chi* of blue silk, hold a bone knife, and perform the *Yu Bu* (Yu’s Pace). Cut the *lingzhi*, taking care not to look back. Return and dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then grind it to powder. Take one *daogui* (knife-tip measure) with well-flower water, thrice daily. When the *lingzhi* is exhausted, you will become light-bodied. Spirits will come to welcome you, and you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, enduring with heaven and earth forever.

On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), dig a pit on the southern slope of a mountain, eight *chi* deep and eight *chi* square. Take two *jin* of cinnabar, grind it to powder, wrap it in red realgar (removing any impurities), and place it within. Moisten it with two *sheng* of *xuanshen* (figwort root), then cover with soil and tamp it down. After eight days, a red cloud will constantly cover it; after eighty days, red *qi* like smoke will rise, connecting with the cloud. After a hundred days, red *lingzhi* will grow, its form as depicted.

On a *si-wu* day (Snake-Horse), at the hour when the sun casts no shadow, perform the *Yu Bu*, take eight *chi* of crimson silk, and use a wooden knife to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back. Return and dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then prepare a *fangcunbi* (square-inch spoon) measure. Take one dose daily at dawn, when the sun is less than a *zhang* above the horizon, with well-flower water. When the *lingzhi* is exhausted, the Three Corpses, Nine Worms, seven illnesses, wild-dog lung afflictions, accumulations, and all diseases will transform into turbid blood, expelled through the nose and mouth. Wash with well-flower water, and you will be able to walk upon water, unscathed by flames, and abstain from grain without hunger. Those who leave the world must not enter the bedchamber or consume blood foods. Then, dragon chariots and a host of immortals will come to welcome you. If you wish to remain among the people, do not cultivate this *lingzhi*.

On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), dig a pit on the northern slope of a western mountain, six *chi* deep and six *chi* square. Take one *jin* of gold, refine it with fire, and place it in the pit. Pour in one *sheng* of *lingshan hexi* (crane’s-knee grass), one *hu* of clear wine, and one *hu* of duckweed. Cover with soil and tamp it down. After six days, a white cloud will descend to cover it; after sixty days, yellow *qi* like steam will rise, connecting with the cloud above. After a hundred days, yellow *lingzhi* will grow, its form as depicted.

On a *shen-you* day (Monkey-Rooster), at the *shen-you* hour, at the hour when the sun casts no shadow, take six *chi* of white silk, perform the *Yu Bu*, and use a gold knife to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back. Return and dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then prepare a three-finger pinch. When the *lingzhi* is exhausted, the old will become young again, the young will bloom with radiance, white hair will turn black, and fallen teeth will regrow.

On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), dig a pit five *chi* deep and five *chi* square on the shady side of a northern mountain. Bury three *jin* of processed realgar within, placing it in a vessel of wrought bronze. Pour two *sheng* of sesame oil over it, then cover with one *jin* of realgar powder. Tamp down the soil. After five days, a black cloud will descend to cover it; after fifty days, purple *qi* will rise, connecting with the black cloud above. After a hundred days, purple *lingzhi* will grow, its form as depicted. On that night, its light will illuminate everything within a *li*, and on overcast days, even the finest hairs will be visible.

On a *ren-gui* day (Water days), at the hour when the sun casts no shadow, perform the *Yu Bu* with a horn knife, and use five *chi* of black silk to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back. Dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then grind it into powder on a *zi-hai* day (Rat-Pig). Take a five-*fen* spoonful once daily, at midnight, facing north. When the *lingzhi* is exhausted, the old will transform into children.

Women may also consume this *lingzhi*. The *Siming Taiyi* (Director of Destinies and Great Unity) will dispatch immortal officials to welcome them, granting them a lifespan equal to Heaven’s, impervious to blades, unscorched by fire, undrenched by water, and untouched by the Five Poisons. Evil spirits will flee, and hunger and thirst will be unknown.

Those who consume these four *lingzhi* will attain immortality without end. Wherever they go, celestial officials will arrange divine feasts, and they may choose to abstain from food. As they travel, the mountains and marshes will provide dragon and tiger mounts, while ghosts and spirits will pay homage and obey their commands.

Guard this secret.

The commentator says: From this, we see that the numbers of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, can transform and give life to the myriad things—it cannot be said that they do not exist.

Just as the yang burning-mirror draws fire and the yin burning-mirror draws water, and as fire is kindled by splitting bamboo—how can one say there is no resonance? With a cinnabar crucible, mercury is transformed, stirred by the essence of the Great Yang. What thing cannot be transmuted? What transmutation cannot be accomplished?

Through the borrowed forms of things, transformation gives birth. Store this in a golden casket; guard it closely and do not leak its secrets.

The Dao possesses those of bone destiny—when it encounters your form, diligently cultivate goodness, and the Registrar of Life will strike your name from the ledger of death. Heaven and Earth will merge as one, and you shall wander above the Nine Heavens, roam throughout the Six Directions, with divine penetration and clarity, enjoying boundless longevity.

The verdant chart remains verdant, like kingfisher feathers, its color unchanged even after a hundred days.

Here ends the *Essential Scripture of the Upper Clarity Bright Mirror*. #1 The character 『臣』 in the original text was mistakenly written for 『日』.
