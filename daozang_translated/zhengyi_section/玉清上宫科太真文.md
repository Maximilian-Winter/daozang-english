The Ninth Section of the First Scroll, presided over by the Twenty-Four Myriad Officials of the Primordial Qi Cavern-Luminous Ministry of Grand Immortals.

The Nine Articles of the Grand Perfected Writ serve to examine the conduct of superior perfected ones in their immortal practice. Minor trials span three years, confronting myriad hardships; intermediate trials entail the loss of bodily form and immortal rank; major trials extend nine years, where after the wind-blade tribulation, one forfeits the human Dao.

Minor merit manifests as radiant light in the world, with the Three Realms offering protection, averting untimely and unjust calamities. Intermediate merit commands the service of ten thousand spirits, naturally summoning the Five Emperors, and befriending perfected immortals. Great merit culminates in Dao attainment, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, ascending to the celestial palaces, and roaming freely in the Upper Clarity. The merits and transgressions are categorized according to the Grand Perfected Writ. All talismans within the scroll are inscribed in vermilion.
