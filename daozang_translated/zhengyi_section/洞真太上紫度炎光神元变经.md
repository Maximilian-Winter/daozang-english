### *The Purple Ascension and Flaming Radiance: Preface*

The *Purple Ascension and Flaming Radiance* is not a text with an original composition; rather, it is a divine scripture that coalesced from the void, its qi congealing into chapters. Its mysterious radiance blazes forth, accumulating over seven thousand years before its words manifested.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bound its chapters with purple orchids and inscribed its main text upon golden tablets, thus recording it as *The Scripture of the Purple Ascension, Flaming Radiance, and Mysterious Transformations*. The *Scripture of Mysterious Transformations* derives its name from the transformations within the Mystery.

Once the mysterious chapters were established, the Highest Jade Sovereign commanded three thousand Golden Dawn Jade Lads and three thousand Western Flower Jade Maidens to attend upon the text, guarding it within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Six Harmonies. The Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen presides over it.

### *Record of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity*

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity was born at the inception of the Primordial Azure, his luminous essence penetrating the Mystery. At the very beginning, before qi had coalesced, he formed the ancestral method of the Fragrant Lineage. His radiance connected with the numinous, purple clouds flashing like lightning, mysterious mists flowing like mist, and cinnabar brilliance entwining all. Subtle awakening arose in concealment, and he absorbed the supreme契, unfolding in pure harmony. Exhaling and inhaling the dark tides, he descended into the womb of a numinous being, nourished by the curved mushrooms of the Dharma Spring.

At fourteen years of age, his golden countenance shone from within, and jade splendor radiated without. His wisdom was cavernous, his spirit keen, and he clearly perceived the Void and the Mystery. He was entrusted with the imperial title and charged with purifying the rosy clouds of the Nine Empyreans, gazing upon the source of the Cavernous Clarity. He discerned the mechanisms of the Utmost Mystery, mastered the convergence of myriad streams, accumulated resonance in the dark convergence, and awakened the wondrous spontaneity of nature.

Thus, he obtained the method of riding the *Purple Ascension and Flaming Radiance* to return the spirit, soar through the empyrean, and ascend to the exalted heights of the Jade Clarity. When his Dao was complete, he transmitted it to the Central Yellow Venerable Lord.

### *The Queen Mother of the West Bestows the Scripture and Composes Three Hymns*

**First Hymn:**
She chants and sings on the Ninefold Mystery Terrace,
Where cliffs and ridges congeal in chill clarity.
Her mind aligns the six senses,
Her eyes cast off the dust and dregs.
Flowing rosy clouds illuminate the golden chamber,
The empty hall disperses mysterious fragrance.
Accumulated resonance summons the descent of the numinous,
Though form is solitary, its concealment is also divided.
In an instant, she gazes upon ten thousand kalpas,
How could she perceive the span of a billion cedars?
The flourishing garden embellishes the numinous steps,
Cinnabar jade glows in the courtyard of gems.
The flowing wind scatters through the Cavernous Void,
Jade pipes ride the luminous emptiness.
Purple mist entwines the curved script,
Cinnabar radiance reflects the green canopy.
Flying banners flourish beneath the mysterious canopy,
Feathered tablets gleam in the Purple Clarity.
Ascending the light to the borders of the Nine Empyreans,
She roams and plays in the Phoenix City.
She wishes to receive the honored disciple,
To share one joy with those born at dawn.

**Second Hymn:**
She soars with reins, guiding the mysterious radiance,
Resting in the light beyond the wilds.
Wandering in search of the numinous one,
She joins her form in celebration at the empyrean’s edge.
Her hands part the vermilion gates,
Her eyes are as vast as the divine surge.
The golden towers rise in majestic splendor,
The clear scene is free of dust and filth.
She loosens her robe at the Terrace of the Mysterious Vault,
Fulfilling my deepest wishes.
Discarding her sandals, she transcends the three difficulties,
Preserving refinement to secure longevity.

**Third Hymn:**
*(Translation of the third hymn omitted in the provided text.)*

### *The Method of Summoning the Unbounded and Observing the Heavens Within the Central Quadrant of the Purple Ascension and Flaming Radiance*

At the inception of the Celestial Emperor’s formation, he studied the Dao of summoning the perfected. With distant thoughts and far-reaching vision, he contemplated inwardly, sitting in observation of the boundless. His cavernous contemplation pierced the hidden void. At the age of three, he mastered the central quadrant, his true spirit unveiled in clarity. He foresaw what had not yet come to pass, exhaustively surveying the bounds of the utmost heavens. No mystery was left unilluminated, no height left unattended, no depth left unregarded. Thus, he received the title of Great Emperor, bestowed through accumulated resonance—how could it have been his natural endowment?

He regularly performed this at dawn, when the celestial light had not yet brightened, and the pure radiance first emerged. He rubbed his hands together until warm, then wiped his eyes and their four corners twenty-one times. He clicked his teeth twenty-four times, swirled his tongue around his mouth, top and bottom, until the mushroom elixir and saliva arose together, and swallowed the saliva nine times.

Upon completion, he covered his body with a cap and robe, lay down in stillness, and aligned the central quadrant. He ensured both inner and outer quietude, hearing no sounds. Covering his ears with his hands and closing his eyes, he inwardly visualized his body nine myriad *li* to the east, seeing mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the peoples of the Hu and Yue as if before his eyes. He made them distinct and precise, without wavering in his contemplation. With prolonged practice, he naturally saw them.

Once they became distinct, he heard the resonant sounds of bells and drums in his ears. After a long while, he saw the immortal officials of the Eastern Marchmount, riding azure dragons and azure clouds, holding the five sacred mushrooms. They were accompanied by twelve jade maidens, clad in flying azure feathered skirts, bearing the Azure Essence Jade Embryo in a golden tray, offering it to his body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, he bowed in reverence and received it, consuming it. He tasted its sweetness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed qi nine times before stopping.

After three years of such practice, he could see events ten thousand *li* away and hear sounds from ten thousand *li* distant, all with perfect clarity. He foresaw future auspices and inauspicious omens, the length of years, and the portents of life. His body emitted wondrous radiance, and he perceived both the exterior and interior with cavernous vision.

The Dao of summoning the unbounded is supremely wondrous; it is transmitted orally and not committed to writing.

Next, he contemplated in the same manner, inwardly visualizing nine myriad *li* to the south, seeing mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, the earth’s hues, birds, beasts, and the peoples of Yue, all as if before his eyes. He made them distinct and precise, without wavering in his contemplation. With prolonged practice, he naturally saw them.

Once they became distinct, he heard the clamor of a hundred pipes in his ears. After a long while, he saw the immortal officials of the Southern Marchmount, riding flying dragons beneath cloud canopies, holding flowered banners. They were accompanied by twelve jade maidens, clad in flying azure brocade skirts, bearing the Dark Net and Crimson Fruits in a golden tray, offering them to his body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, he bowed in reverence and received them, consuming them. He tasted their sourness, then wiped his eyes nine times before stopping.

After three years of this practice, he naturally perceived the hidden depths of the void, his eyes seeing beyond ten thousand *li*, his ears hearing sounds from ten thousand *li* away. With prolonged cultivation, all became radiantly clear, and he could foreknow the auspicious and inauspicious events yet to come. His body took on the luster of jade, and his face shone with jade-like light. This is the Way of Summoning the Nonexistent.

Next, he again contemplated as before, inwardly visualizing the lands nine ten-thousand *li* to the west: its mountains, rivers, earth’s hues, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the dark-haired elders, all as if before his eyes. He made them distinct and precise, without wavering in his contemplation. With prolonged practice, he naturally saw them.

Once they became distinct, he heard the clamor of gongs and drums in his ears. After a long while, he saw the immortal officials of the Western Marchmount, riding a flying chariot of pale mist, accompanied by twelve jade maidens clad in dark brocade skirts. They bore the Golden Liquid Elixir, held in a golden tray, and offered it to his body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, he bowed in reverence and received it, consuming it. He tasted its sweetness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed *qi* nine times before stopping.

After three years of this, his vision became penetratingly clear, perceiving all events—auspicious and inauspicious, fortune and misfortune—beyond ten thousand *li* as if they had not yet come to pass. His face shone with golden light. This is the Way of Summoning the Nonexistent, a method so profound it cannot be transmitted in writing, only passed from mouth to mouth.

Next, he contemplated as before, inwardly visualizing the lands nine ten-thousand *li* to the north: its mountains, rivers, earth’s hues, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and the Qiang elders, all as if before his eyes. He made them distinct and precise, without wavering in his contemplation. With prolonged practice, he naturally saw them.

Once they became distinct, he heard the resonant chime of bells in his ears. After a long while, he saw the immortal officials of the Northern Marchmount, riding a flying chariot of dark clouds, holding the Five Mushrooms. They were accompanied by twelve jade maidens clad in dark brocade skirts, bearing the Jade Liquid and Langyu Elixir in a golden tray, offering them to his body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, he bowed in reverence and received them, consuming them. He tasted their bitterness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed *qi* nine times before stopping.

After three years of this, he could perceive the eight directions, fathom the hidden and the void, and see beyond all limits while seated. His body became light, his essence bright, and he could sit or stand in empty space. This is the Way of Summoning the Nonexistent, so utterly true it defies description.

Next, he contemplated as before, inwardly visualizing his own body piercing through to the palaces and terraces above the Nine Heavens, its mountains, forests, flying birds, and running beasts, the boundless edges of cloud cliffs, where he joined the assembled perfected ones and conversed with the host of immortals. He made them distinct and precise, without wavering in his contemplation. With prolonged practice, he naturally saw them clearly.

Once they became distinct, he heard in his ears the sounds of the five tones and chiming jade, as if audible. After a long while, he saw the immortal officials of the Central Marchmount, riding a dragon of yellow mist, accompanied by twelve jade maidens clad in yellow flying skirts. They held five-colored banners and bore the Five Mushroom Elixir in a golden tray, offering it to his body.

Upon seeing the immortal officials, he bowed in reverence and received it, consuming it. He tasted its fragrance, then wiped his eyes and swallowed *qi* twelve times before stopping.

This is the Purple Radiance of the Blazing Light, the supreme and wondrous method of Summoning the Nonexistent, so profound it cannot be spoken aloud. After three years of practice, he perceived the hidden depths of the void, saw through the dark and mysterious, calculated lifespan and destiny, and discerned the omens of fortune and misfortune. His entire being became penetratingly clear, and his face shone with golden light.

After visualizing the five directions, he rose and faced east, knocking his teeth nine times, and prayed:
*"The myriad transformations arise as one, the Dark Net governs the void. The turning wheel makes no sound, yet revolves through the four directions. Its flowing light spans ten thousand *li*, piercing through the empty vastness. The Three Essences, treasured luminaries, fly through the misty chambers. The morning essence infuses the dark, opening the nine apertures. The four convergences and eight reaches unite—visualizing the void to summon the nonexistent. May my spirit become wise, clearly discerning fortune and misfortune. Mounting the dark chariot, its green carriage poles soaring, I ascend to the Great Dawn and prostrate before the Jade Emperor."*

This is the method of the Celestial Lord’s inward visualization for Summoning the Nonexistent and penetrating sight, its efficacy immediate and unmatched. When contemplating the central direction with focused intent, after a hundred days in seclusion, faint signs will appear. After three years, the spirit will merge with the dark and penetrate all, nothing left unseen. This may be called summoning the true within the nonexistent, where the true descends. The Way is subtle and hidden, beyond worldly discourse.

Men value rank and emolument; I value this Way. Even the lord of the four seas would find it difficult to obtain this method—I have never heard of it. This is the root of my undying Way: foreknowing the yet-to-be, perceiving the hidden and the void, measuring the boundless above, hearing echoes from ten thousand *li* away, and comprehending the wonders of the world—what could surpass it?

Those who attain this will ride a green carriage, a canopy of flying mist and dark clouds, ascending to the Celestial Dawn. It must be treasured and kept secret; do not rashly transmit it. To violate this and reveal the true scripture is to burden oneself, one’s ancestral masters, the seven lineages, and parents with ghostly servitude, consigning the body to the dark springs and suffering the trials of the Three Officials. The hardships will be unbearable—beware and take heed.

When receiving and practicing the Purple Radiance of the Blazing Light, the method of cultivating the true and Summoning the Nonexistent for penetrating sight, one should always do so in a separate, secluded chamber, free from worldly affairs. In stillness, contemplate and visualize the lands beyond ten thousand *li* in the four directions: their mountains, forests, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, peoples, the dark-haired Yi, Qiang, Hu, and Cang elders, and all strange beings, all coming to pay homage to one’s body.

Then visualize one’s own eyes emitting flowing fire, like falling stars of crimson radiance, their light filling the space beyond ten thousand *li*. The mountains, marshes, Huai and Ji rivers, and forests all dissolve in this brilliance, the heavens becoming utterly clear and pure, free of dust and filth. The gaze reaches the boundless realm, penetrating all without obstruction.

Make all this distinct and precise, knock the teeth nine times, and pray facing upward:
*"The dark light shines inwardly, penetrating all without limit. Sight and hearing become piercingly clear, the nine apertures open wide. Flowing essence rushes forth, ten thousand *li* of purity unobstructed. Seated, I perceive the natural, foreknowing fortune and misfortune. Mounting the flying mist, I ascend to the great void."*

Upon completion, draw in *qi* and swallow saliva seven times, then cease.

Should one cultivate this Dao, within a hundred days, faint traces will appear; in three years, the eyes will perceive the hollow void, seated one may see beyond ten thousand *li*, the ears hear sounds from ten thousand *li* away. The ultimate and wondrous Dao cannot be transmitted through writing—it is passed mouth to mouth, received with solemn secrecy.

**Flowing Gold Fire Bell**

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell employs the radiant *qi* of the Most High Lord of the Great Dao in his wanderings and feasts, striking upward to rouse the might of the Nine Heavens, annihilating below the inauspicious forces of the Six Heavens. The void-reflected radiance of the Lord of the Dao crowns his neck, its flowing light illuminating the eight directions for three hundred thousand *li*.

At the inception of the Three Heavens’ rectification, when the Six Heavens were abolished, it was transmitted to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The divine scripture is concealed within the Jade Palace’s chambers of crystal, its void-light self-luminous, resplendent in the Supreme Clarity. Flying dragons and venomous beasts flank its sides, purple clouds and dark radiance canopy its summit. Jade Flower maidens and Golden Perfected youths, three hundred each, attend the numinous scripture, scattering incense in the void courtyard.

After seven thousand years, it transformed into five talismans, their light penetrating the eight directions, giving rise to the officials of the Five Quarters’ protective encampments. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Posterior Sage Lord of the Golden Portals, who entrusted it to the Azure Lad of the Left Minister, charging him to confer it upon those who attain Perfected status, that they might wear it and wander the Supreme Clarity.

Those who study the Real yet lack the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, whose necks do not bear the halo of radiance, shall not ascend to the Three Luminaries. Only those with bones of gold and jade, whose names are inscribed in the Azure Palace, may receive this scripture. Wearing it as they walk, all heavens and earths, the Four Seas and Five Peaks, the hosts of celestial saints and immortal officials, will bow in reverence, their divine lights startled into motion. Its command is not to be taken lightly: the Three Primes dispatch thirty-six Jade Lads and Maidens to attend and guard their person. After wearing it for nine years, one may ride the Eight Effulgences Jade Chariot, soaring through the Great Void.

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell is the essence of the Nine Stars, also called the Halo of Radiance. The mighty seal of the Most High arose before the Nine Heavens, congealing *qi* into script, its luminous brilliance blazing through the ten directions, its suspended essence casting its reflection upon the neck of the Most High. After ten thousand years, it transformed into five bell talismans of divine power, descending to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, who wielded its might to subdue the demons of the farthest heavens, its numinous presence spreading through the courts of the Nine Auroras, commanding all beneath the heavens without exception.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao treasures and conceals this Dao, instructing the celestial overseers of the myriad heavens’ Perfected Immortals to investigate and punish those who lightly divulge it. Should one possess the talent of a Perfected Immortal and receive this talisman, yet transmit it carelessly to the unworthy, defiling the sacred scripture with irreverence, their seven ancestors will suffer calamity, their former masters will be examined, and all will be consigned to the offices of ghosts.

Inscribe it in vermilion upon two feet and two inches of purple silk, and wear it upon the head. Those with names of gold and bones of jade who receive this scripture are destined by past lives to become immortals. As they wear the talisman and move about, they must constantly visualize a halo of radiance crowning their necks, illuminating beyond three hundred thousand *li*. Within nine years, through diligent devotion to the Real, fasting with single-minded resolve, they may summon the descent of true numina, their halo shining of its own accord, allowing them to ride the void, seated or standing, to command life and death.

**Five Bells Ascending Void, Treading Emptiness, Preserving Immortality Talisman—also called Fire Bell**

When the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity first received *qi*, at the primordial division of the dark image, he ascended the Terrace of Ninefold Mystery’s Void Generation. The Five Thearchs’ divine officials guarded the eight directions; the five talismans’ void-reflected light flickered between presence and absence, veiled in mist upon the Phoenix Terrace, within the winding chambers of the crystal palace.

After seven thousand years, the scripture manifested, its flowing light blazing through the Nine Heavens, its precious scripture glowing richly in the Jade Clarity. Cast to the left, it becomes the Flowing Gold Fire Bell; shaken to the right, it becomes the Diadem of the Seven Primes’ Dispersal, subduing the demons of the farthest heavens, its might spreading through the courts of the Nine Auroras. The ultimate and wondrous Dao is profound and subtle beyond measure.

The Celestial Emperor then fasted in the void upon the Crystal Terrace, within the Jade Chamber of the Cavern Real’s Hall, the Golden Flower’s chambers. Attendant maidens and host Perfected, ten myriad myriad multicolored divine officials, flying beasts and venomous dragons flanked the portals, guarding the gates. Serpents of a thousand *xun* patrolled the walls; phoenix cries and dragon roars, a hundred sounds, echoed through the halls. Might resounded through the vast courtyard; lions roared; celestial hymns were sung; jade tones flowed like scattered gems. Divine consorts harmonized in song; Jade Maidens plucked and strummed the strings.

Thereupon, I summoned the Central Yellow Thearch Lord Lao and the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, offering dew of flowing auroras and fruits of adamantine rings, red trees with white seeds, intertwined hidden mushrooms, and myriad fragrances wafting for ninety days.

Then the Tortoise Mother held the brush, the Great One swept the mat, Heavenly Consorts attended the incense, Jade Flowers bound the scroll. Inscribed upon white jade slips in golden script, it was entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealed in a cloud-brocade satchel of jade cases, and transmitted to the Central Yellow Thearch Lord Lao. In accordance with the covenant, he received the Five Talismans, bowed, and withdrew. Immediately, he summoned the Nine Numinous Flowing Effulgence Cloud Chariot, fifty myriad Five-Colored Divine Officials, clad in azure kingfisher-feathered dragon capes, ascending to the Golden Portals and Jade Clarity’s palaces.

Should one’s name be inscribed in the Eastern Florescence and behold this scripture, their past destiny calls them to immortality. Wearing the talisman as they walk, the myriad spirits come to pay homage. Emerging from the void, entering the constellations, circling the Five Peaks, traversing the Five Stars, their bodies generate water and fire, transforming the ten directions. After wearing it for nine years, green chariots descend to convey them upward to the Three Primes, where they ascend to the rank of Jade Clarity.

This Dao is secret and wondrous, transmitted only to the true. Those who lightly divulge its passages will perish, their forms destroyed. According to the luminous statutes of the Mysterious Real, it may be transmitted to one person every seven thousand years. Those who violate the covenant and betray their oaths will bring calamity upon their seven lineages, themselves and their former masters alike consigned to the lower ghosts, enduring ten torments and eight tribulations.

Men inscribe in cinnabar upon azure silk and wear it to the left; women inscribe in yellow upon white silk and wear it to the right.

**Flowing Gold Fire Bell, Internally Store the Invocation of Mighty Might, Divine Wisdom**

When wearing the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, whether traveling near or far, passing through perilous places beset by bandits or illness, or beneath calamitous harm, one must concentrate on the true light to guard oneself, opening a path of ten thousand miles. At the outset of a journey, face directly toward the direction, strike the left teeth twice seven times, and swallow qi thirty-six times. Then visualize the forms of the place—its mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, birds, beasts, and spirits—all clearly and brightly coming to pay homage to one’s body. Envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper covering one’s head, then concentrate on one’s left eye as a Shooting Star and the right eye as Swift Lightning, their radiance blazing forth. The Shooting Star shines ninety thousand miles away, revealing the path ahead, its light parting mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people’s dwellings, soldiers, bandits, and ghostly qi, causing them to vanish without a trace, the four roads suddenly clear. Then recite the incantation:

*"Ahead opens, behind closes,
Heaven levels, earth rises.
Divine lords go forth,
The four roads open wide.
Let heaven and earth
Become my bridge.
Before and behind, left and right,
All eight directions penetrate.
To the left, I cast the Shooting Star,
To the right, Swift Lightning’s glow.
Flowing fire spans ten thousand miles—
What demon dares stand before me?
The Great One escorts,
Ten thousand spirits come to greet.
Wherever I turn,
All is auspicious and good.
Riding clouds, mounting the void,
I ascend to the Great Emptiness."*

When finished, draw the essence of both eyes back to their palaces. Inhale seven qi from the left, seven qi from the right, and swallow them. Thus, one may brave dangers and traverse difficulties, subdue ghosts and vanquish soldiers, with all responding instantly and resoundingly. This method is most wondrous and must not be recklessly transmitted.

The Five Thearchs’ Flowing Bells and Five Talismans command the demons of the utmost heavens, summon and bind the spirits of the five directions, correspond above to the Five Mornings and align with the Seven Origins, respond below to the human body’s nine orifices and seven luminaries, encircle heaven and earth, leaving nothing unconnected, no darkness unprobed, no detail unseen. When concentrating on the talisman, first store its power; when casting it, manifest its might. If you wear it, receive the master’s oral instructions.

Should you encounter a place haunted by malevolent ghosts in the human realm, perform the Invocation of Mighty Might. Face north, hold the breath for twelve cycles, and envision the qi of the five directions covering your crown and entire body, inside and out, radiantly clear, with nothing visible. Then strike the teeth thirty-six times, swallow the qi of the five directions, and with each swallow, expel the qi of the three directions, allowing all to enter your body. Concentrate on the light of your eyes’ pupils like shooting stars, blazing in the five directions, and recite the incantation:

*"Celestial Origin’s Seven Essences,
Five Thearchs’ Flowing Bells,
Blazing, casting lightning’s glow,
Like celestial shooting stars.
Radiance illumines the ten directions,
Revealing ghosts’ true forms.
What petty demon
Dares approach my gate of life?
The Supreme has decreed:
Slay without mercy,
Sever livers, carve bellies,
Exterminate ghostly essences.
Thousands upon thousands all shattered,
Myriads upon myriads all toppled.
Divine might utters the incantation,
Binding and seizing without cease."*

When finished, swallow qi thirty-six times to conclude. With this single incantation, the five directions’ divine officials will all protect your life, swiftly seizing the numinous qi of the place and binding it to appear before you. Three recitations will exterminate the ghost king’s lineage.

When entering the Five Marchmounts, traversing mountains and rivers, braving dangers and scaling peaks, one must, a hundred paces before reaching the place, strike the left teeth thirty-six times. If going to the Eastern Marchmount, envision the Eastern Thearch’s Azure Emperor, the Rare Forest Pearl Officials and their retinue of nine thousand, guarding your front, back, left, and right, with the qi of Azure Auroras covering your crown. If going to the Southern Marchmount, envision the Southern Thearch’s Crimson Emperor, the Cinnabar Mystery Master and his retinue of eight thousand, guarding your front and back, with the qi of Vermilion Auroras covering your crown. If going to the Western Marchmount, envision the Western Thearch’s White Emperor, the Lesser Radiant Spirit and his retinue of five thousand, guarding your front and back, with the qi of Pristine Auroras covering your crown. If going to the Northern Marchmount, envision the Northern Thearch’s Black Emperor, the Mysterious Darkness Radiance and his retinue of five thousand, guarding your front and back, with the qi of Dark Auroras covering your crown. If going to the Central Marchmount, envision the Central Thearch’s Yellow Emperor, the Upholding Center Primal Officials and their retinue of twelve thousand, guarding your front and back, with the qi of Yellow covering your entire body. Then recite the incantation:

The Radiant Spirits of Qian Heaven, the Seven Luminaries’ Mysterious Essences, the Five Dipper’s Florid Canopy encircle and bind my form. Five-hued flying auroras intermingle and merge, my body girded with the Seven Primes, streaming with golden fire-bells, flashing and hurling boundlessly, reaching the utmost heights of heaven’s obscurity. The Five Thearchs’ divine officials command the celestial hosts to seize and restrain for me: the mountains and rivers, the earth gods, the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits all come to bow their heads, offering up their true forms. Those before are executed, those behind are slain—none captured escape. Thus concluded.

With this single incantation, the demons of heaven vanish without trace, and the myriad spirits come to pay homage. When roaming the Five Marchmounts, treading the mountains and rivers, you shall suffer no trials or perils. The immortals of the Five Marchmounts will themselves present the Five Mushrooms and Five Vital Jade Flowers to sustain your body.

If amidst military siege, beneath the hanging blades of execution, or in dire straits, knock the right teeth twelve times, envision the Seven Stars covering your body, their mysterious light penetrating and illuminating, surrounding you entirely. Envision the liver as Jupiter, emerging on the left; the lungs as Venus, emerging on the right; the heart as Mars, emerging before you; the kidneys as Mercury, emerging behind; the spleen as Saturn, emerging above the chest. Let the essences of the Five Stars coil around your front and back, your body dwelling within the Dipper’s Bowl, beneath the Five Stars.

Then envision the Five Thearchs’ divine officials guarding your left and right, and recite the incantation:
Heaven is my roof,
Earth is my bed,
The Five Marchmounts and rivers are my bridges,
The Mysterious Dipper’s Primal Essence is my raiment.
Concealed within the Seven Primes,
In the land of flowing fire,
He who measures me is Taiyi Wuyou,
He who passes me is Baiyuan Wuying.
Disaster cannot assail,
Weapons cannot harm.
May my body ascend to the Golden Gates,
The Capital of the Nine Elders.
Thus concluded.

In such dire straits, even at the brink of death, you shall attain liberation.

Five bolts of five-colored brocade, each fifty feet in length, to entreat the divine officials of the Five Thearchs. Five taels of purple gold, as pledge of faith to the Five Directions. Five catties of agarwood, to ascend and reach the Three Primes. One tael of true pearls, as oath for the cinnabar covenant. One writing knife, to sever the path of deathly qi. Seven gold pearls, to offer to the essences of the Seven Primes. Seventy feet of crimson silk, to embody the qi of blazing radiance.

For all who receive the talismanic scriptures, they must present precious pledges to their master, purify themselves with a three-day fast, bathe, burn incense, and inscribe the talismans and scriptures. These are then placed in the open upon a high altar for one night. At dawn, master and disciple ascend the altar together, report to the Northern Thearch, present the covenant text, and transmit the talismanic scriptures to the disciple.

Should one fail to ascend the altar and make the oath, they must not rashly open the scrolls. If the master carelessly divulges the scriptures, their body will suffer the trial of the wind-knife. If the disciple receives them but unfurls the scroll, calamity will extend to the Seven Mysteries, leaving them maimed and blind. The statutes of the Four Poles forbid the careless divulgence of scriptures; the laws of the Great Scriptures forbid transmission without covenant oaths. Unless one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade, they shall not hear or see them.

For those who seek immortality: without the Five Talismans worn upon the body, the immortal officials of the Five Marchmounts will not guard their form, the registers of the dead will not shed their mortal names. Dwelling in mountain caves, they will be overpowered by the Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens; venturing among men, they will not escape official oppression or the blade of weapons. Those who wear the talismans shall be sheltered by Heaven above, moving freely without restraint, their will circulating without hindrance.

Envisioning the perfected ones returning to their original palaces, the Five Mushrooms and Five Lives manifest, their bodies suffused with jade radiance. Immortal officials stand guard, the Three Primes attend their chambers, they ride clouds and mount the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity.

One hundred days after receiving the talismans, take five five-inch paulownia boards and inscribe each with a talisman. Also prepare five inscribed tablets, recording the year, month, and day of the new moon, the name of the disciple (e.g., Wang of such-and-such commandery, such-and-such village, Master of the Marchmounts), their age, and which Thearch’s child they belong to, and which Marchmount they are affiliated with. Bury the talismans and tablets at the Five Marchmounts. At the moment of burial, knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the prayer:

*I report above to the Three Primes, the Jade Emperor the Venerable; below I announce to the Five Marchmounts and the divine officials of the Five Colors. Having received the Flowing Bell and the true words of the Five Talismans, I fast with five incenses and inscribe my name upon the mountains and rivers. I entreat the perfected immortals to come and guard my form. The Five Mushrooms—yellow, black, white, red, and blue—flow forth; my body generates water and fire; the Fire Bell shines brilliantly. With dragon reins, I ascend to my chamber, mounting the Jade Court.*

Thus, the immortal officials of the Five Directions will guard the disciple’s body, transmitting the Way of divine perfected ones. Roaming the Five Marchmounts and seas, the hundred spirits will all come to pay homage.

**The Divine Candle of Night Illumination**

The Divine Candle of Night Illumination was bestowed upon the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity by the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens. Ascending a nine-tiered terrace, within the golden halls of purple orchids, the jade chambers, the divine candle is lit before the Five Thearchs. With reverent vows and disciplined practice, following the scriptures, reciting prayers, and concentrating the mind, after nine hundred days, the spirit is moved and the numinous responds. Thereupon, the Five Thearchs descend with their spirit talismans, void-born in the Five Directions, resplendent in the Highest Clarity. Their inner radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the void, unfathomable to gaze upon, indestructible even if burned, their brilliance illuminating the jade chambers.

After seven hundred years, the divine scripture appears. Five-colored beasts guard the talisman beside the lamp, recorded as the Divine Candle of Night Illumination, the Numinous Talisman of Penetrating Light. Five colors blaze resplendently, piercing through the Five Directions.

The Thearch then retreats to fast in the Highest Clarity. With purple gold, the scripture is cast in the midst of the Great Void. Auspicious omens announce its revelation. The Mother of Turtles holds the brush, the Great One brushes the mat. Inscribed upon gold tablets, bound with purple cords, it is entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital for safekeeping. Above, jade palaces and purple clouds gather; below, ethereal fragrance scatters like mist. Thirty-six jade lads stand in attendance, transmitting it to the Nine Mysterious Thearchs of the Golden Gates, the Posterity of the Sage, and the Green Lad of the Highest Minister. Later, it is passed to worthy disciples destined to become perfected ones.

This dharma-treasure is secret, not transmitted to the lower world. Only those with bones of gold and marrow of jade, whose names are recorded in the Green Palace and inscribed in the Highest Clarity, may receive this scripture. Those who obtain it shall become perfected ones. Practicing for nine years, their divine radiance will naturally arise, their bodies luminous, their qi pure. Riding the void and mounting the sky, they ascend to the Thearch’s hall.

**Hymn of the Green Thearch’s Divine Candle**
Place the candle in the East. At the hour of human quietude, enter the chamber facing east. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly envision the green qi of the East, its radiance filling the room. Bow before the lamp, kneel, and recite the hymn:

*Vast and obscure, the primal perfection,
Swift and clear, the qi soars high.
The original thread knows no bounds,
Feathered script shines bright and rises.
Seeking through ten thousand kalpas,
The great radiance descends as the divine lamp.
Washing away the seven mysteries’ trials,
Suffering souls all transcend and ascend.
The void generates natural light,
The body, light, rides clouds to rise.*

**Hymn of the Red Thearch’s Divine Candle**
Place the candle in the South. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly envision the red qi of the South, its radiance filling the room. Bow before the lamp, kneel, and recite the hymn:

*The Great Void births the empty cavern,
Formless, it returns without sound.
Silent within the Primal Beginning,
The Three Purities give rise to cloudy scenes.
How desolate the secluded chamber—
The bright lamp connects thought.
Clearly beholding the natural light,
The Three Dawns share a single body.*

**Hymn of the White Thearch’s Divine Candle**
Place the candle in the West. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly envision the white qi of the West, its radiance filling the room. Bow before the lamp, kneel, and recite the hymn:

*The Three Numinous ones spit wondrous blossoms,
Threading through the ninefold heavens.
The night’s light knows no blemish,
Its precious radiance transcends intersecting paths.
Piercing the boundless wilds,
Dawn breaks into the great seclusion.
Uprooting the nine mysteries’ suffering,
Fortune flourishes as misfortune vanishes.*

**Hymn of the Black Thearch’s Divine Candle**
Place the candle in the North. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly envision the black qi of the North, its radiance filling the room. Bow before the lamp, kneel, and recite the hymn:

*How bright, the radiance of the Great Yang!
The divine light pierces the Three Clarities.
Qi scatters within the dark desert,
Ethereal mist arises in the purple court.
Controlling and riding the flying clouds,
Drifting, drifting, beyond all form.
Uprooting my seven mysteries’ ancestors,
In the Southern Palace, they are reborn anew.
Ever equal to the Three Lights,
To the ends of Heaven, without peril or collapse.*

**Hymn of the Yellow Thearch’s Divine Candle**
Place the candle in the Center. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and inwardly envision the yellow qi of the Center, its radiance filling the room. Bow before the lamp with the heart, kneel, and recite the hymn:

*The Five Thearchs unite in the Mysterious One,
The Central Origin governs the ten directions.
Seizing rectitude to aid the Great Darkness,
The hidden candle shines as brightly as the empty void.
Qi scatters without bound,
Together they cross into the divine lineage.
Offering hymns to the Perfected’s chapter,
In solemn steps, I tread the void,
Longing stirs the Jade Thearch,
Ever to visit the Three Origins’ chambers.*

This hymn is received by the Thearch-Lord from the Divine Candle’s inner recitation of the Nine Heavens’ True Kings. Through cultivated resonance, the night’s radiance brightens of itself, and the Five Thearchs’ luminous spirit talismans descend into the Thearch’s chamber.

Should your jade name be recorded above, and you awaken to the secret texts, you must present five taels of gold as an offering to the Five Directions, and fifty feet of five-colored silk to pledge alliance with the Five Thearchs. Swear your oath before the Three Origins, then receive the teachings.

The Five Thearchs’ self-generated Night Candle Divine Lamp Luminous Spirit Talismans
are born within the void,
their divine radiance mysteriously illuminating,
shining brilliantly into the Great Non-Being.
The Heavenly Thearch-Lord reveres and upholds them,
entrusting them to the Golden Watchtower’s Sage-Lord and the High Minister Azure Lad,
to be received by later students destined to become Perfected.

If your mysterious name is recorded above in the Jade Register,
you may behold this method.
Each night at the hour of human stillness, enter your chamber,
burn incense, bow before the divine lamp, and recite the texts in full.
Then face east, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and pray:

*O Mysterious Perfected, exalted and distant,
Pure radiance dispels the night’s obscurity.
The divine candle shines brightly,
The jade talisman shares in wisdom.
Perfected spirits inwardly illuminate,
Mysterious light reflects the realms.
Five-colored lads,
Their brilliance pierces all sight.
Attaining the flying chariot,
I ascend to the Thearch’s throne.*

Conclude by knocking the teeth twenty times and swallowing the qi of the Five Directions, five times each.

After five years of such practice, you will attain the self-brightening candle,
and the Five-Colored Lads will encircle your body,
their clarity penetrating distant visions,
retracing the boundless.
Keep the bright candle ever lit,
never allowing it to extinguish.

If you cannot retreat to secluded mountains and forests,
but remain among people,
place the lamp in a separate chamber,
ensuring no one of impure qi treads upon or defiles it,
offending the divine Perfected,
lest the spirit radiance fail to appear.

If you follow this method and brighten the lamp,
its light will illuminate an entire city,
vanquishing ten thousand demons and blinding a thousand ghosts.
Wherever you dwell, the Perfected Officials will encamp and guard your gate.

This method is truly secret;
do not recklessly divulge it.
Should you receive it in the dark and recklessly leak the treasured scripture,
your body will be consigned to the ghostly officials,
your seven mysteries’ ancestors will forever fill the earthly prisons,
and in the ten thousand kalpas of the dark springs,
you will have no hope of immortality.
Be ever vigilant.

The **Spirit-Stabilizing, Soul-Firming, Soaring Elixir of the Seventy-Four Directions**

**Ingredients:**
- Four liang of mica,
- Four liang of realgar,
- Niter, figwort root, sophora fruit, five liang of dragon bone,
- Polyporus, frost from Green Mound, dried tiger’s-eye flower,
- Two liang each of clove, spikenard, aloeswood,
- Frankincense, two liang of rock candy, three liang of halite,
- Eight liang each of malachite and cinnabar,
- Azurite, two liang of white quartz,
- Two liang of *Taiyang Infant’s Feather Garment*,
- Two liang of *Taiyang Essence’s Supreme Floral Radiance*,
- Four liang of peach blossom,
- Four liang each of true rose remnants,
- One sheng and two ge of *Northern Congealed Yin Essence Flowing Blossom*.

Collect these on the *jian* day of the ninth month and store in a separate vessel.

- One sheng and two ge of *Qi-Congealed, Essence-Condensed Plain Elixir*. Collect on the *jian* day of the twelfth month and store in a separate vessel.
- One sheng and two ge of *Spirit-Transformed Yin Essence Flowing Pearl*. Collect on the winter solstice and store in a separate vessel.

Combine the twenty-seven ingredients: the first twenty-four correspond to the twenty-four spirits, while the remaining three align with the *qi* of the Three Origins. Two respond to the Nine Mornings, consolidating the po and solidifying the hun, transmuting the Five Colors’ flowing yellow to shape-shift and transform without fixed form. When ingested, the spirit is stabilized and *qi* pacified.

Prepare the elixir on the *jian* day of the third month and ingest the pills on the *ren* day of the fifth month. Begin by grinding each ingredient in sequence, starting with mica, each pounded three thousand times, up to peach blossom—twenty-four ingredients in total, seventy-two thousand pestle strokes. Once complete, place each in a separate tray.

Before grinding, observe a thirty-day fast. Afterward, have a young boy pound the medicine while a young girl tends the incense. Both must be of few words, cautious in speech, kind-hearted, and naturally fragrant in flesh and bone.

Expose the twenty-four trays of medicine in the central courtyard for three nights. Ensure no chickens, dogs, or outsiders see them, and prevent exposure to sounds of weeping. After exposure, layer the ingredients into a cauldron in order: first mica, then realgar, lastly peach blossom, followed by the remaining twenty-four. Arrange them carefully, filling the cauldron.

Next, add one sheng and two ge of *Northern Congealed Yin Essence Flowing Blossom*, then one sheng and two ge of *Qi-Congealed, Essence-Condensed Plain Elixir*, and finally one sheng and two ge of *Spirit-Transformed Yin Essence Flowing Pearl*. Once all are added, pour twelve sheng of pure millet water over the medicine, then seal the cauldron with a clay lid, ensuring all inner and outer surfaces are tightly sealed to a thickness of seven fen. Place mica at the bottom, its *qi* ascending, and peach blossom atop, its color crowning the rest—thus the order is set.

First, craft two clay cauldrons using *Six-One Mud*: combine equal parts left-facing oyster shell from the East Sea, halite, red halloysite, lead oxide, talc, and earthworm soil. Grind finely, sift, and mix with hundred-day rice vinegar. Knead thoroughly to form the *Six-One Mud*. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of both cauldrons with thin layers, sun-drying until fully desiccated. Gradually build up the thickness to two and a half cun.

Once complete, construct a furnace facing south, placing the cauldron atop a solitary support at its center, elevating the base one chi and two cun above the ground. Ignite with chaff fire for three days and nights, keeping the flames nine cun from the cauldron. For nine days and nights, advance the fire to six cun away, then for another nine days and nights, bring the flames to the base—totaling twenty-seven days. Cool for three days, then open to inspect: if the medicine has ascended and adhered to the upper cauldron, the divine elixir is formed. If not, reseal with mud as before and repeat the firing for another twenty-seven days. Cool for three days; it will surely succeed.

Use a three-year-old rooster’s feather to sweep the elixir from the upper cauldron: this yields *Flying Cinnabar Purple Flowing Essence*, shimmering with a hundred shifting hues, its mysterious radiance illuminating the seventy-four directions. Ingesting a single *zhu* will cause your body to emanate seventy-four colors of flowing light. Spitting to the left summons the Three Hun, while spitting to the right transforms the Seven Po into seven child-spirits with flying nets and feathered skirts, their divine chariots and jade carriages instantly appearing before you.

Store the elixir in a cauldron tray; the essence congealed at the bottom becomes *Jade Embryo Nectar Ointment*. Blend with white honey, then grind in a mortar facing east for ten thousand strokes. Form into pills weighing one *zhu* each. Seal in an airtight vessel and expose in the central courtyard for three days and nights. Upon completion, ingest one pill at dawn. Take three pills over three days, enabling you to traverse the void, entering and exiting non-being. After seven days of taking seven pills, you will ascend amidst rosy clouds. Soaring over the Five Peaks, fifty thousand spirit-officials of the Five Colors will escort your form.

Facing east, ingest nine pills to summon emerald mists and green chariots, with azure dragons reining the steeds. Ninety *Jade Lads of the Azure Yang* and ninety *Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist*, along with nine thousand immortals of the Eastern Peak, will come to receive you.

Facing south, ingest eight pills to summon crimson mists and cloud chariots, with vermilion dragons reining the steeds. Eighty *Jade Lads of the Crimson Palace* and eighty *Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar*, along with eight thousand immortals of the Southern Peak, will come to receive you.

Facing west, ingest six pills to summon pristine mists and jade carriages, with six dragons reining the steeds. Sixty *Radiant Spirit Jade Lads* and sixty *Jade Maidens of the Supreme Simplicity*, along with six thousand immortals of the Western Peak, will come to receive you.

Facing north, ingest five pills to summon black mists and flying chariots, with dark dragons reining the steeds. Fifty *Jade Lads of the Supreme Ultimate* and fifty *Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery*, along with five thousand immortals of the Northern Peak, will come to receive you.

Facing the direction of *wu-ji* (戊己), ingest three pills to summon a jade carriage of yellow mists, with twelve flying dragons reining the steeds. Twelve *Yellow Mechanism Jade Lads* and twelve *Yellow Simplicity Jade Maidens*, along with one thousand two hundred immortals of the Central Peak, will come to receive you.

Upon completing the ingestion of the five regimens, the immortals of the Five Peaks will present a jade tablet with phoenix-script, inviting your person to ascend beneath the Nine Palaces and Golden Towers, there to receive the title of Perfected Immortal. Truly, the marvel of these numinous pills is great indeed.

All transformations manifest seventy-four kinds of gold, silver, and precious jade, along with crimson trees bearing vermilion fruits. They give rise to living water and fire, possessing wonders beyond the use of *langgan* jade, the Eight Effulgences, and the Four-Petaled Descending Numinous Elixir. These cannot be enumerated in full; only the subtleties of the great transformations are briefly outlined here.

Should you wish to roam the Five Peaks and traverse the Eight Extremities, unburdened by the toil of immortal officials or the tedium of bureaucratic duties, and if you do not yet desire to ascend to heaven, you may forgo the pills of the Five Directions. Simply ingest the regular count of seven or three pills to secure your hun-soul and anchor your po-soul, soaring through the seventy-four directions, wandering the Five Peaks, and attaining a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries.

The rest may follow the numbers of the Five Directions. If you ingest the pills of the Five Directions, you will become an overseer of the Five Peaks, assuming office and duties, and thus will be unable to move freely in the mortal world.

*Scripture on Preserving Life Through Radiant Light and Transforming Scenery*
*Taiyi Perfected One* once ascended to the *Feather Bright Wilds* beyond the Northern Desert, to the *Mystic Ridge Mountain* and the *Purple Tenuity Palace*. There, he beheld *Purple Tenuity Lady* dwelling in seclusion, her spirit serene and luminous. She gazed upward to consume the Mystic Stream, gathered and ingested the Two Images, exhaled and inhaled flying mists, reflected herself in the Five Lights, and sheltered her body with the Two Luminaries. Five-colored vapors billowed and flowed, adorning the jeweled terrace with splendor.

Looking up at the western wall of the Purple Tenuity Palace, in its northwest corner, he saw an inscribed jade slip named *The Chapter of the Five-Colored Radiant Lads*. The Perfected One purified himself for three months, then journeyed to the Purple Tenuity Palace to receive the scripture. The Purple Tenuity Lady declared it the *Scripture on Radiant Light and Transforming Scenery*. After receiving it and cultivating its practices for three years, he attained the rank of Perfected One.

This scripture is a treasure of the Purple Tenuity Lady, not to be recklessly transmitted. Without the Jade Clarion’s celestial sound or the Purple Script’s azure radiance, one may not hear or behold it. Those who practice it must purify themselves with fasting and bathing, burn incense in a secluded chamber, and meditate in stillness upon the Perfected for a hundred days. Then, five Jade Lads and five Jade Maidens will be granted to them.

If one cultivates without negligence, the Five-Colored Lads will rest in one’s chamber, and Radiant Light will circulate through one’s body, enabling ascent to the Jade Clarity. Always at the time when the clear sun rises in splendor, enter the chamber, face east, and visualize the Eastern Azure Radiance Lad, named *Azure Supreme Jade*, styled *Flying Upright*. His body is the color of azure mists, his flowing light blazing and illuminating the eastern quarter like the brilliance of lightning. He rides a carriage of azure mists, his entire being suffused with the streaming glow of Mystic Light. Feel your body transform and enter the azure light, where inner and outer merge into obscurity. After a long while, clarity returns. Knock the teeth twelve times and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Recite the invocation:
*"Eastern Lad, Azure Supreme Jade Lord, bestow upon me the Azure Mushroom and the Fountain of Radiant Light. With the Azure Mist Carriage, come receive my person, that I may ascend to the Jade Court and become a Perfected One."*

Next, visualize the Southern Lad, named *Cinnabar Radiance*, styled *Mystic Record*. His body is the color of crimson mists, his flowing light blazing in the southern quarter like the brilliance of lightning. He rides a carriage of vermilion mists, his entire being suffused with the streaming glow of Mystic Light. Feel your body enter the crimson light, where inner and outer merge into obscurity. After a long while, clarity returns. Knock the teeth twelve times and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Recite the invocation:
*"Southern Lad, Cinnabar Radiance Perfected Lord, bestow upon me the Nectar of Descending Life and the Fragrance of Radiant Jade Mushrooms. With the Vermilion Mist and Lightning Brilliance, overshadow my chamber. Ascend with me, that together we may reach the Imperial Court."*

Next, visualize the Western Lad of White Light, named *Luminous Splendor*, styled *Returning Spirit Lad*. His body is the color of pristine mists, his flowing light blazing and illuminating the western quarter like the brilliance of lightning. He rides a carriage of white mists, his entire being suffused with the streaming glow of Mystic Light. Feel your body transform and enter the white light, where inner and outer merge into obscurity, and nothing is heard or seen. After a long while, clarity returns. Knock the teeth twelve times and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Recite the invocation:
*"Western Lad, Luminous Splendor Supreme Lord, bestow upon me the Pristine Water and Jade Mushrooms, the Fountain of Flowing Pearls and Golden Liquor. With the White Mist Flying Canopy, descend to my person. Ascend with me, that together we may reach the Supreme Perfected."*

Next, visualize the Northern Lad of the Black Emperor, named *Mystic Brilliance Supreme*, styled *Great Yin Script*. His body is the color of dark mists, his flowing light blazing and illuminating the northern quarter like the brilliance of lightning. He rides a carriage of white mists, his entire being suffused with the streaming glow of Mystic Light. Feel your body transform and enter the black light, where inner and outer merge into obscurity, and nothing is heard or seen. After a long while, clarity returns. Knock the teeth twelve times and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Recite the invocation:
*"Northern Lad, Mystic Brilliance Supreme Lord, bestow upon me the Black Mushroom and Mystic Water, the Jade Essence and Dark Mist Flying Carriage. With the Five-Colored Numinous Dragons and the Obscuring Radiant Light, descend to my person. Ascend with the clouds, that I may reach the Flourishing Palace."*

Next, visualize the Central Lad of Yellow Light, named *Upholding Center*, styled *Yellow Record Lad*. His body is the color of yellow mists, like the essence of yellow gold, his flowing light blazing and illuminating the center, with five colors streaming and flashing like the brilliance of lightning. He rides a carriage of yellow mists, coming to rest in your chamber and coiling around your body. Feel your body transform and enter the yellow light, where inner and outer merge into obscurity, and nothing is heard or seen. After a long while, clarity returns. Knock the teeth twelve times and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Recite the invocation:
*"Central Lad, Upholding Loyalty Numinous Perfected, bestow upon me the Yellow Water and Moon Essence, the Returning Essence and Flying Dawn. With the Five Colors blazing and falling, and the Radiant Light gleaming within, overshadow me with the smoke of Yellow Splendor. Soaring through the void, ascend before the Emperor."*

When the preceding is complete, visualize the five colors blending into yellow, layering and intensifying upon one another. Cloud-qi surges and billows, filling the entire chamber and coiling around your body. Feel your form suffused with warmth, heat radiating within and without, penetrating deeply for a long while. Then behold: a Green Dragon upon your left shoulder, a White Tiger upon your right, a Vermilion Phoenix above your head, and a Soaring Serpent beneath your feet. They crown your body and recite the incantation:

*"The five colors thicken and surge—white, black, red, and blue-green. From the Central Mystery they descend, merging in dark abundance. Transformed into celestial beasts, they come to guard my form. Bestow upon me the Five Mushrooms, filling my five viscera to abundance. The Crimson Palace knits its networks, and divine radiance arises of itself. My lifespan equals sun and moon, ever preserving Yellow Tranquility. Through a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, I shall ascend to the Supreme Numinous."*

**Method for Swallowing Saliva, Restoring Countenance, and Securing Teeth to Seek Immortality**

At the break of dawn, when the two qi have not yet divided and the dark radiance has just illuminated the world, when form and spirit descend together to gather at the Muddy Pellet Palace, essence and fluids are all generated. This is the time to swallow and ingest them. After three years of such practice, your face will glow with jade-like luster, your complexion will revert to youth, your cloud-like vitality will take root, and decayed teeth will regrow.

If you persist in this cultivation, the Five Elders will descend to your chamber. You will ascend as a divine immortal, your lifespan equaling the Three Luminaries. This is the Way of Undying—transmit it only to the true.

At the appointed time, calm your mind and settle your intent, allowing the Five Spirits to attain stillness. Knock the teeth twelve times, then visualize the Azure-Robed Jade Maiden bearing the Lesser Yang qi of the East, along with Azure Mushroom and Jade Nectar, irrigating your body. Let them flow and overflow within the Purple Tenuity Palace, and recite:

*"Eastern Bluegreen Fang, drink the morning radiance. Jade nectar and sweet springs pour forth in torrents, streaming to moisten the Six Palaces. Dark influx flows like a river. My body grows strong, my form light, ascending to grasp the Supreme Rosy Clouds."*

When finished, lick the outer side of your upper teeth nine times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Vermilion-Robed Jade Maiden of the South bearing the Great Yang qi, along with Crimson Mushroom and Jade Nectar, irrigating your body. Let them flow and overflow within the Crimson Palace, and recite:

*"Southern Red Fang, drink the sweet springs. Dark mushroom and jade nectar flow and overflow like rivers, further moistening the Crimson Palace. My bones transform and give birth to spirits. I feast upon the Great Void, my entire body becoming immortal. Riding clouds and driving the dawn, I ascend before the Emperor."*

When finished, lick the outer side of your lower teeth eight times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Pristine Jade Maiden of the West bearing the Lesser Yin qi, along with White Mushroom and Jade Nectar, irrigating your body. Let them flow and overflow within the Canopy Palace, and recite:

*"Western White Fang, drink the numinous fluid. Jade waters surge in mighty currents, dark mushrooms gleaming brightly. They irrigate my Six Palaces, anchoring my hun and solidifying my po. My spirit is at peace, my stomach and ducts secure. My name is inscribed in the Golden Register."*

When finished, lick the inner side of your upper teeth six times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Jade Maiden of the North bearing the Great Yin qi, along with Dark Mushroom and Jade Water, irrigating your body. Let them flow and overflow within the Great Granary Palace, and recite:

*"Northern Black Fang, consume the dark nourishment. Drink my flying springs, feed me jade broth. My divine palace fills to overflowing, like cinnabar, like mushrooms. My lifespan overturns heaven and earth, shared by millions for countless ages."*

When finished, lick the inner side of your lower teeth five times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Yellow-Robed Jade Maiden of the Center bearing the Harmonious qi, along with Yellow Water and Moon Essence Elixir, irrigating your body. Let them flow and overflow within the Jade Hall, and recite:

*"Central Yellow Fang, white stones towering high. Feast upon the jade broth’s elixir, slake your thirst with Yellow Water and Moon Essence. My five viscera fill to abundance, streaming and moistening like rivers. My lifespan equals the Three Luminaries, never to decline or perish. My form ascends the Nine Mysteries, riding dragons and soaring through rosy clouds."*

When finished, lick all four sides of your upper and lower teeth, then press your tongue against the Mysterious Flower and draw the mushroom fluid twelve times before swallowing.

**The Way of Swallowing Saliva to Preserve the Teeth**

The Central Yellow Venerable Lord and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate constantly practiced this method. Their complexions became like those of youths, their skin like jade, their bodies brimming with qi. Their white hair turned black again, their teeth took root and never decayed or fell out. Thus they attained the descent of the Mysterious, their names inscribed in the Jade Registers. They ascended to the Clear Void, sharing the Emperor’s seat.

If you cultivate this, you shall seek your name in the Jade Pavilion of the Golden Gates. Without immortal records, you may not unseal and reveal it.

**Method for Riding Rosy Clouds, Descending Mist, and Ascending the Void**

Transmitted by the Azure Lad

The Lord of the Empyrean was born within luminous rosy clouds, enveloped by the five clouds, his countenance suffused with empyrean qi. His form follows the imperial registers, and he received the title Jade Tenuity. Concentrating the true and solidifying the fluids, he contemplates the dark rosy clouds to set himself in motion, yearning to roam the empyrean and ascend the void. He rides the dark dawn through the Ten Heavens, galloping like lightning to rein in the dragons. Thus, through focused contemplation, he achieves perfection and ascends the void to enter non-being.

The essentials of this method are pure and unadulterated by other techniques. I now transmit it to you—you may practice it accordingly.

The Eastern Rosy Cloud is named *Flying Void*.
The Western Rosy Cloud is named *Pristine Hut*.
The Southern Rosy Cloud is named *Cinnabar Radiance*.
The Northern Rosy Cloud is named *Dark Image*.
The Central Rosy Cloud is named *Encompassing Life*.

If you know the five rosy clouds, they will descend and summon the flying chariots. Contemplate them morning and evening, and the dark empyrean will come to invite you. Riding the void, you will ascend and reach the Supreme Clarity.

To practice this method, at the first light of dawn, go to the central courtyard. Knock your teeth sixteen times, then face east and call the names of the five directional rosy clouds three times each. When finished, look up and recite:

*"Five Directions’ Dark Rosy Clouds, streaming and illuminating the Dark Void. Three and seven ride nine, returning to encircle my hut. Grant me the flying dawn, to rein in the purple chariot. Ascending to the Supreme Ultimate, I request the true scriptures."*

When finished, bow in reverence and swallow qi thirty-six times.

At dusk, face west and perform the same method.

Those who cultivate the Supreme Way yet do not know the inner names of the cloud chariots will find that the cloud carriages do not descend for them, and their contemplation will not evoke a response. If you obtain this method and practice it for eighteen years, the qi of self-generating clouds will form within your chamber, and the cloud chariots will descend to carry your body upward to the Jade Clarity.

This Dao treasure is profoundly secret. The text speaks of the hidden names of the radiant clouds, which worldly people must never learn or practice—thus it must be kept concealed. To carelessly reveal it brings sin upon oneself, calamity upon seven generations. How could one not be cautious?

**Method for Moving Through the Celestial Pass and Unfolding the Divine Wondrous Observation of Secret Writ**

The Perfected Sovereign said: If you wish to ascend and soar to the Golden Gates, you must cultivate the Wondrous Observation, move through the Celestial Pass, pay homage to your parents, and inwardly invoke the true spirits. Then you may wander and play among the Nine Heavens, ascending to the Emperor’s chamber.

At midnight, step barefoot into the central courtyard. Gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper shining brightly. Envision your body standing at the Dipper’s center, revolving with it as it moves through the Celestial Pass. When it reaches the position above the southwest, bow twice, stand upright, and knock your head upon the ground nine times. Then, lifting your head slightly, softly call out three times:

*"Heavenly Father, Earthly Mother, I now return my body, restoring it to its natural honor in your care. Will you not move and deliver me? Once my body is delivered, I shall forever depart the paths of mortal thought. Contemplating the two honored ones, I reverently receive your blessed destiny."*

When finished, swallow qi twice, then swallow saliva nine times.

These two honored ones are the most sacred names of Heaven and Earth, the hidden appellations of the Mysterious True. They must never be recklessly disclosed to others. Should one reveal them three times, the officials of the Nine Heavens will diminish one’s lifespan and cut short one’s years, casting one’s life into the Nine Springs—forever barring ascent to immortality.

For those who cultivate the Way of the Supreme True: if the Seven Stars shift their position and you open the Three Celestial Passes, yet do not know these names, the Jade Perfected of the Nine Heavens will block the resonance of your contemplation. Those who are not children of the Mysterious Gate cannot unfold this method, and the true spirits will not descend for them.

This is the wondrous method of Heaven and Earth. The recipient must present a golden figurine and a jade figurine, each one in form, to the master, and receive the oral transmission of the decisive instructions. Then, ascending the altar, they must swear an oath of initiation, never violating the precepts. Should one transgress, their body will be seized by the ghostly officials, and calamity will extend to the seven ancestral lines. The recipient must be cautious—most cautious indeed.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Supreme Wondrous, Purple Passage, Blazing Radiance, and Divine Transformation of the Cavernous True*.
