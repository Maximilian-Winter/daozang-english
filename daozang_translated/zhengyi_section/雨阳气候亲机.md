**The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)**

**The Sun (太阳)**
Before the sun rises, first observe the morning *qi* (氣) at the eastern point where the sun emerges—this confirms its presence. If black clouds resemble a chicken egg or a flag-shaped mountain, with *zhènwū* (阵乌) hanging like a banner, and patterns of dragons, snakes, fish, or *lingzhī* (灵芝) and *mǔdān* (牡丹), then thunderstorms will occur on that day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.

If violet-black clouds pierce or surround the sun, or appear above and below it, thunderstorms will strike on that day. If black clouds resemble fish scales, there will be wind, but thunderstorms will only occur three days later. The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候) is thus verified.

**The Moon (太阴)**
When the moon’s color is red, it portends great thunderstorms the next day. If it is greenish-red, the next day will have a bright, round luminous formation, like a chariot wheel. If the moon’s color is white and serene, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.

When the moon is accompanied by white clouds forming a round luminous shape, not very distinct, and the day is windy, the thunderstorms will occur three days later. All other cloud formations are the same.

**The *Tianqiang* (天罡) Stars**
If the *Tianqiang* (天罡) stars appear in two red hues and shake, thunderstorms will strike. If they appear in green and shake, there will be great calamity the next day. If white clouds rise above the stars, there will be great thunderstorms the next day.

If yellow clouds rise above the stars and *qi* (氣) penetrates the *Wénqǔ* (文曲) stars, there will be thunderstorms. If the clouds envelop the stars or white clouds emerge from the *dòu* (斗) constellation, thunderstorms will strike the next day, especially around the *wèishí* (未时) hour.

If the *qi* (氣) is calm and white, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.

**The Big Dipper (北斗)**
If white clouds obscure the Big Dipper, there will be great turmoil the next day, especially between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If clouds appear above and below the Dipper, resembling fish scales, there will also be great turmoil the next day.

If white clouds envelop two or three stars of the Big Dipper, thunderstorms will strike the next day. If clouds within the Dipper resemble rippling water and are white, there will be strong winds the next day. If clouds appear like scattered fluff within the Dipper, there will only be wind.

If black clouds gather below the Dipper and surge upward, wind and rain will arise that very night. If violet-black *qi* (氣) appears below the Dipper or at its mouth, thunderstorms will strike three days later. If the *qi* (氣) is green, it corresponds to the *Wood* (木) day; if red, it corresponds to the *Fire* (火) day. For all other days, the cloud patterns are the same.

If yellow clouds pass through the Dipper, heavy rain will occur within three days. If white *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, rain will also occur within three days. If black *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, wind and rain will strike immediately. If lightning appears below the Dipper and extends across it or its mouth, rain will fall that very night.

**The *Longqi* (龙炁) Qi**
At dawn, observe the eastern horizon for five-colored *qi* (氣) like threads extending westward—this day will have wind and rain, stirring clouds and mist. If the *qi* (氣) remains suspended in the midheaven without moving, thunderstorms will occur three days later.

In the evening, as the sun sets, if five-colored *qi* (氣) appears and extends eastward, thunderstorms will strike three days later.

**The White Tiger (白虎)**
At dawn, if white *qi* (氣) appears in the east, not far from the sun, it emerges from the *yín* (寅) hour and follows the sun until the *shēn-yǐshí* (申巳) hours. Then, between the *yǒushí* (酉) and *xūshí* (戌) hours, thunderstorms will strike.

**The *Héqi* (河炁) Qi**
If large black clouds form in blocks, there will be wind. If their shape resembles a pig, or if black clouds appear like rotting fluff, dried wood, or mist, or if they obscure the moon or appear above it, thunderstorms will strike the next day.

If white clouds appear like cotton fluff, there will be light rain. If clouds resemble fish scales and move from south to north, there will be southern winds the next day. If they move toward other directions, the same applies after sunset—verify accordingly.

**The Thunder Seal (雷牌)**
At dawn, observe the southern horizon for the highest black clouds—this is called the *Thunder Seal* (雷信). If they rise until the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours and then disperse in the midheaven, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours in the eastern direction.

If the clouds are high in the south, thunderstorms will strike in the east. For all other directions, the pattern is the same.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges from the *Shénxiāo* (神霄) and issues commands, it will appear around the *yǒushí* (酉) hour, bringing violent winds, thunder, and torrential rain, along with flying sand that uproots trees.

If the *Qīn* (钦火) *Fire* descends to the *Water Palace* (水府) and unfurls flags to issue commands, appearing between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, it will strike that night around the *zǐshí* (子时) hour, causing thunderstorms and flooding the next day, with waves surging on land.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges at sunrise, with black clouds resembling a chicken’s head or flag-shaped mountains, and patterns of *zhènwū* (阵乌), dragons, snakes, fish, *lingzhī* (灵芝), and *mǔdān* (牡丹), thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.

If the clouds resemble fish scales, there will only be wind. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* rides the *Chōng* (冲) star and emerges between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, thunderstorms will strike around the *wèishí* (未时) hour. If it appears around the *wèishí* (未时) hour, thunderstorms will strike between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands with thunderous intent, the next day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering humans and livestock, destroying temples, plunging the sky into darkness and the earth into chaos, and causing flying sand that uproots trees.

If it obscures the sun without dispersing, thunderstorms will strike that very day. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands, it will appear between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, striking around the *wǔshí* (午时) hour, or emerge between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, bringing sudden violent winds and thunderstorms.

If it emerges from the *Gàn* (乾) direction, there will be slaughter and destruction. If it enters the *Xùn* (巽), *Gèn* (艮), or *Kūn* (坤) directions, there will be no calamity. If it enters the *Kǎn* (坎) direction, thunder, lightning, and rain will be dire. If it enters the *Lí* (离) or *Duì* (兑) directions, the outcome will be favorable.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* issues commands, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, causing waves to surge on land.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *White Tiger* (白虎) and issues commands, the next day—especially around the *shēnshí* (申时) hour—will bring thunderstorms.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and issues a great calamity, known as the *Red Rooster and Purple Goose* (赤鸡紫鹅), thunder and lightning will strike before the *wèishí* (未时) hour, toppling trees and slaughtering people, with torrential rain pouring down.

If the *Thunder* (雷) *Deva* transforms water, thunder and lightning will strike suddenly, bringing torrential rain. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* summons the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and all its calamities to obey, between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, violent winds will carry flying sand and stones, thunder and lightning will strike, torrential rain will fall, temples will be destroyed, trees uprooted, and the sky darkened while the earth grows black.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* dispatches the *Golden Tiger* (金虎) to issue commands, and the sun has a halo (*yùn* 晕) with clouds shaped like dragons or snakes, thunderstorms will strike within three days, especially in the southeast, where temples will be destroyed and evil people slaughtered.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* and the *Great Unity* (太乙) meet and issue commands, appearing that day, the next day will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering people and destroying temples, uprooting trees.

If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* lingers in its abode, appearing in segments or like a fabric curtain thousands to tens of thousands of *zhang* (丈) away, there will be severe drought and violent winds. If the sun is obscured afterward, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If it obscures the sun and clouds extend toward the *Xùn* (巽) direction, there will be attacks on people and destruction of *jīng* (精).

If dark clouds appear and advance, also known as the *Red Rat* (赤鼠) *surrounding the City* (游城), within five to six days, there will be turmoil in the south. If the *Milky Way* (天河) remains cloudless that night during prolonged drought, it is an extreme omen—no prayers can avert it; this is the *Heaven’s decree* (天数).

The **Golden Fire** (金火) *Great Killing* (大杀) *Battle* (会战) occurs at *wèishí* (未时), when thunderstorms rage, great tremors strike, demons are slain, trees are broken by violent winds, and heavy snow falls in winter—though the sky is clear, thunder resounds.

When the **North Dipper** (北斗) *Celestial Minister of Waters* (都水使者) ventures forth, fierce winds and rains sweep across, flooding and flowing everywhere. If the **North Dipper** (北斗) is near, or the **Milky Way** (天河) is close, the effects will manifest within two *gēng* (更) periods before or after.

The **Nine Dippers** (九斗) *Yang Radiance* (阳芒) and the *Fire Bell General* (火铃将军) casting fire, aligning with the *Red Rat* (赤鼠), within five to six days of the *rénzǐ* (壬子) to *dīngwù* (丁巳) cycle in the fifth to seventh months, if such *qi* (炁) clouds appear, drought will follow—prayers will be futile, and locusts will swarm.

The *Heavenly Vitality* (乾精) *Great Calamity* (大煞) of the *Black Dragon* (黑龙), like clouds, with fish moving in pairs across the *Xùn* (巽) direction, will bring violent winds and rains within three days, thunderclaps and lightning strikes, slaying demons and beasts, and punishing wicked men.

When winter snow falls, the *Thunder God* (雷神) roams the *shēn-yǒu-xū-hài-zǐ-chǒu* (申酉戌亥子丑) directions, summoning the *Shuāng Wind* (朔风) and great snow. If omens appear in all four directions, thunder and lightning will follow.

When *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) ventures forth, the *Golden Tiger* (金虎) brings a *Great Calamity* (大煞), clearing the skies in all directions. Yet suddenly, black clouds arise like dragons and snakes, or obscuring the moon. On the following day, during *wèishí* (未时) to *shēnshí* (申时), thunderstorms will strike.

If the moon is obscured in three places, temples will be destroyed and men slain. If the moon is obscured during *zǐ-chǒu* (子丑), frost and snow will follow.

In summer and autumn, winds and clouds, thunderstorms, lightning, and plagues of insects or locusts will bring calamity to mankind.

In spring, the third month, if clouds resemble snakes or lightning strikes frequently, heavy winds and rains will occur in the sixth and seventh months.

When *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) aligns with the *Celestial Minister* (使者), thunderclaps and lightning will strike between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时), slaying evil and uprooting trees.

If *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) meets the *Thunder Master* (雷师) while roaming, violent winds and rains will follow, with thunderclaps slaying demons.

When the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *North Dipper Waters* (北斗都水) or the *Water Crystal* (水晶), thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *xū-hài* (戌亥).

If the *Celestial Minister* (使者) commands the *Heavenly Gang* (天罡) to drive away evil, thunderstorms will rage within one or two days.

When the *White Qi* (白炁) *Wind Lord* (风伯) confronts the Dipper, the next day will bring violent winds sweeping the earth, flying sand and rolling stones, and thunderstorms.

If the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *Thunder Master* (雷师) while roaming, the next day will see violent winds and rains, thunderclaps, and the slaying of demons.

If the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *Water Crystal* (水晶), thunderstorms will strike the next day.

When the *North Dipper Waters* (都水使者) ventures forth, thunderstorms will rage the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时).

If the *Purple Forbidden Enclosure* (紫微) inspects mankind, within three days, heavy rains will fall.

When the *Heavenly Gang* (天罡) meets *Great Unity* (太乙), within seven days, torrential rains will turn the land into rivers, thunderclaps will strike, temples will be destroyed, and men and beasts slain.

If *Great Unity* (太乙) enters the Dipper’s abode, black *qi* (炁) clouds gather, enveloping the Dipper. Rain will fall that very night. If the Dipper clears, thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时), with violent winds and lightning.

If clouds surge like mist into the Dipper’s mouth, the same will occur.

When greenish radiance appears in the *jiǔ-jiǔ* (九九) cycle, drought will follow—prayers will be futile, and locusts will swarm, their light lingering.

If the *Celestial Minister* (使者) appears as a black pig, crossing the river in formation, thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时).

If the sound of the *Milky Way* (天河) resembles wind, named the *Celestial Minister Rolling Waters* (使者卷水), torrential rains will follow, flooding even flat ground.

When the *Qi Fire* (欻火) unfurls its wings, thunderstorms will strike that very day between *shēnshí* (申时) and *yǒushí* (酉时).

All *qi* (炁) of the thunderous Dipper—when the *Perverse Gate Thunder* (鬼门上震) arises, its sound is hidden. If thunderclaps strike with a single resounding voice into the earth, this is the *Heavenly Thunder’s Tremor* (天雷发撼).

When the *Qi Fire* (欻火) descends its clouds, they resemble phoenix wings or scales, appearing above green clouds until midheaven, then turning black. Or, clouds may appear at *shēnshí* (申时) as the sun sets.

If divine thunder descends, it roars from the east.

When the *Xùn Thunder* (巽雷) descends, its clouds come from the east, or from the *Xùn* (巽) or south, level like a single stroke. Sometimes radiant, sometimes dark, they reach midheaven, bringing violent winds and rains.

If a dark cloud stretches like a single stroke in midheaven, and white clouds appear in the *Xùn* (巽) direction, no rain will fall.

If the *Water Thunder* (水雷) descends, its clouds rise upward, emerging from black or green clouds in wave-like patterns—then violent winds and rains will strike immediately.

When the *Grand Age Thunder* (太岁雷) descends, its clouds are uniformly dark, with a faint edge of white, their radiance sharp like a brushstroke. Sudden thunder and swift winds will follow.

If the *Community Thunder* (社令雷) descends, its clouds are dimly black, like faded ink, with a white mist emerging from its center, resembling a painting. If this appears during clear or rainy weather, or if the rain’s shadow manifests, violent winds and rains will follow for seven days, then the situation will stabilize.

**The Solar and Lunar Deities and the Twenty-Four Qi:**

*The Great Sun’s Qi rises like a dragon-horse,*
*and within that day, wind and rain ensue.*
*The Great Moon’s Qi appears as a goose’s shadow—*
*three days later, rain arrives at* **Shēnshì** (申) *and* **Yǒu** (酉) *hours.*

*Black clouds and mist vary in lightness and heaviness;*
*when heavy, thunderous wind and rain resound.*
*Dark and dense as mountains, wild as beasts,*
*first comes the thunder, then the rain—no need for doubt.*

*When mist and dew descend from the mountains, rain is imminent,*
*heavy, then three days of thunderous rain.*
*Light, then seven days of torrential downpour,*
*when mist and qi obscure the sky, seven days of rain.*

*As the sun sets, the* **Yǔqí** (雨旗) *appears at its feet,*
*else the* **Shuǐqì** (水炁) *passes the Celestial Ford.*
*If* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*then wind and rain strike, and thunder fills the heavens.*
*Clouds gather like crows in flight toward the Great Ridge,*
*even the True Immortal cannot escape the rain.*

*Yet another laughable sight:*
*they who know not the Mysterious and wondrous*
*yet still scribble talismans.*

*The Great Moon’s constellation, the Marshal Deity,*
*governs benevolent strikes and malevolent cuts,*
*deciding fortune and calamity.*
*Also called the Golden Tiger Executioner,*
*it most surely answers prayers for clear skies or rain.*

*When clouds are absent and the sun shines bright,*
*suddenly, a dragon-shaped cloud descends.*
*If* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*then rain falls, light or heavy, without thunder.*

*Before the black clouds fully gather, the moon’s rainbow halo appears,*
*called the Flowing Gold, the Great Executioner Deity.*
*It smashes temples, topples altars, and slays demons—*
*that very night, wind and rain pour down.*

*In autumn, the fixed master* **Shēnshì** (申) *responds,*
*while in summer and winter, the master* **Shēnshì** (申) *brings drenching storms.*

*When the moon’s tail encircles its host like a dragon,*
*sudden sickness and disaster follow the torrential rain.*
*Howling winds uproot trees, hurl sand and stone,*
*while swift thunder strikes evil and punishes humankind.*

*When the moon surrounds the stars, the Celestial Master decrees drought,*
*especially in spring and winter at* **Xū** (戌) *and* **Hài** (亥) *hours,*
*and again at* **Zǐ** (子) *and* **Chǒu** (丑).*
*If it rises, frost and snow descend,*
*rain, thunder, lightning, and hail follow,*
*as do plagues of insects and locusts—*
*people suffer in all four directions.*

*When the moon coils around* **Bì** (毕) *constellation, wind and rain are frequent,*
*and when the moon is dark, it is the Celestial One’s* **Jīng** (精) *Qi.*
*In spring, the third and fourth months often see dragon-horse clouds,*
*while the fixed masters* **Liù** (六) *and* **Qī** (七) *bring frequent wind and rain.*

*When the sun and moon grow dim, wind and rain follow,*
*and when the moon encircles* **Jī** (箕) *and* **Bì** (毕),*
*the winds grow wild.*

*If* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*then wind and rain strike, thunder shakes the earth,*
*and altars are toppled, stones shattered,*
*demons and beasts are punished.*

*When the moon’s* **Wùqì** (雾炁) *rises like a dragon,*
*if seen at* **Zǐ** (子) *and* **Chǒu** (丑) *hours,*
*then on* **Chǒu** (丑) *day, rain descends.*
*Else, at* **Yín** (寅) *and* **Mǎo** (卯) *hours,*
*it becomes a vast lake or sea,*
*and at* **Shēnshì** (申) *and* **Hài** (亥) *hours,*
*the master punishes demonic* **Jīng** (精) *Qi.*

*The Fire Thunder Deity, the* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *Lord,*
*holds the pivotal mechanisms of fate,*
*deciding fortune and calamity.*
*He governs the people, overseeing the* **Zhǒngshè** (统摄) *of all,*
*called the Great* **Yīnyáng** (阴阳) *Executioner Deity.*

*The Great* **Yīnyáng** (阴阳) *Executioner is beyond description,*
*striking benevolence and slaying malevolence without pause.*
*Suddenly, clouds arise within the* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *constellation,*
*and at* **Xū** (戌) *and* **Hài** (亥) *hours,*
*or when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*wind and rain strike.*

*Ancient trees and evil shrines are struck by thunder,*
*sheep, people, oxen, and horses receive celestial punishment.*
*When black clouds and* **Qì** (炁) *pass through* **Liánzhēn** (廉贞) *stars,*
*within three days, lightning strikes mortals.*
*When white clouds and* **Qì** (炁) *pass through* **Tān** (贪) *and* **Jùyào** (巨曜) *stars,*
*great winds arise, but the sky remains clear.*

*When black clouds and* **Qì** (炁) *pass through* **Lùcún** (禄存) *stars,*
*on the next day, when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*wind and rain strike in terror.*
*The thunder’s roar shakes heaven and earth,*
*toppling temples, slaying demons,*
*and banishing malevolent spirits.*
*The Celestial威 and Executioner* **Shén** (神) *punish mortals,*
*while clouds gather like black turtles,*
*bursting through the ranks of demons.*

*If the* **Pòjūn** (破军) *Deity appears,*
*then when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*seven days of rain descend,*
*and cannot clear.*

*Within seven days, it becomes a vast lake or sea,*
*while thunder punishes people and beasts,*
*and stones and mountain* **Jīng** (精) *Qi.*

*When the* **Chìqì** (赤炁) *rises at dawn within the* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *constellation,*
*light, then wind and rain strike when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master;*
*heavy, then thunder commands its decree,*
*chasing away* **Jīng** (精) *Qi and punishing malevolent spirits,*
*fulfilling the Celestial’s sentence.*

*When white* **Qì** (炁) *rises like flying clouds toward the* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *constellation,*
*one may witness thunder and rain,*
*and know the master’s punishment is near.*
*All twenty-four* **Qì** (炁) *are thus,*
*and all seventy-two* **Hòu** (候) *must be carefully examined.*

*When clouds are black and mixed, wind and rain arise,*
*and when black clouds pass through the* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *constellation,*
*they bring rain.*
*When white clouds come like mist and scatter,*
*then wind and rain strike when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*and thunder returns.*

*When the moon is clear and the winds pure, without obstruction,*
*and no clouds gather at the four banks,*
*while the* **Shèdǒu** (射斗) *stars shine,*
*then* **Yīnyáng** (阴阳) *Qi does not move,*
*and the* **Shà** (杀) *Executioner does not appear—*
*even talismans would be powerless.*

*Carefully examine the* **Nánchēn** (南辰) *and* **Běidǒu** (北斗) *constellations,*
*measuring their height and width,*
*their fields and divisions.*
*Deeply discern the places of auspicious and inauspicious stars and* **Shà** (煞) *forces,*
*and you shall know the exact location of each—*
*no error in judgment.*

*If the Five Stars show a clear, bright light,*
*then a bald broom sweeps ten households.*
*When* **Bì** (毕) *and* **Shì** (势) *are blazing, no exorcism can avert,*
*and people suffer plagues, insects, and locusts.*

*Three days before and four days after the Winter Solstice,*
*if thunder roars and snow descends,*
*this is not auspicious—*
*a general rule for all four directions.*

*If the Fire Star appears in the southern sky for one night,*
*all living things wither and decay.*
*Where the star is red, there is drought,*
*and when its halo shines,*
*fortune and calamity are decided.*

*When the Fire Star is in* **Jī** (箕) *and* **Bì** (毕) *constellations, wind and rain are frequent,*
*while the rest govern drought.*

*The Six* **Jiǎ** (甲) *Qi bring frequent wind and rain,*
*and one who understands this*
*shall know the omens from their own heart.*

*At dawn and dusk during the Mid-Autumn Festival,*
*carefully observe the skies—*
*if no stars appear, drought is imminent.*
*When the* **Shí** (石) *is damp and water flows,*
*and the Fire* **Qì** (炁) *ascends, near rain descends.*
*When the* **Shuǐ** (水) *Qi rises and fish leap from the depths,*
*ants seal their nests, and rain follows.*
*When the* **Wúgōng** (蜈蚣) *appears upon the path by day,*
*then wind and rain strike that very morning,*
*when* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master.*

*When a rainbow appears in the west,*
*rain falls that very day.*
*If* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*
*then trees and demonic* **Jīng** (精) *Qi are punished.*
*Else, if seen in the east,*
*observe its height and low—*
*if clouds gather but no rain falls,*
*then drought and* **Bà** (魃) *demons are near.*

*When the Earth* **Qì** (炁) *rises to the heavens,*
*three days of rain descend.*
*When the Heavenly* **Qì** (炁) *descends to the Earth,*
*four seasons of drenching follow.*
*If the Earth* **Qì** (炁) *does not reach the heavens,*
*then the heavens do not rain,*
*and if the Heavenly* **Qì** (炁) *does not descend to the Earth,*
*then drought will come.*

*If seen in summer, then autumn has no rain,*
*and if seen in spring at* **Liù** (六) *and* **Qī** (七) *months,*
*then drenching storms descend.*

*In summer, the northern sky brings rain,*
*while in autumn, the southern sky drenches afterward.*
*In winter, the southern wind brings snow,*
*and after prolonged rain, the western wind brings clear skies.*

*These are the* **Zhāng** (章) *of the* **Yùnshū** (玉书) *of* **Yuánshǐ** (元始) *—*
*not the common secrets of the mortal world.*
*Those who know them*
*are the roots of the Dao,*
*with long-standing karmic connections.*
*Passed on with benevolence and righteousness,*
*with virtue and immortality,*
*sworn upon by thunderous decrees—*
*never to be lightly transmitted.*

*To wield thunder on the palm,*
*and summon wind and rain before your eyes,*
*is to proclaim the Celestial Transformations.*
*To benefit creatures and aid humanity,*
*is to hold them as eternal treasures—*
*guard them with utmost reverence.*

*Rain and* **Yáng** (旸) *Qi, the seasonal rhythms,*
*are the Dao’s most intimate mechanisms.*
