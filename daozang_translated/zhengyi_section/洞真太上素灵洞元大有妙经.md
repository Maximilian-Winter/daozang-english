### **The Harmonious Fusion of the Three Caverns – The Precious Names of the Offices and Titles of the Inner Perfected, Transformed and Born**

*The Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Simplicity and Numinous Mystery of the Great Existence* expounds the Dao of the Three Perfected and the Nine Caverns, transformed from the Upper Cinnabar and the Plain Words of the Three Nines. Coeval with primordial qi, born together with the Primordial Beginning, the Three Essences congealed and crystallized, inscribing luminous jade tablets. It unfolds the palaces of the Three Caverns, governing the abyss of the myriad Perfected. Secretly enshrined in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens, within the Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber of the Simplicity and Numinous Abode, its text was carved upon jade slips, its characters engraved in gold and jade to illumine its chapters.

The harmonious fusion of the Three Caverns gives birth to the Upper Prime, centrally governing the Ten Absolute Void-Born Heavens, and below, ordering the myriad qi—no mystery remains untouched. Its flowing radiance and primordial mist rise in jadelike purity; flying rosy clouds and purple mists illumine the Great Void. The Jade-Flower Maidens and Golden Dawn Youths, each three thousand in number, attend and guard the numinous scripture.

At that time, when the celestial primes aligned and the divine court rejoiced, the Primordial Jade Emperor, the Most High and Venerable, was enthroned, while the host of Perfected and immortals assembled before his seat. They burned incense, paid homage to the scripture, and circumambulated the Upper Palace.

In the profound obscurity of the Mystic Dawn, fragrant smoke veiled the light; wafting perfumes purified the spirits, dispersing mist upon the Jade Capital. The Three Simplicities and Primordial Clouds trailed like lightning across rosy peaks; radiant splendor intertwined, and divine candles merged their brilliance. Ten billion maidens and immortals attended, while venomous dragons and colossal beasts guarded the numinous precincts. Pythons clashed swords, long-fanged beasts struck bells; celestial majesty blazed, transforming the Great Nonbeing. The Eight Winds stirred the Mystic Banners, jade tones resounded from the Numinous Palace. Phoenixes sang beside the Nine Rosy Clouds, simurghs chanted near the Purple Empyrean. Profound mists billowed above the Darkly Mysterious, and the first dawn’s light rustled in their midst.

Then the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen, the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity, and the Golden Portal Emperor Lord of the Nine Mysteries of the Latter Sage purified themselves for three months, gazing upward to receive the Great Obscurity. Their profound contemplation moved the Great Stillness; their accumulated thoughts opened the Upper Clarity. Thus, luminous radiance settled, the Nine Wefts entwined their forms; hidden mushrooms budded in splendor, and night-born treasure lights arose. They feasted on the essence of flowers, absorbed the morning essence, rode the void to weave mists, and the Eight Paths shone brightly. Chewing the Supreme Harmony, their wisdom flowed through the jade tablets; they wandered the subtle and obscure, drifting through the courts of the empyrean. Vast and boundless, the cavernous source stretched across infinite eons. They roamed the Great Transformation, their divine splendor inexhaustible.

Dwelling in the numinous observatory, they feasted in the Seven Dawns; purified in the Flowery Garden, they rested in the Nine Mysteries. Transforming their forms in the Jade Void, they led the hosts of heavens. The Two Sequences were vast and bright; primordial blessings flowed like boundless streams. Their gaze spanned kalpas, their aspirations transcended return. Bathing in the Numinous Mound, on the fragrant peaks of orchid purity, their luminous models were established, their inner harmonies complete. The Five Flowers illumined the treasury; their jade hearts gleamed with crystalline purity. In the secluded abode of profound radiance, purple light suffused their robes. They brandished their staffs at the Mystic River, plucked crimson blossoms from the Grove of Wisdom, and surveyed the vast expanse. Their eyes beheld the sounds of the Ten Heavens; their ethereal traces were formless and untraceable. Once the numinous transformation was concealed, they rode the movement of the Mystic Clarity. Branches flourished in pure harmony; empty wombs took form. The wondrous vision of Great Existence unfolded in the Simplicity and Numinous; the secret mysteries of the Nine Heavens congealed the essence of the Primordial Cavern. It ordered the Three Passes within the hidden palace, gathered the myriad Perfected in future lives, regulated the dark statutes to restrain transgressions, and redeemed one’s faults in the Great Obscurity. It delivered the seven ancestors from the Three Wretched Paths and liberated the destitute souls in the Southern Court. Chanting the wisdom hymns of the Three Emperors, it purged the defilements of the Three Clarities.

How great are the jade tablets! The utmost numinosity of divine power.

*The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Scripture of the Great Cavern* are the Dao’s banner of the Supreme Sovereign, the wondrous chapters of the Purple Dawn. They command the ranks of the Nine Heavens, summon the spirits of the Five Emperors, blend the revolving winds in harmonious fusion, and congeal the Nine Revolutions in the Mystic Essence. They unite the feminine and masculine, transforming and harmonizing the myriad spirits. Profound and dense, their jade tones resonate with the Supreme Perfected. They operate beyond the Bright Beam, communicate transformations through the Mystic Gate, wield the blade of cavernous power to create wonders, and bathe in radiant nets to illumine the clouds. The Great Desert becomes the qi of the Numinous Pass; the Blade-less marks the years of the Vast Kalpa. Towering is the divine abode, the abyss of the myriad Perfected. The Golden Chamber blazes in splendor, luxuriant in the Upper Clarity. Its purport is subtle and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.

If one can maintain long-term purification, sever worldly attachments upon entering the gate, recite the jade tablets in seclusion, and strike the jade tones to shake the numinous, then the Perfected will inscribe one’s name in the Eastern Florescence, the Seven Mysteries will be further moistened in the Purple Court. One will command demon kings with divine might and enlist the Five Emperors to guard the body.

This is the marvelous and divine power of the Great Cavern, which gathers the myriad Dao to return to life. Those without extraordinary bones or jade names—those of common constitution—must not rashly reveal the numinous scripture. Its prohibitions follow *The Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*; the recipient must be cautious.

*The Supreme Jade Register Scripture of the Feminine One and the Five Elders* contains twelve upper vows, eight mysteries of the Primordial Mother, nine revolutions and five returns, transformations of the feminine and masculine. The second rare text, the ultimate chapter of the Most High, harmonizes myriad transformations, ensuring the enduring governance of destiny. It solidifies the hun-soul and congeals essence, commanding and gathering the host of spirits. It unties knots, releases bonds, and returns the Five Penetrations to their origin. The myriad qi converge and ascend to guard the Muddy Pellet. It refines and infuses the utmost Perfected, its splendor illuminating the Purple Court. It soars and shines in the Nine Mysteries, flows brilliantly in the Jade Clarity. Numinous mists scatter fragrance upon the bright rosy clouds; divine lamps glow radiantly in the Great Void. The host of Perfected rejoice in the jade chambers; the multitude of immortals chant praises and pay homage to the scripture. Flying beasts leap in the Great Void; simurghs and phoenixes warble in sorrowful song. The Three Luminaries pause their radiance; celestial brilliance merges with the daylight. Vast and boundless is the secluded abode—the utmost Perfected of the Most High.

Its purport is subtle and rare, its profound subtleties abstruse and deep—so wondrous it cannot be recorded, so recondite its principles cannot be exhausted. Should one possess the Jade Tablet inscribed with the name of the Jade Sovereign, and should the Eastern Florescence present its memorial, listing it within the Jasper Palace, then one may obtain this scripture. Following the prescribed rites, cultivate with concentrated devotion to the Celestial Perfected; maintain strict fasting and ardent recitation, taking meals only at midday. Chant the precious chapters, expound and delve into the numinous scrolls. After nine years of unremitting practice, one may attain the Perfected. Refine the hun and po within the Nine Palaces, harmonize and unify the Three Passes. Deliver the seven generations of ancestors from the dark paths, ferry the suffering souls from the Southern Palace. Make vows before the altar of form to invoke response, pledge sincerity of heart to seek transcendence.

Through this wondrous transformation, resonance descends at dawn. Riding the void, one soars through the heavens, roaming and feasting without hindrance.

The Most High declares: For those who pursue the Dao, contemplate the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*. Circulate the wind to merge with the Feminine One and the Five Elders; invoke the Twelve Supreme Vows of the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber Emperor Lord; traverse the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother; and practice the method of the Great One’s transformation into the Feminine One, ascending as an immortal. On the day of practice, one must first purify through fasting, bathe with orchid fragrance, and enter the chamber to visualize the Primordial Numinous Five Emperors, the secret names and inner characters of the officials of the Primal Cavern Heaven, Cavern Earth, and Cavern Abyss. Only after completing these invocations may one proceed to cultivate the precious formula of the Feminine One of the Great Cavern.

Its method is arcane and subtle, coeval with qi, enduring as heaven itself. Thus, the Purple Chamber of the Great One serves as the Primordial Father of Fusion, the Mysterious Mother; the Three Wombs constitute the secret and wondrous words of the divine luminaries; the Nine Perfected Names form the *Inner Scripture of the Great Cavern*; the Most High is the Great Elixir of the Primal Beginning; the Feminine One is the inner essence; the *Wondrous Scripture of Great Possession*; the Primordial Numinous is the *Cavern Mystery*. Together, the Three Treasures compose the marvelous scripture; the Three Qi are bound into the exalted chapter. Its wonders are unfathomable, its heights unattainable, its depths inexhaustible—how majestic and subtle! This jade scroll possesses great virtue.

Should the disciple diligently contemplate it, they shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, attaining the Dao of immortality. The two poles of existence are perfected within this numinous scripture.

The Dawn-Luminous Heaven-Penetrating Treasure Talisman

The Most High Dao Lord’s Scripture on Guarding the Three Origins and True Unity

The Dao of the Three Caverns forms the title of Spontaneous Nature, assisting in the governance of the Three Treasures. The *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, the *Feminine Unity Five Elders*, and the *Great Plain Spirit Numinous* correspond to and uphold the Three Origins. The Primordial Cavern governs Heaven, the Cavern Perfected governs Earth, and the Cavern Mysterious governs Humankind. The three *qi* unite in brilliance, jointly governing within the Three Palaces of the adept’s body, each requiring the other to achieve completion.

If the adept desires not to die, they must seek their original birth, ingesting and wearing the flowing rosy clouds, with the Cavern as their foremost priority.

In cultivating the Three Treasures and the Upper Clarity Perfected Scriptures, one must first contemplate the inner true treasured names of the Three Caverns, visualizing and invoking the office titles to guard the body’s form. Only then may one proceed with cultivation to successfully become a Perfected.

This method is most wondrous, its secrets held within the Great Plain Spirit Palace.

If the adept possesses the proper bone destiny, they should diligently practice the Dao of the Perfected, constantly enduring hardship in contemplation, maintaining purity with orchid incense, and avoiding defiled *qi*. The spirits will manifest their forms. After eighteen years, green carriages will descend, allowing one to ride clouds and command dragons, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight.

Now I reveal this to the adept; keep it secret and put it into practice.

Regularly at dawn, contemplate the Cavern Heaven; at midday, contemplate the Cavern Earth; at midnight, contemplate the Cavern Abyss. Alternatively, one may contemplate the Three Perfected at midday.

The method of visualization: enter the chamber facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, then close the eyes and visualize the Plain Spirit Palace and Clear Subtlety Mansion, where green and red *qi* intermingle in lush abundance, descending into the adept’s body and entering the Muddy Pellet Upper Palace. Then swallow nine *qi*. Next, visualize the Orchid Terrace Mansion, where red and yellow *qi* intermingle as before, descending into the adept’s body and entering the Vermilion Palace, then swallow nine *qi*. Next, visualize the August Hall Mansion, where white and black *qi* intermingle as before, descending into the adept’s body and entering the Cinnabar Field Palace below the navel, then swallow nine *qi*.

After swallowing the *qi* of the Three Caverns, raise the head and recite the incantation:
*"Heaven and Earth in Primal Chaos,
Cavern Abyss Three Essences,
Primordial Beginning knits transformation,
Five qi intermingle and give birth.
Mysterious transformation of the Primordial,
irrigating and infusing the body’s form.
Ingesting and wearing the flowing rosy clouds,
ascending into the Purple Court.
Northern Thearch records death,
Eastern Florescence inscribes the name.
Penetrating the subtle and obscure,
uniting with the Thearch."*

After reciting, knock the teeth nine times and visualize the Primordial Cavern Primordial Brilliance Primordial Radiance Extending Spirit Radiant Primordial Lord Dark Chaos, bestowing upon the adept’s body the Vermilion Brightness Talisman of Yang Rosy Clouds.

Next, visualize the birth offices of the Cavern Heaven, their attire, personal names, and styles as described above, all descending from the Plain Spirit Palace and Clear Subtlety Mansion into the adept’s Muddy Pellet Palace in sequence.

After visualizing, raise the head and pray:
*"Upper Origin of Cavern Heaven,
overseeing and governing the Nine Mysteries,
uniting and governing the three qi,
giving birth within the Cinnabar Field.
Unfastening the obscure passes of the Cavern,
entering and exiting without obstruction.
The soul and spirit treasure their radiance,
wrapped in resplendent adornments.
Flying clouds in the Vermilion Chamber,
roaming and feasting in the Purple Heaven.
Together preserving Heaven and Earth,
enjoying longevity for countless years."*

After visualizing the Cavern Heaven, turn to the south, face south, and visualize the Cavern Earth Cavern Perfected Great Fire Star Great Cavern Primordial Birth Great Numinous Mechanism August Lord Scenic Transformation, bestowing upon the adept’s body the Luminous Four Caverns and Nine Origins Talisman.

Next, visualize the birth offices of the Cavern Earth, their attire, personal names, and styles as described above, all descending from the Plain Spirit Palace and Orchid Terrace Mansion into the adept’s Vermilion Palace.

Then raise the head and pray:
*"Middle Origin of Cavern Earth,
overseeing the flying immortals,
adorned with resplendent flowered crowns,
girded with azure silk sashes.
Bestowing upon me the numinous talisman,
communicating with the Perfected to summon the spirits.
Contemplating the subtle and obscure,
receiving the Thearch’s secret words.
Dissolving the womb and dispersing knots,
the nine apertures become luminous.
The seven ancestors are all liberated,
ascending to the Southern Pavilion.
Cloud carriages descend,
ascending to the dawn in broad daylight."*

Upon completing the Cavern Earth visualization, turn to face north and contemplate the Cavern Abyss’s Cavern Mystery Grand White Star, the Golden City’s Radiant Primordial Essence and Primordial Guide, the Grand Immortal Lord, whose personal name is Haotian, bestowing the Luminous Heaven-Piercing Treasure Talisman upon the adept’s body.

Next, visualize the birth offices of the Cavern Abyss, their attire, personal names, and styles as described above, all descending from the Plain Spirit Palace and Imperial Hall Mansion into the adept’s Cinnabar Field below the navel.

Then raise the head and pray:
*"Cavern Abyss’s hidden passes,
ascending to join the Three Origins,
mysterious qi surging forth,
flying auroras and purple clouds,
flowing yellow in five hues,
radiant dawn’s treasure talisman.
By its ingestion and adornment, the Primordial endures,
riding the void and mounting emptiness,
roaming and feasting in Jade Dawn,
accompanying the Luminous Thearch,
befriending the Perfected Immortals."*

Upon completing the Cavern Abyss visualization, return to face east, knock the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva nine times. The Three Caverns’ practice is now complete.

If the adept can perform this, true spirits will manifest, jade maidens may be commanded, jade lads will convey numinosity, the Three Origins will descend, and cinnabar carriages with green canopies will arrive to welcome the adept’s body, ascending to Grand Clarity.

This must be treasured in utmost secrecy—never transmit it lightly.

*The Scripture of Guarding the Primordial Cinnabar, Upper Scroll of the Supreme Dao Lord*

The Supreme Thearch, Heavenly Thearch, and Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch received this from the Supreme Dao Lord. Through its practice and attainment, they ascended to supplement the Thearch’s Perfected.

The Supreme Thearch transmitted the scripture to Queen Mother of the West; the Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Supreme Origin Lord of Southern Culmen; the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal transmitted it to the Azure Lad, the Prime Minister; the Azure Lad transmitted it to Master Juan.

This is the Upper Scroll of the Plain Spirit—this Dao surpasses all other scriptures. Its method is lofty and wondrous, beyond the ken of middling immortals.

Since the nameless text was inscribed on crimson bamboo slips and recorded in the Highest Clarity, the Way of Mysterious Cinnabar has never been encountered elsewhere.

If a Daoist cultivates the *Three Perfected Grades Scripture of the Supreme*, their rank shall be that of the Emperor’s highest ministers and chief counselors. If one’s reception is partial or their understanding of the Dao limited, their rank shall be as a king of the Lesser Spirit Palaces, a minister of the Divine Continent, or a grand master of the Grand Ultimate’s lower echelons. Yet even they may ride dragons and drive clouds, soar on wings and control emptiness, with spirit officials as escorts and radiant emanations dispersing to the eight directions.

Subtle and profoundly mysterious—this must not be lightly disclosed.

The titles of these graded scriptures emerge from the *Eight Plain Writings of the Supreme’s Hidden Books*, governed by the protocols of reverent posture.

The Three Ones are the spiritual essence of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids and humors, the jade chamber of the ethereal soul. Thus, the stomach’s reservoir is square to receive things; the brain’s palace is round and void to accommodate the Perfected. A myriad hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit mist, virtue fills Heaven and Earth, merging with Grand Mystery—hence it is called the Muddy Pellet.

The Muddy Pellet is the supreme spirit above the bodily form.

If the adept only knows how to swallow qi and ingest saliva, to knock the teeth and absorb fluids, yet does not understand their origin, these are but the overflow of the Muddy Pellet, the peripheral branches of the brain’s household.

Now I shall reveal to you the secret of guarding the One—the wondrous method of the Highest Perfected. Practice this with a closed mouth, and never disclose it. To violate this covenant is to be consigned to the ghostly bureaus, tormented for ages, with seven generations of ancestors bound in the Yellow Springs.

Two inches above the space between the eyebrows lies the Hall of Brightness; three inches within is the Grotto Chamber; four inches within is the Cinnabar Field. Directly above the Cinnabar Field, an inch-square space is the Palace of Mysterious Cinnabar, the brain’s essence, the Muddy Pellet, the soul’s abode.

Within the Hall of Brightness:
- To the left resides the Luminous Lad Perfected Lord, whose personal name is Xuanyang, style Shaoqing.
- To the right resides the Luminous Maiden Perfected Official, whose personal name is Weiyin, style Shaoyuan.
- At the center resides the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord, whose personal name is Zhaojing, style Siming.

These three lords jointly govern the Hall of Brightness, all clad in green brocade robes, girded with belts bearing four jade bells. Their mouths hold jade mirrors, and both mirrors and bells resemble red jade. Their heads are like infants’, and their forms likewise. They sit facing outward or toward each other—this is the Way of the Hall of Brightness.

If the Daoist feels fear, visualize the three spirits, causing the jade bells to chime so their sound reaches the Grand Ultimate, and their mouths to emit red jade light for ten thousand yards. Once the visualization is complete, call the three lords’ names thrice and knock the teeth nine times—then a thousand demons will submit, and ten thousand ghosts vanish.

If the Daoist is hungry or thirsty, visualize the three lords, whose mouths emit red qi to fill the adept’s mouth. Inhale and swallow it, and soon you will be sated.

If the Daoist travels at night and the path is dark, visualize the three lords, whose mouths emit three beams of fire to illuminate the way, making the road bright and clear.

If traversing perilous places, beset by calamity, or in lands of blades and weapons, swiftly visualize the three lords, causing the jade bells to chime. Focus intently, and enemies will naturally be struck with terror, their intent to harm dissolved.

If the Daoist seeks longevity and immortality, or is afflicted by illness and near death, seeking deliverance, sit upright and rest calmly. Visualize the three lords of the Hall of Brightness, all kneeling outward, their mouths emitting red qi to envelop the adept’s body, encircling the mouth. Swallow the red qi without count, eyes gently closed. Soon the red qi will coil around the body, transforming entirely into fire. The fire will burn the body, merging with it into one, glowing within and without. After a long while, cease—this is called "Refining the Form with Sun and Moon," reviving the dead.

Practice this every night before sleep, and you will surely attain longevity and immortality. Frequently visualizing and swallowing red qi will restore youthful complexion, like that of a maiden. This is the Way of Undying—the essential secret of the Hall of Brightness is now complete.

Upon rising each morning, swallow saliva thirty times, wipe the face with the hands, and rub the eyes. Always visualize the saliva as red fluid at night.

Within the Grotto Chamber reside three Perfected:
- To the left is the Peerless Noble Son,
- To the right is the White Primordial Lord,
- At the center is the Yellow Elder Lord.

These three jointly govern the Grotto Chamber.

This is the Way of Ascending as Perfected; it is expounded separately in its own scripture, detailed in the *Scripture of the Golden Flower*.

Within the Cinnabar Field reside the Upper Primordial Perfected Unity Lord Emperor and his ministers—three in all—who jointly govern the Palace of the Cinnabar Field. This is the Way of the Three Primordial Perfected Unity. Here lies the vital path of the earthly Perfected, the scripture for mounting the dragon chariot.

The celestial Perfected hold many ranks, yet some prefer to become earthly Perfected. The earthly Perfected conceal themselves within official positions, untroubled by the toils of courtly life, thus moving freely and at ease, wandering as they please. They may ride in carriages of the seventh rank or higher, or tread the four *qi* within the Great Void. Though the celestial and earthly Perfected differ slightly in rank, both are of the same Perfected essence. The earthly Perfected, content in their stations, no longer aspire to the offices of the cloud-borne realms.

Within the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace dwells the Mud-Pill Palace Supreme Unity Perfected Lord. One *cun* behind the Cinnabar Field lies the Flowing Pearl Palace. The Perfected Spirit of the Flowing Pearl has its own scripture and is governed by the Controller of Destiny. Its Way is profoundly subtle; to transmit it, one must swear an oath and seal the pact with silk and jade. This scripture is passed down once every three hundred years, and after five transmissions, it ceases to be further disseminated. This is the Way of the Supreme Polarity’s ministers and the Controller of Destiny.

The Mysterious Cinnabar Palace is situated one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field—a purple chamber within a verdant hall, filled with crimson mist. Within it resides the Mud-Pill Palace Supreme Unity Perfected Lord, who governs the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar. The Supreme Unity Perfected Lord appears as a newborn infant, seated upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, clad in a purple embroidered brocade robe, his waist adorned with flowing-fire bells. These flowing-fire bells, though without substance, emit a crimson radiance, and when shaken, their sound carries for a hundred thousand *li*—they are the treasured bells of the Central Yellow Supreme Unity Perfected of the Highest Clarity. In his left hand, he grasps the handle of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars; in his right, he holds the guiding cord of the Northern Apex. The Northern Apex is the unmoving star of the northern pole, hence called the guiding cord. Seated upright in the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, facing outward, he has no attendants. The absence of attendants is why he is named the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord. At dawn and dusk, after guarding the Three Ones, one may then proceed to the final visualization. This final visualization begins with the subtle and progresses to the profound.

The head contains nine palaces; let us first describe them. Above the space between the eyebrows lies a yellow gate and a purple portal, a crimson terrace and a blue-green chamber, all constructed within a *cun*’s span to guard the left and right ears. To the left of this span stands the crimson terrace; to the right, the yellow gate. The Perfected of the nine palaces enter and exit through the path between the yellow gate and the crimson terrace. Thus, the terrace and gate are placed to the left and right of this path to observe extraordinary *qi* and to welcome the comings and goings of the Perfected. The great spirit of the purple portal is named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King. The great spirit of the blue-green chamber is named Upright Heart, styled Primordial Square. Both resemble infants, each clad in robes matching the color of their respective chamber or portal, and each holds a flowing-gold fire bell.

The "guarding *cun*" refers to a point three *fen* inward, so named for its function. When retiring at night or engaging in visualization, first visualize these two great spirits, faintly perceiving their forms. Then, call their names three times, and softly recite this prayer:
*"Purple portal, blue-green chamber,
Two great spirits, hands holding flowing bells,
Bodies generating wind and cloud,
Flanking and guarding the true Way,
Barring all that lies without,
Grant that my thoughts and perceptions
Flow smoothly through the numinous gates,
Entering and exiting with purity,
Ascending through the nine portals,
To behold the nine Perfected,
The exalted of the Supreme."*
After the prayer, proceed to visualize the Three Ones, the nine paths of the Grotto Chamber, and other essential practices.

The two great spirits of the guarding *cun* heed only the Perfected officials within the nine palaces, allowing those within to pass through the eyes and ears at the Emperor’s command. They also permit the Jade Lads and Numinous Perfected to approach the imperial carriage. All others who are not Perfected are barred from entering by these two great spirits—this is the discipline of the Central Yellow Supreme Unity.

Thereupon, the Infant Emperor Lord commands the two ear spirits, Lovely Maiden and Cloud Ornament, to guide the visitor inward. Thus, when one perceives ringing in the ears, it signals an external presence seeking entry. Cloud Ornament strikes the chime and bell to alert the nine palaces, warning of an outsider’s approach. The chime and bell are the sounds that cause the ears to ring. Upon hearing this, one should cross their hands to cover the ears and recite:
*"The Infant dwells within the palace,
The nine Perfected abide in the chamber,
Heed the divine command,
Ever vigilant against misfortune,
The Supreme Unity’s flowing fire
Extinguishes ten thousand calamities."*
After the prayer, clap the ears thirty-four times. If warmth is felt in the face, it is an auspicious sign. If coldness is sensed in the head, neck, or nape, it indicates the entry of malign *qi*. One should immediately lie down, close the eyes, and visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace, casting the flowing-fire bell to expel the malign *qi*. The fire’s radiance will follow behind, illuminating the entire body with a brilliant glow until equilibrium is restored.

If one suddenly hears the sound of rushing water, thunder, drums, or bells within the ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion, the heart’s storehouse severely debilitated, unable to savor the true and nourish life. Instead, indulgence and dissipation have caused the six palaces to lose control, and the hun and po to wail in sorrow—these are the omens of impending illness and death. Thus, the Mud-Pill Palace’s governance falters, the nine palaces lose their regularity, and sorrowful disturbances arise in chaotic succession. The drumming sounds signal the impending abandonment of one’s dwelling and the forsaking of the body. Upon hearing these, one must concentrate the mind and recall the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord, reversing confusion and restoring the true heart. If the transgression is not yet grave, one may still reform upon hearing this warning.

Deafness arises from the departure of the ear spirits. The ears are the listening gates of the Emperor Lord; the eyes are the sun and moon of the Supreme Unity; the nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primordials; the mouth is the crimson abyss of the Crimson Palace.

The brows are the flowering canopy of the White Prime; the hair is the forest essence of the Bright Hall; the tongue is the dragon axle of the Primordial Flower; the teeth are the mighty blades of the Stomach Palace; the hands are the external aids of the Gallbladder Spirit; the feet are the numinous gates of the Kidney Prime; the utmost yin is the true mechanism of the Grotto Chamber.

Within a single body, the hundred spirits each have their affiliations—these must not go unexamined, nor treated with carelessness. Should one suddenly hear golden tones and jade sounds within the ears, it is the true *qi* entering, signaling the Dao’s imminent fruition. If one hears the strains of stringed music, it is the Six *Ding* Jade Maidens come to guard you—this too portends the Dao’s fulfillment. One must then withdraw into seclusion, focusing single-mindedly on cultivation, with diligence surpassing all past efforts. Through this, the Perfected One gradually assumes visible form. Unless your master instructs otherwise, do not speak of this to others.

If one suddenly hears the notes of flutes and horns within the ears, it is an auspicious omen of noble fortune arriving. But if one hears wailing, howling, or clamorous cries, it is an inauspicious omen of base fortune approaching. Should one detect foul *qi* through the nose, it foretells encounters with filth and impurity—an ill omen indeed, hence the warning through foul *qi*. One must immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep clean the dwelling to respond, for this is the Emperor Lord’s way of admonishing mortals. If one perceives fragrant *qi*, it signifies that divine officials and numinous beings are at your side, observing your conduct. At such times, one should perform good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, relieve the destitute, accumulate hidden merit, and extend compassion. The divine officials and numinous beings will then report your deeds to the Supreme, revealing your goodness or failings. The subtleties of the Dao must not go unheeded—all such signs follow this pattern. Unless your master instructs otherwise, do not disclose the perception of fragrant *qi* to others. If one detects foul *qi*, however, one should inform others, making clear one’s transgressions and the uncleanliness of one’s misdeeds.

Should one smell the scent of blood or unexpectedly encounter pools of blood, it portends military strife. One must swiftly withdraw from the mortal realm, entreat the Three Primordial Emperor Lords for deliverance, and observe a three-month retreat in seclusion—thus may the calamity be averted. These are all ways the Emperor Lord forewarns mortals of fortune and misfortune, urging vigilance against disaster. Upon witnessing inauspicious omens, one must practice hidden virtue, extend kindness to save others, do what others cannot, and walk paths others dare not—only then may one escape the fate of certain death. Take heed and do not cling to the ordinary.

Three *fen* inward from the space between the brows lies the *Shuangtian* of the Guard Inch; one *cun* inward lies the Bright Hall Palace; two *cun* inward lies the Grotto Chamber Palace; three *cun* inward lies the Cinnabar Field Palace; four *cun* inward lies the Flowing Pearl Palace; five *cun* inward lies the Jade Emperor Palace. One *cun* above the Bright Hall lies the Heavenly Court Palace; one *cun* above the Grotto Chamber lies the Utmost Perfection Palace; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field lies the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl Palace lies the Supreme August Palace. In all, the head contains nine palaces.

The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Grotto Chamber, Cinnabar Field, and Flowing Pearl Palaces are the Dao of immortality for Perfected Ones, transmitted through the ages. The scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace contains the essential teachings of the True Officials and Controller of Destinies, presiding over the four palaces. This scripture may only be conferred when the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord grants permission—it is transmitted only at the proper time. Those who unite the Dao of the five palaces and practice it in the world, bearing a true name, shall encounter it. Without the destined bone and fate, one will never hear of these teachings.

The Jade Emperor Palace is inhabited by the Jade Clarity Divine Mother; the Heavenly Court Palace by the Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden; the Utmost Perfection Palace by the Supreme Ultimate Imperial Consort; the Supreme August Palace by the Supreme Lord’s Queen. These four palaces are the abodes of the Feminine True Unity, whose Dao surpasses that of the Masculine True Unity. Each possesses precious scriptures, transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not yet achieved Perfection shall not hear of them. The essentials of the Feminine True Unity are likewise not conferred lightly.

Thus, the Supreme ascends the Eight Radiant Sceneries, enters the jade-carriage, attended by three thousand jade maidens who support the axle, with spirit consorts singing in harmony and divine attendants bearing towels—all uphold the Dao of the Feminine Unity, employing it to convene in the Mysterious Dawn. This is the root lineage of the Supreme, transmitted by the Sovereign of the Void. These four palaces exist within all people, but for those who do not cultivate this Dao, the palaces remain empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the nine palaces will likewise find their palaces empty—not merely the four palaces of the Feminine.

Within the Cinnabar Field Palace, the Emperor Lord is ever present; within the Guard Inch, great spirits reside without cease. Yet one must cultivate to perceive them within the palaces. Those who cultivate shall become immortals; those who do not shall die of old age.

The deities of the Masculine and Feminine Unity may be cultivated by both men and women—none are excluded. Only through utmost resolve and bitter toil may one reap the benefits.

In practicing the Dao of the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord of the Mysterious Cinnabar, at dusk or in quiet repose, dispel all distracting thoughts. Whether sitting or lying down, first visualize the purple *qi* of the Northern Culmen star descending into your Mysterious Cinnabar Palace. Soon, the palace fills, and the *qi* overflows beyond the body, enveloping it entirely, penetrating within and without, merging with the purple *qi*. Then, visualize the sun entering the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, filling it until it rests at the center of the purple *qi*, appearing like a fire pearl seen in darkness.

Next, visualize the Upper Clarity Central Yellow Supreme Unity Perfected Lord descending from the Northern Culmen’s purple *qi* into the sun within the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace and taking his seat. His name is *Guīyīng*, his style *Huàxuán*, and his attire and countenance are as described above. Then visualize your own body suddenly ascending into the sun within the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, sitting opposite the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord, dressed as you wish. With reverence, bow twice, press your forehead to the ground, and kneel to inquire of the Dao, seeking immortality and longevity, speaking as your heart desires.

Then visualize swallowing the purple *qi* thirty times. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times. Next, visualize within the Northern Dipper’s seven stars a crimson *qi* as thick as a bowstring descending straight into the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace. Thereupon, the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord and yourself together mount the sun and travel within the crimson *qi*’s path, ascending directly to the Dipper’s *Kui* and resting for a long while. From this meditation comes true response. After fourteen years of practice, you will wander together with the Supreme Unity, both reaching the Pivot of the Seven Origins. After eighteen years, you will ascend to the Upper Clarity Palace to receive scriptures and wear talismans, thereafter commanding eighteen jade lads and eighteen jade maidens. Perform this visualization once each night, keeping count without fail. This practice may also be pursued exclusively, without needing to maintain the Three Ones. Combined with it, essence is enhanced, and resonance comes swiftly.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month at midnight, visualize the Supreme Unity Perfected Lord within the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, seated facing outward, exhaling azure *qi* that enters your mouth. You then swallow it fifty times. When finished, swallow saliva fifty times, then softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Unity, True Yellow,
Central Yellow Purple Lord,
whose name is* Guīyīng*,*
*whose style is* Huàxuán*,*
*seated on a golden bed within a jade canopy,*
*clad in purple embroidered brocade skirts,*
*waist hung with fire bells to slay demons and vanquish treachery,*
*hand grasping stellar essence,*
*neck bearing the sun’s true radiance,*
*now seated exhaling* qi*,*
*causing me to swallow it.*
*Speak with me,*
*feast together in the Mysterious Cinnabar,*
*temper and bathe the seven po,*
*harmonize and soften the three hun.*
*May divine spirits attend and guard,*
*enabling me to ascend as an immortal.*
*May the five viscera regenerate,*
*restoring the white countenance of youth.*
*Receive scriptures in the Upper Clarity,*
*serve as an imperial official of destiny.*
*May all wishes and desires*
*bring forth a hundredfold renewal of blessings."*

Then visualize yourself ascending into the palace to rest before the Supreme Unity. As you fall asleep, wondrous responses will manifest in dreams. By accumulating such practice daily, the steps toward mutual encounter gradually appear.

**The Four Palaces’ Feminine True Unity: Inner Spirit Treasures and Jade Instructions**

For those who study the Dao of the Upper Perfected yet do not know the inner names of the Feminine True Unity, attaining immortality is utterly impossible. Disciples must first receive their master’s oral instructions before proceeding.

On New Year’s Day, the first day of each month, and the day of the Year-Star’s birth, enter the chamber facing east and visualize the Jade Clarity Divine Mother: her surname is *Lián*, her given name *Yù*, her style *Huāngyàn*. She is nine inches and nine parts in height, wearing a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk. Her hair is bound in a topknot of seven strands of pearls and jade, crowned with the *Wújí Jìnxián* coronet. She dwells in the Supreme Above, within the Crimson Palace of the Great Ultimate, the Seven Treasures’ Repository of the Five Numinous Realms in the Dark Origin Precinct. Below, she governs the Jade Emperor’s Palace within your body.

The Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden: her surname is *Jué*, her given name *Huí*, her style *Bìyù*. She is six inches and six parts in height, wearing a sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-silk, and nine-colored hues. Her hair is bound in a topknot of jade and flying clouds, crowned with the *Xuánhuáng Jìnxián* coronet. She dwells in the Supreme Above, within the Great Darkness Palace of the Supreme Kunlun, the Bright Hall Repository of the Nine Radiant Realms in the Great Transformation Precinct. Below, she governs the Heavenly Court Palace within your body.

The Great Ultimate’s Imperial Consort: her surname is *Xuán*, her given name *Xūshēng*, her style *Bówú*. She is seven inches and seven parts in height, wearing a sash of dark silk, flowing radiance, and five-colored phoenix patterns. Her hair is bound in a topknot of seven treasures and dark clouds, crowned with the *Wújí Jìnxián* coronet. She dwells above the Primordial Scenery, within the Supreme Clarity’s Ultimate Dark Palace, the Jade Chamber Repository of the Three Elixirs’ Realm in the Cinnabar Origin Precinct. Below, she governs the Ultimate Perfection Palace within your body.

The Supreme Lord’s Queen: her surname is *Qiān*, her given name *Hánhái*, her style *Héyánshēng*. She is three inches and three parts in height, wearing a sash of seven treasures, flying essence, dark radiance, cloud brocade, frost-silk, and nine-colored hues. Her hair is bound in a topknot of nine dark jade essences and tumbling clouds, crowned with the *Xuánhuáng Wújí* Triple Treasure Jade Coronet. She dwells above the Nine Darks of the Supreme Clarity, within the Cavernous Origin’s Ultimate Perfection Palace, the Cinnabar Essence Repository of the Cloud Radiance Realm in the Darkest Dark Precinct. Below, she governs the Grand August Palace within your body.

To practice the Mysterious Cinnabar’s Dao and maintain the Three Ones’ instructions, one must constantly guard the spirits of the Four Palaces’ Feminine True Unity, their attire, forms, names, and dwelling places. This is the upper chapter of the precious scripture, transmitted only to those who have attained Perfected status. Beginners must not presume to inquire into it. Its essential numinous mysteries are closely guarded and not circulated in the world.

For those who receive the Upper Perfected’s methods and the Three Treasures’ divine scriptures, though they may penetrate the numinous and fathom the obscure, without knowing the Feminine True Unity’s method, they will never succeed. Thus, the Supreme has marked it as a weighty prohibition, strictly forbidding careless disclosure, and has not recorded it in writing. Those who possess it must first examine their hearts sincerely before receiving it.

On New Year’s Day, the first day of each month, and the day of the Year-Star’s birth, bathe, purify yourself, and fast. Then burn incense, enter the chamber, face east, and visualize the Four Palaces’ Feminine True Unity spirits—their dwelling places, names, attire, and heights—as described above. When finished, knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Perfected Yin Spirit,*
*styled the Feminine Numinous,*
*transforming into nine darks’ radiance,*
*riding the true to conceal in obscurity.*
*On an auspicious day when heaven is bright,*
*declare the fast to the Upper Clarity.*
*Heart’s thoughts and eyes’ gaze*
*penetrate and perceive the divine form.*
*Return to guard the palace and dwelling,*
*jade splendor and fragrance filling it.*
*Five colors transform,*
*flowing yellow, purple, and azure.*
*Conveying flying clouds,*
*ascend to the imperial court."*

When finished, swallow *qi* thirty-six times and stop. After nine years of such practice, your face will bloom with jade splendor, golden perfection will reflect its light, and spirits will appear in bodily form to speak with you. Once you have seen the spirits, keep it in your heart alone; be cautious never to transmit it carelessly.

These Four Palaces’ Feminine True Unity spirits are the yin officials of the Heavenly Origin’s primordial generation, bearing the titles of Imperial Consorts. Before the primordial *qi* was established, before the Five Norms were known, before light and radiance were communicated, in the boundless void—without above or below, without exterior or interior, without left or right, without front or back—the Supreme’s primordial essence, the Dark Beginning’s wondrous perfection, the prior state of the ultimate void, condensed *qi* and congealed. Through their transformation, the myriad things were blended, and heaven and earth were preserved—all through the Four Perfected.

Those who can hold utmost sincerity in visualization will remain untouched by age for a thousand years, and among the Nine Heavens, the myriad spirits shall share their longevity.

**The Supreme’s True Talisman and Treasured Writ of the Great Ultimate Imperial Lord**
Transmitted from the Golden Watchtower Imperial Lord to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity.

This True Talisman of the Great Ultimate Imperial Lord comprises the Six Talismans of the Upper Origin, the Five Talismans of the Middle Origin, and the Five Talismans of the Lower Origin.

The Supreme’s method of summoning the Three Ones to guard the form: on the first days of *Lichun*, *Chunfen*, *Lixia*, *Xiazhi*, *Liqiu*, *Qiufen*, *Lidong*, and *Dongzhi*, inscribe the talismans in cinnabar. At dawn, face the *wang* direction and ingest one talisman, proceeding in sequence over sixteen days until all sixteen talismans are consumed. Thereafter, repeat the cycle as before, beginning anew from the first.

When ingesting the talismans, always face the *wang* direction, bow twice, and recite the incantation:
*"The Upper Origin’s One True guards firm the Muddy Pellet,
The Middle Origin’s One True settles the spirit in the Crimson Palace,
The Lower Origin’s One True shields my Gate of Life.
The Three Origins unite in radiance, preserving life eternally.
They summon the numinous and draw forth *qi*, seated in natural descent.
Transforming the form and refining the marrow, bones transmute into immortality.
Feathered and winged, I soar through the imperial dawn."*

Inscribe the talisman again in cinnabar, enclose it in a brocade pouch, and wear it upon the head, avoiding all defilement. After five years of talisman ingestion, one may meet with Perfected Persons; after nine years, achieve spiritual communion and penetrating vision, sitting in life and vanishing in death. Command the Six *Jia* spirits, and heaven shall grant twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens. Ride clouds and mount dragons to wander and feast in the Jade Palaces.

This Treasured Writ of the Supreme was transmitted from the Supreme Imperial Lord to the Grand Imperial Lord, from the Grand Imperial Lord to the Heavenly Emperor, from the Heavenly Emperor to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, from the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity to the Golden Watchtower Imperial Lord, and from the Golden Watchtower Imperial Lord to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, who sealed it to govern the sacred mountains and summon and command the Five Peaks.

Inscribe it in cinnabar upon silk and wear it on the left elbow, avoiding all defilement. After eight years of wearing it, the Three Ones shall all manifest.

On the first day of the first month, inscribe a talisman with a green brush, face north, bow twice, and swallow it. After the Three Ones manifest, use gold as the base—nine inches in length, four inches in width, and three *fen* in thickness—carve and inscribe it to seal the malevolent spirits of mountains and rivers and command the true essences of the Five Peaks.

When the time comes, the Three Primordial True One Lords shall enlighten the practitioner on the proper application and discipline. In the Dao of divine transcendents, face north while wearing the talisman, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and then recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Three Perfected guard the chamber,
Primordial Elders consolidate essence.
Heaven and earth merge as one,
The two qi intermingle.
The Imperial Lord wields his authority,
Commands the lads to seize spirits.
Seal the mountains and summon the seas,
Crush and annihilate the multitudes.
Hasten them to the Northern Emperor,
List the demons’ names in order.
Supervise and restrain without excess,
Swiftly return to the ghostly encampment."*

Once completed, wear the talisman to seal mountains and summon seas, control the myriad spirits, command birds and beasts, subdue the celestial soldiers of all heavens, and wander through the Five Peaks. At such times, first knock the left teeth thirty-six times, visualize the Seven Stars covering one’s head, and exhale red *qi* to crown the entire domain, enveloping all four directions in a blazing inferno that burns within and without, leaving no remnant. See oneself standing at the center of the fire, and in an instant, the divine officials of the Five Peaks and the beasts of mountains and wilds shall come to pay homage. Then recite the incantation:

*"The Primordial Beginning issues the decree,
Proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
The Supreme Perfected Imperial Writ,
Born with the qi,
From below governs all,
All return to the Supreme Clarity.
Should any disobey,
Their true forms shall be seized.
Seal the mountains and summon the seas,
Respond to the command and collapse.
Hasten to submit,
Delay not.
Swift as the true law,
Transgress not the dark bounds."*

Afterward, swallow thirty-six breaths to conclude.

**The Supreme Scripture of the Great Cavern on Guarding the One and the Inner Canon**

The Supreme Lord said: The reason the Perfected value the One as the True One is that the Upper One alone suffices. What the One accords with is the responsive transformation of the Great Void; the One’s adaptability is the mysterious union of heaven and earth. Thus, the Upper One is the Celestial Emperor of the body, the Middle One is the Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, and the Lower One is the Primordial King of the Yellow Court. The Three Ones’ true essence jointly oversees the twenty-four *qi* within the body. *Qi* receives life, and life establishes the body, corresponding above to the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Grand Tenuity. The Perfected *qi* harmonizes and circulates, giving form to all things. The mysterious spirits intermingle and divide, dwelling in the profound obscurity of the Purple Chamber.

*Qi* coalesces the numinous mist to form spirits. Spirits rely on the Three Ones to rule themselves. Transformations are the creations of the Three Ones; those who attain transformation do so through spirits that conceal themselves. The blending of the Yellow and the Mysterious achieves the ultimate profundity. The Three One Lords each possess true *qi*; when the true *qi* coalesces, it naturally forms a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, cloud carriages and feathered canopies, which constantly enter the Purple Palace to ascend the Jade Clarity, inscribe the primordial registers, and protect the embryo and womb.

By nurturing the body with the Three Ones, one becomes a Perfected, soaring through the Nine Heavens and serving the Most High. Thus, what the One accomplishes is the generation of heaven and earth—far more than mere flight or the movements of creeping creatures. If you can guard it with unwavering firmness, then essence and response shall flow unimpeded. When essence and response flow unimpeded, the Three Primordials become visible. When the Three Primordials appear, white *qi* surges and transforms. When white *qi* surges and transforms, the Mysterious Division naturally arises. When the Mysterious Division naturally arises, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders suddenly arrive. Then, feathered canopies may be ridden, cloud carriages may be mounted, and you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, reaching the Grand Tenuity—truly the mysterious achievement of the Three Ones and the convergence of essence and response.

Within the Grand Tenuity Heaven are twenty-four *qi*, blending the Yellow and intermingling, coalescing *qi* to transform. At times, they suddenly divide and awaken to life. From the transforming *qi* arise the Twenty-Four Perfected, formed from emptiness and completed without womb or embryo, all born of the *qi* of the Three One Imperial Sovereigns, branching into the Dao and transforming, entrusting the Mysterious to establish their radiance.

If you can guard the Three Ones within the body, then the True Lords of the Three Primordials of the Grand Tenuity Heaven shall descend and appear externally, even speaking with you face to face. Within the body are also Twenty-Four Perfected, likewise formed from the body’s mysterious *qi* and spiritual essence, dividing and transforming to create the myriad beings. When the cloud carriage arrives and the *qi* merges with the morning radiance, you ascend to the Grand Tenuity. The Twenty-Four Perfected of the Grand Tenuity, together with the spirits within the body, feast in the blending of the Yellow, sharing their radiance within the Purple Chamber, entrusting their forms and *qi* to the thousand paths, reversing old age to return to infancy, altering the register of death in the Northern Feng, receiving eternal existence in the Imperial Homeland, entering and exiting the Jade Clarity, and resting in the Grand Tenuity.

You should also concurrently practice the affairs of the Imperial One, the Supreme One, the Five Spirits, and the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine. Practicing them together makes the resonance of the One Spirit easier to attain. The Purple Chamber must take guarding the One as its root, and guarding the One must take the Purple Chamber as its canopy. Thus, the Three Ones and the Three Pristine Ones rely on each other, as do the Six Harmonies of the Purple Chamber. Though their dwellings differ, their application of the One achieves the same efficacy. If you diligently contemplate and preserve this, the affairs of the Three Ones shall be complete.

If one only receives the Dao of the One, the Three Primordials will not be complete. By focusing the mind solely on the One, one may still attain longevity and immortality, entering the Grand Clarity, but will not be able to wander the radiant heavens of the Grand Tenuity or ascend the palaces of the Supreme Clarity in the north. The Upper One is the ultimate of the True Emperor, the Middle One is the perfection of the True Sovereign, and the Lower One is the subtlety of the True King. The Celestial Sovereign attains the ultimate and thus ascends to the Imperial Ultimate. The Earthly Sovereign attains perfection and thus ascends to the Orthodox One. The Human Sovereign attains subtlety and thus ascends to the Lord of Myriad Subtleties. The Three Sovereigns embody the True to guard the One, so the One has no hidden form. The immortals seek the True to pursue the One, so the Three Ones are all illuminated. The One having no hidden form is the ultimate of the True.

The illumination of the Three Ones is but the attainment of the One. When the True has reached its ultimate and the Three Ones are illuminated, life is born through the attainment of the One. Those who truly guard the One must still the heart and congeal the spirit, concentrating the body to seek resonance. Thus, a hundred thoughts do not arise, essence and intent do not scatter. For three months, turn the gaze inward and focus the heart on the One Spirit—then the spirit’s radiance transforms and generates, entwining the five viscera. This is why the focus does not scatter, the qi is harmonized through concentration, and the utmost solidity is achieved—this is the effect of attaining the One. If false thoughts arise like blossoms and competing desires disturb the heart, the One cannot be fully perceived, and the spirit does not respond. It is not that it does not wish to come, but the one who preserves it is not single-minded, and the one who contemplates it is not discerning. Thus, years of accumulated effort yield no semblance of success. If one can achieve distant resonance with a steadfast heart and no distractions, there is no need for three months of refined contemplation to merge with the One.

The Supreme Lord declared: The Three Primes are the Jade Perfected of the Nine Heavens, the Orthodox Dao of the Upper Perfected. They are the source from which the embryonic root is born and the abode where the Six Harmonies reside. Thus, the Orthodox One Great Dao gives rise to the True Emperor; the Orthodox Dao and Mysterious Perfection generate the Great Spirit. The Five Elders separate and unite, and the myriad transformations swiftly manifest. When the Three Primes dissolve and change, it is from the One that they are born. Therefore, when qi transforms and spreads, the spirit attains numinosity; when the host of perfected beings return to the One, the Mysterious Work is accomplished. This is the ancestral origin of the Orthodox Dao, the root and beginning of primordial qi. When dispersed into the void, white qi merges in obscurity; when nurtured within the form, longevity is eternal.

The method of the Three Ones observes the Dao as complete within the Three Primes. Its Dao is wondrous and marvelous, uniting the numinous scriptures. Heavenly beings, immortals, and perfected sovereigns grasp these treasured divine classics. The first marvel is *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Cavern of Perfection True Scripture*; the second marvelous text is the *Feminine One’s Union and Transformation*, titled *The Scripture of Great Possession and Wondrous Mystery*; the third jade formula is *The Cavern of Perfection Mysterious Scripture*, the Three-Five-Seven-Nine, titled *The Supreme Plain and Numinous*. Thus, the Upper One’s Emperor Lord treasures *The Cavern of Perfection True Scripture*; the Middle One’s Cinnabar Sovereign treasures *The Feminine One’s Wondrous Scripture*; the Lower One’s Primordial King secretes *The Plain and Numinous Cavern of Perfection Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*. These Three-Five designations are the utmost essence of the True Dao, the ultimate chapters of the Three Ones, all forbidden formulas of the Jade Clarity and secret texts of the Highest. If you guard the Three Ones and obtain my three scriptures, you will be able to ride the clouds and ascend to the Grand Clarity, gaze into the boundless, and wander and feast in the Purple Court. How subtle it is to explore! Difficult to express in words.

The One from which guarding is born—there the Three Ones are seen. Since you have attained the One, you naturally obtain these scriptures. The method of guarding the Three Ones is the first chapter of the True Writings of the Golden Watchtower Emperor Lord of the Highest Clarity Heaven, the Jade Dao of the Supreme, the ford of gods and immortals, the wondrous formula of the host of perfected beings. If you can guard the One, the One will also guard you; if you can see the One, the One will also see you. The One must rely on the body to stand, and the body must rely on the One to act. In all your movements—whether advancing or retreating, in a thousand affairs or ten thousand matters—always contemplate the One. When eating and drinking, contemplate the One; in joy and delight, contemplate the One; in sorrow and grief, contemplate the One; in illness and disease, contemplate the One; in peril and danger, contemplate the One; when treading through water and fire, contemplate the One; in urgency, contemplate the One. In all actions and glances, contemplation is manifold. Thoughts must be single-minded—without single-mindedness, there is no hope.

The trouble lies in people’s aspirations not being firm; if firm, they cannot endure. They know the name of the One but cannot guard it; if they guard it, they cannot be resolute; if resolute, they cannot endure hardship. Thoughts without end arise from the original heart. Some know the Dao of the One but cannot constantly guard it, so when the Three Ones depart, the Orthodox qi disperses. Those who lose the Orthodox qi allow the old qi to advance, and when the old qi advances, the day of death draws near. Common people who study the Dao often seek superficial embellishments and do not value the True One. Though they may initially have the aspiration, they later falter and fail, all because their resolve is not single-minded and deviant qi enters. The precept of guarding the One is to beware of lack of focus; if focused but not enduring, if enduring but not refined, if refined but not steadfast, if steadfast but not constant—then the Three Ones depart, and the body becomes an empty dwelling. An empty dwelling without a master—how long can misfortune last?

The Supreme Lord declared: Qi congeals into essence, essence resonates into spirit, spirit transforms into the infant, the infant ascends to become the True Person, and the True Person rises to become the Red Child—this is the True One.

The Supreme Lord declared: Heaven has three luminaries—the sun, moon, and stars—which are also the Three Essences, used for long life. Humans have three treasures—the Three Cinnabar Fields—which are also the Three Perfected, used for eternal existence. The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: "Heaven’s essence and Earth’s perfection—let the Three Treasures always abide." This is what it means.

The Supreme Lord declared: Between the eyebrows is the Upper Cinnabar Field. The Crimson Palace of the heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field. Three inches below the navel is the Lower Cinnabar Field. Together, they form the Three Cinnabar Fields. The Red Child resides in the Upper Cinnabar Field Palace, the True Person resides in the Middle Cinnabar Field Palace, and the Infant resides in the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace. One inch inward from between the eyebrows is the Hall of Light; two inches inward is the Cavern Chamber; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field and Mud-Pill Palace. "Inward" means retreating from the face toward the back of the head. The Cinnabar Field and Mud-Pill Palace is a perfect square, one inch on each side. Visualize purple qi surging to the heavens, with a sun symbol nine inches in diameter within the purple qi, its radiance illuminating ninety thousand miles. My form transforms, appearing and disappearing in an instant, the body forgotten—this too depends on the intent’s preservation. The Upper Prime’s Red Child resides in the Mud-Pill Palace beneath the Flowery Canopy. The Mud-Pill Heavenly Emperor, the Upper One’s Red Child, has the taboo name Mysterious Congealing Heaven, the style Three Primes First, also called Unsurpassed Elder and Elder Historian Hua. His position is the Lord Emperor of the Mud-Pill Heaven, governing the Upper One Palace. To his right is an Imperial Minister, seated in opposition—these are the spirits of my teeth, tongue, and brain, suddenly born through ascension and transformation.

The Upper One’s Imperial Minister Lord has the taboo name Originating Numinous Essence, the style Second Mystery Born, also called Arising Non-Being and Constant Support. These two together govern the Mud-Pill Palace, both naked without clothing, their forms like newborn infants. The Upper Heavenly Emperor Lord holds the Upper Clarity Divine Tiger Talisman, encased in a green jade box. The Imperial Minister holds the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, encased in a purple jade box. They sit facing outward or toward each other.

The Upper One Emperor Lord chants:
*"Mysterious, mysterious Mud-Pill,
Birth-body’s guarded pass—
Grand One keeps the register,
Upper Prime secures the spirit.
Heaven’s constant true qi
Nurtures the form to immortality."*

The palace where the Upper One resides internally guards the Mud-Pill, face, eyes, mouth, tongue, teeth, two ears, and the palace of the nose, as well as the realm of hair and skin; externally, it overawes and expels the myriad ghosts of the Six Heavens and malevolent demons. The three hun and seven po within the adept’s body come once every five days to pay homage to the Upper One Emperor Lord and receive the Dao of blended birth and blended qi.

The heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field, called the Crimson Palace, centered in the heart’s core, four square inches on each side. Vermilion mist soars to the heavens, and within the vermilion mist is a sun symbol seven inches in diameter, its radiance illuminating seventy thousand miles. My form transforms, appearing and disappearing in an instant, the body forgotten—this too depends on the intent’s preservation. The Crimson Palace Heart Cinnabar Field Palace houses the Central One Cinnabar Sovereign Lord within.

The Central One Cinnabar Sovereign has the taboo name Spirit-Moving Pearl, the style Child of Southern Cinnabar, also called Elder of Ascending Life and Historian Cloud Restrainer. His position is the Crimson Palace Cinnabar Sovereign Lord, governing the Heart Palace. To his right is an Assisting Sovereign Minister, the spirits of the five viscera, conjoined qi coalescing and suddenly born.

Entering the Crimson Palace as the Assisting Sovereign Central Minister, he has the taboo name Central Radiance Firm, the style Fourfold Transcendent Numinous, also called Elder of the Hidden Chariot and Historian Dong Hua. These two together govern the Crimson Palace within the heart, both naked without clothing, their forms like newborn infants. The Cinnabar Sovereign Lord holds in his left hand the Fire Star, visualizing it as the color at the center of a chicken’s egg, and in his right hand the Highest Feminine Unity Talisman, encased in a white jade box. The Assisting Sovereign Minister Lord holds in his left hand the Bright Moon Pearl, three inches in diameter, its luminosity penetrating and illuminating. They sit facing outward or toward each other.

The Central One Cinnabar Sovereign Lord chants:

The radiance of the five viscera arises from qi and is born,
The Supreme Eight Effulgent Scenes illumine the courtyard of the heart,
The Central One Imperial Sovereign preserves life and ensures enduring peace.
Thus concludes.

Internally, it stabilizes and guards the domains of sinews and bones, the five viscera, blood and flesh;
Externally, it quakes and dispels the inauspiciousness of the myriad evils,
Nurtures qi and pacifies the spirit,
Prolongs life and extends vision,
Soars as an immortal to the Grand Clarity,
And ascends to the ultimate heights of Heaven.

Within your body, the three hun and seven po,
Once every seven days, come to pay court to the Central One Cinnabar Sovereign Lord,
There to receive the qi of dispersed transformation and forms,
And blend with the effulgence of the womb-spirit.

Three inches below the navel is the Gate of Life, the Palace of the Cinnabar Field.
The Lower Primordial Infant dwells within,
The palace is square, each side one inch,
White qi surges to the heavens,
Within the white qi is a solar image, five inches in diameter,
Externally, it illuminates fifty thousand miles.
Your form transforms and suddenly forgets its shape,
Vague and indistinct in perception,
Visualize it at the Gate of Life,
Where the Primordial Yellow Court King of the Lower One resides within this palace.

The Lower Primordial Infant,
Has the taboo name Beginning Radiance Essence,
The style Primordial Yang Prosperity,
Also called Womb Infant,
And Elder Historian Yuan.
He holds the position of Primordial Yellow Court King.

To his right is one Assisting and Stabilizing Minister,
Who is the guardian spirit of the essence-qi of the yang stem, the white pearl, and the fluid,
Formed from the coagulation of essence and the ascent of returning mist,
Suddenly becoming a person,
Holding the position of Assisting Minister.

Entering the Palace of the Cinnabar Field as the Assisting Minister,
His taboo name is Returning to Upper Radiance,
The style Valley’s Lower Mystery,
Also called Elder of Reverent Submission,
And Bearer of Illuminating Life.
These two together govern the Lower Primordial Palace of the Cinnabar Field,
Both naked without clothing, their forms like newborn infants.

The Primordial Yellow Court King chants:
The jade stem and white pearl fluid,
Coagulate and form the hundred spirits,
Nurture the form with the Five Elders’ talisman,
Remove the register from the Supreme Chariot,
The Gate of Life must not incline,
The golden fluid must not err,
Returning essence fills and seals,
Let not the jade marrow spring leak,
Life and death both arise from this,
Seal it and become a divine immortal.
Thus concludes.

The Lower One Lord holds in his left hand the Grand White Star,
Visualizing it as the color at the center of a chicken’s egg, pure white,
And in his right hand the *Scripture of the Wondrous and Profound Primordial Great Possession*, encased in a yellow jade box.
The Assisting Minister holds in his left hand the Bright Moon Pearl,
Three inches in diameter, its luminosity penetrating the inner gate of the jade stem,
And in his right hand constantly grasps your jade stem, never releasing it.
They sit facing outward or toward each other.

Internally, they stabilize and guard the Assisting Minister,
Your lower gate, the four limbs, fluids, marrow, the hundred orifices,
The intestines, stomach, and bladder;
Externally, they ensure longevity and immortality,
Dispel calamities and scatter misfortunes,
Repel the myriad evils,
And eradicate the Three Worms.

The three hun and seven po,
Three times a day, come to pay court to the Lower Yellow Court Lord,
Receiving the method of sealing essence and nurturing qi,
Coagulating qi to become an immortal,
Attaining perfection from immortality,
And from perfection, the Dao of the Jade Void.

The method of visualizing the white qi and solar image is as above,
Only the color is the same, while the size of the sun differs.
When visualizing,
Do so at the time of generative qi,
Sitting facing outward as you wish.

Visualize the Three Ones settling in their palaces,
Completing a full day’s cycle,
Then at midnight, repeat the visualization.
Always burn incense to the left and right.

The method of Guarding the One:
On the day of the Beginning of Spring,
At midnight,
Sit facing east,
Ingest qi nine times,
Swallow saliva five times.
Thus concludes.

Then visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper slowly descending,
Coming to rest above your crown,
Then facing heaven,
With the handle of the Dipper pointing directly forward toward the east.
After a long while, recite the incantation:
Supreme Mysterious Firmness,
Guard the One and become a divine immortal,
The myriad demons vanish,
The body rides the jade chariot,
Ghostly trials do not proceed,
Cross over to the jade dawn of blessings,
The Jade Clarity Perfected,
Lead me forward.
Thus concludes.

On the days of the eight solar terms, visualize thus,
To repel the trials of Guarding the One.

One who possesses this *Inner Scripture of the Great Cavern on Guarding the One*
Is fit to be a master.
One who receives the scripture
Becomes a disciple.

Thus, the profound establishment of the root is fully expounded,
The utmost sincerity of great integrity is made clear,
Awaiting the veneration of the divine spirits,
And relying on the steps to begin.

Therefore, the master and friend regulate the external,
The Three Ones mirror the internal,
The Imperial Lord delights in his palace,
The Red Child rejoices in his dwelling.

Thereupon, the Purple Chamber shines in the dawn,
The Cinnabar Field glows resplendent,
The Five Elders descend to his chamber,
The Jade Flower rests in his bed,
He will surely ascend to the Grand Rosy Clouds in spirit,
Truly cross the empty cavern,
His body harmonizes with the wondrous numen,
And ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Those who violate this Dao will not be whole,
Those who leak these prohibitions will suffer bodily harm,
Those who hear of this Dao will prolong their years,
Those who practice this Dao will become divine immortals.
How can one not be cautious?

On the day of your life’s destiny,
You may visualize in broad daylight,
Only with reverence and diligence.

For unless one has the immortal bones and mysterious register of former lives,
Or the golden chamber and jade script,
One naturally cannot hear or see the wondrous Dao of the True One.

Or if in past lives one performed good deeds,
Accumulating merit to five hundred,
Or possessed a heart of utmost compassion,
Extending benevolence to birds and beasts,
Or if one’s destiny in this life coincides and harmonizes with the divine,
In all such cases, one attains the True One.

If, when first practicing Guarding the One,
One cannot fully grasp the regulations of the Three Palaces,
The principles of swallowing qi and reciting incantations,
One may follow the original text and practice in broad daylight.
Initially, it is also fitting to read and prepare thoroughly,
So that when it comes time to visualize, it will be easier.

The Three Ones Lords of the Mud-Pill Palace Heavenly Emperor
Are the numinous origin of the one spirit,
The root of life of the hundred spirits,
The mountain source of fluids,
The jade chamber of the hun-essence.
Thus, the stomach reservoir is square and receives things,
The brain palace is round and empty, fitting for the true,
The myriad cavities stand erect,
The thousand pores generate mist,
Virtue cultivates Heaven and Earth,
Merges with the Grand Mystery,
Hence it is named the Mud-Pill,
The spirit above the bodily form.

You who only know how to swallow qi, swallow saliva,
Click the teeth, and ingest fluid,
Yet do not know the source of this,
Are merely grasping the flowing ends of the Mud-Pill,
The peripheral branches of the brain’s household.

Now I shall reveal to you the secret art of guarding the One, by which you may become a perfected transcendent of the highest rank. The disciple who receives this must first observe a forty-five-day retreat before transmission. Prepare thirty feet of blue silk and three gold rings as the covenant of the Cavern of the One, a bond sealed by oath not to be divulged. The master who receives these covenant tokens shall hold them in reserve for those dwelling in forests and marshes, for the destitute in mountain hermitages, for travelers in dire straits, or for those afflicted by sudden illness—never to be used for private gain. Should one violate this and fail to uphold it, they shall die and become a lowly ghost, subjected to the trials of the Wind Blade.

Transmission from father to son shall likewise be sealed by this covenant. In transmitting this scripture, treat one another with profound respect as master and friend—this is the law of heaven and humanity. To hold fast to a single teaching, to serve the One with an unwavering heart, is the mark of sincerity. To receive instruction and seek guidance is the way of the disciple. One who preserves the scripture and upholds the method is called a master. Those who waver between two paths are unfit for guarding the One.

The method of guarding the One: On the days of the eight solar nodes, at midnight, sit facing east. Inhale qi nine times, swallow saliva five times, then visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending gently until they hover above your crown, facing heaven, with the handle of the Dipper pointing forward. The Eastern Yang Brightness and Yin Essence stars lie behind, while the Mysterious Darkness and Perfected Person stars stand before. In this manner, fix your visualization and stabilize their positions.

Next, contemplate the Three Ones, the Venerable Lords, who suddenly manifest and emerge within the Dipper’s bowl. After a moment, the Three Ministers likewise appear as three venerable figures. Soon, six figures ascend together onto Mysterious Darkness, then proceed eastward until they reach the Celestial Pass, where all turn toward your mouth.

Then visualize: the Upper Prime supporting the Upper Minister with their hand, the Middle Prime supporting the Middle Minister, and the Lower Prime supporting the Lower Minister. You then inhale qi once. After a long pause, the two figures of the Upper Prime descend from the qi into your mouth and ascend to return to the Mud-Pill Palace. Next, inhale qi once more. After a long pause, the two figures of the Middle Prime descend from the qi into your mouth and return to the Crimson Palace within. Then inhale qi once again. After a long pause, the two figures of the Lower Prime descend from the qi into your mouth and return to the Lower Cinnabar Field.

Visualize the Celestial Pass star positioned seven feet from your mouth, directly before it, as the Three Ones enter your three palaces. When all is complete, focus your mind intently on the True One Lords, each settled in their proper place. Whether sitting or lying down, keep them in your heart. If you have a wish or desire, present it from your heart, and whatever you seek, petition it from your heart. In visualization, strive only for stillness and tranquility. Even in a quiet chamber by day, you may engage in this practice.

At the Spring Equinox, stand facing east while visualizing the Three Ones. At the Summer Solstice, stand facing south; at the Autumn Equinox, stand facing west; and at the Winter Solstice, stand facing north—each time practicing with the same focused contemplation as at the Spring Equinox.

On the day of the Spring Equinox, bathe, purify yourself, and fast. At midnight, enter your chamber, burn incense, face east, and click your teeth nine times. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within your three palaces, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven figures in all, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yang Brightness star of the Northern Dipper. The Yang Brightness star is the eastern spirit of the Northern Dipper. Visualize entering the star and sitting within it, swallowing purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Eastern Prime Supreme Palace within the Yang Brightness star, where a Green Mystery Youth will bestow upon you the True Light.

First, always visualize the Northern Dipper with a bowstring-like stream of purple qi descending directly before you, and only then proceed to visualize the Three Ones. When the visualization is complete, recite the following incantation softly:

*"The Five Directions summon the Dipper, the gods manifest the Seven Stars.
The Three Venerables congeal and transform, ascending to summon the Purple Spirit.
The Six Gods wander to and fro, the Three Cinnabar Palaces form their citadel.
The Mysterious Passage of the Great Emperor descends to illumine the Yellow Tranquility.
The Heavenly Perfected guard and protect, calling forth the Six Dings.
Immortal and transcendent together ascend, riding the mist to the Great Clarity.
The four limbs become firm and refined, the five viscera spontaneously generate."*

At midnight on the Summer Solstice, enter your chamber, burn incense, click your teeth twelve times, and face south with eyes closed. Visualize the Three Ones within your three palaces, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven figures in all, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Cinnabar Prime star of the Northern Dipper. The Cinnabar Prime star is the southern spirit of the Northern Dipper. Visualize entering the star and sitting within it, swallowing purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Southern Culmen Supreme Palace within the Cinnabar Prime star, where a Vermilion Yang Spirit Maiden will bestow upon you the Crimson Script and the Robe of Treasures. When the visualization is complete, recite the incantation as before.

At midnight on the Autumn Equinox, enter your chamber, burn incense, sit facing west, and click your teeth twelve times. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within your three palaces, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven figures in all, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yin Essence star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence star is the western spirit of the Northern Dipper. Visualize entering the star and sitting within it, swallowing purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Western Prime Supreme Palace within the Yin Essence star, where a White Simplicity Maiden will bestow upon you the Jade Youth’s Tiger Script. When the visualization is complete, recite the incantation as before.

At midnight on the Winter Solstice, enter your chamber, burn incense, sit facing north, and click your teeth twelve times. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within your three palaces, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven figures in all, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Northern Culmen star of the Northern Dipper. The Northern Culmen star is the mysterious spirit of the Northern Dipper. Visualize entering the center of the star and sitting within it, each swallowing purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Northern Prime Supreme Palace within the Northern Culmen star, where a Dark Essence Perfected Person will bestow upon you the Golden Script and the Three-Five Secret Characters in proper sequence.

Upon completing the visualization, recite the incantation as described above. Ensure the Three Ones are settled in their respective palaces, then click your teeth twenty-four times and raise your gaze to intone:

"Three Venerable Supreme Perfected,
Great Mysterious Lofty Spirits,
Yang Brightness governs spring,
Myriad youths open the gates,
Cinnabar Prime governs summer,
Vermilion and purple merge in mist,
Yin Essence governs autumn,
Heavenly Might arrays the six formations,
Northern Culmen governs winter,
Myriad evils and treachery are blocked,
The five earths and the stems geng and ren,
Wu and ji are the Celestial Pass—
All that is shattered shall be destroyed,
All that is faced shall be unassailed.
Refine my seven po,
Harmonize my three hun,
Nurture my five viscera,
That I may attain the True.
Ascend to fly in the Highest Clarity,
Float upon the radiance of the Seven Primes,
Attain long life and proceed in accord,
Command the thousand spirits with a whistle."

This concludes the invocation. These four seasonal visualizations share this single incantation. Advanced practitioners, when performing one seasonal practice, should simultaneously visualize all four. Beginners may perform one season’s practice alone.

This wondrous method of the Three Primes and True One is transmitted only to those of supreme Perfection, not to those of middling immortality. Should one possess this text but not yet engage in its practice, daily reverence, burning of incense, and offerings will still ensure the Three Ones remain within you, averting misfortune, dispelling evil, and dissolving inauspicious omens—though it will not yet bring the cloud chariot.

The Most High declared: The True Ones of the Three Ones are easily moved to respond. With concentrated thought and earnest devotion, unwavering for three months, the Three Ones will manifest in their true forms and converse with you. In all learning, one begins with resolve but later slackens, starts with success but falters midway—all due to having aspiration yet lacking steadfastness, or being steadfast yet not resolute, thus failing to achieve resonance. Heaven does not deceive; it responds with echoes. Earth does not deceive; it answers with shadows. If the echo does not arrive, the spirit has already drifted far. Is this because the celestial truths fail to manifest? It lies within yourself.

In all practices of guarding the One, one must first recite the Plain Incantations of the Thearch Lord to regulate the passes of the six palaces, illumine the obscure mechanisms, settle the Red Child in its abode, and allow fragrant orchids to overflow. When the divine radiance blooms within, the practice of guarding the One will readily evoke true resonance. This Way is profoundly subtle; those who attain it become divine immortals. After nine years of practice, they ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

**The Plain Incantations of the Three Nines from the Most High**
The *Vermilion Numinous Plain Incantations* of the Highest Clarity are the Thearch Lord’s plain invocations, used to regulate the nine apertures and purify the Three Palaces—hence the name "Three Nines." On one’s fateful day or when practicing any scripture, first burn incense on both sides, arrange one’s ritual attire, enter the chamber, sit evenly, close the eyes, and silently recite the incantations. Within a hundred days, the qi will flow unimpeded, the Red Child will rejoice, the true numina will descend, the face will glow with jade-like luster, the body will emit wondrous light, and the subtlest mysteries will become perfectly clear, allowing conversation with the spirits. After nine years of such practice, one will ride the clouds in flight, roaming and feasting in the Great Clarity.

**First Plain Incantation of the Thearch Lord**
In a quiet chamber, sit alone facing east, click the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and silently intone:
"Vast and numinous Azure Prime,
Lesser Yang’s firstborn,
Nine qi return to the liver,
Calming my hun.
The obscure palace binds its blossoms,
The inner treasury shines bright.
Refine my countenance, strengthen my marrow,
Reverse white to azure.
The divine transformation arises within,
Radiance blooms in the Purple Court.
Should any dare to challenge,
Crush them with the Flowing Bell.
The Jade Register of the Thearch,
My name ascends to the Great Clarity."
Conclude by holding the breath for nine cycles and swallowing saliva nine times.

**Second Plain Incantation of the Heavenly Thearch Lord**
Face due south, close the eyes, click the teeth three times, and silently intone:
"Vermilion Court and Crimson Palace,
Above dwell the lofty Perfected.
Three qi return to the heart,
This is my Cinnabar Prime.
Lift my pure body,
Ascend directly to report.
The heart is firm, the spirit still,
The Nine Numinous seal the passes.
Golden Perfection shines within,
Purple mist gathers as clouds.
The Jade Characters of the Great Subtlety
Inscribe my name as divine immortal.
Fly to ascend to the Highest Clarity,
To pay homage to the August Honored One."
Conclude by holding the breath for three cycles and swallowing saliva three times.

**Third Plain Incantation of the Southern Culmen Supreme Prime Lord**
Face due west, close the eyes, click the teeth seven times, and silently intone:
"Primal Simplicity pervades the void,
Heavenly Perfected, Spirit of Lu.
Seven qi guard the lungs,
Abiding with the spirit.
Refine and protect the Jade Treasury,
Containing blossoms in full bloom.
Clarify sincerity, bright as stone,
Roam and ascend the mysterious void.
Jade script and golden tablets,
The Nine Thearchs’ true writings.
Let me fly as an immortal,
My name of death already erased.
Roam the Three Clarities,
Freely as I desire."
Conclude by holding the breath for seven cycles and swallowing saliva seven times.

**Fourth Plain Incantation of the Thearch Lord of the Great Subtlety**
Face the direction corresponding to the current year’s fate, close the eyes, click the teeth twelve times, and silently intone:
"Yellow Prime, Central Thearch,
Spirit of my fateful destiny,
One qi attends the spleen,
That I may attain the True.
The precious treasury blooms,
Binding the network of Purple Dawn.
Transform the radiance, refine the countenance,
Preserve life and prolong existence.
Tilt after all things,
A thousand spirits come to serve.
The Mysterious Register of the Venerable Lord
Inscribes my name as divine immortal.
Long life and enduring vision,
Abiding with heaven."
Conclude by holding the breath for one cycle and swallowing saliva twelve times.

**Fifth Plain Incantation of the Later Sage Thearch Lord**
Face due north, close the eyes, click the teeth five times, and silently intone:
"Mysterious Prime of the Northern Culmen,
Mechanism of the Most High,
Five qi defend the kidneys,
Tortoise and jade intermingle.
Precious blossoms bind the network,
The stomach treasury shines open.
Inscribe my name on the Jade Tablet,
My years equal the Two Modes.
The Supreme Thearch of the Highest August,
Unyielding and unconfused,
Command the Six Jia,
Summon the Eight Might.
Harness dragons to drive the floating,
Transcend and ascend in flight.
Exhale and inhale divine orchids,
Enduring through kalpas without decline."
Conclude by holding the breath for five cycles and swallowing saliva five times.

**Sixth Plain Incantation of the Multitude of Perfected**
Return to face east, visualize the qi of the five directions, complete the sequence, then swallow saliva nine times and click the teeth nine times. Conclude by facing north, bowing twice, and silently intoning:
"Reverently address the Four True Lords of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Culmen: I request the presence of the Five Thearchs, Five Numinous Spirits of the Five Directions, to inscribe their jade characters, harness the ten heavens, bind the myriad pernicious qi, and sever the smoke of all demons. Let me meet them and receive their words."

Then conclude with focused contemplation.

The Most High states: For those who wish to cultivate the scriptural methods, the techniques of visualizing divine perfected beings and guarding the One, without first unblocking the Three Palaces, illuminating the Nine Orifices, and regulating the Five Visceral Systems, any subsequent practice will fail to gladden the spirit-qi, and the true numina will not descend. Such efforts in focused contemplation will be in vain, offering no benefit to self-nourishment. Those of sincere aspiration must refine their conduct in these matters. After reciting the plain incantations of the five directions, return to visualizing the harmonized and regulated qi, so that the inner spirits rejoice and respond in kind, with all becoming luminously clear. Diligently apply yourself, and you shall attain the divine immortals. This is the most wondrous and supreme method, transmitted only to the worthy.

For all who cultivate the Dao of longevity and the method of ascending at dawn, purity, fasting, and earnest devotion must come first. Thus, the learning of the perfected ones—who gaze upon clouds and mist to summon descent, or contemplate emptiness to evoke resonance—how could it be false? The Way of Heaven is profoundly silent, its form indistinct. Since you have set your heart upon it, how shall you preserve yourself? The path lies in utter sincerity, steadfastly holding fast to the true. The Dao does not demand distant pursuit; if you rightly abide for several years, aligning with the qi, the Dao will descend of itself. This is the wondrous secret of the Most High, and those who attain it become divine immortals.

In learning, one must proceed from the lower to the higher, cultivating in proper sequence without skipping steps, lest one violate the celestial statutes. The scriptures comprise three ranks, and the Dao has three grades of perfection.

The *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Celestial Script of Great Characters*, the *Registers of the Nine Heavens*, and the *Way of the Yellow and the White*—these allow one to rein the reins of the dark empyrean and roam the Five Marchmounts, and thus constitute the first rank of the lower grade.

The *Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Cavern*, coeval with the Primordial Beginning, is a profound and abstruse wellspring of wondrous subtleties. Through fragrant orchid fasts and the five invocations illuminating the mysterious, it delivers the seven ancestors and severs the roots of transgression, summoning perfected beings to descend and ascend in flight to the Great Clarity. This is the wondrous middle grade, yielding earthbound immortals of the lower realms.

The *Scriptures of the Highest Clarity*, the *Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir*, and the three hundred treasured names with nine thousand jade instructions—these are the foremost texts of the highest perfected ones, the inner chapters of the Jade Emperor. Those who attain them are inscribed on the jade tablets, their names recorded in the Azure Palace. They ascend at dawn to the halls of the Emperor, for this is the secret of the highest grade, concealed in the heavens above, within the Palace of Great Existence.

In learning, one must begin with the lower grade and progress toward the Highest Clarity. The Dao possesses three marvels: the first is the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*; the second is the *Precious Scripture of the Feminine One*; the third is the *Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Cavern of the Great Existence of the Plain and Numinous*. These are transmitted only to those who have already become perfected beings, not to beginners.

Should one chance upon the opportunity to encounter these texts, merely glimpsing their titles, one must not rashly peruse their sacred words. One must first temper oneself through study, then proceed toward perfection. The Dao is complete in all things, and none who practice it fail to become immortals. Let the learner carefully observe and uphold these words, and never neglect them. To study the Dao without first mastering its statutes is to strive in vain for success.

Statutes serve to restrain transgressions. Knowing the statutes, one amends one’s faults, and naturally aligns with the perfected. The *Statutes of the Supreme Perfected* comprise nine ranks, each with twelve articles. The *Statutes of the Nine Perfected* comprise three ranks, each with nine articles. The *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles* comprise four ranks, each with twenty-four articles, strictly defining the measures of light and grave transgressions and their corresponding fortunes. Thus, the learner should first seek these out. These statutes may be practiced independently by beginners and need not be fully integrated with all scriptures.

The *Nine Perfected Luminous Statutes of the Jade Chapters of the Great Existence of the Plain and Numinous* are transmitted only to those whose bone constitution aligns with the perfected. Following the original statutes of the Primordial Sovereign, they are transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. When the Three Heavens establish rectitude, the cycle changes to seven thousand years, during which one may receive three transmissions. If a suitable recipient appears within seven hundred years, three transmissions are also permitted. According to the statutes, one must present three taels of refined gold, one hundred feet of purple silk, twenty-seven feet of azure silk, five taels of red thread, one catty of aloeswood, and one tael of cinnabar. One then approaches the master to undertake a hundred-day fast—or thirty days—swearing an oath before the Nine Origins, the Northern Emperor, the Supreme Numinous, and the Ten Thousand Perfected of the Jade Bureau, pledging fidelity as a covenant. The sacred and secret scriptures of cultivation must not be lightly disclosed or revealed to the numinous spirits and perfected beings. To violate the covenant and transgress the statutes brings calamity upon the nine ancestors, condemning the errant soul to the lash of death and eternal confinement in hell, never to be released. Body and form shall perish, and one shall never attain immortality.

Those who receive the *Mysterious Cavern of the Plain and Numinous* must transmit it within the prescribed time limit; beyond that, it may not be passed on again. If one’s Dao is complete and the perfected descend, ascending at dawn in transcendence, one may conceal oneself, feigning indolence and erasing one’s traces to depart the world. If a suitable disciple is found, the transmission may proceed through oral covenant. If no such person exists, the scripture must ascend with one to the empty chamber, leaving nothing behind in the world for others to see or hear. Violators bring misfortune and retribution upon themselves; let the learner beware.

For all who receive the Three Treasures of the divine scriptures, one must always fast in a separate chamber, burn incense, and perform morning and evening prostrations as if serving one’s lord and father. One must not defile oneself with impurity or tread in filth, nor treat the sacred scriptures with disdain, lest the jade lads report one’s transgressions to the Jade Bureau, bringing the judgment of the wind-blade’s torment upon oneself. Calamity shall extend to the nine ancestors, annihilating one’s person, and the scriptures shall naturally be lost, precluding any attainment of immortality.

**Supreme Perfected’s Hidden Audience: The Method of Seeking Immortality**
For those who receive and practice the *Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Cavern of the Great Existence of the Plain and Numinous*, on the first, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—three times monthly—one must perform the hidden audience before the Primordial Heavenly King, the Supreme Perfected Venerable, and the Nine Heavens’ Perfected King. On these days, bathe and enter the chamber to burn incense. Facing north, bow six times, kneel, click the teeth nine times, and intone the incantation:

"Supremely reverent address to the Primordial Heavenly King, the Supreme Perfected Venerable, and the Nine Heavens’ Perfected King: This humble servant, Wang Jia, now makes this declaration. On this auspicious day, I bow in reverence to the heavens above, beseeching that my name be inscribed in the jade chapters of the divine immortals. May my bones generate jade marrow, my flesh transform into golden perfection, the cinnabar elixir infuse the mysterious, and purple mist arise within my chamber. May my spirit congeal and my channels bind, giving birth to the embryonic immortal within. May my body endure through ten thousand kalpas, ever attending the imperial dawn."

Having completed the ritual, rise and bow twice more—this may also be done in the heart. Strike the teeth three times again and swallow saliva three times to conclude.

This is the supreme method of the Hidden Audience for seeking transcendence. If cultivated for seven years, the true spirits will manifest in form, appearing in the silent chamber to converse with you. Should you never fail in your daily audience, you shall attain flight as an immortal, ascending through the void to ride the dawn.

**The Three Grades of the Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected**
The Most High addressed the Heavenly Thearchs, the Later Sage Thearchs, the Supreme Ministers of the Azure Lad, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, saying: "All later disciples who behold the titles of the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures and esoteric canons shall have their names inscribed in the Eastern Florescence, written in gold upon the Supreme Clarity. Though they have not yet soared to rein the purple courts of the heavens, they are already those destined for ascension.

Yet even having seen these texts, without knowing the *Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected*—the regulations and rites of inspection—one may not casually unroll the wondrous writings of the Three Caverns or the Most High’s true and precious books. These luminous statutes and sacred secrets are concealed within the Palace of the Dark Capital, in the golden chambers of the Jade Metropolis, and are not transmitted to the world.

They clarify the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns, establish the standards of all perfected beings, deliver the karmic bonds of the hidden palaces, and enroll the seven ancestors in the registers of immortals. They encompass the myriad Dao in their totality, dissolve the ninefold yin’s heavy retributions, and their wonders may be applied at once. Their statutes serve to inspire reverence.

Now, therefore, I set forth the titles of the three grades to extol the Three Wondrous and Pristine Spirit Scriptures, that they may admonish later disciples. Let those who aspire to diligence take heed of these precious statutes."

The Heavenly Thearchs, the Nine Mysterious Thearchs of the Later Numinous Ones, the Supreme Ministers of the Azure Lad, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bowed their heads and ventured to ask the Most High Heavenly Worthy: "The supreme methods of the utmost truth are lofty, transcendent, and limpid, pervading the myriad lineages. They are profoundly still and empty, their wondrous essence radiant and resplendent, their teachings transforming the Three Vehicles, spanning countless kalpas. How could one’s capacity ever suffice? Must one still adhere to the luminous statutes?"

The Most High replied: "Well said, my child. As for later generations of disciples, unless they are scions of the Jade Void, born of spontaneous generation, all are conceived in the primordial qi and tainted by the clamor and filth of the world. Their conduct is not purely formed, their nature not single-mindedly refined. Though they may yearn for the profound and abstruse, their hearts often turn away from me. In all their actions, they inevitably commit transgressions. Transgressions arise externally, while life perishes internally. Those who study in this state—how far have they strayed from the truth!

If the Three Bureaus hold them culpable and their cases lie before the hidden tribunals, if their seven ancestors are examined and their sins accumulate upon them—should they awaken to the fact that the luminous statutes contain systems of correction and punishment, and that the greatness of the sagely transformation allows for methods of atonement, then by applying these statutes, they may draw near to the truth.

For scholars of the Dao who lack such discipline, their painstaking contemplation is in vain, and their arduous devotion yields no benefit. Therefore, I now set forth the *Three Grades of the Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected*, to be transmitted to later disciples who are fit to become perfected beings."

Thereupon, the Thearch Lords, the Supreme Ministers of the Azure Lad, and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate withdrew to purify themselves in the Supreme Clarity. They received the *Nine Statutes of Inspection for the Pristine Spirit’s Great and Wondrous Canon*, sealing it within golden caskets and jade coffers, guarded by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens. These attendants tended the sacred texts, scattering incense in the empty courtyard. Flying dragons and venomous beasts, colossal serpents a thousand fathoms long, brandished their claws upon the cloud-walls, standing vigil at the Jade Pass. Thus, the Ten Heavenly Great Saints and the Perfected Immortals of the Nine Palaces, thrice each month, all ascend to the Dark Palace to receive the luminous statutes and pay homage to the sacred writings.

The Supreme Minister of the Azure Lad said: "All who possess bones of gold and marrow of jade, whose names are enrolled in the Azure Palace, and who obtain these texts must keep them secret and put them into practice. In the rites of reception, one harmonizes with the supreme canons, follows the prescribed measures, and attains the same merit as the perfected. Sins are redeemed, calamities averted, and karmic knots dissolved. The seven ancestral lines rejoice, and one’s own body ascends to feast in the Jade Metropolis."

**The Upper Grade of the Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected of the Dark Capital: The Scripture Transmission Chapter**
The first chapter of the Upper Grade of the Dark Capital states: *The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, *The Treasure Scripture of the Feminine One*, and *The Pristine Spirit’s Great and Wondrous Canon*—these three wondrous chapters, the precious writings of the Supreme Jade Thearch, are concealed in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Mystery’s Numinous Terrace.

According to the ancient statutes of the Primordial Thearch, these scriptures are transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. The Three Dao are rightly illuminated, and the study of the true flourishes. The supreme and orthodox statutes permit three transmissions within seven thousand years. Seven thousand jade lads and jade maidens attend as guardians, bearing incense and tending the sacred texts.

The method of transmission according to the statutes requires a hundred days of purification and fasting, the forging of a golden clasp as a covenant, and the assignment of jade lads and maidens in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Those who transmit without adhering to the statutes shall incur guilt extending to their seven ancestors, whose hidden souls will be conscripted to labor—swallowing fire, eating iron, bearing mountains, and hauling stones to fill the boundless abyss. Their own bodies shall suffer the punishment of the wind-blade, perishing and losing form, eternally confined to the earth-prisons, never to attain immortality.

The second chapter of the Upper Grade of the Dark Capital states: For transmitting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* to later disciples, the oath requires ten taels of gold, twenty-five catties of bronze, five pairs of golden clasps, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and one tael of green silk to bind the clasps as a covenant.

For *The Feminine One*, the oath requires five taels of gold, fifty bolts each of five-colored patterned silk, one catty of incense, and three pairs of golden clasps.

For *The Pristine Spirit’s Wondrous Canon of the Cavern-True and the Dark*, the oath requires three taels of gold, one hundred feet of purple silk, twenty-seven feet of green silk, five taels of red silk, one catty of incense, and one tael of cinnabar.

The Primordial Thearch demands sincerity in these vows; no deficiency is permitted, for any shortfall violates the statutes. Should the master transgress, the jade lads and maidens attending the scriptures shall be returned to their original palace. Within three years, the master shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade and naturally lose the scriptures."

Should the recipient fail to adhere to the clear statutes, they shall lose their luminous form and suffer mutilation. Their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall bear the punishment of the Northern Feng, and for ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings. Let the learner take heed.

The Third Scroll of the Supreme Grade of the Mysterious Capital states: Those whose golden names are inscribed in the Eastern Florescence and whose jade appellations belong to the Supreme Clarity may receive *The Numinous Writ of the Jade Chapters of the Grand Empyrean*, *The Purple Ascension of the Divine Transformation of the Fiery Radiance*, *The Seventy-Four Methods of Supreme Clarity Transformation*, *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, *The Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence*, *The Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Escaping through Flowing Radiance*, and *The Dance of the Seven Transformations in Heaven*. These are the lofty scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ True Kings, the Primordial Celestial Thearch, the Supreme Celestial Emperor Lord, and the Central Yellow Elder Lord, received within the Great Void and the Nine Mysteries, the exalted chapters of Non-Being. They are secretly preserved within the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Supreme, in the Purple Chambers, governed by the Lords of the Three Origins. The jade lads and maidens who attend and guard them number three thousand each.

At the inception of the Primordial Beginning, these scriptures were transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Ways and the rectification of the Dao, within seven thousand years, three transmissions are permitted. Within seven hundred years, if a worthy recipient appears, transmission is also permitted. All transmissions require a fast of ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days, followed by an oath before bestowal. Jade lads and maidens are assigned in accordance with *The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Should one transmit without adhering to the statutes, the sin extends to the seven generations of ancestors and parents, who shall be consigned to the offices of ghostly servitude, hauling the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Night. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn into the paths of non-human beings, while the transgressor’s own body shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, naturally losing the scriptures and forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality. Let the transmitter take heed.

The Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Grade of the Mysterious Capital states: For the transmission of *The Numinous Writ of the Jade Chapters of the Grand Empyrean*, the oath requires a golden fish, a jade dragon, thirty-two feet of green silk, and three pairs of golden clasps. For *The Purple Ascension of the Divine Transformation of the Fiery Radiance*, the oath requires fifty bolts each of five-colored brocade, five taels of gold, five catties of aloeswood incense, one catty of true cinnabar, one inscribed knife, seven golden dragons, and seventy feet of crimson silk. For *The Seventy-Four Methods of Supreme Clarity Transformation*, the oath requires forty feet of green silk, ten taels of gold, six pairs of golden clasps, one catty of fine incense, a golden fish, and a jade dragon. For *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the old statute required shaving the head as a covenant; now, ninety feet of white silk are used as a substitute, corresponding to the number of the Nine Perfected. One catty of green silk thread, twenty-four feet of crimson silk—this is the oath of the sun’s radiance; twenty-four feet of azure silk, the oath of the moon’s splendor; and three pairs of golden rings, the pledge of the Eternal Lads who bear the marks of impermanence. For *The Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth of the Cinnabar Landscape’s Daoic Essence* and *The Jade Scripture of Dissolving Form and Escaping through Flowing Radiance*, the oath requires ten taels of gold, one golden fish, one jade dragon, forty feet of green silk, and forty feet of purple silk, along with three pairs of golden rings each. For *The Dance of the Seven Transformations in Heaven*, the oath requires five taels of gold, one catty of cinnabar, and thirty-two feet of green silk. The pledge must be made with sincerity; no deficiency is permitted, for any shortfall violates the statutes. The master shall offer the celestial pledge to those dwelling in the mountains to relieve the destitute, while the remainder shall be used to furnish the implements for the scriptures. No diversion to other purposes is allowed. Should the master transgress the statutes, the jade lads and maidens shall be withdrawn, their allotted years diminished, and their names recorded and returned to the Northern Feng. Should the recipient fail to adhere to the statutes, they shall lose their souls and spirits, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years, naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality.

The Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Grade of the Mysterious Capital states: The transmission of *The Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, *The Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity*, *The Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, *The Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, *The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, *The Numinous Writ of the Purple Silk*, *The Golden Pendants and Jade Girdles*, *The Supreme Scripture of the Golden Root*, and *The Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens* are the treasured chapters of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Thearch, and the Golden Portal Emperor Lord. They are secretly preserved within the Palace of the Jade Clarity, in the Golden Chambers and Purple Portals, attended and guarded by three thousand jade lads and maidens each, bearers of the numinous writ.

At the inception of the Primordial Beginning, these scriptures were transmitted once every thousand kalpas. After the establishment of the Three Heavens and the rectification of the Dao, within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted. Within a hundred years, if a worthy recipient appears, one transmission is permitted, and jade lads and maidens are assigned. In accordance with *The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, the transmitter must fast for ninety days, or thirty days, or nine days before bestowal. Should one transmit without adhering to the statutes, the sin extends to the seven mystical generations of ancestors, who shall be bound to ghostly servitude without release. The transgressor’s own body shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, die as a lowly ghost, and for ten thousand kalpas, forfeit the attainment of immortality.

The Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Grade of the Mysterious Capital states: For the transmission of *The Wisdom of Dispelling Demons*, *The Golden Chapters of the Absolute Mystery of the Soaring Empyrean of the Treasure Cavern*, and *The Crimson Writ of the Eight Radiant Mornings of the Purple Phoenix*, the oath requires ten taels of gold, one jade tablet, one golden fish, one jade dragon, and forty feet of purple silk. For *The Supreme Scriptures of the Golden Root* and *The Numinous Writ of the Purple Silk*, the oath requires five taels of gold, one golden slip, one jade tablet—each one foot six inches in length and two inches four fen in width—one golden fish, one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of green silk. For *The Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens*, the oath requires thirty feet of green silk, forty-three feet of blue cloth, and five pairs of golden rings as a secret pledge, along with ten taels of gold as the token of communion with the divine. For *The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, *The Jade Pendants and Golden Girdles*, and *The Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity*, the oath requires one golden fish and one jade dragon each as tokens of the pledge. No deficiency is permitted in adherence to the statutes, for any shortfall shall result in the master losing the jade lads and maidens, their names recorded and returned to the Northern Feng. Should the recipient fail to adhere to the statutes, they shall lose their souls and spirits, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years, naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting the attainment of immortality.

**The Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

To transmit *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, *The White-Feathered Black-Winged Scripture of Aerial Flight*, *Treading the Celestial Net: The Seven Primes’ Ascent*, *The Supreme Hidden Writ*, and *The Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*, all are the Dao of the Supreme Lord of the Great Emperor and the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, the secret chapters of concealed transformation. They are hidden within the Jade Palace of the Supreme Lord, in the Purple Chamber, guarded by three thousand jade lads and maidens. According to the statutes, they are transmitted once every seven thousand years. After the establishment of the Three Heavens’ orthodoxy, the interval is reduced to three transmissions within seven hundred years; if a worthy recipient appears within a hundred years, they may be transmitted. The transmission requires a ninety-day or thirty-day purification fast, and the granting of jade lads and maidens in accordance with *The Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*. Should the transmission not adhere to the statutes, the sin extends to the seven ancestral lineages, condemning them to eternal servitude as ghosts in the Northern Feng, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. The master shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, their body lost to the Dark Abyss, forever forfeiting immortality.

**The Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

To transmit *The Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*, the pledge requires thirty-one feet of blue cloth, seventy feet of crimson silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, and one pair of golden buttons. For *The White-Feathered Black-Winged Scripture of Aerial Flight*, two taels of gold, thirty-two feet of blue cloth are required as substitutes for the oath of severed hair and blood-drinking. For *Treading the Celestial Net*, thirty feet of brocade, one golden fish, and one jade dragon. For *The Supreme Hidden Writ*, the oath of the golden fish and jade dragon. For *The Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*, sixty feet of white silk, six pairs of golden rings, and six taels of blue thread. The celestial statutes demand sincerity and integrity; no deficiency is permitted, for any shortfall violates the Mysterious Statutes. The master shall lose the jade lads and maidens, their names erased from the Azure Register and transferred to the Northern Feng. Should the recipient fail to adhere to the statutes, they shall lose their essence and spirit, suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and within three years, naturally lose the scriptures, forever forfeiting immortality.

**The Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

All the talismans of the Perfected of the Mysterious Capital—including the *Hidden Writ of the Seven Voids and Eight Heavens of the Expansive Spirit*, the *Golden Fire-Bell Tiger Talismans of Flowing Metal*, the *Divine Candles of the Night-Illuminating Stems and Branches for Dispelling Demons*, the *Purple Clarity Jade Talismans of the Eight Heavens’ Concealment*, the *Supreme Talismans of the Six Jia from the Five Registers of the Cavernous Mysterious*, the *Secret Writ of the Five Phases*, and the *Jade Regulations of the Mysterious Capital*—number six hundred in total. The Supreme Lord has inscribed their texts within the ancient scriptures to serve as the foundation for their application. The statutes of transmission and oaths must fully adhere to the scriptural regulations; any deficiency incurs the same punishment as the preceding scrolls. Possessing scriptures without talismans invites harm from celestial demons; possessing talismans without scriptures renders devotion ineffectual, and the divine Perfected shall not descend. The statutes decree that neither may be practiced in isolation; to do so incurs the same penalty. Both scriptures and talismans originate from the qi of spontaneity and the principles of the Void, and thus cannot be cultivated separately. Without adherence to the statutes, the Dao shall never be attained.

**The Middle Category of the Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected of the Mysterious Capital: Admonitions and Punishments**

**The First Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

Among later disciples, those whose seven generations of ancestors have committed murder, robbery, plunder, treachery, usurpation, or rebellion; whose nine clans have conspired in treason; or whose transgressions have accumulated in the Nine Yin—such offenses are grave, their grievances and retributions bound in the Nine Darknesses, beyond absolution. Their descendants, burdened by residual calamity, may not partake in the true scriptures or secretly receive the sacred writs. If one possesses a steadfast resolve and aspires to self-betterment, they must first repent before the Seven Mysteries, perform meritorious deeds, liberate imprisoned souls, and expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosening their hair and prostrating in repentance for three years without ceasing. They must present a substantial offering and cast it into the Nine Rivers to redeem past delusions. Only then, after a hundred-day purification fast, may they receive the sacred scriptures and proceed. Should one bear the sins of heaven yet fail to first punish and reproach themselves, or presume to receive the celestial treasures, both master and disciple shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade. Their seven ancestral lineages shall be eternally confined to the Dark Abyss, burdened with stones and mountains, never to be released. Their bodies shall perish, the scriptures lost, and they shall never attain immortality. Be ever vigilant.

**The Second Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

Those who wish to cultivate the supreme Dao yet bear grave sins—having taken lives with their own hands, cruelly oppressed the lowly, slaughtered living beings, plundered the common folk, schemed in treachery, conspired with their nine clans, envied the worthy, or rebelled against their masters—such unforgivable offenses, accumulated in the Nine Yin, bar them from receiving the wondrous Dao or practicing the scriptures. If one possesses a steadfast resolve, they must first confess their crimes, perform meritorious deeds, expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen their hair and prostrate in repentance for three years, present an offering and cast it into the river to atone for their transgressions, and liberate their seven ancestral lineages to be distinguished in the Three Realms. Only then, after a hundred-day purification fast, may they receive the sacred scriptures and proceed. Should one bear such sins yet fail to first confess, punish themselves, and strive for self-betterment before receiving the scriptures, both master and disciple shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, endure the ten torments and eight calamities, their souls lost to the Dark Springs. The scriptures shall naturally be lost, and their seven ancestors and parents shall be eternally bound to the Dark Paths, never to be released. Disciples, be ever cautious.

**The Third Scroll of the Middle Category of the Mysterious Capital states:**

Among disciples who receive the Three Wondrous Treasures, the *Supreme Clarity* secret scriptures, yet recklessly disclose their catalogues, reveal their contents to the unworthy, or profane the sacred chapters, for a first to tenth offense, they shall be punished with three years of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses beyond this, their sins shall accumulate in the Nine Yin, their punishment extending to the seven ancestral lineages, condemning them to servitude in the Three Paths, hauling stones and mountains, enduring the ten torments and eight calamities. Only after ten thousand kalpas may they be released, yet they shall be reborn into the inhuman realms. Their own bodies shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, lose their sight, and be maimed, dying as lowly ghosts, forever forfeiting immortality. Those who transmit these teachings must be ever vigilant.

**The Fourth Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Wondrous Treasure Texts must not weep, approach corpses, or remain in places defiled by blood or filth. For a first to tenth offense, they shall be punished with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may follow the regulations to atone, expiating their sins in the Great Yin, and then resume purification and cultivation. For offenses beyond this, up to twenty-four, their lifespan shall be diminished, and their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall return to their original palaces. Within three years, they shall lose the scriptures and forfeit their lives, while their seven ancestral lineages shall be condemned to eternal ghostly servitude, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Fifth Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not approach women or frequent defiled and turbid places, lest they pollute their true qi. For ten to twenty-four offenses, they shall be punished with three hundred days of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses beyond this, their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall each return to their original palaces, their lifespan shall be shortened, and within three years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish, while their seven ancestors shall suffer punishment. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Sixth Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not harbor malicious intent, commit acts of violence, kill living beings, engage in plunder or treachery, slander the worthy, envy the capable, attack those of shared qi, or undermine their scripture masters. For a first to fifth offense, they shall be permitted to atone by pledging sincerity, making amends in the Nine Yin, expiating their sins in the Five Marchmounts, and enduring ten years of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and continue their cultivation. For offenses beyond five, up to twenty-four, the Four Offices shall execute them, seizing their hun and po souls to serve as laborers in the Northern Feng, while their seven ancestors shall be condemned to servitude. After ten thousand kalpas, they may be released, yet they shall be reborn into the inhuman realms. Their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall each return to the Upper Palaces, and within one year, they shall lose the scriptures and perish, forever forfeiting immortality. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Seventh Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must not urinate while facing north, consume the five pungent vegetables or bloody meats, drink wine, engage in licentiousness, violate the Dao, disdain the Dharma, or harbor doubt and divided devotion. For ten to twenty-four offenses, they shall be permitted to atone according to the regulations by pledging sincerity, making amends in the Great Yin, enduring one year of severed merit, and then resuming purification for ninety days before continuing their cultivation. For offenses beyond this, their lifespan shall be shortened, their bodies shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade, and their seven ancestral lineages shall be condemned to servitude in the Three Paths. Within five years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Eighth Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All disciples who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Caverns’ secret texts must, in accordance with the regulations, present their pledge and visit their master to announce their purification before receiving the scriptures. They must not recklessly reveal the sacred texts without first making a vow. If they obtain the scriptures from ordinary people and then take them as masters to transmit the teachings, such transmission is permissible, but they must not lightly transcribe or alter the sacred texts, interpret them arbitrarily, corrupt the ancient pronunciations, or devise their own methods. The Four Offices shall investigate such transgressions, and their sins shall be recorded in the Nine Yin. For a first to third offense, they shall endure three years of severed merit and suspended practice, atone according to the regulations, present their pledge to the Nine Rivers, and then purify themselves for thirty days before resuming their cultivation. For offenses beyond this, up to twenty-four, their Jade Boys and Jade Maidens shall each return to their original palaces, their lifespan shall be diminished, their bodies shall be consigned to the ghostly officials, and their seven ancestral lineages shall be condemned to eternal ghostly servitude. After ten thousand kalpas, they may be released, yet they shall be reborn into the inhuman realms. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Ninth Scroll of the Middle Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** All who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity or the Three Wondrous Treasure Texts must place them in a separate chamber upon a high bed, four feet and four inches in height and five inches in width, to enshrine the received scriptures. They shall keep lamps lit and burn incense, offering morning and evening reverence and prayers, always making offerings. They must not allow those of impure qi, defiled or polluted persons, or women to enter the chamber, lest they offend the divine perfected. These are the regulations observed in the world. Those who receive the scriptures must not wear clothing, sandals, or other items shared with the uninitiated; in rest, repose, sitting, and rising, they must always remain distinct from ordinary things. For a first to twenty-fourth offense, they shall be punished with one year of severed merit and suspended practice, after which they may resume purification and cultivation. For offenses beyond this, they shall be seized by the Four Offices, their transgressions reported to the Jade Clarity, and their names returned to Fengdu. Within seven years, they shall lose the scriptures and perish, while their seven ancestors shall suffer punishment. Disciples, be vigilant.

**The Lower Section of the Redemption of Sins in the Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected of the Mysterious Capital**

**The First Scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states:** If any later disciple’s seven ancestors or parents committed in their lifetimes the sins described in the first scroll of the Upper or Middle Sections of the Mysterious Capital, their punishment shall be especially severe, their sins bound in the Nine Yin, their seven ancestors becoming vengeful adversaries, suffering eternal torment in the dark realms, their misfortunes extending to their descendants, and their spectral bonds never released. They must prostrate themselves beneath the Great Yin, their hair unbound, kowtowing to confess their sins to the Nine Yin and self-recriminate for three years. At the end of the year, they shall present nine pairs of golden rings, one liang of green silk, and one golden figurine, casting them into the mouth of the Three Rivers to redeem the sins of their seven ancestors and deliver their souls from the trials of the dark realms. The regulations require a peachwood tablet inscribed in red with five lines, recording: *"On such-and-such a day, month, and year, so-and-so of such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, Wang Jia, on behalf of his seven ancestors, parents, and himself, having committed the sins described in the first scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections of the Mysterious Capital, with sins bound in the Nine Yin, now respectfully presents nine pairs of golden rings and one golden figurine in accordance with the regulations to redeem the cruel punishments of the dark souls, casting this document to report his fate and return his confession to the Water Palace, thereby dissolving his sins, extinguishing the records of the Three Offices, and allowing the souls to ascend to the Nine Heavens."* Upon completion, the items and tablet shall be bound with green silk and sunk with a green stone. At the moment of sinking, they shall face north, kowtow, and recite the incantation:

The Nine Lords of the Great Yin govern the spirit-officials. Jia now makes this declaration, returning it to the River Source, casting the missive into the Nine Springs, to extricate the Seven Mysteries, dissolve all karmic grievances, and allow my person to ascend as an immortal.

Thus concluded.
Through this, the trials of the seven ancestors shall be released, freed from the Dark Palace, and ascend to the Hall of Blessings. My person may then proceed to study the precious scriptures, and after nine years, true spirits shall descend in form, ascending together with the gods. The Mysterious Regulations are most severe—transgress them no further.

The second scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who wish to cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if they have previously committed sins described in the second scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections, with trials bound in the Nine Yin, their sins coiled in the netherworld, extending to the seven ancestors, their trials and suffering souls entangled without release—must first, beneath the Great Yin, face north with unbound hair, kowtow, and confess their sins to the Three Lights, fulfilling three years of penance. Upon completion of the year, they shall present one *jin* of cinnabar, one inscribed knife, one *liang* of green silk, and one golden figurine, casting them into the confluence of the Three Rivers to redeem their own cruel and rebellious transgressions, dissolve the knots of the Three Offices, and extricate the seven ancestors. The regulations require writing in cinnabar on a one-*chi* length of green silk, recording as follows: "On such-and-such a year, month, and day of the new moon, so-and-so of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, Wang Jia, aged so-and-so, having no prior witness to his conduct, has violated the Mysterious Regulations, committing primordial evil, incurring the sins of the second scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections of the Mysterious Capital, with sins bound in the Great Yin. Now, in accordance with the regulations, he presents one golden figurine, one *jin* of cinnabar, and one inscribed knife to continue the redemption of his own foul and wicked sins, casting this document to report his fate and return his confession to the Spirits, thereby dissolving his sins, extinguishing the records of the Nine Rivers, and attaining longevity." Upon completion, bind the items and text with green silk and sink them with a green stone. At the moment of sinking, face north, kowtow, and recite the incantation:

Above are the Nine Lords of the Great Yin who govern the affairs. Jia now makes this declaration, returning it to the River Source, to redeem sins and dissolve knots, extricate the Nine Trials, and allow grievance-bound souls and spirits to each return to their natural state. May misfortune be extinguished and the study of immortality achieved, that my person may ascend.

Thus concluded.
Through this, the knots of the Nine Yin shall be untied, and the souls of karmic grievances shall return to their natural state. One may then proceed to study the scriptures of the Supreme Clarity, and after nine years without fail, true spirits shall descend in form, uniting with the gods in the unseen. The Mysterious Regulations are most severe—transgress them no further.

The third scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who study the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity and the secret texts of the Cavern Mystery, if they have committed sins described in the third scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections, with trials bound in the Great Yin and reported to the Jade Clarity by the Four Offices—shall sever their merits and restrain themselves, enter the chamber to burn incense, kowtow in self-reproach, face north, and click their teeth ten times, raising their heads to pray:

O profound and distant Mysterious Primordial, rarely heard in the lower world, I have lightly divulged the precious truth, offending the august honor of the Emperor. I submit myself to bear responsibility, prostrating at the Gate of the Spirits. I humbly beseech the Most High to bestow the grace of the Mysterious, descend with numinous response, and awaken the natural.

Thus concluded, kowtow nine times. After three years of such confession, undertake a thirty-day purification fast, thereby dissolving the Three Offices, releasing the trials of the Nine Yin, and resuming cultivation. By treasuring and secretly reciting the scriptures, one may attain flight as an immortal. The Mysterious Regulations are most severe—transgress them no further.

The fourth scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if they have committed sins described in the fourth scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections, with sins bound in the Nine Yin and trials reported to the Jade Clarity—shall, at midnight in the central courtyard, light thirty-two lamps to cleanse impure *qi*, purifying both inner and outer. Enter the chamber to burn incense, face north, kowtow, and confess their transgressions, clicking their teeth thirty-six times, raising their heads to recite the incantation:

The world’s fortune wanes, corpse-ghosts obscure the path, impure *qi* swirls, clashing with the true. Violating regulations and breaking precepts, I have entered the realm of sin. I redeem myself through ritual and confession, washing away with bright lamps. May misfortune scatter from the Three Clarities, and blessings fill my prosperity. May the Dao’s shade flow in grace, its blessings boundless.

Thus concluded, kowtow nine more times. After one year of this, undertake a thirty-day purification fast, then resume cultivation, strictly adhering to the regulations, diligently focusing on the truth for nine years, and attain ascension at dawn. The Mysterious Regulations are most severe—transgress them no further.

The fifth scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if they have committed sins described in the fifth scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections, with sins bound in the Great Yin and trials suspended in the Azure Palace—shall prepare fragrant water for bathing, present oil in the central courtyard, and light twenty-four lamps for ninety days. Enter the chamber, face north, kowtow nine times, confess their transgressions, and click their teeth twenty-four times, raising their heads to recite the incantation:

Heaven and Earth, the two images in communion, yin *qi* mingling with the correct, impure *qi* overflowing. The spirit is lost, the treasure diminished, the Dharma’s countenance marred. I reverently set forth bright lamps to illuminate the Mysterious Palace. May misfortune be extinguished in the Nine Yin, and blessings return to the ancestral lineage.

Thus concluded. After ninety days, conclude the fast with twenty-four days of retreat, then resume the cultivation of the true Dharma. In every petition, be cautious, clearly follow the regulations, and attain union with the Mysterious Perfected as an immortal. The Mysterious Regulations are most severe—transgress them no further.

The sixth scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if they have committed sins described in the sixth scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections, with particularly grave sins seized by the Four Offices, trials bound in the Nine Yin, and confrontations in the Dark Palace—shall, beneath the Great Yin, with unbound hair and kowtowing, confess to the Jade Clarity and extricate the Great Yin. According to the regulations, they shall secretly distribute treasures to beg among the poor, providing meals for a hundred people to feed the hungry and destitute for ten years.

Enter the chamber, kowtow in self-reproach, face north, and click the teeth nine times. Look up and recite the incantation:

"Vast are heaven, broad is earth,
Nine springs unfold their gates.
This body treads the gate of calamity,
Its sins suspended in Jade Capital.
Nether ropes entangle, dark caverns cloud,
Yet scattering treasures lifts the guilt,
Bestowing alms to the destitute.
Sins dissolve in the Great Yin,
Blessings arise in ten directions.
Cast off the old, embrace the new—
Thus flourishes the unending."

When finished, kowtow nine more times to conclude.

This is the supreme method of absolving sins, recorded in the orthodox regulations. Practiced thus for ten years, all lingering sins and stagnant qi dissolve in the Great Yin. Upon completing a year of self-reproach and almsgiving, fast for a hundred days more, then return to cultivation. Examine the self and guard the precepts, transgress no further.

The seventh scroll of the Lower Section of the Mysterious Capital states: Those who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if they have committed sins described in the seventh scroll of the Upper and Middle Sections—sins that fill the Upper Clarity—shall offer ten pounds of fine incense to fellow practitioners in ten gatherings, absolving one year of guilt.

Enter the chamber, burn incense, face east, and kowtow nine times. Bow in repentance to the Supreme Perfected, click the teeth nine times, look up, and recite the incantation:

"Five qi interweave,
The Supreme Perfected incomplete.
This body tainted by defiled qi,
Offends the gates of cavernous depths,
Harms the treasuries, severs life,
Shakes the Three Passes.
Violating regulations, breaking precepts,
Suffering trials, prolonging woe—
With reverent penance,
I report to the Imperial Honored Ones,
Begging to proclaim now:
Depart the lower realms,
Ascend to celestial immortality."

When finished, continue thus for a full year, then fast for twenty-four days before resuming cultivation. Only then may the true numinous powers descend.

The gravity of the sacred statutes forbids repeated transgressions.

The eighth section of the Lower Rank of Xuandu states: For those who study the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if one commits sins listed in the eighth section of the Upper or Middle Ranks, and is seized by the supervisory officials, the case shall be bound and tried before the Three Clarities. The offender must take one *hu* of pure oil and kindle lamps in the central courtyard, the number to be as one wishes, until the oil is exhausted. Furthermore, offer ten *jin* of fine incense to a master who possesses the scriptures, to absolve three years of transgressions. Enter the chamber, burn incense, face north, and kowtow nine times. Bow in repentance for the offense committed, click the teeth twelve times, look up, and recite the incantation:

"The Celestial Perfected are lofty and distant,
The radiance of the Mysterious descends in clarity.
By virtue of past blessings,
I beheld the true scriptures.
Yet failing to grasp the Mysterious Statutes,
I slighted the numinous powers of Heaven,
Violated the true precepts,
And sank my person into darkness.
With reverent self-chastisement,
I report to the Supreme Clarity.
From this moment onward,
I shall cleanse my former form,
Uphold the Mysterious Perfected,
And align with the Dao as one."

When finished, complete a full three years, then fast for ninety days. Only after receiving transmission from a master may one resume cultivation. Those who have not yet received transmission must present offerings and visit a master to receive the scriptures and cultivate in accordance with the statutes, thereby attaining ascension.

The gravity of the Mysterious Statutes is profound—transgressions must not recur.

The ninth section of the Lower Rank of Xuandu states: For those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, if one commits sins listed in the ninth section of the Upper or Middle Ranks, the offense shall be bound to the Great Yin and suspended for trial in the Jade Clarity. The offender must kindle seven lamps before the hall, enter the chamber, kowtow, and confess the sin before the scriptures. Click the teeth twenty-four times, look up, and recite the incantation:

"The radiance of Jade Light descends,
Illuminating the Supreme Clarity.
Neglecting reverent offerings,
I violated the precious scriptures.
I fear the Four Administrations
Will list my crimes in the Purple Court.
With solemn fasting and devotion,
I beseech the true numinous powers
To condescend and descend,
Erasing my sins and dissolving my punishments.
I pledge to uphold the Mysterious Statutes,
Preserving my primordial integrity forever."

When finished, continue thus for a full year, then fast for twenty-four days before resuming the cultivation of what was received.

The gravity of the Mysterious Statutes is profound—one must be vigilant and avoid further transgressions.

The *Tai Xuan Jiu Zhen Ming Ke* comprises three ranks and twenty-seven clauses, originating from the Palace of Lingdu in the Supreme’s realm. These are treasured and concealed by the Supreme, never to be disseminated below. Now, the essential methods are excerpted and established for the sake of later sages, to elucidate the Three Marvels and inscribe them in the *Great Primordial Unadorned Numinous Scripture*. Those whose bones align with immortality may employ this text to absolve sins, resolve transgressions, untie knots, and disperse obstructions. The Seven Mysteries shall be no more, and after three years, the true numinous powers shall manifest, merging with you to ascend together to the Nine Heavens. To recklessly divulge the Mysterious Statutes incurs the same guilt as described above. They must be treasured in secrecy and practiced in confidentiality.

The *Nine Perfected of Xuandu* states: The transmission of scriptural titles listed in the Three Ranks of the Nine Perfected occurred when the Later Sage Lord first received the scriptures, which were bestowed upon him by the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme’s transmission of the scriptures emerged from the Three Ranks of Illuminated Statutes, to assist the Three Treasures of marvelous texts and the scriptures of the Supreme Perfected. The statutes and regulations for their application, along with the thirty-one scrolls, independent matters, and various scriptural rituals, are all contained within the *Illuminated Statutes of the Four Poles*. The Three Ranks of the Nine Perfected place the upper sections of the Three Primordials within the palaces of the Nine Emperors. The Four Poles, governed by the officials of the Four Administrations, oversee all prohibitions and punishments for transgressions. The *Illuminated Statutes of the Supreme Perfected*, received by the Supreme Lord from the Mysterious Chapters of the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, contain the rituals and regulations of the Supreme Perfected. Their methods are concealed above the Nine Heavens, in the halls of the Supreme Lord, and their admonitions are stored in the palaces of the Supreme Perfected, never to be practiced in the world. The *Illuminated Statutes of the Nine Perfected* restrain later learners, while the *Illuminated Statutes of the Four Poles* govern the four directions. Their purport is subtle and profound, and without golden characters or jade inscriptions, they remain unknown. Those who obtain these texts need not study to achieve perfection.

The statutes exist to restrain sins; seeing the statutes, one reforms. To reform is to incur no deficit before Heaven and Earth; to incur no deficit before Heaven and Earth is to align with spontaneity. Aligning with spontaneity enables one to ascend and supplement the ranks of the true immortals. Without statutes, learning drifts ever farther from immortality.

The *Nine Perfected of Xuandu* states: For those of utmost aspiration whose names enter the Mysterious Palace, if one wishes to receive the Illuminated Statutes alone to understand the prohibitions of Heaven’s laws before receiving the scriptures, and upon verifying that one’s bones align with the Dao, one may first make a covenant and then receive them. The covenant’s ritual implements and offerings must adhere to the quantities prescribed in the *Three Marvels’ Precious Scriptures*, and the time limits shall be the same. They must not be lightly bestowed upon the unworthy, nor may the Mysterious Texts be revealed. To disregard the statutes’ purport is to consign oneself to the offices of ghosts, while one’s seven generations of ancestors shall tread upon the Knife Mountain and Sword Tree, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Those who outwardly appear devoted but do not follow the statutes incur the same guilt as described in the statutes. The prohibitions for both parties are strict—practitioners, be vigilant!

The *Nine Perfected of Xuandu* states: Those who receive the supreme methods yet fail to uphold the Illuminated Statutes violate Heaven’s prohibitions, incurring guilt that burdens their seven generations of ancestors and brings trials upon themselves. Once one has reformed and chastised oneself, resuming cultivation of what was received, yet lapses again into transgression, the trials shall double those of the past. This indicates that one’s bones and destiny are unaligned, body and true nature at odds, the *po* soul consorting with ghosts—none may again reform and cultivate the true scriptures. I now elucidate the Illuminated Statutes to awaken those who remain unawakened. Once awakened, to transgress again—what purpose does that serve? Practitioners, be vigilant! Practitioners, be vigilant!

**The Supreme Lord’s Verse of Wondrous Praise for the Great Primordial**

In the dim vastness of primordial transformation,
The faint morning mist disperses.
Above the Great Stillness, in the empty mystery,
The Two Modes separate in clarity.
Congealing essence, embracing the empty womb,
Forming transformations, nurturing numinous vision.
Containing truth, nourishing the spirit within,
In a flash, the dark dawn breaks.
At last, I awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years,
As fate turns toward the celestial Han.
Whispering, I chant the *Steps of Emptiness*,
Circling to pay homage in the Jade Capital.
Bowing my head, I return to the Great Nonbeing,
Riding the wind, scattering numinous fragrance.
Gazing up and down in the halls of emperors,
I drift and soar with the void.
Wondrous songs emit strange sounds,
Chanting the verses of the Supreme Perfected.
Flowing through the Four Great Realms,
The measure of the Ten Heavens knows no bounds.

The Terrace of Mystery emits the dark night’s glow,
Divine candles spout wondrous light.
Resplendent, the jade forest’s blossoms gleam,
Their radiance dazzling the jasper halls.
Void-born, the natural mist arises,
Lush and dense, it upholds the dark net.
The host of Perfected unfurl the clouds in praise,
Jewel canopies rise with the wind.
Flying steps chant the *Songs of Emptiness*,
Divine hymns transform and lengthen the Dao.
Profound and vast, the Great Transformation flourishes,
Solemn and grand, this Dao now thrives.
Accumulated study responds to the sun’s influence,
Merit complete, one enters the Great Vehicle.
Blessings and joy extend to all,
The seven ancestors all ascend.
Aligning the carriage, one soars past Mount Taihua,
Turning the reins, one leaves the Cloud Pavilion far behind.
Divine winds stir the empty vastness,
Fragrant flowers ride the mist and scatter.
Whispering, one pays homage in the Hall of Emptiness,
In orderly ranks, one treads the dark Han.
Bright chants awaken the hidden heart,
Delivering from the karmic roots of old.
The Five Sufferings dissolve in due time,
Fragrance flows into the vessel of refinement.
The Dark Gate towers amid the cloud-net,
Flying rosy clouds wing the numinous chariot.
Lifting the traceless Perfected,
One enters the Great Void in subtle grace.
Riding the void, one recites the jade scriptures,
Desolate and serene, one chants the feathered writ.
Vast mindfulness pervades all without exception,
All things abound in joy and surplus.

The Heavenly Emperor’s Hymn of Praise:
The Supreme Dao arises from empty stillness,
Dark echoes seek one another in shadow.
The Three Perfected are fundamentally one in origin,
Qi transforms—principles return yet differ.
The Dharma-wheel turns within the formless,
Drifting and flowing in pure vision.
The congealed verses require no thought,
Qi coalesces, uniting with the dark tally.
Divine chants emit the *Songs of Emptiness*,
Chanting and wandering the void in play.
The dark transformation leaves no trace,
Yet traces give rise to the Dao’s lineage.
Roaming the nine heavens’ expanse,
One rests the carriage at the Six Peaks’ palace.
Lifting the exalted guests,
One returns to the Primordial Numinous Chamber.
The Dao flows freely within the vast and desolate,
Divine songs resound in the Great Void.
Forms respond in the Court of Supreme Stillness,
Thoughts and chants connect the subtle and distant.
Light veils the lingering dawn’s glow,
Radiance shades the Jade Capital’s grounds.
The dark dragon requires no carriage,
Whispering, one soars the void in flight.
Hand plucking the seven-jeweled blossoms,
Divine winds scatter wondrous fragrance.
Wondrous chants arise from the heart’s depths,
Brilliant and bright, they reveal the jade verses.
The myriad qi merge as one in the Primordial,
All return to the Three Mysteries’ beam.
Riding the heavens, one does not call them high,
Gazing afar, the Nine Darks stretch boundless.
Flapping wings, one longs for the dark reins,
Yearning to ascend, one admires the cloudy skies.
Accumulated mindfulness invokes divine response,
Hoping to commune with the Jade Perfected.
Dim and bright, the celestial Han clears,
Drifting and floating, the radiant clouds return.
The Three Perfected soar into the void,
Guiding the reins swiftly to the Purple Tenuity.
Bright chants deliver the later selves,
All are bidden to ride the radiance and fly.
Delivering from the Three Paths’ trials,
The Nine Darks’ bitter sorrows dissolve.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity intones:
The Supreme Perfected arises from the empty cavern,
Jasper gauze illumines the jeweled terrace.
Circling, one pays homage in the Dark Capital,
The host of immortals chant subtle verses.
Turning within the traceless,
Void songs harmonize with hidden trysts.
Delivering the self, one ascends to heaven,
Chanting and reciting, one lays the foundation of blessings.
Urging the reins toward the Rosy Clouds’ pavilion,
From time to time, one feasts amid the radiant clouds.
Drifting and floating without bounds,
Leaving suffering, one enters the Dark Gate.
The mind at ease, the Dao flows freely,
The cinnabar heart and will also part.
Accumulated study renews with each day,
Chanting my Primordial Numinous Writ.
The Eight Radiances drive the heavenly chariot,
Flying clouds gather the dark numen.
The plain canopy rides the wind in return,
Vast and distant, one enters the Purple Clarity.
Wondrous hymns praise the myriad Perfected’s melodies,
Jade echoes—how clear and ringing!
Delivering from the Nine Yin’s registers,
The self returns to the Southern Court.
Joy flows universally to all,
Wondrous transformations flourish without exception.
Pure and still, the Dark Dao’s lineage,
Bright and clear, it illumines the Great Void.
Wondrous transformations arise from silent stillness,
Subtle thoughts dwell in the Three Primes’ palace.
Accumulated mindfulness pierces the dark void,
Subtle and faint, the Supreme Dao connects.
Knocking and chanting resound in the dark stillness,
Divine hymns flourish without fail.
Cinnabar radiance reflects the numinous court,
Purple mist illumines the jade forest.
Resplendent, the seven-jeweled blossoms gleam,
Dazzling, they sway with the numinous sound.
Gong and shang harmonize of themselves,
Wondrous essence captivates the heart.
Dark hymns sow the fields of blessings,
Vast deliverance knows no bounds.

The Golden Portal Emperor of Later Saints intones:
Vast and boundless, the Primordial Heaven of Origin,
The Three Images merge as one in the dark.
Whispering, the true Dao thrives,
Vast and grand, the Great Vehicle soars.
The six qi return to the true court,
All converge in the Mud-Pill Chamber.
Entering and exiting, one roams the Emperor’s halls,
Flowing essence illumines the clouds and sun.
Circulating, one returns to the celestial Han,
Subtle and graceful, one rides the dark seven.
Round blossoms reflect the luminous pearl,
The two radiant scenes face the true light.
Numinous brilliance initiates the soaring assembly,
Dark images intertwine with Fusang.
Dark deliverance seeks itself,
Yin flows freely, brightening the eight wastes.
If one can consume this essence,
One will long uphold the dark net.
Playing in the Nine Darks’ terrace,
Resting at ease on the western feathered slope.
Divine beasts sing in the jasper halls,
Flying phoenixes intermingle in flight.
Void-born, the natural hymns arise,
Perfected ones chant in harmonious rhythm.
Transforming the self amid the kalpa’s trials,
Incense and destiny summon the pure song.
Establishing merit, founding fields of blessings,
Delivering the later selves from the net.
The seven darks scatter from the hidden palace,
Dark departures know no hardship.
Flying steps tread the cloudy peaks,
Soaring wings reach the Eastern Flower Palace.
Winds and clouds chant within the void,
Jade sounds scatter in the jasper halls.
Perfected ones chant the *Songs of Emptiness*,
Wondrous echoes fill the empty chambers.
Unbinding my natural heart,
Perfecting my kalpas of accumulated merit.
Long whistling above the Nine Darks,
Clear gaze beholds the empty same.
Dragons sing beyond the abodes,
Phoenixes cry in the Grand Empyrean’s halls.
Void hymns leave no lingering taste,
Mournful sounds ride the wind and scatter.
Who can fathom these verses?
Reciting the Primordial Numinous Hymns with precision
Dissolves the Nine Yin’s transgressions,
Delivers from the Seven Darks’ trials.

The Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Cavern’s Dark Mystery* arises with the Origin’s co-emergence. Since the numinous writ exists, the host of Perfected approach the seat, burn incense, pay homage to the scripture, and circumambulate while reciting these twenty-one chapters to celebrate in the divine court. The jade sounds ring clear, piercing the nine heavens. Their phrases are subtle and profound, wondrous essence branching in all directions. Reciting them once awakens the myriad spirits. Constant study and practice unite one with the Emperor in truth, dissolve the heavy burdens of past transgressions, deliver the Seven Darks from the hidden palace, release the Five Sufferings from sorrowful souls, and enable the self to ascend to heaven. Wondrous and subtle indeed—this numinous writ!

Here ends *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Cavern’s Dark Mystery, Great and Profound*.

The character "脐" was originally written as "齐," amended here according to context.
