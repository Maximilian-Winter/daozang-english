### *The Supreme Clarity Cavern-Real Heavenly Treasure Great Cavern Three Radiance Precious Register*, Scroll One

#### **The Most High Lord Emperor’s Golden Tiger Talisman Register**
**Jade Clarity Rank, First Grade**

On the day of [X] in the month of [X] in the year of [X] of the Great Era, [X] of [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] village, [male/female disciple], named [X], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month at the [X] hour, now presents offerings and sincerity to the Master of the Three Caverns, [X], to receive *The Most High Lord Emperor’s Golden Tiger Talisman Register*. After receiving and wearing it, one must uphold and cultivate it in accordance with the precepts, never lightly disclosing or defiling its sacred writ. Should one violate this, they shall bear divine punishment, unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas. If cultivated in accordance with the Dao, one shall attain immortality in both life and death, as bound by the covenant and statutes.

The **True Talisman of the Golden Tiger and Jade Essence of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity** is the innate golden scripture of the Supreme Primordial’s Upper Radiance. It commands golden immortals, seals mountains, summons spirits, overawes the Six Heavens, and annihilates the myriad demons. The Most High ever deploys the Four Numinous Beasts, the Six Jia Spirits, and seven hundred thousand attendants to guard this talisman within the Jade Palace of the Great Tenuity. Those who wear this talisman shall wield authority over Heaven and Earth, rebuke the host of spirits, command radiant dragons, and hold office among the exalted immortals. Once its jade resonance is activated, jade blossoms shall attend at one’s side, golden perfected ones shall guard as soldiers, a thousand demons shall lose their courage, ten thousand ghosts shall vanish in form, the Nine Demons shall bow their heads, the Six Heavens shall crumble, the Dao’s wonders shall reach the ultimate truth, and the spirits shall gather the Five Numinous Powers. To the left, the Dark Lad shall howl; to the right, the Golden Dawn shall be subdued. How great is this precious writ, the true majesty of the Supreme Emperor! It is not merely for dispelling poisons, repelling trials, and extinguishing demons—it is the mark of attaining the wondrous ranks of immortality and realizing the true Dao.

Twenty-seven **Jade Maidens of the Script** shall attend and protect the body of the one who upholds the scriptures. Those who revere the talisman and honor the precepts shall ascend to the Three Clarities’ Palaces. Should one violate or profane it, or transmit it to the unworthy, their body shall enter the winds and fires, unredeemed for eternal kalpas.

The talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on white silk and worn upon the head. Additionally, a belt of orpiment and azure is tied at the right side of the waist. All is in accordance with the covenant and statutes of the Most High.

All talismans within this scroll are inscribed in cinnabar.

The **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance Golden Elixir True Talisman** holds inner invocations of awe-inspiring spirit, summoning divine soldiers to sever and extinguish wayward souls. One must enter the chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Whether sitting or lying, recite the invocation:

*"Expel the Qian Toxin King! Raise the fluttering banner of Luo! The Eight Immortals grasp their halberds! The Five Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor! The Supreme Mystery descends in radiance! The Seven Mornings guard the courtyard! The Yellow Perfected shines with talismanic brilliance! Flames and bells cast forth! Divine tigers brandish their might! Poisoned blades clash in chaos! The purple majesty of the script unfurls! The Four Quaking Ones roar to the heavens! The Four Heavens stand towering! Know the names of ghosts, and the outer realm shall tread in the mysterious qi! Guard within with the master’s soldiers! Left, wield awe; right, turn to survey! Wind strikes, fire conquers! Shout and sever ten thousand demons! Crush and behead a thousand spirits! The Golden Perfected rouses its might! The Nine Demons submit their forms! The Northern Feng crumbles and falls! All that is destroyed shall be overthrown!"*

*"I wear the true talisman and command the ten thousand spirits. The Three Primes report to the true, the mysterious aligns with the Emperor’s sincerity. The Supreme Micro Emperor ascends to the Three Clarities."*

The method of the **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance’s** awe-inspiring inner invocation belongs to the esoteric scriptures of the **Highest Clarity**. The *"Qian Toxin King"* is the hidden name of the great demon within the Six Heavens. The *"fluttering banner of Luo"* is the concealed title of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor. The *"towering Four Heavens"* are the soul-names of the ghostly ministers of the Northern Feng. One who knows the names of these three ghosts shall cause a thousand demons to flee without trace, ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms, the Nine Demons to be powerless to test, and a hundred evils to be unable to inflict harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits of palaces and temples, one may proceed with confidence, without need to burn incense or enter the chamber. If fasting and entering the chamber, or at the morning and evening audiences of the Eight Primes, to subdue demons, summon spirits, and command divine perfected ones, one may wear the talisman and proceed.

The **Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Talisman**
The **Lord of the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor** addressed the **Upper Minister Azure Youth** and the **Queen Mother of the Western Citadel**, saying: *"The* **Highest Clarity Wisdom Scripture for Dispelling Demons** *is the jade tablet of the Supreme Ultimate, the true formula of the Most High. The* **Divine Tiger True Talisman** *is the treasured chapter of the Great Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens. Wisdom can dispel filth, dispelling demons can restrain evil, and the true talisman can subdue demons and extinguish demons. Those who possess jade tablets with purple names and cultivate the supreme method shall not be assailed by the myriad demons or tested by the ten thousand demons. This may be called: no harm can intrude upon the divine might of the Divine Tiger, the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now I entrust this to you, to transmit to later students who are destined to become true persons. Follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected Ones: within seven hundred years, permit three transmissions. Do not show it to the unworthy, nor carelessly reveal the true scripture, lest one incur the punishment of the wind-blade."*

*"Those who delight in the true Dao, diligently focus their minds on the mysterious, do not begrudge wealth, and value the method above material goods—such is the Dao that abides within. Only to such persons may this be spoken. Those who inwardly covet treasures and outwardly indulge in frivolous desires—the Dao, though already illuminated, shall be sealed within a jade coffer, locked with a golden gate. After ascending and attaining transcendence, it shall be concealed within a famous mountain."*

The **Jade Capital of the Supreme Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Golden Clouds’ Awe-Inspiring Jade Invocation**, the **Supreme Prime Scripture of the Supreme Divine Tiger Talisman**.

The **large characters of the Divine Tiger** and the **invocation for wielding spirits** are stored by the Supreme Lord in the chamber of the **Primordial Beginning**, not transmitted to the world. Only those who are **supreme perfected ones** may behold them. According to the statutes of the **Supreme Ultimate’s esoteric methods**, on the day of ascension, one may transmit it to a single person; beyond that time, it may not be revealed again. The rites of transmission follow the preceding method.

Furthermore, when transmitting the scripture, the disciple shall hand-copy one copy for the master. After one hundred days, the master shall cast it into the eastern flowing waters, ensuring no one sees. This scripture is called *"Transcending the Human Dao"* and is a solemn covenant with the Three Officials.

---

**Oral Formula and Invocation Method for the Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Great Talisman**
When receiving the oral formula of the **Supreme Lord’s Jade Spirit Divine Tiger Great Talisman**, after completing the covenant and reception, the disciple shall cross their hands and draw a single line to present to the master. One hundred days after receiving the scripture, the master shall purify themselves for three days. The text drawn by the disciple, along with the covenant oaths and invocations, shall be sealed with an iron seal and cast into the deep waters of the Eastern Sea. Then, facing the heavens, recite the invocation:

*"Supreme true talisman, Jade Spirit Divine Tiger! The receiver’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, erasing punishments and trials. They shall surely attain perfection and disperse all sorrows and sufferings. Do not divulge this! Ten thousand ages pass in an instant. Solemnly covenant with the Water Official, swiftly swear to the Earth Deity."*

After the invocation, return directly without looking back. This is called *"completing the covenant."* It is the beginning of having one’s name recorded in the register of the **Upper Official of the Three Officials**.

If, after receiving it, one does not act accordingly, they shall never be permitted to wear the **Divine Tiger Scripture** nor have their name inscribed in the **Highest Clarity**. After three years, their body shall perish, and they shall endure the long trials of the Water Official.

After the solemn covenant, on the **wu-shen** day of the **fourth month of each season**, use cinnabar to draw the talisman on white silk, making it three feet and two inches in length. Write the characters *"white king"* (bai wang), strike the teeth seven times, and recite the invocation:

*"The spirit of the Supreme Divine Tiger gathers qi into the purple script, containing the radiance of jade essence. Its might subdues fierce demons, restrains the ten thousand spirits. Divine youths attend and guard, Jade Maidens support the form. I wear this scripture and command golden soldiers, becoming a king of immortals, flying and ascending to the Highest Clarity."*

After reciting, strike the teeth seven more times and swallow saliva three times. On that day, use a **purple damask pouch** and a **white brocade pouch** to contain it and wear it on the body.

According to the statutes of the **Four Poles**, this talisman is weighty and may not be exposed to the world of mortals. Only those who already possess an **immortal name and jade tablet** may hear and see it. On the day of receiving the talisman, always inscribe it in cinnabar on white silk, rolling it to a size of one’s choosing and placing it in the pouch. If it has not been soiled or defiled, it may be worn on the body. In all matters, maintain secrecy, do not mix it with other scriptures, nor reveal its title.

Beware, for this is forbidden by the Great Ultimate—take heed! The primordial celestial talisman, the divine *qi*, the essence and radiance of the Most Supreme, coalesces into the **Seven-Headed Spirit Tiger of Vital *Qi***, ever attendant to guard the body, subdue and extinguish demonic forces, and dispel misfortune. The tiger’s retinue must never speak to others, saying, “I possess a celestial talisman,” nor disclose the title of this scripture. Should one speak to one person, one tiger departs; to two, two tigers leave; to three, three depart—until all seven tigers have gone, and the body is left without its guardian hosts. Then, malevolent spirits, demonic ghosts, the **Three Officials**, and the **Northern Emperor** will all come to test and assail. If one has not yet attained immortality, keep this deeply secret. By the statutes of the **Four Pacts**, take utmost care—take heed, take heed!

**Sponsor, Supervisor, Preceptor, and the Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity**—Second Rank of the Jade Clarity Department.

On the day of [year], in the reign of [Tai Sui], the [month] and [day], [hour], [so-and-so] of [prefecture, commandery, county, village], male/female, named [personal name], aged [years], born on the [month, day, hour], now presents offerings and tokens to the **Master of the Three Caverns**, [so-and-so], to request and receive the *Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity*. I vow to uphold and cultivate it without敢轻泄 or exposing its true text. Should I once violate these statutes, I shall bear the consequences of divine judgment, unforgiven for ten thousand kalpas. If received and maintained according to the proper method, I shall attain immortality in both life and death—all in accordance with the covenant and its decrees.

The **Most High Lord of the Great Dao** states: The Void and Perpetuity are the *hun* and *po* of Heaven and Earth, the majestic brilliance of *yin* and *yang*. The Void is the essence and spirit of the Nine Heavens, while Perpetuity is the numinous soul of the Nine Earths. The two *qi* converge at the center of the Dipper, forming the great deity of the Supreme Emperor, whose radiance aids and illuminates the cosmos. They regard the assisting deities as their gaze, dispatching the celestial light to survey all directions, recording the constellations of Heaven, revolving the Five Constants, summoning and gathering transformations, hastening the mechanisms of the divine. When Heaven is at peace and Earth is prosperous, the Void and Perpetuity remain concealed; when Heaven is in turmoil and Earth is disturbed, they shine forth in clarity. Fortune and misfortune, omens and warnings—all are instantly reported. They transform the myriad *qi*, alter *yin* and *yang*, and govern the succession of the four seasons—none occurs without their agency. The two stars are most revered, hidden within the splendor of dawn. Those who behold them gain boundless longevity; those who cultivate their Way ascend to the Highest Clarity. Only those whose names are inscribed in the **Jade Register of the Mysterious Chart** may lawfully behold this text. Practitioners shall perform this ritual seven times a month. On the days of the **Six Ding** and the **Eight Festivals**, one may enter the chamber, burn incense, and arrange the diagram and mat to the left and right. Facing south, strike the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars entering the five palaces of the viscera, their light penetrating the entire body until warmth is felt. Next, meditate upon the **Royal Ladies of the Five Stars** and the **Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity**, recalling their names, taboo names, and attire according to their respective directions. When all is complete, recite the secret invocation:

*"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—governing the Four Origins,
Mysterious clarity flows and reflects, illuminating the Five Gates.
Within reside the Spirit Lords of the Five Stars and their Ladies,
The Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity, Most Exalted,
Transforming their forms and radiance, uniting ten thousand divisions.
Descend into the Five Viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals,
Refining my seven *po*, nurturing my three *hun*,
Lifting my form to ascend, soaring into the Dipper’s Gate,
Roaming the Upper Capital, the Five Stars in assembly.
Today, I invoke this mysterious blessing—grant what I have recited."*

Afterward, draw in the light of the Five Stars and swallow twenty-five times. Then take seven steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Venus**. Hold the breath for seven breaths, facing west, and recite:

*"The Seven Gates of the West, white *qi* flying in radiance,
Above dwells the Luminous Emperor of Lesser *Yin*, the August Brilliance,
Whose taboo name is ‘Metal’s Supreme Essence,’
Clad in feathered robes, resplendent hues flowing,
Glowing bright in the Golden Palace,
Called the Five Luminaries, the lineage of the Void and Perpetuity.
Bearing talismans and wielding staffs, they summon *yin* and command *yang*,
Transforming water and fire across seventy-four directions.
Grant me the power to soar in flight, concealing my radiance in the Void,
Riding the white chariot, roaming the cloud chambers,
To enjoy eternal years, boundless and infinite."*

After reciting, swallow seven breaths while looking upward. Then take twelve steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Saturn**. Hold the breath for twelve breaths, facing southwest, and recite:

*"The Four *Qi* of the Central August, overseeing the Eight Numinous,
Within the Jade Terrace and Purple Chamber, divine luminaries transform and arise.
There dwells the Primordial August One, the Five Constants’ hidden name,
Who daily treads the Gate of Perpetuity, pacifying the Yellow Court.
Clad in robes of flying clouds, crowned with the essence of splendor,
Holding talismans and wielding staffs, adorned with fiery bells,
Grant me the power to soar in flight, reveal my divine name,
Descend into my spleen and viscera, pacify my spirit and essence,
Ascend to Heaven and enter the clouds, conceal my radiance and transform my form,
Hide and alter the myriad things, roam the Jade Clarity,
To dwell with the August Lord, together guarding the Great Brilliance."*

After reciting, swallow twelve breaths while looking upward. Then take three steps, stand upon the **Star of Mars**, face south, hold the breath for three breaths, and recite:

*"The Three Gates ablaze with radiance, cinnabar light flowing in essence,
Mysterious *qi* surging, glowing bright in the Southern Abyss.
Above dwells the Crimson August One, the luminous spirit of the Five Emperors,
Whose taboo name is ‘Wandering Radiance,’
Clad in brocade and patterned essence,
Crowned with a treasure diadem, girded with jade bells,
Moving in and out of the Vermilion Palace, the Purple Chamber and Crimson Walls.
Record and protect my life, inscribe my birth in the Southern Palace,
Grant me the power to soar in flight, transform my *qi* and conceal my form.
On auspicious days, practice the Way—may all under Heaven be purified.
My heart-spirit coalesces into truth, my five *hun* shine with clarity,
Aligned with the Three *Qi*, merging with the radiance of the Fire Star."*

After reciting, swallow three breaths while looking upward. Then take nine steps, stand upon the **Star of Jupiter**, face east, hold the breath for nine breaths, and recite:

*"The Nine *Qi* of the East, the Jade Gate of the Azure Heavens,
Within dwells the Azure Dawn, the Lord of the Mysterious Supreme,
Whose flowing essence surges—this is the celestial *hun*.
Whose taboo name is ‘Great Brightness,’ exalted above Heaven and Earth,
Clad in phoenix robes and striped tiger skirts,
Transforming into Five Luminaries, shifting forms across the Nine Capitals.
Crowned with the essence of azure, wearing the Jade Diadem of the Heavens,
Bearing golden talismans and feathered staffs, tinkling bells in abundance,
Holding the Hidden Script, soaring in flight with feathered texts.
Record my life, guard my Liver Gate,
Externally radiant, internally luminous—my liver stores the immortal.
Welcome my ascent, to ascend and pay homage to the Imperial Dawn."*

Upon completion, draw in the starlight and swallow nine times to conclude.

Next, take five steps onto the Wood Star, face north, hold the breath for five cycles, and recite:

*"The Five *Qi* of the North, the Mysterious Gate of the Profound,
The Northern Asterism flows in radiance, the Supreme Jade Clarity of the *Kui* Constellation,
Within dwells the Grand Sovereign, the Five Emperors’ exalted names,
Whose taboo name is ‘Primal Yin Elixir,’
Clad in robes of darkest azure, crowned with the Jade Diadem,
Girded with belts of tinkling bells,
Bearing golden talismans and jade staffs, jade pendants gleaming bright,
Wandering the resplendent dawn, gazing beside the Eight Obscurities,
Descending in revolving streams to enter my Kidney Court,
Preserving and recording the Five Spirits, my viscera flourishing in brilliance,
Internally and externally replete, transforming my radiance and altering my form,
My bones take flight, my flesh ascends—
I ascend to the Jade Clarity."*

Upon completion, draw in the starlight and swallow five times to conclude.

After pacing the Five Stars, retreat seven steps from the Water Star, ascend to the Metal Star, stand with feet together, and recite the first of the Nine Constants:

Conceal my steps for me, that I may escape my form."*

Upon completion of the Five Constants’ invocations, return to the Metal Star, hold the breath for seven cycles, and recite:

*"Soaring through the Great Obscurity, transforming radiance into Five Constants,
Entering the Five *Qi* of the North, subduing the Three Yangs of the South,
Golden talismans command the spirits, the Supreme Emperor lends his aid,
The Six *Wu* escape the Six *Ji*, preserving passage through the Cavern Realms,
The Great White guards the lungs, metal stabilizes the stomach and intestines,
Internally replete, externally overflowing, form and *hun* take flight together,
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—wherever my will directs,
I attain union with the Jade Emperor, roaming the Supreme Radiance."*

Upon completion, draw in the *qi* and swallow seven times to conclude.

Transform the *qi* of the Seven Metals, whose might subdues the Three Luminaries,
My body divides into forms, ascending to heaven and entering the clouds,
Summoning the Five Spirits in unison to guard my Spleen Gate,
That my viscera may swiftly transform into immortality,
Soaring through the Constants into the void, traversing water and fire across the myriad origins,
Wherever my will directs, ascending without barrier,
I attain union with the Jade Consort, befriending the host of immortals."*

Upon completion, draw in the *qi* and swallow twelve times to conclude.

Next, from the Earth Star, take three steps to ascend the Fire Star, stand with feet together, and recite the first of the Void Constants:

Upon completion, ascend to the second, the River Constant, and recite:

The Five Constants interpenetrate and transform, the myriad changes shrouded in obscurity,
Seizing the life-record of the Jade Emperor, whose might subdues the Northern Essence,
The Upper Register of Immortals preserves my longevity,
Today I pace the void, riding emptiness to enter the stars,
The Sparkling Deluder aids my heart, my Dao shines in unison,

Wherever I turn, dividing my form into a hundred thousand,
Ascending to the Sentence Array, rising to Jade Capital,
My body sprouting wondrous fur, my Kidney Palace receiving fragrance,
Today in practicing the Dao, I follow the ancestral lineage of immortals,
Attaining the celestial vow, enjoying boundless blessings."*

Upon completion, swallow the five qi and cease.

The twenty-five cycles of pacing the Void Constants conclude.

Next, take nine steps, swallow qi five times, ascend the first star of the Northern Dipper, join the feet, and ascend Yang Brightness, facing east to recite:

*"Supreme Central Palace, concealing and escaping the primordial,
The Great Goddess of the Inner Consort, the Most Honored of the Great One,
Governing the essence of destiny, bestowing immortality upon me,
Hiding my form and escaping my self, ascending to the Imperial Chariot."*

Upon completion, ascend the second star, facing northeast to recite:

*"Within the Central Origin Palace, preserving the embryo and transforming form,
The Great Perfected of the Inner Concubine, the Most Exalted and Mysterious Numen,
Severing the placenta and untying knots, refining the embryo and securing essence,
Transforming in myriad ways, granting me long life."*

Upon completion, ascend the Star of Assistance, facing the Perfected to recite:

*"Within the Palace of True Origin, the six evasions and seven concealments,
The Primordial Mother of the Upper Origin, nurturing my embryonic birth,
Concealing transformations in the Golden Chamber, shifting to ride the Azure Chariot,
Grant that I fly through the void, enjoying limitless years."*

Upon completion, ascend the fourth star, facing north to recite:

*"Within the Palace of the Turning Dark, concealing radiance and hiding light,
The Inner Consort of the Central Origin, ancestral lineage of divine immortals,
Delivering me through the Six Wù, releasing me to the Eight Directions,
Escaping traces and pacing in flight, ascending beyond the Imperial Chamber."*

Upon completion, ascend the fifth star, facing west to recite:

*"Within the Palace of the Guiding Spirit, transforming the body and altering radiance,
The Great Woman within the Dipper, mysterious transformations without form,
Delivering me through the Primordial Dipper, inscribing my name in the Chamber Window,
Flying through the void and spurring emptiness, ascending beyond the Imperial Chamber."*

Upon completion, ascend the sixth star, facing northeast to recite:

*"Within the Palace of the Recorded Bright, concealing traces and dispersing images,
The Middle Woman within the Dipper, numinous transformations of the Upper Palace,
Striking my name from the mysterious register, delivering it to all directions,
Dividing my body into a thousand, reverting my form to youth."*

Upon completion, ascend the seventh star, facing northwest to recite:

*"Within the Palace of Convergence and Union, dividing radiance into myriad forms,
The Youngest Woman within the Dipper, the Great Numen of the Mysterious Above,
Following the Dipper’s turning mechanism, governing the revolutions of the myriad lives,
Grant that I fly through the void, transforming in the Great Obscurity."*

Upon completion, ascend the Star of Assistance, face the Heavenly Gate, and knock the teeth nine times, reciting:

*"Imperial Measure of the Upper Palace, the Lady of the Left August,
Facing the Imperial Lord, aligning radiance and uniting with the true,
Named the Void Constant, transforming the Nine Heavens,
Guiding and conducting the sun and moon, gathering qi to form mist,
Revolving water and fire, myriad transformations within the body,
At this moment, the primal auspice unfolds,
Grant that I pace in flight, ever riding and entering the true,
The Nine Celestial Bodies flowing and descending, enjoying blessings by the myriad thousands,
My form equaling heaven and earth, my lifespan matching the divine tree."*

Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the twenty-four qi, then cease.

Next, ascend above the Star of Assistance and stand facing the Earthly Gate.

The Star of Assistance resides within the third star of the Dipper, at the Dipper’s mouth, serving as the abode of the Perfected One of Assistance and the star of Hidden Primordiality. When pacing the nine steps of the Dipper, one must avoid the Perfected One’s star and never tread upon it—always crossing from the second star to the fourth. In this Void Constant method, however, one does not pace the Perfected One’s star but only the stars of Assistance and Support. After completing the steps of the Star of Assistance, return to the Star of Support, pace it while reciting the invocation, and the circuit of the Void Constant Dao will be complete. The invocation reads:

*"Supreme Venerable of the Upper Palace, the Lady of the Right August,
In union with the Imperial Lord, merging with the radiant Flower Chamber,
Heavenly soul and earthly spirit, named the Supreme Void,
Transforming the nine qi, ancestral origin of the myriad Perfected,
Revolving metal and turning stone, equaling heaven in merit,
Dissolving mountains and rivers, commanding clouds and dragons,
Myriad marvels respond instantly, dividing light into countless streams,
Pacing in flight through the void, radiance flowing and surging,
Concealing the body within the Dipper’s seat, cloaked in celestial light,
Ever transcending heaven and earth, enjoying boundless blessings,
May all wishes be fulfilled, and lifespan know no end."*

Upon completion, knock the teeth and swallow qi thirty-six times, and the Void Constant Dao is complete. Practicing this for seven years will allow one to divide the form into nine voids; after fourteen years, one may soar through the Great Void. Careful and precise visualization is essential, as detailed in the scripture. Write the characters in cinnabar on white silk, store them in a brocade pouch, and wear it on the head during pacing. When ascending the stars, one must also visualize and invoke these three characters.

**Method for Pacing the Stars in Sequence**
Facing the Bright Yang of the Great Dipper, proceed forward. When the right foot treads upon the Celestial Pass, advance the left foot to join it, regulate the breath, and softly recite:

*"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—
the five phases propel one another,
the seven stars gleam resplendent,
the celestial net wields supreme might.
The Star of Assistance governs flourishing,
the Star of Support repels decline.
The Nine Perfected and Supreme Ones,
the Great Ultimate and Radiant Tenuity,
the Three Palaces and Jade Emperors,
the Three Venerables ward off calamity.
Heaven turns, earth revolves,
soul and spirit follow in unison.
Grant that I ascend as a flying immortal,
true light lingering and circling,
my name inscribed in the Golden Chamber,
the Jade Pass now open.
Riding the dragon to ascend the void,
sun and moon shine together,
roaming the Upper Clarity,
jingling bells and emerald robes,
seizing lightning on the left,
commanding thunder on the right.
All earthly evils,
prostrate and dead, dare not pursue.
If wicked intent turns toward me,
may it be severed and crushed.
By imperial decree, Jade Maidens
attend and escort me home.
Soul, spirit, and body united,
ascend and soar as one."*

**Method for Retrograde Pacing**
Stand at the Celestial Pass, face the North Pole, hold the breath and clench the fists. When the right foot treads upon the Yin Essence, the left foot steps before the Bright Yang, then the right foot joins the left. Turn right toward the Celestial Pivot and softly recite:

*"The Celestial Dipper’s true yang,
the Dipper’s motion rises and falls.
Advancing, the primordial mechanism turns;
retreating, the numinous net stirs.
Subdue the spirit to bring tranquility,
restrain the soul to ensure well-being.
Soul, spirit, and body
together ascend to the celestial halls.
Facing the Golden Gate,
the Supreme August One on high,
the Immortal Mother on the left,
the Immortal Lord on the right,
purple and emerald flying blossoms,
dragon robes and tiger garments,
adorned with the true sash and jade,
a halo crowning the head,
holding divine bells in hand,
golden pendants at the waist,
chanting the *Dongzhen* scriptures,
the sevenfold wondrous verses.
First born from emptiness and nothingness,
then becoming an immortal king,
soaring through the nine paths,
grasping the Dipper and climbing the net.
Advancing with the Great One,
retreating with the Mysterious Lord,
receiving the oral transmission,
sitting in death and standing in oblivion.
The essential retrograde method
elevates one to the rank of immortal minister.
The five viscera regenerate,
welcoming one another of their own accord.
All wishes are fulfilled,
all pursuits prosper.
Myriad evils and countless harms
hide away in distant lands."*

**Method for Reverse Pacing**
Again hold the breath, circle three times outside the Dipper’s stars, beginning at the Bright Yang to pace the soul. Turn right at the Bright Yang, step with the left foot onto the Celestial Pivot, then join with the right foot. Hold the breath and clench the fists, step with the left foot onto the Jade Light, the right foot onto the Gate of Yang, then both feet proceed in reverse to the Bright Yang. Turn the body to face the Mysterious Darkness, place the right hand over the heart, and point with the left hand toward the Mysterious Darkness. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth twenty-one times, and swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Recite:

*"Intestine Brightness and purple qi,
the Primordial Simplicity and mysterious stars,
the Golden Pass and Yellow Chamber—
within dwells the Great Spirit,
left hand supporting the Supreme August One,
right hand grasping the Lofty Perfected,
dragon mouth holding emerald robes,
flying brocade with tiger patterns,
jade talismans at the waist,
lotus crown upon the head.
Emerging from nothingness, entering the void,
golden perfection and jade radiance,
the numinous and venerable one,
named Intestine Brightness,
feet treading crimson mist,
mouth chanting the *Dongzhang* scriptures.
Bestowing upon me the hidden texts,
teaching the pacing of the celestial net,
circling thrice in repetition,
grasping the Dipper and forgetting breath.
Grant that I ascend as a flying immortal,
soaring through the void,
my name inscribed in the Upper Clarity,
riding the dark dragon’s chariot.
Whatever the mind knows,
whatever the heart desires,
all shall be fulfilled.
The Three Venerables unite in virtue,
soul and spirit commune within,
arriving at the divine palace,
Jade Maidens and Jade Lads attend."*

**Method for Grasping the Dipper’s Handle**
Step with both feet onto the Yin Essence star, place the left hand over the heart, and point with the right hand toward the Perfected One’s star. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Softly recite:

*"Yin Essence, mysterious and plain,
the Flowery Gate within the radiant palace—
within dwells the Jade Emperor,
the North Pole’s Supreme Venerable,
phoenix-embroidered collar,
dragon-emerald skirt,
tiger bells at the waist,
red mushroom crown upon the head,
named Yin Essence,
the Supreme One’s Lord.
Bestowing upon me the hidden texts,
teaching the pacing of the seven origins,
grasping the Dipper’s handle to ascend,
roaming the numinous passes.
Externally restraining the seven spirits,
internally governing the three souls.
Refining the spirit to shed worldly burdens,
treasuring the soul as the womb’s spirit.
Soul and spirit guard the body,
ascending as immortals together.
Soaring through the Upper Clarity,
returning qi to rejuvenate the countenance.
All intentions fulfilled,
ten thousand desires without difficulty."*

**Method for Receiving the Perfected**
Step with both feet onto the Star of Support, the left foot first, without following its celestial net. Turn the body to face the Perfected One’s star, visualize and bow. Kneel with knees flanking the Star of Support, hands over the heart. Hold the breath for four breaths, knock the teeth four times, and swallow saliva four times. Recite the incantation: *"Though the feet stand on the right Support, the visualized incantation resides at the Perfected One’s star."*

The Nine Stars of the Great Ultimate,
Supreme Clarity’s luminous perfected ones,
hold the balance of the true mechanism,
exhaling and inhaling purple mist.
Golden radiance and jade brilliance
cast majestic light across the ten heavens,
commanding and guiding the Three Luminaries,
harmonizing yang and regulating yin.
They govern the primordial and bestow qi,
renewing the old with transformative governance.
Above, they rule the Central Constellations;
profound is the mystery of the Mysterious Pass.
Golden chambers and jade portals,
the northern gate’s fourfold convenience—
emerging to ride the Eight Effulgences,
floating through the Celestial Origin.
Dragon-brocade and phoenix robes,
tiger-jade skirts in flight,
crimson essence and emerald sashes,
purple plumes with sevenfold edges.
At the waist, divine talismans girdle;
on the head, a lotus crown rests.
Above, they perch in the Nine Voids;
below, they soar through the Eight Abysses.
Self-styled as the Jade Sovereign,
the Supreme Perfected of the Nine Heavens,
they pity my devotion to the Dao,
bestowing upon me the Hidden Scriptures.
I personally ascend the Star of Support,
paying homage to the Numinous Lord,
entreating the cinnabar writ
to precede my birth.
Thus I govern the Three Heavens,
soaring through the Eight Mysteries.
The five viscera regenerate spontaneously,
ascending as a flying immortal of the highest rank.
I become the Jade Emperor’s winged attendant,
a minister to the sages yet to come,
my rank exalted as Grand Master.
Riding clouds and flying chariots,
all wishes are fulfilled,
and no malevolent forces may intrude.

**Method for Treading the Dipper**

Both feet ascend together to the Star of Dark Mystery. Standing upon the Star of Support, the right hand rests upon the heart while the left hand points to the Star of Cinnabar Origin. Hold the breath for three cycles, strike the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Visualize the Star of Dark Mystery beneath the feet, then recite the incantation:

*"Divine radiance of the Grotto-Heaven,
Concealed within Dark Mystery’s return,
Qi fills the Great Void,
Coming and going without form.
Hidden in heaven, buried in earth,
Permeating all without birth—
Suddenly ascending the Celestial Net,
Stepping upward to the Purple Court,
Gazing north to the Cloud Chambers,
Turning south toward the Thunder Citadel.
Dazzled by ten thousand transformations,
No longer the former shape.
In fleeting visions of streaming light,
Touching it, it instantly takes form.
Should it come seeking to conceal itself,
Know my name:
From emptiness, deliverance from peril,
Ninefold mystery of the Perfected.
Sitting or rising with the Six Jia,
Audience granted by the Six Ding.
Bestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,
To tread the Dipper and traverse the stars.
Looking up, I behold the Supreme Sovereign,
Clad in crimson and azure,
Holding the numinous radiance in hand,
Jade bells girded at the waist.
Above, I entreat flight as an immortal,
Born together with heaven.
My name inscribed in the Supreme Subtlety,
Floating through the Highest Clarity.
Below, I entreat transformation,
Concealing my luminous form in the register.
All affairs as I wish,
All obstacles leveled."*

**Method for Treading the Constellation’s Path**
Both feet ascend together to the Star of Cinnabar Origin, the left foot first, then the right foot joining. The left hand rests upon the heart while the right hand points to the North Star. Hold the breath for three cycles, strike the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Then recite the prayer:

*"Supreme Nine Terraces,
Cinnabar Origin’s mysterious path,
Externally governing the North Star,
Internally rectifying Heaven’s principle.
Golden towers gleam without,
Jade courts radiate within.
At their center dwells the Most Honored,
Named the Crimson Child,
Who rules within the Cinnabar Origin,
In the crimson chamber.
Embroidered clouds of jade,
Dragon mantle and tiger robe.
In the right hand, the Jade Register;
In the left, the Dipper’s guiding cord.
Feet tread upon luminous clouds,
Head crowned in purple.
To the right, flowing bells;
To the left, jade pendants.
Bestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,
To tread the path and wander the stars.
Above, I entreat flight as an immortal,
Riding the dark dragon’s chariot.
My name inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace,
The Jade Hall of the Supreme Ultimate.
Wherever I turn, wherever I seek,
Fortune and prosperity come to meet me."*

**End.**
**Method for Treading the Celestial Net**

**Method for Treading the Celestial Net (Continued)**

Both feet ascend together to the North Star. The left foot leads, the right follows. With the right hand resting upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva thrice. Recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Mystery of the Great Tenuity,
Purple Canopy of the North Star,
Beneath lies the Great Perfected,
Soaring boundlessly beyond.
Jade skirts in flight,
Golden bells and azure sashes,
A girdle of radiant jade,
Mystic numina in misty array—
Bestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,
That I may ascend the Seven Qi,
Mount the clear and distant mists,
Meet with the Perfected,
And entreat flight as an immortal.
Inscribe my name in the Cinnabar Chamber.
Wherever I turn, wherever I seek,
No calamity, no harm shall befall me."*

**End.**

**Method for Mounting the Dragon**
Both feet ascend together to the Celestial Pivot Star. The left leads, the right follows, moving along the Net’s outer path. With the right hand resting upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva thrice. Recite the incantation:

*"Supreme North Star,
Purple Tenuity beyond the stars,
Precious Mystery of the Golden Chamber,
Without lies the Jade Gate.
Revolving through the Nine Palaces,
Harmonizing the Celestial Pivot—
Within dwells the Honored Divinity,
Named the Purple Sovereign.
Grant me the Hidden Scriptures,
That I may ride the dragon,
Ascend the Nine Heavens,
Descend to the Earth’s Origin.
A chariot of luminous clouds,
A robe of dark splendor and jade hues,
A dragon-whip at the waist,
A tiger-patterned headscarf.
Embracing the myriad beings,
Instructing the flying immortals—
Release me from the name of death,
That I may endure with heaven and earth.
Mounting the dragon, treading the Dipper,
Wherever I turn, grace shall attend me."*

**End.**

Still holding the breath, visualize the dragon-chariot with its crimson canopy descending from heaven to welcome you. In a trance of ascent, forget the body for a long while, then turn to ascend the Auxiliary Star. Roam the Three Realms. Both feet ascend together to the Auxiliary Star, turning left. The left foot leads, following the Net around the North Star to tread upon the Auxiliary Star, the right foot joining after. Face the North Star, both hands resting upon the heart. Hold the breath for one cycle, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva once. Lift the head to gaze upon the star and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Ultimate’s Auxiliary Star,
Essence dwelling in the Purple Pass,
Nurturing life, fostering destiny,
Precious guardian of spirit and soul.
The Golden Chamber opens again,
That I may behold the Auxiliary Star.
Bestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,
That I may wander and revolve.
Inscribe my name among the Sage Emperors,
A flying immortal of the Nine Heavens.
A radiant headscarf, a girdle of truth,
Entering and exiting the Grotto Gate."*

**End.**

Within the Auxiliary Star, bow to the Dao Lord. In a trance, forget the body for a long while, then turn to ascend the Aligning Star. Wander the Three Yangs, then proceed to the Aligning Star. Both feet ascend together, the left foot leading, passing directly by each star until floating above the Aligning Star in the void. The right foot joins. Face the Perfected Star, both hands resting upon the heart. Hold the breath for one cycle, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva once. Recite the incantation:

*"Great Void’s Mud-Pill Palace,
Purple Palace’s Heavenly Honored,
Mystic Void’s True Pivot,
Foremost of the Emperor—
In the Dao, the Jade Sovereign;
In the body, the Mud-Pill.
Swift as a sudden inspiration,
Qi pierces the Three Origins.
Essence enters the Hall of Light,
Strengthening the womb, enriching the soul.
The Crimson Mountain opens again,
That I may behold the Numinous Origin.
Gather the sun’s splendor on the left,
Pluck the moon’s root on the right.
Flaming fire streams ten thousand leagues,
A golden net and azure skirt.
A tiger-tally at the waist,
A flowered crown upon the head.
Bestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,
That I may traverse the Celestial Pivot.
Entreat flight as an immortal,
Commanding the myriad spirits.
Wherever I turn, all shall converge,
Virtue and fortune like mountains."*

**End.**

Abide within the Aligning Star in the heavens, bowing to the Jade Sovereign and entreating swift ascent as a flying immortal.

**On the Day of Audience with the Pole**
If it coincides with the day of audience with the Pole, descend to pay homage to the Dipper. In descending, turn left. The right foot ascends to the Celestial Pivot, then proceed leftward to tread the Three Terraces and Five Stars.

**Days of Audience with the Pole**
For treading the Net and stepping the Path, always use these days, including the first day of each *jiazi* cycle and the Eight Nodal Days:
- Spring: First day of the first month, twentieth day of the second month, twenty-seventh day of the third month.
- Summer: Eighth day of the fourth month, fifth day of the fifth month, eighteenth day of the sixth month.
- Autumn: Seventh day of the seventh month, twentieth day of the eighth month, ninth day of the ninth month.
- Winter: Fifth day of the tenth month, third day of the eleventh month, sixth day of the twelfth month.

For all practices of flying steps, treading the Net, and traversing the stars, use these days, following the preceding methods.

After fourteen years of practice, the essence of the Seven Stars descends and transforms into divine beings, all riding the Flowing Bells and Eight Radiant Cinnabar-Speckled Clouds to attend you. They bow to you as an immortal official, and you ascend in broad daylight upon a flying dragon.
- In one year, you avert misfortune and calamity.
- In two years, you avert warfare.
- In three years, you avert death.
- In four years, you become an Earth Immortal. A thousand harms and ten thousand evils—none dare encroach.
From this point onward, blessings and fortune shall be boundless, summoning divine spirits to harness and ride the flying dragon. The Supreme Ultimate bestows the magic mushroom; the Jade Emperor provides attendants.

After twenty-eight years of practice, you become a Perfected of the Highest Clarity. Thus preserved and exalted.

**Supervisor of Transmission, Transmission Master, and the Supreme Two Radiant Three Flying Registers**
*Third Rank of the Jade Clarity Department*

On the day of [disciple’s name], styled [Daoist name], in the year of [Tai Sui year], the [month] and [day], born in [prefecture], [commandery], [county], [village], [male/female], [personal name], aged [years], born on the [month], [day], and [hour], now presents offerings and tokens of faith to the Three Caverns Master, [Master’s name], to receive the *Supreme Two Radiant Three Flying Registers*.

Follow the divine canon of the Flying Radiance, adhering to its precepts and disciplines. Practice diligently from dawn to dusk, and do not transmit this to the unworthy. Should one grow negligent or careless, or lightly disclose its secrets, the recipient shall bear karmic retribution in the unseen realms. All is bound by the oath of the Four Poles and the true statutes of the covenant.

For those cultivating the Way of the Three Radiant Ones, first purify through a hundred-day retreat—or fifty days at minimum—severing all worldly affairs before entering seclusion. After completing the retreat, maintain purity throughout the year, not merely during the seclusion period. If, during practice, prolonged interruptions occur, perform another fifty-day retreat before resuming. For minor lapses, a five-day retreat suffices.

**Method for Flying to the Sun**
At midday, the Crimson Qi of the Supreme August True Lord, whose taboo name is *Jiangche Liang* and style *Gaoqianshuang*, presides. Though the scripture does not record specific methods for venerating this exalted and secret office, it states that those who know shall not die. At the outset of practice, hold this knowledge in the heart, but do not invoke the name lightly. The method for the moon follows the same principle.

**Names and Titles of the Five Thearchs:**
- **Azure Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in azure-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring azure blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Dawn Lotus of Kingfisher Plumes*.
- **Vermilion Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in crimson-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring cinnabar blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Vermilion Hollow Brilliance*.
- **White Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in white-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring white blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Luminous Jade Lotus of Purity*.
- **Black Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in black-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring black blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Mystic Mountain Lotus*.
- **Yellow Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in yellow-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring yellow blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Purple Lotus of Divine Radiance*.

Memorize the forms and vestments of the Five Thearchs. During practice, visualize each Thearch’s crown and attire as described. Each morning, face the rising sun and bow twice. First, don proper robes, prepare the incense burner, rinse the mouth, and hold the scripture’s characters upon the tongue, their heads turned inward. Sit upright and wait for the sun’s full radiance to appear. Kneel, offer incense, and silently invoke the taboo name and style of the Supreme August Lord, pressing both hands to the heart in reverence. After bowing, close the eyes, hold the breath for ten cycles, sit squarely facing the sun, clasp the thumbs into fists, tilt the face toward the sun, and hold for ten breaths. Then, swallow the sunlight ten times, imagining its rays entering the mouth and being ingested. Visualize the sun’s crimson qi, its purple rays with nine beams, and silently intone: *"Nine Spirits of Luminous Brilliance, Nine Rays of Flowering Radiance, descend and infuse my face."* Slightly part the lips, gently inhale, and swallow ten times. Hold the breath and envision the radiance within the abdomen, ascending to the *Mud Pill* and descending to the viscera, illuminating the body inside and out. Sustain this vision until the practice concludes, ensuring the light does not dissipate.

Afterward, softly intone—only loud enough for your own ears to hear:
*"Within the sun dwells the Azure Thearch, Round and Eternal, styled Dragon Veil."*

First, visualize the Five Thearchs seated within the sun, arrayed according to the five directions. Focus on the Azure Thearch, silently invoking his name, and he shall respond. Proceed likewise for the other Thearchs.
- **Vermilion Thearch:** *Danling Zhi*, styled *Verdant Crimson Glow*.
- **White Thearch:** *Haoyu Jiang*, styled *Returning Golden Mist*.
- **Black Thearch:** *Chengcao Chun*, styled *Mystic Verdant Flame*.
- **Yellow Thearch:** *Shouyi Fu*, styled *Whirlwind Radiance*.

Next, invoke:
*"First, visualize the Moon Spirit as a round orb, golden in hue, slightly smaller than the sun, nestled within the sun’s qi. Do not fixate on its form; simply sense its divine presence responding within."*
*"Moon Spirit, Essence of Radiance, Warm and Serene Terrace."*

Then, silently recite:
*"May I, with the Five Thearchs and the Moon Spirit, together ride the radiant clouds and ascend to the Sun Palace."*

Close the eyes and visualize:
- The Azure Thearch emerging from the sunlight to stand at your left,
- The Vermilion Thearch at your right,
- The White Thearch behind you,
- The Black Thearch above your left hand,
- The Yellow Thearch above your right hand.

Silently invoke each Thearch’s taboo name and style, summoning all five. Visualize their vestments and colors vividly. Once all are present, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:
*"Crimson Crucible, Cinnabar Radiance, Round Flower of Nine Brilliances,
Great Splendor awakens the spirit, blazing with vermilion essence.
Five Thearchs initiate the dawn, illuminating the myriad lives.
Gaze upon the Perfected of the Highest Clarity—emptiness and harmony prevail.
Circulate the qi, refine the elixir, coursing through the five forms.
May my spirit transform, my six palaces flourish and fill.
Ride the crimson clouds, ascend the Nine Chariots of Yang,
Soaring to the Sun Palace to merge with the Thearch’s spirit."*

Next, visualize the crimson cloud chariot of *Yang Sui*, drawn by nine vermilion dragons, arriving from the sunlight before you. Board it with the Five Thearchs and ascend to the sun.

After one year of practice, you shall perceive their likenesses; after two, their forms shall appear; after three, they shall descend; after four, your visage shall gleam with jade-like radiance, and you shall attain luminous clarity. In five years, you shall achieve Perfection. In eleven years, you shall ride a cloud chariot with a feathered canopy, drawn by a host of dragons, ascending to the Sun Palace to receive the scriptures and be named an *Upper Clarity Perfected*. You shall be attended by twenty-six jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens.

**Method for Flying to the Moon**

**Method for Flying to the Moon**

In fasting seclusion, visualize as in the solar method. Within the moon’s yellow *qi* resides the Divine Mother of the Supreme Thearch, whose taboo name is *Yaodao You* and whose style is *Yuhui Tiao*. The Lady of the Azure Thearch appears as an infant, clad in a shimmering azure-jade brocade mantle and a skirt of soaring phoenixes woven in kingfisher plumes. Her hair is bound in a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, the rest cascading to her waist—all the Ladies share this coiffure.

The Lady of the Vermilion Thearch wears a cinnabar-jade brocade mantle and a crimson phoenix-embroidered skirt of flying feathers. The Lady of the White Thearch dons a white-jade brocade mantle with four-dragon motifs and a plain-feathered skirt adorned with simurgh patterns. The Lady of the Black Thearch is robed in a black-jade brocade mantle with nine-cloud designs and a black-feathered skirt of dragon motifs. The Lady of the Yellow Thearch wears a yellow-cloud mountain-patterned brocade mantle and a green-feathered skirt embroidered with phoenixes.

The forms and attire of these Five Ladies must be memorized beforehand. In cultivation, visualize their appearances as in the solar method. Each evening, face the rising moon and bow twice in its direction. On the second or third day after the new moon, when the moon first appears as the sun sets, begin the practice. As the moon ascends, wait until the sunlight fully fades and the moonlight grows bright before proceeding. During the dark of the moon, when its form is absent, no visualization is possible.

If the moon is not visible indoors, go to the courtyard or beneath the eaves; in rain, remain inside. First, don your cap and robes, prepare an incense burner, rinse your mouth, and place the scripture’s text upon your tongue, its characters facing inward. Offer incense to the moon, kneel lengthwise, and visualize the style of the Divine Mother of the Supreme Thearch. Press your hands to your heart and bow. After bowing, close your eyes, hold your breath for nine cycles, and sit upright facing the moon, hands resting on your knees. Hold the scripture in your right hand, clench your left fist, and tilt your face toward the moon. After nine breaths, swallow the moonlight nine times. Visualize the moonlight entering your mouth, then imagine the moon’s yellow *qi* and white radiance, its eight dark rays. Silently invoke: *"Lunar essence, night’s essence—eight rays descend upon my face."* Slightly part your lips, gently inhale, and swallow nine times. Then, holding your breath, envision the radiance within your abdomen ascending to the *Niwan* and descending to the viscera, illuminating your form and penetrating within and without. Sustain this brilliance until the practice concludes, allowing no dissipation. When finished, softly exhale so that only your ears perceive the sound.

The Lady of the Azure Thearch is named *Eyin Zhu*, styled *Fenyan Ying*. First, visualize the Five Thearch Ladies seated within the moon according to the five directions, forming a circular image. Focus your mind on the Lady of the Azure Thearch and call her, then visualize her responding. The other Ladies follow likewise.

The Lady of the Vermilion Thearch is named *Yiyi Liao*, styled *Wanyan Xu*. The Lady of the White Thearch is named *Lingsu Lan*, styled *Yulian Hua*. The Lady of the Black Thearch is named *Jielian Qiao*, styled *Chunshu Jin*. The Lady of the Yellow Thearch is named *Qingying Jin*, styled *Jionding Rong*.

Next, invoke: First visualize the solar essence as a vermilion, apotropaic square within the moon’s *qi*, equal in size to the moon. Do not fixate on its form—simply sense its numinous presence responding. *"Solar essence, spirit—vermilion youth of pearlescent radiance."*

Conclude with a silent prayer: *"May I, without uttering a sound, ascend with the Five Thearch Ladies and the solar essence-spirit, riding flying clouds to the Lunar Palace."*

Close your eyes and visualize the Lady of the Azure Thearch descending from the moonlight to your left, the Lady of the Vermilion Thearch to your right, the Lady of the White Thearch behind you, the Lady of the Black Thearch at your left hand, and the Lady of the Yellow Thearch at your right hand. Each holds a text in her hands, facing you. Silently call their taboo names and styles, summoning the Five Thearch Ladies, and visualize their attire and colors distinctly. Then, envision all five Ladies in their respective positions simultaneously. Strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite:

*"Yellow essence unfurls its splendor,
Primal Yin’s inner chapter,
Mirroring the Great Mystery,
Opening the myriad realms.
Scattering the misty cold winds,
Seven dawns of dark jade,
Revolving Yin’s triple convergence,
Heaven and Earth exhale light.
Cloud mantles of dense silk,
Jade pendants and girdle ornaments,
Silken veils of refined cloth,
Nurturing the Wood Thearch.
Purple radiance emerges,
Floating blossoms in nine voids,
Circular brightness bestows hues,
Six *qi* transform and flow.
Five Thearch Ladies,
Treading clouds, grasping winds,
Feathered skirts brushing the heavens,
Wafting through the eastern void,
Soaring trees unfurling dawn,
Canopies of refined Peng,
Roots spanning ten thousand leagues,
Shading the five bodies.
Soul harmonized, spirit transformed,
Six mysteries fill the clouds.
Returning from age to infancy,
Jade infants revert to youth.
Timely riding the sinking mist,
Ten dragons draw flying clouds,
Ascending to the Lunar Palace,
Entrusted with safeguarding weight."*

Conclude. Visualize the solar essence riding the moonlight before your face, nine inches away, sensing its numinous presence within. Then, envision a chariot of flowing bells and flying clouds, drawn by ten yellow dragons, arriving from the moonlight before you. Board it with the Five Ladies and ascend to the moon.

After one year of practice, you shall perceive their semblances; after two, their forms shall appear; after three, they shall descend; after four, you shall attain luminous clarity, your body emanating flowing light. In five years, you shall achieve Perfection. In eleven years, you shall ride a chariot of dark reins and radiant splendor, ascending to the Lunar Palace to be named an *Upper Clarity Perfected*. You shall be attended by twenty-six jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens.

**Method for Flying to the Stars**
Wood governs spring...

Fire governs summer; Metal, autumn; Water, winter. All follow the calendar: the onset of their reign begins at midnight preceding each of the four *li* days, each lasting seventy-two days. Earth governs the eighteen days preceding each solstice and equinox, its reign commencing at midnight before these *fen* and *zhi* days.

When the stars are visible, you may go to the courtyard, sitting or standing as you please, to observe the five stars converging. At the appointed time for practice, go to the courtyard—sitting is preferable to standing. On the altar in the courtyard, face the star, spread a mat, arrange the ritual table, burn incense, and bow in reverence. Then sit upright to proceed. If the stars are not visible on cloudy nights, you may perform the practice within your chamber by visualization.

The stars need not be in their cardinal directions; practice facing wherever they appear. For instance, Wood may be in the west. Each night, absorb the essence of all five stars, ensuring completeness, but prioritize the star governing the current month. If you are a secluded Daoist in retreat, you may also perform this within your chamber, visualizing the true script of the five stars and practicing toward them. If unversed in astrological calculations and unaware of the stars’ positions, or if you maintain long-term seclusion and fasting, you may always practice within your chamber, facing the cardinal directions of the five stars’ original positions.

When swallowing the radiance of the stars, visualize the Supreme Sovereign and the Lady of the Supreme Sovereign riding within the star’s light, entering your mouth as you swallow. With eyes closed, faintly perceive their forms.

**Method for Flying to the Wood Star**
The Wood Star is the round mirror of Wood’s essence, the darkly radiant Eastern Yang’s terrace. Within the star are nine gates, each emitting nine rays of light, each ray stretching nine million *zhang*. Within each gate resides a Green Emperor. Visualize the star as vast and perfectly round, ninety *li* in diameter, evenly surrounded by nine gates. The Emperor wears the attire of the Green Emperor and is titled the Duke of Azure Numinosity.

Regularly observe the Jupiter star. Burn incense, focus your mind, and gaze at the star, calling: *"Green Emperor Sovereign."* Then visualize the Azure Terrace Sovereign and his Lady within the star.

On the days when the Five Stars ascend to audience with the Supreme Hidden Writ of the Highest Sovereign, the celestial essence unfolds in radiance, and the assembly of the Upper Perfected gathers in auspicious celebration.

The thirty-six Heavenly Emperors of the Thousand Perfected descend to roam the Grand Clarity, and all flying immortals above gather in celebration at the Supreme Ultimate’s Upper Palace.

Further, the diligence or negligence of those seeking the Perfected in the world shall be recorded, and the jade names of the learners of the Perfected inscribed upon the Golden Portal and fixed in the Elixir Registers.

These days of the Five Convergences are auspicious gatherings for the dissolution of sins and the eradication of transgressions. For on these days, the Five Perfected ascend to audience—this is called the *Five Convergences*, wherein distant matters reach the ear and the finest details are illuminated.

The **Great Clarity’s Mysterious Elder of the Nine Heavens** expounded the **Primordial Void Cavern True Writ**, the **Jade Emperor** upon the **Vermilion Radiance and Kingfisher-Jade Capital of Mount Hua in the Jade Metropolis**, within the grotto-chamber. At that time, forty million billion **Jade Lads** and ninety million billion **Jade Maidens** spread yellow gold upon the earth and fashioned a couch of white jade. The **Heavenly Worthy** descended, with a mat of yellow gold, while all the **Perfected Immortals and Divine Kings** knelt in reverence and inquired of the **Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens**:

We have heard that the **Supreme Lords and Sages**, the **Great Emperor’s Mysterious Hymn**, the **Jade Emperor’s Radiant Splendor**, the **Cinnabar Blossoms and Verdant Kingfishers**, the **Phoenix-riding and Dragon-drawn chariots**, come to welcome the **August Thearch of Eastern Florescence**, joining in the chanting of the **Nine Shao Harmonious Spirit-Chants**. The **Cavern Mystery** engraved its writ upon stone, to elucidate the **Nine Heavens’ Register of the Upper Scripture of Mount Gui**, harmonizing with the **Jade Maidens of the Nine Heavens’ Grotto-Chambers**.

The **True Kings** commanded the **Demon-Spirit Banners**, the **Thirty-Two Heavens’ Moon-Holders and Sun-Bearers**, to course clouds and send down rain, moistening the world below. A hundred fruits sprouted in unison; jade trees bore emerald branches, green leaves, and cinnabar blossoms. Fragrant gardens and fruit groves flourished with the **Seven Treasures and Three Luminaries**. The **Supreme Heavenly Worthies** and **Upper Clarity Jade Lads**, the **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens**, the **Nalina Jade Chambers**, transformed and enlightened the multitudes—**ministers, emperors, kings, and lords of states**, the **Han Controller of Registers**, the **officials of the ten directions**, the **Perfected Immortals and Great Sages**, the **Hundred Spirits and Demon Kings**—soaring through the void, covering heaven and earth. **Jade Cloud Chariots**, drawn by **one thousand two hundred Mysterious Dragons**, with thunder, lightning, and thunderclaps, illuminated the ten directions as they descended into my chamber. All knelt in worship and chanted praises.

The **fragrant flowers of the heavens**, the **hundred pipes in unison**, the **chiming of jade and ringing of bells**, the **natural chimes and stone chimes**, the **heavenly musicians**, the **Three Lights of the Seven Treasures**, the **hundred harmonies**—all resounded in joyous celebration.

The **Nine Demons of Heaven** and the **Wayward Spirits of the Heavenly Emperor** attended at the side, with **flying cloud feather-canopies**, **twelve silk banners**, **signal flags, drums, and standards**, arrayed before the Emperor. The **Heavens joined in chanting**, all praising and reciting together. The **Twelve Heavenly Worthies** and the **Perfected Officials of the Hosts of Immortals** each intoned the **Jade Sound Treasure Writ of the Cavern Mystery**.

**Three Primordial Verses**
The swift canopy of the whirling wind,
Ten Sages follow the Worthy in roaming.
Cloud writs harmonize with gods and demons,
The purple chariot floats upon luminous qi.
The Heavenly Worthies of the Great Clarity,
Halt their carriages at the Jade Capital’s peaks.
The host of immortals plays heavenly music,
A hundred sounds naturally resound.
Together they dance in the cloud blossoms,
The joy of the Perfected—who can fathom?
The Seven Treasures’ Jade Grove,
Chanting praises, we share the same vessel.
The cinnabar radiance shines with solar essence,
Making my heart hesitate in awe.
The immortals recite the Emperor’s verses—
This joy is beyond all reckoning.
The heavens chant pure tones,
Soaring faintly upon flying clouds.
The host of Sages sings the cloud hymn,
The Jade Maidens chant the Mysterious Joy.
Together they wander in the Queen Mother’s chamber,
Lingering in the jade hall’s contemplation.
The Perfected of jade radiant substance,
Resplendent in brilliance and splendor.
The Jade Pool rinses in clear streams,
The Kunlun’s treasure grove gleams.
Soaring, the host of dragons flies,
The purple cloud altar gleams bright.
At dusk they wander Mount Penglai’s peaks,
At dawn they face the radiant Kunlun.
The immortals bind cinnabar leaves,
Their flowing radiance entrusted to written script.

The **Nine Elders of the Upper Clarity’s Natural Cavern Mystery** dispatched the **Flying Cinnabar Radiance**, the **Nine Elders and Supreme Lords**, responding to the **Spirit-Summons**. On the seventh day of the first month in the **Primordial Sovereign’s First Jia Year**, within the **Chamber of the Seven Treasures’ Jade Grove of the Chaos Terrace**, the **Three Primordial Jade Emperors** commanded the **Primordial Heaven’s Writ** to be transmitted to the **Nine Crimson True Lords**.

From the *Upper Registers of the Primordial Tortoise Mountain*, the Fifth Rank of the Jade Clarity Department:

On the day of [day] in the month of [month] in the year of [year] of the [X] cycle, [name], a native of [prefecture], [commandery], [county], [village], [male/female], aged [age], born on the [day] of [month] at the [hour], now presents offerings and tokens of faith to Master [name], Preceptor of the Three Caverns, to receive the *Great Register of the Middle Grade of the Upper Primordial Tortoise Mountain*. After donning and wearing it, they swear to uphold and cultivate its teachings, never violating its true writs nor carelessly divulging or neglecting them. Should any transgression occur, the recipient of the register shall endure eternal censure and punishment, bearing no grievance against the Dao nor faulting their master—all in accordance with the statutes of the covenant and the ordinances of the law.

This talisman, worn for nine years, requires closing the eyes in meditative visualization: each day and night, one shall behold the celestial immortals of the Nine Heavens, riding dragons and phoenixes, soaring through the Purple Void to ascend the Jade Court. Body and spirit shall unite with the perfected, never again mingling with mortals nor lingering in the world. Returning from the west, turning toward the east, the self shall escape the torment of the Five Pains of hell, and their name shall surely be exalted in posterity. Let this be heeded with utmost care.

The above talismans are all inscribed in vermilion.
**Endorsement and Protection.**

The August Primordial First of the Orthodox Unity, Emperor-King of the Great Dao of the Nine Heavens, the self-so luminous, the script carved upon Mount Taihua’s stone. The twenty-four immortal officials of the cavern-chambers of Mount Tortoise—among them the Upper Prime Lord, styled the Envoy of Mount Tortoise—and the twenty-four jade maidens and immortal youths, the perfected immortals of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis of the Supreme, issued from the Purple Phoenix Vermilion Script of the Most High.

This true script was sealed within the jade chamber of the Yellow Emperor at the center of the Five Marchmounts. On the seventh day of the seventh month in the year of Jiaxu, it was revealed upon Phoenix Mountain at the Terrace of Chaos, emerging from the Golden Portal and Jade Gate, bestowed upon the Supreme August Lady of the Purple Tenuity, who was commanded to transmit it to those of later generations destined for immortality. Whoever holds this script shall surely ascend in broad daylight upon the clouds, becoming a companion to the host of immortals, and upon beholding the Most High, shall be appointed as a Lord of the Upper Immortals. This is received in accordance with the statutes of the Mysterious Law and the true ordinances.
