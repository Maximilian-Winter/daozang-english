The *Esoteric Writ of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern in the Jade Purity of Highest Clarity*:
The Celestial King of Primordial Beginning fasted for a thousand days in the Palace of Jade Purity, where he proclaimed the covenant to the Ten Heavens—soundless and formless, shapeless and nameless, without origin or lineage, the boundless and numinous Nine Mysteries of the Jade Purity of the Great Cavern, existing naturally through countless kalpas.

The Dao conferred the *Scripture of the Three Luminaries and Three Primes of the Great Cavern in Jade Purity, Written in Gold and Tiger-Phoenix Script*. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens were entrusted to transmit it to later disciples. Those whose names are recorded among the immortals shall correspond to the Perfected of Jade Purity. Their names are fixed in the Golden Repository of the Mystic Terrace, their rites inscribed upon jade tablets. They shall reverently welcome the true numina, soaring through the Jade Purity, gazing upward to the numinous of the Great Cavern. Naturally reborn, they shall attend and guard the Highest Perfected, verify names in the immortal registers, subdue demons, and command spirits, descending to the Golden Terrace in cloud chariots drawn by jade steeds.

On the [day] of the [month] in the year of [Tai Sui], [name and style], a native of [prefecture, commandery, county, village], [male/female, personal name], aged [number] years, born on the [day] of the [month] at the [hour], having from youth renounced worldly attachments and devotedly received the Mystic Writ, diligently cultivating morning and night without cease, now humbly prepares incense and offerings, pledging faith with cinnabar in mouth, and approaches the gate of the Three Caverns Master, the Venerable [name], to request the transmission of *The Esoteric Writ of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern in the Jade Purity of Highest Clarity*.

Respectfully following the instructions of the former master, [the disciple] fasts and makes covenant. Now, bearing the token of faith, [the disciple] approaches the Three Caverns Master, [name], upon the altar, making supplication above to the Ten Thousand Spirits and below to the Five Marchmounts, the Three Rivers, and the Nine Springs—all to be witnessed.

Should this disciple, after receiving the transmission, violate the covenant or betray the trust, may the seven generations of ancestors, parents, and the disciple’s own person endure the trials of the attending officials, tread the Mountain of Knives, swallow fire and consume coals, suffer the Twenty-Four Hells, the Three Disciplines and Five Torments, for ten thousand kalpas without respite.

Only by invoking the transmission and descending the true numina, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the divine officers and generals, shall the disciple’s person be protected, sins expunged from the registers, and their name inscribed in the Jade Calendar of the Nine Heavens’ immortal roster. They shall attain long vision and eternal life, while their seven generations of ancestors and parents shall be born in the Heavenly Halls and swiftly ascend to transcendence.

May the imperial destiny flourish, the Nine Ancestral Temples ascend to Perfection—all in accordance with the covenant text and the statutes of the Celestial Offices.

In accordance with the method, initiate and bestow the peerless *Hidden Writ Secret Formulae of Jade Clarity*, vowing to cultivate diligently to attain the immortal realm, roaming the Jade Clarity Palace of Ultimate Bliss. One thousand two hundred perfected immortals, immortal officials, jade lads and jade maidens, clerks, soldiers, generals, valiants, and envoys—ten thousand myriad billions—shall attend and protect the recipient’s person, swiftly achieving ascension and deliverance. Nine generations of ancestors and parents shall be born into the celestial halls. Above, this aids the imperial throne, flourishing the celestial longevity; the Nine Temples ascend to perfection, the Nine Darks are all released, the long night receives deliverance, and evil roots are extinguished. The Three Wretched Realms are likewise severed. Should one personally violate or betray this, midway collapse and ruin shall follow; nine generations of ancestors shall sink into perdition, the body shall forsake the Three Luminaries, and none may blame the Dao or fault the master—all as decreed by the alliance text and statutes.
