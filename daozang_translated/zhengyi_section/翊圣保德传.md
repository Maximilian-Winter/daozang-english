**Scroll One of The Hagiography of the Protector of Virtue and Upholder of Sageliness**
Compiled by Wang Qinruo, Duke of Taiyuan, Grand Preceptor with Equal Standing to the Three Excellencies, Joint Manager of Affairs of the Secretariat-Chancellery, and Pillar of State, under imperial command.

**The Perfected Lord, Protector of Virtue and Upholder of Sageliness.**
At the beginning of the Jianlong era, Zhang Shouzhen, a commoner from Zhengwu County in Fengxiang Prefecture, was traveling in the Zhongnan Mountains when he suddenly heard a voice calling him from the void, its tone clear and resonant. Startled, Shouzhen looked around but saw nothing. He walked cautiously, straining to listen, and after several *li*, heard the voice again: "If you go first, I shall follow behind." This continued for days, leaving Shouzhen perplexed.

Upon returning home, he heard a voice in his chamber say: "I descend by imperial mandate to manifest my numen. Why are you so obstinate, refusing to heed my words? Were it not for the great affairs of the Song Dynasty, I would have already reduced you to dust." Shouzhen, both astonished and fearful, asked: "I do not know which stellar deity has deigned to descend. My nature is foolish and dull; I pray the divine one will not overbear me, and I shall surely serve without fail."

The voice replied: "I am the Great Sagely Minister of the Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven, sent to ride the dragon and descend into the world. Only a man of uprightness can serve me. I see that you possess an extraordinary bone structure, unlike the common folk. You must reverently follow my teachings." Shouzhen said: "I have heard that among men it is called *wu*, and among women *xian*. Though I dwell in the realm of the ordinary, I am ashamed to be counted among such."

The voice declared: "I am a celestial deity, not some ghost or specter. The Five Peaks and Four Waterways are under my command. If you turn your heart to the Dao and diligently offer incense and fire, I shall cause you to answer the summons of a great nation and receive the favor of a true sovereign. How could I be the same as those *wu* and *xian*?" Shouzhen replied: "Since the divine one instructs me thus, how dare I not serve with reverence?" He then prepared wine and meat as offerings.

The voice spoke again: "I am a divine being. Why do you defile me with such foul offerings? As you are ignorant, I shall not punish you. Henceforth, offer only fragrant tea, vegetarian fare, and fresh fruit. Though I do not consume them, your intent is what matters." Shouzhen bowed deeply in apology.

The voice continued: "I am your celestial master. You shall also have a master in the human realm. Seek a lofty scholar to receive ordination." Shouzhen then paid homage to Master Liang Quan of the Ancient Louguan Abbey as his teacher and was ordained as a Daoist priest. He selected a vacant plot beside his home, spent his family’s wealth, and constructed the Palace of the Northern Emperor, erecting a hall within to serve the deity. Morning and night, he made offerings with utmost devotion.

The deity said to him: "Seeing your sincerity and adherence to my teachings, you are a man of integrity, capable of dispelling evil. First, I shall teach you the sword method, that you may expel demons for the people. Later, I shall instruct you in altar rites, that you may pray for the nation’s blessings." Shouzhen bowed twice and replied: "I am but a humble and foolish man, yet by some karmic fortune, I have now found refuge. With utmost devotion, I shall forever uphold the altar rituals and sword methods, awaiting your divine instructions."

The Perfected Lord said: "There are three sword methods. Use copper, iron, or steel to forge a sharp blade, and with a single glance from me, it shall be ready. For those afflicted by illness, have them wield it, and the pathogenic *qi* shall be dissolved without harm to the person. If earth deities cause calamity, aquatic creatures spawn demons, or the celestial regions bring disaster, troubling the state, employ the *upper sword* to remedy it. For mountain and marsh specters, or fierce flying and crawling creatures that terrorize the realm and poison the people, use the *middle sword*. For *chimei* and *kuilei* spirits that cling to evil, harming beings and bringing misfortune, use the *lower sword*."

Shouzhen said: "I have received your teaching on the three swords. I await instruction on the altar rites." The Perfected Lord replied: "There are nine altar methods. The upper three are established for the state:

1. **The Altar of Following Heaven and Prospering the Nation** – For a grand universal offering, arraying 3,600 stellar positions. Banners, mirrors, swords, bows, arrows, and ritual implements are arranged in order, with gates opened and protocols observed.
2. **The Altar of Extending Blessings and Preserving Life** – For a celestial offering, arraying 2,400 stellar positions. Ritual implements and protocols are one rank lower than the upper altar.
3. **The Altar of Praying for Harvests and Timely Blessings** – For a universal net offering, arraying 1,200 stellar positions. Ritual implements and protocols are one rank lower than the middle altar.

If time does not permit for these three altars, one must still prepare pure and elegant prayers, rare flowers and fruits, strike the drum to summon the deities, and offer earnest supplications. Burning incense nine *chi* above the ground to present petitions may also evoke a response.

The middle three altars are established for officials:

1. **The Yellow Register Altar of Extending Longevity** – Arraying 640 stellar positions.
2. **The Yellow Register Altar of Attaining Felicity** – Arraying 490 stellar positions.
3. **The Yellow Register Altar of Dispelling Evil** – Arraying 360 stellar positions.

The ritual implements and protocols for these three altars differ in rank.

The lower three altars are established for scholars and commoners:

1. **The Altar of Continuing Life** – Arraying 240 stellar positions.
2. **The Altar of Gathering Blessings** – Arraying 120 stellar positions.
3. **The Altar of Averting Disaster** – Arraying 81 stellar positions.

The protocols for these altars vary according to rank.

Beyond these nine altars, there is also the **Altar for Responding to Circumstances**, which may array 64, 49, or 24 positions. The required ritual implements differ accordingly."

The scholar-gentry and common folk may undertake these rites according to their means. For instance, when commoners pray for the emperor’s protection, they should establish the **Altar of Praying for Grain and Felicity**, arraying 1,200 stellar positions. When beseeching blessings or averting disaster for parents or teachers, they may set up an offering altar, adjusting the scale as appropriate.

Guardian Perfected received these teachings through reverent prostration, and thereafter, many verifications arose, though they cannot all be recorded. During the *Qiande* era, when Emperor Taizong was still the Prince of Jin, he had heard of the numinous responses and dispatched a trusted attendant with treasures, silk, incense, and candles to the palace to perform the offering. The messenger, having purified himself and burned incense, declared: “The Prince of Jin has long admired the divine marvels and wishes to present offerings and expand the halls. He also petitions for an official name to be bestowed.” The Perfected Sovereign replied: “In the future, when the era of the Peaceful Ruler arrives—the second sovereign of the Song—he shall build the **Supreme Clarity Palace of Great Peace**, erecting twelve grand halls. The stars of the Three Realms have their appointed times; this cannot be lightly discussed. Simply inform the Prince that this palace’s construction has already been decreed by Heaven, with a fixed year and month—though the time is not yet ripe.” The messenger returned and reported this to Taizong, who was astonished and ceased his inquiries.

Emperor Taizu had also heard of these matters but remained skeptical. He sent an envoy bearing incense, candles, and a written prayer to the palace to perform the rite. Later, he summoned Guardian Perfected to court to question him in detail. Guardian Perfected recounted everything, adding: “Without utmost sincerity, the gods will not descend.” He further reported the recent descent of the Supreme Sage in full. Taizu summoned a young eunuch to whistle mockingly nearby and said to Guardian Perfected: “Are the words of gods and men truly like this?” Guardian Perfected replied: “If Your Majesty deems my words deceptive, I beg to be examined and executed in the marketplace, lest such speech profane the Supreme Sage.” Taizu ordered Guardian Perfected to remain at the **Jianlong Abbey**. The next day, he dispatched the eunuch Wang Jien to perform the offering. After some time with no response, Jien bowed again in earnest prayer. Soon after, the Perfected Sovereign descended and declared: “I am the High Heavenly Great Sage, Minister to the Jade Emperor, sent by decree to guard the Song’s altars and secure its enduring foundation—not some mountain sprite or forest demon. Yet you send a whistling boy to compare my words? This is unacceptable. Simply tell the sovereign that the celestial palaces are already completed, their jade gates aglow. The Prince of Jin possesses a benevolent heart.” (He repeated, “The Prince of Jin possesses a benevolent heart,” and spoke over a hundred more words.) Jien, trembling with fear, dared not conceal anything and recorded it all before reporting to Taizu. He also recounted the clarity of the divine voice, which left all who heard it in awe. Taizu fell silent, struck with wonder. This occurred on the evening of the nineteenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year of *Kaibao*.

The following day, Taizu passed away, and Taizong ascended the throne. Soon after, he summoned Guardian Perfected to the **Qionglin Park** to perform the **Grand Offering of the Celestial Circuit**, establishing the **Altar of Prolonging Fortune and Preserving Life**. After the rite, the Perfected Sovereign descended and spoke to the eunuch Wang Jien: “I have words for you to relay to the emperor.” He said:

> In the first year of *Jianlong*, by imperial decree,
> I descended on dragon-back to guard the lord of men.
> Sweeping away demons was but a trifling task;
> I set the cosmos aright and established the firmament.
> The nation’s fortune has risen, and peace reigns long;
> The people rejoice in their labors, preserving their celestial nature.
> The eight directions offer tribute and bow in submission;
> Myriad spirits tremble and prostrate themselves as subjects.
> When the imperial kinsmen celebrate longevity, they must burn incense and pray,
> Passing down reverence and purity toward ruler and kin.
> I command a swift legion of one million,
> And countless divine officials in the billions.
> Those who act with loyalty and filial piety shall receive my blessings;
> Those who act with rebellion shall surely be punished.
> Rewards and punishments shall be meted out with perfect equity,
> So that Heaven remains unstained and Earth free of dust.
> Loving the people and governing the state surpasses all previous ages;
> The foundation of ten thousand years shall forever renew.

Jien recorded these words on bamboo slips and reported them to Taizong the next day. Upon reading them, Taizong was astonished and bowed in gratitude, saying: “This is the fortune of our house and the blessing of our ancestral temples. We humbly receive the Supreme Sage’s edifying words.” He ordered the text sealed and stored in the inner palace.

Soon after, he dispatched the Palace Attendant Wang Shoujie and the Recorder of the Imperial Presence Wang Guicong to build a palace at the foot of Mount Zhongnan. As they were selecting the site at Zhongnan’s town, the Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and spoke to Guicong and the others: “This is the place to build the palace of the Supreme Emperor. It cannot be changed.” Thus, the site was fixed. After three years, the palace was completed. At its central axis stood four grand halls: the **Hall of the Jade Emperor’s Luminous Passage** at the front, followed by the **Purple Tenuity Hall**, the **Seven Primes Hall**, and the **Hall of the Perfected Sovereign’s Presence**. To the east of the main halls were the **Four Halls of Heavenly Penetrating, the Nine Luminaries, the Eastern Dipper, and the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**. To the west were the **Four Halls of Perfected Warrior, the Twelve Celestial Stems, the Western Dipper, and the Heavenly Ministries**. Additionally, there were the **Hall of the Divine Officials**, the **Dragon Hall**, the **Pavilion of the Southern Dipper**, and images of all the stellar deities. Two towers for hanging bells and scriptures were erected, along with halls for fasting and Daoist chambers—all fully equipped. A stele was erected to record the events, inscribed with the name **Supreme Clarity Palace of Great Peace**, exactly as the Perfected Sovereign had foretold. Taizong appointed a regular court official to oversee the palace and selected Daoist priests to conduct the rites. Every year, during the Three Primes, the emperor’s birthday, and the day of his celestial destiny, envoys were sent to perform offerings. On the evenings of the rites, the emperor would gaze toward the palace and bow in reverence. In times of flood or drought, or when the state was about to undertake major affairs, urgent prayers were offered there.

When the palace was first completed, the Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and addressed Wang Guicong and the others: “You have diligently carried out the imperial decree in building this palace. Yet why have you not opened the **Gate of Sun and Moon Splendor**? Why have you left the walls of the eight minor halls unpainted and the steps, walls, and Sanskrit inscriptions incomplete? You sought only hasty completion to curry favor. However, Heaven will neither conceal your merit nor absolve your fault.” Shoujie and Guicong were deeply alarmed, but as the project had already been reported complete, no further additions could be made. They could only bow in apology and depart. Upon returning to court, both were promoted in rank and rewarded with a thousand taels of silver.

Soon after, Shoujie fell ill and died, while Guicong perished by the sword. Thus was the warning made clear: Heaven neither conceals merit nor absolves fault.

At the beginning of the Taiping Xingguo era, Emperor Taizong personally led the campaign against Taiyuan. The Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and addressed Shouzhen, saying: “The Emperor has already arrived at Fen and Jin. Before long, the city will be retaken. You must instruct the supervising officials to prepare a grand offering to give thanks to the Supreme Emperor for this victory.” Shouzhen and the others replied: “This concerns the great affairs of state. We beg to wait for news of victory.” The Perfected Sovereign said: “Heaven has already determined the outcome of victory and defeat.” Within ten days, the imperial army reported triumph. The supervising officials informed the Emperor, who dispatched the eunuch Lu Wenshou with treasures from the inner treasury—incense, medicinal herbs, imperial calligraphy, and liturgical texts—to the palace, where a grand offering was held to give thanks to the Supreme Emperor.

That evening, the Perfected Sovereign descended again and said: “The Emperor’s grand offering has brought joy to the Supreme Emperor and all the heavens. The imperial destiny shall endure far beyond that of the Tang.” In the sixth year of Taiping Xingguo, Shouzhen attended court to offer congratulations on the Qianming Festival. Summoned for an audience, he presented a memorial, saying: “The sagely Perfected One has descended to bless our flourishing dynasty. I humbly request that an edict be issued to bestow an honorific title, thereby manifesting its divine favor above.” His request was granted. Soon after, an edict was issued:

> The deity of Taiping Palace, having received its mandate from the Supreme Heaven, descends in spirit to the mortal realm. Its fragrant offerings are presented, and its sacrificial blessings are manifest. It has greatly sheltered the people and repeatedly bestowed its majestic favor. It is fitting to confer a noble title in gratitude for its divine grace. Let the deity be enfeoffed as the **Lan Sheng General**.

When the edict arrived at the palace, Shouzhen burned incense to announce it. The Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and said: “You must ask the Emperor: *What sagely being does ‘Yi Sheng’ (Assisting the Sagely) assist?*” For days, Shouzhen was filled with doubt and fear, not daring to reply. The Perfected Sovereign descended again and said: “Simply report this to the Emperor. You will not be blamed.” Shouzhen then submitted a memorial detailing the matter. Upon reading it, Taizong summoned his close ministers and said: “The Jade Emperor’s assisting minister—the one he assists is the Supreme Emperor.” He instructed that this meaning be conveyed to Shouzhen so that he might relay it.

When the imperial command was transmitted to the palace, Shouzhen proceeded to the hall, burned incense, and announced it. The Perfected Sovereign said: “This is correct.” In the seventh year, Shouzhen again attended court to offer congratulations. The Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and said: “I have a message for you to convey to the Emperor:

> When the Great Dao flourishes, dark schemes perish.
> All the sages of the heavens rejoice.
> The Song dynasty’s altars shall endure for ages,
> As the era of Great Peace begins to rise.
> Let the sovereign’s heart be upright and wise,
> Loving the people and governing the state with care.
> The foundation of ten thousand years shall ever renew,
> Its golden branches and jade leaves never ceasing.

Shouzhen received this and reported it to the court. An edict was issued, bestowing upon him a purple robe and the title **Chongyuan Grand Master**.

Thereafter, whenever envoys were sent to perform offerings and announcements, if the Perfected Sovereign had any message, Shouzhen would secretly report it. At the beginning of the Zhidao era, the Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended and addressed Shouzhen, saying: “At the founding of the Jianlong era, I descended by the Supreme Emperor’s command to protect the times. Now the foundation is established, and the altars of state shall endure forever. An era of peace shall follow, with enlightened rulers succeeding one another. My time here has reached its end, and I shall return to the heavens. You will no longer hear my words. If the state should pray for blessings, simply purify the altar, burn incense, and face north to address me. Though I may not descend to speak, I shall bestow fortune and protect the imperial altars.”

The Perfected Sovereign added: “You have served me from my descent until now for thirty-five years, and your diligence has been great. The Supreme Emperor has issued a talismanic command appointing you as the **Lord of the Five Lands**. When this term is fulfilled, you shall ascend as an immortal official. Your time here will also be short.” From then on, the Perfected Sovereign no longer descended to speak.

The following year, on the sixteenth day of the intercalary seventh month, Shouzhen said to his disciples: “I have received the talismanic command. Now I shall depart.” With these words, he passed away.

Later, when the new sovereign ascended the throne, the rites of veneration were faithfully observed as before. Upon receiving the *Yuanyou* era name, he performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, and constructed the Jade Purity Radiant Response Palace. Within the palace, at the northwest corner of the Hall of Precious Talismans, the **Hall of Congealed Mandate** was built, and behind it, the **Pavilion of Congealed Mandate**, to enshrine the Perfected Sovereign.

In the seventh year of Dazhong Xiangfu, an edict was issued:

> The unfolding of the precious mandate is borne by the supreme deity. In response to its wondrous signs, we reverently augment its august title. This is the great ritual of governance and the profound purpose of sheltering the people. Moreover, it assists in proclaiming the primal transformation, serving as a model for all spirits. It governs the hidden and the manifest among living beings, spreading its luminous majesty across the blessed lands. When the imperial foundation was first laid, it descended to govern and protect. From the late cultured sovereign to the present, it has continued to uphold the legacy of the ancestors, fulfilling its appointed role. Thus, we have repeatedly adorned its sacred halls and presented offerings of reverent praise. It has bestowed boundless fortune and aided the flourishing of our grand enterprise. Reflecting upon our humble self, who now inherits and governs this vast realm, we find that the rituals of veneration coincide with the mysterious workings of auspicious omens. In cherishing its hidden assistance, how dare we cease our reverence? Therefore, we further enhance its glorious title, striving to express our sincerest devotion to the supreme essence. We hope thereby to fulfill the rites of respectful offering, ensuring enduring peace for all beings. Hence, we issue this decree, commanding the ministers to deeply comprehend our intent and jointly proclaim this matter. Let the **Lan Sheng General** be granted the title **Yi Sheng Bao De Zhen Jun** (Perfected Sovereign Who Assists the Sagely and Protects Virtue).

The Perfected Sovereign’s descent into the world often involved bestowing teachings upon people, which were then recorded. Among the people of Qi and Yong, whenever malevolent spirits or monstrous beings caused extreme harm, they would sincerely submit petitions. The Guardian of the True [Dao] would then pray and, following the Sovereign’s instructions, set forth—none failed to be subdued. The miracles and proofs of efficacy were too numerous to record. What follows is an account of what has been transmitted:

The Guardian of the True once paid homage at the Jade Emperor’s grand hall and saw its plaque inscribed: *Hall of Pervading Illumination*. Not understanding its meaning, he burned incense and entreated, saying, “This humble one fails to grasp the significance of *Pervading Illumination*—dare I beseech the Perfected Sovereign’s teaching?”

The Perfected Sovereign replied: “The Supreme Emperor resides in the Highest Three Heavens, revered as the Lord of all heavens. All phenomena and the host of immortals bow before Him. He ascends the Golden Hall, and the hall’s radiance is wholly concentrated in the Emperor’s form; the Emperor’s radiance, in turn, illuminates the Golden Hall. Light pervades and penetrates all, leaving nothing unillumined—hence it is called the *Hall of Pervading Illumination*. The Lords of the Heavens, the myriad spirits in attendance, and the assembly of immortals, Brahmā, and Buddhas all come to pay homage. Gazing upon the hall, one sees only the Supreme Emperor, majestic within the great radiance. When the immortal ranks withdraw, the light disperses throughout the heavens.”

There was an old man named Wang, over seventy years of age, who in his youth had served a military commander but retired in his old age to Mount Zhongnan. He scorned absurd and deceitful matters, clenching his fists in indignation. Initially, he did not deeply believe in the Perfected Sovereign’s descent. Yet after witnessing the miraculous with his own eyes, he was moved to reverence. Thereafter, he visited the palace twice daily to burn incense and prostrate himself, never once neglecting his devotion, even amid wind, rain, frost, or snow.

One day, he suddenly urged the Guardian of the True to open the hall doors so he might gaze upon the Sovereign, burn incense, and weep, saying: “This old man has always been of unyielding spirit. In my youth, I served in the military and scorned demonic forces, ever upholding integrity. Through a hundred lifetimes of fortune, I have encountered the Supreme Perfected. Now, enfeebled and nearing my end, I wish only that after my passing, I may remain at your side to serve as your attendant—this would be more than enough.”

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and granted his request. Soon after, the old man passed away without illness.

A few days later, the Guardian of the True suddenly heard a voice calling his name from the void beside the Hall of the Perfected Sovereign. It said: “...I am the Iron Wheel General. Why have you so utterly overlooked me?” The Guardian of the True looked up and asked: “The four generals who attend the Perfected Sovereign are ever present in the hall, and I have always revered them. I do not know which star or rank the Iron Wheel General holds.” The voice from the void replied: “I am the old man Wang. Once I made a most earnest vow, begging to serve at the Sovereign’s side. Now I have been accepted and appointed to oversee the iron wheel, ranking below the four generals. When you perform rites or offer sacrifices in the future, do not forget my name.”

The Perfected Sovereign once said to the Guardian of the True: “Whenever I traverse the heavens on my rounds, the various spirit officials, swift couriers, and soldiers in my retinue number over a million. Comets and malevolent omens, knowing where my procession arrives, all conceal their traces and flee far away. The peaks and ranges, the seas and rivers, can be summoned at my command—how could the world’s mere specters and demonic aberrations be worth counting? Out of regard for your integrity, I entrust you with the sword arts so that you may save the people from suffering and avert calamity. You must apply yourself with diligence, never growing lax or idle. Accumulate merit among the people, extend kindness to all things. Heaven observes all, and your name shall be recorded. But if you treat the Dao with negligence, take its teachings lightly, and fail to uphold emptiness and stillness, you will incur unseen retribution. If I were to grow angry, all things would instantly turn to dust—could you withstand that? Yet when you face punishment, it is only because the five lesser generals are displeased with your lack of devotion. You should show them due reverence. Whatever thoughts arise in you, they already know beforehand. Do not deceive yourself, lest you bring misfortune upon yourself.”

One day, the Guardian of the True burned incense with leisurely composure and reverently asked: “I have observed the teachings of the Buddha, which declare that in all the heavens above and the earth below, none surpass the Buddha. I wonder, above the Three Clarities, what rank and position do they hold? I humbly beg for your true words to dispel my ignorance.” The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “The Buddha is a sage who attained the Dao in the West. Among the Three Clarities, there is a separate realm where Brahmā resides. In relation to the Supreme Emperor, they are like the nine ministers serving the Son of Heaven in the mortal world.”

The Guardian of the True asked: “Yet his teachings have spread widely throughout the world—what is the reason for this?” The Perfected Sovereign replied: “The flourishing of a teaching depends on the Emperor’s will.” The Guardian of the True then asked: “Both Daoist and Buddhist scriptures have been handed down to the world. If one wishes to venerate and follow one of them, which will bring blessings?” The Perfected Sovereign said: “The *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* encompasses all that is vast and embraces all that is minute. It refines the self and cultivates conduct, governs the family and rules the state. If people could grasp its essential meaning, fathom its wondrous use, and in all moments believe in it and practice it, they would not merely increase their blessings—there is nothing they could not attain. The Buddhist *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections* disciplines the mind and cultivates nature, eliminates greed and distances misfortune, imparts compassionate instruction and admonition, and demonstrates good and evil—it too is wholly aligned with the Dao. To follow it in seeking blessings would certainly bring boundless benefit. As for the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, both are ranked among the immortals, and the Six Classics and their commentaries contain the methods for governing the world and the arts of ruling the people—all is therein. Though the world recites them, few truly follow their teachings. If one’s mouth recites while the heart follows, and the heart follows while actions correspond, if the ways of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are always held in mind, then not only will human affairs be rectified, but the principles of long life and enduring vision are not far off.”

The Guardian of the True once again made a request: “In the Red Valley of Mount Zhongnan, there is a shrine to the valley spirit. The people of the nearby villages often make offerings there, slaughtering oxen and pigs for feasts, with wine and music clamoring loudly, and the common folk dancing. In such matters, do they receive protection?” The Perfected Sovereign said: “Mount Zhongnan is an imperial mountain and a land of imperial blessing. From ancient times to the present, the distinction between the sacred and the profane has always been clear. To invoke evil and summon demons, to kill living beings in pursuit of blessings—how could such acts bring protection? Later, bandits hid in the shrine’s vicinity, and those who hunted them piled brushwood and set it ablaze. The shrine was reduced to ashes, and no numinous signs remained.”

At the end of the *Jianlong* era, the scholar Liu Wan of Chang’an, who possessed considerable literary talent and stood out among his peers, once came to the hall, bowed twice, and earnestly prayed: “I wish to know whether my future rank and position will be high or low. I beg for a divine revelation.” The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Heaven has bestowed upon you a literary nature but not an official’s rank. If you study the Dao and withdraw into seclusion, you may yet prolong your years. If you recklessly seek advancement, you will hasten your own end.” Liu Wan heard this, departed in displeasure, and three years later, he indeed died without having achieved success.

During the *Yongxi* era, Master Chen Tuan of Mount Hua, known as the Recluse of Secluded Mystery, passed away in a stone chamber at Zhangchao Valley. Many in the world transmitted accounts of his ascension. Guarding Perfection paid homage at the shrine and, while burning incense, respectfully petitioned: “Master Chen Tuan of Mount Hua has recently died, and people say he achieved *shijie*—liberation through the corpse. Yet I dare not presume to know whether his merits and conduct have truly attained the ranks of immortality. I humbly beseech the Supreme Perfected to grant me a brief instruction.”

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Chen Tuan’s cultivation of *qi* and nurturing of spirit grasped the essentials. However, his merit in benefiting others was not yet complete; he merely held a specific office.”

During the *Duan’gong* era, Gao Ningku, a *Bibu Langzhong* who served as prefectural governor of Fengxiang, once came to the hall to pay his respects. After he departed, the Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended in speech to the temple overseer, Li Zhu, saying: “Gao Ningku’s conduct lacks loyalty and sincerity. His death will not be long in coming.” Li Zhu secretly recorded this. Soon after, Gao Ningku completed his term and returned to the capital, where he was appointed a *San Si Pan Guan*. Upon hearing this, Li Zhu once again burned incense and petitioned: “Gao Ningku now holds this office—what good fortune does this portend?”

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Death is near.” Within months, Gao Ningku died.

During the *Qiande* era, Minister of Personnel Song Bai resided in Zhengwu. He had a younger brother, small in stature, named Qige. At the age of ten, Qige was bewitched by a fox spirit, wailing uncontrollably and behaving erratically. At times, his strength rivaled that of several men, and his family could not restrain him. Every physician who came to treat him with acupuncture was beaten and driven away. Song Bai, purifying his heart, sent a trusted attendant to the temple to offer prayers and earnestly seek protection.

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Go. I shall send Guarding Perfection to him.” Guarding Perfection received the command and set out. Upon arriving at the household and sitting in the guest hall, Qige suddenly became flustered and disoriented. The family hurried out to greet and bow to Guarding Perfection. After questioning them in detail, Guarding Perfection sternly called Qige’s name. In an instant, Qige shook his head, and from within, a faint murmur emerged. He approached Guarding Perfection, trembling and drenched in sweat. Guarding Perfection rebuked the spirit, and after some time, the ghost revealed its form, kowtowing and admitting its guilt. Guarding Perfection executed it with a protective talisman, and the ghost perished at once. Qige collapsed to the ground and lay unconscious for a long while before reviving, fully restored to health.

The Perfected Sovereign once suddenly addressed Guarding Perfection: “At the shrine of Li Jing at the foot of the mountain, dozens of fox spirits have gathered. The local earth god has just sent an urgent report. Fearing they may harm the people, you must hasten to expel them.” Guarding Perfection received the command, took up his sword, and departed. In an instant, he arrived before the shrine and shouted several times in a voice like thunder. Soon, dozens of fox spirits emerged, lining up before him in fear and trembling.

Guarding Perfection rebuked them: “This is a place where the Supreme Perfected descends. How dare you defile it? I do not wish to slay you now. Return swiftly to the forests and thickets, and do not stain my sacred sword with blood.” The spirits glanced at one another, then scrambled away in disarray. Guarding Perfection’s departure and return took scarcely any time at all.

A Daoist residing at the temple, Wang Deyuan, asked where he had gone. Guarding Perfection recounted the events in full. Wang Deyuan said: “The journey there and back is twenty *li*—how could you have returned so quickly?”

Guarding Perfection replied: “When I left the shrine, I swung my sword and cut a low-hanging branch from the courtyard tree. You may verify this.” At dawn, Wang Deyuan mounted his horse to investigate. Before the shrine, he detected a foul, putrid stench that made it impossible to approach. He retrieved the severed branch and returned, then bowed twice in astonishment.

At that time, several hundred fox spirits were causing disturbances in Dengzhou. Guarding Perfection, upon hearing this, burned incense and petitioned, recounting the matter in full and requesting permission to travel there and eliminate them.

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “These fox spirits once transformed into the likeness of bodhisattvas in the Southern Mountains of Chang’an, deceiving local residents into offering wealth as alms. Yet among them, eight or nine out of ten have since turned their hearts toward goodness. For this reason, the Celestial Emperor granted them a mandate to serve as the earth gods of Dengzhou. Even among those like the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, who are ranked among the immortals, the methods of governing the world and ruling the people are all contained within the Five Classics and Six Classics. Though the world recites them, few follow their teachings. If one’s speech aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with action—if the Way of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom is always held in mind—then not only will human affairs be rectified, but the principles of longevity and enduring vision will be close at hand.”

Guarding Perfection once again petitioned: “At the shrine of the Red Valley spirit in the Zhongnan Mountains, many from the nearby villages offer prayers, slaughtering oxen and pigs as offerings, with wine and music resounding loudly, and the people dancing in revelry. Do such acts bring divine favor?”

The Perfected Sovereign said: “The Zhongnan Mountains are an imperial mountain and a land of imperial blessing. From the common to the sacred, this has been true in all ages. To invoke evil and summon demons, to kill living beings and pray for blessings—how can such acts bring protection? They are far from it indeed.”

...piled brushwood and set it ablaze. The shrine was reduced to ashes, and no numinous signs remained.

At the end of the *Jianlong* era, the scholar Liu Wan of Chang’an, who possessed considerable literary talent and stood out among his peers, once came to the hall, bowed twice, and earnestly prayed: “I wish to know whether my future rank and position will be high or low. I beg for a divine revelation.” The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Heaven has bestowed upon you a literary nature but not an official’s rank. If you study the Dao and withdraw into seclusion, you may yet prolong your years. If you recklessly seek advancement, you will hasten your own end.” Liu Wan heard this, departed in displeasure, and three years later, he indeed died without having achieved success.

During the *Yongxi* era, Master Chen Tuan of Mount Hua, known as the Recluse of Secluded Mystery, passed away in a stone chamber at Zhangchao Valley. Many in the world transmitted accounts of his ascension. Guarding Perfection went to pay homage and, while burning incense, respectfully petitioned: “Master Chen Tuan of Mount Hua has recently died, and people say he achieved *shijie* (release from the corpse). I humbly inquire whether his cultivation and conduct have truly attained the ranks of immortality, and beg the Supreme Perfected to deign to offer guidance.”

The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: “Chen Tuan’s refinement of *qi* and nurturing of spirit grasped the essentials. Yet his merit in benefiting others was insufficient—he merely held a specific office. In the *Duangong* era, Gao Ninggu, a *Bibu Langzhong* (Vice Director of the Ministry of Justice) who oversaw Fengxiang Prefecture, once came to the palace to pay his respects. After he departed, the Perfected Sovereign suddenly descended in speech to the palace overseer Li Zhu, saying: ‘Gao Ninggu’s conduct lacks loyalty and trustworthiness; his death is not far off.’ Li Zhu secretly noted this. Soon after, Ninggu completed his term and returned to the capital to serve as a *San Si Pan Guan* (Judicial Officer of the Three Departments). Upon hearing this, Li Zhu again burned incense and petitioned: ‘Now that Gao Ninggu holds this position, what fortune does he possess?’ The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech and said: ‘Death is imminent.’ Within months, Ninggu died.

During the *Qiande* era, Minister of Personnel Song Bai resided in Zhengwu. He had a younger brother, small in stature, named Qige. At the age of ten, Qige was bewitched by a fox spirit, wailing uncontrollably and behaving abnormally. At times, his strength equaled that of several men, and his family could not restrain him. Every physician who came to treat him with acupuncture was assaulted. Song Bai, with a purified heart, sent a trusted attendant to the palace to offer prayers and earnestly seek protection. The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech, saying: ‘Go. I shall send Guarding Perfection to him.’ Guarding Perfection received the command and set out. Upon arriving at the household and sitting in the guest hall, Qige’s agitation and disorder abruptly ceased. The family hurried out to welcome and bow to him. Guarding Perfection questioned them in detail, then sternly called Qige’s name. In an instant, Qige shook his head, and from within, a faint murmur emerged. He approached Guarding Perfection, trembling and drenched in sweat. Guarding Perfection rebuked him, and after some time, the ghost revealed its form, kowtowing and admitting guilt. Guarding Perfection executed it with a protective talisman, and it died instantly. Qige collapsed to the ground and lay unconscious for a long while before reviving, fully restored to health.

The Perfected Sovereign once suddenly addressed Guarding Perfection, saying: ‘At the Li Jing Temple beneath the mountain, dozens of fox spirits have gathered. The local earth god has just sent an urgent report. Fearing they will harm the people, you must hasten to expel them.’ Guarding Perfection received the command, took up his sword, and departed. In an instant, he sat before the temple and shouted several times in a thunderous voice. Soon, dozens of fox spirits emerged, arraying themselves before him in fear and dread. Guarding Perfection rebuked them, saying: ‘This is a place where the Supreme Perfected descends. How dare you linger here? I do not wish to slay you now. Return swiftly to the wilds, and do not defile my sacred sword with blood.’ The spirits glanced at one another, then fled in disarray, crawling away on all fours.

From Guarding Perfection’s departure to his return, scarcely any time had passed. The palace-dwelling Daoist Wang Deyuan asked where he had gone, and Guarding Perfection recounted the events. Deyuan said: ‘From here to there is a round trip of twenty *li*. How could you have returned so quickly?’ Guarding Perfection replied: ‘When I left the temple, I struck a low-hanging branch of a tree in the courtyard with my sword. You may verify this.’ At dawn, Deyuan mounted his horse to investigate. Indeed, before the temple, he detected a foul, putrid stench that made approach impossible. He retrieved the severed branch and returned, then bowed twice in astonishment.

At another time, hundreds of malevolent foxes gathered in Dengzhou, causing strange disturbances. Guarding Perfection, upon hearing this, burned incense and petitioned, recounting the matter and expressing his willingness to follow the Perfected Sovereign’s command to eliminate them. The Perfected Sovereign descended in speech, saying: ‘These fox spirits once transformed into the likeness of bodhisattvas in the Southern Mountains of Chang’an, deceiving local residents into offering wealth as alms. Yet among them, eight or nine out of ten have since turned toward goodness. For this reason, the Celestial Emperor granted them a mandate to serve as the earth gods of Dengzhou. Their term has limits; when it expires, they will depart of their own accord and pose no further harm. You need not go.’

During the *Kaibao* era, in the household of Chen Yingmei, a resident of Fengxiang Prefecture, a mountain sprite caused disturbances, hurling tiles and stones until the courtyard was filled. At times, it emitted smoke and flames, threatening to burn down the house. Wealth was squandered, and the family and relatives were consumed by sorrow.

They summoned ritual masters to perform exorcisms and commanded Buddhist monks to recite scriptures, yet none could halt the disturbances. The family then relocated to escape, but the sprite followed their tracks and arrived as well. At a loss, Yingmei fasted, purified himself, and bearing incense and fruit offerings, went to the temple to make a devout plea. The Perfected Lord descended and addressed Shouzhen, saying: "Hasten to receive my command and go dispel this affliction."

Shouzhen bowed twice, strapped on his sword, and leapt upon his horse. After two nights’ journey, he arrived at the household. Yet the clamor of hurled tiles continued unabated. The onlookers thronged the path, all saying: "This Daoist will surely fail to banish this sprite."

Shouzhen then washed himself with utmost purity, straightened his robes, drew his sword, and entered. Suddenly, the disturbances ceased. That evening, he erected an altar in the courtyard. Standing upon it with sword in hand, he called out in a measured yet stern voice: "Where is the mountain sprite? If you persist in your mischief, come forth and contend with me. If not, you must depart ten thousand *li* away and I shall absolve your transgressions."

For some time, there was no response. From that moment on, the household knew peace and quiet.

Then, accompanying Shouzhen, they journeyed to the temple to present offerings and give thanks.

Another wealthy household in Chang’an, the Yang family, was likewise plagued by a specter that hurled tiles and set fires, shifting its mischief a thousandfold in a single day. The entire clan lived in dread, finding no peace. At the time, there was a thaumaturge named Li Zhuogui, renowned for his mastery of talismans and exorcisms. The Yangs summoned him, but as he neared their gate, he was struck as if by some unseen force, crawling to his feet only to collapse again. This happened thrice before he fled in disarray.

The Yangs then invited a host of monks to perform a *daochang* ritual, chanting sutras and reciting mantras to purify the premises. Suddenly, their ritual implements were snatched away—some hurled onto the roof, others cast into the well—and the monks, seized by terror, fled. Even garments and washing stones took flight, rising into the air in twos and threes before tumbling into the courtyard. Whatever they struck remained unharmed. Such uncanny disturbances multiplied beyond recounting.

Having long heard of the True Lord’s divine power, the Yangs personally carried incense and candles in haste to the temple. There, they prostrated themselves, recounting the haunting and beseeching deliverance. The True Lord descended with a decree: “Return swiftly. I shall send Shouzhen to follow.”

Shouzhen bowed deeply and set out for the Yang residence. The onlookers—scholars and commoners alike—crowded the doorways. Shouzhen changed into fresh robes, adjusted his cap, spat water, and brandished his sword, pacing the four corners of the house. At once, the disturbances fell silent.

Shouzhen said to the Yangs: “The fiend is subdued. Prepare an offering to confirm its banishment.” That evening, they erected an altar and burned memorials. After the rites concluded, he departed. The entire city bowed in awe and praise.

After Shouzhen returned, the Yangs followed him to the temple to present offerings in gratitude.

There was also a wealthy merchant named Liu Wenji who had fallen under the bewitchment of a fox spirit. His mind grew restless, his movements erratic. One day, he encountered a Daoist in the marketplace who said: “Your face bears the mark of a demonic presence. You must have been ensnared by an evil entity. The True Lord has descended—pray to him with utmost sincerity, and this affliction will surely be cured.”

Wenji then prepared incense and candles, rushing to the temple morning and night. On the road, he was pursued by spectral apparitions—sometimes monks or nuns, sometimes women, sometimes merchants—each assuming myriad forms to lure and obstruct him. Wenji, both bewildered and entranced, lost his way. He encountered another Daoist on the road and recounted his plight. The Daoist said: “These are all ghostly illusions. Press onward without hesitation, lest you fall prey to the malevolent spirits.”

Wenji’s mind cleared. Within days, he hastened to the temple, purifying himself and prostrating with utmost devotion. After a hundred bows before the altar, the True Lord descended with a decree: “I know of your long journey. I now command Shouzhen to expel the evil for you.”

That evening, Shouzhen stood Wenji in the courtyard. Wielding his sword and spitting water, he uttered sharp rebukes several times. Wenji, dazed, collapsed to the ground. After some time, he rose and said: “Just now, as you rebuked me, I saw several figures resembling divine generals, each seizing two ghosts and dragging them away.” Trembling with fear, Wenji had fainted without realizing it. Now, his spirit felt clear and refreshed, as if awakening from a deep intoxication. He bowed a hundred times and departed.

The *Central Transmission of the Venerable Protector of Virtue* concludes here.
*Further Transmission of the Venerable Protector of Virtue*

Compiled by Wang Qinruo, Duke of Taiyuan Commandery, Grand Mentor of the Heir Apparent, Grand Councilor of the Chancellery and the Secretariat, and Minister of Works of the Song Dynasty, who reverently undertook this task.

Since the True Lord’s advent, officials and commoners alike have journeyed from afar—some sending forth sincere prayers from afar, others purifying themselves to prostrate in worship—all seeking the True Lord’s response, and at times, their pleas have been heard.

For the most part, his teachings adapt to each person’s nature and habits, offering guidance and admonition:
To ministers, he upholds loyalty;
to children, he upholds filial piety.
To the pure and sincere, he imparts refined maxims;
to the greedy and cruel, he warns with essential truths.
His words are simple and accessible, often harmonious in rhythm, yet those who hear them remain few.

Now, based on what has been transmitted, we record them as follows.

During the Qiande era, Feng Dongyuan, a Daoist of the White Deer Abbey on Mount Li, was paying homage when he lit incense and reverently addressed the True Lord: “Dongyuan has expounded the books of Confucius and followed the teachings of Laozi for many years, yet in cultivating the self and refining conduct, I have not grasped the true essence. Now, by the fortune of encountering a supreme sage, I dare to seek a single ancient teaching.”

The True Lord descended and spoke:

"Only upon reaching the realm does one know peace;
when the form is busy, the numinous essence remains at ease.
True emptiness must be illuminated and penetrated;
the subtle and profound lead to the great return.
In movement, observe without obstruction;
profound stillness harmonizes with nature.
When merit is accomplished, the spirit becomes unfathomable,
and transformations may ascend to the heavens.
Going and staying depend on oneself;
the Three Officials pardon past transgressions.
The Bureau of Destiny erases the record of sins,
and the Six Dings report to the heavens above.

All beings who seek to cultivate the Dao
must know the primordial source."

Dongyuan bowed a hundred times, offered reverent thanks, and departed.

During the Kaibao era, Attendant Censor Lu Chong, by imperial decree, governed Fengxiang Prefecture. He visited the abbey to pay homage and requested the Guardian of the True One to descend at the prefectural office, where he arranged an offering and prayed. That evening, after purifying himself and making his devotion, he said: "Bound by my official duties, I am unable to pay direct homage to your true form. With these humble offerings, I reverently beseech your divine gaze and beg for true words to guide my ignorance."

The True Lord descended and spoke:

"Exert yourself in serving your lord to be a loyal minister.
Do not covet ill-gotten wealth, nor heed wicked affairs.
Rectify the penal code and govern the mountains and rivers;
relieve and heal the people.
Act in accord with the kingly Way, and you shall ultimately be a fortunate man.
Accumulated transgressions become calamities, and surely lead to sinking and drowning.

All beings possess a formless nature paired with a formed body.
Since time immemorial, they have been unable to awaken themselves.
Yet there exists a world without limits, a land of unending day,
where the primordial void merges, and the profound and obscure share the same principle."

Again, he said:

"Within the six directions and the universe,
most beings fail to comprehend.
Creating karma, they proceed blindly,
like the blind groping across rivers and seas.
But with wisdom as your guide,
you may traverse a thousand seas."

Chong bowed again, recorded the words, and recited them.

Left Rectifier of Omissions Wang Gui, one day with a purified heart, visited the abbey. He lit incense and earnestly prayed: "Though I am but a lowly and flawed being, burdened with endless faults, I am fortunate to encounter a supreme perfected one. I humbly beg for divine instruction—how may I cultivate myself to attain long life?"

The True Lord descended and spoke:

"I urge you to cultivate and refine—nothing surpasses diligence.
Without ceasing in diligence, even the highest sages will take heed.
When the era of Great Peace arrives, martial and civil arts will flourish.
Without civil arts, there is no rectitude; with them, the lord is benefited.
Enjoy your stipend and profit, but do not defy the king’s command.
Act with good fortune and virtue, yet remain in pure poverty.
Pure poverty resonates with heaven and earth;
defiled wealth is like fire cast upon ice.
Cast upon ice, the fire’s embers gradually fade.
Those who accumulate evil pierce themselves through.
Pierced through, calamity extends to the seven generations,
and in the earthly prisons below, suffering befalls kin.

I dangle a thousand-foot rope to fish for those with remaining threads of life.
The Dao is revered, virtue is esteemed;
the Great Dao gives birth to all things.
Beings’ heads resemble heaven, their feet resemble earth,
and their center, empty and open, accords with the true principle.
Carving doors and windows to make a dwelling,
within the chamber there is one thing—
neither shadow nor form, profound and obscure, unknown to people.
If one can recognize it, one attains longevity.

Yang resides in heaven, yin upon the earth;
when the two qi harmonize, there is true significance.
Within the void, creation occurs naturally,
and from nature, the ten thousand kinds arise.
Heaven is not high, earth is not low;
the Great Dao blends with the principle of the primordial void.
If those who study the Dao wish to hear this,
this is the exalted gateway to cultivation."

During the Kaibao era, Chancellor Shen Lun suffered from a prolonged external illness. With sincere devotion, he sent an emissary to the abbey to arrange an offering and make this entreaty: "Lun is of impure and filthy constitution, afflicted by illness. How may I cultivate myself to escape this suffering? I dare to seek sacred words to guide my ignorance."

The True Lord descended and spoke:

"The numinous essence does not fall ill; the physical form finds peace on its own.
When the physical form is ill, turn inward and observe."

The emissary recorded the words and returned to deliver them to Lun. Lun received and read them, exclaiming in surprise and joy, "I have grasped it!" Soon after, his illness was cured, and he sent another emissary to the abbey to offer thanks through ritual.

Daoist Wang Deyuan, while traveling on Mount Zhongnan, lodged at the abbey. He diligently tended the incense and fire, cherished life, yet his temperament was narrow, and he often succumbed to anger. One day, the True Lord descended and addressed him:

"If you study the Dao and cultivate the true,
first regulate and refine your nature to harmonize with heaven’s harmony.
Forget all deliberate action, do not dissipate your mind and consciousness.
Cultivate serenity and clarity, and the Dao will become visible."

Again, he admonished him:

"Do not manage what is within, nor what is without.
In coming and going, the true and empty are without obstruction.
Where you dwell in peace and joy is your home;
each must diligently practice without waiting for others.
Do not wait for others—
those who have already attained find no hindrance.
In the wondrous bliss of true emptiness lies heaven,
where, in union with the sages, all sins are extinguished."

Again, he said:

"Subtle principles must be practiced to reach the goal;
in all your movements, accord with the Dao.
In action, perceive true emptiness;
true emptiness is without affliction.
Blending with the primordial void,
there exists soundless music.
In the furnace of earth and the cauldron of heaven,
turn your back on the mundane and return to the sagely Dao.
Constantly observe with wisdom,
and you may resolve it in this lifetime."

Deyuan said: "Overwhelmed by the True Lord’s descent and teachings, I do not understand the phrase 'in union with the sages, all sins are extinguished.' I humbly beg for further instruction."

The True Lord replied: "If you eliminate affliction and enter stillness, refine your heart and cultivate the true, accumulating merit until the measure is full, the hundred joints of the Niwan Palace will open, and your primordial spirit will attain numinous communion, thereby uniting with the sages. The wondrous bliss of heaven will be everywhere accessible—how could any sins remain? Thus it is said, 'in union with the sages, all sins are extinguished.'"

During the Taiping Xingguo era, Li Zhu, Director of the Bureau of Imperial Carriages, once governed Fengxiang Prefecture. Having witnessed the numinous responses, he was soon reassigned by imperial decree to oversee the abbey, a post he held for over a decade with strict integrity. The True Lord descended and spoke to him on numerous occasions, though only a few of the recorded transmissions remain. One said:

"At the beginning of the Jianlong era, I received the mandate of profound stillness. The Supreme Emperor commanded that all the sages, including myself, descend riding dragons, accompanied by the constellations. The Five Peaks received their orders to govern, and the earthly deities secretly supported the state, aiding in the flourishing of the enlightened age. I wish for Li Zhu to know the time of my descent, but he must not lightly disclose it, lest he leak the celestial secrets."

Another time, the True Lord said:

"Work with me to uniquely aid the state; govern the people with me by the Dao/Way; manage your household with me through kindness and goodness; and remain sober without drinking. When awake, govern the people; when inebriated, govern the spirit. This is the method to prolong life and increase longevity—I urge you, Prefect, to remember it."

Another time, he said:
"To govern as an official, seek clarity and brightness;
Let wisdom and insight together bring purity to affairs.
Observe the heavens, act in accord with the Dao/Way, and align with hidden virtue;
Consume the ruler’s salary with constant awe.
For me, purify your heart and renew your bones,
Turn from the mundane, enter sageliness, and hasten toward long life.
The joys of the celestial palace surpass the mortal world—
In the land of eternal light, your name shall be inscribed."

Another time, he said:
"Prefect, you have been reborn in the Central Kingdom for many lifetimes.
Be as upright and honest with me; do not act with crookedness.
Accumulate goodness and merit with me; assist and support the enlightened ruler with me;
Wash clean the suffering of the common people with me; and keep in your heart the prisons and judgments with me.
If the Supreme Emperor knows of this, you shall be named a celestial official.
Do not cling to the transient wealth of this world’s turning cycles—
Instead, cultivate the tangible forms of practice,
Attain merits that follow you in life,
And gain boundless blessings.
Do not linger in complacency with me—
Time passes swiftly.
The numinous officials will reward your merits,
And the celestial bureaus will augment your blessings.
If you follow my sacred words to the letter,
You shall surely prolong your years and increase your longevity."

Another time, he said:
"Though you reach seventy years of age,
Your time in this world will not be long.
Even if you live a hundred years,
How many autumns will you truly have?
The earthly courts must be feared;
The underworld’s judgments are hard to plead.
With merit, you need not fear;
With accumulated sins, you will surely face punishment.
No descendant can take your place—
Awaken early, lest you remain foolish."

Another time, he said:
"Whether blessed or not, fortune and karma are intertwined.
With blessings, fortune arrives;
Without them, karma entangles.
The three karmic offenses are grave,
And the root of faith is not whole.
If you follow my words,
It will be as steadfast as Mount Tai."

Another time, he said:
"Listen to my words, and your years shall be extended,
Your health preserved, and your peace secured naturally.
With unwavering sincerity, cultivate the truth of the Dao/Way—
In this life, you may stand before the Jade Emperor."

Another time, he said:
"For your devotion,
The stars descend.
They arrive riding the dark wind,
And depart upon the dharma rain.
They open the eyes and ears of the blind and foolish,
Turn the hearts of those who have accumulated evil,
And lead them all to the right path.
Because of your offerings and prayers to the Supreme,
Evil men have all come to pay reverence—
This is your merit.
I have already reported this to the Supreme Emperor,
That you may gain blessings.
You must deepen what is pure, whiten what is white, and brighten what is bright.
Do not begin with diligence only to grow lax at the end,
Nor change course midway,
Turning purity into turbidity,
Or goodness into evil.
If the numinous officials report this to the Supreme Emperor,
He will know you have strayed from my teachings."

On the night of the tenth day of the seventh month, the True Lord descended and said:
"You have served the state with loyalty and diligence,
And governed the people with kindness and love.
You must continue to apply yourself—
Do not betray my sincerity.
Before you encountered me,
All the evils you committed
I have already dissolved for you.
After meeting me,
You have no further karmic burdens—
The attendants have already recorded your merits.
You must continue, morning and evening,
To accumulate good deeds with me—
Do not grow idle in heeding my sacred words."

Another time, he said:
"Simply attend to the affairs of the state,
Redress grievances and right wrongs.
I will always dispatch numinous officials
To protect and assist you.
In all matters,
Act with fairness and uprightness,
And follow my sacred words.
Moreover, this is an age of enlightened rule—
All things lie ahead,
So you need not worry."

He also said:
"Be at ease, do not fret—
The military and government will naturally be secure.
In every matter, follow the kingly Dao/Way,
And let it spread throughout the realm."

Another time, he said:
"As the prefect, offer sincere prayers to the Supreme—
The Song dynasty’s altars of state shall be preserved in Chang’an.
Soon, the world will rejoice in great peace,
And your household shall receive blessings for generations."

Another time, he said:
"As the prefect, you must be devout,
And lend your heart to the cause of great peace.
The celestial palace will note your duties—
In every matter, be even more diligent.
All the sages know of you—
Let your every action inspire awe.
When your merits are complete,
You shall dwell forever in the Three Pure Realms."

Another time, he said:
"Do not worry needlessly in life,
Nor will you have sorrow after death.
The lord judges matters in the yang realm—
How many autumns do ordinary men truly have?
Simply follow the sacred words,
And seek long life in the heavens above?"

Each time Li Zhu received a transmission, he never failed to recite it morning and evening. The True Lord once said to him:
"Though you are nearing eighty and have not cultivated the arts of refinement,
You will not escape the fate of concealing your form and ascending in spirit—
Yet you shall still have a position to oversee."

Li Zhu bowed twice and said:
"In this life, I have been fortunate to encounter the descent of a perfected immortal
And receive your secret teachings many times.
If one day I am granted a position to oversee,
I wish to stand alongside the Guardian of the True."

The True Lord replied:
"In the worldly offices of men, the Guardian of the True does not surpass you;
But in the celestial ranks, you do not surpass the Guardian of the True.
Simply return your heart to the true and upright—
The steps to ascending as an immortal will come in time."

During the Chunhua era, the Military Commissioner of the Western Capital, Chancellor Zhao Pu, once dispatched an envoy with offerings to hold a solemn rite and earnestly pray, seeking to know fortune and misfortune. The True Lord descended and said:
"Zhao Pu has upheld the altars of state with great merit—
The heavens above know this
And grant you blessings and longevity.
Yet in elevating the great, you have harmed the small—
Even in the netherworld, there are grievances against you.
You must recite the true scriptures,
Petition heaven and earth,
And repent your past transgressions.
I shall also report this to the Supreme Emperor,
That this misfortune may be resolved.
Your office and lifespan are already fixed."

The envoy recorded this and departed. Zhao Pu knelt to read it, moved to tears. He then burned a written confession to express his remorse and again dispatched someone to the abbey to hold a rite.

The Grand Master and Assistant Director of the Chancellery, Jia Huangzhong, once sent someone to offer sincerity and pray, seeking sacred instruction. The True Lord descended and said:
"The sagely ruler commands his ministers, and ministers serve their ruler—
The Dao/Way assists the age,
The heart follows the ancients.
Let neither good nor evil be concealed;
Let neither treachery nor deceit go unheard.
When ruler and minister unite in the Dao/Way,
Merits may be established."

Another time, he said:
"Love the people with all your heart,
And let rewards and punishments be impartial.
Simply follow my words,
And your household shall be preserved in peace."

The Palace Attendant Zhang Zhuo once sought sacred words. The True Lord said:
"The Great Dao/Way nurtures your nature;
Yin and yang give birth to your body."

"Diligently practice the Dao/Way for me,
Diligently cultivate the true for me.
Be just and upright, ever mindful;
Care and compassion lie with the people.
When opportunity arises, assist the enlightened ruler,
That purity and impurity be heard by the Supreme Emperor.
Impure wealth shall not endure,
While pure poverty befits the celestial beings.
Let none boast of riches,
Nor fear the scorn of poverty.
For true wealth lies within,
And lofty purity feels no shame in poverty."

Another time, he said:
"Though the form be common, the nature is not;
Serve the state with manifest integrity.
Though your household numbers over a thousand,
Each bears their own transgressions."

Another time, he said:
"Simply ingest the yang harmony qi,
And the celestial tortoise shall be steamed anew.
The earthen furnace serves another purpose,
While the Dao/Way and virtue renew daily.
Prolong life and accumulate blessings in response,
As true emptiness becomes as close as kin.
Within the void lies wondrous principle,
And deliverance awaits those with karmic affinity."

Daoist Zhou Wuben once presented a memorial at the palace, beseeching sacred words. The True Lord descended and said:
"Your words express longing for the heavens above,
Yet your heart and intent remain distant as mountains.
The immortal palaces are no farther than your palm,
But inner and outer cultivation remain incomplete.
The officials of the yin realm record all without omission,
To spare you from falling into Dengdu for hundreds of years.
Follow my words and align with my Dao/Way,
And treading the Three Clarities shall pose no difficulty."

Zhang Shouzhen’s son, Yuanji, often observed purification rites before visiting the palace. The True Lord descended and said:
"Your father, Shouzhen, encountered me,
Thus bestowing blessings upon your descendants.
Do you not know of Zhang Daoling of Longhushan in Xinzhou?
To this day, his lineage remains unbroken,
For he too met with the exalted sages.
After attaining the Dao/Way, his merit extended to posterity.
You, too, share a karmic bond with me.
Simply remain at home, filial to your parents,
And loyal to the emperor in your official duties.
Establish yourself and spread your name—
Is this not a fine endeavor?"

Another time, he instructed:
"When idle, do not wander the streets;
Diligent study ensures a lasting name.
Let your name resound throughout the land,
And the Dao’s merit grants longevity."

He also admonished:
"Your own transgressions you know best;
Good and evil follow you each day.
If you clearly defy the heavenly Dao,
Then tell me—who is the fool?"

During the Chunhua era, the True Lord descended and spoke to Shouzhen:
"In this age of manifest sagely brilliance,
Cultivating virtue moves the Three Clarities.
Heaven returns to the true Dao/Way,
And the four seas cease their wars.
The eight directions revere the wise and sagely,
While the five grains yield abundant harvests.
I urge you to cultivate virtue,
That the Supreme Emperor may grant you long life."

Another time, he said:
"The bandits of Guanzhong arise in accord with the times’ fate;
The court must issue commands to summon and capture them,
And officials must not slaughter innocent commoners.
As the court cultivates virtue..."

The bandits must be eradicated.

He once descended to admonish the Daoist attendants, saying:
"A thousand hearts differ, ten thousand minds all err.
Intentions fail to align, and with the sagely few can accord.
Hard is the pact to keep."

The True Lord also descended to warn the officials:
"Ever maintain loyalty and trust, aligning with Heaven’s will;
Among civil and military ranks, the worthy naturally rise.
For the sovereign’s ten-thousand-year foundation,
Ever fret for the common folk, lest they suffer cold and hunger.
Long practice virtue to accord with the Dao/Way,
Burn incense and pray devoutly to the Mysterious.
Only wish the realm at peace, the lord enduring,
With one heart assist the era of Great Peace."

He also descended to admonish the court ministers:
"The pillar upholding Heaven must establish merit,
Embracing the vast seas to aid the enlightened lord.
As in King Wen’s reign and the days of Yao,
The cosmos is upheld by loyal ministers.
For the lord, one must act with utmost resolve,
In life and death alike, bear the imperial grace.
Ever practice good and virtue to align with power,
Be prudent to the end as at the start, and fear not for yourself."

**Memorial on the Affairs of the Perfected Lord of Assisting Sagacity and Preserving Virtue**
Your servant Qin Ruo states: I have heard that when High Heaven bestows its mandate, the Primordial Sage receives the era’s charge, and there must be supreme spirits who manifest hidden assistance. Their counsels and teachings are inscribed in the *Baochan* scriptures, their refined praises recorded in the *Jianguan* annals. Examining the mysterious correspondences of past and present, one sees the mutual resonance of Heaven and humanity.

Your servant Qin Ruo, with utmost joy and reverence, bows his head again and again.

I humbly consider that from the numinous source, blessings overflow; the fiery virtue continues its flourishing. The august fortune unfolds, its mighty signs resplendent. The Primordial Attendant of the Jade Dawn, serving the luminous might of the Golden Portals, descends his essence and spirit upon the unwavering people, revealing the unfathomable workings of yin and yang. He aids the great state in inaugurating its destiny, announcing to the divine lineage the continuation of its design. The omens appear first in subtle signs, startling to hear and behold.

Thus, the offerings are augmented and splendid, the laudations richly presented. Grand rites are solemnly observed, pure blessings resound in response. Even the girdled officials and ministers, the common folk with horizontal pupils, bow their heads to gaze upon his immaculate countenance, purify their hearts to await his numinous decrees. According to their natures’ depth or shallowness, their capacities’ breadth or narrowness, he at times admonishes with subtle words, awakening their delusions. His earnest teachings penetrate their hidden subtleties; the benighted masses come to recognize the true and correct.

When malevolent spirits wreak havoc—unrecorded even in the Xia tripods—
Or when blindness breeds calamity—unfathomable even to Qin physicians—
He deigns to listen, devoutly and from afar bestowing guidance.
The true teachings descend, and noxious influences are surely eradicated.
The obscure and profound signs now shine upon the mortal realm,
While the sojourns of the Terrace of Reverence swiftly return to the celestial heights.
Forever shall his fragrant sacrifices be offered,
And his coiled blessings subtly bestowed.

All his secret words are preserved in the old records,
To be arranged and presented for posterity.
Daring to claim that even the humble and insignificant have been graced by the luminous decree,
I fast and purify myself to recite them with reverence.
Clasping my hands in trepidation, I cannot fathom their profundity,
Yet roughly expound and elucidate them.

I reflect that the illustrious traces of the Supreme Perfected
Are indeed the bright proofs of this enlightened age.
How could one of my mediocre and insignificant talent
Presume to describe such matters?

I humbly hope that the August Worthy, Venerable of the Dao/Way, Treasure of the Dao/Way, Responsive to the Chapters, who moves the sagely and enlightened, benevolent and filial Emperor, may deign to peruse this, wield his brush to compose a preface, bestow a name to commemorate his fragrant virtue, and place it at the head of the work. Thus may reverent service be manifest, and boundless blessings be eternally cherished.

Your servant, unable to contain his awe as he gazes toward Heaven and longs for the sagely presence, is overwhelmed with trembling and trepidation.

The three fascicles recording the affairs of the Perfected Lord of Assisting Sagacity and Preserving Virtue are respectfully submitted herewith for Your Majesty’s perusal.

Your servant Qin Ruo, with utmost reverence and fear, bows his head again and again.

Wang Qin Ruo, Grand Mentor with the Rank of Grandee, Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, Grand Pillar of State, Duke of Taiyuan Commandery

**Imperial Rescript:**
We have perused the memorial in full. The wondrous Dao/Way is vast, rooted in the tranquil and profound; the supreme spirit is boundless, manifest in its responsive virtue. The Primordial Attendant of the Jade Void stands at the apex of the numinous registers. In hidden assistance and completion, he directly reveals the obscure and concealed.

When the August Ancestor received the mandate, he descended blessings upon the earth and displayed his numinous power. When Our Illustrious Predecessor continued the glory, he announced the imperial destiny and inaugurated the omens. Thus, the expression of fine recompense began, and a special sanctuary was established. The solemn rites of offering and exorcism were observed, bringing great blessings to the black-haired people.

Moreover, in discerning the subtle and profound, relying upon the liver and gall, he demonstrated earnest teachings and revealed his unfathomable might. His ethereal responses were like echoes; his swift chariot swiftly returned. Since We ascended and inherited the throne, We have reverently augmented our veneration, solemnly establishing the rites at the Reverent Hall, presenting honorific titles at the Primordial Capital. Considering that the secret decrees are fully preserved in the records, We deem this a most flourishing endeavor, desiring to compile and edit them to display these auspicious proofs.

You, as the foremost of the court, govern the Dao/Way and bring harmony to the state. Drawing from refined and abundant sources, you have harmonized the many and arranged them into a compilation. Meticulous yet comprehensive, you have sealed them in silk wrappers and presented them. Earnestly requesting a preface and hoping for a name, though Our words are shallow and unworthy, how could We not heed such sincere pleas? With reluctance, We accede to your diligent request, moved by your earnestness. Our admiration and esteem are ever-present, day and night unceasing.

Your request is approved. In the third year of the Chongning era, on the eighteenth day of the fourth month, the imperial command was delivered to the Palace of Merit. The decree bestowing an honorific title upon the True Lord states:

The Chancellery proclaims: Of the August Emperor on High, there are assisting ministers whose numinous power shines resplendently. At the foot of Mount Zhongnan, they have repeatedly received glorious favor, their splendor enhanced by laudatory inscriptions. The Perfected Lord of Assisting Sagacity and Preserving Virtue descended his words at the beginning of the Jianlong era, making manifest his announcements by the end of the Kaibao era. He greatly protects the lands below, guarding our state and homeland. An abode was established for his worship, and his responses were as swift as echoes. Considering Our humble self’s birth and the emperor’s profound and secret prayers, how could We forget to render fine recompense for these auspicious events?

For utmost sincerity can move, and its responses are surely fulfilled. What is stored within? The blessings of ten thousand generations. Thus, We bestow a grand title, issuing this decree to glorify Our canon. May the divine and celestial realms eternally flourish in pure harmony.

The Perfected Lord of Assisting Sagacity and Preserving Virtue at the Supreme Clarity Great Peace Palace in Fengxiang Prefecture shall be specially honored as the **Perfected Lord of Assisting Sagacity, Responsive to Stimuli, Storing Blessings, and Preserving Virtue**.
