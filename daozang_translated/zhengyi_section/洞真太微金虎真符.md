**The Wondrous Cavern Scripture of the Great Subtlety: The Golden Tiger True Talisman**

The Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch of Great Subtlety is concealed within the Jade Palace of Primordial Radiance. Its venomous might spans ten thousand fathoms, striking demons to guard the scriptures. Seven thousand spirit-tigers stand ready at the Jade Pass, while three hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence scatter incense across the celestial courts. The Five Venerables oversee the registers, and the Golden Dawn attends the perfected.

None but those inscribed in the jade registers and carved upon the Three Clarities’ tablets may receive the inner talisman of the Golden Tiger or hear the Jade Chapters of the Most High.

This talisman is engraved within the *Jade Tablets of the Wisdom Chapter* of the Shangqing canon, comprising seventy thousand words. Its numinous tones and subtle Daoist mysteries are profound and difficult to fathom. Some conceal the hidden names of celestial demons; others reveal the inner appellations of the myriad spirits. Still others resolve enigmatic metaphors and secret instructions through the jade-like resonance of its sounds.

The Perfected Lord of Lesser Existence transcribed this talisman, along with the methods of its divine and numinous inner texts, to command the spirits of heaven and earth—comprising but a hundred words.

This incantation is wondrously esoteric, known as the *Three Heavens’ Tiger Script of the Great Primordium’s Supreme Register*. Those who receive it must first purify themselves for seventy days, presenting a Golden Tiger Jade Bell, thirty feet each of plain silk and dark gauze as pledges of their oath to the Golden Perfected. They swear an unspoken covenant before heaven and earth. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, they may transmit it to three persons over seven hundred years.

The Golden Tiger Jade Essence True Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch of Great Subtlety is the inner resonance of the *Natural Golden Chapters of the Supreme Radiance of the Great Primordium*. It commands the Golden Immortals, seals mountains to summon spirits, and its might shakes the Six Heavens, beheading and casting down the myriad gods.

The Most High regularly dispatches seven hundred thousand warriors of the Western Numinous Great Yi to guard the talisman within the Jade Palace of Great Subtlety. Those who bear this talisman command the awe of heaven and earth, rebuke the host of spirits, and ride upon radiant dragons, assuming office among the exalted immortals. When its jade-like resonance resounds, Jade Maidens attend at one’s side, Golden Perfected warriors stand guard, a thousand demons lose their sight, ten thousand ghosts are obliterated in form, the Nine Demons scatter their heads, and the Six Heavens crumble and collapse. The mysteries of the Dao reach their utmost perfection; the spirits gather the Five Numinous Powers. To the left, the Dark Lads howl; to the right, the Golden Dawn is seized. How great is this treasure-text! How majestic the true might of the Great Thearch! It is not merely for warding off venom or dispelling trials, nor solely for destroying demons—it is the wondrous instrument for attaining immortality and the supreme standard for achieving perfection.

Forty-seven Jade Lads and forty-seven Jade Maidens attend the scribe, safeguarding the bodies of those who possess the scriptures. Those who uphold the talisman and follow its statutes ascend to the Three Clarities.

Should one violate or disdain the celestial texts or transmit them to unworthy recipients, their body shall enter the winds and fires, and their seven generations of ancestors shall endure eternal torment in the Water Bureau.

**The Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch of Great Subtlety**

The Golden Tiger True Talisman on the right was transmitted by the Heavenly Thearch of Great Subtlety to the Thearch of the Golden Watchtower.

Inscribed in vermilion on white silk and encased in a purple brocade pouch, it is worn upon the head while moving about. Thus, one commands the awe of the spirits of heaven and earth; immortals and transcendents bow in reverence. Jade Maidens hold towels at the ready, Celestial Soldiers guard the body, and the mountains and peaks prostrate their essences.

When combined with the incantation of divine might and the chapters of the Jade Clarity, one may behead the Nine Demons and obliterate a thousand demons in form.

This is a forbidden talisman of the Shangqing canon, not transmitted to the world. Those who obtain and wear it ascend to the Shangqing heaven.

**The Inner Incantation of the Golden Perfected’s Numinous Might of the Primordial Radiance of the Most High**, used to command and summon divine soldiers to behead and annihilate evil ghosts:

Upon entering the chamber, burn incense, knock the teeth together thirty-six times, and sit or recline as one wishes. Then recite the incantation:

*"Expel the Toxic King of Qian, the Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo,
The Eight Immortals wield their halberds, the Five Numinous Powers of the Thearch,
The Supreme Mystery’s Radiance Falls, seven spirits guard the court,
The Yellow Perfected’s luminous talisman, resplendent with fire-bells cast,
The spirit-tigers bristle their manes, venomous blades wildly advance,
The Purple Flourishing Pattern of Rites, the Four Quaking Ones cry out in reverence,
The Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, the Four Great Ones gleam with brilliance,
Externally entwined with primordial qi, internally guarded by the master’s soldiers,
To the left, awe-inspiring; to the right, vigilant—wind strikes, fire marches,
Rebuke and behead the ten thousand demons, shatter and decapitate the thousand spirits,
The Golden Perfected’s might resounds, the Nine Demons are seized in form,
The Northern Feng is overthrown, all that is destroyed collapses,
I bear the true talisman, command the myriad spirits,
The Three Primes declare the truth, the Mysterious unites with the Thearch’s sincerity,
The Supreme Mandate of Great Subtlety, ascending to the Three Clarities."*

---

The methods of the *Inner Incantation of the Numinous Might of the Supreme Radiance of the Great Primordium* are all forbidden scriptures of the Shangqing canon.

*"Expel the Toxic King"* refers to the inner name of the great ghost of the Six Heavens.
*"The Banner of Zhen-Shi-Luo"* is the hidden appellation of the Demon King of the Northern Thearch.
*"The Four Great Ones gleam with brilliance"* are the soul-names of the ghost-ministers of the Northern Feng.

Those who know the names of these three ghosts cause a thousand demons to flee in terror, ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms, the Nine Demons to be unable to move or test them, and the hundred evils to be incapable of inflicting harm. Whether dwelling alone in the mountains and forests or amidst the spirits and ghosts of temples and shrines, one may proceed with affairs directly, without the need to burn incense or enter a chamber.

**Annual Primordium** is inscribed in yellow on a white ground.

**The Five Bells Ascending Void Step-Spirit Protective Talisman of Immortality**, also called *Fire Bells*.
At the inception of the Celestial August Emperor of the Grand Tenuity’s reception of qi, when the mysterious constellations first divided, He ascended the Nine Profound Void-Life Terrace. The divine officials of the Five Thearchs guarded the eight directions; the five talismans shimmered in the void, now present, now absent, veiling the Phoenix Terrace above, within the winding chambers of the Jade Palace. After seven thousand years, their scripture manifested.

Its radiance streams through the nine skies; its text glows resplendent in the Jade Purity. Cast left, it becomes the *Flowing Gold Fire Bells*; shaken right, it crowns the *Seven Primordials of Liberation*. It subjugates the demons of the farthest heavens, its might spreading through the courts of the nine auroras. This is the ultimate and wondrous Dao, subtle and profound beyond measure.

The August Emperor then purified himself in the *Jade Terrace Cavern-True Hall* of the Great Void, within the *Jade Chamber Golden Flower Abode*. Attending him were a multitude of perfected maidens, the five-colored divine officials, ten billion myriad beings, flying beasts and venomous dragons flanking the gates, colossal serpents a thousand fathoms long guarding the walls. Phoenixes sang and dragons roared; a hundred melodies resounded through the halls. His majesty filled the vast courtyard; lions roared, and the assembled hosts chanted celestial hymns. Jade echoes flowed like scattered gems; divine consorts harmonized in song, while jade maidens plucked the strings and struck the zithers.

Thereupon, I summoned the Central Yellow Venerable Lord and the Four Perfected Ones of the Grand Ultimate. We set forth the *Flowing Auroral Nectar*, the *Unbreakable Fruits*, the *Crimson Trees with White Seeds*, and the *Intertwined Hidden Mushrooms*. A profusion of fragrances filled the air for ninety days.

Then the Tortoise Mother held the brush, the Grand Unity swept the mat, the Heavenly Consorts tended the incense, and the Jade Maidens bound the scrolls. The text was inscribed in gold upon white jade slips and entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealed in a pouch of *Jade Peak Cloud-Brocade*. It was then transmitted to the Central Yellow Venerable Lord, who, in accordance with the covenant, received the five talismans, bowed his head, and withdrew. Immediately, the *Nine Numinous Flowing Radiance Cloud Chariot* arrived, bearing fifty thousand five-colored divine officials clad in *Flying Azure Kingfisher Feather Dragon Mantles*, ascending to the *Golden Portal Jade Purity Palace*.

Should one inscribe this text upon the Eastern Florescence and behold its scripture, one’s destiny shall align with immortality. Wearing the talisman while traveling, the myriad spirits shall come to pay homage. Exiting the void and entering the emptiness, one may traverse the peaks of the Five Marchmounts, command the movements of the Five Stars, and generate water and fire within the body, transforming in all ten directions. After wearing it for nine years, green elixir shall descend, allowing one to ascend and pay homage to the Three Primordials, attaining rank in the Jade Purity. This Dao is arcane and wondrous; it is not transmitted to the untrue. To recklessly disclose its passages is to invite the dissolution of one’s body and the ruin of one’s form.

In accordance with the *Ordinances of Mysterious Perfection and Luminous Clarity*, this transmission is granted but once every seven thousand years. To violate the covenant or betray the oath brings calamity upon the Seven Mysteries, extending to one’s person and former masters, consigning all to the ranks of the lower dead, beset by ten torments and eight adversities.

**Azure Emperor’s Verdant Radiance Flowing Bell Ascending Void Step-Through Talisman**
To the east: the Azure Emperor, Primordial Cavern’s Radiant Illumination and Luminous Extension Sovereigns, each attended by nine thousand; ninety Azure Yang Jade Lads stand to the left of the scripture, while the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount Mount Tai, numbering two thousand four hundred, and ninety Azure Essence Jade Maidens stand to its right, guarding the talisman-adorned body of the Florescence Immortal.

**Vermilion Emperor’s Cinnabar Thunder Flowing Bell Ascending Void Step-Through Talisman**
To the south: the Vermilion Emperor, Great Cavern’s Primordial Life and Grand Numinous Mechanism Sovereigns, each attended by eight thousand; eighty Crimson Palace Jade Lads stand to the left of the scripture, while the immortals of the Southern Marchmount Mount Heng, numbering two thousand four hundred, and eighty Great Cinnabar Vermilion Jade Maidens stand to its right, guarding the talisman-adorned body of the Florescence Immortal.

**White Emperor’s Pristine Radiance Flowing Bell Ascending Void Step-Through Talisman**
To the west: the White Emperor, Golden Citadel’s Radiant Primordial and Grand Conduction Sovereigns, each attended by six thousand; sixty Radiant Numinous Transfiguration Jade Lads stand to the left of the scripture, while the immortals of the Western Marchmount Mount Hua, numbering two thousand four hundred, and sixty Pristine Jade Maidens stand to its right, guarding the talisman-adorned body of the Florescence Immortal.

**Black Emperor’s Verdant Radiance Flowing Bell Ascending Void Step-Through Talisman**
To the north: the Black Emperor, Mysterious Cavern’s Primordial Yin and Fivefold Luminous Extension Sovereigns, each attended by five thousand; fifty Grand Mechanism Supreme Ultimate Jade Lads stand to the left of the scripture, while the immortals of the Northern Marchmount Mount Heng, numbering two thousand four hundred, and fifty Great Mystery Jade Maidens stand to its right, guarding the talisman-adorned body of the Florescence Immortal.

**Yellow Emperor’s Azure Radiance Flowing Bell Ascending Void Step-Through Talisman**
At the center: the Yellow Emperor, Central Luminance’s Five Yang and Five Yin Central August Cavern Ultimate High Sovereigns, each attended by one thousand two hundred; twelve Grand Mechanism Loyalty Jade Lads stand to the left of the scripture, while the immortals of the Central Marchmount Mount Song, numbering two thousand four hundred, and twelve Yellow Essence Jade Maidens stand to its right, guarding the talisman-adorned body of the Florescence Immortal.

Men take azure as their ground, inscribing the script in cinnabar and wearing it on the left; women take yellow as their ground, inscribing the script in white and wearing it on the right.

Five-colored brocade, fifty feet of each, is offered to summon the Five Emperor Immortals. Five taels of purple gold serve as tokens of oath for the Five Directions. Five catties of aloeswood ascend as incense to the Three Primordials’ palaces. One catty of true cinnabar is used for the covenant’s vermilion oath. A single scribing knife severs the path of deathly qi. Seven golden pearls are offered to invoke the essence of the Seven Primes. Seventy feet of crimson silk serve as tokens of blazing radiance.

The recipient of the talisman scripture must present these tokens to the master, observe a three-day purification fast, bathe, burn incense, and inscribe the talisman and scripture, leaving them exposed upon the high altar for one night. At dawn, master and disciple ascend the altar together, petition the Northern Emperor, initiate the covenant, and transmit the talisman scripture to the disciple.

Without ascending the altar to make the oath, one must not recklessly open the scripture’s passages. Should the master lightly disclose the scripture’s text, his body shall suffer the trials of the wind-knife. Should the disciple receive it yet unroll the scroll, calamity shall strike the Seven Mysteries, and his body shall be maimed, his eyesight lost.

The statutes of the Four Poles forbid the reckless disclosure of the scripture’s text. The statutes of the Grand Perfected forbid transmission without covenant tokens. Unless one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade registers, one may not hear or behold it.

For those who seek immortality: without the Five Talismans worn upon the body, the immortals of the Five Marchmounts shall not guard one’s form, the Three Offices’ ghostly ledgers shall not strike one’s name from the rolls of the dead, and dwelling in mountain caves, one shall be undone by the Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens. Moving among humankind, one shall not escape the disasters of magistrates, blades, and weapons.

Those who obtain and wear them may tread the heavens and traverse the abyss, roaming boundlessly in all directions, moving and turning at will. By visualizing the true spirits, one returns to one’s original palace, where the Five Mushrooms spontaneously grow, the body shines with jade radiance, immortals guard and protect, the Three Primordials visit one’s chamber, and one rides the clouds, steering the void to ascend to the Jade Purity.

One hundred days after receiving the talisman, take five five-inch paulownia boards and inscribe the talisman upon each. Also inscribe five memorial tablets, recording: the year, month, first day, and hour; the commandery, village, and hamlet; the name of the Marchmount master and the recipient; the recipient’s age; and the recipient’s affiliation as a child of a particular emperor and marchmount. Bury the tablets with the talismans at the Five Marchmounts.

At the moment of burial, knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:
*"Above, I petition the August Jade Emperor of the Three Primordials; below, I report to the immortals of the Five Marchmounts and Five Colors. Having received the true words of the Flowing Bell Five Talismans, I observe a purification fast with five incenses, record my name upon the mountains and rivers, and request the true immortals to come and guard my form. May the Five Mushrooms—yellow, black, white, red, and azure—flow forth; may water and fire arise within my body; may the fire bells gleam and fall; may the dragon reins lead me to my chamber; and may I ascend to the Jade Court."*

Thereupon, the immortals of the Five Directions shall guard one’s body, bestowing the divine and true Dao, allowing one to wander the Five Marchmounts and seas, where the hundred spirits shall come to pay homage.

When the fire bells resound, inwardly visualize the mighty incantation of divine wisdom. Wearing the flowing golden fire bells, one may travel near or far, traversing perilous passes, bandit-infested regions, and plague-stricken lands, or enduring calamities. Visualize the true radiance to guard oneself, opening a path of ten thousand leagues.

At the outset of a journey, face directly toward the intended direction, knock the left teeth fourteen times, and swallow qi thirty-six times. Then visualize the destination’s forms and features—mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, birds, beasts, and spirits—all clearly and distinctly coming to pay homage to one’s body.

Visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper covering one’s head. Then visualize one’s left eye as a shooting star and one’s right eye as swift lightning, their radiance blazing and surging ninety thousand leagues away, illuminating the path ahead. Mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, dwellings, soldiers, bandits, ghosts, and qi shall all be dispelled, leaving no trace, the four roads swept clean.

Recite the incantation:
*"Ahead opens, behind closes; heaven levels, earth tilts. The divine lord sets forth, the four roads open wide. May heaven and earth become my bridge, the front and back, left and right, penetrating the eight directions. My left casts the shooting star, my right hurls lightning’s glare; their essence flows ten thousand leagues—what demon dares stand before me? The Great Unity escorts me, the myriad spirits welcome me. Wherever I go, wherever I turn, all shall be auspicious and good. Riding the clouds, steering the void, I ascend to the Great Emptiness."*

When finished, draw back the essence of both eyes, returning each to its palace. Take seven qi from the left and seven qi from the right, swallowing them completely. Thus may one brave peril and traverse danger, strike down ghosts and vanquish soldiers—none shall fail to respond, their echoes scattering like dust. This method is most wondrous, not to be transmitted in writing; it is passed mouth to mouth, with utmost clarity and care. According to the Mysterious Statutes, it may be transmitted but once every seven hundred years.

The Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells and Five Talismans command the demons of the utmost heavens, summon and bind the spirits of the five directions. Above, they correspond to the five stars; they align with the seven origins and, below, harmonize with the human body—its nine apertures and seven luminaries—encompassing heaven and earth, leaving nothing unconnected. No depth is too obscure to fathom, no detail too fine to discern. When the talisman is visualized, its light appears; when cast, its numinous power stirs. You shall wear it, receiving the master’s oral transmission.

Should you encounter a place haunted by evil ghosts in the human realm, perform the Great Invocation of Tremendous Might. Face north, hold your breath for twelve cycles, and visualize the qi of the five directions enveloping your body inside and out, plunging all into darkness so that nothing is seen. Then strike your left teeth thirty-six times, swallowing the qi of the five directions—three swallows for each, until every breath is exhausted and wholly absorbed into your body. Visualize the youths in your eyes, their light like shooting stars, blazing across the five directions, and recite:

*"Heavenly Origin’s Seven Essences, Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells, flashing and hurling lightning’s glare like celestial shooting stars, illuminating the ten directions to reveal the true forms of ghosts—what petty demon dares stand before my Gate of Life? The Great Emperor has decreed: none shall be spared, their livers carved and bellies split, their ghostly essence annihilated. Thousands upon thousands shall be crushed, myriads upon myriads overthrown. The divine might of my incantation binds the registers without cease."*

Then swallow qi thirty-six times to conclude. With this single invocation, the divine officials of the five directions shall dispatch armored soldiers and commanded troops, binding all spirits in the register’s domain and delivering them to your court. Three invocations shall extinguish the very lineage of ghostly qi.

When entering the Five Peaks or traversing mountains and rivers, braving perilous cliffs and towering heights, you must, a hundred paces from your destination, strike your left teeth thirty-six times. If approaching the Eastern Peak, visualize the Azure Emperor, Lord Xilin Zhu, with his retinue of nine thousand, guarding your front, back, and sides, their azure mist enveloping your body. If approaching the Southern Peak, visualize the Vermilion Emperor, Lord Danxuan Zi, with his retinue of eight thousand, guarding your front and back, their crimson clouds covering your body. If approaching the Western Peak, visualize the White Emperor, Lord Shaohao Ling, with his retinue of six thousand, guarding your front and back, their pale mist enveloping your body. If approaching the Northern Peak, visualize the Black Emperor, Lord Xuanming, with his retinue of five thousand, guarding your front and back, their dark clouds covering your body. If approaching the Central Peak, visualize the Yellow Emperor, Lord Zhizhong Yuan, with his retinue of twelve thousand, guarding your front and back, their yellow qi enveloping your body. When finished, recite:

*"The luminous numen of Qian Heaven, the Seven Dawns’ Mysterious Essence, the Five Dipper’s Florid Canopy encircling my form, the five-hued flying mists merging and intertwining—my body bears the Seven Origins, the Flowing Golden Fire Bells, flashing and hurling toward the northern reaches, the utmost heavens’ gloom. The divine officials of the Five Emperors wield their celestial troops, capturing and restraining for me the mountains and rivers, the earth gods, the thousand ghosts and myriad spirits, all bound and presenting their true forms, slain before and behind, seized without cease."*

When finished, with this single invocation, the heavenly demons shall vanish without trace, and the myriad spirits shall come to pay homage. As you wander the Five Peaks and traverse mountains and rivers, no trials or perils shall befall you; the immortals of the Five Peaks shall themselves present you with the Five Fungi and Jade Flowers to nourish your body.

If caught amidst military rebels, beneath the blades of officials, or in dire straits, strike your right teeth twelve times. Visualize the Seven Dippers covering your body, their mysterious light shining brightly, encircling you entirely. Visualize your liver as Jupiter, emerging to your left; your lungs as Venus, emerging to your right; your heart as Mars, emerging before you; your kidneys as Mercury, emerging behind you; and your spleen as Saturn, emerging above your chest. Let the essence of the five stars entwine your front and back, your body dwelling within the Dipper’s bowl, beneath the five stars. Next, visualize the divine officials of the Five Emperors guarding your left and right, and recite:

*"Heaven is my roof, earth my bed; the Five Peaks and mountains and rivers are my bridges and beams. The Mysterious Dipper’s primordial essence is my raiment; I conceal myself within the Seven Origins, the realm of flowing fire. Those who measure me are the Great Unity and Wuzhou; those who pass me are Baiyuan and Wuying. Disasters cannot assail me, blades cannot wound me. May my body ascend to the Golden Gates, the capital of the Nine Elders."*

When finished, even in the depths of distress or at the brink of death, you shall attain deliverance.

The *Dongzhen Taiwei Jinhu Zhenfu* concludes.
