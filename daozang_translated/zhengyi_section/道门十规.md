**The Ten Precepts of the Daoist Path**
*By the Daoist Master Zhang Yu-chu, who succeeded the lineage of the Contained Dao of No-Action and inherited the luminous teachings of the True Person.*

I have humbly heard that the Sage established the divine Dao as his teaching, and the Most High (太上) took the principle of *wuwei* (non-action) as his core. His vast and profound exposition has, since the beginningless dust-sage cycle (尘劫), become ever more resplendent and evident. Though its branches may be divided into the Three Treasures of Dao (道), Scripture (经), and Master (师), its origin stems from the Most High (太上) transmitting the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Its Virtue* (道德五千言) to Lord Guan of the Han (关令尹). This is the essence of *wuwei* (non-action) and non-contention.

In the early days of the Shang and the Three Dynasties (殷三代), Guangchengzi (广成子) was granted the Dao by the Yellow Emperor (黄帝) at the Kunlun Mountains (崆峒), ascending in rank even further. Thus, the foundation of the Dao comes from the Most High (太上) alone.

Those who cultivate the Dao within themselves and embody the *Inner Sage, Outer King* (合夫内圣外王之道) are represented by the surviving words of the Masters Guan, Wen, Zhuang, and Lie (关、文、庄、列诸子). Those who govern the world and demonstrate the transformation of *Qingjing Wuwei* (清静无为, serene non-action) are embodied in the virtuous policies of Master Gai (盖公) and General Cao (曹参).

When our ancestor, the Celestial Master (天师), established the teaching in the Eastern Han (东汉), and the Immortal Master Ge (葛仙公) and Xu Jingyang (许旌阳) propagated their lineages in the Wu and Jin (吴晋), the Dao was divided into the two schools of *Zhengyi* (正一, Orthodox Unity) and *Quanzhen* (全真, Complete Reality). Its methods were categorized into *Qingwei* (清微, Pure Subtlety), *Lingbao* (灵宝, Numina of the Spirit), and *Leiting* (雷霆, Thunderous Wrath). Without tracing the origin to seek the flow, one must inevitably forget the root to follow the branches.

Yet, the flourishing of our Dao reached its zenith in the Song and Yuan dynasties (宋元). But it was only in our present dynasty that, by the grace of the Most High Emperor Taizu (太祖高皇帝), the *Dao De Jing* (上下经, *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*) was annotated and established as the supreme model for the Daoist Path (道门上范). The Daoist teaching was purified and exalted to its utmost, for the Daoist Way was indeed present in the middle ages—such as the Yellow Emperor’s visit to Guangchengzi at Kunlun, the Celestial Master’s alchemical refining at Longhu (龙虎), his command over ghosts and spirits, and his mastery over calamities and disasters. Thus, through the ages, prayers and supplications have been answered, and none have been left unfulfilled.

In the first year of the Yongle era (永乐初元), I first received the imperial grace to clarify and uphold the Daoist teachings, and the favor was ever more profound. The decree was that all must follow the established constitution of the Most High Emperor (太祖成宪).

From this, it can be observed that the radiance of our Dao surpasses all that came before it!

In the summer of the Yongle fourteenth year (永乐四年夏), I was humbly granted the imperial favor to compile and revise the Daoist classics, entering the Hall of Scriptures (入阁通类) to systematize them.

Reflecting deeply, I realized that I, Zhang Yu-chu, am unworthy and lacking in virtue, my learning shallow and meager. Though I tremble in fear at this great responsibility, I dare not decline the imperial command. Twice I have received the sovereign’s edict, and twice I have been questioned in the Hall of Audience (宣室). Considering my mediocrity, my shame only grows. Yet, when I reflect on this opportunity, joy and fear intertwine.

Moreover, since the recent ages (近代), the Dao’s profound principles have declined (玄纲日坠), its transformative power has waned (道化莫敷), and though its name persists, its substance is lost (实丧名存). The Daoist lineage is in decay, its teachings neglected and abandoned. I have long harbored the aspiration to revive and uplift it (振迪之思), yet my resolve to inspire and renew (激扬之志) has not been fulfilled.

Now, under the enlightened reign of Your Majesty (圣明御极), divine wisdom governs the heavens (神睿统天), martial might is laid aside in favor of cultivation (偃武修文), and the age of peace is secured through the resolution of chaos (成功定难). The imperial virtue harmonizes with the will of Heaven (圣德合於天心), auspicious omens appear in succession (祯祥迭见); the grand design of the sovereign is trusted by all under the heavens (皇猷孚於华夏), and the Dao and its virtue flourish (道德斯昌).

This is indeed the Daoist Path’s once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity (千载一时之遇), to create an enduring model of peace for ten thousand generations (万世不湮之典).

Thus, I have diligently gathered the established precepts of former dynasties (前代定规) and the legacy of the Master Teachers (群师遗则), compiling them into *The Ten Precepts of the Daoist Path* (道门十规). My intent is to inspire and invigorate the current trends (激励流风), proclaim the sacred governance (昭宣圣治), and forever set forth a standard for all ages (奕世绳规) that the Daoist lineage may follow as its ancestral model (玄门祖述). May it be that, above, I do not betray the court’s exaltation of the Dao, and below, I provide a path for the Daoist practitioners to study and emulate (趋学之径).

Its flourishing elucidation of the *Primordial Element’s* (玄元) transformation and expansion of the *Qingjing* (清静, serene) principle will surely benefit the nation in hidden ways (阴翊邦祚) and greatly revive the teachings (大振教谟). I hold great hope for the future and trust that these precepts will endure for generations to come.

The origins and lineages of Daoist teachings trace back to before the Three Dynasties (三代之前), when the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from Guangchengzi (广成子), who was none other than the Most High (太上). Later, there was the figure who was born in the late Shang (殷末), served in the early Zhou (周初), and was the *Archival Historian* (柱下史) under King Wen (文王), later becoming the *Secretary Historian* (藏室史) under King Wu (武王). His works included the *Dao De Jing* (上下经), and his disciples included Guan, Wen, Zhuang, Lie, Kangcang (亢仓), and Bojiu (柏矩). His teachings encompassed methods of *self-cultivation* (修齐), *governing the world* (治平), *enriching the state* (富国), *strengthening the military* (强兵), *mastery over the age* (经世), and *transcending the world* (出世). These were varied yet interconnected.

As recorded by the Grand Historian (太史氏): "The Daoist school, with its singular focus on spirit and virtue, speaks broadly yet acts subtly—this is what can be known of it."

Thus, it is said that Daoism precedes the *Six Classics* (六经), and even that Daoism surpasses the *Six Classics* in its systematic principles, which would be an overstatement.

The *Lingbao* of *Yuan Shi* (元始, Primordial Beginning) originates from the *Three Qi* (三气) of the *Primordial Chaos* (混沌) at the dawn of creation. Its foundation is singular.

Later elucidations of the Dao include the propagation by our ancestor, the Celestial Master (天师), the True Lord Xu (许真君), the Immortal Master Ge (葛仙翁), and the True Lord Mao (茅真君). Though the Dao has descended through the ages (世降之久), its source is rarely investigated. Each lineage reveres its own system: the Celestial Master’s *Zhengyi* (正一), Lord Xu’s *Jingming* (净明, Pure Clarity), Master Ge’s *Lingbao* (灵宝), and Lord Mao’s *Shangqing* (上清, Supreme Purity). These are merely different names for the established teachings, all ultimately derived from the Most High (太上).

Though the transmission of *fu lu* (符箓, talismans and diagrams), scriptures (经教), fasting rites (斋品), and Daoist methods (道法) has endured through the ages, with each lineage honoring what they have heard, adding or subtracting as they see fit, the fundamental source remains one.

Inwardly, its cultivation includes the transmission of *inner* and *outer* alchemy (内外丹). Though this was not explicitly mentioned in the scriptures of the ancient Masters, the theories of cinnabar and medicinal arts (丹砂药术) speak of *refining and nurturing the body, mind, and spirit* (修炼止性命神气) to prolong life. Since the Qin and Han dynasties (秦汉), alchemists have proliferated, such as the *Five Proficiencies of Wen Cheng* (文成五利), who relied on minerals, plants, and herbs—only to destroy their bodies and invite misfortune. Thus, the world came to revile alchemical arts (方术).

Outwardly, its application involves prayers, sacrifices, and rituals (祷禬祠祝).

The teachings of Ke, Du, Ge, and Lu’s followers flourished in their day. Later masters, however, embellished and distorted them, chasing fame and profit, and the world thus labeled them as heterodox.

Yet these two paths—inner and outer—were never fully revealed by the Primordial Sage. Later scholars, failing to grasp their roots or trace their origins, strayed and lost their way, abandoning the fundamental teachings of the Way: the ineffable mystery of emptiness, stillness, non-action, and the unspeakable. All who practice the Dao must take the scriptures as their foundation, investigate their sources, and strive to return to orthodoxy, lest they be misled by heretical words and seductive speech, perpetuating delusion and betraying the ancestral tradition.

For the scriptures declare: *"The Void is naturally so; the Dao arises from it. True and undivided, its essence is profound. Round and luminous, it suffices in itself."* This is the origin of the teachings, the foundation for entering the Way, and what must be pursued above all.

The Daoist scriptures and talismans—including the Three Caverns’ texts proclaimed by the Celestial Worthies of Primordial Origin, Soul Treasure, and the Highest Moral Dao—were transmitted through the eons by sages and elucidated by masters. Among them, the Primordial Origin’s scriptures prioritize *the highest-grade teachings for guiding others*; the Soul Treasure’s emphasize *inner contemplation and observation*; and the Highest Moral Dao’s teachings center on *daily moral practice*.

For inner cultivation, the *Forty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Mystery* and the *Donggu Great Communion of Heavenly Purity* are most direct. For outer salvation and guiding the departed, the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Symbol Classic*, the *Jade Pivot’s Northern Dipper for Dispelling Calamities and Saving Suffering*, the *Five Stoves for Generating Spirits*, and the *Jade Pivot’s Nine Abysses for Morning Heaven* are all ladders to the Dao and paths to true transformation.

Thus, those who follow the Way must first revere the numinous, burn incense, chant scriptures, and take refuge in the Great Dao, abandoning present defilements and inviting auspicious causes. The scriptures say: *"All divine immortals and true persons attained the Dao through supreme essential teachings."* The Daoist masters say: *"Scriptures gather the mind; scriptures anchor the thoughts. If one can chant morning and evening without ceasing, dispelling demons and expanding Daoist karmic ties, this is indeed the foremost expedient."*

All who recite must purify body and mind, cleanse the heart and thoughts, and silently meditate with sincerity—as if addressing the Transcendent Sovereign—ensuring undivided focus, precise articulation, and harmonious breath. Only then may one achieve resonance with celestial sounds, natural harmony with divine melodies, and the power to pacify the world, transform the people, gather blessings, and dispel misfortune. Should one recite with the mouth while the heart strays, or with idle posture, even chanting thousands of volumes daily profits nothing—and how could it dispel calamities?

If reciting for others, one must maintain reverence and sincerity, honoring the patron’s devotion and fulfilling the vow of faith. Only then will the patron’s offerings truly bring merit and atone for sins. But if one speaks frivolously, laughs, or wanders in thought, reciting carelessly, not only will it fail to benefit the patron, but it will invite retribution upon oneself. Such practices must be strictly avoided.

Moreover, as time passes, scriptural errors multiply, and many texts are later masters’ annotations—often flawed. If doubts arise, one must hold fast to sincerity, avoiding association with reckless, superficial, or blasphemous figures, lest one invite ruin. As for the Highest Sage’s scriptures and talismans: those received by the Patriarchal Masters are the *Alliance of the Three Powers*; those by Ge Xianfang are the *Four Celestial Allies of the Central Alliance*; and those by Mao Zhenjun are the *Supreme Cavern of Upper Clarity*. Other talismans abound, all meant to bless the nation, enrich the people, and safeguard one’s home. Thus, those who have revered and relied on them through the ages have indeed received responses—prayers answered with signs, proving the Highest Sage’s teachings are not false.

Yet over time, errors in characters, punctuation, and transmission have arisen. Some dismiss the entire tradition, while learned masters should carefully collate, verify, and publish corrections to aid the Daoist path.

Sitting in seclusion and guarding stillness is the foundation of entering the Way. The Highest Sage established teachings to transcend illusion and awaken to birth and death. Without attaining the original nature and comprehending life and essence, what is the point of claiming to study the Dao?

The scriptures say: *"Accumulate virtuous deeds, abandon worldly desires, suppress delusion, avoid attachment, transcend being and non-being, and eternally end birth and death—this is the True Person."*

In recent times, some have treated meditation as the essence of nature, the Dao as the essence of life, and the Complete Reality as dual cultivation of nature and life, while the Orthodox Unity focuses solely on ritual practice. Yet the foundation of the Dao lies in neither nature nor life alone—though ritual itself is but an expression of their study. To cultivate oneself and benefit others, to rescue the lost and manifest the hidden, one must first clarify the roots of nature and life. Otherwise, how can one’s practices be complete?

Since ancient times, the Highest Sage has manifested through the eons, and all masters who cultivated and attained the Dao did so through stillness and concentration, thereby achieving mastery over the Dao’s powers. It was only at the dawn of the Song and Jin dynasties, when Master Wang Zhi Yang encountered the transmission of Zhong Liu, that the Complete Reality teaching was established. For the scriptures declare: *"Nurture the formless—thus the True is preserved."*

The Complete Reality teaching likewise takes seated meditation and stillness as its essence. Its Five Ancestors are the Highest Sage, Donghua, Zhong Liu, Lü Dongbin, and Hai Shen. Its Seven Saints are Qiu Chuji, Liu Huqing, Tan Xianzu, Ma Yu, Hao Qisheng, Sun Bu’er, and Wang Zhi Yang. Below them, the lineage extends to figures like Wang Chongyang and Qi Yuan. Today, those who practice this teaching are numerous, all taking genuine cultivation and authentic practice as their foundation.

When first entering the Dao, one must first select a clear teacher to pay respects to, open the mind’s ground, and earnestly uphold the Ten Precepts of True Cultivation, along with the rules of Master Bai and Master Feng. One must discipline body and mind, maintain moral integrity, and study the scriptures thoroughly. Only after understanding the path of entering the Dao does one then choose a mountain or watery retreat of purity and solid qi, establishing a hermitage with thatched roofs to shelter from wind and rain, eating field meals and sleeping under the stars, following the traces of water and clouds.

Next, one gathers Dao companions—only those of true simplicity and sincerity—morning and evening, sharing meals of coarse food and simple fare, eating from wooden bowls and drinking from gourds, merely to stave off hunger and cold. Afterward, one endures a hundred days of foundational practice, ten months of establishing the base, and three years of perfecting the embryo. Upon completion, one may either remain in meditation or emerge from stillness, yet must sever all worldly ties, extinguishing desires and severing attachments, coming and going freely.

If one comes from a family of means, they may offer alms of food and robes, taking only what is necessary, never coveting excess or fabricating extravagant claims to shock the world and seek empty fame. Repairing rags to ward off cold, begging for food and patched robes—these are the hardships of true cultivation, like withered wood and dead ashes, to temper the mind and body, lest one betray the Four Graces and bring misfortune upon the Nine Ancestors. Should one grow lax, the grass demon will obstruct.

In serving Dao companions, one must exert utmost effort, attending to their needs in sickness and health, laboring with sincerity—this is both the accumulation of one’s own merit and the completion of others’ virtues. One must not invoke Zen’s shouting and beating to argue over self and other, inviting worldly censure.

The alchemical scriptures studied include *The Stone Wall Record*, *The Dragon-Tiger Classic*, *The Canon of Supreme Unity*, *The Awakening to Reality*, *The Verdant Void*, *The Return to Source*, *The Pointing to the Mysterious*, *The Great Dao Song*, *Master Cui’s Mirror of Medicinal Entry*, *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, and the *Recorded Speeches of the Immortals*—all are the means by which mortals ascend to sainthood. One must study them with deep focus to avoid error.

False teachings and heretical doctrines must not be entertained, lest they deceive oneself and others, or worse, defame the scriptures to justify their falsehoods—such actions invite retribution in the afterlife.

The fasting rites follow the ancient sacrifices to the heavens and earth. Since the Most High Lord Lingbao received the scriptures from Yuan Shi, these have been the foundation of the teaching. Though numerous in number and vast in text, from the Three Masters of Taiji—Xu Zhenren, Ge Xian’gong, and Zheng Zhenren of Zhuyang—downward, there are Du Guangting, Ge Chaofu, Lu Dongbin, Ning Fangxiu, Xiang Shouyu, and Ke Jichen, the most renowned among them. From these, the lineages of Lin, Tian, Jin, and Bai emerged, later splitting into the East Hua and Nanchang schools. Though their branches differ, their source is one. Thus, their talismans, seals, incantations, and formulas are not far apart—these are the later masters’ virtues, each establishing their own schools to guide future generations. There is no second Dao beyond these.

The world transmits texts like *The Three Arrow Scriptures*, *The Golden Book and Jade Mirror*, *The Dao Gate’s Defined Rules*, and *The Established Rites*—these are the fixed regulations. All who practice must broadly consult and deeply study them, clarifying the roots of nature and life, accumulating genuine merit through authentic deeds.

When performing rites, one must fast, dress in ceremonial attire, purify oneself, and first refine the self before guiding the soul. One must fast and abstain to commune with the numinous, severing worldly distractions and refining form and spirit. Without proper talismans or written charms, one must not act recklessly. During altar rites and morning salutations, one must gather sincerity with utmost devotion, setting an example for others, lest one fail to move heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods, or incur suffering in the underworld.

The Three Arrow rites are thus: the Golden Arrow is for emperors alone, the Jade Arrow for empresses, and the Yellow Arrow for commoners. Each must follow their proper rank—no transgression of these rules is allowed. One must adhere strictly to the established rites of the Founding Emperor, guarding them as the standard. No alteration, addition, or omission of talismans, charms, or ritual texts is permitted.

The altar arrangements and ritual procedures must align with yin and yang, following the cosmic order—nothing may be constructed arbitrarily. If one does not take solemn fasting and reverence as the foundation, but instead indulges in noisy drums, dazzling banners, frivolous speech, or careless movements, how can one properly address the transcendent and communicate with the Three Realms? Such actions will not only fail to summon blessings but will instead invite guilt and sin.

As the saying goes: *"Ghosts and gods do not constantly accept offerings—they accept only from the sincere. Sincerity summons the numinous; this truth is clear."* Thus, even reeds from marshes or humble water plants may be offered to ghosts and gods, presented to the Most High. This is why high-ranking alchemical masters must select pure, virtuous, and knowledgeable companions to join them on the altar—lest they bring misfortune upon themselves or fail to atone for the ritual host. Beyond the ritual’s music, no other instruments like gongs, drums, bells, or chimes should be used, lest they profane the sacred.

As for figures like Zhao Yiguang and Lin Xingxu, though occasionally honored by rulers, they grew arrogant with wealth and power, losing sight of the master-subject relationship, indulging in extravagant claims, and failing to maintain humility and frugality—thus inviting censure from their contemporaries and posterity. This serves as a stern warning.

The transmission of Dao/Way’s law begins with **Qingwei** (清微), which originated with **Yuanshi Tianzun** (元始天尊, the Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Origin). **Shenxiao** (神霄), the celestial realm, began with **Yuqing Zhenwang** (玉清真王, the True King of Jade Purity). Since its transmission across the ages, **Qingwei** has flourished from **Weizu** (魏祖, Master Wei) and his second disciple onward, with masters **Zhu** (朱), **Li** (李), **Nan** (南), and **Huang** (黄) continuing its propagation. Even now, its teachings—**fuzhang** (符章, talismans and diagrams), **jingdao** (经道, scriptural methods), **zhai fa** (斋法, ritual fasting), and **lei fa** (雷法, thunder methods)—remain most abundant in **Huangshan** (黄师, Master Huang)’s lineage.

**Shenxiao** has likewise thrived from **Wang** (汪) and **Wang** (王) the second masters onward, with disciples such as **Zhang** (张), **Li** (李), **Bai** (白), **Sa** (萨), **Pan** (潘), **Yang** (杨), **Tang** (唐), and **Mo** (莫) expanding its reach. Their teachings on **tianlei** (天雷, celestial thunder) and **Dingyue** (酆岳, the realm of the Lord of the Underworld) were passed down through successive lineages, sometimes with multiple branches diverging from a single master or differing talismans and incantations within one branch. Thus, many falsehoods and contradictions—where truth is obscured and heresy prevails—arise, leading to mutual slander and confusion among practitioners.

All who practice must first uphold strict discipline, then earnestly pursue study. They must seek a refined master in secluded valleys, one who lives in humble attire and simple fare, who reveals the fundamental roots of all teachings and diligently tends the sacred incense. Such a practitioner should adhere to but one method, one scripture, and one lineage.

If one can morning and evening refine the spirit and nurture the **qi**, never slacking in practice, and maintain harmonious conduct with the divine, without guilt or remorse, how could the Dao/Way fail to manifest? Even if one’s lineage is humble and their methods few, they will still bear fruit. But if one merely seeks empty fame and fleeting gains, chasing worldly recognition, they will inevitably follow the trend of the age, boast hollow titles, and neglect the sacred incense. Though they may wear many scriptures and hold lofty ranks, they are no better than merchants burdened with goods—pursuing grandeur in appearance while ignoring the true essence of the Dao/Way. They indulge in wine and food, cultivate pride and resentment, and behave no differently from ordinary street sorcerers and fortune-tellers.

They never reflect on the divine, yet they boast of the efficacy of their talismans, calling others to their false teachings, merely inciting them with empty rhetoric. Worse still, they exploit the Dao/Way to deceive masters and entice disciples, demanding offerings of wine and food under the guise of gratitude, betraying the sincerity of prayer and deeply straying from proper doctrine.

They also presumptuously claim to be teachers, leading the blind with their own blindness, lacking merit in practice while embroiling themselves in strife and controversy—this is a grave offense.

True practitioners of high virtue must solely strive for emptiness and stillness, with no thoughts arising and all distractions extinguished. Their **xingtian** (性天, inherent nature) aligns with the Dao/Way, their **xin di** (心地, mind-ground) resonates like thunder. They do not dwell in the traps of worldly attachments but seek the ultimate truth of the highest lineage—these are the highest among practitioners.

Moreover, they must reject false doctrines such as **yuan guang fuhuang** (圓光附體, the False Illumination of Round Light), **jiangzhang fujing** (降將附箕, the False Descending Generals), and **fuyan zhaoshui** (扶鸾照水, the False Spirit Tablet and Mirror Writing), which are unworthy of those who uphold the true **zhengfa** (正法, orthodox teaching). They must not conceal or propagate heretical words to mislead the masses and harm the Dao/Way.

All who practice talismans and medicinal arts must do so with compassionate intent, combining **dansha** (丹砂, cinnabar and sulfur) and **yaoshu** (药术, pharmaceutical methods) for the benefit of others. They must not arbitrarily accept offerings, lest they incur the wrath of ghosts and gods, rendering their methods ineffective.

They must also refrain from indiscriminately teaching the Dao/Way or carelessly revealing its mysteries. Even among those who have entered the Dao/Way or revere its teachings, if their conduct is unrefined and they neglect the sacred incense, they should be treated with caution and not entrusted with transmission. How much more so for butchers and fishermen of the marketplace, who, driven by profit and the desire for fame, readily accept disciples, spreading idle falsehoods and inviting their own retribution—guilt that cannot be absolved.

**Zhuhu lingxiu** (住持领袖, abbots and leaders):
All abbots of sacred mountains, blessed lands, tranquil hermitages, or monasteries and temples—whether appointed by imperial decree or chosen from within—must be aged and virtuous masters of upright character, whose conduct is dignified and whose knowledge is profound. They should serve as models for the monastic community and be worthy of reverence in blessed lands, thus guiding future generations and establishing precedents for those who came before.

Those who dwell there must be compassionate, frugal, and of expansive virtue, maintaining strict and fair rules. First, they must establish methods for welcoming and guiding the ignorant; second, they must carefully attend to the duties of incense offerings and rituals, seeking blessings and atoning for sins.

No greater benefit exists for a nation than repaying its roots; no greater devotion exists than sincerely expounding the scriptures.

In nurturing the community, strict discipline and rules must be enforced first, with warnings of karmic consequences for guilt and merit. The management of fields and grain stores should be entrusted to responsible stewards, while taxes and offerings must be fulfilled according to their due. Food and lodging for the community must be carefully administered, and all should hold the divine in reverence, morning and evening, with diligent maintenance of the sacred halls.

Across the five lakes and four seas, high-ranking **yushi** (羽士, Daoist adepts) may sometimes dwell temporarily, either in winter or summer, with a single **zhikang** (知堂, hall of understanding) provided for their lodging. They should be warmly received with simple food and coarse robes, settled according to their circumstances, so that their bodies and mouths remain at ease, their minds free from worry. Thus, they can advance in the Dao/Way without concern, their hearts undisturbed. Even those who practice with utmost austerity should still be given sufficient provisions.

For **danshi** (檀施, lay offerings) and acts of charity, they should follow their means, whether establishing a ritual fasting or performing **jiao** (醮, exorcistic rites) to honor ancestors or guide the deceased. They must adhere strictly to the ritual codes, fulfilling both great and small acts of benefit without discriminating by the generosity of the offering.

The scriptures say: *All blessings arise from joy; all acts of giving come from a joyful heart; all kinds of virtuous fruits bring boundless rewards.*

For visiting officials and noble guests, they should be offered one meal in plain attire, and if they stay overnight, they must not interfere with public duties or be detained, lest they provoke disputes.

On the first and fifteenth of each lunar month, they must proclaim the teachings and warnings, inspiring and exhorting the community. They must uphold the traditions of their own lineage and fulfill the ultimate purpose of their sect, never coveting wealth or indulging in frivolity. They must not compete in imitating worldly extravagance—fine clothing, lavish food, grand halls, and fine carpets—while neglecting public affairs for private gain. They must not enter or exit on horseback, surrounded by attendants, nor associate with powerful figures, lest they corrupt the teachings, taint the source, and foul the flow. Worst of all, they may indulge in sensual pleasures, masking hypocrisy with outward piety, and disregard the sacred incense, divine presence, spirit altars, and ancient sites, harboring secular attachments and defiling the gods.

All subordinate abbots must be registered with the authorities, and if they violate the rules, they must be expelled from the mountain. No one should be allowed to act in ignorance or favoritism, lest they undermine the sect’s laws.

「Thus, those who later enter the Daoist path but fail to follow its precepts, who are frivolous and disrespectful, unaccustomed to the sect’s teachings—if they persist in arrogance and self-destruction, bringing guilt upon themselves—then they must be expelled according to the *Lü* (律, monastic regulations), so that the strictures of discipline may be upheld, the teachings proclaimed, and order restored. If, however, they are granted leniency, their transgressions must be met with equal punishment.

In recent times, local Daoist *liáo* (寮, lodges) in prefectures and counties have yet to conform to proper decorum, and their moral frameworks remain lax. Those entrusted with rectifying this must strictly adhere to established rules.

For those who wander among the *yúnshuǐ* (云水, wandering ascetics) in search of instruction, all who take the *chūjiā* (出家, monastic vow) must sever ties with their parents above and descendants below, seeking to transcend the dusty world and escape mortal bonds. Their resolve must be to awaken from illusion and comprehend the nature of birth and death. If they falter and remain entangled in worldly snares, ceaselessly toiling without end, how do they differ from the common folk?

The *sūtra* (经) teaches: *"The practitioner of the Dao must take purity and stillness as their foundation. To behold false paths is to confront an enemy; to distance oneself from attachments and desires is to shun filth. To uproot the roots of suffering and sever the ties of affection is the way."*

Therefore, after taking the monastic vow, one must renounce emotions and cut away attachments, abandoning delusion to return to truth. Their primary duty must be to illuminate the mind’s essence and cultivate the innate nature, refining precepts and conduct, tempering body and spirit. With only a simple hat and a begging bowl, they must dwell as solitary clouds and wild cranes. Should they encounter eminent mountains and sacred grottoes, they may settle there with humility, seeking out enlightened masters to question and true teachers to follow. They must probe the fundamental principles of life and death, delve deeply into the essence of *Dào* (道) and *Dé* (德, virtue/power), penetrate the teachings of the sect, savor the *Fǎ* (法, dharma) as nourishment, and not be swayed by fame or enticed by wealth.

Though they endure hunger, cold, heat, and hardship, they must not waver in their resolve; though they face poverty and toil, they must not abandon their aspiration. Enduring insults and concealing impurities, they must conduct themselves with modesty and gentleness, adopting humility in bearing and fortitude in discipline. Their spirit must be pure, their heart yielding, yet their nature steadfast. They must dwell in secluded mountain forests and caves where human traces are rare, wearing coarse robes and eating simple fare to sustain themselves, and living in rustic dwellings to uphold the Dao. Each must follow their teacher’s guidance and refine their original nature.

When they venture forth in search of instruction, they must endure wind and rain, cold and hunger, carrying patched sandals, a staff, a bundle, and a begging bowl. They must not fear distant journeys of ten thousand *lǐ* (里, miles), but strive to enter the gates of great masters. A single word of insight may bring enlightenment, and the fruits of eons may be realized in an instant.

Thus, in all their comings and goings, they must strictly follow the monastic rules of the esteemed *Bái Zǔshī* (白祖师), *Féng Zūntīng* (冯尊师), and all other masterly precepts of the *cónglín* (丛林, monastic community). For any transgressions, they must accept the prescribed punishments.

If someone lacks genuine awakening, true accumulated merit, or clear insight into their innate nature—if they have not purged their defilements but merely seek to elevate themselves by teaching others—then they must be chosen with caution. One may not blindly chase empty reputation, curry favor with the influential, or covet worldly gain. If they neglect the actual cultivation of the Dao, their prior efforts will be wasted, and their karmic obstacles will remain.

As for those who gather as *péngxiá yǒu* (朋霞友, fellow Daoists), they must first align in aspiration and harmony with the Dao before they can avoid generating *móshí* (魔识, demonic perception) and together fulfill their *dàoyuàn* (道愿, Daoist vows). They must select their companions wisely and guard against impropriety, for this is itself a form of self-discipline.

If a teacher or fellow Daoist is found who steadfastly practices austerity, benefits all beings, and liberates those lost in obscurity, then serving them in the three realms and transcending the eight extremes will not be difficult.

The primary duty of a monastic is to establish *guān* (观, meditation) and guide others. All eminent mountains, sacred grottoes, blessed lands, and ancient sites are places where past immortals and enlightened beings once dwelled. If one wishes to sustain the sacred incense and divine presence, they must first prioritize the liberation of others. They must select worthy families—those of pure and sincere nature—to instruct and refine.

If they indiscriminately accept unqualified disciples, some may prove unworthy, becoming reckless and corrupt. Such individuals may fail to uphold the precepts, bringing dishonor to the Daoist path and inviting ruin upon themselves and their lineage. If their origins are tainted or their conduct lowly, or if they have even suffered humiliation in their past lives, they must be especially cautious.

Only when a truly qualified individual is found should they be admitted to the monastic rolls, with seniority determined by age. They must not show favoritism or neglect proper records, lest they disrupt the order.

When assembled for examination, they must recite the Daoist classics with fluency and mastery. The monastic registers must be meticulously maintained and submitted to the Daoist authorities. Only after receiving official approval and a *dùbiào* (度牒, ordination certificate) may they be formally recognized as Daoists by the court, and then may they wear the monastic cap and robes.

Once they have donned the Daoist cap and robes, they must always register with the monastic authorities, serve as the *Dōngfáng Cháng* (东房长, assistant to the head of the monastic community), and diligently uphold the precepts morning and evening. They must revere the divine presence, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. All texts of the sect’s classics, rituals of fasting and offerings (*zhāijiào* 斋醮), hymns, and sacred inscriptions must be thoroughly mastered. They must dedicate themselves to deep study, and in their daily conduct, they must practice with vigor, speaking and acting in accordance with the Dao.

If they can integrate the *xìnglǐ* (性理, nature-principles) of Confucianism, the *chánzōng* (禅宗, Zen school) of Buddhism, and the Daoist teachings into a unified whole, they will be counted among the highest practitioners.

On days of leisure, they may lead or participate in ritual services, burn incense, sweep the altars, discuss the Dao, or reflect on truth. They may also play the *qín* (琴, zither) and recite poetry to find solace, or meditate in a circular formation to delve into the Dao.

If they are called upon to perform meritorious rituals or rites, they must fast, purify themselves, and act with sincerity, strictly following the earlier teachings.

Coarse meals and simple fare—hempen bedding and coarse cloth—are the common lot of the monastic. They must not mix with the secular world, violating the rules by gambling, drinking, associating with depraved companions, or engaging in factional disputes. They must not disregard the proper order of seniority, fail in examinations, or recite hymns out of tune. They must not treat the classics as mere texts or karma as idle talk, nor indulge in obscene songs or worldly pursuits. They must not covet wealth or cling to vanity, neglecting the sect’s true traditions and undermining their ancestors’ legacy. Minor offenses may be met with reprimand and allowed to mend their ways, but grave violations must be punished by expulsion from the mountain and removal from the registers. Thus, they may serve as an inspiration for future generations and ensure the proper observance across the four quarters.

The *Jīngǔ Dìliáng* (金谷田粮, fields and grain of the Golden Valley) and other lands granted by successive emperors, or ancestral properties established by past masters’ virtue, or offerings from past and present *tánxià* (檀越, lay patrons), are all dedicated to sustaining the monastic community’s incense and lamps.»

The **common treasury halls** must appoint officials to oversee the registration and disbursement of funds. Each **hall and dormitory** should follow the established rules of the common treasury, with elders and juniors taking turns in oversight.

The **rental and tax ledgers** of the Golden Valley fields, when kept in the treasury halls, shall be managed by the **Chief Overseer and Senior Attendant**, while in the halls and dormitories, they shall be overseen by the **room leaders**. Those of lower rank shall merely follow the seniority-based rotation.

All annual taxes, temple repairs, dormitory renovations, spring and autumn sacrifices, seasonal scripture recitations, congratulations and condolences for joy and sorrow, and precautions against fire and theft—all must prioritize the sustenance of the community and long-term stability. Funds must be pooled and transparently recorded, with no private appropriation, hoarding, or unilateral expenditure. Ensure the elderly are secure and the young are content, that incense and lamps never falter, that sacrifices are timely, repairs diligent, and taxes preemptively prepared. Only then will harmony prevail, the sacred flames endure, and neither the community nor the temple face scarcity or ruin. In sickness, they must aid one another; in death, they must bury modestly. None shall exploit public funds for private gain, conceal shortages, or deceive the deities under the guise of securing livelihood. If taxes are neglected, repairs abandoned, or sacrifices neglected, leading to disputes and discord among the ranks, or worse—if theft and misconduct arise, violating the Dao’s precepts—then they shall face the wrath of Heaven and betray the patrons’ benevolence.

For offenses in the **treasury halls**, the **Abbot shall convene the assembly** to investigate and mete out punishment proportionate to the offense—either demotion or fines, with proceeds returned to the treasury. In the **halls and dormitories**, the **senior members shall convene the assembly** to adjudicate, following the same penalties as the common treasury, and report to the Abbot for collective expulsion if necessary. If officials collude to conceal misconduct for personal gain, or if seniors tolerate wrongdoing out of favoritism, they too shall be publicly exposed, and exemplary punishment shall be administered to deter others.

The **common treasury lands** must never be sold, nor may private contracts or transactions be established to fragment or alienate them. All **labor and service obligations** must adhere to established regulations, with designated **mortar-mixing Daoists** fulfilling them, lest they become entangled in corrupt practices or degenerate customs. All must exercise utmost caution—Heaven’s scrutiny is unyielding.

**Temple Maintenance and Restoration**
The sacred mountains and blessed lands, where the numinous abides and incense burns, are replete with temples built by the **Song, Yuan, and current dynasties**, erected to bless the realm and shelter the faithful. Yet after wars and devastations, many have fallen into disrepair. Every temple must maintain its **main halls, scripture halls, vegetarian halls, official residences, cloud halls, Daoist lodges, side corridors, and kitchens**—essential structures that must not be neglected.

Though some temples possess fields and grain, mismanagement by unworthy stewards—hiding taxes, embezzling funds, or even destroying statues and collapsing buildings—has become rampant. Under the pretext of tax exemptions, some have even pawned or sold temple utensils and dwellings, reducing them to ruins, or allowed them to overgrow with weeds, never tending to them. Others hoard private wealth, splitting into factions, fostering corrupt habits.

Now, by imperial grace, these **ancestral sites of true immortals and sacred altars** must be restored to their former glory. If fields yield uneven harvests or taxes persist without land, each must survey the properties, report to the authorities, and inscribe them on stone to prevent loss.

The **treasury officials** must collectively manage funds, prioritizing repairs and communal sustenance. A **direct overseer** and **treasury attendant** shall be appointed annually to oversee yearly upkeep—mending leaks, reinforcing walls, clearing paths, purifying the halls, and preserving scriptures in the groves—so that the deities have shelter and the fourfold assembly finds peace.

If temple funds prove insufficient, they may seek support through **meritorious rituals or dedicatory inscriptions**, but all must contribute. None shall exploit these names to curry favor with officials, entice merchants, or collude with bandits under false piety, lest they invite calamity upon the temple. If fields and offerings could fund repairs but are instead diverted for personal gain, or if sacred groves are wantonly desecrated for firewood, the community must expose such transgressions to the **Daoist authorities**, who shall render judgment. Only those who repent shall be readmitted. The obstinate shall be expelled, and all must strive for renewal, ensuring perpetual maintenance and upholding the ancient traditions.

Let all within the **Daoist Order** adhere to these precepts.
