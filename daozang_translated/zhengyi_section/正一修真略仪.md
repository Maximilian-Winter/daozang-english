**Zhengyi Lesser Rites of Cultivating the True: An Outline**

The *True Scripture Explained* states: "Register (籙) means record (錄)." Those who cultivate the True, having clarified the divine chamber and rectified their spirit, thereby summon the numinous spirits of Heaven and Earth, subdue demons and ghosts, and ascend the ranks of immortality according to their merits. They emerge from existence and enter non-existence, achieving long life and delivering the world, merging with the mysterious union of the Dao.

Thus, they can rescue beings from mortal peril, liberate living souls, and their towering merit and virtue arise from reverently upholding the Three Caverns’ true scriptures and the golden writs of precious registers—these are the essential ford. The register is the numinous scripture of the Most High’s divine perfected, the secret words of the multitudes of sages of the Nine Heavens. It serves to inspect and govern the officials of the Three Realms across kalpas, to guide the primordial destiny of all beings, to command the myriad ranks, to scrutinize hidden sins and blessings, and to examine and clarify merits, transgressions, good and evil, their weight and lightness. These are recorded in the texts of admonitions and proclamations, overseen through the perusal of sacred charts, and the reckoning of the solar and lunar cycles—nine and six—through the kalpas of Heaven’s Yuan.

Moreover, it summons and commands the myriad numinous spirits of Heaven and Earth, dispatching them according to merit, distinguishing the ranks of immortals, the hosts of officials, soldiers, the billions of chariots and legions of cavalry, the jade maidens and immortal youths, all arrayed in their offices and duties. Their numbers, vast as the kalpas, are inexhaustible. The Most High of the Ten Directions, the perfected multitudes of true sages, all mutually receive the transmission from master to disciple, form covenants, and receive the teachings. From the mundane, they ascend to the True, eternally preserving the Way of life, gradually attaining the highest ranks.

It is essential to follow the ordained sequence, clearly understand the hierarchy of ranks, meticulously examine the meanings and categories, and grasp their essential purport. Only then may one proceed step by step, adhering to the register’s texts, clarifying the precepts and prohibitions. How could one act carelessly? For the verification of blessings and transgressions, gains and losses, lies precisely in these texts.

Now, the divine talismans and precious registers emerge spontaneously. Thus, at the dawn of the Primordial Beginning’s Crimson Clarity kalpa, amid the chaos of primordial chaos, flying and wondrous qi coalesced in the void, forming the dragon-script chapters—this was the transformation of the Primordial Beginning’s divine honored one through the numinous and responsive qi. Therefore, the establishment of Heaven and Earth, the differentiation of the myriad transformations, all arise from the Dao’s qi and the numinous scriptures.

The scripture states: "There was never a time without the Dao, never a time without qi, never a time without scripture." From this, it is evident that the myriad numinous beings mutually rely upon one another, coexisting with transformation. Thus, we know that the immortality of the myriad numinous beings of Heaven and Earth arises from our minds. If not for our minds’ knowledge, who would comprehend the Dao of the transformations of the myriad numinous beings of Heaven and Earth?

Therefore, it is said: "Of all things in Heaven and Earth, the most numinous is humanity." How could one fail to examine this? Yet, how lamentable that those endowed with dull natures, or born in arrogant lands, remain untouched by canonical laws, ignorant of the Five Constants. How could they hear the words of the supreme sages or the wondrous Dharma of the Three Clarities? This would invite heavenly punishment.

Alas! Those blessed with both wisdom and fortune, born in an age of sagely rule, when the numinous scriptures are complete and the great Dharma may be transmitted—yet, bound by worldly attachments, they fail to believe and receive it—are no different from the foolish and obstinate. Those in the world who receive the Dao’s scriptures and precepts, and wear the register’s texts, even if they cannot yet cultivate in accordance with the ordained sequence, will not become lowly ghosts. They will not be extinguished in the cycle of rebirth but will share an affinity with the Dao. How much more so for those who personally practice it? The depth or shallowness of its efficacy lies within oneself and cannot be foretold.

Here, I briefly elucidate the essential purport of cultivating the Three Caverns’ register texts, so that one may know how the supreme divine perfected proclaim the Dharma’s teachings—their texts and methods—achieving harmony with the profoundly profound Dao.

**The Twenty-Four Ranks of the Most High’s Three-Five Orthodox Unity Covenant Might Precious Register**

"Most High" (太上) signifies the most venerable. "Most" (太) denotes the ultimate, the all-pervading. The unique honor of the Three Realms, the ultimate of the multitudes of sages—this is what is called the Dao Lord. In principle, the Heavenly Worthy, the Dao Lord, and the Venerable Lord are one, but corresponding to the stages of the Three Clarities’ manifestations, there are distinctions in their ranks and directions.

Here, in this register, it refers to the Venerable Lord, who bestowed the Orthodox Unity Covenant Might Precious Register upon the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, transmitting it to the world. It enables the transcendence of myriad calamities, the erasure from the Black Register, the summoning of ghosts and dispatching of spirits, and the advancement in the ranks of immortal offices. Thus, it is called the *Three-Five Orthodox Unity Covenant Might Precious Register*.

"Three" (三) signifies the completeness of the Three Powers. "Five" (五) is the central number of the Yellow Center, governing life and death, commanding the myriad spirits, stabilizing the human body, and securing the primordial essence. Moreover, three and five correspond to the numbers of the sun and moon, with *wu* (戊) and *ji* (己) paired with *kan* (坎) and *li* (離). Humans, endowed with the correct qi of yin and yang, the myriad images of the Three Origins and Five Movements, must all be rectified through the mind. When the mind is rectified, the spirit and essence remain unharmed, uniting with the self. Only then can one fully embody the radiance of the sun and moon, harmonize with the root of the Five Numinous Beings, and thus remain unchanged in life and death. What harm could external deviations then inflict?

Thereby, one illuminates the multitudes of yin, and the might of the register subdues the Six Bandits. This is what is called the Orthodox Unity Covenant Might for those who study the Dao. Employing these celestial perfected numinous texts and vermilion-script cloud talismans, one preserves the orthodox and true, eternally safeguarding the body’s treasure. Thus, it is called the *Precious Register*. Thereafter, one may be promoted according to merit, dispatch spirits and summon ghosts, have jade maidens attend, and immortal kitchens provide offerings. One may ride the void and tread the mist, without relying on other methods. However, due to the distractions of worldly affairs and the inability to refine the mind, the expected efficacy may not manifest.

In the past, the Heavenly Master Zhang received and transmitted these teachings, adapting their use according to cultivation. When confronting matters, one governs and commands, but the ranks and grades differ, and the names are numerous. As for cultivating the body, transcending calamities, and preserving the true and orthodox, masters have transmitted twenty-four ranks from generation to generation, corresponding to the Upper Eight Sceneries, Middle Eight Sceneries, and Lower Eight Sceneries—twenty-four qi.

Those who receive the register must first uphold the seventy-five Immortal Official Generals and seventy-five Numinous Official Generals, totaling one hundred fifty generals. This is to first rectify the human body, establishing the inner and outer ranks of the divine and numinous beings. The two ranks of immortals and spirits each possess one talisman, all part of the Most High’s divine scripture.

For all who receive the register, the myriad talismanic scripts cannot all be fully recognized, but one must act according to the prescribed methods. The explanations of talismans are separately contained in the *Three Caverns Talisman Exegesis*, though some remain undetailed; without attaining the Dao and uniting with the divine, one cannot fully comprehend them. Moreover, one must not distort them with vulgar interpretations, lest one deeply misconstrue the sagely intent.

Within the register of the two ranks of immortals and spirits and the one hundred fifty generals, there are jade lads, jade maidens, functionaries, and soldier-spirits, all of whom arise in accordance with qi. Though their positions and numbers are fixed, their transformations are boundless, truly beyond enumeration. Here, we merely provide a brief explanation of the great reckoning of yin and yang.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register of the One Hundred Fifty Immortal and Numinous Generals**

The seventy-five Immortal Officials correspond to the qi of the Three Yang: *mao* (卯), *chen* (辰), and *si* (巳). *Mao* is numbered six, *chen* five, and *si* four; multiplying these by three and five yields seventy-five. The reason for multiplying by five is that five represents the great cycle of the central *wu* (戊) and *ji* (己), the beginning and end of all things. Multiplying five by six gives thirty; five by five gives twenty-five; and five by four gives twenty. Thus, the total is seventy-five.

The Immortal Officials govern the interior, safeguarding the viscera and bowels, joints and orifices, sinews and bones, qi and blood—all matters of the body. If one avoids transgressing against the multitude of evils and does not oppose the Three Yang, the Immortal Officials will protect one, ensuring harmony of blood and qi, receptivity of the five viscera to the numinous, clarity and correctness of the spirit-chamber, and communion with the true Dao. Those who receive and wear this precious register must deeply cherish and preserve it.

The seventy-five Numinous Officials correspond to the qi of the Three Yin: *you* (酉), *xu* (戌), and *hai* (亥). *You* is numbered six, *xu* five, and *hai* four; multiplying these by three and five, as with the Three Yang, also yields seventy-five.

The Numinous Officials govern the exterior, guarding the human form, dwellings, domains, and all four boundaries. If one avoids transgressing against the multitude of evils, does not oppose the Three Yin, and preserves the Way of central harmony, the hidden and manifest will flow unimpeded, and heaven and earth will share in virtue. Those who receive and wear this numinous scripture, performing purification rites and invocations at the proper times, may summon the Numinous Officials, functionaries, spirit-lads, and jade maidens to serve their bodies. They may journey beyond the Eight Seas to seek wondrous medicines, soaring with the immortals to the grotto-heavens and numinous mountains. When merits are complete, they may ascend to the rank of Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, appointed by the Most High. How can one who receives the Dao and wears the register not strive diligently?

The preceding register of the two ranks of immortals and spirits and the one hundred fifty generals, as explained by their numbers, are the true spirits of the six qi of yin and yang. Yet within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin; among the immortals and spirits, there are also numinous officials, and among the numinous officials, there are also immortals and spirits. They are not uniform, but yin and yang each take their respective governance as their leaders. The generals are so named because they command and marshal the multitude, ensuring order and defense.

The rest shall be practiced in accordance with the register’s text, and further elaboration is omitted.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register of the Three Primordial Generals**

The Three Generals—Tang, Ge, and Zhou—are the true spirits of the Three Qi of the Three Primordial Palaces of the Most High, the primordial essences of water and fire. Below, they correspond to the heart-palace and the two kidneys within the human body. In heaven, they govern the diagrams, numbers, talismanic seals, and numinous scriptures of the alliance registers within the Northern Dipper. These enable one to know the Dao and preserve the true. Those who wear and serve this precious register, performing invocations at the proper times, may manifest the forms of the Three Generals. Once merits are recorded, the Three Spirits shall ascend together with them. The methods of invocation are separately provided below.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Primordial Chaos Register of the Red Mandate of Original Life**

When Primordial Chaos first arose and the primordial embryo took form, all received the revolving pivot of the Seven Governors and the differentiation of the myriad spirits. The practices of cultivation and preservation are detailed in the register’s text. When merits are complete and the Dao is perfected, the primordial true shall ascend in unity.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register of the Nine Phoenixes of the Nine Heavens for Dispelling Defilement**

The essence of the cinnabar prime gives rise to the Nine-Colored Spirit Phoenixes, whose talons tread the stellar *gang*, whose wings beat with might, and who guide the way through the celestial paths. Thus, the yin qi of the Six Palaces and the malevolent vapors of the myriad beings cannot encroach upon the true officials. Those who study and receive this register may dispel all impurities and defilements. In all ritual undertakings, it should be employed first. One must concentrate the mind and focus the intention, never neglecting or slackening. With prolonged practice, the phoenixes shall render one’s form and body luminously pure, ears and eyes keen and bright, vision penetrating without limit. When cultivation is complete, one shall ascend with them to the Nine Heavens.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register for Protecting Life and Prolonging Longevity**

Those who receive and diligently uphold this register shall have death averted in the Northern Palace and life inscribed in the Southern Dipper, their forms radiant with the Three Luminaries, and their lifespan equal to that of heaven and earth. The two medical officials of Bian Que and the jade maidens and immortals may be visualized and invoked in accordance with the register’s methods.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register of the Nine Palaces for Warding Off Calamities and the Eight Trigrams for Protecting the Body**

This register is the divine record of the Nine Perfected, the numinous script of the Eight Trigrams, and the secret decree of the Most High, commanding the spirits of the eight directions and nine lands who govern calamities. They drive away all harms, ensuring no violation of the true qi, and deliver one from the nine hundred sixty disasters of the yang and yin cycles. With prolonged cultivation, the true spirits of the Eight Trigrams shall ascend with one to the rank of the Nine Heavens, advancing in accordance with one’s merits.

**The Most High’s Orthodox Three-Five Register of the Alliance of Might: Register of the Four Divisions of the Great Mystery for Restraining Qi**

To govern the myriad spirits and commune with the true to attain the Dao, one must invariably restrain and gather the essences of the Five Phases, exhale and inhale the primordial qi, grasp and recite the scriptural passages, and activate the mechanisms of the source. The power of selection lies within oneself, as if held in the palm of the hand, enabling one to command heaven and earth. Even the venomous insects, crawling worms, tiny creatures, birds, fish, beasts, creatures with scales, feathers, or fur—whether formed or formless, the myriad spirits of diverse kinds—shall all be subdued and obey one’s restraints. The methods of receiving qi, though detailed in the register’s text, also depend on a enlightened master, for each matter requires oral transmission. Such is the *Register of the Four Divisions for Restraining Qi*.

The register’s chapters and memorials are presented for imperial perusal as the comprehensive authority of restraint techniques. It is most fitting to receive and wear them, upholding and cultivating them to aid the true Dao.

**Register of the Dragon and Tiger for Slaying Malevolence**
The Dragon and Tiger are the essences of Metal and Wood, the guardian spirits to the Lord of the Dao’s left and right. When their awe-inspiring gaze is cast, the ten thousand demons submit in fear, and the myriad malevolent spirits constrain their forms. Through cultivation and resonance, when the time of attaining the immortal Dao arrives, the Dragon and Tiger shall bear one aloft in ascent.

**Register of the Complete Seal of the Capital Chapters**
This register contains the seals of the Six Jia, the central section’s various seals, and their bindings, along with memorials, talismans, and diagrams, all governed within the register. The seal-holding officers, immortal lads, and jade maidens, in response to the practitioner’s diligent cultivation and sincere resonance, shall be dispatched to serve. Sacrificial rites must not be neglected to await the numinous response. The methods for crafting seals are detailed in separate ritual instructions.

**Register of the Star-Stepping Net**
Immortal arts—emerging from existence and entering non-existence, transforming in myriad ways—all proceed from stepping the net and treading the tracks. Its methods all emulate the qi of the Three Luminaries to summon the divine spirits. There are upper, middle, and lower grotto net secrets, varying according to their use, all as recorded in the original register. In cultivation, this pertains to the affairs of the middle section’s Three-Five Crimson Heaven Star-Stepping Net. Receiving and wearing this register allows one to encompass all restraint methods. With prolonged and earnest practice, one shall ride the void and tread the formless, ascending as an immortal in broad daylight.

**Register of the Crimson Palace of the Celestial Numinous for Slaying Malevolence**
This register belongs to the Crimson Heaven’s Three-Five Cinnabar Ultimate Primordial Yang Lord, whose might shakes the ten thousand malevolences, whose radiance pierces through rebellious iniquities, and who executes and exterminates the myriad demonic and evil spirits, compelling them to follow the Dao’s transformation. Through meritorious cultivation, one delivers the dead from peril, refining the body to ascend to heaven.

**Register of the Nine Provinces’ Community Decrees**
This register enables the summoning and commanding of the spirits of the Nine Provinces’ village altars and earth officials, acting strictly in accordance with the register’s text.

**Register for Summoning the Hundred Ghosts**
Used to summon the hundred ghosts and ten thousand spirits, directing and commanding them to obedience, preventing their wanton indulgence in harm and disturbance of the people. They must act in accordance with the statutes and commands, the methods for which are contained in the register’s text and transmitted by the master.

**Register for Interrogation and Summoning**
In the world, there are cloud-dwelling ghostly youths, the Nine Uglies and various spirits, as well as earth, water, wood, and stone entities of strange forms and natures, along with transforming malevolences resembling *chimei*. When these harm the living, the Three-Five interrogation and summoning spirit-officers are dispatched to pursue and question them. The methods are contained in the register’s secrets and transmitted by the master.

**Register for Slaying the Thousand Ghosts and Ten Thousand Spirits**
When the ten thousand malevolences and rebellious iniquities disrupt the world, refusing to follow the Dao’s transformation, the Three-Five Crimson Heaven officers and soldiers are summoned to manifest divine might, wielding axes and halberds to execute and annihilate them. This must not be used indiscriminately.

**Register of the Nine Heavens’ Military Talismans**
**Register of the True Talismans of the Nine Heavens**
**Register of the Complete Governance of the Nine Heavens**
The above registers collectively command the officers, soldiers, and spirits of the Nine Heavens and Three-Five numinous officials, encompassing the boundless multitudes of the four wildernesses and eight extremities. All are to be received, worn, and cultivated. On the three auspicious assembly days, one should review and perform the sacrificial rites, reporting merits and seeking promotion, acting strictly in accordance with the register’s text.

**Register of the Flowery Canopy for Slaying Malevolence**
**Register of the Three-Five for Repelling Malevolence**
There are approximately ten or more grades for summoning and repelling malevolence, varying according to the master’s transmission and not fixed in number.

**Register of the Three Sovereigns for Warding Off Peril**
**Register of the Various Deliverances from Peril and Transcending Calamities**
**Register of the Six Harm-Dispelling Divine Talismans**
There are various talismans for exorcising and repelling the myriad harms of poisonous stings, totaling approximately ten or more grades, not fixed in number, to be transmitted according to the master’s instruction.

**Register of the Female Azure Summons**
**Register of the Nine Radiances and Ten Thousand Victories**

**Register of the Central Red Dao**
**Register of the Northern Thearch**
**Register of the Seven Stars**
**Register of the Cinnabar-Stalwart Powder-Fire**
**Register of the Northern Dipper’s True Contract**

Each register is transmitted according to the master’s lineage, to be practiced in accordance with its written instructions. Their grades correspond to the qi, totaling no more than twenty-four.

**Register of the Child-General Yi**
This is worn by youths and also belongs to the Three-Five Orthodox Unity tradition, as detailed in its ritual codes.

**True Contract of the Three-Five**
The covenant between master and disciple, the transmission of Daoist codes, scriptures, and oral instructions—all are sealed with oaths and established wisdom. It is sworn never to disclose them to the unworthy. The contract is divided, its halves broken and shared, while cinnabar-water is drunk to pledge the vow: never to betray the true Dao, to cultivate all good deeds, to refrain from killing, from licentious sacrifices, from reckless falsehoods or deceptions, and never to violate the covenant with Heaven and the Dao. Thus, the true contract is preserved.

The Three Caverns’ methods are each followed according to their respective codes, with matters detailed in the transmission rituals.

**Celestial Master’s Administrative Precincts**
When Celestial Master Zhang practiced the Orthodox Unity method in Western Shu, each precinct adhered to its proper affairs and laws. Wherever numinous responses occurred, a "tranquil precinct" was established, modeled after the twenty-four qi. There were also various precinct lodges scattered among the famous mountains. They were assigned according to the Five Phases, received in accordance with the month of one’s birth. Each precinct governed one qi: the chief was called the Yangping Precinct, corresponding to the left-balanced qi, while women corresponded to the right-balanced qi—all in accordance with the ritual codes and original methods. If one received all the precinct qi, the Three Masters of the Celestial Master transmitted the *Dugong* tablet. Now, in receiving the Orthodox Unity register, only the qi of one’s affiliated precinct is transmitted, with matters detailed in the precinct rituals.

**Orthodox Unity Scriptures:**
- *Orthodox Unity Scripture*
- *Orthodox Unity Audience with the Perfected Ritual*
- *Orthodox Unity Purification Ritual*
- *Ritual for Submitting Memorials and Petitions*
- *Register-Inspection Ritual*
- *Offering and Register Ritual*

The above ritual codes and texts are all contained in the *Orthodox Unity Scripture*. On the eight solar terms, the first days of the sexagenary cycle, Gengshen days, one’s birthdays, the Three Assemblies, the Three Primes, and the new and full moons, one may perform audience rites, offer sacrifices and inspect registers, or report merits and submit memorials—each according to its proper ritual, as transmitted by the master.

The above constitutes the first section of the *Orthodox Unity Alliance and Might*. Next, one advances to receive the *Cavern Spirit* as the middle method, as detailed in the *Three Caverns’ Codes for Serving the Dao*.

- *True Writ in Three Scrolls*
- *Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens*

The *Numinous Treasure True Writ*, the *Eightfold Radiance Celestial Script*, the *Five Methods in Five Scrolls*, the *Lord Lao’s Six Jia Secret Talismans*, the *Numinous Treasure Five Talismans*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writ*, and the *Western Peak Lord’s Mountain Proscription Text*—all the above are to be visualized and cultivated in accordance with their respective texts. This middle method section constitutes the *Cavern Mystery*, which complements the higher method as outlined in the *Three Caverns’ Codes for Serving the Dao* and the *Orthodox Unity Register*.

The three caverns’ numinous writs are not lacking in detail, yet the essentials of cultivation lie in the absorption of qi. When the five qi are fully mastered, the spirit and the true become complete. The oral instructions for cultivating qi are not contained in the register texts; here, we reverently set forth the *True Oral Instructions on the Star-Net of the Five Qi*.

The True Master said: All living beings receive the one qi and are transformed by yin and yang to fulfill their movement and function, yet humans are the most numinous. The four great elements and the five constants are naturally complete within them; their movement and function are subtle and wondrous, communicating with the divine. Wherever the mind’s intent turns, there is no division of far or near, deep or hidden. Swift without haste, arriving without traveling—such is the principle of resonance, how could it depend on external things? Thus, the coming and going of the myriad methods are self-generated by the mind. Only through non-action and non-creation can one achieve all creation. If a person can be serene and pure, the true qi will naturally be preserved—this is non-action. One may then become the master of the myriad things and accomplish all without exception.

If desires disturb the spirit, one cannot resonate with the true or respond to things. Yet in the human realm, affairs are many, emotions are stirred, and desires are indulged, scattering and disturbing the spirit and qi. This inevitably burdens the unseen and the manifest, entangling misfortune in past and future—proof is not far off, how can one not stand in awe?

If a person does not transgress the five constants or disorder the spirit and qi, and maintains this for a thousand days without interruption, they may then communicate with the divine, resolve calamities and misfortunes, and receive the *Cavern Mystery’s* pure and quiet observances. Once the five numinous qi manifest in form, one may then visualize and invoke the forms of the immortals, perfected beings, and the host of sages. Treading the star-net and moving in accordance with the method, after five years of diligent cultivation—or seven or nine years—one may summon the cloud chariots of the Five Thearchs, with true officials descending to welcome them, attaining the immortal Dao and mastery over life and death.

Guard the true, preserve the qi, tread the constellations, and ascend the net. Do not violate the five constants, do not disorder the spirit, do not defile the organs, do not tread in impure places. Concentrate in the fasting chamber daily, making it a constant practice without interruption. After one year of response, one may command the myriad demons and employ spirit officials. Whatever one conceives in thought may be used to attack afflictions and harm, to relieve all suffering—there will be no delay, regardless of distance, even ten thousand miles away in an instant. This is what is meant by "among the myriad transformations, humans are the most numinous."

To preserve one’s numinous true nature and protect one’s spirit and qi is to become an immortal. Thus it is said: The cosmos is in the palm of your hand, the myriad transformations arise from your body. The greatness of the dharmic image and the origin of cultivation lie in wearing the *Numinous Treasure Five Talismans* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, cultivating the five numinous qi, treading the nine origins, grasping the mysterious mechanism, and thereby communicating with heaven and earth.

Those in the world who do not betray the four great elements or transgress the five constants may practice this method. The oral instructions state:

If you transgress against *ren* (benevolence), the Azure Emperor is not true; if you transgress against *yi* (righteousness), the White Emperor is not true; if you transgress against *li* (propriety), the Vermilion Emperor is not true; if you transgress against *zhi* (wisdom), the Black Emperor is not true; if you transgress against *xin* (trustworthiness), the Yellow Emperor is not true.

The Dao of the five *qi* embodies the numinous and the true. If you do not betray the Dao or violate the true, you may cultivate and employ it. Thus the Dao Lord preserved and transmitted it to the perfected, to assist the natural and regulate the primordial transformations. Cultivate it within the body, and heaven will respond: the five phases follow their sequence, the five peaks stand firm in their places, the five viscera preserve their harmony, and the spirits govern the five numinous *qi*.

Therefore, only when the five virtues are deficient do misfortune and evil follow. The perfected who cultivate and employ the method of the five *qi* must first abstain from meat and blood, avoid filth and defilement, extinguish desire, and restrain the karma of body, speech, and mind. Once purity is attained, prepare a separate chamber, bathe thoroughly, and on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), at the hour of the cock’s crow, face the lunar station *yin* (the third branch) in the east. Sit upright, regulate the breath, close the eyes, and knock the teeth thirty-six times. The knocking should be deep yet gentle; swish and swallow the saliva, roll the eyes left and right three times each, clench the fists before the eyes, and forget all thoughts, releasing the mind into the vast emptiness. Remain thus without beginning or end until the body feels warm throughout. Then move the limbs, exhale the turbid *qi* at will, and once more regulate the breath. Embrace and guard the *qi*-sea, facing the Great Abyss and the Northern Culmen, directing the true palace of the cinnabar field. Exert effort to draw deeply, filling the great abyss, until you feel the *qi* of the hundred meridians gathering within.

After several repetitions, empty the mind into the vast emptiness. When the eastern quarter becomes luminously clear without obstruction, slowly draw *qi* through the nose, visualizing the five viscera. Perceive the true *qi* of the Azure Emperor from the east circulating through the liver, uniting inner and outer as one. Envision the thirty-six thousand spirits within the body merging with the true *qi* of the Azure Emperor. Regulate the breath, swallow the saliva, and after a long while, rise and bow twice to conclude the practice. Perform this daily without fail.

By the time of *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects), face *mao* (the fourth branch). Continue through the *yin* and *mao* nodes until the day of *Qingming* (Pure Brightness), when you face *chen* (the fifth branch), and perceive the yellow *qi* circulating through the spleen, illuminating inner and outer. On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), face *si* (the sixth branch), and perceive the vermilion *qi* circulating through the heart. On the day of *Mangzhong* (Grain in Ear), face *wu* (the seventh branch). At *Xiaoshu* (Slight Heat), face *wei* (the eighth branch), and perceive the yellow *qi* circulating through the spleen. On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), face *shen* (the ninth branch), and perceive the white *qi* emerging from the lungs, circulating within and without. On the day of *Bailu* (White Dew), face *you* (the tenth branch). By *Hanlu* (Cold Dew), face *xu* (the eleventh branch), and perceive the yellow *qi* emerging from the spleen, circulating within and without. On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), face *hai* (the twelfth branch), and perceive the black *qi* emerging from the kidneys, circulating within and without. By *Daxue* (Great Snow), face *zi* (the first branch). At *Xiaohan* (Slight Cold), face *chou* (the second branch), and perceive the yellow *qi* emerging from the spleen, circulating within and without.

Thus, over the course of a full year, the five *qi* are complete. The methods of visualization, breath regulation, and sequential practice follow the initial instructions: rolling the eyes, knocking the teeth, and adhering to the original count, without need for gradation. By the following year’s *Lichun*, repeat the practice for three, five, seven, or nine days, following the sequence of the previous year as a regular discipline to greet the *qi*.

The use of *qi* originates in the heart and responds through the hands. Embrace and comprehend the eyes of the Three Powers, the five phases, and the myriad spirits. The hand seal of clenching the fists is the foundational method, known as "wielding the celestial pivot, sealing the five peaks, closing the three culminations, seizing the demonic path, grasping the river’s source, and securing the true *qi*," thereby governing both the hidden and the manifest.

When the practice is complete, disperse the *qi* according to the breath-regulation method. As for finger seals, women prioritize the right, men the left, reflecting the yin and yang constitution. The thumb corresponds to earth, the index finger to fire, the middle finger to wood, the ring finger to metal, and the little finger to water. The root joint is the *meng* (first) node, the middle joint the *zhong* (second), and the fingertip the *ji* (third). The nails are the "blades of the five phases," governing execution and employed to sever evil and punish rebellion.

Once the five *qi* are complete, they may be applied according to the five categories, mutually restraining and subduing as desired. The method of clenching the fists: press the thumb against the four fingers, passing through the human gate and the demonic path three times. Seal the *qi* according to the text, pressing the finger joints to correspond to the twelve branches, applying them in accordance with the principles of mutual generation and restraint.

All stepping methods begin with the three steps and nine traces, known as the *Yu* step, whose origins are ancient. Though transmitted by Yu of the Xia, it was not his creation. It governs the three origins and nine stars, the three poles and nine palaces, aligning with the great numbers of the sun. The method: first lift the left foot, taking a half-step followed by a full step, one forward and one back, one yin and one yang. The initial and final steps align, with feet positioned perpendicularly in a *ding*-shape, symbolizing the union of yin and yang. The heels and toes should be slightly apart, neither too wide nor too narrow, adhering to the rule. Clench the fists, hold the breath, and fill the Great Abyss Palace. Roll the eyes three times, knock the teeth, and visualize the spirits, causing the four numinous beings to guard you, with mounted officers arrayed before, behind, left, and right, and the soldiers and horses of the five directions and five emperors in their proper positions. The Northern Dipper covers the head, its handle pointing forward toward the direction of the lunar station, while the back faces the destructive position.

After completing the nine traces, hold the breath and retreat, returning to the original position before advancing again—this constitutes the three strides. Then turn left, dispatching the spirits and *qi* according to the method, directly executing your intent to attack afflictions and dispel harm. Upon completing all tasks, close the eyes, visualize the spirits, regulate the breath, and return it to the Great Abyss Palace, swallowing the saliva nine times.

For the prohibitions, commands, talismanic water, and other methods, invoke the true *qi* of the five directions and five emperors, as the true master would say: First practice the five *qi* for a year, then the three steps and nine traces of the stellar method for another year without error. Only then may you perform various prohibitive arts at will, achieving divine efficacy.

Those who can purify themselves, guard the Dao with reverence, and persist in this practice for a long time will ascend as flying immortals and transcend the world. The ancient true immortals and sage-kings all attained this to assist in governing the world and refining customs. Yet世传 often distorts the truth, leading to reckless interpretations—only by following this method will its efficacy be revealed.

The former master said: The three strides and nine traces resemble the *Ji Ji* hexagram. Having obtained the true oral instructions of the stellar method, one must further cultivate the *qi* of the Five Emperors and master the hand seals and mudras to align with its principles, thereby penetrating the true origin. If one merely receives and upholds talismanic charts and precious registers without the transmitted methods of practice from a master, they will never attain spiritual verification—just as the register’s text states. Otherwise, it would be no more than reverent veneration and offerings, serving as good karma to benefit future endeavors.

The five methods above—receiving *qi*, the oral instructions for circulating *qi*, the Yu Steps, the stellar method, and the hand seals—are essential.

The true master said: Those of the Dao who receive and wear the inner sounds of the various heavens, the true scriptures of the *Lingbao*, the vermilion writings and jade instructions, the *Eight Scenes Celestial Writings*, and refine the secret Daoist arts, practicing and ingesting the *Laojun Six Jia Talismans*, the *Lingbao Five Talismans*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Western Peak Lord’s Mountain-Prohibiting Talismans*, and other registers—must uphold and cultivate each according to its proper procedures. Those who do not slacken will refine their forms and transmute their bones, achieving the ability to vanish while seated or standing, and ascend to the rank of *Dongxuan* supreme perfected.

The methods for conducting affairs within the registers are each detailed in their original texts, while the essential and wondrous transmissions are separately bestowed by the master. Upon completing the cultivation of the *Dongxuan* section, the divine perfected will respond, allowing one to partake in the heart of the *Shangqing* teachings.

The preceding section belongs to the Shangqing Division, which constitutes the *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection). Here, a brief account of master-disciple transmission is provided to outline its general contours. The reception of scriptures, registers, and precepts follows the ordained codes of the Dao. The Three Caverns and Six Categories together comprise sixty ranks. Including the Three Caverns’ true scriptures, the total amounts to one hundred eighty myriad billion three thousand one hundred and eighty scrolls. Yet in this world, as kalpas turn and misfortunes spread, the celestial bureaus shift, cavernous palaces withdraw into concealment, and few remain extant. Moreover, through世间 transmission and transcription, errors in script and seal have arisen, or spurious additions and deletions have been made, tailored to俗 conventions to seek fame and profit. Though former masters generation after generation have revised and standardized the texts, they could not ensure absolute accuracy. The reason lies in the divergence of世 teachings and the variance of human sincerity and deceit. How can I know whether, within and beyond the Three Realms, across all heavens and世间, wherever written teachings exist, they do not also change with circumstances? Now, we must follow what has been transmitted in the world, trusting the celestial scriptures and numinous texts as authentic expressions of the Dao. The essential principle of *Dongzhen* is to maintain an impartial and unified mind, cultivate benevolence and filial piety toward all, sever attachments and desires, embrace clarity and non-action, entrust matters to ultimate impartiality, and align principles with perfect appropriateness—penetrating all without obstruction, unattached to being or non-being.

**Methods for Transcribing Scriptures and Registers**
The Perfected Master said: Sincerity moves the divine; earnest devotion will surely evoke response. Yet世間 recipients of scriptures and registers often fail to observe proper rites, while masters transmit carelessly and disciples practice with negligence. Some then claim that Daoist registers lack efficacy and that immortals produce no results—this is their own fault. The former masters’ protocols for transcribing scriptures and registers are detailed in a separate scroll; here, only the essentials are summarized.

When procuring paper, cinnabar, pigments, brushes, ink, and other materials, all must accord with the Dao. Value their origins, avoiding contention or profit-seeking in acquisition. The heart must be empty and nurturing, the environment pure and protected. Transcribe with focused intent, ensuring no defilement by chickens, dogs, or other creatures, nor exposure to women’s gazes. After a month or more of purification and bathing, prepare a separate oratory chamber, opening a small window to the east. Continuously burn incense on either side, set out the text on a table, don proper attire, and with mind fixed on the Mystic Master, silently invoke your intent. Regulate your breath, moisten the brush, and transcribe the cinnabar and pigments according to the prescribed forms. Avoid ox-hide glue, as it prevents the descent of numinous *qi*; instead, use deer-antler glue mixed with a small amount of *rutou* incense to ensure adhesion. Whether using silk or paper, the principle remains the same.

The length of the register scroll, from top to bottom, should be nine *cun*, corresponding to the great number of the sun. The borders at the top and bottom should be vermilion, each nine *fen* wide, symbolizing the Nine Heavens above and the Nine Earths below. These vermilion borders represent the *qi* of Cinnabar Prime, embodying the red script of jade texts—the color of supreme yang—to dispel yin and evil. Each border should be one *fen* thick, symbolizing the pervasive circulation of the One *Qi*. Both top and bottom borders should have double lines, evenly spaced without gaps, representing the four seasons: the upper for spring and summer, the lower for autumn and winter.

The text column should be seven *cun* long, corresponding to the Seven Governors. Its width should be five *fen*, corresponding to the Five Phases. For regular or clerical script, each line should contain no more than twenty characters, evenly spaced and balanced, avoiding "suspended life" (characters that should not begin a line) or "exposed death" (characters that should not end a line). Carefully measure the spacing between lines. The disciple’s name and title should be written with particular care, ensuring they do not appear at the start of a line. These rules must be observed meticulously.

For talismans, seals, and illustrations, ensure uniformity and appropriateness. The transcription of register texts demands precision and attention to detail. Before approaching the scroll’s end, leave three lines to inscribe the names and ranks of the three masters: the Supervising Master, the Recommending Master, and the Ordaining Master. The scroll’s mounting and decorative rollers should be neither extravagant nor meager, adjusted according to one’s means, but always kept solemn and pristine. Avoid unnecessary concerns or excesses. Prepare in advance the materials for authentication, talisman boards, and sealing pouches, all in accordance with the ritual codes.

Once transcription is complete, place the scroll in its case according to its division and seal it properly. Morning and evening, burn incense in the oratory, ensuring no disturbances. On the day of the ordination fast, the master shall confer the register according to the rites.
