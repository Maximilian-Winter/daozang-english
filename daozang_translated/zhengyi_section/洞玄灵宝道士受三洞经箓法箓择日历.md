In reverent inquiry, the teachings of the Three Caverns and the auxiliary scriptures of the Four Supplements were first expounded by the Primordial Beginning and transmitted by the Dao Lord. All sages cultivate them, and the host of perfected ones recite and venerate them. Concealed within the Three Realms, they spread throughout the Ten Directions. Though ages pass like dust and years stretch beyond kalpas, their principles parallel the sun and moon, likened to water and fire. Both ordinary and sacred beings behold them, and humans and devas alike employ them. Though their methods are boundless, their rules and models remain unchanged. Though the world undergoes transformation, their majestic observances endure as one.

Thus, when leaving the household to enter the Dao, one must receive and uphold them. Great virtue and dharma masters should guide and instruct accordingly. Once disciples arrive, prostrating in earnest, the master must prepare the ritual protocols. In principle, one must revere the scriptures and comply with canonical standards, ensuring the Three Pledges are fulfilled and the Six Confirmations remain unbroken. Those who study the Dao with a master and uphold the scriptures without transgression—once their vows are accepted and the purification rites and memorials are scheduled—should each proceed according to their request, selecting an auspicious day in advance. The timing of scriptural and dharma rites cannot be altered; distinctions must be clear, and carelessness is intolerable.

In recent times, masters have favored the *jiazi* day as auspicious, or used the *Zhengyi* liturgical calendar for receiving the Dao, transmitting the Three Caverns’ teachings. For instance, the *jiazi* day was employed by the Three

Here follows the translation:

These twelve entries detail the auspicious and inauspicious days for transmitting the Dao. One must examine them carefully and avoid the two prohibited conditions. This is recorded in the *Zhengyi Fawen Dulu Duzhi Yi*.

**The Golden Knob of Lord Lao, along with scriptural catalogues and scriptures**
For all rituals of receiving the Dao and conducting purification fasts, the *wangxiang* days, one’s *benming* day, the *jiazi* day, and the new and full moon days are all excellent. This is recorded in the *Laojun Zhuanyi Zhujue* of the *Taixuan* section.

**Divine incantations, talismanic contracts, illustrated scriptures, and the like**
These are best employed on the first *jia* day of the first month, as well as on the first, fifteenth, *mao*, and *you* hours of every month. This is recorded in the *Shenzhou Jing*.

**The *Dongshen Sanhuang Futu Jing* and the like**
For purification fasts and transmission rites, one should select the *wangxiang* days, one’s *benming* day, the *jiazi*, *jiashen*, and *jiachen* days—these are the three most auspicious *yuan* days. This is recorded in the fourteenth scroll of the *Dongshen Jing*.

**The *Dongxuan Lingbao Ziran Quan Zhong Meng Jing*, the Two Registers of True Writs, the Spirit Tablets, and the Divine Staffs**
In spring, use the *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, the *dingsi* and *bingwu* days; in the four seasons, the *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou* days; in autumn, the *gengshen* and *xinyou* days; in winter, the *guihai* and *renzi* days. The day of *jianwang* is for ascending the altar.

**The Five Methods**
For receiving the Six *Jia* Talismans, one should choose a *jiazi* day and perform the rite at night in the courtyard altar, allowing wind and rain to enter the chamber.

The *Jinshan* states: set up the offering at midnight, without specifying the day. For the Five Marchmounts, use the *shangyue* day at midnight.
The *Sanhuang* states: at midnight, spread the mat in the courtyard altar, without specifying the day.
The *Wufu* states: on an auspicious day during a clear, cold night, spread the mat in the courtyard altar. This is recorded in the *Taogong Zhuanyi*.

Now, the Six *Jia* are appended to the *Laojing Jinshan Sanhuang*, following the *Dongshen* method. The Five Marchmounts and Five Talismans follow the *Lingbao* method.

**The *Hetu Baolu***
The most auspicious time for practice is the night of the New Year. The third and twenty-seventh days of every month are when the August Sovereign descends and appears. The *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *gengshen*, *benming*, *taisui*, and the eight seasonal nodes are all greatly auspicious. This is recorded in the *Jiuhuang Jiaoyi*, the *Shangqing Qiquan Jingmu*, and various methods such as the Three Registers and the *Taisu Xuandu Zijiao Jiaodai*.

The ninth and tenth days of the first month, the eighth and ninth days of the second month, the seventh and eighth days of the third month, the sixth and seventh days of the fourth month, the fifth and sixth days of the fifth month, the fourth and fifth days of the sixth month, the third and fourth days of the seventh month, the second and third days of the eighth month, the first and second days of the ninth month, the tenth and eleventh days of the tenth month, the eleventh and twelfth days of the eleventh month, and the twelfth and thirteenth days of the twelfth month—these are called the Nine Openings of the Celestial Pass, also known as the Days of Audience with the Grand Simplicity.

Tao states: In this year, on the *zi*-governed day, the Celestial Pass opens nine times, though each month has only one such day.
Zang Zongdao states: For transmitting the Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods, use the Nine Openings of the Celestial Pass. This is recorded in the *Shangqing Jing* and the *Zhen’gao*.

In all cases of receiving the Dao, there are three pledges. Initially, one’s heart must be sincere and faithful, with subtle devotion. There must also be six witnesses to oversee the solemnity of the ritual, correcting any deficiencies. Since individuals vary in capacity and the methods differ in dignity, gradual and sudden approaches must be distinguished, and diligence or negligence must be separated. From the subtle to the manifest, one proceeds from the shallow to the profound. The sages have left their instructions, guiding all as a flowing stream.

When first requesting the method, each has its own hierarchical rank; one must follow the proper sequence and not transgress the order. However, among the Daoists of the world, their robes and food burden their bodies, and they seek only to remedy the present, not considering the hereafter. Few are those who turn toward the Dao with resolve. Such courage is difficult to sustain; without guidance, the path of return may be severed. Thus, within a single altar, multiple methods may differ, and among the three pledges, the transmissions vary. If each person were to receive separately and each method required a distinct altar, not only would the master and disciple exhaust their bodies with labor, but the immortal officials would also be wearied by repeated summons. This is to provide a model for past and present.

All under Heaven—whether sacred or common—should align with what is fitting, for affairs are harmonized through the Dao, and methods are tailored to the person. Thus, above, they accord with the sagely intent, and below, they resonate with the hearts of ordinary folk. This reflects the Heavenly Worthy’s skillful means and the all-embracing nurturance of the Supreme Dao, whose vastness is boundless.

Yet if one clings to ignorance without change or remains obstinately fixed, the path of deliverance may be lost, and the resolve to turn toward truth may wither. Those who falsely claim the Dao to sell its methods, seeking profit and luring others—who feign virtue to deceive the foolish, boast of their reputation, and await distant summons, arbitrarily setting rules and emptying them of true principle—lie beyond the scope of this discourse; I do not address them here.

What I cannot bear to witness are the following: men and women sharing the same altar; master and disciple failing to fast in mutual devotion; master and disciple wandering separately; disciples arriving only after the fast has begun to announce their attendance; those who take no vows or pledges; those who exhaust their resources in vain; masters borrowing scriptures or ritual methods, or lending them to others; masters providing tokens of transmission on another’s behalf; multiple masters presiding over a single altar; omitting written petitions or failing to divide covenants; transmitting methods out of sequence without awaiting an auspicious day; falsely listing guarantors or padding the names of eminent figures. Such practices are too numerous to endure.

There are also those without scriptural or ritual authority who, relying on wealth, power, or lofty reputation, feel ashamed if others do not submit to them and thus forcibly recruit disciples to transmit teachings. Some, having received but one or two methods—or merely the Ten Precepts of the Dao and Virtue—claim to have mastered all Daoist methods through their teacher. Others, barely versed in talismans, seals, incantations, or minor arts, boast of entering the celestial courts. Some, driven by the wealthy or trusted by common folk, enjoy fine clothing, ample food, and servants, using others to spread their name and attract disciples to transmit scriptures and methods. Still others, presuming upon their age and virtue, don a cap and suddenly become masters. Such examples abound everywhere—do they ever consider the hidden retribution, the sins and calamities that will befall them, or the suffering they bring upon themselves? How much worse for their seven ancestors, nine generations, and living parents! Are there not those in every age who murder their fathers, slay their rulers, rebel against Heaven, defy Earth, and bring ruin upon themselves—are these not equally monstrous?

Since multiple transmissions occur within a single altar, one should adhere to the most revered method, announce the fast, set its duration, and choose an auspicious day. Lesser methods may be transmitted during the fast.

In my travels through Jiang, Huai, Wu, and Shu, I observed how lightly masters and disciples treated the transmission of teachings, and how carelessly they conducted fasts, neglecting wholehearted devotion in favor of nocturnal rituals and offerings. Recently, such practices have waned in the capital, for the court-appointed Daoists, many of whom hail from these regions, have brought their vulgar customs to the imperial city.

Some say: "In the oratory (*jing*), one must avoid the parents of the Dao, and they must not enter to burn incense." Foolish admirers mistake this for a profound secret. Yet the parents of the Dao are forbidden from entering the oratory only when the libationer (*jijiu*) is performing memorials or setting up offerings—such prohibitions do not extend to the supreme methods of the Three Caverns. As for the days of *wu-chen*, *ji-si*, *wu-xu*, and *ji-hai*, these are observed as they occur. The Ten Fasts, Eight Festivals, Five Communications, and the *Taisu* audiences at the sacred mountains are fixed celestial days, essential for seeking immortality. If one attends such assemblies, how could one fail to pay homage to the Perfected?

These are but minor methods for aiding the world, not the supreme practices for cultivating the self. You, my disciples, should recognize this. The Ten Fasts and Eight Festivals are occasions when the multitude of sages inspect and record merits and transgressions—these are also auspicious days. Though the scriptures do not explicitly list them as examples, using them for virtuous deeds and transmitting the Dao must surely align with sagely intent.

There are also days when the Celestial Emperor executes punishments, said to forbid all undertakings. Yet these are only meant to prohibit medicinal preparations and construction—other prohibitions apply. As for receiving the Dao, there should be no obstacle, though beginners would do well to avoid such days. Those who have long awakened to the supreme methods of the Three Caverns are not bound by such restrictions.

According to the *Ordinances of the Golden Luminance Dao*, as long as the ritual implements are fully prepared, one may ascend the altar to make vows without waiting for an auspicious day. The wise will consider this carefully.
