**Fascicle One of *The Supreme Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Great Empyrean Jade Book***

**The Jade Text of the Emperor’s Chapter, Composed by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity**

Yunwuzi was the scion of the Jade Void of the Primordial August, the middle son of the Supreme Emperor. He nurtured a jade embryo within the Jade Chamber, congealed cloud-essence at the Golden Gate, and contained the sun and moon within his purple womb. He transformed the vast dew to condense his spirit, refined his embryonic breath to propel the revolutions, and endured kalpas to turn the wheel. Born into the Yuan clan, he proclaimed the Yang Dao to achieve perfection.

Thus, on the first day of the third month in the first year of the Supreme August, as the celestial radiance unveiled the dawn, he was born above the Nine Profound Heavens. His precious luminance illuminated the boundless skies. He beheld the Great Sun upon the cloud cliffs and shone his golden countenance from the jade pavilion. He followed the imperial foundation in the Emperor’s Chart and emulated the jade splendor of spontaneity. He bathed in the radiance of the Nine Numinous, cleansed with sweet and fragrant jade springs, drank from the divine mushrooms of the Royal Consort, and fed upon nine-times-refined flying frost. Divine dragons flanked his sides, and jade phoenixes shaded his crown. Purple mist arose above him, and flowing light suffused his surroundings. The Two Images upheld his principles, and the Three Dawns harmonized his perfection. The divine continents sang of his marvels, and the Seven Transformations altered his spirit. A numinous wind hastened his form, and swirling fragrance dispelled the dust. High in the vast emptiness, he drifted along the shores of the undulating waves.

At the age of eighteen, he pondered the subtle and contemplated the mysterious. He followed the principles of his nature and allowed time to advance. Unattached to the imperial Dao, he roamed freely through the Central Plains, wandering joyfully in the Great Empyrean and lingering in the Purple Heavens. His gaze traversed kalpas, and he found delight in the journey, forgetting to return. The revolutions were not his to control, yet he stood forth as a supreme immortal.

Thereupon, his name was inscribed upon the Emperor’s tablets, and he ascended to the rank of Supreme Perfected. The Three Primes bestowed teachings, and he was enfeoffed with the imperial canon. At that time, he received his mandate, paid homage in the Jade Heaven, and ascended the Terrace of the Nine Profound Heavens to the Palace of Great Abundance. In the Purple Phoenix Jade Capital, the Seven Treasures Crimson Chambers, within the Hall of Bright Rosy Clouds, he purified himself in the Jade Pavilion. The numinous origin declared its resonance, and a halo of radiance crowned his head. At night, divine candles illuminated him, and the jade hall shone of its own accord.

Then, the Lord of the Dao of the Void August, from above the Cavernous Void and within the Mysterious Emptiness, descended and bestowed upon him *The Jade Text of the Emperor’s Chapter of the Great Empyrean Jade Book*.

At that moment, the celestial light dimmed, the Three Dawns revolved their essence, the Five Lodgings altered their courses, and the Seven Primes activated their numina. Nine-colored radiance blazed, illuminating the Jade Purity. Flying mists billowed thickly, suffusing the Eight Obscurities. Ascending the jade steps, the myriad emperors attended the court. Flying immortals with feathered canopies flanked the Supreme Perfected. Immortal lads and jade maidens, each in thousands, held towels and scattered incense, wafting fragrance to sweep away the dust.

Thereupon, he commanded his chariot and summoned the Five Numinous. The flying empyrean turned its wheel, and he rode the void, entwined in mist. A divine phoenix drew his reins, and numinous consorts guided the immortals. The August Radiance opened the path, and the Three Ways merged in brilliance. Flowing lightning flashed its essence, and his swift chariot traversed the Nine Profound Heavens. He gazed upon the jade palaces, feasted in the Three Primes, and lingered in the Jade Empyrean, freely roaming the Purple Dawn.

Then, he unfurled the Jade Book upon the boundless expanse, recited the Emperor’s Chapter amidst the azure clouds, ordered the karmic roots with jade instructions, summoned the mighty numina with the jade text, chanted the wondrous melodies in the Cavernous Void, and concentrated his tranquil thoughts in the Jade Pavilion. He governed the Two Modes in the Mysterious Chart, held the imperial records of the myriad immortals, oversaw the earthly offices of the Five Marchmounts, and presided over the Supreme Perfected of the Three Passes. Above, he unified the boundless; below, he encompassed the cavernous origins. From the heavens downward, none were not subject to the Supreme Perfected.

His spirit was unfathomable, his transformations ineffable. Near, he was beyond discourse; far, beyond pursuit. Pure, he could not be sullied; chaotic, he could not be clarified. Subtle and wondrous! Such was the imperial numen of utmost virtue—how lofty and exalted!

*The Great Empyrean Jade Book* is the melody of the Nine Heavenly Kings’ Flying Empyrean; *The Jade Text of the Emperor’s Chapter* is the supreme scripture of the Nine Heavens. Both originated at the inception of the Primordial Beginning, born within the natural Cavernous Void. The Jade Emperor of the Void August received them from the Nine Profound Heavens.

Thereupon, the Heavenly King recorded their names, cast gold into tablets, and inscribed jade to compose the chapters. Golden threads bound jade characters to manifest the precious text. It was concealed above the Nine Heavens, in the Palace of Great Abundance, where the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Jade Lads of the Golden Dawn, each three thousand in number, attended and offered incense.

Thus, the Nine August Supreme Sages ascended the jade steps thrice daily, paying homage and feasting with the divine perfected. Through revolutions spanning ten thousand kalpas, they transmitted it to the King of Supreme Perfected.

Its Dao is lofty and wondrous, the ancestor of all scriptures. Its numen is uniquely outstanding, its essence supreme among the Nine Heavens. Its jade wisdom is empty and luminous, its cavernous pursuits penetrating the mysterious. None but the supreme perfected may partake in its study. It is conferred only upon those who have already attained perfection; it is not transmitted to intermediate immortals.

*The Great Empyrean Jade Book* is the melody of the Nine Heavenly Kings’ Flying Empyrean; *The Jade Text of the Emperor’s Chapter* is the Dao of the radiant mystery of the High Numen, the essence of the Nine Heavens. It oversees the myriad qi and governs all scriptures.

Whenever one cultivates *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern*, the Dao of the Returning Wind uniting the Imperial One, or *The Jade Register of the Feminine One and the Five Venerable Treasure Scripture* to resolve karmic roots and deliver the Seven Profound, without this text, the Nine Heavenly Kings will not accept their recitations. The nine qi will be disordered, the divine perfected will not rejoice, celestial demons will invade their visions, and myriad trials will assail them. Their thoughts will not penetrate the subtle, and Heaven will not open its gates.

In all scriptural cultivation, the Jade Text must come first. Recite and chant it in the secluded chamber, purify and rejoice in the rosy courtyard. Communicate with the Nine Empyreans, align and unite with the Supreme Mystery. Let the Jade Palace be astonished to hear, and the myriad perfected attend the pavilion. Hosts of demons will prostrate themselves, and myriad trials will dare not advance. Cultivate as you will, and you shall attain the perfection of the Dao. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao will be complete, and you shall ascend to the Great Purity.

The essential instructions are not cumbersome—they lie precisely within this scripture. With focused mind and arduous practice, one may ascend to transcendence as an immortal.

Master Yunwu did not cultivate other paths but received the *Taixiao Langshu Qiongwen Dizhang* from the Lord of the Void Empyrean. Upon the Nine Empyreans, he chanted the wondrous verses, roaming and rejoicing at will, moving the divine perfected to delight. This prompted the Three Primes to send down a decree, elevating him to the rank of Great Perfected King. The text was then transmitted to the Perfected of Mount Taihua, the Lord of Longevity of the Three Heavens, the Perfected of Great Harmony, the Elder of the Eastern Florescence, the Supreme Controller of the Southern Culmen, the Central Marquis of the Western Terrace, the Central Perfected of the Northern Thearch, the Nine Numinous Princes, the Perfected Consort of Great Numinosity, the Jade Lad of Cinnabar Essence, the Master of the Dark Valley, Master Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount, Wang Qiao of Mount Zhong, the Perfected of Purple Yang, the Lord of the Western City, the Central August Master, Zhao Boxuan, and Shan Zhongzong—eighteen in all. Each of these cultivated this Dao, their faces radiating golden splendor, their necks bearing circular aureoles. They ascended through the void to the Empyreans, roaming and feasting in the Purple Court, transforming in myriad ways, soaring at will. With a whistle, their commands were instantly fulfilled; they summoned the ten thousand spirits, subdued hordes of demons, and determined life and death. Riding the clouds and mist, they entered and departed the Celestial Court—all through the power of the *Qiongwen*, attaining the rank of highest perfected.

The Perfected King now seals one copy within the Western City Mountain. Those whose names are inscribed upon the golden tablets of the Celestial Register, written in green characters upon the Purple Clarity, and who are destined to unite with the true, shall obtain this text. Those who receive it must treasure and conceal it, never transmitting it carelessly. Should the sacred verses be leaked, nine generations of ancestors will be examined, condemned to serve as ghostly officials, and eternally confined to the earthly prisons, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas.

The Primordial Beginning of the Nine Heavens designates the First Heaven as *Yudan Wu-liang Tian* (Boundless Heaven of Joyous Unity). Above it, three additional heavens are established. The Venerable of the Nine Heavens governs the Boundless Heaven, twenty-four myriad *li* from the Second Heaven.

The Heaven of Unassuming Joy, governed by the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, lies thirty-six million eight hundred thousand *li* from the Sixth Heaven. The lifespan of its inhabitants spans twenty-three billion four hundred million years, equivalent to eight thousand years in the mundane world. Within this heaven, four Heavenly Perfected Kings of the Celestial Lineage dispatch, on the fourteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth days of each month, the Median Perfected Envoys to traverse the world below.

The Seventh Heaven is named *Fanbao Tian* (Heaven of Brahmā’s Treasure), also called *Poluonixiebazhi Tian* (Heaven of Pāramitā’s Supreme Attainment).

These nine heavens are the essence of the primordial *qi*, governed by the host of Perfected Sovereigns and August Emperors. Each heaven establishes three additional heavens, making thirty-six heavens in total. Their palaces, offices, and administrations all follow a hierarchical order. Beyond these lie the various Brahmā heavens, their names derived from the cyclical signs of the nine heavens, all subordinate to the Kings of the Nine Heavens. Each of the nine heavens, moreover, has its own Heavenly King—not bearing the title of Emperor-King—who resides above the nine heavens. Those who cultivate the supreme Dao and seek immortality to transcend the world should know the taboo names of these Heavenly Kings.

Those who know the names of the Nine Heavens are enveloped by the purple *qi* of the Mysterious, guarded by divine soldiers, and granted the secret scriptures of the Nine Heavens—thus their lifespan matches the span of the Nine Heavens. Those who receive these must treasure their secrecy; should they recklessly reveal them to three others, they will descend into the Nine Dark Hells to endure torment, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Beware!

**First:** The Heavenly King of the Immeasurable Heaven of Utmost Joy, surnamed Hun, taboo name *Nian-Shi*, wears a nine-colored, seamless robe of natural variegated patterns. His head is crowned with the Radiant Essence of the Sun. He dwells within the Dark Terrace of Unreflecting Mystery, behind the Purple Gates. Nine myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Second:** The Heavenly King of the Supreme Meditation and Immeasurable Life Heaven, surnamed Xie, taboo name *Yan-Nian-Na*, wears a nine-colored robe of self-formed cloud patterns. His head is crowned with the Glowing Essence of the Moon. He governs the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Jade Country and Pearl Forest. Seven myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Third:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Extended Life, surnamed Zi, taboo name *Nai-Bing-Cou*, wears a nine-colored robe of the Three Dharma Cloud patterns. His head is crowned with the Heavenly Origin Treasure Brilliance. He rules the Numinous Capital Palace of the Jade Capital Heaven. Nine myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Fourth:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Serene Stillness, surnamed Fu, taboo name *Beng-Di*, wears a seven-colored robe of dragon patterns and permeating light. His head is crowned with the Yin Essence of Night Radiance. He resides above the Jeweled Terrace of the Pearl Palace. Six myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Fifth:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Unboastful Joy, surnamed Ning, taboo name *Fu-Yao-Yi*, wears a nine-colored robe of flying frost and cloud patterns. His head is crowned with the Mysterious Essence of the Green Brilliance of Jupiter. He governs the Nine-Layered Jade Terrace of the Unreflecting Vermilion Chamber. Seven myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Sixth:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Responsive Transformation, surnamed Hui, taboo name *Zhi-Yong*, wears a nine-colored robe of flowing light and luminous cloud brocade. His head is crowned with the White Brilliance of Venus. He rules the Vermilion Radiance Chamber of the Upper Palace in the Jeweled Forest Heaven. Six myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Seventh:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Brahmā’s Treasure, surnamed Jing, taboo name *Wu-Yun-Yu*, wears a nine-colored robe of flowing clouds and flying dawn. His head is crowned with the Crimson Treasure Radiance of Mars. He governs the Seven Radiance Palace of the Southern Heaven. Eight myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Eighth:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Brahmā-Makāya, surnamed Xuan, taboo name *Hong*, wears a nine-colored, seamless robe of flying clouds. His head is crowned with the Flowing Essence of the Morning Star. He rules the Purple Jeweled Terrace of the Nine Mysterious Phoenix City. Five myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

**Ninth:** The Heavenly King of the Heaven of Parinirvāṇa, surnamed Wang, taboo name *Ling-Hao*, wears a nine-colored, seamless robe of mysterious cloud and treasure. His head is crowned with the Flying Essence of Saturn, the Yellow Stabilizer. He governs the Nine-Bend Chamber of the Great Wondrous Palace in the Layered Jade Capital Heaven. Nine myriad Perfected Jade Maidens attend him on either side.

The Nine Kings of the Nine Heavens are the primordial source of the myriad *qi*, the ancestral progenitors of all emperors, and the wellspring of the nine *qi*. Before heaven and earth congealed, before the Three Luminaries shone, they coalesced naturally within the Void and the Primordial Abyss. After ninety thousand kalpas, their *qi* diverged to govern, establishing the Nine Heavens. The sun, moon, and stars thereby shone forth; the myriad *qi* flowed and evolved, crystallizing into the Perfected of the Dao.

The Primordial August Sovereign and the Supreme Jade Void both emerged within the First Heaven. Thirty-nine emperors and twenty-four Perfected Ones then established palaces and offices in hierarchical order. The precious scriptures of the August Sovereign were composed in spontaneously formed chapters. The Way of Longevity, the methods of deathlessness, talismans, jade instructions—all originated from the Kings of the Nine Heavens and were transmitted through the Perfected of successive generations.

When the Three and Five Cycles shifted and the Nine Numinous Ones responded to the appointed time, the Later Sage, the Nine Mysterious Dao Lord, examined the original sources. After ninety myriad and ninety thousand cumulative kalpas, he found the canons of the August Sovereign to be largely inconsistent. Thus, in the first year of the Middle August Era, on the first day of the ninth month, within the Golden Tower of the Upper Palace in the Jeweled Chamber of the Jade Heaven, the Dao Lord commanded the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence to investigate the ancient records, collate the old texts, revise, and compile the *Numinous Chapters*. These were gathered into three hundred volumes of precious scriptures and entrusted to the Prime Minister, the Azure Youth, to transmit to those later learners whose jade names align with the Perfected.

All who study and seek immortality yet do not know the origin of the Dao or the birth of its precious instructions grope in darkness, lacking ancestral roots. The Perfected will not descend, and the Dao will not manifest. Those who aspire to immortality must seek the roots of the Nine Heavens, grasp their primordial origin—then the Dao will be complete, and immortality will be achieved.

The secret taboo names of the Nine Heavenly Kings are concealed within the Great Existence Palace above the Nine Heavens and are not transmitted to the lower world. Only through the *Mysterious Name Emperor Chart*, inscribed in golden characters of the Highest Clarity, and by aligning with the cycles of destiny, can one learn the names of the Nine Heavenly Kings. The Heavenly Kings will then dispatch twelve Jade Lads and nine Jade Maidens to guard the adept’s body. Following the precepts, one must perform a pure fast for ninety days—or nine days—offer nine taels of gold and ninety feet of purple silk as a pledge of faith to the Nine Heavens. Only then may the master transmit the covenant. Should one lightly divulge these most sacred mysteries, one’s seven ancestors will be condemned to prolonged ghostly servitude, bearing stones and moving mountains. The body will be consigned to the Three Bureaus, and immortality will never be attained.

**The First Scripture of the Jade Texts of the Great Empyrean: The Heaven of Utmost Joy**

The *qi* of the Great Empyrean Void coalesces into cloud formations.
Our King emerges with divine craftsmanship, transforming as if without form.
Within the formless dwells the true; from the true arises the formless.
In the vast and distant Mysterious Void above, the ethereal essence of the Primordial Beginning whispers.
The Dharma’s radiance illumines wondrous awakening; the Mysterious Workings come to summon.
Constellations array the jade characters; flying auroras transcend green jade.
Mists descend upon the Three Dawn Luminaries; flowing light thickens into purple clarity.
I ascend the Jade Radiance Terrace, loosen my sash, and rest in the Phoenix City.
Turning through the clouds, I climb the Nine Peaks, unlocking boundless longevity.
Who can journey with me? Come, seek my name.
My name is easily known—it resides in the Eastern Florescence Court.
From there, one may ascend to the Mysterious Capital, meditating upon the numinous essence of the Emperor.
Cast aside thoughts beyond the clouds; focus singularly on the Yellow Tranquility.

Reciting the *Taixiao* Chapters, the Three Passes naturally become clear.
The Mysterious Descends in lingering chariots; the Void dispatches flying auroras.
Though the Nine Heavens lie distant, wondrous thought settles your form.
*Uppermost Meditation on the Boundless Poison-Heaven King*
*The Second Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

Numinous workings unfold in the Hollow Cavern; golden perfection nurtures the jade embryo.
The Dharma’s radiance illumines the Court of Supreme Stillness; the Mysterious Transformation propels itself.
Through kalpas submerged in the Nine Netherworlds, with the Perfected you keep your hidden tryst.
The Three Dawns proclaim to the Primordial Beginning; the workings flow smoothly, bringing peace.
Guiding the reins above the luminous auroras, streaming essence gleams on jade branches.
Gazing back, you see Being within Non-Being; merged as one, you resemble an infant.
Father’s tranquility and Mother’s essence—carefree, you sport on the Phoenix Terrace.
As the setting light roams the Cloud Chambers, who knows your solitary wonder?
Joining in celebration at the Gate of Departure, you loosen your sash at the Purple Auroral Cliff.
Should you wish to seek me, study deeply the words of the Resplendent Writ.
Turning through the jade scriptures, the Heavenly King will naturally attend.
Abide in the Cavern the Emperor’s Oneness, as the foundation for seeking immortality.
Sever all thoughts, cast aside external distractions; keep ever your heart and spirit serene.
Through accumulated resonance, the Perfected descend; in lush splendor, their plumage shines.
Uprooting the roots of the seven ancestors, all ascend together the cloud-ladder.
Jade chapters reflect the exalted numina; the jade scriptures defy all conjecture.
Two wonders harmonize, each claiming its own unmatched origin.
If you wish to sport in the Nine Mysteries, simply recite the *Taixiao* verses.
Ten thousand kalpas pass in an instant—do not fret that Heaven’s response tarries.

*Brahma-Monitor Heavenly King*
*The Third Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

Clarified to utter purity, without the slightest defilement, qi congeals into purple radiance.
The Cinnabar Auroras mirror the Monitor Heaven; spread in array, they turn southward.
The Three Dawns illumine the constellations; the Seven Revolutions brighten the Supreme Subtlety.
The numinous wind swiftly carries rare fragrance; the jade pipes—how mournful their sound!
The divine phoenix soars through the jade groves; the host of immortals shake their feathered robes.
The Heavenly Jade rides the workings’ summons; grasping the tally, they govern the myriad affairs.
The Hollow Wheel hurls through the Void; vast and bright, it opens the Nine Heavenly Gates.
They lead the guests of the Auroral Realms, loosen their sashes, and enter the jade curtains.
Spreading brilliance, they uphold the morning qi; gleaming in array, they adorn the jade steps.
Ascending the Brahma-Heaven, they reflect the vermilion sun; a thousand lights flank the numinous radiance.
Drifting within the Primordial Transformation, the jade chariot lingers in its circuit.
The Noble Scion commands the Tiger Tally, gathering all the myriad spirits.
Uprooting and extinguishing the roots of the seven ancestors, even the exhausted souls all fly as immortals.
The Resplendent Writ celebrates the Cloud Court; the jade scriptures penetrate the subtle mysteries of the Void.
Diligently study the Dao, and the sun of your spirit will grow ever fresh; through a hundred kalpas, your numen will not wane.
The myriad transformations follow the workings’ shifts—only then do you know the rarity of the wondrous sound.

*Silent Heavenly King*
*The Fourth Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

Feasting on the light in the Realm of Supreme Stillness, the returning wind swiftly turns the jade wheel.
The Cinnabar Auroras flank the green chariot; the divine lords assist the Emperor’s Oneness.
Vast and dim, the Nine Mysteries’ transformation; scattered and distinct, they depart through the Gates of Aspiration.
Lingering above the golden net, they whistle and sing, celebrating the numinous clouds.
Three chants illumine the Mysterious Awakening; five revolutions divide the Dao.
The golden chambers gleam with towering splendor; streaming essence—how profuse!
Gazing left, you see the Peerless; gazing right, you observe the White Origin.
Treading the flourishing register of the Yellow Register, the Great One strengthens the root of destiny.
For me, they record the immortal roster; they bestow upon me the writ for transcending destiny.
In pure song, they summon the Heavenly Perfected; in stillness, they contemplate the hundred passages.
The Emperor’s Oneness guards the Numinous Palace; in Dharma robes, they fly in azure skirts.
With whom do they harmonize? They unite at the summit of the Nine Heavens.
Though there be days, it is as if there were no appointed time; the imperial splendor stands perfectly round.
In utmost resonance, cast aside all other thoughts—the Dao is transmitted from within the Mysterious.
Each numinous resonance follows its own workings; those who attain learning thus achieve wholeness.

*Unassuming Joy Heavenly King*
*The Fifth Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

From the Void arises purple mist; lush and dense, it veils the Flourishing Palace.
Flowing light follows the workings’ revolutions; the Cinnabar Auroras mirror the green chambers.
Flanking and assisting the scenes within the Void, their numinous radiance illumines the ten directions.
The myriad emperors follow the Perfected’s workings—none surpass the Nine Heavenly Kings.
Their forms congeal in natural elegance; containing qi, they emerge from the Hollow Palace.
Governing the transformations of the four directions, they are hailed as the ancestors of all emperors.
Riding the setting light upon the eight mists, they govern the revolutions of the Hollow Cavern.
At dawn, they roam the Western Terrace Pavilion; at dusk, they rest in the Palace of the Flourishing Canopy.
They grasp the records of the Mysterious Realm, deliver the youths of the Azure Florescence.
Peach and prosperity fix the roster of destiny; from the beginning, they preserve the merit of the kalpa.
Their gazes roam without bound; the myriad transformations follow the workings’ flow.
Striding through the air, they recite the *Taixiao*; in seclusion, they trace the Primordial’s tracks.
Through accumulated contemplation, they resonate with the Supreme Stillness, thereby ascending the Mysterious Summit.
The legacy of past foundations flows as lingering blessing; the seven ancestors return to the Southern Palace.
The Five Sufferings are not their path; their companionship is formed in the Great Void.
The numinous peaks are no ordinary abode; the flying clouds are my dragons.
Joining hands with the Perfected of the Nine Peaks, they pair their lights to form a couple.
Why sit amid the clamor and defilement, idly awaiting the exhaustion of destiny?

*Transformation-Responding Voice Heavenly King*
*The Sixth Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

Exalted numina flourish in the Hollow Cavern; congealed qi forms vermilion mist.
Grasping the tally, they turn through the Nine Auroras; drifting, drifting—they are the Heavenly Emperor’s Perfected.
The jade terrace gleams on the rocky slopes; the purple wind thickens around the jade unicorn.
Numinous songs drift through the secluded palace; aloft in the clouds, the solitary ones.
Joining in covenant in the Sevenfold Radiant Chambers, the golden net gleams in the central field.
The Heavenly Kings number nine; the flying immortals, a hundred thousand.
The Hollow Yang thickens with numinous signs, marking the years of destiny’s transcendence.
The cinnabar splendor illumines the vermilion sun; the flowing fragrance reveals the omens of your body.
Gazing up, they sip the moon’s nectar; from the nine sources, the liquid essence descends.
Forever preserving through endless kalpas, within and without, the Hollow Cavern shines resplendent.
Through accumulated contemplation, they resonate with the Great Void, moving to attain the Boundless Abyss.
Form merges with the Primordial Union; in their roaming and feasting, none can turn them back.

*Brahma-Treasure Heavenly King*
*The Seventh Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

The Three Dawns illumine the secluded night; flowing auroras gleam on the golden sun.
The cinnabar chambers gleam with towering splendor; numinous fragrance encircles the jade chamber.
The Noble Scion joins the Hall of Celebration; stepping and singing, they lead the Emperor’s Oneness.
The Three Origins merge in the Union Palace; their subtle words are most profound.
Should you wish to mark the years of destiny’s transcendence, contemplate in stillness—do not mix with the impure.
Though the Silent may seem as if it were nothing, the Perfected emerge from within the Void.
Celebration extends without fail; the Seven Mysteries are naturally delivered.
Through accumulated blessings, the foundation is weighty; the roots of past lives are all dissolved.
The jade scriptures contain wondrous chapters—guard this passage, do not forget or lose it.
Abide in the memory of the numinous taboo; the Dao descends, uniting with the Mysterious Oneness.

*Brahma-Māyā Heavenly King*
*The Eighth Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

The Nine Mysteries’ Primordial Qi surges through the cavernous origin,
Purple purity ascends to the Jade Empyrean.
Spiritual radiance illumines the Golden Gate;
divine harmony flourishes in jade-laden branches.
Vast and open, the Purple Void’s hall—
auspicious clouds follow transformation and dissolve.
Deep echoes strike the numinous mechanism;
dharma drums resound through the Great Obscurity.
Feasting on the scene at the Mysterious Dawn Pass,
revolving currents brush the ethereal gale.
Guiding the reins beyond the Nine Heavens,
one drives the chariot in carefree roaming.
Lingering upon the Purple Radiance Peak,
elegance graces the Jade Emperor’s court.
Ten thousand kalpas pass in but an instant—
in a flash, the two symbols converge.
The empty courtyard admits no delay;
departure and return follow the vast turning.
Great transformation alters not its measure—
the Three Origins’ caverns and numinous standards.
The Resplendent Writ blesses the spirit chamber;
the Jade Scripture orders the pure hymn.
Convergent splendor arises from the Mysterious Upright;
returned countenance is no mere floral adornment.

*Parīta-Harmony Heavenly King*
*The Ninth Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao*

Primordial qi congeals in the Nine Empyreans;
the Purple Void illumines the Great Yang.
Flying jade ascends in radiant splendor;
flowing essence crystallizes as jade frost.
Celestial perfected ride the turning course;
subtle clouds flourish upon the Mysterious Beam.
Dark union arises from mutual resonance—
the Cinnabar Empyrean reflects light movement.
The hidden tryst lies in the Lofty Dawn Mansion;
carrying the covenant, one pays court to the Jade Capital.
Numinous transformation surges within the vast expanse—
the boundless turning of the obscure is manifest.
Flowing fragrance veils the vermilion sun;
whirling winds swiftly bear rare incense.
Resplendent above the Golden Gate,
jade terraces disgorge jade blossoms.
Orchid and zhi fill the Mysterious Valley;
gazing upward, the six positions flourish.
Divine ease stirs the Silent Palace;
profound thought penetrates the cavernous realm.
Holding the covenant in the Grand Empyrean Hall,
one returns to truth through the jade scripture’s verses.

The *Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ’s Imperial Chapters* all employ the Nine Mysteries’ subtle words. The Nine Heavenly Kings, within the Empty Cavern and prior to the Primordial Beginning, ordered destiny through mysterious songs, roaming and celebrating in the Empyrean Court. Their phrases, empty and subtle, arise from within the Mysterious; the divine perfected’s precious secrets are thus inscribed in these numinous scrolls.

Those who practice this Dao attain rank equal to the Nine Heavens. Through subtle contemplation of the supreme taboo, preserving the spirit and recalling the true, numinous omens respond and manifest—naturally ascending to the Dawn. Whenever cultivating this Dao, one should choose the eight nodal days of one’s life-destiny, bathe and purify with fasting, enter the chamber at the central hour, face east, and knock the teeth nine times. Gazing upward, one visualizes the Nine Heavens above, where nine-colored flying clouds and streaming light descend, suffusing the chamber with misty radiance. Silently invoking the taboo names of the Nine Heavenly Kings, one recalls the true spirits and recites the nine chapters of the *Jade Scripture of the Resplendent Writ of the Taixiao* once through, thereby celebrating the Empyrean Court. The spirits rejoice in the silent chamber; the Nine Mysteries respond with numinous resonance. Following this method for nine years, one succeeds in riding the flying scene, guiding the reins in the Purple Dawn.

Should the Nine Heavens’ roaming celebration descend to inspect the assembly of the myriad immortals on the day of the Mysterious Convergence, one should perform the Upper Clarity fast and recite the scripture once at the appointed time. Thus, the Nine Heavens record one’s name, distinguishing one as a Supreme Perfected. After nine years without lapse, one attains the rank of Upper Immortal.

The Imperial Chapters are all born of the Nine Heavens’ primordial essence. The Nine Heavenly Emperor-Kings’ hidden writings and precious names, talismanic seals and jade secrets, are fully revealed within. Those who bear this text become equals of the Nine Heavens’ perfected; the ten thousand spirits bow in reverence, and the host of immortals welcomes with escort. One commands the demons of heaven, moves without hindrance, rides clouds and drives the void, roaming and feasting in the Great Emptiness. This text is most subtle—the ancestor of the ten thousand emperors. Those who master this secret become kings of immortals. Should one recklessly transmit it, one will die and toil in the Nine Springs; calamity will extend to the seven ancestors, all consigned to fill the river’s source. Through ten thousand kalpas of torment, one must carefully uphold and practice this.

The two hundred forty sounds of the Right Jade Scripture’s Emperor Chapters are all the primordial essence of the Nine Heavens, the names of the ten thousand perfected. They are to be carved upon jujube-heart wood, received upon tablets of secluded cliffs and limpid springs, and bestowed upon flying silk kerchiefs. Facing north, one swears an oath to the Nine Heavens and reverently receives the Nine Heavens’ chapters. The disciple holds nine taels of refined gold and ninety feet of purple silk, prostrates toward the south, and the master recites the Jade Scripture to transmit it to the disciple.

If one has not yet obtained the carved script or seal, one may also write with orpiment upon azure-green silk, swear an oath to transmit it, and afterward gradually carve the script, ascending a mountain to pledge before the Nine Heavens. If carving the Jade Scripture upon jujube-heart wood, one must not suspend the seal toward the four directions; it is to be stored in a jade casket within a separate chamber, aligned toward the heavens above. Morning and evening, one burns incense and bows in worship to the King of the Nine Heavens.

Should one wish to summon the immortal officials of the Eastern Marchmount to inquire of auspicious and inauspicious omens or the methods of communicating with spirits and attaining perfection, on a *jiǎ*-*yǐ* day, one faces east and recites the Emperor Chapter once, and the immortal officials will arrive at once, speaking with the perfected. To summon the Southern Marchmount, on a *bǐng*-*dīng* day, follow the same method, and the immortal officials of the Southern Marchmount will arrive at once, communicating with the perfected. To summon the Western Marchmount, on a *gēng*-*xīn* day, follow the same method, and the immortal officials of the Western Marchmount will arrive at once, speaking with the perfected. To summon the Northern Marchmount, on a *rén*-*guǐ* day, follow the same method, and the immortal officials of the Northern Marchmount will arrive at once, communicating with the perfected. To summon the Central Marchmount, on a *wù*-*jǐ* day, follow the same method, and the immortal officials of the Central Marchmount will arrive at once, communicating with the perfected.

For all methods of summoning the Five Marchmounts, one faces the proper direction, knocks the teeth thirty-six times, and then recites the Emperor Chapter. With a heart purified through fasting and abstinence, no spirit will fail to descend. If one’s body is defiled by clamor or impurity and has not yet penetrated the dark mystery, one may close the eyes and concentrate the spirit—none will fail to see the gods. One will naturally investigate the hidden and examine the obscure, knowing the omens of fortune and misfortune. Within nine years, one’s form will become the same as the perfected, emerging from emptiness and entering the void, roaming and feasting in the Jade Dawn. When one’s cultivation of the Dao is complete, perfected beings will descend, cloud chariots and purple canopies coming to welcome one’s body.

One should stamp the seal of the Emperor Chapter upon the soles of both feet and the palms of both hands, and at once one will grow feathers and wings, ascending together with the perfected. If, in the secluded and tranquil places of the Five Marchmounts, one cultivates and recites the scriptures, and strange beings assume the forms of the perfected to descend into one’s chamber, one should face them with the seal of the Emperor Chapter, and truth and falsehood will be immediately revealed. If they are true perfected beings or immortal officials, one should bow in reverence and welcome them, presenting requests as one wishes and obtaining essential teachings. If they are demonic spirits, they will revert to their original forms. One should knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the Emperor Chapter once, and the demon will vanish, its form extinguished before one.

Such methods require only that heart and mouth correspond; one must be careful not to show them to others. To show them and leak the truth is to render the Dao ineffective. When one sleeps alone at night, one should place the Emperor Chapter upon the heart, and the perfected immortals of the Great Empyrean will come to guard one. One’s form and shadow will respond to dreams and thoughts, speaking with the perfected. Within nine years, one will meet the perfected face to face.

One must not recklessly reveal the seal of the Emperor Chapter to others; if three people learn of it, its efficacy will cease. In cultivating this Dao, one must be careful not to tread upon filth or offend the perfected spirits. To violate this is to incur the Nine Heavens’ judgment, which will seize one’s body. If one possesses the mysterious charts of the Emperor’s writ, green characters and purple script, golden bones and jade marrow, one’s name inscribed in the Azure Palace, the Nine Heavens will naturally send the perfected of the Four Poles to bestow the Jade Scripture’s Emperor Chapter upon one’s body.

If one has karmic affinity and encounters an enlightened master, all is due to the mysterious alignment of fate, and one is destined to obtain this scripture and become a supreme immortal. One should present the sincerity of gold and silk, approach the master in purity and fasting, and reverently receive and cultivate it. Without a pledge of faith, heaven will not open its numen, the perfected will not descend, and one will never attain immortality. If a master transmits it carelessly, judgment will extend to the seven ancestors, who will forever serve as ghostly officials. Clearly and cautiously observe the mysterious statutes; do not recklessly disclose them.

When transmitting the *Great Empyrean Jade Scripture’s Jade Emperor Chapter*, one should do so in a high, empty, and secluded place. Spread a flying silk kerchief toward the north, place offerings of incense cakes, jujubes, and fruits upon it, arranged on a separate tray, and set the scripture upon the flying silk. The master faces north, knocks the teeth thirty-six times, and respectfully invokes the Nine Numinous Primordial Perfected of the Mysterious Beginning’s Upper Palace, the Golden Immortals and Jade Maidens, the Great One’s numinous spirits, the supervisors of the perfected and rectifiers, the Five Thearchs and host of perfected. Say: “Now there is so-and-so of such-and-such Marchmount, Master Wang, whose purple net binds his embryo and whose past life predestines him for immortality. Bearing the sincerity of gold and silk, he seeks to receive the numinous scripture, the Nine Heavens’ true taboo names and Jade Emperor Chapter. By heaven’s statutes, he swears to treasure the numinous and true. May divine radiance descend, mysteriously illuminating your humble servant. If this is leaked, may my body return to the river’s source, my seven ancestors atone for their sins, and I never again attain immortality.”

When finished, the master hands the scripture and chapter to the disciple. Afterward, the cakes and fruits are buried in the dark Marchmount and may not be used for other purposes. This is the secret mystery of the Nine Heavenly Kings, the wondrous method of the Great Perfected. Scholars who cultivate without this scripture labor in vain upon empty mountains, receiving no response in silent courtyards. With diligent and sincere devotion, contemplating the Nine Mysteries, the Heavenly Kings will be moved and pleased, sending jade lads and jade maidens to guard one’s body. Within nine years, one will ride flying jade and ascend to the Nine Heavens.

Here ends the first scroll of the *Great Perfected’s Great Empyrean Jade Scripture*.

**Great Perfected’s Great Empyrean Jade Scripture, Scroll Three**

**Essential Practices of the Three Vehicles**

According to the *Highest Supreme Jade Emperor’s Four Poles Luminous Regulations*:
- **Upper Palace, Twenty-Four Articles**:
  Seven articles detail the demotion, dismissal, and promotion of ranks for various officials; seventeen articles prescribe the formats and ritual decorum for the Yellow, Red, Three Caverns, and Five Marchmounts.
- **Lower Palace, Twenty-Four Articles**:
  Twenty-two articles list the sixty-six scrolls from *Left Yi* to *Flying Empyrean*, with their secret instructions; two articles govern the reception of scriptures and the methods for encountering sacred texts.

Next, the *Left Palace of the Great Mystery Capital’s* *Female Azure Four Poles Thirty-One Scrolls Independent Treasure Scripture Luminous Regulations*:
- **Statutes, Twenty-Four Articles**:
  Thirty-nine chapters conclude with the fifty-six fascicles of *Numinous Flight Six Jia*.
- **Right Palace, Twenty-Four Articles**:
  Three articles on the three divisions of instructions; six articles on the *Cavern Mystery Three Sovereigns*, *Five Marchmounts*, divine talismans, *Golden Liquor Scripture* methods, and ritual formats; fifteen articles on ritual vestments, scripture recitation, purification, and decorum.
- **Central Palace, Twenty-Four Articles**:
  Seven articles on worldly offerings, reverence for masters, and prostration rites; nine articles on entry and exit, visualization, prohibitions, purification, sleep, excretion, and remedies for lunar eclipses; eight articles on receiving scriptures, fasting, transcription, transmission, and pledges—dividing the text into three parts and forbidding aimless wandering.

Next, the *Three Grades of the Supreme Nine Perfected Luminous Regulations*:
- **Upper Grade, Nine Articles**:
  Eight articles from the transmission of the *Great Cavern True Scripture* to the *Six Jia*; one article on transmitting talismans for the *Square Zhang*.
- **Middle Grade, Nine Articles**:
  Articles on admonitions and transgressions.
- **Lower Grade, Nine Articles**:
  Articles on redemption of sins.

The three divisions are difficult to seek; follow these essential practices. The uses of the Three Vehicles are largely similar with minor differences, while the fruits of one’s karmic deeds differ greatly with minor similarities. Without profound understanding, none can discern them. For urgent practice, the three divisions are essential.

In applying these methods, refine your judgment: do not force what you cannot endure, nor press others to undertake what they are unfit for. Forced persuasion invites mutual blame and disaster; reckless presumption leads to demotion and punishment. Purify the body with sincerity, transform evil with goodness, test yourself and others, and follow the wondrous instructions in all matters—residence, attire, offerings, invocations, reception, practice, transmission, and exchange—ensuring exactness. Do not betray the unseen and the dead, nor fail your own abilities. Do not neglect yourself, nor burden others; do not defy masters and friends, nor disgrace the true Dao. Fear no slander, nor shame kin or strangers; doubt neither far nor near, nor waver before high or low. Feel no remorse for vows, nor gratitude toward ancient worthies. The worthy and sagely will surely fast; demons and deviants will be subdued. Among practitioners of the Three Vehicles, there are but minor distinctions of excellence.

**Second: Instructions on the Four Poles Luminous Regulations**

The preface to the *Four Poles Regulations* states: Those who bear a golden name and receive the Four Poles must adhere to the statutes and be welcomed by the four realms’ overseers. Sever ties with yin and yang, avoid worldly associations. The filth of life and death offends the true numina; consuming the five pungent herbs disrupts qi in the stomach palace, harming essence and losing spirit. Baring the body before the Three Luminaries disrespects the Jade Dawn, inviting self-inflicted blame and calamity that destroys one’s person.

Do not recklessly discuss scriptures with ordinary learners, nor debate profound antiquity. Though your intent may reach the highest truth, do not propagate what is not yours to share. Revealing the source of the Dao to the uninitiated brings misfortune upon seven generations.

On the eight solar terms and one’s birth date, purify with fasting and burn incense to repent before the Emperor Lord, redeeming sins from the Nine Yin and dissolving the Seven Mysteries.

- At *Lichun* and *Chunfen*, light nine lamps in the central courtyard.
- At *Lixia* and *Xiazhi*, light three lamps.
- At *Liqiu* and *Qiufen*, light seven lamps.
- At *Lidong* and *Dongzhi*, light five lamps, and twelve lamps for one’s birth date.

At midnight, place the lamps facing the king; for one’s birth date, face the Year Star. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and softly recite the incantation:

*Highest Supreme Perfected, Ten Thousand Sage Emperors,
Five Emperors of Jade, Overseers of All Immortals,
On this auspicious day, the eight solar terms and my birth date,
I lay bare my yang sins and yin punishments,
Sever the Nine Yin, and from this moment,
Uplift the Seven Mysteries.
Deliver me from the fiery realm,
Eternally escape the Mountain of Knives.
The Three Paths and Five Sufferings
Shall no longer burden my body.
May I equal heaven and earth,
Eternally safeguard the Imperial Dawn.
May the Five Vows and Eight Assemblies
All be fulfilled as spoken.*

Upon completion, remove your headscarf and kowtow one hundred twenty times, pressing your forehead to the ground without causing pain.

Upon completion, don the headscarf once more and lift your gaze to the heavens, silently reciting in your heart: *"Today, this body receives the celestial grace bestowed from above, returning to its form to be reborn as a flying immortal."* Finish by knocking the teeth and swallowing qi twenty-four times.

After three years of such practice, all past transgressions shall be eradicated, the body shall become one with the Perfected, and the Five Sufferings shall no longer be tread. Escaping the fiery realm, one shall attain the joyous feasts of the Perfected in the Celestial Chambers.

The statutes of the Upper Palace decree: Those who receive the Shangqing scriptures must not alter celestial texts, deface Daoist scriptures, or smear and erase sacred characters, nor neglect the divine writ. Three violations shall nullify merit and sever karmic ties for a decade; only after purifying oneself and offering repentance may one resume cultivation. Five violations shall consign the offender to the Left Bureau’s custody, where the seven generations of ancestors and the self shall be cast into the Mountain of Knives.

When transcribing the scriptures, prepare one copy for veneration. Place it in a separate chamber, upon a dais five feet and five inches high—corresponding to the numerical harmony of heaven and earth—with a width and length of four feet and nine inches, aligning with the four seasons. Thus, the scriptures bear the names of the four seasons. Morning and evening, burn incense and prostrate before the scriptures to invoke the divine.

No profane or defiled persons may enter the chamber, lest they violate the prohibitions. During the reception of scriptures and purification rites, burn incense in a separate chamber, disengage from worldly affairs, and purify the paper and brush. Begin transcribing the scriptures facing east. While transcribing, one must not chant the text aloud. Every character must be compared and verified thrice; failure to adhere to the ancient canons, omissions, or errors in wording shall deduct ten kalpas from one’s lifespan. Misconduct shall be adjudicated by the Right Bureau, and in this life, one shall face the Wind of Knives, seeking death in vain.

The name of the Great One, the Lord of the North, must not be divulged to the uninitiated. The same applies to all that follows when facing north.

The Lower Palace Regulations state: All who possess the Supreme Scriptures must have the bone constitution of an immortal, abandon their homes and forsake their wives, wander among the Five Peaks, maintain perpetual fasting in the mountains and forests, concentrate their thoughts with苦念, consume only at the proper time, and sustain themselves with plain water and a bamboo bowl. They must endure neither toil nor cold, and remain diligent morning and evening, thereby moving the Jade Bureau of the Imperial Sovereign to dispatch the Three Primes to their chamber. After three years of chariot-driving, they shall ascend to the Great Clarity. Should one treat the sacred texts with disdain, defile or neglect the numinous scriptures, disseminate or reveal them, allowing the world to witness them, or violate their oaths and vows, calamity shall befall their seven ancestral lineages and themselves. They shall be cast into the Knife Mountain, forced to consume fire and devour coals, and made to bear the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Night.

Those who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity, though by karmic encounter they may not yet abandon their homes to enter the mountains, may remain in the world if their hearts revere and their minds respect the mysterious and numinous. They shall establish a separate chamber for worship, burn incense morning and evening, and bow in reverence upon entering and exiting, as if serving a sovereign or father. In matters of supplication, all shall be granted according to their wishes. Heaven shall dispatch jade lads and jade maidens to attend and protect the scriptures, observing the sincerity of their hearts. Those who devote themselves to the ancestral teachings shall naturally move the spirits to respond. Their desires shall be fulfilled, disasters averted, and misfortunes dispelled. Myriad demons shall be subdued, and a thousand spirits shall perish. They shall enjoy prosperity, auspiciousness, and flourishing official positions. Those who seek the Dao shall attain it; those who seek office shall obtain it. Their descendants shall thrive, and gold and treasures shall be as abundant as forests. After seven years of adherence to the rites, a perfected person shall descend to their chamber to commune with their spirit, imparting essential teachings. Without study, they shall achieve mastery; without toil, they shall attain immortality. Thus, the superior scholar who studies the Dao does so in accordance with the Three Revolutions.

Should one encounter the teachings yet refuse to receive them, it is due to their fate. To receive yet not believe is to forfeit one’s life. To believe yet not treasure is to incur true guilt. When these three conditions are met, the Seven Ancestral Lineages and oneself shall be examined and extended in lifespan. Should one fail, the Left and Right Bureaus shall punish them with the Wind of Knives, subjecting them to the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Nine Calamities, Eight Difficulties, and ten thousand kalpas of rebirth outside the Dao of humanity.

**Essential Precepts of the Bright Regulations, Third Section**

The Right Palace Regulations state: The Most High Supreme Perfected Jade Emperor, the Jade Clarity Perfected Ones, the myriad immortals and hosts of sages, and all those who have attained the Dao wear the *Bright Regulations of the Supreme Perfection*. All scholars who study these teachings receive the *Nine Perfected Bright Regulations*. The Most High Great Dao Lord receives the *Four Poles Bright Regulations*, which are the lofty jade precepts of the Four Illuminations.

When practicing the scriptures of the Supreme Clarity and entering the chamber, one shall wear a deer-skin mantle and headscarf, or a ramie headscarf, with a purple outer robe and blue inner garment. The mantle shall be four feet and nine inches wide and five feet and five inches long, with twenty-four outer strips and fifteen inner strips. The collar and sash shall match in purple, or one may wear a dark cap. For women of the Great Grotto, all are Ladies of the Primordial Sovereign. They shall wear a purple gauze robe, using two zhang and four chi of fabric, divided into thirty-six strips, with twenty-three strips for the body. Their blue gauze skirts shall be forty-five chi long, with eight panels, each four feet and nine inches wide, totaling thirty-two strips, with the remainder used for the skirt ties.

Both men and women shall retain jade lads and jade maidens, twelve each, to manage their ritual vestments. Upon entering the chamber, they shall knock their teeth together three times outside the door, close their eyes, and visualize the chamber filled with purple cloud qi enveloping their bodies. Jade lads shall attend to their left, and jade maidens to their right, with golden light and precious mushrooms illuminating the interior and exterior. They shall recite the incantation:

*"The heavens are bright and the qi is pure; the Three Luminaries illumine all. Within the golden chamber and secluded room, five mushrooms bloom as treasures. Dark clouds and purple canopies descend to adorn my form. Jade lads and jade maidens bestow their numinous power upon me. The Nine Emperors and Celestial Sceneries unite their chariots with the Three Primes. I shall ascend on a flying canopy into the Purple Court."*

Upon completion, they shall draw in qi thirty-nine times, then enter the chamber to perform the rites and bow in worship. The recitation of the *Yellow Court* has separate precepts.

When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, the Five Emperors shall gird their sashes, and the Four Bureaus shall attend in their positions. One must not pause while reciting the scriptures or converse with outsiders. To omit a single phrase is to forfeit a hundred; to omit five phrases is to forfeit five hundred. Should one err at the outset of recitation, they must begin the entire section anew. They shall fix their gaze upon the scriptural text and concentrate their thoughts on the divine perfected ones, without allowing other thoughts to disrupt the celestial sounds.

For texts under a thousand characters, no refreshments may be taken. For texts of a thousand to five thousand characters, one refreshment may be taken; for ten thousand characters, two refreshments; and for over ten thousand characters, three refreshments. No refreshments may be taken indiscriminately. If fatigued after ten thousand characters, one may pause to rest, but must complete the recitation before the night ends.

Men and women studying together may share the same chamber but must occupy separate beds facing north, with men to the east and women to the west. They must not sit, rise, or rest together on the same mat. First, they shall present the talisman of the Golden Perfection to subdue demons, then recite the thirty-nine chapters of the scriptures.

They shall sit within a square zhang, sweeping and purifying the interior and exterior, ensuring all is immaculate. They shall burn incense and light lamps, severing all external distractions. The implements for worship—tables, cases, cloths, and wrappings—must not be lent to others.

The Central Palace Regulations state: There is a jade text named *Green Palace*, comprising thirty-one scrolls. Those who cannot yet relinquish their burdens or seclude themselves in the mountains, constrained by worldly affairs or lacking mountain resources, may still worship it in the world, bowing morning and evening as if serving a sovereign or father.

Those with spouses may also cultivate the Dao of the Seven Scriptures. The Supreme Perfected Celestial Sceneries and the Ladies of the Primordial Sovereign shall descend. Those of the Dao who form bonds with celestial counterparts shall harmonize their qi, for this too is determined by fate.

They shall honor their teachers and ancestral masters as if they were divine beings. Upon entering the chamber to burn incense, they shall first visualize their teacher’s location, bow in their heart before their teacher, and then proceed with the rites. They must not engage in frivolous speech, deceive their fellow students, entice or seize scriptures, slander their teachers, fabricate baseless claims, or reveal sacred precepts to the uninitiated.

All who possess golden names may receive the precious scriptures, transmitting them in accordance with the regulations and pledges, and only to those deemed worthy. Should a disciple violate these precepts after transmission, the sin shall extend to the teacher’s person.

Men and women studying together shall jointly honor their teacher and ancestral master. Upon entering the chamber for fasting and purification, they shall proceed according to the depth of their studies, with those of shared virtue preceding others, and seniority determining the order among equals. Those of superior virtue and high talent shall serve as the Great Dharma Masters.

Let no rivalry arise, nor mutual disrespect be shown. Those who jointly honor their covenanted master shall harmonize their intentions in beauty, their qi resonating in accord, their conduct and bearing aligned as one. In all actions, they shall strive that each attains the true Dao together, that all receive the master’s Way, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

They shall not assail one another, nor stir discord among those of shared root. Let no clamor of tongues arise, nor groundless slander be uttered. Though bound by the same covenant and master, if their countenance betrays displeasure, if they exalt themselves and contend for immortality, they shall become adversaries, like sworn enemies. They shall be seized by the Four Controllers and barred from attaining immortality.

For all who receive the Shangqing scriptures, on the eight seasonal nodes, they shall present a pair of golden rings and nine feet of blue silk to their master. The master, upon receiving these tokens, shall inscribe the disciple’s name, prefecture, commandery, county, village, and the year and month along the length of the nine-foot blue silk. At the side of the Dark Peak and the Absolute Peak, facing north, he shall submit the name to the Azure Palace, knocking his teeth twenty-four times and softly reciting the incantation:

*"The heavens revolve, qi radiates, the eight paths convey essence. The Three and Five respond in due time, the Nine Blessings alternate in turn. The primordial true and mysterious quiescence aids the imperial spirit of the minister. The jade writ has been received; now the disciple’s name is submitted. Reverently I address the Nine Bureaus and the spirits of the Five Peaks. Record those I have listed, that they may ascend to the Jade Purity. After three years, come to welcome [the disciple’s] form, bestow the eightfold radiance, and ascend to the court of the Supreme Emperor."*

When finished, he shall bury the blue silk beneath an absolute cliff. After three years thus, the true shall descend.

If one receives the precepts but fails to submit this name, the Azure Palace shall hold no record, and the Four Controllers shall seize them, meting out the same punishment as for theft. Should the master pass away first or reside too far to deliver the rings and silk, the disciple may proceed independently. Yet if even one seasonal offering is omitted, they shall not attain immortality.

All who cultivate the supreme Way shall pacify their hearts and still their intentions, guarding the true in silence. In all goings and comings, they shall hold the Dao in mind as their very body. Through pure fasting and adherence to the precepts, they shall calculate their days until ascension.

They shall not indulge in rage or fury, nor bind their qi with resentment. Let no curses or invocations summon spirits, lest they offend the celestial statutes and summon the officers of punishment. They shall reflect that the crawling and flying creatures of the Ten Heavens, whether born or unborn, all attain the true Dao. May the heavens universally prosper, and when merit is complete and virtue perfected, they shall ascend on the appointed day.

They shall not harbor thoughts of rebellion, nor harm living beings with their hands. Let no envy arise toward those who surpass them, nor desire for others’ downfall. If their conduct lacks goodness and evil takes precedence, this prohibition is especially grave, and the officers of the right shall bind them in judgment.

They shall reflect on the five viscera and six bowels, purified within, the inner and outer elixirs aligned in essence. The precious flower shall weave its network, the spirits radiant and bright. They shall not drink wine to excess, nor stumble in drunkenness, lest the five spirits of the viscera take flight in alarm, their resolve falter, and their cultivation fail. Internal heat shall assail them, and they shall wither away in due time. Such study is but a vain labor of the heart.

They shall bathe and wash regularly, for cleanliness is urgent. Their sandals, shoes, and garments shall remain unstained, lest the true spirits depart and malevolent forces take advantage.

They shall not recklessly enter defiled places, nor weep in sorrow, nor mourn the dead. They shall not expose themselves to the Three Luminaries, nor sleep with eyes closed in darkness. They shall not disrobe or bare their form, nor insult the spirits of their body or disgrace the true scriptures, lest the true spirits depart and only an empty corpse remain.

They shall not sit or lie with those of the yin household, nor share clothing or bedding with those whose qi differs from theirs, nor exchange sandals or shoes. They shall not face north toward their life’s origin in two places to relieve themselves, lest they offend the Jade Dawn and profane their true nature.

When practicing the Way of the August Flower, on the days of lunar eclipses and new moons, when celestial qi wages war and the two symbols clash, they shall follow the purple writ’s precepts to protect and rescue themselves. Without this practice, they shall not cultivate the methods of the sun and moon.

All who receive the supreme scriptures shall first face the fast, initiate the covenant, and then transmit. If the covenant has not yet been initiated, they shall announce the beginning of the fast and the scripture’s transmission. Once the transmission is complete, they shall establish the covenant and confer the scriptures. To transmit without covenant binds both master and recipient to the judgment of the left and right officers, a prohibition of grave weight.

In this degenerate age, few seek the Dao, and the Three Heavens hasten their mandate, requiring worthy ones to assist in rectifying the era. If one’s bones are destined to receive these scriptures, they shall follow the Supreme Lord’s method of the Three Heavens and the Orthodox Unity.

Before seven years of receiving the scriptures have passed, when the azure register and jade name in the mysterious ledger remain unsettled, one shall not presume to act as a master.

The Supreme Lord often dispatches the Three Officers’ subordinates and the Four Divisions’ inspectors to traverse the world. Should they find one who has received the scriptures yet divulged them, they shall send down the *Nüqing*, seize their seven generations of ancestors, and consign them to the cauldron of boiling water in the Fire Realm. A single searing shall scorch their souls, and they shall tread the Knife Mountain for ten thousand kalpas, then bear the burden of the Stone Responsibility. Their own body and those who lightly received the scriptures shall together endure the trials of the Wind Knife in this life. They shall long for death but find none, and after their torment is complete, they shall be cast into the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Twenty-Four Prisons, the Three Paths, and the Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas, then resume the Stone Responsibility.

If, before the allotted years have passed, one encounters a person of jade-like nature destined for immortality who seeks these scriptures, they shall transmit them first to the enlightened Dharma-body, not obstructing the seeker’s path on account of their own incomplete transmission. If they guide and transmit to three persons of true nature, their merit shall move heaven, and the Jade Emperor shall issue a special decree to the Four Controllers, erasing their transgressions.

To receive the scriptures is to pledge one’s faith, and this pledge is as binding as the oath of cutting one’s hair and smearing blood. To receive the scriptures without faith is to transgress the heavenly Dao; to transmit them without covenant is to leak the heavenly treasure. Those who transmit and receive shall each beware their burden.

When a disciple offers tokens of faith, they shall divide them into two portions. One shall aid mountain-dwelling hermits to relieve the destitute, and one shall provide for their own ritual garments. Another portion shall be used to perform merit for the disciple’s seven generations of ancestors, purchasing incense, oil, and the like.

When presenting these tokens to the master, if they do not yet fulfill the precept’s requirements, and the years of transmission are to follow, they shall not take the tokens for themselves. They shall first deliver them to the immortal master to complete the prior allotment, and only then may they divide them into three portions.

To hoard the tokens of faith without distributing them, amassing wealth for other purposes, is to withhold boundless relief from the destitute and deny the seven generations of ancestors their merit of absolution. The disciple’s own body shall lack the vestments of the imperial and divine, offending the spirits and transgressing the Dao. Three such violations shall bar one from attaining immortality.

Those who bear the talismans and uphold the precepts must devote themselves to stillness and tranquility. They shall not wander or linger in mundane places, nor engage in frequent disputes with the common folk, contending in temper, harboring resentment, invoking heaven and earth, or offending the spirits and violating the prohibitions.

On the eight solar terms, the years governed by the Grand Year-Star, and the days of one’s own life-star, one shall ingest the fifteen supreme numinous talismans to dissolve karmic obstructions of the past, dispel the trials of wind, blade, water, and fire, transcend the eight difficulties, and after nine years, descend the Perfected.

Even those who have not yet received the great scriptures may singly employ these talismans. They shall separately receive the covenant tokens: two taels of gold and forty feet of purple silk inscribed with sacred writ, and transmit them after performing the purification rite.

On the day of receiving the talismans, one shall enter the chamber, burn incense, and facing east, strike the teeth twenty-four times, reciting the incantation:

*"O Radiant Numinous Jade Perfected, Supreme Sages of the Nine Mysteries, Jade Writ that secures the po, preserves the form, and anchors the spirit—through the three refinements and nine trials, my Dao is natural. May I transcend the Scarlet Capital, forever escape the Mountain of Blades, and the three paths and five sufferings never bind my body. I petition the Jade Bureau to inscribe my true name upon the Azure Register and Purple Tablet, the scripture of attaining the Dao. May the Three Origins align in splendor, the Nine Thearchs share the same chariot, and I ride the purple clouds to ascend the Dipper’s stars. May blessings flow to my seven ancestors, and together we attain the highest immortality."*

Upon completion, one shall ingest the talisman and swallow saliva twenty-four times. Following the method for three years, the roots of misfortune shall disperse, and one shall attain divine transcendence.

To receive the *Shangqing* scriptures without beholding the luminous precepts is to achieve nothing. Those who wish to study must first master the luminous precepts; to study after beholding the precepts is to succeed without labor.

Sweep clean the incense altar and reverently serve the divine spirits. For every transgression, promptly repent. Illuminate the courtyard with bright lamps, ingest the true talismans, dissolve sins, and preserve the form. The Jade Thearch shall be moved, discerning the disciple’s sincerity. The Jade Bureau shall have no record of karmic guilt, and the Mystic Capital no name of punishment. Heaven shall assign child-spirits to attend the disciple’s body, the Supreme Tenuity shall bestow regalia upon the seven ancestors, and the Southern Palace shall restore their forms to higher immortality. The wondrous Dao of the Supreme Perfected—diligently uphold and practice it.

All who bear the luminous precepts of the Four Poles shall have their names inscribed by the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, and reported to the Azure Palace. The Supreme Sage Thearch and the thirty-six Jade Lads of the Supreme Numinous, along with the twenty-four Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence, shall guard the disciple’s body, ward off calamities, avert misfortune, dissolve sins, eliminate afflictions, rectify transgressions, and reward merit, thereby communicating with the spirits and summoning the Perfected.

The disciple shall burn incense and perform morning and evening obeisance, reciting the precept texts thrice each month to ensure constant vigilance. They shall not treat the numinous writ with carelessness or defilement, nor recklessly disclose it to three others. Should they do so, their body shall perish and their form be maimed, while their seven ancestors endure the cycles of the Mountain of Blades and the Fire Revolutions.

The treasured scriptures shall circulate for seven hundred years. When one encounters a worthy recipient, they shall transmit them without hesitation.

Upon receiving the precepts, the tokens exchanged shall include ninety feet each of five-colored brocade and silk, forty feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, one golden dragon, one jade fish, and a jade tablet twelve inches in length.

The record shall be inscribed as follows:

*"In the such-and-such year of the reigning Grand Year-Star, on the such-and-such day of the such-and-such month, at the such-and-such hour, in the such-and-such prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the male or female Daoist Master So-and-So of the Such-and-Such Peak, of such-and-such age, born on the such-and-such day of the such-and-such month in the such-and-such year, whose life-star is governed by the Such-and-Such Peak and Such-and-Such Thearch, respectfully at the cliffs of the Mystic Peak’s lofty mountains, or at the such-and-such abode, swears an oath to the Nine Heavens, receiving the luminous precepts of the Four Poles, upholding the true Dao, and beseeching inscription upon the Purple Tablet and reporting of their name to the Azure Palace. Should they violate the covenant or betray the oath, they dare not aspire to immortality."*

The master shall face north, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and address the Supreme Numinous, Mystic Void, Great King of the Nine Heavens, Luminous August Jade Thearch, the Thirty-Nine Perfected, Supreme Sages of the Highest Mystery, the Lords of the Myriad Immortals’ Dao, the Overseers of the Numinous, the Jade Lads in Attendance, the Four Controllers, Five Thearchs, and the Overseers of the Perfected and Immortals:

*"Now there is the male or female Daoist Master So-and-So of the Such-and-Such Peak, who studies the great method and receives the treasured scriptures, totaling such-and-such volumes. Though mired in the mundane world, they have not yet ascended in body, yet their aspirations soar to the Mystic Void, roaming the numinous peaks. Indistinguishable from the world, they have not beheld the luminous precepts, or having beheld them, have neglected and transgressed, offending the numinous heavens. Now, in accordance with the covenant, they present tokens of faith, entrusting their fate and life, seeking to receive and request the precious oral instructions, totaling such-and-such volumes, along with the luminous precepts of the Four Poles. They shall abide by the luminous writ, swearing an oath to the Nine Heavens, vowing to be cautious and circumspect, to observe silence and cultivate diligently, to concentrate the spirit and contemplate the Perfected, in pursuit of divine transcendence. According to the time limits, when encountering true scriptures, they shall report to the Nine Heavens before transmitting them, daring not to leak them carelessly or show them to others. They hereby report above to the myriad spirits and below to the Five Peaks, Three Rivers, and Nine Sources, making all aware. Should they violate the covenant or betray the tokens of faith, may their seven ancestors, parents, and their own body forever endure the trials of the Left and Right Bureaus, tread the Mountain of Blades, consume fire in the twenty-four hells, and suffer the three paths, five agonies, and ten thousand kalpas of resentment. They only beseech the granting of true numina, the descent of jade lads and maidens to guard their body and form, an early ascent and transcendence, and flight to the Supreme Clarity. All prohibitions and precepts shall adhere to the covenant’s text."*

Upon completion, the master shall hold the scriptures and precepts in the left hand, while the disciple holds the tokens in the right hand. Facing heaven, they shall softly intone:

*"O Supreme Sages of the Highest Mystery, myriad thearchs of the Mystic Void—those in the world below who harbor aspirations shall steadfastly uphold them. We dare to proclaim the luminous precepts to restrain all transgressions. The jade scriptures and precious oral instructions shall all conform to the precepts’ authority. Through this, the body shall be delivered, and the myriad qi shall return in totality. May we long preserve heaven and earth, and the Three Luminaries shine together. Should we dare to leak them, may we forever renounce the four transgressions."*

Upon completion, the disciple shall place the tokens before them, receive the scriptures, face north, bow nine times, and depart.

This covenant also universally delivers the multitude of scriptures. Though each scripture has its own covenant, the Four Poles govern them all.

Should no jade tablets be available, purified hibiscus wood may be used. Once the ritual is complete, the tablet shall be read and buried beneath an isolated cliff. If the ceremony takes place in a hall, monastery, or altar, the tablet may be sent to a secluded mountain. For those of the Azure Palace rank who receive scriptures without tokens, the tablet shall be buried to report to the myriad spirits—yet without tokens, the message shall not reach them. Thus, tokens must never be omitted.

**Nine Perfected’s Luminous Precepts and Oral Instructions, Fourth Scroll: Middle Grade Precepts on Transgressions**

1. For all later learners: those whose seven generations of ancestors have committed murder, banditry, plunder, scheming, lechery, treason, or collusion with the nine clans in rebellion against the Dao—should they resolve to self-discipline, they must first inscribe the Seven Profound Heavy Sins, distribute merit through almsgiving, and deliver the souls of the dead. They shall bare themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen their hair and kowtow without ceasing for three years, reproach themselves with solemn vows, and cast the tokens into the Nine Rivers to redeem past transgressions.

2. For those whose own hands have taken lives, cruelly oppressed the lowly, slaughtered living beings, plundered the common folk, schemed in lechery, colluded with the nine clans, envied the worthy, or rebelled against their masters—should they bitterly repent and confess, perform meritorious deeds, bare themselves beneath the Three Luminaries, loosen their hair and kowtow for three years in atonement, and cast tokens into the river to expiate their sins.

3. For all learners who receive the Three Wondrous Precious Writs or the Esoteric Scriptures of Highest Clarity yet recklessly disclose their catalogs to the uninitiated, reveal their mysteries, or treat the sacred texts with contempt: for a first to tenth offense, they shall be penalized with three years of severed merit before being permitted to resume pure fasting and cultivation. Beyond this, their sins shall bind them to the Nine Yin.

4. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must not weep, encounter corpses, or come near blood or filth. For a first to tenth offense, they shall be penalized with one year of severed merit, after which they may follow the precepts to self-punish, redeem their sins in the Great Yin, and resume pure fasting and practice. At twenty-four offenses, they shall lose the scriptures and forfeit their lives.

5. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must not approach women or engage in yin-yang intercourse, thereby defiling their true qi. For ten to twenty-four offenses, they shall be penalized with three hundred days of severed merit, after which they may resume pure fasting and cultivation. Beyond this, they shall perish.

6. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must not harbor malice, commit violence, kill living beings, act with greed or treachery, envy the worthy, attack those of shared qi, or slander their scripture masters. For a first to fifth offense, they shall be permitted to atone with tokens and self-reproach, sever merit for ten years, and then resume pure fasting and cultivation of what they have received. Beyond this to twenty-four offenses, they shall perish.

7. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must not face north to relieve themselves, consume the five pungent vegetables or the flesh of the six livestock, drink wine to excess, violate the Dao, slight the precepts, or waver in devotion. For ten to twenty-four offenses, they shall follow the precepts to atone with tokens, repent in the Great Yin, sever merit for one year, and then resume pure fasting and cultivation of what they have received. Beyond this, they shall perish.

8. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must follow the precepts to present tokens, report to their master, and perform the fast before receiving the scriptures. They must not recklessly open the precious texts without first making the covenant. Commoners must not lightly copy, alter, or distort the sacred writs, invent interpretations, or corrupt ancient pronunciations to create their own methods. For a first to third offense, they shall sever merit for three years, follow the precepts to self-punish, cast tokens into the Nine Rivers, and perform pure fasting for thirty days before resuming cultivation. Beyond this to twenty-four offenses, they shall perish and be consigned to the ghostly officials.

9. For all who receive Highest Clarity scriptures: they must prepare a separate chamber with a high seat, four feet four inches in height and five feet in width, to invite the scriptures of the Most High. They shall light lamps, burn incense, and make morning and evening offerings with reverence. They must not allow those of impure qi, those who have encountered filth, or women to enter the chamber, lest they offend the divine perfected. Their clothing, footwear, rest, and movement must all differ from the common. For a first to twenty-fourth offense, they shall sever merit for one year before resuming pure fasting and cultivation. Beyond this, they shall perish.

**Lower Grade Redemption of Sins**

1. For those who commit the first sin of the middle grade: upon completing a year of self-reproach, they shall present nine pairs of gold rings, one golden figurine weighing one tael, and cast them into the Three Rivers.

2. They shall present one catty of true pearls, one writing knife, and one golden figurine weighing one tael, and cast them into the Three Rivers.

3. They shall present one golden figurine, one catty of true pearls, and one writing knife, and sink them.

4. At midnight in the central courtyard, they shall light thirty-two lamps.

5. They shall bathe in fragrant water in the courtyard and light twenty-four lamps.

6. They shall privately distribute treasures to the poor and provide a hundred-person feast to feed the hungry.

7. They shall offer ten catties of incense to ten fellow learners.

8. They shall offer one *hu* of pure oil to light lamps in the central courtyard, the quantity to be as they see fit, until the oil is exhausted. They shall also offer ten catties of incense to their master who holds the scriptures.

9. They shall light seven lamps before the hall.

The *Nine Perfected* states: All who receive the supreme methods yet fail to uphold the luminous precepts, thereby violating heavenly prohibitions, shall incur sins that burden their seven generations of ancestors and bring punishment upon themselves. Once they know to reform and repent, they must rigorously atone and return to the cultivation of what they have received. Should they relapse into transgression, their punishment shall double. Thus, their bones and fate shall no longer align, their form shall turn against the true, their souls shall join the ranks of ghosts, and they shall never again be permitted to repent or resume the study of the true scriptures.

These five grades of luminous precepts awaken the unawakened. Once aware, how can one dare to transgress? Those who uphold them must be vigilant.

All who receive the methods must vow to follow the precepts. Yet the precepts are many, and the years of life are few—those of short lives who cultivate them may fear they cannot fulfill them all. Gazing at their fleeting shadows, they are truly pitiable.

The Great Compassion imparts its teachings, permitting discretion in their application. Each must assess their own capacity, clearly aligning with the orthodox canon. The canon cannot be violated, nor may one’s judgment err. Weighing carefully to find the proper measure, responsiveness will surely follow.

These nine matters vary in gravity, encompassing all things in due order, leaving nothing hidden, whether subtle or manifest. Yet to practice each one in full would require years to complete. One may fear that merits remain unfulfilled while karmic retribution swiftly arrives. Should one attempt to hasten their cultivation, they may worry that their virtue remains shallow and their transgressions multiply.

Thus, their essence is distilled: three years may suffice for all. Within these three years, one must fulfill the nine practices with utmost sincerity, and resonance will assuredly be attained. If after three years no achievement is made, such a one is not of the middle grade or above, and is unworthy of discourse on the highest Dao. To speak of the highest with such a one would be labor in vain. Only those whose labor is not in vain shall accomplish the merits of a Perfected One of the Highest Grade within three years.

Upon such accomplishment, all grave transgressions shall be absolved. Minor faults within the allotted time shall also be cleansed. Practice in secrecy, with meticulous care and no negligence. Guard your words, and verification shall follow in due course.

First, when establishing a fast or performing the rite of releasing the ring, the days of the Three Primes are most auspicious.

Second, the day of one’s own life-destiny is also favorable for establishing or releasing the ring. If the year is unknown, the first year of the Jupiter cycle may be used.

Third, when establishing or releasing the pearl, the yin days of the six jia are best. The yin of jiazi falls on guiyou, and the rest follow accordingly.

Fourth, both establishing and releasing should be done on days and hours when the celestial stems are in mutual generation.

Fifth, choose days when the moon resides in the Eastern Well constellation; consistency from beginning to end is ideal.

Sixth, use the days of the Three Assemblies.

Seventh, use the days of the twenty-four qi.

Eighth, use the days of the eight solar terms.

Ninth, use *cheng* days.

For a fast of a thousand days, during which various methods are practiced without establishment or release, calculate the days of practice according to the above. Other days must not be used arbitrarily, for demons delight in testing and obstructing. Exercise utmost caution.

For a three-year fast, or one limited to a thousand days, set aside all other affairs. Prepare in advance the resources for clothing, food, ritual implements, and like-minded companions, ensuring all is settled beforehand. No worldly matters may intrude during the fast. Should public or private affairs, auspicious or inauspicious events, or unexpected disturbances arise to disrupt the fast, upon its conclusion, one must renew their vows with greater sincerity, repenting for transgressions and obstructions that caused the fast to falter, filled with shame and trepidation.

Minor transgressions may be atoned for through repentance, but grave transgressions must not exceed three occurrences. After three releases, no further establishment may be undertaken. Be solemn, vigilant, and discreet; do not discuss these matters recklessly with others. Malevolent beings and jealous ghosts seek to undermine one’s resolve and integrity. Only by repelling such influences can success be achieved.

If exposed lamps are extinguished by wind or rain, they must be relit. Should this occur thrice without improvement, the transgression is grave and the calamity severe. Redouble your repentance, purify your heart with utmost sincerity, and the limit is nine occurrences before cessation is required. Other matters follow this precedent.

All fasts employ the Three Prime repentance texts, which may be adjusted as needed. Recite the nine matters in order without redundancy. After resolving one matter, it need not be mentioned again. Beyond these nine, no further words are necessary. Within them, whether one knows or does not know, transgresses or does not transgress, reflect deeply upon oneself. For known transgressions, repent sincerely; remorse will cleanse them. For unknown or careless faults, one may still receive forgiveness. To repent without transgression incurs no blame.

Trace these matters to their farthest origins, from the beginningless past to the present, across past lives and this life, past selves and this self—none have not violated these nine precepts. To repent and resolve them ensures no further transgression, and enlightenment shall be attained on a set day, without doubt.

The peril lies in knowing but not acting, acting without precision, or precision without perseverance. Perseverance leads to ascension as a sage or Perfected One—the loftiest of immortals.

*Dongzhen Taishang Taixiao Langshu, Scroll Three*

*Dongzhen Taishang Taixiao Langshu, Wisdom Precepts, Scroll Four*

**Thought of the Dao Formula, Fifth**

All those with esoteric names, inscribed on azure registers or white tablets, must ever contemplate the Dao—wishing to revere it, to exalt it, to study it, to attain it, never forgetting it for even a moment. Though cravings for glory, music, wealth, and sensuality may arise without cease, one must neither be ensnared by their presence nor hindered by their absence. To relinquish them and return to the Dao, to transform through the Mysterious and True, to contemplate the Dao and guard Unity without entering dual gates—such is the person of wisdom, who may cultivate sageliness. Beginning and end remain unchanged, forever upright without deviation, and one shall attain immortality, merging with the Treasure of the Dao.

**Recitation Formula, Sixth**

The Dao is originally formless, yet responding to resonance, it generates images. The great image is imageless, its subtlety beyond comprehension. Thus, true scriptures appear, structuring emptiness into characters, distinguishing fortune from misfortune. The Perfected transmit and transcribe them, expounding and practicing their teachings.

Recite them with joy, receive them with devotion, practice them with diligence, and persevere without cease. Inquire to resolve doubts, untangle obstructions, and clarify beginnings and ends, never betraying the master’s intent. Do not recklessly distort or dare to subtract or add. Refrain from slander or clandestine pursuit. Follow what the master imparts, whether much or little, as circumstances allow. Do not dare to leak or neglect, nor to overstep bounds.

Overstepping incurs karmic consequences; karma depends on the master’s guidance. Later, one should study widely to deliver all beings. Memorize titles and sequences clearly.

One master is insufficient—ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand masters—until all is complete. Those incomplete are middling or lesser practitioners; the complete are great beings. Great beings of the great lineage deliver boundless multitudes, delving into the utmost Dao and penetrating the source of wisdom. Beginning and end remain unopposed, the body suffices to save beings. One shall attain immortality, merging with the Treasure of the Scriptures.

**Preservation of the Master Formula, Seventh**

Heaven and Earth spread qi; parents give life; the master and lord teach and transform, guiding toward the utmost truth. They refine the mundane into sageliness, punishing falsehood and rewarding truth. True immortals ascend to sageliness—none achieve this without a master.

The heart cannot be its own master; to take the heart as master is to court failure. Unless one is a supreme sage, one must not take the heart as master. Even sages who master the heart do not openly declare it; they still harmonize with radiance, mutually serving as masters and friends.

Without a master, the common person achieves nothing. Attainment of the Dao depends on the master; the master must never be forgotten. Preserve them in the heart, qi flowing continuously, thought unbroken, in unity with the scriptures and Dao.

The Treasures of the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master are called the Three Honored Ones. If any is lacking, there is no path to transcendence.

Preserve the sage and the master, honor the master and cherish the teachings—this is called great wisdom, unblemished from beginning to end. One shall enter the Mysterious, merging with the Treasure of the Master.

All three unite as the Three Treasures, the source of wisdom. The source is inexhaustible, gathering and governing all streams. Streams drift and forget their return; through karmic resonance, awakening arises. Each holds fast to resolve, urgently striving to return in time. Returning in time establishes merit; with courage and single-mindedness, reverse the flow to reach the source—this is called the supreme sage.

Those who study sageliness first stabilize the Three Lives: the life of the heart entering truth, vowing never to slacken; the life of the mouth practicing recitation, resolving all doubts; the life of the body maintaining reverence, wearing nothing contrary to the Dharma. Clothing embodies luminous virtue, understanding liberates the deluded. True realization is untainted; karmic entanglements instantly dissolve. Dissolving entanglements preserves joy, enduring through eternal kalpas, living without death—hence the Three Lives.

The affairs of the Three Lives proceed in sequence: in practicing the Dao and preserving the spirit, first arrange the Dharma robes; in contemplating truth and cultivating the Dao, first rectify the heart, then guard the mouth, and finally discipline the body. Body and mouth align, the heart harmonizes with both. The three unite to form virtue, virtue manifesting in attire. Donning and doffing follow proper times, distinct from the secular. Both inner and outer are observed, all actions scrutinized. Through this, luminous virtue is cultivated—it must not be diminished.

Thus, when first establishing study, the heart relies on the Three Honored Ones, the mouth invokes the wondrous scriptures, and the body models the Dharma robes. The system of Dharma robes varies by rank and grade; the general principles of ascent and descent are as follows.

**Dharma Robes Formula, Eighth**

Hemp headscarf, hemp unlined robe, cloth cloak, cloth skirt, hemp shawl, bamboo hand tablet, straw sandals.

The above are required for men receiving scriptures.

Dharma robes embody the principles of the Mysterious Number. Wearing them to practice the Dao, the Dao governs generation and completion, delivering all beings, uniting self and other—hence the name *Dharma robes*.

What is *Dharma*? It is karma and harmony—washing away filth, removing dust, calming desires, stilling the mind, focusing on the Mysterious Origin. The Ten Virtues form the karma; conduct and cessation align with the Dao. The Three Realms revere it, using uprightness to dispel deviation—hence it is called *Dharma*.

What is *robe*? It is submission and blessing—submitting to upright principle, attaining prolonged fortune, delivering body and spirit—hence it is called *robe*.

When robe and Dharma align, Dharma attains its proper method, refining and ascending to sageliness, dissolving all bonds and entanglements.

For those who cultivate and study, discard adornment and preserve simplicity. Though they cannot go unclothed, if proper robes are not yet complete, they may gather old and tattered cloth, coarse fabric and worn hides, washing them clean and sewing them into garments. They must not cut new material, avoiding excess and extravagance, patching and mending as needed.

These guidelines demonstrate the regulations, symbolizing the numbers of qi, harmonizing with the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth), deriving meaning therefrom, and contemplating non-action.

Through this non-action, one aligns with the Dao and accords with truth. What is the true Dao’s action? Merely to deliver beings without obstruction.

For beginners, assembling tattered cloth may be difficult. If coarse fabric is available, though new, it is not objectionable—provided the regulations and numbers align with the proper Dharma. For youths lacking headscarves, other items remain the same. Upon reaching the age of capping, the headscarf is made according to the Dharma.

After informing the master and initiating the Dao, one receives accomplishment. Give thanks for the grace of the Three Honored Ones and the assembly of precepts and fasts. Be vigilant, avoiding intoxication and gatherings with music.

If, like the disciple Wang Qiao, one emulates Qin Shi’s flute, or like Yu Shun, plays the zither; if one sings like Lady Cheng or harmonizes with cloud chimes—these are not forbidden to the ear.

Secular rituals may be suspended for Daoist practice. Yet when bowing to the honored, feeling their nurturing compassion, one must show utmost reverence—never neglecting this.

For marriage or official appointment, the ritual is solely the capping ceremony. When women receive the Dao, they first don the *chou* and later the *he*, with an additional *gu chou* resembling a single-layer robe; the rest remains the same.

Once the heart is settled in receiving the Dao, transcribe scriptures and prepare ritual implements without deficiency. Do not borrow or lend them for temporary use. It is fitting to craft them in advance and present them to masters and fellow practitioners for careful review. If they conform to the Dharma, keep them; if not, correct them to avoid misleading later generations. Once the matter is concluded, remove the former garments and don the proper Dharma robes.

The former garments were also the ritual attire of the ancient kings, but later generations distorted them. Thus, the present masters’ standards are definitive. What the present masters follow is the Dao of Lord Lao, who wore a *he* robe and jade within when departing through the pass, also donning a kudzu-fiber headscarf and single-layer robe, while jade maidens attended in layered *gu* and *he* skirts. Though the sage leaves no trace, traces exist to transform people. Those who follow the sage’s traces naturally align with the sage’s heart. When the heart attains spontaneity, this Dharma is supreme.

The three Caverns’ practices broadly align, with minor variations—all being separate teachings of Lord Lao. Those who attain the Dao and ascend to the Mystery naturally wear celestial robes. While in the world, they bestow their garments upon later virtuous ones. If their merit and conduct are incomplete and their human lifespan ends, their temporal robes do not accompany them, remaining as external attachments to the body.

The garments attached to the body are single-layer robes and *□si*. If serving in office, wear the official robes of one’s rank. Though one may have held office before, if at death one is in private life—or if a commoner held a post but received no posthumous honors—all wear single-layer robes and *□si*, not Dharma robes.

Dharma robes, scriptures, talismans, contracts, and records must all be returned to the original master. If the master has passed, entrust them to a guarantor, friend, or capable descendant or disciple. If no such person exists, follow the ultimate Dharma.

The ultimate Dharma has three methods: one, sink them in deep waters; two, conceal them in mountain caves; three, burn them in a pure place.

Those who dwell in mountain caves from beginning to end, or wander among people without marrying or holding office, may all wear headscarves and *he* robes. Keep the old without seeking the new, and do not layer them heavily.

Though one may have married or held office before, if later one leaves the household, or if husband and wife study together without indulging in worldly glory—even while among people, differing greatly from the world—one may also wear headscarves and *he* robes. For wives and concubines, the *gu* is worn; upon leaving the household, the *he* is donned. Women at home practicing the supreme Dharma, entering mountains and forests to compound elixirs, may also wear *he* robes. If their merit and conduct are insufficient and their karmic conditions lead to death, even if they achieve liberation through the corpse, they remain in *gu*.

Men wear single-layer robes, harmonizing with worldly rites. Those who differ greatly from the world wear caps, headscarves, and *he* robes. They are not placed in coffins or outer caskets but laid upon swept mountain stones or beneath deep forest trees, covered with a single quilt—on the ground is also permissible, without need for a bed or mat.

In high antiquity, the dead were sent to the wilderness, wrapped in thick clothing and kindling, then cremated, so the fire refined them and they swiftly dissolved. Later generations, bound by human sentiment, clung to love and attachment, unable to bear abandonment. Thus, ants, foxes, and crows ultimately desecrated them, and their ashes and earth merged forever with dust and waves.

Stone tombs have long been criticized, while simple cloth bags and thin linings have always been praised. To cultivate the Dao and aid the spirit, one must forget the physical form. To hastily arrange tombs burdens both the living and the dead.

None may secretly retain sacred texts or cling to Dharma robes, lest they sink into the netherworld’s depths and suffer calamity in both hidden and manifest realms. One should separately prepare methods for handling the deceased, refining and stabilizing the corpse, transforming decay into completion—though subtle, this is arduous. Those who awaken to this suffering should, while in their prime, diligently cultivate the Dao and arts, preserving both the self and the awakened.

The awakened (*wu*) is another name for the spirit; the self (*wo*) is another term for the physical form. In an instant, the self departs, but the awakened remains. Retaining the spirit stabilizes the form; stabilizing the form unifies the spirit. Unifying form and spirit—this is the supreme adept.

Those who separate spirit and body, restraining or severing their union, may yet rejoice in the turning wheel—this is the middle truth and above. Those who do not awaken and part, or do not part yet grieve, belong to the lower ranks.

The superior transform the inferior; the inferior, moved, follow the superior. Though body and spirit are not yet unified, one may attain mutual harmony and prolong life. As life extends, merit accumulates, and unity naturally arises. Guarding this unity depends on one’s clarity.

Enlightened rulers instruct their subjects, who should all receive the Dharma, with Dharma robes as the priority—to first examine the body. Consulting masters and seeking counsel examines the mouth. Studying scriptures and delving into their principles examines the heart.

Examining the heart with scriptures prevents deviant thoughts; examining the mouth with counsel eliminates harsh speech; examining the body with robes prevents improper conduct. Practicing the Dharma and guarding unity begins with the robes.

Unity has three aspects: the Three Ones, the True One, and the Great One—further, the Mysterious One. The methods of study differ greatly. Body and spirit are laid bare, traces are corrected to stir the times, and one responds to the era with wondrous manifestations. Those like Jiao Xian are not bound by robes.

For all, regardless of noble or humble, male or female, who have not yet embraced the Great Dao, or have embraced it but not received scriptures and Dharma, each may craft garments according to local customs, using colored or plain cloth, adjusting abundance or simplicity to the times.

If one enters the Dao from the secular world and is transformed into a lay follower, there are precepts for laypeople. Before becoming a disciple, one wears a talisman and participates in Dharma rites. Upon receiving scriptures and charts, one becomes a disciple, and the robes differ from those of laypeople.

When first requesting the Dharma, wear a *shenyi*, trousers, a cloth headscarf, and coarse *he* robe, along with boots, shoes, or sandals. Hands are clasped, holding a *shouban*, following local customs. Gradually teach and transform, without immediate change.

Those who receive talismans and have sons all wear single-layer robes, with headscarves and *qia* commonly worn, the choice of change left to the individual.

In ancient times, those holding office wore the same robes, with *jin xian* caps. Later, *jie ze* were added, along with leather belts, pouches, sashes, *hu* tablets, and shoes. When the lineage master entered Luoyang, referring to the *Tongyang* officials, he changed to the *xuan* cap, removing sashes and belts. The cap used black patterns, black silk, and kudzu-fiber cloth, resembling a *fu jin*. It was secured with a *gai* and *ye* border, with pins and tassels similar to those of the *jin xian* cap, worn tilted to the side.

The wearing of the *xuan* cap for mourning was forbidden, yet during the time of Emperor Wu of Wei, this cap was worn for condolence visits. Over many years, the Central Secretary Supervisor Xun Xu once wore it among the trees, where hanging branches caught it, denting its top. The present *qie* method of wearing it derives from this cap.

The ancient *xuan* cap originated from the hemp *mian* cap, which was preceded by the *fu jin* alone. The *fu jin* made of fine cloth of forty *sheng* had a width of two *chi*, with strips four *chi*, five *cun*, and six *fen* in length. Folding one strip horizontally and sewing it to both sides, the lower seam was left open for the topknot, while the back hung down to cover the shoulders. In heat, it was shortened to encircle the topknot; during purification rites, it was loosened and tied with a *yan* band.

Later ages, marked by frugality and decline, found fine cloth difficult to procure, so silk and kudzu fiber were used instead, and the size gradually diminished. Thus, when Confucius said, "I follow the pure and frugal," he aligned with the common practice. Yet in the earliest times, people all wore *rou ji* (meat topknots), their hair fine and short, hanging down thickly—called "cold hair," named for its protection against the cold. After the age of Fuxi, as the world grew decadent and *qi* thinned, *rou ji* gradually disappeared, and long hair became cumbersome. In border regions, some tied or cut it, while in the Central States, it was gathered into sideburns, then adorned and covered for warmth. With the use of the *fu jin*, caps naturally arose.

Divine immortals’ *rou ji* were fine as clouds. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, the black and white came to symbolize propriety. Above his head, ethereal *qi* rose towering to the heavens. He was granted the wondrous Dao, and the bestowal of robes and caps flourished in that era. As ages changed and laws diverged, modifications accumulated daily. Rank and hierarchy dictated differing caps.

In Yao’s time, there was a beast called *xiezhi*, its horns aligned forward. The cap imitated this, hence named the *Yao ze*, worn for official duties to adjudicate crimes and punish evil. Its upright division earned it the name "the Divider." Emperor Yuan of Han had unusual hair on his forehead, which he wished to conceal, so he added a *yan* band around the edge. Sometimes the cap left the top bare, with the band tied at the back, later sewn in place. When Wang Mang, being bald, began to cover the top, caps above it distinguished rank.

The *Pingtian* crown was the ancient *mian* cap. The virtuous and scholars wore the *zhangfu* cap of Mount Hua, arising with the times to distinguish civil and martial roles. From ancient times to the present, the Dao’s essence remains one, but transmission errors have led it from purity into turbidity—violence, indulgence, excessive sacrifices, and prayers for favor. Deviating from the Dao brings no blessing; malevolent spirits deceive, and petty ghosts grow bold. Some possess knowledge and insight, recognizing others’ virtue when their deeds and virtue are ascendant. They falsely claim auspicious omens as their own merit. When another’s virtue wanes and punishment is due, they feign divine warnings of impending disaster. The foolish believe them, and though coincidences occur—one in ten, perhaps—they fail to discern clearly, deeming them sacred. Their cravings know no end; when prayers go unanswered, their emotions invert, joy and anger unstable. This is called "vulgarity."

What is vulgarity? It is desire and haste. Desire stagnates and destroys; haste must be dispelled. Thus, the great Dao prizes desirelessness as its subtlety. Those who study goodness must strive to reduce selfishness and desire. Desire and minimal desire differ in the heart. To encourage progress in the Dao, attire must differ from the worldly. The world does not wear the *jin*, but it is part of the Daoist method, following the ancient reverence for the *xuan* tradition. The *jin* has corners, originally not forked in the center. The forked center, symbolizing □, was a later addition.

The front’s elliptical corners began with Guo Tai, styled Linzong, of the Later Han. When the court summoned those of the Dao, he declined official summons, always wearing the *jiao jin*. Once, traveling in rain, his *jiao jin* drooped. Admirers of his virtue, unaware of the reason, imitated the fold, making it elliptical like a lotus leaf. Later, it was pleated into three ridges, resembling the beams of the *jinxian* cap, though their numbers differed: one beam symbolized the one-horned beast, uniting the six directions; two beams, the two-horned beast, signifying just judgment in lawsuits; three beams, the three-horned beast, representing the king’s well-ordered laws and the proper alignment of the three systems. All such symbols arise from virtuous influence, hence Daoist scholars wear them.

No flower surpasses the lotus in splendor, and the Dao values its meaning, thus imitating its leaves. Size and height adapt to the wearer. Those with little hair secure it with a band, forgoing hanging tassels. In sum, it is called the *furong jin* (lotus cap).

There is also the *fuqu* crown, called *weimao* by the Zhou people. Its construction differs slightly, but its essence and use are largely the same. Originally, it was the crown of the divine sages of the heavens, all woven from three strands of purple cloud, or seven-colored ethereal mist, or nine luminous *qi*, forming naturally. It crowns the *rou ji*, unobstructed, harmonizing the body’s spirits. When the body’s spirits are pure and empty, the knot is not a hindrance—seeming flesh, bone, skin, blood, sinew, vessels, yet neither; being yet not being, acting yet non-acting. Non-being brings no burden; non-acting ensures perpetual wholeness. All semblances yet non-semblances are true *qi*. True *qi* is fundamentally one, transforming into myriad forms. Form unites with spirit; spirit and form become one, inseparable, beyond destruction or creation.

Thus, the Most High’s wondrous body eternally abides in the Jade Capital. With the eye of Daoist attainment, one naturally sees it. How could the mortal eye perceive it? Perception comes through study; diligent study brings understanding. At the moment of resonance, divine officials bestow gifts—sacred objects arrive, with robes and caps as the highest.

In ancient times, the Heavenly Perfected One bequeathed it to Emperor Ku; Lord Mao received nine gifts, including this crown. All who receive the Three Caverns may wear it. Beginners of shallow virtue must not wear it presumptuously.

Those who have not yet received the registers may still receive the scriptures, cultivate the precepts, and establish virtue. By practicing as taught, they may attain the true Dao without relying on the registers. Yet if one’s resolve remains incomplete and the Six Paths must be clarified, one should ascend by degrees and receive the governing registers.

Registers give rise to Daoist followers, who must offer tribute. Those who fail to send tribute may not receive the governing registers. Though tribute may be lacking, this does not hinder the reception of scriptures. Those who receive scriptures wear distinct robes, and their practices follow separate divisions. Though divisions differ and robes vary, they are akin to yin and yang—officials all serve one lord, just as scholars all follow one Dao.

Painted and embroidered colors, whether in motion or still, each have their rank. All bear meaning and intent, as explained in various texts. It is difficult to recall them all, but one should know their general principles.

The *mian* (crown) means "to strive"—to strive in establishing virtue and escape the dust of calamity. The *guan* (cap) means "to observe"—virtue so fine it may be observed, drawing the gaze of all things. The *jin* (scarf) means "purity"—gathered and bound in purity, it connects with the divine luminaries. The *mao* (hat) means "to cover"—shrouding body and head like clouds and mist. Some imitate mountains and forests; others model the sun and moon. Their shapes—square or round, large or small—follow rank and form.

Dragon robes and embroidered garments befit those of illustrious virtue. The unlined robe may be worn universally; originally, it was the *shenyi* (deep robe). Wearing this deep robe, one studies to rectify the heart. When the heart grasps profound principles, one ultimately enters the ancestral source. Later generations simplified it, removing the lower hem for ease, yet the unlined robe remains permissible. Thus, I grant the unlined robe, which, as the inner layer of official robes, is still called the *zhongdan* (inner garment).

The *he* (coarse robe) means "to restrain"—restraining evil and exalting good. The *pi* (cloak) means "to spread"—spreading the Dao’s transformation to all things. The *qun* (skirt) means "to return"—the return of all blessings. It is also called the *shang* (lower garment), and *shang* means "constancy"—lest one lose the Dao, one must constantly abide in constancy.

Women’s *guā* and *jū* robes continue the true lineage, warding off all evils, their meaning akin to the *he* robe. All garments derive their explanations from these principles.

As for distant borderlands and remote regions—among the Man, Yi, Rong, and Di—some wear robes lengthwise, others crosswise, with various painted and embroidered designs. Those who revere the Dao and serve the gods also have ritual vestments. Customs vary widely, and caps and hats differ even more—some flat, some pointed, some tall, some low, some resembling birds and beasts, others like insects and fish. Though their modifications may seem haphazard, their adornments remain discernible.

Kneeling, bowing, and yielding gestures often differ, as do the ways of clasping hands and holding *hu* tablets, each following local custom. Yet before the Three Sovereigns, hands were clasped in reverence; after the Five Emperors, *hu* tablets were held to express respect.

What is the *hu*? It means "sudden" and "do not." In the age of the Yellow Emperor, it was made of bamboo—two feet and four inches long, three inches wide, and three *fen* thick—adorned with ivory and tipped with fish whiskers. Held in hand, with a brush inserted at the top, when the lord issued commands, one feared forgetting them. Thus, they were written down to prevent omission, ensuring compliance and execution. Records were kept on bamboo slips, and once matters were concluded, the *hu* was wiped clean, ready for the next use. In the Three Dynasties, affairs multiplied, and fine bamboo became scarce, so other materials were used instead.

The Son of Heaven’s jade *hu* differed slightly in design—sometimes three feet long, or two feet and six inches—while width and thickness remained five *fen*. The brush was inserted into the *hu*, which was tucked under the arm. In the early Han, meritorious ministers, competing in merit and debate, would hastily draw their *hu* to strike one another. Emperor Gaozu had Shu Sun Tong establish rites to eliminate this abuse, reducing the *hu* to a uniform size—one foot and two inches long, one inch and six *fen* wide, and three *fen* thick—preserving its function for recording commands while preventing further misuse. Thus, all scholars, both within and beyond the court, held them in reverence. I, the Humble Dao Lord, bestow this instruction to record one’s cultivation and ensure no negligence or presumption.

When listening to lectures, each holds a scripture scroll, and a tablet should also be kept at hand, never set aside. Those who hold scripture scrolls must wrap them in a clean cloth to avoid exposure, unfolding them with the cloth as a lining to shield against dust and grime.

What are *lü* (shoes)? They mean "principle"—without propriety, one does not move; without principle, one does not act. Acting in accord with good principle, one follows propriety alone. Following propriety to attain principle, one enters the Dao and achieves perfection.

What are *xi* (ceremonial shoes)? They mean "to release"—freeing one from stagnant tracks. Reflecting on this, one may resolve all doubts.

Adorning the Seven Luminaries, cultivating the Six Penetrations—with prolonged practice, verification arises. *Qi* crowns the body’s form, and a halo of radiant color, wondrous and natural, appears. When the crown and robes are complete, *qi* connects with heaven. The layered boards of shoes and all adornments are entirely formed of *qi*, responding to resonance and becoming fully manifest.

There are methods for carving boards, with minor variations in their numerology. These ritual arts, when practiced with goodness, do not burden the Dao.

All who receive scriptures and hold office wear scarves and unlined robes, as well as cloth skirts and coarse robes. Those dwelling in mountains and leaving the household wear deer-skin scarves and coarse robes, joining the company of deer so as not to startle wild creatures.

Virtuous scholars can transform others. When hunters enter the mountains and encounter such virtue, they offer their spoils. The finest spoils are deer skins, which, when offered, enhance virtue. Sincere reverence draws them forth; one must not oppose their intent to ensure their return. Gradually enlightening them, one may clothe them to comfort their hearts—never using such gifts frivolously.

Those who shear their hair, bare their shoulders, and let their hair flow freely may also consort with dragons and serpents. Why must they only keep company with deer and roebucks? Yet hunters often wear deer skins to avoid startling beasts. Though their intent diverges from the Dao, when moved to awakening and recognizing the Dao’s loftiness, they remove their garments to express devotion. Thus, one should first decline, showing humility, and subtly explain the Dao’s principles. One must not accept offerings recklessly; when accepting, one wears them only to cultivate goodness, making them a field of blessing and rewarding their sincere intent. Without such purpose, one need not wear animal skins.

Instead, one may wear a coarse scarf, dyed in dark or yellow hues, avoiding bright, dazzling colors that might cause premature graying. To preserve its luster without fading, it is dyed with cassia juice, fragrant and easily distinguishable.

The yellow robe brings primal auspiciousness, fundamentally permissible for all. The various scriptures and methods employ proper colors in tandem. Each hue serves its specific purpose; if the purpose is not singular, the proper manifestation cannot emerge. Thus, when dyeing with cassia and yellow, one does not hinder refinement or single-minded devotion. Though not yet worn, it deepens one’s reverent diligence, penetrating profoundly into the divine palace. Above, it transforms qi into wondrous garments; next, it unbinds coarse cloth to don crimson silk.

Whenever ascending to heaven or entering grottoes, receiving rank in the Three Clarities, roaming beyond the Three Realms, or transforming within them, one must display distinction at the moment of subduing sharpness: brocade capes take flight in azure, cloud-light embroidery glows, precious jewels adorn pendants, and myriad adornments grace the form. When the time comes to harmonize brilliance and show unity, one wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade, girds a rope and plays the zither. Unity contains distinction, distinction does not harm unity, unity does not burden distinction—this is the true person.

For women cultivating registers or first receiving scriptures, skirts of yellow cassia silk differ not from men’s. Twisted silk or coarse cloth, raw or processed, follows the season. When receiving scriptural methods, all may wear capes, whether dark or yellow, single or layered, cloth or silk, suited to the person. Skirts, coarse garments, and sashes are single-layered only; capes and hempen strips each follow their own rules. Yet they adapt to the wearer’s height and size, avoiding rigid adherence to form, for the method serves the average person. As for the number of strips, there is no difference at all.

When men and women assume official ranks, they may not wear capes when submitting memorials. When inaugurating fasts or attaining the Dao, they also may not wear capes. When reciting scriptures or listening to lectures, capes are permissible for all. Women holding tablets observe the same rites as men, not standing upright but practicing worldly kneeling and bowing. They remove floral hairpins, eschewing pearls, jade, gold, silver, and all precious ornaments. Instead, they use hairpins of mugwort, bamboo, or iron, plain and few, ever mindful of the profound and utmost. Frugality resides in the heart, possessing without attachment.

They may not coil high buns or adorn their heads, nor wear long sashes or gaudy trimmings. All should wear short sashes and tight clothing, small side-buns lowered, drawn down and hanging straight, not askew, with hair slightly parted at the temples. Fragrant oils may be used, but not excessively greasy. Swiftly abandon adornment, maintain upright conduct, and embody solemn dignity, emulating the cloud-like coils of immortal maidens and the fragrant purity of jade perfected ones. They may not wear turbans or crowns, nor apply powder or rouge.

In mountain forests, they wear coarse cloth, deer skins, or rough hemp, grass sandals or layered shoes, the same as men. In cold weather, they may wear hats, gaiters, or common shoes. When praying, they remove their hats and do not bind their hair with scarves. For official duties, learning, Daoist practice, or worldly affairs, blue-green sashes and plain essentials, red or purple skirts are used. Those of exalted rank and virtue may wear purple and plain together, red, crimson, pale green, or light blue without restriction. Patterns should scatter flowers or nine-step motifs, never figures of immortals or beasts. Brocade, damask, embroidery, tie-dye, woven designs, carved or engraved thin fabrics are all forbidden.

Ritual garments follow the regulations. Divine youths and attendants who do not adhere to the method will be harmed by spirits instead. When paying court, reciting scriptures, observing fasts, praying, inquiring of teachers, or greeting masters, one may wear them. When visiting the court, attending funerals, inquiring after the sick, strolling in gardens, or traversing filthy places, roads, or paths, one may not wear them. Those dwelling in mountains and leaving the household wear them for life; when briefly entering the world of men, they need not change. They are not hindered by defilement or delay, nor do they shun hardship or toil. When worn out, they are renewed; when mended, they remain pure.

Those of shared learning and aspiration may also provide for one another. If one intentionally makes new garments to offer to teachers, friends, or fellow disciples of the Dao, gifts and requests follow the occasion, first requiring announcement. Announce to the Three Treasures, stating the full circumstances: “This person presently lacks, and I request to aid their need.” Divine youths will grant and bestow, clearly distinguishing the hidden and manifest. Only then may such profound and layered garments be given.

The recipient honors the Dao, announces their receipt of the gift, then wears it, bearing gratitude in their heart. They may not boast or delight in its rarity. “That person does not match their attire”—wearing it, they tremble as if standing over a deep abyss. Though the method allows coarse cloth, one should not value wealth lightly or treat it carelessly. Do not covet fine smoothness or luxurious adornment; violating the method brings calamity. All should be reverent and cautious.

Skirt, jacket, and shirt styles are familiar to all; the forms of coarse capes and strips are rarely mastered in the world. This record explains them in detail, and one should also consult enlightened teachers.

**Chapter Nine: Selecting a Teacher**
To choose a teacher, contemplate the natural. The principle of the natural encompasses yin and yang. Yang is noble, yin is humble, their dynamics complete one another. In completion, there is no nobility or humility, only equality in the primal unity. Once primal qi disperses, seeking harmony remains unfulfilled. Men are honored, women are humble, fundamentally due to modesty and yielding. If one diligently practices modesty and yielding, even a woman may become noble. Without diligence in modesty and yielding, even a man may become humble. If the humble are diligent, their elevation comes through yielding.

Guiding beings back to their origin, the origin’s master is most noble. Nobility is honor, and honor resides in the Dao. Thus, among people, there is no nobility or humility; where the Dao is, there is honor. Honoring the Dao and valuing virtue necessarily exalts the person. If that person embodies the Dao, containing profound and pure virtue, though a woman, even a man may take her as teacher. Fathers teach their sons, rulers teach their ministers, masters teach slaves, servants, young attendants, guests, and barbarians. Where the Dao resides, where karmic conditions converge, though high and low differ, all should take them as teachers. Do not, because of lowly station, abandon their Dao; one cannot, by occupying a noble position, become arrogant and lose virtue.

People often cling to nobility, despising the humble and coarse. The Dao shatters this delusion, often manifesting in the lowly and unrefined. Some come from distant lands, their forms coarse and ugly, their speech mistaken, their conduct damaging to the true scriptures, wild and unrestrained, filthy and inconstant. They move and inspire the stagnant; the enlightened awaken to them, the benighted doubt and fall into chaos. Those who see them become drunk and confused. Drunkenness and confusion are not real; the doubt and chaos they cause are fundamentally mundane. Mundane customs drift and wander, moving ever farther from the source. Those who study the Dao reverse this, knowing the constant is called enlightenment.

**Chapter Ten: The Master’s Transmission**

To be a master, one must guard the mysterious One with utmost precision. The One is the origin of the myriad things—there must be no leakage.

Do not turn away any who come seeking. Bestow the Dao according to their capacity, discern their aspirations, nurture their karmic conditions, dispel their stagnations, unfold their talents, reveal their virtue, and assess their merits. Let there be no error in distinguishing ability from inability, so that humans and spirits may harmonize.

Abide always in humility and restraint; do not display even the slightest hint of arrogance or boasting. Protect all beings and never plant the roots of resentment. Sever the source of evil and cultivate the wellspring of goodness.

Be cautious not to speak idly. Let your words be grounded in scripture and precepts. Expound and clarify the Dharma, making the hidden and the manifest flow as one. Let neither self nor other remain in confusion; let doubt and suspicion be forever forgotten. Once the dust of affliction is swept away, the spirits will come and go. All vows will renew daily, and all things will be fulfilled.

Those who aspire to walk this path must preserve the *Five Thousand Characters*. Though its text is but five thousand words, its meaning crowns all without end. Passed down through generations, the succession of masters and disciples is beyond reckoning.

What is followed today are the *Ten Great Characters of Heaven*. Immortals, humans, spirits, and ghosts alike all return to this same origin. Their text and numerical structure are identical, without a single divergence.

Yet those who are moved differ in degree, and those who respond undergo subtle transformations. The *Heshang’s Chapter and Verse* and the *Xiang’er Commentary* adapt the characters to their time, establishing titles and framing discussions. Though they begin differently, they end the same—following causes to their fruition. A master of profound clarity should carefully proclaim their teachings.

The *Great Characters* enter the Dao through numbers, thus they first speak of "five thousand" and then call it a "scripture." The *Xiang’er* unifies Dao and number, so it first calls it a "scripture" and then speaks of "five thousand." The *Heshang* interweaves Dao and number, dividing the scripture into sections, arranging chapters into ordered verses—each with its proper correspondence.

Those of subtle insight, strive for resonance in your study. Do not confuse the means with the end.

The *Five Thousand Characters* encompasses all and is complete in itself. It is the ancestor of all scriptures, the branches and limbs of the Three Caverns. Though they first divide, they later unite, ultimately returning to the Dao and its virtue—reaching the ultimate source.

Human lives take many forms, with great stages divided into three ranks. From small to middle, from middle to great, and from great to the supreme. Those of middle and small capacity bring peace to what they aid. Talent and wisdom vary in magnitude, but the truly great are always few.

Thus, the sages of old first introduced the minor teachings of the Three Sovereigns. They first perfected themselves before turning to others—for others are great, not small. The beginning of small talent lies in cultivating the self. Through self-cultivation, one enters the middle; from the middle, one ascends to the great. Hence, the Three Caverns: Cavern of Spirits, Cavern of Mystery, and Cavern of Truth.

One who masters the Three Caverns may be called great. One who masters only one or two stands between them—a minor master at best. Do not boast emptily, claiming, "I am great." Those who are truly great are not always needed in their time. Observing the needs of the age, they may teach through minor methods.

The minor and middle teachings urgently transform beings. Most beings possess only small understanding. One cannot offer a grand feast to an infant—a compassionate mother would not impose such a burden. To feed milk to the strong is not the way of a sagely master.

The root of the Three Caverns lies in the Three Thousand. The techniques of the Three Caverns branch into the immeasurable. Within the Central Kingdom and among the Four Barbarians, they are expounded everywhere. Though their source and intent remain unchanged, their outward traces differ. Spirits, humans, and other beings each have their own scripts—some simple, some complex; some brief, some extensive; some with shared sounds but differing meanings, others with differing sounds but shared meanings. Some flourish, some fade; some are substantial, some are empty.

A master must examine these with precision and respond according to what moves each seeker. To those of utmost sincerity who are ready, transmit the oral instructions in full. To those whose karmic conditions have not yet ripened, offer but a drop. Do not recklessly reveal teachings to the unworthy, nor stubbornly withhold them from the deserving. Open or close transmission based on resonance—when resonance is certain, then transmission may proceed. If doubt arises, halt immediately. When direct speech is unwise, employ skillful means to delay. Follow the master’s instructions without being swayed by personal sentiment, lest disaster arise.

Those who pursue higher learning value the Dao over wealth. The vulgar value wealth over the Dao. To burden oneself with excess is to invite great loss.

Thus, sagely masters practice the Dao and disperse their possessions. Wealth departs, and the Dao descends. Accumulating virtue ensures lasting presence. Lasting presence means no further waiting—what is not needed is not sought. If one possesses, it is to benefit others. To be as rich as the Four Seas is to remain free of burdens. The enlightened understand this and are not attached to wealth.

Yet before true attainment, one is not yet free of dependence. Clothing, food, and ritual implements are necessary. One should exert effort, employing Heaven’s way, utilizing Earth’s bounty, and following the master’s methods. Take only what is lawful, seek only through rightful means, and use only what accords with the Dao—this is the way of those who pursue higher learning.

Before attaining the Dao, one must still provide for clothing and food. Clothing and food cannot themselves lead to the Dao. One should slightly reduce their pursuit to support the Dharma. Endure hunger and cold for a time—this is but temporary suffering. Through the Dharma, one attains the Dao and forever preserves eternal joy.

From past kalpas to future kalpas, the countless sages all relied on this path to perfect their supreme virtue.

Moreover, renouncing wealth is but one source. Its application involves three considerations: first, what the spirit officials require; second, using things to illustrate principles; and third, eliminating form to dissolve misfortune. These three considerations must not be altered, diminished, or omitted.

If a disciple is poor and cannot provide all at once, yet their conduct surpasses the multitude, the master should petition on their behalf, allowing them to make up the deficiency later without fear of transgression. If one has taken refuge within the gate, entrusting their life to the master, and possesses no private wealth, the master should provide on their behalf.

If a divine master descends in great majesty, adjust deficiencies as circumstances allow. Follow the ways of an ordinary master—do not alter them at will. Be cautious not to privately exempt anyone, claiming it as your own kindness, nor should you increase demands to extort wealth from others.

What the spirit officials require, if not clearly justified, cannot dissolve misfortune and may instead lead to karmic entanglements. This may cause others to lose the Dao—exercise utmost caution.

Those who pursue higher learning do not recklessly assume the role of master. Unless one is a true sage, complete in Dao and virtue, one must not instruct even a single person or presumptuously occupy the master’s seat.

In this degenerate age, the Dao is hidden, and true sages withdraw into concealment. The people of the final era are coarse and cannot summon them. Yet among them are those of middle capacity and above who aspire to higher learning. If they obtain sacred scriptures and diagrams, though they may not yet fully comprehend them, one should encourage and support them. The enlightened teach those who come after, passing down the succession of masters and disciples.

Every foot has its shortcoming, every inch its strength—why should the foot’s shortcoming reject the inch’s strength, or the inch’s strength presume to scorn the foot’s shortcoming? All who have not yet attained perfect wholeness must possess some particular strength. Those who come later may seek instruction from those who came before, and all should alternate as teachers and friends.

If you measure yourself and find not a single point of superiority over another, yet that person seeks you out, firmly decline. If words leave you no choice, then teach and guide them as they require, but do not covet their wealth or resources, nor keep them idly for your own glory. Do not boast of having them, only to lose them in the end, for such mutual deception turns blessings into misfortune.

All great masters must embrace all who come, accepting none who arrive, nor pursuing any who depart. They must be without bias or faction, upholding impartiality and setting aside personal interests. They reward the good and punish the wicked, neither overreaching nor neglecting. Toward the families of those who come and go, they show no favoritism or partiality. They speak cautiously and little, avoiding mockery or ridicule. When met with ugliness, they respond with beauty. They take the mean between extravagance and austerity, adjusting as circumstances require.

Disciples vary in nature—do not confuse them in testing. Some are wholeheartedly devoted to the Dao, others seek glory or profit, still others merely pursue clothing and food. Some are compelled by circumstances, others feign interest to stir dissent. Such types must be distinguished: restrained or guided, guarded or placed, so they do not bring disaster.

If emperors, generals, ministers, or violent tyrants, relying on force and intimidation, coerce one into teaching, respond with expedient means—explain, resolve, decline, or avoid them, so as not to invite harm. Prepare for adversity with proper methods, and carefully follow them.

For the master, adherence to principle is like that of a father or elder brother; for the disciple, the proper attitude is like that of a younger brother or child. Fortune and misfortune are shared—neither may betray the other.

To follow a master is to unite; to turn away is to part. When parting, do not utter resentful words; when united, do not flatter excessively. Bestow or withhold as is fitting, maintaining balance in both hidden and manifest matters, without exaggeration. If merit and fault deviate from truth, and false flattery or slander arise, following one’s own inclinations against the Dao, both master and disciple will bring grave disaster upon themselves.

Men and women must not be privately instructed; superiors and inferiors must not be mixed. Their dwellings differ, their practices diverge—each must follow the regulations and canons. Any lapse invites investigation and punishment.

When someone seeks to join, examine their origins. They must not be apostates or deviants, nor bear false oaths. Only with the guarantee of a trusted acquaintance may they be accepted. Do not act carelessly or in ignorance. If there is doubt, investigate until the truth is clear. Those who are deceitful should be gently admonished and sent away.

Some, after long service, seek advancement to new ranks. If it is not yet appropriate to grant it, or if there is nothing to grant, and they grow discontented and wish to leave, let them depart in due course. Do not restrain or detain them, lest you harm harmony, damage the Dao, and corrupt virtue, misleading others and losing the truth.

If someone falsely wishes to leave, gently persuade them to stay. If they cannot be stopped, do not forcefully detain them. Their karmic affinity is shallow, and their merit cannot run deep. Do not harbor resentment or anger—let the Dharma remain with them. Such hidden virtue will lead to the attainment of the highest truth.

In all active circumstances, if one’s commitment to stillness is not firm, even if one studies to reduce desires, one cannot be without self-interest. Self-interest gives rise to faults, and faults vary in severity. When the master recognizes his own faults, he should repent before the Three Treasures, perform rites of confession to purify the heart, and vow never to repeat them.

When disciples err, punish them according to the offense—by words, by the rod, by rites, or by confinement. The duration and severity should follow the canons of the Perfected. Punish laziness to spur reform, subdue body and mind, and lead them to reflect on goodness. Do not act out of anger or resentment. If you vent your anger by punishing, the master will instead incur misfortune.

If a disciple does not recognize their own faults or deliberately commits them, examine the severity of the offense. If it can be forgiven, reiterate the warnings and admonitions. If it cannot be overlooked, administer discipline. Breaches of etiquette, laziness, mistakes, or forgetfulness are minor transgressions and do not warrant severe reprimand.

Deceit, licentiousness, and theft are grave offenses—punish them severely to eradicate the roots of evil. If the punished bear no grudge and later reform, once their penance is complete and they wish to resume their duties, or if they have fled in shame but later return, confused, to the gate, accept them again and renew your virtuous guidance.

If they repeat the offense, punish them again, but do not exceed three times. After the third offense, the master may no longer tolerate them. Banish them to distant lands, and do not record or acknowledge them further. Those who are violent and rebellious should be publicly disciplined by the law to gradually prevent the sprouting of greater evil.

If the wicked cannot be transformed, even the sages cannot fathom them. One must guard against them internally and externally, using methods to control them so they do not act out, bringing disgrace to the Dao and defaming the gods.

All who can reform, even from grave faults, may be pardoned. Those who cannot change, even for minor offenses, should not be indulged. Deceit, licentiousness, and theft, once corrected, can lead to goodness. Accumulated goodness becomes truth—thus one repeatedly purifies oneself.

Washing away the deceit once shown to one’s teacher, Cai Jing’s desire for the divine maiden, Longwei’s theft of the Xia Yu’s sacred texts, and Dongfang Shuo’s pilfering of the Queen Mother’s peaches—none of these hindered their attainment of the Dao, for all were able to reform.

All great masters must guard against the beginnings of disciples’ deviance. If it cannot be suppressed, let it run its course and then discipline them. Allow them a proper end, for there is a limit to three offenses. Sternly admonish their conduct, and do not let others presume upon this leniency. Once the precedent is set, a second or third offense will be difficult to expect.

The master embraces the One, yet his traces manifest in three forms. These three traces adapt to the world, and the world differs in many ways, but broadly, they fall into three ranks: the first is *movement and stillness*, the second is *stillness of heart*, and the third is *true stillness*.

*Movement and stillness* involves establishing halls and institutions, transcribing scriptures and diagrams, clarifying essential teachings, and propagating the profound Dao. Those who come are instructed, encouraged without coercion; those who leave are admonished, guided without restraint. Those who retreat are drawn forward at times, those who advance are restrained at times—restraint and guidance are balanced to return movement to stillness. The reversal of movement is the activation of the Dao, entering the root of stillness. Those who steadfastly uphold this benefit others and themselves, yet few truly understand it—how can it be used to enlighten the masses?

The *stillness of heart* is marked by inner fullness of virtue and power, with conduct and methods spreading far and wide. Traversing the world and crossing mountains, immortals gather in communion, delivering and liberating sentient beings. Though dwelling in mortal forms among the common folk, they move through markets and courts, holding minor offices yet easily resigning. Their subtle transformations work upon the willing; those who encounter them are stirred to action, while those who meet them respond to their influence with reverence. Secretly receiving wondrous methods, they accomplish their work and withdraw, now appearing, now concealed—few can fathom them, how then can they be used to mold the masses?

*True stillness* involves cherishing the body and preserving the spirit, neither stagnating nor sinking. Holding to the law and maintaining the center, they remain unyielding yet unbroken. Rectifying the world and rescuing the age, they act with solemnity and merit: where aid is possible, they aid; where it is not, they depart, journeying to joyful lands to assist all regions. Counting the days and seizing the hour, they falter neither in duty nor in succession. Traversing the four directions, from the Lord Emperor down to the myriad people, they teach and enlighten without rest or respite, their work continuing until the turning of the heavens is complete. Yet none know them—how can they be likened to the hub of a thirty-spoked wheel?

To expand these three *wu* (non-beings) is to perfect the one wondrous *you* (being). Herein lies the teacher of those who pursue the highest learning.

*The Wondrous Writ of the Supreme Cavern of the Great Empyrean, Vol. 4* concludes.
*The Wondrous Writ of the Supreme Cavern of the Great Empyrean, Vol. 5*
**Chapter Ten: The Transmission of Scriptures and the Master-Disciple Conduct**

All who obtain scriptures, once secured, must transcribe them anew. The first copy shall serve as the *zhen* (permanent repository), for veneration alone. For the present transcription and refinement, meticulous collation is required. Those with ample wealth and strength shall each prepare three copies: one for permanent preservation, one for ritual offerings, and one for study. The study copy shall always remain in the disciple’s own chamber, placed upon a separate stand. The disciple alone shall handle its removal and return, never entrusting it to others. If household members or disciples share the same *qi* and sincere devotion, they may be permitted to assist—but never fully delegated. Negligence, shallow understanding, or imprecise interpretation may violate prohibitions, bringing misfortune to both parties. Thus, caution and reverence are essential to invite fortune and avert calamity.

When transcribing scriptures, one must observe a pure fast. The proper method is to copy by hand and exchange texts with one’s master. If occupied with menial duties at the gate or overwhelmed by other tasks, or if unskilled in calligraphy, the wealthy may hire scribes with gold or silk, while the poor may employ laborers, pooling resources. However, only exemplary copies may be borrowed—never settle for careless work. Errors in text or distortions in illustrations incur penalties, and blessings will not accrue.

If a scripture contains illustrations, these may be bound separately, each with its attendant officials: the *Dian Tu Zhen Li* (True Scribe of Diagrams), jade boys, and jade maidens, whose status aligns with that of the scripture. One must not evade difficulty by omitting illustrations while transcribing the text. If an illustration is marred, it may be washed and corrected—no more than three corrections per sheet, whether of paper or silk. Exceeding three corrections requires replacement, and the flawed sheet must be purified by fire. Trim and align the edges, attach the scroll head and ribbon, and wrap it in a cloth or case. The container should be sturdy and clean, without excessive ornamentation.

Worldly teachings transform the world by forsaking embellishment. If embellishment cannot yet be abandoned, it may be provisionally employed to guide worldly people away from extravagance. Through offering refined adornments to the Dao, they gradually recognize simplicity. Once simplicity is attained, embellishment naturally fades, neither sought nor imposed, arising spontaneously. None can compel otherwise—this is the fruit of simplicity. Do not cling to worldly ornamentation.

For altars, traveling cases, and other furnishings, adjust according to means. Wealth and poverty should correspond proportionally; neither should force extremes. The wealthy must not feign austerity, nor the poor feign opulence. Excessive luxury or stingy frugality both deviate from Daoist regulations. Daoist regulations value moderation, harmonizing inner and outer.

For unintentional errors or omissions in the headings, one must acknowledge faults, perform a pure fast, and repent according to the *Tai Zhen* (Supreme Perfection) statutes. For long-damaged or altered texts, follow the *Tai Zhen* methods.

Incense, lamps, and prostrations must be offered with utmost precision. Precision leads to sagehood, uniting with the Dao in truth.

**Chapter Twelve: The Petition Ritual**
When disciples, through karmic affinity, rely on their master to request teachings, those deemed worthy of transmission shall first transcribe the scriptures and diagrams. Upon completion, select an auspicious day to hold a fast, during which the petition is presented. Though fasting methods vary, all adhere to the Three Primordials. The *Three Primordial Fast Statutes* encompass all methods. For transmitting supreme scriptures, the *Upper Primordial* is used. The content of the petition may adapt to circumstances, adjusting as needed—keep it concise, avoiding redundancy.

For all fasts and petitions, first prepare a formal document. Do not compose it carelessly or hastily. The proper format begins with the reign title, year, month, day, and hour, followed by the disciple’s state, commandery, county, village, rank, and name (for men, women, officials, libationers, Daoist masters, perfected persons, *Yuan Jun*, or *Fu Ren*). Then specify the location (state, commandery, county, village, mountain abode, temple, or residence) where the disciple seeks the *Great Cavern True Scripture* from a Daoist master (male or female) of a given name. List the scriptures as follows:

*The Supreme Cavern, Perfected Section, Volume X* (enumerate in order).
For those who have received the complete canon, note the sequence. For partial transmissions, list only the relevant titles without volume numbers, specifying the number of scrolls or chapters as appropriate.

*Right: X volumes. Now, during this fast, I humbly petition for their transmission.*

[Disciple’s name and address] states: By fortunate karmic affinity, I have annually revered the Mysterious Ultimate and received the treasure texts. Though my life is fleeting, my aspiration is for longevity. Greedy for advancement and heedless of retreat, I have encountered this auspicious moment. I beseech the transmission of the aforementioned X volumes, offering the prescribed ritual gifts (list X types of *fa xin*). I present this petition, hoping my master will deign to grant permission. I vow to cultivate diligently, never betraying the master’s Way. Should I violate this oath, I accept the punishment of wind and blade, bearing no resentment, in accordance with the clear statutes.

Respectfully submitted on [year, month, day, hour] at [mountain abode].

**Chapter Thirteen: The Transmission of Taboo Names**
When transmitting sacred scriptures, one must honor the master’s lineage. Record the names, ranks, and years of the master, the master’s master, and the master’s master’s master—three generations—along with their genders, residences, and the locations of transmission. Also note the disciples receiving the texts. Inscribe this on yellow silk and wear it always, never losing it. Loss incurs penalties as per the *Tai Zhen* statutes. If not worn constantly, store it with the scriptures, wrapped separately in a cloth.

Honor the master, the master’s master, and the *Xuan Shi* (Mysterious Master), as well as the *Qing Tong Da Jun* (Great Lord of Azure Youth) and the *Xiao Jun* (Lesser Lord). Venerate these two lords with proper rites.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Ritual Gifts**
The statutes for ritual gifts differ from those for scriptures. Each master’s oral instructions carry karmic conditions. As times and statutes evolve, variations arise. Resolve doubts by following the master’s guidance. Without a master, petition the Mysterious One according to protocol and present gifts as prescribed—never deviate.

Each volume and statute is transmitted separately. Scriptures and statutes are interdependent; master and disciple must gauge accordingly. Though some gifts may seem trivial or weighty, easy or difficult, one must consider the proper form, aligning with the method to fulfill karmic conditions.

For those receiving transmissions at once, the required gifts are as follows:
1. Nine *liang* of fine gold;

**2.** One hundred twenty *chi* of purple brocade;
**3.** Forty *chi* each of five-colored patterned silks;
**4.** One thousand two hundred *chi* of white plain silk;
**5.** Twenty-four *zhang* of purple-patterned silk;
**6.** Life-span banners with cyclical stems and branches interwoven, patterned silks matching the recipient’s age (measured in *pi*, *zhang*, and *chi*);
**7.** Three *jin* each of five-colored threads;
**8.** Nine *jin* each of five varieties of incense;
**9.** Three jade dragons and three jade fish;
**10.** Five gold dragons and five gold fish;
**11.** One jade wild goose and one jade ram;
**12.** One gold wild goose and one gold ram;
**13.** Three jade tablets;
**14.** Nine pairs each of gold rings and silver bracelets;
**15.** Three hundred sixty pearls, each the size of a *wuzi* seed;
**16.** Five-colored silk floss, each color in the prescribed weight for its direction;
**17.** Three hundred sixty sheets of large-format paper;
**18.** Five pairs of brushes;
**19.** Five dragon-headed writing knives;
**20.** One purple canopy with red wrapping, accompanied by three sets of vermilion-dyed headpieces with gold and silver fittings;
**21.** Five blue-green canopies with jade-green wrapping, accompanied by three sets of black-lacquered headpieces with ivory and bronze fittings;
**22.** One bright mirror, no less than one *chi* in diameter (never smaller than nine *cun*);
**23.** One set of ritual vestments, cap, shoes, and *ban* tablet—moderate in quality, newly made, clean, fragrant, and pure;
**24.** One pure jar and one tray, made of gold, silver, bronze, pottery, or layered lacquer as circumstances permit.

The above twenty-four items constitute the ritual gifts for receiving scriptures and statutes. Each of these twenty-four objects serves a specific purpose; gather and prepare them diligently, leaving none incomplete. In remote regions, substitutes of comparable value may be used, provided they do not deviate from the intended purpose. If any item is truly unavailable, note its absence and make it up after receiving the transmission. From the outset of the purification fast and the submission of the petition, these gifts should be prepared. Consult the master, record what is available and what is lacking, and affix this list to the end of the scripture catalog, preceding the petition text. Read it aloud at the beginning of the petition and again when presenting the official memorial during the transmission of the scriptures. Take care not to overlook this.

When the master receives these gifts, they must be used in accordance with the clear statutes, ensuring proper allocation. Thus, both parties safeguard the attainment of perfection. For pacts with the Mysterious One, follow this same method, referring to the dispersal rites outlined in the *Golden Writ*. If the scriptures are not transmitted in full, do not employ this protocol.

Those of lofty aspiration must observe these details with meticulous care.

---

**Chapter Fifteen: The Nine Statutes of the Supreme Perfected**
The Supreme Perfected King of the Great Dao established statutes to complete the various methods, dispersing them throughout the scriptures—sometimes preceding, sometimes following. Readers may not distinguish them, so one should seek the original text. The original text spans three scrolls, kept secret by the master. Those who obtain it study it in private, becoming teachers of heaven and humanity.

Here, the essentials are summarized in nine statutes, universally observed by the Perfected of the Nine Heavens. To neglect them in teaching or practice is to invite fault. When worthy and wise seekers request the precious scriptures, present them with these key precepts and the proper procedures for transmission. Delight in these nine principles, and by extension, all matters will be addressed. Without embodying the true Dao, do not arbitrarily add or omit anything. All scriptures of the Three Caverns follow this standard.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of Western Citadel, the Immortal Lords, Ministers, and Sages—all men of great talent—treasure and guard these statutes. Take care not to leak them.

**First Statute:** Upon completing the fast, administer the precepts. After receiving the precepts, transmit the scriptures according to the rites. The year of transmission marks the beginning of the term. The term restrains the mind; the term reveals the Dao. The Dao is the master of all wonders; to observe wonders, one must perceive their source.

Eliminating desire is paramount; reducing desire is secondary. Depth and shallowness follow one’s capacity; excellence and inferiority depend on virtue. The measure of virtue is boundless, but its major divisions are six:
1. Four myriad kalpas;
2. Four myriad years;
3. Four thousand years;
4. Four hundred years;
5. Forty years;
6. Precisely four cycles.

Upon completing the term, one may transmit to a single person. After nine transmissions, the honor of the Dao and the nobility of virtue are manifest. In times of urgency, with great compassion and broad salvation, transmit to the worthy without rigidly adhering to the number. However, the initial reception should be modest, with verification sought during the term.

If, within the term, one encounters peril or is threatened by misfortune, and wisdom and strength cannot resolve it, one must avoid calamity. The essence of what has been received resides in the heart, not bound to scrolls, lest it harm the Mysterious Perfected. If coerced by power and forced to compromise, yet one judges that later one can overcome the oppressor and preserve the original aspiration, one may temporarily comply with their demands. If unable to do so, sever ties with death, but never kill or humiliate the original master or abandon the true Dao.

If one’s wisdom and strength are insufficient, do not rashly claim the ability to overcome them. To overestimate virtue and overreach one’s power is to destroy one’s life without success, merely increasing sin. One should reflect carefully.

If the scriptures are lost unexpectedly, whether through theft, bandits, or uncertain survival, one must undertake a prolonged fast, repent, and offer one’s life and wealth. Relying on the master for years, exhaust all sincerity, harboring no resentment or complaint. Only then may one receive them anew. After three losses, do not receive them carelessly. Instead, intensify repentance until spiritual resonance occurs, then receive them again—surely attaining the true Dao. To receive without resonance is futile; the transmission will yield no accomplishment, sowing seeds for the future. Better not to receive than to receive in vain.

Receiving repeatedly alters the heart and spirit. Though initially unsuccessful, one will ultimately attain the Dao.

**Second Statute:** After receiving the scriptures, diligently follow the master’s instructions, concealing one’s brilliance within. Only after completing the term may one transmit to the worthy. The worthy are not easily found; do not recklessly transmit to the unworthy. Such errors harm both parties, extending to ancestors above and descendants below, deepening evil and severing lineages, condemning them to eternal ghostly existence.

Should misfortune strike within the term—be it family bereavement, public or private disputes, bloodshed or imprisonment, fire, flood, theft, or grave illness—though the term may have expired, one must not transmit to others. Instead, one ought to repent of transgressions, diligently accumulate merit, and petition for the appointed time to arrive before any transmission may proceed. If the Three Worthies enjoy longevity and ascend by fate, or if one suffers unjust imprisonment without fault, these pose no obstacle; transmission may proceed as scheduled.

**Third Statute:** One’s faith must be pure, the heart steadfast, illuminating the subtle meaning with clarity. The scriptures must be meticulously prepared, acquired through proper understanding. Distinguish rightful portions, compile and store them in secret, refraining from boastful talk or miserly hoarding. Beware of illicit acquisition—exchanging, begging, or forcibly seizing—stealing what one obtains and claiming it as merit, thereby inviting further blame and misfortune, with no blessing to expect. When the master transmits, use the offerings wisely: divide them into three parts. One portion is for the disciple to sponsor feasts, aiding in the provision of incense, oil, and scriptures; one portion relieves the hardships of those dwelling in secluded mountains; and one portion supplies the master’s robes, coarse or fine, and supports the Three Worthies. No portion may be privately dispersed. Distribution must follow the proper method, without stinginess, nor should one hoard greedily, lest calamity befall, harming the Dao and shaming the teachings, inviting scorn from both humans and spirits. In times of urgency, prioritize aid where needed, using resources as circumstances demand. First invoke the Three Treasures, then calculate replenishment. Violations incur investigation, and theft is judged by law. Those who share the altar with the Numinous Sovereign follow the Twelve Statutes.

**Fourth Statute:** After receiving the scriptures, maintain reverence without lapse. Should illness, unforeseen emergencies, or public or private affairs hinder observance, make amends afterward with repentance, shame, and remorse, purifying the heart’s sincerity. If one wanders in dissipation, pursuing pleasure with arrogance, repeated transgressions will plunge one into Fengdu. One must not persist in such ways.

**Fifth Statute:** One ought to maintain perpetual abstinence; if unable, choose auspicious occasions to express devotion. The year has six months, each month ten auspicious days. If even this is unfeasible, observe the new moon, half-moon, and last day of the month, the four seasons, eight solar terms, and one’s birthdays—practice as one is able, never abandoning it entirely, for abandonment yields no merit. To forsake the Dao and discard the teachings invites misfortune. If one inadvertently breaks abstinence, repent immediately. Repeated violations without remorse lead to falling among demonic hordes. Cultivate without slackening, remain unbroken and unwavering, uphold the Dao and propagate the teachings, harmonizing self and others. Attainment of sagehood is assured, and one shall be named "Mysterious Virtue."

**Months of Perpetual Abstinence:** The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year—six months in total, all odd-numbered, aligning with the flourishing of yang and the establishment of yin’s merit.

**Auspicious Days in a Month:** Ten days per month: the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.

**Sixth Statute:** During abstinence, recite the scriptures and precepts, familiarize and practice them, expound and clarify their meaning. Daily seek profound understanding, and once understood, put it into practice. Do not violate what you have understood; if violated, repent immediately. Do not repeat the transgression. Whether sitting or walking, keep the text in mind, never neglecting or forgetting it. If one conceals knowledge for personal gain, deceiving others, disregarding success or failure, dismissing inquiries, envying the accomplished, using deceptive or evasive speech, or feigning understanding to mislead others—distorting passages, altering chapters, fabricating heterodox interpretations, or fostering heretical views—deviating from truth and transgressing orthodoxy—all invite profound calamity.

**Seventh Statute:** To propagate the scriptures and precepts, establish virtue and merit, and employ expedient means for benefit requires wisdom and skill. Without deep understanding, do not act lightly, lest one stray from the essence of expedient means and fall into false speech. Adhere strictly to the true intent, guiding those of like mind to return together to the master’s gate. Study the scriptures, recite the precepts, verify the subtle principles, and inspire virtuous thoughts. Allow them to participate in abstinence and observe transformation, enabling them to hear and witness blessings. Encourage joyful compliance, harmonizing efforts to achieve success. Do not rebuke or provoke anger, thereby increasing transgressions. Use analogies to guide, never forcibly dragging. Protect with measured care, balancing firmness and gentleness. Grant and withhold as needed, nurturing in various ways. For those stubborn in delusion, show compassion without reluctance, practicing boundless mercy. Never abandon them. Those who gain good spiritual companions vow to ascend together to the Mystery, honoring the master and cherishing resources, thereby attaining the fruit of the Supreme Perfected.

**Eighth Statute:** The master must pity the disciple with an impartial heart, showing no favoritism. Rewards and punishments must be clear: punishment to curb evil, reward to encourage virtue. Not even the slightest detail may be overlooked, nor the most trivial matter misjudged. Misjudgment or bias invites disaster, subjecting one to severe retribution in both the unseen and visible realms.

**Ninth Statute:** The disciple must serve the master with reverence and caution, undivided in devotion, restrained in movement and speech, serene and steadfast. Attend to the master’s countenance, seek subtle instructions, and contemplate how to render service, aiding the Three Treasures. Devote heart and strength, obeying commands without hesitation, undeterred by water or fire, undaunted by distance. If in doubt, seek clarification; if permitted to correct, do so. If not permitted, still comply. Even at the risk of death, do not evade. The master tests the disciple to strengthen resolve, guiding them to enter the Dao and attain the True, distinguishing superior and inferior stages to deepen understanding. Daily, the master assigns tasks, supervising with increasing precision to fulfill the Great Dao. If the master’s spiritual power is weak, they must not recklessly test others. A sagely and enlightened master’s tests incur no harm. Fortune and misfortune, adversity and favor all depend on the enlightened master. If one encounters an unworthy master, the teachings themselves are not flawed; the fault lies with oneself. Even in death, one must not resent it but should reflect on one’s own errors, rectifying past mistakes and cultivating future virtue. If one harbors doubt toward the master, one should not serve them. If serving, comply without defiance, for defiance leads to losing the Dao, forever mired in suffering. Be clear about the beginning, strive to persevere to the end.

These Nine Statutes were proclaimed by the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, and the boundless host of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions all observe and practice them, delivering and guiding all beings.

**Sixteenth: The Method for Dispatching Officials in Rituals of Shared Purpose—Rescuing from Distress, Healing Illness, Atoning for Transgressions, and Invoking Blessings**

Master and disciples observe prolonged fasts without interruption unless necessity arises. When urgent pleas are received, the fast may be temporarily suspended. All comings and goings must adhere to the established regulations.

The dispatch of officials during the Three Primes is a customary practice, employed for matters of high or low status, illness or distress, public or private emergencies. Prepare the altar hall, secure a secluded chamber, or choose a quiet courtyard or natural setting by mountains and waters. Perform the rite at dawn or midnight, adapting to the time and circumstances. The paramount concern is purity—avoid rain, wind, cold, heat, noise, or disturbance. If wind or rain persists, or if the weather turns hot or cold, do not evade these conditions; instead, maintain seclusion and stillness.

Erect a canopy over the altar courtyard, arrange mats at every entrance, set up scripture stands and incense tables, and light candles and lamps in succession. Thirty-two participants shall proceed, reciting incantations as prescribed in the standard method. The dispatch of officials during the Three Primes follows distinct procedures.

The present text establishes the principal method for dispatching officials, as follows:

From the Primordial Chaos Root-Source, the Original Beginning of Heaven above and Earth below, the true officials of the thirty-six thousand myriad directions, districts, townships, and hamlets proceed forth.
The Supreme Direct Purification Hundred Officials and their subordinates, brandishing the divine *Dongyu* jade talismans, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Marchmounts, and the Great Unity, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand cavalry, array their grand regalia and encamp before and behind your servants. The Direct Purification Merit Officers stand at the four directions; the Direct Purification Envoys stand at the center; the Direct Purification Feathered Robe Envoys, the jade maidens and immortal youths, the minor officials in yellow skirts and feathered garments, with hanging tassels and sashes, bearing jade tablets, stand before your servants, receiving the oral commands.

Herein, the true officials of the four directions of this prefecture, commandery, district, township, and hamlet, the qi-registering supervisory envoys, summon the Direct Purification Merit-Recording Generals, the Vanguard Merit-Reporting and Rear Guard Execution Envoys, the Supreme Thirty-Six Division Commandants, the Grand Essence Thirty-Six Division Perfected Lords, the Standard-Bearing Thirty-Six Division Generals, the Standard-Bearing Thirty-Six Division Envoys, the Thirty-Six Division Tiger-Rushing Commandants, the Thirty-Six Division Vanguard and Rear Guard Chief Ministers jointly serving the Six Divisions to subdue rebels, the Thirty-Six Division Rebel-Slaying Executioners, the Thirty-Six Division Spirit-Seizing Generals, the Thirty-Six Division Ghost-Slaying Generals, the Lords of the Eight Poles of the Celestial Sphere, the myriad officials of the countless layers of Heaven above and Earth below, the Heavenly Thearchs Enforcing the Law, the Enforcing Law Heavenly Thearch Officials, the Ten Directions Peace-Bringing Lords, the Ten Directions Joy-Bringing Lords, the Ten Directions Virtue-Encouraging Lords, the Ten Directions Evil-Transforming Lords, the Ten Directions Rebel-Subduing Lords and their officers and soldiers, the Eastern Nine Yi Lords, the Southern Eight Man Lords, the Western Six Rong Lords, the Northern Five Di Lords, the Central Three Qin Lords, the officials of the three hundred sixty celestial contracts of Heaven above and Earth below—your servants’ brandished *Dongyu* jade talismans, the hundred officials, audience envoys, various officials, immortal youths, and jade maidens, bearing jade tablets, transcribe your servants’ petitions, conveying the sincerity of the humble plea to the August Jade Throne before the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Thearch.

The Grand Mystery Capital Orthodox Unity Pacifying Qi Celestial Master, the Great Unity Non-Ultimate Vajra Complete Scroll Three Caverns Dharma Master, the Perfected Person of [such-and-such] Marchmount, the Lady of the Luminous Truth, the [such-and-such] Official Daoist wielding the *Feng Hui Shen Dong* talisman, the Libationer of [such-and-such] Oratory, your servants [so-and-so] and others, prostrate ourselves, bowing our heads to the ground, repeatedly kowtowing, humbly submitting to the Supreme Non-Ultimate Effortless Great Dao, the Supreme Mysterious Heavenly August Thearch, the Mysterious Wondrous Father and Mother, the Jade Dawn Great Dao Supreme Jade Thearch before the August Jade Throne.

Your servants, base and vile as the lowliest vermin, mere remnants of dust, have by some error been born upon this earth, yet are granted the grace to behold its radiance. Sheltered by Heaven above, borne by Earth below, nurtured by the four seasons, grown by the five phases, guarded by the stars, illumined by sun and moon—only now, after a thousand kalpas and one meeting, have we received the primordial qi, been counted among the immortals’ ranks, held fast to truth and grasped the tally, and witnessed the wondrous arts of the Supreme Mystery’s divine transcendents. Yet despite our unworthy forms, we have from youth cherished the Dao of life, dwelling in mountain forests, cutting off grains to ingest elixirs, traversing peaks and valleys, exhaling and inhaling clouds and mist. But our profound thoughts have not yet descended, and we have gained no benefit: the Three Corpses remain unvanquished, the Red Child scattered and disordered, spirit withered and form emaciated, the Eight Paths unopened. We have not attained wisdom and discernment, nor do our meager talents suffice to repay the times or propagate the teachings. Our transgressions are many, our merits few; we have failed the Mysterious Capital, borne arrogance and complacency, and truly deserve ten thousandfold annihilation.

Yet the Great Yang abounds in mercy, nurturing benevolence without malice; the Heavenly Elder cherishes life, vast and boundless in compassion. Reflecting on the past, we seek to redress our faults and have been spared to see this day. Your servants [so-and-so] and others prostrate ourselves, bowing our heads to the ground, repeatedly kowtowing, humbly submitting this plea in repentance.

Your servants [so-and-so] and others, though unworthy to partake of the Great Dharma and tread the path of non-action, now gaze reverently toward the Supreme Sage, the Non-Ultimate Heavenly Worthy. We earnestly pray that the hundred states may know peace, the myriad peoples flourish together, and that from the day we received the Dao, the Three Offices may honor their covenant: to assist in ordering qi, supervise humans and spirits, restrain and summon the ten thousand numina, punish the perverse and suppress the rebellious, establish fields of blessing, and ensure that without the Dao, nothing proceeds, nothing is true, nothing is pure, nothing is accomplished, nothing lives. May we deliver and revive the children of the hundred clans, pacify the state, and bring joy to the people.

Yet your servants [so-and-so] and others, in accordance with the documents, together with the libationers of [such-and-such] prefecture, commandery, county, village, and household—men and women, living and deceased, such as [so-and-so]—have often violated the Dharma and failed to fully embrace the Great Transformation. Having incurred transgressions, they suffer afflictions and calamities. Today, stricken by grave illness, some bedridden for years, others entangled in official disputes, the young and old of the Wang family fear that one day they may be lost to the eternal night. They have summoned your servants to their home to beseech the roots of the Seven Mysteries, to repent for the sins of life and death, and to petition on behalf of their nine generations of ancestors, from the late [so-and-so] to the late father [so-and-so], numbering so many. The offerings, vows, and written petitions are presented as separately recorded; we prostrate ourselves to read them as directed.

The Wang family’s ancestors and recently deceased, in their lifetimes, pursued official careers, relying on inherited rank. Some served as emperors, kings, dukes, or marquises; as prefects, governors, or commandery administrators of the two-thousand-stone rank; as magistrates, chiefs, assistants, or constables; or as ministers and officials of the Han and Wei dynasties. In enforcing the law, they lacked loyalty; in carrying out orders, they bullied the weak; they wrongfully condemned the innocent. Above, they disrespected Heaven and Earth; below, they defied ghosts and spirits. They devised their own laws, refusing to follow the Daoist teachings, showing irreverence to superiors and disrespect to subordinates. As fathers, they were unkind; as sons, unfilial; as husbands, discordant; as wives, insolent. Within and without, they indulged in licentiousness, abandoning the upright to pursue the perverse, deposing the legitimate heir to enthrone a concubine’s son, endangering the state and imperiling the realm. They favored maidservants and beloved concubines, severing the bonds of family propriety, disregarding admonitions and teachings, cursing one another. Brothers were divided, flesh and blood harmed one another; they fought over money, slaves, fields, and houses, beating each other, tearing hair and scattering it, offending the Northern Lord, suffering punishment and imprisonment. Their misfortunes extended to later generations, while the souls of the deceased endure interrogation in the celestial prisons and earthly hells, the Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai, where the suffering is unbearable. They return to haunt the living, seeking substitutes, bringing calamities upon later generations.

Your servants [so-and-so] and others now perform the purification fast for the Wang family, beseeching the late nine generations of ancestors, from the late father [so-and-so] to the deceased [so-and-so], numbering so many. In life, they committed these manifold transgressions and unspeakable sins, which have flowed down to afflict the living. Their indictments remain recorded in the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the Thirty-Six Celestial Offices, and the Nine Bureaus of the Mysterious Ministry, their cases unresolved for years, never dissolved or pardoned. We now pray that the fast may summon the hundred officials, the thousand chariots, the ten thousand riders, and the magistrates of Mount Tai’s Twenty-Four Prisons to investigate the late father [so-and-so] and the others of the Wang family. Let them be questioned: Which bureau do their cases belong to? By what deeds did they die? To which office are they bound? Which gods have they offended? Whether for nine generations, eight generations, seven generations, six generations, five generations, four generations, for their grandparents, for their parents, for their brothers, or for their maternal and paternal aunts and uncles—let all be examined. Let it be asked whether the faults lie with Wang’s present self, which gods he has offended, or which ghosts he has provoked.

Let all be thoroughly investigated. Here, the local true officials who register qi, the spirits of the groves, the household shrines, the altars and earth gods, the mountains and rivers, the Five Marchmounts, the Eight Spirits, the solitary inspectors, the bell-bearing functionaries, the river lords, the bridge and water spirits, the River Earl, the Water Thearch, the Water Assistants, and the Water Offices—lest the Wang family, being mortal, fail to realize their offenses, or though they have already confessed, have not received grace and blessing. Perhaps they are blood-consuming ghosts who refuse to release them, binding the three hun and seven po souls of the Wang household, or the fourteen hun souls of the women, causing lingering illness, years of suffering, or unseen calamities, their lives hanging in uncertainty. If any are innocent yet harmed by rapacious spirits who devour qi, unafraid of the august might of the Mysterious Capital—

Then let your servants, the fast officials, the hundred officials, the Grand Unity and Three Sovereigns’ *Feng Hui Shen Dong* talismans, the Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Commanders, the Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Mighty Heavenly Generals, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Feathered Forest and Tiger Warriors’ Commanders, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Vajra Warriors, the nine hundred million riders and nine hundred million soldiers, each clad in mirror armor, proceed in order to apprehend the great ghosts and deliver them to the Northern Prison of Heaven One, while the lesser ghosts shall be executed on the spot. If any of the Wang family’s ancestors or recently deceased remain bound by interrogation, we pray that by the power of true and upright qi, their fetters may be loosened, their souls released and pardoned.

If the transgressions and faults that have bound the Wang family’s kin are now to be released and dispersed, may the fast officials and hundred officials kindle for the Wang household bright lamps and fires above the Nine Heavens and below the Nine Earths. May the Twenty-Eight Constellations examine and rectify each matter, destroy the celestial bureaus’ records, and sever the earthly offices’ documents. After the fast concludes, may all be swiftly expunged, that they may bear the great Dao’s grace of reviving white bones. We humbly pray that Your awe-inspiring power may bring the hundred kingdoms to submit in peace, the Xianbei to each safeguard their borders, the seasons to nurture the crops, and the harvests to ripen abundantly year after year. May the realm enjoy great peace, the people live in happiness, and the lord of our state and kingdom, the high ministers and princes, down to the myriad commoners—all beings, the Daoist adepts of the Four Seas and Five Peaks, the men and women of the world who serve as libationers—all be delivered and ascend. May those in the kalpas of hardship, the *yang jiu bai liu*, truly attain the company of the sagely lord.

We now uphold the great transformation of the law, traversing mountains and crossing ridges, dwelling in caves and grottos. Some of us briefly emerge among the people to proclaim and administer healing, building merit for the celestial courts. Should any encounter the wicked who revile the Three Treasures, harbor malicious intent, or defy Heaven and betray righteousness, we pray they may reform, awaken, and behold the highest perfected ones. May their evil hearts be transformed, and may they establish fields of blessing, gaining wisdom and insight.

May our ancestors of three generations and seven lifetimes, along with our parents, all be delivered and ascend. May the myriad families lift their heads in hope, their wishes fulfilled.

We now invoke the supervising fast officials and all hundred officials to descend at once, overseeing the fast’s proceedings, the incense attendants and jade maidens, the minor clerks and messengers, and all subordinate officials. May they bear our petition and beseech Your mercy to pardon the Wang family’s thousand sins and myriad transgressions, their thousand deceptions and myriad reproaches. From this day forward, may fortune arise in the ten directions and calamities vanish into the Nine Yin. With reverence, we present this petition, then perform the rites of bowing and prostration, gazing up in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy.

We, Your humble servants of such-and-such surname, from such-and-such prefecture, commandery, and county, most humbly address this petition before the Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast and Non-Acting Great Dao, the August Seat of the Heavenly Worthy.

Presented in the such-and-such year of the Great Year Star, in the such-and-such commandery, county, village, and hamlet.

This document follows the form of an official petition, akin to memorials and edicts, transmitted by the perfected ones. It must not be altered. As for urgent matters of illness or distress within, they may be stated concisely, omitting superfluity.

Upon concluding the official petition, proceed with the incense rites and repentance, following the protocols of the Middle and Lower Primordials. After the ritual circuit is complete, return to the usual order, then extinguish the incense burner and withdraw.

The host’s farewell address varies by rank and status, and the Daoist’s role differs from that of the common people. Adapt it as appropriate, but the general form is as follows:

Before the address, list the nine generations of ancestors down to the recently deceased, noting the year, month, day, and hour of those who died prematurely or violently, along with their burial sites—whether known or unknown—attaching the details to the address.

For the era of Tang, Yu, Xia, Yin, or Shang, refer to the sovereign as emperor or king, and the crown prince accordingly. For Jin, Chu, Qi, Qin, or other states, refer to their rulers by their feudal titles: duke, marquis, earl, viscount, or baron. For the grand steward or minister of education, refer to their positions. For governors, prefects, magistrates, and their subordinates, use the titles appropriate to the time.

For the Three Caverns’ Dharma Masters, the Masters of the Sacred Peaks, the libationers, and the Daoist adepts of such-and-such number from such-and-such prefecture, commandery, village, and hamlet—if they are not the Son of Heaven or the Empress, simply refer to them as "male/female commoners," omitting "devotees of the Dao."

For disciples who maintain the precepts, the gods of the Three Luminaries and Three Caverns, the devout of the Cavernous Mystery and Cavernous Perfection, the Three Treasures, and the Ten Transformations, refer to themselves as "Your humble servants" according to their received teachings. Men undergoing healing rites are called "servants"; those who have not undergone healing but have received scriptures, or who have not received scriptures but perform suburban sacrifices, are also called "servants." Women of equivalent status are called "handmaidens." Wives are ranked below their husbands, and their surnames may differ, as stipulated in the transmission rituals.

For those of such-and-such age undergoing healing rites, from officials downward, refer to their positions as "lord," stating their prefecture, commandery, county, village, and the location of their palace, residence, or lodging, then bow and beseech favor.

If the address begins with the rulers of the world, state: "Since the kalpas of antiquity, we have borne the blessings of this day. From ancient times, we have revered the Great Dao."

For those who served the secular world, state: "Due to past karmic hindrances, we served worldly deities."

For those who served the Buddha, state: "By virtue of past causes, we have upheld the Buddha’s teachings across lifetimes."

For those who served no tradition, state: "Bound by deluded karma, we failed to recognize the divine. Across lifetimes and in this body, we have not revered any teaching."

For those who followed Confucius, state: "We inherited the legacy of benevolence and righteousness, admired the former kings, followed the teachings of Zhou and Confucius, and offered sacrifices with sincerity. By the mysterious blessings of the Dao, we have enjoyed honor and advancement, relying on the wondrous transformation of the heart and the protection of the Dharma Gate."

For those who inherited imperial succession, state: "By the profound grace of the Dao, we have enjoyed great fortune and prosperity. Our late ancestor, Emperor So-and-So, and our late father, Emperor So-and-So, held office or tilled the fields as fate allowed, their ranks and emoluments linked to Heaven’s mandate. Yet the celestial favor was fleeting, and the pure crown was soon altered. The jade scepter passed away, and our glory and blessings transcended all bounds. We are deeply grateful, yet the great enterprise was but newly begun when it was suddenly abandoned, leaving the myriad lands. The Great Peace was not yet achieved, and the virtue of succession now rests with us. Yet we have failed to harmonize with the subtle signs, our discernment lacking the illumination of the Dao. The myriad realms are hard to pacify, and the hundred spirits are easily offended. Our straightforward words go unheeded, and our efforts to mend the imperial robes are unheard. The Xia rebels sprout like weeds, and the Yi barbarians stir like insects. Heaven and Earth fall out of harmony, the Seven Luminaries deviate from their courses, floods and droughts strike amiss, and plagues recur. The state and households face many omens, and funerals and illnesses follow one after another. Our late ancestor, Emperor So-and-So, relied on his own merits to sustain his scant virtue, hoping to preserve it. We are deeply troubled by this, as if treading upon scorching fire. Yet we have undeservedly received abundant blessings, our honors and ranks continuing unbroken. In the eras of Tang (Fire), Yu (Earth), Xia (Metal), Shang (Water), or Zhou (Wood), refer to the element according to the dynasty. When the essence-number reaches its limit, state it according to the Five Phases. When the virtuous mandate flourishes, the radiance gathers, and great fortune is bestowed."

For those who abdicated, state: "Emperor So-and-So, having carefully examined the celestial patterns, yielded the throne and abdicated. He humbly relinquished the realm, entrusting it to a worthy minister. We, unworthy, were overwhelmed with fear and trepidation, repeatedly declining, but our refusal was not accepted."

For those who seized power by force, state: "Emperor So-and-So, undeservedly relying on the blessings of his ancestors, presumptuously occupied the imperial throne, overturning the Five Constants and spreading poison throughout the Four Seas. His cruelty and violence—such-and-such acts—were recounted in full. Ferocious as jackals and tigers, his crimes surpassed even those of commoners. We reverently carried out Heaven’s punishment, and the vile clan was swiftly eradicated."

For those who ascended through legal succession, state: "The people sang his praises, and the sacred regalia returned to him. As the mandate of Heaven cannot long be defied, on such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, he responded to Heaven and followed the people, offering sacrifices at the suburban altar and ascending to receive the throne. He personally governed the Four Seas and led the myriad states."

For the Crown Prince, state: "We, of meager virtue, have undeservedly resided in the Eastern Palace, raised amidst the Five Defilements and beset by the Three Calamities. Our transgressions accumulate, and our merits and virtues are difficult to magnify. We lack the methods to preserve life and often fail to reflect deeply."

For those afflicted by illness, state: "On such-and-such a month, day, and hour, We first became aware of suffering from such-and-such an ailment. The pain and affliction have persisted for weeks. Despite exhaustive medical treatment and prayers offered both within and without, recovery has not been granted. This is the result of profound sins accumulated in past lives and this existence. With no sign of divine response, Our anxiety and peril have only deepened. The convergence of fate and the extension of ancestral misfortune have brought Us to this calamity.

Perhaps We failed to cultivate the precepts, violated the scriptures, or broke the commandments, deceiving both the seen and unseen, thus incurring divine retribution. Or perhaps Our devotion to the gods was impure, Our service to the Dao was not single-minded, and Our mixed beliefs in demonic customs allowed evil qi to entangle Us. Or perhaps We venerated worldly deities, engaged in slaughter and sacrifice, or indulged in licentious and deceptive practices, piling sin upon sin, causing qi to stagnate and dreams to be disturbed by malevolent forces.

Or perhaps in life We held no faith, disrespected the gods and spirits, mocked the living and the dead, and recklessly invited disaster. Or perhaps Our ancestors, in founding the imperial lineage, deviated from proper succession, executed punishments contrary to the scriptures, or dispensed rewards and penalties indiscriminately, breeding resentment and inviting calamity. Or perhaps in altering ancestral temples, constructing imperial tombs, expanding cities, repairing fields and gardens, erecting towers and pavilions, excavating mountains and pools, damming springs, blocking roads, relocating ancient tombs, or discarding human remains, We violated the great prohibitions of Heaven and Earth and offended the taboos of the gods.

Or perhaps We distanced Ourselves from the sage and the wise, drew near to the foolish and the sycophantic, and entrusted positions to the unworthy, both within and without. Wielding power and abusing authority, We humiliated all. Or perhaps We roamed at night and feasted in darkness, failing to distinguish between dragons and fish, acting with violence and cruelty, and persisting in evil without repentance.

Or perhaps We erred without awareness, or having become aware, failed to reform, or having reformed, relapsed into wrongdoing, vacillating without constancy. We oppressed the people, insulted the myriad spirits, destroyed temples and monasteries, desecrated sacred dwellings, stole the treasures of the Three Jewels, falsely invoked the names of the Ten Directions, disrupted the balance of yin and yang, confused men and women, indulged in licentiousness and incest, and violated the pure and chaste. As days passed, Our transgressions and misfortunes accumulated, making amends impossible. Our life hangs by a thread, and Our dreams are filled with ominous visions, mingled with the spirits of the departed. Strange disasters and uncanny omens defy full description.

Or perhaps on such-and-such a month, day, and hour, We witnessed such-and-such an event, or on such-and-such a month, day, and night, dreamed of such-and-such an apparition. Judging by what came before and after, all were inauspicious, with no sign of fortune. Without the great Dao, there is no hope of deliverance.

We humbly offer Our life in sincerity, relying on the mysterious and true, entreating the hundred spirits to illuminate Our path and show compassion to the countless multitudes."

For the Empress, Consorts, Ladies, Princesses, Princes, Imperial Clan, and Nobles, state: "They shared the imperial bedchamber, attended the imperial palace, and gave birth to the imperial lineage, their clans connected to the imperial house. Undeservedly inheriting the blessings of their ancestors, they have worn the crown and sash in unbroken succession.

Some have governed the provinces or assisted in the administration of the court. Others hold civil or military offices, bearing high ranks and noble titles. Some serve as prefects, magistrates, or county officials, enfeoffed with lands and bearing the insignia of office, guarding the throne, or overseeing key positions.

Others, entrusted with the Dao, have aided and corrected, offered forthright remonstrance, or served as advisors, strategists, or planners in the ancestral temple. Some labor in remote and arduous posts, enduring repeated frontier service, water and land corvée, or missions to distant lands, facing hardship, peril, and danger on their journeys.

Some, though honored with high rank, lack the talent to fulfill their duties. Others, rising from humble origins, have undeservedly received favor and trust, only to face slander and jealousy from within and without. Some, though their wisdom does not match their office or their conduct does not benefit the state, have borne the resentment of the people, inviting slander and criticism. Without support in court or country, they stand alone in anxiety and peril, striving day and night to magnify their virtues without cease. Yet the remnants of past rulers’ ills and the diversity of the myriad beings make harmony difficult. The old and the new harbor grievances, and sighs of distress rise from near and far.

Or perhaps hidden grudges and hatreds fester, fueling rage and violence. Worldly desires and vulgar intentions bind them to ghosts and gods, while auspicious omens and demonic portents conspire to bring disaster. Watching for opportunities, misfortune strikes without warning.

Or perhaps their sins, whether in life or death, have deepened over time. Or perhaps they were misled by others, or brought ruin upon themselves, or were coerced by superiors into planting the roots of evil. Or perhaps they forced others into suffering, breeding countless misfortunes. Rulers, parents, acquaintances, teachers, disciples, and friends failed to admonish or correct them, allowing mutual contamination to bring calamity ever closer.

Or perhaps they have repeatedly performed rituals of repentance and submitted petitions, yet received no divine response. Truly, their sins run deep, and without mastery of wondrous protection, there is no hope of deliverance. The weight of their exalted positions fills them with dread, lest they prove unequal to the task. They move with trepidation, as if treading upon ice or standing at the edge of an abyss.

If those of high or low status suffer afflictions, each should trace the source of their misfortune. Time flows swiftly, and days and months accumulate.

Or perhaps since ascending the throne, so many years and months have passed, yet governance remains troubled and the world unsettled. Or perhaps an emperor without mandate raised troops in such-and-such a province, or a self-proclaimed king stirred unrest in such-and-such a commandery. Or perhaps bandits and thieves, like wandering ghosts in the mountains and rivers, have evaded capture for months or years. Such-and-such a general was sent to suppress them but was defeated in battle, the land diminished, and the state and family daily diminished.

Or perhaps such-and-such a trusted official turned traitor, and powerful ministers, growing disloyal, began to harbor treacherous designs. Through coercion and obstruction, imperial decrees went unheeded. The imperial clan and royal lineage were gradually demoted and dismissed. Close relatives and kin were unjustly punished, and attendants and guards were all executed. With cruelty spreading, great chaos ensued. Though innocent, they were deposed, their weakness leading to ruin. Truly, this is the result of past sins meeting this inauspicious hour. The mandate on the verge of extinction is specially entreated for extension, and the allotted lifespan at its end is humbly sought for augmentation."

Or perhaps from such-and-such a year, month, and day, there has been no rain until now, all streams dried up, and all things scorched and withered. Or perhaps since such-and-such a time, rain has fallen unceasingly, with no clearing for weeks and months, stretching beyond a year. The sun and moon encroach upon each other, stars and constellations invade one another, mountains collapse and the earth subsides, mists and qi linger endlessly. Blood rains from the sky and stars fall—such omens have occurred more than once. Or perhaps snow and ice accumulate, great winds snap trees, evil men and ghostly whispers spread, children’s rhymes bewilder the times, strange attire and bizarre adornments appear as portents of disaster. Corpses line the roads, fires and floods spread repeatedly, the court and the countryside grow weary and profane, near and far are plunged into sorrow and confusion. Famine drives migration, and theft and banditry abound.

Or perhaps high ministers breach ritual propriety, and the common people abandon the law, deceiving both humans and spirits, stirring strife within and without. Or perhaps scholars and disciples spread heretical teachings, recklessly fabricating strange and perverse doctrines. With each passing month, chaos worsens, and instruction fails. The refined airs of the *Ya* and *Song* have long fallen silent, while lawsuits and grievances multiply. Some abandon the Dao to embrace heterodoxy, attacking the Three Honored Ones. Some steal scriptures, greedily claiming the role of master. Some feign the Dao to work sorcery, plotting rebellion, using illusions to deceive the masses, mixing truth with falsehood in the sacred scriptures, altering their order, fabricating passages out of thin air, violating principle and losing their foundation. Yet they insist on their own correctness, passing off their distortions as true transmission, gaining the trust of many.

Some study but do not receive the teachings, or teach but do so imprecisely. Some suppress the worthy and wise, aligning instead with the foolish and blind. Some begrudge those of steadfast intent, forcing intimacy upon the indifferent. Afflicted by evil, they do not reflect upon themselves, but vent their grievances along the way, reproaching the gods. Their studies yield no results, their actions bear no fruit. Stubborn and self-righteous, they slander the immortals and perfected beings.

Or perhaps the talismans they received—the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures, the divine immortals’ secret texts, the jade characters and dragon scripts—along with certain chapters and sections, the transmitted strategies and true diagrams, have been neglected or mishandled, lost to bandits, thieves, fire, or flood in their travels, scattered and destroyed. Or perhaps some have lost certain texts, and the underworld bureaus have marked them for punishment, exiling them until now. Though they have received some teachings, others remain unobtained. Though they harbor fear and caution, their good deeds go unfulfilled, and they suffer repeated trials and tribulations, enduring hardship and misfortune.

Now, in this year of *jiazi* or *yichou*, as the cyclical signs align with the year’s commencement, the four directions stretch boundlessly. Or perhaps yin and yang alternate, the old giving way to the new. Or perhaps auspicious days converge, coinciding with one’s own birthday. Overcome with gratitude and joy, yet the qi and seasons remain unbalanced, pestilence spreads, and illness abounds—some suffer from wind-consumption, depletion, and fever; others endure chronic ailments of cold and obstruction. Or perhaps since such-and-such a year, month, and day, an old affliction has flared, paralysis worsened, and their condition fluctuates as described.

Or perhaps in dreams, they see former emperors, their deaths and sorrows, as rulers and ministers lodge grievances, ceaselessly accusing and attacking. Or perhaps evil spirits and demonic hordes, impersonating others, falsely claim to be old enemies, vowing vengeance. Or perhaps they appear in phantom forms, stirring fear and dread.

Since the dawn of creation, the Five Powers have succeeded one another, governing until now in an unending cycle. Enlightened rulers rise in turn, not merely by the measure of nature’s greatness, but by the constant fittingness of the divine and sagely. When governance aligns with the Dao, dynasties endure; when policies deviate from principle, the transfer of the mandate comes swiftly. When two virtues coincide, the realm flourishes in harmony; when a single evil spreads unchecked, war erupts.

Such-and-such an emperor was cruel and tyrannical, his crimes recorded in the emperor’s heart. His inner and outer circles became estranged, leading to his own destruction. Or perhaps one’s late grandfather, so-and-so, or late father, so-and-so, served in office with utmost loyalty, achieving great deeds in their posts. The spirits rewarded their righteousness, and the people were moved by their kindness. Yet they were forced to punish those without the Dao, compelled to submit to their veneration. Or perhaps they joined with others to execute just punishment, quelling calamity and restoring order. Their fate brought them to this point, and all that was abolished was beyond their control.

Now, as heaven’s pivot turns and earth’s axis shifts, the unseen and visible worlds align, and auspicious signs should flourish. Yet dreams of omens and strange phenomena persist, with evil spirits manifesting in forms and voices. This must be due to jealous ghosts and envious spirits recklessly testing the boundaries. Without the Great Dao, there is no means to dispel them.

If these are demonic grudges, may they be swiftly subdued. If they are true spirits, may they likewise depart. Repaying hatred with hatred only deepens enmity, while repaying hatred with virtue brings forth ten thousand blessings. The sages of old did not dwell on past wrongs; surely the gods and spirits of today do not cling to old grudges. May heaven guide the repayment of evil, banishing all enmity. May disputes be resolved, and the living and dead rejoice together.

Or perhaps one’s fate is at a perilous juncture, destined to encounter misfortune. Yet with the divine might’s intervention, even in dire straits, salvation is assured. Dark blessings are bestowed, and fear of ruin is dispelled. If there are public or private worries, disturbing dreams, or sudden losses, one may vow to hold a fast, the scale of which depends on the individual.

Or perhaps on such-and-such a year, month, and day, for such-and-such a matter, one made a vow at such-and-such a Daoist’s abode, in such-and-such a place. Having received grace and seen their wish fulfilled, they now fulfill their earlier promise. Or perhaps the wish remains unfulfilled, yet by this day, they reflect on their past transgressions without resentment. Having made their vow, they dare not renege. Now, they prepare offerings and fasts, beseeching further favor.

If there has been a death—whether of the late emperor, so-and-so, one’s late father, the emperor so-and-so, a late uncle, brother, son, or nephew, the prince so-and-so, or a late aunt, sister, or the princess so-and-so, or a high minister of such-and-such a rank—who passed away on such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, one mourns in sorrow and regret, unable to undo what has been done. Their divine radiance has not returned, their swords and shoes remain, yet the world is filled with cares and anxieties, forcing one to follow provisional rites. On such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, their mountain mausoleum was constructed; on such-and-such a month, day, and hour, the eternal resting place was divined and fixed. Though posthumous titles are bestowed and longing deepens with each passing day, one knows not which path the soul of the deceased has taken. Now, on the twenty-first day of mourning, the anniversary of their passing, overcome with grief, one turns to the Dao to beseech grace.

It is heard that the Great Dao’s wondrous dharma, in its natural purity, bestows profound merit and boundless blessings, delivering countless beings. Humbly observing this fast, one presents these words in reverence.

May it please the Dharma Masters and Daoist priests to perform the Dao, invoke blessings, and beseech grace; to confess, repent, and offer gratitude; to implore forgiveness for the faults and inadequacies of this humble one; to cleanse and purge the misfortunes of past and present; to deliver and ascend the nine generations of ancestors and parents, the spirits of the seven ancestral temples, the departed kin both near and distant of so-and-so, the five ancestral temples of the dukes and marquises, and all officials from the grand masters downward who lack ancestral temples—together with the seven generations of ancestors, all forebears, and every departed soul—freeing them from hell, guiding them to heaven, allowing them to undergo refinement and rebirth, to ascend beyond karmic entanglements, and to unite with the Dao in perfection.

May blessings extend to the present, ensuring the imperial mausoleums, the imperial tombs, and all graves remain undisturbed; may baleful influences be severed; may palaces, estates, and the dwellings of all commoners be blessed with fortune; may disasters never arise; may warfare cease; and may harmony prevail between high and low.

Above all, may the Supreme Emperor so-and-so and the Empress Dowager so-and-so enjoy boundless blessings at their tables; may the six palaces thrive in health; may the great and lesser princes, the imperial consorts and princesses both within and beyond the court, and all from near and far be granted peace. May heaven and earth unite in harmony, the seven luminaries align in brightness, the four seas rest in stillness, and the nine grains flourish in abundance. May barbarian tribes submit, enemy states surrender, and creditors and adversaries reconcile in kinship.

Should any in such-and-such a province act in rebellion, may their downfall be swift; may traitors and rebels be eradicated in their time; may bandits and thieves be forever abolished. May the principles of governance be unified, the six directions purified in harmony, and all people rejoice in joy. May the world attain great peace, and all beings across the boundless realms—whether already born or yet to be—achieve fulfillment, escape suffering, and attain liberation in carefree bliss.

As the seasons turn from spring to summer, through autumn and winter, may this one remain steadfast in integrity and fortune, and may all afflictions swiftly pass. Or should there be a particular wish, may it be fulfilled; may anxieties dissolve; may majesty and prosperity flourish; may wisdom and insight deepen; may the mandate of heaven endure; and may the ten directions’ benevolent spirits guard the body and protect life. May the officials of the three realms bring auspiciousness and dispel misfortune, aligning humans and spirits in mutual aid. May the body become as indestructible as vajra, longevity assured, and all good omens manifest.

For those of ducal rank and below, speak not of the "mandate of heaven" but of "fortune"; for marquises and below, speak of "longevity." It is also fitting to say: may superiors and inferiors unite in joy, inner and outer realms harmonize, slander cease, ranks and emoluments rise, studies bear fruit, merits and deeds shine, all paths open for movement, plans and aspirations align with the heart’s desire, the young and old advance or retreat as they will, wealth and property flourish, crafts and arts prove efficacious, descendants multiply, the Dao’s transformation renew daily, and all rely upon and receive what they seek. Reverently bearing the boundless grace of the Great Dao, these words are humbly presented.

On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month in the year of the Great Year Star.

The words of those who receive the scriptures and precepts follow the model of the master-disciple ritual. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all adapt according to their station.

For oneself, when personally presenting the scriptures and charts, the form of address follows the ritual model, with adjustments made as appropriate.

When acting on behalf of another in transmission, the memorial follows the preceding format. For grand state rituals, adhere to the following established form:

Facing north, strike the drum thirty-six times.

Your servant [Name], the thirty-nine celestial officials of the four limbs and five body parts within this body, the Jade Void Attendants and Left-Right Flying Immortals, the Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primordial August Perfected, the Flying Dragon Merit Officers, and the Divine Immortal Envoys—thirty-six each—emerge.

The Jade Void Attendants bear the feathered staffs of the Flying Immortals and the nine-colored radiant celestial banners. The Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primordial August Perfected hold the life-summoning demon-subduing banners of the Five Emperors. The Flying Dragon Merit Officers wear feathered robes adorned with golden perfected phoenix emblems. The Divine Immortal Envoys, intertwined with the Seven Primes, hold jade tablets and stand before your servant, receiving the secret words into their mouths. They ascend in golden-rooted purple-canopied chariots with cinnabar shafts and jade carriages, soaring upon the discourse of flying clouds, accompanied by twelve Golden Immortals and Jade Maidens, and twenty-four myriad hosts of left and right dragon-tiger soaring celestial riders, all emerging in solemn majesty.

From the Imperial Seat Palace emerge nine Jade Boys and Jade Maidens in phoenix robes. From the Middle Prime Palace emerge nine Dark Prime Jade Boys and Purple-Robed Jade Maidens. From the Net-Spirit Palace emerge nine Phoenix-Robed Jade Boys and Indigo-Robed Jade Maidens. From the Upper Honor Palace emerge nine Vermilion-Robed Jade Boys and Feather-Robed Jade Maidens. From the True Prime Palace emerge nine Brocade-Robed Jade Boys and Phoenix-Robed Jade Maidens. From the Record-Bright Palace emerge nine Vermilion-Brocade-Robed Jade Boys and Jade Maidens. From the Supreme Palace emerge nine Feather-Robed Jade Boys and Brocade-Robed Jade Maidens. From the Origin-Dark Palace emerge nine Cloud-Brocade-Robed Jade Boys and Vermilion-Brocade-Robed Jade Maidens. From the Barrier-Meeting Palace emerge nine Flying-Brocade-Robed Jade Boys and Gauze-Robed Jade Maidens.

Twelve each of the Left and Right Merit Officers of Non-Action, the Wielding-Spirit Primordial Merit Officers, the Supreme Pole Merit Officers, and the Highest Jade Boys and Jade Maidens emerge. Twelve each of the Supreme Chief Ministers and Supreme Dark Envoys emerge. Thirty-six divisions of Wielding-Spirit troops and cavalry, each with nine hundred million myriad riders, emerge. The land spirits and true officials within and beyond the Three Realms, all in ceremonial attire, array themselves to the left and right, front and back, standing in the void, each attending to their duties.

The Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, the Perfected Envoys, and the Flying Immortals ascend through the Purple Void, entering the towering jasper chambers and golden-radiant jade halls within the Purple Orchid precincts of the Nine Heavens. There, they reverently address the Boundless and Ineffable Supreme Cavern-True Nine Primes Primordial Father, the Supreme Void Primordial Mother, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Supreme Jade Void Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the August Jade Dawn Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Four Offices and Five Emperors of the Boundless Heavenly Worthies, the qi-linked Natural Mystery Capital Primordial August, and the disciples of the Great Cavern’s Three Radiances, the Lesser Signs Perfected of this humble servant.

By karmic fortune, this humble servant has been blessed to be born into the Dharma gate, or to encounter the mysterious transformation and receive the precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens. Loving the Dao and delighting in perfection, I aspire to attain immortality. I invoke the mysterious and make vows, secretly practicing cultivation, and by the Dharma, I shall open the path to deliver like-minded worthies.

Now there are Daoist men and women whose names are recorded here, who present their words and hold fast to their faith, seeking to receive the *Dongzhen* scriptures. They offer their sincerest devotion, their resolve enduring through the profound statutes, which brook no denial or obstruction.

With reverence, I have sought the *Three Hundred Scrolls of the Upper Canon of the Azure Palace* and the *Three Thousand Precious Oral Instructions*. The elementary studies of lesser immortals are not fitting for their pursuit; the names of the perfected and transcendents are recorded in the Azure Palace, and by karmic fortune, some have obtained them. Those who have gained them are as rare as the tortoise on Mount Gui or the crow-mother of the western regions. From generation to generation, the teachings have been transmitted, sometimes in part, sometimes in full, some standing alone, others in pairs, some hidden, others revealed. According to what I have received, the texts are incomplete, their order disordered, their scrolls scattered, their characters corrupted, and their essential instructions inconsistent. For years and decades, my cultivation has borne no verification, for my past karma remains shallow, and my present efforts are not yet weighty. Though I have received the names of the scriptures, I have not beheld their texts or diagrams; though I have obtained texts and diagrams, I lack the essential instructions. Some I have inquired about in vain, others I have sought to understand but failed to penetrate. Unable to specialize deeply, nor to master broadly, I have wasted days and months, my hopes for results met with silence. Day and night, I am filled with shame and remorse, my anxieties deepening with each reflection.

Now I seek to receive them anew, to transcribe the texts, and to follow their order in practice, treasuring them forever as the jewel of my being. My words and heart are sincere; my plight is pitiable. Though I am of lowly and base quality, unworthy of the exalted, I have presumptuously grasped with the understanding of an ant the chapters of dragons and phoenixes. I have been blessed with the residue of good fortune, steeped in the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, and through the transmission of the mysterious teachings, I have met with masters to whom I have bowed in humility. What I have received—both inner and outer essential texts, true words and wondrous instructions, the methods of immortality, divine talismans and precious diagrams, the arts of longevity, the guideposts of the scriptures—are now largely complete in both ancient and modern times. □□ to universally deliver the boundless, my gratitude is immeasurable. Yet the task is weighty, and my person is light; I have already passed □□ years, nearing the age of fifty, □□ but my deeds and conduct have not transcended the mundane. I remain mired in the turbid world, no different from the common folk. I have idly admired the venerable scriptures but have not risen above the crowd. I constantly fear that old age will overtake me, filled with dread and shame. The prohibitions against divulging these teachings are strict, and the penalties for obstructing them are severe. I am struck with terror, as though treading upon ice or standing above a chasm.

This humble servant and the aforementioned disciple share the fate of this declining age, where the mysterious transformation wanes, and both public and private affairs are beset with hardship. Our aspirations remain unfulfilled, yet we together revere the utmost truth and are bound by past obstructions. Though we have sworn never to retreat, there is no path for our ascent. Gazing at the fleeting light, our hearts burn, and we forget sleep and food. By the boundless grace of the mysterious, we have been granted this day to pour out our sincerest hearts, hoping to fulfill our original vows.

Since this humble servant was fortunate to first obtain these precious texts, I am ashamed of my lack of diligence and dare not grow lax. The disciple now sharpens their resolve, unwavering and tireless, hoping that the numinous will descend and that their sincerity will surely be perceived. The disciple has transcribed thirteen bundles of the *Dongzhen* scriptures, comprising one hundred and twenty-five scrolls of the main canon, three bundles of the supplementary canon, and an additional twenty-five scrolls. The texts are roughly complete, though the collation is not yet thorough. The talismans, diagrams, names, and taboos remain incompletely understood. Days and months pass swiftly, and the accumulation of merit and deeds is difficult. I humbly await an auspicious moment to present this petition to the August Ultimate, beseeching permission to proceed as I wish, with the remainder to be completed in due course.

I prostrate myself and pray that the Great Compassion of the Exalted Mysterious will take pity and bestow the decrees accordingly. May the Three Realms, the Four Offices, the Five Emperors, and the inner and outer perfected officials, together with the divine youths and jade maidens who attend the scriptures, talismans, and diagrams in the Purple Palace and Azure Palace, the local deities of the years, months, days, and hours, and all benevolent spirits, deign to look upon and protect this humble servant and the disciple. May they dissolve and eradicate all transgressions from our past and present lives, past and present incarnations, both old and new offenses. May they absolve our sins and bestow blessings, spread rectitude and dispel evil, eliminate misfortune and usher in fortune, avert death and invite rebirth. May the qi of life and the true spirits enter the disciple’s body, so that no demons dare to interfere, no disasters dare to encroach, and our cultivation may yield past verifications, connecting with the true and penetrating the numinous. May we thoroughly comprehend all things, foreknow right and wrong, deliver ourselves and save others, our merits towering and vast.

This humble servant, without presumption, transmits these teachings to the disciple, □□ to avoid the fault of betrayal and together ascend to the imperial court. □□ As for the present petition, with utmost reverence, on a certain day and month at a certain place, in accordance with the Upper Prime Rites, I present this offering and make my plea. After completing the morning rites, I now submit this vermilion memorial, beseeching the High Attendant of the Nine Heavens, the Overseer of the Numinous, the Flying Dragon Rider, to imprint and transmit this petition as it stands, directly to the throne of the Jade Void Emperor of the Boundless.

This humble servant respectfully reads the memorial text, while the disciple prostrates in reverent attendance.

According to the ritual, the memorial is presented first, followed by the pledge, then the catalogue of scriptures (though if all are being transmitted, the catalogue is unnecessary), and finally the memorial itself. The memorial is written on the *Eight Numinous* paper. After reading it, the text is held as follows:

I solemnly command the numinous perfected officials within my four limbs and five body parts, the Flying Dragon Merit Officers, and the Divine Immortal Messengers—twelve each—to take charge. I humbly present, on behalf of the Daoist men and women whose names are recorded, this memorial and the one hundred and twenty-five scrolls of the *Dongzhen* canon for ordination, to be delivered directly to the throne of the Jade Void Emperor of the Boundless. May they be received in accordance with the memorial, their red and purple distinctions made clear.

If there are omissions or errors in the text, or if the words are disordered, may they be corrected and affirmed, ascending with the qi, so that no celestial officials may reject or reprimand them. May the petition be granted in its time, and the wishes swiftly fulfilled. Should any powerful demons presumptuously interfere, may the Nine Heaven Riders seize and punish them.

This humble servant holds their breath and presses their hands together, awaiting the response.

After the holding is complete, the master faces north toward the scripture table, holding the scriptures, while the disciple stands to the left, □□ lifting the □□ ritual offerings. The master knocks their teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, commanding the light of the sun and moon to illuminate the bodies of master and disciple, and recites the incantation:

How vast and distant is the Great Subtlety,
The true person weaves life from the void.
The Way arises naturally from the empty ford,
Gathering to form the *Great Cavern* scriptures.
True worthies uphold the ritual offerings,
Riding the destiny through the Yellow Court.
Mount Tai erases the register of death,
The Controller of Fate inscribes the name of the immortal.
Guard the secrets through eons of years,
Reveal them carelessly, and hell’s infants will suffer.
Extending to the seven generations of ancestors,
The wind-knife will sever your form.

When the recitation is complete, the disciple bows three times to receive the scripture. For those scripture titles listed in the ritual codes and placed under the general canon, one instance of the morning or evening fast is sufficient for the occasion.

Once the transmission of the scripture is finished, the official ritual is performed as follows:

The servant bows and presents the memorial for the transmission of the scripture. Upon completion of the affair, the divine officials residing in the four limbs and five constituents of the servant’s body—the numinous perfected ones, the flying immortals of left and right, the Jade Void Attendants, the Five Thearchs’ retinue, and all the gods—each return to their places within the servant’s body, entering through the Gate of Myriad Subtleties. Those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right, led and escorted by the Flying Dragon Merit Clerks, each resuming their posts in their respective palaces and bureaus, without error or confusion. They guard and protect the servant’s body, ensuring no escape, awaiting future summons to act, all in accordance with precedent.

When the official ritual is complete, the incense burner is restored as usual. Once the incense is restored, the departure is conducted as usual. After departing, the chamber, hall, and altar are sealed as usual. The master distributes the ritual offerings as usual. The disciple gives thanks for three days as usual.

**Seventeenth Section: The Pledge of Ritual Offerings for Fellow Disciples**

Whenever fellow disciples encounter misfortune—suffering from calamities, illnesses, official entanglements, or sudden disasters—they may together perform the rituals of the Middle Prime. They should bring fragrant oil as an offering and inform the master of the fast, detailing their circumstances to present a memorial to the High Void.

Fellow disciples share the same master. Those who study under the master of mysteries and practice the supreme methods are fellow disciples. All such individuals, who have not yet attained true sagehood, may face misfortunes and should establish fasts. The one making the request acts as the guest, while the one organizing the fast acts as the host. The host distributes offerings to amplify merit and virtue. Whether rich or poor, one must not deviate from the method; the method should align with one’s heart, without limits on quantity. The wealthy should not be extravagant, nor the frugal be shabby. Both inner and outer, form and spirit, should harbor no regrets or resentments. In this way, the hidden convergence brings boundless blessings.

**Eighteenth Section: The Essentials of Fasting**

Whenever one studies the method, compounds the elixir, enters the mountains, transmits scriptures, observes the eight seasonal nodes, the days of *jiǎzǐ* and *gēngshēn*, the year-star, or one’s own fate—whether wealthy or poor, joyful or sorrowful, ill or entangled in official matters, facing calamities or disasters, during national unrest, or when the master is troubled or in distress—one should fast. The same applies when allies face hardship. The merit of such fasts is profound.

If one consistently practices this method, after three years, a true person will descend. By adhering to regular practice for nine years, one may attain spiritual resonance and the ability to ride the void and fly. This Way is secret and weighty; guard it carefully and do not recklessly disclose it.

After receiving the scriptures, fasting becomes urgent. Saving beings and aiding oneself is the paramount duty. If one personally sets a date for a fast and unforeseen misfortune arises, it is due to deep transgressions, where humans and spirits disturb one another, disrupting good deeds. One must not harbor resentment. Instead, steadfastly rectify the heart: for minor matters, confess and repent before the Dao, purify sincerity, and pray for mysterious protection; for major matters, announce the dissolution of the fast and disperse the assembly. Once the calamity has passed, rebuild the fast anew. During this time, maintain focused visualization, repent, and seek grace without ceasing. One will surely receive compassionate deliverance. Proceed without hindrance, persist unceasingly, advance daily in refinement, and the attainment of the Dao will come in due time.

**Nineteenth Section: The Method of Ascending the Fast**

On the day of ascending the fast, select individuals of lofty character, those who communicate with spirits and elucidate subtleties, who are wise and enlightened, to take the high seat and expound the meaning of the method, while others harmonize with them. All participants in the fast should sit quietly and listen attentively, humbly receiving the transformation of the method. They must not be negligent, feigning participation outwardly while harboring contrary thoughts inwardly, thereby offending the celestial norms. The Minister of Works will expose such transgressions, and the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs will punish them by transferring their names to the Northern Feng, barring them from ever again ascending the fast hall.

On the day of ascending the fast, men and women should be arranged according to the depth of their studies, moving with grace and measured steps, circling the incense and making vows. Every action—sitting, rising, resting—must adhere to the method. They must not intermingle or engage in frivolous play, disregarding hierarchy, lest they be reprimanded by the heavens and disdained by spirits. Those who transgress will be exposed by the supervising officials, punished by the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, and their names transferred to the Northern Feng, barring them from ever again ascending the fast hall.

Among fellow disciples, those of high virtue and seniority, who have received the methods for a long time, should serve as the masters of the method. If one has received the methods for many years but is unfamiliar with the rituals, they should not serve as the host of the fast. Even if one is of high virtue but frail or elderly, unfit to be the host, they may still serve as the head of the assembly, with others handling the proceedings. Those young in years but possessing talent and virtue, whom the multitude esteems, may serve as the master of the method; one must not contend for precedence. Those who do so will perish. Even if others are not one’s equal, one must not refuse to defer to them. If the deference is insincere or forced, one should promptly withdraw, feigning illness or declining the task to preserve oneself and avoid harm. One must not presumptuously interfere. Such interference invites disaster, entangling both parties in misfortune. All should be clearly mindful of this.

The three Primes—Upper, Middle, and Lower—have varying durations: nine days for the Upper, six for the Middle, and three for the Lower. For extended fasts within a month, one should observe all three Primes, each serving its purpose: during the first ten days (Upper Prime), visualize the spirits and compound the elixir; during the middle ten days (Middle Prime), absolve one’s transgressions; and during the last ten days (Lower Prime), deliver the seven generations of ancestors.

Those who practice the *Nine Perfected Luminous Codes* to redeem the nine categories of sins committed by their ancestors and themselves may undertake a three-year fast, employing the threefold *Wuqi* petitions and thanksgivings to perform the ninefold method and observe the affairs of the three *Wuqi*. Throughout these thousand-odd days, one must not neglect visualization. In visualization, one must not fail to compound the elixir, nor fail to absolve one’s transgressions. In absolving one’s transgressions, one must not fail to deliver one’s ancestors. If one does not deliver one’s ancestors, one’s own sins will not be absolved. If one’s sins are not absolved, the elixir will not be successfully compounded. Even if compounded, it cannot be ingested, and ingestion will only invite misfortune. Such a misfortune-inducing elixir will disrupt visualization, and once disrupted, no attainment of the Dao can be hoped for.

For those who aspire to the highest learning, it is urgent to establish the Three Origins. The Three Origins are interdependent, like oil sustaining flame—if one is lacking, illumination cannot extend. Those of resolve who comprehend this will surely attain the perfection of the Immortal True Ones.

**Chapter Twenty: The Rites of Receiving the Fast, the Covenant, and the Pledges of Faith**

The Realized Ones of the Supreme Palace of the Dark Capital all observe the Upper Origin in the first ten-day period of the month, the Middle Origin in the middle ten-day period, and the Lower Origin in the last ten-day period. How much more should worldly scholars, who remain ignorant of the Way of the Three Origins, cease their vain contemplation of the subtle and profound? The True Ones will not descend, and all diligent efforts will be in vain, for the pursuit of immortality will remain distant.

If one possesses a sincere heart, one should present thirty feet of figured silk bearing the *beiwen* pattern, along with nine pairs of gold rings, and approach a master to make a vow. Upon receiving the True Writ of Initiation, one must cultivate it for nine years to attain the power of flight and ascend to the Palace of Jade Purity. Should one lightly disclose the sacred writ, one’s seven generations of ancestors will bear the burden of retribution, and one’s own life will be forfeit, never again to attain immortality.

Those who engage in advanced study, upon receiving the scripture, must undertake the fast. The fast has its regulations and rites, which are to be separately requested and received. If the master is also a metropolitan registrar, one should suspend partial practices and seek clear confirmation of faith. Following this text, one should approach the master to receive initiation, facing the fast to prepare the documents, and submit the memorial as prescribed. One must not act recklessly, lest one seek blessings and incur transgressions instead.

In advanced study and the reception of teachings, one must rely on an enlightened master, regarding them as a parent in all matters and honoring them as one would a father. The exalted Realized Immortals all address their master as "Master-Father," and female masters as "Master-Mother." The master’s master is the "Ancestral Master," and the master of the Ancestral Master is the "Great Master." The Way is lofty and boundless, its responses infinite, and thus one does not fixate on a single form. Though the Three Qi cycle in succession, they are ultimately one Qi. The reverence due to the Three Masters is likewise one reverence. In ordinary practice, one visualizes a single master—the one from whom one received the scripture. For extraordinary requests, one visualizes the Three Masters. If a master has concealed their identity and does not reveal their name, or if one’s master is the master of one’s master, one must not visualize them. If one has already taken one’s master’s master as one’s own master, one visualizes only the two youths. Visualizing the master with focused sincerity and refined contemplation, over time one will perceive them clearly, as if facing them in person. Though the master may be an ordinary person, divine beings may descend in their stead, bestowing oral instructions to swiftly attain perfection. One must not be careless or negligent, nor act in haste, lest one fail to achieve resonance and instead invite demonic trials.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Methods and Secrets of Practicing the Fast**

In all wondrous transformations, one should establish a retreat in a secluded mountain abode, its splendor or simplicity adjusted to the circumstances. When disciples come to study, the master must not go to teach them. The Way is轻 in nature, yet those who come to learn must重 their sincere intentions and bring offerings. They should personally visit the master’s gate, announce their names, and bow in reverence, body and spirit fully devoted, to request the Dharma and receive the True Teachings. When seeking mercy or deliverance from distress, they must prepare the fast’s requisites, consult the master, and act accordingly. One must not harbor doubt or hesitation, lest one incur trials.

From the Son of Heaven and feudal lords to the common people, all who possess halls and chambers must keep their inner and outer spaces pure and undefiled, with men and women separate and no mingling of the pure and impure. Masters who practice the Way and dwell in mountain forests, when temporarily venturing forth and encountering virtuous individuals who wish to receive scriptures and precepts, may allow them to stay, ensuring the strict purification of the hall and altar. If a worldly master possesses a fine altar hall, they must not wander or tread in other places.

In the households of scholars, superiors and inferiors, inner and outer members alike may all receive the Dharma. Their dwellings must be pure and undefiled, with halls and altars naturally present, no different from a retreat. In such cases, when inviting masters and companions, one is not bound by conventional rules. Those with sincere intentions, regardless of their status, should be guided and instructed to ensure uniformity. If they remain unyielding, causing fathers and sons to become estranged, brothers, nephews, and even husbands and wives to diverge, it is due to deep transgressions and karmic obstacles from past lives, which cannot be easily resolved. One may allow them to follow their preferences and publicly seek separate paths. One must not indulge or comply with them, for coercion will breed resentment, and anger will escalate, deepening the transgressions. Subtle words may not be heeded; if they are, they must be conveyed discreetly. If discretion leads to avoidance, and they evade or refuse to benefit one another, one must not secretly steal their belongings. If the master knows of this and does not forbid it, they will share in the punishment of the wind-blade. If unaware, the offense is not grave, yet the fault of ignorance remains. One will be demoted one rank in immortality, which is no small matter.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Secrets of Movement and Stillness Day and Night**

For those who receive the highest Dharma, the pinnacle is the power of flight, transcending the Three Realms to wander and feast in the Jade Capital, ascending to the Nine Mysteries above, and responding to the calls of all directions. Thereafter, one is free from burdens and cares. Beginners, however, cannot yet transcend the cares of the realms, which persist one after another. Sudden liberation is difficult, but gradual removal is truly easy. One should contemplate daily diminution, diminishing again and again.

Day and night are not distinct, yet movement and stillness differ. By day, one moves; by night, one is still. Stillness is ease; movement is labor. These two states—labor and ease—are one with the body and spirit. If one can preserve the heart-mind and spirit, thought after thought unceasing, then by day one will not labor, and by night one will not be at ease. To avoid ease, one must not indulge in prolonged sleep, stretching the body and relaxing the form, lest wandering spirits enter dreams, causing confusion and startling awakenings. Such dissipation of essence leads to disorientation, erratic actions, and failure in one’s endeavors. One must swiftly focus the spirit, recite secret incantations and scriptures, rest briefly when fatigued, rise upon dozing, and rest again when weary. One may recline on one side, curling the body, without extending the five limbs or maintaining rigid postures. By practicing thus consistently, one will neither be at ease nor labor.

To avoid labor, one must not compete or indulge in excessive desires, for such pursuits disrupt the ascent and lead to unrestrained indulgence of the passions. Abandoned by humans and spirits, one will be beset by calamities. Dwelling in safety, one invites peril; achieving success, one courts failure. One must swiftly preserve the Dao, guard the One, and seek the profound. Burn incense, read the admonitions, establish fasts, and practice compassion, delivering all beings. Reduce desires, diminish self-interest, value righteousness over wealth, and esteem the cultivation of non-action. In acting without acting, one does not labor. Without labor or ease, body and spirit become one. Unifying body and spirit, one ascends at dawn in broad daylight.

Whether learned or unlearned, one practices non-action, understands the mother and child, and guards the male and female. By day, one gazes at the sunlight and observes the movement of clouds, whether with or against the wind. By night, one awaits the moon’s radiance and examines the wind’s coming and going. One discerns the warmth and coolness of qi, the modes of sound, the rise and fall of circumstances, and the adversity or prosperity of the times. One avoids sorrow and seeks joy, approaches the auspicious and shuns the inauspicious. Those who are not precise in these matters deviate from the path of advanced study.

The Twenty-Third Section: Study Prohibitions and Taboos – Reciting Precepts and Formulas on the Dark Moon and Half-Month

To study the Dao requires precepts, just as crossing water requires a boat. A boat must not be leaky, and precepts must not be forgotten. To act while forgetting the precepts is to fail to discern good from evil—one may mistake good for evil and cease to practice it, or mistake evil for good and persist in it without restraint. Thus, the sagely masters transmit formulas through precepts, which must be memorized clearly and upheld without violation. If one violates them, one must recognize the fault; upon recognition, one must repent, amend past errors, and cultivate future conduct. Perfection in this leads to entry into the Dao.

When receiving scriptures, one must first receive the precepts. The precepts may be contained within the scriptures, recorded in separate scrolls, or transmitted orally—all should be recited until heart and mouth are in accord. If one cannot memorize them all, one should at least master the most urgent. The length of the text depends on the master’s transmission.

After initial reception, one should maintain a pure fast for seven days, reciting the precepts day and night to commit them to memory. If one is slow to learn or prone to forgetfulness, one should extend the practice to fourteen or twenty-one days, a month, or even a hundred days, until mastery is achieved. Thereafter, one should recite them twice a month.

On the fifteenth day of the month, when yin reaches its peak and begins to wane, and on the last day, when yin perishes and yang is born, yin qi governs evil, and evil thrives with yin’s rise. Therefore, on these nights, one must heighten purity and solemnity. Only those of sincere faith may enter the hall at the hour of *rending* (late evening). After burning incense and settling into stillness, one recites the precepts. If few are present, they take turns; if many, they recite together. The recitation should be known to both heart and mouth, without need for loudness. First, one must ensure no eavesdropping, for eavesdropping incurs grave sin. One should announce this clearly.

Those who ascend the high seat bow at the beginning and end, maintaining the same reverence as when reciting scriptures. If a mistake is made, one repeats the passage; if fluent, one reflects on its practice. Those whose practice is incomplete should bow in sincere repentance, writing down all violations and omissions. With shame and fear, they weep before the Dao, prostrating and knocking their heads without count, continuing for a long while before ceasing.

Study has ranks, and precepts vary in distinction. Those of different ranks may not recite together, nor may those of different masters. If they reside together, they should take turns reciting.

During public or private travel by boat, carriage, or road, one must recite the precepts in secret on the dark moon and half-moon, even in peril. To forget them is to invite deep sin; to uphold them is to accumulate great blessing.

If, while reciting the precepts, one is startled by public or private matters or disturbed by humans or spirits, one should immediately fall silent, withdraw, and conceal oneself, without complaint. One should focus intently on the precepts’ meaning and redouble one’s concentration. After overcoming the fright, one should renew purity and solemnity, observe a fast, and maintain stillness. At the hours of *zi* (midnight) and *wu* (noon), one should repent and confess one’s sins, loosening one’s hair, prostrating, and knocking one’s head three thousand times each, beseeching to correct past transgressions and strictly adhere to future compliance. One should bow thirty-two times in humble reverence to conclude. In this way, demons will not test one, and all endeavors will follow one’s will. If further obstacles arise, one should repeat the previous rites with utmost sincerity, and no further calamities or frights will occur.

If one encounters visions—whether trials from the Dao—one must not sigh or discuss them with others. One should only repent in secret to ensure safety and avoid misfortune.

---

The Twenty-Fourth Section: Formulas for Teaching with or without Defilement

Receiving the teachings and violating the fast renders practice ineffective; only when unimpeded may one proceed according to the established methods. If during the fast one encounters misfortune or public or private disturbances, one must repeat the fast until auspiciousness prevails.

If three consecutive fasts yield inauspiciousness, one should not persist but instead intensify repentance and accumulate merit. Both master and disciple must practice with utmost sincerity. If past or recent transgressions cause mutual contamination, one should deeply reproach oneself without blaming the divine. With prolonged remorse, auspicious signs will surely arrive, and upon receiving divine responses, one may renew the fast.

Transmission and reception must follow the established methods without omission. After receiving scriptures, one should bow when departing and returning, announcing one’s intentions and farewells. One should report all matters—auspicious or inauspicious, good or evil, active or still.

In traversing the worldly realm, transforming and guiding the secular, attending to the dying and sick, or aiding those with blood injuries, one must act with utmost sincerity to establish merit. The great Dao is fundamentally undefiled; though one may encounter defilement, it does not hinder morning worship. During fasts, one should bathe, and all impurities will dissipate.

Those unable to establish merit but acting for personal gain, who encounter inauspicious defilements, will startle and harm their spirit and mind, damaging their aspirations and undertakings. They must guard against this diligently.

If one encounters defilement lightly, one may resolve it through methods—whether through talismans, fasts, prohibitions, incantations, or bathing—each with its own procedure. The essence of these methods lies in maintaining stillness: setting aside external affairs, purifying and changing clothes, residing in a separate room, avoiding the fast hall and ritual gatherings. After completion, one should dwell alone, inwardly reflecting, bowing toward the north, surrendering to the Three Honored Ones, prostrating and repenting day and night without rest. During brief respites, one should resume as before, performing ten cycles in a day and night, or twenty or thirty, exhausting one’s heart and strength. One should reproach oneself, arouse shame, and lament one’s lack of merit, unable to escape defilement. One should vow to uphold the precepts, study scriptures diligently, and practice as taught to dispel all obstructions.

If the obstruction is great, one should persist for a hundred days; if moderate, forty-five days; if minor, three days, after which one may return to normal.

Those with weak qi should remain in a pure, quiet place, repenting sincerely without bowing. Those with strong constitutions, unharmed by defilements, whose spirit and awareness are clear, need not rely on bowing or repentance.

The Twenty-Fifth Section: Ten Matters to Prepare for One Who Receives Scriptures

One who receives scriptures should prepare ten things.

First, a scripture box. The proper materials are *cheng* (tamarisk) or *bai* (cypress), but if unavailable, paulownia or catalpa may be used. It should be six *cun* high, nine *cun* wide, one *chi* and three *cun* long, and four *fen* thick. It must be new, clean, and tightly sealed, washed and wiped to hold the scriptures. For travel, a bamboo satchel may be used. If combining multiple scriptures, they must be arranged with strict purity, accommodating sizes without limit to quantity.

Second, a scripture table. It should have five legs on each side—either seven or nine legs in total—made of catalpa or cypress as available. The legs may also be of iron. The crossbars and pegs should be glued with fish bladder, and the table may be lacquered or left plain. The size of the legs should be proportionate and well-balanced. The table should be nine *cun* high, thirteen *cun* wide, twenty-four *cun* long, and four *fen* thick, designed to support the scripture box. Additionally, a single incense stand of the same design is required.

Third, a scripture wrapper. Made of bamboo lined with yellow silk, its size should be appropriate to hold the scrolls without excess length. The wrapping and green ties should also be of yellow silk; if unavailable, paper may be used, and the ties should be of ramie or hemp. Simplicity and purity must be maintained, avoiding ornate embellishments. While brocade, embroidery, or the seven treasures may be used if available, one must not become attached to them as necessities, for these are but expedient teachings of lesser importance. Beware of pursuing them carelessly.

Fourth, scripture cloths. Generally, three are needed: one to cover the scrolls within the box, one for daily use, and two to cover the scriptures when placed on the table. These may be of dark yellow, crimson, jade green, or purple, made of silk or fine linen, with patterns or plain weaves as preferred. They should be as wide as possible, about five *chi* long, and sewn with straight seams. Alternatively, they may have four borders, but avoid elaborate knots or embroidery. Adornments of pearls, jade, bells, or pendants are excessive, for they provoke thievery and obstruct the path of virtue. Nothing surpasses simplicity in opening the gate of goodness, which serves both the hidden and the manifest.

Fifth, scripture kerchiefs. Three should always be kept, each made of two widths of cloth like the scripture cloths. One is needed for travel to wrap the scripture box, and one for use during rituals to cover the box. When worn, they should be replaced to avoid tattered edges. Their purpose is functional, not decorative, so they should not be overly long. They must remain clean and free from fire damage, and should not be used for other purposes. All ritual implements follow this principle.

Sixth, a scripture canopy. Made of black or crimson fabric, it should encircle all four sides, extending fully to the edges. The lower hem should be lined with cotton, resembling an imperial canopy, without hanging skirts or ties. Gold, silver, or lavish ornaments are unnecessary, as the principle is the same as for the cloths and wrappers. The frame should be of bamboo, lacquered or left plain as desired, with height and size proportionate to the user.

Seventh, high seats. Three should always be prepared: one for placing the scriptures, one for recitation, and one for lecturing. They may be made of zelkova or nanmu, or alternatively of tamarisk or cypress. Each should be five *chi* high and square, though four *chi* or five *chi* and five *cun* are also acceptable, or even six *chi*, as long as height and size are harmonious. The sides may be adjusted as needed. They should be dyed plainly, avoiding extravagance. If one possesses skill in painting, images for contemplation may be depicted. The canopy and coverings should follow the same principles of moderation as before.

Eighth, an incense stand. Its height should match the high seat, and its length should be the same. The width should accommodate several legs, roughly matching the table’s dimensions. It should be glued, lacquered, or left plain, with no fixed design.

Ninth, an incense burner. It should be a clean, well-sealed container, made of pottery, wood, gold, silver, copper, or iron as circumstances allow. One should be placed before each high seat, and another carried for personal use during travel. There is no fixed standard for size or craftsmanship. Incense burners, lamps, and containers should each correspond to the high seats. The seating for the high seats should be thick and clean. The Dharma master’s whisk, the attendant’s scripture rest, the small table, cloths, kettle, and basket, as well as the surrounding mats, should all be plain and orderly. Nothing should be lacking, but if poverty prevents full preparation, prioritize what is most urgent.

Tenth, a ritual hall. It should ideally face south, with three or five bays as one’s means allow. The framework should permit passage around all four sides. There should be two doors on the north and south, each with two windows, and one window on each of the east and west ends. Doors and windows should be opened and closed at the proper times, not left carelessly ajar. The basic design of a single bay follows this model.

The Twenty-Sixth Section: On Harmonizing Household Members

The precelestial and postcelestial are necessarily interdependent, and the marvel of ceaseless generation is the treasure of the Dao. Practicing myriad virtues aligns one with the Perfect Real. Among parents, spouse, children, siblings, and other kin—both inner and outer—one must not remain ignorant. They should encourage one another, study sacred texts together, and when unable to make offerings simultaneously, each should copy scriptures and precepts individually, diligently cultivating practice. The diligence or negligence of their efforts will each receive corresponding retribution. The pairing of fortune and misfortune follows like a shadow.

Fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, cannot substitute for one another. Though blessings may extend to others, they do not match the depth of one’s own proper share. Each must rectify their own nature and destiny, avoiding laziness or reliance on kin. When kin assist one another and one also corrects oneself, the two halves complete each other like the eye and the sun. Yet the sun cannot enable the blind to see, just as kin cannot make the faithless succeed. Success depends on mutual support, so one should accept this principle.

The Twenty-Seventh Section: Provisional Measures Before a Ritual Hall is Established

If a ritual hall is not yet built, one may reside in a quiet room. Set up a stand to display the scriptures, a small table, and an incense stand—whatever the method requires should not be forcibly omitted. If resources are insufficient, gradually gather what is needed. One must not act recklessly out of greed or steal carelessly, nor should one, through arduous discipline and poverty, compete with the wealthy. Yet one must also not rely on abundant resources while neglecting preparation, for in worldly terms this is wealth, but in the Dao, it is poverty. The consequences of this are severe and cannot be fully described.

Worthy and talented individuals, acting in accord with principle, recognize the urgency of the Dharma, which is as essential as food and clothing. Even with meager food and clothing, this Dharma can be fulfilled. When the Dharma is fulfilled, it becomes custom, and the divine spirits will protect one. The assembled Perfected and the inner and outer numinous powers will dispel misfortune and bestow blessings, ensuring long life. Entering the Dao in peace and joy brings boundless salvation. Do not betray the Dao, for the Dao will not betray you.

If adversity arises—demonic obstructions, illnesses, trials, or lingering karmic afflictions from past lives—though one may face peril, one’s steadfast integrity should grow even firmer. Focus the mind on the Dao without fear or retreat. Misfortune will naturally turn to fortune, and ruin will yield wholeness. Do not doubt this or harbor confusion, for doubt leads to failure. Failure stems from delusion, and delusion arises from lack of devotion. Only those of single-minded sincerity will recognize the truth of the sagely teacher’s words, which are both trustworthy and verified.

**Threefold Preparation – Chapter on the Oral Formula for Preservation (28)**

When traversing desolate wastes or perilous paths, journeying through distant mountains and rivers, or evading calamity to escape distress—wherever one ventures alone into danger—one must never be without the scriptures. The heart must remain steadfast, and the heart must be affirmed. The Three Treasures should always be at hand. Even the well-versed must still prepare the threefold preparation; with one preserved, all demons will revere it, and the myriad beings will return to the source. In peril, fortune is assured.

Thus, in sacred mountains and numinous grottoes, none fail to keep these preparations. Yet the human body, when exposed to hardship, cannot endure much. The verses of the Dao and virtue, the *Crimson Writ of the Five Elders*, the precious oral formulas of the divine perfected, the *Mysterious Writ of Guarding the One*—though but a few scrolls in number—should be carried in a pouch or worn at the waist, held close while walking or lying down, pressed near the heart. If in a case or satchel, sling it over the shoulder; when resting, use it as a pillow. If circumstances allow, it may be hung above one’s head in the chamber, opened and perused to enlighten the mind, flexed or extended as the moment requires. Transgressions and lapses will depart, and repentance will follow the proper rites. Even before attaining the true Dao, one must prepare as needed. After attaining the Dao, one should still display these teachings to others, receiving and transmitting them without end.

**Oral Formula for Thanksgiving After Receiving the Dharma – Chapter Twenty-Nine**

This cannot be overstated: success lies within oneself, not in fortunate connections. One must strive for self-mastery, not covet superficial knowledge. To lose sight of this principle is to be greatly deluded, even if wise.

Yet from delusion may come awakening; diligence fosters mutual encouragement, and the cultivation of others’ goodness is revered both inwardly and outwardly. The Dao is present everywhere, and its expansion is possible in every circumstance. Before a hall for fasting is established or ritual implements are complete, study may proceed at any time—on a bed or on the ground. Whether men or women, hidden or revealed, one must know the wondrous method: purify the heart, hold the scroll, and consult the Dharma master. The Dharma master will elucidate without need for a chief chanter. Whether leaning or sitting, receive and uphold the teachings with utmost clarity. Questions and answers should be thorough, without limit to their number.

Those familiar with the text need not open the scriptures; reverence may be offered as one wishes, without reliance on incense or smoke. Do not let worldly affairs distract the spirit, nor let external neglect impede the Dao. The Dao’s teachings regulate the mind; when the mind is disordered and pursues externals, it compels the pursuit of ritual forms. Ritual implements are but tools to discipline the mind—they are not essential to the Dao itself.

If one can abide in serene emptiness, free from inner and outer attachments, responding to things without claiming them as one’s own, then one aligns with the sagely perfected. No ritual implements are needed. For those below this level, the mind is regulated by external things. Sudden attainment is difficult, so one must discern and not grow lax.

**Preface to the Four Dharmas and Six Differences – Chapter Thirty**

All learners wish for uniform understanding, yet understanding cannot be uniform because all roots differ. Sharp and dull vary, and inclinations diverge. Even within a single mind, there are shifts between prior and later, separation and union—how much more so among all people under heaven?

The past need not be discussed; the present and future require guidance and instruction. Whether sovereign and minister, host and guest, family and kin, or distant and close relations, hearts and affairs should align.

One who governs a nation must not allow the true Dharma to diverge; how then can those who share a household allow differences in the Dao? When seeking ordination or conducting fasts, they should encourage one another. Whether in accord or not, there are four methods.

First, if the ruler or father upholds the Dharma and commands ministers or children to receive it, they must serve the teacher with reverence. If no command is given, one should not secretly steal the teachings; those who do so shall not receive them from the teacher.

Second, if superiors do not practice the Dao but subordinates wish to return to the source, they should first petition. Only after long effort will their hearts be fulfilled. If three requests are denied, do not force the matter. Forcing it for personal gain deceives both above and below, fostering flattery and mutual deception, betraying both humans and spirits. Some may feign compliance while their hearts resist; others may speak in unison yet remain forever divided. Some will turn away immediately, while others will corrupt the teachings over time, leading to reckless transgressions, shame and insults, brutality and aggression. What was meant to bring fortune becomes calamity. Failing to consider the true path, they indulge in perverse views, bringing suffering to both sides. This stems from past causes, yet they remain unenlightened, sinking ever deeper into misery.

Third, if aspirations and pursuits differ, even agreement brings no harmony. If resentment and strife arise, cooperation will never come. One should distance oneself, avoiding mutual disturbance. Flee from worldly entanglements, return to the scriptures, and align with the Dao. Secretly cultivate the wondrous method, each following their own inclination.

In ancient times, Prince Jin abandoned the world and wandered by the banks of the Yi and Luo; Shu Shen defied his lord and father to ascend Mount Beichang. Such departures were not by choice but turned misfortune into fortune. Whether hidden or revealed, they acted as circumstances allowed, neither harming one another nor seeking mutual benefit. They enlightened superiors and inferiors without fostering resentment or harm. The teacher, through skillful means, shaped sincere hearts, gradually imparting the Dharma’s teachings according to each person’s capacity.

Fourth, when joy and sorrow are shared, and good and evil are held in common—yet wealth and honor flourish, leading to separate dwellings, or poverty and low status scatter them across the world—even if the teacher differs, the Dharma should remain one. What is this oneness? The Dao of long life and immortality.

All living beings wish not to die, and the way to avoid death lies in relinquishing desire. Why relinquish desire? Because greed for profit harms others and oneself. One who relinquishes desire no longer clings to the self; without self-attachment, one’s actions benefit others. The deeper the merit in benefiting others, the more naturally one attains the Dao. Attaining the Dao brings long life, which depends on merit and virtue. The celestial beings above enjoy limited blessings; without merit or virtue, they seek rebirth in the world, descending in spirit and humbling their bodies to establish meritorious deeds, saving and delivering all beings. Eliminate desire, reduce self-interest, refine clothing and diet, practice exhalation and inhalation, cultivate the two essences and five sprouts, the golden elixir and mysterious purity—countless arts, myriad techniques—all serve to support success. Apply them according to conditions, but do not cling to any single method, lest merit and conduct remain unfulfilled, and the hope for long life yield no fruit.

Most worldly practitioners cling to partial methods, deeming their descriptions extraordinary. Yet when cultivation yields no results, they dismiss them as false.

Techniques are but aids to merit; merit lies in dispelling desire. If desire cannot be dispelled, one becomes further entangled by techniques. Claiming, “By practicing this, I shall surely attain perfection,” one hoards it as a personal treasure and refuses to teach others. Yet if one fails to deliver beings, clinging in delusion, one courts ruin and death. Unaware that fault invites calamity, one blames the technique instead. Those who transmit and follow such delusion—can this be called wisdom?

The wise, in learning, do not flaunt; they achieve merit without attachment, never boasting or bragging. In success, they do not claim credit; in failure, they do not cling. Not clinging is the act of acting without contention, benefiting without harming. They model earth and emulate heaven, their brightness equal to sun and moon. Their devotion is singular; in that singular devotion, merit and virtue flourish. Flourishing yet not forced, it arises from spontaneity—boundless, without limit.

There are refined and coarse practices, both interwoven in cultivation, yielding six distinct paths:

1. **In the World**: Engaging in marriage and office, standing alone in purpose, following what brings peace. They cultivate Dao and technique together, delivering both self and others. In prosperity, they glorify and praise; in adversity, they correct and assist. Advancement is not for greed of honor; retreat is not to avoid hardship.

2. **Beyond the World**: Feasting on mist and ingesting qi, transforming the body, becoming cloud-borne feathered transcendents, roaming with spirits.

3. **At Home**: Serving the Three Honored Ones above, befriending the Four Companions in the middle, and nurturing all beings below. They fulfill every good deed.

4. **Leaving Home**: Parting from kin and forsaking love, dwelling alone in solitude—whether in mountain forests or city lanes.

5. **Wandering**: Now in mountains, now in waters; now in the world, now at home; now in court, now in the wilds. Their footsteps never cease. Silence and speech, concealment and revelation—they adapt to the moment.

6. **Secluded Dwelling**: Resolving to remain in mountains and waters, departing without return. They do not bow to kings or lords, holding their pursuits in high esteem.

All follow the Great Mystery, practicing Dao and virtue together. Though their merits and traces differ, they achieve these six variations.

These six variations must not be rigidly equated; they converge in teaching and transformation. Skillful means are required—yet the power of skillful means is easily confused and difficult to practice. Why pursue what is difficult and easily confused? Because when the karmic conditions of beings arise, one cannot but act. Dispel greed and lust, calm anger and hatred, eliminate perverse ignorance, extinguish the three poisons. When the three poisons are destroyed, old age, sickness, death, and suffering vanish.

Small wisdom binds and leads to confusion; great wisdom liberates and brings merit. Yet subtle karmic responses arise from ignorance, while coarse methods respond to coarse conditions. Faced with such difficulty, practice yields no attainment and instead invites deeper harm. Weigh carefully, restrain and elevate, and return harmony to the fore. Though principle may be difficult, affairs can be measured.

Measure their taboos without hasty suppression; suppression that cannot become disaster may still be made known. Gradually open and transform, guiding toward universal deliverance, with the intent to preserve all. To diminish the self for the benefit of others is the constant way of Dao. To diminish without benefit is forbidden by the Dharma. To benefit the self at the expense of others is forbidden by all sages. To harm both without benefit is not to be done recklessly.

Act without acting—this does not prevent diminishment, yet nothing is left undone, universally benefiting all. Reflecting on this, one grasps the essential subtlety.

*Thus concludes Scroll Seven of* The Cavern-Realized Supreme Highest Jade Scripture of the Grand Empyrean.
*Scroll Eight of* The Cavern-Realized Supreme Highest Jade Scripture of the Grand Empyrean.

**Lecture and Discussion on Cultivation: Discourse Thirty-One on Oral Instructions**

In expounding and discussing cultivation, contemplate the wondrous workings of spirit and conduct. The kindling of lamps should be constant, their light unbroken. If there is no hall for fasting or chamber for stillness, follow wherever the body resides, resting the head in reverence. In mountains and grottoes, on boats or islets—let nothing be lacking. If lacking, shame and fear arise; the heart must dwell in repentance for faults. Faults breed obstructions, and the will cannot roam freely. First, dispel faults and remove obstacles, and all aspirations will harmonize.

If dwelling in a courtyard or sleeping beneath the open sky, when the bright moon casts its radiance, one may extinguish the lamp, for no apology is needed. Yet repentance lies in utmost sincerity, not necessarily in outward form. When form aligns with the heart, both heart and form attain perfection.

Gird the sash and stand upon the ritual mat—this fulfills the rites and constitutes the highest good, the foremost turning of the Dharma-wheel. Though circumstances may not always be favorable and paths may diverge, even if attire is incomplete, the heart must not falter. If fortunate enough to possess the proper garments, take care not to discard them needlessly.

Those who have attained the Dao and its divine penetrations still observe these forms to guide others. How much more should those who have not yet attained the Dao refrain from neglecting them? Though one may comprehend a single method, one may not yet grasp its application across all circumstances. If there is undue haste or rigidity, let it be tempered to smooth passage. Temporary adaptation for others is not forbidden, but prohibitions must distinguish the deviant from the correct. Correctness is the constant rule; deviation is not. The Way of constancy is governed by the heart, which must never be partial—partiality lies only in outward traces.

When circumstances are not partial, the attire—whether headscarf, coarse robe, ritual sandals, or single-layered garment with intact seams—should always be clean and complete. The poor may possess one set; the wealthy, no more than three. When garments wear out, they should be mended, not mixed in use. For those no longer usable, burn them in a pure place. Do not lend them to others, nor give them carelessly. If given, they must be of the same method; do not bestow them upon those who do not understand the Dharma, lest their misuse violate the rule. If the Dharma is lost, repent and confess to one’s master. Upon receiving instruction, remake them according to the previous text, ensuring clarity and propriety. Separate and distinguish spare garments, and take care not to place them in defiled places.

When donning ritual attire for Dharma affairs, if circumstances are urgent and one must act swiftly, there may be no time to change. If no secluded place is available and one must relieve oneself in the open, cover the head with a cloth, using one hand to shield it. In the heart, envision dark clouds forming walls. Feel shame for such distress, repent for the transgression, and vow to cultivate goodness for the benefit of all, that no harm may come. Afterward, recall the Dharma matter and perform rites of repentance before resuming normal practice.

If garments are soiled, wash them thoroughly with fragrant water. After completing the matter, repent with shame and trepidation. Until repentance is made, do not don them for ritual practice. Before engaging in ritual practice, one must first repent. When requesting scriptures, transcribing or collating them, welcoming or sending off one’s master, or receiving and presenting texts, one must wear ritual or scriptural robes. When masters and companions collate texts together, they must not allow others to casually borrow, exchange, or substitute them. To steal or take them recklessly, whether for transcription or collation, deceiving both humans and spirits, is to invite the blades of the wind. If errors are found in collation, consult one’s master to resolve them. One must not follow one’s own inclinations and alter them arbitrarily. One may offer an interpretation, but the final determination is not one’s own.

When reading scriptures, examine and deliberate with care, maintaining a solemn and composed mind. Do not be arrogant or indolent, nor engage in frivolous jesting, misleading analogies, or private scheming for profit. Do not feign understanding or commit coarse errors through negligence. If the mind is weary from thought or affairs demand attention, one may depart or rest, but one must always perform rites of reverence. When leaving or retiring, first cover and secure the scriptures. When perusing them, hold the texts properly, ensuring their order and completeness. Do not leave them exposed or scattered. Separate them in cases and on desks without mixing.

External texts also derive from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Laozi spoke of ritual to Confucius, while the Yellow Emperor established methods for governing the world. The ascent of the Mysterious transforms and guides, linking inner and outer, differing only in great and small. The scriptures and teachings of each tradition must not be confused or trampled. None should be treated with disrespect; honor them as one would the divine.

Brushes, inkstones, paper, and ink must not be used carelessly. If inadvertently mishandled, replace them at once. If scriptural texts contain errors or omissions, cleanse them thoroughly. Wash the hands and purify the cloth, maintaining utmost cleanliness. If the heart doubts that purity is complete, do not handle the scriptures recklessly. When scriptural paper is replaced, burn the old in a separate furnace on pure ground, scattering the ashes in lush forests. If forests are distant, gather the ashes and sink them in deep, clear pools or bury them in clean earth. Do not allow them to scatter, be trampled, or fly about.

When master and disciple travel together, the Dao should be practiced in unison. Yet if the place is poor and lacks offerings, other means may be permitted. If nothing else is available, let the heart be sincere and the body diligent. Humans and spirits will respond in kind. Upon receiving instruction, one must later establish merit. If offerings are available, distribute them; if not, let the heart ascend in devotion. Serve the master with reverence, exerting utmost effort and unceasing practice. With refined talent and clear understanding, wisdom and insight will brighten. Instructing and assisting the master surpasses material offerings, which burden people and generate obstacles. Abandoning them seeks the origin of non-being. If there is no abandonment, there is no unity; if there is unity, it is not the Dharma—precision is required.

The foundation lies in luminous faith. Take meaning as the standard, and the standard as the dwelling. Dwell in accordance with meaning, and meaning will refine the heart, leaving no obstacles to the Dao. The scriptures of the Dao are numberless, attained through the heart. If the heart’s resonance is incomplete, one may encounter them only in fragments—gaining a single scroll, two or three, or ten or a hundred, even thousands or tens of thousands. Some may be humble at first, then exalted; others, high at first, then low. Each bears its own title, their order and arrangement disparate.

When transmitted singly, they are not numbered. When compiled together, their numbers are arrayed. Some have numbers without sequence, others sequence without numbers. As their reliability differs, so too do their methods and instructions. Differences lie in their branches, but unity lies in their convergence. Convergence accumulates divisions, and divisions raise doubts about unity. All stem from lack of comprehension, leading to further transgressions and misfortune. Do not guess or doubt; one will surely bear radiant blessings, able to practice all virtues. Contemplate the spirit, and responses will come easily; the sagely enterprise will swiftly be accomplished.

If one receives the teachings yet does not contemplate them, or contemplates them yet does not follow through in practice, remaining in ignorance without thorough understanding, one’s later state will not surpass the initial. All this obstructs the path to receiving retribution and ascending to transcendence, compelling one to continue studying the discipline and receiving further scriptures. Whether one obtains many or few, do not rejoice or grieve—grief disrupts focus, while joy breeds complacency. Complacency undermines focus, and without focus, progress in cultivation becomes difficult.

The Great Dao is serene; diligent practice is paramount. Ever fear negligence—how can one indulge in empty joy? Concentrate the mind on cultivating goodness, delving deeply into its subtle principles. Without thorough comprehension of even a little, how can one grasp much? Understanding requires focus, and focus yields response. Response leads to communion with the divine—why then grieve? Abandon both joy and sorrow, devote oneself day and night, vow to advance without retreat, and be called a *daoren* (Daoist). One who walks the Great Dao is called a *daoshi* (Daoist adept).

What is a *shi*? It signifies *li* (principle) and *shi* (practice). Aligning body and mind with principle, following only the Dao, and making the Dao one’s practice—this is why one is called a *daoshi*. The term *daoshi* is a humble expression, for one’s attainment in the Dao is not yet abundant. One refers to oneself as poor, or as a *pinshi* (poor adept). When principle is not yet perfected, when sufficiency remains incomplete, one feels as though something is lacking—hence the name *pinshi*.

The *shi*’s principle lies in cultivating goodness as practice. The acts of cultivation are boundless, and goodness knows no limit. The limitless goodness grows with time. Broadly categorized, it encompasses ten aspects.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Decisions on the Ten Virtues and Ten Vices**
When the ten virtues are practiced, the ten vices naturally cease. Ceasing evil and practicing goodness perfects the virtue of great compassion. Thus, the scriptures of the highest rank state: relieve the dead and deliver the living, heal the sick and cure diseases, bestow alms upon the destitute, sacrifice oneself to aid others, serve one’s masters with devotion, construct tranquil abodes, transcribe and collate scriptures, perform purification rites and recite the Dao, yield in humility and relinquish righteousness, avoid contending for merit and fame, enlighten the ignorant and the vulgar, admonish and resolve evil, dig wells by the roadside, plant orchards and groves, educate the young, exhort others to do good, set examples in conduct, ensure actions are worthy of observation, establish teachings as models, and maintain such practices always—these are the ten virtues. One who practices the ten vices is called a *daoshi*. Without cultivating virtuous deeds, one’s seclusion in the mountains is in vain. Heed this principle and diligently seek the precepts.

The precepts are vast in number, to be followed as one obtains them. Innumerable precepts and boundless regulations all assist the singular spirit and govern the three karmas.

The three karmas are: speech, body, and mind. All movements and actions generate boundless good and evil, and of this boundless good and evil, ten are the roots of evil:
1. False speech,
2. Frivolous speech,
3. Divisive speech,
4. Abusive speech—these four are evils of speech, and their opposites are virtues;
5. Greed,
6. Theft,
7. Licentiousness—these three pertain to the body;
8. Jealousy,
9. Anger,
10. Perverse doubt—these three pertain to the mind.

The karma of the mind is the heaviest, for it is the root of the ten evils. Sever the root of evil and cultivate the root of the ten virtues: speak truthfully and directly, engage in harmonious discourse, practice frugality and yielding, relinquish wealth, maintain inner and outer chastity, rejoice in praise and fear wrongdoing, revere and trust the Three Treasures. Perfect these ten virtues, and the ten evils will be forever eradicated.

Eradicating evil and perfecting goodness depend on an enlightened master. The master regards disciples as beloved children, and all sentient beings as one’s own child. With this thought in mind, the heart’s compassion extends equally. Though the heart’s love is without distinction, words and actions differ. Disciples and close kin may exchange letters with varying degrees of formality, but when others seek the Dao, the bond of master and disciple is formed.

The master maintains humility and does not claim superiority. In correspondence with disciples, or in speech, one treats them with the same respect as others, addressing them as *jun* (lord), *pu* (servant), *menxia* (disciple), or *rushi* (inner disciple). After years of close association, one may address them as *wu* (I), *qing* (you), *wo* (me), or *ru* (thou). However, when the master’s father, lord, or any relative becomes one’s master, they are all addressed as *dizi* (disciple), or by name with *dizi* appended.

Though a disciple’s learning may be advanced, if one becomes a master by circumstance, one must not grow arrogant and should still address them by name, maintaining the same reverence as before. Only those who have transcended the world, along with their worldly kin, differ in Daoist practice and ritual from others.

For disciples and close kin who share a master with their father or elder brother, the father or elder brother is treated as before, while relatives who are also disciples are not treated as mere family members. In various arts and miscellaneous disciplines, there are cases where father and son cannot directly transmit teachings—either due to mourning taboos or shared lineage—so they must seek other masters. This does not apply to the natural Dao, which is uniform across the ten directions, without distinction between close and distant.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Decisions on Masters and Disciples in Their Interactions**
Masters and disciples may also be connected by marriage. Though affinal ties exist, the master-disciple relationship remains unchanged. Even if the master marries the disciple’s daughter, the master should observe the rites of a son-in-law, while the disciple continues to revere the master as before. In their interactions, they do not exchange bows. When the master arrives, the disciple should go out to welcome them and request to cease bowing. The disciple should meet the master at the door, but the master stops them from bowing. When the master reaches their seat, if the disciple wishes to bow, the disciple should again request to cease, and the bowing stops. If the disciple does not go out to welcome the master, they may stand by the bed and bow upon the master’s arrival, ceasing when the master stops them. They must not disobey.

Only in matters of ritual do they bow to each other without restraint. In correspondence and greetings, they do not neglect propriety, and in matters of mourning or celebration, they follow the rites. If the disciple becomes a son-in-law, they still repay the respect due to a disciple. Living as father, master, and friend, they are all revered as if they were one’s original master. Though kinship is formed, this reverence does not change.

If two were previously acquainted and later one becomes the other’s master, the latter naturally maintains respect, while the former treats them as before. The principles for male and female disciples are largely the same, except that a male disciple must not take a female master as his wife, nor may a female master take a male disciple as her husband. Only after marriage may they become master and disciple, and once they become master and disciple, they may no longer be husband and wife.

If they were husband and wife before becoming master and disciple, or became master and disciple before marriage, they may remain as before. There are also methods to sever the bond of husband and wife.

Following the teachings one has received, one must take care not to harbor doubt or ridicule, lest the orthodox lineage be lost.

The superior practitioner does not sever the bond of husband and wife, while the inferior practitioner must sever it—this principle derives from the *Sutra of Wisdom*. This refers to master and disciple in the lay state.

The method for a master to transmit the Dao to a disciple:
After receiving the scriptures, one should broadly propagate and teach the Way. If someone delights in the Dao, the master guides and initiates them. Should the initiating master pass away, one returns to the lineage master. If the lineage master has already ascended, one seeks the scripture master. If the scripture master is also gone, one turns to the fellow disciples of these three masters. If fellow disciples are likewise absent, one entrusts the matter to the foremost disciples of the three masters. If even these disciples are lacking, one relies on guarantors. If guarantors are also exhausted, one places trust in those of the Dao.

Those of moral attainment may serve as masters, guiding others to devote themselves fully. Through imbibing transformation and receiving the teachings, the bond of master and disciple is perfected. Only after initiating nine individuals may one take disciples for oneself. If nine have not yet been initiated, one must not rashly assume the role of master. The hidden scrutiny is profound—one must exercise utmost care and caution.

The method for disciples to depart or seek transmission:
All who become disciples, having vowed to the Dao, should consult their present master and express their desire to receive the teachings. If the present master lacks the transmission, they should inform the disciple and direct them to another. If the master indeed possesses the knowledge but is unable to transmit it—whether due to the disciple’s karmic conditions aligning with another—the transmission may proceed without fixed constraints. However, one should first inform the original master, and only with their permission may the disciple follow their inclination.

If the disciple flees without notification, or if notified but denied permission, and departs in resentment or haste, none of these paths lead to true attainment. If the master knows the prospective master, they may make a request on the disciple’s behalf, entrusting and ensuring their completion—thus, no suspicion arises. If the masters are unacquainted, and the disciple’s karmic conditions align with the new master, one must not forcibly obstruct them, lest resentment and transgression arise.

The prospective master, being discerning, should inquire into the disciple’s origins. If the original master still lives, the disciple may not be hastily accepted. Frivolous or fickle individuals, or those whose learning is superficial and unfocused, should be restrained and discouraged—one must not allow such tendencies to take root.

If the prospective master is unacquainted with the disciple’s original master, they should exchange letters to clarify intentions and thoroughly examine the circumstances. Only when both parties are free of suspicion may transmission proceed. If doubt remains, one must not proceed, for doing so invites profound misfortune.

If the original master has passed away, or is distant in another land, their fate unknown, and the disciple’s sincerity is pitiable, one should obtain a written statement from them, with the testimony of esteemed guarantors—three, five, seven, or nine individuals—who jointly sign and submit a petition to authorize the transmission.

The disciple must continue to honor and uphold the scriptures, precepts, registers, and ritual protocols received from their former master, without arrogance or neglect. They must not destroy or burn them, lest calamity be prolonged. Upon reuniting with the former master, they should fully disclose any doubts, taking care not to conceal or deceive, for such deceit offends both humans and spirits.

If the disciple has not yet received any transmission, they have no former master, and the written statement and guarantor’s petition should proceed according to the proper method.

**Method for New Learners to Receive the Three Precepts Before Departing (Section 34)**
Those who have received the precepts but not the scriptures, or the scriptures but not the precepts, remain under the guidance of their master, as beginners in the gate of diligent practice. They must not wander alone without their master. When traveling, they should seek the virtuous to receive the Three Precepts separately. Approaching the virtuous in purity, they offer a written statement and bow three times, presenting a hand towel and knife, and receive the precepts according to the proper method. Upon completion, they bow three times again and serve this virtuous one as their master.

They must not gather disciples on their own or presume to act as a Dharma master. They must await their master’s command and entrust themselves to the wise. Until the wise grant permission, they must not act presumptuously. All actions, whether staying or departing, must follow the master’s instructions.

Only after receiving both scriptures and precepts may one dwell in solitude, gather disciples, and move freely as one wishes.

The Three Precepts are:
1. Do not forget your parents—remember their boundless kindness.
2. Do not forget the Three Treasures—constantly honor and support them.
3. Do not neglect your four companions—cherish their mutual admonition and refinement.

**Methods for Congratulating and Mourning Among Masters and Friends (Section 35)**
When masters or friends attain the Dao and ascend through the nine ranks, all should gather in purification to celebrate, encourage, and exhort one another, diligently and without cease.

If they pass away in accordance with the natural order without manifesting extraordinary signs, all should likewise gather in purification to pray for mysterious blessings, refine their precept observance, and cultivate arts for longevity.

If they renounce the world and dwell in mountains or by waters, there is no need for weeping—one should focus solely on meditating upon their spirit.

If they remain in the court or marketplace, maintaining family and official duties, passing on their legacy and household, one observes mourning rites according to propriety: three years for a master, one year for a friend. For those of the same lineage but different practices, one observes the lesser mourning of five months. For those of different lineages but shared aspirations, if they interacted, one observes the three-month mourning of *simā*. Weeping, mourning, and offering purification rites follow the natural Dharma, with no prohibitions.

When performing rituals, one should first wash and bathe, change clothes, and then proceed with meritorious deeds. On the first and fifteenth days of the month, and on auspicious festivals, one ceases weeping and conducts purification rites. On other days, when grief arises, one may weep in the presence of guests, but upon their departure, one restrains sorrow, ceases weeping, and washes before entering purification. There is no need to always wash the hair.

If mourning occurs within the household, the same principles apply as for masters and friends. The methods differ slightly in inner and outer contexts, but the essence remains the same. What is not fully expressed in writing may be extended by analogy.

The gradations of mourning rites are most difficult to detail, for they vary with kinship, status, and the times. Following ancient precedents with reverence ensures no grave errors. Parents, whether paternal or maternal, are never absent for even a moment.

The propriety of rites has varied across ages, and with the frequent severing of bonds between masters and friends, how can the Dharma remain constant? Though the constant Dharma is complete, its general principles are easily understood. To know and not act is not the mark of a virtuous person. To see what is right and not do it is called lack of courage. The courageous and resolute embrace both inner and outer cultivation.

**Secret of Recognizing One’s Own Attainments and Merits (Section 36)**
After years of advanced study, one must differ from the multitude. With refined insight and profound understanding, one should long since have surpassed the crowd. Though virtue may not yet be perfected, one must know one’s own actions—understanding one’s conduct from youth to maturity, whether in movement or stillness, whether good or evil. One must discern whether evil deeds are repented or not, whether good deeds are accumulated or not, and the extent of their concealment or manifestation.

When the Dao fills the heart and the arts manifest verification, the body may dissolve, but the spirit should remain aware. In serving the world through meritorious practice, one may undergo one death and one rebirth. The next rank undergoes three deaths and three rebirths, then five deaths and five rebirths, then seven deaths and seven rebirths, and finally nine deaths and nine rebirths.

Those who attain this rank need not grieve at death. At the appointed day and hour, they shall part from the multitude according to the illustrated scriptures, entrusting each to their rightful recipient. All personal talismans and tokens shall be returned to their original masters. If the master has already ascended and transcended, the teachings shall be passed to the abyss and the depths. Their dwelling and garments shall be given to sustain living beings. They shall admonish their descendants and disciples, instructing them to fund vegetarian feasts and perform the Fivefold Refinement to pacify the corpse. After the corpse revives, whether through rebirth in the womb or transformation by other means, the cause lies in prior virtue. With the addition of refinement and merit-making, progress accelerates, merging with the Dao.

Those who do not reach this rank undergo ten deaths and ten rebirths, a hundred deaths and a hundred rebirths, a thousand deaths and a thousand rebirths, ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths. Their descendants must hold vegetarian feasts and perform acts of kindness and benevolence, ever seeking to deliver them.

If the heart aligns with the highest rank but the arts differ in five aspects—whether body and spirit depart together, or a sword or staff remains in proxy—some conceal, some reveal, leaving behind models and establishing renown. They expound scriptures, institute methods, and broadly aid later generations, sparing others the need to hold feasts on their behalf.

For those advanced in learning whose body and spirit have not yet departed together, when the time comes for transformation, they employ the art of relinquishing the body, refining the spirit to ascend while interring the corpse below. When choosing the burial site, if several share the same tomb, it should not alarm the common folk—this is called "blending with the light."

As for secret methods, one must secretly observe the mountains and rivers, arranging placements to summon spirits and preserve the corpse from decay. If decay occurs, rebirth follows, ultimately reuniting with the spirit. Heaven and earth are impartial; the numinous and divine converge as one. The earth possesses the Azure Dragon wielding qi, the Dark Mystery repelling the inauspicious, the Black Warrior extending its form, and the Tiger roaring to the eight directions. Thus, the corpse remains briefly, the withered bones regrow flesh, the withered blossoms revive, and the emaciated form flourishes anew. First the spirit, then the body, they merge as one. The wondrous method of refinement and transformation is the essential art of attaining perfection. Those who diligently follow it shall bestow blessings for ten thousand generations.

The Azure Dragon wields qi, the Dark Mystery repels the inauspicious, the Black Warrior extends its form, the Tiger roars to the eight directions.

To establish an auspicious tomb, after the soul departs, measure precisely nine paces and nine feet—this is called the "Dark Mystery Repelling the Inauspicious," the divine qi of the canopy of flowers and the palace of kings. The taboos of Zhao Zidu’s tomb and all harmful spirits shall be drawn to it, enabling it to subdue the essence of the five soils and transform misfortune into fortune. For the households of marquises and kings seeking concealment, raise it nine feet; for commoners, five feet. Use a stone three feet square, inscribe the text upon it, and bury it three feet deep. Worldly fools may possess a thousand or ten thousand texts, yet who can discern fortune from misfortune or recognize the four phases? Beneath the repelling of the inauspicious, tombs are made or broken—without divinity or sagacity, it is difficult to comprehend.

One who masters this art shall spare their descendants from tomb-related afflictions. Knowing the method of pacifying tombs, all myriad prohibitions and taboos shall be suppressed, turning misfortune into fortune. Those who obtain this method shall possess an eternally auspicious tomb—it must not be recklessly disclosed.

On the upper side of the three-foot stone, inscribe the following: *"The Heavenly Thearch commands the King of Qi within the tomb below, the deities of the five directions, Zhao Gongming, and others: To the emperors, kings, marquises, officials, and all living men and women of such-and-such a country, aged so-and-so years, born under the qi of purity and perfection, whose corpse returns to the divine palace, whose concealed body dwells in the nether ministry, silently abiding in tranquility and emptiness—repel and expel all prohibitions and taboos. They shall not rashly harm the qi. May their descendants flourish, their civil virtues extolled in nine accomplishments, their martial prowess perfected in seven virtues. May they be noble kings for generations, enduring as long as heaven and earth, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Nine Heavens below the earth."*

When applying this method, take care that no one else learns of it. If establishing a tomb during inauspicious astrological phases or harmful alignments, use the pacifying text to suppress all deficiencies, turning misfortune into fortune without fail.

Fan Youchong, a Han dynasty Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat well-versed in geomancy, took tombs and dwellings as his focus. In the late Wei dynasty, he attained the Dao while still a youth, saying: *"My tomb possesses the Azure Dragon wielding qi, the Dark Mystery repelling the inauspicious, the Black Warrior extending its form, and the Tiger roaring to the eight directions—it is the cave and grotto of immortals, the归宿 of refined forms, truly the most auspicious of tombs."*

Xin Xuanzi said: *"Those who accumulate goodness, rest in virtue, and extend compassion to all things, while cultivating the arts of longevity and guarding the treasures within the body—though they may have such a tomb, it merely demonstrates the beginning and end. When spirit is complete and virtue is whole, when virtue converges at the radiant mirror of the mysterious barrier, how could it ever remain a decayed thing, never to revive?"* This tomb’s occupant may be said to have met their destined time.

The Azure Lad spoke to the Perfected One of Western City, Lord Wang: *"Fan Youchong’s advanced learning was meticulous and focused, enabling him to penetrate deeply. He understood the four phases of the corpse’s lodging in the tomb, and though he spoke of it himself, his subtle display of merit had its reasons, encouraging later adepts."*

When body and spirit both ascend together into the Dao, they are called immortals. Those who relinquish their form, dwell among the dead, establish merit, and advance in learning to attain the Dao are called numinous beings. Xin Xuanzi, a numinous being, was also a man of the Han. His talent, insight, merit, and conduct were sufficient to ascend to sagehood and perfection. Yet the karmic obstacles of his past lives had not been entirely cleansed, and though he held a ghostly office, he soon became a lofty immortal. Thus, he thoroughly understood the wondrous virtue of the four phases. Those who recognize the correspondences should treasure and guard this secret, transmitting it only with caution.

The eighth scroll of *The Supreme Perfected’s Jade Book of the Great Empyrean* concludes here.

The ninth scroll of *The Supreme Perfected’s Jade Book of the Great Empyrean*: *"The Great Vehicle’s Practices and Deeds"*

(Title missing for the thirty-seventh section)

All who study the Great Vehicle of the Supreme Dao and cultivate themselves to transform the world must not flee to the mountains and forests. Seclusion in mountains and forests severs human ties; it is but a minor practice for avoiding desires, compounding medicines, testing arts, and studying esoteric methods. Such acts are trivial in the building of virtue and do not form the great foundation for establishing merit. In the mountains, merit cannot be established; thus, one must emerge into the world of markets and courts to initiate governance, transcribe scriptures, propagate the wondrous Dharma, assist the state and succor the times, cultivate a compassionate heart with diligence, suppress evil and exalt goodness, remain tirelessly steadfast, uphold the upright and rectify the perverse, and mete out rewards and punishments with impartiality.

When establishing precepts and laws, if they are not observed, enforce them to eradicate wrongdoing. Do not punish first but correct; by rectifying one, ten thousand are set right. Grieve with a pained heart, lamenting the foolish who fall into such penalties. Wish for their swift awakening and transformation: in life, they may yet turn; in death, they shall not be hastened to return. Let them reform their hearts and repent their intentions, forsaking darkness to return to the light. Even if such measures involve execution, it is for their benefit and incurs no resentment. Punishment without resentment is punishment yet not killing. The sage does not kill; this is the martial power of the divine. To establish virtue in the world, without merit and power, nothing can be achieved. When myriad demons harass and test, one cannot attain communion. Swiftly accumulate all merits to repel all evil and ugliness. Only when all difficulties are overcome can one attain perfection. To seek perfection without merit is a vain and deluded study, like one who severs their feet yet hopes to walk—there shall be no day of success.

If, while cultivating merit, one has not yet fulfilled it and encounters an age of famine and peril, one may temporarily retreat to the mountains to avoid danger. At such times, one must all the more rely on methods and arts. The mountains harbor spirits; do not offend them, nor dwell too long, lest one incur their weariness and malice. Strange lights and illusions may arise, flying calamities and mutual misfortunes may occur, startling omens and anomalies may appear, and illnesses or injuries may strike. Merit will be disrupted, and nothing will succeed. After three years, one may relocate, choosing a favorable place to rest. Visit renowned mountains, and even lesser-known ones will suffice. Tread the paths, burn incense, meditate on the spirits, and divine through divination. Invoke the mysterious numina, transcribe and manage scriptures. Whether dwelling with others or alone, in groups or solitude, adapt as circumstances require. Perform jiao rites according to the regulations, and conduct all comings and goings in accordance with the Dharma. Though one may dwell afar for a thousand years, this does not hinder the attainment of the Dao.

Some, due to past karmic causes, dwell in mountains and forests in this life, or by waterside, in fields and gardens, or inherit such a legacy from ancestral transmission, or begin such affairs by chance. This is not necessarily evil, nor is it yet goodness. Good and evil still arise from conduct, and conduct emerges from the heart. The heart relies on the Dao to guide its actions. The Dao has its proper regulations: refine the spirit and qi with concentrated thought, seek scriptures and follow a master. Serve parents within the household, serve the sovereign without, and in between, follow teachers and friends. Rectify the heart and govern the body, refine the coarse and practice the wondrous, study diligently without cease. Whether traversing mountains and waters, riding boats and carriages, or tending oxen and horses, whether among men and women, the noble and the base, in public or private affairs, maintain vigilance and prudence. Adopt moderation in adornment and plainness, invoke the mysterious numina, and ensure all movements and stillness accord with the Dharma. Though dwelling in mountains and waters, one is no different from the worldly.

The mountains embody benevolence, and the waters embody wisdom; the spirits commune with humanity. When humans practice benevolence and wisdom, they harmonize with the spirits and attain auspiciousness. Lesser spirits will protect them, and greater spirits will guard them. With prolonged practice of benevolence and wisdom, these virtues deepen and expand. Morality, propriety, righteousness, trustworthiness, and harmony will flourish. Great spirits and lesser spirits will unite with humanity as one.

All who study the Supreme Dao and dwell in mountains differ not from those in the world; the key lies in the purity of the heart and the strictness of one’s affairs. Though residing in the mundane realm, one’s secluded chambers, altars, halls, rooms, wells, stoves, baths, and latrines, as well as food, incense, lamps, headdresses, clothing, utensils, beds, and mats—all movements and stillness, comings and goings, boats and carriages, oxen and horses, livestock and property—though similar, must differ in their adherence to the Dharma. One must not act willfully in violation of the Dharma, nor be inferior to the common folk. Failure is certain, and one will not attain perfection, for such is not a superior person.

The superior person and the wondrous adept harmonize their light with the dust, blunting their sharpness and resolving entanglements, appearing no different from the common yet profoundly distinct. They wear talismans and observe taboos, regulate their breath to refine primordial essence, build virtue, and establish merit—matters beyond the ken of the ordinary. After purificatory retreats and offerings, they don the true scriptures. If their endeavors do not align, it is because their transgressions have not been absolved. After three verifications, they must still make amends in full.

From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, all three ranks are as one in the mundane: nurturing children and grandchildren to repay the kindness of ancestors. Those who cannot repay, or do not know how, or calculate repayment excessively—all such acts are transgressions. People will grow weary and resentful, for this is not wisdom. Without wisdom, one is obstinate and blocked, unable to open and communicate. Goodness cannot be guarded, and evil cannot be tolerated. One cannot endure humiliation, yield, or bear hardship, nor can one abide poverty or contentment. In extreme joy, one becomes arrogant; in extreme suffering, one complains. Upon hearing the voices of parents, one feels aversion; upon seeing the shadows of superiors, one flees and hides. Some even loathe the sounds of their children and grandchildren, envy and harm their inferiors, and flaunt their actions as extraordinary abilities. Such contrived conduct violates the Dharma—these are the transgressions of the unwise.

Propagate the divine qi and bear witness to the sagely teachings. Continue the lineage and extend the years, mutually nurturing and loving, mutually instructing and admonishing. Cease evil and cultivate goodness, reflecting day and night. Correct faults immediately and firmly adhere to what is right. Be humble and retiring, not contending or striving for precedence. In admonition, do not quarrel; borrow qi to nourish the spirit. Speak gently and move calmly, whether lying or sitting, in proper order. All actions should be clear, all comings and goings precise. Together, return to the source, govern the perverse to protect the upright, repel the turbid to welcome the pure, erase the register of death, and inscribe the name of life. Bear suffering on behalf of others without resentment; in delivering others, rejoice with moderation. Do not regret falling short of the Dao, nor conceal faults to justify oneself. Without consulting the wise and accomplished, do not feign agreement to their faces while acting contrary behind their backs. Inner and outer must correspond—such is the person of wisdom.

Those of wisdom may study the Supreme Dao together; those without wisdom must not be spoken to of such matters. Speaking of the Supreme incurs transgressions, inviting the blades of the wind. Guard your words and be prudent, seeking thereby abundant fortune. When fortune and karmic conditions converge, wisdom will meet its kind.

If one stands alone without karmic conditions yet delights in encountering the statutes of the Supreme, carefully reflecting on the sequence of one’s past and present conduct, then whatever in one’s present aspirations diverges from the statutes must be swiftly and earnestly reformed, while whatever aligns with them should be firmly established and perfected. The gravest transgressions may yet become blessings, but this requires the performance of purification rites—whether for oneself or others—adjusting with the seasons to dissolve and harmonize.

Headscarves, caps, robes, slippers, fragrant oils, halls, chambers, altars, beds, curtains, scriptures, and all implements of devotion must conform to the statutes; nothing essential should be lacking, nor should anything superfluous be employed. Ornamentation and plainness should strike a balance, and frugality or abundance must adhere to the law. These laws derive from the various scriptures, which cannot be hastily perused. Among the three grades of practice, the Three Statutes are paramount:

First, the *Luminous Statutes of the Five Emperors and Four Poles of the Highest Sages and Supreme Perfected*, encompassing the Upper and Lower Palaces.

Second, the *Luminous Statutory Texts of the Independent Treasure Scripture in Thirty-One Scrolls of the Left Palace of the Supreme Mystery*, comprising the Right, Central, and Left Palaces—three in all.

Third, the *Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected of the Supreme*, divided into three grades.

The *Statutes of the Four Poles* state: To practice the Way of the Seven Scriptures, on the day of *gengchen* in the sixth month of the year under the Great Year *Tai Sui*, at the hour of *jisi* on the twenty-fifth day of the month, *guimao*, the True Lord of the Northern Pole purifies defilement and receives fragrance. The spirits encounter the Seven Scriptures—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trust, and the virtues of Dao and Power.

To study the Dao is to aspire to utmost virtue; to attain utmost virtue is to obtain the Great Dao. The Great Dao is profoundly distant, its pursuit long and arduous. Thus, in cultivating goodness, one must first practice benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust, each mutually reinforcing the other, progressing from beginning to end in proper sequence. Benevolence, as water, generates fire; fire generates earth and trust; trust generates righteousness as metal; metal generates wisdom as water; water generates penetrating virtue; virtue generates attainment of the Dao. The Dao and its virtue are boundless, their reach infinite—bestowing longevity without death, abiding in serene constancy, transcending being and non-being, most noble and most exalted.

Benevolence, too, confers long life, though it remains subject to kalpas. Righteousness severs excess, propriety refines conduct, wisdom unites with trust in harmony. One who embodies the five virtues is called *utmost virtue perfected*; among five thousand and one, this is named the Great Dao.

To study the Dao is to study the Seven Scriptures. *Scripture* signifies the path, the means, the constancy, the rectitude, and the accomplishment. The path is straight and easy to follow; by it, one advances. It is perpetually open, unobstructed, rectifying the perverse and transforming failure into success—where warp and weft meet.

Xuan Su, the Yellow Emperor, Rong Cheng, Peng Keng, Wu Xian, and Chen She—these seven studied the Seven Scriptures, expounding the workings of yin and yang, with the generation of life as their foremost aim. Their aspiration was rooted in benevolence. Though not limited to these seven, their traces are most abundant, hence the name *Seven Scriptures*. The Gate of Heaven and the Jade Master both transmitted this Way.

Exoteric Confucians have lost the Dao, unaware that the Dao is the root of Confucianism, while Confucianism is but its branch. Ignorant of root and branch, they produce no long-lived persons and instead foster licentious and chaotic customs. Even among exoteric Confucians, the Five Classics are complete: the *Book of Songs* begins with *Guan Ju*, and the *Book of Rites* esteems marriage, for the weight of continuing the ancestral line is shared across the ages. The sin of having no posterity is the greatest of the three thousand, yet they remain ignorant of the qi dynamics between men and women, the waxing and waning of yin and yang. When they hear of such matters, they react with doubt and scorn, inviting calamity—truly lamentable.

The wise awaken to this, returning to the inner Dao and rectifying exoteric Confucianism. The *Book of Songs*, *Book of Rites*, *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Music*, and *Classic of Filial Piety*—all these refine the branch to honor the root. Filial piety in the root harmonizes with the Dao; practicing music aligns with virtue. Virtue and Dao are vast and profound; benevolence and righteousness are fully manifested; propriety and wisdom are ever employed; trust is never momentarily lacking. By tracing the branch back to the root and guiding the outer to return to the inner, the merit of advanced study lies herein.

The Seven Scriptures are as follows:

First, the *Scripture of Benevolence*: the affection between men and women in marriage, their union to bear children and perpetuate the lineage, ensuring it never ceases.

Second, the *Scripture of Propriety*: once born, one must grow and mature, yet not indulge in excess. Husband cleanses, wife remains chaste; inner and outer are distinct, superior and inferior respect one another, harmonious yet measured.

Third, the *Scripture of Trust*: knowing harmony and moderation, close and distant relations are bound together; in court and countryside, loyalty and integrity prevail, with no mutual betrayal.

Fourth, the *Scripture of Righteousness*: knowing loyalty and integrity, one gives and takes appropriately, punishing evil and rewarding good, mutually aiding and completing one another.

Fifth, the *Scripture of Wisdom*: knowing reward and punishment, one prevents injustice and excess, restraining or elevating as needed, removing the perverse and entering the upright.

Sixth, the *Scripture of Virtue*: governing the perverse to protect the upright, balancing the five virtues evenly, without bias or suffering, abiding in constant joy and eternal presence.

Seventh, the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue*: abiding in constant joy and eternal presence, surpassing all in supremacy. The highest virtue does not act as virtue; its teaching establishes merit. When merit is accomplished, the body withdraws, its adaptability boundless.

All who study the Dao must cultivate the Seven Scriptures together. Each scripture elucidates its principles, varying in depth. The *Scripture of Benevolence* is most abundant in content, while the others are lesser. What is lesser does not receive acclaim; what is abundant earns its name. Thus, the *Scripture of Benevolence* is so named, yet it also encompasses propriety, righteousness, trust, wisdom, virtue, and Dao—five of these are alike, while only Dao is uniquely abundant. When the lesser practices are evenly balanced, it is called the Great Dao, the foundation of all.

Among the six Ways, each excels in its own domain:

First, the Way of Benevolence excels in multiplying descendants.

Second, the Way of Propriety excels in reverence and yielding, ceasing greed and contention.

Third, the Way of Trust excels in sincerity, eliminating all deceit and falsity.

Fourth, the Way of Righteousness excels in stern judgment, aiding the auspicious and severing the inauspicious.

Fifth, the Way of Wisdom excels in resolving stagnation, transforming the false into the true.

Sixth, the Way of Virtue excels in forgetting merit, upholding the upright without loss, entering the Great Dao.

The Great Dao is nameless yet never departs; it is revered by heaven and humanity.

All who illuminate the inner Dao harmonize yin and yang, circulating qi according to measure, adhering to the scriptures in length and duration. They dispel calamities, disperse misfortunes, cure illnesses, prolong life, beseech blessings, and fulfill vows, seeking to attain immortality.

Though one may study all Seven Scriptures, one should follow the most urgent path to remedy immediate needs. Practicing the Way of Benevolence averts rebellious bandits, halts all killing and harm, and extends life while multiplying descendants. Practicing the Way of Propriety dissolves humiliation, dispels licentiousness, and eliminates slander and jealousy.

The Way of Trust extinguishes all enmity and resentment; violating pledges and covenants, uttering falsehoods and empty words.

The Way of Righteousness punishes and eliminates the strong and tyrannical, suppresses and subdues bandits and thieves, and repels all violent and ferocious forces.

The Way of Wisdom dispels perversity and severs grudges, relieving sorrow and illness, prolonging life and extending destiny.

The Way of Virtue resolves all jealousy and resentment, dissolves all contention for fame, repels demonic voices, harmonizes refined music, unites the Five Phases and Six Directions, completes the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, embraces the One to govern the myriad, and abides in profound stillness without loss or excess.

The Way of the Dao acts without acting, transforms beings and establishes laws, leaving nothing hidden in darkness or light, responding to change in accord with the times, boundless and inexhaustible.

**The Coming and Going of Practicing the Dao**
**Secret Thirty-Eighth: The Method for Attaining the Dao Before Departure**

Those who attain the Dao respond and transform the world; before achieving reclusion, they regularly observe the day of their original destiny, at the precise midnight hour of *zi* or *wu*, reciting the Three Hundred and Sixty Precepts and chanting the *Ten Directions’ Revolving Mystery Chapters*, teaching those who have not yet attained the Dao to practice together with single-minded devotion.

For those who do not know their original destiny, they should regularly enter seclusion on *jiazi* days, sitting or reclining as they prefer, maintaining utmost purity and secrecy—surely swift verification will follow.

Cloud Mist Master was born on the first day of the third month in the Heaven of Infinite Measure. At eighteen, he ascended to the rank of Supreme Perfected King. Descending to teach during the Three Primes, he paid homage to the Jade Heaven, then ascended to the Palace of Great Possession, the Hall of Luminous Rosy Clouds. Divine portents manifested, and a halo of radiance encircled his neck. The Void Sovereign Dao Lord bestowed upon him the *Langshu*, reciting the Imperial Chapters alone. He recorded the registers of the myriad immortals, governing above the boundless and embracing below the infinite. All beneath heaven were subsumed under the Supreme Perfected.

The Supreme Perfected established the regulations, completing the *Langshu* from beginning to end. The Jade Emperor of the Void Sovereign received it from the Nine Mysteries, casting gold into tablets and inscribing jade to compose the text, its characters of gold and jade threaded with silk, concealed within the Nine Heavens. The King of the Supreme Perfected secretly practiced and disseminated it, aiding the ten directions. Divided into ten scrolls and thirty-nine chapters, reciting them brings mastery. The ten scrolls contain thirty-nine sections. Whoever studies the myriad scriptures must first practice the *Langshu*. When the ten thousand perfected descend in state, all demons submit.

Cloud Mist Master did not cultivate other paths but only chanted the Imperial Chapters, thereby receiving the teachings of the Three Primes and ascending to the rank of Supreme Perfected King. How much more so for those who diligently practice this method while also cultivating other scriptures—would they not swiftly ascend to the Jade Capital and unite with the Most High?

The Eighteen Transmitters:
Great Perfected of Mount Taihua, Lord of Longevity of the Three Heavens, Great Perfected of Supreme Harmony, Elder Master of the Eastern Flower, Lord of the Southern Culmen who Governs Prohibitions, Central Marquis of the Western Terrace, Central Perfected of the Northern Emperor, Jade Master of the Nine Numinous, Perfected Consort of the Great Numinous, Jade Youth of the Vermilion Essence, Master of the Dark Valley, Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount, Royal Lord Wang of Mount Zhong, Perfected of the Purple Yang, Royal Lord of the Western City, Central August Master, Zhao Boxuan, and Shan Zhongzong.

All subsequent disciples and later followers who obtain this text will surely fulfill the limit of three hundred sixty thousand, ensuring they behold the Golden Portal’s Sagely Lord and forever dispel all worries and misfortunes.

The world knows only the path of floating俗, never hearing the sutras of wisdom.
Vast are the Cavernous Perfection’s precepts, their numinous influence subduing demon kings.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like a single breath—how could they compare to a hundred million eons?

**Hymn of the Southwestern Supreme Lord:**
The supreme awakens the four assemblies, vast beyond the great expanse.
Darkness and light surely have their causes; without darkness, nothing is obscured.
The net of destiny turns the mysterious wheel; true immortals gather like blossoms.
Wandering at times through the boundless, gods and humans behold the infinite.

**Hymn of the Western Supreme Lord:**
The numinous and wondrous lodge in proclaimed traces;
Gods and humans have their ford and shore.
Sailing a boat upon the fathomless abyss, ever fearing the winds and waves may scatter.
Yet karmic affinity relies on past efforts—who can calculate its power?

The Dao-forest flourishes in the celestial capital, its light illumining all earthly immortals.
Leisurely they diffuse their spiritual might, proclaiming the vast Dharma in boundless splendor.

**Hymn of the Supreme Lord of the Upper Realm:**
The Supreme Lord surveys the ten directions; dim and vast, the winds harmonize in stillness.
The circular radiance □ the three luminaries; perfected beings don the celestial robes.
Demon-kings stand with hands clasped; officials attend beside the Feng capital.
Sun and moon veil their coursing brilliance; the seven treasures gleam without end.
All affairs thrive in this hour—calamities vanish, hells fall silent.
How boundless the Venerable One! Neither gods nor humans can fathom.

**Hymn of the Supreme Lord of the Lower Realm:**
The Three Treasures flourish across the ten directions; ceaselessly the void clears in midair.
Wending and turning, they follow the principle of transformation; a single resonance lifts the Dharma-wheel.
Amid the obscure and the faintly discernible, terraces and halls all manifest.
Emptiness and being—nothing is not possessed; towering, the many mountains and mounds.
The Supreme Lord, free of clinging thought, extinguishes念 and ascends into the hidden.

The hymns of the ten directions circle the mystery: first the North, then East, then South, then West, then Northeast, then Southeast, then Southwest, then Northwest, then the Upper Realm, then the Lower Realm—these are called the ten directions. For prostration, one bow suffices for each direction.

Those who study the Dao, with upright mind and reverent heart, fulfill their profound aspiration toward the Heavenly Worthy—why then exhaust the body in the dust of the world?

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: The *Ten Directions’ Circling of the Mystery* arises of itself, naturally so. It stood empty for over nine thousand kalpas before its scriptures appeared; the Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning, in his majesty, compiled them. He gathered the Three Treasures in the Highest Clarity, observed the ten directions from the Jade Capital, subdued the great demons of the Six Heavens, delivered the suffering from the springs’ depths, instructed Dao-students in their practice, plumbed the hidden roots of gods and humans, released the stagnant transgressions of past karma, and transcended the Three Realms to walk alone. What net of heaven or snare of earth would dare entangle him? Peerless in subtlety, he follows nature—from kalpa to kalpa, he never ceases. Resplendent are his scriptures, magnificent his chapters. Truly, they defy verbal expression; kept secret and unwritten, they are transmitted mouth to mouth. Thus, wisdom stands alone, unmingled with other texts.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: These chapters and sections correspond to the Great Precepts, forming the foundation of the Three Treasures. On one’s natal day, recite the Three Hundred Precepts and chant this scripture—whether at noon or midnight. First fast, then perform the Dao-cultivation. Take care that those not of like mind do not hear it; this is no small matter. Those who do not know their natal day may use the *jiazi* day. After ten years, they may perform the rites on the first day of the first month. In ancient times, the Supreme Real Jade Mother, the Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence, and the Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning—all disciples of the Supreme Lord—also used only the first day of the first month, practicing at noon and midnight. The Perfected King of the Great Ultimate and the many immortals, lords, and perfected beings among them often performed the rites on their natal days. Thus, they are set forth here for scholars to employ with care. All may be done within the fasting chamber, whether sitting or reclining, as one wishes.

The great Dharma of the Supreme Lord now requires facing north. The perfected, however, are not so constrained. Some sit in oblivion, lost in the natural, as if in the span of a finger-snap they have already transcended. If worldly scholars speak of detachment, contenting themselves within their own hearts, they merely refine the Cavernous Scriptures of the Three Treasures. Thus, the heirs of the world’s traditions never glimpse its ultimate depths and so blend their light with the currents of the age.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: On the first day of the first month, one should recite the incantation against the nets of heaven and earth and the demonic realms to liberate the path of one’s body-spirits. The method is as follows: just before dawn, say:
*"I shall ascend to wander the upper ten directions, paying homage to the Supreme Worthy. May the nets of the Nine Heavens not ensnare my body."*
Then say:
*"I shall descend to wander the lower ten directions, communing with earthly perfected ones, guiding numinous immortals. May the snares of the Nine Earths not bind my feet."*
Then say:
*"I shall wander the Supreme Capital, feasting in the Flowery Hall, gazing upon all heavens, transcending the Three Realms and the springs’ depths. Do not detain my soul."*
Recite these three times; the first month is the time for such practice.

The Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning declares: Unless one possesses seven generations of great blessings, flourishing branches with layered boughs, noble shoots rising from later sprouts, goodness surpassing ten thousand kalpas, and a lineage of Daoists whose names are inscribed on golden tablets—unless one’s affinity and worthiness align with the destined ascent—how could one transgress the precepts and hymns? The ritual implements are the same as those for the Great Precepts, except one should separately prepare one hundred thirty feet of crimson silk inscribed with script, replacing the vow of removing hairpins. All are disciples who uphold the scriptures. If an immortal bestows the teaching, having already resolved the obscurities of the hidden, no further ritual tokens are required. If spirits reveal it, one should prepare the ritual implements as prescribed.

Those who wander aimlessly—how could they fathom the inevitability of the human heart? Scholars must first examine themselves: if their talent and resolve suffice for cultivation, and if they can vow never to violate the bright statutes in this lifetime, only then may they engage in the Great Dharma. Should they transgress the statutes, their seven ancestors will be imprisoned in hell, and their own bodies will likewise incur calamity—how could they attain immortality? Let scholars take heed with utmost caution.

Thus, the supreme sages merely recited the scriptures with their mouths and preserved them in their hearts, never committing them to writing. The Grand Master of the Great Ultimate said: Those who possess the Five Penetrations still dwell within the Three Realms—this is not yet true immortality. The Dao of immortality is neither non-being nor being, neither having nor not having. One who awakens to the space between being and non-being, abiding serenely in its boundlessness, may embody the Six Penetrations and transcend the Three Realms.

The Three Realms are: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. From the Great Yellow Sovereign Layered Heaven, the Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven, the Clear Bright Harmonious Youth Heaven, the Mysterious Womb Nurturing Heaven, the Primordial Bright Literary Flourishing Heaven, to the Supreme Bright Seven Luminaries Majestic Heaven—the sixth heaven constitutes the Realm of Desire. From the Void Transcending Balance Heaven, the Great Ultimate Veiled Heaven, the Crimson Bright Harmonious Yang Heaven, the Mysterious Bright Reverent Flourishing Heaven, the Radiant Bright Ancestral Whirling Heaven, the Bamboo Grove August Canopy Heaven, the Void Bright Hall Radiance Heaven, the Observant Bright Upright Tranquility Heaven, the Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven, the Great Resplendent Ultimate Jade Heaven, the Primordial Supportive Cavern Ascent Heaven, the Great Peace August Cliff Heaven, the Manifestly Fixed Ultimate Wind Heaven, the Originating Yellow Filial Aura Heaven, the Venerable Heavy Floating Countenance Heaven, the Non-Thought River Origin Heaven, the Supreme Gamboling Joy Heaven, to the Boundless Numinous Vow Heaven—the twenty-fourth heaven constitutes the Realm of Form. From the Luminous Court Rosy Dawn Heaven to the Abyssal Pervading Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Great Literary Flourishing Adorned Wondrous Completion Heaven, and the Supreme Plain Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven—the twenty-eighth heaven constitutes the Formless Realm.

Cultivating the Three Treasures, reciting the Mysterious, upholding the Great Precepts—one may transcend these Three Realms, attaining the wisdom of the Six Penetrations. The Six Penetrations of wisdom are: penetrating vision, penetrating hearing, penetrating knowledge of past and future lives across kalpas, penetrating perception of the ten directions’ existence and non-existence, penetrating comprehension of scriptures, precepts, Dao, and secular teachings, and penetrating insight into the natural human body. These constitute the Six Penetrations of great wisdom. Those who study this inner Dharma become Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, ascend to the Jade Capital, abide eternally without regression, and forever remain guests of the Most High.

The Grand Master of the Great Ultimate said: The ninth heaven, the Crimson Bright Harmonious Yang Heaven, is also called the Wondrous Peace Qialou Heaven, or the Supreme Wondrous Lesser Brahma Heaven. The twenty-ninth Supreme Void Non-Above Constant Fusion Heaven, the thirtieth Great Release Jade Dragon Ascendant Victory Heaven, the thirty-first Dragon Transformation Brahma Crossing Heaven, and the thirty-second Great Ultimate Nurturing Jiayi Heaven—these four Heavenly Sovereign Lords constantly recite and study the Three Treasures scriptures, revolve the Mysterious, uphold the Great Precepts, and practice purification through fasting and repentance. All the Heavenly Kings do likewise, collectively protecting those who uphold the precepts, enabling them to attain immortality and transcendence.

Thus, the names of the heavens are manifold. The Supreme Great Luo Heaven is the highest of five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five heavens. The Four Heavens intermingle their qi, so the names of all heavens are not exhaustively listed. Yet those who study the Dao of the Most High should know that the Jade Capital of the Most High, where the Jade Capital Terrace is observed, lies above the Great Luo. Vast and distant, it exists yet does not exist, is present yet absent—spanning immeasurable kalpas and fathomless depths, it defies description. Thus, heavenly beings cannot conceive or discuss it.

The Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence said: This Dao transcends the Three Realms and governs the palaces of the Six Heavenly Demons. All human births and deaths are bound to the Yellow Springs, for these Six Heavens correspond to the servitude of Mount Tai’s hells. Only through attaining the Dao can one transcend them. Without the Great Precepts, how could one erase one’s name from the registers of eternal suffering and abide forever? Without the Three Treasures’ profound scriptures, how could one become a companion of the Most High?

I, too, have attended the Most High’s assemblies and inquired about these matters. The Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence said: Demons are of several kinds—heavenly demons, earthly demons, human demons, and ghostly demons. The Six Heavenly Great Demon Kings are the supreme demon kings of heaven and earth. Having accumulated great merit in past lives, they became these demon kings, their virtue comparable to that of Heavenly Sovereigns. They serve heaven, earth, and humanity, subordinate to the Jade Capital of the Most High, acting as officials beneath the Heavenly Emperor, yet wielding authority over all else.

When one studies the Dao, minor demons first test them. Upon achieving the Dao, the Great Demon Kings arrive to administer the final trial. Passing this, one is recommended for ascent to the Jade Capital Terrace’s ethereal heights. The Yellow Springs’ dark prisons and the registers of the dead are then removed, and the records of Mount Tai’s underworld expunged. Each demon king governs the Three Officials, commanding demonic soldiers and ghostly troops to guard against and punish deviant spirits and malevolent demons. They are ranked among the celestial bureaus and entrusted with the Most High’s mandate. Their seven-jeweled palaces radiate with the brilliance of sun and moon—places all mortals traverse in life and death. Their governance upholds the Great Precepts, thus they urge people to propagate the Three Treasures.

The Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence said: Without the precious scriptures of the Great Precepts, one’s name will never escape the demonic realms or ghostly prisons. How then could one’s seven ancestors be reborn in celestial palaces? This Dao is supreme, and the great sages have propagated it. How could ordinary followers not diligently aspire to it?

**Secret Formula for Departing Yet Returning, Chapter Thirty-Nine**
Those who study the supreme Dao accumulate merit and virtue, their past causes profound and present affinities flourishing. Their karmic conduct surpasses the multitude, their Six Penetrations and Eight Attainments fully realized, their ninefold perfection and tenfold culmination merging with the Dao’s source. Body and spirit ascend together, departing the world to enter the Mysterious.

To depart yet not depart, to depart yet return—returning to respond to karmic resonance, harmonizing light and merging with others. To depart yet not depart is to be omnipresent; to be present yet called departed is but the worldly view of departure. Those who attain the Dao refine being into non-being, exhaust non-being to perfect being. Abiding here, they attain without going or coming. The traces of teaching serve as steps: those who have attained depart, while those who have not remain. When those who have attained return again, they act for the sake of beings and propagate the Dao—matters beyond the comprehension of the ordinary.

The wise are true sages, and true sages return again. Their minds and traces are unfathomable—drill into them and they grow ever more firm; gaze upward and they grow ever higher. Look ahead and they are before you; in an instant, they are behind. In movement and stillness, departure and abiding, silence and speech, joy and anger, taking and giving, reward and punishment, life and death, right and wrong, demotion and promotion, praise and censure—all are for the benefit of others, restraining evil and restoring goodness, turning execution into redemption, returning to the source. Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating, they are beyond comprehension.

Those of great discernment recognize their Way: they humble themselves to extend others, diminish their bodies to aid people, instruct tirelessly, and do not conceal mistakes. When others err, they correct them with proper methods—methods worthy of emulation. Thus, errors are no longer errors. From beginning to end, they leave behind a legacy of praise, upheld through generations. This is the diligent devotion of those who have departed yet return again.
