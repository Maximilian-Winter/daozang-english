The Supreme Great Dao Lord once received *The Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Perfected Ascending to the Mysterious Upper Record*, its treasured words inscribed in purple script and golden characters. It reveals the Dao of transcending the void, treading the empty sky, and floating upon the luminous essence, bestowed upon the High Perfected Lord of the Jade Purity Upper Palace and the Void Sovereign.

Thereupon, the Supreme Great Dao Lord transmitted its essentials to the Jade Emperor of Highest Clarity. The Jade Emperor then passed it to the Supreme Primordial Lord of Great Simplicity, who in turn transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity practiced its true secrets and conveyed it to the Yellow Radiance Lord of the Central Dawn. The Yellow Radiance Lord transmitted it to the Primordial Purple Spirit Lord, who then passed it to the Central Yellow Elder Lord. The Yellow Elder Lord conveyed it to the Ninefold Subtle Great Perfected Jade Guardian, King of the Golden Gates, High Minister of Destiny, and Great Master of the Azure Lad of the Lofty Dawn, Fanmei, so that he might instruct those destined to become Perfected Ones with this text.

All who possess the Great Simplicity’s Crimson Register or whose names are engraved upon golden tablets shall be deemed worthy to behold this scripture. Those unfit for it shall never encounter it. Should one seek to transmit it, they must first refine their sincerity and respond to its resonance before it may be entrusted. They must swear an oath as unbreakable as metal, pledging inviolable secrecy.

Whoever holds this scripture shall be attended by twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens, dispatched by the Three Primordial Lords of Great Simplicity, who shall stand at their left and right. They shall record any transgressions of negligence or disrespect and guard the bearer’s person.

This is the Dao of the Central Perfected within the Supreme, not of sequential progression but of the Central Harmony’s true essence. It is matched with the Three Primordials’ tablets, its name inscribed upon the Great Simplicity. When one walks, they bear the purple-tasseled staff; when they ride, they mount the Eight Radiant Brocade Chariot. Ten thousand spirits follow before them, a thousand Perfected Ones behind. Nine phoenixes cry in unison, celestial zithers resound, divine dragons open the path, and the Jade Emperor attends their carriage. They soar through the Great Void, roaming and feasting in the Cinnabar Empyrean, attaining the rank of Perfected One of Highest Clarity and Master of the Jade Ministers.

All who possess *The Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Perfected Ascending to the Mysterious* shall await a transmission cycle of three thousand years and six transmissions. If a worthy recipient is found, it shall be conferred in a single day. If none are found, when the three-thousand-year term expires, six copies shall be transcribed in vermilion and white silk, sealed within the Golden Terrace Chamber of Mount Emei, never to be transmitted again. To transmit it to the unworthy is to betray the Dao of the Perfected. To receive it yet fail to uphold its precepts is to violate the Perfected’s oath. The bestower is the Scripture Master; the recipient is their devoted disciple.

Those who violate its prohibitions, treat it with disdain, or recklessly reveal its sacred text shall have their seven generations of ancestors sent to the Dark Capital to endure the Wind Blade’s torture. Their own souls shall become lowly ghosts, banished to the Night River.

To receive the Flying Feather, one must scatter gold as an oath. To know the taboos of immortality, one must mark their headscarf as a sign. Once the Feather Scripture is understood, heaven and earth align in resonance. Having heard the Mysterious Text, one transcends and rides the Auspicious Clouds—such is its meaning.

Names are inscribed at the Terrace of Entrusted Feathers.

The Three Primordial Lords of Great Simplicity have declared: Immortals first know the Dao of seeking shelter beneath the Dipper’s stars but do not yet comprehend the Perfected’s method of concealing the Dipper’s essence. The Nine Dipper Stars are the true canopy of the Celestial Pivot, the radiant treasure of the Mysterious Axis. They are the mechanism that binds the eight directions, governing the ninefold revolutions, revolving and shading the square and round, directing and gathering harmonious *qi*, regulating yin and yang, and overseeing all without exception.

The stars of the Dipper possess two luminous rays, the Mysterious Brilliance and the Jade Armillary, which obscure the night. Their movements and functions manifest the Four Symbols, causing them to flow and descend. When the Mysterious Brightness converges and shines forth, their majestic radiance blazes together.

The Heavenly Emperor has said: Immortals merely know how to chew and swallow yin and yang, inhaling and exhaling the two *qi*, yet they do not realize that the Dipper Stars are the root and repository of yin and yang, the mysterious guiding principle of the Two Symbols. They toil painfully at its ripples and branches, failing to recognize the ease of tending its origin. They seek shelter in its limbs and leaves yet lose its root and foundation. Why not conceal the Nine Dipper within the heart and refine the Two Symbols with cold clarity?

After practicing this for fourteen years, the Supreme One shall welcome you with a jade wheel. You shall transcend the void, tread the empty sky, ascend to Highest Clarity, and be ranked among the Highest Perfected. Your spirit shall revert to youthful countenance, and all spirits shall attend your carriage.

The Great Azure Lad has said: Immortals merely recognize the Dipper’s great majesty, its radiance illuminating the myriad stars, gazing upon the ninefold Dao’s flowing currents, and delighting in its circular motion to gather the spirit. They seek its shelter to attain great transcendence and employ it to achieve immortality, yet they still do not comprehend how to revolve the Nine *Qi* for inner illumination or conceal the Bright Dipper within the Muddy Pellet. Thus, the hun-soul congeals, the po-soul is refined, and virtue harmonizes with the numinous mist. Only then can one ascend to Highest Clarity and attain the Dao, their body becoming a Highest Perfected.

Therefore, the Perfected embrace the Great Symbol to conceal the clouds and enclose the Dipper’s essence to hide the body. My former master thus drove a chariot of green clouds on the left and crimson dawn on the right, ascending to Great Simplicity and transcending the void to tread the empty sky.

Visualize the Dipper’s stars as purple in color, their stems as crimson. Sense the purple *qi*’s warmth. Envision the stars’ size as your mind directs. This is the oral instruction of the Azure Lad.

In ancient times, Wu Chengzi, Gu Xizi, Guang Chengzi, and Qing Zhenzi each stored the Dipper’s *qi* within themselves and entered the lotus seed together. Suddenly, they beheld within the lotus a golden pond spanning a thousand *li*, jade mountains stretching ten thousand *qing*, palaces and terraces with chambers soaring into the clouds, vermilion trees bearing fruit, and purple blossoms blooming in gardens. Azure carriages and mysterious yellow banners, the Three Simplicities and Eight Transmissions—such wondrous sights defied description.

The four masters roamed and feasted for a time, then turned their gaze and returned. At that moment, they were unaware of the lotus seed’s center.

What is called "using the great to enter the small" brings about transformations without trace—this is the ultimate resonance of star visualization, the very essence of vastness and constriction. Thus, one may shrink the eight seas to a hair’s tip; how then could the lotus seed’s wonders be deemed extraordinary?

On the first, third, or fifth day of the lunar month, at the hour of *yu zhong* or midnight, enter the chamber and sit upright, facing north with hands clasped. Stabilize the *qi* and close the eyes, then visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending into the *niwan* palace of the head, with the Dipper’s handle pointing forward and its bowl (*kui*) tilted upward. After a long while, suddenly behold within the Dipper’s bowl a great divine figure, whose attire and name accord with the invocation. After an extended time, a subtle warmth should arise within the head—this is the arrival of the Nine Essences’ true *qi* from the Upper Prime, its warmth serving as the sign of resonance and response.

Then swallow saliva fifty times, knock the teeth nine times, and raise the left hand’s third finger to press the center between the brows. Softly recite the invocation:

*"Supreme Purple Radiance, revered of the Nine Paths,
Flowering Canopy of Seven Falls, illuminating ten thousand dawns,
Moving to command the lofty spirits, still to harmonize with the luminous clouds,
Yin and Yang flow and irrigate, the Two *Qi* divide at the center,
Revolving to aid all without bound, illuminating the host of heavens.
This month, as the crescent emerges, ascend to the *niwan* palace,
Primordial essence knits resonance, transforming into a great spirit,
Named ‘Marvelous Pivot,’ styled ‘Numinous Net,’
Seated upright within the Dipper’s midst, roaming my Hall of Light,
Phoenix plumes draped in purple, tiger-skin girded in cinnabar,
Left side adorned with jade pendants, right waist hung with golden earrings,
Hands grasping flowing bells, head crowned with dawn’s radiance,
Exhaling *qi* to irrigate essence, strengthening the *niwan*,
Soul and spirit congeal in harmony, erecting the flowering pillars and beams,
Enabling me to ascend as an immortal, transcending the void to tread the sky,
Rising to the Upper Clarity, driving tigers and summoning dragons,
Facing north to pay homage to the Kingly Emperor,
Within the Jasper Forest’s Upper Palace, west to visit the Grand Simplicity,
Bowing to the Three Primes."*

After the invocation, swallow saliva thirty times, knock the teeth nine times, and repeat the invocation as before. Then rise, bow twice to the north, twice to the west, and upon completion, no longer close the eyes—the ritual is concluded. This may be practiced in any quiet chamber above the lungs, and bowing need not touch the ground.

The true adept values stability in what is inherently stable, revering the wondrous and subtle while avoiding convoluted deviations that disrupt constancy or contravene one’s destined abode. The essential Dao is unburdensome; its key points are peerless.

Subsequent invocations of the Three Petitions follow this method, differing only in the wording of the prayers and the orientation of the visualized stars. The crucial point lies in a secluded chamber, ensuring no one witnesses the visualization. This is because, during visualization, jade lads and jade maidens stand beside you as witnesses.

Moreover, one must not attend funerals or approach corpses, nor traverse defiled or inauspicious places. Clothing, bedding, headscarves, and shoes must not be carelessly exchanged with others, lest one borrow from the unfit.

What, then, is "fit"? Those who share the same aspirations and covenant. Those not of like mind should not share the same mat, nor those not of the same alliance partake of the same feast—Daoists and secular folk are distinct.

Those who revere the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons should not dwell in their chambers, nor partake of their offerings, nor wear their garments, nor don their headscarves. This is to avoid the corpse’s defiled *qi* and block the passage of malevolent winds.

This is what is meant by the true Dao of the true Dao, the refined subtlety of refined subtlety. If one can embody its subtlety, one attains its truth; if one can avoid defilement, one obtains renewal.

Should one dwell in chaos, mingling the foul and fragrant in the same vessel, failing to exalt the spirit or refine the *qi*, conflating licentiousness with chastity, greed with integrity, sharing the same seat—if one treads the path of malevolent winds without purifying the heart, or walks amidst dust and filth without aspiring to transcendence, then seeking the true Dao will yield no truth.

A night-blooming pearl does not grow in a cesspit; a lowly talent cannot flourish on a lofty peak—this is the principle.

Subtle resonance and fleeting apparitions, the workings of the spirit’s response—these are as delicate as jade’s luster or the radiance of divine light. Unless one’s master instructs otherwise, do not speak of them.

The great spirit within the Dipper is the essence of the nine stars, suddenly manifesting through resonance. During practice, one must visualize its name and appearance until the invocation is complete; afterward, another spirit will appear, and one should visualize anew. As for the star spirit within the *niwan*, it should always be visualized as residing there, following this method in all matters.

Visualize the Dipper’s stars descending until, without realizing it, they suddenly appear within one’s form. Initially, the visualization may not yet respond—simply focus the mind intently, as if the stars are already within the body, and resonance will eventually arise. With time, one will gradually enter the wondrous.

On the seventh, ninth, or twelfth day of the lunar month, at the hour of *yu zhong* or midnight, enter the chamber and sit upright with hands clasped. Stabilize the *qi* and close the eyes, then visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending into the heart, with the Dipper’s handle upright and its bowl facing outward. After a long while, suddenly behold within the bowl a great divine figure, whose attire and name accord with the invocation. After an extended time, warmth should arise within the heart—this is the arrival of true *qi*.

Then swallow saliva fifty times, knock the teeth nine times, and raise the right hand’s second finger to press the heart. Softly recite the invocation:

*"Supreme Purple Perfection, numinous center of the Nine *Qi*,
Encompassing ten thousand measures, the jade pivot shines resplendent,
Flying auroras stream with radiance, illuminating the Jade Clarity,
Mystic canopy of the host of stars, Yin and Yang divide and complete,
The Four Harmonies descend in union, the Seven Wefts follow in order,
At this month’s auspicious dawn, come to illuminate the heart’s court,
Flowing light and falling splendor fill the Middle Prime,
The Six Palaces open their gates, flowering fluids level and still,
Soul and spirit are refined and tempered, attaining the essence of truth,
Resonance arises at the touch, a hundred transformations instantly manifest,
Suddenly behold the great spirit, seated peacefully in the heart’s chamber,
Refining *qi* to face the ford, a hundred joints flow in harmony,
Grasping the Dipper and holding the bowl, gazing afar in all directions,
Named ‘Jade Pivot,’ styled ‘Pure Prosperity,’
Green plumes draped in splendor, dragon-sash and tiger-skirt,
Body born of jeweled radiance, neck bearing a halo,
Head crowned with flying dawn, the diadem rising and falling,
Enabling me to ascend as an immortal, soaring through the great void,
Rising to the Purple Palace, facing north to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,
Commanding the myriad spirits, the host of numina in welcome,
A flower blooms above the heart, auspicious clouds endure forever,
Phoenixes cry with cool clarity, simurghs sound with resonant chimes."*

Upon completing the invocation, swallow the saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Repeat the invocation as before, then rise and bow twice toward the south—thus concludes the rite. Only then open the eyes.

On the fifteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third days of the month, at the hour of *yu-zhong* or midnight, enter the chamber, sit upright, and clasp the hands. Calm the *qi* and close the eyes. Then visualize the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper descending and entering the *Lower Prime Palace*, three inches within the navel. Hold the Dipper’s handle upright, its bowl facing the heart, the *Kui* star turned outward.

After a long while, suddenly behold within the *Kui* a great spirit, clad and named as described in the invocation. You may also feel warmth within the navel—this is the arrival of true *qi*. Then swallow the saliva sixty times and click the teeth nine times. Raise the left hand’s third finger to press the *ren-zhong* point beneath the nose, and softly intone the invocation:

*"Supreme Purple Emperor,
Radiant and luminous at the central pivot,
Nine jades gleam resplendent, their light outshining the great rosy clouds.
The myriad spirits gaze in reverence; a thousand dawns take root.
Sevenfold brilliance illumines; ninefold mists bloom in fragrance.
You govern the yang to manifest compliance, grasp the yin to harmonize.
True splendor unfurls its array; the dark root gathers all.
At the moon’s first dawning, most auspicious,
Behold the reflection within the navel:
Purple *qi* ascends to the heavens, flying radiance plunges and soars.
Refine my hun and po; efflorescent essence coils in luxuriance.
Suddenly behold the great spirit,
Noble and numinous in the Upper Palace,
Named ‘Zhu Meng,’ styled ‘Flowing Luxuriance.’
Seated upright within the navel,
Riding the ninefold *qi* of the Dipper,
Exhaling and inhaling cloud-essence,
Balancing the blood and ordering the stomach.
Clad in yellow phoenix-feather robes,
Dragon-sash and tiger-belt,
Hands unfolding the solar root,
Head crowned with a green talisman,
Waist ablaze with flowing fire,
Lightning’s glow illuminating the boundless—
Enabling me to ascend as an immortal,
Soaring through the void,
Rising to the Jade Chamber,
Bearing the empyrean’s vastness,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
In shared repose with heaven and earth."*

Upon completing the invocation, swallow the saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Repeat the invocation as before, then rise and bow twice toward your natal direction. After bowing, open the eyes—thus concludes the *Way of the Lower Prime*.

Whenever the hand is raised to press a point, it is but the prelude to the invocation. Upon finishing, return the hands to their original clasped position.

On the eight solar terms, at midnight, enter the chamber, sit upright, and clasp the hands. Calm the *qi*, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the body slowly ascending, flying into the *Kui* of the Northern Dipper. After a long while, you may feel as though your form already dwells within the Dipper. With utmost concentration, you may sense heat within the body—this is the union of true *qi* and virtue.

Then visualize the names, attire, and colors of the Three Great Spirits of the Nine Essences, their appearance like that of newborn infants. The three spirits sit facing you; bow to them in your heart. The vision should be faint and indistinct, leaving the form ethereal and remote, inducing a state of profound absorption.

Swallow the saliva eighty times and click the teeth nine times. Raise the left hand to rest upon the heart, then solemnly intone the invocation:

*"Supreme Cinnabar Spirit,
Mysterious light shimmering and radiant,
Nine jades unfurl their splendor; luminous *qi* scatters in clarity.
The purple dawn illumines the hidden; the Seven Luminaries gather in brilliance.
The Two Effulgences proclaim their brightness; yin and yang are sundered.
Fourfold potency flourishes; cloud-essence flows in reflux.
At the eight solar terms, *qi* arises; ascending through the Nine Origins,
Grasping the Dipper and seizing the Net,
I present myself before the Three Spirits.
They question my delay:
‘Why not ascend as an immortal?’
I bow my head in reverence,
Fearful of the demons of old.
The Emperor blazes forth,
Mouth holding the solar root,
Shattering the Six Heavens to the left,
Crushing Mount Deng to the right.
Flowing bells blaze above;
Ten thousand demons shatter and scatter.
Thus harmonizing my po,
Strengthening my three hun,
Hiding the Dipper’s inner radiance,
The Nine Essences dwelling in the heart.
Purple auroras suffuse the depths;
Flying light spans ten thousand fathoms.
Harmonizing the hun and refining the po,
The six viscera are cleansed and tempered.
Essence stirs in transformation; leaping in response,
Suddenly the Jade Consort appears,
Seated within my heart,
Gazing down and looking up.
Named ‘Secret Florescence,’ styled ‘Neighboring Verdancy,’
Exhaling and inhaling vermilion *qi*,
Pacifying the hundred channels.
Clad in brocade robes,
Phoenix-light and simurgh-skirt,
Tiger-script belt,
Dragon-patterned jade script,
Hands holding moon-florescence,
Crowned with the solar diadem,
Leaping through the great empyrean,
Riding the cloud-canopy of light.
Inscribed in the *Great Simplicity*,
I attain flight as an immortal,
Soaring through the void in unison,
Mounting the jade of the Great Origin,
Rising to the Vermilion Chamber,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
Balancing the Two Measures,
Restoring the countenance of infancy.
The Northern Emperor hurls lightning;
The Southern Emperor arrays fire.
The Eastern Granary kindles its torch;
Thunder resounds in majesty.
The Western Flow doubles its strikes;
Resonant tones chant in harmony.
Fourfold ascent and leaping—
I am presented to the Jade Perfected.
Then riding the Eight Effulgences,
I roam and feast amidst the Nine Mists."*

Upon completing the invocation, swallow the saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Repeat the invocation as before, then rise and bow twice toward the northwest. After bowing, open the eyes—thus concludes the *True Rite of the Eight Solar Terms*.

This Way is the secret marvel of transcending the void, the wondrous method of the Nine Perfected. Practiced in three stages, nine days each month—hence it is called the *Nine Perfected Ascending the Mysterious Text*. This is a treasured scripture among the *Forbidden Books of the Supreme*, the essential formula of the Perfected.

When transmitting this to a worthy recipient, the receiver should observe a pure fast for one hundred days, or thirty days, or ten days, as circumstances permit. Additionally, one should first announce a fast for a day to purify the heart. The transmitter should also fast, as does the receiver.

On the day of transmission, first exchange blood pledges upon the altar, cut hair, and swear an oath of secrecy. Later sages, deeming blood pledges harmful to the vitality of living beings and hair-cutting a violation of bodily integrity, substituted two *yi* of gold as the token of blood-oath and thirty-two feet of green silk as the pledge of hair-cutting.

The master and disciple must not dissipate these oath-objects for private gain or misuse them. They should be bestowed upon mountain-dwelling recluses, solitary and impoverished Daoists. If ascending in transcendence or traversing the void, they may be placed in mountain chambers or scattered among cloud-capped cliffs.

This is done to demonstrate the solemnity of celestial vows and the preciousness of binding oaths, while honoring the purity of the Dao and cherishing the nurturance of life. Those who violate these precepts will cause their seven generations of ancestors to suffer the *Wind-Knife Tribulations of the Dark Capital*, while their own souls become lowly ghosts.

The transmission period and the method of bestowal shall follow the above procedures. These must be observed with utmost care, and the oath-objects should all be of the finest quality. The heart must be reverent and composed, sincere and unwavering, with nothing left unfulfilled. The receiver of the scripture is the lineage-holder; the bestower is the scripture-master. To hear the Dao is to look up to its model and standard; to seek life is to dwell near the land of vitality. Those who fail to uphold these precepts, who neglect or slight them with disrespect, shall cause their three generations of ancestors to suffer punishment in the Fire Bureau, while their own bodies will be afflicted with karmic illness.

The Yellow Emperor took the Mountain Elder as his teacher. The Elder knew only the method of refining stones and possessed no other wondrous arts—how could he be wiser than Jinyun? The Yellow Emperor once inquired about the Way of refining stones, and thus became his disciple. The Elder of Mount Jing is a descendant of Prince You of Ji and now resides on Mount Weiyu. He can refine stone into water, boil water into jade, and grind jade into powder to be consumed with stone-water. Those who master this Way will endure as long as Heaven, yet they cannot soar through the void or grasp the morning mist in their hands. Though the art of refining stones is marvelous, it remains but a minor technique.

Here ends *The Supreme Flying Feather Scripture: Record of the Nine Perfected Ascending to the Mysterious*, its Way complete. The sixth fascicle below is *The Supreme Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Central Mystery*. Though the text contains upper and lower prefaces and oral instructions, its methods and applications differ and do not interfere with one another. The Central Yellow Venerable Lord transmitted it to the Perfected of Great Emptiness, alongside the *Eight Secret Sayings of the Dao*. *The Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Central Mystery* is practiced among humans and also contains oral instructions, though the original text is too sacred to be written. Now, let it be spoken:

**First Perfected Method**: Perform it five times in a month—on the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days—all at dawn.
**Second Perfected Method**: Perform it six times in a month—on the eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-seventh days—all at the hour of *chen*.
**Third Perfected Method**: Perform it six times in a month—on the sixth, seventh, seventeenth, eighteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth days—all at the hour of *si*.
**Fourth Perfected Method**: Perform it six times in a month—on the second, eighth, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-eighth days of the first month—all at noon.
**Fifth Perfected Method**: Perform it five times in a month—on the third, eighth, thirteenth, twentieth, and twenty-sixth days of the third month—all at the hour of *wei*.
**Sixth Perfected Method**: Perform it seven times in a month—on the seventh, eleventh, fourteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, and twenty-eighth days of the seventh month—all at the hour of *shen*.
**Seventh Perfected Method**: Perform it eight times in a month—on the second, sixth, ninth, thirteenth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-seventh days of the eleventh month—all at the hour of *shen* or *you*.
**Eighth Perfected Method**: Perform it seven times in a month—on the second, seventh, ninth, fifteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the second month—all at the hour of *xu* or *hai*.
**Ninth Perfected Method**: Perform it six times in a month—on the third, ninth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, and twenty-ninth days of the twelfth month—all at midnight.

Here end the oral instructions of *The Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Central Mystery*. These days and months are times of harmonizing with the Perfected and aligning with the flow of *qi*, when the essence of life is gathered. It is most auspicious for visualization and easily invokes profound resonance. If one dwells in lofty seclusion, far from worldly affairs, severs all inner and outer distractions, and purifies the body by abstaining from grains, joining hands and rectifying the heart in accord with the morning’s essence, one should practice daily as prescribed in the scripture. What is written here accounts for the busyness of worldly life, where daily tranquility is unattainable. Practicing for fourteen years, one will transcend the floating void, master life and death, emerge from water and enter fire, ascend to the Supreme Clarity, and cause the five viscera to blossom, becoming as enduring as Heaven.

As for the upper fascicle of *The Supreme Flying Feather Scripture*, practicing its three methods nine times in a month is also for those in the world who have not yet attained perfect stillness. If one maintains long-term purity, lives in solitude, gazes upon the empty vastness, and keeps the heart free from worldly affairs, one should practice on these days in sequence. Nine practices in a month are for those still in the world. During the eight solar terms, when the Dipper is in ascendance, visualize the Jade Consort of the Dipper sitting before you. The Jade Consort, seated in purple mist, enters your heart. After a long while, her robes will resemble those invoked during the eight solar terms. This woman is the yin spirit of the Nine Essences, the Supreme Consort of Jade Clarity. These are the oral instructions of the Azure Lad.
