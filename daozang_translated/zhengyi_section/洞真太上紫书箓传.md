*The Transmission of the Purple Script Register of the Supreme Cavern-Realms*

The text was first transmitted to Master Wen, who bore it upon his person as the Great Perfected One. It is also titled *The Supreme Scripture of the Five Hidden, Six Wondrous, Three-Nine Orthodox Unity, and Secret Teachings*.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Cavern-Realms, the Most High Perfected and Great Sage of the Mysterious and Divine, the Beginningless Heavenly Worthy, assembled with the Five Venerable Lords, the Ten Directions’ Hosts of Attained Immortals, and countless perfected transcendents in the midst of the Azure Heaven of the Northeast, upon the Jade Capital Mountain of the Great Floating Li Realm. There stood the Seven-Treasured Jade Grove and the Palace of Luminous Purity, where celestial music unfolded in arrays, incense and blossoms scattered in profusion, and divine creatures of wondrous rarity—birds and beasts of colossal strangeness—gathered in grand display, beyond all description. The Heavenly Worthy smiled radiantly, and all rejoiced in unison.

Thereupon, the Most High Dao Lord, riding the Wheel of Spontaneous Treasure and attended by boundless perfected sages, jade lads, and immortal maidens beyond reckoning, departed from the Mysterious Capital to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy. After the rites were completed, he addressed the assembly, saying:

The Heavenly Worthy smiled in delight, and the vast multitude rejoiced, though none yet understood the reason for this divine favor. The Heavenly Worthy then commanded that seats be taken, and they discoursed upon the pure and wondrous, their words and laughter filled with joy. All chanted in unison, extolling the rarity of this occasion, yet none dared to inquire directly.

At that moment, the Primordial Heavenly King rose from his seat, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "The Most High Dao Lord has accumulated merit and virtue through countless kalpas, bringing about this towering and divine assembly today—a joy so rare its depths cannot be fathomed. His compassion extends to the myriad beings, yet he often wishes to speak but finds none to address, to teach but none capable of receiving. On this day of great celebration, we long to hear the essential words. Dare we ask: what Dao can broadly deliver all? What method can ensure enduring joy?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! A grand question indeed. I possess a wondrous Dao, boundless and inexhaustible, its profound and obscure true essence beyond all speech. Its depth and mystery are already roughly known to you. Today, I shall reveal the *Five Hidden, Six Wondrous, Three-Nine Orthodox Unity, and Secret Teachings*, bestowing them upon the Most High Dao Lord. You may together illuminate them, delivering and guiding all beings to attain the Dao of eternal abiding and perpetual joy."

Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Most High Dao Lord, and the boundless host of perfected sages and great assembly rejoiced, received the command with reverence, and departed after making obeisance.

The Most High Dao Lord and the Primordial Heavenly King returned together to the Palace of Great Possession, where they roamed and feasted in the Pavilion of Wondrous Courts. Purple clouds congealed, seven treasures surged forth, and crimson mists unfurled upon the terraces. A profusion of blossoms gleamed resplendently, their radiance illuminating the Jade Void and penetrating all heavens. Fragrance suffused the ten directions, resplendent and luminous, beyond all description.

Then they gathered the boundless numinous spirits, the perfected and great deities, the hosts of immortals and sages. They plucked the cloud zithers and played the celestial chimes, while lions danced and white unicorns frolicked. White cranes swayed in graceful motion, and vermilion phoenixes soared aloft. The eight tones rang clear, the nine hues gleamed brilliantly. Flutes, pipes, bells, and drums resounded in myriad forms, with countless arts and a hundred million sounds and appearances. Songs of pure wonder were sung, and whether heavenly spirits, humans, ghosts, or even the subtlest creeping things, all were moved and enraptured, none failing to rejoice.

At that time, a great deity who had attained the Dao, known as the Queen Mother of the White Jade, arrived in a nine-canopied floral chariot. Perfected ones attended her as guards, cloud-dragons flanked her as escorts, immortal lads arrayed before her, and jade maidens lined behind. Canopies and blossoms adorned her left, banners and incense her right. Dancers performed, and music played as she respectfully approached the Dao Lord, bowing her head in reverence and inquiring:

"I have heard that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy instructed the Primordial Heavenly King, saying he would reveal the Six Wondrous Secret Teachings to bestow upon the Dao Lord. Dare I ask whether these teachings may be heard?"

The Dao Lord replied: "The Heavenly Worthy’s secret teachings are the secret practices of a hundred million kalpas, rarely encountered even by the truly worthy. Thus, they are not proclaimed openly. Yet since you now inquire, desiring to behold them, you must ask the Beginningless Heavenly King."

Thereupon, the Queen Mother descended from her seat, prostrated herself upon the ground, and with her forehead touching the earth, entreated the King: "The Heavenly Worthy’s secret teachings have been entrusted to the Most High. I bow in reverence and humbly request to hear them. I pray you deign to reveal them."

The King replied: "These teachings are profoundly subtle, beyond all conception. Only those of pure resolve can intuitively grasp them. The oral transmission from the utmost perfected ones is the essential key, yet its traces are scattered and elusive. Those who encounter it in the dust of kalpas attain long life, communion with the divine, union with the Dao, and boundless transformation, abiding in perpetual joy. Those who do not encounter it wander in the cycles of suffering—truly lamentable.

Since your compassion extends to all beings and your aspiration is to broadly deliver them, your merit and virtue align with the Heavenly Worthy’s intent. How could you not contemplate practicing these secret teachings? Return to your seat, and I shall roughly expound them. Your divine wisdom will surely illuminate their depths."

"I once heard the Heavenly Worthy address the Dao Lord, saying: 'It is neither heaven nor earth, neither yin nor yang, neither sun nor moon, neither soft nor hard, neither non-being nor being. Subtle and hidden, it must not be proclaimed—this is the essence of the wondrous teachings. Do you, Mother, comprehend this?'"

The Queen Mother bowed her head in deep contemplation for a long while, then looked up and replied: "Neither heaven nor earth—does this refer to the supreme undifferentiated unity? Neither yin nor yang—does this refer to the mysterious communication of the central palace? Neither sun nor moon—does this refer to the two halves becoming one? Neither soft nor hard—does this refer to the convergence of mountains and rivers? Neither being nor non-being—does this refer to the ultimate transformations of the five and nine, boundless and inexhaustible? Subtle and hidden, it must not be proclaimed—does this mean one must cultivate in silence and caution, never transmitting it recklessly?"

The King said: "It is so. You have understood it well. The Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion encompasses all beings. How could he begrudge these secret teachings and refuse to transmit them? Yet most people are shallow and insincere, failing to comprehend the ultimate principle. Their karmic obstructions run deep, and they doubt the true and correct. If they were to hear these subtle mysteries, they might slander and disparage them, treating them with disdain and disbelief, thereby falling into evil destinies where they would suffer the torments of wind and blades for kalpas without end."

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by boundless compassion, takes pity without end, and so conceals these wondrous teachings to await the coming of true worthies. The Way of true worthies is rare, seldom heard of across ages, yet the multitudes cannot be left without instruction. Thus, he broadly expounds secondary causes to rescue the drifting, establishing rituals, precepts, prohibitions, and disciplines, crafting various analogies as the times demand, branching and weaving doctrines too numerous to record in full. It is hoped that through these coarse teachings, one may gradually enter the subtle and ultimately encounter this secret principle. This secret principle is the root of all truths, and so the Five Elder Thearchs, the thirty-two heavens, and the myriad hosts of sages all revere it as their foundation. In times of wordless silence, this Dao abides in concealment; when words arise, this principle stands foremost, lofty and unmatched. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy holds it in highest esteem, and sages and worthies treasure and guard it as their sole secret. Though other scriptures are weighty, they all follow in its wake.

Only after kalpas of diligent study, unwavering in arduous refinement, with merit and virtue turning like a wheel, may one naturally encounter it. Yet if one is not destined to attain the Dao, they will never meet it; nor can one who has not attained the Dao and become a perfected being discern who is worthy of transmission.

Now, the Queen Mother embodies the Dao and harmonizes with the divine, her luminous insight penetrating all, examining the presence and absence of things, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature. She illumines all beings, great and small, discerning them completely. Only then does she rescue and deliver all, distinguishing the true from the false, rewarding good and admonishing evil, liberating the boundless. When this secret principle is understood, the merit and virtue are vast—majestic and towering, beyond words.

Yet this principle is the ultimate teaching expounded by the Heavenly Worthy, encompassing the origins of all wonders. All teachings of nurturance and instruction take this as their foundation. It may be clearly transmitted to virtuous and noble adepts, but must never be shown to those of middling or lesser capacity.

The Queen Mother spoke: "I have received the Heavenly Worthy’s secret teachings, the six perfections and the four boundless practices, which endure for kalpas without end. Even if I were to speak exhaustively in gratitude, how could it repay such grace? I shall devote my heart in silent reverence, obeying only your command."

The King said: "Excellent! May you follow it without end."

At that time, the Queen Mother addressed the Dao Lord: "Through kalpas of karmic affinity, I have encountered this secret principle, and now use it to transform and deliver all beings, bringing immeasurable blessings. Yet I sigh that true worthies are so rare.

From this day forward, if a noble adept of great aspiration, deeply devoted to this Dao, surrenders wealth and body, entrusting their life to seek this secret teaching—regardless of number or duration of kalpas—should they meet an auspicious dawn in purity, may they be transmitted this teaching? Is this permissible?"

The Dao Lord replied: "This is no trifling matter, no trifling matter. Carefully select those who align with your heart, and only then may it be transmitted as you have said. The principle must not be forgotten, nor the words silenced. Be earnest in your admonitions, swear to utmost secrecy, cultivate in silent reverence, and through numerological resonance and karmic conditions, attain the perfection of the Dao."

The Queen Mother bowed her head, received the command, and returned to the Jade Tower on Tortoise Mountain, entering the Azure Forest Palace. Within its vermilion and purple chambers, beneath pearl-encrusted canopies, jade maidens and immortal youths, along with hosts of divine musicians and attendants, surrounded her in profound purity.

At that time, the Perfected Youth of Great Harmony and the Jade Maiden of Supreme Mystery, awaiting her tranquil repose, composed their bodies and minds, purifying themselves for days on end. Together they pledged an oath, exhausting all within and without, offering their entire wealth to prepare three halls of seven treasures, five sets of jade couches, golden screens, pearl canopies, and jeweled canopies, nine vessels of divine incense, ten banners of finest silk, a boy and girl attendant each, a dragon carriage of gold and jade, a thousand days’ supply of rare delicacies, a thousand bolts each of brocade and silk, ten thousand catties each of purple and yellow gold. Bearing these upon jade platters, they presented them before the Queen Mother, prostrating themselves and bowing their heads to the ground.

They spoke: "Through dust-laden kalpas of fortune, we have been honored to attend you. Our joy and gratitude are boundless. Yet our later studies are shallow, and the great Dao remains unachieved. Though our offerings are meager, our devotion grows ever deeper. For what we have not yet attained, we beg your compassion and forgiveness. Today, we have poured out our hearts and exhausted our wills, offering all we possess—nothing remains beyond ourselves. Our bodies lie prostrate upon the earth, entrusted to your supreme honor. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives entirely to you. We beseech you to reveal the wondrous mysteries of the undifferentiated five and nine."

The Queen Mother remained silent for a long while, pondering deeply, sighing repeatedly, yet did not respond to their plea. Then the Perfected Youth and Jade Maiden, their sincerity unwavering, prostrated themselves fully, knocking their heads upon the ground without cease, until marrow, brain, tears, and blood flowed together, and their breath faded upon the earth.

After a long time, the Queen Mother composed herself and spoke with solemnity, commanding the Left Immortal and Right Perfected to raise them up. The two perfected beings revived, and the Mother bestowed upon each a measure of jade nectar. After drinking, their divine bodies were restored as before.

Then the Mother addressed them: "You are capable of practicing the Three Wonders and surely can cultivate the Six Subtleties. Moreover, through kalpas of accumulated virtue, you have attained the reward of true immortality. Now, your diligence has reached such heights that you shall achieve the supreme Dao. I shall transmit the secret teachings of the Primordial Honored One to you. The precepts of secrecy you have long understood—words may be forgotten, but I shall not repeat them needlessly."

The two perfected beings, overcome with boundless joy, bowed repeatedly in gratitude, swearing to uphold the teachings with all their hearts.

The Mother instructed them: "When transmitting this secret teaching, you must hold a grand purification feast, summoning the assembled divine beings, informing the hosts of sages, making offerings to the perfected, and extending blessings without limit. Since you have surrendered all possessions and entrusted yourselves to the mysterious void, I shall now petition on your behalf the Boundless Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Five Elder Thearchs, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Great Emperor of Fusang in the August Heaven, the Nine Perfected Kings, the Ten Directions’ Immortal Lords, the hosts of the Five Nets, the spirits of the Three Realms, the infinite numina, and all the orthodox deities—to witness and praise your virtue. Is this acceptable?"

The two Perfected, trembling with reverence, addressed her: "We dare not presume—only humbly receive your merciful decree."

Thereupon, the Queen Mother commanded the immortal youths of her left guard to array the cloud-borne chariot, while the jade maidens of her right retinue prepared the wind-borne palanquin. She dispatched the Flying Phoenix Envoys and the courier officers of the dragon steeds to proclaim the summons far and wide. Thus, on the first day of the first month of the fifth year of the Supreme August Era, a grand assembly convened within the Jade Tower’s Crimson Palace and Purple Hall. The Purple Pole Immortal Youths and the Cinnabar Jade Maidens, together with the Yellow Youths of the Central Palace and the immortal officers of the sacred peaks, opened the jeweled gates, swept the portals and windows, and adorned the countless chambers and boundless halls. Terraces, altars, steps, beams, pillars, and columns—all were linked by soaring eaves and connecting walkways, naturally sheltered beneath canopies of seven treasures, radiant without the slightest shadow. Within and without, purity shone through endlessly. Their beds, screens, and curtains were all fashioned of pearls and jade, coral and amber, giant clams and agate, lapis lazuli and crystal, adorned with myriad embellishments. Banners, flowers, incense, and perfumes filled the air, while music and performances awaited description.

On the day of the feast, at dawn’s audience, the sacred hosts of all directions gathered as one. Then the Heavenly Worthy manifested in golden splendor, his neck adorned with a halo of radiance, clad in embroidered robes and crowned with a diadem. He rode upon a jade wheel soaring through the void, sheltered beneath a canopy of cloud-piercing treasure. The perfected ones led the procession, accompanied by attendants bearing incense and flowers, musicians, and an escort too vast to describe. Thereupon, the Supreme Lord guided the Heavenly Kings and Thearchs, along with the Queen Mother and her sacred assembly, to circumambulate thrice in praise. After prostrating in reverence and completing the rites, they returned to their seats in order. Each inquired, and the Heavenly Worthy answered all, resolving every doubt.

At midday, the Queen Mother set forth a banquet. The food and drink, delicacies and fruits, were of boundless rarity and perfection—fragrant, sweet, and exquisite in myriad forms beyond description. Seven-jeweled tables filled the hall naturally, and all present partook together. Only the rice varied in hue according to each one’s virtue and power, its colors shifting in gradations too subtle to fathom.

After the meal, when all was cleansed, they circled the Boundless Heavenly Worthy, discoursing on the subtle and the coarse, distinguishing being and non-being. Each rejoiced, their understanding complete. They chanted wondrous hymns, danced to celestial music, and all exulted, their praises resounding in unbroken succession.

Only the two Perfected prostrated themselves and dared to speak. The Queen Mother knelt and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "These two have accumulated merit over kalpas, their virtue and power converging to forge a bond with the Dao. They have long surrendered themselves, advancing without retreat. Overwhelmed by what they have witnessed, they now seek fulfillment. I venture to petition the Heavenly Worthy—joy and trepidation intertwine. Unaware of the causes of kalpas past, they find their fruition today. Your presence has descended, and the assembly rejoices.

The Six Wondrous Secret Teachings are the pinnacle of the Great Dao. As these two are about to attain perfection, I request that they be entrusted with them. Yet I dare not act without your decree."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "These disciples have cultivated diligently—they are indeed fit for attainment. Those who should attain shall attain; those who should be delivered shall be delivered. This matter is fully within the purview of the Dao Lord. Inform the Dao Lord, announce it to the assembly, and together witness the transmission. No further words are needed from me."

The Queen Mother bowed in acceptance and immediately addressed the Dao Lord, proclaiming to the assembly: "Today, the secret teachings are to be transmitted to these two Perfected. May the sacred hosts of the Great Dao all bear witness, recognizing their merit and virtue, for they shall attain the Dao this very day."

The Supreme Lord replied: "Excellent, excellent!" All present chanted in unison: "How wonderful!"

Thereupon, the Queen Mother imparted to them the *Jade Girdle Oral Formula of the Supreme Blended Perfection* and the *Three Radiant Oral Formula of the Mysterious Passage of the Central Palace*—these two formulas govern the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Cavern of Perfection*. She then taught the *Unified Thought of the Two Halves Oral Formula* and the *Mountains, Rivers, Humans, and Birds Convergence Oral Formula*—these two govern the *Ten Sections of the Cavern of Mystery*. Finally, she transmitted the *Oral Formula of the Five-Nine Ultimate Origin*—this governs the *Great Character of the Cavern of Divinity* and the *Five Thousand-Word Scripture*.

The Queen Mother further instructed the two Perfected: "The Dao Lord declares these to be the secret teachings of the Supreme Clarity High Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin. From the True One arises the Mysterious Two; from the Mysterious Two arises the Spirit Three; the Spirit Three embraces the Supreme Five; the Supreme Five contains the Three Ways, which together form the Six Wonders. The true principles number five, the five depend on the three, the three culminate in the nine, and the nine, through transformation, return to the One. The Orthodox Unity, the Supreme Dao, finds its ultimate realization here. Those who grasp this teaching shall surely attain the true Dao.

The supreme Way is not complex—a single phrase can suffice for attainment. Though the paths to realization are many, varying with each person’s encounter, even after myriad kalpas, they do not exceed these five. A thousand arts and a hundred ways must return to these six. Even after countless kalpas of devotion to the true Dao, without encountering this teaching, one cannot become a Supreme Orthodox Perfected. Only when kalpas of merit and virtue near perfection, and one encounters this teaching, may it be transmitted—as with you today.

The Mysterious Origin is fundamentally One. When it takes form, it becomes Two. To unite the Two and return to the One, the key lies in guarding the true fluidity. The true fluidity is the original One of the Mysterious Origin. Uniting the Two to preserve the One is the way to commune with the spirit. When spirit, talisman, and mystery align, the Five Constants become inexhaustible. To commune with the spirit and enact transformation is to embrace the Three. The Three united form virtue, the work of returning to the One, containing the rites of the Six Wonders and the transformations of the Nine Ultimates. The spirit’s transformations are boundless—thus the Way of the Supreme Perfected is attained.

To thoroughly comprehend this teaching, one must diligently preserve the true fluidity, for the true fluidity is as difficult to retain as wind passing through a window, like a feathered carriage entering a fiery desert, or a rotting rope guiding a galloping horse. To master it, employ the superior method of numerical control, the middle way of natural preservation, and the inferior method of harmonious recording.

Those who do not know the marvel of the Three Principles are not people of the Dao. The people of the Dao revere these Three Marvels, and thus their merit and virtue become vast, their deliverance boundless."

The governance of the One arises from the Two, completing the Three and employing the Five. It cycles through the Six and concludes the Nine, encompassing the Two and Four, traversing the Seven and Eight—these are the numbers of nature, wheeling endlessly without limit. The Three can complete the Five, the Six can cycle through the Nine; when completion is achieved, it unites with the True; when the cycle is fulfilled, it merges with the Dao.

Yet to know the ultimate of the Three Marvels and comprehend the rites of the Six Wonders, one must attain the True in this very life—this is not a matter for future rebirths to ascend the Dao. The Two Perfected Ones said: "We have long heard these teachings. If one knows the Three Marvels and Six Wonders, what need is there for anything else? To know the One is to complete all things." They often regarded the secret of the Three Ones and the mysteries of the Six Jia as sufficient—were they not correct?

The Mother replied: "The Elixir of Cinnabar and the Art of Concealment are but branches; this teaching is the root. Root and branch are profoundly mysterious, mystery upon mystery—though root and branch depend on each other, the refined and the coarse are clearly distinguishable." The Two Perfected Ones said: "We humbly beseech your compassion and beg to fathom this secret teaching."

Then the Queen Mother opened her mouth and exhaled, delivering it into the hands of the Two Perfected Ones. The written script was the natural true qi, coalescing into characters, their luster like green jade, limpid and radiant, illuminating the Purple Void. The text read:

"In the cycle of Jiazi, on the day of Opening and Removing, at the hour of Generative Qi, when the body’s spirits are harmonized and attuned—regardless of age, the essence lies in sincerity. The yang resides in the Nine, the yin begins with the Seven. When qi harmonizes and the heart communicates, they resolve as one. Strike the drum seven times and recite the secret incantation: *Special Formula.* This is the method of numerical control.

*Serene and gentle, two, three, nine,
A thousand thousands, hundreds of hundreds—abundance brings longevity.
Regardless of season, the key is balanced harmony;
Refining qi and flying the elixir must commune with the spirits.
Special Formula.*
This is the way of natural preservation.

*Gather substances to meet qi and foster life,
Though forms differ, their origin is one.
What cannot be conceived is called the numinous;
If revered and united, the Dao is naturally achieved.
Special Formula.*
This is the method of harmonious recording."

The Mother said: "Diligently practice these Three, and when the Five and Six are mastered, the attainment of the True will have its time—no more than sixty-three years. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as supreme; how could it require material things? Those who study the Dao to its depths, who are about to merge with the Dao, must abandon all that is substantial, returning to emptiness with an open and vast heart. Extending to body and mind, they become utterly still and serene, empty as emptiness itself—thus they unite with the True Dao.

You have now relinquished these many treasures, remaining silent and without attachment—this is the proof of attaining the True and the sign of accomplishing the Dao. Those who have not yet reached this state still await their time. Since the Dao does not require your possessions, they may be bestowed upon those who await, allowing each to find their place and fulfill their highest aspirations." The Two Perfected Ones then obeyed the command, dispersing the treasures universally.

Those who received this grace clasped their hands in reverence and praised, saying: "Excellent indeed, O Two Perfected Ones! Your merit and virtue are truly rare. Towering, you ascend the Dao’s sanctuary; your compassionate virtue flows eternally. All directions look up in admiration. May the Heavenly Worthy accomplish this! May we in the future attain the same aspiration."

The Two Perfected Ones replied: "You must diligently seek a master, wholeheartedly extend your compassion, establish vast fields of merit, and perpetually cultivate purity and fasting. Secretly and carefully practice without ceasing, never allowing the precepts to lapse. Earnestly deliver all beings; let your benevolence flow universally. When your virtue and Dao are lofty and luminous, you will naturally know your past wisdom. The Primordial Worthy will take pity and protect you, and you will surely encounter this secret teaching. Those who attain it will certainly achieve the True; once the True is achieved, it is indestructible. In life and death, you will forever follow your will, moving with the transformations of the times, merging with the primordial chaos and the Void. Profoundly uniting with the mysterious rhythm, you will enjoy eternal bliss without end. This Dao cannot be spoken of—only sought with utmost sincerity. Do not let this rare opportunity slip away. We now earnestly exhort you with this teaching, for if you become lax and complacent, you will drift and suffer bitter demise. The wondrous truth is not distant—strive with all your might!"

At this, the great assembly as one voice responded solemnly, chanting, "Excellent indeed!" They all bowed to the Heavenly Worthy and departed.

The Perfected Youth said: "My surname is Zhou, my given name Lingji, and my style Daotong. The Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery is surnamed Ji, named Yuxuan, and styled Mingzan. Together, we have come from the midst of the Primordial Beginning, passing through countless kalpas, learning the Dao through endless cycles—beyond all reckoning. At times, we have been emperors and kings, lords of nations, dukes, ministers, and chancellors; at others, generals, scholars, masters of Confucianism, state preceptors, and Daoist priests; or empresses, consorts, Perfected Ladies, and tutelary spirits. Through the cycles of life and death, we have always been husband and wife, accumulating blessings and felicity.

In the first year of the Zhu Ling era, we were born in the Land of Floating Radiance within the Azure Heaven, advancing with vigor and reverence, devout and diligent. By the third year of the Chi Ming era, we became Perfected Ones of the Great Treasury, assisting the Dao Lord and aiding the Great Emperor. Our merit and virtue moved the Primordial Worthy; our sincerity and devotion were noted by the Queen Mother.

In the fifth year of the Shang Huang era, we received the secret teaching and the oral transmission from the divine mouth, accomplishing the Supreme Orthodox True Dao. In the ninth year of the Xia Huang era, seeing that Lord Wang was refining his thoughts, yearning for the True Dao, and pursuing the distant and profound, we encountered masters and met friends beyond counting. We delved deeply into subtleties, passing through countless kalpas, traversing mountains and rivers, entering and leaving the world of men. Our hearts embraced the myriad existences, our aspirations lay in universal deliverance. Our hidden virtue flowed widely, our compassion permeated all—thus our resonance ascended above and descended below, and the time for attaining the True arrived.

Now, by the secret command of the Heavenly Worthy, we transmit this teaching in accordance with the formula, bestowing it as if it were our own. We have also charged him to temporarily rest in the Western City, wander the Five Peaks, oversee the Three Realms, and supervise all things. He will select the worthy, administer the precepts, and be titled the Supreme Perfected, assisting the Great Emperor of Fusang and proclaiming the secret teachings of the Primordial Beginning’s wondrous mysteries. From the High Perfected Ones of Shangqing, the Jade Void of Zixu, the Supreme of Taiwu, the Supreme of Taikong, the Supreme of Taiwei, the Supreme of Taiji, the Supreme of Taihe, the Supreme of Taixuan, the Supreme of Taisu, the Supreme of Taiqing, the Supreme of Taiping, to the Perfected Immortals and Divine Sages of the Boundless Heavens—all are entrusted to Lord Wang. Those on earth who delight in the Dao will diligently seek him."
