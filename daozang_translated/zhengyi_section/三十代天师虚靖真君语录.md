# 三十代天师虚靖真君语录

**Preface to the Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility**

Within the cosmos, the qi of radiant mountains and numinous peaks is concentrated in humanity alone. Yet when humans cultivate the self, what is inwardly contained must manifest outwardly. How could one whose essence is so profoundly stored refrain from giving it voice? Though the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi advocate the abandonment of the body, the rejection of sensory brilliance, and the absolute renunciation of all that ensnares one externally—striving instead to return wholly within—even the Dao of transmitting teachings to the world and establishing guidance must rely upon words to be conveyed and made manifest.

From this, we may observe: those who wander beyond the mundane—do they truly regard words as entirely without use? For them, words are like clouds drifting through the vast sky or the faintest ripples upon a limpid abyss, forming patterns with their movement and stillness, yet leaving no trace to be discerned. This differs from the words of the Confucians: when flourishing, their speech is bold and unrestrained, their emotions unbridled; when in adversity, their words are bound by sorrow, their sentiments filled with lament. Nevertheless, the Dao endures through the ages, its spiritual transformations as eternal as Heaven itself. Must one await the presence or absence of words to deem it supreme?

The Thirtieth-Generation Ancestor, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, possessed innate wisdom and karmic roots, flourishing during the reign of Emperor Huizong, when the court revered the Dao with particular devotion. Between the Chongning and Jingkang eras, the imperial house’s veneration of the Dao was profound, and true immortals emerged in abundance. Among those who ascended and descended in the same era as the Perfected Lord were Xu Shenxi, Wang Wenqing, and Lin Lingsu. In exorcising malevolent spirits, calming tidal disasters, and verifying divine omens—whether bending cypress branches or summoning auspicious signs—they frequently demonstrated extraordinary efficacy. When the nation’s fortunes waned and hardship arose, the Perfected Lord foresaw calamities and portents, and at the sovereign’s command, could summon wind and thunder, drought and rain. His Dao was divinely manifested and renowned, truly sufficient to adorn the celestial court and bestow blessings upon all beings. Though centuries have passed, people still speak of him with admiration today—how could he be compared to those whose fame flickers briefly before vanishing without a trace?

The *Record of Responses and Transformations* has already documented his meritorious deeds in detail. Yet the Perfected Lord’s teachings for the world, his verses that refine the spirit and awaken the soul, are all capable of rousing the deluded and enlightening the benighted. Had he not wandered in the primordial chaos before the emergence of form, shedding the dust of the world like a cicada molting its shell, utterly free from even the slightest attachment, how could his attainments have reached such heights?

Disciples from all directions recite his words and long to behold them in full, yet regrettably, they have not been preserved in their entirety. Though they were once printed, much has since been lost. Thus, I have gathered them from the famous mountains and re-engraved them upon woodblocks to broaden their transmission. May this enable scholars and seekers to delve beyond the surface of his words, to grasp the secrets of the "fire talisman" and fathom the mysteries of lead and mercury, finding in them an everlasting teacher. Proceeding thus into the realm of the Dao and virtue, one may wander the boundless wilderness, the shores of emptiness, amidst towering peaks and ancient forests on a night when the wind is clear and the moon bright. Chanting his ethereal verses, where the pines echo and the springs respond—who can say that the banners of rainbow clouds and the girdles of rosy mists will not descend? How could such words not be transmitted alongside those of Laozi and Zhuangzi?

I, Yu Chu, unworthy heir to this lineage, am hardly capable of fully extolling his virtues. Yet I fear that some of his teachings may be lost, and so I humbly place this preface at the beginning, awaiting the brush of a master to complete the task.

Written on an auspicious day after the Zhongyuan Festival in the twenty-eighth year of the Hongwu reign (1395), by the Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Inheritor of the Radiant Ancestral Teachings, Leader of the Daoist Religion, and Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master, Successor to the Han Lineage, Yu Chu, who respectfully bows and offers this preface after fasting and purification.

**Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth-Generation Celestial Master, Perfected Lord of Empty Tranquility, Volume One**
Compiled by Yu Chu, Forty-Third-Generation Celestial Master and Successor

**Essays**
**On the Mind**

The mind is the root of all dharmas, the master of the nine apertures, the foundation of life and death, and the source of good and evil. It arises together with Heaven and Earth, serving as the sovereign of spirit and luminosity. Some call it the *Perfected Lord*, for it commands the entire body. Some call it *True Constancy*, for it transcends antiquity and modernity without decay. Some call it *True Suchness*, for it abides in stillness, unmoved. When activated, it pervades the six directions; when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown. Vast beyond measure, the cosmos lies within it, and it shares the same essence as the Great Void. Minute beyond limit, it enters the tip of an autumn hair, yet cannot be sought through form.

This is what we call our fundamental mind, the original self before the empty kalpas. Yet what, truly, is it? Vague and obscure, elusive and indistinct—it cannot be known by intellect, nor grasped by perception. We forcefully name it the *Dao*, forcefully name it *spirit*, forcefully name it *mind*—nothing more. From this, can we not see its greatness? Can we not see its preciousness?

Yet why, though it revolves through the Three Realms, passing in and out of life and death, cannot free itself? For when a single thought stirs within, the six senses flow outward without cease, failing to transcend evil even as it transcends good. Thus arise the retributions of heaven and hell, the karmic consequences, the endless cycles of the Six Paths with no hope of escape. How grievous! How lamentable!

The enlightened, however, are not thus.

Thus, through fasting and abstinence, one illuminates their virtue with spirit—once the One True [qi] settles into clarity, the ten thousand calamities dissolve. Laozi said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; the ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return."* All things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring the mandate; restoring the mandate is called constancy. To know constancy is called clarity; not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly and invites misfortune.

What is called *constancy* is that which transcends past and present without decay. What is called *recklessness* is the moment a single thought arises. Zhuangzi said: *"Once a thing is made, to return again to the root—is this not difficult?"* In the *Yijing*, is this not the way of the *Great Person*?

From this point onward, be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, eliminate defilement and halt thoughts. Still the mind and guard the One; embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action. Withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing; harmonize with radiance and merge with dust. A fleeting thought’s arising is the illness; its non-continuation is the cure. Fear not the arising of thoughts—only the delay in awakening. Like hair that must be combed daily, so too the body and mind—why not tend to them thus? In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, let not a single moment pass without vigilance.

The land of *Nothing-Whatsoever*, the realm of *Huaxu*—there shall I wander.

**Opening the Altar, Initiating the Rite**

Have you not seen the thousand-foot ladder leaning against the steep ridge? Step upon it, and you may reach the summit; place it upon flat ground, and even a low wall becomes insurmountable. The ladder is not insufficient—it is the ground upon which it stands that is amiss. A ship of ten thousand *hu* rests securely upon the great river; with it, one may cross oceans; cast it upon a shallow stream, and even a few paces become impassable. The ship is not incapable—it is the waters that bear it which are unfit.

The scriptures of my lineage—above, they can move heaven and earth; below, they can shake mountains and rivers. In brightness, they command dragons and tigers; in darkness, they subdue ghosts and spirits. In merit, they can revive the decayed; in cultivation, they can transcend life and death. In greatness, they can stabilize nations; in smallness, they can avert disasters. Yet their attainment lies in practice, and their loss lies in negligence. Thus, the craftsman’s tools and measuring line cannot guarantee skill; the master’s model and standard cannot ensure conduct. Yet man’s karmic obstructions—emotional entanglements, demonic hindrances, the snares of fame and profit—accumulate daily without respite.

Born without parents, who is truly kin beyond the body? Each day requires only clothing and food—what use is hoarding? Glory, wealth, and honor are like a candle in the wind; beloved wives and children are like crows roosting on the same branch. Fine carriages and grand steeds cannot accompany you on the long night’s journey; beautiful concubines and radiant wives cannot rescue you from the ninefold darkness. Carved walls and towering halls, white jade and yellow gold—though they may belong to you for a time, they cannot be kept forever.

Vast are the Three Realms, bustling are the Four Forms of Life—once swept away by the passing current, you sink forever in the sea of suffering. Do not wait until the underworld’s emissary arrives to summon your name from the black ledger. By then, regret will be too late.

You have left your homeland and parents to draw near the gates of masters and teachers, shouldering your burden through frost and rain, baring your liver and cleansing your gall to behold the true wind of the Most High. You have pledged faith and submitted your name to receive the celestial master’s secret scriptures. From this day forward, cast off the old and renew yourself daily. Though your name may be recorded in the highest heavens, your body remains entangled in the world’s net. Sever past attachments gradually; let future grievances pass without entanglement. Only then—dissolving conflicts, blunting sharpness, aiding beings, and saving others—nurture tranquility, preserve spirit, and still the mind.

Once the green vine is cut, the fire of the *monkey-mind* must cease; when deluded thoughts do not arise, the *horse-mind* within naturally halts. Know the body as affliction; see life as the true. The yang does not cherish birth; the yin does not conceal death. Thus, the great wind cannot stir you, and the kalpa’s fire cannot burn you. Thoughts extinguished from the Three Corpses, nature untainted by the Five Desires.

The Jasper Terrace and the Park of Paradise become your homeland; the sea of love and mountain of affection are the livelihoods of others. Human life is uncertain—who can guarantee a full span of years? The days and months pass swiftly; to act is already late. If you delay further, you will only grow feeble and despondent. Having fortunately arrived at this treasure mountain, do not return empty-handed.

I humbly pray that the imperial foundation remain ever firm, the sage’s longevity extend without end, the four barbarians lay down their arms, and the ten thousand kingdoms come to pay homage. Once selfless transformation is achieved, then the ten directions, the Three Realms, the Six Paths, the Four Forms of Life, and all sentient beings shall ascend the shore of the Dao.

Now the altar is prepared, and the rite of initiation is at hand. I dare not linger before the disciple. I implore you—take care.

**Reply to the Prefect of Chizhou**

**Reply to Magistrate Ma Xiugen**

I have received your letter, and learned with joy that you have been transferred to Chengdu. Though the journey may have wearied you slightly, your path is now secure and your circumstances settled. The ritual register has been prepared, and I must personally attend to the conferral of the sacred pledge to complete the ceremony. I take this opportunity to convey my sincerest regards; Xiugen, you will soon depart, and I shall send a separate reply.

The thirteenth day of the sixth month,
[Your name] respectfully addresses Prefect Wang.

**Reply to the Prefect of Zhen Ding Prefecture**

It has been long since we last exchanged words, and now I receive your letter with sorrow. Yet I rejoice to hear of your well-being, which has attained perfect harmony. I am delighted to learn that Minister An of your prefecture, who from youth has followed the Dao and devoted himself to Confucian learning, stands as a towering wave in the vast ocean of scholarship and a peerless luminary in the forest of letters. I await the day his great talents are put to use, fulfilling the hopes of all. Should I have the chance to meet him, I would seek his guidance with eagerness.

[Your name] respectfully addresses the Prefect of Zhen Ding Prefecture.

**Reply to Tang Mingquan**

I have long admired your illustrious name, yet our exchange of profound discourse has been hindered. Gazing toward the Dipper in my dreams, I yearn for your presence, but the winds and clouds keep us apart. Though we have not yet met, I am honored to receive your letter, overwhelmed by your sincerity, and unworthy of such kindness.

I trust that Mingquan, a lofty immortal of the Jade Palace and a guest of the Jasper Terrace, has cast aside the shackles of fame and profit to master the pivot of Dao and virtue. You preserve the formless and nurture the spirit, seeking the luminous pearl in the Red Waters. With tranquility, you cultivate your nature, uniting with the supreme principle in the land of Huaxu. You should further aid those in peril, guide the ignorant, fulfill the virtue of the perfected, and manifest the teachings of the Most High. Then, perhaps, we may ride feathered canopies and dragon scales together to visit the realm of Huayang, or join the ranks of cloud banners and rainbow standards in the celestial expanse of the Great Ultimate.

---

**Reply to Prefect Lin**

The methods of practice previously transmitted to you were the oral instructions of a sacred master, and their efficacy depends on diligent cultivation. Though you may not ascend in broad daylight, you will attain an unblemished body, prolong your years in this world, and achieve immortality.

With deepest reverence, I offer my blessings.
[Your name] respectfully addresses Daoist Companion Lin.

**Reply to Lin Lingsu**

The gourd and bamboo hat are indifferent things—what use are clouds and mist? The golden gates and crimson haze may seem like celestial wanderings, yet only white stones and limpid springs preserve the mountain’s true tranquility. Our meeting was but a fleeting convergence of duckweed and driftwood, while each of us finds our own path to freedom. Divided by rivers and mountains, seasons have turned again and again; idle fame grows daily, while my wandering traces remain scattered.

I reflect that the Dao is fundamentally natural, and spirit is nothing apart from it. The bright moon courses through the azure sky, yet its light has no form; white clouds drift over green mountains, yet their hue leaves no trace. The silkworm enters its cocoon and the moth departs; the sparrow plunges into water and the clam is born. Transformation occurs in an instant, cycles follow like echoes—no need to imitate, for rise and fall come naturally to the round and square alike. The myriad phenomena know birth and decay, as spring flowers wither in autumn; the single qi waxes and wanes, as night dew vanishes at dawn.

I drift across the five lakes in a small boat, soar over the three isles on a black crane. Ascending high requires distance, descending low presents no difficulty—only by not obscuring the subtle signs does one become a person of true understanding.

Your plum-scented letter, delivered by courier, has just arrived, and I am fortunate that your serene harmony aligns with my fading recollections.

**Memorial from the Celestial Master to the Divine Brother**

In ancient times, after the Three Heavens, fathers departed and sons succeeded; now, among the masters of the registers, elder brothers step aside and younger brothers assume their place. As your humble servant dons the vestments, I pray the Great Ultimate will witness and know: though I seek to store blessings within this unworthy self, I can never forget the great gift bestowed.

I am at a loss for words.

**Memorial of Gratitude for Official Appointment**

The times do not wait for men, and I regret being favored by celestial grace. The kindness extends to my kin, bringing joy to my private household. I am ashamed that such honor truly overwhelms me, and my joy is mingled with awe and trepidation.

I recall that from the time I was but a youth with unbound hair, I was blessed to receive your radiant light. Seven years have passed, and three imperial decrees have been issued—granting me a dwelling with cloud-browed eaves to facilitate my devotions, and bestowing the *Yuli Jing* of the Xuanhe reign to aid my cultivation and practice. Then came the grace of the "Leaking Spring," extending even to my elder brother of the same womb, whose encounter with the boundless was beyond any repayment I could offer.

This is all due to your singular elevation of the teachings, your boundless compassion that knows no distinction, and your profound regard for the bonds of heaven and kin, which you have extended even to me. Though precedent exists, it still astonishes the age. My devotion, like that of a dog or horse, is what I must offer; the splendor of the phoenix and simurgh is beyond all measure.

With the sincerity of incense and flame, I pray for the eternal longevity of the imperial hills. Gazing toward the heavens and longing for the sagely presence, my emotions are as urgent as if I stood at the edge of an abyss.

Respectfully submitted.

**Five-Character Ancient Verse**

*Written in Response to Shi Yuangui’s Discourse on the Gull and Roc*

Soaring but a few *ren* in flight—
how differs it from ninety thousand *li*?
The Great Dao drifts, nameless,
without "that" or "this."

Alas, Master Yuangui,
such words near their end.
All things arise from the Supreme Ultimate;
the steadfast set their lofty aims.
Yet gull and roc,
in debate, miss the highest truth.
Forms shift and change,
but never leave the Six Directions’ bounds.
Leaping or soaring, traversing paths—
why mock near or far?
Only then is known the *xiaoyaoyou*,
its distant gleam revealing the profound intent.

The discourse done, the four windows stilled,
words forgotten, the desk left empty.

**[The Prefect’s Visit]**
Commissioner Xu of the Bureau of Operations sought the Recluse Li in his district, then came to visit Shangqing. There, we boiled tea and spoke at length, parting only at midnight. His words were a delight to the ear—truly grand, lofty, and transformative. Even the mountains and rivers seemed more radiant. The next day, we bade farewell.

At the time, it was the fifth year of Xuanhe. Here follows a brief account:

The west wind first stirs, light,
white dew still glistening.
A man floats down the great river,
eastward to Raoyang.
He bears a decree from the Ninefold Throne,
and so seeks the cinnabar chambers.
Mountain *qi* gleams with dragon and tiger,
green forests stretch beyond the clouds.
By chance, he meets me—
our discourse sharp as frost.
Dusk falls, and we take up candles;
seated beneath the new moon’s chill.
The jade toad veils the misty scene,
golden breezes waft celestial fragrance.
Shadows fall like hometown clouds,
brilliant, offering wondrous omens.
The Six Directions share no other hue,
the Five Peaks bathe in autumn’s light.
A brocade-robed exile in the dusty world,
riding a whale, he parts the river’s beams.
You await the fulfillment of our mystic pact,
soaring ethereal in the empty sky.

---

**Tang Mingquan Takes His Family into the Dao**
How fine, your long-held detachment,
your talent unused for office!
Amid white clouds, chickens and dogs,
you lead your family to wander here.
Your hidden depths are extraordinary—
profound principles may be attained in stillness.
Alas, the enlightened lord’s decree
could not sway your resolve.
Transformed into a river-and-sea talent,
utterly free of worldly dust.
I hear of Magistrate Jingyang,
who raised his household beyond the mortal realm.
Such matters lie in earnest cultivation—
strive on, scion of the Tang!

---

**A Eulogy on the Dragon-Transforming Pavilion, Presented to the Daoist Master of Qingcheng**
A chamber free of dust,
harmonious winds sway jade bamboo.
The desk holds only zither and books,
untrammeled, apart from the vulgar world.
Now and then, he wields his brush,
transcribing talismans and tallying records.
Or he joins Master Wu Xuan,
playing two or three games of *liubo*.
At night, beneath the moon beyond the woods,
he plays divine melodies upon his knee.
Deep into the night, his interest unspent,
he slowly unfurls the scrolls.
Come, Master of Qingcheng,
as clouds part, distant mountains turn green.

---

**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Farewell**
Just arrived at the towering peaks,
I ascend again the verdant heights.
Tuning the zither’s green strings to "White Snow,"
in stillness, I pluck "Yellow Bell."
Treading the path of the ancients,
pursuing the traces of immortals.
Since coming here, I’ve known abundant fortune—
yet I trust in each other’s carefree ease.
Where is there no joy?
This heart knows its course.
Like a single slice of moon
hanging on the ten-thousand-year pine.

---

**Thinking of the Elder of Qingcheng**
Since parting from the Elder of Qingcheng,
now several months have passed.
The scorching sky, spring’s breath waning,
mountain blossoms swiftly scatter.
Time and again, I yearn and gaze,
westward, pacing the jade pavilion.
Surely he lingers among men,
where pipes and songs still revel in delight.
Return, companion of the world beyond—
fulfill our pact at Green Cliff.
The setting sun flashes its lingering glow,
lotus rising from golden carving.

---

**In Response to Yuan Gui’s Encouragement**
Your words, sir, cite the ancients,
making clear the Dao resides here—
without action, yet goodness arrives.
Now you have truly attained it,
offering music to seek true knowledge.
A single phrase reveals your nature,
though words can scarcely contain it.
I know you have mastered Lao and Zhuang,
striding through the vast wilds by day.
In spirited discourse on the mystery within mystery,
you stand unbounded, without limit.
To learn, one must have something to await—
not contending with the myriad demons.
Gazing at the scene, as if knowing,
why marvel at the strange or uncanny?
Doubts dispelled, trust is born—
then you are truly a good man.
Take goodness as your teacher,
and the celestial truth may be attained in stillness.
Men still debate rank and station,
but the affairs of immortals should follow spontaneity.
If fate decrees one surpasses the common,
why wait for death to end all?
The Great Dao is no empty illusion—
luminous, it stands above the ten thousand things.
Hearing this once, I feel
my spirit refreshed, my soul invigorated.
Cease debating depth or shallowness—
these words express a heart sincere.
The times are such that I am fallen,
yet I cherish this saying.
Though others may scoff in passing,
they cannot fault its kindness.
Fortunate to differ from the vulgar,
I ponder these matters deeply.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Magistrate Zhang on Reducing Food Expenses**
No need for lavish fare—
the ancients prized moderation.
One meal’s sufficiency, what more to seek?
The Eight Delicacies are not my desire.
Before the rhinoceros chopsticks are laid,
I have already forfeited my life’s allotment.
The Creator apportions to each their measure,
how much or little, fixed in number.
Think further of those starving on the road—
all from lack of food.
Master Zhuang valued the pigeon’s meal—
this passage should be read again and again.

---

**Also on Reducing Clothing**
Clothing should suit the season—
winter furs and summer linen.
Consider the diligent practitioner,
who at first cares not for finery.
Light silks and fine brocades,
new styles, their prices varied.
A few thousand coins for each bolt,
clumsy tailors hacking at random.
A trifling misfit, yet the heart is displeased.
Have you known the poor,
whose skin cracks in winter and summer alike?

*Third Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Thirty-Sixth Celestial Master, the Vacant Tranquility Perfected Lord*

**The Song of the Great Dao**

The Dao is not far—it dwells within the body.
All things are empty, yet nature is not void.
If nature remains unvoid, harmonious qi abides;
qi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.

To keep the spirit within the body,
let not a single thing linger in the numinous terrace.
If things remain, the spirit grows unclear,
draining vitality and wasting sinew and bone.

The spirit guides qi, qi sustains form—
no need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.
Arts are easy to know, but the Dao is hard to fathom;
even when fathomed, one fails to practice it single-mindedly.
Thus, though thousands and tens of thousands study,
in the end, scarcely one or two succeed.

If the spirit strays, bring it back;
when the spirit returns, qi naturally follows.
Morning and evening, thus renewed,
the true embryo of the unblemished child is born.

---

**The Song of Emptiness**

Emptiness stretches boundless, without shore or edge,
sun and moon traverse east and west in mutual farewell.
How long will their eastbound farewells and westbound welcomes last?
In the realm of birth and death, they flash like lightning.

The true nature, originally one with emptiness,
shines bright and clear, free from dimness.
Yet by a single thought, it falls into form,
lost in the cycle of birth and death, wandering east and west.

Alas, how few in the world awaken!
Death brings sorrow, birth brings joy—
unaware that birth is the root of death,
rejoicing in the sun’s rise, dreading its fall.

Eastward rise and westward fall are the natural way;
do not let the heart’s attachments entangle you.
If you doubt, observe the sun and moon—
dawn and dusk, they ceaselessly circle the heavens.

Birth is not arrival, death is not departure;
nothing arises from dependence, all abides where it dwells.
The six paths of rebirth rush in vain—
the true person dwells only in emptiness.

Where the true person dwells, no house stands,
neighboring wind and moon in pure void.
Do not say the numinous light is but a speck—
it encompasses the Dharma realm without omission.

The Dharma realm, vast beyond bounds,
pervades the tiniest dust, yet holds nothing within.
Hunger, cold, and calamity cannot touch it;
every thing, every head, returns to the sovereign.

A heap of dust, a body of a hundred years—
like a boat adrift on water, steered by another’s hand.
Suddenly the boat breaks, the passenger steps ashore;
the withered wood, masterless, sinks and drifts.

Do not rot, do not look back—how many rivers have you crossed?
Countless streams, how many times have you passed this way?
Once ashore, burn the boat—no need for it;
why speak of waves as bitter, their green as sorrow?

Whether dwelling in the boat or not, fear not—
last night’s wind and thunder shook the mountains.
Emptiness remains unmoved, ever thus;
only when you grasp true emptiness will you not be deluded.

From ancient times to now, it stands eternal;
upending the world, it reveals its full body.
Having delivered all beings from the sea of suffering,
the message of true emptiness is no inert void.

Transformations unfold without end—
hear my song within the void,
an iron serpent soaring to Kunlun’s peak.

---

**The Song of Rest**

Rest, rest, rest—cease, cease, cease.
Rest and cease without distinction.
A thousand subtleties, ten thousand mysteries—
all teach but one thing: rest and cease.

If you can rest, if you can cease,
all entanglements of emotion are severed.
Hunger eats, thirst drinks, weariness sleeps—
through ten thousand deaths and a thousand births, no concern remains.

The sages of old, the wise and enlightened,
their single nature endures through eons.
Radiant light illumines, merging with true emptiness—
beyond rest and cessation, nothing else remains.

Those who plant seeds in hell,
who weave karmic debts,
their six senses burn like raging fire.
Clinging to self, contending with others, blind to rest and cessation,
they willingly endure dismemberment and tongue extraction.

Rest and cease—this is the true oral formula,
beyond foolishness, wisdom, skill, or clumsiness.
From ancient teachers, the truth is this:
they lamented those who cultivated without meeting a kindred heart—who would reveal it?

Rest is not rest, cease is not cease—
the great function manifests without pretense.
It governs the primal transformation, leaving no trace,
encompassing emptiness, transcending arising and ceasing.

Neither rest nor cease—
rest and cease are but forced words.
To know true rest and true cessation,
look to the flawless moon of mid-autumn.

---

**Composed at Qiantang**

Crimson clouds reflect the vermilion balustrade,
white clouds veil the green mountains.
Worldly folk never come here—
a pair of cranes dance at the brushwood gate.

A jade zither plays one tune, poems flow in numbers;
the mountain boy boils tea, the stove emits no smoke.
Longing for the world’s pleasures, I wandered away—
how many years have passed since I left this grotto heaven?

On the Xiang River, the moon begins to pale;
by the Xiang’s banks, the wind’s touch is clear.
The jade flute’s broken notes choke with sorrow—
how much grief does the frosty embankment hold?

Human life is but floating clouds.
The immortals’ spring remains—
return, return! Rejoice in my true self.

---

**Matching Yuan Gui’s "Let Them Sing as They Will"**

Let them sing as they will, let them do as they please—
pay them no mind.
Right or wrong, what can they do to me?

All day, I idle with friends beyond the world,
chanting verses, my brush flowing like a torrent.
Unburdened by worldly ties,
my sword in its scabbard subdues yin demons.

I have grasped the mystery of the immortal’s gate—
let the sun and moon shuttle like a loom.
The toil of the dust is truly vile—
who would drift and idle, following the years?

In quietude, I ponder the affairs of the bustling world—
in the end, all is but empty striving.
Let them sing as they will, let them do as they please—
pay them no mind.

Just nurture the primal qi to harmony.
Sometimes, I freely read alchemical texts;
at leisure, I seek songs on the jade zither.
My heart is no stone—it cannot be moved.
Let worldly opinions breed discord—
I wear a pine-wood hairpin and hempen robe, content,
how could I crave the trappings of luxury?

In the divine furnace, the golden elixir is refined,
ever more serene and abundant.
When merit and practice are complete, we shall depart together,
soaring on feathered canopies to brush the River of Stars.

Let them sing as they will, let them do as they please—
pay them no mind.

---

**The Song of the Bellows**

Do not say the Great Dao is effortless action—
you must clarify the bellows within the chamber.
Miss the moment, and not a breath passes;
purple mists and crimson light swirl in brilliance.

The Azure Dragon rejoices, the White Tiger balks,
the Scarlet Serpent coils around the Black Tortoise’s shell.
Even if you pass the Tail Gate,
you are still barred by the path of Cao Creek.

Two paths ascend straight to the cinnabar field—
it is said that above lies the Pavilion of the Three Pure Ones.
Beneath the pavilion, a jade pool is clearly seen,
within it, the elixir of immortality.

Seize the moment, gather it—
having ingested it, enjoy the bliss of Penglai.

**The Song of Jing Tong Hermitage**

I built my thatched hermitage deep in the mountains,
and others mock me, calling it Jing Tong.
Yet all the world’s vastness fits within this inch of land,
as boundless as the empty void.

My hermitage is neither "jing" nor "tong,"
its eight sides translucent, without form or shadow.
Waxing and waning follow heaven’s decree—
even the master within knows nothing of it.

Sometimes in winter’s wind and snow,
the mountain lies desolate all day, no smoke from human hearths.
The void is ink-black, day as dark as night,
yet within the hermitage, light shines in perfect radiance.

Sometimes wind and thunder rise from flat earth,
mountains sink, rivers surge, clouds and mist swirl.
Dragons roar, tigers howl, ten thousand forms clamor—
within the hermitage, emerald stillness rises without cease.

Pines and bamboos encircle the hermitage, verdant to the sky,
withering not in winter, flourishing not in spring.
People come and laugh at the hardship of hermit life,
yet bone-deep poverty is bone-deep purity.

This pure poverty is the finest way to live—
I recall the vermilion gates, where many starve.
If you recognize the pearl that is your own,
why covet another’s treasures all your life?

The hermitage is like the body, the master like the heart—
to understand the master, you must seek within.
Donkey’s womb, horse’s belly—dreams like grains of sand—
who knows the iron ore hides refined gold?

Open your eyes wide, act swiftly—
seek now the "something" within "nothing."
Words exhausted, principles cut off, delusions dissolved—
the maneless lion roars to the heavens.

The grand mansions before the hermitage are but fleeting lodges—
how many true friends will dwell here with me?
Unless you wrench free with hands that sever cliffs,
who can recognize the one beyond the edge?

Within this space, joy unknown to others,
the work of stillness gained in leisure.
Naturally wondrous, naturally true—
all transcendent immortals emerge from this.

This floating life is brief, its light fleeting—
when the hermitage crumbles, all must end.
I broadly urge all disciples of my gate:
do not neglect this hermitage—cultivate it early.

**The Song of the Wild Pavilion**

Leviathans of the four seas are not worth fishing—
even if they take the hook, I want them not.
The immortals of the three isles are not worth boasting—
those who attain long life and deathlessness number like hemp.

Stirring fame is not worth relying on—
all the heroes of history are but a play.
A little wealth and rank are not worth delighting in—
how does it compare to the idle clouds beyond the wild pavilion?

When the kalpa fire reduces all to ashes,
even if you sleep through it, you hear nothing.

Wild pavilion, wild pavilion—where is it?
The cosmos vast, yet no path leads in.
Ten thousand immortals dive in the waves,
a million rocs traverse the earth’s depths.

This pavilion—truly extraordinary,
unknown to gods, unfathomed by ghosts.
East it pierces, west it pierces,
south it pierces, north it pierces—
at its center, a single aperture holds worlds like grains of dust.

Within each dust-mote world, a mote of dust,
each mote of dust a true person.
Each true person a true source,
their retinues and regalia countless as grains of sand.

If mortals see the old man of the wild pavilion,
one glance with the true eye sends them fleeing.
Ah-ha-ha! The wild pavilion’s song, for ages unending.

---

**To Prefect Lin**

Who does not love the gate of long life?
You need only apply effort yourself.
On the nine-palace terrace, the yellow sprout grows;
by the white jade pool, the peach of immortality blooms.

Strike the heavenly gate, and ghosts and spirits submit;
turn the earth’s axis, and yin demons are defeated.
The river chariot ascends to the ninefold heavens,
the sun and moon refine a world of gold.

**Longing for Ghost Valley Mountain and the Grotto of True Thought, Presented to Yuan Gui**

The Grotto of True Thought—deep in clouds and waters,
where the Daoist dwells, even ghosts and spirits revere.
Mountain flowers smile in the shade of pines and bamboos,
rock streams murmur—sounds of a thousand ages.

When shall I visit, to clear my spirit and heart,
climb the stone vines, and laugh and chant together?

*Record of the Words of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, Xu Jing Zhenjun, Volume Three—Concluded*
*Record of the Words of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, Xu Jing Zhenjun, Volume Four*

**Compiled by the Forty-Third Celestial Master, Successor Grandson Yu Chu**

**Five-Character Regulated Verse: On Yuan Gui’s Request to Return to the Mountains, Composed as a Hymn from Afar**

Joy to see the primal stone,
wordless, yet the truth alone.
Back to seek the stone-bridge vow,
washing off the capital’s dust now.
Incense coils in still alchemy,
poems bloom with fresh brush glee.
High clouds embrace no lonely jade,
hand in hand through grotto’s glade.

**Matching the Rhyme of Master Hunlun’s "Immediate Matters" at His Hermitage**

Self-attained the carefree way,
always fond of quiet stay.
By the stream, red fades to small,
beyond mist, green bamboos tall.
Things exist in constant sway,
form forgotten—void holds sway.
Worldly cares of toil and strain,
here dissolve without a trace.

**For Yuan Gui and Tai Ding, the Two Gentlemen**

By the water, lute and song,
beneath the eaves, a scroll held long.
Each heart follows its delight,
heaven’s music—how pure, how bright!
Summer’s first days just begun,
idle blossoms still hold spring’s sun.
Unchanged by cold or heat’s decree,
only the primal self we see.

**[Autumn Eve]**

On autumn’s eve, with wine in hand,
I sketch the scene, though roughly planned.
To summon verse of finest kind,
the fleeting beauty to unwind.

Flickering autumn’s radiant grace,
all treasures ripen in their place.
The pine stands tall, a crane’s lone cry,
the bamboo thick, a cicada’s sigh.
Deep drunk, my robes grow damp with dew,
empty songs ride the clear wind through.
A lute at my waist—play once more,
the marshlands of Chu hold songs in store.

**Seeing Yuan Gui Off on His Journey to Mount Magu**

Sleeves brushed, the scenes of Ma’s source,
light and pure, his lofty force.
No distance daunts his thousand-mile way,
alone he treads the five-clouds’ sway.
With zither and books, his joy is found,
no worldly ties his heart have bound.
I grieve to lag in his pursuit,
turning back, my longing mute.

**Matching Yuan Gui’s Rhyme for the Cloud-Brushing Pavilion**

Sparse jade frames the lofty hall,
slowly rising, near the clouds’ thrall.
Two pillars share the coolest shade,
westward, the Dragon-Transform Pavilion made—
a gust of wind divides the scene.
This land laments the zither’s seat,
hard to nest among the sparrows’ fleet.
The host cherishes the straight and true,
who dares wield cunning adze anew?

**[In Response to Yuan Gui]**

Master Yuan Gui read my *Discourse on the Heart*,
sent a hymn—now matching rhyme in part.
New words, though few, unfold so clear,
their chanting cleanses soul and ear.
Intent lies beyond the verdant scene,
the heart is source of all dharmas’ sheen.
Like dragons, who can fathom deep?
Like herding horses, words too meek.
Thrice pondering the depths untold,
returning, we’ll discuss in full.

**Listening to Yuan Gui’s Zither**

All things in tumultuous array,
yet primal sound does not stray.
Ancients plucked it from the strings,
I seek it now where thought takes wing.
Water strikes the cliffside stone,
wind high on the isle—autumn’s tone.
Gazing thus, true joy is found,
wandering freely, heaven and earth unbound.

**Delight in Clear Skies**

Peonies all have withered now,
mountain springs at last allow
their voices clear. Late spring’s retreat,
yet night’s clear skies bring joy complete.
High willows brush the eaves today,
idle flowers light the dell’s bright way.
By the pines, good wine we’ll pour,
today my thoughts run clear once more.

**[For Deng and Cheng, the Two Disciples]**

Deng and Cheng received the Way from me,
the rites complete at the pure altar’s spree.
No seal on heaven’s threefold gate,
yet hard to turn their hearts’ true state.
Dew-wet missives call the moved,
torn silk seals the pact approved.
The sacred sword, one day to test,
the Dharma lamp burns brightest.
Inward gaze brings self-awakening,
the highest truth is passionless.

**Seeing Off Dharma Master Zheng Zhi**

His Daoist mien—ancient, proud, and tall,
his fame perfumes ten thousand li in thrall.
Purple mist swirls in his robes’ embrace,
cinnabar pendants, jade in radiant grace.
Secluded in his cliffside hall,
he chants the grotto’s hymns with care.
Await the day his merit’s full,
his cloud-borne carriage soars to heaven’s lair.

**Drying Scriptures**

The lingering sun fills the high terrace,
scripture bags unfurl like cloud-woven lace.
Plum blossoms steam with yang’s warm breath,
forest shadows turn the light’s bequest.
Delving deep, a thousand spirits start,
high chanting crumbles myriad ills apart.
Diligent in unlocking mysteries,
we rely on talents rare as these.

**Evening Stroll in the Mountains**

The roosting crow calls once again,
seeking its nest—I ask in vain.
Small stars gleam, now drawing near,
high cassia’s boughs I first appear.
Brushing dew, the pines still stand,
waiting for the wind’s command.
Is there no place to rest at ease?
Green reaches even Xie’s peaks.

**Matching Yuan Gui’s Rhyme for Yang Zi’s Hermitage at True-Form Cliff**

You must ascend the highest height,
yearning for the ancients’ light.
Wind brings many cypress seeds,
buds contend to leave the dust’s deeds.
Where heat and cold dare not intrude,
heaven’s flowers bloom in solitude.
Immortal traces fade from view,
the vulgar crowd still seeks the clue.

**Matching Rhyme to Encourage Yuan Gui**

Wander freely, pass the time,
recognize the self sublime.
Pain and joy are but delusion’s art,
in boundless dark, the truth imparts.
Toiling in vain brings self-defeat,
tranquil ease is endless spring’s seat.
Do you know my thoughts, my friend?
This body’s not yours to defend.

**Four Poems on the Hall of Measuring the Dao**

I’ve often gazed at mid-autumn’s moon,
the mountain hall feels desolate too soon.
Though dwelling here a hundred days,
I sense the Three Terraces’ near gaze.
Great trees’ voices probe the night,
tall bamboos shade the quiet height.
If one cannot transcend alone,
how face the return to one’s own?

Near the door, all treetops sway,
not formed from specks of dust’s array.
The mountains’ paths I’ve not yet trod,
after rain, they gleam like jade’s nod.
Peaches planted toward the sky,
clouds arise from ridges high.
No cock’s crow or dog’s bark here,
only phoenix flutes I hear.

Those who suddenly ascend the hall
are like immortals in daylight’s thrall.
Lofty, deep—beside the saint’s trace,
I’m shamed by my unworthy place.
Slender moon and chilling dew,
tall pines ask of fields anew.
The palace built but years ago,
still makes me knock the bell to show.

Facing the west window’s space,
two peaks array their emerald grace.
White clouds drift into the painting,
when will the dark crane take its wing?
Shear the moss like bamboo’s sheen,
hoe the moss that clings unseen.
Sometimes I leave the door unlatched,
mist and rain the terrace hatched.

**Linked Verse**

With Yuan Gui seated in quiet night,
we pour the wine bestowed so bright.
Together we drink the master’s brew,
three cups—yet who would refuse anew?

Leaning close, we speak the Dao’s art,
brush in hand, new poems we start.
Though ill, I’m drawn to join the cheer,
for joy’s sake, distance disappears.

Sparse stars link the distant Han,
green waters gleam in the fronting pan.
Before Pei’s lines could join the thread,
I’m shamed—what joy the learned shed!

Suddenly clear, then wise,
Tai Ding sits silent, lost in guise.
New lotus leaves draw near,
dustless, the bright moon trails here.

**Mountain Wind**

The mountain wind arrives in whispers fine,
silver candles gleam with scattered shine.
With bright eyes, I gaze afar,
let not the crimson blinds descend so far.
The demon of sleep now wholly dispelled,
my chanting thoughts grow clearer, strange, and well.
A thousand forms dissolve in laughter’s span,
a thousand springs condense to one brief span.

This joy we share may well suffice,
let scorners mock—what care I twice?
The Dao’s weight binds all in accord,
yet scheming hearts I still abhor.
Gautama stands as friend most true,
the Old Sage is my master through.
The four seas hold no further care,
each lord finds solace rich and rare.

On immortal crags, I moor my boat,
in cloud-brocade, I sow the red elixir’s note.
The world deems this folly vain,
yet we still find what we may attain.
In red dust, I tread a fleeting trace,
to the Purple Court, the path is not far in space.
From first to last, I hold Guanzi dear,
yet shame my friend Bo Ci’s hold so near.

When merit’s done, I’ll ride abreast,
through the six directions, roam at rest.

---

**Again**

Wine scorns the price of Gaoyang’s fame,
men cherish the feelings of ancient name.
We raise our cups to share delight,
facing the scene, we strike new song’s light.
Twelve parts of pure qi,
three thousand beyond worldly glory.
Heaven’s truth is our sole guide,
let no worldly rites our spirits bind.

The cicada’s hum draws softly near,
the pine’s voice swells, serene and clear.
The forest wind chills our seated frame,
the mountain moon illumines all the same.
In perfect stillness, the spirit soars,
at midnight’s hour, the qi still roars.
The stars’ patterns gleam like jade’s bright sheen,
the tiger’s strength makes the purple brush light.

To gain one’s will is not in cap and crown,
to roam the spirit, one must seek the sea’s renown.
At Zhongyuan, let us drink our fill,
mocking vain names with carefree will.

---

**Seven Words, Again**

Drunk, I boast the cloud-liquor’s grace,
chanting, I feel my feathers light as lace.
From the pine pavilion, longing knows no bound,
by the bamboo rail, my lingering thoughts grow sound.
Distant water grasses hold their emerald hue,
wildflowers still unfold their petals true.
The wind arrives to banish summer’s heat,
the autumn cicada sings as dusk repeats.

The immortal realm seems near the heavenly way,
the *Feng-Sao* spurns the world’s entangling fray.
Though you ride the clouds to question crane in flight,
I’ll mount the whale of the sea’s vast height.
The White Emperor’s qi steels all things stern,
the Daoist’s heart, steadfast, makes a hundred demons turn.
Together we rejoice in forest’s calm retreat,
mocking those who chase the city’s street.

By the stream, let’s share the joy of Three Laughs,
in drinking, vie with the Eight Immortals’ cause.
Say not my wine’s all lost to you,
for poetry’s renown may yet be due to me and you.

**Visiting the Abode of Truth Together**

Our mood draws us to Truth’s retreat,
our hearts moved by the ancients’ feat.
The ancients’ Dao was not alone,
our hearts today share not a stone.
In stillness, joy beyond the world,
in clarity, no dreams are hurled.
Profound discourse transcends form and mind,
our songs and talks through caves unwind.

Wild hues blend with tea’s fragrant bowl,
the pine’s voice enters the zither’s soul.
We cannot yet chant “Let us return,”
so raise the jar of rosy glow in turn.

---

**Linked Verse on Timely Rain**

How to console the common folk?
The mountains and rivers greet the clouds’ cloak.
Sincerity moves heaven and earth,
red earnestness lies in word and worth.
Southern fields’ seedlings once stood dry,
now western suburbs see the rain’s reply.
Peaks and woods grow lush and deep,
grass and trees share joy’s leap.
Blame not the magic fields’ rich bloom,
but rather the feathered robes’ toil and gloom.
Does heaven bend to private whim?
The vulgar world is steeped in sin.
The roads’ dust settles, heat divides,
a bountiful year the farmer’s heart gladdens wide.
Great virtue thanks our lord’s grace,
branches glisten, startling the forest’s race.
The kitchen’s pure, no gnats remain,
how shall the Perfected repay this gain?
Only by burning incense rare.

---

**Linked Verse on the Completion of the Hunlun Hermitage**

We build a hut to view the numinous scene,
when work is done, what then is seen?
Zither and books while away the days,
fishing and trapping age the vines’ embrace.
Envious of cloud-trails far and wide,
we often share the wine’s tide.
The jade cave opens ‘mid the peaks,
the western stream pours like the Silver River’s leaks.
Adorning our pendants, we think of Heaven’s Pillar,
watching the sunset, we grasp the Axe’s lesson.
True feeling scorns the shallow and thin,
worldly affairs are but a fleeting din.
Cutting all ties to seek no burden’s weight,
stilling the heart to reach the wave’s calm state.
In Hunlun, we rest in sweet repose,
in truth and simplicity, the world’s deceit we oppose.
Dust and filth are barred by a thousand peaks,
the wind’s flow harmonizes ten thousand qi’s seeks.
Heaven and earth may vie in longevity,
sun and moon shuttle like a loom’s decree.
Immortals’ coming is not without sign,
the crane’s arrival bears its own design.

---

**In the first decade of the first month, dozens of white cranes flew here, circling for some time before departing.**

We brew tea to keep our guests in talk,
plant herbs to heal the people’s walk.
Bamboo dew extends its cooling shade,
orchid winds stir the songs we’ve made.
Idle, we seek the immortals’ scrolls to read,
in stillness, we grasp the jade texts’ creed.
The Great Dao still clothes us like a robe,
the clamorous dust ensnares the globe.
Life flickers like a spark struck from stone,
the world shifts like a moth to flame’s own.
To enter the high immortals’ tune,
beware the lower ghosts’ dark boon.
Beneath the thatched eaves, no task remains,
from time to time, we chant our strains.

---

**Drinking, We Linked “Moon over the West River”**

This night the moon shines bright as day,
the eastern pool rivals the West River’s sway.
Moonlit, the courtyard’s hush is deep,
wine’s joy and poetry’s passion we cannot keep.
Unwilling to return to the thatched hall,
we dip our brushes, wild and tall.
By the lamp, we chant to the quiet pane,
mocking the fleeting spring’s refrain.

*Record of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, Perfected Lord Xu Jing, Volume Five*

**Sequential Heir, the Forty-Third Celestial Master Yu Chu, Compiles Seven-Character Regulated Verse**

**Following the Imperial Gift to the Perfected Realized One’s Rhyme**
Jade talismans and golden script chant the Cavern of Perfection’s truth,
Within the real, who rivals such lofty and wondrous art?
Worldly green cast aside, the spirit remains ever still,
Essence-feeding ceased, the meal is but dust’s part.
Ever shall I aid the sagely brightness in transforming the age,
Never should I idle my life in aimless roam.
By your decree, fortune multiplies for me,
To enter the jade palace and meet the One alone.

**Night Sitting in the Capital, Longing for the Primordial Hermitage**
Alone I sit in the empty hut, stillness known,
How could the river city’s charm compare to this?
Behold the phoenix fruit at its first ripening,
Self-proclaimed as the toad’s radiance in its prime.
With cloud-aged immortals, I’d share the joy of wine,
From worldly dust, no praise for Qing Zong’s verse I’d claim.
In the mountains’ groves, a realm of emptiness and light,
Unable to return, my chanting bears longing’s weight.

**Responding in Rhyme to Minister Zhao**
In sweltering heat, I left my homeland’s hills,
Now frost and snow bring creeping cold.
I rue my hollow fame that drags me through the world,
While cherishing your lofty words, leaning on the rail.
Of late, I’ve wearied of guests beyond the dawn,
Ever plucking the zither through the night’s veil.
Already granted leave to return next spring,
I marvel in advance at the crane’s preening wing.

**Seeing Off the Perfected Realized One**
For long I’ve admired your pure renown,
In the former court, by fortune, I bowed at the vermilion gate.
Often I glimpsed your bearing in frequent meetings,
Yet now I grieve the frosty sky hastens your retreat.
Your perfect virtue humbles the middle and lower ranks to laughter,
Your towering talent, rare since ancient days, is truly great.
Ashamed my merit and conduct fall short of Yang and Xu,
How might I, like Nan Zhen, test the Supreme Tenuity’s gate?

**New Lotus**
Withered lotus spent, the young buds round,
Bright eyes embrace their fragrance, yet pity they abound.
The Moon Emperor comes seeking the azure jade casket,
The Golden Lad stands recognizing the sapphire coin’s sound.
Already condensed, heavy dew nurtures the pure qi,
What luck the gentle breeze sweeps the faint mist away.
Far off, Hua Peak remains wholly fair,
Its blossoms unfurl, crimson and bright as they sway.

**Qiantang**
Countless households encircled by the city’s winding stream,
Where white clouds part, vermilion and azure gleam.
The land connects to the golden realm of three thousand worlds,
The mountains, jade peaks forming a six-foot screen.
At dawn, I lean on the railing, dew still clinging,
At night, I draw the curtains, cold stars glimmering.
The river’s scenery and windscape defy compare,
Half resembling Penglai, half Dongting’s lair.

**Hengfu’s New Tea Triumphs in Contest, Thus I Sing**
They say green and white surpass yellow and white,
Your new buds outshine the old, this much is right.
Dragon’s tongue swiftly gathers the golden tripod’s fire,
Feathered robes vie to claim the snow-cup’s bloom bright.
To Penglai’s high chariot, you must ascend,
The faint fragrance of lesser teas cannot contend.
Yet more, the host’s skill shines through,
Cai Jun must enter Lu Yu’s abode anew.

**Inscribed at the Royal Immortal’s Precious Accumulation Abbey**
Immortals departed, their hermitage remains,
I arrive, delighted to halt my cloud-borne reins.
On this seventh day of the seventh month, autumn’s sun,
The flower’s pistil blooms eternal, a thousand years have run.
Before a lone pine, flowing water springs,
Several lines of Shen Yue’s playful verses cling.
At dusk, we pour wine to adorn the lotus fruit,
Casually discussing the Great Beginning’s root.

**Composed Hastily on the Seventh Night of the Seventh Month in the Capital**
How could the Seventh Night’s splendor fade so soon?
Once a year, the weaving maid and herder commune.
Unstartled by the shooting stars’ high flight,
All gaze upward this night in full sight.
Flowers and moon hold tender feeling, the celestial gate ajar,
Yan Mountain shares its portion, the winecup’s chill afar.
From here, the solemn autumn’s shade will follow,
Fearing my robes may not suffice for winter’s hollow.

**Returning from the Capital, First Visiting the Dragon Transformation Pavilion to Reclaim the Secluded Charm of Former Years, Roughly Sketching an Empty Heart in a Long Verse**
I sought the fragrant jade of former years,
Together with true appreciation, we leaned on the rail’s span.
Some followed the white sun’s flight, transforming as immortals,
Half for today’s treasures, the dark hexagram’s plan.
Its luster not yet withered, spring’s creatures smile,
Its sparse shadows come to dance in the moonlight’s aisle.
Though Jiangnan’s autumn scenes remain bustling and grand,
This single lapel of wind and moon brings a chill so bland.

**Returning to the Mountains**
For years in the capital, a prisoner most confined,
Returning to the hills and vales, freedom at last I find.
Flowing water murmurs as if in shared speech,
Leisurely clouds, unbound, with me they roam and reach.
Monkeys cling to pine shadows, watching the cinnabar stove,
Cranes and reed flowers board the fishing boat’s move.
Such a post is not at all ill-suited,
Why should the red dust’s affairs ever have polluted?

**Responding to Prefect Yu and Censor’s Poem on Wandering Immortal’s Rock**
For years in the forest, my intent ran long,
Through valleys and peaks, wind and frost I’ve known.
Vulgar guests never crossed my threshold,
The enlightened would not deem me mad, I’ve shown.
By the river pavilion, I once built, recalling Ninghai’s shore,
Now in the stone house, I dwell, like Lai Xiang’s door.
Who would have thought the new prefect of Shangrao,
Would visit this mountain retreat on his courtly tour?

**The Moon-Stealing Leisure Hall**
Dense forests and towering peaks once detained me,
A decade in office, not among the loftiest ranks I’d be.
The Red Emperor rides the dragon at summer’s end,
Chang’e shares the moon’s glow deep in the mountains’ trend.
Passes and fords, unobstructed after war’s din,
Rest and sustenance now secure in the village’s din.
Now, by the willow-lined dike, a true official’s retreat,
Clear streams and splendid gardens, a spacious, tranquil seat.

**Inscribed at the Pavilion of Emptiness**
Nurture the empty qi to preserve life whole,
Dwelling in the Pavilion of Emptiness, just a few beams hold.
At South Bank, the Dao’s loftiness earns its fine name,
In Supreme Tenuity’s warmth, the magnolia’s pure frame.
A hundred chapters cherish the dense green forest’s shade,
Three bodies should inscribe Laozi’s words, thus made.
Until the day I attend court at the Purple Chamber’s gate,
How many places will the white clouds lightly freight?

**For Master Xiang**

**The Qin Studio**

The Qin Studio was my former dwelling, named for the qin—five strings it bore. Master Xiang and his disciples now reside here, discoursing on Zhuangzi and Laozi with refined delight. Once I visited, and in recalling past affairs, I found it no less splendid than the many renowned sites. The poem I composed for Master Xiang simply records the truth:

The Qin Studio’s lofty spirit holds true wind,
Mountains embrace guests, yet no compromise is pinned.
You ask of life and death, not in idle haste,
But speak of Zhuang and Lao—would you rush the taste?
Glad now we may come and go as friends,
Yet rue the time when guests once shared these ends.
The recluse may compare it to his heart’s own measure,
Such a man would not weary the *jiaotong*’s treasure.

**Celebrating the Completion of the Hunlun Hermitage**

The lofty studio is suddenly complete,
Red stones and green pines press into the sight.
Virtue’s constancy has long bound worldly fate,
Like Ge Hong’s way, a home in every height.
The crimson-gold casket hides books most rare,
The jade-green flask keeps wine forever there.
The return to court may yet be delayed,
I come now, ready to laugh and sing in the shade.

**The Immortal Crag Temple**

Still near the immortal realm, the crag stands high,
Yet what year did the true hall fall to weeds?
Today I reach the temple’s sacred ground,
And even the old black crane returns in flight.
A single stream, like molten glass, flows bright,
A thousand peaks of purple-green arise in sight.
Deep in the night, the Chan monks sit with me,
The full moon at the window lingers free.

**On Wang Jingxuan’s Sleep**

All sounds hush as the moon fills empty space,
A single move decides the game—old Xuan’s grace.
The golden flask drained of the village’s wine,
The jade spindle sings of the primal time.
I envy my sleepless self, spirit clear,
Yet laugh at his slumber, so deep, so near.
Turn and tell the lone cloud on the Dao’s way:
Purity and turbidity differ by nature’s sway.

**In Response to Prefect Zhou**

Seek quiet in quietude, where quiet may be found,
Pines and bamboo silent, green through autumn’s round.
From beyond the world, your kindness often descends,
How fortunate the mountain’s edge your visit sends.
Sweet grass by the curtain grows long in the court,
A thousand-year-old book on the bridge is sought.
Delighted to retire here in the south’s embrace,
Profound talks deepen gratitude for the sage’s grace.

**Benzhu Hermitage**

When the mood strikes, I climb the highest peak,
True wind ever present, the climb within reach.
In the world’s muddy midst, who still trusts the pure?
Beyond the clouds, how could one idle, demur?
Strange rocks poised to fly, bright and stark,
Startling rapids rush down with a roar’s arc.
The common eye may never see this sight,
But the perfected walk here in hidden light.

**Mengqin Hermitage**

At the Purple Court, a noble guest leaves traces rare,
A single-log bridge spans each crossing there.
Since the whole household grasped the Supreme Ultimate,
Who else could step in tandem through the azure air?
Before the balustrade, strange trees stay green through winter,
Beneath the crag, the numinous light glows red at night.
True blessing does not fade with the world’s decline,
Those beyond the dust enter the divine.

**Pinggai Hermitage**

The ancients have gone, riding dragons’ scales,
Yet their spirit lingers, recorded true in rolls.
At the cave’s mouth, they once bowed thrice to the sun,
Amid the clouds, a springtime all their own unfolds.
The fishing line nears not—turtle and fish stay still,
Woodsmen forget their schemes—tiger and leopard thrill.
The golden well has known no fresh-drawn water,
Yet not a speck of dust clouds the heart’s pure quarter.

**Yuntai Hermitage**

Men of Han once soared with the Dao’s flight,
Everywhere their traces mark stillness’ height.
Peach blossoms beyond the world are no common breed,
Cypress seeds in the wind retain their fragrance freed.
A staff parts the emerald mist to deep halls,
A boat rides the vast waves into the boundless.
Eighteen hundred years, thirty generations past,
The cloud terrace stands empty, jade pendants cast.

**Jinkou Hermitage**

Truth upon truth, nurturing true talent,
Ten thousand trees deep, a single stream bent.
Pearls gleam, night brightens autumn waves at rest,
Chimes hold frost’s tone as dawn’s glow is dressed.
The two immortals have long since departed—who meets?
Three grains remain, awaiting my feet.
If the Blue Lad were sent to inspect the traces,
No smoke, no shadow would mar the mossy places.

**Houcheng Hermitage**

Beside the long river, the altar stands near,
Beyond the altar, the river’s edge draws near.
Cinnabar in the earth stays warm through winter’s cold,
Jade bamboo forms a forest, chilled when night grows old.
The water crane longs for realms beyond form’s sight,
The mountain elder’s brows know no sorrow’s blight.
The staff already points to the rosy dawn,
Yet fine dust’s net still binds me on and on.

**Gongmu Hermitage**

An ancient altar veiled in ten thousand pines,
I came expressly seeking truth in these confines.
Wild clouds drift open on the green riverbank,
Sparse rain scatters through the verdant woods’ rank.
The true chart did not fall from a former dynasty’s hand,
A humble robe may yet grasp the ancient sage’s stand.
The crane’s carriage passed near the resting place,
Peach blossoms and flowing water still hold their grace.

**Pinggang Hermitage**

A thousand pines, ten thousand bamboos shade the true shrine,
How many seekers of truth forget to return in time?
Stone pillows and pond terraces remain as of old,
Cloud-piercing streams and valleys fly swift and cold.
The dark ape’s cry echoes through the long night,
The yellow crane soars high into the Great Tenuity’s light.
Since the Six Heavens have long been still and vast,
What age has not turned back to the sacred at last?

**Zhubu Hermitage**

Morning’s glow and evening’s haze both fade away,
Yet no carriages or caps send dust in disarray.
Of old, I heard of the thousand-year herb’s seed,
Now one or two recluses here take heed.
The colored phoenix often comes to seek bamboo’s fruit,
The numinous birds now and then peck the immortal’s root.
How grand the riders of old who spurned the light,
Could they have coveted the five-horse cart’s might?

**Yuju Hermitage**

In the seat’s corner, a lingering fragrance stays,
Awe remains as if the master were here always.
Bamboo and stone together rise to the gate of heaven,
A golden spring flows on, vast and uneven.
Through subtle discourse, delusion’s path is cleared,
Pointing directly to the nothingness of home, revered.
In this declining age, who can grasp even a part?
Days follow the senses, ever more harried the heart.

**Beiyu Hermitage**

The full-moon altar transforms the palace to spring,
Through a thousand ages, the willows by the ford still cling.
The blue pool brooks no worldly thing’s birth,
Would the jade brush ever show itself to the herd?
In quiet seeking, I’ve pledged with the Three Mysteries’ might,
In tranquil joy, who knows the one point’s light?
A pure journey beyond the world may be compared,
Hoofprints erased, incense dust softly shared.

**Forty-Eight Poems on the Golden Elixir**

The golden crucible’s dark pearl works its midnight art,
Five hues swirl, filling the chamber’s part.
Only because sun and moon conjoin and blend,
Do tortoise and snake take turns to contend.
At first, the form seems hazy, indistinct,
With time, the visage grows dim, indistinct.
The cinnabar tells the yang man’s way:
This true emptiness is not empty, they say.

**Forty-Eight Poems on the Golden Elixir** *(continued)*

Should false practitioners ask of myriad arts,
Seek only the Purple Gold Elixir’s heart.
On Kunlun’s peaks, towers rise so high,
In the Northern Sea’s crucible, dragon and tiger vie.

This medicine, the treasure most refined,
When wrought, ascends to heavenly kind.
The Jade Emperor’s golden decree descends,
Then cloud-lined paths are no hard road to wend.

The vulgar throng, lost in delusion’s sway,
Seek others’ aid yet shun the self’s own way.
They crave the world’s endless, fleeting hues,
Forgetting mortal flesh its bounds must lose.

When the crucible’s elixir life extends,
Drowned gold in water to light dust descends.
Beneath the northern mound’s dark earth they lie—
All lost souls who failed to wake and fly.

Unnoticed, years slip past like fingers’ trace,
Swift as the tide that turns the river’s race.
Few know the crucible’s sun and moon’s embrace,
Yet many grasp the world’s yin-yang’s face.

All for wealth they mar their true nature’s grace,
For women’s charms they drift with time’s base chase.
Half tread the path that leads to the Yellow Springs’ door,
Yet squander their essence to ghosts evermore.

How laughable, fools by desire entwined,
Who hoard their breath, their vital force confined!
The immortals’ Way is pure and still,
While lust and stench are but the world’s ill.

How can the foul and vile aspire so high?
Only the Returned Elixir grants the sky.
The arts of the bedchamber spread in vain,
Beguiling countless souls again and again.

When did the Yin-Gathering Elixir arise?
Even Liu Zhen of Later Han met his demise.
Bound still to the wheel of return they spin,
How can lust’s folly profit the dull within?

The dog’s wild antics deemed a wondrous art,
Yet ghosts and spirits’ schemes deceive the heart.
How much finer the Way of quiet non-doing’s might,
Where one crucible’s gold nurtures the Infant Bright!

The Infant’s crown blooms with lotus fair,
Yet falsehoods swarm like hemp, a tangled snare.
They speak not of refining from one crucible’s core,
But claim three carts’ conveyance bears the lore.

The Mud Pill Palace’s path steams clear,
The Purple Court’s boundless worth none may compare.
To guide the lost in dust’s bewildering maze,
Seek the root’s truth—no need for vain laments’ haze.

Hasten to find a master, point to water and gold,
Follow the fire’s time to gather the floating and cold.
Nine reflections reveal the Tathāgata’s face,
Twelve years unfold the Recluse’s heart’s embrace.

The empty chariot’s lead is swiftly won,
Yet mercury’s dragon-car resists the sun.
Since first I drank the nectar’s sweet delight,
I’ve dwelt deep in the Purple Court’s pure height.

This fleeting life, a dream’s restless stir,
How few turn back to seal the Three Passes’ door!
The Yellow Dame steadies—easy the parting’s art,
Yet the White Tiger’s flight tests the seeker’s heart.

The Vermilion Bird enters the furnace, three acres still,
The Dark Turtle guards the crucible, a life at will.
This luminous mystery I’ve come to know,
Yet hide its mechanism in the old mountains’ glow.

Speak not of immortal bones, nor seek the Elixir’s flame,
This principle is profound, its proper gate the same.
Few lost ones know to turn back to the root,
Yet this teaching plants the seed as truth’s firm foot.

Tortoise and snake, great and small, must often feed,
The sun and moon’s essence wholly consume with speed.
Only when a true master reveals the way,
Can the wilds’ barrows not claim your clay?

The immortals’ wondrous work is hard to spy,
Many learn the Way yet lose it to desire’s lie.
If you can grasp fire and water’s truth at last,
Then east and west at last stand clear and vast.

Mix not true lead with common lead’s alloy,
Nor rank the true wife with the world’s decay.
When Kan and Li unite, the body finds peace,
Only in sloth do husband and wife cease.

The Yellow Sprout’s treasure—speak not lightly,
The White Snow’s mystery—dare not slight it.
Not that I hoard this secret in rustic guise,
But the immortals’ medicine the vulgar despise.

Floating and sinking, the Mao-You path divides,
Transformation’s gate for tortoise and snake abides.
Of ten thousand students, scarce one or two,
Yet false "Dao-friends" fill the earth anew.

Preserve the spirit, know your original face,
This subtle principle may yet be learned apace.
When the leakless is complete, the leaking ends,
The ford of delusion crossed, the true ford begins.

Mortal life scarce grants a thousand years’ span,
Yet the immortal realm turns ten thousand springs with ease.
How pitiful, the lost in endless maze,
Who gladly cast their spirits to the northern dust’s haze!

Some turn to Buddha, then to immortals’ lore,
Two paths they grope, yet neither explore.
Most err in paths that lead to confusion’s snare,
And see how swiftly the lost change and fare.

Refine the medicine within your own frame,
Foolish to seek the lotus in the flame.
Seek only the self, seek life’s true thread,
Not the three thousand or the great thousand’s spread.

The Black Dragon and the Tiger’s Ford are not hard to part,
Begin with the gate of settled spirit’s art.
When White Snow is refined to match sun and moon,
When Yellow Sprout is consumed, you’ll rise beyond the rune.

Within the Four Spirits’ crucible, death may flee,
In the Five Colors’ nectar, the soul returns to thee.
How many oysters in the world can boast such might?
Lose not your root to wealth or beauty’s blight.

Swiftly discern the floating gold in water’s tide,
If you refine it well, even ghosts will abide.
The Four Spirits guard the sacred furnace tight,
Nine revolutions deepen the elixir’s light.

Dragon and tiger reverse their paths to meet,
Tortoise and snake rise in flames, fierce and fleet.
When the Five Colors swirl in radiant display,
The chamber glows to illuminate the way.

The Zhou Tian’s fire-timing fools the common kind,
Even Embryonic Breath’s coils are not refined.
In the Purple Court, gold gathers, dragon’s fire seed,
On Kunlun’s slopes, jade flows, tiger’s spring runs freed.

Where the Three Lotuses break, the spirit’s power divides,
When the One Child is born, the dust’s bonds subside.
To all who rush and strive in vain pursuit,
True lead and true mercury never leave the root.

Within Kunlun’s halls, the Purple Gold Elixir gleams,
Not for mortal eyes—only the immortal’s dreams.
If fate grants you a share to extend your span,
Naturally free from hunger and cold’s ban.

Tiger and dragon, lead and mercury in the Geng-Xin crucible’s glow,
Great and small tortoise and snake on the Taiyi altar’s show.
When one pill is wrought, five hues take flight,
Heaven’s message is no hard thing to recite.

This toiling life speeds by like a shuttle’s throw,
Hasten to refine the true, the demons to outgo.
Turn the floating and sinking in the Northern Sea’s vast tide,
Lose not yourself to dreams in Nanke’s shade.

In the Jia-Geng crucible, gold is not few,
In the Mao-You altar, earth is plentiful too.
Yet when the chamber blazes with radiant light,
Purify your heart, consume it—freedom’s in sight.

Chasing fleeting fame and profit’s hollow gain,
Heed not how swiftly time steals youth again.
Dazzled by beauty’s bloom before your eyes,
Unseen, your temples whiten with surprise.

The sturdy crucible extends life’s thread,
Yet passion’s reckless indulgence mars the true instead.

I urge you to seek the elixir’s secret art,
Nurture the infant within to transcend the dusty world.
How swiftly fleeting are these glimpses of light—
Born and reborn, the wheel turns without cease.

All for greed and delusion’s trifling cause,
Yet none think to still the heart and cultivate the true.
Tiger and dragon serve as chariots to ascend the sky,
Lead and mercury are the boat to leave this world behind.

How many immortals pity the common folk,
Leaving the elixir’s formula to save the mortal stream.
Ride the dragon, mount the crane—no need for fear,
For this is the golden pill’s singular power.

Five-hued cloud-dragons rise from the sea’s depths,
Nine-fold wind-tigers soar to the celestial court.
Where jade blossoms meet, observe the ren and gui,
When the purple palace unites, rely on bing and ding.

This truth is not for lesser minds to grasp,
Unless your name is the Star of Lesser Brilliance.
This toiling life speeds by swift as wind,
Hasten to slay the Three Corpses and Five Worms.

Let not the fox and fox-spirit steal the crucible’s treasure,
But bid the dragon and tiger guard the true void.
Within the crucible’s precious vessel, tend the fire in time,
And the infant in your belly will grow ever more radiant.

Good men and women, heed these words,
Lest you drown in wine and lust’s delusion.
Most strange and wondrous things beguile the seeker,
At the first glimpse of wanton desire, the heart stirs.

It is but the song that pours out the body’s treasure,
How can the gold in water remain firm?
The path to heaven stands open, yet none tread it,
The gates of hell are barred, yet crowds rush in.

I send this message to the men and women of the world:
Withdraw your steps from the burning house, hide in the mountain forest.
For those who indulge in excess, the Lord is watchful,
Condemning them to become foxes and beasts, tails trailing behind.

They say five hundred years must pass before transformation,
Yet who knows that in three thousand days the spirit is remade?
Where the thunder’s fire is put to use,
Dog and fang alike serve as kin in this teaching.

The fox-spirits, kin to vengeful demons,
Assume bewitching forms to lead many astray.
The tales of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao are far from true—
Today, let the wise ponder this deeply.

Mistaking the celestial palace for lust’s domain,
They fill the purple court with deceit and guile.
The pure struggle of the cave admits no impurity,
While the dark recesses of the grotto breed strange wonders.

How deeply deluded are the people of this world,
How many have lost their lives to fox-spirits?
By the altar of Master Zi, near the Purple Tenuity,
In the deep of night, the wind’s light is falsely praised.

They speak not of seeking lead to prolong life,
But claim mere herbs can extend the years.
The immortal elixir need not be sought beyond the body,
Why place it before the door like a household god?

Perhaps a mountain spirit has beguiled you,
Making you see杂色 as commonplace.
True lead and true mercury are most trustworthy,
Yet this truth, though clear, is seldom practiced.

In the White Tiger’s crucible, jade nectar forms,
Surpassing the serpent’s palace where golden essence is nurtured.
Kan’s man and Li’s woman stand in threefold array,
Sun and moon, east and west, unite in one journey.

If you find the path within this,
The infant’s visage will naturally take shape.
The golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,
Yet most mortals are easily led astray.

If the red serpent soars north of the sea,
The jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.
The Lotus Messenger wields the true water,
The Fire Dragon King opens the great path.

Turn your efforts to refining within this,
Flight and ascent lie in but a single *daogui*.
Fortunate is the one who grasps the profound truth of cultivation,
Diligently refining the gold within the water.

If you know the purple court’s lotus can be planted,
You will believe the path to Kunlun can be found.
Sun and moon unite, their light above and below,
After white and blue merge, colors float and sink.

Since gaining this true message,
The world’s glory and shame no longer touch me.
Why waste youth studying poetry and books,
When seeking the true preserves the jade flask?

No need to weary the spirit wandering the Red Waters,
Simply know how to preserve your nature and nurture the mysterious pearl.
Who in this world possesses the crucible’s sun and moon?
The furnace’s cinnabar is unknown to the age.

Men laugh at the solitude of this path,
Yet this solitude differs from the world’s.
Once awakened to this life and the next,
Why cling to empty talk of Chan?

The Flower Pool’s water is called the elixir of ascent,
The golden crucible’s lotus is the key to leaving the world.
Only when you delve into its wonders do you begin to know,
And when the work is complete, you see the mystery’s depth.

Since receiving the enlightened master’s guidance,
I have come to trust the cloud chariot’s escape from the dusty shore.
The three passions’ gates stand open without suspicion,
Yet it is the common folk who refuse to enter.

Moon’s essence and sun’s spirit form the path,
Tiger’s spring and serpent’s fire serve as ladder and go-between.
Tend diligently to the three fields to secure the primordial seed,
Firmly seal the crucible, opening it only later.

From formlessness, form naturally arises,
The true embryo can unbind the spirit’s knot.
The Crimson Bridge’s qi-circulation is all in vain—
It is the common folk who cling to appearances and stray.

The Northern Sea’s crucible divides creation,
The Southern Darkness’ palace aligns with heaven’s principle.
Emptiness and nothingness are achieved through the returning elixir’s power,
In the indistinct, the body becomes one with the wondrous Dao.

If you can perceive this within the floating life,
Then floating life is but a fermenting brew.
Countless Dao companions fill the dusty world,
Yet how few bear true names, how few are real?

Failing to grasp that mercury and lead are supreme treasures,
They turn to the furnace and crucible to smelt silver.
Within lies the true method for gathering the medicine,
Without, they seek the elixir in vain toil.

How much worse for those lost on the path,
Who not only mislead themselves but others as well.
Beneath the Nine Perfections Mountain lies the Flower Pool,
Its waters prolong life, yet the world remains unaware.

Golden tangerines grow there, radiant in hue,
Small as pellets, yet rainbow clouds take flight.
Sent to the Northern Sea’s depths for safekeeping,
Carried to the Southern Culmen, where strange wonders unfold.

Only when the work within this is complete,
Will yellow clouds, piece by piece, embrace the infant.
Upon the Nine Perfections Mountain rise towers and terraces,
Where sun and moon float above, purple qi amassed.

From the Northern Sea’s depths, golden peonies bloom,
From the Southern Culmen’s palace, jade roses emerge.
The Three Clarities’ gates hold the three fields’ secrets,
Nine cycles of effort trace ninefold returns.

When this priceless treasure is refined,
Let others laugh at my foolish toil.
Restlessly seeking masters, wearily rushing about,
All for the divine water that is the immortals’ homeland.

A single crucible glows with molten gold,
Three fields gleam with jade-like nectar.
At midnight, only the true fire coils,
In the chamber, unnoticed, rainbow light shines.

A single grain transcends the mundane—how weighty it is!
Only then do I trust the path to Penglai is long.
The great medicine in the crucible is unknown to the world,
As sun and moon both descend, conception is not lost.

Not only the wondrous light of the fire-jujube,
But the profound principle called the "intertwined pear" is sought.
The golden elixir’s bone-transmuting power does not deceive,
Yet most mortals’ natures are easily led astray.

If the red serpent soars north of the sea,
The jade hare will naturally run to the western sky.
The Lotus Messenger wields the true water,
The Fire Dragon King opens the great path.

Turn your efforts to refining within this,
Flight and ascent lie in but a single *daogui*.

The flowing crimson powder scatters clouds afar,
The profound divine radiance fills the chamber whole.
Twelve years of refining—at last it is complete,
Then riding the phoenix-carriage, one ascends the heavenly ladder.

For decades I concealed my traces from the world,
Lest the crowd discover the seed planted in the cinnabar field.
The Five Phases gather in an instant,
A single orb of perfect clarity emerges of itself.

The divine crucible glows with pristine white snow,
The leaden cauldron gently pours forth crimson lotus.
Of late, I’ve grown unaware of fleeting fame,
Yet many come to knock, seeking the wondrous mystery.

Having ingested the golden elixir, bones and hair grow light,
Then Penglai’s journey seems but a measured path.
The clarified alchemical furnace yields jade powder,
The frozen qi-sea pierces the Three Clarities.

Kunlun’s palaces rise higher year by year,
The Purple Court’s towers are built anew each day.
With this, one may ride the cloud-crane chariot,
Laughing at those who mock the pursuit of immortality.

Many study the Dao, few awaken to truth,
Yet when truth is realized, one sees one’s own true self.
The Three Fields’ paths stretch far and wide,
All things transform without cause or reason.

Within earth, gold is nurtured—its hue grows deep,
Within the crucible, the fire’s work is ever renewed.
If one remains unmoved by wealth or sensual desire,
One is already a dweller within Penglai’s grotto.

Enduring humiliation through days of bitter toil,
Shutting the door, yet ghosts still steal one’s essence.
Unknowing that the cinnabar field’s lock was not secure,
How can one prevent the soul’s madness from toppling the Purple Court?

Yang-qi swiftly wanes, life is hard to preserve,
Yin-demons gradually grow, easily depleting one’s forces.
I urge you—hasten to seek a master,
Lest malevolent spirits shatter your Daoist resolve.

One sees only the divine furnace at midnight,
Yet knows not how the fire’s power scatters yin-demons.
Suddenly, within the golden crucible, cold jade congeals,
And in an instant, the true body manifests in rainbow radiance.

From the vast blue dew, white snow is distilled,
Within the Flowery Pond’s waters, the yellow sprout is nurtured.
Here, one beholds the true message,
Do not recklessly chase after the deer-cart.

If one possesses the golden elixir, the soul may return,
Yet the deluded, lost in the Dao’s current, fail to swallow it.
When the vermilion bird opens the cliffside earth,
The white deer must enter the sea’s hidden gate.

To attain this, first tame the qi-steed,
Ever hasten to restrain the heart-monkey.
Good men and women, seek the true formula,
Do not let your form decay into a mound of earth.

In silent meditation, with incense burning,
Within each thought, one must see one’s own form.
Life’s origin lies in lead’s mercury,
Transformation’s source is the dragon within fire.

Do not shirk the frequent gathering of two and eight,
Or the arduous union of one and three.
Here lies the path that leads to heaven,
Where one may follow Red Pine’s dusty traces.

Do not scorn the rustic adept’s subtle revelation,
For it connects the virtuous to the highest path.
Those who awaken do so at these words,
The deluded remain lost in their own thoughts.

When *jia* and *geng* part, the dragon returns to the left,
When *mao* and *you* unite, the tiger stands in the west.
If you perceive the mystery within the mystery,
You will find it inseparable from the true husband and wife.

My body, my life, align with heaven,
Only the golden elixir can lead one out of delusion.
The numinous essence ever dwells in the jade palace,
The sacred embryo, once formed, steps upon the cloud-ladder.

Why cling to the world of clams and oysters?
Why carry the silkworm’s woven robes?
Though refining demands the labor of sun and moon,
To transcend the dust, one need only a single *daogui*.

*Dian Jiang Chun*
Youling inquired: "Why does the gourd I carry never open its mouth?"
Composed in response to the imperial presence.

A tiny gourd,
born small, its stature low.
Its seeds lie within—
how can one blame it for having no mouth?
It holds heaven and earth—
who understands this principle?
Hung at the waist,
I cherish it all the more.
It surpasses the golden fish pouch.

*Recalling Peach Blossom Spring: Two Poems*
Cai Shiyuan doubted me, Shenweng, and Shichen.

Shiyuan posed a question: "What is the extension of cultivation and refinement?"
I dashed off a brief lyric in reply.

The words of long life are passed mouth to mouth,
seeking the golden elixir in its fullness.
Blending into one, becoming an immortal—
I explain it earnestly to the worthy.

Do not swallow qi,
do not recklessly transmit it—
how could one fathom the mystery of creation?
Use lead to cast into mercury, mercury into lead,
clearly inverted, again and again.

Within the piled white clouds, pluck the lotus,
each branch fragrant and richly lush.
By the shore of the numinous tortoise, auspicious winds arise,
a tower of twelve stories high.
The golden hall,
veiled in azure clouds,
cinnabar glows crimson through the crown.
Where the divine mechanism turns, ghosts and spirits commune—
the pure and true ascend to the highest palace.

*Lin Jiang Xian*
Deng Dafu released six cranes at Hunlun Hermitage and requested a poem.
Thus composed.

Do not wonder that the spirit is so plain and pale—
it fully comprehends the thousand-year pine’s crown.

The feathered immortals share a deep and kindred sorrow,
Earnestly vying to inscribe and compose,
Turning and tossing in responsive verse.
Moreover, there is the tale of the brothers of Xianyang,
Which makes one forget all cares upon hearing it.
My life has ever been marked by the signs of transcendence—
Once the brush was set to paper,
The flow could not be halted.

*Qin Yuan Chun* (Three Poems)
*Subduing Demons and Establishing Order*

As the kalpic cycle renews,
Heavenly scriptures descend with grace,
The sagely master commands the demons.
Now yin and yang are disordered,
Ghosts and spirits confounded,
Relying on cities,
Stretching across mountains and rivers.
Murderous qi chokes the sky,
Yin’s countenance usurps the day,
The myriad people suffer calamity, day after day.
Above Qingcheng,
A lapis lazuli throne appears,
Suddenly rising, towering and majestic.
The demonic hordes, enraged, brandish their weapons,
Vying to rush and attack the mountain like shuttles in a loom.
At the flash of divine radiance,
Dragons are subdued, tigers trapped;
At the thunderous roar of awe-inspiring sound,
Lightning strikes, thunder rebukes.
Order is established to transform the people,
Evil is gathered and returned to rectitude,
Life flourishes in harmony, enjoying great peace.
The winds and clouds grow still,
Revealing the heavens merging with the azure vastness,
The moon bathing in limpid waves.

*Again*

The True Unity endures forever,
One with the Great Void,
The wondrous gate opens of itself.
Since the primordial chaos first divided,
The Two Modes arrayed their scenes,
Returning again to the root,
To the golden register and the numinous terrace.
Vast qi surges forth,
The Valley Spirit nurtures transformation,
Gradually, the divine radiance is felt coming from the void.
In the most secluded depths,
One hears the dragon’s chant, the tiger’s roar,
Suddenly—wind and thunder.

How wondrous, the subtle Dao is hard to fathom,
Yet by refining the foolish, great talents are made.
Let me plainly reveal to you its form—
The clam holds the moon in the deep,
The autumn hare carries its embryo.
Men and women of lofty resolve,
High-minded scholars of old—
Do not let body and mind be sullied by worldly dust.
When merit is complete,
Freely dwell in the Purple Court,
Your name inscribed on the immortal ranks.

*Again*

Hasten to cultivate the Way,
For on close reckoning, how much time does a human life hold?
Though you may possess a thousand charms,
A myriad graces—what avail?
One morning, death comes,
And all must be cast aside.
Suddenly reflecting,
The great matter of life and death
Strikes my heart like a blade unsheathed.
Hard to detain—
The golden crow’s arrows fly swift,
The jade hare’s shuttle weaves fast.
Awaken early, let not fate deceive you,
In purity, who can match my youthful bride?
Even if in the moon’s embrace,
The Lady of the Moon were yours to command,
Or in Yue, the fairest of the land—
This fleeting romance,
I have no heart to cherish.
With a broad mind and open mouth, avoid strife.
Rely on Penglai’s might,
When the three thousand deeds are fulfilled,
Ride alone back in triumph.

*Lin Jiang Xian*
*In Reply to Yuan Gui*

All creatures endowed with life receive Heaven’s gift,
In carefree nature, their original share is one.
Let no heterodox views disturb my true essence.
Here and now, the inner master abides,
Wholly merged with transformation as human.

No more need for subtle words, so clear to the core—
Even light dust would find no cause to cling.
Only when this is attained does spirit congeal.
A hundred demons all cease their strife,
The six paths forever halt their turning.

*Man Ting Fang*

In leisure, refine your skill,
Within the wondrous workings of non-being,
Take care not to speculate or ponder.
Dragon descends, tiger submits,
True earth emerges from central yellow.
In movement, rest, sleep, and diet,
Follow the current, never stir true yang.
At the root’s return,
Spirit congeals, pulse stills,
And from the jade realm, celestial light arises.

When winds rise high, the roc’s wings soar far;
When waters run deep, the boat glides on—
Such is the principle of all things, manifest and clear.
Simply illuminate the heart, for that is the Dao,
Devote yourself wholly, and Heaven will reveal.
Idly summon spirits or call forth ghosts,
Pray for rain or sunshine—this is no madness.
Yet the deluded,
Though thunder and wind lie in their grasp,
Turn their use awry.

*Lin Jiang Xian*
*In Reply to Yuan Gui, After Reading Yang Xi’s Biography*

Since ancient times, the pure and numinous descend in wondrous ways,
Lady An came to Master Yang.
Their karmic meeting was beyond common bonds.
For a time, immortal airs took form,
Yet the true Dao has no kin.

Only Yuan Gui could seek and inquire,
Deeply sharing this intent.
All should together appreciate and compose new verses,
Lest dust-bound scholars
Mock the celestial beings.

*Man Ting Fang*
*To the Tune of the Perfected One, Harmonizing with Yuan Gui’s Rhyme*

Mind and realm both pure,
Joy shared across ancient and modern,
Noble paths—do not say they lack a guide.
The celestial gate stands lofty and wondrous,
Only the utmost person may open it.
How could this compare to ordinary sentiments?
In the square inch of the heart,
Not a speck of dust is stored.
Still, one must trust—
Gold firm, stone unyielding,
A single resolve never wavers.

True origin,
Truly lovable,
True teacher, true friend,
Rejoice in their guilelessness.
Among them, even more free and untrammeled,
Careless of form and frame.
Yet is this not solemn awakening?
Relying on true essence,
Transforming the mortal frame.
When the numinous meets,
The world’s snares of dust—
Speak not of their origins.

*Dong Xian Ge*

Atop the solitary peak’s summit,
None can reach.
Ten thousand miles of empty space, boundless and vast.
In autumn’s high, still scene,
Mists roll back, clouds withdraw,
Wind and dew enfold—
Only the moon’s radiance shines high.
Fleeting life, a passing traveler,
In fine weather, a fair night,
Drunk with dance and wild song, mistaking dusk for dawn.
Who knows the one nature,
Perfect as the Ganges,
In an instant—eternal,
Light ageless?
Yet they vie to face the moon,
Debating profit, discoursing fame,
Never thinking of the fleeting shadow,
Stealthily hastening youth away.

*Yu Jia Ao*
*Composed Over Wine for Jie Fu*

Hastily the cup is raised to share a laugh,
A life of illness and suffering thus passes.
Friendship and righteousness run deep as earth.
Hearts illumine each other—
Let no one of today
Be mocked by those of old.

Lamps flicker softly in the quiet mountains,
Orchid’s fine fragrance, pine and bamboo flourish.
Finding ease beyond the dusty world,
Incense just begins to rise—
Neighboring roosters, hold back
From hastening the clear dawn.

*Geng Lou Zi*
*Harmonizing with Yuan Gui’s "Hall of Celestial Harmony"*

By primordial essence,
Seal the mouth, turn the gaze inward—
Beyond things, the body finds no ground for death.
Zi Jie’s errors,
Ji Zhen’s faults:
Non-action twisted into action.

Only empty the heart,
Fill the belly,
And secretly merge with the vast heavens as one.
Huayang Cave,
Guanghan Palace—
All lie within the square inch of every mind.

*[Hai Qian Ying]*
*Two Poems*
*Inscribed on the Wall of Guo Nanzhong’s Hermitage*

Deep in the hidden ravine,
I ask the cowherd, the woodcutter boy—
Both lose their way.
Wilderness tangled with reeds,
Serpents and dragons rise and vanish,
Jade Gorge plunges into empty paths.
No craving for wild-goose pagodas’ glory,
Only keeping to the fish’s cold, pure abyss.
This toil—
Hold fast, and the gods themselves will shield you.

Sudden awakening,
No turning back—
A single spark of emptiness,
Ten thousand kalpas without past or present.
The root of embryonic breathing runs deep,
The spirit spring’s cave is secret,
In stillness, the Yang fire is nurtured and tuned.
Ask not of earth’s endurance or heaven’s span—
Simply gather causes to bear fruit.
Do not squander,
For I reveal to you the true foundation of the Celestial Valley.

*Again*

Passions coil, knowledge binds.

Alas for those of this age who fail to awaken—
true joy lies in the wine.
Unbridled speech invites transgression,
deluded minds lose their conduct,
yet they claim it was the maddening draught’s fault.
Know well that in drunken dance and wild song,
there too resides innate knowing and true awareness.
Unmoored,
as warmth circulates freely,
through the Three Passes and Three Meridians.

Fallen and carefree,
a wanderer of leisure—
deep in the realm of intoxication,
wind and moon ever repay the drunk.
Empty blossoms’ tidings,
radiant and revealed,
self and other—all forgotten.
No need to ask of market brews or village ferments,
simply sip lightly, pour low.
Yet they scorn and deride,
vying to speak of sobriety,
each word a mistake.

*Embroidered Needle Fixed*

Snowy night, fishing boat,
evening wind subsides.
I myself pole the skiff,
gliding with the current to watch the snow.
Mountains rise like jade peaks,
forests stand as silver trees,
high and low—no distinction remains.
The heart’s nature, clear and limpid,
with not a single old friend to speak to.
Suddenly, this floating life
seems to dwell in heaven’s halls,
a palace of crystal.

All sounds and shadows of the dust-world cease.
Piercing emptiness without bounds,
water and sky merge.
Vast qi surges and fills,
true work runs deep and thick—
through the long night, no fear of biting cold.
Ashamed of my own paltriness,
knowing only how to chase warmth and heat.
I halt the oars and laugh,
entrusting all that matters
to the wild plum and river moon.

*Spring Comes from Heaven Above*

The crane cries, bearing the imperial decree.

The earth lies smooth as jade,
as the sea stills its waves,
mountains gather their clouds and mists.
The Three Radiance stand empty and bright,
the Eight Directions clear and pure—
one moon illumines all heavens.
From the flowing rosy dawn,
a sigh as pearl-like grains
slowly descend through boundless emptiness.
Beyond form and speech,
a thousand Perfected bow to the Pole Star,
ten thousand mysteries turn toward the Origin.

That night when the crane cried at midnight,
moved by the true talisman and sacred script,
he received the transmission in person.
Azure dragon-script shimmered,
crimson turtle-seals congealed,
and scarlet-robed beings—beasts without scales or wings—appeared.
When merit was complete and fruit attained,
the true teaching was bequeathed,
and the radiant immortals soared through the expanse.
A thousand years have passed,
yet the hundred-and-first lamp continues the flame,
its light boundless and bright.

*More Drops of Water*
(To the tune of the Perfected One)

Right or wrong—
both are struck down together,
lest they kindle the demon’s fire.
Speak of the conditioned,
and harm the stubborn void;
dwell instead in the midst of seeing and gazing.
The wind of sages and worthies
blows where it will—
why vie with cleverness and wit?
With poetry and wine,
let us seize this leisure,
laughing with verdant brows.

*Moon over the Jasper Terrace*
(Celebrating the Lantern Festival and Longevity)

Heaven unfolds its auspicious fate,
recalling the revival of the Han,
the resurgence of the fiery Liu.
In this meeting of enlightened sovereign and worthy minister,
the Eight Directions know wind and rain in harmony.
How rare the hour when the Sage was born in Shen,
just as the Yellow River ran clear for a thousand years!
Auspicious clouds embrace,
rosy dawn reflects.
Flying immortals bow,
the Star of Literature shines bright.
A felicitous sign—
for the Master’s true essence nurtures fortune,
and heaven and earth rejoice together.
The fragrance of roses fills the Lantern Festival’s scene,
while the divine light of Heaven’s Eye gleams like a mirror.
Manifesting dragon-pattern and phoenix-form,
he subdues all demons and returns them to the true.
Receiving the Primordial’s mandate,
he established the teaching and opened the way;
awakening to the supreme Dao,
the heart is empty and the spirit attains.
Flourishing the lineage,
illuminating the true realm—
together with non-being,
rejoicing in purity and stillness.
Everlasting,
he delivers the three paths and six destinies,
as immortals and gods bear witness together.

*Wind through the Pines*
(To the tune of Jie Fu)

Amid the inch-wide field, deep plowing and careful weeding—
behold the true hero.
Night after night, he ascends the star terrace,
never tiring of waters green and clouds red.
Such are his pure companions and plain-spoken friends,
often gazing at one another, smiling beneath the clear sky.

Jade steps and jasper chants layered in emerald,
with daylily lush and verdant.
Skilled in drinking the rosy dawn’s nectar, why refuse intoxication?
No need to count the thousand cups of worldly dust.
At dawn and dusk, he departs to face the origin—
how could he bear to abandon the pine of the great man?

*Cherishing the Fleeting Time*
*(To the tune of Dui Zhu Fu)*

Hollow-hearted, stalwart-stemmed, vying in grace and detachment,
by the balustrade winter and summer alike.
Frost-laden winds, snow-laden hues in deepening dusk—
yet never do the slender branches and delicate stems wither.
Within the heart’s intent lie the sorrows of dust and sand;
listen closely to the strings’ songs, swift and slow.
No disdain for the verdant green that opens the blue eye—
gazing together, as if accustomed to the Taiyuan family’s ways.

*Pure Serene Music*
*(Qing Ping Yue)*

Before heaven and after, the true earth conceals divine elegance.
Its wondrous workings naturally follow the fire’s timing,
steaming through each node until fully permeated.
No distinction between dragon musk, sandalwood, or aloes—
all enter the nose and penetrate the heart.
When the smoke’s message ceases,
the whole body transforms into true gold.

*Silken Canopy*
*(Su Mu Zhe)*
*(To the rhyme of Master Wu, harmonizing with Yuan Gui)*

Before heaven’s birth, after heaven’s long span,
the Dao holds its true canon—
listen closely to what was received then.
Just as one loses the sky and mistakes the Dipper for guidance,
fearing this frail form,
by ill fortune, may wither and decay.

*West River Moon*
*(Xi Jiang Yue)*
*(Again harmonizing)*

**Reed Door Open Wide**

The thatched door swings open to vast stillness,
the cold window’s jade gleam bathed in bamboo’s pure radiance.
A wind steals in through the five-fragrance curtain,
bringing yet another gift of fine sound.

Know this: even the tiniest may enter,
a luminous pearl cradled in the womb of forgetfulness.
Wild revels and night feasts—right or wrong?
The moon-palace immortals bear no shadow.

---

*Two Southern Village Songs*
*(Harmonizing with Yuan Gui)*

**I**
No help for these lost flocks,
bound fast in taste, hue, and sound.
Let them change heads, swap faces—what grief?
They’ll not be stained; then, they’ll not be heeded.

Spring departs, autumn returns—
do not let the twelve hours pass in vain jade.
Hold fast the true, wondrous essence of nature,
and cultivate. Dust’s toil is steep;
the Dao, how level.

**II**
Long absent from the spring terrace,
waiting to mount the nine heavens.
Too weary to ask others—deep meaning lies there—
amid dust and haze,
hard to ride the perverse winds and touch the sacred embryo.

The water-railed pavilion mirrors the mountain studio,
leisurely gazing until the head turns homeward.
Long since I’ve thanked old friends for their letters’ subtle intent—
how slight! How could I summon the zither at my waist,
sweep my sleeves, and come?

---

*Gazing at the South River*
*(Watching a Game of Chess)*

**Gazing at the South River**
*(Watching a Game of Chess, continued)*

The autumn board lies still—
black and white, two caskets evenly paired.
Mountains and waters best suit shared delight;
zither and books win the Dao’s close kinship.
Each game, each turn, renewed.

Beneath the pine’s shade,
how many springs have passed?
As fate allows, I’ve played my hand,
yet vying for first drains the spirit.
Ever do I secretly yield.

---

*Twelve Poems in Praise of Xiyuan*
*(Matching Yuan Gui’s Rhymes, with Preface)*

I have long admired Xiyuan—its cliffs rise sheer, free of vulgar form, its sparse pines and dense bamboos threading all directions, its verdant jade gleaming in radiant exchange. Heaven shaped these noble heights, and earth’s genius shines thus. Often we say to one another: *We dwell in the ruins of the Perfected Ones yet remain unaware.*

Ascending Playful Pearl Peak, I see tiger-crouching dragons leaping, distant walls and far ridges all beneath my gaze. Here I examine the site, erect a hall, and raise its inscribed plaque. Flowers in the water, vegetables in the garden, mountain light and fresh bamboo, the sunlit hut ever more serene—I have found my home.

Once, longing for return, I saw twelve verses in kindred voice and so harmonized with them.

---

**Xiyuan is fine—**
a transcendent’s structure crowns the transcendent peak.
One crane’s nature, pure, clears my dwelling;
ten thousand dragons’ wind and rain stir the frosty void.
Lofty, still, vast—too indolent for worldly care.

**Heaven and earth rejoice—**
mountains and waters flow in tranquil communion.
Walking, sitting, lying, I cherish scenes beyond the dust;
emptiness and silence are the Daoist’s way.
No trifling joy compares.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
dragon’s head and tiger’s brow rise high.
Wind and rain ever gladden the clear cosmos;
ridges and forests surge like waves.
Chanting and singing, I find my poetic boldness.

**Great joy is complete—**
its fair renown meets its fitting encounter.

At the pure altar of the Dipper, jade tablets are cast and feathered missives sent;
the Primordial is invoked in joyous assembly, golden blades held aloft.
Now my person stands apart from the world’s dust, free to scratch my head in ease.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
the cliffside lodge is hewn from pine, its beams weighed down with age.
Before the Five-Dipper Grotto, I pour jade-like wine in study;
half-drunk, beyond the window, I caress my golden cup.
Unburdened, I am at leisure.

**Emerald hues—**
jade bamboo newly planted.
Let the wind come, but spare the ancient trees from sway;
let the rain fall in season to wash the verdant moss.
Such is the vexation of a poet’s talent.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
spring days lengthen with the rising sun.
I care not to ask of the third-month’s scenes among men;
I ever long for the celestial realm of ten thousand flowers.
In secluded delight, I am momentarily wild.

**Laughter and song—**
vast, resounding hymns.
A thousand deeds vie in the wind-swept valley’s splendor;
when the threefold clouds return, moonlight bathes the forest.
The musk’s fragrance lingers like orchid.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
welcoming summer, I sprinkle the scorching winds.
By the red-brocade stones, a lone flute plays;
on Old Zhang’s crag, I linger among the clustered peaks.
At times, I grasp the rod that transforms into a dragon.

**The zither’s jade tones—**
dawn’s light leans upon the wutong tree.
Though age may tarnish my literary works, they flourish within the court;
mountains and rivers, forests and wild pavilions stand empty.
Crimson flames blaze bright within.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
the Daoist cherishes autumn’s scene.
When the season arrives, the heavens naturally turn solemn;
deep in the night, I still delight in the moon’s full radiance.
A long whistle presses down upon the azure peaks.

**Indeed, with wine—**
how hard it is to part from song’s edge.
Wherever firewood is felled for charcoal,
now is the time to taste the new rice and celebrate the harvest year.
The youths dance like embryonic immortals.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
winter’s pines stand amid the snow.
Hand in hand upon the stone altar, I receive the beloved scene;
in stillness, I watch heaven and earth enter the pure palace.
Just like the Great Mao Peak.

**Sleeves and hems tinkling—**
the zither’s case holds deep sentiment.
Before the Moon-Blowing Grotto, I hold jade within my lips;
the enchanting charm stirs, shifting to the Yellow Bell’s tone.
Emotions arise from within.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
the secluded path does not slope awry.
The mountain valley’s seclusion remains unchanged in hue;
the pond’s emptiness and stillness bear not a single flaw.
One fishes at the water’s edge.

**A small immortal barge—**
one longs to gaze upon your abode.
The returning oars turn with the sun, as if beholding a mirror;
the drifting boat descends with the stars, like riding a spindle.
Wind and rain scatter the cold sands.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
the divine grotto seeks its own accord.
By the water, fields are tilled as the mountain stream rushes;
hewing the mountain, a path is opened where tiny blossoms float.
Footprints of the old man remain.

**Forgetting the ten thousand things—**
the crisp qi gathers the white clouds.

The Director of Destinies once sought quiet repose,
Ziyang’s steps were truly light along the secluded path.
Longing to follow this master’s wanderings.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
one dwells within a palace of crystal.
Ever wishing the Jade Spring might cleanse the tripod,
just as Dragon Well reaches Celestial Peak.
Truly, a splendid legacy remains.

Pure to the depths,
how could it rival the flourishing of Li and Tang?
Naturally steeped, the rock’s clarity presses before the crag;
not confined, the mountain’s clouds drift beyond the heavens.
Limpid and luminous, it fills the heart.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
rain clears, the red gauze gathers.
Emerald waters still beckon the old angler;
green cliffs chill, rousing the fisherman’s home.
Spring tea is brewed beneath the canopy.

Wind vast and boundless,
brocade shadows grace the stone screen.
Above the cauldron, jade bamboo is struck;
westward, perch are drawn through crimson sands.
Ask not of joy’s distant shore.

**Xiyuan is fine—**
once more toward the western courtyard.
Watching evening chrysanthemums bloom beyond the square acre,
beside cold plum blossoms, six-petaled snowflakes take flight.
Three cranes arrive as one.

The world now clear,
emptiness alone is prized—non-action supreme.
Wearing the moon, the night still holds parting;
on the fragrant plain of Yu, no need to wander lost.
Here, one shakes out one’s robes and returns.

---

**Geng Lou Zi**
Again in rhyme to the Perfected One

Reciting the true scriptures,
hoping for ten thousand repetitions—
yet the fire of ignorance remains unquenched.
One should turn back,
explore true emptiness,
and melt into serene solitude.

Since ancient times, where do people abide?
Vainly clinging to fame and profit.
Cast off worldly burdens,
cultivate quiet leisure—
the elixir of jade preserves youth.

---

**Su Mu Zhe**
Embracing the lone zither,
plucking a short melody.
Seated alone in the secluded pavilion,
all day without a visitor.
Only delighting in rosy clouds, a long and proud whistle,
the bright moon and clear wind—
eternal friends of past and present.

Comprehending heaven and earth,
knowing yin and yang,
too weary to join the dusty toil,
the ceaseless race.
Loving to gaze high, the white day fades—
let others chase
the jade hare and golden crow.

---

**Jian Zi Mu Lan Hua**
Presented to Jianyi, Wang Jiefu

In the bitter cold of winter,
the sun’s return brought near-falling snow.
Pines vie with the clouds,
their towering forms in the pavilion sighing at late-withering.

The ancients hesitated,
entering the mountain forests’ depths.
Past and present align—
best to follow the reed pipes and songs, finding joy alone.

---

**Man Ting Fang**
Once more ascending...

**Regulating the Three Passes**

Regulating the Three Passes, harmonizing the four limbs,
in stillness, no care for the vexations of mutual strife.
In profound union with the Great Tenuity,
the Primordial Beginning speaks to the immortals.
The Jade Scriptures are re-edited, wondrous canons,
inscribed on the Western Terrace and Southern Peak, chapter by chapter.
Yet what is most revered—
the body’s field in this world,
the heart turned toward the Great Clarity of Heaven.

**Beyond the Clouds**
Once descended as a sage,
bowing at the golden altar by night,
a lofty chariot lingering in delay.
Discoursing on jade blossoms and divine nectar,
form and spirit made whole.
The body must rely on wondrous qi,
the spirit abides in the Yellow Court’s cinnabar field.
The true essence’s purport—
luminous radiance as aid,
heaven and earth preserving long life.

**Watching the River South**
*To Mingquan*

Autumn night’s affairs,
in the moon’s embrace, bamboo stands tall.
Clear echoes—with whom do they clamor over earth and water?
A gentle breeze sends me down the eaves’ pillars.
Waxing and waning—how could they bear emotion?

The Way of Zhongnan,
layered with laughter and song.
The cinnabar gate freezes at night, horses depart;
the Yellow River at dawn reflects a boat adrift.
Riding side by side, they come and go as one.

**Song of the River Spirit**

Colored clouds, pavilions, and auspicious mist settle.
Rain just cleared, the moon veils all in brightness.
Night still, celestial winds
blow down the strains of *Steps in the Void*.
Where do they ascend to court so late?
A pair of phoenixes, small,
and five clouds, light.

Falling flowers, flowing waters—two gates of feeling.
Resentment has no hold,
dreams refuse to form.
Leaning on every railing,
the Chu wind remains clear.
Dew drips from pine tips, the world hushed—
unfurling the precious seal,
reciting the *Yellow Court*.

**Magpie Bridge Immortal**
*To Mingquan*

Spirit clear, heart wondrous,
mountains long, waters distant—
what fate determines the year we meet again?
A single patch of cloud flies through the clear sky,
stirring in me boundless imagining.

One gate to transformation,
ninefold blossoms of grace and dew—
only wishing for a clear direction.
Bamboo winds often rise in the purple haze of the Northern Culmen,
as if with intent,
permitting a return home.

**Water Tune Prelude**
*The Master’s liberation in Sizhou, later manifesting in Qingcheng, bequeathing the truth to the Perfected Sa Shoujian.*

High Perfected leave wondrous instructions,
enlightened beings rescue the deluded masses.
Heart pure, conduct immaculate—
celestials, humans, the common and sacred, all turn in devotion.
Not in refining essence or moving qi,
not in soaring petitions or treading the Dipper,
but in a heart disordered by doubt.
Only rid falsehood and delusion,
the heart’s ground uniting with the divine.

Awakening to true emptiness,
breaking free from the world’s snares,
severing the mechanisms of the passes.
Nurturing my vast qi,
commanding thunder, dispatching lightning, shaking celestial might.
Merging the hundred spirits into one,
a single thought piercing heaven and earth—
only then is non-action fully realized.
With a shout, wind and rain arise,
aiding the world in an enlightened age.

**Six Songs of Ascending the Clear Dawn**

*First Watch, First Point*
The first watch begins,
city gates half-closed, wayfarers refine the elixir.
A thatched hut, carefree and unburdened,
a lone lamp’s light, pure and void.
The rush mat steadies the unrestrained body,
cross-legged in great stillness, the heart unmoving.
The moon’s wheel emerges from the sky’s edge,
a nameless pearl revealed in the emptiness.

*Second Watch, Second Point*
The second watch deepens,
palace bells fall silent, night sinks.
The bright moon fills the sky like molten gold,
sharing its light and shadow, no dusk or gloom.
Rising to idly pluck the stringless zither,
its ancient tones startle the heart.
The zither silenced, singing alone, chanting alone—
pine winds and mountain streams, all know the tune.

*Third Watch, Third Point*
The third watch at its height,
mist disperses, clouds withdraw, wind stills.
Moonlight bursts into the crystal palace,
all directions, above and below, one vast emptiness.
Radiance pervades, as in the land of Hua Xu,
through endless ages, no beginning, no end.
An iron serpent dances like a flowing rainbow,
riding backward on a white phoenix, roaming Kongtong.

*Fourth Watch, Fourth Point*
The fourth watch lengthens,
the Ox submits to the Rat, the heart untroubled.
The cinnabar furnace’s fire births new fragrance,
the host of yin stripped away, true yang restored.
The Metal Maiden and Wood Lad rejoice in harmony,
toasting in succession, cups never ceasing.
Host and guest reversed, yet no sorrow—
as the night wanes, parting still brings forgetfulness.

*Fifth Watch, Fifth Point*
The fifth watch wanes,
the azure void’s wind and dew press cold upon mortals.
Fusang pushes forth a red silver platter,
city gates stir once more with the clamor of the world.
The two luminaries of light and dark clash,
life and death interchanging in ceaseless flux.
Within the Daoist’s chamber, the heavens are vast—
the sun climbs three poles before the gate opens.

Alone I walk, alone I sit,
alone I sing, alone I harmonize.
Daily I pass through the streets,
I know not myself—who knows me?
The world’s dawn and dusk follow the four seasons,
but the mystery’s message does not shift.
Gaze upon the face—do you recognize it?
When you know, join the chorus: *luo luo li*.

**Spring in Qin Garden**
*Using Master Wu’s rhymes, presented to Yuan Gui*

Moreover, there is a level path,
straight through the mysterious pass,
as all attest.
May the ten thousand demons scatter,
all dusts dissolve in this moment;
the zither’s heart harmonious and refined,
heavenly nature pure and perfect.
Not trusting the common stream,
can the lofty step be turned back?
Clinging to form and sound, emotions stretch further.
The true message—
how to awaken it?
I speak briefly to the wise.

Though fate may turn green again,
the worldly scholar cannot but sigh.
Silence and focus for the wondrous,
leisure abundant, joy scarce;
once attained, carefree,
eternally free from worry’s searing.
Reflections gleam in the limpid pool,
echoes flow through the empty valley—
the karma-fire extinguished, all is the auspicious lotus.
Secure and peaceful,
firm as earth,
enduring as heaven.

**Eulogy**
*Eulogy for the Liberation in Sizhou, Winter of the Bingwu Year of Jingkang*

A bronze mirror, one face,
layers of green jade mountains.
Suddenly, the boat departs by night,
traces shifting to inquire of the grotto-heaven.
The precious hall’s incense clouds gather,
no one—yet the ten thousand images at ease.
Beneath the western mountains, the red sun,
mist and rain fall in silent streams.

*The Sixth Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Perfected Lord Xu Jing, the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, concludes here.*

*The Seventh Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of the Perfected Lord Xu Jing, the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, begins.*

**Five-Character Quatrains**

*Parrot*
Virtue’s numinous abode in five,
phoenix-crowned, fresh with radiance.
Mouth agape—
awakening those lost in dreams.

*Inscribed at the Elixir-Refining Cliff*
Cranes alight where pines host guests,
lichen fades, leaving stone unclothed.
This floating world—
white-haired old friends grow few.

*Playful Chant*
In the prime of my downfall,
all laugh at my madness.
Yet when I move—
the vast sea stretches boundless.

*Bamboo*
Rain passes o’er the riverbank’s prelude,
wind arrives, the courtyard railings clear.
Good friends abide—
into night, listening to autumn’s voice.

*Fan of the Forest Librarian*
Nine luan birds attend jade beasts,
eight phoenixes offer golden lingzhi.
The song is exquisite—
the Dark Maiden sings pure verses.

*Elder of Dongyang Grotto, Mount Qingcheng*
Seeking the ancient grotto of Qingcheng,
my name inscribed on the cinnabar terrace.
Daily reciting the *Yellow Court*,
auspicious clouds descend in response.

*Impromptu at the Rustic Pavilion*
Sun and moon—twin fireflies,
heaven and earth—a magpie’s nest.
The rustic pavilion has frost-sealed doors—
who dares knock idly?

---

**Six-Character Quatrains**

*Inscribed at the Pavilion of Contentment, Chongxian Abbey*
This nature originally void of all things,
even a drop of water is round and luminous.
Ask where the master finds contentment—
before the pavilion, moonlit and wind-clear.

*Impromptu in the Chamber of Stillness*
Poverty has pure wind and bright moon,
wealth lacks rouge and powder.
At midnight and noon, the phoenix faces the Primal Origin,
departing and returning with thunder and lightning in tow.

---

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

*Bell*

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

*Bell*
Forged of golden essence, the Dipper’s stars hang high,
how many years has it graced the jade tower’s height?
Most fitting in the fifth watch’s fading dream—
one strike pierces through the white-clouded sky.

*On a Window*
Unintentional, it earnestly veils the bright moon;
intentional, it deliberately screens the red dust.
From this, the empty chamber ever births whiteness,
seizing spring within the Peach Blossom Grotto’s bounds.

*White Chrysanthemum*
Before it bloomed beneath Tao’s hedge,
the west wind lent its force to blow.
Moonlight probed by night its snowy sheen—
clearly, two or three branches of lingering frost.

*Inscribed at the Cauldron-Washing Spring*
Within the Abbey of Ascendant Truth, the Dharma unfolds;
a single pool, its limpid spring unceasing.
Of old, the Celestial Master of Han washed his cauldron here,
hence its name.
Now, beside the pool, a small pavilion stands,
its name inscribed to proclaim it.
May its secluded radiance never fade,
its numinous scene forever pure—thus I extol it in verse.
For millennia, waves of azure, ever clear,
the scene makes me forget not my ancestor’s grace.
Joyfully, I know it once borrowed strength;
the pavilion complete, its name proves not in vain.

*Hao Ranzi Observes a Bamboo Staff*
Once a branch from Ziyou’s garden,
today it parts to rest within my hand.
Pity its lofty integrity, void of all things—
in wild mountains, walking, I find it my companion.

*Two Poems Presented to the Cave Elder of Mount Qingcheng*
The immortals embrace the One, nurturing the subtle and profound;
after nine years’ work, they ascend in broad daylight.
The Dao resides in the present—one must transmit it in due course;
why conceal heaven’s mystery today?

Long have I rejoiced in our meeting,
how could I begrudge the shared arts of the Dao?
When one day your work is complete and you lightly ascend,
you shall serve as a ladder for me in the heavens.

*For the Departure of the Venerable Miaoying to Qiantang*
The Supreme Truth’s palace halls are newly built above;
returning, you first receive the purple imperial decree.
At the appointed place where Heaven’s Eye and Cave’s Radiance meet,
your star-crowned self should not brave wind and dust.

*Nine Poems on Hut Dwelling*
Tiles intact, walls of earth firm,
fences encircle, their gaps sealed by toil.
Visitors may mock the lack of adornment—
wind and rain must be met with steadfast rest.

Before the hut, peach and plum vie in spring’s bloom;
amid snow, only the plum’s flowers appear.
Do not say the branches differ—
their roots diverge, not planted by human hands.

Spring silkworms spin their threads to become moths;
autumn swallows, fledged, forsake their mud nests.
The mountain pheasant, long hidden in its den,
may yet transform into a dragon, entering misty waves.

The towering pine does not lean on the grove,
its branches high, coiling to shade a thousand acres.
Last night, wine-sodden, I woke to wind and rain’s fury—
in midair, faintly, I heard the dragon’s song.

Southern mountains after rain, northern peaks emerge;
last night’s moonlit sky, today’s clear dawn.
Clouds unfurl and coil of their own accord—
the Great Void, through endless ages, remains ever bright.

Do not envy the hut’s pure scenery;
know that joy is born from hardship.
Before the mountain, seekers pass all day,
many speak of untrodden paths as impassable.

Though the brushwood gate stands, it is never barred;
guests come and go as they please.
For days, the mountain’s cold has stilled all sound—
on the rush mat, seated upright, I find deeper peace.

On fine days, warm winds invite me forth;
when mist and rain gather, I return to rest.
Clouds, woodcutters, and herders by the stream—
none are as free as this eccentric man.

Bell and drum resound at dawn and dusk;
tea smoke and cooking smoke rise in turn.
The cloud-robed, rosy-girdled mountain dweller,
year after year, sits motionless, without a single care.

*Sent to Yuan Gui*
The sun not yet at noon, the air is bright;
the jade flask’s spirit stirs, bound for the western source.
I envy the grassy terrace, where we do not go together—
may the bamboo’s wind bring you secluded coolness.

*Lotus Flower*
Faint red blooms, delicate fragrance,
a leisurely one plucks it, sends it to a mountain chamber.
Only its green purity transcends dust and grime—
it must outshine all other flowers in grace.

*Exhortation to Disciples Returning to the Mountains*
Past kalpas’ causes meet in this kalpa’s gathering;
yesterday’s visage, today’s transformation.
In the world, seas turn to mulberry fields—
beware lest you return to display your puppet’s guise.

*Instructions to Disciple Tang*
You seek to aid the people, not for yourself;
I crave the Dao’s cultivation, heedless of poverty.
You must strive with resolve to achieve your work—
lest, through procrastination, you grow old in vain.

*Composed After Transmitting Blessings*
The Daoist’s vow is as boundless as heaven,
only when all beings are delivered will I deliver myself.
If even the slightest speck remains unblessed,
I shall never forsake the path to heaven’s ascent.

*Seeing Off Xu Zhengzhi of Nine Dragons to Mount Magu*
Treading through sunny snow, crossing the rapids,
who can follow the crane’s traces or cloud’s trail?
Like your coming, you depart with nothing—
yet, gathering your return, you are the Three Mountains.

*Matching Rhymes on the Moon, Assigned the Character "Clear"*
The azure vault, limpid and clear,
a single moon, tender-hearted, bright across the four seas.
Within the flowered courtyard’s empty halls,
the feathered one’s heart and gall grow cold.

*Visiting a Friend, Not Met—Inscribed*
Within the hut, one walks the path outside;
outside the hut, one comes to sit within.
Haphazardly patched with thatch, loosely bound—
year after year, wind and rain rend it anew.
