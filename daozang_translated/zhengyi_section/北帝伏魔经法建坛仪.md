**Ritual for Establishing the Altar of the Northern Emperor’s Scripture of Subduing Demons**
*Compiled by:* Lu Zhongling, Precelestial Great Ultimate Master of the Dao

**Liturgical Proceedings – Preface to the Altar Text**

The Scripture of Subduing Demons and its ritual methods have been transmitted since antiquity and disseminated to the present age. The scripture was indeed proclaimed by the Supreme Emperor, and the methods were bestowed by the sagely masters. They possess both substance and function: those who practice them subdue and tame demonic forces. They are without superior or origin: those who cultivate them ascend to the ranks of immortals. Their merit surpasses sun and moon; their virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth.

The esoteric talismans and mysterious seals, when employed, are like medicine to the sick. The numinous chapters and precious incantations, when invoked, resemble the echo of a valley transmitting sound, the thunderous commands of the Celestial Soldiers and Thunder Marshals, the obedience of the Marshal Deities and Divine Kings. They gallop through the Three Realms, shake the Ten Directions; their wondrous efficacy is inexhaustible, and praise cannot encompass them.

Now, with a mind attuned to the Mysterious Ultimate and thoughts fixed upon the ritual’s form, we reverently follow the liturgical regulations and proclaim the scripture and its methods. The Eight Trigrams are arrayed in the eight directions to establish the boundary; the Four Spirits are positioned in the four quadrants to guard the altar. The ringing of bells and casting of fire swiftly disseminate sound. They sweep away demonic miasmas, as the Divine Sparrows and Poison Dragons stand in martial array.

The Golden Lads present memorials; the Jade Maidens convey sincerity. May the causes of those who uphold and recite this scripture silently attain the marvel of spiritual resonance. Before the assembled ritualists, with solemn reverence and sincere hearts, facing the celestial steps, we respectfully chant the sacred titles:

**Northern Ultimate Subduer of Demons, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Great Sage: Heavenly Worthy of the Flying Celestial Dharma King,**
**Heavenly Worthy of the Transmitted Precious Scripture.**

We reverently welcome the Supreme Emperor, having dispelled desire to purify the mind. In initiating the sacred precinct, we must cleanse impurities and wash away defilements. Relying on the cold spring to scatter and sprinkle, we command the divine officers to carry out their duties.

The *Numinous Chapter for Dispelling Impurities* shall now be solemnly recited.

**Recite:**
**Heavenly Worthy Who Washes Away Impurities with Divine Water**

The *Incantation for Purifying Heaven and Earth* is chanted. Standing in attendance within the radiant clarity, we once beheld a single crimson cloud. With minds racing toward the Northern Ultimate, we now gaze upon the triple canopy of the precious parasol.

To welcome the descent of the Supreme Emperor, we first offer true incense to convey our sincerity. The incense is lit with an incantation; let all join in its proclamation.

**Recite:**
**Heavenly Worthy of the Talismanic Clouds of Incense.**

The Heavenly Worthies gather around the precious pearl to hear the Most High expound the Dharma. The Earth Spirits raise the jade platform to protect the Most High as He preaches the scripture. Having faithfully fulfilled their duties in former times, they must not be rashly startled today.

The *Incantation for Pacifying and Comforting the Spirits* shall now be proclaimed by all.

**Recite:**
**Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning Who Pacifies and Stabilizes**

The white chariot and pale horse herald joyous tidings. As the Supreme Emperor descends, crimson standards and rainbow banners must be borne by the myriad spirits in escort. The worthy sages of earth, water, darkness, and yang; the mighty deities of celestial thunder and Mount Feng—upon hearing this universal summons, let all hasten to attend the Dharma assembly.

**Recite the Incantation for Summoning the Hosts:**
**Heavenly Worthy of the Precious Pearl Who Gathers the Sages.**

The Primordial Supreme Emperor issues the true talisman and commands its execution. The Primordial Grand Realized One, exalted among the Five Numinous Ones, shines with the radiance of the Great Tenuity, illuminating the eight gates. The Five Elders proclaim their mandate, and no hidden realm remains unheard. Above, He governs the Nine Heavens; at the center, He guards Mount Feng; below, His reach extends to the twelve river sources of rivers and seas.

The Eight Mighty Divine Incantations, inscribed on jade tablets with numinous writ, summon dragons to bear the waters, gather qi, and condense the mists. They bind demons and dispatch ghosts, leaving none unpunished. Myriad spirits are shattered, and malevolent vapors swept away. The sun, moon, and five planets; the Northern Dipper’s seven origins; the luminous Celestial Emperors—all unite to transmit the decree of the Supreme Mystery. Fire is cast for ten thousand leagues, and might resounds through the Nine Heavens. Proclamations are issued without delay.

All heavens, all earths, all waters, all mountains; the jade perfected and their legions; the vast spirits of the cosmic depths; the Immortal Kings at their feasts; the Five Emperors with their banners; the Heavenly Soldiers leading the vanguard; the Golden Tigers charging behind; the roaring beasts that rend the sky; the nets guarding the four gates—where called, they arrive instantly; where summoned, they appear at once. The decree is dispatched with the swiftness of wind and fire, and those who answer the summons are conveyed by golden dragons.

I have heard that the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the Ancestral Master Who Subdues Demons, is revered by the myriad sages and encircled by the host of stars. He governs the earth below and reigns supreme in the heavens above. He holds dominion over yin and yang, comprehending the wondrous truth of neither form nor emptiness. He sustains the cosmos, plumbing the mysteries of what came before and what follows after. Vast and boundless, beyond all naming, His Way is not the ordinary path. He reveals the secret essence of subduing demons and opens the wondrous gate to deliver beings from peril. He annihilates all evil and expands the myriad transformations.

Thus, when the world’s sincere devotees yearn for His presence, the immortal chariot rides the qi to descend. The officiant, having swept the ground to prepare the altar, invokes Heaven and beseeches the mandate. Looking up, he implores the transformation of the Dao; bowing down, he begs for compassion. The kingfisher canopy and simurgh banners momentarily depart the golden gates; the phoenix flutes and dragon pipes gradually lower their strains to the human realm. To the left, the Azure Radiance; to the right, the Brilliant Wheel; before, the Beckoning Star; behind, the Dark Warrior. Divine light blazes forth, and fragrant clouds gather thickly. The deities of heaven, earth, water, and land, bearing registers and ledgers; the marshals and generals of Fengdu and the mountain palaces, wielding axes and banners—all arrive amidst swirling auspicious mists and drifting celestial blossoms. Slowly descending upon the clouds, vigorously floating through the void, they bow at the celestial steps to reverently welcome the Sage’s arrival.

For this ritual, the humblest servant, kneeling with awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground in reverence. With utmost sincerity, he kindles true incense and respectfully presents his petition:

May it be reverently hoped that the sagely and divine ones grace this Dharma assembly,
That the civil and martial hosts descend upon the scripture altar,
Awaiting in reverence the radiance of grace,
To deign to alight upon this altar ground.

Your servant, though unworthy and foolish,
Presumes to offer this petition,
Humbly imagining the Four Saints escorting the imperial procession as one clings to the dragon and phoenix,
Emerging through the Gate of Heaven.
Riding cranes and whales,
The Five Elders flanking the axle,
Ascending the cloud-paths.

Decrees issue to the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic immortals’ officers,
Commanding the mighty spirits of the Scripture Bureau, the Military Bureau, and the Dharma Bureau.
Relying on the vast and boundless,
Standing in the whirling and soaring,
Spring returns with the sound of jars from the casement.
Fanning the towering and majestic,
Manifesting the solemn and awe-inspiring,
Light illumines the lamp altar.

The Heavenly Kings’ might pervades the four directions above and below,
The Dharma retinue’s rites are strict across the three realms of the unseen and the manifest.
Each reverently bows and dances,
All solemnly cheer in unison,
Gazing upward to the pure radiance.

The Dharma seat is respectfully established,
The precious throne reverently installed,
And humble offerings are presented.
May it be hoped that upon the palace hall,
The imperial robes shine beyond the nine dragons’ chariot of heaven;
In the cup’s clear waves,
Spring arises as in Jiangnan’s second month.

With these meager offerings, I humbly present their fragrance,
Praying the Most Exalted deign to favor this foolish intent.
Bowing deeply again,
Clear tea and herbs are respectfully arranged.

Thus, with crimson light and purple mist,
The cloud chariot descends to the mortal dust;
With green ants and yellow seals,
These humble rites are but slightly arrayed before the imperial steps.
Since they have been graciously noted,
May they be granted the honor of partaking.

Gazing afar at the three-tiered immortal altar,
One beholds the northern pole of heaven;
With a single goblet of flowing rosy clouds,
One still recalls the banquet of the Western Pool.
As the assembled perfected gather,
Permit these modest rites to be offered again.
Facing the pure and solemn,
The green wine is poured once more.

Thus, to harmonize all affairs,
To dissolve a thousand sorrows—
Such is the saying of the village folk.
To unite with nature,
To commune with the Great Dao—
Such are the words of the banished immortal.

Beholding the pure radiance close at hand upon the scripture altar,
These humble flavors are offered again and again in cups and goblets.
With wholehearted devotion,
The three libations express this sentiment.

Your servant has heard that the three-tiered immortal altar of the Cavernous Mystery and Cavernous Void
First established the soundless and scentless golden gates of the Nine Heavens.
Before the distant proclamation of the divine incantations of the wondrous scripture,
One first gazes toward the mysterious void to seek command,
Hoping to open the precious casket,
To unfold the jade texts,
And to lay bare the words and meanings,
That they may be graciously perused.

The intent of the purification rite is proclaimed.
The preceding words have been read in full,
Surely bathed in celestial grace,
They must have reached the sagely ears.

Now, as for the *Wondrous Scripture of the Most High Northern Thearch’s Divine Incantations to Subdue Demons*,
It emerges from the *Upper Clarity Wondrous Perfected Scripture*,
Formed of condensed qi and congealed clouds,
Weaving through heaven and earth.
Above, it is hidden in the Jade Capital and Golden Gates;
Below, it is concealed in the grotto-heavens and famous mountains.
Transmitted during the Dragon Han kalpa,
Promulgated within the Jambudvīpa realm.
The eight-character numinous seal,
Rises from the eight corners to cast its radiance.
The ten-scroll mysterious text,
Subdues the demonic and spectral of the ten heavens.
Its wondrous meanings are expounded,
Its mysterious merits recounted.
The seven primordial secret formulas protect the state and pacify the people;
The six grottoes of the yin palaces slay demons and destroy monsters.
The recitation of the wondrous scripture wards off calamity,
The divine incantations and talismans complete the design.
The golden register ascends the perfected,
The jade talisman delivers lives.
Sweeping away a thousand disasters,
Welcoming a hundred blessings.
Rescuing the six paths,
Aiding the four kinds of life.
Furthermore, the nine dragons,
Can summon all treasures.
The *Great Register to Ward Off Corpses*,
When worn, lengthens one’s Dao affinity.
The hidden seals and cryptic texts,
When cultivated, lead to the attainment of immortal ranks.
The divine soldiers protect the state,
The wondrous Dharma delivers beings.

Since only those whose bone structure accords with immortality
May behold the true text’s revelation,
Now, gazing upon the towering seat,
The empty and cavernous scriptural treasures are expounded.
As the incantations are proclaimed,
One gradually hears the hidden melody of jade-like tones.
Where the numinous scripture is recited,
One surely sees the golden and jade forms revealed.

Looking up, I hope for the perfection of the pure;
Looking down, I pray for compassion toward the earthly.
May a special sagely decree be issued,
To display the jade-bound compilation.
The Jade Lad of the Canonical Bureau,
Unlocks the three-times-eight golden locks.
The incense-bearing youths,
Unfurl and proclaim the one-zhang purple jade text.
A thousand, ten thousand layers of Dao qi mysteriously assist,
The perfected of forty thousand kalpas rejoice in this encounter.
The officers and generals stand guard within and without,
Evil demons are banished far and near.

May it be hoped that auspicious vapors rise in lush abundance,
And propitious lights scatter in profusion.
A single floating crimson cloud,
Draws near to the celestial countenance.
A myriad numinous lights gather the ten thousand perfected,
The immortal retinue stands in solemn majesty.

This humble petition is briefly presented,
Hoping for a response through spiritual resonance.
The recitation and dedication are complete,
All is offered in reverence.
Presuming upon the celestial might,
This servant’s heart is filled with fervent anticipation,
Awaiting the command.

Respectfully spoken.
The Three Bows.

The Perfected’s primal life-spirit is invoked,
Hands execute the Opening-Closing-Retaining-Sealing Mudra,
A Dipper constellation is traced—
the cap bears the *yi* trigram of the left *si* position.
A feather fan sweeps the wind,
Blowing away ashes and embers—
the *mao* trigram.
The qi of the Eastern Direction engenders and completes the primal life.
Again, the left hand wields the fan to expel stale qi,
All is made immaculately pure.

The right hand’s sword inscribes a three-tiered altar,
The left hand’s Dipper Seal,
Three steps of the *ding*-stem *gang* pace,
Ascend the three-tiered altar to perform the rite,
Summoning the Five Marshals and all their generals.
Proceed to state the matter at hand,
Entrusting them as in healing illness.
Deploy the *Celestial Black Register* to subdue malevolent spirits,
Command the Heart Marshal to guard and protect the afflicted body.
Execute the Seizing Mudra and inscribe the prison,
Seize and press them into confinement,
Enacting the *Zhen-Gen* method.

“I am a child of the Most High,
Dispatched by the Venerable Lord.
I wear the sun and moon upon my head,
Bear the Northern Dipper at my waist.
I command the Celestial Legions of the Qian,
A million hundred thousand strong,
Arrayed at my left and right.
Before me boil the cauldrons of myriad *shuo*,
Behind me gleam the axes of yellow gold.
When I attend the Most High,
I suddenly encounter divine generals.
They teach me the method to slay demons,
Bestow upon me the formula to decapitate ghosts.
I bear the *Supreme Simplicity Talisman*,
To gather and subdue all inauspicious forces.
I report to the Heavenly Thearch,
Summoning the officers and soldiers.
I wear the floral canopy upon my head,
Tread the *Kui-Gang* beneath my feet.
What spirit dares not flee?
What ghost dares stand before me?
I bind you without fail,
Punish your wanton harm.
The patient has committed no offense—
How dare you assail the worthy and good?
I contain the upright qi of Heaven and Earth,
My incantation shatters the misfortune of wayward ghosts.
Incant the gods, and gods perish of themselves;
Incant the ghosts, and ghosts perish of themselves.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with statute and ordinance!”

Issue the command—
Dispatch the generals:

“Heavenly thunder rumbles in concealment—*si*.
Earthly thunder roars in tumult—*mao*.
Dragon thunder coils the waters—*chen*.
Water thunder churns the waves—*zi*.
Earth Deity’s fire thunder—*mao*.
Thunderbolts crisscross—*yin*.
The trigger is sprung,
Seizing and capturing wayward spirits—*gen*.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with statute and ordinance!”

Next, visualize the altar’s upper tier:
Crimson light interweaves in radiant beams,
Purple qi billows in abundance.
The August Sovereign presides over the Three Realms,
Myriad spirits pay homage at the Primal Origin.
The middle tier:
The Northern Dipper, Five Stars, Twenty-Eight Constellations,
Sun, moon, and all celestial bodies,
The perfected immortals of the scriptures,
The stewards of the Dao—all are present.
The lower tier:
The Fengdu Water Realm, the Five Marchmounts,
The Ten Lands, Grotto-Heavens, Blessed Terrains, and sacred mountains—
Their divine immortals gather therein.

Next, gaze toward the throne of the Northern Thearch,
Visualize the primal spirit presenting the petition,
Hoping for the bestowal of celestial radiance to empower the officiant,
Manifesting immediate spiritual resonance.
Raise the *Primal Life Mudra*,
Visualize the attendants at left and right,
Envision the Northern Thearch as the ancestral master,
Then visualize the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace.
Light illumines the ten directions,
The Four Saints follow the talismans to guard the four quarters,
Encamping and arraying the formations.
The celestial generals of this altar stand to the left,
The immortals of the scriptures stand to the right,
The celestial immortals of the heavenly realms reside in the northeast,
The terrestrial immortals of the earthly realms reside in the southeast,
The immortals of the watery palaces reside in the southwest,
The deities of the yang realms reside in the northwest,
The demon kings of the various heavens, the celestial soldiers and valiant warriors, stand to the left and right.
Above are the Four Heavenly Kings,
Below are the great deities of the Eight Trigrams.
For each direction visualized,
Two divine generals are present,
Each commanding a million celestial soldiers,
Deploying troops and arraying formations,
Their majesty resplendent and awe-inspiring,
Guarding and protecting the ten directions.

Proceeding according to the rite, next issue the summons and commands to the officers and generals to assume their posts:

The celestial immortals and generals within and without the Purple Court,
Zhuge Liang’s Iron Seal,
The great deities of the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces within the rite,
The Seventeen Divine Kings,
The marshals of the earthly deities,
Wang Qi’s Ten Great Guardians—
All lead the troops, cavalry, and officers,
Each solemnly and single-mindedly
Intensifying their patrols and vigilance,
Encircling the scriptural altar.”

Still, to the left of the altar gate, erect a Celestial Prison.
To the right of the altar gate, erect an Earthly Prison.
All ephemeral, wanton ghosts—those who waste and stagnate,
those who slander with red mouths and white tongues,
those who cast malevolent glances and poisonous stares,
lingering corpses and stale qi,
lost souls near and far,
direct talismans and piercing curses,
ghosts of cold temples and wandering sickness,
plague demons,
grievances, vengeful spells, and specters of all kinds—
every ghost that defies Heaven, rebels against Earth,
acts without the Dao, or strays from righteousness—
seize and deliver them beneath my *kuigang*,
to suffer death, motionless and inert,
forbidden to violate my incantation.
Should any dare breach my divine spell,
let their heads shatter and brains burst,
scattered like fine dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Next, cast down the *Hengtian Black Register* to perform the *Altar-Binding Rite*:
East bound, West bound,
South bound, North bound,
Above bound to the heavens,
Below bound to the earth,
At the center, all ghosts and evil spirits bound.
With the above, employ the *Grasping the Authority Seal*,
the *Zimu Marshal’s Seal*,
the *Kun’s Grasping the Authority Seal*,
and recite the *Altar Incantation*.
The Vermilion Bird radiates brilliance,
divine might surges within.
The Four Mountain Sources stand guard—
ghostly soldiers flee in terror.
The divine serpent exhales its breath—
evil spirits cower in hiding.
The Four Luminous Soul Terraces,
jade doors resplendent.
The Jade Perfected stands majestic,
enthroned in the Hall of Light.
Wielding purple auroras in hand,
crowned with divine radiance.
Reciting the *Cavern Scripture*,
thirty-nine chapters in all.
Within, the *Exorcising Evil*,
the might of dragons and tigers.
Fierce beasts and charging oxen,
clutching blades and swallowing spears.
The *Mountain-Raising Bell* tolls—
Heaven’s poisonous dragons and divine birds.
Six-jawed, they spew fire,
devouring the kings of ghosts.
Lightning boars and thunderfire,
seizing stars and streaming bolts.
Flickering flames, scorching winds,
marching against the gale.
The *Celestial Bird Array* surrounds me,
belching fire for ten thousand miles
to dispel all misfortune.
All spirits open the Way,
sealing off mountain villages.
A thousand gods, ten thousand spirits,
bow their heads in reverence.
Marshals hold censers,
burning incense for me.
Wherever I tread,
all gods receive me.
Celestial beasts come to guard,
a thousand spirits tremble and submit—
dare not disturb my qi.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Now perform the *Altar-Locking Rite*:
The Celestial Slayer blazes,
the Earthly Slayer stands firm.
How dare any evil spirit or ghost hide?
With a single inhalation of the *Flying Gang*,
ten thousand ghosts vanish.
Left *Kui*, right *Gang*—
divine saints seize and lock them,
allowing no escape.
Command: “Divine generals, swiftly lock the altar!”
I act by the decree of the Northern Emperor.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Perform the *Altar-Locking Rite*, taking the *Xī Seal* and casting the *Decision*:
Direct the generals and officers to lock the altar,
envisioning the divine presence of the Northern Emperor.
Petition the Primordial Celestial Sovereign,
stepping through the Dipper,
visualizing the transformation of the divine seat.

I, the ritual master, have heard:
The Great Void is boundless, unseen and unheard.
Yet the profound Dao is obscure—
knock, and it opens; seek, and it responds.
Today, within this altar,
solemnly establish the scriptural rite,
circulating it above and below, throughout the four directions.
Like the Southern Cinnabar Realm,
encircling a hundred leagues,
it becomes the Northern Culmen Celestial Palace,
where the Four Qi shine clearly.
Ten thousand spirits tremble and submit,
demon kings all pay homage.
No land remains unpeaceful.
As when the Primordial One dwells within the Pearl,
or when the Most High ascends the Jade Throne,
divine sounds resound,
golden words proclaimed.
Ten ranks unfold,
the sea of blessings deep and the mountain of longevity firm.
The Five Directions stand secure—
evil gates close, and the true Dao opens.
Sit in equanimity, recite the scripture with utmost sincerity.
Proceed.
Open the case, expound the mysteries—Celestial Worthy.
Modulate the voice, recite the scripture,
and discourse on the *Narrative Chapter*.

When reciting to the *Celestial Canopy Mantra*, visualize the host of great immortals, divine kings, generals, and officials arrayed in martial formation, standing in attendance to the left and right, before and behind. After each chapter is recited, summon the Divine Sovereign of the North. Then envision yourself as the Perfected of Primordial Destiny, kneeling to present matters and offer reverent thanks. Again visualize the Divine Sovereign of the North, and proceed to recite the next chapter.

For the *Seven Primordials Chapter*, when reciting to the *Mantra of Division of Self*, do not raise the voice. In proper visualization, see the Divine Sovereign of the North dispatching troops to seize malevolent spirits, sending generals to capture the demonic gods who bring misfortune and cast them into prison. Envision the spirit as the Celestial Canopy, pacing the Dipper once, and standing upon the □-star. With the left hand, form the Mudra of the Five Generals, then the Mudra of the Household Guardian, pressing the four fingers upon the base of the thumb. The Mudra of Provisional Troops, the Mudra of the Master of the Zi-hour. Press the thumb upon the middle joint of the four fingers. Summon the generals to deploy troops, apprehend the malevolent spirits afflicting the household, and draw the Well Prison to enclose the demon. Visualize the soldiers and generals capturing them within, commanding them to release the patient’s hun-soul and return it to the body. Envision a beam of golden light from the altar piercing directly into the sickroom; the patient’s body follows the light inward, and in accordance with the scripture, spray consecrated water to repel and withdraw the affliction. Alternatively, have someone carry the talisman into the room, strike vinegar-soaked charcoal for fumigation, and sweep clean. Visualize the Heart General guarding and restoring the body to tranquility. Imagine all who come and go as demonic gods and spirit officials. Return to the four altars and resume recitation.

For the *Chapter of Slaying Demons*, visualize the Divine Sovereign of the North leading the demon kings of all heavens and the spirit officials of the Six Palaces, expounding the Dao in Fengdu to subdue malevolent spirits. In healing illness, also provide talismanic water for the patient to ingest.

For the *Chapter of Warding Off Calamity*, envision the Perfected of Primordial Destiny presenting a memorial to the Divine Sovereign of the North, who then proclaims the sacred decree to the stellar palaces of the Northern Dipper, beseeching the deliverance of a certain person from disaster. Visualize the inauspicious stars of the afflicted person retreating, while auspicious constellations shine upon them, dispersing misfortune and dissolving calamity. Heavenly immortals deliver the person, demon kings receive the precepts, and ghostly apparitions flee in terror.

For the *Chapter of the Divine Seal*, envision the seal radiating a myriad zhang of luminous rays, severing and extinguishing all inauspiciousness.

For the *Chapter of the Golden Register*, visualize the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning descending the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering, dispatching the Dragon Youth to deliver proclamations to the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and the palaces of Mount Fengdu, summoning the ancestral hun-souls. Next, envision the Celestial Worthy of Salvation from Suffering, forming the Mudra of the Golden Tablet, and visualize golden light piercing the dark prisons, drawing the souls to the altar. The Daoist assembly then recites scriptures at the ancestral shrine, offering consecrated food, and inviting the souls to be seated. After recitation, present the *Tablet of Longevity*, proclaim the talismanic registers, and dispatch the Dragon Youth and spirit officials to the Southern Bureau of Life Registration. First, burn the offerings of merit; the Dharma Master need not descend from the seat.

For the *Chapter of the Nine Dragons*, visualize the Divine Sovereign of the North holding the Golden Tablet, summoning the Nine Dragon Kings to reside in the forbidden precincts and the Six Spirits to attend the command. For any recent or past construction that has caused offense, all shall be pardoned and absolved. Rely upon the merit of this scripture to ensure peace and deliverance.

**Chapter of Expelling Corpse-Energy**
Upon reciting the *Luminous Mirror Register*, visualize white *qi* and auspicious radiance emerging from the sacred register in the heavens, dispelling celestial calamities and dispersing terrestrial misfortunes.

**Eight-Character Chapter**
When reciting the *Taboo of the Dipper*, envision the Divine Sovereign of the North issuing a decree to the Northern Dipper. The Northern Dipper manifests in person to pacify mortals, dissolve disasters, and resolve adversities. Aligning with the stellar paths, it erases names from the ledgers of sin and inscribes them in the registers of rebirth. At each position, perform the visualization: with the left hand forming the Dipper mudra, trace from the forehead to the eyes—this is called *Descending Upon the Eyes*—to resolve grievances, safeguard life, and cultivate the heart and nature. Further envision the divine immortals and spirit officials protecting the living, excising sins, bestowing blessings, and granting the sacred talismans for ingestion.

**Chapter of Divine Soldiers**
Here, present the offerings of the *jiao* ritual anew. Visualize the assembled perfected beings, both within and without, above and below, receiving the offerings and descending to confer blessings.

**Dedication Text**
The humble officiant, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial in profound gratitude, kindling true incense to reverently address the sacred ranks.

I have heard that when the jade scriptures conclude their scrolls, their mysteries resound through the Three Realms; when the tones of the sacred chime fade, the distant chanting of the heavens seems to echo their verses. Truly, these are the profound mysteries of the celestial realm, not the common words of the mundane world. Through them, Heaven and Earth endure eternally, and the sun and moon alternate in their courses. The people rely upon them for prosperity, while ghosts and spirits revere them for their transformative power. The sick who hear them gain longevity in the Eastern Flower Capital; the deceased who hear them ascend in spirit to the Northern Palace. Demons and malevolent forces hear them and shatter their skulls; those who abandon delusion and awaken to them soar with scales and feathers. These are the foundations of life and transformation, upon which all beings in heaven and earth depend. They serve as the torch of wisdom for the benighted and the dharma bridge across the sea of suffering. Their merit is inconceivable, their blessings and virtue boundless.

Today, having recited the ten chapters in full, their harmonies pierce the nine heavens. I humbly envision the scriptures returning to the stellar altar as grace descends from the Golden Gates. May the imperial domain expand and our Dao flourish. May the five winds and ten rains arrive in season, and the people of the four seas enjoy peace and prosperity. May the Three Wretched Paths cease their suffering, never again to fall into the cycles of retribution. May the Ten Grounds awaken compassion, and the torments of purgatory pause, if only briefly. May all living things—moving and still—feel the virtue of creation, and all creatures—soaring and swimming—receive the grace of nurturance. May all sentient beings equally attain the untainted state.

Next, may [Name]’s sins be erased across countless kalpas, and blessings descend in this very moment. May the talismanic waters retain their efficacy, ensuring tranquility, peace, and harmony as before. May the field of the body be blessed, free from afflictions, illnesses, and pains. May official rank and fortune thrive, and stellar influences align auspiciously. May the household enjoy serenity, the elderly find peace, and the young be cherished. May the nine generations ascend, the living be protected in spirit, and the departed be transformed. What disaster shall not be vanquished? What wish shall not be fulfilled? We, your servants, together bathe in the residual grace, and all in the human realm partake of its extraordinary benefits. May this scriptural teaching flow through the ages, and demonic forces be eradicated from the eight wilds.

With these prayers, I reverently submit them to the shelter of your boundless longevity. For the highest good, I bow my head in devotion and take refuge.

With sincere hearts, we invoke and praise the Three Supreme Ones, the saints of the ten directions, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, and the exalted perfected ones of the *Sutra Altar for Subduing Demons*. Their merit is beyond all measure, their virtue unfathomable.

Thus concludes the ritual for establishing the altar of the *Northern Emperor’s Scripture for Subduing Demons*.
