**Daoist Canon I**   The Dao/Way

The *Laozi* states:
The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao/Way—its wondrous subtlety lies in utmost emptiness.
Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.
The nameless is the mystery’s root. The Dao/Way is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Profound, it seems the ancestor of all things.
Between heaven and earth, does it not resemble a great bellows?
The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth endure long because they do not live for themselves—thus they attain long life.
They give life without possessing, act without relying, lead without dominating: this is called profound virtue/power.
Holding to the ancient Dao/Way, one governs present existence.
To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao/Way.
When the myriad things arise, I observe their return.
Affairs accomplished, tasks complete, the common people all say, “We are naturally so.”
Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.
The bearing of great virtue/power follows only the Dao/Way.
By surveying the many beginnings, how do I know the nature of the many beginnings?
That which bends is preserved whole—this means bending oneself to respond to affairs preserves wholeness.
That which is crooked becomes straight—this means yielding oneself to advance others achieves straightness.
That which is hollow becomes full—this means holding to humility ensures constant fullness.
That which is worn becomes new—this means guarding simplicity and frugality brings daily renewal.
Having little ensures attainment—this means embracing the One without deviation incurs no loss.
Having much leads to confusion—this means pursuing many paths brings disorder.
Therefore, the sage embraces the One as the model for the world.
“Rare words are natural”—this means that through words one awakens to the Dao/Way without clinging to words, aligning with nature.
There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.
Silent! Vast! It stands alone and does not change, circulates without cease.
I know not its name; I style it “Dao/Way,” and by force call it “Great.”
Within the realm, there are four greats, and the ruler occupies one.
This means the ruler is the master of human spirit, upon whom the rise and fall of the myriad things depend.
Humans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao/Way, and the Dao/Way emulates spontaneity.
Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness is the lord of restlessness.
“Good traveling leaves no tracks”—this means embodying true nature, one’s actions leave no traces, and the heart accords with the Dao/Way.
“Good words leave no flaws”—this means transcending forms to seek meaning, where principle is realized and the heart forgotten.
“Good reckoning requires no tally”—this means unifying all with the One without generating other views.
“Good closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened”—this means the heart is free from the delusion of chasing phenomena, and phenomena are free from the burden of arousing the heart.
“Good binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone”—this means the heart merges with the Dao/Way; though unbound, it cannot be untied.
Thus, the sage is always good at saving people, so none are abandoned.
Always good at saving things, so none are discarded—this is called inheriting illumination.
Know the masculine, yet keep to the feminine;
know the white, yet keep to the black;
know the honorable, yet keep to the humble.
This means that containing virtue/power within, one returns to simplicity; with constant virtue/power in use, one scatters to become vessels.
Once entering forms and vessels, there must be refinement and coarseness.
The sage employs them as the chief of all materials.
Thus, great governance does not sever—this means the sage uses the Dao/Way to govern the multitude without harming their natural state.
The Dao/Way in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.
“Those who die yet do not perish are long-lived”—this means death is the end of physical principle, while perishing is premature fate. Longevity is the fulfillment of one’s allotted span. Those who know contentment and act with effort attain heaven’s constancy. To die without perishing is to fulfill one’s allotted span—this is called longevity.
Grasping the great image, the world comes.
Coming without harm, it rests in great peace.

When transformation stirs with desire, I shall pacify it with the Unnamed Unhewn—this refers to the Dao/Way.

Lose the Dao/Way, then virtue/power follows;
Lose virtue/power, then benevolence follows;
Lose benevolence, then righteousness follows;
Lose righteousness, then ritual follows.

All things under heaven are born of being,
Being is born of non-being.

Luminous virtue/power appears dim;
Advancing the Dao/Way seems like retreat;
The level Dao/Way resembles unevenness.

Supreme virtue/power is like a valley—this means emptiness that embraces all things.
Great purity seems tarnished—this means the capacity to remain immaculate while containing impurity.
Vast virtue/power seems insufficient—this means great accomplishment that holds to humility.
Established virtue/power seems unstable—this means achieving merit without self-display.
Embodied reality seems mutable—this means purity and unity that harmonizes with radiance.

The great square has no corners—this means no petty adherence to sharp angles.
The great vessel is slow to complete—this means no pursuit of quick results.
The great tone is scarcely heard—this means no adornment with trivial sounds.
The great image has no form—this means responsiveness to all things.

The Dao/Way lies hidden, without name—this means its function remains unmanifest.

The Dao/Way generates the One,
The One generates the Two,
The Two generate the Three,
The Three generate the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
Blending qi to achieve harmony.

In practicing the Dao/Way, daily diminish—
Diminish and further diminish,
Until reaching non-action.

Thus, block the apertures, close the gates,
And to the end of life, one will not toil—
This means not indulging the six senses’ delights,
So the gate of misfortune closes,
And one remains untroubled to life’s end.

Open the apertures, aid one’s affairs,
And to the end of life, one cannot be saved—
This means opening the senses to fulfill desires,
Thus inviting misfortune that cannot be remedied.

To avoid bringing calamity upon oneself is called following constancy—
This means not incurring personal disaster,
And thus secretly employing the true, constant Dao/Way.

It is also said:
The knowing do not speak;
The speaking do not know.

Speech exists to convey meaning through sound,
Like one who knows music—
Recognizing tones through strings,
The heart knows the sound,
Yet the mouth cannot transmit it.
Those who deeply comprehend the subtle and wondrous do not speak.

The highest say: The knowing do not speak;
Those who speak do so to rescue others.

It is further said:
The superior person studies the Dao/Way, receiving it with spirit;
The middling person receives it with the heart;
The inferior person receives it with the ears.

Those who listen with spirit penetrate the formless;
Those who listen with the heart know inner conditions;
Those who listen with the ears hear external sounds.

It is also said:
The knowing do not speak;
The speaking do not know.
Thus the sage declares:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I have no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;
I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.

Cultivate it in oneself, and the world transforms itself—
This is the Dao/Way of deep roots and firm stems, of long life and enduring vision.

When the Dao/Way governs the world,
Its spirits do not act as gods.
The Dao/Way is the mystery of the myriad things;
To act is to ruin it,
To grasp is to lose it.
Therefore the sage practices non-action and so does not fail,
Holds to nothing and so does not lose.

The *Scripture of the Supreme* states:
The chaotic qi transforms into perfected beings,
Soaring with the times,
Possessing names yet no forms.

The *Scripture of Immortals* states:
Divine immortals ascend lightly—these are celestial immortals,
Ranked in the Great Clarity,
Their names recorded in secret registers.

The *Scripture of Esoteric Essentials* states:
The grotto-palaces of the Five Marchmounts—
In an instant, one becomes an earthbound immortal,
Preserving spirit and form,
Far from care and calamity.

It is also said:
The Nine Palaces of the Great Clarity all have officials—
The highest are called the Grand August, the Purple August, the Jade August;
Collectively, the highest are called Lords of the Great Dao/Way,
Next are Perfected Ones and Perfected Ministers;
Among them are Censors.

Whenever called "Supreme," it denotes the honor of a single palace—
Virtue/power so lofty it has no flaw,
Thus it is called "Supreme."

It is further said:
The immortal is a river;
The body is a boat.

To cross the river and reach the shore—why rely on a boat?

The *Statutes of the Grand Perfection* states:
The *Jade Emperor’s Register* contains one hundred and eight Lords of the Dao/Way,
Where herb-gathering immortals are appointed according to their karma.

The Three Good Paths are the sagely, the perfected, and the immortal.
The highest rank is called sagely,
The middle rank is called perfected,
The lowest rank is called immortal.
Between the Three Clarities, each has its proper station.
The sagely ascend to the Jade Clarity,
The perfected ascend to the Highest Clarity,
The immortals ascend to the Great Clarity.
In the Jade Clarity are the palaces of the Great Emperor,
Where emperors, kings, dukes, ministers, officials, and commoners are all addressed as "sagely"—
Such as Sagely August or Sagely Emperor.
Men and women, noble and base, each has its hierarchy.
In the Highest Clarity are the Dark Capital, Jade Capital, Seven Treasures, and Purple Tenuity,
All addressed as "perfected."
In the Great Clarity is the Palace of the Great Ultimate,
All addressed as "immortal."
The ranks and hierarchies of the Highest Clarity and Great Clarity,
Including the order of men and women,
Are the same as those of the Jade Clarity.

The *Scripture of the Great Grotto* states:
From life one attains the Dao/Way,
From the Dao/Way one attains immortality,
From immortality one attains perfection,
From perfection one becomes a Lord of the Highest Clarity.

The *Scripture of the Five Talismans* states:
The *Twenty-Four Perfected Charts*—
The numinous treasures of the Five Marchmounts.
Whoever obtains them will surely ascend as an immortal,
Striding through the Great Clarity.
To obtain the methods of the Dao/Way, first bathe and cleanse away filth,
Then acquire the *Eastern Well Chart*.
To stabilize the Five Emperors and command mountain spirits,
Acquire the *Marchmount Chart*.
To commune with divine spirits and master immortal arts,
Acquire the *Eight Histories True Forms Chart*.
To master the Five Phases’ kitchens,
Acquire the *Six Jia Spirit-Communion Chart*.
To preserve one’s body and summon celestial spirits,
Acquire the *Nine Palaces Purple Chamber Chart*.
To uphold the methods of the Dao/Way,
Acquire the *Great Clarity Chart*.
To follow the Dao/Way in accord,
Acquire the *Chaos-Unity Chart*.
To comprehend the workings of the Dao/Way,

To attain the immortal register,

To govern the arts of the Dao/Way,
Acquire the *Grotto’s August Treasure Chart*.
To perform transformations,
Acquire the *Reclining Breath Chart*.
To refine the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor before the furnace,
Acquire the *Great One Chart*.
To ascend the Five Marchmounts in search of divine mushroom herbs,
Acquire the *Mountain-Opening Mushroom Herb Chart*.
To preserve spirit and form, distinguishing deviant spirits,
Acquire the *Bright Mirror Chart*.

The *Scripture of the Highest Clarity* states:
The qi that is guarded follows where the spirit is born.
Where the spirit abides, qi abides;
Where the spirit departs, qi departs.
When qi scatters, it becomes clouds and mist;
When it coalesces, it becomes form and shadow.
Emerging, it becomes an immortal;
Transforming and entering, it becomes the True One.
Above, it binds the Three Origins;
Below, it binds the myriad things.
In stillness, it serves as the omen of the body;
In motion, it serves as the omen of the spirit.

The *Scripture of the Grotto Perfection* states:
Whoever reads the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir and Grotto Perfection*,
Able to study it with precision and insight,
And through resonance comprehends the profound,
With clouds returning to release the primal darkness and savor the radiance of the Great Clarity,
Is fit to be a Master of the Mysterious Center.

Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states:
From Fuxi to the Three Dynasties,
Illustrious Daoist masters appeared in every generation.
Laozi, in particular, attained the Dao/Way with exceptional refinement.
Inwardly, he embodied spontaneity;
To rightly determine the root and branches,
One should rely on historical records,
Along with scriptures of immortals and esoteric texts for mutual verification.
Other popular accounts are largely false and deceptive,
Later Daoists having privately added to them—
These are not authentic texts.
He composed the *Virtue/Power of the Dao/Way* in two scrolls,
And Yin Xi practiced his teachings.
By the Han, Empress Dou favored the words of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi,
And Emperor Wen along with the Dou clan’s relatives were all ordered to study them.
Thus, Zhuang Zhou and his followers took Laozi as their patriarch.

The *Scripture of the Grand One Perfected of the Great Unity* states:
All lofty perfected immortals have masters,
Who transmit the *Three Caverns’ Treasured Scriptures of the Highest Clarity*.
Without a master, the Dao/Way cannot be accomplished—
How then could one ride the Eight Radiance Dragon Chariot?
How could one ascend the Great Ultimate and Jade Towers?
In learning the Dao/Way of the Highest Clarity,
How could one achieve flight in the flesh?
If one is negligent toward the master’s path,
One loses even a night-shining pearl.
Thus, the Dao/Way is inherently difficult to know;
Even sages and worthies revere their masters,
For this is how the Dao/Way endures.

The *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean* states:
Heaven and earth spread qi—
The truth of the master’s teaching.
Perfected immortals ascend to sageliness—
Without a master, none succeed.
The heart cannot be its own master;
To take the heart as master is to court failure.

The *Scripture of the Treasure Mystery* states:
To restrain partiality and deviation,
One must return to the central and correct.
Able to reach the flowing end,
One returns to the original source.
The Dao/Way is fundamentally formless,
Yet through words, images are established.
Though spoken of as emptiness in use,
In truth, it is without substance.

The *Canon of the Dao/Way* states:
To regulate killing and life is Heaven’s role;
To follow nature and destiny is humanity’s.
Those who do not oppose Heaven do not kill;
Those who do not oppose humanity do not attack.
To govern thus is the ultimate of the Dao/Way.

The *Records of the Seven Sages* states:
The Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount descended to teach,
Transforming his traces to become a Daoist,
And with six disciples, all revealed their names.

The *Scripture of the Lord Emperor of the Great One* states:
Those who seek the Dao/Way must rectify their hearts—
Then even Heaven and Earth cannot oppose them.

Those who abandon the burdens of sensual desire without a backward glance, shun glory and profit to distance themselves, willingly endure cold and hardship to preserve contemplation, and delight in quiet retreat behind hidden walls—only then may one speak of learning the Dao/Way.

The *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmonious Motion* states:
Heaven is the manifested form of the Dao/Way.
Its responses unfold gradually,
Guided by interaction.
Among the mysterious symbols and empty patterns,
None surpass the Three and Five.
When the Three and Five move in harmonious sequence,
Their revolutions are inexhaustible,
And the Three Powers align in perfect measure.
The Great One is Heaven.
Heaven receives the singular qi,
Vast and clear in its purity.
The Dao/Way is the accumulation of Heaven’s numinous power.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states:
The profound subtlety of the Dao/Way arises from spontaneity,
Born from the unborn,
Preceding what precedes all else.
It pervades beyond all bounds,
Dispersing spirit and transforming qi,
Serene and without superior,
Governing and guiding all heavens.

The *Inner Chapters of the Mysterious and Wondrous* states:
The Great Dao/Way arises from non-action,
And is the ancestor of the ten thousand things.

The *Scripture of the Orthodox Unity Perfected* states:
The purity and truth of the Dao/Way cannot be conveyed by words.
Words are but a means to express meaning.
Through the establishment of the Mysterious Capital,
The transformation of Orthodox Unity draws near to truth.

The *Scripture of the Treasured Mystery* states:
Rectitude aligns with the Dao/Way;
Alignment gives voice to aspiration.
Aspiration and speech reside in rectitude,
And rectitude severs all deviation.
Through fasting, purification, and the recitation of scriptures,
The Dao/Way of immortality naturally manifests.
The greatest attainment of immortality lies with the Most High.
The Most High speaks not,
Yet words respond to resonance.
This resonant response is the way of trust,
Manifesting as scripture.

The *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* states:
Seek the natural,
Liberate the self to stand in the Dao/Way.
The Three Luminaries shine forth,
And Heaven and Earth remain constant.

The *Scripture of Wisdom* states:
Speak to a ruler, and wisdom benefits the state;
Speak to a father, and kindness extends to the child;
Speak to a teacher, and love embraces the multitude;
Speak to an elder brother, and fraternal conduct prevails;
Speak to a minister, and loyalty serves the sovereign;
Speak to a child, and filial piety honors the parents;
Speak to a friend, and trust strengthens the bond;
Speak to a wife, and devotion is given to the husband;
Speak to a husband, and harmony fills the household;
Speak to a younger brother, and reverence upholds propriety;
Speak to a farmer, and diligence is encouraged in tilling the land;
Speak to a Daoist, and the discourse halts at the Dao/Way;
Speak to a foreigner, and each guards their own domain;
Speak to a servant, and caution guides their service.

The *Scripture of the Most High* states:
Draw near to the wise and learned,
And broadly inquire into the good Dao/Way.
In the discussions of the worthy,
One must not cling stubbornly to a single view.
It further states:
In the latter age, how should Daoists conduct the rituals when expounding scriptures and teaching the Dharma?
If expounding the *Five Thousand Characters*,
Follow the rites of the *Numinous Treasure*.

The *Three Caverns Treasured Scripture* states:
A single master of the Three Caverns who transmits the Dharma to save the world
Surpasses a thousand yellow-robed Daoists.
It further states:
On Great Mount Mao stands a bronze and iron cauldron,
Capable of holding four or five *hu*,
Exquisitely and finely wrought.
It rests at the mountain’s highest point,
Buried eight *chi* deep in the earth,
Covered by a slab of stone.
On auspicious days,
Daoists from near and far ascend the mountain to behold it,
Where no grass or trees remain.
They pile stones to form a small altar.
Once, a small tiled hut stood there,
But it was toppled by the wind.
Its two handles represent the sun and moon;
Its three legs represent the Three Powers.
Forged from the bronze of Feather Mountain,
It appears and vanishes through divine transformation.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states:
To the southwest of Great Mount Mao lies Four-Flat Mountain,
Commonly called Square Mountain.
Beneath it is a grotto chamber,
Named Square Terrace.
The grotto has two entrances visible on the mountain’s exterior,
Connecting to Huayang,
And is called the Secluded Abode of the Separate Realm.
Those who attain the Dao/Way dwell there.
It further states:
Cultivate the self,
And one’s virtue/power becomes true.
The noble person establishes the self,
Taking morality and the Dao/Way as their duty,
Purity and stillness as their teacher,
Great Harmony as their friend,
Mystery as their silence.
With the Dao/Way, they exhaust the ultimate,
Govern the root,
And seek what precedes all signs.
Those who do good reward themselves;
Those who do evil punish themselves.
Thus, without contention, there is nothing they cannot overcome;
Without speech, there is nothing to which they do not respond.
It further states:
Those who study the Dao/Way with utmost sincerity
Should transmit the Dao/Way to learners.
Master Fei said:
My teacher, the Red Pine Master of the Southern Marchmount,
Is the Perfected of the Great Void.
Formerly, the Most High instructed Laozi in virtue/power to attain the Dao/Way;
The Red Pine Master transmitted the Dao/Way to me, and I attained immortality.
It further states:
The ten superior trials of the immortal path must all be passed
Before transmission is granted.
These twelve matters constitute the great trial,
All overseen by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate.
How can one not be cautious?
Formerly, Qingwu the Elder, disciple of Pengzu,
Received the teachings of an enlightened master
And mastered the wondrous principles of immortality.
He entered Mount Huayin to study the Dao/Way.
After twelve trials over the years,
Three remained unpassed.
Later, he ingested golden fluid and ascended to the Great Ultimate.
The Lord of the Dao/Way deemed him to have failed three trials,
Thus, he was but an immortal,
Not a Perfected.

It further states:
Master Fei said that learners of the Dao/Way face nine perils.
If one examines them carefully,
Immortality is not far off.
The perils are:
Having aspiration but no opportunity,
Having opportunity but no companions,
Having companions but no aspiration,
Having aspiration but not meeting a teacher,
Meeting a teacher but not learning,
Learning from a teacher but not diligently,
Diligently practicing but not upholding the Dao/Way,
Or having an unsteady aspiration.
With wholehearted devotion,
One need not rely on companions to succeed,
Nor await resonance to act—
This is the broad essential of learning immortality.
If the teacher is burdened by sorrow,
The disciple’s comings and goings lack goodness.
Without a teacher, learning the Dao/Way will not succeed.
With the heart fixed and the eyes visualizing,
One sees the teacher as scripture.
What is not transmitted by the teacher
Must not be taught to others,
Lest it confuse later learners.
Thus, one must not seek the Dharma without transmission.

When serving a teacher,
Do not choose based on nobility or baseness,
Nor doubt age or youth.
To say, “I am older while they are younger,”
Or, “They are base while I am noble,”
Is to fail to grasp the essential equality of true orthodoxy.
Among people, none are noble or base—
Those with the Dao/Way are revered.
As the saying goes:
An elder need not be advanced in years;
What matters is broad knowledge and deep insight to be a teacher.
One must not say,
“They studied after me,
How can they now reverse and become my teacher?”
Those who harbor such thoughts
Are not learners of the Dao/Way.
One should humbly yield,
Cede ability,
And defer to virtue,
Following only what is good.
One must not insist on being right while others are wrong.

To attain the Dao/Way and deliver the world, none succeed without a teacher. Learning with a teacher is like a tree having roots. When great wisdom is achieved, it can then cultivate lesser wisdom—just as a tree’s roots produce seeds, and those seeds in turn grow roots, generation after generation, ensuring the species endures. Following a teacher transforms the Dao/Way; when one’s Dao/Way surpasses the teacher’s, one returns to instruct the teacher. This is what is meant by “the Dao/Way is noble, the person is base”—the principle is thus.

All former teachers must be revered and distinguished. Why? The root teacher is the foundation of learning, like a mountain: each basket of soil gradually builds its height. The root teacher is the starting point of enlightenment, while later teachers bring completion. It is like fine attire and adornments—all matters settled, yet without the final crowning, one cannot conduct human affairs. To harbor disdainful thoughts is to misunderstand: in discourse and instruction, the teacher serves as a model for others. If the teacher does not embody the Dao/Way, how can they resolve doubts?

In ancient times, when sages and worthies pursued learning, finding the right teacher was called “rebirth.” Without the right teacher, it was called “confusing the scriptures.” Without a teacher, the Dao/Way does not arise spontaneously. *The Scripture of Great Peace* states: The superior person studies the Dao/Way to assist the emperor’s virtue of cherishing life. The middling person studies the Dao/Way to deliver their family. The inferior person studies the Dao/Way merely to liberate themselves.

It also says: Speaking obstructs the Dao/Way’s completion; excessive speech brings harm. Silence ensures ten thousand years without misfortune. It further states: With a good teacher, even the lowly and common may become virtuous. Virtue, unceasing, leads to worthiness; worthiness, unceasing, leads to sageliness; sageliness, unceasing, leads to profound knowledge of the true Dao/Way. Guarding the Dao/Way without cease leads to immortality; immortality, unceasing, aligns one’s spirit with Heaven. The spirit, unceasing, merges with primordial qi. Attaining primordial qi, one encompasses the eight directions of Heaven and Earth—all things receive this qi and live. Such is the merit of a good teacher. Without a good teacher, one loses the path.

Thus, the transmission from teacher to teacher is firmer than metal and stone. To falsely claim transmission without a teacher is to invite deviation. Abandoning one’s teacher is to abandon the true Dao/Way—self-imposed ruin. The Dao/Way has lineage teachers and ancestral teachers.

*The Jade Record of Settling the True* states: In cultivating the mind, one must not forget even for a moment; only then does the spirit settle. Settled, one enters the Dao/Way, its signs manifesting externally. Guard one’s speech, lest it disturb things; moderate one’s diet, lest greed arise. Wear coarse, quiet clothing, embracing simplicity; dwell in humble seclusion, upholding stillness. Be reverent in all things, avoiding insult; do not presume to lead, to escape jealousy and slander. Maintain pure faith from beginning to end, subtly guiding transformation. Advance and retreat with harmonious light, practicing teaching in secret. Blunt sharpness, resolve entanglements—illuminate the Dao/Way in due time. In action and stillness, transformation reveals the swiftness of divine response.

It also says: The Perfected of the Nine Palaces enter and exit through the Yellow Gate, inquiring about the Dao/Way at the Crimson Terrace. Thus, terraces and gates are placed to the left and right of the Dao/Way to govern extraordinary qi and await the comings and goings of the Perfected.

*The Scripture of the Dao’s Foundation* states: Consuming wheat is beneficial, for wheat contains the sweet beginning. Daoists who master qi eat wheat to transcend the world. It also says: Aligning with the Dao/Way without speech attains the truth of non-being. Day and night without sleep, the light of sun and moon merges; without hunger or thirst, one practices the embryonic breathing of tortoises and dragons. It further states: Those who eat grains are called grain immortals; if they practice without ceasing, they may prolong their longevity. Those who abstain from grains may transcend the world.

It also says: Do not sell my Dao/Way to seek money; do not force my Dao/Way upon the powerful and honored; do not diminish my Dao/Way to flatter the slanderous.

*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: Immortals and Daoists who refine qi do not possess spirits—it is the result of nurturing life, focusing harmonious qi. If a Daoist fears and preserves the spirit, they may sound the Heavenly Drum, its resonance reaching the Great Ultimate.

*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected* states: Daoists studying scriptures and cultivating practices should prioritize the *Five Thousand Characters*. It also says: The Dao/Way has stillness and movement—qi transforms into form, wisdom transforms into sound. It further states: The Emperor’s teaching is the Dao/Way; the Sovereign’s teaching is virtue; the King’s teaching is benevolence.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: Seeking a teacher requires depth and breadth, like crossing the vast sea or reaching distant isles—one’s strength may be lacking, but never should one lament scarcity. What the tiger and leopard discard, the fox and rat covet; what Tao Zhu fled, Yuan Xian lacked. Focus the mind, rely on the teacher, follow the method to practice the Dao/Way—deliver the self, transcend the world, and benefit in eternal prosperity. Serve the teacher with utmost reverence, with attaining the Dao/Way as the goal, observing their demeanor and awaiting their countenance. Failing to fully illuminate the teacher’s Dao/Way incurs ineradicable sin. Learning the Dao/Way with a teacher and clearly serving them prevents harm and chaos from arising.

*The Scripture of the Threefold Non-Being and the True One* states: One who masters the *Great Cavern Scripture of Guarding the One* becomes a teacher.

*The Scripture of the Great Clarity* states: Heaven and Earth rely on the Dao/Way as their resource; the sage relies on the Dao/Way as their teacher. “Resource” means upholding the Dao/Way to nurture all life; “teacher” means instructing those who do not know to achieve completion. It also says: One who masters the *Great Cavern Scripture of Guarding the One* becomes a teacher. Thus, venerating and establishing the root and branches to perfection clarifies the bitterness of Heaven’s warnings, fulfills the expectations of the divine spirits, and ascends the steps to begin. Therefore, teachers and friends fortify the outer; the Three Ones mirror the inner. The Lord of Heaven delights in their words; the infant rejoices in their dwelling.

*Laozi* states: Heaven and Earth rely on the Dao/Way as their resource; the sage relies on the Dao/Way as their teacher. “Resource” means upholding the Dao/Way to nurture all life; “teacher” means instructing those who do not know to achieve completion.

*The Scripture of the Purple Palace of the Highest Clarity* states: Studying scriptures without a teacher’s transmission is stealing Heaven’s treasure.

Receiving without oaths or trust violates Heaven’s Dao/Way. *The Perfected Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* states: The Supreme Mysterious Person’s equality with Heaven and Earth is valued for their ability to teach and guide one another. The earlier awakened return to guide the later awakened, reversing the flow to return to the One Source.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declares: All you gentlemen have accumulated learning to extinguish kalpas and perfect the Dao/Way’s work. Having received these texts to return among the living, you all transcend the void and tread the emptiness, ascending to the Golden Gates to receive titles of spontaneity. Such matters are profound and distant, beyond the clarity of the mortal world. Examining those who prolonged their lives, we find: Master Night Radiance of the Gate of Envy learned from Master High Mound; Master Stone Duke learned from Master Vast Cliff; and Master Grand Peak studied the Five Refinements of the Numinous Treasure’s kalpa-extinction and the transmission of celestial ascent under the Golden Mother.

It further states: *The Orthodox Unity Scriptural Texts* warn: If one seeks profit through street-corner methods, obscures the proper canon, transmits errors through misguided practice, and misleads later generations—later generations, shallow and careless, rashly follow the easy path without seeking lofty virtue—then greed for empty fame, fame without substance, will turn hoped-for blessings into calamity, deepening the disaster. If transmission is entrusted to the unworthy, the Dao/Way is not bestowed in vain. One must ever fear that the frivolous and superficial will swiftly generate slander, inviting disaster and incurring grave offenses. Thus, trust is established, and the heart’s sincerity becomes the basis for bestowal, with distinctions made in the act of transmission and reception.

*The Scripture of the Cavernous Perfection* states: In cultivating the Dao/Way of the Great One, one must avoid seeing blood and filth, and weeping is also forbidden. *The Scripture of Great Possession* states: Those who receive the precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity must not weep. *The Scripture of the Mystic Mother’s Eight Gates* states: In storing the essence of the Golden Flower and the Feminine One, one must strictly guard against weeping, which disturbs the body with excessive sorrow.

*Second Section of the Daoist Canon*

The Perfected Ones, Above

*The Scripture of the Supreme* states: Within the Great Tenuous Heaven, there are twenty-four intermingled qi, yellow and variegated, coalescing—possessing names but no qi, transforming into Perfected Ones. The accumulation and completion of the Dao/Way entrusts form and establishes shadow; soaring with time, possessing names but no bodies, these are called Perfected Ones.

*The Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* states: Those who diligently cultivate and attain the Dao/Way shall inscribe it upon petal-tablets and carve it in jade script, ascending to the rank of Left Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity. It further states: Dragon robes, phoenix mantles, and tiger belts are all offerings presented to the Thearch by the Perfected of the Armies.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Central August Lord is a disciple of the Heavenly Thearch. From birth, he knew the essentials of long life and the methods of celestial transcendents. Early in life, he encountered profound resonance, whereupon the Supreme bestowed upon him *The Nine Perfected Scriptures of the Thearch* and *The Eight Secret Chapters of the Dao/Way*. Upon completion of the Dao/Way, he was granted scriptures and became the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate. It further states: The Perfected One of Pure Emptiness received the *Three Leaping Methods* from the Perfected One of the Primal Simplicity; the Perfected One of Paulownia Cypress cultivated the *Sword-Releasing Method*. Possessing *The Supreme’s Leaping Sun Script*, he attained the rank of Perfected One of the Lower Origin. It further states: Those who do not know the Hidden Dao/Way of Returning to the Origin may not have their names inscribed among the Highest Perfected. The Return to the Origin is the day of the Supreme’s renewal; on that day, one must constantly contemplate and dwell upon auspicious matters. It further states: Falsehood is the illness of virtue; ostentation is the calamity of the body.

Those who cling to stagnation are the cause of loss; those who bear shame and disgrace stain their conduct. Only after dispelling these four flaws may one inquire into the Dao/Way. One with a heart of lewd ostentation cannot practice the Dao/Way of the Highest Perfected. Yesterday, I witnessed the names of such individuals being struck from the registers of the Palace of Pure Emptiness, and their cases were further examined and handed over to the Three Officials—how could one not be cautious?

The talents of the Perfected Immortals of the Purple Tenuity shine inwardly and are discerning outwardly. Their names are recorded in the Great Ultimate, inscribed in gold upon the Eastern Land. Once the inner obstructions are stilled, one must accumulate without cease.

It further states: Those who examine the root of the Dao/Way become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity. Those who fully master the esoteric methods of the Perfected Immortals and perfect the *Dao of the Thorny Obstruction* become Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces. If one fully possesses each of these Dao/Way, then one becomes a Perfected One of the Great Ultimate.

It further states: Refining the form in the Great Yin, altering one’s appearance before the Three Officials, receiving instruction in transforming the spirit, bathing in radiance to exchange qi, and moving in harmony with the four seasons—thus may one become a Perfected One.

*The Scripture of the Golden Root* states: The Heavenly Chart and Jade Pass are where the host of Perfected Ones gather for feasts and revelry. It further states: Above the Heavenly Pass stand six-tiered jade terraces, where the Perfected Ones of the Highest Lord assemble for banquets. It further states: In the northern hall of the Jade Guardian’s Azure Palace hangs a golden lattice, upon which rest golden seals, phoenix-stamped tallies, jade tablets, cinnabar writings, feathered canopies, and the ritual robes of those who attain perfection.

*The Scripture of Great Possession* states: In the Azure Palace of Jade Splendor are treasured scriptures and jade instructions, which are bestowed upon those who become Perfected Ones. It further states: *The Supreme’s Primal Numinous Cavern Mystery Scripture* transforms the Three Perfected. *The Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: The Dao/Way has Three Perfected, which must never leave the body. The Purple Radiance transforms the luminous form, and the Three Lights illumine the Perfected.

*The Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Within the Great Nonbeing Mountain lies the Cavern Palace’s Jade Portal, atop the lofty peaks of Mount Emei, where the names of all Perfected Immortals who attain the Dao/Way are inscribed. It further states: Above the clouds stands the Palace of Highest Clarity, its gates flanked by two towers—left the Golden Tower, right the Jade Tower—guarded by feather-robed sentinels. Within flows the Jade Mushroom and Flowing Radiance Spring, where golden inscriptions record the names of the soaring Perfected Immortals and Flying Transcendents. It further says: Within the Jade Clarity is the Palace of Great Radiance, where the Jade Perfected gather for feasts and revelry. It further states: The Nine Perfected Lords of the Immortals are the sovereigns who enforce the prohibitions of the Highest Lord. The *Washing of the Tassels* is the Pool of the Imperial River. It further states: The Highest One of the Supreme Origin is the overseer of the myriad immortals.

The Perfected One of the Sacred Peaks’ True Qi, the Perfected One of the Highest Lord, treads the path of the Five Stars to descend into the chamber.

*The Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: The Crimson City and Vermilion Windows are the transcendent realm of the Highest Clarity, the inner abode of the Supreme Unity’s Three Perfected Treasure Hall. It further states: The Perfected One of the Highest Clarity, the Grand Marshal of the Host of Immortals and Master of Longevity Methods, ascends the Azure Terrace of the Great Emperor’s Vast Wave Mountain, entering the twin jade caverns to drink deeply of the Purple Radiance Mushroom Nectar. It further states: Those who preserve the spirit through longevity love mountains and waters, for benevolence and wisdom govern their movement and stillness. Those who rely on benevolence are tranquil and long-lived; those who rely on wisdom are active and joyful. One should submit a petition, sending one’s name to exalt benevolence and wisdom, inscribing it in cinnabar on a white slip to transfer one’s register to the Highest Clarity. Kindling the incense burner and bowing, one wraps the slip in green paper and green silk, binding it to a rock upon a cliff. Boarding a boat upon the waters, one reads the petition midstream, attaching one’s name to it—thus may one surely summon the Perfected.

*The Inner Instructions of the Nine Perfected Central Scripture of the Highest Clarity* states: The Duke of the Jade Guardian was sent down by the Primal Simplicity to welcome those of the Nine Perfected. It further states: Those who wish to practice the methods of the Nine Perfected must purify themselves in a secluded chamber, for the Heavenly Thearch records their deeds.

*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected* states: The Feathered Immortals and Attendant Gentlemen of the Upper Capital Bureau oversee the ranking of positions. They govern the Jade Perfected and the Perfected Ones of the Highest Lord within the Flowery Chambers of the Five Peaks. Without one’s name in the immortal registers, one may not witness them. When the cinnabar slips are reviewed and names are recorded in the Southern Palace... It further states: The Golden Tower of the Vacuous Sovereign is the most noble and exalted of the Jade Emperor’s domains, named *Self-So*, for none can make it so, and none can make it otherwise. Harmonizing one’s light with others, appearing similar yet remaining distinct—only those who attain the Dao/Way can comprehend this.

It further states: In the Highest Clarity’s Yu-Yu Heaven are Three Perfected Officials who govern those guilty of excessive punishment, secret malevolence, treachery, jealousy toward the worthy, vacillation, and defilement or disrespect toward the Perfected Ones.

*The Hidden Writings of Jade Clarity* states: Those whose names are inscribed in the Golden Lattice become Perfected Ones of the Three Heavens, bearing the Tiger Talismans of the Perfected Sovereigns at the Highest Ultimate’s supreme rank. The Highest Perfected ride winged dragons; the Middle Perfected hold purple staffs; the Lower Perfected attend the Great Ultimate’s tripartite chariot. It further states: The Supreme Tenuity is where the Heavenly Thearch commands the Perfected Ones of the Supreme Tenuity to exhort the host of spirits. It further states: The Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereign commands the Dark-Feathered Perfected One to welcome the Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity, and further commands the Perfected One of the Highest Lord to open the pearl-studded coffer, bringing forth *The Hidden Writings of the Jade Perfected* and *The Scripture of the Dark-Feathered One* to transmit to the sovereign of the Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity.

*The Scripture of the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds* states: The Perfected Ones scatter incense in the Jade Court. It further says: They disperse the hundred-harmonized incense and scatter the blossoms of the five clouds to behold the Flying Heavenly Perfected Ones. It further states: The Perfected Ones of the Four Poles oversee the registers of human destiny, constantly riding the *Mengzhen* chariots to review the records of human transgressions. It further states: The Nine-Splendor Perfected One governs within the Southern Upper Palace, reviewing human merits and transgressions, with the Three Officials presenting their reports.

It further states: The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign says: The great Brahma’s hidden language of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, in its natural jade characters, was commanded by the Highest Lord to be annotated and explained in its correct pronunciation by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, sufficient to enlighten and deliver the heavenly and human realms.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: The Jasper Terrace of Kunlun is where the true scriptures are reviewed and established. The highest grade resides in the Highest Clarity, comparable to the dignity of emperors and sovereigns. The middle grade dwells in the Middle Dao/Way, equivalent to the ranks of dukes and ministers. The lowest grade resides at the end of the Three Origins, akin to the ranks of great officers. The scriptures of the Three Perfected grades each have their proper order.

The *Sanmei* Perfected, riding a wind-and-cloud dragon chariot, descends to guard those who observe the fast. The *Taisu* Perfected transmits the method for dispelling nightmares in beginners. The *Jinhua* Perfected engraves the *Great Cavern Upper Scripture* upon the eastern wall of the casement in the Jade Forest Hall of the Celestial Emperor’s Purple Tenuity Palace. The *Taixu* Perfected expounds the *Scripture of the Great Raven*, while the *Taiji* Perfected recites the verses of the Queen Mother of the West. The *Dianjin* Perfected examines the good and evil of men, and the *Miaoxing* Perfected reckons the reckoning of kalpas.

It is further said: On the midday of the *Lichun* day, the *Taiji* Perfected regularly convenes with all immortals in the *Taiji* Palace, engraving jade tablets to record the names of immortals. By the midday of the *Chunfen* day, at the Jasper Terrace of Kunlun, the *Taisu* Perfected gathers all immortals to review and establish the true scriptures. The Jasper Terrace of Kunlun is the palace of the Queen Mother of the West, known as the Western Jasper Upper Terrace, where all the secret texts of the Heavenly Perfected are contained. The *Taisu* Perfected governs upon the White Water Sandbar, where the true scriptures are established.

On the midday of the *Lixia* day, the Five Emperors of Highest Clarity convene with all immortals in the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Four Perfected Ones deliberate upon the merits and transgressions of those who seek the Dao/Way. By the midday of the *Xiazhi* day, the Three Officials of Heaven gather at the River of Life’s Command to review and determine the sins and blessings of all people, increasing or decreasing their allotted years. On the midday of the *Liqiu* day, the Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks proceed to the Central Yellow Chamber to establish the sacred maps and efficacious medicines of the world. By the midday of the *Lidong* day, the *Yangtai* Perfected assembles the ranks of immortals to determine those newly attained to the Dao/Way, who are then first entered into the *Record of Named Immortals*. On the midday of the *Dongzhi* day, all immortals proceed to the *Fangzhu* Palace, where the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea engraves their names in golden script within the inner characters of the immortal register.

All who study the Dao/Way should regularly, at midnight and midday, offer repentance for their transgressions, whereby their sins shall be erased, and they may refine themselves and return to goodness, seeking long life and transcendence. At the *Qiufen* season, when qi resides in clarity and emptiness, it is the true day of Great Harmony. On this day, all the Perfected and immortals hear grievances, expose corrupt officials, and all the immortal officials within their jurisdictions impeach and report the merits and transgressions of Daoist practitioners everywhere, as well as the sins of sentient beings deserving of life or death. Thus, the *True Record of Immortal Taboos* states: "If you wish to ascend to heaven, be cautious at the autumnal equinox; no sin, great or small, shall escape notice." These are the essential words of Master Zhongyang of the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Mound Palace.

It is also said: These words derive from the *Arrayed Records*, wherein the Azure Lad transmitted the sayings of the Ancient Perfected to the Gong family, stating that sins and blessings, however minute, are engraved in the registers of the Cinnabar City. Nothing is concealed—every hidden virtue and every secret evil, however slight, is meticulously recorded.

It is further said: The Dao/Way of the Highest Perfected comprises seven scriptures: first, the *Supreme Shang’s Text of Racing the Sun*; second, the *Supreme Shang’s Chapter of Binding Neighbors and Racing the Moon*; third, the *Supreme Shang’s Eight Simplicities Chapter of Racing the Stars*; fourth, the *Flying Heavenly Scripture of the Grand Tenuity*; fifth, the *Supreme Great Cavern True Scripture*; sixth, the *Purple Text of the Numinous Book of the Golden Watchtower*; and seventh, the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*.

The rank of the Highest Perfected corresponds to the emperors of all heavens. When they proceed, they are preceded by thirty-seven colored banners and ten thousand Perfected Ones.

The Dao/Way of the Middle Perfected comprises six scriptures: the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir*, the *Mysterious Text of the Nine Perfected*, the *Golden Writs of the Supreme Shang*, the *Upper Scripture of the Fangzhu*, the *Inner Text of the Three Sovereigns*, and the *Purple Book of Oral Instructions and Registers*. The rank of the Middle Perfected belongs to the ranks of ministers and chancellors of Highest Clarity. They bear purple plumes and hold jade tablets, serving as attendants to the Jade Emperor.

The Dao/Way of the Lower Perfected comprises eight scriptures: the *Seven Transformations of Highest Clarity*, the *Eight Arts of Concealing the Earth*, the *Jade Book of the Mysterious Sovereign*, the *Cavern Scripture of the Divine Continent*, the *Central Methods of the Purple Court*, the *Yellow Dao Register of Descents*, the *Central Chapters of Plain Memorials*, and the *Jade Book of the Upper Origin*. The rank of the Lower Perfected corresponds to the ranks of great officers of Highest Clarity. They bear five-colored banners and streamers, flying in inverted reflection.

It is further said: Those who obtain and behold the *Sacred Arrayed Records* shall have their names written in dark thread and memorialized to Highest Clarity, whereupon they shall be appointed as immortal ministers. If they can perform the true affairs of the Golden Watchtower, they shall be enfeoffed as great officers. This is because the *Arrayed Records* are weightier than the *Purple Texts*. Merely seeing them is not merely a matter of receiving and wearing them; rather, it means understanding the relative importance of the scriptures contained therein, the ladder of seeking the Dao/Way, and pursuing study accordingly. Thus, it surpasses the mere observance of the singular affairs of the *Purple Texts*.

The *Jade Register of the Supreme Sovereign* states: The Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, who bear jade registers as they traverse mountains and rivers, shall have the spirits of rivers and seas come forth to welcome and clear their path. The *Hidden Book of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Zhongji* Perfected governs the registers of human lifespans; the *Jiuhua* Perfected presides over the karmic retributions of the Nine Dark Realms, determining life and death; the *Taiyuan* Perfected receives the celestial talismans and delivers the souls of the long night; the *Taiji* Perfected governs the Jade Cavern Prefecture of the Red City, overseeing the records of life and death on Mount Tai; the *Sanyuan* Perfected governs the practice of the Dao/Way in the Purple Tenuity.

The *Jade Instructions of the Red Book* states: On the fourteenth day of every month, the Celestial Perfected Sovereign of the Supreme Emperor commands the Envoys of the Great One to descend and travel together with the Envoys of the Northern Zhengdu and the Earls, inspecting the merits and transgressions of men and spirits, reporting them to the Upper Offices. Additionally, the Eight Divine Envoys of the Great One of the Kalpa descend with the Three Officials to inspect the good and evil of heaven and earth, reporting them accordingly. They also dispatch the Nine Divisions of Censor-Officers to patrol the Five Peaks, the Three Palaces, and the Water Palaces, rectifying ghostly affairs, overseeing the merits and transgressions of men, and reporting them to heaven.

The *White Feather Scripture* states: The *Tai* Perfected, ascending a white simurgh chariot and driving a black phoenix from the Nine Sources, is unmatched in virtue from heaven downward. Moreover, the *Taiji* Perfected possesses the fine countenance of an immortal, which fundamentally arises from a compassionate heart that nurtures all things. Only then can one attain transcendence. If one cannot restrain one’s nature, the immortal countenance shall be ruined. Thus, in cultivating the Dao/Way and meeting the Perfected, one must take essence and thought as the foundation, spirit as the root, and enter contemplation by preserving spirit. Stillness and mindfulness must come first.

The *Great Kalpa Scripture* states: The *Shangjing* Perfected leads the world’s forces to release the Mother of the Great Flood of the Upper Origin, dredging the myriad rivers. The *Scripture of the Empty Sea* states: The *Hejian* is the hidden abode of heavenly beings, where upon jade towers are arrayed the halls of the Perfected and immortals. Moreover, the Highest Perfected, whose bodies are imbued with true qi, possess luminous jade eyes.

*The Southern Perfected Transmission* states: Yesterday, I accompanied Shu Jia to the Palace of Pure Emptiness to review the records of Perfected Immortals’ gains and losses. Recently, forty-seven were abruptly removed, while only three were promoted. Among them, Nei Mingzhenzheng is truly exceptional.

The Nine-Palace Perfected enter and exit through the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace. The space between them is the Dao/Way, and thus the terraces and gates are placed to its left and right to observe the extraordinary qi of the Perfected as they come and go.

*The Scripture of the Supreme Orthodox Dharma* states: The Nine Perfected are formed from the true qi of the Nine Heavens. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Perfected are born of the Grand Clarity, the settled qi of the Primordial Beginning. Each is assigned palaces in sequence. The officials guarding the Upper Clarity Palace are the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, sovereign of the myriad Perfected. Dwelling in the Jade Hall, he composes the sacred scriptures of the Supreme Emperor, which serve as treasured canons in the Jade Clarity Palace to guide later students toward attaining Perfection.

*The Scripture of the Three Origins’ Precepts* states: The Purple Tenuity Palace observes the rites of extending life. It is also said that the Jade Controller of the Vermilion Emperor, Yujingdu, governs the Crimson Yang Terrace in the south, overseeing the Upper Perfected.

Master Jinglin of the Perfected said: Through diligent cultivation over many lifetimes, one’s thoughts turn to the Perfected and one’s aspirations to the numinous. The August Mirror perceives this devotion to the Supreme Ultimate, inscribing one’s name upon the Jade Register. Thus, in fine script upon the Palace of Purple Emptiness, in vermilion upon the Eastern Florescence Pavilion, one’s name is carved in the Upper Clarity, recorded in cinnabar and brocade ledgers.

*The Numinous Chapters of the Empty Cavern* states: The Perfected pluck the *ao* zither, blow the flutes of the Nine Phoenixes, and play the reed pipes of the Divine Continent. Their music soars, its echoes cascading a thousand fathoms.

*The Later Sage’s Arrayed Records* states: The Later Sage of the Golden Gate of the Upper Clarity, in his youth, delighted in the Dao/Way and rejoiced in the Perfected. In the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Upper Perfected Celestial Emperor, he was bestowed the Purple Elixir, the Rigid Cinnabar, and the Phoenix Seal, enabling him to dwell in the Upper Clarity, wander the Supreme Ultimate, descend to govern the various heavens, and be enfeoffed to oversee the multitudes.

*The Immortal Records* states: In practicing the affairs of the Great Unity and the Dao/Way of the Perfected, one must not bow in physical prostration—only in the heart, without bending the form. Contemplating the Perfected and practicing the Dao/Way, one’s understanding becomes boundless. Manifestations appear in due time, and ascent to Perfection is swift.

*The Upper Chapter of the Black Register* states: The Sagely Perfected and Immortals together practice virtue and power, all venerating the Supreme Mystery.

*The Scripture of Precept Texts* states: The Supreme Perfected dwell in the Immortal Courts; all who attain immortality in the world must first pass through here.

*The Scripture of the Natural Jade Characters* states: Within the Seven Treasures Grove lies the pleasure garden of the Upper Perfected and the playground of the Perfected.

*The Jade Book of the Grand Empyrean* states: The Jade Scion of the Primordial August, ascending to the Supreme Perfected, governs the Two Modes. In the Mysterious Garden, he holds the Jade Register; among the myriad immortals, he oversees the earthly realm; over the Five Marchmounts, he commands the Upper Perfected; at the Three Passes, he presides over the boundless. Below, he governs the Cavernous Sources, and from heaven downward, none are not subject to him.

It further states: The Three Origins Lord of the Grand Simplicity receives the numinous harmony of the Jade Emperor’s upper qi. Thus, he coalesces within the Void, embracing the true and radiant, his mechanism wondrously merging with the spirit, his luminous Dao/Way encompassing the Nine Mysteries. His breath precedes all signs, responding to all things in accord—this is the congealing of the Supreme.

*The Jade Scripture of the Four Illuminations of the Supreme* states: The Dao/Way of the Perfected Immortals takes the ears and eyes as its foundation. Indulgence in lust dims the eyes; excessive affection dulls the ears. These two afflictions arise from within and rush outward. There is no other remedy—only by enhancing clarity and ease. Yet one must refrain from such indulgences, purifying the heart and severing desires, casting aside lust and greed. This is called "strictness at the outset." Safeguarding the paired gates, opening the nine portals, morning saliva ascending to the Mud-Pill Palace, one is arrayed among the Upper Perfected. Vision extends far, hearing reaches the faintest sounds—this is the loftiness of the Perfected Immortals, surpassing mere acuity of ears and eyes.

*The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* states: The Highest Jade Clarity’s hidden inscription on stone reads: Dengdu Mountain lies in the north, containing an empty cavern within which are six palaces. This inscription is carved on the northern wall of the palace to restrain the myriad malevolent forces, preventing their wanton violence. Those who study the Dao/Way and carry this inscribed stone will have their names stricken from the Northern Feng Register and their lives spared in the Southern Palace, becoming Perfected.

*The Scripture of Great Peace* states: Those who attain the Dao/Way in later study possess varying ranks, ascending to the ultimate Sagely Perfected Immortals.

*The Scripture of the Jade Register of Settled Perfection* states: Those who wish to settle their minds must first receive the Jade Register of Settled Perfection from the August Sovereign of the Uppermost. This is the foremost essential for students. Only by first settling the mind can the name of an immortal be secured—this is the Orthodox Unity of the Three Heavens, the register first bestowed to determine one’s immortal name.

*The Scripture of the Supreme* states: The Jade Clarity is like jade—unyielding and indestructible, unstained by slander. Unwavering and pure, all defilements are exhausted, singular and unadulterated—thus is one called a Perfected.

*The Cinnabar Slips of the Supreme* states: All who study the Dao/Way and dwell in the position of the Perfected have their names entered in the Southern Palace.

*The Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmonious Practice* states: Harmonizing virtue and entering the Dao/Way is called "Perfected." The Supreme dispatches the Four Poles Perfected to welcome them, bestowing the texts of the Three Heavens’ Numinous Registers in the Upper Clarity Palace.

*The Eight Radiant Scriptures of the Upper Clarity* states: After a hundred days of concentrated contemplation, the Perfected descend in form.

Ge Xuan’s *Preface to the Five Thousand Characters* states: Through concentrated contemplation, one’s aspirations reach far and high, prompting the Supreme to send Perfected to descend and confer the subtle and profound principles. It further states: In tranquil contemplation, awaiting the Perfected, the myriad wonders respond in harmony. Inwardly observing one’s form and shadow, spirit and qi endure; embodying virtue and power, the hundred spirits submit in awe.

*The Feminine Unity Chapter of the Great Cavern* states: A golden countenance shines in the Eastern Florescence; a jade form delights at the Emperor’s Gate. The spirit illumines the Five Elders, leaping through the Three Origins. Crowned with treasured radiance, one floats among the Nine Dawns, dispersing forms and scattering light, attaining the rank of Upper Perfected.

*The Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: One must seek the Dao/Way and pursue the Perfected with loyalty and integrity, reforming evil and embracing goodness. Only then can one become a Perfected.

*The Scripture of the Three Origins’ Jade Tallies* states: On the ninth day of the ninth month in the gengyin year of the sexagenary cycle, the Primordial Beginning convened an oath at the Palace of Supreme Purity, bestowing the Jade Tallies of the Three Origins to be transmitted to later disciples. Those whose mystic names correspond shall become Perfected of the Supreme Purity.

**Section Two of the Daoist Canon Concludes**
**Section Three of the Daoist Canon: The Perfected Below**

*The Records of Immortals Gathered* states: The Queen Mother is the Metal Mother of Mount Tortoise. The essence of the Western Florescence’s purest qi transformed and gave birth to the Metal Mother, who emerged already soaring, dwelling in the utmost yin origin, her position paired with the West. She nurtures all beings, and her palaces reside in the gardens of Kunlun within the precincts of Mount Chong, the Parks of Langfeng. Her city spans a thousand *li*, with twelve towers—none may reach it save by chariots of jade or feathered wheels. Her disheveled hair and tiger teeth are not her true form but the numinous manifestation of the Metal Realm. The Primordial Beginning conferred upon her the Register of the Nine Lights of Mount Tortoise under the governance of the Myriad Heavens’ Primordial Unity, empowering her to command the ten thousand spirits, marshal the host of Perfected, and lead the feathered retinues of all heavens. At the celestial feasts of the Heavenly Emperor, she presides over the precious scriptures of the Supreme Purity, the jade texts of the Three Caverns—all transmissions and initiations fall within her purview.

During the reign of the Yellow Emperor, the Queen Mother dispatched envoys riding white deer to his court, presenting him with a terrestrial map. Later, during the reign of Emperor Shun, she sent messengers bearing a white jade ring and an expanded terrestrial map. Thus, the nine provinces of the Yellow Emperor were extended to twelve. She also bestowed upon Shun a jade flute to harmonize the eight winds.

*The Verified Era of the Divine Emperors* states: The Queen Mother’s realm lies in the Western Wilderness. All who attain the Dao and receive scriptures pay homage to her at the gates of Kunlun.

Wang Bao, styled Zideng, purified himself for three months, whereupon the Queen Mother bestowed upon him the *Seven Dawns’ Luminous Scripture of Jade Blossoms*. Mao Ying, following the Western City’s Perfected Lord, journeyed to the White Jade Tortoise Terrace to pay homage to the Queen Mother and seek the Dao of longevity. The Queen Mother transmitted to him the *Scripture of Mystic Perfection* and granted him the *Precious Writs of the Youthful Scatterer* for dissemination in the four directions.

During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he bridged the Weak Waters with beams of giant turtles, fish, and soft-shelled turtles to ascend the wilds of Kunlun’s Mystic Gardens and the Parks of Langfeng, where he met the Queen Mother. They sang the *Ballad of White Clouds*, and he carved an inscription at the foot of Yan Mountain before returning.

Emperor Wu of Han, devoted to the Dao of longevity, in the first year of the Yuanfeng era, ascended Mount Song to construct the Terrace of Seeking the Perfected. After purifying himself and contemplating the Dao, the Queen Mother descended on the seventh day of the seventh month in a chariot of purple clouds, drawn by nine-hued mottled dragons. She bore the staff of the Heavenly Perfected, the seal of adamantine spirit, and a robe of yellow brocade, its golden radiance resplendent. Her sash was woven with patterns of flying clouds, her crown the *Celestial Grand Perfected’s Dawn Tassel*, her slippers adorned with phoenixes of square jasper. Her celestial bearing was majestic, a being beyond mortal comparison.

Alighting from her chariot, she leaned upon two attendants to ascend the dais, seating herself facing east. She commanded her attendants to bring peaches, which they presented on a jade platter—seven in total. Four she gave to the Emperor, and three she consumed herself. The Emperor wished to collect the pits for planting, but the Queen Mother said: “This peach bears fruit but once in three thousand years. The soil of the central lands is too meager; it will not grow here.”

When asked about the Dao of longevity, she replied: “To scorn glory and delight in humility is itself excellent. The Dao of nurturing life and the essence of governing the body lie in ceaseless cultivation. Those who seek longevity must first master their own bodies, firmly guard the Three Ones, and preserve the root of spirit. Let clarity and purity ascend to the Muddy Pellet; let the Three Palaces be fully defended within the Crimson Palace. Let the Yellow Court’s earthly forces remain unscattered—this is what is meant by breathing the Great Harmony, preserving the natural, and embodying the true essential Dao.”

“As for the supreme elixirs of the Most High, they are the marvels of the Celestial Emperor. The wondrous herbs of the Lower Yin and the layered clouds are all medicines of the immortals. Those who obtain the highest grade age only after heaven’s decree, for these are consumed by the Most High—treasures not for middling immortals. The middle grade, if attained, allows one to wander after heaven’s decree, for these are consumed by the Heavenly Perfected—beyond the reach of lesser immortals. The next rank of medicines includes the Nine Elixirs, Golden Liquor, Purple Rainbow’s Floral Essence, the Ninefold Transmutations of the Great Clarity, the Five Clouds’ Nectar, Mystic Frost and Crimson Snow, the Three Yellows’ Ascension, Eastern Sea’s White Fragrance, the Flying Life of the Dark Continent, the Eight Stones and Thousand Fungi, the Nine Lights of Majestic Joy, the Western Flow’s Stone Gall, the Eastern Sea’s Azure Coin, the Remnant Roots of High Mounds, the Jade Fields of Accumulated Stones, the Great Numinous Returning Elixir—stored in golden orchids, the Crimson Grass of Eternal Light, the Flying Youth of Cloud Children. These are consumed by flying immortals, unknown to earthbound immortals.”

“The lesser medicines—such as fuling, calamus, sesame, and Solomon’s seal—can extend one’s years. Though they do not grant boundless longevity, they bestow a radiant complexion and the status of an earthbound immortal. Seekers of the Dao must first rely on these steps, gradually advancing to greater heights. If one can master breath and ingestion, safeguarding spirit and qi, this is the natural essential Dao of the highest grade.”

“Moreover, the heavens bestow spirit upon the individual, the earth bestows form, and the Dao bestows qi—even the myriad plants and trees are the same. The body takes the Dao as its root; how can one not nurture spirit and secure qi to preserve one’s form? When form and spirit are both whole, this is what the supreme sages prize.”

The Queen Mother commanded the Lady of the Upper Primordial to present the Emperor with the *Writings of the Eight Assemblies*, the *True Charts of the Five Peaks*, the *Talismans of the Five Emperors and Six Jias’ Spirit Flight*—twelve items in all. Yet he could not apply their teachings and was much perplexed. Later, after three sacrifices to the Queen Mother, she descended again, placing the transmitted scriptures upon the Cypress Beam Terrace, where they were consumed by heavenly fire. Li Shaojun departed by dissolving his form, and the affair of the witchcraft arose, leaving the Emperor ever more remorseful.

Furthermore: The Great Mao Lord Ying governed the southern slopes of Mount Juqu. In the second year of the Yuan Shou era, on the yiyou day of the eighth month, the Perfected Lord of the Southern Peak, the Red Lord, the Western City’s Perfected Lord Fang, and the Azure Lad Zhuge descended with the Queen Mother into Mao Ying’s chamber. The Queen Mother also commanded the Lady of the Upper Primordial to transmit to Ying’s younger brothers, Mao Gu and Mao Zhong, the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*.

Later, the Purple Spirit Primordial Lady Wei Huacun purified herself in fasting upon the Hidden Primordial Terrace of Mount Yangluo. The Queen Mother and the Golden Portal Sage Lord descended into the terrace, riding the Eight Radiance Chariot together to the Clear Void Upper Palace, where they transmitted four scrolls of the *Jade Clarity Hidden Writ* to Lady Wei. At that time, the Perfected Lords of the Great Void sang the *Song of the Supreme Ultimate*, and the Queen Mother said:

*"Wandering the boundless mystery’s edge,
Ten thousand currents never pause.
Once this moment passes, reunion waits
Till kalpas end and heaven-earth collapse.
Seek the scene within the nothingness—
Neither death nor life shall bind you then.
Clothed in the Dao of spontaneity,
Serene contemplation merges with the Great Obscurity.
The Southern Peak’s true trunk stands firm,
Jade’s radiance gleams in essence’s glow.
Those who bear no burden in their tasks
Empty their hearts to receive the numinous.
A joyous gathering by the Crimson River’s bend,
Together we delight without end."*

The Queen Mother then returned to Tortoise Terrace.

The *Scripture of the Three Ones* states: The Yellow Emperor roamed the Spirit Terrace beneath the sheer cliffs of Mount Qingcheng, where he beheld the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign dwelling in a house of azure jade, its groves of yellow jade, its curtains of kingfisher silk, with attendants all celestial beings.

It further states: Gao Qiuzi, a man of the Shang dynasty, loved the Dao and entered the Six Radiance Mountains. For years, he studied only the *Yellow Plain Daoist Scriptures* and ingested tree essences. Later, he consumed the *Vast Elixir*, attained earthly immortality, and wandered the Five Peaks. He then drank the *Golden Liquid* and became a Perfected Lord of the Central Peak.

It further states: Guo Chongzi, also of the Shang dynasty, was a disciple of Perfected Lord Peng. Once, while traveling in the mountains, bandits exhausted Chong. His disciples wished to pursue and capture them, but Chong said, "Let them go." Later, the bandit entered official service, and Chong praised him. The man visited repeatedly, but each time he declined, saying, "I was once a thief and cannot accept the commendation of a great gentleman." He then took his own life. Later, Chong attained the Dao, but the Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate deemed him guilty of causing a death and thus unfit to become a Perfected Lord. If even an excess of goodness can lead to another’s demise, how much worse the consequences of evil?

It further states: During the reign of Duke Zhuang of Chu, the market overseer Song Laizi would sweep the marketplace daily. After some time, an old beggar entered the market, singing as he wandered through the day:

*"The Celestial Court blooms with twin flowers,
The mountain’s source reveals yin’s perversity.
At dawn, mount the Heavenly Steed,
Come to the Great Perfected’s home.
The Perfected has no way to hide,
And thus dispels a hundred demons."*

He sang this while begging, yet none in the market understood—only Laizi suspected he was a Perfected Lord, though he did not fully grasp the song’s meaning. He then followed the old man and became his disciple. After more than a decade, the old man transmitted to him the Dao of Middle Immortality. Laizi now resides on the Central Peak. The beggar was Perfected Lord Feng Yanshou of the Western Peak, a man of the reign of King Xuan of Zhou.

*"Celestial Court"* refers to the space beneath the two brows, the bridge of penetrating vision, also called the *Flowering Court*. *"Mountain’s source"* is the base of the nose, the root of the philtrum, where it slightly enters the valley. *"Heavenly Steed"* refers to the hands. Pressing the hands to the base of the nose severs the hundred perversities.

It further states: Perfected Lord Yin Xi was a grandee of Zhou. As Keeper of the Pass, he was fond of learning from youth, skilled in celestial patterns and esoteric weft-texts, such that ghosts and spirits could not conceal their forms from him. Neither glory nor disgrace altered his countenance. His heart longed for freedom, his nature profoundly tranquil. One day, ascending a tower to gaze in all directions, he saw a purple vapor advancing westward from the eastern horizon. He said, "The yang numbers are exhausted, the Nine Stars align, and the years and months converge—this must herald an extraordinary person passing through." He then purified himself, swept the road, and awaited the arrival. When Laozi crossed the pass, Yin first instructed the pass officers: "If an old man riding a black ox in a thin-planked cart appears, do not let him pass. Detain him and report to me." As expected, he arrived. The officers reported, and Yin requested a brief delay.

Yin Xi, bearing his official seals and ribbons, performed the rites due to a master, but Laozi firmly declined. Yin Xi said, "I wish you would compose a book for me, expounding the meaning of the Great Dao, that I may receive and practice it." Thereupon, Laozi wrote the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* in two scrolls, the upper and the lower. Yin Xi then departed together for the Dark Continent to assume the office of Supreme Minister.

The *Biography of Su Lin* states: Lin, styled Zixuan, was a native of Qu Shui in Puyang. His father, Xiu, concealed his virtue and hid his brilliance, dwelling on Mount Heng. From youth, Lin was endowed with extraordinary conduct. He first studied under Master Qin Gao of Zhao, receiving the Way of refining qi to prolong life. Later, he studied under Master Qiu of Mount Hua, who taught him the art of returning the spirit, declaring, "You are a true person." He was then to be introduced to Master Juan, but before this could be accomplished, Master Qiu imparted the true essentials to Lin. The master said, "To become a true person upon the earth, you must first expel the Three Corpses." Subsequently, Lin received from the True Person of Purple Yang over two hundred essentials of the Dao. As for guarding the Dark Elixir Chamber and the Cavern Palace, the Three Primordials True Person fully inscribed his name above. Lin became the True Person of the Central Marchmount.

The *Biography of Lord Mao* states: Ying, styled Shushen, was a native of Xianxiang. His father, Zuo, had three sons, of whom Ying was the youngest. From youth, Ying was endowed with extraordinary conduct, transcending worldly customs and resisting conformity. He sought neither fame nor advancement and kept no company with the unworthy. He entered Mount Heng, where he read the *Laozi* and the *Book of Changes* and consumed pine needles, remaining secluded in the mountains for six years. His concentrated devotion to the Dao and sincere aspiration evoked a mysterious response. In a dream, the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery held a jade knife and led him, saying, "In the Western City, there is a Lord Wang who has attained the true Dao. You may take him as your master." At dawn, he set out in search of him and, upon reaching the Western City, purified himself for three months. At last, he beheld Lord Wang. Ying then bowed his head twice in reverence and earnestly entreated the art of longevity. He was permitted to reside in the Tower of Flowing Radiance within the Western City, in the Upper Palace of Gold and Jade, where he attended Lord Wang day and night, performing the duties of a servant, holding his towel and sandals. For seventeen years, he remained single-minded and unwavering. After two more years, Lord Wang commanded his carriage to ascend White Jade Turtle Mountain, where he paid homage to the Queen Mother in the Azure Forest Palace, taking Ying with him. When Lord Wang prostrated before the Queen Mother, Ying also bowed twice and presented himself before her, receiving the essential Way of governing the body. After practicing these arts for several decades upon returning home, during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, celestial officials descended to welcome him and escort him across the Yangtze to reside on Mount Juqu. Thereupon, the August Emperor of Heaven dispatched an edict conferring upon him golden and purple jade tablets, appointing him Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and True Person of the Great Prime, Controller of Destiny and Divine Lord. He was granted a staff adorned with purple feathers, ten spirit banners of absolute efficacy, a lotus-flower cap, a purple robe embroidered with feathers, a carriage of cinnabar and azure drawn by striped dragons, a canopy of jade and curtains of brocade, a green jade tablet of authority, a pair of flowing-fire pearls, a banner of moon-bright brocade, a black staff with white feathers, a golden bell and jade dish, the rich essence of purple jasper, the golden elixir and jade nectar, and two administrations on Red City Mountain and the Jade Cavern Palace. Above, he was enrolled in the Upper Clarity; below, he presided over the Great Ultimate. He was enfeoffed to govern the vast heavens and the lands of Wu and Yue, to oversee the Registers of Life and Death on Mount Tai, to record the attendance of the host of perfected beings, to determine the golden roster of destiny, to preside over the transmission of the Dao to disciples, and to examine and verify the ranks of immortals.

At the time, Lord Mao’s younger brother was appointed to an office with a salary of two thousand bushels. As he prepared to assume his post, many from his hometown came to see him off. Lord Mao was also present and said, "I, too, have an appointment. On such-and-such a day, I shall assume my office." The guests said, "We wish to see Lord Mao off as well." He replied, "There is no need for any expense. I have what is needed for the journey." When the appointed day arrived, a grand banquet was held. The curtains were of green silk, the mats layered in white felt, and rare delicacies and exotic fruits were arrayed in abundance. Musicians performed in harmony, their music audible for miles. Over a thousand attendants accompanied them. The civil officials wore crimson robes with white sashes, while the military officers were clad in martial attire, their armor gleaming. Lord Mao then ascended a carriage adorned with a feather canopy and departed.

In the third year of the Xingning reign of the Jin dynasty, on the fourth day of the seventh month, he first descended to the home of Lord Yang at night. He wore a green brocade skirt, a purple feathered robe, and a hibiscus coronet. Seven attendants entered the household with him: one bearing a purple feathered staff, one holding the ten spirit banners of absolute efficacy, one carrying a green jade document case, one grasping a golden bell, and three bearing white ivory boxes in crimson robes. Thereafter, he descended frequently, and his disciples welcomed and awaited him.

The immortal Li Zun composed his biography, which has become renowned in the world.

The *Pearl Bag of the Three Caverns* states: Wang Bao, styled Zideng, was a seventh-generation descendant of Wang Ling of the Former Han. He consumed the azure essence of earthly grains and traversed precipitous peaks as swiftly as a flying bird, crossing vast waters without bridges or ferries. He also ingested the cinnabar essence of morning clouds and azure radiance, enabling him to see to great distances. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao dispatched the Left Mystery Attendant of the Orthodox Unity, bearing a canopy, to confer upon him a jade tablet with a vermilion inscription and bestow upon him a banner of red silk and white feathers. He was titled True Person of Pure Emptiness.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: Master Red Pine, the Rain Master during the time of the Yellow Emperor, was titled True Person of the Great Ultimate. It also states: Han Weiyuan, the True Person of the Nine Doubts, once studied under Song Dexuan of the Central Marchmount. Dexuan was a man of the time of King Xuan of Zhou. He ingested the *Spiritual Flight of the Six Jia* and attained the Dao, gaining the ability to travel great distances, repeatedly conceal himself, and master the Way of the Dark Mystery. He now resides on Mount Song. After a long time, Weiyuan followed and attained his Way, becoming the True Person of the Nine Doubts.

It further states: Pei Xuanren, a native of Yangxia in You Fufeng, was born in the second year of Emperor Wen of Han. After Pei attained the Dao and was about to enter seclusion, his disciple Deng Yun also attained the Dao. Pei led Deng to Mount Taihua and entered the Western Cavern’s Chamber of Dark Stone. After thirty-two years, five elders suddenly appeared and bestowed upon Pei the divine mushroom’s protection. He was also titled True Person of Pure Emptiness.

It also states: Wang Zhongfu, the True Person of the Central Marchmount, from youth cherished the Dao of immortality. He constantly practiced absorbing the Two Radiances and the method of consuming auroral essence. After over forty years, he perceived no benefit, and his son, who also practiced these arts, ascended as an immortal after eighteen years. Later, the Southern Perfected suddenly descended to Zhongfu’s home and instructed him, saying, "Your brain lacks sufficient essence, and your fluids do not flow. Though you have connected with the true radiance and consumed auroral essence, it has not yet benefited your body."

Wang Zhongfu then turned to medicinal treatment for his ailments while simultaneously cultivating the true Dao. After accumulating years of practice, he finally achieved success. Now, he resides on the Mystic Continent, receiving scriptures, serving as the True Person of the Central Marchmount, and overseeing the Bureau of the Nine Mysteries.

It further states: Fan Bociz, a native of Guiyang, originally followed worldly affairs. Suddenly afflicted by madness, his illness persisted for years. Hearing of Daoist Master Shen’s reputation for effective healing, he left home to seek treatment. After fifty days, his illness was cured. Later, he entered Mount Tianmu, consumed sesame seeds, and meditated with focused intent for seventeen years. He then ingested cinnabar and attained the Dao, becoming the True Person of Primordial Unity.

It further states: Xu Mi, styled Sixuan, also named Mu, was appointed Chief Clerk of the Protectorate by Emperor Jianwen of the Jin. Though outwardly immersed in worldly duties, he inwardly cultivated the study of the true Dao and became an Upper Clarity True Person.

It further states: The Purple Void Primordial Lady oversees the Bureau of Destiny for the Upper Perfected. The Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount, a disciple of the Jade Clarity Void, was named Huacun and served as the teacher of Yang, the Controller of Destiny. She was the daughter of Wei Shu, Duke Wenkang of the Jin and Minister of Education from Rencheng. At twenty-four, she married Liu Youyan of Nanyang. When Youyan served as Magistrate of Ji County in Xiwu, the Lady fasted and meditated on the Dao, secluding herself for a hundred days. On a midnight in the twelfth month, the Azure Lad and four perfected beings, including Lord Wang, descended together and bestowed upon her thirty-one scrolls of the Upper Scriptures. During the chaos in Luoyang, the Lady crossed the Yangzi and settled in Yuzhang. She followed Yu Pu to Ancheng Commandery in Jiangzhou and remained there. At eighty-three, in the ninth year of Emperor Cheng’s Xianhe reign, the Azure Lad and Pure Void descended again, transmitting the method of sword liberation. Claiming illness, she concealed her transformation, riding a cloud chariot to Mount Yangluo. The following day, forty-seven perfected beings descended to instruct her in the Daoist methods.

After sixteen years, the Queen Mother of the West descended with the Southern Pole of the Golden Towers to welcome the Lady. Together they journeyed north to the Jade Towers beneath the Supreme Clarity Palace, where she received the divine phoenixes and dragon pennants, a tiger-skin sash, a cinnabar flying skirt, ten tasseled banners of radiant splendor, flowing-gold fire-bells, nine-tiered mushroom canopies, nine-colored tablets, twin pearls of lunar brilliance, the talismans of the divine tiger, and embroidered tiger banners. These were bestowed upon the Jade Maidens of Western Florescence, along with an eight-scene flying chariot and a dark nine-dragon carriage. She was further granted the jade-edged golden script of the Great Lord Emperor of Fusang, and enfeoffed as the Purple Void Primordial Lady, overseeing the life-mandates of the Supreme Perfected, governing all who study the Dao, the registers of life and death, and the supervision of the Three Bureaus, adjudicating transgressions and examining sins.

She also received the azure jade tablets and cinnabar registers from the Sacred Lord of the Golden Towers, and was titled Lady of the Southern Crucible, granted a curved morning flying canopy. She was charged with governing the Great Huo Mountain’s Terrace of the Heavenly Terrace Range. Below, she instructed and taught those destined to become perfected immortals. Each month, she ascended twice to Jade Clarity, thrice to the Great Simplicity, and four times paid homage to the Jade Dawn. She roamed and feasted in Fusang, summoned the celestial perfected, compiled the divine registers, inscribed texts across the nine heavens, assisted in the mandate of the Eastern Florescence, aided the Imperial Dawn, soared through the great auroras, and guided the reins of the nine voids. In the Xingning era, she descended to Lord Yang. She was also bestowed the *Upper Scriptures of Xu Yuan*.

From then on, she descended frequently. The Jade Clarity Void commanded her disciple Fan Miao to compose an *Inner Biography* to reveal her to the world.

It is further said: The Perfected Consort of Ninefold Splendor of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace, in the third year of the Xingning era of the Jin, appeared at the age of thirteen or fourteen. She wore a cloud-brocade skirt, cinnabar above and azure below, with an embroidered silk sash at her waist. Over ten small bells, green in hue with alternating yellow, hung from her right sash. On her left, she bore a jade pendant, her fingers adorned with golden rings, her arms bound with white pearls. Her hair was coiled atop her head, the rest cascading to her waist. One attendant, clad in vermilion with azure insignia, carried a satchel over a foot long to hold books—some ten scrolls, their white jade clasps inscribed with the characters *Jade Clarity Divine Void Inner Perfected Purple Primordial Cinnabar Scripture*. Another attendant, dressed in red, bore a white jade casket bound with crimson cords, both aged seventeen or eighteen. From then on, she descended frequently, bestowing scriptures and composing poems.

The *Biographies of the Perfected* states: Ma Mingsheng was a native of Linzi in the state of Qi. His original surname was Bo, given name He, and courtesy name Junxian. While serving as a county clerk, he was wounded by bandits but encountered the Supreme Perfected Primordial Lady, who gave him medicine that instantly healed him. He followed her to a stone chamber on Mount Tai, where golden couches and jade tables stood amidst treasures and marvels beyond mortal reach.

Her devotion was indeed most earnest, and so the Supreme Perfected Primordial Lady bestowed upon him the method of long life, saying: "What I have received and practiced is the *Great Harmony Natural Dragon Embryo* body, which is fitting only to transmit to the Perfected of the Three Heavens—it cannot be taught to beginners." Later, he followed Master Anqi, ingesting elixirs to ascend as an immortal and become a Perfected.

Master Pei the Perfected had thirty-four disciples: eighteen studied the true Dao, while the rest pursued the path of immortality.

**Section Three of the Daoist Canon Concludes**
**Section Four of the Daoist Canon: Heavenly Immortals**

The *Heavenly Immortals Rank* states: Those who soar through the clouds, their spirits transformed and bodies light, are called Heavenly Immortals, also known as Flying Immortals.

The *Scripture of Precepts for the Multitudes of Divine Immortals* states: In the great mountains facing the east of Kuaiji, there are palaces of Heavenly Immortals, their halls and eaves wrought of gold and jade.

The *Golden Root Scripture* states: Above the Heavenly Gates stand layered jade terraces, the place where all immortals come and go.

The *Jade Clarity Inscribed Stone Hidden Inscription* states: Those who wear the *Hidden Script of the Jade Emperor* shall become Supreme Immortals.

The *Scripture of Precept Texts* states: In the northwest of Heaven lies the Hall of Immortals, where ranks and offices are assigned, and names are recorded in the Nine Palaces and Five Dipper Immortal Bureaus. The Central Heaven has east, west, south, north, and center—each with stone cities aligned to their directions, where all offices and departments are arrayed within the Dipper.

The *Later Sage’s Arrayed Records* states: Those whose names are inscribed in the *Mysterious Jade Register* within the Dipper are all Supreme Immortals.

The *Concealed Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: The Three Clarities and Nine Palaces each have their retinues, with the left generally superior to the right. Their highest ranks are collectively called *Dao Lords*; next are *Perfected Ones*, *Perfected Lords*, and *Perfected Ministers*. Among them are titles such as *Imperial Censor* and *Jade Gentleman*, with many official positions. Female Perfected are called *Primordial Ladies* or *Ladies*, their ranks comparable to *Immortal Lords*. Both male and female immortals take their governing domains as titles, all with left and right designations. Those titled *Supreme* are revered within their respective palaces. There are also the *Right Immortal Lord of Great Clarity*, the *Left Immortal Lord of Penglai*, the *Immortal Marquis of Great Ultimate*, the *Immortal Overseer*, *Immortal Gentleman*, and *Immortal Guest*.

The *Register of August People* states: From the Three Symbols’ radiant illumination to the accumulation of countless kalpas, the formation and dissolution of Heaven and Earth are beyond full recounting. The era of Tang Yao marks the end of a minor kalpa. After the *dinghai* year, in the *jiashen* year, the *yang* and *nine-six* qi converge and separate. At the beginning of *renchen*, the cycle completes nine revolutions. By the *gengzi* year, a red star appears in the east, and a white comet emerges from the Moon’s Grotto.

After Tang Yao, forty-six *dinghai* years mark a minor kalpa; after fifty-five *dinghai* years of the Zhou, reaching *renchen* and *guisi*, it becomes a great kalpa. When the Six Harmonies merge into oneness and the Two Ways wax and wane, the cyclical kalpa turns, and an immortal’s rank begins its first rotation.

The *Golden Root Lower Scripture* states: There are records of immortal ranks—advancement, demotion, promotion, and degradation—along with the rites of the *Jade Dawn* attendant immortals.

The *Register of Assembled Immortals* states: During the Later Han, Princess Nanyang descended to marry the Commandant-Esquire Wang Xian. The princess had long revered the supreme Dao. As the Han dynasty fell into chaos, she told Xian: "You must preserve yourself—only thus can you prolong life. If you idly follow the times, advancing and retreating with the world, I fear you will not escape the suffering of separation or the peril of pursuit." Xian, however, fixated on worldly gains, did not heed her words. The princess then entered Mount Huayin and departed forever. Xian followed her into the mountains but found no trace. Suddenly, on a ridge, he saw a pair of vermilion slippers. When he took them, they turned to stone, and the mountain was named Princess Peak.

It also states: Zhang Zhengli, at the end of the Han, studied the Dao on Mount Heng. He ingested yellow essence and received the *Rainbow Radiance Elixir* from the Lord of Western City. Troubled by the difficulty of obtaining the medicine, he traveled to Guangzhou as a Daoist, where he obtained both inner and outer *penetrating cinnabar* and cultivated the method of *guarding the One*. He ascended as an immortal.

The *Perfected Petition* states: Zhang Zhen of Nanjun, a scholar of the classics from youth, lived during the reign of King You of Zhou. He often sighed: "In this fleeting human life, each day brings us farther from our origin." He composed over a hundred scrolls of Daoist texts, mastering the Five Phases and expounding their subtleties, with nurturing life and curing illness as his guiding principles.

Later, he entered Kongtong Mountain and ascended as an immortal.

It is also said: Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was a native of Donghai. He was recommended as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate and appointed Gentleman of the Palace, eventually rising to the rank of Grand Master for Palace Attendants. A man of vast learning, he was especially versed in the essentials of celestial patterns, apocryphal texts, and the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*, enabling him to foresee the rise and fall of the realm. When Emperor Huan of Han ascended the throne, he repeatedly summoned Wang, who refused to appear. The court then compelled local authorities to transport him to the capital by force, yet he remained silent, head bowed, uttering not a word. The emperor had him inscribe over four hundred characters on the palace gates, all foretelling future events. Displeased, the emperor sent him back to his hometown. There, Chen Dan, a former Grand Commandant of the same commandery, built a chamber for Fangping’s Daoist practice and served him day and night. Fangping remained in Chen’s household for over forty years. Later, he told Chen, "I shall depart." The next day at noon, he passed away. The following day, he was indeed dead. Realizing Fangping had ascended as an immortal, Chen lamented, "Master, you have left me."

It is also said: Yan Qing, a native of Kuaiji, was poor and often made charcoal in the mountains. One day, a man spoke with him, though Yan did not recognize him as an extraordinary person. Before parting, the stranger gave Yan a scroll, saying, "You are destined for longevity, so I entrust this to you. Keep it in a clean vessel and place it in a high location." Yan accepted it. Later, he mastered its arts and ascended as an immortal on Mount Huo.

It is also said: Zhang Ling, styled Fuhan, was a native of Feng in Peiguo. Originally a great Confucian scholar, he later studied the Dao of longevity and obtained the *Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons*. Hearing that Shu was rich in famous mountains, he entered Wuhu Mountain and composed over twenty scrolls of Daoist texts before ascending as an immortal.

It is also said: Zhao Guangxin, a native of Yangcheng, crossed the Yangtze during the late Wei period and entered Xiaobai Mountain in Shan. There, he studied the Dao and received the *Mysterious Center* teachings from Zuo Ci, along with the method of *penetrating vision*. After years of practice, he traveled through commanderies and states, sometimes selling medicine, though none recognized him. He often came to the capital to purchase cinnabar and refine the *Nine Radiance Elixir* before ascending as an immortal.

It is also said: Guo Jingshi, in the early Jin, studied the Dao in Jishan of Lujiang. He received oral instructions from Meng Deran and ingested black sesame and the *Mysterious Elixir* before ascending as an immortal.

It is also said: Zhao Bowei, a native of Dongjun, studied in his youth under Master Zhang of Handan and Ying. Later, on Mount Song, he received the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*. After completing his cultivation, he ascended as an immortal and was placed in charge of the immortal registers, recording those who attained the Dao.

It is also said: Li Fanghui, a man of the Jin Emperor Wu’s reign, studied the Dao on Mount Hua. He received from Guan Chengzi the method of *steaming cinnabar and ingesting wood*, and later from Zhou Shouling of Sumen the *Cinnabar Radiance* technique. For fifty years, he cultivated purity of heart and inner vision before ascending as an immortal.

It is also said: Li Xiu composed forty scrolls titled *The Source of the Dao*. In his work, he wrote: "The weak can restrain the strong; yin can obscure yang. Always act as if treading over abysses or walking on rotten ice—such is the Dao of longevity." He lived to four hundred years with an unaging countenance before ascending as an immortal.

Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: Ma Shihuang was the horse master of the Yellow Emperor. Later, when horses fell ill, dragons emerged from the water to heal them. One day, he ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Wang Ziqiao, the Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou, was fond of playing the *sheng* pipe to mimic the cry of the phoenix. Master Fuqiu took him to Mount Song, where after thirty years he ascended as an immortal.

Ge Hong’s *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Su Xiangong, named Lin and styled Zixuan, lived during the reign of King Wu of Zhou. His family resided by the Qu River in Puyang. Orphaned young, Lin was known for his benevolence and filial piety. Though poor and often tending cattle himself, upon attaining the Dao, whenever his mother craved fresh food, he would place a spoon in a vessel, take money, and depart—only for the food to appear. His mother said, "The nearest fish market is in Bian County, over a hundred *li* away. Are you deceiving me?" Xiangong knelt and replied, "I do not lie." The next day, her brother arrived and recounted seeing Xiangong at the Bian County market. Only then did she marvel at his divine powers. Later, he ascended as an immortal. A white crane alighted on the northeastern tower of the commandery city, scratching the floorboards with its talons as if writing in lacquer: "The city walls remain, but the people are not the same." To this day, the former residence of Xiangong still stands, much like that of Ding Lingwei.

It is further said: Shen Wentai, a native of Jiuyi, obtained the method of the *Crimson Spring Divine Elixir*, the *Earth Talisman* technique for reversing aging, and the *Way of Restoring Youth*. His ingestion of the elixir proved highly effective. Wishing to journey to Kunlun, he lingered for many years before transmitting the teachings to Li Wenyuan, saying, "Without removing the *Earth Talisman*, consuming elixirs and practicing the Dao will be of no benefit." Wenyuan thus received his esoteric instructions and later ascended as an immortal. Wentai also taught the method of boiling cinnabar in bamboo-root juice and the *Yellow Spirit* technique for expelling the *Three Corpses*.

It is further said: Shen Xi, a native of Wu Commandery, studied the Dao in Shu and could heal the sick, earning great gratitude and virtue. Later, he encountered a feather-robed emissary bearing a jade tablet inscribed with a blue-jade script, which he presented to Xi. Unable to decipher it, Xi looked away for a moment—only for a great fog to arise. When it cleared, the emissary had vanished. Xi returned home and later ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Chen Anshi, a native of Jingzhao, worked as a hired laborer for Guan Shuben. Naturally kind and benevolent, he served Shuben, who was fond of the Dao. Two Daoists, posing as scholars, accompanied Shuben to observe and test him. Unaware of their true nature, Shuben grew increasingly negligent toward them. The scholars then asked Anshi, "Do you desire the Dao?" He replied, "I have no means to know of it." They said, "If you truly desire the Dao, meet us tomorrow at dawn beneath the great tree north of the road." Anshi agreed and arrived early, but saw no one. "Have the scholars deceived me?" he wondered. After three appointments, he arrived early once more, and they bestowed upon him an elixir. Later, he ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Wu Mu, a native of Chang’an, served as a minor county clerk in his youth, overseeing cases and extorting the people. When the people sued him, he fled into the mountains and forests. Starving for days, he came upon a stone chamber where he met Master Sun, who instructed him to cultivate millet and sesame, sweep, and perform menial tasks. After four years, the master transmitted the Dao to him. Later, he ingested an elixir and ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Dong Weinian, of unknown origin, dwelled in the White Community of Luoyang during the late reign of Emperor Wu of Jin. He slept on bare earth, his clothes tattered, and often swallowed a stone, going days without food. Sometimes he begged for work in the marketplace, and though people observed him, he never spoke. Occasionally, he composed poems, but none knew his ultimate fate.

It is further said: Xiao Shi, a man of the time of Duke Mu of Qin, was skilled in playing the xiao flute and could summon peacocks and white magpies. The duke’s daughter, named Nongyu, favored him, and he was given her in marriage. Thereupon, he taught Nongyu to mimic the cry of the phoenix. After more than ten years, phoenixes came and alighted, and the duke built the Phoenix Terrace where the couple resided. After several years, they ascended as immortals. Thus, the people of Qin built the Phoenix Maiden Shrine in the Yong Palace, and the sound of the xiao flute has endured through the ages.

It is further said: The Master of the Riverbank—his name and origins unknown—during the reign of Emperor Jing of Han, built a thatched hut by the river. The emperor, reading the *Laozi*, admired its words but found some passages unclear. Hearing of the master, he sent to inquire. The master presented two scrolls of plain silk to the emperor, saying: "Read these to resolve your doubts, but do not show them to the unworthy." Later, the master ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Huang Ziyang, from his youth, knew the Dao of longevity. He secluded himself in Mount Boluo for over ninety years, eating only peaches and drinking from stone springs. Later, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who transmitted to him the *Eightfold Guidance to Immortality*. Thereupon, he transcended the world and ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Master Wang, a native of Yangcheng, dwelled in Hugu Valley, unaware of the passage of time. When Emperor Wu of Han ascended Mount Song, Dongfang Shuo and others accompanied him. Suddenly, they saw a divine being over ten feet tall. The emperor bowed in reverence and asked him who he was. The being replied: "I am a man of Mount Jiuyi. Hearing that the Central Marchmount bears stone calamus, an inch long with nine joints, which grants longevity when eaten, I have come to gather it." Suddenly, the divine being vanished. The emperor then gathered and ingested it.

The emperor, troubled by internal heat and vexation, had his attendants all ingest it, and they too gained prolonged vitality. Only Master Wang, having heard the divine being’s instruction to consume it, gathered and ate it, then ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Liu Gen, styled Jun’an, was a native of Chang’an in Jingzhao. Well-versed in the Five Classics from youth, he lived during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han. He entered the precipitous stone chambers of Mount Song and once declared: "The supreme medicines include the nine-times-cycled Returning Elixir and the Golden Liquid of the Great One; next are substances like mica and realgar, which also confer longevity. Below these are the herbal medicines, which cure illness and replenish qi. At best, they may extend life by several centuries; at least, they preserve one’s innate endowment. If one truly seeks immortality, one must first stabilize the mind and will, eliminate desires, and only then may receive the divine formula of the *Five-Colored Root Scrolls*." Later, he entered Cock’s Head Mountain and ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Yin Changsheng, a native of Xinye, was a kinsman of Empress Yin of the Later Han. Though born into wealth and nobility, he disdained worldly glory. Learning that Ma Mingsheng had attained the arts of transcending the world, he sought him out. Upon meeting, he served him with the reverence of a charioteer. For over a decade, he never wavered. Mingsheng said: "You have truly attained the Dao." He then entered Mount Qingcheng and transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Great Clarity Divine Elixir*. After taking leave, Yin later ascended as an immortal on Mount Pingdu.

The *Fengsu Tong* states: During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, the Palace Secretary Wang Qiao served as Magistrate of Ye. Each month on the first day, he would appear at court. The emperor, knowing he arrived without carriage or escort, secretly ordered the court astronomers to observe him.

When Wang Qiao was about to depart this world, a pair of cranes would always arrive from the southeast. The court astronomers, seeing them as wild ducks, cast their nets and caught a single shoe. Upon presenting it to the Imperial Workshop for identification, it was recognized as the official footwear issued to the Palace Secretary four years prior. Each time Wang attended court, the drum at the gate of Ye would sound without being struck, its resonance heard throughout the capital. Later, a jade coffin descended from the heavens before the hall. Wang declared, "The Heavenly Emperor summons me." He bathed, lay within the coffin, and the lid sealed itself. He was buried east of the city, where the earth formed his tomb. The people established a shrine in his honor, known as the Shrine of Lord Ye.

The *Three Caverns Pearl Bag* states: Hu Gong Xie Yuan, a native of Liyang, sold medicines in the market at a fixed price, curing all who sought his remedies. He would tell his patients, "After taking this medicine, you will vomit such-and-such a thing, and you will recover on such-and-such a day." His words never failed. Daily, he amassed tens of thousands of coins, which he distributed to the poor and destitute in the marketplace. Fei Changfang, the magistrate of the market, recognized his extraordinary nature. Later, Changfang visited Hu Gong, who took him away and transmitted the arts of healing before sending him back. Lord Shi Ya later ascended as an immortal. Dai Gongbai possessed over ten scrolls of the *Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*, which had been passed down from Hu Gong’s master.

It is further said: Yue Zichang, a native of Qi, was devoted to the Dao from youth. He traveled to Mount Huolin, where he ingested the *Red Pine Powder of Giant Sesame* and eventually departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Wei Shuqing, a native of Zhongshan, consumed mica. His son, Du Shi, entered the mountains and encountered his father. Shuqing instructed him, "In the northwest corner of my study, beneath the great pillar, lies a jade casket containing a scripture. Retrieve it and follow its instructions." Du Shi returned home and found it exactly as described. After ingesting the five-colored mica, he ascended as an immortal.

It is further said: Wei Boyang, a native of Wu, was devoted to the Dao and refused official service, sealing himself away to cultivate his lofty aspirations. Later, he entered the mountains, ingested the divine elixir, and departed as an immortal. He composed the *Triplex Unity*, which expounds the principles of elixir-making through the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*. Yet the world, unaware of the divine elixir’s true nature, often interprets it through yin-yang theories, entirely missing its essence.

It is further said: Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan. Well-versed in all manner of texts, he turned to the Dao in his later years and regularly consumed Solomon’s seal. Though he lived over a hundred years, his predictions of the world’s rise and fall, safety and peril, fortune and misfortune never failed to prove accurate. He later entered Mount Taihe and departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Dongguo Yannian, a native of Shanyang, ingested the *Flying Spirit Powder* and could write in the dark of night. His body emitted a radiance that illuminated small objects, revealing their colors. One day, dozens of men riding tigers and leopards arrived to welcome him. Yannian then journeyed to Mount Kunlun and departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Wang Zhen, a native of Shangdang, began his Daoist studies at seventy-nine. He walked with such ease that he seemed to fly, possessing the strength of many men. You Yuanjie served Zhen for over a decade. Zhen transmitted to him the method of steaming and ingesting the minor elixir, and Yuanjie’s appearance never aged. The villagers estimated Zhen’s age to be over four hundred years. Later, he ascended Mount Nüji and departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Ping Zhongjie, a native of Hedong, withdrew to Mount Cangwu during the Jin dynasty when the Jie Hu disrupted China. There, he received the *Preserving the Mind* teachings from Master Song. After forty-five years of unwavering devotion, his body became suffused with true qi, and he later departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Ge Xuan was skilled in transformation but careless in his personal conduct. Initially residing on Mount Chang, he later moved near Mount Gaizhu. Though capable of riding tigers and commanding spirits, he had yet to receive an immortal office. He often kept company with Xie Zhijian, Huang Ziyang, and Guo Shengzi. Ge Xuan was the great-uncle of the *Master Embracing Simplicity* and the disciple of Zheng Siyuan. His whereabouts were unknown to his contemporaries, though it was said that immortals in the Eastern Sea sent him letters, addressing him as "Immortal Lord."

It is further said: Lu Miaodian, a female Daoist from Mount Jiuyi, was devoted to the Dao from birth. One day, she suddenly told her mother, "Among those who attain the upper limits of human longevity, few truly succeed. Joy and sorrow, grief and delight—these daily harms are nothing compared to burying one’s true nature and drowning in the mundane stream." A Daoist passing by her home transmitted to her the *Yellow Court Scripture of the Great Cavern* and said, "The trouble is that people cannot know, and even if they know, they cannot cultivate; even if they cultivate, they cannot refine; even if they refine, they cannot persist. Not only will they incur the penalties of the celestial statutes, but they will also suffer endless retribution." Miaodian heeded his words and entered Mount Jiuyi, where she endured countless demonic trials without wavering. On the mountain, a stone basin held an inexhaustible spring, and a great iron mortar appeared, its origin unknown. Both remain on the mountain’s stone altar, alongside the unmistakable imprints of an immortal’s shoes and an ancient mirror, three feet wide. A crescent-shaped ancient bell is housed in the Wuwei Abbey. Miaodian later departed as an immortal.

It is further said: Xie Ziran, a female Daoist from Guozhou, possessed an extraordinary demeanor. Her family lived at the foot of Mount Dafang, whose summit bore an ancient statue of Lord Lao. Ziran prostrated herself before it and refused to descend the mountain. Her mother followed her, and they moved to the mountaintop. Thereafter, Ziran constantly recited the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Inner Chapters of the Yellow Court*. At the Kaiyuan Abbey, she received the *Purple Void Treasure Tallies* and resided on Mount Jinquan. The mountain featured a stone altar surrounded by misty bamboo groves. For thirteen years, she remained awake day and night, until two seals appeared on her knees, slightly smaller than an official’s seal, their four edges crimson and inscribed with six ancient characters resembling white jade. Suddenly, clouds enveloped the Jinquan sanctuary, lingering over the valley for a long while. She then departed as an immortal.

The *Inscription on the Jinquan Stele* states: In the heavens stands the White Jade Hall, its walls inscribed with the names of lofty immortals and perfected beings, much like the records on mortal walls. At times, vermilion script appears beneath their names, noting: "Descended to the world to serve as such-and-such an official or post." Ziran also inscribed several characters on the eastern wall of her dwelling, all conveying the essence of the Dao. The original calligraphy remains.

It further states: Wang Fengxian was a girl from a common family in Dangtu County, Xuanzhou. Having attained the Dao, she often expounded to others on the principles of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and uprightness, as well as the teachings of purity, detachment, frugality, and restraint—essential instructions for cultivating the self and practicing hidden virtue. Thus, people near and far revered her, offering gold and jade in abundance, though she turned away without a glance. Later, she entered Dongting Mountain and departed as an immortal without illness. Auspicious signs of clouds, cranes, and rare fragrances accompanied her ascension.

**End of Scroll Four of the Daoist Canon**
**Scroll Five: Earthbound Immortals**

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou lie within the Bohai Sea to the east, not far from humanity. Many have reached them, for they are home to various immortals and wondrous medicines. Their creatures and beasts are all white; from afar, the islands appear like clouds.

The *Esoteric Essentials Scripture* states: By accomplishing three hundred virtuous deeds, one may attain the state of an earthbound immortal, dwelling within the grotto-palaces of the Five Sacred Mountains.

The *Baopuzi* states: Peng Zu remarked that in the heavens, many exalted officials and newly ascended immortals hold lowly ranks, serving numerous superiors—only to find their labors ever more arduous. Thus, they do not urgently seek celestial ascent but remain among mortals for eight hundred years.

The *Accounts of Anomalies* states: Atop Mount Lu stand three stone beams, each dozens of yards long yet scarcely a foot wide. Gazing down, one sees only an abyssal void. During the Xiankang era of the Jin, Jiangzhou Governor Yu Liang invited Wu Meng and his disciples to ascend the mountain for sightseeing. Passing over one of the beams, they saw an old man seated beneath an osmanthus tree, holding a jade bowl to catch sweet dew, which he shared with Meng, who in turn distributed it among his disciples. Proceeding further, they came upon towering terraces and vast halls, their chambers adorned with gold and jade, their utensils beyond recognition. Speaking with Meng, the old man seemed as familiar as if they had long shared jade paste for days on end.

The *Annals of Master Pei* states: The Western Mystery’s Three Caverns span a thousand *li*, and on the Western Mountains stand two palaces—one for citrons, one for pomelos—encircled by ninefold golden walls. Hidden passageways tunnel through the caverns, linking to the Mystic Continent and Kunlun, realms beyond mortal reach. Master Pei and Master Zhou each dwell within.

The *Illustrated Register of the Five Peaks* records: The cavern of Mount Qingcheng spans two thousand *li*, lying within Shu Commandery, where the Yellow Emperor paid homage to the Five Peaks’ Venerable Lord. The *Records of Famous Mountains* further notes: To the north it adjoins Mount Bozhong, to the south Mount Emei, and to the east it extends to Chengdu, its ridges resembling a walled city. The mountain bears a crimson cliff, where Celestial Master Zhang once resided; his traces remain to this day.

The *Biography of Lady Wei* recounts: The cavern of Red City’s Cinnabar Mountain spans three hundred *li*, where the roots of the sun and moon’s staffs reside, their three luminaries’ radiance illuminating the depths. The *Illustrated Register of the Five Peaks* states: This mountain lies in Luojiang of Kuaiji, its northwest holding Red City. According to the *Annals of Master Mao*, the Director of Destinies of Huolin governs the Jade Cavern Palace of Red City’s Cinnabar Mountain. During the Yongming era of the Qi, a vast flock of pigeons suddenly arrived from the northwest, descending upon Huomen Stream. The valley filled for miles, trampled underfoot as if startled by some unseen force. By nightfall, they flew back toward the northwest—likely creatures from the Celestial Springs Lake of Red City’s Upper Capital.

Mount Luofu’s cavern spans five hundred *li*; the *True Records* calls it the Tiered City. Ge Hong sojourned here in distant Jiaozhou before attaining transformation. The *Annals of Master Mao* states: The cavern of Mount Gouqu spans one hundred fifty *li*. In Qin times, it was known as the Altar of Goujin. During the Han, the Three Mao Lords attained the Dao and came to govern this mountain.

The *Five Talismans* records: Mount Linwu spans four hundred *li*, also named Baoshan, situated within Lake Tai. Beneath it lies a cavern secretly connecting the Five Peaks, called the Heavenly Queen’s Separate Palace. After Yu the Great tamed the floods, he concealed the Five Talismans here. King Helü of Wu once dispatched the Dragon Might Elder into the mountain to retrieve them.

The *True Records* states: Beneath Baoshan lie stone chambers and silver halls, a hundred *li* in circumference. There are also hidden springs of white mushrooms, their waters purple-hued. It further notes: The cavern of Chengyu Mountain spans three thousand *li*. The Director of Destinies of Zhou once resided in Mount Heng before the Jade Maiden of the Supreme Mystery instructed him to journey to the Western City’s Master Wang. He went, and this was the mountain. It also says: Within the depths of the Profound Sustainer, there are thirty-six grotto-heavens. Beyond the Eight Seas, other mountains likewise hold cavern-palaces—some a thousand *li* or five hundred *li* in scale, not counted among the thirty-six grotto-heavens. The Five Peaks and famous mountains all possess cavern-palaces, some thirty or twenty *li* in extent, serving as abodes for immortals and transcending the tally of lesser heavens.

The *Records of Famous Mountains* states: The cavern of the Peak Grotto spans a hundred *li*, nestled in the tranquility of Zhongnan’s Great Unity. Some call it the Cassia Sun Palace, rich in numinous wonders. Mount Wangwu’s cavern winds ten thousand *li*, named the Lesser Heaven of Pure Emptiness. According to the *Inner Annals of Master Wang*, it lies within Qinshui County of Henan, the source of the Ji River. To the north stands Mount Taihang, to the southeast Mount Song, and within its cavern-heaven’s mouth, the sun, moon, stars, clouds, flora, and myriad beings differ not from the mortal world. Palaces and towers gleam in reflection, adorned with gold and jade carvings—all dwellings of earthbound immortals, the abode of Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness.

The *True Records* states: These are the so-called Sunlight Terraces of the various heavens, where all who attain the Dao gather. Mount Weiyu rises from the sea, the dwelling of Sima Jizhu. It further notes: The cavern of Mount Kuocang spans three hundred *li*, an auxiliary to the Eastern Peak’s mandate. Located southeast of Kuaiji, it is a haunt of the host of emperors. The mountain teems with divine marvels, and its Hall of Crimson Clouds stands as a solitary peak, its cliffs and ridges towering above all others. Atop the solitary height of Maoxuan Ridge, the Director of Destinies buried six thousand *jin* of cinnabar, two *zhang* deep, sealed with a slab of stone. The springs on either side of the mountain run faintly crimson; those who drink from them attain longevity. The Heavenly Emperor’s Altar of Mount Mao stands precisely at the cavern-heaven’s center, above the Mystic Window. Long ago, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea rode his wind-borne flying wheel chariot to inspect the grotto-heaven and once came here.

Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: Red Pine, the rain master of Shen Nong’s time, ingested water jade. Ascending Mount Kunlun, he often lingered in the Western Queen Mother’s stone chamber, rising and falling with the winds and rains before ascending as an immortal. It further records: Yu Quan of Mount Huai was the Herb-Gathering Elder, fond of eating pine nuts. His body grew fur, his eyes square pupils, and he could fly. It also notes: Master Guangcheng was an ancient immortal dwelling in a stone chamber on Mount Kongtong. When the Yellow Emperor heard of him and sought him out to inquire into the essentials of the Dao, Master Guangcheng said: “You govern the world, yet clouds fly without waiting to gather, and plants wither without waiting to yellow. How can you speak of the supreme Dao?” The Yellow Emperor withdrew and fasted for three days before bowing in obeisance to the wind. Master Guangcheng then said: “The essence of the supreme Dao is dim and obscure; see nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will right itself—you must be serene, must be pure. I shall depart through the Gate of the Boundless and wander the Wilds of the Infinite.”

It further states: The Master of White Stone was a disciple of the Central Yellow Daoist. He often boiled white stones for sustenance, hence dwelling on White Stone Mountain. He also ate dried meats, drank wine, and consumed grains. He could walk three to four hundred *li* a day without his appearance aging. It also records: The Lord of Yellow Mountain cultivated the arts of Peng Zu and, at over a hundred years old, retained a youthful countenance. After Peng Zu departed, he compiled his teachings into a scripture. It further notes: The *Scripture of the Six Jia of Supreme Purity* states: Song Xuande was a man of King Xuan of Zhou’s time. He ingested the Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talismans, attained the Dao of true numina, and dwelled on Mount Song. It also says: Li Yiqí was a man of Shu. He was often seen in the world.

Yan Dao practiced his arts among the people, dwelling in a cave at the corner of the city walls of Shu. When Liu Bei sought to march east to avenge Guan Yu’s grievance against Wu, he summoned Yiqi and held him in great esteem. Asked about the campaign against Wu, Yiqi did not speak but instead requested paper, upon which he drew tens of thousands of soldiers, horses, and weapons, then tore them all to pieces. He also drew an official, dug a pit, and buried it, then departed without another word. Liu Bei was displeased. Later, as foretold, his forces were crushed by Wu, suffering a catastrophic defeat—of over a hundred thousand men, only a few hundred returned, their armor, weapons, and supplies nearly all lost. Liu Bei fell ill with rage and grief, dying at the Palace of Eternal Peace. Yiqi spoke little; when questioned, he gave no answer. If people of Shu came to him with worries, he would say: "Fortune and misfortune follow their own signs—simply observe whether their countenance is gloomy or joyful." Later, he entered Mount Langye and was never seen again.

It further states: Feng Junda, a man of Longxi, consumed yellow essence for over fifty years. He entered Wushu Mountain, where he refined his practice for over a century, occasionally returning to his hometown. He often rode a black ox, dispensing medicine to cure the sick, and was known only as the Black Ox Daoist. When locals asked how long he had lived, he would not answer. Later, he entered Tiger Hill Mountain and ascended as an immortal.

It also says: Wang Zhongdu was a man of the Western Han. From his youth, he cultivated the Dao and practiced filial piety under Emperor Wen. On a bitterly cold day, he ordered Zhongdu to ride alone in a chariot drawn by four horses through the Shanglin and Kunming parks, circling the lakes at full speed. The charioteer, clad in fox fur, shivered violently, nearly freezing to death, while Zhongdu’s complexion remained unchanged, his body warm and his qi radiant as flame. In the height of summer, when surrounded by raging fire, his body did not sweat. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

It further records: There was a man called Jiqiugong, a Daoist of Mount Tai. When Emperor Wu of Han made his eastern inspection and reached Mount Tai, Jiqiugong came to greet him, wearing a *zhangfu* cap and yellow robes, holding a zither. He said: "Your Majesty, do not ascend the mountain, lest you harm your feet." The emperor insisted, but after climbing a few *li*, his feet indeed grew sore, just as predicted—though he concealed it. Thus, he merely performed the sacrifices and returned, ordering a shrine built for Jiqiugong and assigning a hundred households to serve it.

It also says: Dai Meng, originally surnamed Yan, named Ji, styled Zhongwei, lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. He entered Mount Hua and Mount Wudang, where he received the *Jade Pendant Scripture of the Golden Seal* and the *Stone Essence Golden Light Talisman* from Master Pei. He also obtained the *Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*, enabling him to traverse the famous mountains.

It further states: Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was a man of Lujiang. Well-versed in the Five Classics and astronomy, he saw the Han dynasty’s decline and devoted himself to Daoist cultivation on Mount Tianzhu, where he obtained the *Nine Elixirs Golden Liquid Scripture* from a stone chamber—a method of the Grand Purity. His teacher was Li Zhongfu. Later, Ge Xuan became his disciple. When Cao Cao heard of him, he summoned Ci and asked about his Daoist studies. Ci did not answer, enraging Cao, who sought to kill him. A feast was prepared, but Ci suddenly vanished. At the end of the Jian’an era, he crossed the Yangtze, seeking mountains and entering grottoes. He dwelled on Mount Xiaokuo, his complexion radiant.

It also says: Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a man of Poyang. He often healed the sick, and all recovered. Yao possessed a small box, several inches long, and one of his disciples, surnamed Qian, followed him for over a decade without ever seeing it opened. One evening, as rain fell and darkness deepened, Yao instructed Qian to carry the box on a nine-jointed staff, and they set out on a path they had never traveled before. After journeying over ten *li*, they ascended a small hill and entered a stone chamber. Two men were already there. When Yao arrived, they took the box, opened it, and removed three five-tongued bamboo flutes. Each played one for a long while, then returned them to the box. They bade farewell to the men in the chamber, and upon returning home, Yao donned a single-layered *fenge* robe, carried the bamboo box himself, and departed, never to return. Thirty years later, his disciple saw Yao beneath Mount Mati, his appearance even younger—he was evidently an earthbound immortal.

It further states: Chen Zihuang, a man of Jiyin, obtained a recipe for *zhu* (atractylodes) and consumed it, ceasing to eat grain. Initially over seventy and frail, after taking the elixir, he grew youthful again. He lived among the people for many years before entering Mount Huo and departing.

It also says: Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a man of Langye. He disdained honors and titles, living in seclusion. Devoted to the arts of immortals and Daoist techniques, he seldom socialized. On Mount Yuhang, he encountered He Duodao and Guo Wenju, exchanging glances but no words. His great-uncle, Ge Xuan, had achieved immortality in the Wu era and transmitted his alchemical methods to his disciple Zheng Yin, styled Siyuan. Hong studied under Yin and mastered all his teachings.

The *Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Bao Jing, styled Taixuan, was walking toward the capital on the twentieth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Taixing era. As he reached Dragon Mountain, he saw a youth ahead, handsome and dignified, walking swiftly despite traveling on foot. Jing secretly followed for several *li* but could not catch up, finding it most strange. He asked: "Sir, you seem to be one who has attained the Dao." The youth replied: "I am Yin Changsheng of Zhongshan."

It further says: Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a man of Kuaiji. Proficient in the Five Classics and skilled in composition, he later pursued the Dao. Hearing of the *Scripture of the Returned Elixir*, he searched the world for it in vain. His teacher then entered the mountains to meditate deeply and encountered a man who bestowed the *Scripture of the Returned Elixir* upon him, saying: "Attain this, and you will become an immortal—do nothing else." Xiang took his leave and returned. Once, he visited his disciple Luo Yanya’s dwelling. In the main hall, scholars were debating the meaning of the *Zuozhuan*, their arguments unresolved. Xiang overheard and clarified the matter. The scholars, realizing he was no ordinary man, secretly memorialized the Wu ruler to recommend him. Xiang wished to leave, but the Wu ruler summoned him to Wuchang, holding him in great esteem and addressing him as "Master Jie." He was granted a residence, furnishings, and a thousand *jin* of gold. Later, Xiang claimed illness and died in an instant.

The imperial decree ordered his burial and the construction of a temple in his honor. Whenever the Master personally conducted sacrifices, white cranes would alight upon his seat, lingering before departing.

It is further said: Li Gen, styled Zice, was a native of Xuchang. Formerly, he visited the household of Wu Taiwen in Shouchun, where disciples, knowing of his Daoist arts, secretly observed his belongings and found a scroll of the *Plain Book*, in which he had recorded his study of the Dao and the days of his medicinal regimen. Taiwen also recounted that Gen had learned from Tongzifang, though Gen was but an earthbound immortal.

It is further said: Boshanfu was a man of Yongzhou. He entered the Hua Mountains and remained there for two hundred years without visiting human dwellings. He could recount the good and evil deeds, merits and faults of one’s ancestors as if witnessing them firsthand, and he knew the fortunes and misfortunes yet to come.

It is further said: Liu Zheng, a native of Pei, was a man of lofty talent and vast learning, ever seeking out rare and wondrous knowledge. If another surpassed him, even a servant or slave, he would take them as his teacher. He pursued the arts of nourishing life and ingested elixirs, living over four hundred years.

It is further said: Wang Lie, styled Changxiu, was a man of Handan. He regularly consumed yellow essence and lead, living over two hundred years. His steps were as swift as flight, and he had mastered all manner of texts. Ji Kang held him in great esteem and often studied with him. Together, they entered the Taihang Mountains and saw a fissure in the earth from which flowed a green stone marrow. Lie gathered the marrow, shaping it into pellets that resembled grains of rice in texture and taste. He carried some back, intending to gift it to Kang, but upon inspection, it had turned to green stone. When struck, it rang clear. Kang then accompanied him to the site, only to find the mountain restored as before. Lie later entered the Baodu Mountains in Hedong, where he discovered a stone chamber containing a stone shelf. Upon the shelf lay two scrolls of the *Plain Book*, its characters unknown. He memorized several dozen and showed them to Kang, who recognized them all. Delighted, Lie returned with Kang to read the text, but upon arrival, the stone chamber had vanished. Lie whispered to his disciples: "Shuye [Kang] has come to attain the Dao." According to the *Scriptures of Divine Immortals*, every five hundred years, mountains open once, and their stone marrow emerges. Those who obtain and consume it gain long life. Later, none knew where Lie had gone.

It is further said: Bu Zheng, styled Xuanzhen, was a native of Badong.

In his accounts of Qin Shi Huang’s reign, events unfolded as if before one’s very eyes. At the end of the Han, he led dozens of disciples into Wu, teaching them the methods of absorbing qi, refining stone marrow, and the minor elixir arts. He lived to the age of four hundred.

It is further said: Jiao Guang, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Hedong. He regularly consumed white stones, boiled until soft as taro. Often entering the mountains to gather firewood, he would carry bundles to give to others. When Wei received the abdication, he took leave of his acquaintances and departed, his whereabouts unknown.

It is further said: Sun Deng, of uncertain origin, often dwelled at the mountain gate, sitting in an earthen hollow while playing the zither and reciting the *Book of Changes*. In winter, he wore only a single garment, yet when the weather grew bitterly cold, observers saw his hair—over ten feet long—cascading down to cover his body. Though generations passed, his countenance remained unchanged. He possessed no other belongings and did not eat. When Yang Jun served as Grand Tutor, he sent for Sun Deng, who answered none of his questions. Yang Jun then presented him with a cloth robe, but upon leaving, Sun Deng borrowed a knife, cut the robe in two, and placed the separate halves at Yang Jun’s gate, foretelling his impending execution. At the time, Ji Kang of Kuaiji once visited Sun Deng, who refused to speak with him. Ji Kang then posed challenging questions, but Sun Deng continued playing his zither, unperturbed. After a long while, Ji Kang departed. Sun Deng remarked: "Ji Kang’s talent is great, yet his wisdom is shallow—he lacks the means to preserve himself."

It is further said: Bo He, styled Zhongli, was a native of Liaodong. He entered the Earth Lung Mountains to study under Dong Feng.

Dong Feng transmitted to him the method of circulating qi and consuming wood essence, saying to Bo He: "My Dao ends here. Without the divine elixir or golden cinnabar, I cannot wander the world without restriction. You are still young and strong—broaden your search."

Bo He then traveled to West City Mountain to study under Master Wang. The Master taught Bo He the *Great Dao Formula*, saying: "Within this mountain’s stone chamber, gaze intently at the northern wall. When you see writing upon it, you will attain the Dao." After three years of gazing, Bo He finally discerned the characters—ancient inscriptions carved by those who came before. They were the *Divine Elixir Formula of the Great Clarity Central Scripture*, the celestial writings of the Three Sovereigns in large script, and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, all etched into the stone. Bo He recited the ten thousand words, but where their meaning eluded him, Master Wang imparted the secret: "To become an earthbound immortal, go to Linlü Mountain."

It is further said: Gong Song, a native of Langye, was learned in literature and authored two hundred scrolls of Daoist texts. By ingesting mica, he became an earthbound immortal.

It is also said: Li Changzai of Shu Commandery devoted himself to the Dao from youth. He was often seen at the foot of Tiger Longevity Mountain. Tao Qian’s *Record of the Peach Blossom Spring* states: During the Tai Kang era of the Jin, a fisherman from Wuling followed a stream, losing track of distance. Suddenly, he came upon a grove of peach blossoms, their fragrant petals lining the banks in vivid splendor, scattered petals drifting like confetti. When the grove ended, he found a mountain with a small opening so narrow at first that only after four or five steps did it suddenly open into a vast expanse. Houses stood in rows, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried through the air, and the clothing of men and women was no different from that of the outside world. Seeing the fisherman, they were startled but prepared wine and food for him. They explained that their ancestors had fled the turmoil of the Qin, bringing their families here, and had since remained cut off from the outside. When asked what era it was, they knew nothing of the Han, Wei, or Jin. After leaving, the fisherman reported this to the prefect, who sent men to follow him back, but they became lost and could not find the place again.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Liu Ping of Pei studied the Dao under Ji Qiuzi and regularly ingested quartz. Though over three hundred years old, he retained a youthful appearance. Once in Chang’an, nobles who heard of his mastery came to pay their respects. Over a hundred people followed him, and when he encountered bandits, he admonished them: "You call yourselves men, yet your hearts are like wolves. Teaching one another to block roads, endangering others for your own gain—this is the way of corpses piled in the marketplace, flesh fed to crows and kites." One bandit suddenly prostrated himself in terror and fled. Later, Liu Ping entered Mount Taibai and, after decades, returned to his hometown with an even more youthful countenance.

It is also said: Yin Si, styled Shaolong, was a native of Anding. On the night of the fifteenth day of the first month in the fifth year of Yuan Kang of the Jin, he sat in his house and sent his son to observe the moon for anything unusual. His brother reported: "There will soon be a great flood. I see a man in the moon wearing a raincoat and bearing a sword." Yin Si looked for himself and said: "The man in the moon wields a sword and crouches with a spear—great chaos is coming. After thirty years, there will be a brief respite." Later, Yin Si vanished without a trace.

It is further said: Huang Chuping of Danxi was fifteen when his family sent him to herd sheep. A Daoist, seeing his sincerity, took him to a stone chamber in Mount Jinhua, where he remained for over forty years, never once thinking of home. His elder brother, Huang Chuqi, searched for him for years until he met a Daoist in the marketplace who told him where to find him. Chuqi followed the Daoist and was finally reunited with his brother.

Upon finishing their conversation, Chuqi asked where the sheep were. Chuping replied, "They are nearby to the east." Chuqi went to look and saw only white stones. Chuping then went and shouted at the stones, which transformed into tens of thousands of sheep. Realizing his brother had attained the Daoist Way, Chuqi rushed home to join him in consuming pine resin and fuling, living thus for five hundred years. Chuping changed his name to Master Red Pine, while Chuqi took the name Red Lu Ban.

It is further said: Lü Gong, styled Wenjing, was gathering herbs in the Taihang Mountains when he suddenly encountered someone who bestowed upon him an immortal formula. Having attained the Way, he sent Gong away, saying, "You may now visit your hometown." Later, when Lü Xi, a descendant of Gong, became a Daoist, the people revered and served him. Gong’s message reached Xi’s home, and upon knocking at the door to inquire, a servant came out and asked where he had come from. Gong replied, "This is my home." Xi, hearing this, rushed out in joy and bowed. Gong then transmitted the divine formula to Xi before departing. Xi was already eighty years old at the time, but after consuming the formula, he regained his youth. He lived to two hundred years before entering the mountains, and his descendants never aged thereafter.

It is further said: Shen Jian of Danyang came from a family of officials. Fond of the Dao and unwilling to serve in office, he studied the arts of consuming elixirs and dietary regimens. He could heal illnesses and move swiftly, sometimes vanishing and returning. After over three hundred years of this, he disappeared without a trace.

It is further said: Xu Yuanyou’s third son, named Kou, styled Xiang, and known in childhood as Wangfu, abandoned worldly affairs and dwelled at the foot of Mount Leiping, diligently cultivating his practice. He often wished to journey early to the grotto heavens and had no desire to linger long in the mortal world.

He then journeyed to the Northern Grotto. In the sixth year of Taihe of the Liang dynasty, at his former residence on Mount Mao, he passed away at the age of thirty. Thereafter, he dwelled in the square halls of the mountain grottoes, often coming and going from the Four-Square Terrace. Later, he ascended as a Perfected Immortal of the Highest Clarity.

It is further said: Ma Mingsheng of Linzi served as a county clerk. While pursuing bandits, he was wounded, but encountered the Grand Perfected, who healed him with a divine pellet. Later, he became a disciple of Anqisheng and received the Great Clarity elixir. He lived in the world for five hundred years before departing in the Guanghe era of Emperor Ling of the Han.

*The Records of Immortals Gathered* states: Yang Ping, whose original name is unknown, dwelled on Mount Yangping and possessed many arts of transformation. When asked, he would say, "I am but an immortal of the Yangping Grotto." He claimed that on the three great festivals of the Three Primes each year, the perfected immortals of the heavens would descend to roam the grotto-heavens, observing the good and evil of the world, the life and death of mortals, the rise and fall of states, and the occurrence of floods, droughts, winds, and rains—all of which were reported in advance within the grottoes. The dragon spirits and the deities of temples that received blood sacrifices were all governed by the grotto-fiefdoms. The immortal bureaus within the grottoes were like the prefectures, counties, and villages of the mortal world—too numerous to record in detail. Having spoken, he departed. Here ends the fifth section of the Daoist Canon.

**Section Six: Liberation Through Corpse Transformation**

*The Transmission of the Perfected King of Xicheng* states: The Way of transformation through liberation is not one where the corpse fails to accompany the spirit in metamorphosis.

*The Upper Scripture of the Precious Sword* says: The methods of corpse liberation include those who die and then revive; those whose heads are severed yet emerge from another side; and those whose forms remain but whose bones vanish. It further states: Corpse liberation is the refining and shedding of one’s original true form, the hidden departure of the five constituents. Though it ranks among the lower grades of immortality, the endowment it confers is not insignificant. It is what is meant by "concealing the three luminaries" and "sinking into the earth in broad daylight." Those who cultivate the lower form of corpse liberation may never again gaze upon their homeland—this is the Way of the higher liberation. Their names are recorded on the Purple Registers, and the Three Bureaus may no longer scrutinize their flaws. Though they attain hidden transcendence, their worldly aspirations remain unfulfilled, and they may not return, thus their wanderings are without fixed abode.

It also states: One who drinks an elixir dissolved in water and embraces grass while lying down, then perishes in an empty chamber, is said to have achieved liberation through martial means. It further says: Only the eightfold purity of the highest rank is recorded in the registers of the celestial lists, received but not enacted; all others achieve corpse liberation in broad daylight and become flying immortals.

*The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* says: At the moment of corpse liberation, when death comes by blade, flood, fire, or excruciating pain, the suffering is no different from that of ordinary mortals. Only after death does the spirit depart, while the form remains behind as a sign.

It further states: Dong Zhongju, a native of Huainan, practiced qi absorption and bodily refinement from a young age. Though he lived over a hundred years, he never aged. Once falsely imprisoned, he departed through corpse liberation. It also says: Qing Pingji, a man of Pei, died during the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Han. Yet by the time of Emperor Guangwu, he had not aged. Later, he departed through corpse liberation.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* says: Gu Huan, styled Yuanping, was a native of Wu Commandery. During the Yongping era of the Qi dynasty, he died on Mount Shan in Shanyin and was buried in Leyu Village, Yanofficial. A tree with interlocking branches grew upon his grave, and the county magistrate Jiang Shantu submitted a memorial on the matter. Huan had departed through corpse liberation. It further states: Xin Xuanzǐ, styled Yanqi, was a native of Dinggu in Longxi. Fond of the Dao, he was crossing the Changliang Ford of the Qin River when he drowned and departed through liberation. It also says: Zhang Zuchang, a man of Pengcheng, came north during the Wu dynasty. Entering the grotto chambers of Fang Mountain, he feigned death in a carriage accident and concealed his transformation in a secluded abode, where he cultivated the practice of guarding the One. It further states: Liu Pinghe, whose given name is unknown, served as the magistrate of Pinghe in Jiujiang during the late Han. Practicing medicine, he performed acts of virtue, healing others’ illnesses as if they were his own. While traveling, he encountered the immortal Zhou Zhengshi, who transmitted to him the Way of hidden preservation.

Residing in the grotto chambers of Fang Mountain, he regularly absorbed the morning qi of the sun and moon, his countenance remaining youthful. Later, he departed through liberation. It further states: Those who receive the Great Precepts and die undergo extinction and refinement of the spirit, ascending to replenish the celestial offices—this is called liberation. It also says: When a person dies, one must examine their form. If they appear as in life, their feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, and eyes undimmed, these are all cases of liberation. Ascending by daylight is itself immortality, not an instance of liberation; those who achieve liberation through elixirs do not qualify. Those who transform through the ingestion of divine pills cannot return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices seize them. Departing by daylight is called upper liberation; departing at midnight is called lower liberation; departing at dusk is called the steward of the underworld.

The *Qiongwen Siji Pian* states: Those who obtain the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* ascend through daylight liberation. Some say: The *Feathered Flight Scripture* is light. The *Liuji Pian* also states: Those who possess the *Divine Book of Purple Mushrooms* or the *Five Elders’ Treasure Scripture* achieve liberation. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a native of Kuaiji. Sun Quan of Wu held him in high regard, often saying, “Master Jie, hasten your departure.” Sun Quan refused to listen. Xiang feigned illness, and Sun Quan sent attendants to bestow upon him a box of fine pears. In an instant, Xiang died and departed through liberation.

It further states: The Nine Flowers Sanctuary of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace instructed Lord Yang: “Seek the Way of the Liberated Sword to ensure an auspicious end. Exhaust yourself in silent departure, harmonizing the traces of concealment and revelation.” It also says: Ge Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, received the *Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquid Scripture* from Zuo Ci. He regularly consumed wood and told his disciple Zhang Feng: “I shall depart through liberation. On the twelfth day of the eighth month, I will depart.” When the appointed time arrived, Xuan donned his robes and cap, his breath ceased, yet his complexion remained unchanged—he departed through liberation.

It further states: Shi Yagong, named Xie Yuan, was a native of Liyang and a disciple of Fei Zhangfang. When the Daoist Li Yiqi departed with two disciples after many years, Zhangfang and the two disciples all transformed and vanished through liberation. It also says: Bao Shuo, styled Taixuan, was a native of Langye and lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Jin. Yin Jun, the father-in-law of Ge Hong, transmitted to him the method of liberation. Another account states: Jing was a native of Shangdang, a descendant of Bao Xuan, the Han dynasty Minister of Justice. Cultivating the body and nurturing nature, he departed through liberation at over seventy years of age. There was one Xu Ning who studied under Shuo. One night, Ning heard the sound of a zither in Shuo’s chamber and inquired about it. Shuo replied: “Ji Shuye once manifested his traces at the Eastern Market, but in truth, it was a martial liberation.”

The *Jin Zhongxing Shu* records: Ge Hong was appointed magistrate of Goulou but was detained in Guangzhou by the regional inspector Deng Yue, who refused to let him proceed. Hong remained on Mount Luofu, refining elixirs for years. Suddenly, he wrote to Yue, stating he would travel afar to seek herbs. When Yue received the letter and hastened to bid farewell, Hong had already passed. At eighty-one, his complexion was as in life; his body was as light as empty clothing when placed in the coffin—he departed through liberation.

The *Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Wu Meng, styled Yunshi, possessed Daoist arts. When Yu Liang heard of his divine marvels, he respectfully welcomed him to Wuchang. Soon after, Meng sought to return home, claiming his allotted lifespan had ended and requesting a coffin. Yu Liang, grieved, immediately sent him off. Meng died fifty *li* from home, his form appearing as in life.

It further states: If the Six Conducts remain unmastered and past cultivation is meager, one enters the middle rank, achieving liberation and transformation. Below this, one undergoes proper burial. Those with shallow merits and inferior practices descend to the lower stages. Those who excel achieve extinction and rebirth. After rebirth, one cultivates the Dao according to the measure of their merits before attaining the Way.

The *Tai Shang Taixiao Langshu* states: Those who study the highest methods and enter the mountains and forests, consuming divine herbs, may, due to karmic conditions, achieve liberation and harmonize with the world. Though their rites differ greatly from the worldly, they use neither coffin nor outer casket. They sweep the mountaintops and the depths beneath the trees, covering themselves with a single blanket upon the earth.

The *Tai Shang Tai Zhen Ke* states: When making offerings to ancestors, one should discern whether they have returned. Those who ascend through merit and virtue, with descendants of benevolence and filial piety, may transform their forms and return to wander—these are akin to liberation.

The *Biography of the Golden Watchtower Sage* states: The *Divine Book of Purple Text*, also called the *Five Elders’ Treasure Scripture*, grants liberation to those who possess it and attainment of the Dao to those who practice it. The *Biography of the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea* records: The *Baodong Guanjing* states: Those who possess the *Upper Mystery of the Numinous Purchase* ascend through daylight liberation.

The *Baopuzi* states: Among the Daoist groves are five types of liberation talismans; the present *Tai Xuan Yin Sheng Fu* is one that liberates from illness. The *Biographies of the Immortals* records: Ning Feng, the Pottery Master during the time of the Yellow Emperor, burned himself in fire and ascended and descended with the smoke. The *Zhen Gao* states: Ning Feng consumed stone brains, and fire was his medium—this was a fire liberation.

It further states: Sima Jizhu, a man of the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, received the Way of the Liberated Sword from Xiling Zidu. Residing in the Great Abundance Palace on Mount Weiyu, he consumed the essence of bright cinnabar and embraced the radiance of the morning sun. His appearance was like that of a woman, with a beard three feet long. He had one son, named Fayu, and one daughter, named Jihua, both of whom obtained the *Scripture of the Perfected Dao*. It is said that Jizhu ascended in concealment after consuming divine powder, though his head and feet were in separate places. This resembles the method of martial liberation. Those who undergo martial liberation cannot remain in the Great Ultimate, yet his daughter still studied the *Cave Scripture*, indicating she cultivated a separate, loftier method.

Shou Xuanbai of the White Guard secluded himself on the eastern peak of Mount Taimao. He could conceal his form and often appeared in the guise of Jie Yan, a disciple of the White Lamb Master. He now resides on Fang Mountain in Jian’an. Yan was initially executed by Sun Quan but departed through liberation.

It is further said: Elühua was a female immortal. In the third year of the Shengping reign of Emperor Mu of Jin (jiyou, 359 CE), on the tenth day of the eleventh month, she descended to the household of Yang Quan, claiming to be a native of Mount Nanshan. Quan, styled Daoxue, was the grandfather of Yang Xin, a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate during the reign of Emperor Jianwen of Jin. Both Quan and Xin secretly cultivated the essentials of the Dao, delighting in the profound and savoring the true. Elühua declared: "For all those who cultivate the Dao, regard noble rank as a passing traveler and gold and jade as mere tiles and pebbles—thus may they attain longevity." Thereupon, she transmitted to Quan the method of *corpse liberation*, and he too concealed his radiance and departed through transformation.

It is further said: Lady Wang, the Central Marquis, received from her nephew Jin the Dao of *flying liberation and the untying of the net*. It is further said: Cai Tiansheng, a native of Shanggu, sold incense in his youth upon the wilds. Of benevolent nature and fond of the Dao, he once encountered the River Earl’s youngest daughter selling incense on Mount Tianshan.

It is further said: Han Chong, styled Changji, was a native of Wu Commandery. A man of the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, he was fond of the Dao from his youth. The immortal Wang Zhangxuan of the Forest Chamber once transmitted to him the method of *Flowing Pearl Elixir*, which Chong reverently cultivated. After it proved highly efficacious, Zhangxuan bestowed upon him the method of *concealed liberation* and departed, entering the Great Huo Mountain to transcend the world as the Supervisor of the Right within the Central Bureau. The *Records of Daily Activities of the Han* states: When Li Shaojun was about to depart, Emperor Wu dreamed of ascending a high mountain with him, where he saw an emissary proclaiming the summons of the Great One. Upon waking, he said to his attendants, "Shaojun is about to depart." Several days later, Shaojun indeed fell ill and died, then departed through liberation.

The *Red Writ of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Three Primes’ Royal Talismans* and the *Five Chapters of Numinous Treasure True Writ* both emerged from the Purple Tenuity Palace atop Jade Capital Mountain in the Great Mystery Metropolis. This writ averts the baleful influences of the *nine cycles of yang* and the *one hundred six calamities*, aligning with their reckonings to deliver the bodies of cultivators. Within the Mystery Metropolis, this scripture is possessed; those who bear it may ascend as sages to the Grand Clarity. Should their merit and virtue remain unfulfilled, they may yet attain *corpse liberation*.

It is further said: She Qi, styled Guangping, was a native of Jingzhao. At the beginning of the Jian’an era, he came to the Jiangdong region to serve Sun Ce. Later, he encountered Master Jie Yan, who transmitted to him, recognizing him as an extraordinary person.

Having bowed twice and received its incense fire, the Maiden then taught him the method of paying homage to the Heavenly Thearch and August Sovereign, after which he departed through *corpse liberation*, concealing himself upon the Square Terrace.

The *Traditions of Lord Lao* states: The Nine Perfected and Five Minerals briefly enter the Grand Yin. Only after passing through the Three Bureaus may one obtain the method of *upper liberation*.

It further says: The Purple Yang Duke transmitted the method of *sword liberation* from the Western City. After cultivating and wearing the divine sword for seven years, he inscribed vermilion talismans and departed through transformation. If one employs the *Crooked Dawn* to fly essence and inscribe them, one may instantly transform, vanish, and conceal oneself, whereupon the Grand Unity dispatches auspicious radiance and treasure robes to welcome them.

It further says: Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, upon observing Cai Jing’s bone configuration, knew he was destined for *corpse liberation* and imparted to him essential teachings. Fangping wore a *Far-Wandering Cap*, a vermilion robe, a tiger-headed pouch, multicolored sashes, and a yellow-hued sword; his beard was sparse, and his stature moderate. He rode a feathered carriage drawn by five dragons, adorned with variegated sashes, streamers, and banners before and behind, descending from the heavens. In an instant, he was introduced to Jing’s father and elder brother, then sent them away. He summoned Ma Gu, who reported having already received the summons to inspect Penglai and would depart at once, returning shortly. After two such intervals, when Ma Gu arrived, the sound of men and horses preceded her; her retinue was half the size of Fangping’s when she arrived, and Jing’s entire household beheld her. Though of fine years, she appeared no older than a maiden, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her garments bore patterns yet were neither brocade nor embroidery, their radiance dazzling like the sun, indescribable—all things unseen in the mortal world. She entered and bowed to Yuan, who rose to greet her. Each proceeded to the feast hall where delicacies were served, including unicorn jerky, before Yuan departed.

Jing’s parents privately questioned him, and he replied: “Lord Wang often resides on Kunlun Mountain, traveling to and from Mount Luofu and others. Upon those mountains stand palaces; when Lord Wang emerges, he rides but a single yellow unicorn, accompanied by a dozen attendants. With every journey, the spirits of mountains and seas all pay homage and bow in audience.” Yuan left a letter for Prefect Chen, its script expansive yet irregular, grand but uneven.

Previously, none knew Fangping’s name, but Yuan learned it thus. Chen Cun preserved Lord Wang’s handwritten letter in a small box. Later, Jing departed through *shijie*.

It is further said: Zhang Weizi was the daughter of Zhang Qing, the Grand Architect during Emperor Zhao of Han’s reign. Weizi loved the Dao and achieved *shijie*.

It is also said: Su Zixun was a man of Qi, yet none knew he possessed the Dao. In his village, he practiced trust and yielding, and over the years, his complexion never aged. When people pursued him, he vanished from sight. He often consumed elixirs, favored pure discourse, and habitually read the *Book of Changes* in leisure, composing texts all imbued with meaning. When the nobles of the capital heard of him, none failed to seek him with reverence, yet he could not be summoned. Later, when he happened to go out, the nobles’ carriages and parasols filled the road, and scholars reported that he had just departed—he was the one riding a donkey on the eastern path. Each spurred their horses in pursuit, but none caught up. Zixun arrived at Lord Chen’s home and said: “Tomorrow I shall depart and not return.” Lord Chen presented him with a single unlined garment of kudzu cloth. At the appointed time, Zixun died, dissolving into transcendence and ascending as an immortal.

It is further said: Yin Changsheng was a native of Xinye. Later, as a member of the Han imperial consort’s kin, he devoted himself wholly to the Daoist arts. Hearing that Ma Mingsheng had attained the Way of transcending the world, he sought him out. Mingsheng merely engaged him in lofty discourse day and night, discussing current affairs and the cultivation of fields and farming. Thus passed over a decade, and Changsheng never wavered. Of the twelve who studied with Mingsheng, all had departed, yet Changsheng alone grew ever more earnest. Mingsheng said: “You have truly attained the Dao.” He then led him into Mount Qingcheng and transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Grand Clarity Divine Elixir*. Upon completing the elixir, he ascended as an immortal. Changsheng composed nine scrolls, stating: “In high antiquity, immortals were many, but since the rise of the Han, forty-five have been recorded—including myself, six in total. Thirty achieved *shijie*, while the rest ascended in broad daylight.” Lord Yin’s preface reads: “In the first year of *Yanguang* of the Han, the disciple from the northern hills of Xinye received the essential secrets of the divine elixir from the Immortal Lord. Having perfected the Dao and departed the world, he entrusted them to the famous mountains.” Thereupon, Lord Yin tore yellow silk and inscribed the elixir scripture. One copy, encased in patterned stone, was placed on Mount Song; another, written on lacquered *huanglu* wood slips and sealed in green jade, was placed on Mount Taihua; a third, inscribed on golden slips and sealed in silver, was deposited on Mount Shuijing in Shu. One scroll, written on fine silk and compiled into a single volume, was entrusted to his disciples, to be transmitted through the generations. He also composed three poems to reveal to posterity.

It is further said: The Immortal Duke, named Wu Ding, was a native of Guiyang. During the Later Han, he served as a minor clerk in the county. Taciturn yet magnanimous, he was broadly learned in the classics, acquiring knowledge without a teacher, possessing a nature of spontaneity. Once, while on a mission to the capital, he returned via Changsha Commandery. Arriving too late to lodge at the postal station, he spent the night in the wilds.

Suddenly, he heard voices from atop a tree saying, "We are bound for Changsha to purchase herbs." At dawn, he looked and saw two white cranes. The Immortal Duke found this strange and followed them to the market, where he saw two men walking together beneath a white canopy. They said to him, "You are destined to become an earthbound immortal." They then instructed him to return home. Soon after, the Immortal Duke fell ill and died, his body undergoing liberation through simulated death.

It is further said: Long Bogao was praised by Ma Yuan, the General Who Pacifies the Waves of the Later Han, in his admonition to his brother’s sons as a man of exemplary virtue worthy of emulation. Later, Bogao received the method of ingesting fetal qi from the immortal Diao Daolin, and also the recipe for consuming the "Green Elixir," after which he became intoxicated and departed. He concealed himself on Fangtai Mountain, where the Master of Registers, Jun, ordained him. Bogao, whose given name was Shu, was a native of Jingzhao. During the Jianwu era of the Han, he served as the Magistrate of Xiandu and later as the Grand Administrator of Lingling. In his letter admonishing his brother’s son Yan, Ma Yuan wrote: "Long Bogao is sincere, circumspect, and prudent; his words are without fault. He is modest, frugal, impartial, and incorruptible, yet commands respect. I cherish and esteem him—may you and your peers emulate him."

It is also said: The wife of Cheng Wei, a Gatekeeper of the Han, was an adept who had attained the Dao and could master transformations. Cheng Wei pressed her to teach him her arts, but she refused. When he persisted relentlessly, she suddenly collapsed and died, her body undergoing liberation through simulated death and departing.

The *Inner Transmission of the Lady Wei of Nanyue* states: The Perfected One of Pure Emptiness, Wang Zideng, and the Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence descended together and bestowed upon her the formula "Hidden Transmutation: White Canopy Spirit Powder." They also gave her the "Spiritual Pill of Transformed Essence from White Stone and Refined Gold," instructing her to consume it all at once. She was to feign illness and remain secluded, for a fixed time had been set for their meeting at the Southern Yang Terrace of Luoshan, within the Yang Terrace Palace of Luoyang. With these words, the two Perfected Ones departed. She immediately took the medicine, then claimed a foot ailment, closed her eyes, and rested, drinking but abstaining from food. After midnight, the Supreme Unity and the Mystic Immortals dispatched a whirlwind chariot to fetch her, riding the qi and driving straight into her chamber. At that moment, her disciples attended her illness, and her family filled the room, yet none perceived what transpired.

The Southern Yang Terrace of Luoshan was where Yu of the Xia Dynasty once inscribed stone during his tour of the famous mountains. Below lies the Terrace of Radiance, where over ten thousand divine immortals and scholars gather.

It is also said: Lady Wang Jinxian was the daughter of Wang Yifu of the Jin Dynasty and wife to Crown Prince Minhuai. When Luoyang fell into chaos, Liu Yao abducted Jinxian, intending to take her as his wife. Jinxian cursed fiercely: "I am the wife of the imperial crown prince, the daughter of the Minister of Education—how dare a petty Qiang barbarian presume to defile me?" With these words, she cast herself into the river. Her maidservant, named Liuchu, also leapt into the river and perished. At that moment, the Perfected Woman of Mount Songgao, Han Xihua, was traveling nearby. She rescued them both, outwardly feigning their deaths while secretly conveying their bodies into Mount Songgao, where they now dwell within the Hua Yang Inner Grotto.

Liuchu was over twenty, refined in appearance and steadfast in virtue. She bore the surname Tian, hailing from Yuyang, and was the granddaughter of Tian Feng, former magistrate of Junyi during the Wei Dynasty. Feng’s hidden virtue extended even to Liuchu.

It is further said: Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was a native of Houguan. During the reign of the former lord of Wu, a young man served as magistrate of Feng’s home county. Seeing Feng, then over forty, the magistrate perceived no sign of his Daoist attainment and resigned his post. Over fifty years later, he encountered Feng again while traveling through Houguan in another official capacity. All the former officials and locals went to see him, yet Feng’s appearance remained unchanged from years past. He dwelled in the mountains without farming, treating illnesses without accepting payment. Those he cured were instructed to plant five apricot trees. Over the years, these grew to over a hundred thousand trees. He allowed people to exchange a vessel of grain for apricots, using the grain to relieve the poor and aid travelers in need, amounting to over twenty thousand *hu* annually. Eventually, he departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).

Master Pei said: Those who attain *shijie* as immortals cannot ride the flowered canopy, mount flying dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, or wander the Nine Palaces. Some, through the singular practice of the "Flying Essence Sword Liberation" at dawn, achieve the Eightfold Simplicity and Arrayed Records. Yet Dong Feng, though he treasured secrets and did not cultivate, still attained *shijie* in broad daylight. Others who employ water, fire, weapons, illness, or liberation through great swords or bamboo staves must first visit famous mountains, where they become *Taiqing* (Great Clarity) *shijie* immortals. All who practice the Way of Sword Liberation inscribe their names on purple slips, submitting them to the lofty immortals. Those with prior merit, virtuous deeds, hidden virtue, and faith in immortality may ascend to the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Mound Palace to study the Dao and become Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces. Those who employ the Great Ultimate *shijie* and depart at midnight serve as Earth Perfected. Depending on the depth of their cultivation, the steadfastness of their resolve, or their role as libationers refining essences or administering healing, they may become rulers of the Thirty-Six Grotto Heavens. Those who achieve *wenjie* (civil liberation) govern the underworld for 140 years before transformation, while *wujie* (martial liberation) ghost masters govern for 280 years before transformation. Only after three such ranks may they advance to immortal office.

The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Birth Chapters* states: Those who study the supreme Way, aspire to immortality, and attain *shijie* will ultimately achieve the Dao of immortality. Though their transformations differ, they do not intermingle, for all enter the perfection of the Way.

The *Bright Perfection Regulations* states: Those who in life love the Dao, refine their merit, and inscribe their virtuous names in the Upper Clarity may attain *shijie*. As lesser immortals, they wander the Five Peaks, later reincarnating among humans to receive scriptures and become masters of their kind.

The *Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: All who attain *shijie* must, according to the *True Regulations of the Four Poles*, wait 140 years before becoming Perfected Officials of the Divine Realm. Only then may they ride the flowered canopy, mount winged dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, and wander the Nine Palaces.

The *Scripture of the Feminine Unity and Five Elders* states: When immortals depart this world, some vanish without trace, concealing their inner governance while appearing outwardly engaged; others leave behind swords and staves, drifting away like clouds and mist, their spirits lodged in mystery, their origins unknown. It also says: Those who possess this scripture of the Five Elders, even without fasting, meditation, or separating from the mundane, will not lose their hidden spiritual essence. They may attain *shijie* in broad daylight, pass through the Great Yin, or become underworld governors. Some leave behind bones or undergo womb transformation, receiving rebirth in the Southern Palace—all due to prior karmic affinity.

The *Scripture of the Upper Clarity* states: The Celestial Emperor of Primordial Beginning transmitted to the Southern Pole Primordial Lord seventy-four methods of bodily transformation and liberation from the Upper Clarity.

The *Inner Transmission of the Perfected of Great Clarity* and the *Records of Famous Mountains* state: The grotto of Mount Luofu spans five hundred *li*, located south of Kuaiji. Thirty *li* into the mountain, its peaks rise precipitously, where Ge Hong attained liberation.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* calls it Mount Zengcheng.

The *Collected Records of Immortals* states: Celestial Master Zhang Daoling secluded himself on Mount Longhu, cultivating the Way of the Three Primes’ Silent Audience. He obtained the Central Elixir of the Yellow Emperor’s Dragon and Tiger. After refining and consuming the elixir, he could divide his form and scatter his radiance. The Celestial Master entered Mount Songgao from Poyang and acquired the hidden scriptures of command and transformation. It further states: Zhou Yuanyou of Runan Ancheng was the daughter of Zhou Chang, governor of Henan during the Han. Chang’s lifelong hidden virtue extended to Yuanyou, who from childhood loved the Dao and consumed *fuling* (poria). Forty years later, she encountered Master Shi, who taught her the arts of vanishing and concealment, as well as the Way of Hidden Radiance. She departed through bodily liberation.

It is also said: Lu Meiniang of the Tang Dynasty was born with green eyebrows and a clever disposition. The governor of Nanhai presented her at court, where Emperor Shunzong marveled at her presence in the palace, calling her "Divine Maiden." She ate only a small measure of sesame rice. By the Yuanhe era, Emperor Xianzong admired her wisdom and bestowed upon her a golden phoenix bracelet for her wrist. Over time, she grew weary of palace life and was ordained as a Daoist priestess, allowed to return to Nanhai, where she was granted the title "Carefree." After several years of abstaining from food, she departed through *shijie*.

*The Scripture of the Recording of Forms and Spirits by the Supreme Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate’s Stone Essence and Golden Radiance* states: The method of forging the sword was originally transmitted by the Lord of the Western City, who governs all Perfected Ones, to the Purple Yang Duke, who practiced the Dao to completion. The Lord of the Western City also imparted the method of *sword liberation* and the *Ninefold Cyclical Elixir Formula* to Master Changli, who was a man of Zhou.

*The Preface of the Eastern Village* says: "Rinsing the dragon embryo to determine life and death, and ingesting the jade blossoms of the former master Wang of the Western City"—this refers to the practice of sword liberation after consuming the elixir, though it does not mention the *Ninefold Cyclical Elixir*. Though the formula was transmitted, it was not ultimately employed, and was later passed to disciples. Lord Mao also received it but did not use it, hence it was merely "passed on." *The Transmission of Lord Mao* records that Lady Wei of South Mountain transmitted it to Lord Yang, and the Consort of An remarked that one could seek the Way of Sword Liberation, though it is unknown whether it was ultimately practiced. As Magistrate Xu had already ingested *yushi* (fat stone), he may not have needed to pursue this method. However, his liberation by night in Zhenan followed a different path, for he was the son of Magistrate Xu. If this were *Great Clarity Liberation* or the use of the sword alone, he should not have been able to return to his homeland. Yet Yuan wandered freely in Fangtai and returned to his native land. When the divine sword is employed for liberation and transformation, one may roam and feast in the Great Ultimate, gather the numinous tracks of the Five Stars, and radiate the majestic light of the Seven Origins, shaping and reflecting the true qi with awe-inspiring brilliance. Thus, where are the swords buried by the Yellow Emperor on Mount Qiao? The household of the Prince of Bohai had a sword that cried out in an empty coffin; Wang Qiao’s tomb in Jingling had a sword that soared into the heavens—these are true proofs of the essence of the Nine Mysteries, responding to the numinous power of the Great Spirit, manifesting the wondrous transformations of the mighty sword.

Those who achieve *sword liberation* use the sword in place of the body. After five hundred years, the sword naturally returns to its original place. *Sword liberation* is not the only method. Those who employ cinnabar scriptures may also use an empty sword to produce eerie echoes, though such phenomena are elusive and difficult to trace, and cannot be spoken of. Those who cannot attain it may only perceive it in their hearts. The divine and marvelous are fleeting and formless, shifting without pattern, beyond the expectations of ordinary reason. One must follow the transformations with the heart and adapt to circumstances. Those who practice it do not perceive how it manifests, and those who witness it cannot fathom its workings.

The Yellow Emperor gathered copper from a hundred mountains to cast a cauldron, with tigers, leopards, and a hundred beasts tending the fire and assisting the furnace. When the Yellow Emperor suddenly passed, he was buried on Mount Qiao. Five hundred years later, the mountain collapsed, revealing his treasure sword and red slippers—yet one day, they vanished again. Wang Ziqiao once visited Mount Zhong, where he obtained *The Scripture of Nine Transformations and Ten Changes*, enabling him to conceal the sun and moon and wander among the stars. Later, he suddenly fell ill and died, and a tomb was prepared for him on Mount Bohai. During the reign of King Xiang of Xia, someone opened Wang Ziqiao’s tomb and found a sword resting on the northern couch, emitting a dragon’s cry—no one dared approach. Later, it too disappeared. Wang Ziqiao’s tomb in Jingling was opened again during the Warring States period, and a sword was seen. As someone reached for it, the sword suddenly flew away.

Accounts of Wang Ziqiao differ: some say Master Fuqiu carried him away on a crane to ascend Mount Song. In truth, he achieved liberation at the age of fifty-five or fifty-six, hence his wearing of the *Far-Ranging Traveler’s Cap*. Ge Hong once wrote that Lord Yin transmitted the method of *corpse liberation* to Bao Jing. After Bao’s death, he was buried at Stone Child Ridge. When someone opened his coffin, they saw a great blade, and heard the sounds of men and horses around the tomb—no one dared take it. This resembles the method of *sword liberation*, though the sword did not fly away. It was likely the *Numinous Treasure Great Mystery Yin-Sheng Talisman*, inscribed in cinnabar on the blade. Below the *Great Clarity* level, one merely attains life.

According to *The Numinous Transmission of Jade Clarity*, the Lord of the Western City wore a sword, and Lord Yang of Tongbai also wore one—these were likely cases of prior *sword liberation*. When a Perfected One employs a treasure sword for *corpse liberation*, it is a cicada-like shedding, the highest grade. The methods of *corpse liberation* are many, like the cicada’s molt. This sword, however, is not a molt, hence it is called the highest grade, signifying the loftiest path of transformation and concealment.

When forging the sword, one must first purify oneself for a hundred days. Then, in a secluded place near a clear spring, construct a west-facing chamber, with the furnace’s mouth also facing west. A skilled smith should refine fine iron, combining it with *shengdie* (raw iron) to forge a sword weighing eight *jin*. To attain its utmost essence, bamboo charcoal should be used. Copper and tin should be softened and blended, requiring much time and effort—thus, the ancients took three years to complete a sword. Xue Zhu said: "The Ouye smiths cast swords on the Red Bell Mountain, where tin was mined after breaking the rock; the Ruoye Stream was drained to extract copper." When these are combined and smelted, the metal is refined without drying, becoming hard, sharp, and malleable.

The smith must be gentle and kind, wearing new clothes and bathing. On the day of forging, he must not consume alcohol or meat, nor tread in filth. The sword should be made on the *gengshen* day of the seventh month or the *xinyou* day of the eighth month. Its length should be three *chi* and nine *cun*, its width one *cun* and four *fen*, and its thickness three and a half *fen*—this refers to the thickness near the hilt along the spine. Toward the edges of the blade, it may be reduced by one or two *li*. From the spine, taper two *fen* toward the edge, then shape the blade to the tip, gradually thinning it. The tip, nine *cun* in length, should be measured from the ring’s neck, with the spine carved to a width of three *fen* and eight *li*, ensuring the central ridge retains six *fen*. The tip, nine *fen* in length, should taper on both sides to a sharp point, forming two edges like a halberd. The hilt should be of a length that makes the ring two *cun* and four *fen* high, with the blade measuring two *chi* and four *cun*, leaving one *chi*, two *cun*, and six *fen* for the hilt. The iron tang should be centered, nine *fen* wide and two *fen* thick, connecting to the ring.

The hilt should be crafted from catalpa wood, with a circumference of four *cun* and nine *fen* near the ring and three *cun* and nine *fen* near the blade, both measured precisely by tapping to ensure accuracy. If fashioned as a sword, the grip should be flattened accordingly. The pommel may accommodate a greenish ring, forged from the initial refining of hard steel, ensuring the tang and blade remain seamlessly connected—never separately cast and joined with rivets. The overall form must maintain consistent dimensions in size and thickness, after which the hollowed interior is chiseled out. It may be easier to first drill several holes before carving. The base where the tang rests should be chiseled to a gentle curve.

Once complete, the main ring should stand two *cun* and four *fen* high, with its widest horizontal span measuring two *cun* and eight *fen* across the center. The inner square or circular opening should have a diameter of four *fen*. The forging styles of pommels vary across ages—some perfectly round, others elongated, or shaped like tripod handles—amounting to over ten distinct forms. The illustrations in this scripture merely demonstrate the bilateral symmetry of the design, not a fixed standard. Following ancient precedents, the diagram on the right presents a proportionate model.

The interior of the ring must not be perfectly round, like bamboo, nor perfectly square, like a ruler. Instead, the inner face should be slightly squared while the outer edges retain defined angles, ensuring the engraved blade characters remain upright without excessive slant. The total length is set at three *chi* and nine *cun*.

All measurements—length, breadth, thickness, and design—are fully specified. Refer to the accompanying diagrams, though note that ancient and modern *chi* differ in length. The *Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art* meticulously accounts for even the finest increments. Xun Kan, the Jin dynasty’s Minister of Central Affairs and a master of music and weaponry, lamented the discord of the eight sounds. Later, a jade pitch pipe from the Zhou era was unearthed, inscribed with its provenance and measuring four and a half *fen* shorter than the Jin *chi*. Using this relic, he recalibrated the musical scales, achieving perfect harmony. This scripture adopts the Zhou *chi* as its standard, for the Daoist scriptures of Zongtong and Tongbai were originally crafted with Zhou measurements.

The ring’s engravings—*lu huan*—involve carving the forged sword on both sides of the pommel. On the blade-facing side, nine "blade" characters (*ren*) are inscribed, while the reverse bears nine "already" characters (*yi*). The engravings follow the blade’s spine downward, aligning with the edges. The "blade" characters begin at the edge and descend toward the cutting edge, hence termed "following the blade." The carvings curve along the ring’s shape, thus called "following the ring." These incised grooves may be inlaid with gold or silver to enhance clarity and elegance.

The sword’s body bears symbolic engravings, and at the pommel’s center rises a small, ring-like protrusion called the *fuji* ("hidden base"). The *fuji* signifies the foundation of the sun and moon, concealing the radiance of autumn’s light. Within the inner ring’s left face, a "sun" character is carved, while the right face bears a "moon" character. The outer perimeter of the sun and moon is encircled by a border (*guo*). The inscription reads: *"Emerging after five hundred years, it sweeps the Five Peaks; concealed, it harbors no idle moments—veiling its spirit and concealing its form. Below, it governs the Nine Yin; above, it bears the Dark and Mysterious. It guards the feet to expel demonic forces, its might sufficient to reflect the Seven Luminaries. Uplifted, it mirrors the Five Qi; lowered, it transforms the body’s form."*

To distinguish the sword’s left, right, inner, and outer faces: hold the sword upright with the spine above and the edge below, pointing south. The eastern face is the right, the western face the left; the eastern side is the inner face, the western the outer face.

This sword’s dimensions—length, breadth, thickness, and engraved characters—serve as the model for the *Lingjian* ("Numinous Sword") of the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate. The Perfected of the Highest Clarity also wield such swords, all forged by the Great Ultimate. Thus, this scripture presents the Great Ultimate’s method, established by the Four Perfected. Why insist on metal from Kunwu or jade-cutting blades? This clarifies that the essence lies not in refined iron but in the model itself. Wang Ziqiao’s sword was but common iron; the sword of his liberation on Mount Qiao was no Kunwu’s flowing gold.

This discourse was imparted by Lord Ziyang of the Great Ultimate Perfected to Lord Wang. When the Yellow Emperor ascended to the Dark Garden in a dragon-drawn chariot, his celestial retinue exemplified such transformations. This concludes the preceding chapter of the *Sword Scripture*.

The *Taiyi Shanghua Fu* ("Supreme Transformation Talisman of the Great Ultimate") is inscribed in flying script on paper, then placed within a purple cord and affixed to the right side of the sword’s ring. The *Quchen Feijing Shu* ("Flying Script of the Curved Dawn") is inscribed on the left face of the sword, extending to the blade’s base.

The *Taiyi Cangjing Fu* ("Concealed Radiance Talisman of the Great Ultimate") is inscribed in flying script on paper, stored in a crimson pouch, and tied to the right side of the scabbard when departing. The *Quchen Feijing Shu* is inscribed on the right face of the sword, extending to the tip.

The *Taiyi Luxing Fu* ("Talisman of the Register’s Form of the Great Ultimate") is inscribed in flying script on paper and worn on the day of departure, enveloping the body in seven-colored clouds and generating lightning. The *Quchen Feijing Shu* is inscribed on the sword’s spine, spanning both edges.

The *Taiyi Jiehua Fu* ("Liberation Talisman of the Great Ultimate") is consumed daily—one talisman for seven years—to achieve transformation. It is written in cinnabar on bamboo or silk, as recorded in the *Secret Essentials*. When the *Quchen* elixir is complete, inscribe it on the sword before liberation. After seven years, even a cinnabar-inscribed sword can effect transformation.

Tao Hongjing remarked: During the Yongjia era of the Jin, Liu Zeng (pronounced *mai*) possessed extraordinary knowledge and was said to be a transcendent. His sword, inscribed with Sanskrit-like characters and intricate designs, was forged in the manner of the Mahayana Dharma, its iron exceptionally sharp. In the Liu-Song dynasty, it became a standard imperial guard weapon, known as *Liu Zeng’s Blade* or the *Thousand-Ox Saber*. Over time, the engravings on the ring and banner faded. Several old rings, nearly identical, were observed, though the whereabouts of their blades remained unknown. Gu Jushang of Dongshan also crafted such swords, and some made by his contemporaries survive to this day.

Generally, deviations and errors are too numerous to enumerate in full, such as casting bronze into rings to rivet onto old blades. Such cases may be inferred by analogy. The present design, however, is solely the profound craftsmanship of Tao Hongjing, whose understanding is deemed supremely reasoned—though whether it aligns with the Great Ultimate’s model remains uncertain.

To test a blade’s sharpness, take several stalks of *zhongxing mang* and bind them tightly with a single hair, suspending the bundle from a staff held by one person. Strike once with the blade: if the stalks sever while the hair remains unbroken, the number of stalks cut determines the blade’s quality. Liu Zeng’s *Bo* and the *Thousand-Ox Saber* could sever thirteen stalks in old tests. Another blade, a hundred-times forged steel saber, cut twelve stalks, and was hailed as unmatched in the realm. Yet a recently crafted divine sword severed fifteen stalks. Its iron gleams with a deep azure sheen, its luster extraordinary—truly what Xue Zhu described as "melting like ice about to dissolve."

In recent times, over a dozen smiths have attempted such work, but none have matched this. The finest unadorned steel was forged by Xie Ping of Shangyu, while the intricate carving and mounting were executed by Huang Wenqing, a master artisan of the Imperial Workshops—both unrivaled in the land. In the first year of Jianwu of the Qi (494 CE), on the nineteenth day of the eighth month, construction began at Maoshan, continuing until the fourth year of Tianjian of the Liang (505 CE). The project was commissioned to craft ceremonial blades for imperial use, their refinement and beauty unparalleled in the world. A distinct method for forging transverse-hardened steel was developed. The imperial household also produced hundred-times forged blades, and Huang Wenqing was exempted from corvée labor, becoming a Daoist of the mountain abbey.

The *Rites of Zhou* prescribes a sword three *chi* in length, with a hilt of five *cun*—one-sixth of the total. The inner edge spans two and a half *cun* in width, weighing fourteen *liang* by the ancient scale (equivalent to three *jin* and ten *liang* by the modern measure). Modern imperial swords measure four *chi* and seven *cun*, with a hilt of one *chi* and five *cun*—slightly less than one-third of the total. The blade is one *cun* and six *fen* wide, though weight varies. This treasured sword is three *chi* and nine *cun* long, with a blade one *cun* and four *fen* wide. The classics distinguish between *dao* (saber) and *jian* (sword).

In the tenth year of Taishi of Emperor Wu of Jin (274 CE), the Minister of Works, Xun Xu, and Zhang Hua, among others, recalibrated the pitch pipes and eight sounds, finding them discordant with ancient music. The discrepancy arose from the gradual elongation of the *chi* since the Han. They thus reverted to the *Zhou Rites’* method of measuring millet grains to cast new instruments. Seeking ancient artifacts, they obtained a jade pitch pipe from the Zhou era, matching the old standard to the finest degree. Striking ancient bells, they tuned them by this measure, and all resonated in harmony. Seven other ancient artifacts were compared and found consistent. They also recovered bamboo slips from the Ji Tomb, each two *chi* and four *cun* long. Adopting this as the "ancient *chi*," they implemented it.

Ruan Xian, however, heard the music tuned to Xun’s pipes and deemed it excessively refined, not the sound of a flourishing state. After his death, someone unearthed a bronze *chi* from the ground, its length matching Xun’s measure—four and a half parts of the ancient *chi*. Given Ruan Xian’s expertise in music, the measure was reinstated as the "official *chi*," and the Ministry of Agriculture subsequently used it to standardize the five-*chi* measure and construct measuring vessels based on accumulated *cun*. During the Yuanjia era of the Liu-Song, the Grand General, Prince Pengcheng of the Imperial Clan, sought to enlarge objects and added half a *cun* to the official *chi*. The people adopted this measure, and it persists today as the "Imperial Workshops’ *chi*." The *chi* used by the Imperial Household, the Bureau of Waterways, and the Materials Office is one *fen* longer than the common measure. If one infers from these examples, the ancient *chi* would be...

The harmonies of pitch pipes and the five notes resonate naturally, aligning with the numinous and the unseen. During the Zhou era, two true masters of swordcraft, alongside Xun Xu and Zhang Hua, exhausted the utmost refinement in their work. Contemporaries such as Shu Xi and Lei Huan mastered the divine and the spectral. Though Ruan Xian excelled in music, his nature was unrestrained and eccentric, lacking precision—thus favoring the simple and slow. The unearthed bronze *chi* was likely a relic from the Later Han.

In the fourth year of Tianjian of the Liang (505 CE), the *chi* was recalibrated to rectify pitch pipes, adopting half a *fen* of Zhang and Xun’s ancient *chi*. This measure proved fitting and was implemented as the "standard *chi*."

It is further said: For those who wish to conceal themselves in famous mountains, observe transformations with the times, and, without seeking official transcendence, find contentment in reclusion, one should cultivate the Dao of sword-and-corpse liberation. Inscribe the *Quchen Feijing* script on both sides of the blade, first feigning illness as a pretext. Then, clutching the sword, depart outwardly—this is called "first falsely claiming illness." After resting outside for several days, secretly remove the sword from its green silk bag, draw it, and inscribe the talismanic characters and strike the tally. Once complete, hold the sword and recite the invocation, summoning the Heavenly Steed to arrive. Shed your garments and depart, ensuring no one perceives your transformation.

Other methods include stealthily applying the *Feijing* elixir to the sword’s ring and calling the sword’s name. After the invocation, the Great One will suddenly appear with the Heavenly Steed to welcome you before your dwelling. Mount the steed—if a woman, a curtained carriage will arrive. Since ancient times, transcendents have often used substitute objects: some employ bamboo staffs, others headscarves or shoes. Only Bao Jing utilized the *Taiqing* sword method. Such divine transformations are fleeting and illusory, assuming forms by coincidence, beyond rational explanation—truly wondrous.

The Heavenly Steed is the beast *Jiguang Teng Huang*. Ancient paintings and diagrams depict its form, passed down by former transcendents. *Jiguang* resembles a deer, *Teng Huang* a horse. Men ride singly, while women are conveyed in carriages. The Perfected of the Great Ultimate commands the Messenger of the Great One to lead the steed and hold the reins, presenting precious garments. They arrive in an instant, inexplicably.

The Great One presides over the transformations of transcendence. When the steed departs, though physicians and attendants surround the sickbed and descendants crowd the room, you may change attire, gird the sword, and vanish without detection—your actions now transformed. This is what is meant by "liberation through the three luminaries, lingering in the essence of the moon, breathing myriad changes, no longer in your former form."

It is also said: For the highest-grade liberation talismans, inscribe the *Feijing* script on paper and enclose it in a purple bag.

When you wish to depart, fasten the sword’s ring, conceal the *Lingjing* talisman inscribed in flying script on paper, and store it in a crimson bag. When you wish to depart, attach it to the sword’s scabbard. Many immortals use bamboo staffs, and not all necessarily master the sword method. Some may rely on Great Clarity techniques, employing objects for transformation—these cannot be sought in a single category.

It is also said: Those who practice the lesser *shijie* (corpse liberation) may never again gaze upon their homeland. The Way of the higher liberation is called "Matching the Purple Slip"; the Three Bureaus may no longer spy upon their dwelling. Simply keep the spirit-sword by your side in all daily activities. After thirteen years, you will naturally transform your form, without needing to rely on medicinal writings. If you cannot discern how to prepare the elixir, after seven years, merely inscribing the sword with cinnabar script will allow you to dissolve in concealment. Practicing this method alone, however, may still prevent you from returning to your homeland.

This falls short of the wondrous subtleties of *Quchen*, the swift conveyance of *Jiguang* and *Teng Huang*. Yet even in its singularity, it surpasses the miscellaneous methods of Great Clarity, enabling reshaping, refinement, and transformation, and allowing you to roam and feast in the Great Ultimate. Those who achieve *shijie* through

The *Taixiao Jing* states: "Those who practice the Great Dao are called *daoshi*." It further explains: "They devote themselves to the Dao, hence the title." During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, the Perfected One Yin Gui established the Louguan retreat, summoning reclusive worthies and appointing them as *daoshi*. When King Ping relocated the capital to Luoyi, he established seven *daoshi*. In the Yongping era of Emperor Ming of Han, twenty-one were appointed. Emperor Wu of Wei erected altars across the Nine Provinces and ordained thirty-five. When Emperor Wen of Wei visited Yong, he paid homage to Master Chen Chi and established fifty *daoshi*. Emperor Hui of Jin ordained forty-nine, granting them three hundred households.

The *Zhen’gao* records: Liu Xu, styled Zixiang, was a man of the Later Han. Born into wealth in Yingchuan, he aided the poor and served as governor of Chenliu. Later, he resigned his post and entered the mountains to become a *daoshi*. It also states: Chunyu Shen, styled Shuyi, was a native of Kuaiji. During the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, he served as a county magistrate before entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Further: Liu Kuan, styled Wenrao, was a prefect of Nanyang in the Later Han. At seventy-three, he entered Mount Hua and ingested cinnabar-dates. And: Wang Lang, styled Faming, was a native of Taiyuan. He entered Mount Mao and studied under Tao Hongjing. He transformed on the fourteenth day of the first month in the third year of the Datong era of Liang. Hongjing composed an inscription for him, offering libations with these words: "Crown and sash bring no glory; jade pendants are not treasures. A journey of ten thousand *li* in search of truth seals this inner embrace."

It further states: Tao Hongjing’s father, Tao Zhenbao, was eloquent and learned, skilled in cursive script, archery, and medicinal arts. Tao Hongjing himself excelled in clerical script, developing a distinct style though emulating Wang Xizhi. His essays and letters were highly esteemed. And: Sun Tao, styled Wencang, was a native of Shan in Kuaiji. He entered the mountains to study under Pan Siming, receiving the true methods and mastering calligraphy to a profound degree. Later, he studied Wang Xizhi’s script, imbuing it with deep meaning, and was celebrated in his time. The great stele of Nandong and the altar stele of Magistrate Xu were both his work. Tao Hongjing personally inscribed sutras and held secret oral instructions, which few disciples ever saw. Only Sun Tao and Huan Kaili, styled Kai, received them.

It also states: Zhu Zhong once sold pearls in Kuaiji during the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Han. He left a plain-text book with a woman named Ji while drinking wine. Ji secretly copied it and learned his arts. Further: *Daoshi* avoid attending funerals to preserve their spirit and prevent qi from dissipating. Thus, they withdraw from worldly service to preserve their essence. Though they fear harm to parents or teachers and must attend their funerals, such grief does no true injury.

The *Baopuzi* records: Xue Lü, styled Jihe, was a native of Yandai. During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he studied the Dao north of the Zhong River. He failed seven trials due to indulgence and obstinacy. And: Guo Wenju, a native of Chaoxian in Henan, entered Mount Luhun to cultivate the Dao. Alone, he achieved a state beyond emotion and desire. And: During the reign of Emperor Da of Wu, a man named Li A from Shu lived in a cave without eating. He was seen for generations and called the "Eight-Hundred-Year-Old Elder." People sought his counsel, but Li A never spoke—only his countenance revealed answers. If he appeared joyful, the matter was auspicious; if sorrowful, ominous; if smiling, great fortune; if sighing, deep concern. His judgments were never wrong. One day, he suddenly vanished, and none knew his whereabouts.

And it is said: Fan Lingzi, from youth devoted to the immortal Dao, thus for many years. Later, he met Sima Jizhu, and together they entered the Chang Mountains. After seven years, they entered a stone chamber to the north. At its eastern corner stood a stone urn, or perhaps a stone window. Jizhu went out on a journey and earnestly warned him, saying: "Take care not to open it." Lingzi suddenly opened and looked inside. When Jizhu returned, he sent him away. Later, he summoned Lingzi again and had him guard a bronze coffer, once more warning him not to open it. Lingzi again opened it, and Jizhu then sent him away, so that he never attained the Dao.

And it is said: Feng Liang, a native of Nanyang. In his youth, he served as a county clerk, and at thirty became an assistant to the commandant and scribe. When sent to welcome the supervising inspector, he felt ashamed of his lack of ambition. He smashed his carriage, slaughtered his ox, tore and ruined his robes and cap, and left to study the *Book of Songs*, the *Commentaries*, the *Rites*, and the *Book of Changes* under a teacher. He also learned the Dao, divination, and the arts of observation. After fifteen years, he returned. The province and commandery honored him with appointments, but he declined. An imperial edict specially summoned him as a worthy and eminent candidate. Halfway there, he abandoned the journey and returned home. At sixty-seven, he fled the world, crossed eight mountains to the east, and dwelled in the Deer-Track Grotto.

It is further said: Anqiu Wangzhi, styled Zhongdu, was a native of Changling in Jingzhao. He cultivated and revered the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Emperor Cheng of Han esteemed his virtue and power, often treating him as his master, yet Wangzhi humbly withdrew further. When the emperor summoned him, if Wangzhi was performing a liturgical rite, he would wait until the ceremony concluded before attending. The *Laozi Zhangju* preserves the scholarship of Anqiu, and when Wangzhi suddenly fell gravely ill, his disciple Gongsha Duyu stood beneath a garden tree. Wangzhi then awoke, fully recovered. It being winter, he detected the fragrance of plums; opening his eyes, he saw two crimson plums hanging on a withered branch. Wangzhi reached up to receive them, and the plums fell into his palm. After eating them, his afflictions vanished entirely, his body grew light, and his vision clear. He then departed, and none knew his whereabouts.

The *Daoist Biographies* states: Yan Ji, styled Zhongwei, lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. From youth, he cherished the Dao and virtue, refusing office to wander among famous mountains. Later, he dwelled on Mount Wudang, resting without fixed abode—sometimes amid piled stones, sometimes leaning against great trees. His attire remained unchanged through the four seasons. He often wore his hair loose, though sometimes bound it with a silk headcloth.

It is further said: Bao Jing, styled Taixuan, was a native of Shangdang. A descendant of Bao Xuan, the Han dynasty inspector, he was by nature pure and wise, mastering the classics and histories. He cultivated himself and nurtured his nature, moving with such restraint that he never gave offense. Upon hearing of others’ faults, he reacted as if they had violated his family taboos. Many sought his instruction, and as he propagated the Dao and transformed beings, he was called the "Forest of Confucians."

It is further said: Wang Jia, styled Zinian, was a native of Longxi. He dwelled in a cave hewn into the cliffs of Dongyang Valley, his disciples numbering in the hundreds, each living in their own grotto. Though his appearance was coarse and unremarkable, he was keenly perceptive and witty. When asked about worldly affairs—good or ill—he never spoke plainly, yet his oblique answers often proved accurate.

It is further said: Yan Zun, styled Junping, was a native of Shu Commandery. He cultivated the Dao for self-preservation. When speaking to another’s son, he discoursed on filial piety; to a minister, on loyalty; to a younger brother, on deference—always seizing the moment to guide them toward goodness.

It is further said: Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, often descended to the home of Cai Jing. In an instant, Ma Gu arrived, her retinue half the size of Fangping’s.

Ma Gu’s fingernails were like those of a raven. Cai Jing thought to himself: *When my back itches, it would be fine indeed to have them scratch it.* Fangping said, “The Lady is a divine being—how can you entertain such thoughts?” He then had Jing flogged.

Jing wished to study the Dao under Fangping. Fangping made him stand with his back turned, then observed him from behind and said, “Your heart is crooked; you cannot be taught the immortal’s Dao.” Instead, he imparted to him the arts of transcending the world.

It is further said: Yu Chengxian, styled Chongguang, was a native of Yingchuan. Well-versed in the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, he secluded himself at Whitewater Terrace in Wenjiang County. There he built a hut and lecture hall, where Confucians, Buddhists, and Daoists alike received his teachings. Later, he withdrew to the south of the Yangtze, declining repeated imperial summons. Eventually, he began lecturing on the *Daode jing* in Shixing, dissecting its knotty passages.

It is further said: Xue Yubao, styled Yanshi, was a native of Peiguo. During the Liang dynasty, he studied under Master Xuanpu, who admired his literary talent. Skilled in calligraphy, he once inscribed a passage on the wall of the Daoist Rectification Office in Chongling Abbey—all who saw it marveled at its excellence.

It is further said: Dongxiang Zong, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. Once, while performing a ritual on an open-air altar, the incense in his casket was spent, yet it spontaneously refilled. Again, though no fire burned in his censer, fragrant smoke arose of its own, curling and suffusing the air without cease.

It is further said: Zhang Yu, a twelfth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master, established Zhaozhen Abbey and cultivated the fruits of renown, exhausting the mountain’s secluded charms. Emperor Jianwen of Liang composed an inscription for its stele.

It is further said: Qian Miaozhen of Jinling attained the Dao at Maoshan’s Wukou Grotto, and her disciples erected a stele for her on Maoshan. Prince Shaoling wrote a preface for the abbey, which remains extant today.

It is further said: In the second year of the Tianjian reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, offices for Greater and Lesser Dao Rectifiers were established. Meng Jingyi of Pingchang, styled Daofu, served as the Greater Rectifier at the time and frequently expounded the Dao for the state. In the fourth year, Prince Jian’an, Wei, inquired from his seat: “The Daoist scriptures and teachings impose strict prohibitions. The two chapters of *Laozi* are transmitted only after oaths and pledges—could it be that the intent of the ancient sages was not meant for ordinary discourse?” Jingyi replied: “To revere secrecy and uphold strict disciplines is the wondrous transformation of the orthodox tradition. Principle lies in mutual completion; affairs do not contravene one another.”

It is further said: Liu Faxian was a native of Pengcheng. At the time, Gu Huan had written *Exegeses on the Daoist Scriptures* for Kong Dezhang, offering many affirmations and refutations. Faxian sent him a letter to debate their points of agreement and divergence. Gu, yielding to the Dao, then inscribed: “I am but a remnant madman of antiquity, heedless of water or fire. Having received your admonition, I now begin to awaken. My past ravings are unworthy of further reproach.”

It is further stated: Whenever Faxian witnessed disputes between Daoist and Buddhist adherents, he composed the *Treatise on Quelling Contention*. Gu Huan, in turn, wrote the *Debate on Barbarian and Chinese Ways*. At times addressing the three teachings, he elucidated the similarities and differences between Buddhism and Daoism.

It is also said: Zhang Tan, a native of Jiaxing in Wu Commandery, was adept in profound discourse. He frequently expounded the *Laozi*, cultivated the supreme Dao, and studied the highest scriptures. People gathered from afar to attend his lectures. Tan sought true esoterica and deeply understood the orthodox tradition.

It is further said: Chen Jingshang, a man of Wu, excelled in recitation and was unmatched among both Daoist and Buddhist practitioners. He composed the *Scripture of Numinous Writ*, which circulated widely in the world. The Prince of Shaoling of Liang held him in great esteem, summoning Jingshang to accompany him to Ying. Jingshang eventually passed away in Jiangxia.

It is also said: Huan Kai, styled Yinshu, was a native of Dantu in Donghai. At the beginning of the Liang dynasty, three ancient lacquered bamboo containers were discovered on a sandy islet of Kunlun Mountain. Within them were yellow silk scrolls transcribing the three sections of the *Scripture of Great Peace* revealed by Lord Qian. The villagers, astonished by the scripture’s origins, reverently enshrined it and first presented it to Tao Yinju. Yinju declared: “This is the authentic ancient text of Lord Qian.” Upon hearing that the scripture was to be brought to the capital, he fell gravely ill with malaria, unresponsive to all treatments. Tao Yinju remarked: “This affliction is not of my doing. I fear the fault lies in taking the scripture away. Why not return it to its original place?” They complied, and after the scripture was sent back within two days, he recovered.

It is further said: Cao Bao, styled Shizhen, was a native of Danyang. Skilled in performing the *Step of Emptiness*, his frost-white hair and distinguished bearing surpassed all others. Those who encountered him on his travels universally praised him.

It is also said: Yan Zhiming, styled Huishi, was a native of Jinling. By nature, he possessed a fine voice, and from childhood, he excelled in recitation and chanting. When Emperor Ming was ill, he often summoned the Daoist assembly to the inner palace to perform the *Way-circling* ritual. Upon hearing Zhiming chant the scriptures, the emperor was deeply pleased, saying his illness had been alleviated. After the ritual concluded and Zhiming withdrew, the emperor, restless in the dead of night, urgently summoned him to recite before the throne. At once, he felt joy and relief.

It is further said: Xu Shizi, styled Dewei, was a native of Donghai. When Emperor Wu of Chen established the Zongling Grand Abbey, he appointed Dewei as its abbot. After Dewei’s passing, Emperor Wen reproached the officials responsible for funerary provisions and personally oversaw his burial.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: Yan Jizhi, styled Jingchu, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. A Daoist priest, he served his parents with utmost filial piety. Residing at Shizhu Abbey, he dared not leave his aged mother. Instead, he welcomed her to the abbey, building a small dwelling nearby to attend to her needs. After his mother’s death, he mourned to the point of emaciation beyond ritual propriety, earning the admiration of those who knew him.

It is also said: Du Xi, styled Fanghui, was a native of Jinxiang in Gaoping and served as General of Pacification for Jin. His heart inclined toward the Daoist teachings, which he secretly practiced. Skilled in clerical script, his calligraphy rivaled that of the Right Army.

He personally transcribed Daoist scriptures by hand, amassing nearly a hundred scrolls, many of which survive to this day.

It is also said: Zhang Xiaoxiu, admiring Wang Yuan’gui’s exquisite calligraphy, repeatedly invited him to visit. Yet Yuan’gui, enamored of springs and rocks, spent his days playing the zither, whistling, and chanting, never once taking up his brush. Only upon departing did he write a few lines in running script. Xiaoxiu, ever respectful, dared not press further. Traces of his calligraphy remain in the Abbot’s Hall of the Jianji Abbey.

It is also said: Xu Sigong was the younger brother of Xu Yuanyou. From birth, he was drawn to the Dao, renowned for his refined and scholarly demeanor. Emperor Jianwen of Jin counted him among his transcendent friends.

It is also said: Ren Dunshang, a native of Bochang, during the Yongjia era, attended a Daoist lecture on Mount Mao and gathered with the assembly. Dunshang sighed in secret: “Though many claim to admire goodness, their devotion is but superficial. I have yet to meet one whose heart is true enough to cleave metal.”

It is also said: Lu Na, Minister of Works during the Jin dynasty, fell ill with sores at the age of forty. He told Du Gong: “In every generation, those who die young suffer from these sores at life’s end.” Gong submitted a memorial on his behalf and presented him with *Cloud-Flying Powder*, saying: “Your destiny extends to seventy.” The prediction proved true. When the Right Army General Wang fell ill, he summoned Gong. Gong remarked to his disciples: “If the Right Army’s illness does not improve, what need has he of me?” Ten days later, Wang indeed passed away.

It is also said: Jiang Fuchu, a native of Yixing, shared a transcendent friendship with Xue Biao of Jinling. Coming and going on Mount Mao, he harbored aspirations of ultimate commitment. During the Yongming era of the Qi, he briefly descended to the capital, where Tao Hongjing, upon their first meeting, recognized their profound affinity. Later, when Tao resigned his office and built a hermitage in the central peaks of Mount Mao, he invited Fuchu to cross the ridge and join him in studying scriptures, medicinal arts, and alchemy, often engaging in discourse together.

It is also said: Yang Chao, styled Chaoyuan, was a native of Donghai. He served Tao Hongjing, accompanying him on his journeys and debating with him, earning the privilege of being counted among his closest disciples.

It is also said: Zhu Huikai, styled Zhiyuan, was a native of Wucheng in Wuxing. He devoted himself to precepts and self-cultivation, making relief and salvation his duty. In the eighth year of the Daming era of the Qi, when famine struck the land, Huikai distributed all his stored grain to the needy, and his village relied on him for survival. Three starving men, having gorged themselves, died of overeating. Their families sued the county, accusing Huikai of feeding the hungry to death and slandering him bitterly. The magistrate laughed and said: “To die from overeating after begging for food, then blame the host—there is no law for such a case.” He dismissed the matter without further inquiry.

It is also said: Pu Yang, of unknown origin, was wholly devoted to the Dao, and his prayers were always efficacious. When Zheng Xianyin’s daughter was lame, Yang treated her, and she soon recovered. When Emperor Jianwen of Jin deposed his heir and had no successor, he sent someone to pray to Yang. That very night, a yellow vapor arose from the southwest and descended into the palace chambers. At that time, Empress Li conceived Xiaowu.

It is also said: Xu Mai, styled Shu’xuan, was originally named Ying and later changed his name to Yuanyou. Resolved to seek the Dao of immortality, he entered the western mountains of Lin’an and did not return for months, nor did anyone know his whereabouts. He had previously married the daughter of Sun Hong, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary of Wu Commandery. While dwelling in the mountains of Lin’an, he wrote a letter to dismiss his wife, saying: “I long to hear the resounding thunder and the cries of mountain birds, to compose for myself the *Nine Songs of Shao* upon the flute—yet I cannot bear it. Beneath the verdant canopy, dwelling in a cavern’s chamber, I find a palace or vast hall cannot surpass this. My heart’s desire is to end my days here; my resolve is fixed upon this place. I must depart—this is our eternal farewell.”

Chu Boyu, styled Yuanqu, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery. From an early age, he admired the Dao of emptiness and detachment. At eighteen, when his father arranged a marriage for him, he entered through the front gate only to depart through the rear, making his way to Mount Kuaiji, where he dwelled on Waterfall Mountain. His nature was such that he endured both cold and heat, remaining in the mountains for over thirty years, utterly cut off from human affairs.

Another account states: Boyu first traveled to Mount Heng in the south, then journeyed into Min, where rushing torrents and perilous paths awaited. One evening, as he moored his boat by the river’s edge, a sudden gale arose, and the mountain waters surged violently, hurling his vessel to the summit before it crashed down a sheer cliff. His companions, believing him crushed like ice, searched in vain—only to find Boyu composed, guiding the boat with a small staff across unfathomable depths. The people of Wu were struck with awe and reverence. He later departed for Mount Huo.

Initially secluded on Waterfall Mountain, Emperor Gaozu of the Qi Dynasty admired his character and wished to meet him. Boyu declined, pleading illness, and departed. The emperor later regretted this, and by imperial decree, the Taiping Abbey was established at the foot of Waterfall Mountain, with Kong Zhigui erecting a stele in commemoration.

Zhang Ling was broadly learned, mastering the celestial patterns of the Yellow and Luo Rivers in all their subtlety. Dwelling in quietude beneath his humble gate, he sought neither fame nor advancement. He played the zither, chanted poetry, and followed his inclinations—nothing more.

The Venerable Dragon Might was a mountain-dwelling adept of the Dao. No one knew his true name; he was simply called the Recluse of the Mountains. Aloof and unyielding, he stood apart from the world of men.

Tao Hongjing, styled Daoming, was a native of Pingyang in Wei Commandery. He styled himself the Recluse of Huayang and often said to others: “My mind is ever like a mirror suspended—nothing that touches it escapes reflection.” He delighted in performing hidden acts of virtue, aiding the distressed and impoverished, and compounding medicines upon which both near and far depended. He never slept during the day and read until midnight without fail. Fond of the sound of wind in the pines, he abstained from rich and fatty foods. In his later years, he consumed only water shield, laver, and raw ginger, and though he could drink a *dou* of wine, he never became intoxicated.

*The Sacred Records of the Old Master* states: The divine physician and immortal of Mount Song, Cheng Gongyu, ascended to the Dao on the sixth day of the seventh month in the fifteenth year of the reign of Yao Hong of the Jin. His disciples wished to bury him with full honors, but Cheng suddenly revived and said: “A Daoist is free of worldly burdens and differs from the common folk—why mourn and bury me with such extravagance? Simply perform the rites of purification and offering; this accords with the ancient ways of the pure and true.” With these words, he departed. The next day at noon, someone knocked at the stone chamber. When the disciples opened the door, they saw two youths leading them inside, where Cheng rose and departed with them. He was buried in the Pure and Plain Hamlet of Gong County.

Meng Daoyang, styled Xiaoyuan and also known as Yuan, was a native of Pingchang. In his youth, whenever he heard of a gathering to expound the Dao, he would travel great distances to attend, regardless of the journey. As he grew older, his nature became serene and inward, his studies pursued for his own sake, not for recognition. He shut his door, opened his window, and pored over ancient texts. When he entered his chamber to read aloud, his voice barely escaped the room—yet when Liu Huan and Dai Shuo visited to discuss the profound principles of the Dao, they marveled and deferred to him, acknowledging his surpassing insight.

Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, was a native of Yuzhang. His nature was one of pure filial devotion: on summer nights, when at his parents’ side, he dared not swat away mosquitoes or gnats, fearing they would leave him only to alight upon them. At thirty, a man of the village, Ding Yishi, who followed the Dao, transmitted his arts to him. When the villagers of Yintong prepared wine for him, he departed, and the wine in the vessels remained undiminished. A Daoist named Shu Daoyun suffered from malaria that year, but Meng taught him the *Three Sovereigns’ Poems* to recite, and he was instantly cured. Once, returning to Yuzhang, he drew upon the river with a white feather and crossed it. To the east of the county stood a stone bamboo shoot, which had never opened through the ages.

Wu Meng went to open it and found many bamboo slips and documents, their ancient script indecipherable. South of the county stood a towering rock, rising a thousand *ren* into the air, too sheer even for gibbons to scale, yet Meng, staff in hand, ascended it. The magistrate of the county, Xin Cai Qianqing of Xincai, was fond of hunting, and though Meng repeatedly admonished him, he would not listen. Later, when Qianqing staged a great hunt, surrounding the land with fire to scorch the sky, Meng sat calmly amid the grass, birds and beasts gathering around him, the flames unable to reach him. Qianqing was deeply shaken and repented. When Wang Dun seized Meng during a gathering, he suddenly vanished, enraging Dun. That same year, Dun met his downfall. Meng ascended Mount Lu, where he saw an old man sitting beneath a tree, offering him sweet dew in a jade cup. There were also jade chambers and golden halls, where several figures spoke with Meng as if they were old acquaintances, serving him jade nectar throughout the day. Meng then rode an iron-red steed atop Mount Lu.

It is further said: Qian Miaozhen was a native of Jinling. From childhood, she was drawn to the Dao and wished to leave the worldly life, but her family forced her into marriage. Weeping, she steadfastly refused, and so she took residence on the Greater and Lesser Mount Mao. Later, she journeyed to Wukou Cave, where she personally transcribed a letter and seven poems for Tao the Recluse.

It is further said: Kong Lingchan was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. When his mother passed away, his filial devotion became widely known. From that time on, he abstained from fine foods and rich wines.

He subsisted on gruel and vegetables, clad in plain cloth, and maintained this resolve for the rest of his life. When his father saw him emaciated from grief, he was moved with pity and ordered a meal prepared. Lingchan reluctantly obeyed his father’s command, but swallowing the food made him ill. His father, recognizing that a person’s heavenly nature could not be altered, ceased pressing him further. Lingchan delved deeply into the subtleties of the Dao and perused all the scriptures of immortality. Emperor Ming of the Song dynasty established the Huaixian Abbey beside Yu’s Cave and decreed that Lingchan reside there. He was later promoted to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness and granted the title Gentleman of the Palace. Emperor Gao bestowed upon him a deer-hide cap, a gibbon-fur robe, and bamboo vessels of purity, with a handwritten edict that read: *"You possess the bearing of the ancients; I grant you the attire of a recluse. On the day of your ascent or voyage, I shall remember you."*

It is further said: Zhang Yi, styled Shihe, was a native of Wu Commandery. He encouraged his disciples, upheld the discipline of ritual affairs, and frequently expounded the sutras to assemblies, his reasoning profound and meticulous, his words refined and eloquent—revered by all in his time. Emperor Wu of Liang held him in high esteem. When Tao the Recluse composed the *Treatise on Dharma and Precepts*, clarifying the two teachings of Buddhism and Daoism, Yi engaged in repeated discussions with him, presenting well-ordered arguments, for which the Recluse praised him. Devoted entirely to the Dao and its methods, he lived in poverty yet remained steadfast, excelling in the eight styles of calligraphy and creating a unique script called "cloud seal." He composed the *Stele of the Southern Grotto of Mount Mao*, which was highly refined.

It is further said: Song Wentong, styled Wenming, was a native of Wu Commandery. During the reign of Emperor Jianwen of Liang, Wenming, having elucidated all the Daoist scriptures, compiled the *Commentary on the Meaning of the Lingbao Scriptures*, titling it *The Gateway to Understanding*. He also composed *The Great Meaning*, naming it *The Abyss of Meaning*, which scholars relied upon, and he was invited from all directions. Skilled in writing yet reticent in speech.

It is further said: Wang Suiqi, a native of Taiyuan, served as the abbot of Jizhen Abbey. By nature, he slept little; even when deeply asleep, he remained aware of others’ conversations. If discussions touched upon relevant matters, he would grasp their words at once, and all marveled at his clarity and wakefulness.

It is further said: By day and night without ceasing, the sun and moon merge their light.

**The Eight Boundaries of the Daoist Canon**  
**Section Nine: Fasting and Purification**

The *Scripture of the Most High* states: Contemplating the spirits, recording the qi, practicing the methods, and ascending the steps—these are called purification. The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: No purification surpasses that of the *Lingbao*; its methods are lofty and wondrous, not proclaimed to the world. The oral instructions of immortals and sages are secret and unwritten. The purification rites of the Great One are profound beyond profundity.

The *Scripture of Guidance* states: To follow the Dao without purification is like walking at night without a torch—one strays from the Way and suffers needlessly. The *Canons of the Great Perfection* states: The purification of the Three and the Guarding of the One form the foundation; the study of the Dao takes purification as its root. What the Most High values, what the Old Master cultivates, and what the immortals and perfected rely upon.

It is further said: If a Daoist can eat but once at midday, avoiding all that is foul and impure, and observe purification in accordance with the lunar cycle, ceaselessly by day and night, harming nothing—delivering even worms and flies—then the supreme Dao shall be attained.

It is further said: When Daoists study the scriptures and practice their arts, they must first take up the two chapters of the *Dao and Virtue*, receiving them through purification to deliver others and save themselves.

It is further said: To relieve the illnesses of one’s parents, one must purify in the open-air terrace of the abbey. During purification, present the *Midday and Midnight Petitions*; sincerity will surely move the spirits.

It is further said: The Dao of the Jade Emperor of Mysterious Clarity was first transmitted by the August Emperor of the Highest Heaven to the Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, the Three Origins Lords of Purple Essence, and the Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang. Later, it was passed to the Most High Lord of the Dao, who conveyed it to Lord Li of the Golden Watchtower. Lord Li transmitted it to the Perfected of Great Spirit, the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, and the Lady of Purple Origin, who in turn passed it to Lord Wang of Pure Spirit. Lord Wang transmitted it to the Lady Wei of Southern Marchmount, who conveyed it to Lord Yang, instructing him to bestow it upon Director Xu and his disciples. Those receiving it must purify for seven days.

It is further said: When the host of perfected transmit the Dao, one must first purify for a hundred days, or thirty days, or ten days. One must also announce the purification a day in advance to cleanse the pure heart. Among the scriptures sought through six transmissions over three thousand years, none surpass this in purification. Practicing it for fourteen years, the Most High shall welcome one with a jade carriage, ascending to the Highest Clarity as a perfected being.

The *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* states: In all purification, three matters are addressed to settle the deeds of heart, mouth, and body. It is further said: In all purification, one recites and studies the primordial registers and the great scriptures, wearing the inner texts to perfect the Dao. It is further said: In all purification, one wears the inner texts of the Three Sovereigns to perfect the Dao of concealment and manifestation.

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states: The Daoist purification is called "guarding stillness," meaning to settle the heart in purification, purify the body in cleanliness, and still the spirit while dismissing affairs—this is the purification of the inner heart that separates inner and outer. It is further said: Those who cultivate the Dao must purify and offer rites to atone for the transgressions of seven generations.

It is further said: The Highest Clarity gathers the Five Perfected on auspicious days. All who cultivate the Dao should, on such days, contemplate virtuous deeds in their hearts, aspiring to become flying immortals, establish virtue, bestow favors, and relieve the destitute—these are the affairs of the Most High. One must purify, dismiss all distracting thoughts, and seclude oneself in a quiet chamber.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: Purification must not be practiced in mixed company, for it will surely disrupt the true Dao. On days of *jiayin* and *gengshen*, when corpse-ghosts vie in chaos and the spirit is restless and defiled, one must purify without sleep, dismissing all desires. On the five *mao* days, one should always purify, enter the chamber facing east, and bow in the heart while visualizing the qi, expressing one’s intentions as desired.

It is further said: During the *Jian’an* era of the Han, Zuo Ci heard that Mount Juqu in Jinnling connected to Mount Emei and Mount Luofu, so he crossed the river to seek it. After purifying for three months, he ascended the mountain and found its gate. Lord Mao bestowed upon him three kinds of divine mushrooms, along with the nocturnal liturgy, saying: "Fragrant maidens bearing incense shall descend to protect those who purify."

It is further said: The Perfected of the Great Ultimate received the oral instructions of the Most High. After five transmissions over a thousand years, following the rules of the hidden texts, one must purify for five days before receiving the covenant.

The *Pearl Satchel* states: When entering the Five Marchmounts, one must bathe on the first *jiazi* day of the month, purify for seven days, and then proceed. If the sacred mountains bear divine mushrooms or rare herbs, one must present a plain memorial in cinnabar script. Its words should petition for ascension as an immortal, deliverance from the world, and flight to the Highest Clarity, bowing twice. Release a rooster and a dog upon a stone and depart; then seek the divine mushrooms and rare herbs, and all desires shall be fulfilled. Evil ghosts and ancient specters shall not dare to test one. Those who study the Dao yet know not this protection will encounter many calamities in the mountains.

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* states: If a household possesses the *Charts of the Three Sovereigns*, one must first purify for a hundred days before summoning the spirits of heaven, earth, the Five Marchmounts, and the altars of soil and grain. Later, the sagely lords commanded the Perfected of Lesser Clarity to compile the *Records of the Upper Perfected*, collectively titled *The True Canon of the Highest Perfected*, to subdue all demons. It is transmitted to others once every hundred years, and one must purify to receive it.

The *Scripture of the Three Origins* states: The foundation of studying the Dao lies first in cultivating the Middle Origin. The methods of purification atone for sins and repent transgressions before the Great Perfected, inscribing one’s name in the *Mysterious Chart*.

The *Red Writ of Lingbao* states: The Five Elders, the Emperors of the Heavens, and the August Thearchs gather in the six purification months of the year at the Numinous Capital Palace of the Three Upper Heavens, upon the Terrace of Primordial Yang in the Purple Tenuity, to calculate the celestial origins and examine the movements of destiny. It is further said: The old statutes of the Purple Tenuity Palace are written in cinnabar on white silk; one must purify for a hundred days to recite them.

The *Scripture of the Jade Register of Great Simplicity* states: Through purification, visualization, and recitation of this scripture with unceasing diligence, one shall attain spiritual penetration and wisdom, becoming a Perfected of Great Simplicity.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: The Perfected say: The human spirit constantly dwells in empty and tranquil places, not in filth and turbidity. Those who wish to recall the spirit must purify in a fragrant chamber, and all illnesses shall vanish. Without purification, the spirit will not return to the person. All shall be reported to heaven, which is why human illnesses accumulate and the dead never cease.

The *Scripture of the Eight Simplicities Racing Through the Heavens* states: Observe the Seven Luminaries and Five Planets, discerning their forms and colors, noting their early or late appearances while awaiting them in the courtyard. On dark and overcast evenings, visualize them within the bedchamber, maintaining purification and cultivation as in the method of visualizing the racing sun and moon. The crimson qi with purple rays at midday is the radiant splendor of the Nine Spirits of the Luminous Effulgence. The yellow qi and white light within the moon, with the eightfold brilliance of clarity, are the nocturnal essence of the Moon’s Splendor, known to all Daoists. By absorbing the qi of the sun and moon and drawing in the ninefold radiant effulgence, one may cultivate the Way of visualizing the racing sun and moon. The Mystic Consort bestowed upon Lord Yang two scrolls of wondrous methods. The Way of the sun and moon is profoundly lofty and subtle.

The *Numinous Writ of the Golden Portals of Supreme Clarity* states: The Auspicious Assembly Day of the Most High is the day when the Perfected of the Highest Realm gather to celebrate and offer tribute. The Day of Returning to the Origin is the day of the Most High’s renewal. The *jiazi* day marks the inception of yin and yang’s primordial qi, and the lunar dark-moon phase heralds its transformation. It is the dawn of a new day. Those who do not know this day may neither absolve sins nor engrave bamboo slips. The Perfected must purify and fast, visualizing auspicious matters on this day—this is the method of Returning to the Origin.

It further states: The *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* is also called the *Writ of the Zither-Heart of the Most High* and the *Golden Book of the Great Emperor’s Supporting Leaves*. The courtiers of the Great Emperor’s palace recite this scripture in its entirety. It is inscribed on golden tablets, hence called the *Golden Writ*, and is also known as the *Jade Chapters of the Eastern Flower*. The Eastern Flower is the name of the Palace of the Square Cauldron, the abode of the Blue Lad of the Eastern Sea. Within it, the immortals’ courts often purify, fast, recite, and chant, inscribing jade tablets.

It further states: The *Verses of the Left Perfected of the Great Ultimate on the Mysteries of the Curved Simplicity* is also called the *Mysterious Mound Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi*. The Most High bestowed it upon the Left Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who transmitted it to the Palace of the Square Cauldron in the Eastern Sea. The Blue Lad, Great Lord, commanded that it be passed to Daoists of predestined fame who are destined to become Perfected Immortals. After wearing it for twenty years, one may behold the Three Primordial Lords and fast by the oath of azure gold, replacing the covenant of alliance.

The *Secret Words of the Eight Ways* states: Those who wish to practice the method of the Nine Perfected must purify and fast in a quiet chamber, focusing their minds in solemn prayer to ascend as flying immortals to the Purple Court. It further states: The Phoenix Qi of the Nine Heavens, the Writ of the Mysterious Mound, the Elder of the Dark Capital, and the immortal statutes of transmission and wearing—after purifying and fasting for three days, those who wear it attain immortality.

The *Preface and Methods of the Scripture of the Way and Virtue* states: Yin Xi, perceiving the purple qi advancing westward, purified and fasted in anticipation of beholding the True Dao. When Laozi crossed the pass, he bestowed the two-chapter scripture upon him.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writ* states: The Ten Divisions of Wondrous Scriptures, inscribed in gold on jade tablets, are recited by the Perfected Immortals of all heavens who purify and fast, ascending on appointed days to the Jade Capital to chant their texts.

The *Scripture of Dignified Conduct* states: Purification and fasting bring luminous blessings; to deliver others, one must act before oneself, aligning with the will of the Mysterious. Another version of the daily practice states that those who receive the *Red Writ of the Numinous Treasure* must first purify and fast.

The *Scripture of the Eastern Minister of Destiny* states: The former master, Lord Wang, was once bestowed the *Upper Scripture of the Mysterious and True of the Hall of Light* by the Most High. He purified, fasted, and stilled his roots, visualizing the sun and moon while swallowing the fluid of their radiant effulgences. Practicing this in secret is the Way of the Highest Perfected. The *Scripture of the Mysterious and True of the Most High* requires a prior covenant before practice, and only after practice may one hear of it—this is the Way of jade pendants and golden earrings. In the past, Ji Wei maintained purification for three years, devoting himself to reverent contemplation before attaining it. His body radiated divine light before he received the scripture—this is the true and essential Way of the Mysterious, concise yet not cumbersome. I have long treasured and concealed it within my sleeve, sharing it only with those who guard its secrecy.

Those who seek the divine mountains should first purify and fast before ascending. In the past, Zuo Ci purified and fasted for three months, paying homage to the numinous mountain. After three years of utmost sincerity, the Two Lords of Mount Mao led him forward.

It further states: The *Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* records that the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang commanded the Spirit King of Yang Valley to transmit it to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, with nine days of purification and fasting for its transmission.

It further states: The *Scripture of the Three Primordials and the True One*, guarded by the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, was transmitted by the Little Lad of the Eastern Sea to Master Hua, who passed it to Master Su, who then transmitted it to Lord Zhou. The transmission required purification for a hundred days, or fifty, thirty, or seven days. One person was transmitted to every forty years, with a total of ten recipients. Later, the Sage Dao Lord commanded the King of Pure Numinosity of the Lesser Existence Heaven to compile the comprehensive register of the Upper Perfected Immortals. The Lady of Purple Primordiality transmitted it to Lord Wang, who passed it to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, Wei, who transmitted it to Lord Yang, who then passed it to Xu Yuan, with three or seven days of purification and fasting for its transmission. The *Writ of the Phoenix Perfected* was bestowed by the Most High upon the Left Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who transmitted it to the Lord of the Square Cauldron of the Eastern Sea and the Blue Lad. This, too, was passed among the Perfected, with three days of purification and fasting for its transmission. After wearing it for nine years, one may behold the Two Primordial Lords in the Golden Portals of Supreme Clarity.

It further states: The *Scripture of the Wisdom of the Most High* was entrusted to the Upper Minister by the Most High. The Lady of Purple Primordiality transmitted it to Lord Wang, who passed it to the Southern Perfected, who then transmitted it to Lord Yang. It is now bestowed upon Director Xu Yuan, with fifty days of purification and fasting for its transmission.

It further states: The *Hidden Writ of the Great Cinnabar on Flying to Perfection* concerns the method of visualization. Lord Yang merely copied one scripture to recite and share with the Director. It is also the *Dragon Writ of the Nine Perfected*, but without the method of purification and fasting, it cannot be practiced. The *True Sayings* contains the method of morning audience with the Great Simplicity, stating that those who receive the *Revolving Central Cavern* and visualize the *Hidden Writ of the Great Cinnabar* in the Three Primordials’ Caverns refer to this, though the details are incomplete. There was once a Lord Zhou who studied and annotated the matters of the Cavern Chambers, but it was merely an excerpt. This scripture’s language and annotations outline the method of practice, yet without the original text, its essential meaning remains incomplete.

The *Records of the Famous Mountains* states: On Great Mount Mao, there is a small cave mouth blocked by stone. Only with utmost sincerity and purification may one enter and wander within.

To the east of Mount Mao lies another small cavern, its mouth no larger than a dog’s burrow, barely wide enough for a person to enter. Yet the deeper one ventures, the more expansive it becomes. A massive boulder seals the entrance, leaving only a cup-sized aperture, guarded by the mountain spirits. This boulder occasionally shifts aside, and those who seek it with earnest purification may pass through more easily than through the common cave mouths.

Those who aspire to the Way of divine transcendence should first purify themselves through fasting and vigil. Then, the Three Lords Mao of Mount Juqu will appear to them, bestowing the essential Dao. To enter the cavern’s gate at Juqu, one must pass through five portals. Only those who maintain resolve and purification for three months may ascend and enter.

The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens* states: The Jade Aide of the Supreme Minister fasts and bears the ritual staff, attending the Great Purity.

The *Dharma Wheel Scripture* says: The Immortal Duke fasted, and before a full year had passed, the celestial perfected descended into his cold chamber. It further says: Meditate upon the true with fasting, seal the mouth, and guard the tongue.

The *Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure* declares: Without receiving the great precepts, prolonged fasting is in vain.

The *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* states: All who study the Supreme Clarity Dao must honor their lineage master and enter seclusion with fasting.

The *Supreme Statutes* says: Whenever scriptures are transmitted by a master, true officials stand guard, and fasting must precede recitation.

The *Scripture of the Feminine Unity and the Five Elders* says: One must cultivate good conduct daily, eat only at noon, and fast for a full year before receiving the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*.

The *Vermilion Register of the Supreme Lord’s Cinnabar Tablets* states: The Dao has long since drifted from the sages, and errors abound in the transmission of precepts and statutes. If doubts arise that the master cannot resolve, one may fast for a month and seek confirmation through numinous response. The divine immortals will descend and reveal the answer to the seeker.

The *Scripture of Transmission* says: In fasting, simplicity is supreme, for the spirits first reflect the body’s purity.

The *Records of the Assembled Immortals* recounts: On the Dark Garden of Kunlun, the Perfected of the Orthodox Unity appeared to one who endured hardship with fasting, reciting scriptures and revering the Dao.

The *Jade Writ of the Grand Night* says: Three books are to be established—one for permanent safeguarding, one for ritual fasting, and one for study. They should always be kept in the chamber where one resides, placed upon a separate stand. One must handle them personally, never allowing them to be mishandled. When copying scriptures, one must first fast. If the scripture contains illustrations, these may be bound separately, each with its attendant officials and keepers of the images.

The true officials, when questioned about the scriptures, say: Without a master to uphold the Dao, fasting and recitation yield no response.

The *Scripture of the Jade Pendants and Golden Girdle Ornaments* says: The assembled perfected ascend the Grand Jade Terrace after fasting for three months.

The *Scripture of Kongtong* states: The Supreme Lord of the Dao fasted upon the peaks of Luofu in the Western Jade Land of Xina. It further says: The True Person of the Great Ultimate transmitted the *Green Essence* to Lord Wang. During the transmission, they fasted for ten days. Over two thousand six hundred years, it was passed to ten individuals. The Jade Seal of Leimaiya was transmitted to Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount; they fasted for five days, and by ingesting it, one could abstain from grain and expel corpse-worms. Lord Wang traveled the world, arriving at Tortoise Mountain, where he fasted for three months. He then fasted for three years before journeying to the Great Simplicity.

Returning to Western City, he fasted for another three months. Receiving scriptures from Perfected Zhou, he had earlier encountered the Central Yellow and Old Lord wandering in Cinnabar City, where he begged for the Dao of long life and deliverance across the world. The Lord transmitted to him the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, whereupon he returned and ascended the stone chamber of Mount Chang, fasting and purifying his thoughts. After many years had passed, he departed as an immortal.

The *Traditions of Daoist Scholarship* states: Zuo Dun, styled Shangyin, was a native of Leimaiyang. Cloudyang Mountain is none other than Mount Mao. Fifteen *li* west of Dun’s mountain abode stood a stone chamber; two *li* to the southwest was another stone chamber, each capable of holding several dozen people. Elders of the southwestern chamber transmitted that a bronze ox had emerged, along with bronze worms and bronze scrolls, and the place was thus called the Bronze Chamber. Winding inward to profound depths, it stood to the north, connecting to the Flowing Pool, and the cavern led to Kunlun. On each of the Three Primes’ fasting and purification days, Dun went to the two chambers to pray and cast talismans, always coiling his hair into the form of a Buddha’s topknot.

It further says: Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Wuxing. In the seventh year of the Taishi era, he led the assembly in establishing the Three Primes’ Open-Air Fast. The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected’s Upper Granary and Primordial Upper Record* states: In every realm where living beings dwell, purity is scarce and turbidity abundant, with defilements entwining one another. If good conduct is not established, perverse *qi* will invade, and fierce demons will guard and test. Those who study the higher teachings fast and purify themselves, concentrating their thoughts and barring the clamor of the dusty world. Unwholesome entities intrude and depart—all are defiled and turbid. One must choose an auspicious day to fast and purify, wear the talisman of *po-yan*, and thus ascend to Jade Purity.

**Nurturing Life**

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: The Dao of nurturing life lies in calming the body and cultivating *qi*, avoiding joy and anger. When one is free from worry, longevity naturally follows. It further says: One is the beginning of numbers, the Dao of life, the origin of primordial *qi*, and the great guiding principle of Heaven. Thus, one must guard and contemplate the One. If you wish to nurture old age and preserve longevity, guard the One most steadfastly. Harmonize your *qi* and remain tranquil externally, abiding with the One. If your *qi* flows like a spring’s source, what harm can befall your body? This is called the true treasure, and old age and decline will depart of their own accord.

It also says: In the time of the Three Sovereigns of antiquity, people’s *qi* was pure, and they deeply understood the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they all studied the true Dao and thereby attained the impartiality of Heaven and Earth. The method of seeking the Dao begins with stillness as its foundation. Once the heart and spirit are clear, they unite with the Dao, dispelling ignorance and illuminating all like the midday sun. Those who do not study this Dao are like those dwelling in a dark room, lost and disoriented. Hence, the sagely and wise hasten to its pursuit.

The *Scripture of the Supreme* states: Guarding the One brings true stability to the source of the heart; guarding stillness preserves the spirit and forgets the form. When *qi* is settled and pervades the formless, the Dao is accomplished, and the true descends.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes and the True One* states: To embody the hundred spirits, the ears are the windows of the Imperial Lord, the eyes are the sun and moon of the Great One, the nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primes, the mouth is the crimson abyss of the Crimson Palace, the eyebrows are the canopy of the White Prime, the hair is the essence of the Forest of the Bright Hall, the tongue is the dragon axle of the Primordial Flower, the teeth are the might of the Stomach Palace, the hands are the external aid of the Gallbladder Spirit, the feet are the numinous gate of the Kidney Prime, and the utmost yin is the true mechanism of the Grotto Chamber.

It further says: Juanzi taught Su Lin the Dao of guarding the Three True Ones. Later, Lin returned to Juanzi’s chamber of stillness, but Juanzi was no longer there. He left behind a written scroll in his sleeping quarters for Lin, which read: "The Five Pecks and Three Ones are secrets of the Great Emperor. After twelve years of concentrated contemplation, the Three Ones will appear and transmit their scripture to you. If the Three Ones alone are indestructible and everlasting, how much more so for those who guard them? One who guards the Three Ones will have their name inscribed on the Jade Tablet. How much more so for one who meets the Three Ones? By further contemplating the Grotto Chamber, one becomes a Duke of the Upper Clarity. By further understanding the Three Primes, one becomes a successor to the Five Emperors. How does the Golden Watchtower’s Imperial Lord ride the swift clouds and traverse the Ten Heavens? It is through the Dao of the Grotto Chamber and the Three Primes’ True One."

Scholars of the world all revere guarding the One. They must ensure the heart is unadorned and the spirit concentrated, the body devoted and sincerity evoked. Thus, a hundred thoughts do not arise, and the essence of intent does not scatter. Simply focus inwardly for three months, binding the mind to one spirit, not dispersing but concentrating the *qi*, achieving harmony through the utmost simplicity. Those who attain it swiftly do so because simplicity scatters and truth departs, while artificiality and falsity arise, giving rise to strife and chaos. Thus, the One is not swiftly perceived, and the spirit does not immediately respond—not because it does not wish to abide with those who contemplate it, but because those who do not concentrate their thoughts lack discernment. Hence, it takes years of accumulated effort to sever the ties of the mundane.

The method of the Three Ones is the first chapter of the *Upper Clarity’s* true scriptures, the jade Dao of the Most High, the ford of divine immortality, and the wondrous secret of the host of perfected beings. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you; if you can see the One, the One will see you. The One requires the body to stand, and the body requires the One to live.

The precepts of guarding the One warn against lack of concentration. If concentration is not sustained, if duration is not prolonged, if prolonged effort is not refined, if refinement is not steadfast, and if steadfastness is not enduring, then the Three Ones depart, and the body becomes an empty dwelling.

The *Scripture of the Five Talismans* states: One who knows the One knows all; one who does not know the One knows nothing. The One is the most noble, the title without equal. If you desire longevity, the Three Ones must be understood. When you hunger for the One, the One provides sustenance; when you thirst for the One, the One provides drink. The One can generate yin and produce yang, propelling the cycles of cold and heat. Its greatness cannot be concealed by the Six Directions, and its smallness cannot be discerned by the tip of a hair. When one is at leisure and prepared, the One does not depart. When one contemplates the One with diligence, the One can communicate with the divine. By moderating drink and restraining food, the One remains and breathes. Knowing the One is not difficult; the difficulty lies in persevering to the end. Knowing the true and not acting is the same as not knowing. Seek it unceasingly, and you will ascend to Jade Clarity.

It further says: Nurture your *qi* to preserve your body. It also says: Those who consume *qi* always maintain a youthful countenance.

*Laozi* states: The Dao’s words are subtle and profound; you have yet to distinguish them. Grasp their essentials and be cautious not to lose them. First reduce your desires and do not let your mind wander. Dwell in seclusion and stillness, refining your chamber of fasting. Even ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar scriptures are not as good as guarding the One. Restrain your thoughts to settle your will, calm your body to pacify your spirit, treasure your *qi* to preserve your blood. Forget thoughts and worries, focus inwardly, and your body and spirit will unite. Contemplate stillness to await the true, and the myriad wonders will respond and converge. Concentrate your essence and accumulate spirit without mingling with external things—this is called purity. Return the spirit and ingest *qi*, abiding in stillness without movement—this is called the Dao.

It further says: Those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers; they enter battle without being harmed by armor or weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger has nowhere to place its claws, and weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades.

The *True Scripture of the Supreme* states: The One has no form; seeking it is difficult, and guarding it is easily lost. It is easily lost because of weak perception and desires clogging the heart’s gate. Only in vast emptiness and non-action does guarding the One reside. All accumulation that has not reached its limit proceeds gradually. One must clearly recognize the spirit and *qi* of the Three Primes—their appearance, names, and the cycles of their presence and absence. They are born and reside in the Three Palaces, and corpse poison departs of its own accord. The sacred and true scriptures of immortality are transmitted according to the cause.

The *Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* states: In studying the utmost Dao, one must settle the heart, eliminate afflictions, and purify the body, understanding change and rectifying thoughts. When the body is pure, the heart becomes settled; when the heart is settled, the Dao is accomplished; when the Dao is accomplished, the true descends.

To store the One and guard the spirit, the essential lies in proper transformation. Proper transformation arises from settling the heart; when the heart is settled, perception becomes clear; when perception is clear, one meets the Dao.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate also said: The ancients who cultivated the Dao practiced profound stillness to quiet the spirit, contemplated the true and preserved the primordial. They gradually guided the unrefined, returning perception to its source in spirit. Knowing, they could see; seeing, they could follow; following, they could practice; practicing, they could persist; persisting, they could accomplish; accomplishing, they did not dwell.

Is the virtuous person in the world like a bellows? They do not contend with the myriad things, yet their power constantly returns to them. This is due to their humility and desirelessness. Desire is the root of misfortune and harm; non-being is the origin of Heaven and Earth. None know its root, none know its source. The sage eliminates desire to enter non-being, thereby aiding their person.

The *Scripture of the Great One Cavern-Truth* states: The two ears are called the high windows of the Six Harmonies. It also says: The center of the teeth is named the Palace of Receiving Life. Further, it says: In the Dao of nurturing life, the ears and eyes are the masters. Scattered vision dims the eyes; excessive listening closes the ears.

The *Inner Transmission of Master Pei* says: Those who seek the Dao must first make the eyes clear and the ears keen. Moreover, the ears and eyes are the ladder for seeking the true and the gateway for gathering the numinous—success or failure depends on them.

The *Scriptures of the Immortals* say: In nurturing life, not causing harm is the foundation. This is a crucial teaching.

The *Scripture of the Great Clarity* states: All beings that contain qi value life. Life is the great power of Heaven and Earth; no power surpasses long life. Those who attain long life must transcend the body. They do not harm other beings with their bodies—not merely refraining from harm, but aiding others while forgetting themselves. Forgetting themselves, yet their person is not forgotten—this is the way of those who skillfully nurture life. The true Dao nourishes the spirit, and the spirit can soar and transform.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes* says: The Dao of nurturing life must cherish qi and preserve the spirit. One must not engage in loud speech or shouting, lest the spirit be wearied and qi damaged. Therefore, perfected persons and Daoists constantly practice exhalation and inhalation to harmonize the six fluids.

The *Scripture of the Mysterious Manifestation* says: The physical form is merely the vessel of life, not the means by which life generates itself. Life generates itself through plain simplicity as its substance, qi as its origin, and spirit as its form—this is the palace and courtyard of life. Nurturing the spirit through non-action, unfolding the gate of profound mystery, coming and going in the realm of formlessness, resting in the boundless—this is what is called attaining the life-source of mysterious clarity.

It also says: External distractions should be cut off, and internally one should focus on the mysterious true. Only then can long life be preserved.

The *Scripture of the Wondrous True* says: The Daoist plans for life, not for fame. Their mind is free of worldly concerns, their intent without inclination. Their will flows like water; their dwelling is like an empty city. Accumulating and guarding non-action, they can attain long life.

The *Precepts of the Many Perfected* say: Impatience and violence are the greatest thieves of the body and the scattered ladder of seeking the Dao. Those who employ them drive away the true; those who reform them invite the Dao. In all matters, one should be gentle and unhurried, exhausting the principle of utmost purity. Only then can one approach the Dao.

The spirit is what Heaven and Earth hasten toward. Nurturing the spirit and cultivating nature, practicing the qi of the life Dao to traverse difficulties—this is the profound understanding of the highest sages and perfected persons. Those who cultivate the Dao should practice this to sustain their person.

The *Scripture of the Lord Emperor of the Great One* says: If one can constantly practice the method of the Nine Dawns illuminating the Cavern Chamber and the Mud Pill Palace, restraining the hun and po souls and controlling the myriad evils, and purify their conduct, then the qi of the numinous immortals will descend into their bedchamber. This is what is called drawing the Three Lights and Nine Stars to illuminate the hundred spirits.

The *Arrayed Records of the Highest Clarity* say: Closing the womb and quieting the breath, internally preserving the hundred spirits, swallowing the radiance and swallowing the fluids, consuming food naturally—one’s body will surely enjoy longevity, and one may attain the immortality of the terrestrial realm.

The *Secret Essentials of the Perfected of the Great Highest* says: Qi is the vessel of spirit and brightness, the origin of purity and turbidity. Abiding in the mysterious, Heaven is clear; dwelling in humans, the body is preserved. Life and death, decline and fullness—these all depend on the art of nurturing and controlling.

The *Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: Those who consume the qi of the mysterious root make their bodies clear and bright, their spirit and eight senses keen. Their body shines like the sun, their face glows with jade-like luster. Ingesting morning fluids and suspending grain, relying on golden liquor as the essential Dao and water jade as the wondrous practice—this is what is called exhaling and inhaling the Great Harmony of nature and governing the numinous qi of the Nine Essences.

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* says: The essentials of long life lie in the Dao of rejuvenation; extending years and eliminating illness are secondary. If one does not harm oneself, even if still young and strong, and knows the Yin Elixir of rejuvenation to supplement the brain, gathering the Seven Benefits in the Long Valley, without consuming medicinal herbs, one may still live one or two hundred years.

There are several ways to cause harm: straining to think beyond one’s capacity, exerting strength beyond one’s ability, deep worries and heavy resentments, sorrow and joy, relentless desires, constant anxieties, irregular sleep, excessive drunkenness and vomiting, eating to fullness and lying down immediately, running and panting, shouting and weeping, lack of sexual union—accumulating such harms to the utmost exhausts the body, violating the methods of nurturing nature.

Do not exhaust the ears with listening or the eyes with prolonged gazing. Do not sit until fatigued. Dress before feeling cold, remove clothing before feeling hot. Do not eat when extremely hungry, and do not eat to excess. Do not drink when extremely thirsty, and do not drink too much.

Do not overwork, nor sweat excessively, nor spit frequently. Do not gallop on horseback or race in carriages, nor strain the eyes with distant gazing. Avoid eating raw or cold foods. In winter, do not seek extreme warmth; in summer, do not seek extreme cold. Do not expose yourself to bitter cold, scorching heat, fierce winds, or dense fog. The five flavors should not be consumed in excess or imbalance.

Though such harms may not be immediately felt, over time they diminish one’s lifespan. Therefore, those skilled in nurturing life rise and rest in accordance with the seasons’ rhythms, maintain harmonious routines in daily activities, regulate the sinews and bones through proper postures, ward off illness and repel evil with breath control, balance the flow of *qi* through the stomach and meridians with tonifying and purging methods, and moderate exertion and rest with the principles of giving and taking. They restrain anger to preserve *yin*, suppress joy to nourish *yang*, and only then first consume herbs and plants to remedy deficiencies, later ingesting the Golden Elixir to secure boundless vitality. The principles of long life are fully encompassed herein.

If one indulges desires, follows whims, claims enlightenment and understanding of fate, dismisses heterodoxies while indulging passions, and neglects the pursuit of longevity, how can one be taught the words of nurturing life?

The *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: Master Fangzhu of the Azure Youth said, "Those who study the Dao suffer, and those who do not also suffer. Though both sufferings begin the same, their ends differ. For those who pursue the Dao, bitterness leads to joy; for those who do not, suffering remains endless. From birth to old age, from old age to illness, from illness to death—how great is this suffering! With sins accumulated in the heart and brain, the cycle of life and death never ceases, its bitterness beyond words. How can one fail to live out their natural years? This is the suffering of not pursuing the Dao.

Yet pursuing the Dao also entails hardship: maintaining purity, preserving truth, guarding the mysterious and contemplating the numinous, seeking teachers through toil, enduring hundreds of trials, and unwavering in resolve—this too is extreme suffering. During decades of such effort, the hardship may seem greater than the reward. But upon attaining the Dao, this suffering is instantly forgotten, like one who, after a hundred days of hunger, is sated in a single meal—how could they recall the former pangs of want? Without the Dao, this cannot be achieved."

The Right Radiant Perfected One said: "Those who entangle themselves in family affairs or are burdened by worldly duties cannot focus on the Dao. To hold the Dao yet not practice it is as if one had no Dao at all; to grasp a treasure yet not use it is as if one had no treasure."

The Primordial Lady of Purple Tenuity said: "Illness arises from excessive thoughts; evil begins with a scattered mind. Many thoughts lead to many affairs, and many affairs bring endless burdens. Adrift and unrestrained, entangled and unceasing, the mind is consumed by myriad worries, the body wearied by a hundred labors. When form and spirit are exhausted, how can illness not arise? Even behind high walls and heavy gates, one fears bandits; how much worse to leave the door unbarred and invite harm upon oneself? The intellect, when boundless, injures one’s nature; the heart, when reckless, dissipates truth. Forms appear before the eyes, sounds enter the ears—these open the mind to desires and attachments, fostering greed. The *hun* is the upright spirit, prizing clarity and sincerity; the *po* is the wayward ghost, prone to madness and rebellion. When thoughts of flying immortals arise, one must temper them with compassion and restraint. In all encounters, let this be the heart’s guiding principle, and the heart becomes the Dao."

The *Nine Splendors Scripture* states: "The eyes are the body’s mirror, the ears its windows. Excessive gazing dims the mirror; excessive listening shuts the windows. Polish the mirror and open the windows, and one can perceive all spirits and hear the faintest sounds. The face is the courtyard of the spirit, the hair the blossom of the brain. Grief withers the face; depletion of the brain whitens the hair. Thus, when essence and *qi* are lost within, the elixir of vitality is exhausted. Essence is the spirit of the body, clarity its treasure. Overwork scatters essence; excessive scheming consumes clarity. Thus, aging follows the decline of *qi*, and senility soon arrives."

The *Zhen’gao* states: "Wealth and rank are the axes and saws that break bones, the boats and carriages that carry sin. They suffice to invite transgressions and disgrace, serving as weapons that cut short life—these are not auspicious things. Thus, the sages of old, foreseeing the difficulties of guilt and misfortune, knew that wealth and rank could not be enjoyed. They retreated to deep forests and dwelled in famous mountains, seeking to distance themselves from such paths, to cultivate blessings, and preserve their primordial purity."

Master Pei said: "Regulating the Three Passes is the way to long life: the mouth is the Heavenly Pass, the hands the Human Pass, and the feet the Earthly Pass. When regulated, the five viscera are at peace, and peace brings freedom from illness. Moreover, one should visualize the Five Spirits within the body: the two hands, two feet, and head. Envision the head as azure, both hands as crimson, and both feet as white—thus one draws near to immort

The earth, by holding to the One, remains still and abides in its place; the mountains, by holding to the One, endure neither cold nor heat; the seas, by holding to the One, flow without return. When a person holds to the One, they are certain to attain true transcendence.

The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: "The Dao possesses a great method—attaining it brings immediate attainment. This is called the Way of the Three Ones. It commands generals, officers, and soldiers to sever the paths of evil."

The *Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor* says: "The Three Perfected are the emperors of one’s body, ruling over the hundred spirits within. They initiate transformations, partings, and unions, merging with the true and penetrating the numinous. Subtle indeed, beyond words—transmitted only to immortals."

The *Scripture of the Plain and Numinous* states: "The Three Ones are the numinous origin of the body, the life-root of the hundred spirits, the mountain-source of fluids, and the jade chamber of the ethereal soul. Thus, the stomach’s reservoir is square to receive things, while the palace of the brain is round and numinous to adapt."

The *True Supreme* says: "The reason the perfected value the One as true is simply this: the One alone. What the One contracts is the primordial qi of creation. The transformations of the One merge heaven and earth in darkness. Therefore, the Upper One is the celestial emperor of the body, the Middle One is the cinnabar sovereign of the Crimson Palace, and the Lower One is the primordial lord of the Yellow Court. These Three Ones truly govern the twenty-four qi within the body to bestow life, establishing the One within. Above, they correspond to the twenty-four true qi of the Grand Tenuity. When the true qi circulates in harmony, the myriad things take form. The dark spirits intermingle, and the Purple Chamber fades into obscurity. The Upper One is the ultimate of the true emperor, the Middle One is the lord of the true sovereign, and the Lower One is the wonder of the true king. The Celestial Sovereign attains the ultimate and thus ascends to the imperial ultimate; the Terrestrial Sovereign attains the lord and thus ascends to the Orthodox One; the Human Sovereign attains the wonder and thus ascends to the host of wonders. The Three Sovereigns embody the true and hold to the One—this is their true ultimate, for they attain the One alone."

The *Records of Immortals Gathered* states: "All movements, gazes, breaths, eating, speech, likes, dislikes, and judgments—each person has their allotted years, months, days, and hours, determined by their corresponding fate. This is the constant principle of things. The body has the peril of decay, the spirit has its destined time of dispersal, and life has its inevitable end. When the spirit abides, there is a person; when the spirit departs, there is but a corpse. This arises from desires disturbing the heart, unable to forget the pleasures of form and taste. Those who cultivate the Dao dwell in ease without encumbrance, harmonious and ever-permeable. Good and evil each follow the principle of retribution, without the slightest deviation. The foundation of long life lies solely in goodness as its base. Born between heaven and earth, each fulfills their nature. Those with clear qi are wise and sagely; those with turbid qi are cruel and foolish; those with firm qi are lofty, stern, and resolute; those with yielding qi are kind, benevolent, and sincere. The enlightened subdue their nature to extend life; the benighted indulge their desires and harm their nature. Nature is the source of life, and life is the root of existence. Strive to cultivate it, nurturing life to nourish nature and guarding the spirit to preserve life. Human life arises from the spirit—when the spirit is settled, there is life; when the spirit is severed, there is death. Thus, accumulating qi forms essence, and accumulating essence forms spirit. Therefore, the immortal seeks within, and when the inner is recondite, the Dao draws near. The true one cultivates quiescence, and through stillness, unites with the true. The spirit must accumulate resonance to become numinous and penetrating. By constantly holding to the One, transcendence draws near, and one shares the same lodging with heaven and earth in the Great Void. Further, by penetrating the numinous body, the absence becomes the Great Void, and one lodges together in the vast silence. By penetrating the silent, hearing and sight become unhearing and unseen, merging with the Dao. The Dao is the utmost truth of numinous penetration; arts are the mysterious techniques of transformation. The Dao is formless, relying on arts to aid others. Humans possess numinosity, and through cultivation, they contract the Dao. The essentials of the Dao lie in profound simplicity and ease of practice. The secrets of arts reside solely in elixirs and qi. Superior practitioners who ingest them ascend as immortals of the celestial bureaus; middling practitioners who ingest them dwell on Kunlun; inferior practitioners who ingest them attain long life among humans."

Thus, the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One expounded the essential practices of the returning elixir and golden fluid to the world.

It further states: "The Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal are the ancestral origins of the two qi, the fundamental roots of yin and yang, the sovereigns of the immortal perfected, and the primal beginnings of creation. Condensing qi to form the true, they unite with the Dao in substance. Moreover, qi pervades heaven and earth, animating the movements of all things, both animate and inanimate. As humans, we are among things; as things, we manifest the great. The latent and dispersed are boundless. Nature arises from heaven, while life is completed by humans. What establishes it is heaven; what enacts it is the Dao."

The Mysterious Elder of the Dao said: "Attain utmost emptiness and hold fast to stillness. The myriad things will naturally revert—reversion means returning to the Dao and abiding forever. The essentials of longevity are: heaven preserves its mystery, earth guards its things, and humans nurture their qi."

It further states: "When the King of Shang heard that Peng Zu possessed the Dao, he appointed him as a grand minister. Peng Zu often claimed illness and lived in seclusion, not participating in government affairs. He ingested mica powder and drank water infused with deer antler."

He maintained a youthful appearance and a deeply tranquil nature, never boasting of his mastery of the Dao. When the king visited to seek his counsel, Peng Zu offered no instruction. The king then had a resplendent chamber with purple pavilions built in the palace gardens for Peng Zu to reside in. When asked about the Way of extending life and increasing longevity, Peng Zu replied: "Those who wish to ascend to heaven and serve as immortal officials must ingest the Golden Elixir of the Primordial Sovereign and Grand Unity. This is the greatest of all methods. Next is to cherish essence and nurture spirit, consuming herbal medicines—this can grant long life. Following that is the regulation of yin and yang, the circulation of qi, and guiding the body through bending and stretching to ensure the free flow of qi through all joints and mechanisms without obstruction. This can prevent illness from taking hold. Contemplating the divine and focusing on the true, sitting in stillness to refine the fluids—all these can extend one’s years. As for the essentials of replenishing the brain, these are exceedingly difficult to practice. They involve the dangers of treading upon thorns and walking on blades, which are not fitting for a king to undertake. What I have heard is shallow and limited; my knowledge of the Dao extends only this far. It is not sufficient to propagate widely. Yet if one lives in the world and nurtures oneself properly, one may reach over a hundred years. Those who fall short do so because they harm themselves. Overindulgence in drink, extreme joy, great anger, excessive warmth, extreme cold, overexertion, and exhaustion—all these cause harm. Supreme pleasure, deep sorrow, overwhelming fear, terror, agitation, restlessness, extravagance, and excess—all these cause harm. Extreme hunger, raging thirst, excessive thought, and overmuch worry—all these cause harm. Prolonged sitting, standing, exposure, or walking—all these cause harm. When cold and warmth are moderated, hunger and satiety are balanced, and one is free from thought and action, abiding only in clarity and stillness—only then can one speak of cultivating the body. Having already attained longevity, if one continues to nurture oneself properly, one may enjoy extended life, provided one avoids harm. To remain warm in winter and cool in summer, never losing harmony with the four seasons—this is how one adapts to the body. To behold beauty and graceful forms without succumbing to desire—this is how one unites with the spirit. To possess carriages and robes with dignity, knowing contentment and seeking no more—this is how one unifies the will. To enjoy the eight tones and five colors without becoming ensnared—this is how one guides the heart. All these things are meant to nurture humanity, yet people, unable to moderate and balance them, instead turn them into afflictions. Thus the sages and worthies left warnings, fearing that those of lesser talent would become lost in excess, forgetting the proper use of things and straying from their purpose. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao are all instructed to abstain from such things, making restraint easier. It is like fire and water—used improperly, they become harmful. People do not realize that their meridians are damaged, their blood and qi depleted, their inner principles hollow and weak, their marrow and brain unsolidified. Their bodies are already ailing, and so they are vulnerable to external influences, falling ill due to wind, cold, alcohol, or desire. If one’s foundation were full and strong, how could illness or evil take hold? Excessive longing, envy, and desire harm a person. Grief, resentment, sorrow, excessive joy, unresolved anger, obsessive love, constant worry, imbalance of cold and warmth, and lack of union between yin and yang—all these cause harm. The union of man and woman is like the mutual generation of heaven and earth. It is through this that one guides and nurtures the spirit and qi, ensuring harmony is not lost. Heaven and earth separate by day and unite by night; in a year, they join three hundred and sixty times. Thus the four seasons are balanced, and the myriad things are born, their generation and completion without end. This is how heaven does not lose its movement, earth does not lose its harmony, and things do not lose their vitality, enduring forever. Yet people, unable to emulate heaven and earth and maintain constancy, reduce their clothing and abstain from food, bringing upon themselves illness and death—how foolish this is! Avoiding such extremes and practicing moderation, regulation, and proper circulation, one may absorb the harmonious qi of the universe. When one attains this Way, evil cannot enter—this is the foundation of nurturing life. There are over seventeen hundred other methods, such as absorbing the radiance of the sun, contemplating the spirit, guiding the organs, practicing daoyin, swallowing saliva, and consuming elixirs. Additionally, there are practices for the first month of each season: examining oneself, repenting for transgressions, and regulating the times of rising and resting. These can guide beginners toward the gate of goodness, gradually correcting their hearts and slowly dispelling their faults. Yet they do not immediately enable one to attain the Dao. If one’s blood and vessels are withered, one’s spirit and qi decayed, how can mere contemplation of the divine and focus on the true preserve them? It is doubtful whether any benefit can be gained. This is because ordinary people seek the Dao by pursuing its branches rather than its root.

Another passage states: "If one does not nurture the spirit within and exhausts the body without, one’s primordial essence will gradually be plundered, and one’s spirit and qi will become depleted. Even if one diligently studies and recites scriptures and formulas day and night, it will be of no avail. The myriad scriptures, numbering over thirteen thousand, merely point to the gateway for beginners."

The King of Shang received all these essential teachings and practiced Peng Zu’s methods, thereby extending his life. Yet he could not restrain his excesses of desire.

The *Register of Assembled Immortals* states: There was a woman of the common folk named Fan, a wine-seller in the market of Chen. Her wine was excellent, and a transcendent passed by her home to drink. In exchange, he gave her five volumes of plain silk books. When she opened and read them, she found they contained methods for nurturing life and attaining longevity. She secretly copied the essential formulas and practiced them. After three years, her complexion became youthful. Several years later, the transcendent who had given her the wine returned. Smiling, he said to her, "You have stolen the Dao without a teacher—you have wings but do not fly." Lady Fan then followed the transcendent away, and her whereabouts became unknown.

It further states: The Woman of Grand Yang, Shi Yi, obtained the Way of exhalation and inhalation and served Jue Dongzi, Li Xiu. Li Xiu wrote forty scrolls, titled *The Source of the Dao*. He practiced the principle that softness overcomes hardness and weakness subdues strength. It is like treading on thin ice or walking on the edge of a cliff, driving a galloping chariot with rotten reins—deviate by a hair’s breadth, and you lose your strategy. Yet if one practices diligently, one can attain long life.

It also states: The Woman of Grand Yin, Lu Jin, had not yet completed her study of the Dao. While selling wine along the Way, she secretly sought her teacher. When a guest arrived, she asked him how many years he had lived in the land. He replied, "Three in the south, five in the north, nine in the west, and the middle in the northwest." She returned and reported, "This guest is a great worthy, a transcendent who has attained the Dao. When I first asked, he knew one and understood five." She then inquired about the Way of long life and obtained the essentials of supplementation and guiding, as well as the method for steaming the elixir.

It further states: The Lady of Grand Mystery, Zhuan He, often said: "In this world of men, a single misstep cannot be regained, and death once met cannot be revived. The span of life is brief—without cultivating the Dao, it cannot be prolonged." Thereupon, she purified her heart and sought the Dao, obtaining its arts.

**On Ingesting Medicinal Substances, Part One**

The *Divine Farmer’s Classic* states: "Superior medicines bring bodily peace and extend life." It further says: "Ingesting the Five Mushrooms, cinnabar, malachite, mica, *taiyi* [primordial essence], and *yuyuliang* [limonite], each taken singly, grants long life. Middle-grade medicines nourish nature, while lower-grade medicines dispel illness. These are the ultimate words of the highest sages and the true records of esoteric arts."

The foremost

Here the translation follows:

---

She favored sitting alone in quiet places, refining her thoughts with subtle focus. Daily at sunrise, she would face east, rinse her mouth, and ingest solar *qi*—practicing thus each dawn.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: During the late Han, Zhang Zhengli of Mount Heng received the Rainbow Radiance Elixir formula from the Lord of Western City. Distressed by the scarcity of cinnabar, he departed for Guangzhou as a Daoist adept and ascended as an Upper Immortal from the Whistling Chamber.

It further says: Zhang Xuanbin, a native of Dingxiang, was nominated as a *maocai* during the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei. Returning to his hometown, he studied under Ji the Elder of Xihe, receiving the method of ingesting wood-based medicines. Later, he encountered the Perfected Man Fan Ziming on Mount Shaoshi, who transmitted to him the arts of concealment, transformation, and luminous concealment. Formerly of Mount Tianzhu, he now serves as the Master of Regulations in the Inner Hua Yang.

It further says: In the mountains of Mount Qian in Lujiang, Daoist practitioners Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua both received oral instructions from the Immortal Meng Deran during the early Jin, entering the mountains to practice the method of guarding the Five Viscera while absorbing solar essence, along with consuming sesame and the Mysterious Elixir.

It further says: Ping Zhongjie, a native of Hedong, fled the chaos of Liu Cong’s rebellion by crossing the Yangtze into Mount Kuocang. His body possessed true *qi*, and through ingesting medicines, he ascended as an immortal.

It further says: Zhao Guangxin, a native of Yangcheng, crossed the Yangtze during the late Wei to enter Mount Xiaobai in Ke, where he received Li’s method of ingesting *qi* and the Way of Guarding the Mysterious Center from Lord Zuo. After many years, he sometimes sold medicines in the capital, refining cinnabar into the Ninefold Radiance Elixir before ascending as an immortal.

It further says: Yu Wengsheng, a native of Kuaiji, received the method of consuming solar essence from the Immortal Jie Jun. During the Wu dynasty, he retreated to Mount Langwu, practicing the arts of cloud *qi* and bodily transformation. Through prolonged refinement, he ascended as an immortal.

It further says: Zhu Ruzi entered Mount Chishui during the late Wu, consuming chrysanthemum blossoms and wood. Later, he met the Master of Western Return, who granted him the essential teachings for transcending the world, and he ascended as an immortal.

It further says: The Jade Maiden of Bright Star resided on Mount Hua, consuming Jade Nectar. Atop the mountain stood a stone tortoise spanning several *mu*, its height exceeding three *ren*. Beside it lay a staircase ascending to the tortoise’s back, where a shrine to the Jade Maiden stood. Before it were five stones, known as the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basin. The water within was jade-green and limpid, neither swelling with rain nor diminishing in drought. A jade horse stood within.

It further says: In the mountains of Mount Hua, Daoist practitioners Yin Shouzi, Zhang Shisheng, and Li Fanghui—all contemporaries of Emperor Wu of Jin—received the method of steaming elixirs and ingesting wood from the Immortal Guan Chengzi. They also transmitted the method of consuming rosy clouds to Su Men and Zhou Shouling.

It further says: Fan Youchong, a native of Liaoxi, constantly practiced the Three *Qi* Method, where blue, white, and red *qi* each resembled threads. After a decade of practice, he attained immortality. This is the Supreme Primordial Inner Radiance Method of High Origin Lord, performed daily at dawn, with visible benefits. The method is simple, its effects verified.

It further says: Jiang Bozhen, on Mount Daheng, consumed *shinao* (stone brain). *Shinao* resembles small, speckled stones, soft in texture. On the eastern side of Mount Great Mao, a similar substance exists, round and small like *zengqing* (azurite), yet resembling stalactites in color. Fan Yangzi once consumed this as well.

*The Inner Transmission of Master Pei* states: The Buddhist-faced Daoist Zhi Ziyuan received the arts of longevity from Master Pei. It further says: While the pursuit of medicinal substances and meditative visualization both lead to the Dao, their origins differ. Ingesting medicines preserves the body, and when the body is sound, the spirit is at peace. Meditative visualization stabilizes the spirit, and when the spirit is attuned, the body is preserved. These two principles complement one another.

*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Xu Mai, styled Shu Xuan, originally named Ying and later renamed Yuanyou, shared a transcendent friendship with Wang Xizhi and his sons. Xizhi also renounced worldly honors to cultivate longevity, often visiting Yuanyou and staying for days without returning. Their poetic exchanges frequently discussed the ingestion of medicines.

It further says: Huang Guanzi, the Left Minister of the Upper Clarity, studied the Dao, consumed the Golden Elixir, and attained the Way through reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Bai Yusheng, the Left Minister of the Eastern Bureau, possessed a method for boiling stones. Zhang Shuyin, the Stone Immortal Overseer of Literary Virtue, received the Azure Essence formula. Li Baozu, the Right Duke of Grand Clarity from Mount Min, received the Azure Essence refinement method.

Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Liu Jing received the Cloud Pellet formula from Zhang Jun of Handan. It further says: Feng Junda, a native of Longxi, entered Mount Wushu to ingest medicines. At over a hundred years of age, he often rode a green ox. It further says: Wei Shuqing, a native of Zhongshan, consumed mica. It further says: Kong Yuan, a native of Xuchang, regularly consumed pine resin and *fuling* (poria). It further says: Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, a native of Hedong, often ate white stones, sharing them with others after cooking them like taro. It further says: Ling Shouguang, a native of Fufeng, obtained the Pill of Unending Elixir at over seventy years of age. After consuming it, he lived for over two hundred years without aging. It further says: Fan Miao, the Upper Immortal of the Central Office, styled Dushi and formerly named Bing, attained the Way through consuming the Rainbow Radiance Elixir and authored *The Biography of Lady Wei*. It further says: The Perfected Man of Pure Emptiness, Wang Bao, styled Zideng, was a seventh-generation descendant of Wang Ling, the Marquis of Anguo during the Former Han. The Lord of the Dao of Immortals bestowed upon him two *dou* of Cloud Azure Sunrise Elixir and Morning-Flown Elixir Fat. After consuming them, his vision extended far, and he could vanish while seated or standing, commanding a host of spirits.

**Daoist Canon, Scroll Twelve**

**On the Consumption of Elixirs and Nourishment**

The *True Records* states: On the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Perfected Man of Pure Emptiness spoke to Xu Yufu, saying: "The fat of the Five Lords’ Stone suits your constitution—you should hasten to consume it. It will preserve your youthful countenance, and the Wood Powder will dispel illness. These are what you ought to take." Next, consume [missing text] along with grains, and do not deviate from this. It further says: Those who master the *Great Cavern* become Immortal Ministers; those who consume the Golden Elixir become Grand Masters; those who consume the various mushrooms become Imperial Censors. If one obtains and consumes the Hidden Mushroom of the Supreme Ultimate, one becomes the Left Immortal Duke.

It further says: When one’s nature nears the Dao, true efficacy naturally arises. The Perfected Man of Purple Yang said: "Let Xu Yufu bathe frequently to cleanse the qi of water-borne illness and dissolve the accumulated blemishes of past hardships. This is the path to attaining perfection." In the study of the Dao of nourishing life, one must not weep excessively, for tears and spittle cause great harm. Thus, perfected ones and Daoist adepts constantly practice exhalation, inhalation, and the swallowing of essences to harmonize the six fluids.

It further says: Long ago, Emperor Cheng of Han was hunting in the Zhongnan Mountains when he saw a person without clothing, their body covered in hair, leaping and flying beyond reach. After encircling and capturing them, he asked who they were and learned they were a palace attendant from Qin. They recounted how, during the reign of Qin King Ziying, they had attended a court audience for the Dao. When the palace was burned, they fled in terror into the mountains, starving and on the verge of death. An old man instructed them to eat pine needles and pine nuts. The hunters later took them back and fed them grains, but they vomited for days before recovering. Over a year later, they died. Had they not been captured by humans, they would have become immortals.

It further says: Long Shu, styled Bogao, was a native of Jingzhao. During the Later Han, he studied the method of Embryonic Qi with the immortal Dao Lin and also received the [missing text] formula. He concealed himself in a drunken stupor and vanished into seclusion.

It further says: The Daoist Dai Meng of Mount Wudang, originally surnamed Yan and named Ji, styled Zhongwei, lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. From youth, he cultivated the Dao and virtue, refusing office. He entered Mount Hua, consuming mushrooms, Solomon’s seal, mica, and cinnabar, and received the Way of longevity from the Perfected Man of Pure Numinosity, Lord Wang. The Perfected Man Pei further bestowed upon him the *Scripture of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings*, along with the *Stone Essence and Golden Light Talisman*.

It further says: Consuming herbal medicines without practicing qi-circulation and guiding-and-pulling exercises is of no benefit—one will never attain the Dao. If one’s will is sincere and resonates with the numinous, success is inevitable, and one need not rely on the benefits of herbs. Yet if one only knows qi-circulation without mastering the method of the Divine Elixir, one will not become an immortal. If one obtains the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir, no other techniques are necessary. If one masters the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one need not attain the Way of the Golden Elixir to become an immortal. Every person is born with a destiny recorded in the celestial registers, and if their will is steadfast, the Dao will make it so. Thus, some achieve immortality without study, for the Dao comes to them of its own accord. Beyond this, all require unwavering resolve.

It further says: The Jade Consort of the Eastern Sea, younger sister of the Azure Lad, descended to teach Zhang Weizi the method of consuming mist.

It further says: When one inhales the qi of cypress, the three impurities of the intestines and stomach are purged. The *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmonious Flow* states: The Perfected Man of Broad Peace, bearing a halo of radiant light and holding a flowered banner, stood before the Supreme Emperor and inquired about the methods of refinement.

It further says: Within the Terrace of the Five Peaks on Great Mount Huo in Luojiang, there grows a five-colored Hidden Mushroom. On Mount Huayang, there are five kinds of Night-Glowing Mushrooms. On Mount Liangchang, there is a Firefly Mushroom, its form resembling grass, its body on the ground like a firefly, as large as a bean, with purple blossoms. When viewed at night, it emits light. Those who consume it gain clarity of mind and can read and calculate by night. Consuming forty-seven of them grants longevity.

It further says: Within Mount Bao, there is a White Mushroom and a Hidden Spring of purple hue. On Mount Huayang’s Leiping Peak, there is the Field Lord’s Spring, its flowing jade sands ideal for washing clothes.

It further says: Those who consume the Ninefold Numinous Essences of the Sun and Moon obtain the method of the Supreme Ultimate’s Dark Perfection.

It further says: Lang Zong, styled Zhongsui, was a native of Anqiu in Beihai. In his youth, he pursued an official career, and during the Later Han, he served as Magistrate of Wu. He diligently studied the protective arts of the Dao and divined the movements of wind and qi. One day, a sudden whirlwind arose in his courtyard. He divined that a great fire would burn the Longxia Gate in Luoyang. He sent someone to verify this, and it proved true. When the imperial court heard of this, they summoned him as an Academician.

Lang Zong felt ashamed to be summoned for his divination skills, so one night he removed his official seal and sash, shouldered his books, and fled into seclusion. He dwelt beneath Mount Hua, consumed sesame seeds, attained the Dao, and now resides within the mountain’s grotto.

It further says: Fu Lihe was the grandson of Emperor Huan of Han through his daughter, named Fu Jian’an. He regularly ingested the qi of the Five Stars, attained the Dao, and became the Master of the Hall of Embracing Reality.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: My grandfather, the Grand Herald, once served as Magistrate of Lin’kang. He remarked that in this county there was a family whose members all enjoyed long lives. Later, when they moved away, their descendants increasingly suffered early deaths. Others who took residence in their former home again lived long lives for generations. Suspecting the well water was unusually red, they dug around the well and unearthed several *hu* of cinnabar buried by ancients—how much more so for those who consume cinnabar!

It further says: Zhao Qu of Shangdang had suffered from leprosy for years, and despite numerous treatments, he did not recover. Nearing death, his family loaded him onto a cart and abandoned him in a mountain valley. Zhao lamented his misfortune, weeping day and night, his tears flowing for months. A transcendent passed by the cave’s entrance, saw him, and took pity. After inquiring about his plight, Zhao, recognizing him as an extraordinary being, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy. The transcendent then gave him a pouch of medicine and instructed him on its consumption. After taking it, Zhao’s illness was cured, his complexion became radiant, and his skin smooth as jade. The transcendent visited him again. Zhao expressed his gratitude and begged for the formula. The transcendent replied, “It is merely pine resin. This mountain has an abundance—refine it, and you may attain longevity.” Zhao returned home, where his family was astonished. When asked how he recovered, he lived to one hundred seventy, his teeth and hair robust, remaining among people for over a hundred years before entering Mount Baodu.

It further says: As for longevity and the choice between staying or departing, each follows their own inclination. After consuming the Reverted Elixir or Golden Liquid, if one wishes to remain in the world, they need only take half. If seeking transcendence, they must consume it entirely. In ancient times, Master Anqi, Lord Longmei, Lord Xiuyang, and Yin Changsheng all took half a dose of the Golden Elixir. They remained in the world for nearly a thousand years before departing.

It further says: According to the middle chapter of *The Jade Key Classic*, establishing merit is paramount, followed by eliminating transgressions. For Dao practitioners, rescuing those in peril is the highest merit. Those who seek transcendence must base their practice on loyalty, filial piety, harmony, benevolence, and trust. Without cultivating virtue and focusing solely on techniques, one will never attain longevity. Major evil deeds forfeit one’s allotted lifespan, while minor transgressions reduce one’s years. Even if one consumes transcendent medicines, without sufficient accumulated goodness, it will be of no benefit.

I have perused texts on nurturing life, and none fail to regard the Reverted Elixir and Golden Liquid as the essentials—indeed, the pinnacle of the Dao of transcendence. In the past, Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, meditated intently for a long time in Mount Tianzhu, where a divine being bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of Transcendence*. Amid the great chaos at the end of the Han, he had no time to refine it and fled to the lands east of the Yangtze, intending to seek a renowned mountain to cultivate this Dao and follow his ancestral transcendent master. He received from Yuanfang the *Three Scrolls of the Supreme Clarity Elixir Scripture*, the *One Scroll of the Nine Cauldrons Elixir Scripture*, and the *One Scroll of the Golden Liquid Scripture*. My teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of the transcendent master. He also received these from my ancestor, but being poor and unable to afford the ingredients, I personally served him. After years of sweeping and attending to him, he established an altar on Mount Maji and transmitted the oral instructions not recorded in the texts. These scriptures were previously unknown in the Jiangdong region; they originated with Zuo Ci. Ci transmitted them to my ancestral transcendent master, who passed them to Master Zheng, who then bestowed them upon me. Thus, no other Daoists possess this knowledge.

This method relies on external substances to strengthen oneself. There is also the *Divine Elixir of Supreme Clarity*, whose method derives from the Primordial Lord. The Primordial Lord was the teacher of Laozi. The *Heavenly Scripture of Supreme Clarity* comprises ten chapters. The upper seven cannot be taught; the lower three, though transmitted in the world, are unworthy of dissemination and should be buried in the Three Springs. The lower three chapters are precisely the *Elixir Scripture*. It states: The superior person who attains the Dao ascends as an official of heaven; the middling person dwells on Kunlun; the inferior person attains longevity in the world.

Toward the end of the Later Han, Yin Jun of Xinye refined this *Divine Elixir of Supreme Clarity*. Gifted with literary talent, he composed poems, eulogies, and prefaces for the elixir scriptures, recounting his early studies under his teacher and what he had learned. The Radiant Elixir differs in method from the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir, and there is also the method of the Min Mountains Elixir. The Daoist Zhang He meditated intently in a stone chamber on Mount Min and obtained this formula. Each elixir method is distinct. The Golden Liquid is what the Great One consumes to attain transcendence.

It further says: Longevity is determined by the great medicine, not by sacrifices and invocations. During the Qin and Han dynasties, grand supplications were made, offerings presented to the Great One, the Five Emperors, Chenbao, the Eight Spirits, and the like, expending billions without benefit. How much more deluded are those of little virtue who vainly pray for extended years with the three sacrificial animals!

It further says: When compounding the great medicine of the Golden Elixir and refining the essence of the eight minerals, one must especially avoid the gaze of the vulgar, or the transcendent substance will not form. Some say: The superior person attains the Dao amidst military camps, the middling person in bustling cities, and the inferior person in mountain forests. This refers to those who have already refined the transcendent medicine but do not yet wish to ascend lightly. Even amidst armies and blades, they remain unharmed; in cities, misfortunes cannot befall them. The inferior person, not yet having reached this stage, must enter the mountains.

In ancient times, Daoists who refined transcendent medicines invariably entered renowned mountains. According to the *Scripture on Entering Mountains*, one may meditate and refine elixirs in the following: Mounts Taihua, Heng, Song, Shaoshi, Taibai, Zhongnan, Nüfan, Difei, Wangwu, Baodu, Anqiu, Hengqian, Qingcheng, Emei, Leishou Terrace, Luofu, Yangjia, Huangjin, the Greater and Lesser Tiantai, Gaizhu, Kuocang, and Siwang—all abodes of true spirits.

Where these mountains rise, lingzhi mushrooms grow in abundance, serving not only to compound elixirs but also to avert great wars and floods. Should a practitioner of the Dao ascend them, the mountain spirits will surely aid in bestowing fortune, and their elixirs will assuredly succeed. Those who do not climb these mountains may still compound elixirs upon the great isles of the sea.

It is further said: My master, Master Zheng, was over eighty years of age when his temples first showed streaks of white. Yet after several years, his hair turned black once more. His complexion grew radiant and full, and he could draw a mighty crossbow. He walked hundreds of *li* in a day, drank two *dou* of wine without becoming drunk, and when climbing mountains, his body felt light and agile—young men could not keep pace. His diet differed not from that of ordinary people, nor was it ever seen that he abstained from grain. I asked Huang Zhang, a disciple who followed the master, who recounted: Master Zheng was once returning from Yuzhang to the shores of Pu when he encountered a great storm and fell among bandits. He distributed his provisions to the others, taking none for himself, and went fifty days without hunger. Yet no one saw him perform any extraordinary acts—it was unclear by what means he achieved this. By lamplight, he could write in finer script than a youth.

Master Zheng was naturally adept in music and rhythm. On quiet nights, he would play the zither, while several attendants sat beside him. Though his mouth answered their questions without pause, his playing remained resonant, and his ears could still discern the subtlest variations in the strings of those beside him—correcting their errors in length and pitch, leaving not the slightest flaw unnoticed.

In my later years as Master Zheng’s disciple, I requested to see his esoteric writings. He told me: “The essential Dao fits upon a foot of silk—sufficient to transcend the world.” He also said: “What you know is vast but not yet refined, and your mind lingers on externals. Your learning lacks single-minded focus; you are not yet ready to delve deeply or journey far.” He promised that in time, he would show me the finest texts. Over the years, the short scrolls and silk manuscripts I had seen accumulated, and he had compiled nearly two hundred volumes of scriptures—though they could not all be grasped at once.

He further said: “Each new scroll contains fine matters, but you must discern the refined from the coarse and choose what to practice. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, all these texts will become unnecessary.” At times, he would instruct me in the proper sequence, beginning with the fundamentals to encourage learners, leaving no step unattended. Master Zheng was reluctant to allow others to copy his books in full; one had to grasp their essence. Even when lent for long periods, no one dared to steal so much as a single character.

Master Zheng had originally been a great Confucian scholar. In his later years, he turned to the Dao, yet he continued to teach the *Book of Rites* and the *Book of Documents*, never abandoning his scholarly bearing. His gaze was lofty and forthright, his demeanor upright and dignified; those who met him could not help but feel reverence. Whenever I sought his counsel, he would receive me with a gentle countenance, and I dared not speak lightly.

Among his fifty-odd disciples, only I was entrusted with the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir*, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, and the *Five Phases Record in the Pillow*. The others were not permitted even a glimpse of the opening lines of these texts.

The *Records of the Assembly of Immortals* states: The lush fruit is the bright pearl of spring’s awakening; the giant sesame is the hidden spirit of profound autumn; the cinnabar jujube is the cloud fungus of flourishing yang; the poria is the crimson embryo of the numinous. The Five Flowers hold mist within, the Three Qi refine and harmonize essence, and the Six Qi nourish the po-soul and guard the spirit.

It further says: The Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery was a person of Emperor Shaohao’s time. She dwelt on Mount Changsong in Shu, cultivating the Dao of long life. There, a mountain dweller taught her the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens* and instructed her to practice and wear them, saying: “The essence of cultivating the Dao lies in taking non-action as its foundation. The writings of the Eight Heavens are true non-action, and the Dao will naturally be achieved.” Yet she also refined and ingested the fluid of curved jade and dawn’s light, the elixirs of the Eight Jewels and Nine Flowers—secrets of the Great Ultimate—enabling her to enter the imperial court and witness the myriad transformations. She was granted the *Nine-Flower Formula* and refined the elixir by the river. By the riverbank lies the Golden Sand Spring, her legacy.

It also states: During the reign of Gao Xin, the immortal Zhan Shanggong often recounted that in ancient times, he had eaten white plums in Huayang, their flavor surpassing all others. Though he had not thought of them for long, three thousand years had already passed in an instant.

It further says: Li Tuo dwelt beneath Dragon Bridge Peak on Mount Jintang in Shu, cultivating the Dao. The people of Shu saw him across generations, estimating his comings and goings to span over eight hundred years—hence he was called Li Eight Hundred. Initially, he had come to Guanghan during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, residing on Mount Xuan and compounding the Nine-Flower Elixir to completion. He then traveled to the Five Marchmounts and the Twelve Grottoes, spending over two hundred years by the sea, where the Purple Yang Lord transmitted to him the Dao of Water Jade. Later, he returned to Dragon Bridge Peak, forged a golden tripod, and refined the Nine Elixirs, achieving perfection. As he had studied the Dao thrice upon this mountain, the world named it Three Studies Mountain, also calling it Mount Bingxian.

It further says: The Wen clan of Nanyang recounted that during the great chaos at the end of the Han, their ancestor fled into Mount Hu. Starving and near death, a man taught him to eat wood, and thus he never hungered again.

For a decade he returned to his hometown, his complexion growing ever more youthful. His body light as if about to take flight, he treaded perilous paths without weariness, walking amidst ice and snow yet utterly unaware of the cold.

The wood was also called *shanji* or *shanjing*.

It further says: Xue Nüzhēn, of unknown origin, lived during the upheavals of the Jin dynasty. As people fled to forests and marshes to avoid the world, she took refuge on Mount Heng. Beyond the Terrace of Seeking the Real, wherever she went, yellow birds, white apes, and white leopards followed her—yet none knew what Dao she cultivated.

It further says: Yùjiāng was a woman of hair, known as the Mao Maiden. Dwelling on Mount Hua, she claimed to be of Qin descent. She first learned to eat pine needles, never suffering hunger or cold. She dwelt in the cliffs, her movements swift as flight. The place is now called Mao Maiden Peak.

It further says: Juānzǐ, a man of Qi, consumed wood and composed the *Scripture of the Three Powers*. Prince Liu An of Huainan obtained his writings but could not fathom their meaning. He also authored three scrolls on the *Book of the Qin*, which were highly systematic.

It further says: Zhāng Wēizǐ was the daughter of Zhang Qing, Superintendent of Works during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han. Fond of the Dao, she often ingested misty qi. She claimed that mist was the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the overflowing qi of metal and stone. Prolonged ingestion allowed one to disperse form and enter emptiness, merging body with cloudy qi. Wēizǐ said she received this method from Chúnwénqī, the Jade Consort of Eastern Florescence of the Eastern Sea and sister of the Azure Lad. She also taught this mist-ingestion method to her disciples.

The *Nine Perfected and Radiant Consorts* states: The sun is the fruit of rosy clouds; rosy clouds are the essence of the sun. People have heard of methods to ingest the sun’s fruit, yet few know of the essence of rosy clouds. The *Scripture of Rosy Cloud Ingestion* is most arcane, while the Dao of attaining rosy clouds is most simple. This refers to the method of embodying jadelike radiance, where rosy clouds reflect the Upper Clarity.

*Daoist Canon, Section Twelve* concludes.
*Daoist Canon, Section Thirteen* begins.

**On Ingesting Elixirs**

The *Secret Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One once transmitted a divine formula to Master Changli. The master, surnamed Xue and styled Changli, lived during the reign of King Wu of Zhou. He passed it to the Overseer of All Perfected Ones of the Western Regions, who was the chief minister of the Golden Portal Sagely Lord. According to [missing text], the *Grain Elixir Formula* was received from the Perfected One of Western Liang, at a time in the northern valley of Dayuan. Now, the ninefold transmutation transmitted by Changli occurred during the early Zhou, marking the reception of the [missing text] grain elixir. Three to four hundred years later, this cinnabar was refined. This is recorded in the preface to the *Sword Scripture of the Controller of Destinies*. The Overseer of All Perfected Ones transmitted it to the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, who was the Controller of Destinies of the Eastern Ministry, Lord Mao the Elder. He received it in the third year of the Tianhan era of Emperor Wu of Han, at the age of forty-eight. Later, he also bestowed it upon his two younger brothers, each receiving a dose of the completed elixir. Though the Controller of Destinies transmitted it to his two brothers, this is not recorded here, as it was by the command of Lord Wangming, not through the proper lineage of transmission. After these two lords, only the Rectifier of Registers and Attendant Yang conveyed it to Director Xu and others, continuing to the present. Thus, during the Han and Jin dynasties, Daoist practitioners who ingested the golden liquid and ascended as immortals across the Six Directions never spoke of the ninefold transmutation. Since this Perfected One’s formula was first transmitted, none have dared to violate the covenant against reckless dissemination. The later generations, bound by the pacts of the Golden Dragon and Jade Fish, have only circulated written copies. Those who break the covenant and betray trust will be examined by the Three Ancestors in the Water Bureau, deemed guilty of recklessly transmitting to the unworthy.

Transmission requires a solemn covenant, using gold and jade rings in place of the oath sworn with cut hair and blood. To refine the ninefold transmutation, one must first craft a divine crucible, using clay crucibles from Yingyang, Changsha, or Yuzhang—these are earthenware crucibles. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor fired nine tripods at Mount Ke, and the *Central Scripture of Great Clarity* also contains a nine-tripod elixir method. Elixir crucibles have long been called "tripods." They are fired with chaff and should be placed in a secluded spot within a famous mountain, near water, constructing a turtle-shaped hut. The hut should be four *zhang* long and one *zhang* wide, with three doors opening to the south, east, and west. One must first purify oneself for a hundred days, then daub the divine crucible. Once the crucible is complete, the medicine is pounded. The fire is lit at dawn on the ninth day of the ninth month. When compounding various elixirs, the quality of the year is irrelevant; only the auspicious or inauspicious timing within the day or month matters. For the *Langgan* elixir, the fire is lit in the fourth, seventh, or twelfth month; for the *Quchen* elixir, in the fifth month; and for the nine elixirs of Great Clarity, though no fixed month is prescribed, the sixth, first, fifth, seventh, and ninth months are considered best. From the start of the purification, one must sever all worldly affairs until the elixir is complete. Only four or five like-minded and sincere companions may assist in compounding the elixir, all of whom must undergo purification together.

On the day the purification begins, five *hu* of dark wine are poured into the flowing water at the chosen site. If the location lacks flowing water, a well must be dug, and the wine poured into it to stabilize the earth’s *qi*. All participants in the purification must drink and eat from this water. The elixir method further requires placing ten *jin* of fine dragon bone in a green stone vessel, submerged in east-flowing water, called "Azure Dragon Liquid." This is consumed to harmonize with the water’s numinous essence. The ingredients include left-facing oysters from the Eastern Sea, white halloysite from Wu Commandery, mica flakes, earthworm soil, talc, and alum—six substances in equal parts. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One inscribed the *Supreme Emperor’s Scripture for Nurturing the Five Viscera* on the eastern wall of the Purple Tenuity Jade Forest Hall in the Palace of Supreme Ultimate. This is one of the Eight Dragon Writings of Highest Clarity, incomprehensible to worldly scholars. The Red Pine Master of Southern Marchmount received and ingested it, seeking commentary from the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.

The Azure Lad also said: "The fat of the Five Lords nurtures the five viscera, refines the white and transforms the body, restoring youthful complexion." Purification and the daubing of the turtle-shaped crucible are essential for refinement. The cloud-fat has a fragrantly sweet and uniquely delicious taste, strengthening the blood, fortifying the bones, preserving *qi*, congealing fluids, nurturing the five viscera, cultivating the hun and po souls—it is a true superior medicine. The Perfected One said: "This surpasses the refinement of the eight minerals and the ingestion of mica." This refers to those who refine their forms in the Great Yang and transcend the Three Bureaus.

It is also said: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One’s *Azure Essence [missing text] Grain Formula*. According to the *Biography of Pengzu*: "In Dayuan, there was a Master of Azure Essence who could eat nine times a day or fast for an entire year without hunger." This is the same method. It is a wondrous formula of the supreme immortals and a marvelous technique for abstaining from grains. The Perfected One of Pure Emptiness recounted that in Mount Huo, a Daoist practitioner named Deng Boyuan and Wang Xuanfu received the method of ingesting azure essence stone and swallowing sunlight, enabling them to write at night. Another immortal, Long Bogao, received the method of ingesting azure earth and, in a drunken state, vanished into seclusion at Fang Terrace. The Rectifier of Registers commanded his subordinate, saying: "Next, ingest earth-grain, and do not abandon ordinary grains. It will replenish marrow, eliminate ailments, and plump the skin." The subordinate also wrote to the Director, requesting rice medicine to dye and make grain, fearing the herbs would dry out. The Director wrote to the Senior Attendant, sending a small amount of white rice to dye and make grain. These six instances are recorded in texts.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One’s *Ten-Stone Azure [missing text] Grain* is a divine formula of the highest immortals, with commentary by Lord Wang. The large script is from the *Original Scripture of Supreme Simplicity* and the oral instructions of Western Liang, while the ink annotations are the explanations of the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness, compiled and transcribed by Lady Wei of Southern Marchmount and Attendant Yang, the Controller of Destinies. Five perfected ones jointly completed this method, which is truly wondrous.

The *Precious Scripture of the Highest Prime* states: "You ingest the kingly *qi* of plants and trees to commune with the divine. You ingest the essence of azure candles." This is what is meant. Transmitted by Supreme Simplicity, compiled by the Supreme Ultimate, it is the ultimate essential of the highest perfected immortals, unlike other arts. Ingesting [missing text] grain renders one invulnerable to harm, untouched by epidemics, free from distracting thoughts, and able to extinguish the Three Worms. The ears and eyes become keen, the steps light and swift. One gains the ability to conceal, transform, and vanish, and prolonged ingestion extends life.

Lord Mao, Controller of Destinies, addressed his two younger brothers, saying: "You should ingest the *Four-Fan Powder*. This is the Dao of reversing aging and restoring youth, once transmitted by the Yellow Emperor to Wind Lord. I received it from Master Gaoqiu and now pass it to you."

He further instructed his youngest brother, Lord Baoming, saying: "You should ingest the *Queen Mother’s Four Lads Powder*—this is the secret Dao of returning to infancy. If there is any deficiency in the body, this formula should be taken to replenish the brain." It is recorded that when Lord Xiaomao ingested it, he was already one hundred and twenty years old.

These two formulas are both wondrous methods and must be prepared with fasting and purification.

He also said: "Master Pei received from Zhi Ziyuan the method of ingesting *fuling* (poria). This was transmitted by Jiang the Mountain Man of Jiaoshan, and it grants longevity and enduring vision. When compounding it, one must observe strict fasting and purification."

Master Pei further received from Zhi Ziyuan the method of ingesting *huma* (black sesame). Jiang the Master ingested only these two formulas and attained the rank of immortal perfected.

These two formulas, though slightly different from those known to the world, were secretly employed by Master Pei and proven effective. While many methods exist for ingesting *fuling* and *huma*, this one—having been practiced by a perfected immortal and recorded in his own hand—must be the most spiritually potent of all. With consistent ingestion, the Dao of immortality may be attained. The difficulty lies in people discontinuing the practice before perceiving its benefits, thus few achieve its full effects.

If the body is not yet depleted and one is still young, one should ingest *fuling*. After the age of thirty, one should ingest *huma*.

Jiang the Master said: "These two formulas are the essential methods of *Dayou*—the great treasure of longevity and immortality." *Dayou* refers to the scriptural methods of the *Dayou* Palace within the Grotto-Heaven of Weiyu Mountain, where those who ingest them dwell.

The *Scripture of Treasured Mystery* states: "*Fuling* remedies youth, *huma* remedies old age. Combined with fasting and taken at dawn, they form the *huili* (luxuriant elixir) of a hundred flowers." The Five Lords called this *huimeng huayu* (flowery luxuriance of the hundred herbs).

*Fire essence* is *fuling*—its nature is warm and aligned with fire, thus it is the essence of fire. *Water treasure* is *huma*—its nature is cool, its color black, and it contains vital moisture, thus it is the treasure of water. Blended as one, they return essence to the treasury. This is what is meant.

Lord Pei, having used these methods in his youth, thus consumed *fuling*. The Perfected One of Pure Emptiness received this formula at the age of twelve—at that time, he had not yet suffered any depletion, which is why it is said that consuming *fuling* allowed him to see light at night. These two methods are both extraordinary formulas for prolonging life. If the two ingredients are combined in double measure, ground together, and decocted into pills, the effect is even finer.

According to the *Green Essence Formula*, *fuling* prohibits the consumption of sour flavors, but this method, which uses *fuling* exclusively, does not require such a restriction.

It is further said: The Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness transmitted the *Licorice Pill Formula of Valley Immortality* to Lady Wei of South Marchmount. In her youth, Lady Wei suffered from many illnesses. Lord Wang, while in Xiuwu County, instructed her: "Those who cultivate the Dao must first dispel illness, filling the Five Viscera to abundance, so that ears and eyes grow sharp—only then may one engage in visualization and ingestion practices."

Lord Wang first descended as a perfected being in the winter of the ninth year of *Yuan Kang* during the Jin dynasty, within the boundaries of Xiuwu County in Ji Commandery. At that time, Lady Wei was forty-eight years old. She followed his instructions and consumed the pills, and when she concealed her form and departed this world, she was eighty-three. This was in the eighth year of *Xianhe* during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Jin, the *jiawu* year—meaning Lady Wei had taken the medicine for thirty-five years. Though she did not necessarily take it continuously, she suffered no further ailments. Her prior illnesses were entirely cured; her hair did not turn white, her teeth did not fall out, her ears and eyes remained keen, and she regularly transcribed Daoist talismans by moonlight. As Lady Wei served as a Female Libationer, she still demonstrated her traces through talismans and scriptures. When engaging in visualization within her chamber, she could remain for a hundred days or several tens of days without feeling fatigue. Though she lived in the mundane world, her household affairs often disrupted her practice, so she would use seclusion in her chamber as a pretext to pursue purification, study, and recitation.

The smooth digestion and vigorous limbs—this is the efficacy of the Licorice Pill, known as the Grain Immortal Formula. When the spleen and stomach are harmonized, one can eat without harm, the skin becomes full and the essence keen, daily life is regulated, and there is no affliction of constipation or diarrhea. To attain immortality through consuming grain is why it is called the Grain Immortal. This formula was originally compiled by Right Perfected Lord Guo of the Nine Palaces, and it had long existed in various palaces. Guo later reorganized it, arranging and explaining its therapeutic applications—much like the Azure Essence, which is the method of the Grand Simplicity, yet is now attributed to the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who study the Daoist path should take this first.

In the past, Lord Shaojin transmitted this formula to Jie Xiang, and later to Liu Gen, Zhang Ling, and dozens of others, who also called this pill the Shaojin Pill. It should be prepared with fasting and purification; it is non-toxic and has no dietary restrictions. Its benefits accrue over a year, not merely in a day or night. Even laypeople may take it.

It is also said: The Cloud Mushroom Essence may be prepared without regard to auspicious days. When used to treat the Three Corpses, ingesting one dose kills the grain worms, causing the Three Corpses to wither. Daoists who regularly consume grain should take this. Once the grain worms are eradicated, one may eat grain without illness and overindulge without harm. Many medicines eliminate the corpse worms, but none surpass this.

In ancient times, Master Yang Xiu, Ji Qiuzi, Dongfang Shuo, Cui Wenzi, and Shang Qiuzi all took this medicine to harmonize with grain and attained immortality. Emperor Jing of Han and Emperor Wu sought Dongfang Shuo and Master Yang Xiu’s secret formulas, but they were never transmitted.

It is further said: Lord Juanzi of Beihai, whose given name and surname are obscure, was a disciple of the Green Lad and the master of Su Lin. In his youth, he consumed Wooden Yellow Essence and was taught the Way of Guarding the One and the Mystery Elixir, living for 2,800 years. Su Lin, styled Zixuan, a Courtier of the Dark Continent and disciple of Juanzi, was also the master of the Purple Yang. A native of Qu Shui in Puyang, he left home at the age of twenty to study the Dao. Later, he was transmitted the Three Origins and the True One, wandering and transforming among the people.

It is further said: The Perfected One of Grand Clarity and Orthodox Unity, Zhang Daoling of Pei State, was originally a great Confucian scholar. In the fourth year of the *Yanguang* era of the Han, he began to study the Dao. By the end of the Han, immortals from the Wugou Mountain descended and transmitted to him the teachings of Orthodox Unity and the Covenant of Might, along with the methods for transforming and guiding the people. He was titled the Celestial Master. This is what *True Reports* refers to as "those who serve Zhang Daoling’s Orthodox Unity and harmonize the qi." The *Preface to the Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Preface to the Grand Clarity’s Golden Liquid Elixir* by the Celestial Master are both fine works, with separate biographies already circulating in the world.

It is further said: Those who ingest the Five Minerals can eat nine meals in a day, with their hundred meridians flowing with purity, and may also go a full year without hunger, reversing aging to return to infancy. When they encounter food, they eat; when they do not, they remain at ease. This is the wondrous formula of the highest immortals and the marvelous efficacy of grain avoidance. Tao Yinju’s commentary states: Though they eat nine meals in a day, they absorb and transform the essence, leaving no residue, and though they go a year without eating, their complexion grows ever more radiant.

It is further said: In the ease of absorption and transformation, nothing surpasses the Seven Luminaries; in the swiftness of cultivation and attainment, nothing exceeds the Nine Ways; in the firmness of preservation and protection, nothing compares to *Zhensheng*; in the urgency of defense and application, nothing arises before the *Hunshen*; in the rapid efficacy of medicinal stones, what rivals *Qingjing*? In the responsiveness of prayer and worship, what excels the morning and evening offerings?

It is further said: Ingesting the Five Mineral Elixirs preserves the Five Viscera from decay.

It is further said: The nine-plumed phoenix brain, the Hidden Mushroom of the Great Ultimate, the golden liquid of the cinnabar furnace, the purple blossoms and rainbow essences, the Nine Cycles of Grand Clarity, the nectar of the Five Clouds, the white fragrance of the Eastern Sea, the azure coins of the Canglang, the lingering essence of the lofty hills, and the flying fields of the Jishi Mountains—all can bestow longevity upon people. Master Qin Gao received the Way of the Elixir for Prolonging Life and practiced the methods of replenishing the brain and reverting the elixir.

*The Upper Conclusion of the Sacred Sword* states: Those who ingest the *Eightfold Radiance Pill of the Curved Dawn of the Great Ultimate* can soar through the Great Void.

It is further said: The Perfected One of the Great Void ingested the *Cloud Teeth of the Four Poles*.

It is further said: The *Flying Dragon Cloud Paste* refines the quintessence of the Five Minerals into an ointment, bestowing a jade-like radiance upon the body and enabling one to write in the dark. This medicine surpasses the ingestion of the Eight Stones.

It is further said: Those who ingest the essence of the sun and moon should consume bamboo shoots in moderation. Bamboo shoots are the embryo of the sun’s essence, also called *Great Brightness*. They should also consume pine needles in moderation. The pine is the finest of trees, and those who ingest the sun and moon should eat these substances to harmonize with their qi. The Perfected One of the Great Void said: The pine and cypress are the finest of trees.

It is further said: The Perfected One embraces the primordial radiance of the Five Directions’ dawn and ingests the essence of the Nine Auroras. The commentary states: This refers to the primordial qi of the clear dawn and the auroral essence of the first light, where the yang number nine is called the *Nine Auroras*. The original text states: *The divine light shines inwardly, while vermilion blossoms unfold outwardly.*

*The Yellow Plain Scripture of the Supreme* states: Whenever Daoists take a meal, they should first offer it to the Great Harmony.

*The Scripture of Great Peace* states: The Green Lad gathers flying roots and swallows the radiance of the sun.

*The Numinous Chapters of the Hollow Cavern* state: At dawn, they dine on the qi of the Five Clouds; at dusk, they chant the light of the Three Dawns. It also states: They consume the amber and purple nectar of the true.

*True Reports* states: On Kunlun Mountain, there is the marrow of the Crimson Mountain and the fruit of the jade trees.

It is further said: The method of the *Purple Texts of the Numinous Writings of the Golden Gates of Supreme Clarity*—adopting the yin blossoms and swallowing the essence of the moon—was once transmitted by the Celestial Sovereign of the Great Tenuity. It is also called *The Scripture of the Yellow Qi and the Hidden Moon, the Treasury of the Sun’s Essence*.

It is further said: For all who practice the Dao, wine and meat are the greatest taboos. Wine, as a substance, can cloud the mind and confuse the will, leading to perverse and disordered behavior. Among all medicines, only the *Four Lads Pill* mentions the use of wine, though water may also be used. The *Wooden Pill* is simmered with wine, but no other texts mention ingesting medicines with wine.

It is further said: During the Later Han, Zuo Ci begged the Controller of Destinies for cinnabar and obtained twelve pounds, which he used to compound the *Ninefold Radiance Elixir*.

It is further said: Zhi Mingqi and Zhang Zhengli of the Later Han era dwelled in Mount Heng, where they received and ingested the *Rainbow Radiance Elixir* of Lord Wang, practicing it for over thirty years.

It is further said: Zhao Guangxin, a native of Yangcheng, came to Mount Kuaiji during the Wei era. He received the method of ingesting qi and guarded the Way of the Mysterious Center. Later, he ingested the *Ninefold Radiance Elixir*.

It is further said: Zhu Ruzi, a man of the Wu era, entered the Red Water Mountain, where he ingested chrysanthemum flowers and wood, and received from the Master of the Western Return the thirty-three chapters of the method for visualizing and guarding the *Niwan* within the chamber.

It is further said: Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua, both men of the early Jin, dwelled in Mount Wan, where they practiced the method of guarding the Five Viscera and containing the sun, ingesting sesame and the Mysterious Elixir.

It is further said: Ma Mingsheng of Linzi served as a county clerk. While pursuing bandits, he was wounded.

The Lady of Supreme Perfection saved him with the Numinous Origin. After his recovery, he studied under Anqisheng and received the method of ingesting the Great Clarity Elixir.

It is further said: Wang Xuanfu of Pei, together with Deng Boyuan, dwelled on Mount Huo, where they received the method of consuming the Azure Essence Stone Meal and swallowing the solar radiance.

It is further said: The *Huangshan Formula* states: In cultivating nature and ingesting medicinal substances, one should avoid eating garlic and pomegranate seeds. Daoists must not consume them. The *Biographies of the Immortals* records: Chijiang Ziju was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. He did not eat the five grains but consumed the flowers of a hundred herbs. It is further said: The Heavenly Immortal Woquan was a gatherer of herbs on Mount Huai. He favored eating pine nuts, his body grew hair, his eyes were square, and he could fly and outrun horses. It is further said: Wu Guang was a man of the Xia era. His ears were seven inches long, he loved the zither, and consumed the roots of cattail and leek. It is further said: Juanzi of Qi favored consuming wood and composed the *Canon of Heaven and Earth* in thirty-eight chapters. Later, while fishing in the marsh, he obtained a talismanic carp, retreated into Rock Mountain, and could summon wind and rain. The Nine Immortals Method of Ji Boyang was briefly obtained by the Prince of Huainan in his youth, though he could not comprehend it. Its three chapters of *Zither Heart* contain profound meaning.

It is further said: Liu Jing, a man of the Former Han, studied under Zhang Jun of Nange and received the method of ingesting mica, through which he discerned good and ill fortune.

The *Baopuzi* states: Those who cultivate the Dao, ingest medicinal substances, and retreat into the mountains must not enter lightly. Many who do so encounter harm, for the aged among the myriad beings can all manifest as spirits and often test humans. Yet they cannot alter their true form in a mirror. Thus, ancient Daoists entering the mountains always carried a bright mirror, at least nine inches in diameter, suspended behind their backs, so that old demons dared not approach. If something came to test them, they would glance into the mirror: if it appeared in human form, it was a mountain immortal or spirit; if it appeared as a bird, beast, or malevolent ghost, it would be revealed. Once, a man in a stone chamber on Mount Yuntai in Shu suddenly saw a figure clad in yellow silk and a kudzu headdress appear before him. When he looked into his mirror, it was a deer—he shouted, and it turned into a deer and fled. There was also an inn at the foot of Mount Linlü where travelers often died or fell ill. Every night, a dozen or so figures—some in white, some in black, some men, some women—would appear. Later, Nie Boyi lodged there, sitting with a bright candle. At midnight, they indeed appeared. Secretly observing them in the mirror, he saw they were straw dogs. Boyi then seized the candle and pretended to drop its ember on their clothing, smelling scorched fur. He drew his blade and slew one dog, and the rest fled in terror.

When entering the mountains, one must select an auspicious day. The *Baopuzi* states: The conditions of heaven and earth, the fortunes of yin and yang—these are vast and difficult to fathom. I do not insist they exist, nor dare I guarantee their absence. Yet the Yellow Emperor and Lü Wang both trusted and submitted to them, and in recent times, Yan Junping and Sima Qian both relied upon them. The classics and histories record the origins of hard and auspicious days. The kings, the Grand Scribe, and the officials of the Feng and Bao sacrifices—when they performed ancestral rites, suburban offerings, and sacrifices to heaven and earth—they all selected their days. According to the *Jade Chime Classic*: Those who wish to enter the mountains must know the secrets of *Dunjia*, though I shall not expound upon its intricacies for others.

End of Scroll Thirteen of the Daoist Canon
Beginning of Scroll Fourteen

The *Scriptures of Transcendents* state: The Nine-Transmutation Elixir, the *Golden Liquid Classic*, and the *Secrets of Guarding the One* are all concealed within the Five Cities of Kunlun, stored in jade cases, inscribed on golden tablets, sealed with purple clay, and stamped with the central seal.

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* says: I have heard Master Zheng speak of the most revered Daoist texts, none surpassing the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. In ancient times, transcendents and those who recorded their deeds held these in utmost secrecy—this Way was not transmitted except to those bearing the name of transcendents. Once received, it was passed on only once every forty years. The transmission was marked in cinnabar and sealed with an oath, binding trust as a covenant. All the famous mountains and the Five Peaks safeguard these texts, yet they are hidden in secluded stone chambers. Those destined for the Dao who enter the mountains and meditate with utmost sincerity will find the mountain spirits opening the way, revealing the texts like silk unfurling. This is how Zhongli obtained them in the mountains.

Those who possess these texts must maintain purity. Before any action, they must first report to them as if serving a sovereign or father. The scriptures say: Those who hold the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns* repel evil spirits, plagues, and misfortunes. Next in rank is the *Hidden Subtleties of the Jade Maiden*, a single scroll that can transform one’s form into flying dragons, various beasts, gold, jade, wood, or stone, and summon clouds and rain—this too is a great art, surpassing even the *Hongbao* and *Wanbi* texts of Huainan.

Master Zheng was profoundly learned in the Five Classics and was one who understood the Dao. He mastered the Nine Palaces and Three Boards, calculated the celestial movements of the world, and aligned the *He* and *Luo* with prophecies and apocrypha. In the first year of the Taihe era, foreseeing the chaos of the Jichen rebellion and the coming turmoil in Jiangnan, he carried his satchel of immortal medicines and entered Mount Huo to the east, unknown to all.

It is also said: Those whose homes hold the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* are shielded from harm, and no one can injure them. Further, it is said: The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, sages of profound insight, revealed secret texts in famous mountains and received immortal scriptures from divine beings. They cast off the dust of the world to shed burdens, soaring to the distant heights, their lifespans equaling gold, stone, tortoises, and cranes. Moved by those of future generations who aspire to the Dao and pitying the unenlightened, they left behind methods, clearly and brilliantly recorded. Yet the shallow-minded, clinging to their narrow views, delight in emptiness and drown in mediocrity. They know that excess in food and drink hastens illness yet cannot restrain themselves; they know that indulgence in passions leads to ruin yet cannot sever them. If even transcendence is attainable, how can they believe it?

According to the *Scriptures of Transcendents*, those who attain transcendence do so because their destinies align with the qi of immortality, naturally perceiving it. Thus, from the moment of conception, they already bear the nature of the Dao. If their awakened minds incline toward such matters, they will inevitably encounter an enlightened master and obtain the method. Otherwise, they will neither believe nor seek, and even if they seek, they will not find.

A lifespan of a hundred years spans over thirty thousand days. In youth, one knows nothing; in old age, joy and pleasure fade. Subtracting the years of childhood, senility, and dotage, along with the ceaseless succession of dangers, hardships, and illnesses, barely half of one’s years in the world remain. For most, a lifespan barely reaches fifty or sixty—alas!—and after accounting for grief, sorrow, and the decline of age, only six or seven thousand days remain. In the blink of an eye, they are gone. As for those who live a full hundred years, not one in ten thousand achieves it. Reflecting deeply, one cannot but pity them, no different from the summer insects or morning mushrooms. This is the profound sorrow of those who understand the Dao.

The *Supreme Jade Writ of the Great Night* says: The Dao is originally formless, yet in response to perception, images arise. The great image is without image, its subtlety difficult to fathom. Thus, when true texts are seen, they coalesce in emptiness to form characters.

It further says: The *Inner Talismans of the Numinous Treasure*, secret texts of the Supreme Transcendent, were bestowed upon Emperor Yu by the Nine Heavens’ True Kings and the Three Heavens’ True Sovereigns, hidden in the northern valley of Mount Zhong. When Yu the Great completed his regulation of the waters, he journeyed to Mount Zhong, where the transcendent of the mountain transmitted them to him.

Yu returned to Kuaiji and further compiled and finalized them into two copies. One copy was concealed in the □ of Miaoshan, to emerge only after ten thousand kalpas. The other was transcribed on silk and entrusted to the Cloud-Water Grotto Chamber, to be delivered at the jia-shen epoch to those such as Fu Bochang, who governed the waters.

It further says: In the twelfth year of King Helü of Wu, during the first month, he dispatched the Elder of Dragon Might to enter the Dongting Grotto of Baoshan and retrieve it, bringing forth talismans but no explanations.

Moreover, the Qi native Le Zichang received it from the Immortal of Huolin, Han Zhong, who then expounded the methods of ingestion and application, concealing them in the northern chamber beneath the Eastern Sea.

The *Scripture of the Golden Liquid of the Great One*, according to the *Preface to the Sword Scripture*, states: Gaoqiuzi ingested the golden liquid water. The *Records of the Grand Scribe* say: In preparing the golden elixir, the intent all refers to this method. Today, there exists Ge Hong’s commentary on the *Yellow Silk Writ* of Xi Yin, along with a separate formula in one scroll. This is also the supreme cinnabar method of the Great Clarity.

The *Concealed Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* says: Master Yang and Attendant Xu jointly transcribed the *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber* on small azure stationery. It also says: in seal script on white hemp paper. It further says: The *Scriptures of the Eight Silks* were personally inscribed by the Sage Lord using white silk and brushes of eight colors.

The *Scripture of Numinous Writs* says: In the ancient era of Longhan, the Supreme Sage inscribed the wondrous scriptures and true writs of the Numinous Treasure upon the azure forests of empty space, revealing the methods to deliver humanity.

The *Scripture of the Golden Root* says: The Golden Lad of the Great Yang and the Jade Maiden of the Great Yin attend the purple script of the supreme method. It further says: The Jade Maiden of Xihua guards the *Scripture of the Hidden Moon* in the Immortal Capital.

The *Hidden Instructions of the Flying Dragon’s Plain Silk* says: The Heavenly Thearch commanded the Feathered Immortal Attendant to hold a golden tablet and request the scriptures.

The *True Reports* says: The *Inner Instructions of the Nine Perfected of the Supreme Clarity* were compiled by the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Red Pine. It further says: The *Jade Tablet Inscription of Central Huayang* states: "Cultivate and preserve the Three Primes’ Grotto; I, the Jade Writ, govern the Eight Elders and the Twenty-Four Perfected. Without sleep, inwardly contemplate—these are the essential words of immortality."

It further says: The *Scripture of Treasuring the Spirits* is the text from the brocade pouch of the Perfected Lord Pei Qingxu. It is what attendants constantly carry. Formerly, Pei received this book from the Lady of Purple Tenuity.

It further says: At the western terrace above the northern altar of the Dark Garden, all the secret writs of the Heavenly Perfected are contained within. It further says: The Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers, along with the Lady of Purple Tenuity and the Lady Wei of Southern Marchmount, descended together. After sitting for a long while, the Perfected Consort commanded her attendant to open her brocade pouch and present two scrolls to Master Yang: one, the *Hidden Book of Inner Contemplation Illumined by Jade Radiance and Purple Glow of the Supreme Clarity*; the other, the *Book of the Supreme Clarity on Returning to Dawn and the Sun’s Brilliance amid the Central Mystery*. These are the scriptures of the Three Primes and Eight Assemblies. After Master Yang thoroughly mastered the true characters, he rendered them in clerical script for clarity.

The Dao possesses the *Eight Silk True Scriptures*, the hidden writings of the Supreme Lord. There are also the *Nine Perfected Central Scriptures*, the secret words of the Old Lord. The *Yellow Writ* is also an essential formula for longevity. The *Azure Essentials* and *Purple Scripts*, the *Golden Root* and *Multitudinous Writs*, the *True Instructions of Jade Clarity*, the *Three-Nine Plain Words* and *Cinnabar Scenery Dao Essence*, the *Eight Trees Hidden in Earth*, the *White Tallies* and *Azure Registers*, the *Purple Transmission* and *Flame Elder*—these are all scriptures of the Dao.

There are also the *Seven Steps of the Flying Prime*, the *Scriptures of the Heavenly Net*, the *Seven Transformations of Divine Methods*, the *Scriptures of the Seven Revolutions*. Moreover, the *True Scripture of the Great Grotto* in thirty-nine chapters, the *Hidden Writ of the Great Cinnabar* in eight principles and ten formulas, the *Three Diagrams of the Heavenly Pass*, the *Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees*, the *Nine Elixirs* and *Golden Liquid Divine Cinnabar*, the *Hidden Zhi of the Great Ultimate*, the *Secret Talismans of the Five Agents*, the *Formulas of the Curved Silk and Plain Words*, the *Yellow Water and Moon Radiance*, the *Jade Essence of Returning Water*, the *Azure Bloom of Water Yang*, the *Crimson Tree and Azure Fruit*, the *Cinnabar of Langgan Blossoms*, the *Celestial Sovereign’s Image Talismans* to harmonize the primordial qi, the *White Feather and Purple Canopy* to wander the Five Marchmounts, the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* to summon the spirits of heaven and earth, the *Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings* to ascend the Great Ultimate, the *Plain Memorials and Cinnabar Talismans* to summon the Six Jia, the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance* to illuminate the world, the *Eight Sceneries’ Chariot* to traverse the Great Clarity, the *Wings of Flight* to transcend the void.

Liu Xiang’s *Accounts of the Transcendents* says: The *Accounts of the Transcendents* was compiled by Liu Xiang, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness of the Han. Initially, Emperor Wu favored the masters of methods, and Prince An of Huainan also gathered retainers, possessing the *Grand Treasure in the Pillow* scriptures. Earlier, Prince An plotted rebellion and was executed; Xiang’s father, De, was appointed by Emperor Wu to adjudicate the Huainan case and obtained those books. Xiang, though young, read them and found them extraordinary. When Emperor Xuan ascended the throne, he revived Emperor Wu’s precedents, and Xiang, along with Wang Bao and others, was advanced for his erudition and outstanding talent to attend the emperor’s side. Xiang also saw Huainan’s alchemical trees and memorialized that gold could be refined. The emperor ordered Xiang and the Director of the Imperial Workshop to refine gold, but the expenses were great and the results unverified, leading to his indictment and a sentence of death. His elder brother, the Marquis of Anyang, Anmin, petitioned to surrender half his state’s households to ransom Xiang’s crime. The emperor, admiring his talent, commuted his sentence to death and appointed him Gentleman of the Yellow Gates, lecturing on the Five Classics at the Stone Canal. By the time of Emperor Cheng, Xiang, having been placed in charge of the imperial archives, observed the emperor’s keen interest in matters of spirit immortality and thus compiled accounts of such affairs from high antiquity through the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han, drawing from various traditions.

The *Account of King Mu’s Journey to Heaven* says: He ascended the slopes of Kunlun to view the palace of the Yellow Emperor, observing the fasts and rites to sacrifice at Dengchong Mountain, which is the Dark Garden. The Kunlun Mountain spans two thousand li square, with a nine-tiered citadel called the Gate Wind Dark Garden.

The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: Resplendent is Kunlun, the Dark Garden above it. King Mu inscribed a stele at the Dark Garden to illuminate later generations. The Son of Heaven feasted with the Queen Mother of the West atop the Jasper Pool, and the Queen Mother sang, "White clouds in the sky." Thereupon, the Son of Heaven ascended the Yanzi Mountain, where the sun sets, and recorded his traces at Qishan.

The *Account of Mao Ying* says: The Queen Mother said to Mao Ying: "The Jade..."

The Way of the Golden Pendants, the *Canon of the Supreme Ultimate and Mysterious Perfection*—those who master it may soar through the Great Void. The Queen Mother commanded Wang Zongzhen of the Western Citadel to expound the *Canon of Mysterious Perfection* in full. She further elucidated the *Canon of the Golden Pendants*, transmitting it orally to Ying, saying: "The Golden Pendants are the radiant canopy of the Supreme Clarity, the inner perfected jade ornaments of the Yin luminants. The Most High’s hidden and wondrous *Flying Cavern* reveals them; those who attain its treasure scriptures ascend to the Cloud Han, recline in the Supreme Ultimate, and hear the words of the Primordial Celestial Constancy. These are the esoteric writings of the Two Luminants of the Great Night, the jade ornaments and Golden Pendants.

There are also the inner true talismans of the Yin and Yang luminants, which accompany the original text. By the Most High’s decree, they are to be transmitted only to the Directors of Destinies. O jade tablet of mysterious potency, inscribed in green characters on gold, its yellow radiance illumines the inner brilliance; the plain script of the Supreme Clarity—you shall be appointed as the Lord Director of Destinies. Yet without first comprehending the Way of the Mysterious Perfection of the Luminous Hall, one cannot obtain the esoteric writings of the Great Night.

The Way of Mysterious Perfection is the method of consuming the sun and moon, the art of refining the Five Spirits. Its canon states:
*Supreme Mystery beyond mystery,
Dual spirits and Fourfold Clarity,
Mysterious Perfection illumines within,
Luminous Hall purifies without.
Swallow the breath of the Two Radiance,
Eternally vitalize the divine essence.
Ascend to assist the Directors of Destinies,
Overseeing and governing the myriad spirits.*"

The Sixfold Splendors overflow, penetrating the gaze of the Yellow Tranquility. These forty characters were engraved by the Most High upon the southern gate of Phoenix Terrace. They are not taught to those who are not disciples of the Perfected Assembly, nor transmitted to any but the most eminent of the Lords of Destinies.

The True Officers of the Most High employ the Way of the Sun’s Rosy Clouds and embrace the method of the Twofold Radiance, enabling communion with the numinous and attainment of the true, their bodies suffused with jade-like luminosity. They command the myriad spirits and ascend to the Celestial Chambers. In former times, the Perfected Lord of Bell Mountain used this Mysterious Perfection method. When Lord Wang bestowed it upon Ying, he returned to the Western City and, following the true instructions, practiced it for three years. His countenance took on the luster of jade. Later, Lord Wang further granted Ying the Nine-Turned Returning Elixir and a prescription, establishing an altar and forming a covenant with the oath that it must not be transmitted or revealed. He then sent Ying home with these words: “After a hundred years, seek me upon the Southern Marchmount, and I shall appoint you to a celestial office in the realm of Hao and Yue.”

Thereafter, Ying attained immortality and dwelt upon Mount Gouqu, whereupon the people renamed it the Mountain of Lord Mao. When Lord Mao’s two younger brothers heard of Ying’s achievement, they at last believed in the reality of immortals. They abandoned their official posts, crossed the river, and sought out their elder brother. Upon meeting, he revealed to them the true instructions. After eighteen years, their Way was accomplished. He then required them to undergo three further years of purification, after which he transmitted the supreme method, instructing them to cultivate the qi of the Luminous Hall and Mysterious Perfection. Only then did Ying report to Lord Wang, recounting how his brothers had obtained the method of becoming earthbound immortals. They were to receive the registers, wear the talismans of the True Ultimate, and be invested with authority.

Lord Wang bestowed upon them the Mysterious Water and Jade Elixir, the Vermilion Sun’s Cinnabar Mushroom, instructing the brothers to purify themselves for three months before consuming them. Ying then commanded a carriage to convey his brothers to Green Isle to inscribe their names upon the golden tablets. They journeyed next to the Grotto Palace of the Western City to pay homage to the Supreme Minister of the Perfected Assembly, then southward to the Vermilion Terrace of Mount Heng to visit the Red Perfected of the Great Void. Upon returning, they sought the strategies of the Two Earthbound Immortals from the Square Cauldron, then proceeded to Red City to receive the True Talismans of Spirit Transformation. They traveled onward to Mount Luo and Huo to obtain embroidered banners of floral streamers, then ascended to the Nine Palaces and presented themselves beneath the Golden Portals, where they received the scriptures of the Sagely Lord. For three months, they prostrated themselves at the gate.

Thereupon, the Sagely Lord commanded the Supreme Minister of the Ninefold Subtlety and Great Perfection, the High Auroral Master and Green Lad, to ascend and petition the Most High. The Vermilion-Crowned Messenger was sent down to invest the two brothers beneath the Golden Portals, bestowing upon them the true tablets before their return.

It is said: The scriptures of divine immortality on the methods of the Yellow and the White comprise twenty-five scrolls and over a thousand chapters. Yet most are profoundly abstruse and difficult to comprehend; only a few can be clearly understood. The worldly often doubt these matters as mere fantasy, no different from those who disbelieve in immortals altogether. In former times, I received from Master Zheng the Nine Elixirs and the Scripture of the Golden Liquid, and subsequently sought from him five scrolls on the methods of the Yellow and the White. Master Zheng recounted how he and Zuo Ci had tested these methods in the Copper Mountains of Lujiang, and all had succeeded. Yet the rigor of purification and the strictness of the prohibitions were no less demanding than those required for compounding the Nine Elixirs of divine immortality.

Vulgar folk often ridicule me for my pursuit of esoteric arts, accusing me of forcing comprehension upon what the world deems incomprehensible. Yet how do the water and fire obtained through the Square Cauldron differ from ordinary water and fire? Both arise from natural resonance, and without plumbing the principles to their depths and exhausting the nature of things, one cannot fathom their ultimate significance. Without tracing origins and grasping ends, one cannot apprehend their true conditions.

Wu Taiwen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was learned and widely knowledgeable. He too recounted past experiences: the Daoist Li Gen had achieved success with certain woods, yet could not obtain the specific wood he sought unless one observed a hundred days of purification. Taiwen, then serving in office, could not fulfill this requirement and often sighed, lamenting the insufficiency of human inquiry.

The *Statutes of the Great Perfection* states: The King of the Lesser Heaven of Pure Emptiness compiled the *Scripture of the Unification of the Three Heavens*.

The *Scripture of the Golden Liquid* says: The *August Scripture of the Primordial Chaos* was presented to the Vermilion Auroral Perfected of the Supreme Truth and sealed within a jade casket. The greatness of the supreme Way accords with the celestial charts; the essential words of the Three Elixirs are recorded by the Supreme August, hidden within the Jade Hall, and their purport must not be transmitted.

The *Scripture of the Great Perfection and Mysterious Elixir* was engraved within the Hall of Pure Emptiness; it is the treasured text of the Supreme August Lord, called the Elixir of Purple Stamens and Luminous Pearls. It reveals the cycles of transformation, blending and distinguishing all things. As yin and yang undergo repeated changes, the Way arises naturally. The Mysterious Chart revolves seven times, returning upon the ninth. The first chapter of the Great Yellow is called the Jade Void. The Perfected of the Supreme Truth preserve it, naming it the Primordial Scripture.

The *Jade Scripture of the Cavern Perfection* of the Supreme Clarity states: The Eightfold Radiance of the Most High was engraved upon the Immortal Terrace of the Eastern Flower, and not proclaimed to the world. Those who receive the Ninefold Yin Instructions of the Lord of Emperors swear an oath with white silk and crimson offerings—this is the oath of the sun’s brilliance. Those who receive the Neighbor-Bonding Chapters of the Most High swear with azure offerings—this is the oath of the moon’s splendor.

The *Mysterious Scripture of the Cavern Perfection of the Lord of the Great One* says: Within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies of the Most High, Jade Maidens attend and guard the Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir.

The *Inner Biography of Ma Mingsheng* states: The Celestial Writings of the Numinous Treasure were sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the Palace of Great Existence, where the Golden Auroral Jade Maidens and the Purple Lads of the Auroral Dawn safeguard them.

The *Scripture of the Eightfold Radiance of Jade Light* says: The Jade Auroral Lads of the Golden Flower attend and guard the *Scripture of the Eightfold Radiance of Jade Light*.

The *Yellow Writ of the Most High* says: Those who read the Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir within the Golden Flower Grotto and the Precious Chapters of the Feminine One are able to consume the flavor of the Mysterious Perfection, encounter all things without obstruction, and summon the Great Simplicity. The Nine Perfected descend in response, and one is thereby entitled to be called a Master of the Three Primordials’ Elixir Methods, presiding over the Perfected of the Supreme Truth.

The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* says: Within the Terrace of the Flowery Terrace of the Western Mystery Mountain are the *Scriptures of the Majestic Sun* and *Neighbor-Bonding*. The jade tablets bear golden characters inscribed with a green brush, recording the Three Primordials upon the Jade Tablets of the Upper Primordial.

The *Later Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: The Jade Lads of the Western Numinous reside upon the Terrace of Enduring Cold, attending and guarding the *Jade Registers of the Eightfold Radiance*.

The *Arrayed Records of the Later Sagely Lord* says: The Turtle Mother wielded the brush, and the Jade Lads bound the compilation, naming it the *Upper Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Numinous Book*.

The *Inner Sounds of the Three August Ones* says: When inscribing the talismanic characters of these inner sounds, use a yellow brush to form the script in seal, clerical, or tadpole characters, recording the origins of creation and the beginnings of human relations.

The *Writ of the Northern Emperor from the Six Palaces of Fengdu* states: The life and death of humans are carved by the Jade Emperor in hidden inscriptions upon stone, recorded on the northern walls of the Six Palaces to restrain and govern malevolent forces. It further says: The hidden stone inscriptions are transcribed onto a three-foot length of green silk before being worn, whereupon the myriad spirits pay homage—this is the Way of remote antiquity. It also says: Within the caverns of Mount Fengdu, the Jade Emperor’s hidden inscriptions comprise ninety-one words, carved upon stone and recorded in the Six Palaces of the Grotto-Heaven of Mount Fengdu. The northern walls of the Six Palaces are the numinous abode of the myriad spirits. It further says: The *Hidden Writ of the Cavern Radiance of Golden Mystery* from the Jade Clarity is carved in hidden stone inscriptions, its sounds emerging from the chapters of spontaneity. The Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens are profound and recondite, beyond the comprehension of beginners or ordinary mortals, nor may their mysteries be fully expounded save by the descent of the Great Emperor.

The *Scripture of the Golden Root* also states: Those who cultivate the Golden Mystery must wear the hidden inscriptions. The *Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages of the Jade Emperor* says: Those whose names are inscribed in the Upper Clarity are all recorded in the *Dark Garden*, thereby attaining the perfection of Great Peace. Thus, the Most High’s proclamations are inscribed in jade script, not to be conveyed by bamboo slips, brush, or ink.

The *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity* says: The Dark Feather Jade Lad bestowed the *Dark Feather Supreme Jade Scripture* upon the guests of the Highest Jade Worthies of the Three Primordials of Grand Simplicity. It further says: The Radiant Jade Lads reside in the Gates of Numinous Radiance and the Chambers of Rosy Mist, attending and guarding the hidden writings of the Jade Grace of the August Highest and the Jade Clarity.

Here ends the Fourteenth Section of the Daoist Canon. Latter Part of the Immortal Scriptures.

The *Seven Sages’ Mysterious Record of the Jade Emperor* states: The ancient texts comprise one hundred thousand jade words, which none but the highest sages can fathom in intent. They are inscribed in the Hall of Kunlun and the Source of the Northern Grotto. It further says: Within the Chamber of Kunlun and the Perfected of the Northern Grotto, the source winds through the Nine Yi Celestial Nights, where white slips and azure records reside.

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* says: Above the Nine Capitals, golden tablets and jade writings jointly inscribe the names of those who attain the Dao, enduring through kalpas. It further says: Within the Purple Orchid Terrace, the jade script of purple characters lies.

The *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* states: The Western Chamber of Tortoise Mountain and the Southern Grotto of Wangwu Mountain contain the complete celestial scriptures. It further says: The Three Qi of the Jade Clarity’s Grotto-Chambers are sealed with golden chapters within the Purple Gates of the Jade Capital. It further says: The jade registers and treasured writings are concealed within the nine gates of the Purple Chamber.

The *Feminine One Scripture of the Great Grotto* says: There is a Dark-Lin Jade Palace where the Five Elders guard the Upper Scripture Repository within. It further says: The *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* are sealed in the Golden Portal and Purple Terrace. It further says: The *Scripture of Radiant Perfection* is secretly kept in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, upon the Seven-Treasured Terrace of Golden Radiance. There is also the Three Treasures Mystic Terrace, wherein the *Hidden Writ of the Upper Clarity* is concealed.

The *Concealed Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: Within the Upper Clarity’s Immortal Terrace, the golden script resides; within the Ninefold Mystic Terrace of the Grand Ultimate, the jade-slip writings lie; within the Bright Hall of the Mystic Tortoise Terrace of the August Perfected, the *Mystic Perfected Scripture* is kept. It further says: The Jasper Terrace of Kunlun, the Palace of the Queen Mother of the West—this is the Upper Jasper Terrace where the celestial perfected’s secret writings are preserved.

The *Golden Script and Jade Characters Upper Scripture* says: Within the Western Mystic Terrace, the *Golden Script Grotto-Chamber Scripture* is held. It further says: The destiny of one’s bones is already determined in the Mystic Pavilion’s green characters, for those whose names are inscribed in the immortal registers are predestined.

The *Cavernous Mystery Scripture* states: There is a Primordial Yang Terrace within the Heaven of Ruan Le, where the Inner Sound Writings are kept. It further says: A three-tiered jade terrace stands above the Nine Heavenly Gates, upon which rest three hundred volumes of the *Treasure Scripture of the Grand Clarity* and the registers of perfected ones learning immortality, overseen by the Jade Controller of the Celestial Thearch’s Perfected Oversight. It further says: The Jasper Terrace, where the Highest Thearch conceals the Golden Mystic Feather Chapters, holds the hidden sounds of the myriad spirits within its purple writings.

The *Golden Root Scripture* says: All who study must diligently uphold arduous resolve, whereupon the Jade Emperor of the Three Primordials and the Supreme of Eastern Florescence shall dispatch perfected ones to bestow upon them the true scriptures. None among the later sages and perfected ones fail first to present golden slips to Eastern Florescence and submit jade tablets to the Upper Clarity before receiving the *True Scripture of the Great Grotto*. Yet if the Azure Palace lacks the register of golden slips and the jade tablets bear no name in the mystic records, then even the divine scriptures cannot be bestowed.

The *Golden Root Scripture* says: Unfolding the cloud-phoenix’s brocade and the purple-silk pouch, one reveals the purple-written true instructions and jade chapters.

The *Scripture of Great Possession* states: The Imperial Minister holds the *True Scripture of the Great Grotto*, encased in a purple jade casket. It further says: The Lord of the Grand One holds the *Mysterious Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery and Great Possession*, encased in a yellow jade casket. It further says: The *Scripture of Great Possession* is written in gold-threaded jade characters to illuminate its chapters. It further says: The wondrous *Scripture of Great Possession* and the nine perfected statutes are examined and sealed within the golden repository and jade coffer.

The *Catalogue of the Feminine One of the Great Grotto* says: The *True Scripture of the Great Grotto* resides above the Nine Heavens, in the Great Possession Palace’s Terrace of the Grand Mystic. It further says: Within the Flowery Jade Hall, the Golden Elixir of the Immortal Mother lies, chasing the two luminaries of sun and moon.

The *Hidden Writ* states: Beneath the Western Mystic Mountain, within the Terrace of the Flowery Tower, lies the *Scripture of Yu Yi’s Neighboring Knots*. The Central Void of Wangwu Mountain also holds this scripture, though incomplete. Only in the High Terrace of the Supreme Thearch’s Mystic Palace and the Northern Chamber of Penglai Prefecture, where golden pillars and jade walls are inscribed, is it fully preserved.

The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* says: The Supreme Thearch declares: All perfected ones who receive the *Eight Simplicities Scripture of the Mystic Clarity* possess the catalogue of the Supreme Thearch. Only those destined to become perfected ones, as recorded in the jade slips of the Western Florescence Palace’s aquatic writings, may obtain this text. It further says: Upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Dark Garden and north of the Accumulated Stones, the *True Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* is kept.

The *Primordial Record of Tortoise Mountain* states: The Crimson August Flying Mystic Purple Writ of Tortoise Mountain is treasured and concealed by the Queen Mother of the West. Its purport is profoundly recondite, and none without an immortal name may approach its catalogue. Those who obtain it have their names inscribed in the celestial registers of Tortoise Mountain. It further says: Within the Jade Flower Chamber, the Crimson Radiance Jade Writ lies.

The *Flying Feather Scripture* says: Within the Golden Terrace Chamber of Mount Emei, the *Flying Mystic Feather Scripture* is concealed. It further says: The Supreme Thearch’s *Flying Scripture* is hidden in the Sevenfold Radiant Purple Terrace of the Upper Clarity’s Upper Palace.

It further says: Within the Terrace of the Morning Lamp, the *Flying Heavenly Register Writ* is kept, illuminating the heights of the Nine Heavens. It further says: Within the Golden Casement Terrace, the *Three Primordials Jade Registers* are inscribed. It further says: Within the Phoenix-Born Terrace, the *Golden Writ of the Supreme Perfected* lies.

The *Golden Slips and Jade Characters Scripture* says: There is a Yang Terrace of the Cavernous Heavens, wherein the *Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings Scripture* is kept.

The *Cavernous Radiance Golden Mystery Scripture* states: None but those whose names are recorded in the celestial charts and jade registers of the Thearch may hear or behold this scripture. Those who do so ascend as flying immortals of the Upper Clarity.

The *Dharma Wheel Scripture* says: The Supreme One Perfected of the Grand Mystic declared: In the past, I received the *Eight Gates Scripture of the Supreme Thearch of the Boundless* from the Lord of the Grand Dao of the Supreme Ultimate. After attaining the Dao, my rank was elevated to that of a perfected one.

Here the text unfolds in sacred continuity with the primordial:

This scripture shares its birth with the Primordial Beginning, enfolding heaven and earth, enduring through kalpas uncounted. None but those bearing the immortal’s seal may transmit it without transgression.

The *Celestial Terrestrial Compendium Scripture* states: The Supreme Jade Scriptures and Hidden Writings are all enshrined in separate caskets.

The *Roadside Scripture* says: Within the Eastern Well’s Flowery Grove Hall of the Cavernous Heavens, the *Inner Tone Jade Scripture* rests above.

The *Great Possession Scripture* declares: The Supreme Mystery Numinous Terrace holds the *Nine Perfected Luminous Regulations of the Mystic Capital* within.

The *Flying Dragon Hidden Instructions* records: The *Feathered Flight Scripture* is sealed in the Golden Chamber of Mount Emei’s summit.

The *Transmission of Daoist Learning* recounts: Within the cavernous chamber stand a golden city and jade mansion, where the true writ resides.

The *Inner Instructions of the Nine Perfected of the Upper Clarity* reveals: The Supreme Palace’s Loftiest Terrace bears the *Supreme Jade Dawn’s Yuyi Pounding Mortar Red Jade Writ* and the *Supreme Jade Dawn’s Jielin Pounding Moon Yellow Radiance Jade Chapter*—these two scriptures inscribed upon jade slips in golden characters.

The *Inner Tone Jade Character Scripture* states: The *Inner Tone* is sealed within the stone coffer of the Southern River’s cavernous chamber.

The *Five Talismans Scripture* says: The *Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ* is sealed in a stone coffer.

The *Jade Instructions Scripture* records: The Southern Garden’s Cinnabar Fire River holds a cavernous chamber of the Three Origins, where jade coffers bear sealed inscriptions.

The *Demon-Dispelling Scripture* notes: A cache of immortal scriptures lies hidden in a desolate mountain, testing the hearts of the common.

The *Heaven-and-Earth Likeness Chapter* recounts: During the reign of Emperor Shun of the Later Han, a hundred fascicles of divine immortal scriptures were discovered above the springs of Quyang. Seventy fascicles within were inscribed on white silk with vermilion borders and azure headings in cinnabar script, titled *The Azure Dao’s Hidden Practice of the Supreme Peace*.

The Solar Orbital Generation Lord Sima Sheng bestowed upon Wu Commandery’s Shen Xi a text inscribed on white jade tablets with azure jade borders in cinnabar jade characters.

It further states: The *Upper Clarity* is written in cinnabar-gold script, demarcated with purple gold.

The *Three Origins Perfected Unity Scripture* says: The Chamber of Jasper Radiance holds the esoteric methods of the Three Origins’ Perfected Unity within.

The *Jade Radiance Eight Effulgences Scripture* declares: The Golden Splendor Purple Palace enshrines the *Golden Perfected Jade Radiance Eight Effulgences Scripture* within.

The *Biography of Lord Mao* recounts: The Golden Terrace seals the *Inner Scripture of the Supreme Perfected* within.

The *Three Daoist Sequences Scripture* says: The Southern Cavern’s chamber holds the *Three Daoist Scriptures* sealed by Lord Wang within.

The *Mystic Perfection Scripture* proclaims: The wondrous Dao of the Lofty Mystery and the secret chapters of the Jade Clarity are all bestowed upon those of golden names and jade characters—lofty immortals.

The *Nine Perfected Central Scripture* reveals: The Way of Racing Sun and Moon, the *Supreme Upper Clarity*, the *Great Ultimate Nine August Ones*, and the treasured secrets of the Four Bureau Perfected Ones are the jade chapters of the Mystic Origin Lord. None but those bearing golden watchtower jade names or Eastern Florescence purple characters may hear or behold them. These are the titles of the two chapters: *Yuyi Racing the Sun* and *Jielin Racing the Moon*.

The *Three Origins’ Dispensation Scripture* states: The *Supreme Treasure-Sealed Jade Slips of the Southern Culmen* remain unseen by those without mystic names or imperial charts, who cannot glimpse their fascicles.

The *Golden Feather Mystic Chapter Scripture*—this text remains hidden, untransmitted in the world. None but those bearing Orchid Terrace cinnabar characters may see or hear it.

The *Numinous Guest Perfected Unity Instructions* says: The *Cavernous Mystery Natural Scripture*, whose original text issues from the Supreme Dao, is boundless in its subtle intricacy, formless in its wondrous subtlety.

*Laozi* declares: Nothing in the world is more supple and weak than qi; nothing is more supple and weak than the Dao. That by which the Dao is supple and weak enfolds heaven, earth, and the myriad things. For the supple gives birth to the firm, and the weak gives birth to the strong—yet none in the world know the root from which they arise. Thus, being arises from non-being as its mother; non-being arises from emptiness as its mother; emptiness arises from the Dao as its mother. The natural is the root of the Dao. If one can take the natural as the true Dao, then the Dao may be attained and penetrated.

The *Supreme Scripture* states: The Dao is truly formless, hidden as the root of transformation. Scriptures possess written words, manifest as the beginnings of teaching. Masters possess embodied speech, whose comings and goings become the method. Speech and silence follow the moment—this is preservation at its finest. The goal is to reach the Dao through the white scriptures and the master. Master, scripture, and Dao are called the Three Treasures.

It further says: The root of transformation has three: the Dao, the scripture, and the master. The Great Dao is formless; scriptures serve as its steps. The scriptural texts are profound and wondrous, beyond the ken of the common. The sagely descend as masters to reveal the essential instructions to humanity.

*Laozi* says: The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good. The worthy obtain it and regard it as their true treasure; the foolish obtain it yet dare not lose the Dao. The Dao has no constant technique; virtue has no constant method. The spirit has no constant form; harmony has no constant appearance. The Dao is the central master, befriending stillness.

It further states: The *Nine-Writ Dragon Radiance* and *Purple Phoenix Vermilion Script* of ancient texts are stored within the Supreme Six Harmonies’ Purple Chamber, attended by heaven’s people.

The *Supreme Tenuity Yellow Writ Scripture* says: The Heavenly Perfected Three August Ones concealed the *Eightfold Assemblage* texts upon Mount Wei Yu, while the Supreme Tenuity Heavenly Thearch concealed one copy upon Mount Gui. These numinous writings of the Eightfold Assemblage possess no fixed character forms; their profundities are exhaustively pursued yet difficult to fathom in detail. They are called heavenly scriptures, naturally and utterly true. The qi of these Eightfold Assemblages harmonizes the fivefold tones—none but the most profound can fully comprehend them. The Heavenly Perfected August Person exhausted his vision to annotate their meaning. The Eightfold Assemblages’ many texts establish heaven and earth, inaugurate the transformation of humans and spirits, serve as the root of the myriad things, and govern the summoning of the Nine Heavens. The Celestial Thearch verifies and settles the charts and registers of divine immortals, administers the heavens’ divisions, pacifies states and quiets the people, restrains and commands Dengdu, subdues demons and vanquishes ghosts, commands the Water Thearch of kalpic destiny, and summons dragons to ascend the clouds. They discuss the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth, distinguish the names and clans of sagely perfected ones, and govern the manifold affairs of city towers and terraces. Their principles are broadly proclaimed, distinguishing the five directions’ primordial essences, the methods of ingesting and employing them to seek immortality and transform the body—all expounded through the wondrous subtlety of the natural, the emptiness of the correct and true, whose marvelous purport is luminous and complete.

Moreover, there are the *Jade Instructions*, wherein the Perfected of Heavenly Truth expound and elucidate the celestial script of the Eightfold Assemblies, establishing them as the correct intonation.

There are also the *Numinous Charts*, through which the Mysterious Sages manifest transformations, revealing numinous metamorphoses and depicting forms to expound principles, thereby rendering things easily comprehended.

The *Jade Emperor’s Registers of Lineage* record the names and clans of the sagely lords, tracing the ancestral origins, hereditary succession, and the ranks of divine officials.

The *Canons of Sincerity and Discipline* were established by the Mysterious Sages to measure the gravity of transgressions and blessings, setting forth statutes and ordinances to prevent and examine faults.

The *Scripture of Natural Dignity and Propriety* fully demonstrates the observances of purification and abstinence, the postures of reverence in ritual, the forms of advancement and withdrawal, and the norms and measures of conduct.

The *Methods* comprise the esoteric essentials of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and numinous fungi, malleable gold, flowing water, and jade—all pertaining to the Dao of self-cultivation.

The *Arts and Numerologies* clarify the discernment of spirit through contemplation, the preservation of truth through mindfulness of the Dao, the purification of the heart and emptying of intent, wandering through emptiness and flying steps, ingesting and absorbing primordial harmony, guiding and conducting the Three Luminaries—these are the methods of immortal transcendence.

The *Records and Biographies* document the studies, attainments, and realizations of the Perfected, as well as the traces of those who have verified their fruits.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The *Inner Teachings of the Numinous Treasure* may be transmitted only to those who universally inspire faith among the people. One must uphold the precepts completely, harbor no inner defilements, relieve the orphaned and weak, shun evil and cultivate goodness, seek neither fame nor reputation, and regard praise and blame as equal. In secluded and remote places, one must diligently practice the Dao so that others may trust it. Like the four seasons, one must be unwavering; when discussing with the worthy, one must not cling obstinately to one’s own views—only then may the teachings be transmitted. Furthermore, one who ardently seeks superior methods, follows goodness as water flows downward, delights in drawing near to the wise and sagacious, and acts without suspicion or doubt; who is discerning and able to distinguish truth from falsehood, cautious in speech and measured in conduct; who is gentle and without transgression, able to honor teachers superior to oneself without arrogance or disrespect, and values their teachings as a pauper values treasure; who reveres and serves their masters without shirking toil, and whose desire for instruction remains unwavering day and night—only such a one may be entrusted with the scriptures.

The text further states: Those who obtain the *Arrayed Chronicles of Supreme Purity* may become Perfected of the Great Ultimate. If one can recite them, one may ascend to become a Lord of Supreme Purity. Those who possess the *Hidden Writings of Jade Purity* shall attain true immortality in a single day and night, discoursing on the Dao and expounding its wonders. Those who hold the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* shall have the Jade Emperor dispatch the divine soldiers of the Five Directions, with the Three Officials of Left and Right supervising and regulating the numinous texts.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Five Chapters of True Writ in Vermilion Script of the Primordial Commencement’s Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure* existed prior to the Primordial Commencement, within the emptiness of the Cavernous Void, before heaven and earth took root, before the sun and moon shone, in the profound obscurity where there was neither ancestor nor clan. The numinous writ flickered in and out of existence, ethereal and elusive. The Two Modes awaited it to divide the Great Yang; they awaited it to bring forth illumination. The numinous charts evolved with the turning of the cosmos, the celestial images shifted with the reckoning of time, and in response to the moment and in accord with destiny, it came into being. Heaven and earth, receiving it, became distinct; the Three Luminaries, receiving it, radiated light. The numinous writ flourished in splendor, illuminating the Supreme Purity with its resplendence. It emerged from the Celestial Realm of Primordial Azure, its hues unbounded by fixed directions, its branches and configurations intricate beyond all tracing or inquiry. First refined in the Hall of Cavernous Yang, tempered in the Court of Flying Fire, its true writ was clarified, its radiance gleaming brilliantly. As the qi of Cavernous Yang is vermilion, it is called the Vermilion Script. Heaven treasures it to bring about ascent; earth conceals it to ensure stability. The Five Thearchs reward it, thereby securing the governance of the Three Luminaries and ascending to lofty brilliance. The Supreme Sages uphold it to attain truth; the Five Marchmounts follow it to gain numinosity. The Son of Heaven obtains it to achieve good governance; the state enjoys it to attain great peace. The wondrous power of the imperial numinous writ marks the mysterious root of heaven and earth. Its majestic numinosity expands boundlessly, universally bestowing infinite blessings. Vast and transformative, it is the ancestor of divine luminosity. Its measure is unfathomable, towering as the great void. It gives birth to heaven and establishes earth, inaugurating the transformations of divine luminosity. Above, it is called the *Numinous Bestowal that Pacifies the Five Marchmounts and Preserves the State for Eternity*; below, it is called the *Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Wonder, the Most Exalted of All Things*.

It further states: The *Eightfold Might of the Supreme* now follows the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure*. There is a talisman named the *Supreme’s Eightfold Might* for subduing tigers, leopards, and mountain spirits. The *Scripture of the Golden Truth and Jade Radiance of the Supreme’s Hidden Writ* is the transmission of the Jade Dawn of the Supreme. The *Mysterious and Profound Scripture of the Great Existence* is the transmission of the Queen Mother of the West. The *Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings of the Golden Writ of the Great Ultimate* is the transmission of the Great Lord Emperor of Fusang. The *Scripture of Feathered Flight* is the transmission of the Yellow Venerable Lord of the Center. The *Hidden Writ of the Great Night’s Jade Chapters* is the transmission of the Supreme Thearch. All these transmissions possess true scriptures, though some may hold high rank yet practice inferior methods, or bear heavy responsibilities yet occupy humble positions. These transmissions, though containing new methods, take the *Inner Scripture of the Yellow Court* as their foundation, which is the *Scripture of the Great Ultimate*. The *Scripture of Vermilion Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother* resembles the *Purple Writ Method of Ingesting Solar Essence*, the *Celestial August Symbol Talismans* for harmonizing primordial qi, and the *Yellow Writ and Vermilion Realm*—the essentials of longevity.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery of the Perfected* states: The *Golden Pavilion of the Great One*, the *Hidden Registers of the Five Stars*, the *Seven Talismans of Later Sages*, the *Stone Casket of Hollow Mountain*, the *Vermilion Terrace’s Mysterious Yellow Chapters*, and the *Embracing Chart of the Heavenly Mother of the Five Phases*—none may hear or behold the supreme Dao.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Perfection* states: The *Jade Chamber* contains the *Thirty-Nine Plain Words*, the *Supreme Transformation of the Mysterious Elixir*, and the *Dao of the Three Perfected and Cavernous Primordial*—all concealed within. It further states: The *Supreme Conceals the Three Primordials’ Jade Regulations*, and within its secluded chamber, the *Three Primordials’ Scripture* is arrayed. This is the secret repository of the *Nine Elixirs’ Writ of the Supreme Immortals*, guarded by the Lord Emperor of the Celestial Microcosm. The Five Elders of the Primordial Commencement further conceal the *Five Chapters of True Writ* within.

It further states: Within the Jade Leather Green Palace of the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea’s Lesser Florescence, in the eastern hall’s shelves, there are three hundred volumes of precious scriptures and nine thousand chapters of jade instructions. These govern the registers of those who study immortality and are bestowed upon those destined to become Perfected. They are overseen by the Jade Dawn’s Supervisor of Immortal Attendants.

As for the *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*, there are inner and outer teachings. The outer teachings include miscellaneous doctrines, expounded according to each person’s understanding, not necessarily exhaustively, but to guide the learner toward enlightenment.

To her left hung a jade pendant, resembling the pendants of the mortal world but slightly smaller. Her robes shimmered with sudden light, casting a radiance within the chamber like sunlight through mica.

The hair and temples were arranged with unparalleled refinement. A topknot sat at the crown, while the remaining tresses cascaded to the waist. Gold rings adorned the fingers, and white pearls encircled the arms, making her appear no older than thirteen or fourteen. Flanking her were two attendant maidens: one wore crimson robes and bore a green talismanic pouch, her hands also holding a brocade satchel over a foot in length, containing more than ten scrolls. The white jade clasp atop the satchel bore the inscription *Jade Clarity Divine Tiger, Inner Perfected Purple Prime Cinnabar Script*.

All attendants wore crimson robes. The Eastern Minister appeared far younger than his two brothers, who were dressed in azure brocade skirts, purple-furred kerchiefs, and *lotus-petal crowns*. The two brothers stood side by side until the Eastern Minister bade them sit, and they conversed at length.

This occurred in the *yichou* year, the third year of the Xingning reign of the Jin dynasty, on the fourth day of the seventh month, descending at the home of Master Yang.

The First Emperor of Qin summoned him and spoke with him for three days. That evening, he was gifted gold and jade worth thousands of millions, left at the Pavilion of Restful Village. There, he placed a letter of departure and left behind a pair of crimson jade shoes, one of which he used to measure the other, saying: 'Seek me beneath Mount Penglai a thousand years hence.' The First Emperor dispatched envoys into the sea, but before they reached Penglai, winds and waves drove them back."

The *Scripture of Luminous Regulations* says: "If one possesses the Purple Tablets of the Emperor’s Chart with green characters, it may be transmitted after a thousand years." It also states: "The Five Elders’ Treasured Scripture is written in azure and green characters to compose its sections." And: "The *Eight Simplicities Perfected Scripture* is the hidden writ of the Supreme. The Lord Emperor of the Golden Watchtower inscribed it with eight-hued brushes as the method of attaining perfection, bestowing it upon the Perfected of Great Emptiness. The Red Pine Master of the Southern Marchmount was sent to transmit it below to those studying the Dao. Those with prior destiny bear golden and jade characters carved in the Golden Pavilion. Those who are to become Perfected must not transmit it beyond Earthbound Immortals." It further records: "The *Five Talismans Scripture*—a single passage of unobstructed writ—is sealed in a cinnabar-silk pouch with a case of golden blossoms, stamped with the seal of the Dark Capital, and entrusted to the Lord of the Shocking Waters Grotto-Chamber." And: "The *Scripture of the Perfected and Spontaneously Real*—when the host of Perfected wear this scripture, it is inscribed in cinnabar upon yellow brocade, and the Dao’s true essence is eternally enjoyed without end."

The words spoken by the Primordial Beginning in the midst of expounding the scriptures are all the hidden sounds of the inner names of the Heavenly Thearchs, not the common speech of the world. It further states: "The *Five Treasures Scripture of the Feminine One* is secretly kept above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Great Existence Palace and the Terrace of the Great Mystery Numinous Treasure.

And: "There is a wondrous scripture carved on jade slips, transmitted to the Heavenly Emperor Lord."

The *Jade Emperor’s Genealogical Register* states: The *Venerable of the Primordial Beginning* ascended the *Jade Void Altar* to receive the *Upper August Treasure Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Genealogical Register*, the *Jade Talismans*, and the *Secret Chapters*.

**Palaces**

The *Primary Record of Mount Gui* states: The *Venerable of the Primordial Beginning* resides in the *Upper Clarity Jade Heaven Palace*, the *Great Clarity Palace*, the *Opening Clarity Palace*, the *Jade Treasure Grotto Origin Palace*, the *Golden Fusion Palace*, the *Cinnabar Radiance Palace*, the *Double Darkness Palace*, and the *Phoenix Birth Palace*.

**Transmission and Reception (Part One)**

The *Scripture of the True Forms of the Five Peaks* states: If a Daoist obtains a scripture of secret sagely teachings, they must not conceal it within the mouth of a single person. Should the texts of true numina be allowed to perish through solitary witness, by what means could they endure for eternal generations? Transmission must be entrusted only to the worthy. How could one hoard and withhold them, thus forever obscuring these writings?

The *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate* states: The *Jade Scripture of the Supreme* contains hidden annotations and precious oral instructions—it is the progenitor of all scriptures. The Supreme commanded that it be transmitted to the lords, dukes, ministers, and counts of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who have not attained such rank may not receive it. If a Daoist encounters this book, they are destined to become a *Celestial Duke*. Their name is predestined in the *Mysterious Register*.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure and True Unity* states: The *Grand Numinous Perfected* addressed the *Celestial Duke of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate*, saying: "Long ago, I transmitted the *Upper Treasure Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Grotto Mystery and Natural Perfection* to the *Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate*, who, in accordance with the Supreme’s method, passed it on to others."

The *Scripture of Resolute Will* states: The *Primordial Beginning* instructed the *Perfected of the Right Mysterious Unity*, saying: "You may transmit this scripture only after selecting the worthy. Disseminate it boundlessly without exclusion."

The *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* states: Among a million people, perhaps one is fated to receive this text—all such recipients have predestined records of immortality. When seeking someone to transmit it to, one must choose carefully, entering the famous mountains and traversing the eight directions. Then, no ghost or spirit in the world will dare to violate them.

The *Queen Mother of the Primordial Beginning in the Heavenly Center of Great Clarity* is the first teacher of those who study the Dao.

It further states: The *August Person* is the emissary of the *Supreme Thearch*, dwelling on Mount Emei. The *Yellow Thearch* went there to receive the *True Unity and Five Molar Methods*.

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* states: The *Yellow Thearch* traveled east to *Green Hill*, passing *Wind Mountain*, where he met the *Master of the Purple Palace* and received the *Inner Text of the Three Sovereigns*, by which he summoned the myriad spirits. He journeyed south to *Round Canopy*, where he observed the *Hundred Numinous Ones* at the *Tree of Construction*. He went west to *Middle Yellow Master* and received the *Ninefold Augmentation Method*. Passing *Kongtong*, he studied the *Scripture of the Natural* under *Master Broad Accomplishment*. He traveled north to *Hongti* and *Juci*, where he met *Great Lord Jun* and the *Yellow Canopy Youth*, receiving the *Divine Mushroom Chart*. Returning, he reached *Wangwu Mountain* and obtained the *Divine Elixir Annotations*. At *Mount Emei*, he encountered the *Yellow Person* in the *Jade Hall* and inquired about the *Way of True Unity*, saying: "The methods for long life and immortality rely solely on *golden liquid*, while preserving form and repelling evil depends only on *True Unity*. The ancients prized this Way above all."

The *Yellow Thearch* was one who naturally embodied the Dao, yet he still journeyed to *Wangwu* to receive the *Elixir Scripture*, ascended *Kongtong* to consult *Broad Accomplishment*, went to *Juci* to serve *Great Hidden*, traveled to *Eastern Peak* to honor *Middle Yellow*, entered *Golden Valley* to seek *Master Xin*, discussed the cultivation of the Way with *Xuan Su*, refined his calculations with *Lei Qi*, exhausted the records of spirits and demons with *White Marsh*, surveyed geography with *Green Crow*, and mended wounds with *Golden Cold*. Thus, he mastered all essential secrets and fully penetrated the truth of the Dao.

According to the *Scripture of Divine Immortals*: Long ago, the *Yellow Thearch* and *Laozi* served *Original Lord*, who imparted to them essential instructions. Without the guidance of these two lords, how could they have attained transcendence and delivered the world?

The *Scripture of Mount Ke* and the *Record of the Dragon’s Head* both state that the *Yellow Thearch* ingested divine elixirs. It further says: *Peng Zu* lived eight hundred years, and *Anqi* a thousand—such longevity far surpasses ordinary people. If there truly exists a Way of undying, why did they not ascend as immortals? Is it not simply that their allotted lifespan and received qi happened to be abundant?

The *Scripture of Peng Zu* states: He assisted *Yao*, served through the *Xia* dynasty, and became a minister under the *Shang*. The *Shang* king sought his method for extending years, and when it proved effective, desired to kill *Peng Zu* to eradicate the technique. Sensing this, *Peng Zu* fled. At the time of his departure, he was eight hundred years old.

Moreover, it is said: The *Jade Flying Heavenly Writ of the Purple Tenuity Mysterious Palace* was bestowed by the Grand Primordial upon the Queen Mother of the West, who wore it at her waist and ascended to the rank of Immortal Ancestor, attended by perfected beings.

It further says: The *Myriad Immortals’ Writ of the Mysterious Continent’s Immortal Lord* was conferred by the Youth of the Eastern Sea upon those who attain the Dao, to be worn at the waist. It is also called the *Register of the Immortal’s Way* or the *Phoenix Perfected’s Thread of the Grand Mystery’s Ascension Covenant*.

Moreover, the *Numinous Flying Perfected Writ of the Kunlun Pond Terrace* was transmitted by the Grand Supreme Elder to those who attain the Dao, to be worn at the waist. They traverse the Five Marchmounts, where the mountain spirits confer office upon them. It is also called the *Five Marchmounts’ Military Tallies*—when worn, metal and stone open before them.

It further says: When the *Supreme Perfected Writ of Penglai* was completed, the August Emperor of the Azure Heavens transmitted it to Ning Feng. Those who wear this true tally traverse rivers and seas without hindrance. It is also called the *Penglai Grand Mystery Jade Tablet* or the *Nine Streams’ Perfected Writ*, which the Literary Master of Beiling transmitted to Ma Shihuang to summon dragons.

Moreover, the *Yellow Supreme Perfected Writ of the Celestial Thearch’s Literary Master*, when worn at the waist, reveals omens of fortune and misfortune before they manifest.

The *Scripture of Supreme Purity* states: The Perfected of Supreme Purity ascended Mount Canglang of the Great Thearch, where the Perfected of the Grand Ultimate bestowed upon them the *Cinnabar and Azure Jade Crucible* and the *Scripture of Refining Cloud Root*.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Array* says: Formerly, Ning Xuanshu received this scripture from the August Supreme Perfected and concealed it for nine years in White Void Mountain. After a hundred days of purification, he suddenly saw upon the cliff a silver tablet inscribed with the Kingly Script. One copy remains sealed in White Void Mountain.

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: The Cinnabar Numinous Perfected encountered Master Xuanhe and received the *Vermilion Writ of the Numinous Treasure*, the *Mysterious Writ of the Five Qi*, and one chapter of the *Perfected Writ of the Black Thearch*.

The *Scripture of the Lofty Mystery* says: Formerly, the Supreme Prime transmitted the *Hidden Writ* to the Jade Maiden of Grand Harmony, who in turn bestowed it upon the Lord of Young Yang. The text was sealed in the grotto-chamber of Mount Jiuyi.

The *Concealed Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: The *Precious Chapters of the Grand Ultimate Thearch* were conferred by the Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea upon Juanzi, who sealed them in the palm of a famous mountain. Juanzi obtained them by splitting open a carp—these are the *Three Ones Guarding the Form*, commanded by the Most High. Written in cinnabar upon white silk and worn at the left elbow, they must not be exposed to defilement. After eight years of wearing them, the Three Ones will all manifest. The Three Ones are the Three Prime Perfected Lords of Unity. They transmit the teaching of sealing within the palm.

It further says: Li Yi, styled Zhongfu, transmitted the *Seven Transformations Method* to Zuo Ci. Ci cultivated it and achieved myriad transformations. This scripture appears in the *Biography of Perfected Lord Mao*, but later Daoists, regarding the *Returning Cinnabar Method* as exceedingly secret, extracted it and made it a separate scroll.

The *Biography of Lord Mao* states: The Primordial Perfected of the Grand Supreme, the Queen Mother of the West, bestowed and expounded the *Scripture of the Mysterious Perfected of the Luminous Hall*, saying: *The Most High established the Dual Mystery and the Fourfold Radiance. The Mysterious Perfected shines within, the Luminous Hall is pure without. Inhaling the twin luminances, one’s spirit attains long life. Above, one assists the Controller of Destinies, overseeing the numinous powers of the directions. The Sixfold Effulgences overflow, scattering the gaze of the Yellow and Tranquil.* These forty characters are the fundamental scripture of the Mysterious Perfected. Later, the Queen Mother of the West, the Perfected of Totality, further elaborated the methods of practice, just as the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* takes the Dragon Script as its essence. The Most High inscribed it upon the southern pavilion of Phoenix Terrace. It is not taught to those who are not disciples of the Perfected of Totality, nor transmitted to those who are not the select of the Controller of Destinies.

It further says: The Queen Mother of the West brought Lord Mao Ying to the Palace of Solid Integrity. Solid Integrity was the second younger brother of Ying. The Queen Mother patted his back and said: *Though your Dao is accomplished, what you have heard is not yet sufficient. I have something to bestow upon you.* She then dispatched her attendant, Guo Mixiang, to convey a message to the Lady of the Supreme Prime, saying: *Though we have not met for over four thousand years, the affairs of heaven have wearied me, leaving little time for visitation. Might you come briefly? I shall await you here.*

The Lady of the Supreme Prime sent an attendant to reply: *Ahuan bows and inquires after your well-being. Separated by the Crimson River and burdened by official duties, I have not seen your face for nearly five thousand years. Yearning for your radiance, my heart remains ever bound to you.* When Mixiang arrived and delivered the message, the Lady of the Supreme Prime prepared her carriage. First, she was received by the Lord of Grand Constancy, who sent her to the Grove of Aspiration to collate the registers of the Three Primes and verify them. She would depart only briefly, then return. Upon returning, she would proceed eastward, hoping to tarry a while.

Mao Gu thereupon asked the Queen Mother: *May I inquire who the Lady of the Supreme Prime is?* The Queen Mother replied: *She is the Mother of the Perfected August Ones of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Perfected of the Supreme Prime, who governs the rosters of jade maidens throughout the ten directions.*

When the Lady of the Supreme Prime arrived, the sound of pipes and drums was heard in the clouds, and the neighing of dragon-horses. Upon her descent, her retinue was vast, all women, uniformly sixteen or seventeen years old, their countenances luminous and transcendent. Many wore garments of azure damask, their brilliance dazzling. The Lady of the Supreme Prime was not yet thirty, her celestial beauty unmatched. She wore a robe of crimson frost and a cloak of azure brocade. Her hair was arranged in a triple chignon, the rest cascading to her waist. She wore a crown of the Nine Dawns and the Moon at Night, and pendants of the Six Mountains’ Fiery Algae. She trailed a grand sash of phoenix-patterned jade brilliance and wielded the *Flowing Yellow Waving Essence Sword*. Entering the chamber, she bowed to the Queen Mother, who sat and bade her rise, sharing a seat facing north.

The Lady of the Supreme Prime prepared a feast, and the Lord of the Kings urged Mao Ying’s two younger brothers to partake. Guzhong rose to bow, prostrating himself and standing. She commanded him to sit and resume his place. The Lady of the Supreme Prime then ordered her attendant to bring forth a purple brocade pouch and open a casket of green gold, from which she transmitted to Guzhong the *Scripture of the Flowing Pearls of the Three Primes*, the *Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance and Dao Essence*, the *Scripture of the Eight Arts of Concealing the Earth*, and the *Scripture of the Green Radiance of the Grand Ultimate*—four scriptures in all.

The Queen Mother of the West commanded her attendant, Li Fangming, to bring forth a case of cinnabar jade and open a casket of cloud pearls, from which she transmitted to the Controller of Destinies, Lord Mao, the *Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean* and the *Inner True Tallies of the Two Luminances of Cavernous Flight*.

The Lady of the Supreme Prime said: *Mother’s hidden writings are wondrous—cherished by the Heavenly Immortals of the Supreme Perfected as inner scriptures. Sealed in golden terraces, they are worn when entering the Grand Tenuity. In motion, one rides the jade chariot of the Eight Radiant Sceneries; at rest, one reposes in the golden hall.*

This text is wondrous indeed. The *Grand Ultimate Scripture of Green Radiance* and its counterparts can summon the Bright Moon and Yellow Blossoms, attaining the Crimson Essence of the White Sun.

When the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Supreme Prime both departed, only Lord Wang remained for a full day. Thereupon, Mao Ying bid farewell to his two younger brothers and left with Lord Wang, arriving at the Jade Cavern Prefecture of Red City. He addressed his brothers, saying: "I now depart to assume my duties and shall not be able to visit you frequently. Mount Juqu is your administrative seat."

In the seventh year of *Jianwu* during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han (31 CE), on the *dingsi* day of the third month, an emissary named Wu Lun was dispatched bearing fifty *jin* of yellow gold, which was placed beneath the shrine of the Three Lords Mao. Sacrifices of the grandest offering were made there in all four seasons. By the second year of *Yongping* during the reign of Emperor Ming (59 CE), the shrine of the Perfected Mao of Juqu in Danyang’s Jurong was ordered to be maintained and guarded. At that time, the locals commonly referred to this shrine as the White Crane Temple.

The Cavern Palace of Mount Juqu has five gates: the winding stone steps of the mountain are shaped by water, and these gates permit passage for ascent and descent. The grotto-heaven of Mount Juqu connects eastward to the Forest Chamber, northward to Mount Tai, westward to Mount Emei, and southward to Mount Luofu—all great Daoist thoroughfares. Among them, lesser paths, new trails, and winding sandbars are too numerous to count.

At the end of the *Jian’an* era (220 CE), Zuo Ci heard of this mountain in the region east of the Yangzi and thus sought it out. After three months of purification and fasting, he ascended the mountain, found its gate, and entered the Cavern’s Void to reach the Yin Palace. The Two Lords Mao bestowed upon him three kinds of divine mushrooms. Zuo Ci wandered the cavern chambers for a year, where the regulations were most solemn. He sighed, saying: "I never imagined the world could hold such marvels!"

Among the grotto-heavens beneath the earth, there are thirty-six in all, including Wangwu, Weiyu, Xicheng, Xixuan, Qingcheng, Chicheng, Luofu, Juqu, Linwu, Kuocang, Kunlun, Penglai, Yingzhou, Fangzhang, Canglang, Baishan, and the Eight Stops—all such places. The Five Marchmounts and other renowned mountains each possess cavern chambers, some thirty *li*, twenty *li*, or ten *li* in extent, while the cavern of a marchmount spans a hundred *li*.

Mount Juqu was known in Qin times as Mount Ju Jintan, for within its grotto-heaven stood a hundred-*zhang* golden altar, whence its name derived. During the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the prefectures and counties were ordered to mine the gold of Mount Juqu to fill the imperial armories. In the time of Sun Quan, guardsmen were again dispatched to mine gold, which was regularly delivered to the court.

On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month each year, the Eastern Minister of Destinies, Lord Mao, convenes on Mount Juqu with the Jade Lord of the Assembly of Perfected Ones, the Great Void Perfected, and the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea. Those who seek the Way of immortality should first purify themselves through fasting and await these days to ascend the mountain and present their entreaties. Lord Mao will then transmit the essential Dao, allowing them to enter the cavern gate.

It is further said: The Purple Tenuity, Primordial Numinous, White Jade, Tortoise Terrace, Nine Numinous, Supreme Perfected, and Primordial Lady—these are the Queen Mother of the West. The Supreme Minister of the Assembly of Perfected Ones, Lord Wang, is the teacher of the Eastern Minister of Destinies, Lord Mao, and the mother of the Right Canopy, the Lady of Purple Tenuity. She dwells in the Pond Terrace of Kunlun, governing separately from the Azure Forest Palace of White Jade Tortoise Mountain. Her chambers are crimson and purple; she wears a flowered coronet and a tiger-patterned sash. Her canopy is adorned with layered feathers, and her banners bear the *yin* and *ting* emblems. During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, she descended to the Floriate Yang Palace of Mount Juqu and bestowed upon the Minister of Destinies, Lord Mao, the jade pendants, golden earrings, and scriptures. She also instructed the two younger Lords Mao.

By the time of Emperor Cheng of Jin, she descended together with the Golden Watchtower Sage Lord to the Hidden Primordial Terrace of Yangluo, where she transmitted to Lady Wei the four scrolls of the *Jade Purity Hidden Writings*. The accounts in the *Biography of King Mu* of his visit to the Queen Mother of the West and her descent to Emperor Wu of Han all refer to her. There is a separate transmission titled the *Numinous Mirror Cavern Mystery Supreme Scripture*, also called the *Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*—the very text now held by the Assistant Minister of the Middle Prime. It has not yet been revealed to the world and serves to instruct all those who study the true Way.

It is further said: The Supreme Perfected Lord of the Western Ultimate is the teacher of the Minister of Destinies, Lord Mao. Born at the end of the Shang dynasty, he consumed the Azure Essence *qi*-infused grain and the nine-times-cycled elixir, employing the Way of the Dawn Sword and Liberation to govern the Western City Mountain Palace. At the age of thirty, he donned embroidered robes, a hibiscus coronet, and carried a bell and a single sword. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he descended to Mount Yangluo and transmitted the thirty-one scrolls of the *Jade Purity Void Supreme Scripture*. In the Jin dynasty, he again descended to the Yangluo Terrace to instruct Lady Wei. Every third and twelfth month, he likewise comes to Mount Juqu to review and examine the studies of transcendents. There is a separate transmission concerning him, though it has not yet been revealed to the world. The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* recounts his descent to the household of Cai Jing—this refers to this very lord.

It is further said: The Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, a disciple of the Supreme Perfected Lord Wang, was the teacher of Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he left his family and entered Mount Huayin. After nine years, the Perfected Lord of the Grand Ultimate descended to transmit two methods. Later, he entered Mount Difei (also called Mount Zhongnan) and ascended Mount Yangluo. During the reign of Emperor Ping, the Southern Ultimate Lady and the Western City Lord Wang descended together to transmit thirty-one scrolls of the supreme scriptures. Lord Wang then journeyed with him to the Dark Continent to request his true name. Returning to the Western City, he cultivated the Way to completion. Thereupon, he rode a flying maple chariot to travel throughout the world. Later, he ascended White Void Mountain and visited the Three Primordial Lords of Purple Purity and Grand Simplicity, receiving the *Flowing Gold*, *Fire Bell*, *Expansive*, *Seven Primes*, *Eight Sceneries*, *Flying Dawn*, *Divine Strategem*, and *Jade Seal* scriptures in full. He then returned to the Western City.

The Supreme Lord sent gifts: a feathered dawn canopy, a pair of luminous moon pearls, a jade-staffed white feather banner, and a cinnabar-embroidered brocade standard. The Grand Simplicity further dispatched a decree bearing the completed mandate, appointing him the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness of Grand Simplicity, to govern Mount Jade House and oversee the treasury of sacred scriptures. He rides a tiger-drawn chariot with a golden canopy and jade wheels, an Eight Scenery flying carriage, and bears a nine-colored staff. He enters and exits the Supreme Purity, serves the Grand Simplicity, and reposes in the Grand Ultimate. Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount was his disciple, and his transmission has been made manifest in the world.

*The Inner Transmission of Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount* states:

Lady Wei bore the surname Wei, her personal name was Huacun, her courtesy name Xian’an. She was a native of Rencheng and the daughter of Wei Shu, the Duke Wenkang and Minister of Education of the Jin. From youth, she studied the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, the *Three Commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals*, the *Five Classics*, and the writings of the Hundred Masters. She often resided alone in a separate garden, dwelling in quietude, and consumed sesame seeds. Her parents compelled her to marry Liu Youyan, the clerk of the Grand Protector of Nanyan. Yet her long-held aspirations remained steadfast and unbroken.

Later, when Youyan became magistrate of Xiuwu, she followed him to the county residence. There, she secluded herself in a separate chamber for a hundred days, awaiting the advent of the immortals. On a midwinter night at midnight, four perfected beings descended into her chamber: the Perfected Lord of the Grand Ultimate, An Duming; the Lord of Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad; the Perfected of Azure Sea and Scenic Forest; and the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness, Wang Zideng.

Thereupon, Lady Wei bowed and entreated them for the Way of long life and deliverance from the world. The Azure Lad said, “This Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness shall be your master; you must receive his teachings.” The Perfected of Scenic Forest declared, “You are destined to become the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, a Perfected Controller of Destiny and Lady of the Southern Marchmount.” Lady Wei replied, “This humble servant is most fortunate to receive such a mandate of life.”

When she had finished speaking, the Lad of Eastern Florescence pointed and laughed, saying, “How bitterly earnest is your cinnabar heart!” Then the Perfected Lord Wang commanded his attendants, Hua Santiao and Li Mingci, to part the cloud-woven curtains, open the jade caskets, and bring forth the *Precious Writings of the Supreme Lord*, the *Eight Hidden Scriptures*, the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*, the *Eight Daoist Writings of the Numinous Book*, the *Purple Radiance of Scorching Flame*, the *Stone Essence and Jade Steed*, the *Tiger Script of the Divine Perfected*, and the *Thirty-One Scrolls of the Lofty Immortal and Feathered Mystery*—all of which he personally bestowed upon Lady Wei.

Lord Wang had once studied the Dao on Mount Yangluo, where he encountered the Lady of the Southern Culmen and Lord Wang of the Western City, who transmitted to him these thirty-one scrolls. Through their practice, he attained perfection. What he now transmitted was the original scripture of the Southern Culmen and Western City. On Mount Yangluo stands the Terrace of Repose, a secondary palace of the Perfected of Pure Emptiness.

As Lord Wang bestowed the scriptures upon Lady Wei, he rose, faced north, and swore an oath: “By the Supreme Three Mysteries, the Nine August High Perfected, and the Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Emperor commands that I, Wang, instruct Wei Huacun herein.”

The Perfected of Scenic Forest further transmitted to Lady Wei the *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court*, also called *The Supreme Lord’s Zither Heart*, *The Golden Book of the Great Emperor*, and *The Jade Chapters of Eastern Florescence*, instructing her to recite it day and night. Lord Wang admonished her, saying, “If you do not conceal yourself in the mountains, fast, and maintain purity, you must not recklessly recite the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*. As for the *Tiger Script*, the *Dragon Writings*, the *Eight Hidden Writings of the Primordial Simplicity*, and other arcane and profound mysteries—without fasting and severing worldly ties, they cannot be practiced. For now, you may recite the *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court*, tread the steps of the Seven Primes, and visualize the spirits of the Five Stars. If others practice these, it will suffice to evoke transformations and resonances. When the time comes for your ascension, I shall come to receive you.”

The Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron remained joyfully, briefly tarrying to chant with the Four Perfected. Then he commanded Song Lianjuan, the Jade Maiden of the Northern Frigid Realm, to pluck the *Hymn of the Nine Qi*; Yan Jingzhu, the Jade Maiden of Eastern Florescence, to strike the bell of the Western Fullness; Jia Quting, the Jade Maiden of Cloudy Groves, to blow the phoenix-repelling flute; and Xianyu Lingjin, the Jade Maiden of Soaring Mystery, to tap the jade baton of the Nine Harmonies.

Lord Wang then said to Lady Wei, “The essential instructions are now complete.” With that, he took his leave.

Lady Wei cultivated stillness and advanced daily. She lived in the world for eighty-three years. In the ninth year of Xianhe under Emperor Cheng of Jin, when Lord Wang and the Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence descended, the year was jiawu. The two Perfected Ones gave Lady Wei elixirs: the *Divine Powder of Hidden Transcendence from White Medicine River*, and the *Spirit Pill of Stone Essence and Golden Radiance for Transforming Form*. They instructed her to feign illness and withdraw, setting a fixed date to meet at the Yangluo Palace.

After speaking, the two Perfected Ones departed. Lady Wei immediately ingested the elixirs, then claimed a foot ailment, closed her eyes, and rested, drinking but not eating. On the seventh day, after midnight, the Supreme Unity Transcendent Immortal dispatched a cloud chariot to receive her, driving through the qi and entering her bedchamber. At that time, her disciples attended her illness, and her kin filled the room, yet none perceived it. Lady Wei then employed the method of *Concealing Radiance*, entrusting her form to sword transformation. She slowly ascended the cloud carriage and proceeded directly to Yangluo.

Dwelling in the Hidden Origin Terrace, her will governed the Upper Prime. Her sincerity moved the Nine Heavens; her cinnabar heart truly aligned. Clarifying her spirit, the Lady of Supreme Simplicity then journeyed north to the Palace of Supreme Purity. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity dispatched Li Mingqi, the Jade Prime Attendant of the Nine Palaces, to confer upon her the *Divine Phoenix Writs* and command her to seal the mountains. The Yellow Venerable Lord of the Central Clouds sent Hou Gongyangzi, the Feathered Dawn Attendant of the Orthodox Unity, to bestow upon her the *Dragon Robe and Tiger Belt*, the *Cinnabar and Azure Flying Skirt*, and the *Ten Absolute Floral Banners*, enabling her to ascend to the Supreme Purity and assume the true destiny of transcendence.

The Lofty Lady of the Three Simplicities sent Fan Dingying, the Lady of the Ninefold Left Florescence, to present her with the *Flowing Gold Fire Bell* and the *Nine-Canopied Cloud Chariot*, empowering her to subdue the demons of all directions. The Great Dao Lord of the Jade Dawn of the Supreme Void and Grand Mystery dispatched Meng Liuqi, the Embroidered Robe Messenger, to grant her the *Nine-Colored Baton*, the *Twin Pearl Moonlight*, the *Divine Tiger Talisman*, and the *Broidered Tiger Banner*, appointing her to command the host of spirits and overawe the Six Heavens.

The Lady of the Three Primes of Supreme Simplicity sent Zhong Wenjian, the Guardian of the Divine Capital, and Zhao Yueluo, the Right Consort Yuanji, to confer upon her the *Three Hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence*, the *Eight Radiant Flying Chariots*, and the *Nine Dark Dragons of Mystic Radiance*, ordering them to attend and hold her towels as she ascended to the Three Clarities.

The Grand Thearch of Fusang dispatched Ke Yanshou, the Eight Mystery Immortal Earl, and the Celestial Thearchs of the Five Directions, led by Jian Suzhi, to bestow upon her the *Jade Tablet and Golden Script*, appointing her as the Purple Void Primordial Lady, overseer of the life registers of all who cultivate the Dao, and mistress of the offices that govern fate, examine sins, and inspect the Golden Pass.

Later, the Sage Lord commanded the Immortal Earl Ya Shuping to present her with the *Azure Jade Tablet* inscribed in cinnabar and green, appointing her as the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, equal in rank to the Transcendent Dukes. She was granted a *Curved Dawn Flying Canopy* to traverse the Nine Palaces and charged with governing the Great Mount Tiantai within the Terrace of Huo, instructing those below who uphold the Dao and teaching those destined to become true transcendents. She was ordered to ascend the Jade Purity twice monthly, the Supreme Simplicity thrice, and the Jade Dawn Palace and Fusang’s Lofty Terrace four times.

Thereupon, Lady Wei received the Queen Mother’s mandate and returned to the midst of Mount Wangwu’s Lesser Existence. She further purified herself for three months. The Primordial Lady of the Nine Subtleties, the Queen Mother of Tortoise Mountain, the Perfected Wang Fangping of the Western City, the Grand Void Perfected Red Pine, and the Perfected Wang Ziqiao of Paulownia and Cypress all descended to the Crimson Chamber of the Pure Void Upper Palace in Lesser Existence. Each commanded their attendant maidens to strike gold and stone instruments.

Then the Queen Mother of the West rose and paced, bowing as she chanted:
*“Alas, this parting and meeting,
When kalpas end and heaven and earth collapse.
Within the Crimson Mound’s embrace,
Together we rejoice without end.”*

As the song concluded, the registrar of destinies, the host of transcendents, and the welcoming officials of the Southern Marchmount arrived. The Queen Mother and the others departed with Lady Wei for the Terrace of Mount Tiantai and Huo.

The *Esoteric Instructions on Ascending Perfection* states: *The Golden Tiger Talisman of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity*. The Supreme Jade Perfected Lord of Imperial Dao bestowed it upon the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It also states: *The Jade Seal and Golden True Tiger Talisman of the Supreme Unity*. Lady Li of the Illustrious Terrace governed the Terrace of Fangzhang, dwelling in the thirteenth vermilion pavilion, and descended during the Xingning era of Jin. Lord Yang dragged a purple brocade robe, bearing the *Divine Tiger Talisman* and *Flowing Gold Bell*, with a green jade-colored sash. He had two attendant maidens, each about twenty years old, clad in green damask. One attendant, named Yinhui, held two vermilion jade boxes bound with green cords and jade seals. The inscriptions read: *Supreme Writs* and *Supreme Scripts*. Thereafter, he descended frequently, bestowing books and composing poems.

The *Records of Immortal Gatherings* states: The Crone of Mount Li, of unknown era, once encountered Li Quan, who was fond of the Dao of transcendents and often traversed famous mountains, broadly collecting esoteric arts. In a stone chamber on Mount Song, he obtained a silk scroll of the *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman*, sealed most securely, inscribed: *“On the seventh day of the seventh month in the second year of Taihe under the Great Wei, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi concealed this in the famous mountains to transmit to those of like aspiration.”* Quan could not fathom its meaning. Journeying into Qin, at the foot of Mount Li, he encountered an old woman with a topknot, her remaining hair half-hanging, clad in tattered robes and leaning on a staff, her spirit and appearance most extraordinary. By the roadside, she saw a fire burning a tree and murmured to herself: *“Fire is born of wood; calamity arises and must be overcome.”* Quan heard this, stepped forward, and bowed, saying: *“This is the secret text of the *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hidden Talisman*.”* The crone replied: *“I have received this scripture for three kalpas and six cycles of sixty years—how does a youth like you come to know it?”* Quan prostrated himself, bowed twice, and fully recounted where he had obtained the scripture. He then entreated her to explain its profound meaning and received it in full.

Suddenly, the crone vanished.

**Section Twenty of the Daoist Canon**
**Section Twenty-One: Transmission (Part Two)**

*The Scripture of Golden Tablets and Jade Characters* states: The Yellow Emperor received from the Lad of Xiangcheng the method of the Six Steps of Ji. It further states: The Yellow Emperor, in his youth, received from the Lad the method of the Three Guiding Principles. And again: Guangcheng received from the Lad of the Eastern Central Primordial the method of the Six Offices.

*The Inner Transmission of the Primordial Beginning* states: The Most High dispatched an emissary clad in embroidered robes to convey the mandate to Yin Xi.

*The Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages of the Jade Emperor* states: The Seven Sages composed the chapters of the Supreme Mystery and entrusted them to the Five Elders.

The Lord of the Left of the Upper Realms and Immortal Capital concealed them within the Purple Elixir Jade Satchel, sealed with the Mandate-Opening Chapters. The Western Tortoise fixed the registers; the Eastern Flower verified the names.

*The Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens* states: The sacred registers of the Numinous Records of the Most High were kept in the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Most High, entrusted to the Lord of the Left of the Upper Realms and Immortal Capital of the Five Elders.

*The Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* states: In the time of Emperor Yu, the Nine True Kings of the Nine Heavens descended in a chariot drawn by nine dragons to the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue, where they bestowed upon the Emperor these true writings. It further states: All who receive the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity must prepare their faith—faith sealed by a vow, treasuring the Dao. To receive scriptures without faith is to transgress the celestial Dao; to transmit scriptures without a covenant is to leak the celestial treasure.

*The Hidden Writings of the Jade Clarity* states: There are imperial tablets of gold and records of dark jade, by which the *Scripture of the Dark Feather and Jade* may be transmitted. The *Scripture of the Dark Feather and Jade* is entrusted to the Jade Gentleman of the Dark Feather for transmission to the Perfected of the Supreme Clarity. It further states: The transmission of the *Hidden Writings of the Jade Wisdom of the Supreme Sovereign* and the *Feather Writings of the Golden Mystery* is overseen by the Five Elders, who examine the charts, while the Great Unity observes the celestial patterns. And again: The Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign commanded the True Man of the Great Elder to open the casket of pearl and produce the *Hidden Writings of the Jade Clarity* and the *Scripture of the Dark Feather and Jade*, transmitting them to the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity.

*The Twenty-Four Images of Life* states: The Celestial Emperor of the Primordial Beginning, in the Azure Grove of Long Sang, heard the August Lord proclaim to the Perfected and Sacred Spirits the profound and mysterious celestial writings of the *Numinous Treasure and Jade Mysteries*. And again: In accordance with the ancient statutes of the celestial treasuries, the *Regulations of the Palace of the Supreme True Jade Emperor of the Upper Realms* were transmitted to the Lord of the Dao, as recorded in the *Statutes of the Lady of Azure Youth*: the ancient scriptures, untransmitted for kalpas uncounted. And again: The August Lord, in the Pavilion of Harmonious Dawn, ascended the White Jade Throne, fully expounding the secret essentials and disclosing the wondrous gate.

*The Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: Laozi transmitted the scriptures, precepts, registers, and ritual instructions, saying: Place the scriptures upon a small-legged table, covering them with a silken cloth.

*The Scripture of Illuminating the Real* states: The August Lord of the Primordial Beginning expounded the *Scripture of Illuminating the Real* in the Grove of Fragrant Forest.

*The Central Scripture of the Great Clarity* states: The Dao says: Guard against selling, for I seek treasure. Guard against transmitting, for I am not the right person. Guard against concealing, for I sever my own learning. And again: *The Scripture of the Great Perfection* states: In the transmission from master to disciple, select those who above bear the marks of immortality, in the middle possess benevolence and filial piety, and below have talent, resolve, and steadfast purpose—only then transmit to them.

*The Scripture of the Supreme Perfection* states: The Most High said: To accomplish the Dao is to return to the origin, merging indistinguishably with the beginningless. Emerging beyond the Three Realms, one saves beings within the Nine Heavens. One delivers the living and those of goodness, bestowing prophecies upon the virtuous.

*The Scripture of the Dark Feather* states: Yuan Chuo inscribed golden tablets and jade tablets, transmitting them to Ge Xuan.

*The Scripture of the Golden Root* states: The Most High entrusted the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to the Blue Lad of the Upper Minister, who kept the registers in the Azure Palace of the Eastern Flower, transmitting them to later sages destined to become Perfected Ones. These golden tablets and jade slips emerged from the Palace of the Numinous Capital of the Most High, carved from jade into slips and bound with gold into tablets, inscribed in vermilion script and bound with vermilion cords.

*The Regulations of the Great Perfection* states: The Most High addressed Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, saying: The inner and outer methods accord with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—break the stone, drink the cinnabar, and swear the oath. Zhang Daoling received the mandate as Celestial Master and commanded his disciples to assist as successor masters. Ascending the Hall of the Lofty Void and mounting the Altar of the White Void, they performed the libation and memorialized the Great Unity, transmitting the oral instructions and the mandate to the successor masters, who inherited the foundation and propagated the teachings among heaven and humanity.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Master Pei said: Those who recite the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* ascend lightly. In former times, the Yellow Lord of the Center concealed this scripture, and the world knew it not. If one knows it, one guards it in secrecy and does not transmit it. And again: The Perfected of Purple Yang received from Lord Su the Dao of the Three-One and the Mysterious Elixir. And again: There was Lord Juanzi of the Northern Sea, who received the Dao of Guarding the One and the Mysterious Elixir! And again: The True Lady of the Central Attendant of the Eastern Palace received from the Perfected of the Paulownia and Cypress the Dao of the Flying Goblet and the Net of Liberation. And again: In former times, Lord Zhou studied the Dao in the mountains of Chang, cultivating his essence and thought for years. Suddenly, he saw an old man, knowing him to be a numinous being, and bowed his head to entreat the Dao. The old man produced seven scrolls of plain silk and bade him recite them. Lord Zhou departed as an immortal. And again: Zhao Shuqi studied the Dao on Mount Wangwu, often appearing among the people. He heard of a diviner in the marketplace and said: To enter the Gate of Heaven, harmonize the Three Passes, visualize the vermilion robes, and rectify Kunlun. Shuqi knew him to be a divine person and bowed, begging for the essential instructions. The man produced a book and gave it to him—*The Record of the Womb Essence*. Bowing in gratitude, Shuqi entered the mountains and recited it. Later, he compounded the divine elixir, ingested it, and ascended to heaven.

*The Inner Transmission of Lord Wang* states: Wang Zideng received from the Venerable Elder of the Most High the *Hidden Writings of the Jade Enshrouded* and the method of the Flying Elixir of Azure Yang Water. After ingesting it, he could perceive distant things, sit in disappearance, stand in vanishing, and command a host of spirits. And again: The Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity dispatched the Divine Consort of the Western Flower, Zhen Youxiao, to bestow the *Writings of the Mandate’s Completion*, inscribed on plates of cloud jade with purple gold, transmitting them to Lord Wang Zideng, the later sage.

*The Arrayed Records of the Lord of the Dao* states: The Lord of the Dao commanded the Five Elders and Upper Perfected to open the Purple Elixir Jade Satchel and the cloud-brocade bag, producing the *Upper Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script* and transmitting it to the Blue Lad.

*The Eight Essentials of the Perfected Scripture* states: If one is diligent in practice, one should inscribe the teachings on medicinal slips and carve them with jade script, thereby attaining the rank of Left Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity.

*The Scripture of Ascending Mystery* records: Zhang Daoling said, "I dare not transmit this teaching in person." The Most High replied, "How can you hesitate and thus obstruct the transmission of the Dao? You must resolve your intent and never say it cannot be passed on. If in the world there is a Daoist who obtains this immortal scripture, unfolds it to the end, and recognizes its true essentials—even without a master to transmit it—they may uphold and practice it."

*The Scripture of Heavenly Admonitions* states: Ge Xuan told his disciple Zheng Yin, "The virtuous Dao I once received is what the Most High treasures. Now, as your teacher and friend, I transmit it to you. When I depart this world, there will be a lay practitioner of compassionate heart who comes to be born in my lineage. You must transmit this entire teaching to them, for the Dharma is to be passed down through the generations. You should transmit one copy in accordance with the precepts to a worthy disciple. If no such person exists, seal one copy and deposit it in the Five Marchmounts."

It further states: Liu Yi, styled Zishuo, was a man of Yingchuan known for his virtue and power. His family had long practiced benevolence, moving others to compassion, and his hidden virtue reached even the spirits. The Most High commended his intent and sent Master Horse Healer to instruct him in the Dao of long life. "I am an immortal official," the master said. "Would you follow me?" Yi replied, "I wish to receive your teaching."

Then he entered Mount Tongbo specially to transmit the Eight Arts of Concealing Earth and instructed him in ingesting the essences of the Five Stars. Later, his name was changed to Donghua, and he came to reside in the grotto, serving as the Right Supervisor of the Register Repository.

It further states: Chunyu Zhen, styled Shutong, was a native of Kuaiji. During the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han, he served as magistrate of Xu County. Fond of Daoist arts, he frequently ingested sesame and Solomon’s seal. Later, he entered Mount Wumu in Wu to live in seclusion. Someone transmitted to him the *Rainbow Radiance Elixir Canon*, and through cultivation, he attained the Dao, serving in the grotto as the Dignitary of Law Enforcement, overseeing those of sincere and virtuous practice.

It further states: Tao Jun, a native of Qiantang, served as a minor official in his youth. At the end of the Han, he entered Mount Zengcheng to study the Dao, where he encountered Dongguo Youping. Youping, a man of the Qin era, had long concealed himself in Mount Zengcheng and attained the Dao. He transmitted to Jun the arts of ingesting the Nine Essences, refining qi, aligning with the stars, and stabilizing the mind. Jun cultivated these precepts and served in the Donghua Palace as the Controller of the Northern River.

It further states: Zhang Feng, styled Gongxian, was a native of Henei. The Grand Tutor Yuan Wei often praised his lofty conduct. Later, Feng entered Mount Shan, where he met the Master of the Mountain Chart, who transmitted to him the Nine Clouds Water and the Strong Yang Refinement of Cassia. In the Donghua Palace, he became the Immortal Marquis of the Supreme Ultimate.

It further states: Xia Fu, styled Zizhi, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he was fond of the Dao and ingested pine resin and mica. Later, he entered Mount Wu, where he received the Refinement of the Soul from the Red-Bearded Master. He also encountered the Perfected of Mount Tongbo, who transmitted to him the Yellow Water Cloud Nectar method. Having attained the Dao, he served in the grotto as the Attendant of the Bright Dawn.

It further states: Liu Kuan, styled Wenrao, of the Later Han, was fond of the Dao from his youth and served as Minister of Education and Grand Commandant. At the age of seventy-three, he encountered the Master of the Green Valley, who descended into his bedchamber and transmitted to him the Staff Liberation method. He entered Mount Taihua, practiced the Nine Breaths and qi ingestion, and was further instructed in the furnace elixir formula. Upon completing the Dao, he served in the grotto as the Supreme Master of the Youthful Beginning Repository, guiding beginning learners.

It further states: Liu Shaoweng frequently entered Mount Taihua, where he encountered the Old Man of the Western Marchmount, who transmitted to him the immortal Dao.

It further states: Huang Jinghua, daughter of the Minister of Works Huang Qiong, was instructed by Han Zhong in the Min Mountain Elixir and attained the immortal method through ingestion.

It further states: Zhao Weibo, a native of Dongjun, was fond of the Dao from his youth and studied under Master Deng E and Master Zhang. In his later years, he resided in the Central Marchmount, where he received the *Jade Pendant and Golden Earrings Canon* from Qiu Lin—a Daoist adept and wife of the Han general Lou Hong. He then practiced the Embrace of the Sun and Moon’s Radiance and ingested the Ninefold Luminous Mirror. Huang subsequently attained the Dao and served in the Huayang Realm as the Guardian of Life, overseeing the immortal registers and recording those who study the Dao. He also governed sudden rains and floods and presided over the Five Fungi, Gold, Jade, and Sacred Writings.

It further states: Zhang Xuanbin, a man of the Wei Emperor Wu’s time, encountered the Perfected Fan Ziming on Mount Shaoshi, who transmitted to him the arts of Daoist transformation and concealment of radiance. He resided on Mount Tianzhu.

The *Lingbao Canon* states: Beneath the trees of Mount Jialuo, three heavenly beings expounded the *Primal Yang Canon*.

The *Mingzhen Regulations* states: The Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning, in the Fragrant Grove Garden, taught and transformed all dharmas to the assembly.

The *Inner Tone Jade Scriptures* states: The Great Brahma concealed his words from the Queen Mother of the West. In the first year of the Supreme August, on the bingwu day of the seventh month, he taught them in the grotto chamber and transmitted them to the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, Lord Wang, who passed them to Yu the Great. The texts were sealed in a stone coffer in the Southern Floating Grotto Chamber. Thus, the *Five Talismans Canon* says: "The numinous writings of the Nine Heavens remain sealed in the stone coffer."

The *Jade Instructions, Lower Scroll* states: The Five Elder Perfected sealed and inscribed jade coffers—this is another such example.

The *Kong Lingfu* states: South of Mount Kuaiji lies Mount Wanwei, atop which stands a stone cliff locally called the Stone Coffer. Its sheer walls rise into the clouds, and one must ascend by ladder to reach it. In ancient times, when Yu was regulating the floodwaters and his work was not yet complete, he fasted at this mountain. Opening the stone coffer, he obtained golden tablets and jade script, through which he understood the configuration of mountains and rivers. Thereupon, he dredged and guided the hundred rivers, each according to its proper course.

The *Shangqing Canon* states: The Primordial Celestial Emperor and the Supreme Pole Lord of the Southern Culmen ascended the Jade Terrace of the Great Void. The Five Elder Perfected and the Immortal Capital opened the bamboo chest of the Fragrant Grove and the cloud-brocade satchel, transmitting the seventy-four methods of the *Shangqing* for transformation and dissolution of form, along with the *Three Primordials’ Arrangement of Scriptures*, to the Supreme Lord.

The *Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: The Queen Mother said, "This *Numinous Radiance Life Canon* may be transmitted to one person every four thousand years. For the *Primal Canon*, it may be transmitted to two persons every eight thousand years. To transmit to an unworthy recipient is to leak the heavenly Dao. To withhold transmission when one should is to block the heavenly treasure. To transmit recklessly without regard for limits is to trifle with the Heavenly Elder. To receive without reverence is to slight the heavenly ornament. Leaking, blocking, trifling, and slighting—these four bring calamity."

Those of the same Dao are called "heavenly kin"; those of the same mind are called "earthly affection." In transmission, one should cherish mutual affection and share honor and disgrace alike.

It further states: Emperor Wu of the Han personally compiled the teachings of the Queen Mother of the West into a single scroll, along with the associated scriptures and charts. These were placed in a golden table and sealed in a white jade case, then stored atop the Wuliang Terrace.

The *Image and Name Canon* states: The Supreme Lord of the East rests upon a curved table inlaid with the seven treasures and phoenix patterns, spreading the essential true scriptures.

The *Supreme Yellow Plain Canon* states: When studying and receiving the *Great Grotto True Canon*, one must always place the scripture on a clean, cool table or shelf.

The *Dharma Wheel Canon* states: Those who wish to transmit scriptures must present gifts of gold and treasure to their master and formally request the Dao. To honor the Dharma and revere the Way, one must not act merely through words. To transmit lightly is to treat the treasure as worthless; to cultivate emptily is to debase the Dao.

The *Assembled Chapters Canon* states: The ancients attained immortality through the mind, but in the latter age, one cannot transcend without wealth. This is to show that in the latter age, wealth is prized and the Dao is scorned. If one were to offer a catty of gold and a volume of immortal scripture to the barren mountains of the latter age, they would seize the gold and flee, leaving the scripture behind. The gold would be engraved as a personal treasure, while the immortal scripture would be engraved to attain long life.

Knowing this yet unable to curb greed—this is what it means to say the Dao does not ennoble man.

The *Great Possession Scripture* states: The Supreme Treasure Chapters were transmitted to the Grand Thearch, the Grand Thearch to the Heavenly Thearch, the Heavenly Thearch to the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity to the Thearch of the Golden Portals, and the Thearch of the Golden Portals to Green of the Eastern Sea. Upon receiving them, they swore an oath with gold—nine inches long, four inches wide, and three *fen* thick—engraved and inscribed to seal the true essence of the mountains, rivers, and Five Peaks.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes and True Unity* states: To swear an oath before the Three Officials, one presents silk and a blood altar, cutting leather and binding it with great vows, only then may the transmission be conferred. The oath serves to fortify the spirit and steel the heart, so that the myriad things cannot violate it, nor heaven and earth oppose it. One prepares one *liang* of plain silk, fasting for a hundred days, or fifty, thirty, twenty, or ten days. The method stipulates that one may transmit it only once every forty years.

The *Scripture of Receiving the Mysterious Cinnabar and Jade* states: Thirty-two feet of blue cloth, thirty-two feet of vermilion silk, two bright mirrors, and a vow of secrecy are required as an unbreakable covenant.

The *Hidden Writ of the Eight Arts and Divine Tiger* states: Those who seek to receive the Hidden Writ of the Eight Guards must present a golden dragon and jade fish as tokens of their oath. The same applies to receiving the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*. It further states: Ten *liang* of refined gold serve as a pledge to the divine perfected. Ninety feet of brocade are used to swear an oath to the Nine Heavens. Forty feet of blue silk seal the text. Only those who cherish the Dao, delight in truth, devote their hearts to profound study, and hold the Dao in higher esteem than material wealth may be spoken to of such matters. It also states: To receive the *Tiger Writ of the Three Heavens*, one must present a solid gold tiger, jade seals, forty feet each of plain silk and dark gauze, as a sacred oath before heaven and earth—an unspoken covenant.

The *Mysterious Scripture of the Grand Unity and Perfect Truth* states: In ancient times, those who transmitted scriptures swore oaths by drinking blood and cutting hair, erecting altars to pledge before heaven. Today, gold and silk may serve in place of flesh and hair. It further warns that violating this oath results in the loss of both eyes.

The *Scripture of the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother* states: The methods of *langgan*, *huadan*, the Five Stones, and *xuanyu* all require sworn covenants.

The *Scripture of Cultivating and Examining True Unity* states: The method of the Grand Unity may be transmitted only once every twenty-four years. It also states: The Jade Flower Consort of the Eastern Sea, younger sister of the Azure Lad of the Written Term, descended to bestow upon Zhang Weizi the method of ingesting mist. It further states: The Lord of the Immortal Dao commanded his attendants Fan Yunhua, Zhao Junzhu, and Wang Baotai to open the jade casket, unfurl the green scrolls, and produce the two-scroll *Dragon Writ of the Eight Numinous Perfected* of the *Supreme Clarity Hidden Writ*, which they transmitted to Fan Xiangping.

The *Scripture of the Great Thoroughfare* states: Ren An wandered deep into the mountains and forests, where in the Cold Numinous Grotto he encountered Master Xuanhe, who bestowed upon him the *True Writ of the Black Thearch of the Numinous Treasure*. It also states: In the West, the Nine Radiant Divine Lads bestowed the *True Writ of the White Thearch* upon the Imperial Consort. It further states: In the Land of Color, the Ageless Lad of the Center transmitted the *True Writ of the Red Thearch of the Numinous Treasure* to the Perfected Lady Xinran.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes* states: The Primordial Beginning, at the Bright Rosy Clouds Abbey, bestowed the Jade Tallies of the Perfected upon the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens.

The *Inner Biography of Ma Mingsheng* states: Gong Zhongyang received the method of *Buji* from the Lad of Mount Songgao.

The *Pearl Satchel* states: Lu Yuande, a native of Dongqian in Wuxing, was summoned into the palace by Emperor Wen of the Song. He served with reverence and was held in high esteem. At the time, Empress Dowager Wang was deeply devoted to the Yellow and the Old, humbling her imperial dignity to observe the rites of a disciple.

It is further stated: Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Pingyang in Weizhou. He styled himself the Recluse of Huayang. The Crown Prince of Emperor Wu of Liang received the Dao from him. The princes of Shaoling under Emperor Jianwen of Liang—Xie Lan, Shen Yue, Ruan Xin, and Yu Quan—all revered him as their teacher and served him with devotion.

It is further stated: Liu Faxian, a native of Pengcheng, served as the Director of the Chongling Abbey under Emperor Ming of the Song. The Emperor had first studied under Lu Yuande; after Yuande’s passing, he then studied under Faxian, observing the full rites of a disciple.

It is further stated: Xue Biaozhi, a native of Jinling, was well-versed in the methods of incense burners and divine crucibles, discerning their refinement and coarseness, mastering their difficulties and simplicities. When disciples sought instruction, he would teach them with earnestness, then dismiss them according to their capacity.

It is further stated: Xie Xuan, styled Yuanying, was a native of Yangxia in Chenjun. At the age of twelve, he left his family to enter Gaoshou Mountain, where he studied under Zhu Tianci, subsisting on a vegetable diet and observing long-term fasting while devoting himself to Daoist cultivation. Zhu was stern and severe, and Xuan was the only one permitted to enter his chamber. Though Xie later secluded himself on Yu Mountain, living in profound solitude, seekers from near and far flocked to him, filling the forests and valleys.

It is further stated: Yu Chengxian, styled Chongguang, was a native of Yanling in Yingchuan. From childhood, he was perceptive and erudite, mastering a wide range of texts. At the time, the scholar Liu Hongshuo, who was particularly versed in the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, was secluded on a sandbar in Jingzhou. Chengxian studied under him, delving deeply into his teachings. Though his family was poor and lacked books, he would borrow them, read them once, and commit them to memory.

It is further stated: Sun Youyue, styled Xuanda, was a native of Yongkang in Wuyang. During the Taishi era of the Song, Lu Yuande descended from Mount Lu to the capital to propagate the supreme teachings. Youyue then left the capital to seek the Dao and attend upon him, becoming one of the select few permitted to enter his chamber. The profound and abstruse doctrines were transmitted only to Youyue.

The *Record of the Great One* states: Master Pei meditated in seclusion for five years. The Five Thearchs declared: "You shall ascend to the Eight Poles City and the Luminous Terrace of the Perfected, where you will receive the arts of wielding the spirits of the Nine Provinces."

The *Register of the Jade Thearch* states: The Venerable Lord of the Primordial Beginning ascended the Altar of Jade Clarity and received the Registers of the Nine Heavens.

Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Yan Qing, a native of Kuaiji, lived in poverty. While in the mountains, he encountered a man who spoke with him and, upon parting, presented him with a scroll of plain silk. He instructed Qing to place it in a clean vessel on a high shelf and also taught him the method of ingesting stalactites. The twenty-first section of the Daoist Canon concludes here.
