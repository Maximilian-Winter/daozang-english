# 洞真太一帝君丹隐书洞真玄经

*The Great Concealed Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection: The Supreme One Sovereign Lord’s Esoteric Book of the Great Cinnabar*

Also titled *The Vast Chapters of the Three Primes*

When the Lady of the Purple Tenuity first received this scripture, she began with this invocation:

Crimson radiance drifts in the mystic dawn,
Purple chariots ride the cloud-borne journey.
Gazing upward, I transcend the Golden Gates within;
Looking down, I survey the Western Flower City.
Eastern auroras unfurl their fivefold brilliance,
Divine essence kindles the seven numina.
Veiled reflections trace the Three Torches,
Flowing freely, they align with darkness profound.
Winds stir the hollow vastness of the cosmos,
Incense smoke scatters through the Jade Court.
Hand in hand with the Weaving Maiden, I dance,
Twin sashes flutter in brocade hues of blue.
To the left, patterned banners of feathered script swirl;
Canopies of blossoms tilt with the drifting clouds.
Beyond the ninefold courts, I recline in banquet ease,
Right and wrong no longer occupy my mind.
Embracing emptiness within the Mud-Pill,
My celestial form cradles the sun’s embrace—
How could it compare to the filth of the mundane,
Where life drags on, joyless and bleak?

Verdant peaks of Fusang rise in the void,
Crimson spirits bloom with faintest light.
Above the night’s hush of the Azure Terrace,
Four vistas mirror the lofty clarity.
Flying effulgences rein the purple wheel,
Threefold purity guides the cinnabar carriage.
I repose in the Supreme Lord’s palace,
Wandering the courts of the Celestial Matriarch.
Bathed in the jade-green ripples of the swift stream,
I raise the jade ewer of sweet nectar.
At dawn’s curve, borne on the wind’s fan,
Jewelled gales descend in timely cascades.
A fleeting sojourn in the mists of Ruin,
Then turning my chariot, I drift through steadfast purity.
Mystic gatherings convene of their own accord,
Wandering at will through the dark unknown.
Only now do I know the bitterness of glory and shame,
Only now do I awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years.
In the secluded chamber, purity may be attained;
Nurturing the true awaits the sun’s fulfillment.
Why trouble oneself with the paths of the world?
A hundred afflictions arise from this very course.

The Lady of the Purple Tenuity is surnamed Wang, her personal name Qing’e, and her courtesy name Yuyin—she is the twenty-fourth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. The Palace of the Purple Tenuity lies beyond the Northern Ocean in the Featherbright Wilderness upon the Dark Mound Mountain, which stands northeast of Mount Kunlun.

The Lady of the Purple Tenuity addressed the Celestial Matriarch, saying: "Those who wish to ingest and absorb the qi of the sun and moon must first comprehend the images and manifestations of sun and moon. The sun is round in form yet square in its radiance; the moon is square in essence yet round in its manifestation. Radiance is concealed within form, essence hidden within image—radiance is crimson, image is yellow: these are the hun-souls of sun and moon. Only when one knows this Dao may one exhale and inhale the flowing rosy clouds.

The method for absorbing solar qi is practiced at dawn; the gathering of lunar essence is done at midnight. Visualize them nine inches before your face, allowing their light and image to illuminate your Mud-Pill Palace, descending to the Five Viscera, penetrating your entire form. Draw the qi into your mouth until its radiance and color become resplendent and bright; after a long while, the practice is complete. By this means, one may attain longevity."

The foregoing was recounted by the Lady of the Right Central Marquis regarding the Lady of the Purple Tenuity’s personal and courtesy names.

*The Supreme Lord’s Grand Cinnabar Hidden Book of the Cavern-Real Mystery*, this precious scripture is stored within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies of the Most High, presided over by the Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen—hence it is called *The Grand Cinnabar Hidden Book*. This text is also known as *The Seven Transformations and Nine Forms of the Imperial Lord*, *The Three Degrees, Five Essences, and Imperial Treasure of the Supreme One*, and *The Imperial One’s Fusion of the Three and Five to Establish Completion*. Each corresponds to the four seasons as a treasure, and thus they are collectively called *The Scripture of the Supreme One*.

Should you possess this text, you shall not die; should you revere it, you shall attain longevity; should you visualize it, you shall become a divine immortal; should you diligently practice it, you shall become a perfected spirit. The Supreme One, born of the Void, is the Lord of the Supreme Mystery, who commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to dispatch nine Jade Maidens of Jade Flower and seven Golden Flower Lads of Dawn to attend and guard *The Scripture of the Cavern-Real Mystery*, to protect the bodies of those who possess it and to succor the souls of those who bear its talismans. The Jade Lads and Maidens record all transgressions and blessings, speaking of the merits of those who cherish and cultivate it.

If you possess this scripture, you must establish a secluded chamber, keeping your dwelling undefiled. Ensure its circulation and communion with the unseen, awaiting the arrival of the true qi. Frequently burn incense to your left and right, bathe regularly, and silently visualize the spirits—let no one become aware of it.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate recorded in the three spring months: *The Supreme Lord’s Grand Cinnabar Hidden Book of the Cavern-Real Mystery*; in the three summer months: *The Seven Transformations and Nine Forms of the Imperial Lord*; in the three autumn months: *The Three Degrees, Five Essences, and Imperial Treasure of the Supreme One*; in the three winter months: *The Imperial One’s Fusion of the Three and Five to Establish Completion*. Thus, its names vary with the four seasons, perpetually arising in accordance with the nodes—this is what is meant by "the fusion of ten thousand transformations, not abiding in a single name." Such is the scripture of the supreme Dao, by which one attains the perfected spirits.

To study the Dao without the Supreme One is like gazing without two eyes; to visualize without the Supreme One is like a chest and abdomen devoid of the Five Viscera; to govern spirits without the Supreme One is like rising and walking without four limbs; to establish oneself without the Supreme One is like a corpse lying stiff without qi. It is for this reason that this scripture opens the pathways of the ten thousand spirits, generates and completes the soul and essence, and across a thousand roads and hundred paths, the Supreme One stands as the singular foundation. Without a teacher, one’s study is but vain toil.

Now, I have once more compiled the currents of this scripture, excerpting its outer boundaries. Though the profound and wondrous have not been fully expounded, nor the secret invocations entirely encompassed, it is named *The Supreme One’s Separate Instructions*. Should one be able to follow it, it will awaken the beginner to the subtleties of the end, instantly revealing the deep source.

Thus, these separate instructions circulate subtly among scholars, guiding them from coarse traces to jade-like enlightenment. As for the inner construction of the profound and mysterious, the convergence of myriad marvelous streams, the flowing communion of true spirits, the fusion of the numinous palace—brilliant and dazzling in the transformations of divine radiance, shining beyond the bounds of creation, resplendent as the full orb of light, still as the Great Void—when clouds arise in empty vastness and thoughts congeal, a thousand years pass like a single night, it may be called subtle indeed and profound! The Supreme One’s love is entirely expounded in this scripture; its affairs are wholly contained within the *Cavern Mystery*.

The Lady is born of the celestial hun-soul, formed from the primordial spirit. Revolving through the nine qi, she is endowed with the mandate of the Supreme One, opening the three pathways, accumulating spirit in the hidden palace. Thus, the seven coils of dark fluid flow forth with effulgent moisture; sun and moon illuminate her six voids; mouth and eyes move her divine instruments. Clouds drift and rain descends—her virtue emulates Heaven and Earth. Within the inner womb, the five factors come together, establishing the Dao of humanity as such.

The five factors are the five spirits; the three pathways are the three perfected. The five spirits are the hun-souls of Heaven; the three perfected are the Dao of Heaven; the nine qi are the embryo of Heaven; the Supreme One is the source of Heaven; sun and moon are the eyes of Heaven; dark fluid is the moisture of Heaven; the six voids are the light of Heaven; the hidden palace is the treasury of Heaven; the divine instruments are the transformations of Heaven; the primordial spirit is the metamorphosis of the Emperor.

When it speaks of the nine qi, it refers to the Supreme Lord’s fusion of transformations—transforming and becoming nine, these are called the nine palaces. Fusion and transformation return to oneness.

If you, the aspirant, wish to cultivate yourself and seek life, you must follow the origin from which you were born. That origin is your primordial father and mysterious mother. The primordial father governs qi, transforming and ordering the imperial predecessor; the mysterious mother governs essence, changing and knitting the womb. Essence and qi complete each other, like yin and yang generating one another. Clouds move and you are born—when the Dao harmonizes, it is nameless. The numbers arise from the three and five; you begin to receive form. When seven and nine have fully revolved, your body is complete. Harmonizing the three and five, seven and nine penetrate the unseen. Before the image of the Emperor, one must await the Emperor’s cultivation. The work of the Heavenly Sovereign—nine transformations become spirit. When the work is complete, body and spirit unite. When spirit departs, death follows; when spirit abides, life endures.

Thus, the Three Origins are the beginning of the Dao; the Imperial Lord is the root of the Dao; the Supreme One is the transformation of the Dao; the Nine Heavens are the spirits of the Dao; the Nine Palaces are the dwelling of the Dao; the Dark Field is the garden of the Dao; the dark fluid is the essence of the Dao.

After three years of cultivation, one may illuminate the Three Fields in the mirror, thereby attaining divine transcendence. By morning, one roams the Six Directions; by evening, one guards the Mud-Pill Palace, firmly holding the embryonic essence while the heart remains ever joyful.

Later disciples must take this as their foundation. Only those who encounter this scripture may begin to speak of the Ninefold Black Refinement and the Celestial Sovereign’s circulation of spirit. Since you have been born as a human—though humans are many—without the Celestial Sovereign’s spirit-tally, the Three Origins’ golden register, the Controller of Destiny’s hidden talisman, or the Five Elders’ purple records, though born of Heaven’s qi, you will never hear or see the supreme Dao.

Even if you lack the Dark Palace’s purple writ, the Supreme Sovereign’s precious name, the Celestial Sovereign’s jade register, the Eastern Florescence’s hidden chart, the Three Origins’ spirit inscription, or the Supreme Thearch’s tripartite soul, though you may briefly hear the supreme Dao by virtue of Heaven’s nature, you will be unable to cultivate it. Even if you could, you would not persist; even if you persisted, you would not be steadfast; even if steadfast, you would not be single-minded; even if single-minded, you would not attain thorough penetration. At best, you might conceal yourself among the Five Peaks or tread the path of enduring life, yet you would not ascend through the Eight Radiant Realms, riding mist and harnessing light, soaring on empty wings, leaping into the Great Void.

Without the Jade Terrace’s feathered writ, the Flowing Cloud’s Five Standards, the Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Pavilion, the Five Sovereigns’ hidden register, the Later Sage’s Seven Talismans in the Stone Casket of Hollow Mountain, the Cinnabar Terrace’s plain chapters, the Mysterious Yellow’s Five Phases and the Heavenly Mother’s Embracing Chart, the Supreme Lord’s circular name and the Register of Preserving the True and Refining Qi to Temper the Spirit-Ninefold—none may behold the *Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*, witness the transformations of the Imperial Unity, hear the chants of the Demon-Quelling Divine Tiger’s Wisdom, the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme Lord’s Eight Simplicities*, or the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*, the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Seven Origins’ Liberation.

The scriptures of the supreme Dao lie in profound obscurity. Only through diligent mindfulness and concentrated meditation may the numinous be activated and the spirit subtly stirred. When the Nine Spirits gather and the Celestial Sovereign’s tally is revealed, one may then hear the gate of mysterious subtlety, the root-source of life. How profound and wondrous—how could one not exert oneself?

Concentrate on the Celestial Sovereign, merging with the Primordial Emperor. The male and female spirits guard the gods, irrigating and flowing with the vast purity. Always ensure the Nine Heavens’ qi flows smoothly, so that the One unites with the Nine to achieve completion.

The essential teaching of the *Cavern of Perfection* is this: the body remains eternally preserved, vital fluids and blood generate spontaneously, the male spirit guards the Gate of Life, the female spirit protects the Chamber of Spirit, and the Celestial Sovereign never departs, enduring coeval with Heaven. Thus, the *Hidden Talisman of the Supreme Lord* states: "Preserve the male, guard the female—then even Heaven and Earth cannot surpass you."

Once this is cultivated, the Five Spirits guard their abodes, the Five Viscera flourish with blossoms, the numinous dwells in the Crimson Palace, the Emperor resides in the Mud-Pill, the hundred spirits become firm, and the embryonic seal closes the Gate of Life. Over time, the Three Ones’ spirits appear by night, and the Celestial Sovereign and Primordial Emperor descend at dawn, both manifesting in your chamber.

You must maintain purity and fasting, sever all external affairs, block the paths of deviance, moderate all interactions, and rarely engage in frivolous pursuits. Focus your mind single-pointedly, cultivate the Dao morning and evening without fail, bathe in the five fragrances, and seclude yourself in a quiet room. Burn incense to your left and right, awaiting the arrival of true qi.

The Way of the Celestial Sovereign particularly abhors the sight of blood, the stench of foul odors, and the pollution of impurities. If tears fall, the Imperial Lord grieves and is disturbed; if wailing issues from the mouth, the Celestial Sovereign congeals. When the Celestial Sovereign congeals, the Nine Qi cease their transformations, and the Three Ones grieve without gathering. If the Nine Qi do not transform, the Three Ones also congeal. As stagnation accumulates day by day, the generative qi leaks out, and the old qi circulates inward. When the old qi circulates inward, it marks the onset of illness and death.

Thus, the Perfected call the sound of wailing the voice of death and extinction, and tears the fluid that leaks essence. How could one not cautiously avoid them? If you encounter a corpse or prolonged mourning, the Imperial Lord incurs guilt and is demoted by the Supreme Lord, while the Celestial Sovereign faces punishment and is reprimanded in the Mysterious Void. Before three years have passed, you will surely perish.

Those who do not receive the Supreme Lord’s Dao cannot be counted among the disciples. Therefore, the deepest taboos are grief, wailing, impurities, sorrow, and tears—these disrupt the Celestial Sovereign and Imperial Lord’s refined concentration. Furthermore, one must not come into contact with corpses. After receiving this scripture, if you see forty-nine corpses, you will not attain longevity but will perish midway. If you see twenty-four corpses, you will temporarily pass through the Great Yin before reviving as an immortal.

For the form of a corpse, once glimpsed by the eyes, the embryonic ghost of the dead lingers in one’s thoughts. What the mind dwells upon is recorded in the Crimson Palace; what the Crimson Palace remembers, though forgotten, remains. Gradually, it manifests in the body, blocking the eyes that record thoughts. Be most cautious of this.

The sight of blood, corpses, funerals, impurities, wailing, and tears—these are the Celestial Sovereign’s deepest taboos. If you consistently maintain purity and fasting, your concentrated thoughts will readily resonate, your spirit will swiftly unite, the Celestial Sovereign will guard your life, and joy will merge with harmony. Practicing this for eighteen years, you will ascend to Heaven in broad daylight. This is the Perfected One’s path of reversing old age and returning to infancy.

You should regularly bathe in the five fragrances. The five fragrances are the greenwood incense. Its flowers and leaves have five nodes, five by five interlocking—hence it is called the five-fragrance herb. It repels evil qi, restrains hun and po souls, subdues demonic vapors, and induces numinous manifestations. Because of its five-by-five nodes, it benefits humanity.

This herb grows abundantly east of the Canglang River, so the divine beings of the East call it the greenwood incense. It is also said: burning greenwood incense, frankincense, and benzoin between the head of your bed and your sleeping place dispels the five turbid visions, halts the demonic qi of the earthly realm, and rises straight up to pierce the sky for forty miles. The smoke of this incense shatters the qi of turbid visions and clears the mists of deviant impurities. Thus, the Heavenly People, Jade Maidens, Celestial Sovereign, and Imperial Thearch descend within the fragrant qi, resting upon your face and eyes.

At midnight when burning incense, regularly perform this visualization—do not neglect or forget it.

Visualize the Three Ones, guard the Great One, refine the Cavern Chamber, and meet the Imperial Lord. Then nine numinous spirits will be transformed within your form, assisting your divine luminosity, perfecting your immortal truth, preserving your longevity, and securing your fetal soul.

The White Prime, Non-Flourishing, Peach Vigor, Controller of Fate, and Great One—these five spirits merge, bearing registers and arranging talismans. Each of the five spirits governs its domain; their fusion undergoes nine transformations. The Three and Five interpenetrate and evolve, thereby stabilizing the Three Palaces with true essence, infusing the hundred joints with numinosity. The Imperial Lord’s precious register ensures your predestined fate remains unshaken. Circulating through the ethereal smoke, it unlocks the mysterious essence. Suddenly, the twenty-four perfected beings arise: above, they open the Upper Prime; below, they open the Eight Nether-realms; to the left, they summon the Six Jia; to the right, they dispatch the Six Ding. The Jade Splendor draws the sun, the Great One merges with your form. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, your entire being ascends at dawn—ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

Those who cultivate this Way of the Great One all attain ascent to the Three Heavens. Thus it is said: “Ascend at dawn, ascend to heaven in broad daylight.” At the cock’s crow, you ascend into the empty void; by midday, you arrive above the Three Heavens. Midday is the “broad daylight,” the cock’s crow marks the “ascent at dawn.” Therefore, when visualizing the Great One’s fusion, frequently employ the moments of the cock’s crow and the arising of primordial qi.

If you possess the *Great One’s Cavern-Real Mystery Scripture*, keep it in a separate satchel, seal it in a precious vessel, and place it upon your altar. For every matter, pay homage as if attending the lord and father. For any undertaking or direction, first invoke and bow twice, secretly recite the names of the Nine Lords of the Great One, and state your request. Dream responses will reveal fortune or misfortune. For those whose hearts are truly refined, effects will manifest immediately upon waking.

If recitation, practice, and contemplation are required, copy a separate version for careful study, while the scripture on the altar remains revered and sacred.

When the Three Primes conceal and transform, they form the Three Palaces—named Grand Purity, Grand Simplicity, and Grand Harmony. Three threes make nine, hence the Three Cinnabar Fields and the Three Cavern Chambers. Combined with the Upper Three Primes, they constitute the Nine Palaces. Within the Nine Heavens and Nine Palaces dwell nine spirits, called the Nine Celestial Souls of the Heavenly Sovereign. These transform into nine qi, which become nine spirits, each governing one palace—thus the term “Nine Palaces.”

Within Grand Purity lie Grand Simplicity and Grand Harmony; within the Cavern Chamber lie the Hall of Light and the Crimson Palace—these are the Six Treasuries. Above is the Heavenly Treasury, below the Terrace of Radiance. The designations of the Three and Five differ in their positions.

First: within Grand Purity reside the Three-Five Imperial Lords.
Second: the Three-One spirits of the Cinnabar Fields.
The Five refer to the spirits of the talismanic registers: the Great One, the Lord’s Son, White Prime, Controller of Fate, and Lord Peach Vigor. Together, they are called the Three-Five, each with its own palace.

When the Three Perfected rest securely in their palaces, the Five Spirits ascend to meet the Imperial Lord. To the Imperial Lord’s left stands the Elder of Primordial Old, to his right the Old Lord of the Mysterious One. These, within the boundless, are the so-called Nine Lords. The uppermost is the True One. The Nine Lords are the celestial souls, the naturally perfected children of the Dao, serving as the spirits of the adept.

If the adept knows how to refine and visualize the Nine Lords, deeply contemplates the Three Perfected, they can embody the adept within the Three-Five, revolving through the seven and nine, ensuring the celestial spirits of the Heavenly Emperor always reside within them. The Five Spirits bear the registers in ceaseless circulation, and the adept will surely ascend in broad daylight—how could mere immortality suffice?

The Imperial Lord’s fusion revolves through the Three-Five; the Great One’s myriad transformations coalesce into seven nines, their number totaling twenty-four. Heaven possesses twenty-four qi, which evolve above. Through transformation, they become perfected beings. Humans also receive them, hence the body contains twenty-four spirits. Each spirit commands a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, traversing the eight directions. If you visualize and contemplate this without forgetfulness, you can evade death and seek life, transcend the ten directions, harmonize spirit and qi, commune with heaven, escape the earthly gate, pass through the celestial portal, conceal your breath in the four directions, disperse the Seven Stars, soar through the cloud chambers, plant roots in the sun and moon, guard gold and store jade, command the myriad spirits. What immortal king could you not become? You have already attained perfection.

This is the Way of concealed visualization, with its scriptural formulas recorded in the *Supreme August’s Utmost Treasure Radiance* chapter. Since you possess it, do not transmit it recklessly. You must swear an oath and scrutinize the recipient before imparting it.

The Way of the Imperial One is supreme. The seven nines undergo myriad transformations—what is called “one transforming into ten thousand, seven nines returning to one.” The Dao of heaven is not distant; the Three-Five return in cycles. If you know the One’s supremacy, you attain longevity and flight as an immortal. If you know the Three-Five, you traverse the world. Without knowing the One’s supremacy, though alive, you lack roots. Without knowing the Three-Five, your body returns to dust. These words are true.

The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: “Heaven has nine souls—do not fail to distinguish them. The Dao has three perfected ones—do not depart from the body. The Imperial One transforms scenes, myriad changes arrive. Flowing pearls halt their radiance, purple clouds surge in smoke. Seven paths turn back, three luminaries reflect the true. The Supreme’s essence-talismans become kin.” These words are wondrous.

The *Highest Divine Numinous Empyrean Scripture* also states: “Souls arise from the formless, spread through the Nine Palaces. The Dao emerges from the Three Ultimates, ever roaming the Crimson Palace. The Three Palaces fuse and transform—this is the Purple Chamber. Where the Purple Chamber resides, it first passes through the Hall of Light. If the adept knows this, they may open the Golden Gate.” The Golden Gate lies within the Cavern Chamber.

It further says: “Merge and unite them, entering and exiting the Imperial Realm. The Three and Five unite as one—you will surely become an immortal king.” This refers to the moment of fusion, the Way of the Three Perfected and Five Spirits.

The Imperial Realm is the domain of the Grand Clarity.

Thus, the *Central Chapter of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: “The Two Elders stand to left and right; the Imperial Soul must not remain undivided. The Three and Nine transform above and below; the Great One establishes its central root. The Five Spirits present my register of life; the Controller of Destiny seals my gate of death. The Nine Palaces merge into one; the Six Harmonies gather the inner truth.” These words describe the differentiation of palaces and the fusion of transformations.

This Way is the precious practice of the Supreme, the root of long life, the establishment of the human Imperial Ancestor, the origin of the Dao, the immortal lineage of the life-palace, the secret writ of the Imperial Register, the marvel of the Cavern Truth, and the essential scripture of the Nine Palaces.

The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* says: “The Nine Souls separate and unite; the Three Luminaries share their radiance. The Celestial Sovereign abides in the Primordial; purple mists billow forth. The Five Spirits present the chart; essence and life remain unharmed. Transforming and entering the Nine Palaces, one dons a crimson robe, a tiger-patterned sash, and a cloud-embroidered mantle. The canopy and mantle shimmer with motley hues; the five colors swirl. Sun and moon illuminate and inspect, flanking east and west. The divine court resides within the body, dispelling hunger and thirst. The Three and Five return anew, revolving the hidden mechanism. Circulating through the Great One, they harmonize the Two Modes.” This refers to the Celestial Sovereign dwelling within the Grand Clarity, the Great One receiving nourishment, and the Five Spirits presenting the talismanic register—when the adept visualizes the sun and moon flanking and illuminating.

This central scripture expounds the names and affairs of the Great One; thus, it is recorded here.

At the hour when *qi* is born at midnight, or at cockcrow, lie supine with eyes closed and gently inhale. Visualize the sun emerging from the left eye and the moon from the right, each nine inches in diameter, positioned above the ears. The space above the ears is called the High Window of the Six Harmonies. Let the sun and moon illuminate the entire body, penetrating inwardly to the Muddy Pellet, then downward to the five viscera and intestines, perceiving all with clarity, thoroughly illuminating within and without. Let the body merge with the light of the sun and moon. After a long while, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:

“Supreme Mysterious One, the Nine Augusts exhale their essence. Three, Five, and Seven transform, penetrating the hidden depths. Sun and moon cast their light, descending to the divine court, flanking and illuminating the Six Harmonies. The Great One abides in yellow tranquility. The Imperial Lord commands the writ; the golden script does not falter. The Five Elders present the talisman; heaven and earth unite in sincerity. Grant that I shall not die, attaining true numinosity. Obstruct the myriad evils; calamities and harms be pacified. Ascend to the Celestial Sovereign, returning to youth from old age. By the decree of the Supreme Emperor, the hundred spirits heed with reverence.”

Then open the eyes. This is called “Refining the Root with Sun and Moon,” “The Three Origins Rectifying the Soul,” by which one governs form and spirit, repels all demonic *qi* that may invade, and ensures long life and immortality. Practice this every night.

Further visualize the left eye as the sun and the right eye as the moon, merging in the divine court, then ascending into the Hall of Light, where they transform into the yellow essence of nectar, flowing into the mouth. Swallow nine times to nourish the Great One. At the hour when *qi* is born, complete the visualization and softly recite:

“Essence of sun and moon, yellow water and lunar radiance, the Great One comes to drink. Divine light soars high; grant me long life, that heaven and earth share the same bough.”

After five days of practice, the tongue becomes the divine court. After visualizing the sun and moon, stir the tongue and perceive a yellow spring, like the color of purple gold, flowing from the tongue and ascending into the Hall of Light—this is the nectar of yellow essence. During visualization, close the eyes and banish all thoughts.

On the evening of the new moon, at the hour when *qi* is born, lie supine with eyes closed and face upward. Visualize twenty-four stars, each one inch in size, linked together. Within each star, visualize a person, totaling twenty-four, all appearing as newborn infants, unclothed. Then, see the twenty-four stars descending from the empty void of the heavens, encircling the body three times. After three circuits, swallow them one by one, totaling twenty-four swallows, each time perceiving the ingestion of a star. Feel them descend directly into the navel, called the Palace of Life Reception. Further perceive the starlight illuminating the abdomen, thoroughly penetrating the five viscera. Visualize the starlight transforming into twenty-four perfected beings, all exhaling yellow *qi* like mist, filling the navel and suffusing within and without. After a long while, softly intone:

“Twenty-four Perfected, return to the Yellow Court. Mouths exhale yellow *qi*; twenty-four stars irrigate my Gate of Life. The hundred spirits receive numinosity; my bones grow strong. Soul and spirit find peace; the five viscera receive the talisman. Heaven and earth incline toward one another.”

This is called “True *Qi* Entering to Guard the Gate of Life,” dispelling disasters, misfortunes, and the hundred demonic afflictions, granting long life and immortality.

The Grand Nonbeing merges to resemble the child of the One Numinous Void, becoming the Lord Imperial Sovereign. Dwelling within the Muddy Pellet as the Imperial Sovereign, it becomes the honored sovereign of the Three Ones. This honored sovereign is the child of the Void-Born. These are called the Three Emperors.

The Great One receives life in the empty cavern, transforming throughout the eight directions, establishing its radiance among the Three Emperors, flowing and converging at the summit of the myriad spirits. The honor of heaven and earth both depend on the Great One for their spontaneous movement. Without the Great One, the Numinous Emperor’s mysterious void would not revolve *qi*; without the Great One, the Honored Emperor’s Three Ones would not reside in their palatial domains. Thus, the spirit of the Great One, together with the Five Spirits, functions in unison, lodging its form within the Three Emperors. The eminence of the Emperor is like that of the Celestial Sovereign and the Lord Emperor.

The Nine Souls assume form; souls arise from the Three and Five. The Three and Five unite and converge, coalescing into the Imperial Sovereign. Such is the birth of the Emperor.

Receiving the supreme *qi* from the midst of the Mysterious, where the Three and Five separate and unite, it emerges. Thus, the Emperor is born beyond the Ultimate Nonbeing, within the completion of the Mysterious, manifesting in the domain of the Grand Clarity. Its governance resides in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Clarity. Radiant with five colors, its canopy has nine layers. Before it lies the Cavern of the Muddy Pellet; behind it opens the Dark Gate. Below, it overlooks the Six Harmonies; above, it connects to the purple clouds. A hundred officials stand guard; flying pavilions interlink. Jade halls and vermilion steps contain golden chambers, within which abides the Supreme Perfected, titled the Celestial Sovereign. Born from the void, dwelling in the midst of the Non-Ultimate, clad in a robe of five-colored pearls, crowned with the Nine-Virtue Dawn Crown, it governs the celestial ridge. At times, it rides a six-reined jade dragon, traversing the nine paths of the void with spontaneous ease.

This is the essence of spontaneous primordial qi, the Sovereign Lord of all Perfected Ones. Those who constantly contemplate and invoke it may become Immortal Kings.

Within the Grand Tenuity reside the Three August Ones: the first is the August Lord, the second the Celestial Sovereign, and the third the August Elder. These are all the perfected beings of the Three Origins’ qi, spontaneously coalesced from the primordial chaos. Each of the Three Origins is ruled by one Lord, and together they dwell within the Grand Clarity.

The Grand Clarity contains three palaces: the supreme is the Palace of the Celestial Emperor Lord; to the left lies the Palace of Grand Simplicity, and to the right the Palace of Grand Harmony. These three palaces are located at the Gate of the Muddy Pellet, within the Non-Ultimate. Thus, the August Lord governs the One, holding fast to the divine刚; the Celestial Sovereign oversees the Two, transforming the luminous and preserving the form; the August Elder supervises the Three, maintaining control over the myriad spirits. The Great One blends and unites them, engendering the adept’s body. Thereupon, the Three and Five divide and transform, filling the Nine Palaces. Thus, the spirit of the Great One is the master of transformative generation.

The Lord of Grand Simplicity, Yuancheng Laozi, is also the celestial hun-soul, governing within the Grand Clarity and the interior of the Curved Array. He constantly attends the Emperor Lord, presiding over the qi of the primordial origin, and is titled the Lord of Grand Simplicity. The Lord of Grand Harmony, Huangcheng Laozi, is the celestial po-soul, also governing within the Grand Clarity and the interior of the Curved Array. He is titled the Lord of Grand Harmony and constantly attends the Celestial Emperor, presiding over the qi of the embryonic origin.

The two Lords, Grand Simplicity and Grand Harmony, are the hun and po of Heaven and Earth, born of spontaneity. Yuancheng Laozi, within the Grand Clarity, constantly attends the Emperor Lord; Huangcheng Laozi constantly attends the Celestial Emperor, moving in and out of the Purple Tenuity, residing precisely upon Kunlun, within the Yellow Gate and Purple Chamber. The Great One intermingles with them, the three qi of primordial chaos forming the root of the Great Dao. If you constantly contemplate this, the Emperor will abide with you forever.

On the second and third nights of the month, at midnight, practice the method of visualizing Yuancheng Huanglao. Lie down, close your eyes, and first envision the Central August Emperor Lord within the Supreme Ultimate. Next, visualize to the left the Elder Yuancheng Laozi, clad in a green robe, wearing the Nine-Splendor Radiance Crown, holding green lingzhi in his left hand and a green banner in his right. Then visualize to the right the Lord of Grand Harmony, Huangcheng Laozi, dressed in a white robe, wearing the Five-Splendor White Crown, holding golden night-essence in his left hand and a white banner in his right, both within the Supreme Ultimate.

Within the Supreme Ultimate are nine names; within the Grand Clarity are the Five Emperors, Six Treasuries, and Nine Palaces—these domains are one and the same. They are: first, the Grand Clarity; second, the Supreme Ultimate; third, the Grand Tenuity; fourth, the Purple Chamber; fifth, the Dark Terrace; sixth, the Emperor’s Hall; seventh, the Celestial Treasury; eighth, the Yellow Palace; and ninth, the Jade Capital and Dark Metropolis.

In short, one *cun* directly downward from the nape of the neck lies the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, which is one *cun* square. The Palace of the Supreme Ultimate is above the Palace of the Six Harmonies. The Palace of the Six Harmonies is where the spirit of the Great One resides. One *cun* inward from the space between the eyebrows is the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward is the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward is the Cinnabar Field. North of the Hall of Light and south of the Cavern Chamber, one *cun* above the space between the eyebrows, lies the Palace of the Six Harmonies, which is one *cun* square.

After visualizing the Three Perfected Ones, next visualize your own hun-soul, in your own likeness, ascending into the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. The two Elders then bestow upon you green lingzhi and golden liquid-essence. Proceed to visualize consuming the green lingzhi and drinking the essence. The green lingzhi resembles a lotus blossom, and the liquid-essence resembles fine wine. After consuming them, visualize yourself bowing twice before the Emperor Lord and saying: “Today, I report to the August Lord of the Green Emperor in the court. You have bestowed upon me divine lingzhi and golden liquid jade-essence. The two Elders have transmitted the register; the Great One has presented the writ. May I attain long life and enduring vision, my lifespan without end.”

Then visualize the Emperor Lord replying: “Fortunate one, return on the second and third nights of the next month.” Once this is complete, proceed to ingest the elixir. This is called “receiving the Emperor’s medicine within the Purple Chamber.”

Thus, the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons* states: “The hun-soul may seek sustenance, ascending to the Supreme Ultimate. The two Elders confer destiny; this is the power of the Emperor Lord.” This is what it refers to.

When visualizing the Supreme Ultimate, always enter through the space between the eyebrows. The space between the eyebrows is the Jade Gate of the Muddy Pellet, called “Guarding the Inch,” the Yellow Gate and Purple Chamber.

On your natal day, or the first day of the first month, or at noon on any of the six *wu* days, don your cap and sash, enter your chamber, face north, and bow twice. Recite the incantation: “August Emperor Lord, Supreme Jade Dawn, Primordial Elder of August Heaven, Unsurpassed Great Dao, your humble descendant Wang (surname) of Jia (generation name), wishes the Emperor Lord eternal peace within my Purple Chamber Palace.”

At the hour of *ren ding* (night’s quietude), enter a secluded chamber, lie down properly, close your eyes, and face upward. Visualize the great bright star at the center of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Ultimate, its essence radiant with pure yellow qi descending. Draw it before you and guide it into your mouth, swallowing thirty-seven times before stopping. Visualize the yellow essence and qi filling your Grand Granary, the Yellow Court, the lower Cinnabar Field, and descending to the Earth Gate of the Yin Chamber, circulating throughout your entire body until all is complete.

Then visualize five persons within the Purple Chamber Palace, suddenly transforming into the Five Emperors. The Celestial Emperor Lord stands at the center. The Great One ascends and kneels before the Emperor, presenting your life register. The Director of Destinies stands behind, removing your death record. Visualize erasing the death record. The death record is a black tablet with white writing; the life record is a white tablet with green writing. Visualize a white jade tablet and a green malachite brush. The Director of Destinies advances and presents this white tablet and green brush to the Emperor Lord. The Emperor Lord faces south and writes: “Wang (surname) of Jia (generation name), from such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, born in such-and-such year, shall ascend to the Supreme Mystery, attain all desires, become a Perfected One and an Immortal. All under Heaven who see him shall call him a Perfected One. The Great One may command him, protecting his body, eternally nurturing him with the sun and moon, granting him a lifespan of a million years.”

Moreover, visualize a register tablet, one piece, one *cun* in length and five *fen* in width. Concentrate intently upon inscribing its characters, ensuring each is vividly clear.

Next, visualize the Five: Taiyi, Gongzi, Baiyuan, Siming, and Taojun, ascending from the Palace of the Six Harmonies into the Purple Chamber. Within the Purple Chamber, each presents a green jade tray, upon which lies a talisman, each inscribed in shades of azure and verdant green. They offer these to the Emperor Lord, who takes the talismans in turn and bestows them upon the aforementioned, transforming them into the Four Emperors.

The first Emperor is named Diaoliangji, styled Qingping;
the second, Changlaijue, styled Nanhe;
the third, Zhang’anxing, styled Xihua;
the fourth, Baochenghe, styled Beifa.

Visualize these Four Emperors together reciting the Five Talismans. Upon completing the recitation, they present the talismans to you. Receiving them, you kneel before the Emperor Lord and ingest them in sequence. Visualize each talisman as one *cun* in length and five *fen* in width.

Once this is done, visualize the Four Emperors ascending through the void into the Three Heavens. As they depart, each addresses you: “Should you constantly hold our names in mind, you shall avert all harm, attain longevity without death, for we are the children of the Supreme One, the Perfected within the Three Primes. We transmit the Five Talismans into your form, that you may endure eternally between Heaven and Earth and achieve transcendence.”

If it is spring, visualize the Emperor Qingping, offering a goblet of azure nectar, one *sheng* in volume, served in a green jade bowl, for you to drink. After partaking, the Four Emperors ascend together into the Three Heavens. The same pattern applies for summer, autumn, and winter, with the colors of the nectar and bowls corresponding to the season.

Further, visualize to the left of the Emperor Lord the Elder of Dark Unity, clad in purple robes and crowned with a dragon coronet. To his right stands the Elder of the Three Purities, dressed in brocade and crowned with a tiger coronet. These dragon and tiger coronets resemble the *yuanyou* crowns of the mundane world, adorned with dragon and tiger motifs.

The Elder of Dark Unity is named Lin Xufu, styled Lingshi Dao.
The Elder of the Three Purities is named Lao Zhangshang, styled Shensheng Dao.

Both Elders are accompanied by Orthodox Unity Immortals: to the left, Zhong Chengzi, also named Dibin, styled Sihua; to the right, Qu Wenzi, also named Guangjian, styled Linghe. Their attire and crowns mirror those of the two Elders.

Next, visualize Siming descending into the Palace of the Six Harmonies to approach the Taiyi Palace. Siming unites with Taiyi, and Taiyi ascends to petition the Emperor Lord to transmit your talismanic register. Taiyi addresses the Emperor Lord: “The talismanic register has been transmitted, Siming has united with the form, the Four Emperors have bestowed the nectar, and the Supreme One has recorded your life. We request that your name be inscribed and the register be issued to the Two Elder Lords.”

Thereupon, the Emperor Lord suddenly produces your life register from his bosom and presents it to the Left Elder. From his bosom, he also produces your Five Talismans and hands them to the Right Elder. The Two Elders receive the talismans and register, then declare to the Emperor Lord: “The life record of so-and-so is now fixed, ensuring his eternal existence in the world. The Five Talismans of the Emperor are recorded above in the Palace of Grand Simplicity.”

The Two Elders then command the Two Orthodox Unity Immortals, Zhong Chengzi and Qu Wenzi, to bear your life register and Five Talismans upward to the Jade Purity, Grand Simplicity, Supreme Three, Upper Clarity, Lofty Mystery, and the Nine Heavens’ Palaces. They proclaim the Emperor’s decree to transmit your life register, enabling your attainment of divine transcendence, and bestow upon you the title of Perfected Worthy. The Two Elders issue their commands, and all is duly recorded. The two Immortals then ascend with your talismans and register through the Nine Heavens, and after a long while, all is accomplished.

Next, visualize Siming and Taiyi separating their forms, each becoming distinct, and together roaming the Grand Clarity, inspecting and governing the hundred spirits of the body. Once their circuit is complete, they return to their respective palaces. This is called the Great Transformation of the Original Destiny Emperor Lord through the Union of the Hundred Spirits.

When the Five Emperors establish the record and the Two Elders determine life, it is the moment of the Union of Original Destiny. During this union, the affairs are numerous and complex; if you cannot fully comprehend them, you may perform the rites in a secluded chamber, following the text as you recite.

The Three Ones’ deities—the Heavenly Emperor of the Mud-Pill Palace, the Heavenly Emperor of the Cinnabar Palace, and the Heavenly Emperor of the Gate of Destiny—each reside in their respective palaces. These are the sons of the Purple Chamber Emperor Lord. During the Union of Original Destiny, first visualize the Three Heavenly Emperors of the Three Ones, each settled in their palaces. These palaces have their own Three Ones’ scriptures. The myriad transformations of the Union described here do not pertain to the Three Ones’ Heavenly Emperors. The Three Ones’ Heavenly Emperors have their own times of union, each with distinct methods and practices.

The Emperor Lord presides over transformation, Taiyi over life, Siming over destiny, Wuying over essence, Baiyuan over the hun and po souls, and Taokang over the numinous spirit. Each person possesses Five Registers and Five Talismans, bestowed by the Emperor Lord and held by the Five Spirits, each governing one aspect. These safeguard your original destiny, erasing death and ascending to life. Without the affairs of Taiyi, none can attain life. Even if one aspires to the Dao, seeks life with utmost sincerity, and exhausts all emptiness, it will be of no avail. Though one may possess virtue surpassing Heaven and Earth, merits renowned in the Three Bureaus, and a nature of utmost gentleness that moves the myriad spirits, without contemplating and holding fast to the August Lord, inwardly cultivating the Three and Five, returning the Five Registers and presenting the Five Talismans, and causing Taiyi to petition the Emperor Lord on your behalf to seek transcendence, you will ultimately be unable to transcend the seventy-nine trials and ascend to fill the ranks of the Immortal Offices.

The names of the various Emperors, the One Lord, the Two Elders, and the Three Perfected and Five Spirits must not be disclosed to others, lest calamity befall your family. The precious instructions of Taiyi are transmitted only after a covenant. These precious instructions are the *Scripture of the Wondrous Perfection of the Cavernous Mystery*. First, scrutinize the recipient, then swear an oath with gold and azure, replacing the blood covenant.

Moreover, daily visualize your Three Hun souls entering the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, where they may companion the Emperor Lord—this is most excellent.

Moreover, on your natal day, you must refrain from speaking of inauspicious matters. Instead, seclude yourself in a chamber and visualize the qi of life, performing virtuous deeds. Take care never to transgress this.

Taiyi is the essence of the embryonic sac and the master of transformation. The hun and po souls are born of the womb spirit, while the life qi emerges from the uterine palace, uniting with the Emperor Lord to blend and transform into a human being. Thus, the spirit of Taiyi is the mother of life, and the majesty of the Emperor Lord is its father.

Taiyi is named *Wuyou Shou*, styled *Gui Huichang*, and also called *Jieming* or *Jipin*. These are the true names recorded in the *Three Primordials Cavern Mystery Inner Treasure Scripture*. The names found in external manuals and miscellaneous compilations are neither authentic nor real. These true names must never be disclosed to others. Those who know them shall attain longevity and immortality, repel all calamities, and summon divine spirits and jade maidens to descend.

Each evening, visualize Taiyi within your Six Harmonies Palace, or at your side, whether sitting or lying down, facing any direction. When visualizing the qi of life, complete the invocation thus:

*"The essence of Taiyi arises from the Grand Clarity.
Hun and po receive transformation, form and shadow become spirit.
It commands the hundred spirits, restrains the Three Yang.
The Emperor Lord presides over mist, uniting with the Perfected in Huichang.
Within, it stabilizes essence and qi; without, it wards off disasters and misfortunes.
It expunges the register of death, extends life, and ensures eternal youth.
Clothing and appearance, youth and age, shift without constancy.
It ever governs the Six Harmonies, circling the Crimson Palace,
Descending to the Cavern Gate, ascending to the Mysterious Realm.
Blending the Three and Five, it roams and rests in the Celestial Court,
Summoning the sun and moon, transforming yin and yang.
It seizes your talismanic register, the sac of the embryo,
The mandate of life and death—Taiyi upholds and guides you."*

Visualize Taiyi’s form as identical to your own, even in clothing. Therefore, your body must always be purified and cultivated to seek union with the radiant Taiyi. Do not share garments, headscarves, or belongings with those of differing qi. Observe such precautions diligently.

If you cannot practice grain avoidance through diet or refine the truth through concentrated meditation, you must at least abstain from all impure, bloody, or foul foods—meats, pungent herbs, and the like—completely. If you can do this, even briefly, you will improve, and your lifespan may be extended.

The Left Azure Lad is the master of the Field of Essence, the spirit of the Upper Qi of the Three Primordials. He binds the Field of Essence to the Celestial Essence, where essence is born and returns to the Three Qi. Thus, the Left Azure Lad ever holds the talismanic mandate of spirit and essence. He is named *Xuan Yuan Shu*, styled *He Fu Zi*, and also called *Yuan Su Jun* or *Shen Gong Zi*. He resides within the Jade Chamber of the Upper Clarity. Each evening, after visualizing him, recite the invocation:

*"Supreme Jade Perfected, imperial essence linked,
Three Primordials’ azure qi, Grand Mystery’s purple dawn.
Nine Empyreans rise in brilliance, Five Florets generate mist.
Within the Yellow Watchtower’s golden chamber stands a great spirit,
Grasping fast the flowing bell, crowned with a floral diadem.
A purple canopy swirls in the whirlwind, adorned with dragon and tiger patterns.
His countenance resembles a child’s, the Four Numinous in harmony.
Emerging from cinnabar, entering the void, he unites form with the Emperor Lord.
Summoning yin, calling forth yang, the Dao of Heaven holds truth.
Named Xuan Yuan Shu, styled the Azure Lad,
He traverses the Nine Paths, dispersing and transforming the Five Constants.
He engenders me, sustains me, and abides with the Dao forever."*

The Right White Prime is also called the Cavern Yang Lord. He governs the qi of the hun and po souls and oversees the spirit-fluid numen. Thus, the hun and po are born in the Palace of the Nine Numinous, while the spirit-fluid circulates through the truth of the Three Qi. The one who presides over them is named the White Prime Cavern Yang Lord, holding the talismanic mandate of the hun and po. The White Prime is named *Yu Ling Biao*, styled *Xuan Yi Jue*, and also called *Zhu Jing* or *Qi Cheng*. He resides within the Jade Hall of the Upper Clarity. Each evening, after visualizing him, recite the invocation:

*"Supreme divine essence, lofty and pure, Nine Lords,
Three Qi congeal and transform, aligned with the Gate of Spirit.
Clad in dragon robes, girded with tiger belts, he restores life and revives the hun.
At his waist hangs the Jade Scripture, crowned with the Yellow Dawn’s floral diadem.
Holding the register and talisman, he breathes and blends the mixed divisions.
Named Yu Ling, styled White Prime,
He roams with me, ascending to the Yang Barrier,
Circling the Nine Clarities, within the Six Harmonies.
Below, he nourishes essence and fluid; above, the Mud Pill’s Upper Prime.
The hundred spirits uphold and guide, each guarding its treasure palace.
Once the inspection is complete, he returns to rest in the Yellow Chamber."*

The Central Controller of Destiny is also called the Lifespan-Regulating Elder. He governs the root of one’s natal year and holds the records of longevity and early death. Taiyi transforms the hun and arranges the talismans under the Controller of Destiny, while the Controller of Destiny blends with the hun to face the Emperor Lord. Thus, the Controller of Destiny oversees the tally of years, the handle of lifespan’s length or brevity. Through the great blending of talismanic registers, he is called the Elder. He is named *Li Ming Chu*, styled *Xuan Du Xiang*, and also called *Shen Zong* or *Ling Hua*. By day, he governs the Darkest Palace, communicating with the Yin Chamber and moving in and out through the two gates of the Spirit Hut. By night, he resides in the Mysterious Chamber, within the Earth Gate, below the Dark Palace, and above the Six Harmonies Palace—one realm between them.

The Yin Chamber refers to the two nostrils. The Controller of Destiny enters and exits through the nostrils, not between the eyebrows. At night, he resides in the Mysterious Chamber, which is the Jade Stem (penis), while the Earth Gate is the scrotum. For women visualizing this, locate him within the northern extreme of the Yin Gate. Each evening, visualize him and, upon completion, recite the invocation:

*"The imperial hun of the One transforms into the Nine Palaces,
Blending the Three Perfected, shifting radiance in the Emperor’s court.
Darkest Palace, Mysterious Gate, within lies the celestial numen,
Circling the Seven Revolutions, the hundred spirits unite.
Holding the tally, grasping the reckoning, the essence of the Controller of Destiny,
Clad in dragon robes, girded with tiger skirts, crowned with the Seven Stars’ headscarf.
Ever within me, stabilizing my form,
Styled the Elder, named Li Ming,
He ascends to communicate with the talismanic mandate,
Granting me long life.
The Three Primordials and Six Palaces, the ten thousand gates harmonized,
Commanding the spirit qi, uniting with me,
The dragon wheel lingers, together we ascend to the Grand Clarity,
Equal in radiance to the sun and moon,
Profound and obscure, inscribing life in the azure register,
Heaven and Earth both incline."*

The Peach Lord of the Gate of Life governs the mandate of received qi, being the Lord of Primordial Qi. Returning essence to spirit, refining essence into whiteness, merging to transform the primal circle, standing forth at the inception—truly the resource of Heaven and Earth, the numinous origin of yin and yang. The treasure of the Golden Gate, Jade Pass, and Chamber’s Portal all submit their mandate to the qi of the Peach Lord.

Thus, when the Great One returns the radiance, the Imperial Lord unites the hun-souls. "Returning the radiance" means blending all transformations as one; "uniting the hun-souls" means transmuting essence-fluid to engender life. The inception of essence-transformation is intoned by the Peach Lord, thereby distinguishing the signs of male and female.

The Peach Lord is named Child Dao-Kang, styled Harmonizing Essence-Prolonging, also called Mandate Jade or Womb Root. By day, he governs within the Five Domains of the Golden Gate—this is the Gate of Life at the navel’s center, the palace of the Lower Cinnabar Field. By night, he governs within the Six Harmonies, to the right of the Great One.

Each evening, after completing the visualization, recite the incantation:
"Mysterious Origin congeals essence, Void unites with mist,
The knot of the womb-chamber, the intimacy of yin and yang,
The Three Supreme Qi descend into my body,
A hundred joints receive numen, ten thousand spirits each arrayed,
Chaos merged as one, named the Peach Lord,
Formed as at first birth, radiant and soaring to Heaven,
Clad in five-colored robes, adorned with phoenix-patterned splendor,
Holding the divine talisman, uniting the Imperial Lord’s hun-soul,
Girded with tiger-script sash, crowned with red kerchief and cinnabar cap,
Seated on golden grove and jade couch, directly before the Gate of Life,
Mouth inhaling essence-qi, strengthening my bones and joints,
To the right, a divine maiden holds a vermilion banner,
To the left, a jade lad records the Imperial Lord’s words,
Yang qi moves leftward, chaos undivided,
Yin qi passes rightward, flowing through seven revolutions,
Descending to the lowest depths, ascending to the Muddy Pellet,
Ever roaming the Nine Palaces, entering and exiting the Dark Gate,
Refining hun and po between the Six Palaces,
Registering the ten thousand spirits, ascending with me as immortals."

The above is the method of the Three and Five merging to transform and engender the Five Spirits. These Five Spirits receive the great numen of the Five Qi and accord with the origin of the Mysterious Mandate. Above, they engender the Void; below, they congeal the singular body. The life-within-life of the body requires the Five Spirits for its arising and abiding.

Each evening, the practitioner should visualize and recite this. If unable to recite silently, one may follow the text by day—it need not be at midnight, but rather when the qi of life arises. The three hun-souls are born of the Five Spirits, and the Three Perfected emerge from the Five Numinous Ones; thus, this Way is called the Method of Merging the Three and Five.

Those who practice it attain long life without death. This Way is named "The Northern Inspection of the Luminous Hall, Traversing the Purple Palace, Engendering and Transforming the Three and Five to Audience at the Upper Primordial." Even those who have already attained immortality should practice it, for those who practice it abide in eternal life.

During visualization, one may sit or recline as desired. If sitting, it is best to face one’s natal direction. If unable to visualize all Five Spirits at once, one may first visualize two, then three, cycling through them, beginning with the Great One.

When concentrating in visualization, one should seek utmost purity and stillness in a secluded chamber or quiet room—if in the mountains or forests, where no human voices or defiled qi can be heard—before practicing. After completing the visualization of the Three and Five merging, close the eyes and inwardly gaze, knock the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva nine times. Then softly recite the incantation:

"Perfected of the Nine Origins, truly possessing Three Fields,
Cloud chambers and golden halls, within dwell the Five Numinous Ones,
Commanding awe and might, transforming the dark and hidden,
Encompassing the Mysterious Mirror, weaving through Heaven and Earth,
Three and Five revert and return, merging with the Grand Clarity,
Yang qi flows and moistens, transforming into the Nameless,
Ascending with me as immortals, reaching the Divine Court,
Sun and moon gaze upon each other, the Three Luminaries blend their forms,
Transcending the Eight Extremes,
Crowned with Heaven’s essence, turning left and glancing right,
Holding the Seven Stars, concealing the body in the Grand Tenuity,
Uniting with the Primordial Qi of the Origin."

After reciting the incantation, visualize the Five Spirits each seated in their palaces. The Five Spirits all exhale purple qi to coil around the body until the purple qi is dense and obscure, and inner and outer merge indistinguishably—hands and feet no longer visible—then cease.

Next, visualize the sun and moon emerging from the left and right cheeks, the sun on the left and the moon on the right, their two lights penetrating and illuminating, whereupon the purple qi suddenly disperses.

Then visualize the sun entering your mouth and consume it, savoring its sweetness, swallowing nine times before stopping. Next, visualize the moon entering your navel, below the Gate of Life, illuminating the chamber of yin.

Then visualize yourself grasping the handle of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, wearing them as you walk into the Purple Chamber of the Grand Tenuity Palace to meet the Imperial Lord. The Imperial Lord says: "You have attained divine transcendence, you have attained long years. I inscribe for you the Azure Jade Talisman, writing upon the Nine Heavens."

I bow twice and say: "I beseech to conceal and rest in the Grand Tenuity, merge radiance with the Great One, arrayed in attendance upon the Imperial Lord, circling the Numinous Chamber."

The Imperial Lord then summons the Great One, who appears before the Imperial Lord. I then enter the mouth of the Great One, merging form and radiance into one body with the Great One. After a long while, all is complete. This is called "Merging with the Grand Clarity, Transforming into the Nameless, Sun and Moon Gazing Upon Each Other, Grasping the Seven Stars, Sharing Form with the Great One, Concealing the Body in the Imperial Court."

After completing the visualization of the Five Spirits, the incantation, and the inward gaze, open the eyes and click the teeth five times. Press the third finger of the left hand to the philtrum seven times, and the second finger of the right hand to the space between the eyebrows nine times. This is the method of "Reining In the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine," sealing and controlling the gates of the hundred spirits, ensuring the hundred spirits secure the practitioner’s palaces, the Three Perfected solidify the practitioner’s singular body, the Five Spirits guard the practitioner’s talismanic mandate, and the Imperial Lord oversees the practitioner’s myriad chambers.

After completing the practice, recite:
"Three and Five revert, Heaven covers and Earth begins,
I possess the Five Talismans, ascending to the Imperial Son,
The Three Primordials abide long, within the encampment’s enclosure,
Five colors..."

The interconnection is complete, the primordial cycle of square and circle unfolds. Externally, it wards off the hundred misfortunes; internally, it restrains the hundred officials. The Three Perfected support me, the Five Spirits protect my person, commanding the stalwart and unyielding, ensuring I do not die.

When the incantation is finished, visualize the Great One seated within the Sixfold Harmony Palace, thus merging form and radiance with me. Then return the fingers of both hands to their original positions, cover the mouth with both hands, and softly recite:

"The Great One commands all spirits, holding fast the gates of yin and yang. They must not recklessly abandon their palaces but await their reckoning before the Imperial Lord—first in accord with the law of the Three Perfected, second in accord with the mandate of the Nine Heavens."

This is the culmination of the merging and transformation, the completion of all visualization and practice.

The Great One regularly descends to the Crimson Palace at noon on *jia-wu*, *bing-wu*, and *wu-wu* days, merging form with the Perfected One and the practitioner’s body. This is called the "Threefold Union of the Self," the *qi* of the Three Perfected, the Threefold Primal Transformation.

The Perfected One of the Crimson Palace resides in the Cinnabar Field of the heart, while the Central Perfected One dwells within the heart. The *Scripture of the Three Ones* records these matters in full.

Regularly at noon on these days, enter the chamber and visualize the Great One descending to the Crimson Palace. Suddenly, the Perfected One of the Crimson Palace merges form with the Great One. Next, visualize yourself entering the Crimson Palace and suddenly merging form with the Great One once more. Within the Crimson Palace, only the body of the Great One is perceived, its form and attire mirroring the practitioner’s own—only finer and more subtle, as if newly born.

When this is complete, visualize below the two nostrils: on the left, the sun; on the right, the moon. Within the sun is yellow essence and red *qi*; within the moon is red essence and yellow *qi*. The essence is the substance of the two luminaries; the colored *qi* is the mist of the sun and moon. The two *qi* rise in abundance, entering the Crimson Palace until it overflows. The two *qi* then ascend into the Cavern Chamber, filling it to abundance, before descending into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court is the Cinnabar Field Palace three inches below the navel.

Once the two *qi* are full, they enter and fill the Great Granary, permeating the stomach channel with their abundant brilliance. Visualize the Great One ascending to the center of the stomach channel, facing south to summon the Perfected One of the Yellow Court in the Lower Cinnabar Field. Clad in yellow robes and a yellow headscarf, the Perfected One sits with the Great One, partaking of the essence and *qi* with twenty-seven swallows.

After a long while, visualize the Perfected One of the Yellow Court reciting:

"The radiance of the sun and moon, the yellow and red essences,
Their round light merging *qi*, ascending in great brilliance,
The Three Primordials partake of the feast,
The Great One receives the numinous."

Then visualize the Great One and the Central Perfected One returning to the Crimson Palace, while the Perfected One of the Yellow Court descends to the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace. The Great One merges form with the practitioner and returns to the Sixfold Harmony Palace.

When this is complete, the practitioner recites:

"The Great One, Imperial Lord, commands the Three Primordials on high,
And for me commands and restrains the hundred spirits.
The hundred spirits, in proper order, remain within my body,
Never recklessly entering or exiting the Golden Gate or the Jade Barrier."

When the incantation is finished, visualize the sun and moon below the breasts, ascending from the two nostrils into the Cavern Chamber. Within the Cavern Chamber resides the Supreme Perfected One, the Celestial Emperor. The Celestial Emperor is the son of the Imperial Lord; the Imperial Lord governs the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate, while the Celestial Emperor governs the Mud Pill Palace three inches inward from the space between the eyebrows—the Upper Palace of the Cinnabar Field—or else governs the Cavern Chamber Palace two inches inward from the space between the eyebrows.

Visualize the Supreme Celestial Emperor, each hand holding the sun and moon—left hand holding the sun, right hand holding the moon. The Celestial Emperor first consumes the sun and moon, and the practitioner performs nineteen swallows. After nineteen swallows, the Celestial Emperor exhales *qi*, which descends upon the Sixfold Harmony Palace of the Great One. The palace is filled with purple mist, and the Great One inhales the purple mist, performing nineteen swallows before stopping. This is called the "Merging of the Three Ones and the Emperor," spreading the essence of the sun and moon, transforming the radiance of the Three Palaces and the myriad spirits—ensuring perpetual life.

The Supreme One of the Nine Palaces enters the Imperial Chamber, the *qi* of Three and Five merging. Its root is the One and Seven, transforming into form and appearance. It safeguards the Five Phases, their nodes intertwined—this is the talisman for dispelling demons, the scripture of the Imperial Lord. It is said: the Three Perfected ascend in mutual succession, while the Five Spirits, receiving the imperial soul, descend in division.

Regularly at midnight on *jia-zi* days, visualize within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Tenuity Palace a youth resembling a newborn infant, clad in vermilion robes. His name is *Gan Jingjing*, his courtesy name *Huiyuanzi*, standing directly before the Imperial Lord, holding a red jade tablet upon which are inscribed the practitioner’s five talismans and life register.

Next, visualize the Great One ascending from the Sixfold Harmony Palace to stand at the Imperial Lord’s left. The youth says:

"The talismans and register govern life; all spirits obey.
The records of *jia* and *yi* are inscribed in the imperial court.
I request the mandate of the Great One to determine the name of *jia*—*jia* being the practitioner’s name."

The Imperial Lord says:

"Great One, youth of a hundred transformations, entering the self,
Eradicating death and ascending to life, cycling without end,
The myriad Perfected within the form—with a single command, the hundred officials are restrained."

Thereupon, the practitioner’s body and the youth merge into the form of the Great One. After a long while, visualize the Great One returning to the Sixfold Harmony Palace. This is called "Merging the Youth and Infant in the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning, transforming the Great One amid the Three Perfected."

Thus, the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* states:

"The Lesser Youth of the Supreme Tenuity,
Ever before the Emperor,
His name is *Jingjing*,
His surname *Gan*.
Merging form with the Great One,
Clad in vermilion and cinnabar,
Holding the five talismans, life register, and jade tablet,
Commanded by the Imperial Lord to govern all spirits—
This is the meaning."

The *Highest Scripture for Dispelling Demons* also states:

"*Xin-zi Jingjing*,
Possessing spirit and majesty,
Merging the three forms,
The nine paths mutually propel.
Clad in vermilion and cinnabar,
Walking with measured steps,
Entering and exiting the Upper Primordial,
The inner steps of the Supreme Ultimate.
Those who know me live,
Those who visualize me do not decline.
People lack omens of mourning,
Relying on me to avert calamity.
If you wish to know my dwelling,
Secretly inquire of the Supreme Tenuity."

This is the transformation of the Womb Child into the Hun-soul of the Embryonic Great One. Those who know his name and appellation ensure that none among the myriad people of the world bear the omen of mourning. Constantly visualize him to avert misfortune and myriad disasters, and you shall attain long life without death.

On the day of performing this transformative union, all six Jia days are auspicious; there is no need to exclusively use the Jia-zi day. The Five Spirits of the Great One present the Five Talismans and Five Registers—this is the Dao of the Supreme Clarity Emperor Lord’s fusion and union, the secret to seeking long life and transcendence as a divine immortal.

The Peach Lord Talisman on the right is drawn with cinnabar on a white ground. The Five Thearchs’ Inner Treasure Talismans are the Dao of the Great One Emperor Lord’s fusion and transformation through union with the radiant essence. On your life-destiny day, inscribe the Five Talismans and store them together in a brocade pouch to carry on your person. Those who carry them attain long life without death.

Moreover, in the month of your life-destiny, on the day and hour corresponding to your life-destiny, enter your chamber and inscribe the Five Talismans. Face the king and swallow them at once. Upon completion, recite the incantation:

*"The Five Talismans of the Great One,
The spirit registers record life.
For a thousand years, ten thousand ages,
You shall share the same age as Heaven.
The Emperor Lord holds the register,
Commanding life-destiny without decline."*

If you wish to ingest this talisman multiple times, the most auspicious times are the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month, at the hour when primordial qi is born at midnight, or alternatively at midnight on the autumnal equinox.

To present the Five Registers and Five Talismans for fusion with the Emperor Lord, on your life-destiny day and month, as well as on the fifteenth and twenty-sixth days of the third month, at the hour when primordial qi is born at midnight, ensure your chamber is pure and undefiled before proceeding. You may sit or lie down as you wish. If sitting, clasp your hands and bring them to your eyes. "Bringing them to your eyes" means keeping them closed yet not fully shut. If lying down, close your eyes and inwardly visualize. Place both hands over your heart and visualize the Emperor Lord seated in the Purple Chamber Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. Envision the Youth of the Supreme Tenuity attending behind the Emperor Lord, the Elder of Primordial Completion of Grand Simplicity attending to his left, and the Elder of Imperial Completion of Grand Harmony attending to his right. Next, visualize the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace ascending into the Purple Chamber to stand before the Emperor Lord. This Heavenly Emperor is the supreme perfected one of the Three Ones, the son of the Emperor Lord, the precious spirit of the Cavern Chamber of the Mud-Pill Palace.

Further visualize the Emperor Lord commanding the Heavenly Emperor to summon the Five Spirits of the Six Harmonies Palace. These Five Spirits—the Great One, the Noble Son, White Prime, the Controller of Destinies, and the Peach Lord—are five in number. Each wears vermilion robes and a crimson headscarf, and each holds a white jade tablet. Upon each tablet rests a talisman, one inch in length and five fen in width, with a register five inches long and one inch wide placed above it. Each has distinct duties and domains, with the register scrolls positioned above the talismans. Visualize the registers bearing your native place, name, and appellation, as described above. The Five Spirits each present their registers to the Heavenly Emperor, who in turn arranges them before the Emperor Lord.

Upon completion, visualize the Emperor Lord commanding the Heaven and Earth Emperors to summon your spirit, bidding it ascend to the Purple Chamber. In an instant, your spirit enters through your left nostril, ascends to the Purple Chamber, and arrives before the Emperor Lord. The Emperor Lord instructs your spirit to take the tablets in order and read the registers. After reading, your spirit presents them to the Heavenly Emperor, who then offers them to the Emperor Lord. The Emperor Lord commands your spirit to ingest the Five Talismans in sequence.

The Emperor Lord then instructs the Heavenly Emperor to summon the Perfected of the Crimson Palace of the Central Cinnabar Field and the Perfected of the Life Gate of the Lower Primordial, bidding them come to the Purple Chamber. In an instant, the two Perfected ascend to the Purple Chamber before the Emperor Lord. These two Perfected are the Three Ones of the Central Palace, the spirits of the heart and the navel below.

Next, visualize the Heavenly Emperor suddenly merging with the Emperor Lord’s form, entering through your mouth and uniting with him. In an instant, the two Elders enter the Emperor Lord’s two nostrils. Then, perceive the two Perfected of the Crimson Palace and Life Gate entering the Emperor Lord’s mouth. In another instant, perceive the Five Spirits entering the Emperor Lord’s Six Harmonies through his left ear. Finally, visualize your own spirit and the Youth of the Supreme Tenuity entering the Emperor Lord’s Six Harmonies through his right ear.

When all is complete, the Emperor Lord sits alone in the Purple Chamber Palace of the Supreme Tenuity. All the summoned spirits have merged within his form, transformed and united before the Emperor Lord. Then visualize the Emperor Lord reciting the incantation:

*"Supreme Mystery and Profound Clarity,
Heaven and Earth share the same essence.
United with the radiant essence in the Purple Chamber,
Fusion transforms the myriad lives.
The Five Spirits and Three Ones,
The Two Elders record names.
The Youth of the Supreme Tenuity,
Returns to form with your spirit.
For thousands upon thousands of myriads,
You shall enjoy long years of peace.
Preserve me as your sovereign,
And ascend as an immortal to Jade Clarity."*

Upon completion, you recite the incantation:

*"The fusion is complete,
The register of death is obliterated.
The Heavenly Emperor commands,
Never forget nor lose this.
The Hundred Spirits and Emperor Lord,
Each treasure their abode."*

Then open your eyes and conclude. This is the method for the Five Spirits presenting the talismans and registers, the Dao of the fusion of hun-soul and spirit. Focus your essence and mind to visualize it.

The Life-Guarantee for the Fusion of the Five Registers and Five Talismans: On your life-destiny day at noon, inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper, creating one copy. At midnight, enter your chamber, complete the visualization, and ingest one copy while facing your life-destiny direction. Take the remaining copy and cut it in half with scissors, dividing it at the black-stained center. Place one half in the stove fire and the other in the well water. Perform this ritual on every life-destiny day; it is called the Talisman for Preserving the Spirit and Prolonging Life, the Emperor Lord’s Record of Command.

Inscribe it with a blue-green brush on white paper. On your life-destiny day at dawn, face east and ingest it, then recite the incantation:

*"The Emperor Lord issues the command,
The nine qi merge as one smoke.
He causes me not to die,
And further to ascend as a flying immortal.
The command stabilizes my form,
I become a guest of the Supreme."*

Inscribe it with realgar on white paper. On your life-destiny day at noon, face south and ingest it, then face south and recite the incantation:

*"The Great One is luminous and numinous,
The Emperor Lord unites with my form.
Sever the Three Corpses,
Hun and po are at peace.
Abide forever in Heaven,
The nine destinies remain unshaken.
Ascend before the Emperor,
The seven paths and five lives."*

Inscribe it with a cinnabar brush on white paper. On your life-destiny day at dusk, face your life-destiny direction and ingest it. After ingesting, recite the incantation:

*"Heaven dark, earth yellow,
The three hun dwell in the hall.
Heaven yellow, earth dark,
The three hun reside in man.
Neither yellow nor dark,
The Emperor Lord records the years.
Neither dark nor yellow,
The Great One does not forget.
He stabilizes my form,
Boundless longevity without end."*

This is the Great One’s Precious Command Talisman for Governing the Three Hun and Seven Po. Always on the month, day, and hour of your life-destiny, inscribe it in cinnabar on white paper and ingest it facing north. If you do not know your birth month, day, or hour, even knowing one will suffice; you may also ingest it on the wu-wu day at noon.

This is the Supreme Precious Talisman for Summoning the Emperor Lord. On the eight solar terms at noon, inscribe it in cinnabar on white paper, ingest it, and recite the incantation:

*"The Supreme Three Mysteries,
The Emperor Lord resides in the hun.
The Great One and Five Numinous Powers,
Protect the hun and stabilize the body.
The Purple Chamber holds command,
Issuing decrees to govern the hundred spirits."*

The Emperor Lord’s Inner Spirit Talisman of the Great One comprises twelve sections, all being the primordial qi of the Supreme Original Essence. It is most true and most secret—do not transmit it recklessly. There are also separate talismans of the Great One’s outer oral instructions, which differ greatly, being the superior talismans of the *Zhong Jin Di Chang Jing*. Those that are not authentic will be ineffective; you must be reverent and cautious.

The Emperor Lord’s taboo name is Feng Lingfan, his courtesy name Lü Changling. He is also called Seven Numinous Powers and Divine Elder. He constantly resides in the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate, sitting upright and proper, his appearance like that of an infant. A purple qi perpetually envelops his divine form. He wears a robe of five-colored radiance and a cap adorned with the sun and moon. Above his left ear is the sun, nine inches in diameter; above his right ear is the moon, one foot in diameter. This is the true form of the Emperor Lord at all times, not a transformation.

The Emperor Lord constantly recites a text that says:

*"Subtle and profound,
The Dark Prime is empty and complete.
The eight winds scatter light,
Transforming in the hidden abyss.
Silent and boundless,
Luminous and abiding in the mysterious.
The seven spirits wander,
Refining and softening the three hun.
The Supreme Lord is at peace,
Bestowing grace upon your body.
Your body must always be pure,
Cautious in treading the flying dust.
Then I shall be joyful,
Preserving this muddy pellet.
If blood-corpses enter the eyes,
Defiled qi swirls in profusion.
The Emperor and the Great One,
Together command the five spirits.
Abandon office and forsake dwelling,
Ascend directly to the Nine Heavens.
If you resist,
The three destinies will topple.
How much better to be still and tranquil,
Entwined with me in serenity."*

This is the Emperor Lord’s constant recitation of the Supreme’s divine chapter of the Empty Chamber. You should always study and recite it. Its urgency lies in impurity and filth—what I call the obscure.

If you know the Emperor Lord’s name and courtesy name, beware—you must not be careless. If you have transgressions and wish to confess, seek absolution, and have your sins removed, enter your chamber at midnight or noon, close your eyes, sit upright, and face north. Visualize the Emperor Lord in your Purple Chamber, meditating as described above. Then visualize your own body within the Purple Chamber, prostrating before the Emperor Lord. Internally confess your transgressions, holding your breath for a long while until your entire body is drenched in sweat, your clothes damp and steaming. Do this three times, and your sins will dissolve like scattered dust. Once your whole body is bathed in sweat, recite the incantation:

*"So-and-so has sinned,
Heard by the hundred spirits.
I beseech deliverance from the seven nines,
From the perils of water and fire.
The Guardian of Destiny, the Great One,
The Emperor Lord who restrains and saves,
Sweat flows through my entire body,
Terror grips the three hun.
I implore the Supreme,
To forever remove these perils."*

After reciting, call out the Emperor Lord’s name and courtesy name three times. Then open your eyes. This is called the Emperor Lord’s Method for Relieving Transgressions, an inner confession to the five spirits, with sweating as the sign of efficacy. When worldly people confess their faults, they kowtow and slap their cheeks—this is an external method. If you practice this method, or cultivate the Three Ones to guard the Grotto Chamber, with the Emperor Lord serving the Great One, be careful never to kowtow or slap your cheeks. Kowtowing startles the three hun, disturbs the muddy pellet, grieves the Purple Chamber, and topples the Emperor Lord. Slapping the cheeks hardens the womb and binds the sinews of the po, saddens the Great One, and disorients the five spirits—this is a great taboo. Whatever you do or think, if you mentally kowtow or slap your cheeks, it is inwardly resolved in the heart. Immortals bow in their hearts but do not physically prostrate—what I call the obscure.

If you know the Emperor Lord’s name and courtesy name, you will attain long life and immortality, and your body will not enter the earth. Be careful not to reveal them to others; if you do, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Guardian Scriptures will depart. This is not to be transmitted without a covenant.

Always on the geng-shen day at noon, or at midnight, enter your chamber and visualize the Emperor Lord in the Purple Chamber. The Emperor Lord exhales a qi, and with each breath, a person is formed—seven breaths create seven people. Then visualize the Great One coming from the Central Palace of the Six Harmonies to stand before the Emperor Lord. Visualize yourself merging with the Great One, becoming one body. The seven breaths create seven people, and the Great One and the Emperor Lord make two more, totaling nine people. These are the Seven Lords and Nine Lords, who govern the pathways of blood, vessels, sinews, and bones.

Visualize the Emperor Lord issuing the command and reciting the incantation:

*"The First White Qi Lord, Wu Xuanzhi,
The Second Azure Qi Lord, An Yanchang,
The Third Black Qi Lord, Fu Laisheng,
The Fourth Yellow Qi Lord, Zu Mingche,
The Fifth Red Qi Lord, Kun Lizhi—
All wear robes of the five directions’ colors,
And caps of the five directions.
They follow in order,
No confusion permitted.
The Sixth Upper Mystery Lord, Gao Tongsheng,
The Seventh Lower Mystery Lord, Shu Huowang—
Each wears a vermilion robe and yellow cap,
Standing behind me,
Holding charts and registers,
Presenting the five talismans."*

Now command:
The First Lord governs qi,
The Second Lord governs blood,
The Third Lord governs essence,
The Fourth Lord governs fluids,
The Fifth Lord governs spirit,
The Sixth Lord governs the hun,
The Seventh Lord governs the po,
The Great One Lord governs marrow and brain,
The Emperor Lord governs the life-destiny.

In orderly succession they compare merits,
Record achievements and erase transgressions,
Strike out names of the dead,
And inscribe in azure script—
As decreed by the Heavenly Sovereign’s inner command.

Thereupon, the Emperor Lord completes the incantation.
Then, from his mouth he exhales white qi thirty times,
Filling the Purple Chamber,
Pervading his entire body with its deep fragrance.
His whole being merges in darkness,
As if enveloped in clouds and mist.
After a long while, he suddenly opens his eyes and ceases.

This is called the Seven Lords and Nine Lords examining and aligning the body,
Blending with white qi,
To firmly secure the Way of the Mud-Pill Palace.
It is also by this method that the illnesses of the Three Corpses and Seven Accumulations are dispelled.

Human life transforms from the womb,
And takes form through blood and essence.
Yet once born, the womb re-forms knots,
And once formed, blood and fluids cease to remain.
That which does not remain—the Emperor Lord’s blending holds it fast.

The womb has twelve knotted nodes,
Coiling and binding the five viscera.
When the five viscera stagnate and obstruct,
The knots cannot be untied,
Nor the nodes removed.
Thus, illness arises from stagnant nodes,
And death from fixed knots.

On one’s life-destiny day or the eight seasonal nodes,
One should supplicate the Emperor Lord and the Great One to blend,
Commanding the hundred spirits
To dissolve the womb’s stubborn knots,
The dead nodes of its coiled roots.

The womb has twelve knots,
Within which lie twelve nodes—
Nodes concealed within knots.
Those who do not know how to untie these knots and nodes
Cannot escape death,
While those who regularly dissolve them attain longevity.

The womb’s upper knots:
One in the Mud-Pill Palace,
Two in the mouth,
Three in the cheeks,
Four in the eyes—
These four knots reside in the upper region.

The womb’s middle knots:
One in the five viscera,
Two in the Great Granary,
Three in the large intestine,
Four in the small intestine—
These four knots reside in the middle region.

The womb’s lower knots:
One in the bladder,
Two in the yin,
Three in the posterior gate,
Four in the two feet—
These four knots reside in the lower region.

The method for dissolving knots:
Enter a chamber, close the door, and visualize.
First recite the names of the Emperor Lord and the hundred spirits below him.
After repeating them twice,
Proceed in order to dissolve the knots.

This is the Way of the Emperor Lord and the Great One blending with the twenty-four spirits,
Dissolving knots and expelling the qi of the Corpse.

On one’s life-destiny day or the eight seasonal nodes,
At noon or midnight,
Sit upright facing the direction of one’s life-destiny day.
Join hands, compose the mind,
And knock the teeth twenty-four times.
Recite the incantation:

*"Male-born [Name], humbly invokes the Womb Father and Womb Mother,
On the day of my birth, three accumulations of lingering blood
Transformed into twelve great knots.
Today, on my life-destiny day,
I reverently summon the Three Origin Spirits and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones
To dissolve the Three Passes and Twelve Knots.
I now invoke their names:
The Azure Emperor of the East, Diao Liangji,
Whose style is Qingping;"*

Southward, the Crimson Emperor Changlaijue, styled Nanhe;
Westward, the White Emperor Zhang’anxing, styled Xihua;
Northward, the Black Emperor Baoshengchang, styled Beifa.

The Mysterious One, Old Master Lin Xufu, styled Lingshidao.
The Three Primes, Old Master Lao Zhangshang, styled Shenshengdao.
The Orthodox Unity Left Immortal, Zhong Chengzi, also named Dibin, styled Sihua.
The Orthodox Unity Right Immortal, Qu Wenzi, also named Guangjian, styled Linghe.

The Minor Lad of the Grand Tenuity, Gan Jingjing, styled Huiyuanzǐ, also named Sanjinjiao or Duidi Zhen.
The Inner Womb Perfected Ones, numbering nine, externally harmonize with the nine qi—these are the Nine Lords. For dissolving the knots above *jia*, the knots at the Upper Pass: when the four knots disperse, the fluid and blood flow at their source, the Upper Register of Longevity is lengthened, and one becomes an immortal of the Heavenly Emperor forever.

The Venerable Spirit of the Great One, Wu Youshou, styled Guihuichang, also named Jieming or Jipin.
The Left Non-Being Duke’s Son, Xuan Yuan Shu, styled Hefuzi, also named Yuansu Jun or Shen Gongzi.
The Right White Prime Cavern Yang Lord, Yu Lingbiao, styled Xuan Yijue, also named Zhu Jing or Qicheng.
The Central Controller of Destiny, the Venerable Lord Li Mingchu, styled Xuandu Qing, also named Shenzong or Linghua.

The Peach Lord of the Gate of Destiny, Hai Daokang, styled Hejingyan, also named Mingwang or Baogen.
The Celestial Emperor of the Mud-Pill Palace, Shangyi Chizi, Xuan Ning Tian, styled Sanyuan Xian, also named Bowushang or Boshi Hua.
The Celestial Minister of the Mud-Pill Palace, Zhao Le Jing, styled Zhong Xuan Sheng, also named Qifei or Changfu.
The Cinnabar Palace of the Heart and Cinnabar Field, the Central One Cinnabar Sovereign Lord, Shen Yun Zhu, styled Zinan Dan, also named Shengshang Bo or Shiyun Ju.

The Auxiliary Sovereign of the Cinnabar Palace, Zhong Guangjian, styled Sihua Ling, also named Youche Bo or Dongshi Hua.
The Nine Perfected of the Central Womb—these are the Nine Lords. The nine qi of numinous return transform and enter the Cinnabar Palace, dissolving the great knots of the five viscera. The large and small intestines shall all disperse; the four knots divide and flourish. The Central Pass is harmonized and regulated, flowing into the Great Granary. A thousand disasters and ten thousand calamities vanish in an instant. Inscribed in the Upper Register of Life, one remains forever free from misfortune.

The Primordial King of the Yellow Court below the Gate of Destiny, Shi Ming Jing, styled Yuan Yang Chang, also named Ying’er Tai or Boshi Yuan.
The Guardian and Protector of the Yellow Court, Gui Shang Ming, styled Guxia Xuan, also named Chengshen Bo or Chengguang Sheng.

The First Womb’s White Qi Lord, Wu Xuanzi, styled Yuchang Sheng.
The Second Knot’s Azure Qi Lord, An Yanchang, styled Hehe Ying.
The Third Node’s Black Qi Lord, Bin Laisheng, styled Jingshang Men.
The Fourth Womb’s Yellow Qi Lord, Zu Mingche, styled Shen Wuji.
The Fifth Blood’s Crimson Qi Lord, Hun Lizi, styled Shu Huojian.
The Sixth Upper Mysterious Primordial Father Lord, Gao Tongsheng, styled Zuo Huiming.
The Seventh Lower Mysterious Primordial Mother Lord, Shu Huowang, styled You Huiguang.

The Nine Lords of the Lower Womb, the Inner Womb Perfected Ones, generate and transform the nine qi—these are the Nine Po. When the nine po are firm in the nodes of the essence-womb, they cause one to die in middle age. Today, reverently following the command, as at the time of first birth, I beseech the dissolution of the twelve roots of death. May my name be inscribed in the Jade Register, the Five Talismans enter my body, and the nine qi be settled below, eternally entwined. Above, the Nine Palaces open; below, the Nine Passes open.

After reciting the incantation twice more, conclude the rite. Harmonize the qi below the heart, ensuring the voice is neither choked nor faltering.

Then close the eyes and visualize the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate, the Celestial Emperor of the Heavenly Vastness, Feng Lingfan, styled Lüchang Ling, also named Qiling or Shen Zhangren. Recite this incantation three times.

Next, visualize the Twenty-Seven Perfected Lords of the Dissolved Three-Nine Knots: the Azure Emperor of the East, Diao Liangji, and the others through the Primordial Mother, Shu Huowang, all clad in vermilion robes and yellow kerchiefs. The yellow kerchief resembles the shape of a *yuanyou* cap. Their faces are like those of infants, neither tall nor short.

Then lead the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate to face north, toward the Celestial Emperor, and all kneel in prostration. They say:

The Nine Lords of the Upper Pass, led by Diao Liangji, the Nine Lords of the Middle Pass including Taiyi Wuyoushou, and the Nine Lords of the Lower Pass beginning with Xiayi Huangting Shimingjing—these Twenty-Seven Lords of the Three Nines—on this day, with the internal swallowing of primordial qi, open the Three Passes above. Each Pass contains twenty-four knots, and each knot binds twenty-four sinews. Once the sinews are severed, the knots dissolve and scatter. The essence-blood surges upward, filling the Mud Pill Palace, while the Jade Nectar flows downward to nourish the hundred spirits. On this day, the name of so-and-so is inscribed in the Heavenly Register as a Perfected Immortal of Longevity.

When this is complete, visualize the name of Taiyi ascending before the Celestial Emperor. The Emperor says: "The fetal knots are now unblocked, your inner radiance shines through to the exterior. I grant you longevity, and your destiny shall not collapse. You may now merge with my form." The Celestial Emperor then opens his mouth, and I suddenly enter it, arriving directly at the Sixfold Palace within the Emperor. Within the Emperor’s Sixfold Palace resides another Taiyi spirit, named Chongmingkong, styled Youliaowu. He addresses me, saying: "You may now consume the essence of the sun." I then take the solar essence and swallow it nine times.

Presently, the Twenty-Seven Perfected Lords appear, standing to my left and right. They say: "So-and-so’s fetal register is now dissolved, all impure qi is expelled. Your countenance shines like jade, your body permeates the Great Void. You shall live for millions of years, in harmony with the Celestial Emperor." Then visualize the Celestial Emperor’s incantation: "In heaven, united with the Perfected—this is my body. In heaven, united with the Numinous—this is my form." After a long while, all is complete.

This is the Nine Lords’ fusion and internal transformation of the hundred spirits, the dissolution of the fetal knots, the untying of the Three Passes, the ascent to merge with the Sixfold Palace, and the union with the Radiant Celestial Emperor to alter one’s destiny in the register. The qi stabilizes in the Mud Pill Palace, and one receives the talisman of longevity, becoming a Heavenly Immortal.

Once the visualization is complete, loosen the hair, comb it again, untie and retie the garments, and wash the hands and feet. If one cannot silently recite or visualize even one or two parts, one may enter the chamber and perform the ritual according to the text.

Within the Celestial Emperor’s Mud Pill Palace is another Sixfold Palace, wherein resides the Celestial Sovereign Taiyi, named Chongmingkong, styled Youliaowu. Those who know this will regenerate from withered bones, their five viscera blossom, and they shall never know fear. In times of fear, face north and call this name three times, reciting the incantation: "Luo A Chongmingkong Leifeng, Youliaowu Shangsheng Dijun, protect my form and free me from sorrow." When this is done, it is as if one travels with a thousand companions.

The Taiyi Celestial Emperor unties the Three Passes and the twelve fetal knots of the internal talisman. On one’s natal day or during the Eight Seasonal Festivals, when performing the knot-untying ritual, first swallow this talisman three times, facing the direction of one’s natal constellation. The talisman is inscribed with cinnabar on the white membrane within green bamboo. This membrane grows within the hard nodes, hollow within yet receptive to the numinous—thus, the bamboo membrane is used to write the knot-untying talisman.

Taiyi says: "Humans possess three hun-souls, which benefit one’s preservation. Humans also possess seven po-souls, which harm one’s destiny. The seven po-souls dwell beneath the left eye by day and beneath the nose’s philtrum by night. Those who cultivate the Dao should, before lying down, press the right fingernail to the left eye’s underside and the philtrum, each thirty-seven times—this is excellent for restraining the seven po-souls."

The *Taiyi Baoxuan Yujing* of the Celestial Emperor is concealed by the Supreme Perfected within the Flowery Chambers of the Five Peaks. Those without immortal registers may not hear or see it. Those who see it shall live; those who practice it shall become immortals. Therefore, solemn oaths are repeatedly sworn to summon celestial perfected beings, preventing disclosure and unauthorized dissemination.

Since the Heavenly Worthy reveres the immortals, this Dao is kept profoundly secret. It is not casually transmitted to those without immortal bones, nor heard by those lacking utmost sincerity. The scripture says: "The master, by virtue of the scripture’s teachings, is called the living recipient." The disciple studies to align in sincerity, swearing oaths to heaven, solidifying the divine pledge, intertwining joys and sorrows, and equating the bond with life and death. Only then can one be tested and ultimately ascend together to the immortal courts.

Thus, one offers reverence and receives the teaching, performing the oath in a secluded chamber. Superior and inferior observe the Three Purities, distinguishing the earnestness of their devotion. The precious scripture is concealed, its essential words practiced with care. Sincerity is maintained with single-minded focus, honoring the master and scripture. Not a moment of negligence is permitted—only then may one speak of communion with the divine and the covenant of the Dao.

Those who receive the scripture and keep its Dao secret, who conduct affairs in accordance with their oaths, shall have their names inscribed on jade tablets and their imperial records written in the Supreme Ultimate. Should one violate the Dao, however, one’s seven ancestors shall suffer the trials of the Wind Blade, the Mysterious Mother shall endure harm to her fetal spirit, the body shall become a lowly ghost, and the family shall vanish like smoke. Mountains of stones shall be cast into the River of Accumulated Nights—how lamentable! Those with hearts must guard this secret most carefully.

This is the *Contract and Ordinance of the Supreme Perfected*, expounded by Celestial Master Zhang in the *Danjing*. It contains these solemn oaths. Those who receive the Dao of the Supreme Celestial Emperor conduct affairs thus, and so it is recorded for cultivation.

Three gold rings shall seal the oaths of the Three Origins. Twenty-seven feet of azure silk serve as the ceremonial cloth. These bind the oaths of the Twenty-Four Divine Envoys of the Celestial Emperor. Five ounces of crimson thread shall seal the oaths of the Five Divine Lords. Two packets of blended incense shall produce the smoke that conveys qi in communion with the spirits. One brush, one *zhang* of paper, and one ounce of cinnabar shall inscribe the covenant.

These five items shall be placed in a vessel and kept from exposure. All who receive the scripture must prepare them. Once the disciple has copied the text, they shall bring both the scripture and the items to the master’s chamber to receive the transmission. Only after the transmission is complete may they put the teachings into practice.

Those who secretly practice without taking the oath shall, according to the *Nüqing Ordinance*, forfeit both luminaries. Those who receive but do not practice shall face the trial of celestial fire. Those who practice but do so carelessly or reveal secrets shall suffer the Wind Blade’s judgment. Those who transmit to the unworthy shall bring seven generations of their ancestors under scrutiny.

Such are the principles of the *Xuandu Demon Statutes* and the *Nüqing Ordinance*. Here ends the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Vermilion Hidden Writ of the Cavernous Truth*, revealed by the Supreme Unity Celestial Emperor of the Cavernous Truth.
