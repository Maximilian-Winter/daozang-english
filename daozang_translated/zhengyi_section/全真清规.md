**The Complete Perfection Monastic Regulations**
Compiled by Lu Daohe, the Master Tongxuan of Chun’an in Yaojiang

**Guidelines for Novices**
When a novice first leaves the secular world, they must seek a enlightened teacher and formally submit to their guidance. Once ordained, they must obey their master’s instructions to mature into a true practitioner.

When a master accepts a disciple, they first assess the depth of the novice’s innate goodness and wisdom, observe the moral character of their family lineage, and evaluate the disciple’s own talents. Only then may they be accepted.

First, the novice must shed worldly attachments, change their attire, and cultivate the demeanor of an immortal, embodying the Daoist spirit. Through instruction and discipline, they will eventually attain distinction.

As the Most High said: *"To constantly embody the model is called mysterious virtue, for one becomes the standard for all under Heaven."*

A *model* is the law, the rule, the pattern, the plumb line for the world. Such standards have existed since antiquity, while monastic halls have arisen in recent times.

An enlightened master, when accepting and instructing disciples, begins with concrete practices before guiding them toward the formless. Disciples from noble lineages who diligently cultivate these teachings will attain realization.

Yet if a deluded master, lacking understanding, instructs disciples in the formless from the outset, both teacher and student will remain ignorant, sinking deeper into confusion. Though they rely on the teachings in life, in death they will fall into the icy abyss, repaying their karmic debts through endless rebirth.

Those of sincere aspiration should seek an enlightened master, paying morning and evening respects, listening and obeying, studying scriptures, and upholding the monastic regulations.

From dawn till dusk, they burn incense, light lamps, offer thanks to Heaven and Earth, and pay homage to the sages and immortals while serving their master with reverence. Once these duties are complete, they collect their thoughts, sit upright in stillness, free from distracting thoughts, straighten their spine, place the right foot beneath the left, clasp their hands in silence, turn their mind inward, and close their eyes in meditation—whether for one or two watches of the night—as their daily practice.

When the fifth watch approaches but the morning bell has not yet sounded, they must rise early, wash their face, comb their hair, dress, and attend to the assembly. As the first bell rings in the hall, the novices enter and line up inside. At the second bell, the senior monks enter and line up outside. When the third bell ceases, the officiant enters and stands at the center.

After the recitation of scriptures, the novices exit first. During processions and scripture recitations, novices lead, and this order is observed in all halls. Once the recitation concludes, the officiant takes their seat, and the novices bow deeply, calling for a full bow from the assembly. All sit, tea is served, and once the cups are cleared, the assembly disperses.

The novices then enter their master’s chamber, prostrate, and bow, awaiting instructions—whether to study scriptures or sweep the floor, each task assigned accordingly.

When encountering elders, they clasp their hands over their heart, stand to the side with a slight bow, and remain attentive until the elder passes before turning away. When guests arrive, they must first bow, announce their presence to the elders, and prepare tea. They first greet the host, then the guest, standing with clasped hands. They first clear the guest’s cup, then the host’s. If the guest rises, they open the door and roll up the curtain, following the host and guest out.

When accompanying their master, they must not sit beside them but stand with clasped hands. In all comings and goings, they bow to their peers. When receiving anything, they bow in gratitude. They must not be self-righteous, nor speak recklessly, but dispel distracting thoughts, cultivate kindness, contemplate the Dao, and aspire to truth.

They walk with measured steps and speak in a low voice. They aid those in distress, welcome travelers, maintain a broad and compassionate heart, act with gentleness and love, benefit others, accumulate merit through virtuous deeds, and uphold these practices—thus the Dao is not far.

**Order of Ordination**
When renouncing the secular world and receiving the Daoist topknot and robe, the ordination implements are placed upon the altar of the Patriarch. The assembly sits in a circle, bidding farewell to worldly kin, and changing into their new attire, shoes, and socks.

Kneeling before the Patriarch, the ordaining master combs their hair and bestows the topknot and robe. The assembly enters the hall, begins the scripture recitation, and leads the prayers of blessing. Standing before the incense table, the officiant reads the proclamation, bows three times to offer incense, then retreats to perform six bows. After the prayers conclude, they enter the Hall of True Officials to recite scriptures, bowing before the Patriarch in the same manner.

Once the recitation ends, the assembly sits again, and incense and candles are arranged properly. Before their master, the ordaining master leads the initiate forward to kneel, bow three times to receive the incense, then bow again to approach. The master hands them the proclamation, which they kneel to read aloud, then receive the transmission of the Dao from their master.

They bow three more times, prostrate, then carry the incense and candle table to each elder in turn, offering incense as before. After the rites conclude, they enter the refectory, bow three times before the Patriarch’s altar, and the assembly bows six times on either side to encourage the meal. After the meal, they rise to see off the guests, then return to express gratitude in the kitchen.

In daily conduct, they should act with flexibility, endure hardship for others’ benefit, subdue the mind and extinguish distracting thoughts, respect their master and serve their peers, avoid worldly attachments, constantly examine their faults, focus on cultivating their nature, seek guidance from elders, and strictly uphold the monastic regulations.

**Etiquette for Traveling and Seeking Masters**
When traveling to various regions, one must not only seek virtuous masters but also ensure their ordination implements are properly arranged.

Upon first arriving at the monastery, one should look for the characters "息肩" (Resting Shoulders) or "驻鹤" (Perching Crane) on the western corridor and rest there. If intending to stay long-term, the carrying pole is laid flat; if merely passing through, the ends may be uneven. Leaning against the wall, one takes the outer robe and drapes it over the left arm. If the head monastic receptionist emerges from the main hall, one dons the outer robe and exchanges bows as host and guest. If asked about one’s origins, one replies: "From such-and-such abbey in such-and-such prefecture, under Master So-and-so, of the such-and-such surname." The response should be: "From such-and-such place, such-and-such prefecture, of the such-and-such surname." Once the exchange concludes, one is invited inside. If staying only for the day, all belongings except bedding are packed away. After spreading the mat and arranging the bowl, one washes the feet and changes clothes. One then meets the receptionist again, bowing and saying: "Today, I humbly wish the Venerable Receptionist great fortune in health and well-being. Having long heard of your secluded transcendence, I have come especially to pay my respects. I am deeply grateful for your kindness in receiving me, providing a mat, and setting out my bowl." With a bow, one proceeds to meet the monastery’s director, offering salutations: "Today, I humbly wish the Esteemed Director, the Perfected One, abundant purity and blessings. Having long heard of the vastness of your Dao-inspired virtue, I have come to gaze upon your honored presence. I am profoundly grateful for your kindness in receiving me, providing a mat, and setting out my bowl." With a bow, after tea is served, one rises to express thanks: "Just now, I lightly intruded upon your quarters. I am deeply moved by your gracious hospitality in preparing tea, and my heart is filled with boundless gratitude." With a bow, the formalities conclude, and one returns to one’s mat. The director responds: "The monastery is honored by your crane-like presence. We regret not having welcomed you properly." Then, rising to urge one to stay, the director says: "The monastery is quiet, and our hall and kitchen are humble. We dare hope that the noble one will linger like a crane, uplifting the monastery’s Dao-inspired virtue. Our longing and admiration are beyond words." With a bow, the rules of the monastic hall and the seniority of ordination are observed.

Upon receiving new members, one must first observe them for three days. Only then may they be invited into the storehouse hall to verify their credentials, confirming where and when they took their master and received the Dao. Their details are recorded in the blue register. Afterward, they are assigned a sleeping mat. Consulting the blue register, their names are arranged by seniority, and each is shown their designated place. Thus, one knows oneself and others, and observes the precepts and ordination seniority. In all matters—whether entering the hall, ascending the platform, walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—one must yield to those of higher rank or greater seniority, respecting the order of precepts and ordination. Follow the monastery’s hierarchy while upholding the proper deference of the religious life.

**Rules for Sitting the Alms-Bowl**
The practice of sitting the alms-bowl begins on the first day of the tenth month, gathering the assembly. It continues past the Winter Solstice until the middle of the first lunar month of the new year, lasting one hundred days as the standard. Those who enter the hall do so of their own volition. Each comes solely for their own sake, for the great matter of life and death is urgent, and impermanence arrives swiftly. They examine and refine one another, inquiring of the master’s virtue and adhering to the rules. During the alms-bowl session, there is movement and stillness: when moving, one may proceed slowly; when still, one must remain so. If someone grows drowsy, nodding or swaying, the bowl monitor first patrols with the warning tablet, placing it on the offender’s shoulder. After three strikes, it is removed, and the offender rises gently to continue patrolling, replacing the next violator. If, before the session ends, the bell has not sounded, the stillness tablet remains unchanged, and one leaves or enters without cause, speaks, or disturbs the order, they shall be disciplined.

1. For those who violate the above rules, the assistant bowl monitor shall report the matter, and the bowl monitor shall administer discipline. First offense: reprimand before the hall. Second offense: tea penalty. Third offense: expulsion from the hall. Severe violations shall be addressed according to the monastery’s regulations and ancestral precedents.

2. The twelve alms-bowl sessions day and night correspond to the twelve hours. The three stillnesses and nine movements align with the Three Origins and Nine Qi, also known as the three returns and nine cycles.

3. Each day at the fifth watch, the *yin* hour, upon hearing the board signaling the end of stillness, all wash and rinse, pay homage to the immortals, and venerate the sages. At the *mao* hour, morning gruel is taken. At the *chen* hour, mixed sitting. At the *si* hour, the stillness bell rings three times, and all sit in meditation, cultivating practice as prescribed. At the *wu* hour, one attends the meal. At the *wei* hour, mixed sitting. At the *shen* hour, as before, one enters stillness. At the *you* hour, evening audience. At the *xu* hour, mixed sitting with tea. At the *hai* hour, as before, one enters stillness, cultivating practice as prescribed. At the *zi* hour, singing and reciting poetry to resist the demon of sleep. The bowl monitor leads, repeating each piece three times—no more. At the *chou* hour, the session ends, and all may act as they please. The assistant bowl monitor must remain vigilant, ensuring no one lingers too long. Each must cultivate a sincere and respectful heart.

**The Three Unmovings**
In the great assembly of the monastery, there are always guest managers and duty monks to respond to exchanges, welcome guests, and see them off. The assembly must not stir, lest they disrupt the hall’s order.

1. **Unmoving in Meditation**
   Clarify the celestial mind, regulate the breath to harmonize primordial qi, investigate the original nature, and silently activate the mysterious mechanism. The body, like the great void, remains unshaken and unmoved. Let others come and go; each cultivates a sincere heart and sits in meditation as prescribed.

2. **Unmoving in Recitation**
   Each directs their mind, maintaining solemn dignity. Regulate the voice and qi, focus the thoughts, and comprehend the meaning. Listen with the ears, observe with the eyes, harmonize the sounds, and follow one another. Let others come and go; each returns to devotion and recites the scriptures as prescribed.

3. **Unmoving at Meals**
   Contemplate the Dao and reflect on the true. The mind is clear, the intent serene. Spirit settled, qi harmonized, one silently receives the offering. Unfold the alms-bowl without sound, ascend the hall without speech. Let others be long or short; each cultivates reverence and sits at meals as prescribed.

**The Substance and Function of the Complete Truth**
The ancestral masters established the teachings, and the immortals and sages delivered sentient beings, opening the gateway to the Great Vehicle and the essential ford of myriad wonders. They guided beings to return to the origin and comprehend principle, awakening the deluded mind to preserve the true. Value loyalty in clarity and stillness, and strive to perfect the nature in simplicity and purity. Deeply understand the brevity of life, and attain the supreme joy of eternal spring. Thus, do not cling to profit or fame, nor entangle yourself in worldly affairs. Comprehend the great essence, and let the heart be as pure as gold and jade. Nurture the primordial mechanism, and let the aspiration be as steadfast as stone and as clear as ice. Aid others and benefit all things, harmonizing the one principle to achieve universal penetration. Refine the self and return to the origin, embodying myriad virtues in perfect balance. Whether one is a stubborn practitioner or a master of the round mechanism, there should be no discrimination, no contention, no pride, and no fault-finding. Dwell in the jade-like abode, and mingle in the cloud-like hall. Do not scrutinize others’ faults or shortcomings; instead, eliminate one’s own arrogance and obstinacy. The heart is free and at ease, adapting to circumstances with harmony. The capacity is vast and unobstructed, gentle and kind in all places. When attending meals morning and evening, one should fold the hands, cultivate a sincere heart, and sit in silence. When paying homage to the sages at dawn and dusk, one must raise the fists, walk slowly, and proceed with measured steps. Those who embody the higher way maintain solemn dignity; those who dwell in the lower stream act with reckless abandon. When secretly inquiring into the true mechanism and investigating the mysterious essentials, one must revere the master with utmost respect and sincerity, and inquire of the Dao with earnest devotion. Comprehend the myriad principles to return to the origin, and concentrate the one true to manifest its wondrous function. Open the Dao-eye wide, and abide in silent illumination of the subtle. Penetrate the celestial mind, and respond with introspection to the numinous stirrings. In adversity, contain and endure; when offended, refrain from ridicule. Humble the heart and respect one’s fellow practitioners; restrain the self and patiently await the unworthy. In all matters of studying the teachings and discussing the scriptures, one should thoroughly explore the spiritual source and root, not merely engage in empty chatter or idle speculation. Penetrate beyond the intent of the sages’ hearts, and merge with the original nature of one’s own being. Only through precise inquiry and clear discernment does one attain the ultimate learning. Mastery of the profound and the broad brings joy in non-action. The heart is orderly, the nature is lucid, and the true joy is boundless. Qi harmonizes with the spirit, and stillness stands alone, the body in unity with the great void. Like water, it is level, clear, gentle, and yielding; like clouds, it is ethereal, drifting, and unfolding. To attain the Dao and understand the heart, one must truly practice the authentic work.

Guard against recklessness and dissipation, and you will not fall into deviation or perversity; abide in sincerity and solidity, and you will fully return to central uprightness. Discard your own faults, and ever delight in peace and harmony; do not assert your own rightness, and who will contend with you? When emotions dissolve, the heart is at leisure; when dust is cleansed, filth is purified.

In managing affairs and making plans, do not act alone with arbitrary authority; in public duties and undertakings, follow the common summons of the community. Cunning and laziness, deceit and guile, lead to moral corruption and invite transgression; jealousy, envy, and deceit bring ruin to the body and loss of life. Pursuing sensory pleasures and seeking to outdo others keeps one in the realm of the ordinary; quelling attachment to self and others leads to sagehood.

Thus, the greatly enlightened accumulate hidden virtues, and true persons secretly cultivate merit. Constantly preserve the qi of the Dao, and avoid the winds of the mundane. Let your precepts be precise and strict, cutting off the four wrongs and the eight consciousnesses; let your practice be continuous and refined, decisively attaining the nine transformations and six penetrations. Indulging in desire and admiration draws one into demonic realms; gluttony and craving cast one into the realm of hungry ghosts.

Sit in constant stillness, and wisdom’s torch shines; do not give free rein to emotions, lest you fall into delusion. Let your aspiration abide in equality, your heart delight in sameness. When encountering things, do not harbor private obscurity; in responding to conditions, strive to act with impartial loyalty. In all conduct, movement and stillness must follow the seasons, with foresight guiding action; deviations must be swiftly corrected, and errors promptly redressed.

A crooked heart leads to contention everywhere; a settled nature wins the trust and submission of all. Arrogance and haughtiness make the nature frivolous; flattery, sloth, and deceit thin one’s allotted fortune. The superior person nurtures qi with generosity and cultivates dignity; the lofty and wise humble themselves to self-mastery. Do not dishonor the purity of the teachings, nor violate the hall’s rules to incur punishment and disgrace. Reverently embody past causes, and all should conduct themselves with refined solemnity.

Merge spirit to solidify your hold, and preserve original qi without precedence. Realize the golden lotus, and ascend to the jade realm. Together wander in the unbegun of the mysterious origin, and share the joy of the primordial before heaven and earth.

Ah! Heaven is round, earth is square—they accord with compass and square; nature is numinous, life is abundant—they unite with the golden immortals.

*The Alchemy of the Bowl Chamber*

The vast sea of the Complete Reality Dao, the profound heart of immortals and sages—within it, the Great Ultimate is made clear, and within it lies hidden the celestial realm of the pot. The aperture of the eyes connects to the center, like a numinous spring welling upward; the heart of the bowl penetrates to the depths, causing the divine water to rise and flow.

In lofty clarity, one looks up to the empty center’s governance; in the abode of supreme goodness, one dwells in the soft compliance of the deep spring. When waves cease, the heart is like limpid blue water; when winds and billows are stilled, the nature’s body is the golden lotus. With single-mindedness, deep and still, unwavering; with three minds, clear and limpid, unchanging.

Do not let the current roll, and you will be at peace in cessation and stability; if you still your breath, you may then be square or round. Now, sitting in the bowl to cultivate stillness, entering the chamber to refine merit—there is emptiness within that brings thorough penetration, and from the solid, one achieves perfect comprehension. Gather heaven and earth within a half-sheng cauldron; conceal emotions and nature within a single bowl chamber. Merge with the ancestral qi of the mysterious origin, and stir the true wind of kalpas past.

All dharmas thoroughly penetrate—oh, how solemn and pure the crimson towers! All dusts are utterly cleansed—oh, how bright and immaculate the numinous palace! Cloud companions unite in heart with reverence; rosy-friend comrades harmonize in aspiration to join as one.

In general, gathering thoughts and calming the mind, returning emotions and recovering nature—daily life must above all be peaceful and regular, and eating and drinking must never be excessive. When the deluded mind is extinguished, the original spirit shines in quiescent illumination; when the true breath is regulated, the life of wisdom merges with the primordial.

When entering meditation, contain your light and silently empty the heart; when emerging from stillness, slowly turn your gaze inward and exit samadhi. The sleep demon suddenly arrives, and no one notices their head nodding and body swaying; the dullness hindrance abruptly comes, and few recognize their mouth gaping and breath scattering.

Patrolling vigilance lies in alertness and rousing; hanging the plaque must uphold correction and rectification. Always return to humility and gentleness; do not obscure yourself with obstinacy. This is for cultivating life and death—do not engage in disputes over self and others. Be sure to rise from dullness and distraction, and shake off torpor to rouse the spirit.

First bow reverently to the immortals and sages, then turn to thank the benevolent and kind. Let awe and joy arise, but never anger or resentment. Naturally, the heart will be at peace, and joy will fill the pot’s interior with spring’s warmth.

Restraining the self to repay virtue is the mark of the superior person; harboring resentment and returning hatred is the way of the petty. Do not assert your own rightness and act in vain deceit; reflect on your faults and nurture simplicity and sincerity.

Examining the rules of the former sages and the bowl’s meaning as taught by the patriarchs: returning metal to its root is the bowl’s source; emotions returning to nature is the bowl’s principle. Round and undifferentiated, it images the primal heaven; empty within, it is like the great beginning. All the myriad things are complete within it; all transformations are fully contained therein.

If there is leakage, one sinks unawares; if there is not a single drop, one suddenly rises. When ice is clear and still, one awakens to returning to the source; when the bowl floats and sinks, one understands the return to the self. Generally, use the nonexistent to illustrate the existent, and borrow the solid to embody the empty. Polishing and refining must come from teachers and friends; thorough comprehension requires diligent effort.

One must inquire into the state before father and mother were born, and constantly turn the light inward to the beginning of diligent body and mind. The truly pure-hearted scholar must be humble and draw near; strange friends and reckless companions must be gently and submissively kept at a distance.

Master Hu’s jar and window—true joy without limit; Yanzi’s bamboo bowl and gourd—supreme joy in abundance. Emulate the sages and immortals, who dwell in seclusion with subtle closeness; follow the true persons, who live in marketplaces with profound abiding.

Attain tranquility and delight in serenity; examine the bowl chamber, the monastic community, and the company of fellow practitioners. Through kalpas, rarely encountered; from past lives, difficult to meet. Refining the true in the empty azure—oh, together delighting in the beginning of blue! The empty chamber generates whiteness—oh, together abiding in the great simplicity!

From beginning to end, from dawn to dusk, the middle period must not be altered; at completion, one may freely go or stay. The carefree superior person’s heart is open and soars with the drifting white clouds; the anxious inferior person’s nature is obscured and lost in the dark mist.

Twice daily, continuously nurturing the spirit; a hundred days, peacefully solidifying qi. Morning and evening, move slowly and relax. Food can connect qi; clothing suffices to ward off cold. Excessive use disorders the viscera; moderation keeps spirit and qi constantly at peace.

With bitter resolve, refine diligently, abandoning sleep and forgetting meals. Constantly in quiescent illumination, willingly endure the grind; returning to the true, observe and strive with the body. Nurture qi and spirit until they are settled and unified, and naturally, nature and life are both preserved.

The One pervades the Three Powers; the wondrous gate of the Limitless opens wide. Six penetrations, four directions—all spacious as the Great Void. Thus may the alms of the faithful be requited, and the host’s hospitality be fully repaid. Swiftly transcend delusion and illusion, forever delighting in true reverence.

Alas! Escape the realm of birth and death, surpass the cosmos of creation. Roam and chant in the primordial, carefree within the Great Image; wander the boundless, rejoicing in the true origin. How expansive—perfect in reality and supreme! How majestic—standing alone, revered above all.

Having entered the Mystery Gate, one must follow its teachings and laws. To ascend the Dao’s shore, one must board the Vessel of Compassion.

**Notice of Punishments by the Venerable Founder, Emperor Chongyang of the Quanzhen Tradition**

The principle of the Dao abides in the profound obscurity above the Supreme Ultimate—how could it be easily perceived? Thus, many seek it, but few awaken. The Way of emptiness and non-action, the vast and spontaneous qi of Heaven and Earth, the interplay of yin and yang giving rise to the myriad forms—how distant it seems across the ages!

Yet, like a vine clinging to a solitary path, one must not deviate in movement or bearing. Now, having secured this auspicious place and privately established this sacred hall, I have gathered virtuous companions from a thousand leagues and united faithful friends from all directions. Therefore, I establish these teachings and rules, humbly inviting your perusal:

1. Violators of national law shall be expelled.
2. Those who steal property and send it to their superiors shall have their robes and alms bowls burned and be expelled.
3. Those who spread gossip, disturb the hall, or incite the assembly shall be caned and expelled.
4. Those who indulge in wine, lust, wealth, anger, or meat—even in one of these—shall be expelled.
5. Those who are cunning, lazy, jealous, or deceitful shall be expelled.
6. Those who are arrogant, unruly, or refuse to follow the assembly shall be punished with fasting.
7. Those who speak boastfully, act rashly, or with violence shall be punished with incense offerings.
8. Those who tell strange tales, jest idly, or leave the hermitage without cause shall be punished with oil offerings.
9. Those who neglect their duties, act cunningly, or are lazy shall be punished with tea offerings.
10. Those who commit minor offenses shall be punished with prostrations.

Respectfully, I address all fellow practitioners: by these laws, wherever three walk together, one may be my teacher. Dwelling in one chamber, we labor together in words and transformation, yet the law does not burden the most virtuous, and firmness does not exceed the utmost softness. The sage examines himself thrice daily—how great is this!

Fortunate to meet a wise teacher and encounter the sacred teachings, if we do not practice them, how can we be called the highest good? I hereby clarify these rules for the entire hall, urging constant vigilance to avoid transgression.

After these prohibitions, men and women must not intermingle, nor may one indulge the heart’s desires. Beware lest the offerings of patrons from all directions become difficult to repay, lest one fail to cherish even an inch of time, lest one waste it in vain.

Diligently cultivate with care, that the heart of the Dao may become steadfast. Without discipline, one risks losing the path ahead—ponder this deeply.

**Notice.**
**Proclamation of Liaozhenzi upon Ascending the Hall.**

Here follows the translation:

---

Indeed, the Mysterious Origin and Sacred Ancestor flung wide the gates of all wonders; the Great Dao of Perfect Realization spread the teachings that transform and nurture all beings. The jade-maidens of Yao Pond—seven golden lotuses of Chongyang; the jasper groves of Lang Garden—ten thousand jade blossoms of Changchun. Though branches diverge and twigs differ, all leaves return to the root in the end. Though schools drift apart and streams stray, all rivers flow back to the sea at last.

In every quarter, teachings are established, gathering cloud-friends from the four seas; in every place, affinities are cultivated, assembling rosy companions from the three mountains. Thatched huts and grassy cottages become halls of precious jade and palaces of lapis; paper robes and hempen garments are graced with starry crowns and lunar pendants. Truly, “humans can magnify the Dao,” unfolding the model of the ancient sages. Naturally, the Dao’s methods respond to people, opening the eyes of later generations.

In the Hall of Perfect Realization, not a single thought entangles the heart; at the gate of the myriad practices, all may now apply their strength. Those above should abide in broad kindness; those below should ever hold reverence and compliance. Contentious dust-minds do not reveal the family style of the Mysterious; Dao-eyes follow one another, preserving the living practice of Danyang.

Once immortals beyond the world, now kin within the gate; dwelling in the world, they cultivate the fruit of the Dao together, transcending the ordinary to join the ranks of immortals. The immortal who has left the household—with clear eyes, they delve deeply; the resolute one who has departed the dust—with a sincere heart, they examine closely.

Wishing to expound further on the secret mysteries, yet mindful of the long standing of the immortal assembly, I bow to the cloud-friends and pray they take care.

**Proclamation of Rules by the Perfected One of Eternal Spring**

Those who dwell in hermitages should embody purity, emptiness, coolness, and tranquility—unfettered, solitary, and serene. Seeing the nature is the essence; nurturing life is the function. Gentleness and weakness are the norm; humility and harmony are virtue. Compassion is the foundation; skillful means are the gate.

Among the assembly, always remain lowly; in stillness, never stir dusty emotions. For all worldly toils, apply effort within your capacity—do not exceed. For every garment and every meal, use no more than necessary. Calculate the hermitage’s provisions—do not hoard surplus. For personal clothing and belongings, do not covet. If the common property has surplus, relieve the poverty of passing travelers in distress. Use it for alms-gathering elsewhere or to prepare vegetarian feasts.

In the twelve hours, do not cling to the illusory; always seek to illuminate the real. Sweep away dust and grime, scour pots and draw water, carry firewood and cook meals. Remove selfish thoughts; do not arouse anger. Each should occupy a chamber, settle the mind, and cultivate the Dao. Each has their assigned duty—take up one task. Exchange and temper the true nature, but do not cling to it as a tool, nor pass judgment on one another.

Strictly subdue the heart, pare away self and others, extinguish sound and form, leave behind form and intellect, and abide in profound desirelessness. When encountering followers of the Three Teachings, treat them with equanimity—do not harbor negligence or disdain.

Do not leave the hermitage without cause. At dusk, bolt the door early; at dawn, open it late. Receive those who bring offerings with ordinary courtesy; if none come, do not waver in mind. For wandering practitioners who pass by, if after three days they are of lofty wisdom, invite them to stay; if they lack aspiration, let them journey elsewhere. Next, verify their credentials and documents, and examine their circumstances closely. If unclear, beware of hidden deceit—untrustworthy individuals may bring instability.

Be especially wary of a certain kind of Daoist—foolish disciples and cunning impostors. With a single misleading word, they may stain the assembly, damage the hermitage, and spread slander. Such ones should be expelled immediately.

If someone seeks to leave the household and join the hermitage, do not hastily admit them. First observe their Dao-qi, then their awakening to the Dao. Consider their ancestral family’s virtue or vice, and the depth of their own conduct. Guide the wise; restrain the dull. For any tasks within the hermitage, first consult the hermitage master, then discuss with the entire assembly.

In leaving the household, regardless of time or age, if one clarifies principle and illuminates the mind, they are worthy of being called an exalted person. In seeking alms for the Dao, do not falsely invoke the name of a master, nor privately claim affiliation with a hermitage. Taking offerings from patrons for personal use is to secretly deceive the common property. Heaven observes and judges—there will be no light punishment. Thus, this proclamation is posted for all to know.

**Proclaimed on the ___ day of this month**
**Letter from Langranzi**

The human body is hard to obtain; birth in the Middle Land is hard to attain; encountering the true Dharma is hard to meet. To possess all three is a fortune beyond measure. Moreover, now that the various immortals have appeared in the world, establishing ladders to ascend the heavens and boats to cross the sea of suffering, silently revealing the mysterious mechanism—how can one not respond?

Awaken fiercely to the swiftness of time; suddenly realize the fleeting clamor of the world. In thought after thought, yearn for the mysterious wind of the ancient sages; in step after step, emulate the return to simplicity of the enlightened ones. Cast aside the fiery pit to tread the cool and refreshing ground; liberate from worldly toil to dwell forever in the realm of freedom.

Do not wait until old age approaches—who knows what comes after this life? Once awakened, one must cut decisively like severing iron or steel—do not drag like water and mud. Correct wrongs and follow what is right—one stroke, two segments. If greed and anger are not severed, how can the field of the heart be clear and still? Only by cutting off love and desire can the vessel of the Dharma be perfected.

Without realizing the true heart, one remains in illusion and dream. Break free from the net of attachment; leap out of the cage of the ordinary. Then ascend to the immortal realm of the Purple Palace, forever escaping the strange allure of the red dust.

A single staff of goosefoot, drifting across the three thousand worlds of clouds and waters; half a patchwork robe, visiting the twelve grotto-heavens. In the gate of purity and stillness, on the path of non-action, the flavor of the Dharma nourishes the body, and true joy is fully revealed.

Reclining in a thatched hall, drinking the pure wind to push open the gate of mystery; dwelling idly in a clay hut, savoring the bright moon to grasp the marrow of yin and yang. Though wives, concubines, children, and grandchildren may be like roosting birds; gold, silver, pearls, and jade are like passing clouds before the eyes.

Thus, rejoicing in relinquishing worldly ties, one returns to the grotto-realm; once the lute-string is snapped, the spilled water cannot be gathered again. Parents, wife, and sons—each follows what is convenient. From this day forth, they become as strangers on the road, forever guests in a foreign land. Those who leave the household life harbor no slothful heart; those who remain in it may follow their scattered destinies as they will. Such is the aspiration.

With reverence, I offer this humble missive, praying you cherish well-being. Here ends the *Pure Regulations of the Complete Realization*.
