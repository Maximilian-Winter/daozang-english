### *The Supreme Cavern-Perfect Jade-Pure Hidden Writings: Scripture of the Divine Wisdom of the High Mystery for Subduing Demons*

This divine scripture emerges from the oral formulas of the Supreme Great Cavern, concealing the celestial and terrestrial sounds of the myriad essences. It was transmitted to the Jade-Pure King of Divine Radiance, the Subduer of Demon Kings, to command demons and summon perfected beings, thereby rectifying and restraining the myriad spirits.

The Most High, accompanied by two hundred and seventy jade maidens of the Upper Palace and two hundred and seventy jade lads of the Golden Immortals, attends to incense and dust-whisks, guarding the divine texts in secret within the Three Primes’ Purple Chamber of the Most High, in the Palace of the Six Harmonies.

The Jade-Pure Lord of the Imperial Sovereign roams above the Cavern-Perfect, feasting on the Dragon Mountain of Radiant Scenery. At times, he invites the exalted guests of the Jade-Pure, the Great Divine Subduer of Demons, the Jade-Pure King of Divine Radiance, to recline in the chambers of jasper and jade, the golden-flowered abode. After a three-year purification fast, he unfolds and recites the *Supreme High Mystery’s Perfect Text of the Lofty Mystery*. Its divine marvels arise spontaneously; its wondrous purport illumines the ten directions. Its lofty cadences resound clearly; its jade brushstrokes gleam like crystal. The numinous splendor adorns the flowery court, blazing across the Great Void. The Eight Emperors align their visions; the Five Ancients flank the perfected. The Primordial Beginning shines forth; the Celestial Prime unfolds in full. Tamed beasts crouch in submission; fierce steeds bolt in terror. The Great Marshal brandishes his banners; a hundred million cavalry array in ranks. Demons are restrained, and evil spirits seized; proclamations disperse the myriad spirits. Mountains and seas grow still; the Three Luminaries merge in brilliance.

Thereupon, the Imperial Lord himself plucks the *Cloud-Zither of the Dragon Mountain of Radiant Scenery*. A hundred harmonies join in chorus; jade tones resonate through the Great Void. The desolate and pure flow forth; jade sounds stir the *qi*. The Eight Winds converge with the perfected at the Central Heaven; the Five Florals array the immortals at the Four Extremities. Divine whistles arise from the gates of jade and jasper; wondrous melodies issue from the mechanism of the Great Cavern.

Then he commands the Jade Maidens of the Dragon-Flower Terrace of the Northern Frigid Golden Platform—Yu Xiaoming, Ding Yunfu, An Yanchang, Fei Siqu, and others—to join in singing the *Poems of the Supreme Cavern Spirits* and the *Melodies for Subduing Demons and Summoning the Perfected*. Their lyrics declare:

> By paired radiance, we urge our flying canopies,
> Swift reins float through the Eight Pures.
> We adjust our reins to open the cinnabar thoroughfare,
> Casting glances to feast in the cloud encampments.
> Harmonizing with the divine, we drift on the waves of the ford,
> Lifting our steps to tread the frigid court.
> Dragon pennants leap with jade substance,
> Feathered robes trail in kingfisher and purple hues.
> Soaring beyond the Six Ridge Terraces,
> In profusion we descend upon the Phoenix City.
> Escorting the Divine Radiance King,
> We ascend to the grand assembly in the Supreme Capital.
> Gazing up, we part the Three Simplicities’ chambers,
> Long mists scatter across the Eight Seas.
> The Perfect Dao hastens to the Orchid Palace,
> Ethereal, it arises from the Void above.
> Towering peaks connect to wondrous visions,
> The Great Splendor illumines the Jade-Pure.
> Accumulated diligence moves the Primordial Simplicity—
> Who can fathom its form or name?
> Awaiting the kalpa’s unended dawn,
> In an instant, the myriad ages commence.
> The dark workings have their own convergence—
> How could one know the heavens and earth would overturn?
> Riding the destiny of self-arising,
> We urge our radiance to traverse the Northern Prime.
> Flowing auroras follow our return,
> Flying canopies shade the verdant axles.
> Ascending the Fourfold Brightness Gates,
> Flowering jasper adorns the Golden Portal.
> Divine radiance penetrates the Orchid Peaks,
> The Three Luminaries shine forth, already distinct.
> Congealing clarity to generate *qi*,
> The Eight Assemblies lay bare the hidden sources.
> Vast and boundless, the Primordial Han begins,
> The Great Yang harmonizes with the morning court.
> The numinous transforms the Four Canopy Courts,
> The wondrous flows unimpeded, the Dharma complete.
> The Dao of natural principle unfolds,
> Luxuriant as the Supreme Highest Texts.
> A thousand demons cannot be bargained into life—
> They are restrained, the demonic hordes of heaven.
> The Primordial Assembly roams the Great Cavern wilds,
> Gathering essences to pluck the sun’s soul.
> Containing the essence, refining in the cinnabar chamber,
> Eternally preserved without end.
> Turning the chariot to rest in the cinnabar chamber,
> Silently contemplating the High Mystery.
> Leisurely and still, free from worldly dust,
> Gazing upon the guests of the auroral realm.
> Concentrating the spirit to mark the Nine Ridges,
> Linking watches to continue the long mists.
> Three candles illumine the Great Splendor,
> The Void’s extremity gives birth to the perfected.
> Radiant scenery gleams over the Jade Continent,
> Harmonizing the spirit to order the flowery years.
> The hidden encounter responds to the dark convergence,
> Faint and distant, it follows the shifting radiance.
> Myriad inspirations arise of themselves—
> Good counsel, too, has its ford.
> The Jade Emperor governs his numinous heart,
> Whispering through the Ninefold Heavens.
> Alone, I tread the dark ridge peaks,
> My thoughts dwelling in the spaceless.
> Without the High Immortal’s cadence,
> How could I tread there, and why seek the green?
> The Dao’s treasury holds the Golden Ultimate Chapters,
> Treasuring my Jade-Pure Stanzas.
> The Great Void penetrates the Mysterious-Perfect,
> Within purity, the Mysterious Subtle arises.
> Azure clouds encircle the cinnabar chamber,
> The distant realm gleams with purple radiance.
> Raising my feet over the myriad ford-waves,
> With mysterious steps, I ascend the jade portals.
> The Eight Winds drum the lofty peaks,
> How mournful the ten thousand clouds!
> Dragons and phoenixes cry in the Nine Auroras,
> What sorrow in the birds’ songs!
> The numinous realm has no bounds,
> On all sides, emptiness hangs.
> Vast and boundless, the Milky Way’s path,
> Drifting, drifting, to the Shangqing precincts.
> The dark abode responds to the convergence of resonance—
> The Perfected One’s heart holds the Mysterious Stillness.
> Counting the kalpas as they unfold,
> Principle’s extremity returns the spirit of itself.
> Reciting aloud the Supreme Highest Texts,
> Secretly seeking to reverse the withered blossoms.
> Turning the poems to summon the perfected,
> Divine wisdom transforms Heaven’s might.
> Issuing commands in accord with the Mysterious Talismans,
> Grasping the tally to march upon the Supreme Subtle.
> Wondrous awakening knows no obstruction,
> The vast numinous barrier opens.
> Merging radiance to return to the tranquil axle,
> Soaring high beyond the ridge’s flight.
> Mysteriously dwelling in the layered Void’s halls,
> In stillness, I contemplate the return of the lofty spirit.

Upon the song’s conclusion, the Lord Emperor thereupon commanded the Five Venerable Perfected Ones to request the *Supreme Highest Great Cavern Demon-Quelling Divine Wisdom Lofty Mystery True Scripture* and the *Jade Clarity Concealed Writ*, encasing it in a cloud-brocade pouch and sealing it with the *Heaven-Opening Seal*. He entrusted it to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital for transcription within the Jeweled Palace, assigning thirty-seven Jade Flower Maidens and thirty-seven Golden Dawn Jade Lads to hold the towels and tend the incense, guarding the divine text.

In accordance with the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, it is transmitted once every seven hundred years, reserved solely for those whose names are inscribed in the *Mystery-Free Imperial Register* from former lives—those of golden bones and jade marrow, whose destiny aligns with transcendence—never to be heard by the uninitiated. Its Way is lofty and wondrous, hence called the *Concealed Writ*, treasured and kept secret by the Most High, never passed to the lower worlds. To recklessly divulge its sacred text is to incur the wind-blade’s judgment, bringing calamity for ten thousand generations.

The *Supreme Divine Scripture* bears the secret taboo names of the exalted perfected above and records the sounds of heaven, earth, and the myriad spirits below, employed to summon immortals and quell demons, to unseal the gates of the hidden. All derive from the oral instructions of the Supreme Highest, applied to the *Great Cavern True Scripture*. The Supreme Lord wields the brush to inscribe it; the Great One sweeps the mat; the Jade Youths compile the passages; the Heavenly Consorts weave the chapters; the Five Emperors collate and proofread, thus completing the numinous text.

The Five Venerable Ones oversee the trial; the Left Immortals assist the perfected; the Great Flower tends the incense; the Golden Dawn stirs the smoke. Divine marvels arise in abundance; jade wisdom illumines the profound. Its numinous transformation wields power throughout heaven and earth; its literary splendor shines upon the Highest Clarity. When uttered, its voice resonates with the Supreme Subtle; its lofty chant echoes afar. To recite it once is to startle the Nine Heavens into listening, to move the Jade Emperor to reverent response, to summon the myriad perfected to attend the court, to extinguish the host of malevolent forces, and to topple the demon kings of heaven. Practicing this Way, one’s *qi* ascends to the pure empyrean, spreading blessings across the nine ford-crossings, redeeming the seven ancestors, and rebirthing them in the heavens above.

Such is the wondrous and precious nature of this divine scripture—its excellence is beyond all reckoning. Whenever one cultivates the *Great Cavern True Scripture of Returning Wind and Blending Harmony* in its thirty-nine chapters, one must first recite the *Supreme Highest Demon-Quelling Divine Wisdom* once, to dispel trials and summon the perfected, to unseal the three barriers, to gracefully restore the bodily form, to cause orchid-*qi* to suffuse the ford-crossings, to settle the myriad spirits in their proper places, to harmonize the jade voice, and to attune the *qi* until its resonance is pure. Only then may one recite the wondrous verses, their golden tones ringing clear in the Supreme Highest, their sublime purport gleaming radiantly across the ten directions. Thus do the August Elders remotely oversee the cinnabar trials; the Three Primes inscribe the records in the Purple Chamber; the seven ancestors are rescued from the dark paths; rebirth is granted in the Southern Immortal Realm. Life and death partake of its blessings; glory and beauty flow to one’s kindred. Its Way is profoundly secret—it must not be recklessly proclaimed. To carelessly reveal its divine sounds is to drown in the river’s source, to incur the seven ancestors’ reproach, to bind one’s sins in the dark mountains. The *Nine Heavens’ Forbidden Writ* is not to be transmitted to the unworthy.

**The Jade Clarity Concealed Writ of the Great Cavern Demon-Quelling Divine Wisdom**

The dark radiance scatters at heaven’s edge,
The clear Han thins as clouds drift back.
Wondrous *qi* illumines the Three Dawns,
Cinnabar clouds blaze upon the Purple Tenuity.
The pure heavens unfurl their numinous splendor,
The flowing empyrean—how misty and vast!
The divine lamp shines through the long night,
The Net of Separation exhales its bright glow.
Four peaks gird the towering clouds,
Suspended essence shades the eight directions.
The Three Primes open the lofty void,
Orchid pavilions part their layered gates.
Golden ramparts mirror Jade Clarity,
Numinous beauty marks the celestial precincts.
Winds arise in the Eight Convergence Palaces,
Fierce beasts gallop through the clouds.
In the bustling Three Cavern Courts,
The perfected mingle in profusion.
Above dwell the Dry Radiance Essences,
Their hidden virtue towering and majestic.
The Great One gathers the affairs of care,
Grasping destiny, wielding the divine banner.
The Orthodox Unity treads the flourishing numen,
Summoning and gathering the myriad spirits.
The Noble Scion flanks the tranquil axle,
The Cavern Yang guards the mystery’s pivot.
At the bright dawn, the Way harmonizes with peace,
The dragon chariot lingers in measured circuit.
The Seven Radiance align with the Spirit Kings,
The whirlwind wheels traverse the ten-thousand-treed stair.
Embodied grace ascends the dark ford,
Soaring steps transcend the ridge’s ladder.
Donning brocade, one enters the divine mounds,
Resplendent, the feathered robes shimmer.
Mysteriously communing in clouded assembly,
Flying radiance bears the divine penetration.
The pure peaks bear no trace of brush,
Wondrous confluence arises in the boundless void.
Golden flowers gird the numinous chariot,
The soaring immortals, wing upon wing.
Ten thousand reins disperse into the empty,
Lush and misty, the dark upper casement.
Within arises the Blended Radiance Lord,
The Nine Emperors exalt the Supreme August.
The bright wheel reflects the Yellow Tranquility,
The feathered pearls gleam in the Dark Yang.
The celestial essence of primordial *qi*,
The Central Five are called the Nurturing Light.
Luminous coalescence gives birth to the spirit,
The Nine Perfected unite as one.
Wondrous radiance reveals the hidden reckoning,
Following resonance, it marks the divine traces.
The Muddy Pellet cavern glows with primordial light,
The moving pearl aligns with the Crimson Palace.
The Primordial Yang governs the Gate of Destiny,
The Three Spirits escort the Purple Youths.
Restraining and summoning, they return above,
Flanking the gates to attend the bright casement.
Lush and dense, they face the Morning Star,
The round flower blazes through the Three Thoroughfares.
The square fullness draws forth and receives life,
Reversing age to return to infant simplicity.
The whirlwind’s brilliance adorns the Nine Heavens,
The heavenly green encircles the cinnabar chamber.
Howling winds coil beyond the mists,
Curving descent to repose in the flowery hall.
Roaming and feasting, gazing upon ten thousand transformations,
Returning to assemble before the Spirit Empyrean King.
The immortal Way delights in the child’s life,
The ghostly Way delights in the child’s doom.
One hears only of the Way that honors life,
Never of the ghostly Way’s exaltation.
Chants and songs mingle with the celestial *qi*,
The merchant’s son lacks the proper verses.
Divine wisdom commands the Vermilion Troops,
The Five Emperors’ talismans chill the northern wastes.
Brandishing banners, they capture the myriad demons,
The jade writs restrain the Northern Feng.
The Way of spontaneous dissolution—
Not your merit that the demons are destroyed.
The dawn’s drum resounds with the long fan,
All beings rejoice upon the empyrean peak.
Looking down upon the four flights of thanksgiving,
The heavenly tribulation shall never end.
Within the wondrous arises the true radiance,
The returning chariot lingers in sorrowful delay.
Intent harmonizes in hidden resonance,
Lifting and guiding the Supreme Highest’s grace.
Soaring wings await the wondrous assembly,
Gazing into the cavern, the heart turns sorrowful.
With a whistle, a sigh, a sudden cry—
In an instant, one traverses the nine enclosures.
Gathering *qi*, returning to the primal exchange,
Merging radiance to dwell in the dark mystery.

At this, the Seven Essences halt their shining,
The layered gates open wide,
A hundred yangs surge like lightning,
The five stars hasten in their courses.
Grasping the tally, commanding the spirits,
All *qi* is summoned and pursued.
Iron bears array in ambush,
Fierce tigers transform their might.
The Six Masters behead the demons,
The Bronze Heads seize the transgressors.
The Heavenly Apes devour poison,
The Crystal Shields shatter and crumble.
The myriad spirits are annihilated,
The Six Heavens collapse and topple.
The Three Ways are rectified—
What *qi* does not return?
Mountains and rivers are overturned,
Sun and moon dim their light.
Divine beasts drop their manes,
The Golden Wings cease their flight.
The Five Emperors gird their sashes in the divine precincts,
The myriad spirits receive judgment in the Supreme Subtle.
The Supreme Highest floats its canopy above the cinnabar cliffs,
The Eight Radiance urge their chariots at the empyrean gates.
Beholding the wondrous transformations of the cavern’s source,
I rejoice in my Way, my heart at ease.

The High and Mysterious Perfected of the Great Cavern says: When one wishes to ascend the high seat and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one must first sit upright, face due north, and strike the teeth thirty-two times. Closing the eyes, one visualizes oneself clad in a nine-colored feathered robe adorned with dragon patterns, wearing the Jade Dawn crown, and holding a nine-colored tally. A green dragon attends on the left, a white tiger guards on the right; a floral canopy shades the head, and one sits upon a lion. Immortal youths attend with incense, jade maidens scatter blossoms; purple clouds billow thickly, filling the hall, while five-colored hues of dark and yellow array before and behind, both within and without, all made radiant and clear. Then one recites the *Hidden Writ of Divine Wisdom for Vanquishing Demons*.

Upon completion, one closes the eyes and silently intones, bowing in the heart to the four directions. From the mouth, one draws the essence of the green *qi* of the Eastern Azure Yang, swallowing nine times to fill and suffuse the liver’s palace. Next, one draws the essence of the red *qi* of the Southern Cinnabar Spirit, swallowing three times to fill and suffuse the heart’s palace. Then, one draws the essence of the white *qi* of the Western Metal Soul, swallowing seven times to fill and suffuse the lungs’ palace. Next, one draws the essence of the black *qi* of the Northern Mysterious Radiance, swallowing five times to fill and suffuse the kidneys’ palace. Finally, one draws the essence of the yellow *qi* of the Central Lofty Sovereign, swallowing twelve times to fill and suffuse the spleen’s palace.

When the *qi* of the five directions has been swallowed in full, one softly intones:
*"The five *qi* blend and arise,
The essence of the Mysterious Highest,
Filling the five palaces,
The six conduits gleam bright.
Within they irrigate, without they overflow,
Both surface and interior are purified.
Banishing filth, summoning the true,
I soar to the Supreme Numinous,
Ever facing the Highest Dawn."*

After reciting the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one shakes the left hand three times, ritually casting the Flowing Bell. Then one shakes the right hand seven times, ritually casting the Seven Origins of the Vast and Open. Next, one lifts the head, then sways the neck nine times, in accord with the celestial pattern. Then one stamps the foot once, in accord with the numinous tremor. One sways the body fourteen times to gladden the myriad spirits. Next, one wipes the eyes three times to brighten the Three Luminaries. Then one pinches the nose seven times to illumine the Bright Beam. Next, one presses the two gates behind the brows three times to block the source of evil. Then one wheels the body three times to open the Heavenly Window. Finally, one swallows saliva nine times to ingest the Jade Fluid.

When the entire body’s rites are complete, the myriad spirits all rejoice. Harmonizing the voice and rectifying the *qi*, one then recites the Jade Chapters, softly intoning:
*"Bearing heaven, treading earth,
Entering and exiting the cavern’s gate,
Left hand shaking the Flowing Bell,
Right hand casting the Seven Origins.
Girded with gold, adorned with jade,
Immortal robes fluttering,
The Eight Radiance arrayed,
Urging the chariot to ride the clouds.
Ten thousand circuits, all luminous and penetrating,
I fly into the Emperor’s Dawn."*

Thereupon, one sits upright and recites the scripture.

This is the wondrous pattern of the Great Cavern, the proper form of reverent movement. If the ritual sequence is performed correctly, the Highest will cast its gaze upon one; the Three Origins will descend to the seat; the myriad spirits will come to pay homage; heavenly demons will submit; the Five Sufferings will all be dissolved; the seven ancestors will receive blessings; divine phoenixes will come soaring; cloud-dragons will leap and dance. The host of immortals will praise one in the High Void, and the Five Elders will inscribe one’s name in the Emperor’s Register.

For all who cultivate the Supreme Way and recite the numinous chapters yet fail to perform these rites, the celestial forms are deficient and incomplete. Such negligence is insufficient for prostration and submission, and one will be mocked by the Ghostly Gods of the Northern Emperor, punished by the Three Officials, tested and thwarted by the host of demons, and perish to no avail. Thus, to transgress the Dao is easy, while to cultivate it is difficult. Only by attaining its proper forms and patterns can one ascend the steps to flight and transcendence.

**Hidden Writ of Divine Wisdom for Vanquishing Demons Within the Great Cavern**

When reciting the scripture of the Highest Lord of the Jade Void, one must visualize the true *qi* of the Lesser Lad of the Grand Tenuity, the essence of the Dryness-Spirit, glowing red, entering from the mud-pill of one’s own crown and descending to fill the root of the tongue, the palace of blood and fluids. Then one softly intones:
*"True *qi* flows downward to fill the hidden pass,
Stabilizing the spirit, securing essence, sealing the source of death.
The Jade Scripture’s wisdom illumines, communicating with the myriad spirits,
For me it summons the true destiny to abide long,
Delivering the seven ancestors to revert as womb-born immortals."*

Thereupon, one draws the red *qi* and swallows it three times to conclude. Then one recites the scripture. Upon completion, one intones again:
*"Heaven holds the great hidden treasure of life,
Called the *qi* above the Bright Beam.
Guard my sealed gate below the absolute barrier,
And receive anew the outer gate of the prison of birth."*

Then one summons the Feathered Lad of Augmented Origin to array before the pavilion of the Green Chamber, causing him to untie the hundred knots of the seven ancestors, to drift with the wind and leave their roots, to match heaven in shifting their foundation, and to enter the mysterious through transformation.

The hidden writ of the Jade Clarity further intones:
*"Primal *qi* is not originally born,
The five paths bear the numinous forth.
Male and female entrust the spirit to transformation,
The forest of stars, profound and dark, billows thickly.
The Jade Tone resounds with Supreme Harmony,
Ten thousand chants arise from the midst of nothingness.
The immortal court revolves through nine changes,
The hundred blends all attain the One.
Change holds union within the void,
Together they enter the Emperor’s hall and chamber."*

This is the secret inner writ of the Highest. Should it be divulged, the seven ancestors will bear the blame.

When reciting the scripture of the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign, one must visualize the true *qi* of the Venerable Duty of the Most Honored Unity, glowing purple, entering from the mud-pill of one’s own crown and descending to fill the Jade Pillow below, the rear gate of the mud-pill. Then one softly intones:
*"The Most Honored Unity preserves destiny,
Stabilizing the spirit and settling life.
For me it summons above the *qi* of the Emperor’s true,
Below it fills the courtyard of the Purple Gate.
The Jade Scripture, gazed upon, penetrates,
The Nine Origins shine bright.
The seven ancestors rejoice together,
All ascending to the Highest Clarity."*

Thereupon, one draws the purple *qi* and swallows it three times to conclude. Then one recites the Jade Scripture. Upon completion, one intones again:
*"My body is the ever-dying pass,
The womb’s knot harms the hundred spirits.
When the hundred spirits untie the womb’s knot,
The roots within the placenta scatter.
Seven generations enter the Emperor’s chamber,
One body unites with the divine immortals.
Divine immortals gather in the Jade Hall,
The seven ancestors are born in the Southern Palace.
Together they wear the initial clarity of governance,
Sharing the seat of the child’s Way of health.
The myriad perfected guard the body’s form,
On this day they conceal the initial brightness.
The Emperor’s One revolves male and female,
Preserving and guarding the gates of the hundred spirits.
Sealing the myriad evil portals,
Receiving office in the Nine Palaces,
Overseeing the summons of the Controller of Destiny,
Thrice daily attending the mud-pill."*

When reciting the scripture of the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign, one must visualize the true *qi* of the Imperial Lord Fengling, glowing purple and lush, entering from the mud-pill of one’s own crown and descending to fill the space between the brows, the outer palace of the Purple Gate.

Upon completion, softly intone the incantation:
"The Imperial Lord transmits the talismanic registers,
Upright *qi* summons the myriad spirits.
Above, it calls forth the Jade Perfected *qi*,
Filling and spreading between the brows.
Merging as one to generate the Emperor’s radiance,
The Three Primes perfect my transcendence.
Swift and radiant, I ride the soaring canopy,
Ascending directly to the loftiest pavilion."

Upon completion, draw in the purple *qi* and swallow it thrice to conclude.

Then recite the Jade Scripture. When finished, offer this prayer:
"Supporting the dawn’s first glow,
Purple clouds illumine the dark slopes.
Resplendent, the circular light flourishes,
Dazzling and bright, it shines through the gauze.
Subtle and distant, the numinous radiance’s origin,
Lush and scattered, the azure’s splendor.
The Nine Heavens’ halls host jade guests,
Golden chambers resound with celestial hymns.
Virtuous indeed, facing the Emperor’s guests,
Commanding the dark chariots of the summoned lords.
Seven ancestors untie the root of the womb,
Generation upon generation, they become immortals’ kin."

The Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity offers this further prayer:
"The Cinnabar Sovereign revolves the pearl,
Guarding and stabilizing the Gate of Death.
Above, the One Crimson Child,
The Mysterious Emperor congeals in heaven.
One name: Lord of No Above,
Also the Primordial of the Three Origins.
Supporting and nurturing me,
Enabling my ascent upon the cloud-wheel,
Ever seated in the Upper Clarity’s pavilion,
The Seven Mysteries as Transcendent Lords."

When reciting the Scripture of the Supreme Sovereign Purple Dawn Lord, visualize the true *qi* of the Left Non-Bearing Duke, Master Xuanchong, its jade light luminous and flowing, entering from the mud-pill of your crown and descending to fill the space beneath your left armpit, the posterior gate of the liver.

Upon completion, softly intone:
"The Non-Bearing Divine Perfected engenders the Purple Sovereign,
The Three *Qi* merge and harmonize into palace tones.
Summoning and guiding the true *qi* to stabilize the bladder,
Flowing through the Three Cinnabar Fields to meet in the Grotto Chamber,
Transforming my cinnabar countenance to attain transcendence,
Soaring to the cloud pavilions and entering the Golden Wall."

Upon completion, draw in the jade light and swallow it thrice to conclude.

Then recite the Jade Scripture. When finished, offer this prayer:
"Spirits settled, *qi* pervading,
Above, in communion with heaven.
Transcending the earthly gate,
Passing through the celestial portal.
Concealing breath in the four directions,
The Seven Stars disperse and divide.
Flying through the Yin Chamber,
Sun and moon plant their roots.
Guarding gold and treasuring jade,
Commanding and restraining the myriad spirits.
Who is the Transcendent King?
I have already attained perfection.
Concealing and preserving the feminine and masculine,
Pervading the four quarters in unity.
Binding the central azure *qi*,
Named ‘Prolonging Prosperity,’
Styled ‘Harmonious Infant.’
Governing destiny for eternal duration,
The Mysterious returns to the inner fortress,
Celebrating the expansion of the Dark Enclosure.
This day I perfect my truth,
Soaring as an immortal to the Cloud Capital."

When reciting the Scripture of the Heavenly Emperor of Grand Tenuity, visualize the true *qi* of the Right White Prime, Lord Dongyang, its golden light radiant and gleaming, entering from the mud-pill of your crown and descending to fill the space beneath your right armpit, the posterior gate of the lungs.

Upon completion, softly intone:
"Dongyang’s numinous treasure flourishes the spirit’s life,
Golden light shines resplendent within the *qi*’s essence.
Summoning the true to secure the spirit, ensuring longevity,
Extracting the dark root to return to the womb’s infancy.
Harnessing the dawn’s *qi*, I ascend to Jade Clarity."

Upon completion, draw in the golden light and swallow it thrice to conclude.

Then recite the Jade Scripture. When finished, softly intone:
"Dongyang’s numinous standard,
Guarding the body’s Gate of Death.
Opening to expel the Three Corpses’ worms,
Receiving the Nine Perfected’s origin.
Untying the womb, dispersing stagnant blood,
A hundred joints engender upright spirits.
Seven ancestors extinguish the corpse’s calamity,
Eradicating the afflictions of descendants.
Black *qi* refines and generates,
Severing the womb’s root of death.
Former generations receive the Dao’s virtue,
Later ones obtain the Emperor’s transcendence.
Who are these Emperor Transcendents?
Luminous, the seven generations’ descendants.
Their ancestors enter the Cinnabar Capital,
Together seated at the Gate of Essence’s summit."

When reciting the Scripture of the Three Origins Purple Essence Lord, visualize the true *qi* of the Central Controller of Destiny, the Venerable Lord, its color like purple clouds, blazing and brilliant, entering from the mud-pill of your crown and descending to fill the Crimson Palace within the heart.

Upon completion, softly intone:
"The Controller of Destiny determines the years,
The Venerable Lord safeguards transcendence.
Conveying names to the Southern Palace,
Presenting them before the Imperial Lord.
Generation upon generation as Transcendent Kings,
Extracting the seven generations’ root.
Blessings and recompense without end,
All as proclaimed in the Jade Scripture."

Upon completion, draw in the purple cloud *qi* and swallow it thrice to conclude.

Then recite the Jade Scripture. When finished, offer this prayer:
"Converging the Three Origins’ threefold embrace,
Escorting and guiding the returned womb-infant.
Bearing the light, guarding the lower pass,
Attending the Mysterious, awaiting the moon’s clarity.
Thereupon, merging and sealing the Li’s lock,
The bright chariot receives completion.
Fortune extends through seven generations,
Calamity disperses, the Mysterious engenders.
Guarding the radiance of the six directions,
Ascending the Brahma of the seven numina.
Together engendering billions and thousands,
Suddenly ascending to the Jade Court.
The infant lingers,
Feathered robes command transcendence.
Auspicious aid by the myriad,
Fortune spreads by the thousand.
Bones reflect jade’s luster,
Blood inherits the jasper spring.
Living in joy with heaven and earth,
Sharing the same years as sun and moon."

The Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity offers this further prayer:
"Fortune spreads before the Seven Mysteries,
Sins extinguish within the Three Paths.
The numinous breath of the Nine Dawns’ tips,
Absorbing *qi* into the Supreme Emperor’s palace.
The Five Transcendents escort the Great One,
Together standing in the profound and obscure void.
Thereupon, concealing themselves in the Upper Clarity’s chamber,
Feathered brightness in the Emperor’s One’s abode."

When reciting the Scripture of the True Yang Primordial Elder, the Mysterious One Lord, visualize the true *qi* of the Life Gate’s Peach Lord, the Child’s Way of Health, its color like yellow clouds, entering from the mud-pill of your crown and descending to fill the space outside the Life Gate within the navel.

Upon completion, softly intone:
"The true and numinous upright spirit,
Named the Peach Lord.

White Qi moves the mist.
Filling the Three Clarities,
Purple Chamber’s treasure nectar.

Below, seals the Gate of Death.
Let my feathered tally stand
Before the Jade Emperor.
Seven ancestors and parents,
Return to life in the Southern Pavilion.
Tiger-clad, they seize demons,
Dragon banners command spirits.

Inscribing names in Jade Perfection.

My Dao unfolds and expands.
Feathered robes and silk skirts,
Flying to the Supreme Capital."*

Together arrayed with the congealed Feathered Pearl.
Nine Honored and hosts of emperors born,
Scenery and grotto revolve in an instant.
Seven ancestors’ knots dissolve and scatter,
Filth and accumulation suddenly vanish.

Body ascends to the Grand Auroral Palace,
Controlling dragons to feast in Jade Void.

Reclining and rising with the True Support."*

Flying to pay court to the Imperial Lord."*

Preserving the adept’s Six Harmonies,
Worries and sufferings sink into the Crooked Gate.
Deathly Qi sealed beneath the earth,
Body and Imperial Unity Lord,
Together lapels joyful in the Six Palaces.
Mirroring the heart in the Cinnabar Mysterious Chamber,
Bright Qi in the Mud-Pill wilds,
Body radiant with golden brilliance.
Feathered register summons the true,

Ever with sun and moon.

Silent and inwardly focused,
Ascending to the Imperial Court."*

The Hidden Writ of Jade Purity’s Nine Heavens’ Upper Text,
Issuing from the Highest Oral Instructions,
Dissolving stagnation, dispersing resentment,
The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Grotto True Scripture,
Their principles culminate herein.
Above, they summon the radiance of exalted numina,
Below, they extinguish the misfortunes of ten thousand demons.
Excerpted from the *Secret Essentials*, Forty-Second Yang Character Section.

Reciting once opens the thirty-nine gates of the Dark Pass,
Receiving jade nectar,
Dead qi sinks and obstructs,
Hundred spirits rejoice within,
Hundred spirits thus unobstructed,
Voices reach the Nine Mysteries,
Qi brightens the Purple Empyrean,
Echoes knock at Jade Dawn,
Five Emperors gird their sashes,
Myriad numina attend the chariot,
Life upon life comes to return,
Seven ancestors ascend and transmigrate,
Body attains feathered wings,
Riding radiance, mounting clouds,
Soaring through Jade Purity,
Rank equal to the Purple Guest,
This is the wondrous Dao of the Exalted Mystery,
The secret篇 of Jade Purity.
Excerpted from the *Secret Essentials*, Forty-Second Yang Character Section.
All confer golden names and jade characters,
Highest Immortal Perfected Ones.
Within seven hundred years,
Those whose quality accords may receive a single transmission.

Later Sages say: Upon receiving the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Grotto True Scripture* and practicing its cultivation,
First perform the Great Grotto’s rites and protocols,
Recite the Hidden Writ of Jade Purity,
Further contemplate the hundred spirits’ inner names,
Externally blocking the ten thousand trials,
Internally sealing the death pass.
Thus, one recitation suffices for a day and night.
Reciting the thirty-nine chapters alone,
Without the need to repeatedly follow the original ritual protocols.
If one intends to ascend the fast and recite the scripture again the next day,
Then once more follow the original procedure.

Should one wish to traverse the Five Marchmounts, to wander and observe the myriad mountains, to preserve life and halt the whitening of hair, to safeguard longevity through kalpas of years—yet not yet desire to soar aloft and depart far from the world—then on the days of the Great Year-Star, one’s own life-star, and the Eight Seasonal Nodes, one may simply recite the *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity*, inwardly contemplating the hundred spirits once through, without need to recite the *Jade Scripture*. After a hundred such recitations, qi will ascend to mingle with the dawn clouds, and the hundred spirits will coil within. After a thousand recitations, the Three Primes will descend, one’s name will be inscribed in the Emperor’s register, and one will long preserve the sun and moon, matching the years of heaven and earth. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao will be perfected: one will ride clouds and mount dragons, roam the Great Void, and lead the host of immortals. This Dao is lofty and wondrous; guard it well and do not reveal it to the untrue.

The *Purple Text, Cinnabar Chapters, Green-Character Hidden Writ*—one hundred twenty words—is the qi of the Nine Heavens above, congealed from the essence of purple radiance, formed into natural chapters that manifest within the Jade Purity Palace. Its text shines resplendent, illuminating the Highest Clarity, enabling the exalted to inscribe its brushstrokes and penetrate its hidden sounds, thereby upholding the Jade Abode, commanding the Nine Heavens, governing and wielding numinous power, summoning perfected ones and inspecting spirits. It was originally the token worn by the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, transmitted to the Jade Purity Emperor-Lord, the Great King Who Dispels Demons, and the Jade Purity Divine Numinous King, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens who attend the text, correcting lapses and negligence, and guarding the bodies of those who bear the text.

One who bears this text becomes equal in perfection to the Nine Heavens, one’s name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace, one’s rank is aligned with the Highest Mystery, one’s body emits purple light, and one’s neck bears a halo of perfect clarity. Roaming the Great Void, the ten realms will welcome one in attendance; the Three Primes will descend, and one will feast together in the cloud-borne chariots of the heavens. To practice the Dao of divine transcendents and recite the *Highest Jade Purity Hidden Writ of the Great Grotto True Scripture*, one should sit upon a square zhang of space, the heart illumined by the *Purple Text, Cinnabar Chapters*. In the left hand, grasp the flowing-gold fire-bell; in the right, wield the *Huoluo* of the Seven Primes. Then the Jade Void will descend unbidden, the Great Grotto will open its gates without knocking, the ten thousand perfected will respond to the moment and gather, and the host of demons will bind themselves and perish. Directing the eight qi, revolving the five celestial bodies, one sits and commands the ten thousand spirits, employs and governs the host of immortals, qi merging with the Highest Void, form equaling the Purple Guest.

The secret mysteries of the Nine Heavens, the hidden writ of Jade Purity—should one leak these chapters, the body will be scourged by the wind-knife, and accountability will extend to the Seven Ancestors. The trials of life and death shall be as the oaths of the Nine Heavens. Those whose golden names and jade characters are arrayed in the charts of the Nine Heavens, who are deemed worthy to behold this text, shall take three feet of crimson-woven silk as ground, inscribe the cinnabar chapters upon the silk with purple brush, and present ninety feet of purple-woven silk, a golden fish, and a jade dragon. Proceeding to the master, purify oneself for ninety days, face north, and swear an oath to the Nine Heavens before transmission. The disciple shall receive it in a brocade pouch, wearing it over the heart.

Those who bear the *Purple Text, Cinnabar Chapters* shall have ranks aligned with the Highest Mystery; those who receive the *Jade Purity Hidden Writ* shall have ranks aligned with the Great Perfected. In sitting, rising, sleeping, and resting, they shall ever intertwine with the Jade Void, the Jade Flower shall guard the perfected at their left and right, and the Five Thearchs shall hover near the sleeping chamber. One must not mingle with the common and vulgar, nor defile the exalted perfected. To violate this is to invite the departure of spirits and the approach of demons, to be scourged and lose one’s immortality.

When bearing the *Purple Text, Cinnabar Chapters*, whether entering or exiting, resting or sleeping, or at the time of practicing the Dao, one should always first contemplate one’s body suffused with purple radiance, darkly veiled above, qi swirling around the body. Then knock the teeth nine times and invoke:

*"Ninefold Jade Void, eightfold purple radiance coiled,
Dark light layered, Jade Purity spills its essence.
Purple text, cinnabar writ, manifesting the Nine Heavens,
Commanding the ten thousand spirits, summoning and employing the host of immortals.
Might subduing the myriad myriads, inspecting and shearing the thousand thousands.
Echo and shadow instantly gather, five clouds emit smoke.
Flying chariots and purple canopies swiftly arrive before me.
May I ride the void, ascend the Jade Dawn."*

Conclude by drawing in the purple qi twelve times and swallowing it. After nine years of this, a canopy of purple clouds will shine and cover one’s body, one’s body will generate purple light illuminating the ten directions, one will communicate with spirits and summon the perfected, and one will penetrate and observe the Great Void.

Of old, the Lady of the Upper Prime transmitted the hidden writ to the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony; the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony transmitted it to the Lord of Young Yang. When the Lord of Yang perfected the Dao and ascended the void, he sealed the text within the grotto-chamber of the Nine Doubts, where it shall be transmitted after seven hundred years to those whose truth accords and whose mystery is penetrated. Later students who cultivate with devotion shall naturally feel the resonance if they are predestined.

*The Highest Jade Purity Hidden Writ of the Great Grotto True Scripture for Destroying Demons and Cultivating Divine Wisdom of the High Mystery* concludes.
