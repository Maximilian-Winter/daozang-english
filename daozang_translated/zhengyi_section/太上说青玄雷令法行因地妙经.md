*The Most High’s Scripture on the Wondrous Practices of the Azure Mystery Thunder Decrees in the Realm of Causes*

We invoke the Azure Mystery Earth-Thunder Decrees,
The eternal life-bestowing true qi of bing and ding.
With a stilled heart, we turn in reverence—suddenly they arrive,
Crimson-haired and azure-faced, manifesting majestic power.
Clad in golden armor and fiery robes, gleaming like the sun,
They appear in true form at every prayer and supplication.
The soaring Numinous General, styled Illustrious Martial,
Grasps the winds and thunders, commanding all legions.
Aiding the Dao, saving the people, fostering goodness and benefit,
They act on Heaven’s behalf, enacting great compassion.
Gathering blessings, dispelling calamities, driving away pestilence,
Expelling evil, aiding the upright, sweeping away demonic miasma.
Their wondrous merits and fruits of victory are boundless—
We bow our heads in homage, offering sincere devotion.

At that time, during the first year of the Tianbao era, on the fifteenth day of the third month, the Most High Lord Lao ascended the Nine Qi Cloud-Flower Throne within the Supreme Clarity Palace, high in the realm of Great Clarity. Thereupon, the great Celestial Emperors of the Ten Poles, the perfected beings of the utmost truth, the myriads of stellar constellations, and an innumerable host—robed in misty rosy clouds, their banners and standards fluttering—rode upon whirlwinds and flying wheels, their auspicious radiance illuminating the ten directions. Phoenixes cried and simurghs sang, celestial music harmonized, and all floated through the void to heed the Most High’s proclamation of the wondrous Dao.

The assembly rejoiced, turning their heads in reverent awe.

At that moment, among the gathering was a perfected one named Wondrous Practice, whose merits transcended the Three Realms and whose deeds filled the heavens. Stepping forth from the ranks, he held a tablet and offered obeisance, kneeling to speak:

“Your servant observes that in the lower realms, within the geng and xin territories of the Shu region, disasters and misfortunes arise in succession, pestilence spreads unchecked, plants and trees wither together, and the people dwindle and suffer. Thus, with all sentient beings, we remain burdened by sorrow, wishing to rely upon your compassionate light to broadly extend salvation and deliverance.”

Lord Lao addressed Perfected Wondrous Practice, saying: “Excellent, excellent. Return to your place, for I shall now expound. It is because the qi of Metal Heaven has reached its destined extremity that yin and yang have fallen into discord, mountains and rivers become stagnant and knotted, the land grows obstructed, calamities and pestilence overflow, and all beings endure affliction. I shall divide my radiance and issue decrees to purify below.”

The great assembly rejoiced without end, offering praise and admiration.

The Heavenly Master beneath the dais, leading his divine assembly known as the Governors of the Five Peaks and Watercourses, knelt and addressed the Dharma Lord: “Your compassionate power need not be exerted. Your servant oversees the earth deities within the Five Peaks, and I have commanded Marshal Wen to act as Heaven’s agent, aiding the Dharma to save the people, commanding the thunder troops, and thereby dispelling those calamities.”

Perfected Wondrous Practice then arose and inquired of the Heavenly Master: “I wonder—from what origin does this general arise? Through what practices cultivated in former lives does he now wield command over military strategy and possess the power to shatter disasters and misfortunes?”

The Heavenly Master replied: “This general is the essence of bing and ding, the spirit of the Fire Emperor. In the first year of *Yanping* during the Han dynasty, on the third day of the third month, he transformed and descended into the household of a great scholar in Pingyang. His holy mother, while napping at midday, dreamed of swallowing sunlight and awoke pregnant. She carried the child for thirteen months, and in the first year of *Yongchu*, the *dingwei* year, on the third day of the third month at the hour of noon, he was born in her chamber. His appearance was majestic, his spirit clear, his frame imbued with the bone structure of an immortal. Upon his left flank were twenty-four celestial talismans, and upon his hands, the characters *bing* and *ding* faintly inscribed. From birth, he was wondrously gifted; as he grew, his intelligence shone. He never violated his celestial purity, maintaining focused contemplation from beginning to end. With a sincere heart, he revered the Dao, accumulating virtuous deeds to save others. His sublime causes and wondrous fruits perfectly harmonized, and thus the Three Officials commended him, the Five Thunders examined his merits, and he was memorialized before the Supreme Emperor. In the sixth year of *Yongjian*, the *xinhai* year, on the *shangding* day of the third month at the hour of noon, he received the Jade Emperor’s decree. Golden-armored divine messengers in embroidered robes delivered the celestial military tally, bestowing upon him a golden ring and jade warrant, along with cloud-script celestial writings. He was appointed to command the armies of the Peak Palace, becoming chief among the myriad spirits of the Five Peaks. His comings and goings in audience were unrestricted by the gates of Heaven. Having received his commission, he was to eternally guard the court of the peaks. A living likeness was installed to the left of the palace hall, and the next day, he manifested transformation and departed.

This divine being, commanding troops to aid the Dharma, suppresses and exterminates demonic sorcerers, subdues demons and slays monsters, delivers the dying and rescues the living, drives away plagues and sweeps away pestilence. In countless acts of goodness, he broadly benefits the multitudes. His merits in the world are beyond reckoning.”

Perfected Wondrous Practice, upon hearing this account, leapt with joy and offered praise. At that moment, the Perfected One made a request.

Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master again: “You should swiftly dispatch this general for me to purify this region.” Thereupon, the Heavenly Master knelt and took his leave.

The Most High sent an emissary bearing a talisman to summon the Earth Deity Marshal Wen. Appearing in a form nine feet tall, with red hair and a green face, golden eyes and fanged teeth, his mouth like a brazier of fire, he wore a purple kerchief knotted at the front, a floral robe girded with a sash, and black boots with upturned toes. In his hand, he wielded a divine-edge sword, and astride a black steed swift as the wind, he led the celestial armies, thunder troops, and peak soldiers. Banners clustered around him as he was escorted forward. He paid reverent homage to the compassionate countenance and attentively listened to the proclamation.

The Most High issued his decree, and the Marshal received his command and departed. Displaying his divine might, he issued orders to his left and right and proceeded directly to western Shu. Within ten days, he pacified the pestilence, eradicated heterodox sects, and brought peace to the land. From yellow-haired children to white-haired elders, from women to maidens, from the young to the old, from near to far, all within the region were able to live in peace and pursue their livelihoods.

Thereupon, the Marshal arrayed his *gang* and stood upon the *dui* position. Pointing toward the *zhen* palace, he intoned an incantation, stirring it into being:

“Spirit of the *li* palace,
Essence of the Fire virtue.
True *qi* of *bing* and *ding*,
Resplendent yang spirit.
Manifesting form on Eastern Peak,
Commanding the Emperor’s troops.
Driving thunder and wielding lightning,
Rolling back mist and piercing clouds.
Relieving the people’s suffering,
Slaying demons and destroying spirits.
Temporal disasters swept away,
Auspicious blessings converge.
The hundred spirits tremble in submission,
The myriad gods all revere.
At summons, he responds;
At call, he appears.
City gods and earth deities,
Eternally preserve purity and peace.
I uphold the decree,
Wind and fire never cease.”

When the Marshal had finished reciting this incantation, he withdrew his troops and led his generals to express gratitude to the Heavenly Master. Having received the command and relied upon the compassionate Dharma power, he had swept away the plague of Shu, leaving all purified. He secretly transmitted the sacred command, the talismanic seal of the Five Peaks, to the world, naming it: *Azure Mystery Earth Thunder*. He vowed to protect and assist the Dharma-enforcing Perfected Ones, to cure illnesses, drive away pestilence, eradicate evil, and guide all toward rectitude.

Taking his leave, he departed. Thereupon, the Heavenly Master offered praise and ascended to audience with Lord Lao, recounting these meritorious deeds that would flow through the world, universally aiding all beings.

Wherever this scripture resides, divine spirits shall gather to protect it, and calamities shall not arise. The superior practitioner who upholds and practices it may propagate the true teaching, invigorate the authentic Daoist wind, ensure the peace of the state and the well-being of the people. Should pestilence, epidemics, or unrelenting drought and flood occur; should birds and rodents bear omens, or serpents and insects spread misfortune—those who take refuge in this scripture shall find all disasters and misfortunes forever dispelled, all perils silently dissolved.

Should one encounter the peril of war or childbirth, the calamities of fire and flood, or the ravages of bandits and thieves; should demonic forces assail or malevolent sorcery afflict—if, with sincerity, one burns incense, chants, and recites this scripture, devoutly praying for its aid, the divine might shall descend without delay. Doors shall flourish, households prosper, and the people dwell in peace.

Those who reverently prostrate before this scripture shall accrue boundless, inconceivable merit.

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding this scripture, the assembled immortals of the heavens extolled and praised it with joy, receiving and upholding its teachings with faith.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture on the Origin of the Azure Mystery Thunder Rites*, as spoken by the Most High.
