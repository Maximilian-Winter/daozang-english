The above talismanic scripts are all to be inscribed in cinnabar.

**The Six Palaces of Fengdu in the Northern Culmen**
To the left of Fengdu Mountain lies the *gui* (癸) region of the north. Thus, the northeast is the "Ghost Gate," the root of deathly *qi*. The mountain stands two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Its cavern-heaven lies beneath the mountain, spanning fifteen thousand *li* in circumference, and both above and below are the palatial chambers of ghosts and spirits. Atop the mountain, ten upper palaces govern ghosts, while below, twelve palaces command spirits, each palace spanning a thousand *li* in circumference. To the left and right of the upper palaces are six palaces each, and likewise for the lower palaces—thus making twenty-four palaces in total.

**The Six Upper Palaces:**
1. The First Palace: *Zhou Jue Yin* Heavenly Palace
2. The Second Palace: *Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong* Heavenly Palace
3. The Third Palace: *Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu Cheng* Heavenly Palace

Those who cultivate the Dao and know the names of the upper and lower ghostly palaces of Fengdu Mountain shall find no harm from the hundred ghosts. When venturing out at night, face north and sit. Strike the left teeth seven times, the right teeth five times, and the central teeth three times. Knock thrice upon the palace gates and recite the incantation to subdue ghosts and spirits.

**Incantation for the Six Palace Gates to Subdue Ghosts**
I am a disciple of the Supreme, governing the six heavens and six cavern-palaces below—these are my domains. Not only my domains, but also what the Supreme has begotten. I know the names of the six heavenly palace gates, and thus attain longevity. Should any dare to transgress, the Supreme shall slay you. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon reciting the incantation for the six palace gates, proceed to recite the Northern Culmen’s divine incantation.

**Incantation of the Northern Culmen to Subdue Demons**
*Zhou Jue* marks the imperial dawn,
*Liang Shi* meets the weighty *E*.
Flaming as smoke in the firmament,
Bursting like the radiance of blooming flowers.
*Wu Cheng* girds the divine blade,
*Tian Zhao* devours the clear river.
*Changhe* overlooks the cinnabar well,
*Yunmen* stands towering and steep.

*Lian Wan* spreads its demonic array.
The six heavens traverse the northern path—
This is the abode of ghosts and spirits.

Expel the *Qian* Toxin King, the Six Heavenly Ghost Kings.
*Shen Shi Luo Ling*, the Northern Culmen Demon King.
The four heavens gleam resplendently,
The *Fengdu* ghostly ministers.
*Ba Yuan Chou Bo*, the *Nine Heavens* Register.
Commanding the myriad ghosts—
Dare any disobey?
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon recitation, visualize the Great Marshal *Tianpeng* of the Northern Culmen: three heads and six arms, wielding a halberd, bow and arrows, sword, bell, battle-axe, and lasso; his body fifty *zhang* tall, clad in black robes, a dark crown, and golden armor, leading thirty-six myriad divine soldiers. Then strike the teeth thirty-six times and softly recite his incantation.

**Incantation of Marshal Tianpeng**
*Tianpeng, Tianpeng*, slayer of the Nine Primes’ youths.
The Five *Ding* Governors, *Gao Dao* of the north.
The Seven Governances and Eight Spirits,
The Supreme quells the fierce.
Long-skulled, giant-beast,
Wielding the imperial bell.
The Three White Owls, the Three Spirits,
Sternly driving the *Kui* dragons.
The divine king of the mighty sword,
Slays evil and eradicates traces.
Purple *qi* ascends the heavens,
Cinnabar clouds surge forth.
Devouring demons, consuming ghosts,
His body spans the winds.
Azure tongue, green teeth,
Four-eyed ancient elder.
Heavenly *Ding* warriors,
Warding the south against misfortune.
The heavenly couriers, fierce and swift,
Wielding blades in the north.
Three hundred myriad soldiers,
Guard my ninefold layers.
Expelling corpses a thousand *li* away,
Driving off inauspiciousness.
Should any petty ghost
Dare to appear,
The great axe of heaven
Shall sever the five forms of ghosts.
The fiery blood of the Flame Thearch,
The Northern Dipper burns their bones.
The Four Brightnesses shatter their remains,
The Heavenly Plan annihilates their kind.
One stroke of the divine blade—
The myriad ghosts scatter.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon recitation, proceed to the Great Fire Bell Incantation.

I am a minister of the Thearch,
My name inscribed in the Jade Clarity.
Below, I govern the six heavens and the Northern Culmen’s ghostly palaces—
All are my encampments, my domains.
What ghost dares arise?
To the right, I bear the *Huoluo*;
To the left, the Fire Bell.
Hurl fire ten thousand *li*,
Commanding the myriad spirits with awe.
Transgressors shall be executed,
Offenders shall be punished.
The Thearch’s decree—
Unceasing capture.
Heavenly light startles and stirs,
The demonic hordes bound in form.
Ghosts and demons exterminated,
I attain longevity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

When reciting this incantation, purify the heart and recite with tranquil focus, and the various divine officials of the Northern Culmen and Supreme Mystery shall descend to guard your body. A thousand calamities shall vanish, the demonic hordes shall be bound in form. Longevity and enduring vision shall be attained, and the fruition of immortality achieved.

This Northern Culmen wondrous register is a secret of the Northern Mystery, revered by the highest sages. Those who wear and receive it must set up an image of the Northern Culmen Perfected, and prepare the proper offerings. Each year, on the third day of the dragon’s movement, the fifth day of the horse’s halt, the seventh day of the monkey’s abode, the ninth day of the dog’s establishment, and on *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, they shall make offerings. Each morning, with a pure heart, recite the divine incantations. Upon completing ten thousand recitations, success may be expected. Whatever is enacted shall respond immediately, provided one’s devotion is sincere. Recite softly, for loud voices may startle the gods and spirits. Avoid birth and death impurities; if defiled, perform purification rites. Disciples must revere this.

The Orthodox Unity Perfected Person states: In the world, faithful men and women who wear and receive the Northern Culmen wondrous register, practicing in accordance with its methods, can crush and extinguish demonic perversities and subdue malevolent spirits. Acting on heaven’s behalf to transform, aiding the state and succoring the people, when their merit is complete, they shall transcend the world and attain long life, their names inscribed in the registers of immortals. Their seven generations of ancestors shall ascend, and they shall attain the rank of heavenly beings. Those who treat these secret texts with disdain shall bring calamity upon their ancestors. Disciples of the true way must strive diligently.

Disciple So-and-so, on this day, bearing the ritual offerings, respectfully approaches the gate of the Heavenly Master Perfected, to receive the register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register, first rank. After wearing and receiving it, I vow to abide by the precepts and covenants. Should I ever violate them, I willingly accept the jade statutes and dare not resent the Dao or blame my master.

In accordance with the mysterious statutes and divine decrees.

**Supplication Ritual for the Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register**

Supplication text for the Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register:

On this day of [year], [month], [day] in the [cyclical year], [disciple’s name], a devout believer of the Dao residing in [place of origin], declares: born on [year], [month], [day], [hour], my life is governed by the oversight of the [specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper.

Today, bearing the ritual offerings, I humbly approach the gate of the Celestial Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, successor of the Han, to receive the first-rank Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register, and vow to reverently cultivate its practice.

The Northern Culmen stands as the celestial symbol, governing the celestial administration within the Purple Tenuity. The Great Emperor resides at its center, radiating the vermilion scriptures upon the Jade Dipper. It annihilates demonic spirits and slays the lineages of evil. Commanding wind and thunder, it proclaims and executes its decrees. With each breath, it dispatches the Six Jia across the Six Heavens. Through incantations and gestures, it summons the ten thousand spirits within the ten thousand qi. Those who charge forth in battle number thirty-six generals. Those who escort and receive are a hundred billion, a thousandfold hosts. Its majesty and virtue defy description; its merits and achievements cannot be recounted. Should one violate its stern statutes, they willingly accept punishment from the netherworld. With steadfast resolve, I pledge to uphold and practice it, awaiting the master’s command.

Yet, I am unworthy—my earnest prayers know no bounds. Respectfully, I present this supplication at the gate of the Celestial Master.

Accordingly, disciple [name], bearing the ritual pledge, approaches the Dao to declare and seek the first-rank Register of the Supreme Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register. I further request the sacred names of the true masters, to be revered throughout my life.

As per the submitted supplication, on this day, I swear an oath before Heaven and Earth, pledge before the Three Officials, and break the tally to divide the ring. Following the statutes, the transmission is bestowed as follows:

**Register, First Rank**
The Register of the Supreme Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register.

**Sponsoring Masters:**

The Orthodox Master of the Celestial Master declares: The azure firmament coalesces qi, the Purple Ultimate scatters its radiance. Inscribed are the canonical words of the Four Poles, subduing the mighty power of all demonic forces. Those who lightly divulge or neglect these teachings invite calamity; those who receive them with reverence and diligence are blessed with auspiciousness. Neither hidden nor manifest is this principle transgressed—both humans and spirits alike depend upon it. Thus did the Most High establish the teachings, transmitting them as a worldly tradition. Through the ages, Perfected Masters and Teachers have upheld and propagated these sacred instructions, guiding those of karmic affinity in an unbroken lineage.

By ancestral fortune, I have borne the grace of the state through generations. I have inherited the title of Orthodox Unity Master and revived the ancestral lineage of Mount Tianmu. As the transmission of registers and scriptures has endured through the ages, I have now selected skilled artisans to carve wood into books, ensuring their teachings endure.

As for the precepts to be upheld: compassion and mercy have been the way of perfected beings since antiquity. All who ascend the altar as faithful devotees must first purify themselves. Through profound contemplation and accumulated practice, may their merits grow sufficient. All aspirations shall be fulfilled, and from this, they shall transcend the mundane and enter the wondrous. Clearly recorded in the covenant—how could one not be vigilant?

The Celestial Master’s Disciple of Vast Subtlety declares: For over one thousand five hundred years, my family has employed the talismans and registers of the Most High to deliver beings across heaven and earth, safeguarding the nation’s destiny. The ancestral instructions are luminously clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?

Yet when our former Perfected Lord encountered the sagely dynasty, the realm was unified, and our teachings were first honored. From the common folk of Jiangnan to the humble-clad, all were placed under our guidance. Since I inherited the teachings, across three imperial courts, I have repeatedly received the grace of imperial favor. At the ascension of the dragon-throne, a resplendent title was bestowed: my reverence was likened to that of the Vacant Tranquility Master, my solemnity compared to the harmony of the Serene Void. Official ranks and precedents were drawn from the Tang, while lands and enfeoffments were granted as in the Liu state.

In performing good deeds and transmitting the Dharma registers, I strive to uphold the ancestral legacy. In praying for blessings and averting calamities for the people, I reverently follow the sagely instructions. In beseeching Heaven for eternal mandate, how dare I not be diligent? Through the transmission of registers and talismans, the flowering of civilization is further illuminated. Above, I respond to the emperor’s illustrious mandate; below, I bestow upon the common people the supreme blessings of the Imperial Ultimate. May my sincerity in this age bring forth abundant fortune.

Here ends *The Register of the Northern Ultimate’s Subjugation of Demons, Divine Incantations, and Ghost-Slaying Talismans*.
