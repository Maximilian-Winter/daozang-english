**Ritual of the Outer Register of the Supreme Lord’s Orthodox Unity Scriptures**

All male and female masters shall establish altars, where nobles and commoners alike pay reverence and follow the proper procedures. Those who come to study must not treat the Dao lightly, for the weight of truth in their pursuit must be made clear. If a junior master has not yet established an altar or traversed among the people to propagate the teachings, they may act on their own, exempt from grand rituals. However, if they seek profit through street-corner methods, obscure the true canon, transmit errors through improper practice, and mislead later generations—who, in turn, grow shallow and careless, failing to seek lofty virtue but instead greedily accepting empty titles—then though they may hope for blessings, they will invite disaster. The deeper the transgression, the graver the retribution. Beware of this.

**Five Kinds of Women Receiving the Essential Register**

**1. The Maiden**
When a maiden remains at home under her parents’ care, they shall instruct her to follow a master and receive the teachings. The parents shall submit a petition on her behalf, declaring her as a local laywoman or layman’s daughter.

*"The layman [Father’s Name], residing in [Place], and his wife [Mother’s Name], humbly state: By the profound grace of the Dao, we were blessed with a child, our daughter [Name], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour]. Though she is young and unlearned, she harbors a sincere devotion to the Dao and seeks to advance in virtue. We now entrust her to your esteemed gate, beseeching your guidance to perfect her practice. In accordance with the ritual, we pledge our faith and present this petition, requesting that she receive the [Name] Register. May she cultivate in strict adherence to the teachings. We humbly pray that the enlightened master grant her this boon. Respectfully submitted."*

For those afflicted by illness or misfortune, the same ritual applies.

If a maiden receives the teachings at home and later marries, she shall inform her master. If the master is absent, a senior adept of the same tradition shall submit a written petition on her behalf, notifying the master that she has entered the household of [Husband’s Surname]. Upon joining her husband’s family, she shall inform him of her received teachings. The husband shall then notify his parents, who shall report to the master. Only her surname shall change; no alteration to the text is required. While at home, she is addressed by her father’s surname; after marriage, by her husband’s.

**2. The Ascetic Woman**
If a woman, by fate or inclination, does not wish to marry, she shall inform her parents and leave home to study the Dao. She may establish her own oratory or seek refuge under a master. A male master may not accept female disciples. If the master is a woman, she is addressed as "Master-Mother." Female disciples shall follow her guidance. If no Master-Mother is present, they shall rely on a female master. The female master, having left the household life, shall be of harmonious intent and steadfast devotion. The disciple shall receive the register in accordance with the ritual, submitting a petition as prescribed. If she is poor and lacks offerings, the master may provide them on her behalf.

The petition shall state:
*"The layman [Father’s Name], residing in [Place], declares: His daughter [Name], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour], has long borne the heavy karmic burden of being born a woman—frail, foolish, and stubborn. Unwilling to marry, she remained in her parents’ home, unable to pursue the teachings. Now, she vows to devote her life to the Dao and humbly seeks refuge under your esteemed gate. She pledges to serve with utmost sincerity, sweeping and tending to the altar for the rest of her days, maintaining the morning and evening incense and offerings without wavering or retreat. In accordance with the ritual, she presents this petition and her pledge. May the enlightened master grant her this boon and perfect her practice. Respectfully submitted."*

If she later regrets her vow, she shall face retribution. If she advances without regret, she may marry under separate regulations.

**3. The Married Woman**
A married woman faces many circumstances: she may be unwilling to marry but compelled by her elders; forced into marriage by powerful or worldly families; or bound by duty to serve her husband’s family, with or without devotion. If she has previously received the register, she shall return it to her master, who shall submit a petition on her behalf.

If her husband follows the Dao, she shall adopt his surname. If she has not yet received the register, she may receive it alongside her husband. If they share the same master but the master is distant, they may seek a senior adept and submit a petition as prescribed.

*"The layman [Husband’s Name], residing in [Place], and his wife [Name], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour], humbly state: By the accumulated merit of past lives, we have been privileged to serve the Great Dao. Though born weak as a woman, I have been fortunate to follow the Daoist community. If the adept’s household is of the highest virtue, we may declare ourselves disciples of the Daoist gate. With utmost sincerity, I pledge to serve diligently, sweeping and tending to the altar, upholding the Dao to prolong life, and praising the wondrous transformation. May I forever bear the mysterious protection and remain a seed of the Dao. In accordance with the ritual, I present this petition and my pledge, requesting to receive the [Name] Register. As I cultivate in word and deed, I humbly pray that the enlightened master grant this boon. Respectfully submitted."*

**4. The Widow**
Widows take many forms: some vow chastity upon their husband’s death and never remarry; others, though advanced in years, remain to raise their sons; some, elderly and childless, are too wealthy to leave; others, poor and unmarriageable, or ill and unable to depart, still possess property and do not return to their natal families. Such women may seek a master.

The petition shall state:
*"The deceased layman [Husband’s Name], formerly residing in [Place], and his wife [Name], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour], humbly state: Born weak as a woman, I have long borne deep defilement. Married to [Husband’s Name], I lived with him for [Number] years, months, and days. By the weight of past sins, calamity swiftly befell us. My husband, [Name], passed away on [Year, Month, Day, Hour] due to [Illness or Cause of Death]. Though I grieve, I dare not resent fate. Fearing that the deceased’s transgressions may bring misfortune to future generations, and mindful of my own accumulated faults, I cannot ensure my fate. Like the sparrow and mouse, I seek life through the Dao and humbly beseech your esteemed gate to deliver my body and spirit. In accordance with the ritual, I present this petition and my pledge, requesting to receive the [Name] Register. If my resolve remains steadfast, I humbly pray that the enlightened master grant this boon. Respectfully submitted."*

**5. The Returned Woman**
If a woman’s husband dies after marriage, or if she is divorced under the "Seven Grounds for Divorce" or due to incompatibility of fate, leaving her unable to support herself, she may return to her natal family. Burdened by sorrow, she may seek refuge under a master.

The petition shall follow the same form as that of a maiden, addressing her father as a local layman. If her marriage was harmonious and the bond of righteousness unbroken, but her husband’s death left her widowed and destitute, she may later be reburied with her husband if she passes. In such cases, the ritual follows that of a widow, with adjustments to the petition as circumstances require.

For those who are married, widowed, or returned women, all shall follow the rites of a married woman thereafter. In their petitions, they shall first state what has been previously described, then recount both auspicious and inauspicious circumstances in full—no omissions are permitted.

**4. Registers for Servants, Slaves, and the Four Barbarians**

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: If servants and slaves obey their masters, cultivate goodness, and attain virtue, they may be freed to become good and upright commoners. If good commoners persist in their studies, they may become virtuous persons; if virtuous persons persist, they may become sages; if sages persist, they may become Daoists; if Daoists persist, they may become immortals; if immortals persist, they may become perfected beings; if perfected beings persist, they may become great divine persons; if great divine persons persist, they may become Dark-Commissioned Divine Persons. These nine ranks ascend to the pinnacle of the Dao. Even the lowest of the low may study the Dao. If they follow the teachings of the virtuous and receive registers in accordance with the law, they shall address their master as a local layman, stating their master’s name, their own name, and—if granted a surname—their surname. They shall declare their age, birth month, day, and hour, and whether they were born into servitude among the Man, Mo, Di, or Qiang tribes, speaking truthfully in all matters. Kneeling and bowing, they shall present their petition, first confessing their deep sins. In this lowly life, they have endured both bitterness and sweetness, never daring to complain. Now, by the fortune of insects and grasses, they have found refuge in the Daoist gate, hearing and witnessing good deeds with sincere joy. Though base and foolish, they feign understanding and caution, striving diligently day and night, ever mindful and never lax. Longing to live and wishing to thrive, they serve their master and obey their household, hoping for the Dao’s protection and seeking respite. They perform their duties—sweeping, cleaning, and tending to the master’s gifts—sharing what they receive, exchanging incense and oil, and managing the offerings. Now, they present their pledge of faith and request to receive the talismanic registers. They humbly pray that the enlightened master grant their plea.

The petition of the Four Barbarians shall state: "From the wilds of the east, west, south, or north, or from within the mountains and rivers of a certain prefecture, commandery, or county, I, a barbarian of the Yi, Di, Qiang, or Rong tribes, now reside in such-and-such a place. I have taken the surname so-and-so and the name so-and-so. Born on such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, I kneel and bow to present this petition. Formerly, due to my ugliness and wickedness, I was born in the borderlands, ignorant of rites and propriety, unaware of moral principles. Amidst filth and defilement, my good roots were not severed. In such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, for such-and-such a reason, I came to the Central Kingdom. Upon hearing the Daoist teachings, my joy redoubled. Longing to live and clinging to truth, I humbly seek life. In accordance with the law, I present my pledge of faith and submit this petition, praying that the enlightened master grant my request."

After servants and slaves receive their registers, they shall be listed in a separate white register, which the master shall seal. Upon making three reports to the higher authorities, they may attend assemblies and listen to teachings. Those who have accumulated merit and virtue shall be released by the virtuous and treated as good commoners.

**Thanksgiving Petition Three Days After Receiving the Register**

Three days after receiving the register—counting the day of receipt as the first—on the third day (for example, if received on the tenth, the third day would be the twelfth), the recipient shall go before the master, bow twice, kneel, and kowtow three times. Rising, they shall bow twice more, then present their pledge and request the thanksgiving petition. The petition should be written by the recipient themselves; if unable, they may have another write it in accordance with the same method, but they must still bow and submit it themselves. If even this is impossible, a fellow disciple or the master may do so on their behalf. The one acting in their stead shall perform the incense rites, invoke the officials, present the petition, and conclude the incense rites, following all prescribed procedures. The recipient shall wait outside the oratory, bowing and prostrating as the master invokes the officials. The master shall call the recipient’s name, instructing them to click their teeth and swallow qi. If a fellow disciple presents the petition, the recipient shall stand with them, clicking their teeth, bowing, prostrating, and swallowing qi as the disciple does.

The fellow disciple shall instruct them in what to say.

**Thanksgiving Petition for Receiving the Seventy-Five and One Hundred Fifty Registers**

Your subordinate, [Name], of such-and-such a rank, in awe and reverence, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses the following:

According to the records, in such-and-such a year, moved by the joy of transformation, I was placed under the Dao-qi of the various Lords and Masters. Fond of the Dao and delighting in the divine, I previously approached the Celestial Master, the Libationer [Name], and received the register of the Seventy-Five Generals. Over the years, I have failed to render even the slightest merit in return for what I have received. Yet on such-and-such a day of this month, by the grace of the Celestial Master of such-and-such a oratory and qi, I was summoned for examination and bestowed the register of the Seventy-Five Generals, along with the register of the One Hundred Fifty Generals. Overwhelmed by this great kindness, I am filled with both joy and fear. The profound bestowal is vast and deep; I am truly inspired to advance. I humbly present this petition to the Heavenly Offices, praying for your compassionate consideration.

I, along with the officials and clerks who summoned me, and the Seventy-Five Generals of the register I previously received—whose soldiers and guards have diligently protected me—now humbly request that their merits be reported and their ranks promoted, in accordance with the usual procedures of the Heavenly Offices. All shall be recorded in the registers and their hidden duties assigned, ensuring no oversight. Once the matters are concluded, each shall return to their respective offices as before.

Late-born and slow to mature, I have been fortunate to encounter this great transformation, though I remain ignorant of right and wrong. My past transgressions are many. Today, I vow to reform my past and cultivate my future, gradually refining myself with diligence. I beg that all my former and present offenses be pardoned and absolved. Henceforth, may all I face—metal and stone—yield before me, and water and fire be extinguished. May the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits all submit and obey. May what I transform be transformed, and what I heal be healed. By this great kindness, may the yet unawakened be encouraged.

I implore the Most High to distinguish and pity my foolishness. Through the Two Officials, the Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Divine Clerks, the Chariot-Riding Red Talisman Clerks, the Just Wind Courier Clerks, and the Post-Horse Petition-Carrying Officials—two of each—I humbly dispatch this petition on behalf of [Names], presenting one document to the Three Heavens and such-and-such a Heavenly Office. I await your response.

Your subordinate, [Name], in awe and reverence, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this.

Your subordinate [Name], of [such-and-such] Abbey, conducting the rites of purification by fire,

In the reign year [Year], in the cyclical year [X], on the [Day] of the [Month], at the hour of [Time], presents this document at the Yellow Register Retreat Altar in [Location], humbly submitting it.

To the Gate of the Three Heavens, for transmission:

The youth Chao, having received the Ten Sincerities and the Register of the Seventy-Five Generals, presents this document in gratitude.

Petition states: According to the records, born in the year [Year], in the cyclical year [X], on the [Day] of the [Month], at the hour of [Time], by the grace of accumulated virtue, my family has long revered the Great Dao. Having encountered profound protection, I have heard and witnessed the Orthodox Dharma, its wondrous methods and rare arts. With the aspiration to cultivate and practice, though my age and understanding were yet immature, I was unable to receive instruction. Yet, moved by my teacher’s compassion, I was granted the honor of advancement, my darkness dispelled, my ignorance guided, and led onto the path illuminated by the sun. On the [Day] of this month, my master [Name], in accordance with the statutes, examined and summoned me, conferring upon me the rank of [such-and-such] Official and [such-and-such] General’s Register. Overwhelmed by this vast kindness, I bow in awe and reverence, filled with astonishment and joy. I humbly present this document in gratitude.

I earnestly pray that the Officiants of the Three Heavens and the Upper Bureaus may review my petition. Having been examined and summoned, may the true qi of the General’s officers, soldiers, and divine spirits be summoned to enter my body, uniting hearts and joining forces to establish virtue and accomplish merit. May my good karma advance, and may I perfect my cultivation as a seed-person. For those who achieve merit in the celestial offices, may they be recommended for promotion, their ranks elevated according to the statutes of the Heavenly Bureaus. May they be appointed to concealed positions without disappointment. Once their tasks are complete, may they return to their original posts, all in accordance with precedent. May my heart be enlightened and my intentions resolved, my movements and stillness aligned with the true. May the hidden and manifest submit and obey, serving as proof of my sincerity.

I implore the Most High. [And so forth.]

A Memorial on the Promotion of a Perfected One to the Rank of One Hundred Fifty Generals, Reporting Meritorious Service:

With reverence, I examine the records: [So-and-so], born in the year, month, day, and hour of [such-and-such], possessed good karmic roots from past lives and served the Great Dao through generations. Though newly transformed like clouds, their past transgressions were grave, having long served the Six Heavens. Whether awakened to true faith or lacking devotion, their good affinity with the Dao remained unbroken, allowing them to return to the Orthodox Unity.

Devoted to the Dao and delighting in the spirits, their sincerity was unwavering. Truly aspiring to advance, they dared to petition for promotion beyond their rank. Unaware that their past blessings were abundant and their master’s grace profound, they were lifted from the ranks of the turbid and defiled to join the company of the pure and cloud-borne. Granted the method to elevate the multitude and placed in a position beyond their station, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, the master [name], male or female, in accordance with the statutes, summoned and appointed [so-and-so] as Recorder of the One Hundred Fifty Generals, along with their officers and soldiers. Their glory illumined the Celestial Palace, their majesty aided the upright and eradicated the perverse. Both hidden and manifest submitted in reverence—how could one such as I, a mere blade of grass, ever be worthy? Overwhelmed with gratitude and trepidation, I bow and present this memorial in thanks.

I humbly implore the Three Heavenly Bureaus to deign to review my petition for the summoning of my lord, along with the generals, recorders, officers, and soldiers I have received. For those who have rendered meritorious service in their protection, I now petition for their promotion and advancement, each to be elevated in rank according to the statutes of the Heavenly Bureaus. May they be appointed to concealed positions without disappointment, and once their duties are complete, may they return to their original posts, all in accordance with precedent. Before receiving this register, my countless transgressions and myriad faults—from this day forward, I beg for their complete absolution. May I, from this moment on, cause metal and stone to yield, water and fire to subside, and the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits to submit and obey. May all I transform be transformed, all I govern be healed. Having received such great favor, may I encourage those who have yet to awaken.

I implore the Most High. [And so forth.]

**Memorial of Register and Petition for Promotion**

[State] Prefecture, [County] District, [Township] Village: [Name], male or female, of [age] years, summoned by [such-and-such] office. Household head: [Name], male or female. Presiding master: [Name], male or female.

**Letter of Recommendation**
The undersigned certifies that [Name], male or female, having previously received the register of [such-and-such] office, [number] generals, officers, and soldiers, has upheld the precepts and cultivated the true. Deemed capable of advancement, they now seek promotion and appointment to the register of [such-and-such] office, [number] generals, officers, and soldiers. As prescribed by the statutes, this petition is respectfully submitted.

Sealed by the Celestial Master [Name], Qi Festival Officer, your servant [Name] bows twice and presents this petition.

As stated in the memorial: [Name], male or female, having previously received the register of [such-and-such] office, [number] generals, officers, and soldiers, has cultivated with precision and is deemed capable of advancement. Now seeking promotion to the register of [such-and-such] office, [number] generals, officers, and soldiers, I respectfully detail their conduct. [State] Prefecture, [County] District, [Township] Village: [Name], of [age] years. The number and type of generals requested for promotion, the presiding Celestial Master, and the recommending parties are as listed in the memorial. I humbly dispatch the Merit Officer Messenger, the Summoning Lord’s Officers, and the Examiners of the Flesh-Bound to verify the truth of these matters. If [Name] proves a worthy candidate, may the appointment be granted without delay. The flesh-bound, awaiting their commission, must receive their new rank. I petition the superior offices with this memorial.

Your servant [Name], trembling with awe, bows twice and presents this to the Summoning Lord.

Your servant, [Surname] [Name], respectfully submits this memorial to the Four Lords.

Having carefully reviewed the documents, I record the names and ages of the male and female initiates. Previously appointed to [such-and-such] office with [number] generals, officers, and soldiers, they now seek promotion to [number] generals, officers, and soldiers as requested in the register. The memorial submitted yesterday, as listed in the documents, awaits their commission. All those due for promotion shall receive their new ranks without delay. The generals, officers, and soldiers who have protected the flesh-bound with merit shall all be returned to the Central Palace. Their merits shall be reported, and promotions with corresponding rank increases shall be granted according to the standard regulations of the Celestial Bureau, as verified by the Summoning Lord’s Officers.

The newly appointed generals, officers, and soldiers shall be assigned to the flesh-bound for their protection and oversight. By the grace of the Most High, [text continues as per convention].

The register and memorial documents shall be presented, and the official procedures for transmission shall follow the previous rites. The exchange shall be conducted with solemnity, as in the initial method. For those who have received registers under the same master, no additional rice or firewood is required—only paper, brushes, and the like as before. For those under different masters, the customary offerings must not be diminished.

For those who receive further registers:
- Every five years, one may advance by one general.
- Every four years, one may advance by ten generals.
- Every three years, one may advance by seventy-five generals.
- Every two years, one may advance by one hundred fifty generals.
- For those of mediocre conduct or lacking progress in a single year, the waiting period shall be doubled. Those who fail threefold shall remain in their current rank without promotion, their merit unrecognized. However, those of exceptional intelligence, talent, or surpassing virtue and merit may advance without regard to time limits.

The method of maintaining the register and observing the precepts requires constant awareness of one’s office, rank, and the number of subordinates—both civil and military. In emergencies, the summoning text must be kept on one’s person. If the register is to be engraved or transcribed, it may be temporarily removed, but it must not be lost or misplaced, lest penalties be incurred. If damaged or altered, it shall be repaired according to proper method.

For husband and wife who share the Dao, this is not considered licentiousness. The register must be worn and preserved without removal; to remove it is to invite impurity and incur severe penalties. When entering places of misfortune, mourning, danger, or ghostly peril, the register must never be removed. The spirits shall enter the body, not merely remain above. The register and talisman must be kept on the person, the master held in the heart, and loyalty and faith thereby strengthened.

In cases of mourning, childbirth, or contact with impurity, the register shall be temporarily set aside, in accordance with the Most High’s secret teachings.

All Daoist followers shall first receive the protective talisman, the Three Precepts, then advance to the Five Precepts and Eight Precepts before receiving the register. If any precepts were not received prior to the register, they shall be received afterward in proper sequence. They shall be recited and practiced diligently, with constant mindfulness. Errors in recitation or forgetfulness shall be considered violations. Before receiving the register, no spirits may be summoned. After receiving it, spirits may be called in both movement and stillness. Those who fail to observe the precepts shall find their summons unanswered. Those who break the precepts shall find their officers and soldiers distant, and their cases shall be reported to the Celestial Bureau for investigation, leading to misfortune, illness, public and private calamities, decline, and failure in all endeavors. Success, virtue, and the transition from darkness to light depend on observing the precepts. The gods shall then protect them.

The precepts are detailed in separate texts and must be studied and practiced with care. If there are misunderstandings, omissions, errors, deliberate violations, coercion by superiors, or fear-driven transgressions, all are considered faults and constitute breaking the precepts. Immediate repentance and renewal are required, as outlined below.

Those who violate the precepts by bearing false witness, aligning with heterodox teachings, or engaging in worldly affairs are deemed insincere, their hearts divided. If, after three admonishments from the master, they do not reform and remain steadfast in the One without doubt, their summons shall be effective. If they persist in defiance after three admonishments, they are deemed traitors to the Dao, disobedient to their master, and subject to the revocation of their register. Those who abandon the true for the mundane or neglect their duties shall be treated with compassion by the master, who shall not pursue blame. However, if they harbor resentment, act against others, or abandon the root for the branch, though they may nominally follow the Dao, they violate its true principles. The master shall report them to the authorities, who shall not tolerate them. If, after time, they repent and perform extraordinary merit, they may petition for reinstatement and be promoted according to their virtue.

If they remain resentful and refuse to surrender their register, the master shall not press them but merely report the matter. Those who commit crimes punishable by death or corporal punishment under secular law are deemed to have betrayed the Dao and shall have their registers revoked, be flogged, fined, or penalized. Their cases shall be reported for resolution. If the punishment is unjust, they may appeal and retain their register.

For internal violations of the precepts under the jurisdiction of the unseen authorities, the master and fellow disciples shall admonish them. If they persist in wrongdoing, their registers shall be revoked. The severity shall be assessed, and the master and peers shall deliberate to ensure fairness. Both seen and unseen authorities shall be informed. Masters and disciples who break the precepts or act improperly shall share the same punishment. After revocation, if they repent and perform merit, they may be reinstated and promoted according to the regulations.

Those who lose their register shall be penalized and required to receive it anew.

For those who lose or alter their register, the penalty shall be five bundles of firewood, three *liang* of cinnabar, and a feast for three worthy individuals—all to be provided by the central kitchen.

Should one lose a General’s register, the penalty shall be half a cartload of firewood, four *liang* of cinnabar, and a feast for five worthy individuals. Should one lose the registers of ten Generals, the penalty shall be one cartload of firewood, five *liang* of cinnabar, and a feast for ten worthy individuals. Should one lose the registers of seventy-five Generals, the penalty shall be two cartloads of firewood, seven *liang* of cinnabar, and a feast for fifty worthy individuals. Should one lose the registers of one hundred fifty Generals, the penalty shall be three cartloads of firewood, nine *liang* of cinnabar, and a feast for one hundred worthy individuals. For the loss of registers from Three Officials to one hundred fifty Generals, all penalties shall be paid in full. Only after the penalty is fulfilled may one receive the register anew, and advancement shall follow merit. If one possesses extraordinary merit or exceptional virtue, promotion may be granted at the master’s discretion.

All penalties paid, petitions submitted, and pledges made shall proceed as before.

**Establishing Merit to Seek Advancement**
All who aspire to learn must follow a master, uphold the precepts, cultivate conduct, establish merit, and build virtue. Virtue comprises the Five Virtues, and merit comprises the Nine Merits.

The Five Virtues are:
1. **Benevolence (仁)**: Cherishing life and abhorring killing;
2. **Propriety (礼)**: Reverence, caution, harmony, and gentleness;
3. **Sincerity (信)**: Loyalty, uprightness, and absence of deceit;
4. **Righteousness (义)**: Clarity in judgment and freedom from perversity;
5. **Wisdom (智)**: Purity, uprightness, and penetrating insight.

The Nine Merits are:
1. Governing the primordial darkness, aspiring to formlessness;
2. Governing the Upper Heavens, setting one’s mind on the Great Spirits;
3. Governing the Lower Earth, maintaining stillness and contemplating the Real;
4. Governing the Four Seasons, aligning with the transformations of immortality;
5. Governing the Five Phases, propagating the Great Dao;
6. Governing yin and yang, continuing the sacred lineage;
7. Governing texts and writings, aiding in the propagation of the Dao and its laws;
8. Governing grains and herbs, sustaining the lives of the common people;
9. Governing wealth and goods, benefiting the lowly and connecting with the exalted.

These Nine Merits and Five Virtues are fully expounded in the scriptures. One must be familiar with the texts, receive oral instructions, and act in accordance with the established procedures. With steadfast diligence and an unyielding resolve, one establishes merit. Merit manifests externally, while virtue fills the interior. Though inner and outer differ, merit and virtue unite. Those who possess virtue and establish merit may seek advancement in their practice. Petitions should align with the occasion, and the general outline is as follows:

*[Petition for Advancement]*
From [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village], [male/female] disciple [Name], aged [Age], prostrates and humbly petitions for favor. By the grace of good fortune, I have reverently upheld the Great Law. On the [Day] of [Month], [Year], under the guidance of my master (or another master, or the master of [male/female] disciple [Name] from [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village]), I was granted the register of [Official Title]. Since receiving the Law, I have practiced for [X] years and [X] months, adhering to the oral instructions and following the precepts. I have submitted to the discipline and dared not violate or betray it. Yet, in my foolishness and ignorance, I may have unknowingly transgressed. With limited ability, my cultivation remains incomplete. Reflecting on this, I am ashamed and have forgotten sleep and food. Assessing my mediocrity, I recognize my slow comprehension. From [Day] of [Month], [Year], I have practiced [specific practice], and to this day, I have seen some small results. My merit is slight, and my achievement shallow; I dare not rest idle. Humbly, I seek even the smallest advancement to reward my humble efforts. I respectfully submit the required pledges and humbly present this petition. May my enlightened master deign to grant me success. I fear to defile your profound gaze and submit this with trepidation.

Respectfully submitted on the [Day] of [Month] in the year of [Tai Sui].

The Five Virtues and Nine Merits each have their own scriptural methods, which encompass both inner and outer practices. The learner must cultivate both. Benevolence, propriety, sincerity, righteousness, and wisdom, along with the various governing principles, are inwardly concealed in the heart and outwardly manifest in conduct. Near and far, heart and technique, they alternately assume different names. Metal, wood, fire, water, earth, and grain are called the Six Treasuries of Upright Virtue. Benefiting the people, aiding governance, and enriching life are called the Three Affairs. The Three Affairs and Six Treasuries are also known as the Nine Merits. The Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, culture, martiality, eloquence, and law—these are the Nine Classics. Within the Nine Classics, merit and virtue are complete. The term "merit and virtue" is a general designation for goodness. Among these, the Three Techniques are essential: concealing one’s form, hiding one’s name, and relinquishing honor. Inwardly, one relies on the knowledge of the heart; outwardly, one employs near discernment. Discernment in proximity involves action, and action constitutes endeavor. Endeavor pertains to active engagement, while the heart abides in non-action. Simplicity and plainness are valued, and extravagance is discarded, aiming for non-action. The path of simplicity and plainness begins with body and speech and culminates in the restraint of the heart. One initiates the cultivation of the Five Virtues and Nine Merits.

**The Five Virtues:**
1. Maintaining a long-term vegan fast, abstaining from rich and fresh foods, releasing living beings, saving the dying, and maintaining an equanimous mind.
2. Making offerings to the Three Treasures, prostrating with utmost devotion, serving with harmony and compliance, and avoiding arrogance.
3. Speaking truthfully without deceit, acting with expedient means in accordance with the Law, and not harming others for personal gain.
4. Distinguishing right from wrong, consulting masters and fellow practitioners, practicing equitable giving, and severing doubts and perversities.
5. Cultivating wisdom with precision, speaking in accordance with the scriptures, comprehending the scriptures without obstruction, and aligning movement and stillness with the Dao—never acting contrary to the unseen and seen authorities.

**The Nine Merits:**
1. Encouraging fellow practitioners to contemplate the formless body, reflecting on its purity and entrusting *qi* to formlessness.
2. Guarding the body’s emptiness and purity, flawless as jade.
3. Accumulating essence and practicing inner visualization, repeatedly cultivating to fulfillment.
4. Contemplating the spirits of the five viscera, seeing and communicating with them.
5. Summoning the body’s spirits to command the four seasons and five phases.
6. Offering to the Six Jia and Eight Officials, inscribing talismans to summon earth spirits.
7. Commanding the spirits of altars, mountains, rivers, and the multitude.
8. Practicing the extension of essence and *qi*, divining and discerning right and wrong.
9. Summoning ghosts to inquire about fortune and misfortune.

The above Five Virtues and Nine Merits may be practiced according to one’s ability. Those who can practice them are collectively called "meritorious." Merit is work, and work is ability. The ability to save the world, assist the state, support life, benefit beings, and sustain oneself brings rewards in both the unseen and seen realms. From the Sixth Merit to the Ninth, the practices often verge on the heterodox. Without strict adherence to the precepts, one will inevitably fall into demonic company. These three stages of the Dao’s lower grade are perilous; caution is paramount. Those who excel may seek advancement, and the petition is briefly outlined as follows.

**Selecting the Worthy and Recommending the Virtuous**
Masters assess disciples, calculating merit to offset transgressions. Minor faults may be forgiven, while great virtues should be commended. In establishing merit and virtue, the Five and Nine harmonize. The Nine Classics and Three Guards each have their strengths. Those who cultivate these practices vary in capacity—some grand, some modest. The weak and humble may be assigned to menial tasks, such as carrying firewood or drawing water, contributing labor according to their ability. Those of middling capacity may serve as attendants, dusting and cleaning, tending the courtyard, arranging incense and lamps, grinding ink, or translating languages. Those of great capacity, possessing wealth, status, and influence, may propagate the sagely transformation, turning evil to good and guiding others to the master’s gate. Such meritorious efforts move both the unseen and seen realms. Even if they do not seek advancement, the master should recommend them. Promotion in register need not follow the usual time limits; some may be advanced directly or granted additional protocols from the master’s case. If one is truly worthy and capable of wielding the brush, they may be recommended as a scribe. The petition is as follows.

A male or female disciple from [such-and-such] prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, named [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years, styled [so-and-so], born on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month.

The aforementioned individual, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month and year at [such-and-such] hour, having followed this servant or master—male or female official, libationer, or Daoist named [so-and-so]—received the register of [such-and-such] office, diligently served at the oratory, and labored for [such-and-such] years and months. To the Most Mysterious Capital, the Orthodox Unity, and the Balanced Qi of the Celestial Master of [such-and-such] Oratory, Libationer [so-and-so], this servant kowtows, prostrates, and humbly submits:

Upon examining the documents, it is found that the aforementioned disciple, devoted to the Dao and diligently cultivating virtue, has established meritorious deeds in propagating the Dao and advancing virtue. Such efforts merit prominent recognition. Already, immortal officials and divine soldiers have been assigned to protect them. Not clinging to humble life nor coveting worldly existence, they yearn for the pure transformation of the Dao, studying its arts and excelling in calligraphy and painting. Their talent and understanding are bright and penetrating. They seek to serve as a scribe, assisting in the governance of qi for the times. This servant vows that after three years of purifying their heart and testing their service at this oratory, if they lead ten or more households, one scribe shall be appointed; fifty or more households, two scribes; three hundred or more households, four scribes; five hundred or more households, eight scribes; one thousand or more households, twelve scribes; and for two thousand or more households, the number shall increase proportionally.

This servant now oversees [such-and-such] households and, according to the regulations, should appoint [such-and-such] scribes. Yet those who perceive the truth are rare, and those capable of service are few. Having searched for the loyal and worthy, this servant now appoints the aforementioned disciple from [such-and-such] village, [so-and-so], to fill the vacancy. Should there be no suitable candidate, or if the position remains unfilled, this servant requests that those who harbor a love for the Dao and wish to serve may come forward to be considered in succession.

May the Most High Lords, Perfected Ones, and Celestial Master, with the Dao and qi, shelter this servant and the aforementioned disciple, granting clarity of perception and awakening of the heart-mind in their duties. May they not be swayed by the mundane but instead behold the immortal secrets. This servant and the disciple shall dedicate their hearts and exert their utmost efforts in service to the Most High, ensuring no negligence. Upon reviewing their conduct and deeds, and after the completion of their vowed term, if they prove capable of governing the people, this servant shall separately recommend them for promotion. On the day of their appointment as libationer, they shall submit a new memorial.

O humble and earnest one, may the Dao and qi flow forth in mercy! May transgressions and faults be pardoned. This servant, overwhelmed by such grace, respectfully submits this memorial for consideration. May the celestial clerks examine and approve it. With reverence to the Most High—thus and so forth.

The memorial for the appointment of scribes is hereby concluded. The scribe shall present the memorial and, upon its completion, perform nine prostrations. The preceding rites of gratitude to the master shall follow the usual protocol for scribes. Three months after the appointment, their merits shall be recorded in accordance with the register of disciples.

**Commendation and Humility**

Disciples appointed as scribes or register-holders who possess keen understanding and natural affinity for the truth may first cultivate *dispersed qi*. Those who cultivate *dispersed qi* are young boys and girls who inquire into the methods of generating life-sustaining qi and the principles of immortality. Once they grasp the fundamentals, they advance to *dispersed transformation*. Those who achieve *dispersed transformation* receive the register of One General and are titled *Dispersed Qi Youths* (male or female). Libationers receive the register of Ten Generals and are titled *Dispersed Officials Preserving Qi*. Those with seventy-five registers are titled *Dispersed Officials Upholding Qi*, and those with one hundred fifty registers are titled *Dawn Qi Libationers*. All perform talismanic water rites, instruct the people, submit memorials, save the living, and rescue the dying. Converting three individuals counts as one merit; three merits as one diligent effort; three diligent efforts as one meritorious deed. Those who achieve meritorious deeds are deemed virtuous and may be appointed to oversee the stellar constellations within and beyond the oratory. Such appointments follow in sequence. Those with meritorious virtue shall be commended by their masters and peers. The memorial is as follows:

In the [such-and-such] year of the reign of [such-and-such] dynasty, in the [such-and-such] month of the year of [such-and-such] Jupiter station, the Celestial Master of [such-and-such] Oratory, Libationer [so-and-so], kowtows, prostrates, and humbly submits:

To the Celestial Master’s disciples, I have heard that the Great Dao responds to transformation, guiding the virtuous. The wondrous Dharma must be upheld by capable individuals. Those with talent who wield the law bring affairs to fruition, bestowing grace upon the living and benefiting both the seen and unseen realms. I have observed that in [such-and-such] prefecture, commandery, county, and village, the male or female disciple [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years, styled [so-and-so], possesses a profound nature, mastered the classics in youth, and upholds precepts with strictness. In affairs, they are fair and just, firm yet yielding, decisive yet discerning. Their demeanor is lofty and bright, inspiring awe in both humans and spirits. Truly, they are a fine talent for propagating the Dao and a worthy exemplar for the times. Unshaken by slander, unmoved by praise, they cultivate virtue in seclusion yet excel in public service. They are fit to advance the true transformation and encourage later worthies.

Having served in their current post for several years, they are due for promotion. Personally overseeing the orthodox transformation, I, your humble disciple, venture to present my sincere plea. Though my words may be unworthy, I trust they will not be dismissed. The merits I extol await your gracious approval. I kowtow repeatedly, prostrating in utmost reverence.

Should the master’s teaching deem the recommendation worthy and timely, I urge the immediate execution of this decree. Upon its issuance, the response of humility is as follows:

The register-holding male or female disciple [so-and-so], overwhelmed with awe, respectfully addresses the male or female official [so-and-so]:

The commendation in the memorial is mistaken, and the sagely decree is undeserved. I am struck with astonishment, my heart and form trembling. Fortunate to have encountered this wondrous transformation, I am overwhelmed by grace. I aspire only to dedicate myself wholeheartedly to cultivation, fearing the shame of failing to meet expectations. I dare not hope for promotion. The teaching permits me to remain in my current station, and the Dharma opens the way to serve the times. Though I venture to express my sincerity, my reasoning is flawed by humility. I beseech your exalted compassion to revoke this decree and grant my humble request, sparing me from presumption. May I avoid the fault of forgetting favor and preserve the integrity of my modest truth. Overjoyed by this mercy, I dare not profane your dignity. I am truly overwhelmed, kowtowing repeatedly in reverence.

The [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the year of [such-and-such] Jupiter station.

The master’s teaching seeks the worthy and thirsts for talent. The consensus of the assembly shall not be opposed. Humility should be set aside. The master’s command and the peers’ recommendation must be heeded. One shall not shrink from labor nor rejoice in ease. If unworthy, or if one’s aspirations lie elsewhere, they may freely state their case.

Should one decline, it may be done no more than thrice.

**Chapter on Excessive Dispersal of Qi**

[State], [Prefecture], [County], [Village]: Male/female [name], age [years]. If a child, the parents shall petition the master on their behalf. If husband and wife, both shall receive the teaching together; neither may attend alone.

[Name] states: My nature is upright, my aspirations align with loyalty and simplicity, my heart yearns for longevity, and my conduct is earnest and sincere. Pure and void, truthful and steadfast, I am fit to receive the Central Perfection and ascend gradually according to the statutes. I humbly request to receive the dispersal of qi.

[Date]. Male/female, [official title], [name].

The above five persons are hereby recommended.

Petition: With reverence, I examine the documents. Though I, your humble servant, am dull-witted and lacking in methods of propagation, I strive with utmost sincerity to aid the aged master. Yet my transgressions are many and my merits few; I constantly fear peril and downfall. Your great compassion, vast and all-embracing, has spared my life. I vow to exert what little effort I can, aspiring to follow the August Ultimate. In accordance with the Dao, I seek the worthy and propagate the upright qi.

Petition: The male/female [official title], [name], born into a wandering and degenerate world, has nonetheless purified themselves and preserved their truth, desiring to delight in the pure and mysterious. Their innate understanding has led them to inquire of the master regarding the methods of extending life and the principles of primordial existence. Their sincerity is written in crimson; their devotion is reflected in their shadow. I, your servant, deem the mysteries of the Dao most profound and its methods most weighty. Yet the foolish and vulgar remain deluded, and few devote themselves to cultivation. [Name] now places their faith wholeheartedly, their resolve unshaken. I humbly beseech the August Ultimate to heed their plea. I hereby declare the true teachings of yin and yang: the union of husband and wife is the essence of the seed-people. Through the cycles of three, five, seven, and nine, they shall transcend one another, together exiting the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Three Clarities. I respectfully request the Lords of Qi-Dispersal and Dao-Conferral, the Nine Qi Venerable, the Lords of Disaster-Dispelling and Calamity-Resolving, the Generals of Misfortune-Dissolving, and the Examiners of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water to descend as one into [name]’s body, governing within and without, dispelling harm, pacifying the hun and po souls, severing the Three Worms, and nurturing the Mysterious Root. I further dispatch the two yin-yang spirit officials from among my retinue to ascend to the Jade Calendar of the Grand Clarity’s Immortal Capital, inscribing [name]’s name in the Register of Life and erasing it from the Ledger of Death. May [name] attain long life and lasting vision, forever becoming one of the seed-people. As a token of sincerity, I offer a single unlined garment. I beg that all the thousand sins and myriad transgressions committed before embracing the Dao be fully absolved. Such grace belongs only to the Most High.

As is customary, your servant [name] bows and presents this petition on behalf of the male/female [official title], [name], requesting the official dispersal of qi.

The rites for the dispersal of qi follow the Central Method’s protocol for summoning officials, as recorded in a separate scroll.

All who receive the dispersal of qi must transcribe and study the Twenty-Four Scrolls, cultivate visualization, and prepare the Central Petitions for invocation. Until one’s true qi is fully realized, they may not serve as a master.

**Repentance for Transgressions**

For any transgression resulting in the revocation of talismans or registers, or their loss, one must submit a petition of repentance and apology, generally as follows:

[State], [Prefecture], [County], [Village]: Male/female [name], age [years], prostrates and knocks their head to the ground, begging forgiveness and mercy.

I, [name], a mere blade of grass, have presumptuously encountered the great transformation. I beg for your compassionate nurturance and the gift of life’s essence. On [date], I received the register of [name], but in my actions, I violated the statutes and incurred divine scrutiny. On [date] at [time], in the matter of [event], I offended public or private affairs, transgressing against the Three Honored Ones. By the master’s command, my disciples have revoked the talisman of [name] I wore. Or, on [date] at [time], in [location], during [event], I lost the talisman of [name] I wore. I confess this truthfully, taking full responsibility. Even if I were to die, it would be no recompense—like sparing a sparrow or mouse, I dare to beg for the mercy of renewal. I vow to cleanse my heart and innards, hoping for the grace of revival. I shall reform my past and cultivate my future, never again repeating my former ways. I humbly beseech your mysterious compassion to grant a great pardon, allowing these withered bones to regrow flesh, these dried roots to sprout anew. With reverence, I submit to the statutes and offer restitution as prescribed. May your boundless mercy forgive me, and may I, though indebted, live on. Overwhelmed by your purity and majesty, I am drenched in sweat and trembling. I respectfully submit this petition.

[Date] at [time], the petition is presented.

After receiving the petition, the master shall assess the severity of the transgression and, in accordance with the statutes, report it to the higher authorities. The talisman or register shall be reissued as appropriate. For three losses or three transgressions, one may not receive again. For extraordinary merits and exceptional virtues, one must wait twenty-five years before being eligible to receive anew.

Extraordinary merits and exceptional virtues cannot be fully enumerated. To summarize broadly: one may follow the examples and apply them accordingly. Such merits include: employing talent to benefit the world, using civil and martial arts to rectify the times, establishing governance and abodes, propagating the Dao’s influence, transforming evil into good, upholding justice and eliminating wickedness, dedicating one’s nation or family to the Three Treasures, devising far-reaching strategies, exorcising ghosts and vanquishing bandits, pacifying the four directions, stabilizing the state, rescuing the dying and aiding the living, revitalizing the Daoist teachings, exhausting one’s strength and wealth without regret or retreat. Those capable of such are deemed to possess extraordinary merits and exceptional virtues.

**No Merit After Receiving the Register**

For any transgression, one must repent immediately, without delay. If the transgression occurs at the hour of *yin*, it must be addressed before *mao*. If circumstances prevent timely repentance, the day shall not be counted. If one fails to repent within three days, the penalty doubles. If one fails to repent within nine days, the repentance shall not be accepted. If absolved within nine days, one must perform meritorious deeds within three days thereafter. If one fails to perform meritorious deeds within nine days, they are deemed foolish, obstinate, base, and vulgar, incapable of self-improvement. Alternatively, they may be aged, impoverished, or ill, lacking the means; or a child yet unenlightened, with parents too ordinary to act on their behalf. Thus, their merits remain unrecorded for years. If, after a long time, they suddenly perform extraordinary deeds, they shall advance in accordance with their virtue, as determined by an enlightened master.

**Merit After Receiving Protection**

After receiving the register, whether three or nine days, or upon completing the repentance period, one shall offer restitution as prescribed and be reinstated according to the statutes, regardless of the transgression’s severity. Those who subsequently perform extraordinary deeds shall be promptly gathered and treated accordingly.

For those whose registers were revoked due to transgressions but later reinstated, the same statutes apply as for lost registers. They must offer restitution and provide meals for the worthy, ensuring no deficiencies. The master shall retrieve their original register and contend for it according to the Dao. For those whose registers were revoked or lost, a full cycle of repentance must be completed before the master submits a petition for divine scrutiny.

**Petition for Repentance After Losing the Register**

When one loses their register and seeks to repent, they must submit a petition for divine review. Before receiving absolution, they may not act on their own to petition for reinstatement. Once the review is granted and the register restored, the official may submit the petition themselves.

**Petition Text:**
With reverence, I examine the records: [Name], a man/woman of [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village], born on [year, month, day, hour], now prostrates and confesses sins, beseeching mercy. I, a humble descendant of officials, was favored by the turning of a thousand-year cycle to enter the Daoist gate, entrusted to the protection of the Most High and the Lords and Masters of the Dao. By their grace, I was corrected and encouraged to advance. Formerly, on [year, month, day, hour], I approached my master—or the Celestial Master [Name]—to receive the register of [Official Rank] and the Generals’ retinue, with their officers and soldiers, securing years of peace. Yet my conduct often violated the precepts, piling sins like mountains, inviting divine censure and punishment. Unintentionally, I lost my register on [year, month, day, hour], whether at home or elsewhere, due to public or private coercion, flood, fire, theft, or banditry—truthfully stated. I searched but could not recover it, fearing it was burned, destroyed, or taken by villains. As the circumstances dictate, I repent according to the statutes, offering firewood like a thousand cartloads and feasting the worthy like a thousand people, to redeem my transgressions and receive renewal. Your servant, though but flesh and bone, humbly submits this petition, wishing the overseeing officials to review and consider it. I beg forgiveness for the thousand sins and myriad faults—past and present—sweeping them all away. According to the statutes, I confess my lost register and submit to punishment, beseeching mercy to be reinstated in the Nine Palaces. I shall separately request re-inscription. Now I first present my plea.

I urge [Name] to vow reform, amend past wrongs, and cultivate future virtue, that faults may be absolved and merit daily renewed. May we begin anew, ensuring vigilance to the end. May the lost Generals, officers, and soldiers be recalled and restored, their celestial bureaus at peace, without resentment. In gratitude, I invoke the Most High.

**For Those Under Discipline Who Lose Their Register and Petition for Review**

**Petition Text:**
With reverence, I examine the records: I, a lowly one, was favored by the thousand-year turning to dwell in the Dao’s transformation. Though I labored without merit, my lapses and omissions were many, yet the master’s house upheld me. By grace, I received [Number] Generals’ tallies, inwardly to govern the body and outwardly to heal illness, attaining this day—truly a joy beyond mortal capacity. Yet my devotion was careless, my transgressions many, inviting divine censure. Suddenly, on [month, day], I lost my register. Though I searched, its whereabouts remain unknown. Reflecting on my faults, I realize that since receiving the register, I have earned no merit or reward. The officers and soldiers, bound to me, bear my sins, now bound to the Three Offices. To this day, my register is revoked and lost. I prostrate myself in remorse, repenting past wrongs and submitting to the Great Dao, begging universal mercy. Daring to submit this petition, I confess to the overseeing officials, beseeching the celestial bureaus to absolve my thousand sins and myriad faults. Though I rely on lofty petitions, my time in the Dao’s transformation has been brief, and I know not right from wrong. Now I purge my heart and reform my ways, seeking absolution for past offenses and recording future sincerity. May the lost Generals, officers, and soldiers be restored to their posts. Now, according to the statutes, I offer repentance, spread virtue in the Daoist gate, and pray the Most High to review and discern. I seek a single opportunity to proceed.

This concludes the petition for absolution after losing the register, submitting to punishment, and vowing reform.

**Petition for Delayed Punishment Due to Incomplete Restitution**

**Petition Text:**
With reverence, I examine the records: [Name], a man/woman of [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village], born in [year], along with my spouse and children [ages], prostrate and strike my head, confessing sins and begging mercy. I, a humble mortal, ignorant and foolish, clinging to life and delighting in survival, on [year, month, day] approached the Libationer [Name] to receive the register and officers’ retinue for my protection. Since then, by grace, my body has been strong and healthy. Yet I, a mortal, grew lax in upholding the statutes, failing to guard against peril. On [year, month, day], while traveling in [Location], I suddenly lost my talismans and tallies. Reflecting on my faults, I repeatedly confessed, seeking the Unitary Dao and striving for merit. Yet despite my efforts, the lost items remain unrecovered.

My foolishness has led me to collide with obstacles, incurring deep blame. On [year, month, day, hour], due to [specific transgression], I violated the master’s statutes, and my register of [Rank] was revoked. I repented, vowed reform, and prostrated myself to seek leniency. According to the statutes, loss incurs punishment. After punishment, reinstatement requires merit. For the loss of [Number] Generals’ registers, I must offer firewood like [Number] cartloads and feast the worthy like [Number] people. The statutes impose penalties to correct transgressions. Now, amid calamity and hardship, my household suffers. Daring to rely on the Dao’s vast compassion, which ever pities the foolish, I invoke the statutes’ flexibility. For the loss of [Register], I should be punished, but I am but a child, or a weak woman, or aged, unable to gather firewood or prepare feasts. I vow to devise a plan to establish merit. I beg for mercy. In my foolishness, I measure my capacity against the statutes, proposing to deliver firewood like [Number] cartloads and feast the worthy like [Number] people as a modest beginning, fearing it may not suffice. Trembling, I await your compassion. If granted, the firewood and feasts for [Number] people total [Value]. I shall also approach the sanctuary to request reinstatement in the Nine Palaces’ registers. Humbly submitting this petition, I wish to be separately inscribed. The feast for [Number] people shall be prepared on an auspicious day at the sanctuary. For any remaining firewood or feasts, I shall complete them at the sanctuary, resolving the matter before advancing to receive the registers of the Divine and Numinous Bureaus.

I declare the Most High Celestial Master’s vast grace. I, a humble sprout, ignorant of great virtue, dare to submit this petition through fire and boiling water, beseeching the overseeing officials to review and absolve my faults, thousand sins, and myriad faults. If any censuring officers or officials speak for my merit and promotion, granting higher rank and emolument, may they harbor no resentment. In gratitude, I invoke...

The Most High speaks thus.

After undergoing punishment, passing the review, and receiving the registers of the Nine Palaces:

From [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village], the male/female disciple [Name], aged [Age], son/daughter of [Name], with household head [Name] of male/female members, and guarantor [Name] of the male/female disciple.

This petition states: On [Year, Month, Day, Hour], the disciple [Name], or the male/female official Libationer [Name], a [Number]-generation descendant of Celestial Master Zhang, having received the registers of [Number] Generals, violated the precepts and incurred penalties. On [Year, Month, Day, Hour], at [Location], for the matter of [Event], or unwittingly lost them without cause—whether by water, fire, theft, or coercive seizure—having searched diligently for days with utmost effort yet failing to recover them, their whereabouts unknown, I willingly accept the penalty and swallow my grievance, daring not to complain. Yet like insects and ants, I cling to life; like grass and sprouts, I crave survival. Fearing the arrival of a baleful year when a hundred poisons spread, my sinful, filthy body, lacking the protective talismans, dreads incurring further punishment, my life hanging by a thread. I humbly implore the compassionate Father and Holy Mother of the Great Dao to extend boundless mercy, permitting renewal. Henceforth, I shall reform my past and cultivate my future, fulfilling the prescribed penalties and purifying my heart in earnest repentance. I beseech promotion in the review and petition for inscription, requesting the lawful issuance of the registers of the Nine Palace officials and soldiers. Submitted by the Libationer of the [Name] Sanctuary of Celestial Master [Name], your servant [Name] bows twice and respectfully presents this petition:

The male/female disciple [Name], having previously received the registers of [Office], lost them through fault and penalty. Now, having fulfilled the penalty, I petition for inscription. The details are as follows: [State, Commandery, County, Village, Name, Age], with household head and guarantor [Names]. I humbly dispatch the Merit-Officer Messenger and Reviewing Lords to verify the truth of this flesh-bound petitioner. If deemed worthy of pardon, may the registers of the Nine Palaces be duly inscribed without delay. This humble petitioner awaits the conferral of the registers, bowing in reverence to the Upper Palace. With this petition, your servant [Name], trembling with awe, bows twice and submits as above.

**Petition for Inscription After Punishment and Review to Receive the Registers of the Nine Palaces**

Respectfully submitting this document: From [State, Commandery, County, Village], the male/female disciple [Name], aged [Age], born on [Year, Month, Day, Hour], now residing at [Location]. Today, I prostrate myself, strike my breast, confess my sins, and beg for mercy. Truly, I am lowly and insignificant, the least of insects and grass, unworthy yet favored by past merits to join the ranks of humanity. By good fortune, I encountered the growth of the true and orthodox, and previously, drawn by admiration, I submitted to the great Dharma, delighting in the Dao and the gods, aspiring to longevity. On [Year, Month, Day, Hour], I entered the sanctuary, serving for [Number] years without merit, accumulating faults that led to my review. On [Year, Month], under the guidance of Master [Name], Libationer of [Office], I received the registers of the Divine and Numinous [Number] Generals. Having lost the talismans I wore, I incurred blame through my own misconduct. I have reflected on my transgressions and sought them in vain. From the outset, I failed to report this, bearing all responsibility. Kneeling before the lords and officials, confined by the Three Offices, I pray for absolution. May penalties be commuted to rewards, and may I be restored to my office as before. As a latecomer to the teachings, my time under the Dao’s transformation has been brief, and I remain ignorant of right and wrong. Now, I shall take responsibility, offering [Number] of [Items] to redeem myself, fulfilling the requirements of the registers’ statutes. I vow to reform my past and cultivate my future, begging for pardon of all prior and subsequent offenses, granting me a fresh start. By your boundless compassion, may I be inscribed anew today. May the registers of the Nine Palaces, as petitioned at [Time] on [Day], be conferred. Awaiting the response and the bestowal of all due appointments, may the protection of the officials swiftly follow. For my merits, may I be promoted according to the statutes of the Celestial Bureau. Regarding the reviewed matter, may the Nine Palace officials and soldiers be established to follow and shield me, eradicating sins and fostering blessings, ascending daily in virtue and power, and accomplishing my work. I invoke the grace of the Most High...

**Petition of Gratitude Three Days After Fulfilling Penalties and Receiving the Registers**

Respectfully submitting this document: Due to my misconduct, faults have accumulated. On [Month, Day, Hour], I carelessly lost the registers of [Number] Generals that I wore. Reflecting on my transgressions, I sought them in vain and truthfully reported the matter. By the grace of the Dao, my male/female master [Name] on [Month, Day] bestowed upon me a new inscription—an honor beyond my humble station. Overwhelmed with joy, I submit this petition in gratitude. First, I kneel before the lords and officials confined in the Three Offices, begging for universal pardon. May penalties be absolved, offices restored, and all proceed as before. My time under the Dao’s transformation has been brief, and I remain ignorant of right and wrong. Now, I swear to reform my past and cultivate my future, never again repeating past transgressions. I humbly beg for a fresh start, praying that from this day forward, metal and stone may open, water and fire may be extinguished, ailments healed, and transformations wrought, demonstrating the efficacy of the master’s Dao and the power of faith. I shall diligently exhort and guide the ignorant, never daring to slacken. I invoke the grace of the Most High...

Here ends the *Ritual Texts of the Orthodox Unity External Registers*.
