**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar of the Luminous Hall**

Guard the left scarlet terrace of the Azure Chamber, where the great spirit of the heart resides, named *Initial Square*; on the right, the great spirit of the Yellow Gate and Purple Chamber governs tranquility, named *Dharma King*. Their forms resemble infants, clad in robes matching the color of their chambers, each holding a flowing golden fire-bell.

When the practitioner desires to rest or engage in visualization, first contemplate the forms and colors of these two great spirits, then call their names thrice, and softly invoke:

*"Purple Gate and Azure Chamber,
Dwelling two great spirits,
Hands grasping flowing bells,
Bodies generating wind and clouds,
Flanking and guarding the true Dao,
Barred to all external intrusion.
Grant that my thoughts and perceptions
Freely traverse the numinous gates,
Exiting and entering with upright purity,
Ascending through the Nine Portals,
To behold the Nine Perfected,
And the Most High’s honor."*

Upon completion, visualize the Three Ones: to the left of the Luminous Hall, the Youthful Perfected Lord of Mysterious Yang, named *Lesser Azure*; at the center, the Spirit Lord of the Luminous Mirror, named *Beckoning Essence*, styled *Fourfold Clarity*; to the right, the Female Perfected Official of Subtle Yin, named *Subtle Darkness*, styled *Lesser Origin*. Their forms resemble infants, all clad in green brocade robes, girdled with four red jade bells, mouths holding red jade mirrors. They sit facing outward or toward one another—this is the Dao of the Luminous Hall.

**Yellow Robes and Black Sashes**

If the Daoist feels fear, visualize the three spirits, causing their jade bells to chime, their sound reaching the Great Ultimate. Let them exhale the red light of the jade mirrors, blazing ten thousand leagues. Upon completing the visualization, call the names of the Three Lords thrice and click the teeth nine times—then a thousand demons will submit, and ten thousand ghosts vanish.

If the Daoist suffers hunger or thirst, visualize the three spirits and call their names. The spirits will exhale red qi into the practitioner’s mouth, which is then inhaled and swallowed, instantly sating the body.

If the Daoist travels by night and the path is obscured, visualize and call the three spirits, causing each to emit firelight from their mouths, illuminating the way ahead, instantly brightening the darkness.

If encountering peril, calamity, or the threat of blades and weapons, visualize and call the three spirits to shake their jade bells, their sound filling the Six Directions—then all malevolence will cease to harm.

If seeking longevity or wishing to dispel illness, sit upright and compose the mind before resting. Visualize and call the Three Lords; they will kneel facing outward, exhaling red qi to bathe the practitioner’s mouth. Swallow it repeatedly, and the red light will encircle the body, transforming into fire that fuses with the flesh, burning it entirely to embers. Then visualize the Four Sovereigns’ qi dispersing the wind, after which gather the spirit and open the eyes. Repeating this practice will restore the complexion of a maiden, laying the foundation for prolonged vision.

Within the Grotto Chamber: to the left, the Venerable Lord of Non-Excellence; at the center, the Yellow Elder Lord; to the right, the White Prime Lord—this is the Dao of Flying Perfection, detailed in *The Scripture of Golden Florescence*.

Within the Cinnabar Field Palace resides the Supreme Perfected Lord of the Primordial One, along with his two ministers, dwelling together. This is the Dao of riding cloud chariots and controlling dragon-deer.

Within the Flowing Pearl Palace moves the Dao of the Great Ultimate’s ministers and the Controller of Destiny. After three hundred years, one must swear an oath with pearls and silk before transmission is granted.

The preceding three palaces’ scriptures expound the Dao of seeking immortality and becoming a Perfected One, practiced in the world. Yet only those with the proper bone destiny, whose names are recorded in the world’s true register, and who are deemed worthy by the Great Ultimate Emperor Lord, may receive them.

Within the Jade Emperor’s Palace dwells the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity, surnamed *Lian*, named *Holding*, styled *Vast Recluse*. She wears a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, her hair bound in seven-tiered vermilion jade coils, crowned with the *Limitless Advancing Worthies* coronet.

Within the Heavenly Court Palace resides the Supreme Essence Perfected Woman, surnamed *Jue*, named *Return*, styled *Assisting Kind*. She wears a sash of azure jewel-light brocade, frost-silk of nine hues, her hair bound in a jade-jewel flying cloud coil, crowned with the *Dark Yellow Advancing Worthies* coronet.

Within the Ultimate Perfection Palace dwells the Empress of the Great Ultimate Emperor, surnamed *Mysterious*, named *Void-Born*, styled *Elder Vacuity*. She wears a sash of dark silk woven with flowing light and five-colored phoenix patterns, her hair bound in a seven-jeweled dark-patterned coil, crowned with the *Limitless Advancing Worthies* coronet.

Within the Supreme August Palace dwells the Queen of the Most High Lord, surnamed *Qian*, named *Embracing Child*, styled *Uniting Prolonged Life*. She wears a sash of seven-jeweled flying essence, dark-light cloud brocade, frost-silk of nine hues, her hair bound in a nine-fold dark jade essence cloud coil, crowned with the *Dark Yellow Limitless Three Treasures Jade* coronet.

The scriptures of these four palaces expound the Dao of the Feminine Perfected One, transmitted after achieving immortality and seeking truth—a Dao higher than that of the Masculine Perfected One. Beginners find these palaces empty and may not approach their essentials; the numinous spirits enforce strict prohibitions.

Within the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace sits the Perfected Lord of the Great One, surnamed *Jue*, named *Regulating Excellence*, styled *Transforming Mystery*. His form resembles a newborn infant, seated upon a golden couch within a jade canopy, clad in purple embroidered brocade, girdled with flowing fire-bells. In his left hand, he grasps the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper; in his right, the guiding cord of the Northern Apex. Alone, he sits upright in the Dark Mystery Palace.

When the Daoist completes the visualization of the Three Ones, they should then visualize and call upon the Supreme Clarity Central Yellow Great One Perfected Lord, seeking the matters of longevity and prolonged vision. From the Great One’s palace, rest and drink fifty draughts of the clear qi exhaled from the Great One’s mouth, then swallow fifty mouthfuls of saliva. Upon completion, softly invoke:

*"Perfected August of the Great One,
Central Yellow Purple Lord,
Surnamed Jue, named Regulating Excellence,
Styled Transforming Mystery,
Seated on a golden couch within a jade canopy,
Clad in purple embroidered brocade,
Girdled with fire-bells to sever evil and destroy treachery,
Hands grasping stellar essence,
Crowned with the sun’s true radiance.
Upright, you exhale qi,
Granting me to swallow it,
Speaking with me in shared communion,
Feasting together upon mysterious cinnabar.
Refine and cleanse the seven po,
Harmonize and soften the three hun,
Numinous spirits attend and guard,
Enabling me to fly as an immortal.
The five viscera regenerate,
Restoring the white complexion of youth.
Receive the scriptures of Supreme Clarity,
Becoming the Controller of Destiny’s Emperor Lord.
All wishes and desires,
A hundred blessings draw near."*

Upon completion, after fourteen years of practice, one ascends with the Supreme Unity to the Web of the Seven Origins. After eighteen years, one approaches the Supreme Clarity to receive the scriptures and wear the talismans, commanding eighteen jade lads and jade maidens. This may be cultivated by any who bear the name, or one may devote oneself solely to this Dao without necessarily adhering to the Three Ones.

The True Talismanic Writ of the Supreme Great Ultimate Emperor Lord, transmitted by the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity to the Golden Portal Emperor Lord. These True Talismans of the Great Ultimate Emperor Lord comprise six talismans for the Upper Origin, five for the Middle Origin, and five for the Lower Origin.

The method of the Supreme Lord for summoning the Three Ones to guard the form: on the first days of the solar terms—Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice—inscribe in cinnabar. At dawn, face the king and ingest one talisman, then proceed in sequence for sixteen days, completing the ingestion of sixteen talismans. For the subsequent eight solar terms, follow the same method, bowing twice toward the king each time. Recite the incantation:

*"The Upper Origin’s One True,
Guards firm the Muddy Pellet.
The Middle Origin’s One True,
Pacifies the spirit in the Crimson Palace.
The Lower Origin’s One True,
Defends my Gate of Destiny.
The Three Origins in radiant harmony,
Preserve life and ensure its endurance.
Summon the numinous, draw forth qi,
Seated, descend in spontaneity.
Transform the form, refine the body,
Bones transmute into immortality.
Feathers and plumage take flight,
Soaring through the imperial dawn."*

Again, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar, enclose it in a brocade pouch, and wear it upon the head, avoiding all defilement. After five years of ingesting the talismans, one may meet with perfected beings; after nine years, one attains spirit communication and penetrating vision, able to sit or stand at will, commanding the Six Jias. Heaven grants twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens, enabling one to ride clouds and mount dragons, roaming and feasting in the Jade Palace.

The method of guarding the One is the foremost chapter of the True Writ of the Supreme Clarity Golden Portal Emperor Lord, the jade path of the Most High, the ford of passage for divine immortals, the wondrous secret of the host of perfected. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you; if you can see the One, the One will see you. The One requires the body to stand, and the body requires the One to live. Contemplate it ceaselessly, waking and sleeping without release—thus may long life be attained.

Here ends the *True Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar of the Supreme Clarity Hall of Luminosity*.
