At that time, the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate ascended Mount Laoshen on the first day of the first month in the third year of the Red Crow reign of Lord Hao. There, he refined his thoughts and meditated upon the Dao.

At noon that day, thirty-three earthbound immortals and Daoist adepts came to his seat to burn incense. In an instant, celestial bells and music of ten thousand chimes resounded. The Most High Lord of the Dao, accompanied by the host of sagely transcendents, perfected sovereigns, attendants of the Thousand Perfected, jade youths, and immortal maidens, arrived together, traversing the void upon empty space. The place where they dwelled transformed, their thrones and seats adorned with splendor, and the Most High Lord of the Dao took his seat according to rank.

The Immortal Duke prostrated himself upon the ground and, after a long while, spoke: "Through kalpas of profound accumulation, I have been fortunate to delight in the Dao and revere the True. I bear the grace of the Compassionate Venerable One, who has descended to this humble abode, where the Thousand Perfected have gathered in assembly. My joy and felicity are beyond words. Yet, abiding in lowly obscurity, I have not yet attained great awakening. I humbly inquire: among the Daoist and lay communities of the world, what are the proper rules and rituals for conduct and retreat? I beseech your guidance."

The Most High replied: "You possess meritorious virtue, long renowned as the Left Immortal. For a time, you have been entrusted with karmic conditions to be reborn in the lower world, serving as a model for all beings and aiding in the propagation of the Dao." Thereupon, he commanded the Thousand Perfected to expound the regulations and precepts.

The Thousand Perfected assented reverently and received the teaching. The Perfected Guardian of Life then proclaimed the regulations, saying:

**The Regulations state:** To establish and enact laws, one must rely on those capable of practice. Among the assembly, those without adherence to the law—regardless of age—shall not be permitted to dwell together. All who reside together must uniformly uphold the sagely teachings, their actions and stillness conforming to ritual propriety. They must sever all evil and jointly safeguard goodness. Those who incite wickedness shall be dealt with according to separate regulations.

**The Regulations state:** The Dao and its methods are pure and empty, not seeking fame or profit. To dwell in seclusion and tranquility is called the abode of immortals. Yet among my disciples, many hoard wealth, treasures, goods, cattle, horses, servants, and slaves, clinging to them without cease. Such persons sever the roots of the Three Treasures, blind the eyes of sentient beings, and though they may uphold the scriptures and observe the precepts, they collectively extinguish the Dharma.

**The Regulations state:** When eminent and virtuous masters dwell together in one place, there may be cunning disciples who ardently seek refuge. Some remain entangled in worldly attachments, while others are coerced by unjust power. When circumstances permit no other recourse, each case must be tested according to its circumstances. Some may first be tasked with arduous labor; others may be guided with gentle and expansive words. Some may be instructed in solitary sitting and forgetting; others may be expelled and sent far away. Some may be taught the precious scriptures, enjoined to observe purification rites and fasts; others, fearing the master’s august authority, may be comforted by attendants. If, in the end, such disciples persist in evil without any progress toward goodness, to harbor them is to extinguish the Dao and its methods. They must be forever kept at a distance.

**The Regulations state:** If there are disciples who delight in the true Dharma, who deeply comprehend the great meaning of the scriptures, and all wish to hear it, yet their karmic conditions and dull faculties obstruct them, such persons, when their aspiration for goodness arises, should be consoled. They may be shown the Three Precepts and the Five Precepts, and instructed in tranquility and pacification of the mind.

The great and virtuous Dharma masters serve as models for all beings. If a disciple’s nature is haughty, they must be humbled in mind and demeanor. If their conduct is unyielding, they must be subdued. If they are timid and weak, they must be encouraged to advance with courage and vigor.

Having become parents to all beings, how could one not be earnest and diligent, ensuring they align with the Dao and its methods, never to regress?

**The Regulations state:** Those who have left the household life and uphold the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, or even the Three Hundred Great Precepts—within each single precept, twenty-four benevolent spirits offer protection, while heavenly and human beings make offerings, preventing the commission of evil. Those who disbelieve in the precepts and commit evil due to their transgressions will bind themselves to karmic retribution in both the unseen and manifest realms, only to fall into blind paths in future rebirths. Whether one violates or upholds the precepts, the resulting blessings or sins are impartially bestowed, regardless of whether one is a Daoist or a layperson. The principle is unbiased, and the merit is equal.

**The Regulations state:** Those of superior virtue and esteemed standing who preside over the assembly must avoid suspicion even in minor transgressions. If discord arises with the king, his consorts and kin, high ministers and officials, or with laymen, their sons and daughters, lesser Daoists, or attendants—especially those with long-standing grievances—one must not reprimand them openly. If punishment is warranted, summon them to a secluded place and admonish them privately.

**The Regulations state:** If one is incapable of bearing the hatred of the assembly, the matter should be reported to the community for collective discipline.

**The Regulations state:** Those who have left the household life must prioritize simplicity and tranquility. Engaging in unlawful conduct leads inevitably to deviation. Unlawful acts include:
1. Extensively seeking material gain while boasting of one’s abilities;
2. Endlessly accumulating wealth, arranging marriages, or practicing divination and physiognomy;
3. Arrogantly claiming vast knowledge while recklessly interpreting celestial phenomena;
4. Behaving like attendants by personally engaging in farming and weighing grain;
5. Disrupting the assembly and associating with evil companions;
6. While professing to uphold the true Dharma, allying with corrupt laypeople;
7. Disregarding proper conduct in sitting and rising, thereby disrupting the order of the Dharma;
8. Acquiring wealth through improper means and sharing beds with laypeople;
9. Venturing out at night without carrying a torch to illuminate the path;
10. Gambling at games of chance, engaging in robbery, or indulging in misconduct without self-restraint.

Those who enter the Dao and rely on the community may be admonished. If they fail to reform, they extinguish the Dao and its methods.

**The Regulations state:** A Shangqing Dharma Master should not administer the Great Precepts to others, nor accept disciples, nor serve as a preceptor, nor engage in evaluating community matters, nor travel alone at night, nor associate with those of heterodox views. Their every action must accord with the Dharma.

**The Regulations state:** When lesser Daoists invite esteemed masters, they must refine their appearance, adjust their robes and headwear, walk with measured dignity, and bow three times in reverence. After bowing, they should kneel and declare: *"I, so-and-so, a humble novice, have not yet mastered the teachings. Having come from afar, I humbly beseech the great virtue to resolve my entanglements. Whatever I hear, I shall not disobey."* The master then addresses the assembly: *"This Daoist has harbored karmic obstructions since youth and cannot resolve them alone. Today, he bows in repentance. From this life until now, for all acts of anger, wrath, robbery, greed, and every unwholesome deed, he now seeks absolution, vowing never to repeat them. He aspires to advance in the true precepts and comprehend their profound meaning."* After the declaration, the novice rises and bows three more times before withdrawing.

**The Regulations state:** Those who disrupt the assembly, disregard the true Dharma, become intoxicated and disorderly, or disrespect their superiors and inferiors shall be fined in coin, grain, or other goods. If they initially agree but later refuse to comply, they may be subjected to corporal punishment, have their possessions confiscated for offerings, or be assigned labor such as clearing land, felling trees, or harvesting crops. If the assembly cannot enforce discipline, the matter should be brought before the Daoist community. If even this proves ineffective, they may be handed over to the king for judgment according to secular law.

**The Regulations state:** Those who, in defiance of the true Dharma, wander into other abbeys to cause trouble, recklessly demand wine and meat, arrange marriages for attendants, buy or sell servants and livestock, adopt secular customs, commit crimes and are imprisoned but later pardoned, or secure their release through bribes, or seize stolen goods to profit further—such individuals shall be punished according to the established laws of the precepts.

**The Regulations state:** All who reside in a Daoist sanctuary must partake in communal meals. When a vegetarian feast is held, all—whether Daoist or lay—are to gather together. The sounding of the qing and the ringing of the bell summon the assembly. Those not participating in the feast shall not partake of the food, for the merit of the offering is shared equally by all. To refuse entry to guests is a disgrace to the community. If questioned, one may explain that the food is limited, and guests are not excluded. Since we lack divine powers, how can we provide for all? The reply should be: *"Hosts and guests must reciprocate. With limited provisions and many guests, let us share equally, reducing our portions to accommodate others. This is a matter of human kindness; it should not be denied."*

**The Regulations state:** The Dao and its methods are impartial, making no distinction between the intimate and the distant. Whether noble or base, all dwell together in the assembly, and their protection must be sincere. If personal favoritism dictates who receives aid, the community will fall into chaos. All must exercise caution.

**The Regulations state:** During a vegetarian feast, if laypeople come seeking food, the kitchen supervisor must inquire whether they can observe the fast. If they can, they shall be given food; if not, they must be instructed in the consequences of karma, so they may understand the distinction between sin and merit. This is not out of stinginess but to guide them toward awakening, upholding the Dharma, and embodying the foremost compassion. If no instruction is given, the beings incur sin.

**The Regulations state:** During a vegetarian feast, five procedures must be observed:
1. First, determine the time by the sun’s shadow;
2. Then, ring the bell to gather the assembly;
3. Next, perform ablutions, lay out mats, and arrange seating;
4. Strike the qing to begin the meal;
5. Finally, recite the food incantation of the ancestral masters.

Failure to perform these five acts renders the feast impure, and partaking of the food constitutes theft.

**The Regulations state:** For the daily provisions of the assembly, if a prior agreement of three measures is made, it must not be altered. To reduce the amount is theft; to take more is likewise theft.

If, when serving food, one takes an excessive portion of fruits or vegetables already presented, this constitutes theft. Should greed compel one to take more, the act is likewise theft. When serving food, the senior must gauge the needs of the junior; no excess may be taken. As the *Shengxuan Jing* states: "Above and below, all must regard one another with care."

**The Regulations state:** The demeanor of Daoist assemblies must be solemn and orderly. Clothing should be clean, conduct dignified, and bearing admirable—thus inspiring worldly goodness and earning the praise of the heavens. If one’s appearance and manner are slovenly, displeasing to the assembly, unworthy of public esteem, and bringing disgrace upon the Dao and its teachings, this diminishes the treasure of the Dao and severs the seed of great compassion. Yet if one’s conduct in the assembly’s rites commands reverence, the distant mysteries of the teaching flourish, and the Dharma gate stands apart.

**The Regulations state:** When observing the rites of a vegetarian feast, those of great virtue should sit at the front, instructing the assembly to ensure the feast is conducted with propriety, lest the host feel disdain. Should disputes arise, with no regard for restraint, not only do the Daoist and lay communities discern good from evil, but the sages of the ten directions also witness it in secret. The misfortune of sin is borne by each according to their deeds.

**The Regulations state:** Entering and rising in the assembly follow set rules. When sitting, men should first place the left foot forward, stepping properly near the seat, then the right foot, gently pressing the seat with the hands before settling the body and sitting back. When rising, they should again press the seat gently, move forward to retrieve their shoes, first lowering the left foot, then the right, and stand with composure. Women should lead with the right foot, and their sitting and rising follow the same pattern. When entering the hall, one must first straighten one’s robe and sash outside the door, adjust one’s attire, gather one’s garments, and compose oneself. One should visualize the assembly within as the honored sages of the ten directions, the perfected immortals, the present king, or the prefectural and county magistrates, then proceed with measured steps.

**The Regulations state:** When entering the hall, if there are two doors—east and west—one should enter through the side corresponding to one’s seat. Those seated to the west should enter through the west door; those to the east, through the east door. No crossing over the threshold is permitted.

**The Regulations state:** Daoist robes are the attire of the Middle Kingdom, with wide sleeves and cross-collared skirts, distinct from secular dress. They must not be mixed with those of laypeople. Robes, furs, boots, and utensils should be plain and unadorned, without excessive use of gold, silver, or bronze. For morning devotions, rituals, and paying homage to the sages, one should wear full ceremonial attire according to rank. In the Shangqing tradition, this means purple robes with pendants; in the Lingbao tradition, plain yellow; in the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors traditions, crimson. When not engaged in rituals, fine silk of indigo or locust-brown may be worn, but never patterned brocade or embroidered silk to dazzle the world. Female officers must not wear gold or jade hairpins or bracelets, nor adorn themselves with flowers or cosmetics—first, because such vanity contradicts the Dao; second, because it fails to cultivate a sincere heart.

**The Regulations state:** Daoist priests and female officers must each maintain purity. Male priests must not keep female attendants, nor female officers male attendants. They should keep their distance, stilling their hearts so that their eyes do not see improper forms nor their ears hear improper sounds. As the *Laozi* states: "Not seeing what may be desired keeps the heart from confusion." If such temptations arise, they must be reported to the assembly. Should one fail to correct such conduct, the law of the king applies.

**The Regulations state:** Private quarters in monasteries are often sites of disorder, primarily due to those in authority failing to exercise restraint, indulging without measure. Or perhaps the leaders do not issue clear instructions, dwelling in sacred spaces while their hearts are tainted by greed, leading the younger generation astray into evil paths. Such wickedness obstructs the source of the great Dao, leaving those of true faith with no refuge.

**The Regulations state:** Entering the sacred precincts together, all should open the path to goodness. Harboring anger or inciting violence violates the great compassion. Raising cattle or horses inevitably leads to whipping; hunting dogs and cats are steeped in the intent to kill. Having entered the pure precepts, all such acts must be renounced.

**The Regulations state:** Though people have ranks, the precepts know no distinction of great or small. Some may outwardly uphold the precepts while their hearts remain detached from the Dharma. They neglect the purity of their dwellings, embellishing halls and temples, gathering wicked factions, and engaging in unlawful acts. Hearing the bell for worship, they laugh; entering the monastery gate, they scorn the virtuous and slander those who practice the Dao. Such failures stem from the leaders themselves—how can they then guide their disciples to uphold the teachings, when the standards of conduct daily deteriorate?

**The Regulations state:** If someone in the assembly behaves improperly, one should discreetly admonish them in private: "The ranks of the perfected and the steps of immortality are what practitioners tread. The Dao has no form, yet it depends on harmony among people. The disciples of the ten directions assist the Dao and propagate its transformation. Hearing the essential teachings, they aspire to cultivate themselves. How can one allow others to become aware of such faults? Now, though the great virtues among us commit no transgressions, there is this matter that does not accord with the true Dao. I urge you to correct it, as the moon wanes only to wax again, and the orchid withers only to bloom anew. Let us use words to support one another. If the teachings are not heeded, the matter must be brought before the assembly."

**The Regulations state:** Disciples under one’s care must be admonished all the more strictly. For grave transgressions, they should be reproached with five points:
1. "I now reproach you, and you must leave."
2. "After leaving, do not enter my quarters again."
3. "With no one to serve me, I vow never to employ you again."

4. "While I live, do not come to my place."
5. "I would rather guide beings through the three wretched paths and five destinies than speak with you again."
Such reproach is severe indeed in its subjugation and restraint. It does not permit extralegal measures—no unlawful beatings with cangues or rods, no hanging by the neck or binding in reverse, no day-and-night abuse or scolding. The statutes contain no such provisions, for they would harm the seed of great compassion.

If a master orders disciples to sell wine or meat, engage in trade, tend cattle or horses, or commit acts of debauchery, the disciples may say: "Such deeds are not the conduct of the Heavenly Worthy. I dare not act as your disciple. If you grow angry and reproach me, I must leave."

**The Regulations state:** Disciples of evil conduct who show no remorse exhibit ten traits:
1. They commit evil without shame.
2. They see goodness yet do not cultivate it.
3. They grow worse upon hearing admonition.
4. Their actions lack dignity and propriety.
5. They are arrogant, overbearing, and devoid of reverence.
6. Their nature is cruel and fierce.
7. Their companions lack loyalty and trustworthiness.
8. They wander and indulge in licentiousness.
9. They delight in slaughter.
10. They disrupt hierarchy through drunkenness.

Those who bear these ten traits destroy the Dao and its teachings. If, however, one does not commit evil but endures hardship with diligence—entering chambers at dawn to sweep away filth and dust, paying respects at morning, noon, and dusk, seeking to learn, and obeying commands without complaint—then, like a great vessel gradually filled, they accumulate virtue and attain perfection. Such disciples uphold and propagate the true teachings, and their praises are widely sung.

**The Regulations state:** Those who leave the household life differ from the laity. In establishing abbeys and dwellings, they must not allow laypeople or family members to lodge with them. If mendicants from the ten directions pass through, their virtue and conduct should be assessed and they should be accommodated in three ranks, with proper regard for seniority and precedence.

**The Regulations state:** Each abbey should have a separate courtyard named with care, where the community may gather regularly in the refectory. If mendicants from afar arrive seeking temporary lodging, they must first be asked where they wish to stay. Those from the ten directions should assess their own talents and virtue and request lodging accordingly. If their talents and virtue are lofty, they may be assigned to a separate courtyard. If they possess no exceptional qualities, they may request ordinary lodging. If they deem themselves humble and weak, they may ask for a modest chamber; they should seek with humility and not exceed their station. If a senior offers lodging to a junior, the junior should decline and request a different place. If one’s talents do not match their lodging, they must be demoted or dismissed.

**The Regulations state:** Those who leave the household life don yellow robes and wear blue-green as their insignia. If they can be as pure as frost and unsullied as jade, as smooth as water and as clear as a mirror—lifelong fields of blessing, their conduct without blemish, upholding the true precepts—they may be likened to five things:
1. Like a noble family suddenly bearing a son blind in both eyes, who after three months regains his sight, bringing joy to the household. The preceptless are like the blind.
2. Like a mirror being polished, growing ever brighter. Those who uphold the precepts accumulate merit with each thought.
3. Like an infant slowly growing to adulthood. Those who uphold the precepts rise from lowliness to eminence.
4. Like a starving man constantly longing for food, certain to die without it. Those who do not receive the precepts remain forever blind on the wheel of rebirth.
5. Like a ship that can cross the great sea. Those who uphold the precepts will surely traverse the bitter sea of birth and death.

**The Regulations state:** If kings, ministers, benefactors, or artisans can benefit the community, they may be provided with food, firewood, and other necessities upon request, with the assembly’s approval. Likewise, if those with power or bandits could harm the community, they too must be supplied with food. These are not good people, but they could damage the community of the Dao.

**The Regulations state:** Common property must not be borrowed for private use. In cases of illness or urgent need, one may request it from the assembly, but it must later be repaid in full.

**The Regulations state:** Unlawful items must not be offered as alms.

The Perfected Lord asked: "What are unlawful items?"
The Realized One replied: "Cattle, horses, slaves, weapons, and the like—these are all unlawful."

**The Regulations state:** In times of famine or chaos, when each seeks abundance and tranquility, those who remain steadfast may be given a portion of the community’s private property.

**The Regulations state:** Ritual objects, icons, and scriptures vary in importance depending on their use.

The Perfected Lord asked: "What distinguishes the weight of ritual objects, utensils, scriptures, and icons?"
The Realized One replied: "Bells, chimes, banners, flowers, censers, cases, canopies, precious banners, and scripture wrappings are ritual objects and thus weighty. Hats, shoes, tablets, coarse robes, skirts, jackets, and undergarments are utensils and thus of lesser weight. The original intent determines weight—if one later treats a weighty item as light, it violates the five punishments. If one initially treats a light item as weighty, it is not an offense.

Icons have three ranks: the Heavenly Worthy is supreme, Realized Ones are intermediate, and immortals or masters of the Mystic Teachings are lowest. The original intent in offering an icon determines its weight; it must not be treated as light, or it incurs the ten evils. If a lesser icon is treated as higher, it is not an offense.

Scriptures are likewise ranked: *Shangqing* and *Dadong* are the Great Vehicle; *Dongxuan Lingbao* is the Middle Vehicle; *Dongshen Sanhuang* is the Small Vehicle. If one initially intends to create a Great Vehicle scripture but later produces a Middle or Small Vehicle text, it violates the five punishments. If one initially creates a Small Vehicle text but later produces a Middle or Great Vehicle text, it is not an offense.

**The Regulations state:** Stealing ritual objects or utensils is equivalent to the five heinous crimes.

**The Regulations state:** Using common food or drink for private gifts or personal gain is treated as theft.

**The Regulations state:** Common property belongs to all in the ten directions. It is passed down through generations without interruption. It must not be used arbitrarily at the time, nor may it be privately appropriated or divided for personal gain—all such acts incur the sin of the five heinous crimes.

**The Regulations state:** If one’s mother, aunt, sisters, or other female relatives suffer from illness or urgent distress and require assistance, there is no offense. If the children of others are drowning or trapped in fire, even if impure thoughts arise, one must still do everything possible to save them, without committing any improper contact.

**The Regulations state:** Those who leave the household life dwell alone in seclusion, apart from worldly things, cutting off love and abandoning glory, abiding in tranquil solitude. If they violate this and become disorderly, the world will no longer hold them in reverence.

**The Regulations state:** When traveling on the road and encountering women who make requests, beg for food or drink, or the like, one may only speak from a distance of ten paces or more. If receiving objects or food, place them on the ground or hold them, then depart and allow the woman to take them afterward—never hand them directly. If encountering women on the road, one must yield the path and let them pass.

**The Regulations state:** When lustful thoughts arise, regard them as encountering a ferocious tiger, seeing a venomous snake, facing the king, being a thief caught by the master, sitting in a house as it catches fire, or sailing a boat at sea as it springs a leak. Cultivate these six perceptions, and lust will have no place to arise.

**The Regulations state:** In shared abodes such as temples, halls, gardens, and fields belonging to the Three Treasures, the halls are dedicated to the Heavenly Worthy, while the halls belong to the Daoists. If construction involves distinctions of rank, and there are private chambers, these are built by the Daoists themselves, with size and grade determined by their own status. Upon death, they may dispose of them as they wish during their lifetime. If no instructions are left after death, the disciples or lay novices may manage them. After receiving ordination and being assigned a separate name, they may also dispose of them as they see fit. However, the land belongs to the Three Treasures and may not be altered. If the community has prior agreements, these general rules do not apply.

**The Regulations state:** Those newly entered into the Dao, whose precepts and conduct are not yet complete, rely on villages and hamlets rather than residing in temples. Without venerable masters to revere above or virtuous companions below, they often associate with cunning peers, enticing and accompanying men and women, sharing beds, laughing and jesting, drinking wine and eating meat. When laypeople see this, they instead develop contempt. Such behavior destroys the Dao and the Law, undermines others’ faith and respect, and when discovered by esteemed masters, they are punished according to the regulations. If they cannot be corrected, the king’s law applies.

**The Regulations state:** If those who have left the household life give Three Treasures property to officials or powerful figures to seek personal gain, causing laypeople to develop fearful expectations, even if they are capable of construction, it is better to sit in pure stillness. Those who violate this are judged as having stolen property.

**The Regulations state:** Those who leave the household life do not associate with the secular world, seek fame or profit, or perform conditioned meritorious deeds. They enter stillness and samādhi, subdue external demons—this is called pure precepts, the true mother of the treasure of the Dao.

**The Regulations state:** When those who have left the household life occupy clean halls and empty rooms, excessive attachment leads to ten evil accumulations: first, extensively occupying wilderness and separately maintaining fields and dwellings; second, cultivating gardens and groves for personal land profit; third, storing and accumulating silk, cotton, grain, and cloth; fourth, trading in servants and slaves; fifth, lovingly raising the six livestock; sixth, greedily gathering the eight delicacies; seventh, delighting in play; eighth, adorning curtains with bronze; ninth, wearing strange and extravagant clothing; tenth, diligently hoarding treasures and valuables. None of these ten things may be done. One should deeply reform and daily renew their adherence to the Dao.

**The Regulations state:** If someone comes to beg, whether for the Three Treasures’ sake—such as establishing fasts, transmitting ordinations, lecturing, reciting scriptures, or receiving offerings—whatever is obtained through the Three Treasures must be handled according to the *Mingzhen Regulations*, following the twelve-fold transmission procedures. For other cases, one may freely give alms and bestow charity, but one must not accept impure offerings or make impure donations, as all such acts incur the sin of perverting the law.

**The Regulations state:** If disciples, fearing disorder in cold times or famine, store silk, cotton, silk cloth, and the five grains to prepare for urgent needs and almsgiving, this is not prohibited.

**The Regulations state:** If someone offers weapons, birds, beasts, or unlawful items as alms, none of these should be accepted.

**The Regulations state:** If someone offers servants or slaves for service, none should be accepted. However, if the servants maintain vegetarian precepts, they may be accepted.

**The Regulations state:** If the dwellings of those who have left the household life are adjacent to the homes of lay men and women, each must close their doors at night. Failure to do so violates the precepts.

**The Regulations state:** Those who have left the household life would rather incur the sin of stealing bells or statues than speak of others’ private, shameful matters.

**The Regulations state:** The clothing, shoes, and sandals of those who have left the household life must always be neat. Their movements, sitting, standing, speech, and laughter must be measured. If due to illness, coercion, fright, or being attacked by beasts, they are chased, injured, or their steps and clothing become disordered, there is no offense. Otherwise, it violates the precepts. If done intentionally, it violates the precepts.

The Perfected Lord was asked: “What is meant by *violating the precepts*? What is meant by *violating the regulations*?”
The True Person replied: “When the precepts are not directly violated but one is said to have violated the precepts, it is a flogging offense. When the regulations are not directly violated but one is said to have violated the regulations, it is a caning offense.”

**The Regulations state:** If one finds buried treasure in the wild, return it to the king. If the treasure bears an inscription indicating it belongs to scriptures, images, halls, or meritorious works, the finder should follow the inscription’s instructions to distribute or construct it—no need to report to the king. Failure to do so violates the ten evil precepts. If one finds lost items on the road or in the wild, take the item and post a notice. If the owner is found, return it. If the owner cannot be found, give it to the common property; otherwise, it violates the precepts.

**The Regulations state:** In winter, one may bathe once every ten days. Prepare a private chamber, six feet square, with a water trough, stove, and bamboo pipe to channel hot water into it. Add peach branches, cypress leaves, orchid, and bamboo leaves to the basket for filtering the water.

When the kitchen drum sounds, superiors and inferiors shall enter the bath in order of rank. Men and women must not share the same chamber, nor may one bathe with laypeople or use their bathing garments. Failure to observe these rules violates the precepts.

**The Regulations state:** Daoists must not consume alcohol. Some falsely claim cold weather or feign abdominal pain to justify drinking, only to flush with intoxication, disrupt hierarchy, or incite disorder. When attending alms-gatherings, performing rites, traveling on roads, or engaging in public or private affairs, such conduct not only breaches personal decorum but also defiles the Daoist community, extinguishing the Dao and obstructing its propagation. If invited by others, one must prioritize purity and dignity in all public and private conduct. Violations of these principles incur precept-breaking. However, if illness is genuine and known to all, medicinal remedies are permitted without restriction—though the afflicted must remain outside ritual assemblies.

Master Xian said: "Within the Daoist tradition, wine is permitted." The *Lingbao Sutra* states: *"Wine is set in the Floating Clouds Abbey, / Highly drunk at the Jade Clarity Terrace."* How can this be so starkly contradictory?

The Perfected One replied: "What a misguided view! The *Taiqing Sutra* teaches: *Transmute gold and jade into thirty-six waters—gold as water becomes golden nectar, red jade as water becomes crimson nectar, white jade as water becomes jade nectar or jade liquid.* The *Dingzhi Sutra* further states: *The five jade liquids do not intoxicate; constant mindfulness of pure conduct—where is the allowance for such?*"

**The Regulations state:** When Daoists travel outside and witness fighting, filial impiety, fraternal discord, theft, military violence, or homicide, they must return to the abbey, bathe in fragrant water, and enter quiet meditation to avoid transgression.

**The Regulations state:** When receiving food during a fast, one must use a clean handkerchief to hold it.

**The Regulations state:** After a fast, one must rinse the mouth and clean the teeth with a willow twig.

**The Regulations state:** When selecting alms, follow the established method of the host, dividing the twenty-four *qi* to determine merit or fault.

**The Regulations state:** If a junior disciple encounters a senior master or scriptures and images behind them, they must attend and protect them, never turning their back.

**The Regulations state:** When transmitting scriptures or conferring precepts, female officials may enter Daoist abbeys, and Daoist priests may enter female abbeys—provided they first request a master, establish ranks, and announce the proceedings to the assembly to ensure solemnity and adherence to precepts. No one may attend alone or in pairs, enter the ritual hall unannounced, or disrupt the rites in private chambers. All must depart the same day and not stay overnight; otherwise, they violate the precepts.

**The Regulations state:** Male and female officials shall each have their own dependencies. Male officials depend on male officials, female officials on female officials, with senior masters as their teachers. Every ten days, they shall visit their teacher for instruction. At the appointed time, they must don their ritual robes, compose their minds, and proceed reverently and solemnly to the teacher’s door, facing neither east nor west. Upon arrival, they announce: *"This disciple pays respects."* If the teacher acknowledges them, they adjust their robes and sashes, burn incense in the scripture-recitation chamber, and summon the disciple to enter. Approaching the teacher, the disciple performs three measured bows and inquires: *"Has the teacher’s health been well of late? Has your virtue remained unimpaired?"* If the teacher is without affliction, they reply: *"There has been no neglect of recitations or rites."* If illness is present, they respond according to the disciple’s concern. If the disciple has transgressed, the teacher addresses it first: *"You have committed such-and-such; let my admonishment guide your correction."* The disciple bows in gratitude: *"My lack of self-discipline has troubled you to instruct me."* They bow again: *"From this day forward, I shall not repeat this offense."* If the meeting occurs before a fast, a meal is prepared. Afterward, no further arrangements are made, and the disciple takes leave with two bows: *"May the teacher cherish themselves."* The teacher admonishes in return: *"Wherever you reside, diligently observe fasts and precepts, guard yourself with vigilance, and never succumb to arrogance."* The disciple assents and retreats, turning away only after three steps, never entering another chamber. Upon returning to their abbey, they relay the teacher’s instructions to all, senior and junior alike, without concealment. If a female official lacks a senior master or cannot transmit teachings, she may seek instruction from a male official. If a female official of high virtue exists, male officials may also visit her to receive teachings. The etiquette of bowing and rising applies equally to men and women.

**Question:** If Daoist priests or female officials are disrespected or bullied by laypeople without just cause, how should they respond?

**Answer:** If Daoist priests or female officials are unjustly bullied by laypeople, they should inform their parents, siblings, or influential figures in the village to serve as external protectors. If the Daoist or female official has committed an offense, they must report it to the community, who will administer punishment according to the precepts. If the offender refuses correction, they shall be handed over to the king.

**Question:** When the Heavenly Worthy first attained enlightenment, he permitted men to leave the household life. How, then, did women come to enter the Dao?

**Answer:** The Heavenly Worthy, through the pure faith of a devoted couple, achieved fruition in the Dao and became the Primordial Beginning. He then allowed both men and women to leave the household life. His wife, having attained the fruit of realization, was honored as the Lady of Golden Luminance, and women were thus permitted to enter the Dao in succession. After the transmission of scriptures and precepts, senior female officials, upon seeing men enter the Dao and receive the natural teachings of Laozi, must pay reverence and guide them according to the Dharma, for they perpetuate the sacred lineage. If they observe faults, they should offer gentle admonishment, never resorting to scolding or slander. When ordaining young register-holders, one must bow to senior female officials out of respect for the Dharma.

**Question:** How should young boys and girls who uphold the scriptures and precepts be ordained under royal decree? After ordination, should they pay filial respect to their parents?

**Answer:** To perpetuate the sacred lineage and protect the entry of men and women into the Dao, one must select those who are upright, kind, and devout. The master first tests and trains them; if their ten practices are exemplary, they may be permitted to study and cultivate.

Under royal decree and in accordance with the king’s statutes, once the candidates are deemed fit for ordination, a grand and solemn altar of the Dao shall be prepared in the manner of the *Great Vision*. The altar shall be adorned with orchid and bamboo ornaments, following the *Rite of Illuminating the True and Removing Transgressions*. The male and female ordinands shall be assembled to the south of the altar, standing in two rows according to their respective sides. The supervising officials shall stand in a horizontal line facing south, with a senior *Dadong* master positioned before them. A table and mat shall be set, incense lit, and the master shall intone the hymn of praise:

*"Great Sage, revered by gods and men,*
*Honored through the ages past.*
*Now a treasure rare appears—*
*Our great king, of boundless grace.*
*With compassion’s heart he turns,*
*Guiding all to the true Way.*
*Entering the true Way thus,*
*Is by royal favor won.*
*Forever free from worldly ties,*
*Ever seeking sacred ground.*
*Surely shall they gain the Dao’s great blessings,*
*Together striving toward the formless true."*

After the hymn, the master shall address the newly ordained, saying: "From this day forth, you shall pay reverence to the sages and the perfected, forever parting from worldly kin. Each of you shall perform three bows, marking your separation from the secular." The first bow shall be to the king and sovereign, whose virtue and grace are boundless; the second to the provincial and county officials, in gratitude for their ordaining grace; the third to one’s living and deceased parents, for granting the chance to leave the household life. After the three bows, the master shall present the robes and headdress to each newly ordained, saying: "Great indeed is the sagely transformation, infinite in reach. The stars shall be your crown, the sun and moon your garments. Follow heaven’s Way, never straying from the four seasons. Broadly deliver all beings, seeking to transcend the three realms."

The master shall then command the assembly to universally chant *shan* and snap their fingers three times. The senior members shall likewise chant *shan* and snap their fingers three times in unison. Afterward, the ordinands shall don their ritual robes. Once robed, the officials shall proceed with the incense offering as prescribed, circumambulating the altar three times, led by the senior members. Upon concluding the rites, the feast shall be offered. After the feast, each shall express gratitude to their fellow practitioners. Beginning with the eldest and proceeding to the youngest, parents and siblings shall take their seats, and all shall bow to the newly ordained. The parents shall address their sons and daughters as *disciples*, vowing that after the master attains the Dao, they too shall enter the realm of the true and perfected.

**Question:** After leaving the household life, from youth to old age, what are the hierarchical ranks?

**Answer:** Those who leave the household life are divided into five ranks: from ages seven to eleven, they are called *Puche Daoists*; from twelve to fourteen, *Zhuxie Daoists*; from fifteen to nineteen, *Chenshi Daoists*; from twenty to sixty, *Honghu Daoists*; and from seventy to ninety, *Zhuchi Daoists*.

**Question:** What is the essence of the Three Vehicles of the Dao?

**Answer:** First, the *Lesser Vehicle*: those who dwell in secluded mountains and forests, cultivating and cherishing themselves. Second, the *Middle Vehicle*: those whose virtue and grace run deep, enabling them to broadly deliver beings. Third, the *Greater Vehicle*: those who forget merit and renounce self-interest, making vast and solemn vows.

**Statute:** To encourage others—men and women alike—to offer their own children to leave the household life is a merit surpassing even the construction of as many worlds as motes of dust. Even the merit of erecting banners and canopies to adorn the realm of the Three Clarities cannot compare to the merit of encouraging others to leave the household life.

**Statute:** Both Daoists and lay followers who create scriptures and images: when laypeople revere them, using gold, wood, bronze, or pigments to replicate the sacred forms and enshrine them with devotion, this is called *creating images*.

**Statute:** If one who has piously offered fields, dwellings, gardens, or groves finds them seized by others, the original donor shall be informed, allowing them to reclaim and reallocate the property.

**Statute:** Those who leave the household life are distinct from the laity, yet illness and death follow no fixed law. When one falls ill, rites should be observed: incense must be burned and scriptures recited without cease, day and night. At the moment of passing, the *wu-chang* chime is struck to send forth the spirit. The Five Refining Corpse Rites are to be followed, lest the affliction persist. The monastic assembly should frequently visit the sick, inspect the kitchen, and ensure meals are prepared for the ailing. In times of illness, few comprehend the approach of death; when one’s karmic fortune wanes, they may seek to flee east or west. Such actions arise from the absence of prior merit, driven by last-minute fear—merely hastening death. Instead, the chamber should be swept clean and the quarters opened wide. Let those of virtuous understanding come and go, offering teachings on impermanence. If one clings to dwelling, death is certain; when the breath falters, they may be moved to the Hall of Transformation. This hall should be established in the northwest corner of the abbey, a three-bay structure with five beams, its facade facing northwest. Within, a high seat is prepared, upon which a celestial image is crafted—its form seated upon a lotus, human in size, the left hand raised to point toward the Gate of Heaven, flanked by two Perfected Ones. When a sick person’s end nears, they are placed behind the image’s seat. A yellow silk banner, twenty-four feet long, is draped so that its tip rests at the waist of the left Perfected One, while the banner’s head is placed in the dying person’s hand. This guides their mind to focus on the upright thought, aspiring to ascend with the Two Perfected through the Gate of Heaven to the Golden Palace. If they are not yet destined to depart, their merit is dedicated to the field of blessings: men face the left Perfected, women the right. Few who enter this hall leave in peace; at life’s end, all claim no distress, yet this is but attachment to life. The wise, who understand destiny, do not fixate on going or staying.

**Statute:** When traveling abroad, one must seek good companions, observing ten principles: first, choose a trusted friend; second, ensure right view; third, mutual understanding; fourth, shared concern in suffering; fifth, learning from one another’s joys; sixth, maintaining dignified conduct; seventh, disciplined movement; eighth, bowing to all encountered; ninth, reverence with utmost devotion; tenth, proper conduct in advance and retreat. Only then may they journey together.

**Statute:** When Daoist disciples or visiting guests arrive, regardless of status, each must be accommodated. First, provide lodging; next, furnish necessities; third, instruct them to join the assembly for worship; fourth, teach the taboos of the abbey; fifth, advise on where to go and what to avoid.

**Statute:** When lay devotees enter the abbey to lodge, fast, listen to the Dao, attend assemblies, or make offerings, they must maintain purity, free from the taint of garlic, onions, alcohol, or strong odors. Their attire should be neat, their demeanor humble and reverent. Upon entering, they first bow to the Heavenly Worthy, then to the great masters, and finally to the novice Daoists. Once inside, they must uphold reverence. If attending daily fasts or lectures, which occur at the two fixed times, they should bow to the Heavenly Worthy at the altar before taking their seat. Laywomen who come must adhere to the same rules, refraining from laughter, frivolity, or adornment with cosmetics, makeup, or painted brows. They should maintain solemn composure, listen to the wondrous Dao, offer incense, make vows, and together aspire to enlightenment.

**Statute:** When laypeople lodge in the abbey, they may not sleep or sit on the monks’ regular beds but must use a separate guest bed. When resting, they may not remove their clothes or expose their bodies.

**Statute:** No virtue surpasses filial piety. Serving one’s parents, teachers, and masters with warmth and care is the greatest kindness. Encouraging others to do good yields equal merit. If parents are impoverished, elderly, ill, or deceased, lacking clothing, food, medicine, tea, or offerings, one must provide and arrange for them. If parents do not revere the Three Treasures, one should gently persuade them to gain the blessings of the Dao.

**Question:** How should laypeople be instructed when observing fasts?
**Answer:** For those entering a fast, begin with the six fast days: the 1st, 8th, 15th, 28th, and 29th of the lunar month. If they progress, add the eight fast days: the 1st, 14th, 15th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, and 29th. If they advance further, introduce the ten direct fast days: the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th. For greater commitment, teach the Three Yuan Fasts of the 1st, 7th, and 10th months. For the utmost dedication, instruct the six fast months of the year: the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th months. Before fasting, one must first receive the precepts. The precepts arise from the three karmic actions: bodily, verbal, and mental. Bodily transgressions are three: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Verbal transgressions are four: false speech, frivolous talk, divisive words, and harsh language. Mental transgressions are three: greed, anger, and delusion. These ten precepts stem from the roots of the three karmic actions and must be guarded first.

**Question:** What is the proper order for fasting meals?
**Answer:** For regular fasts, one kitchen supervisor is appointed to inspect the head cook and the vegetables, ensuring the preparation of raw and cooked foods, their color, and flavor are all appropriate. Next, observe the gnomon’s shadow to determine the time; if the sky is overcast, use a water clock to fix the fasting hour. At the appointed time, the bell is rung to summon the meal. Each person brings their eating utensils to the fasting hall and places them according to their seat. After the bell is silenced, the circumambulation and hymns conclude, and all sit in order. Water is served once, then the meal is distributed, beginning with the first portion.

Rank and seniority must be observed in order. First, the offering is presented to the former masters, with the kitchen supervisor kneeling to raise the tray before the seat of the former masters. A single strike of the chime bowl at the head of the assembly signals the senior venerable to recite the incantation: "This fast is established for the true Dao, the seeds of the Dao, the Father of the Dao, the Mother of the Dao, the Perfected, the Divine, the Immortals, the Sages—all gathered to partake of the Dao together, to share in this meal, and to attain boundless longevity." When the recitation concludes, the tray is first lowered before the former masters, then before the fasting assembly. The names of the vegetables and foods are announced aloud to the assembly, and each person holds their utensils to receive their portion. If one does not require something, it should not be taken.

The senior venerable surveys the meal, ensuring it is distributed evenly to all. Once the round is complete, a single strike of the chime bowl signals: "Please begin eating." The assembly sits in orderly silence, without speech or laughter, to partake of the meal. While eating, one must not smack their lips, make slurping sounds, spit, sigh, exhale audibly, clink utensils against bowls, or clatter chopsticks. The senior seat eats slowly, waiting for the distribution of food, which is served three times in order from the highest to the lowest. When the meal is finished, the utensils are collected from the lowest to the highest.

Food is to be received only at the proper time; it may not be demanded out of turn. As the fast nears its end, the leftover rice is gathered and scattered for all beings. Those who are not kitchen supervisors may not enter the kitchen to make demands. If the meal is insufficient for the fast, one must eat outside the hall. Forcing entry into the fasting hall is called "disrupting the meal." Leaving before the assembly has finished eating is called "disturbing the seat."

For those observing a long-term fast without a former master’s offering, the incantation is recited as follows. After the incantation for the rice of all beings concludes, water is served once more, followed by a final round of rinsing. When all have gathered their utensils, a single strike of the chime bowl is sounded, and it is announced: "The fasting meal is complete. You may now rest as you wish." The senior venerable then carries the utensils out of the hall, returning to their quarters to wash and rinse. The kitchen supervisor inspects the kitchen to ensure no one remains behind.

Those who violate any of the above rules shall each perform twenty prostrations before the assembly as penance.

For fasts attended by laypeople, the procedures for sitting, rising, and receiving food remain the same. However, all offered fruits must be accepted to prevent laypeople from developing preferences. After the meal, any remaining food or fruit is placed before the assembly. A single strike of the chime bowl signals the announcement: "The leftovers from the assembly’s fast may be used freely by the host." Those who agree remain silent; those who disagree may speak. After three announcements, if the fasting officer has elderly or ailing parents or teachers, they may take the remaining fruit, rising to declare: "[Name] has elderly or ailing parents or teachers and wishes to take this fruit home as an offering." The senior venerable responds: "You may take it." Otherwise, the host may keep the leftovers for their household’s free use.

**Question:** Should leftover food for all beings be set out during the fast?
**Answer:** When the world of the worthy first emerged, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Perfected of the Dao to descend and teach, tasting the hundred herbs to discover the five grains and sustain human life. All hungry ghosts lack the merit of cultivation. During the fast, each person sets out seven grains of rice, a virtuous offering from the Perfected to all beings. This is also called "Shennong’s rice" or "the rice of all beings." A single grain can satiate a being for a thousand days.

The regulations state: Those who have left the household must conduct themselves in word and deed to avoid reproach or suspicion. Practitioners of the Dharma must not speak of killing with killing intent, nor of lust with lustful intent, nor of theft with thieving intent. Any improper conduct must be concealed.

The regulations state: As the age of the Sages recedes, beings long for their presence. One may focus the mind to inspire reverence and faith in all beings. Temples, halls, palaces, towers, and pavilions may be constructed and adorned with carvings and paintings. Statues of the Ten Directions’ Celestial Worthies, Perfected Immortals, and Sages—whether of gold, bronze, iron, clay, wood, or painted—may be made according to one’s ability, along with banners, ritual implements, and musical instruments for various offerings. If, over time, these are damaged by insects, rats, bird droppings, filth, or the trampling of oxen and horses, those with reverence and faith may repair them with their own hands or hire artisans to restore and reinstall them. This surpasses the merit of the original creators, for it renews others’ reverence and continues the foundation laid by predecessors.

The regulations state: Morning and evening prostrations to the Three Treasures should be performed on a prostration board. During circumambulation, one may use a mat laid on the ground. If no mat is available while traveling, one may prostrate directly on the ground. When prostrating on the ground, the fingers may be bent so the backs of the fingers touch the earth, preventing dust from soiling the palms—this is called "protecting purity." Prostrating on high, wide, long, or square beds is improper and deeply disrespectful. Even in the presence of worldly nobility, one must observe proper decorum; how much more so when paying homage to the Perfected and Sages? To address them from a bed incurs a hundred days of karmic retribution in darkness.

The regulations state: Before the revered images, one stands in the presence of the Perfected and the Sages. Even before worldly officials, one dare not slouch; how much less before the Eight Perfected and Seven Sages? To display arrogance in posture, speak loudly, interrupt others, glare angrily, or recline carelessly incurs karmic retribution and undermines the reverence of laypeople.

The regulations state: In households observing fasts, a day in advance, a long pole is erected before the gate with ten large banners hanging from it, marking the entrance to signify the renunciation of worldly attachments and the cultivation of seclusion.

The regulations state: Those who have left the household must always uphold loyalty and integrity, prioritizing correctness in all actions. First, correct oneself; second, correct one’s disciples and followers; third, correct the high and low within the temple; fourth, correct the distant Dharma assembly; fifth, correct the obstinate among laypeople.

To rectify one’s own conduct as a model for others is to rectify one’s disciples, ensuring they receive instruction with proper decorum; to rectify all within the temple, great and small, so they follow in harmony; to rectify the distant Dharma assembly, that the teachings may be praised afar; and to rectify the obstinate among laypeople, broadening their understanding and kindness. One who can do this is called a Daoist.

If one’s own conduct is not upright, one becomes an object of aversion. Disciples show no respect, and the master is held in contempt. Within the temple, rules and taboos are disregarded, hierarchy is confused, and trust and righteousness are absent. The distant assembly grows resentful, deceiving and oppressing the ignorant, cultivating a field of transgression. Instead of establishing authority and benevolence, one lures away the disciples, servants, or slaves of others, coveting their possessions or engaging in clandestine dealings, forsaking righteousness and perpetually acting with perversity. Those who exhibit such behavior—escaping duties, harboring malice—are to be guarded against and admonished. Should they refuse correction, the law of the king shall apply.

The regulations state: If one who has left the household returns to lay life—if they have parents, they may return to their parents’ hall but must reside in a separate bed and not share a bed with laypeople. If their parents are ill, they may assist in their care. If they have no parents, they may enter the guest hall to attend to all, great and small, but must not raise their voice in anger, engage in worldly jest or mockery, or mingle with men and women, staying overnight—all of which violate the precepts.

The regulations state: To withdraw for a full cycle of twelve years is to withdraw for three hundred days. To reduce by ten years is to reduce by ten days.

The regulations state: When visiting one’s master or a great virtue, one must bow three times and stand in attendance. When invited to sit, one bows before sitting. If further inquiry is made, one rises to answer, standing upright with feet together and hands clasped.

The regulations state: In the duties of a disciple performing sweeping, the dustpan must be placed upon the broom. Both are carried under the arm when approaching. There are five rules: first, when sweeping, gather dust with the sleeve and brush it away; second, erase traces so no marks remain, avoiding impurity; third, do not turn one’s back to elders, lest disrespect arise; fourth, the dustpan must face forward when removing waste; fifth, return the broom and dustpan to their proper place. Failure to comply violates the regulations.

The regulations state: In the duties of a disciple serving their master, when passing or receiving objects—if the master stands, one leans forward to receive; if the master sits, one kneels to receive.

The regulations state: When entering the room of an honored one, if one knows they are within—whether in the chamber or storeroom—and hears no sound, one should cough to announce their presence. If there is no response, one retreats. If asked, one states their name and seeks permission. If bidden to enter, one enters; if the door is open, one opens it; if closed, one closes it. Upon entering, one gazes directly at the honored one—glancing sideways violates the regulations.

The regulations state: When a disciple attends their master and a guest arrives, they must first dust and arrange the bed, mat, pillow, and bedding, then sweep the area before and after. Only after informing the master and receiving permission may they invite the guest in.

The regulations state: When a disciple has something to report, whether to their master, fellow temple residents, or external great virtues, they must adjust their attire and approach the room. If the door is closed, they lightly tap it three times with a bent finger. After a brief pause, if no response is heard, they tap three more times—nine taps in total. If still no response, they retreat.

The regulations state: When a master or great virtue returns from afar, they should send a messenger ahead to the temple to announce their arrival. Disciples must then adjust their attire and go forth to welcome them, gazing intently to avoid startling or catching them unawares.

The regulations state: Upon encountering one’s master or an elder acquaintance on the road, one must step aside to the leeward, avoiding crossing their path. One bows deeply, and if spoken to, responds; if not, one retreats.

The regulations state: When accompanying an honored one in travel, one must carry their staff, shoes, and other belongings. When ascending heights or traversing perilous terrain, one attends closely to their left or right, offering support with both hands—never straying far. The elderly and the young are to be treated differently.

The regulations state: In the duties of a disciple, when departing, one must inform their master; upon returning, one must offer greetings and inquire after all, high and low, before resuming regular duties.

The regulations state: When the assembly is in doubt, I do not insist on my own way. When the assembly deliberates, I examine carefully. When the assembly acts independently, I follow their lead. When the assembly travels, I do not defy custom. I remain humble and deferential, honoring my elders.

The regulations state: The method for a master or great virtue to guide the assembly is to establish dignity with magnanimity, restrain the many with compassion, conduct affairs with reverence and diligence, and perform morning practices with solemn respect. Above, one must be impartial, avoiding partiality; below, one must ensure no resentment arises. Such is the way of the great virtue.

The regulations state: If one achieves good conduct, one should share it with those below, not claiming it solely for oneself.

The regulations state: Those who study the Dao do not expose the faults of others, do not boast of their own abilities, do not reject others’ admonitions, and do not harbor resentment.

The regulations state: During the Daoist rites, after the host has paid homage to the Three Treasures and offered incense into the censer, they kneel with hands clasped before the Dharma master. The Dharma master takes the incense three times and recites the incantation: *"May the host’s seven generations of ancestors escape the long night, behold the light, have disasters dispelled and blessings descend, and ascend from death to immortality."* The rite of offering incense then proceeds.

The regulations state: At the midday meal, recite the incantation: *"The Two Mysteries ascend the Dao, the Four Poles are pure and cool. The Supreme One, the Emperor Lord, and the Hundred Spirits of Huangning receive sustenance in the Three Palaces, irrigating the spirit of the spleen. Above, they partake of the Great Harmony, consuming the five flavors. The life of the soul and embryo, the seven fluids flow and settle. The hundred passages are harmonized, the five viscera flourish. The Twin Sovereigns merge with the radiance, soaring to the Upper Clarity."*

The regulations state: When serving a meal during a fast, recite the incantation: *"Today is an auspicious day, fasting and facing the Supreme. The celestial kitchen serves the midday meal—may the host’s blessings be boundless."*

The regulations state: When offering the first portion to the former masters, recite the incantation: *"Establishing the fast for the true Dao, for the seed of Dao, the father of Dao, the mother of Dao, the perfected, the divine, the immortals, the sages—or together for the Dao—may we share this meal and attain limitless longevity."*

The regulations state: When offering the meal for all beings, recite the incantation:
*"Diligently cultivating the great Daoist dharma,
With utmost sincerity, we move the Supreme Darkness.
The true descends, demonic illusions scatter,
All malevolent spirits vanish without form.
The seven ancestors are born in the Southern Palace,
The self ascends to the Upper Clarity.
As blessings are universally bestowed,
We offer this dharma-meal to all beings."*

The regulations state: When consuming congee, recite the incantation:
*"Today is pure and serene,
Consuming the immortal’s provisions.
Burning incense and partaking of porridge,
Lifespan extends without end."*
It is also said:
*"Qian, Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen—
The body is the great Dharma King.
Congee enters the belly,
The five viscera become cool and clear."*

The mouth-rinsing incantation states:
*"The willow twig cleanses the mouth, brightening the eyes,
May I obtain a branch to offer to the great Dao.
The Dao resides in a single tree, fragrant with many names,
May I dedicate body and mind to the Three Treasures."*

The regulations state: Those who leave the household to follow the Dao differ from the secular world. These are our Dharma disciples—we must mutually conceal faults and promote goodness, reciprocating kindness, so that near and far may praise and deeply believe.

It is said: In the world, good people are few, while the unvirtuous are many. People today nitpick flaws, slandering and envying one another, unaware of their own faults yet eager to condemn others’ wrongs. Even if one performs a single good deed, they vie to slander it, unwilling to reform themselves and embrace goodness. Instead, they seek to corrupt the good to match their own wickedness, thus destroying the Dao and its dharma—all due to such people. The great and virtuous masters have strictly admonished this.

The regulations state: Stealing objects meant for sacred images is a sin equal to the ten evils. If one steals from another’s household, files a complaint along the way, and then takes the property for oneself, they will be subjected to the Eight Gates’ long trials, trapped for ten thousand kalpas without escape.

The regulations state: Stealing offerings from the ten directions meant for the assembly, or if one serves as the leader and privately takes them for oneself, they will fall into the Hell of Fire Pits, remaining for ten thousand kalpas before emerging, only to enter Fengdu for sixty years of trials, forever reborn as a hungry ghost.

The regulations state: Those with malicious speech and crimson tongues, forming gangs of wicked followers, should always be kept at a distance. If circumstances force an encounter, one must align words with the heart. Failure to do so will bring severe calamity.

The regulations state: For those who follow the Dao, any deficiency in demeanor constitutes a violation of the precepts. This is shown to you—may you understand and heed it carefully.

The Immortal Duke, having received the regulations, bows and retires.

*The Dongxuan Lingbao Qianzhen Regulations conclude.*
