**The Upper Clarity Jade Palace Numinous Flight Six Jia Register**

The Upper Clarity Jade Palace’s Numinous Flight Six Jia Jade Maidens—sixty in number—their taboo names, characters, and left-and-right talismans, were transmitted by the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate of the Supreme Nine Capitals of the Grand Realized One, who received them from the Most High Jade Dawn Lofty Sage Dao Lord.

The left-and-right Numinous Flight Six Jia Talismans are also called *The Jade Essence True Formula*, *The Way Within the Radiance*, *The Hidden Travels Scripture of White Feathers and Black Pinions*, and *The Divine Way of the Numinous Flight Six Jia*.

The deities of the Six Jia ride six dragons at times, feasting upon rosy clouds, gazing upon the Six Directions, and descending in turn to the bedchamber of the talisman-bearer. On the eight solar terms, they ride chariots drawn by white simurghs and black-plumed phoenixes, feasting in the inverted light of Eternal Yang, surveying the divine peaks of the Eight Directions. Descending into the body of the talisman-bearer, they harmonize hun and po, open the numinous and penetrate form, blend the Three Qi into incense, and make the Five Viscera bloom with radiance. They enable sitting in death and standing in oblivion, command the myriad demons, tread upon blades and traverse peril, summon all spirits to harmony, cross mountains and enter waters, traverse seas and stride rivers—unwearied by bridges or beams, unafraid of cliffs or dangers. They effect transformations and concealments, summon winds and call forth thunder, instantly raise clouds and rain, and manifest traveling kitchens. Entering battle, one remains unharmed; entering water, one stays dry. Mountain spirits offer protection; Jade Maidens come to welcome. After six years of wearing the talismans, the Six Jia manifest in bodily form, speaking with the bearer, bestowing true scriptures, and granting longevity coeval with Heaven and Earth, their dual symbols in perfect accord.

Maintain a separate bedchamber, avoid impurity, forsake lust and forget desire. Still the heart and mirror the form—only then may one seek this Way.

The Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate declare: The Six Qi flow in sequence through the Ten Heavens; the Six Jia traverse the hidden and dark. Possessing their talismans, one may conceal and transform without limit. Hearing their names, one may ascend to replenish the Heavenly Perfected. Practicing their Way, one may fly through the void and ride the radiance. Wearing their script, Jade Maidens hold one’s towels.

After six years of use, the Azure Palace records one’s name on jade tablets. After nine years, the myriad spirits offer protection, and Perfected Ones build one’s chamber. After fourteen years, the Three Primordials of the Grand Simplicity welcome one with feathered tablets of the Three Dawns, clad in cloud robes of purple blossoms. At dusk, one rides the Eight Effulgences; at dawn, one ascends Kunlun. Waving tiger banners to summon the ranks, blowing phoenix flutes to chant the Mysterious, the myriad spirits support one’s carriage, commanding winds and summoning clouds. The Great One shares the reins; one ascends the Dawn in broad daylight.

The left-and-right Jade Maidens of the Numinous Flight Six Jia—sixty in number, with names and characters—on each Jia day at dawn, face the kingly direction, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia for that ten-day period, all arrayed before one, their garments, forms, and colors as described above. After a long while, knock the teeth six times, swallow saliva sixty times, then softly recite the incantation:

*Left flight, right numen,*
*Eight Effulgences’ blossoming essence,*
*Above planted in the jade chamber,*
*Below flourishing with cinnabar and jasper.*
*Harmonizing the Eight Measures,*
*Governing the myriad sprouts.*
*Divine potency accumulates resonance,*
*The Six Qi refine and purify.*
*Cloud Palace’s jade blossoms,*
*Riding the void in accord with life.*
*Brocade sashes, crimson skirts,*
*Rosy glow suffusing the purple chamber.*
*Tiger-script waistbands,*
*Feathered nets and azure standards.*
*Holding divine talismans,*
*Flowing gold and fire bells.*
*Warding off evil, repelling demons,*
*Preserving my fortune and integrity.*
*Severing and restraining the host of fiends,*
*Dissolving the myriad evils into peace.*
*Roaming the Three Origins together,*
*Reversing age to return to infancy.*
*Sitting in death, standing in oblivion,*
*Attending me with the Six Dings.*
*Fierce beasts guard my body,*
*Heavenly soldiers follow.*
*Breathing in rivers and seas,*
*Mountains and peaks flow and topple.*
*Instantly manifesting traveling kitchens,*
*Golden liquors and jade nectars.*
*Binding and capturing tigers and leopards,*
*Shouting into the hidden and dark,*
*Commanding and subduing ghosts and spirits,*
*Seizing and taming the thousand essences.*
*All wishes follow the heart,*
*Ten thousand affairs achieve success.*
*Dispersing the Way, scattering the body,*
*Freely transforming form at will.*
*Ascending to replenish the Perfected,*
*Coeval with Heaven and Earth.*
*Ears keen, eyes bright,*
*Penetrating vision of the Yellow Court.*
*Six Jia Jade Maidens,*
*Become my envoys and servants.*

When the incantation is finished, close the eyes.

At the outset of visualization, sit upright with hands resting upon the knees, ensuring no one witnesses this—if seen, the true radiance will scatter, and thoughts will dissipate, harming the focus. Maintain unwavering concentration, allowing no other thoughts to intrude; this must be strictly observed.

Before ingesting the talisman, first invoke the name of the Jade Maiden of the current day, then softly recite the incantation:
*"Heaven’s mystery, Earth’s yellow,
Primordial Void’s Six Qi,
At dawn consume the numinous essence,
Divine tiger-script of spirit-gold.
Let my Perfected be thus,
Let my gods be thus,
Dispersing form and shadow,
Sealing mountains to summon the numinous,
Commanding the ten thousand essences,
Sitting in dissolution, standing in existence,
Soaring high in the Upper Clarity,
Facing north to attend the Jade Dawn."*

After reciting, ingest the talisman. The essential talisman script is as follows (all talismans to be inscribed in cinnabar):

The Jade Maidens wear purple sashes, black-trimmed crimson robes with red silk borders, azure skirts, and yellow silk talismans. The Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Formula’s upper talisman is first taken on the *jiazi* day, twice daily—once at dawn for men, and again at midday on the Eight Seasonal Nodes. The Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Formula’s upper talisman is first taken on the *yichou* day, twice daily—once at dawn for women, and again at midnight on the Eight Seasonal Nodes. These two talismans are the ancestral talismans of the *Lingfei* Six *Jia* system. Before ingesting the talismans, one must first purify for six days. After sixty days, one may then ingest the sixty Jade Maiden talismans. These two talismans summon spirits and open numinous insight, connecting with the myriad essences. If taken continuously without cessation, one ascends as an immortal and attains longevity. Having ingested the sixty Jade Maiden talismans, one should then employ these talismans while cultivating them in tandem. Men and women each use the talismans corresponding to their names. One must avoid defilement, passing through homes of the deceased, sharing beds with others, or lending one’s clothing. Abstain from the Five Pungent Foods and the meat of the Six Domestic Animals. Especially avoid proximity to women, for it severely harms the spirit, scatters the soul, breeds perversity, and disrupts one’s nature—bringing calamity for three generations and relegating one to the ranks of the lowest ghosts after death. Always burn incense at the head of one’s bed.

The Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery *Jiazi* Palace all wear upper garments of dark brocade and lower skirts of azure silk with flying floral patterns. The Jade Maidens of the Yellow Simplicity *Jiaxu* Palace all wear upper garments of yellow brocade and lower skirts of purple silk with flying feather patterns. The Jade Maidens of the Supreme Simplicity *Jiashen* Palace all wear upper garments of white brocade and lower skirts of cinnabar silk with flying floral patterns. The Jade Maidens of the *Jiawu* Crimson Cloud Palace all wear upper garments of cinnabar brocade and lower skirts of azure silk with flying patterns.

The attire of the *Lingfei* Six *Jia* Jade Maidens includes holding the Jade Essence Spirit Tiger Talisman in hand, with hair styled in a three-cornered cloud bun, the rest left loose to the waist.

The Jade Maidens of the *Jiachen* Worship Essence Palace all wear upper garments of purple brocade and lower skirts of jade-green silk with flying floral patterns. The Jade Maidens of the *Jiayin* Azure Essentials Palace all wear upper garments of purple brocade and lower skirts of cinnabar-azure silk with flying patterns.

The attire of the *Lingfei* Six *Jia* Jade Maidens includes holding the Jade Essence Golden Tiger Talisman in hand, with hair styled in a three-cornered cloud bun, the rest left loose to the waist.

The sixty-two talismans above were transmitted by the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace, who received them from the Most High Lord of the Great Dao. Upon receiving them, one must purify with utmost sincerity, cleanse the Five Burdens, dispel the filth of worldly leakage, and sever the excesses of lust. Focus the eyes on the Six Essences, concentrate the mind on the Jade Perfected, let incense smoke suffuse the chamber, and seclude oneself in a solitary room. Accumulate merit and virtue, harmonize the soul, and guard the center. By emulating the Five Dao Spirits who generate the Three Palaces, transcending the struggles of the mundane, and abiding in stillness to achieve resonance—within a year, the spirits of the Six *Jia* will descend and manifest.

If one can cultivate this Dao with precision, one will surely ascend as an immortal. Those who believe and uphold it become numinous beings; those who disbelieve will perish and join the ranks of ghosts. The Dao of the *Lingfei* Six *Jia*’s Numinous Radiance must be transmitted only to those of utmost authenticity, for it swiftly brings communion and descent, and the *Lingfei* easily takes flight. With prolonged diligent cultivation, one may vanish while sitting or standing, achieve longevity, and master myriad transformations, with traveling kitchens arriving at will.

The Perfected of Mount Jiuyi, Xu Weiyuan, once received this method from Song Dexuan of the Central Marchmount. Dexuan lived during the reign of the Zhou king and, having ingested the *Lingfei* Six *Jia* talismans, attained the Dao. He could traverse three thousand *li* in a day, transform into birds and beasts at will, and master the Dao of the True Spirits. Originally dwelling on Mount Song, Weiyuan followed him for a long time before receiving this method. After cultivating it to fruition, he now resides on Mount Jiuyi. Women such as Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, and Wang Lulian, along with dozens of others, all received this method and attained the Dao. Some roam the Dark Continent, while others dwell on the Eastern Florescence Terrace of Fangzhu; today, they reside on the Southern Marchmount.

Lady Wei remarked: This Guo Shaoyao was the son of Guo Qian, the Han Dynasty’s General Who Pacified Liaodong from Yangping. From youth, he was devoted and sincere, and the Perfected transmitted the Six *Jia* to him. Zhao Aier was the niece of Zhao Gai, the Chief Clerk to Liu Yu, the Governor of Youzhou. Fond of the Dao, she attained liberation from the corpse after death and later received these talismans. Wang Lulian was the daughter of Wang Bogang, the City Gate Commandant of Fanling during the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei. She also studied the Dao and one day suddenly abandoned her husband, Li Ziqi. Li Ziqi, a descendant of the Prince of Qinghe from Wei in Sizhou, often spoke of his wife’s erratic behavior before she vanished without a trace.

The *Lingfei* Six *Jia*’s method of concealment involves ingesting these true talismans to roam the eight directions. Those who practice this true scripture must find the right person. According to the *Mingke* of the Four Poles, those who transmit the Upper Clarity inner scriptures must first take oaths in a covenant before dissemination. Over seven hundred years, it has been transmitted to no more than six people, with strict limits to prevent leakage. Before receiving the talismans, one must fast for seven days and present incense and offerings to a master who possesses the scriptures. Provide sixty feet of white silk, six pairs of golden rings, and six *liang* of green silk as substitutes for cutting hair and ascending the altar, swearing blood oaths and breaking contracts to pledge fidelity in upholding the talismans without leakage. Should one violate the covenant and betray trust, one willingly accepts the trials of the Wind Blade, sinks into the River of Accumulated Nights, and is crushed by the stones of Mount Meng to fill the Meng Ford. The master who possesses the scriptures must distribute the received offerings to the cold, destitute, poor, orphaned, sick, elderly, and weak, and not use them solely for personal gain. Should one fail to adhere to the regulations, the Three Officials will examine the records, and the offender will die as a lowly ghost. One must revere and be cautious of this.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity Jade Palace Lingfei Six Jia Register*.
