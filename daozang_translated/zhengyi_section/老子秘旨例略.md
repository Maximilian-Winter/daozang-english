The arising of the myriad things and the completion of all works must emerge from the formless and proceed from the nameless. The formless and nameless are the origin of the ten thousand things. Neither warm nor cool, neither gong nor shang, they cannot be heard when listened for, cannot be seen when looked for, cannot be known when embodied, cannot be tasted when savored. Thus, as a thing, they are undifferentiated; as an image, they are formless; as a sound, they are silent; as a flavor, they are without manifestation. Therefore, they serve as the origin and master of all things, embracing and pervading all without exception.

If warmth existed, it could not be cool; if gong existed, it could not be shang. Form must have its distinctions, sound must have its categories. Thus, an image that has form is not the Great Image; a sound that has tone is not the Great Sound. If the Four Images do not take form, the Great Image has nothing through which to flourish; if the Five Tones do not produce sound, the Great Sound has nothing through which to arrive. When the Four Images take form yet things have no master, the Great Image flourishes; when the Five Tones produce sound yet the mind has no attachment, the Great Sound arrives.

Thus, holding to the Great Image, the world comes forth; employing the Great Sound, customs are transformed. Though the formless flourishes and the world comes forth, it comes forth yet cannot be released. Though the silent sound arrives and customs are transformed, they are transformed yet cannot be discerned.

Therefore, Heaven generates the Five Things, yet no-thing is used. The sage practices the Five Teachings, yet no speech brings transformation. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.

The mother of the Five Things is neither hot nor cold, neither soft nor hard; the mother of the Five Teachings is neither bright nor dim, neither indulgent nor harmful. Though ancient and modern differ, and customs shift with the times, this does not change. This is what is meant by "from ancient times to the present, its name does not depart."

Without this, Heaven cannot generate things; without this, governance cannot achieve success. Thus, past and present are connected, beginning and end are the same. Holding to the ancient, one can master the present; mastering the present, one can know the beginning. This is what is called the constant.

Without the appearance of brightness or dimness, without the image of warmth or coolness—knowing the constant is called illumination. The arising of things and the completion of works all proceed from this. Thus, one surveys the multitude of beginnings.

The swiftness of lightning is still insufficient to circle in an instant; the movement of riding the wind is still insufficient to reach in a single breath. Excellence in speed lies in not hurrying; excellence in arrival lies in not traveling.

Thus, the fullness of what can be spoken is insufficient to govern Heaven and Earth; the extremity of what has form is insufficient to contain the myriad things. Therefore, those who sigh over it cannot exhaust its wonder; those who chant it cannot express its vastness. Naming it cannot capture it; describing it cannot complete it. Names must have distinctions; descriptions must have origins. With distinctions, there is incompleteness; with origins, there is insufficiency. Incompleteness severs its truth; insufficiency makes it unnameable. This can be expounded and made clear.

The Dao is that by which the myriad things proceed. The Dark is that from which the obscure emerges. The Profound is that which delves into the unfathomable without end. The Great is that which encompasses all without limit. The Remote is that which stretches into the distant without reach. The Subtle is that which lies in the minute without visibility.

Thus, the terms *Dao*, *Dark*, *Profound*, *Great*, *Subtle*, and *Remote* each have their meaning, yet none exhausts its extremity. Yet, encompassing without limit cannot be called small; subtly wondrous and formless cannot be called great. Therefore, the text designates it as *Dao* and calls it *Dark*, yet does not name it.

Thus, those who speak of it lose its constancy; those who name it depart from its truth; those who act upon it ruin its nature; those who grasp it lose its origin.

Therefore, the sage does not take speech as primary and thus does not violate its constancy; does not take names as constant and thus does not depart from its truth; does not take action as affairs and thus does not ruin its nature; does not take grasping as control and thus does not lose its origin.

Thus, the text of Laozi, when debated and expounded, loses its purport; when named and demanded, violates its meaning. Its great return lies in discussing the origin of the Great Beginning to clarify the nature of spontaneity, and in expounding the extremity of the obscure to settle the delusions of confusion.

Thus, it does not act yet nothing is left undone; it honors the root to still the branches, guards the mother to preserve the child, devalues clever techniques, acts before things arise, places no demands on others, and seeks only within oneself. This is its great essential.

Yet, the Legalists esteem uniformity and use punishments to enforce it. The Logicians esteem defining reality and use names to correct it. The Confucians esteem universal love and use praise to advance it. The Mohists esteem frugality and use rectification to establish it. The Eclectics esteem myriad virtues and use synthesis to practice them.

When form is used to regulate things, artifice and falsehood inevitably arise; when names are used to define things, principles and forgiveness are inevitably lost; when praise is used to advance things, competition and esteem inevitably arise; when rectification is used to establish things, discord and opposition inevitably occur; when synthesis is used to practice things, filth and chaos inevitably flourish. These all employ the child and abandon the mother, causing things to lose their support—such methods are insufficient to uphold.

Yet, though paths converge, their ends diverge; though destinations align, their purposes conflict. Scholars are confused by what they attain and lost in what they pursue.

Observing their uniformity, one calls it *law*;
Beholding their settled truth, one calls it *name*;
Discerning their pure love, one calls it *Confucianism*;
Examining their frugality, one calls it *Mohism*;
Witnessing their lack of attachment, one calls it *Eclecticism*.
Following what one examines, one rectifies names;
Yielding to what one favors, one clings to intentions.
Thus arise tangled, confused debates,
Divergent pursuits and contentious disputes—
all from this.

Moreover, in their writings,
they cite the end to verify the beginning,
rather than recounting the beginning to exhaust the end;
they open but do not fully disclose,
guide but do not lead.
Only by tracing does one grasp their meaning;
only by inference does one exhaust their principle.
They skillfully initiate matters to introduce their discourse,
and clarify the convergence of return to conclude their text.
Thus, those who share the same purpose and are moved by it
all admire the inception of their words and expand upon them;
those who hold divergent aims and compose independently
all delight in the signs of convergence as proof.
Though paths differ, they must share the same return;
though thoughts vary, they must align in their end.
By elevating this return and end,
they illuminate the ultimate principle.
Thus, those who reflect by analogy
all rejoice in the resonance of their thoughts,
believing they have grasped the meaning.

For all things to endure, they must revert to their form;
for achievements to succeed, they must revert to their name.
That which endures does not take endurance as endurance—
it is because it does not forget impermanence.
That which is secure does not take security as security—
it is because it does not forget peril.
Thus, those who safeguard their endurance perish;
those who do not forget impermanence endure.
Those who rest in their position are imperiled;
those who do not forget peril are secure.
One who excels in lifting the autumn down
or hearing the thunderclap
finds the Dao at odds with form.
That which is truly secure is said to be not where security resides;
that which truly endures is said to be not where endurance resides;
kings and lords are truly exalted,
yet it is said to be not where exaltation is made;
Heaven and Earth are truly vast,
yet it is said to be not where vastness is capable;
sacred works truly exist,
yet it is said to be the establishment of abolishing the sacred;
benevolent virtue is truly manifest,
yet it is said to be the abiding of abandoning benevolence.
Thus, those who see form but do not reach the Dao
all resent such words.

To determine the root of things,
one must, though near, begin from afar to verify their origin;
to clarify the source of things,
one must, though evident, begin from obscurity to trace their foundation.
Thus, one draws from beyond Heaven and Earth
to illuminate what lies within the body,
clarifies the meaning of kings and lords as orphaned and solitary,
and follows the singular Dao to proclaim its beginning.
Thus, those who examine the near but do not reach the origin of the flowing lineage
all dismiss such words as absurd, believing them empty.

Therefore, each expounds their own doctrine,
and people praise the resulting chaos.
Some find the words circuitous,
others mock the arguments—
as if enlightened yet benighted,
as if distinct yet disordered.
This is the reason.

Names serve to define the other;
terms follow what is designated.
Names arise from the other,
terms emerge from the self.
Thus, when one traverses where no thing is untouched,
it is termed the *Dao*;
when one seeks where no subtlety is unmanifest,
it is called the *Mysterious*.
Subtlety emerges from the Mysterious,
the multitude proceeds from the Dao.
Thus, to give life and nurture,
without obstruction or blockage,
to penetrate the nature of things—
this is called the Dao.
To give life yet not possess,
to act yet not rely,
to grow yet not dominate,
to have virtue yet no mastery—
this is the power of the Mysterious.
The Mysterious is called the profound;
the Dao is termed the great.
Names and designations arise from forms and appearances;
terms and appellations emerge from traversal and seeking.
Names and designations do not arise in vain,
terms and appellations do not emerge without cause.
Thus, names and designations greatly miss the essence,
terms and appellations do not exhaust the ultimate.
Therefore, to speak of the Mysterious is to say *mysterious yet again mysterious*;
to speak of the Dao is to say *within the realm, there are the Four Greats*.

The *Book of Laozi* can nearly be encapsulated in a single phrase:
Ah! To honor the root and quiet the branches—this is all.
Observe its origins,
trace its return—
words do not stray from the source,
affairs do not lose their master.
Though its text spans five thousand characters,
it is threaded by a single meaning.
Though vast and abundant, its categories share the same understanding;
to encapsulate it in a single phrase
is to leave no obscurity unrecognized.
Yet if each matter is treated as a separate intention,
though eloquent, it only deepens confusion.

Let us attempt to discuss it thus:
Does the rise of depravity stem from the deeds of the depraved?
Does the emergence of excess arise from the creations of the excessive?
Thus, to guard against depravity lies in preserving sincerity,
not in keen scrutiny.
To quell excess lies in abandoning ornamentation,
not in elaborate regulations.
To eradicate theft lies in eliminating desire,
not in severe punishments.
To halt litigation lies in not esteeming,
not in skillful adjudication.
Thus, do not attack their deeds—
make them without the heart for deeds;
do not harm their desires—
make them without the heart for desire.
Plan at the unmanifest,
act at the unbegun—
this is all.

Thus, exhausting sagely wisdom to govern artifice and falsehood
is not as good as perceiving simplicity to quiet the people’s desires;
promoting benevolence and righteousness to thicken thin customs
is not as good as embracing simplicity to preserve sincerity;
multiplying clever advantages to advance utility
is not as good as reducing self-interest to cease ostentatious competition.
Therefore, abolish surveillance,
conceal keen perception,
discard incentives,
prune ostentatious praise,
reject clever utility,
devalue treasures—
all lie in preventing the people’s loves and desires from arising,
not in attacking their depraved deeds.
Thus, perceiving simplicity to abolish sagely wisdom,
reducing self-interest to discard clever advantages—
these are called *honoring the root to quiet the branches*.

The way of simplicity is not manifest,
yet the allure of desires is not concealed.
Though one exhausts sagely brightness to scrutinize it,
or depletes wisdom and foresight to attack it,
the clever grow more refined in thought,
the false more varied in deception.
The more fiercely it is attacked,
the more diligently it is evaded.
Thus, the foolish and wise deceive one another,
the six relations grow suspicious,
simplicity scatters, truth departs,
and affairs harbor their treachery.

Abandoning the root to attack the branches—
though one exhausts sagely wisdom, this only deepens the disaster.
How much worse for those whose methods fall below this?

When governed by simplicity and plainness,
affairs naturally rectify without effort;
when attacked by sagely wisdom,
the people grow desperate and cunning flourishes.
Thus, simplicity and plainness may be embraced,
while sagely wisdom may be discarded.

When scrutiny is lax, evasion is likewise lax;
when one exhausts keen perception,
escape grows equally keen.
Laxity harms plainness little,
but strictness deepens artifice and deceit.

Are those who wield the arts of utmost scrutiny and hidden probing
only the sagely and wise?
The harm they bring—how could it be reckoned?

A hundredfold profit is not yet considered much.
If one cannot distinguish names,
one cannot speak of principles;
if one cannot fix names,
one cannot discuss realities.

All people are born from form,
yet no form is born from people.
Thus, for every name there is a corresponding form,
for every form there is its proper place.
Kindness cannot be called sageliness,
wisdom cannot be called kindness—
each has its own reality.

To perceive the subtlest traces is the utmost of clarity;
to probe hidden depths is the utmost of foresight.
Is one who exhausts utmost clarity not sagely?
Is one who exhausts utmost foresight not wise?
By examining realities and fixing names,
one may discard sageliness without confusion.

When the virtue of honest plainness is not manifest,
while the beauty of reputation and conduct is exalted,
people cultivate what is exalted in hopes of praise,
pursue what is esteemed in pursuit of profit.
Yearning for praise and profit,
they labor at their conduct—
the more their reputation shines, the more sincerity recedes;
the greater the profit, the more hearts compete.
Fathers and sons, brothers—
affection loses its truth,
filial piety cannot bear sincerity,
compassion cannot bear reality—
all summoned by the exaltation of reputation and conduct.

The worry that customs grow thin while names arise,
that exalting benevolence and righteousness only deepens deceit—
how much worse for methods that scorn these?

Thus, to abolish benevolence and discard righteousness
to restore filial piety and compassion
is not yet considered grand.

When city walls grow tall, siege engines arise;
when profit flourishes, schemes deepen.
If one abides in desirelessness,
even rewards will not tempt theft;
if private desires prevail,
clever profit only grows more obscured.
Thus, abolish cleverness and discard profit,
replace them with few desires—
then thieves will vanish,
though this is not yet worthy of praise.

Sageliness and wisdom are the finest of talents,
benevolence and righteousness the greatest of conduct,
cleverness and profit the best of utility.
If the root does not endure,
yet these three excellences arise,
the harm remains the same—
how much more for methods that, for the sake of profit,
neglect plainness?

Thus, the ancients sighed:
How profound—why are things so hard to comprehend?
One knows that the unsagely are unsagely,
yet does not know that the sagely are not sagely;
one knows that the unkind are unkind,
yet does not know that kindness is not kindness.

Only by abolishing sageliness is sagely achievement complete;
only by discarding benevolence is benevolent virtue profound.
One despises strength not because one desires weakness,
but because striving for strength loses strength;
one abolishes benevolence not because one desires unkindness,
but because practicing benevolence breeds falsity.

There is order that leads to chaos,
security that leads to danger.
Putting oneself last, one comes first—
coming first is not something the first can achieve.
Excluding oneself, one endures—
endurance is not something the enduring can effect.
Merit cannot be seized,
excellence cannot be employed.
Thus, one must grasp only the mother of merit.

The text says: knowing the child,
one must return to guard the mother.
Tracing this principle—
where does it not flow smoothly?

Laozi’s subtle purport concludes here.
