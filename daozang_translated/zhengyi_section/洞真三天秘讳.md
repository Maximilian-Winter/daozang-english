**The Esoteric Secret Taboos of the Three Heavens of the Cavern of Perfection**

For all who receive the Three and Five, first visualize the true names of the Three Heavens and the true names of the Three Masters. In times of urgent calamity, distress, or illness, loudly invoke the names of the Three Heavens thrice, and secretly call upon the names of the Three Masters—thus shall all disasters and illnesses be dispelled.

The true name of the Upper Clarity Subtle Heaven is *Fang*.
The true name of the Middle Yu-Yu Heaven is *Yuan*.
The true name of the Lower Great Red Heaven is *Deqiu*.
These are the true names of the Three Heavens.

The true name of the Left Primordial Supreme Perfected is *Yan*.
The true name of the Right Mysterious Elder Perfected is *Yi*.
The true name of the Central Supreme Perfected is *Xu*.
These are the true names of the Three Masters.

Those who know the true names of the Three Heavens and Three Masters shall attain longevity and immortality. Yet if one’s visualization is inconsistent, or if virtuous conduct is incomplete, occasional misfortunes may arise. These may be dissolved by pacing the stellar net, invoking the Celestial Tortoise’s celestial undulations, and reciting the proper incantations—all of which shall prove efficacious. One must also constantly visualize the taboo names of the Dipper Terrace; forget not, forget not.

Whenever one unfolds the stellar chart or paces the steps while visualizing, as well as upon rising at dawn or retiring at dusk, one must first knock the teeth nine times and secretly invoke the names of the Nine Stars, saying:

1. The essence of the First Great Star is named *Xuanshu*. May I, [one’s name], ascend as a flying immortal, riding the void and steering the floating.
2. The essence of the Second Primordial Star is named *Beitai*. May I, [one’s name], wander as a flying immortal upon the Terrace of the Flourishing.
3. The essence of the Third Perfected Star is named *Nine Ultimates of the Supreme Perfected*. May I, [one’s name], govern the Three Clouds as a flying immortal.
4. The essence of the Fourth Pivot Star is named *Xuan’gen*. May my name be recorded among the flying immortals.
5. The essence of the Fifth Net Star is named *Celestial Balance*. May I, [one’s name], ascend and traverse the Upper Clarity as a flying immortal.
6. The essence of the Sixth Chronicle Star is named *Destiny’s Mechanism*. May my name be inscribed in the Grand Tenuity as a flying immortal.
7. The essence of the Seventh Pass Star is named *Mysterious Yang*. May I, [one’s name], command the Jade Lads as a flying immortal.
8. The essence of the Eighth Emperor Star is named *Supreme Jade Sovereign on High*. May I, [one’s name], ascend the hall of the Latter Sage as a flying immortal.
9. The essence of the Ninth Venerable Star is named *Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity*. May I, [one’s name], enter the cinnabar-jade chamber as a flying immortal.

Upon completing these nine incantations, knock the teeth nine times. If, during the practice, fire arises within the mouth, this signifies attainment of the Dao.

When encountering malevolent ghosts or wicked persons, immediately visualize the Dipper’s stars pointing at them. Hold the breath and silently recite: *"I am the Celestial Eye, one with Heaven. I expel spirits like thunder and lightning, illuminating the eight directions, penetrating all within and without. Nothing shall resist me."* Thus shall all treacherous ghosts, myriad demons, and hosts of misfortune dare not assail you.

**The Dipper Repose Method**

The Dipper’s stars are the purple canopy of the Supreme Ultimate, the numinous palace of the Mysterious Perfected, the divine seat of the Nine Stars, and the reclining chamber of the Celestial Honored One. Those who study the Perfected receive this from the Celestial Honored One, who instructs them to repose within the Dipper. At night, while lying down, visualize the Dipper’s stars above the mat, aligning the head with the Nine Ultimates. Let the true qi enter the Mud Pill Palace, the feet tread upon the Venerable Emperor’s two stars, and the heart recite the flying immortal’s command: *"May the Supreme on High restrain my seven po, and may the Grand Tenuity govern my three hun."* Grasp the Northern Terrace with the left hand and hold the Jade Armillary with the right. After practicing this for eighteen years, one’s complexion shall revert to that of an infant. The essences of the Nine Stars shall transform into Nine Elders, all coming to welcome you, ascending at dawn into the light of day.

**For Responding to Summons to Save Others from Disasters**

When called to save others from calamity, proceed three steps outside the household gate. Stand upright, knock the teeth three times, and secretly invoke the names of the Seven Stars’ hun and po. Recite the incantation as when pacing the stellar steps, intently visualizing the divine stars. Even in haste, perform both the pacing and the incantation. Upon completion, clench the fists firmly. Thirty paces from the destination, visualize fire burning the household of the afflicted, reducing it to ashes. Advance twenty-five paces, visualize the kidneys as water, extinguishing the fire and restoring the house anew. Upon reaching the gate, knock the teeth twenty times and perform the Yu Step nine times. Enter the gate, visualizing the names of the Three Generals and their troops encircling your form. Further visualize the Five Stars’ Generals of the Five Directions, and the Four Greatnesses and Seven Stars, with the Floral Canopy covering your head. Proceed without fear. Sit facing the monthly establishment and the yearly sovereign; if this is inconvenient, first face them, hold the breath, then take your seat. If the seat aligns with the daily establishment and the yearly sovereign, it is auspicious—only avoid the *po* and *bi* days. In all movements, exits, and entries, maintain vigilance. Once seated, recite the incantation. Upon completion, instruct the host to sweep and purify the courtyard (or the hall if raining). Arrange the mat and incense fire, facing east by day and north by night. Place a basin of water before the mat, with a great blade upon it. Calculate the time according to the Dipper’s position, adding the Ghost Gate hour. The host shall present the petition, bow, and invite the Daoist, who shall gird himself, take his seat, rinse his mouth, and ignite the incense, reciting the oral scripture.

**For Expelling Evil Dreams, Ominous Portents, Death, Lingering Illness, Malevolent Persons, Public or Private Oppression, Licentiousness, Theft, and Other Banishments**

At the year’s beginning, to sever pestilence, epidemic diseases, and great plagues, or to transform and exchange qi for widespread blessings, prepare a large basin filled with water, fine sand, pebbles, and several *dou* of red beans, adjusting the quantity according to the dwelling’s size. Store these pure substances at the Ghost Gate. Perform the ritual on the six auspicious days according to the method.

During the *jiayin*旬, *xinyou* and *renxu* are inauspicious; all other days are auspicious.

Upon completion of the affair, sitting, consuming remaining food, or resting—each action has its corresponding incantation. If the illness is urgent and banishment cannot be performed, proceed to the patient’s side, recite the incantation over a bowl of water, and sprinkle it thrice to conclude. Then, visualize the divine spirits adorning your garments, face the Nine Stars, and secretly recite: *"Day remains unhurried, Sun Lady of Grand Yang, Old Lord of Supreme Yang, eyes of Zou Suo Nuo Tuo, carve into my heart. Eight thousand, also Water Mother, disciple may complete the pacing of the stellar net, descending the stars, gazing into darkness. Hover a foot above the ground, bones and joints all crimson, as if newly born. Visualize the left eye as the sun, the right as the moon. Green Dragon and White Tiger, the Five Spirits all present. Seven stars above the head, seven stars below the feet. Left hand pointing to the earth, eyes gazing at the Northern Dipper. Secretly invoke the fifteen words: Li Luo Yao Yu Su, Shen Ming Zhu Su Fan Guang Xing Tun Xuan Mao. Conclude by transforming the form with both hands."*

Adorning the jade gate as the host of stars, the mouth becomes the Slayer of Malevolence. The left hand is the Annihilator of Doom, five-headed and single-bodied; the right hand is the Punisher of Rebellion, five-headed and single-bodied, to cure illness and subdue calamities. This done, next face the Perfected One’s star and state your rank and name, respectfully declaring:

*"Supreme Lord Lao, Supreme Elder, Celestial Master, Female Master, Three Masters and Their Ladies, Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, Generals of the Three and Five—humbly, this fellow Daoist of shared bond, [surname given], has failed in devotion to the Dao and brought upon himself disaster and suffering. On account of this matter, I trace its source and lay it forth: the afflictions of father, mother, brothers, [names given], and so on. With head bowed, I come before you to beseech [request stated], to forge and refine malevolent spirits, febrile poisons, ghostly bandits. This disciple and [name given] share the same eyes and belly—no longer shall we witness such sights. Reverently following the original method of my former master, I perform this rite: may what is prayed for descend, what is summoned arrive, what is suppressed be subdued, what is seized be captured, what is executed be destroyed, what is treated be healed, what is exorcised be repelled. Solemnly, I implore the Supreme and all the Venerable Ones to bestow grace and protection, sheltering this mortal flesh."*

This declared, bow twice again.

Should one encounter official misfortune, illness, or sudden calamity, first perform the Seven Stars Rite. Facing north, raise the head to visualize the Dipper, its crimson radiance blazing forth. Cry out seven times, invoking: "Northern Dipper, Star of Such-and-Such True Name, Lord of the Kuaigang Prefecture!" Repeat this sevenfold. State the urgent matter at hand, beseeching deliverance and swift efficacy from the Lord of the Kuaigang Seven Stars and all stellar officials. Offer pure wine, incense cakes, fresh fruits, and choice delicacies as a sacrificial feast, rewarding merit and upholding vows. Depart without hesitation once the wish is granted.

Prepare seven measures of clear wine, seven measures of dried jujubes and chestnuts, and ten ounces of aloeswood. Arrange five incense burners, one for each direction, and purify the altar ground. At midnight, in a secluded place, set up the offerings in stillness. Cry out seven times to summon the Lord, then kneel, bow seven times, and present the petition. Pour wine seven times, expressing wishes as desired. Upon completion, consume the offerings on the spot, ensuring none remain. If any food is left, bury it at the altar, taking care that neither fowl nor dog sees it.

For dire emergencies, grave illness, or major exorcisms, face north and cry out three times: "Northern Dipper, Lord of the Kuaigang Prefecture! Left and Right Three Divisions, Great Generals! Tang, Ge, Zhou, Five Directions, Three Origins Generals! Generals of Inverted Hooks, Heaven-Striking, Earth-Smashing, Rebellion-Quelling, Disaster-Dispersing, Calamity-Repelling, Gold-Armored, Gold-Adorned!" Invoke the Three Generals, the Divine Soldiers, Ghost-Seizing Envoys, the Three-Five Hosts, and the Red Qi Officials and Troops. State the matter at hand, beseeching swift deliverance. Prepare the exorcism offerings to recompense their toil, upholding the vow of faith. Depart without hesitation once the wish is granted. Follow the subsequent rites.

For urgent matters, perform the Three-Five Kitchen Rite. Face east and cry out three times: "Red Heaven Three-Five, Left and Right Great Generals! Supreme Three Venerables!" State the matter, beseeching swift deliverance. Prepare a feast for the specified number of attendees, promising rewards for merit and upholding the vow. Offer a crimson silk banner of fifty feet as the principal token, with additional lengths of twenty, forty, fifty, seventy, or ninety feet—up to fifteen feet—commensurate with the severity of the calamity and the household’s means. The wish shall be granted accordingly.

Now I set forth the Ten Precepts of the Highest Grade, which may ferry beings across, widely open the gates of conversion, and guide them into the Dao. Those who diligently observe them shall attain the natural blessings of the effortless Way.

The Ten Precepts are as follows:
1. Do not envy those superior to oneself or suppress the wise and perceptive.
2. Do not drink wine, indulge in licentiousness, or defile the Three Palaces.
3. Do not commit adultery with another’s spouse or covet lewd pleasures.
4. Do not abandon the elderly, sick, impoverished, or lowly.
5. Do not slander the virtuous or malign fellow disciples.
6. Do not hoard treasures and refuse to bestow alms.
7. Do not kill living beings or sacrifice to the Six Heavenly Ghosts.
8. Do not dismiss scriptures as false and absurd.
9. Do not betray the kindness of teachers or deceive new disciples.
10. Maintain equanimity, benevolence, and filial piety toward all.

These Ten Precepts are universally taught throughout the boundless worlds. Those who uphold them shall have their merit recorded in the Ten Heavens, their blessings extended to nine generations, and be delivered from the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms. They shall ascend to the Southern Palace, their bodies entering radiant light, their karma unbroken, and attain the immortality of the divine transcendent. All practices fulfilled, they shall shun the Ten Evils and distance themselves from the path of blindness.

The Ten Evils are as follows:
1. Indulging in wine, lust, and insatiable desire.
2. Secretly harming the world and slandering Daoists.
3. Disrespecting teachers, scorning the Dao, and slighting the Three Treasures.
4. Stealing scriptures and recklessly divulging the essentials of the Dao.
5. Borrowing without repayment, deceiving the masses.
6. Killing living beings for taste, harboring deceit in speech.
7. Being unfilial, ungrateful, and violating prohibitions.
8. Reciting scriptures carelessly, arrogantly dismissing others.
9. Demanding compliance with one’s will, harboring resentment toward all.
10. Arbitrarily interpreting scriptures, altering sacred texts, disbelieving in predestination, indulging in base desires, defiling the Four Great Elements, and neglecting the path of life.

Those who cannot free themselves from these Ten Evils shall suffer myriad misfortunes: malevolent spirits shall harm their lives, inflicting endless torment. Good deeds shall be met with misfortune, all ventures shall fail, and upon death, they shall descend into hell, confined in heavy fetters within eternal night. Deprived of the Three Lights, they shall drift day and night, embracing copper pillars, treading upon knife mountains, circling sword trees, plunging into cauldrons of boiling liquid, swallowing fire and devouring coals. Enduring the Five Sufferings, they shall forever sink into the Nine Dark Realms, without hope of rebirth. Even if delivered, they shall return as beasts of burden, barred from the human realm. Evil begets evil, good begets good—the opposition of sin and blessing is as the light of sun and moon. The unending cycle of life and death follows like a shadow clings to form, ever-turning like a wheel. Now these precepts are expounded to protect and ferry celestial and mortal beings. Clearly recognize and sincerely receive them, practicing diligently without forgetfulness.

The Secret Names of the Three Heavens of the Cavernous True are concluded.
