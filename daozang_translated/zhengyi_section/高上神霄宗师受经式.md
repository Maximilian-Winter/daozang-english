**Highest Supreme Celestial Master Scripture-Receiving Ritual**

The Most August Saint unfurls the sacred diagram,
Illuminating brilliance spreads in splendor.
The essence of True Primordial is refined,
Wondrous patterns emit their fragrant virtue.

In the early days of the Great Cataclysm, at the dawn of Vermilion Clarity,
The Most High Lord of Primordial Origin rode the Vermilion Chaos,
Accumulating the sacred *qi* of the Great Primordial,
Manifesting in the Eastern Heaven of Beginning Azure,
Among the Ten Directions’ Celestial Immortals, the Most August Saints,
The Wondrous Conduct True Persons—
An innumerable assembly—
Proclaimed the *Lingbao Degren* (Soul-Treasure Scripture for Deliverance) and the Celestial Master Scriptures,
And bestowed them upon the Jade Canopy Most High Dao Lord.

Thereupon, He commanded the Celestial Immortal Sovereign and the Upper Clarity Immortals
To compile the essential meanings,
Arrange the graded teachings,
And together compose sixty volumes,
Corresponding to the Six Heavenly Stems,
All beginning with *Wuliang Degren* (Infinite Deliverance).

When the scriptures were complete,
They were presented to the Void Sovereign,
And stored in the Purple Micro Palace above.
They were entrusted to the Celestial Master, the True King of Jade Clarity,
Sealed within the Jade Chamber of the Eastern Extremity’s Splendid Hall,
To be transmitted only in a later kalpa.

In the era of the Flourishing Song Dynasty,
When the *qi* of Great Peace prevailed,
At the auspicious juncture of Celestial Master’s descent,
He was destined to become the sovereign of mortals.
Thus, the Green Flower Emperor, His younger brother,
Was appointed to oversee the Celestial Treasury,
While the True King received the Celestial Mandate,
Inheriting the august lineage,
Ruling the Nine Realms,
Harmonizing the Ten Thousand States,
Manifesting the Dao’s transformation,
And proclaiming the sacred wind of the Primordial.

After the reign of *Rénchén* (1144 CE),
The Green Flower Emperor secretly convened in the Forbidden Palace,
Divine correspondence was perfected,
Heaven and humanity communed—
Thus, the appointed time was revealed.

Then, the True King ascended in spirit,
Piercing the Purple Clarity,
And from the Celestial Master’s Jade Chamber,
He retrieved the *Lingbao Zhenjing* (Soul-Treasure True Scripture) in sixty volumes.
Additionally, in ancient times,
He had served the Primordial Origin,
Ascending together to the *Yùluó* (Jade Net),
Witnessing the sacred *qi* of the Three Primordials’ luminous net,
And thus composed the *Highest Supreme Celestial Master Jade Clarity Secret Talismans* in three volumes,
Which had been meticulously examined in the era of the Most High Emperor,
Verified in the Purple Micro Constellation,
And likewise kept secret within the Celestial Master’s kalpa-long prohibition.
Now, they are to be revealed.

He then instructed His celestial ministers and officials
To adapt the scriptures and talismans to human teachings,
Clothe them in worldly forms,
Establish ritual frameworks,
And propagate them among those of noble resolve.

If one encounters this Dao and diligently practices it,
They are surely those whose names were inscribed in antiquity,
Whose forms are painted in the Three Imperial Floral Patterns,
Whose bones are refined by the Five Radiant Energies,
Whose inner essence is preserved by the *Kèbǎo* (Preservation Method),
And who are destined for the *Rénchén* (1144 CE) deliverance—
True practitioners of the Dao.
In the myriad kalpas,
To meet this moment is rare indeed—
How could one not strive with utmost earnestness?

**Supplementary Commentaries**
Li Yùdé’s elucidation of the *Lingbao Duren Jing*’s meaning, with a preface by the True King Lord—these are the true commentaries and explanations.

The *Gaoshang Shenshang Zhēnyù Shuō* (Highest Celestial True Jade Explanation) of the *Five-Directional Heaven’s Good-Generation-No-Killing Praise*—this originates from the *Miaojì Jingkē* (Wondrous Salvation Ritual Science) of the Celestial Highness’ Eastern Extremity Azure Hall. Reciting it resolves the calamity of unjustly harming life and cultivates the merit of good-generation and non-killing.

The *Zhènghé Yùzhì Jīnlu Zhōngkē Yí* (Political Harmony’s Imperial Composition of the Golden Register’s Central Ritual)—this ritual is for national fasting, ritual offerings, and supplications for blessings and disaster aversion. Included are:

These sacred records of the Celestial Highness’ sacred and secret rituals narrate the Celestial Highness’ Sacred Emperor’s and the Azure Hua Emperor’s divine descent and manifestations in the forbidden and secluded halls across kalpas, revealing their numinous transformations.

The Celestial Highness’ Jade Treasury’s Eastern and Western Halls oversee the secret transmissions of the various immortal officials. These transmissions record the cultivation and attainment of the Dao by the immortal officials, as well as their governance of the Celestial Highness’ duties.

Among the Celestial Highness’ Inner Treasury’s Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries—some have been transmitted since antiquity and are widely seen in the world, while others are forbidden and secret treasures of a thousand two hundred volumes, undivulged across kalpas. These are categorized into six grades and twelve classes, arranged into upper, middle, and lower volumes, stored in the Eastern and Western Azure Halls. From the era of *Taiping Qǐyùn* (Great Peace’s Auspicious Commencement) in the years *Rénchén Gēngzǐ* (Renchen, 1174 CE) onward, they shall gradually manifest.

Those who fully master one of the upper scriptures shall be titled *Shenshang Wángtiān Dòngjǐng Fǎshī Xūyuán Tǒnghuà Zhēnqīng* (Celestial Highness King-Heaven Cavern Mirror Master, Void Origin, Unified Transformation True Lord).

Upon attaining the Dao, they shall hold the rank of *Dōngxī Èrtái Xiānguān Chánglì Jiǔgōng Zhēnzǎi* (Eastern and Western Halls’ Immortal Officials, Long Officers, and Nine Palaces’ True Rulers).

Their ritual attire consists of:

- And standing upon the *Tà jiǔqì zhī tán* (Platform of the Nine Breaths).

If, among the three stages, one obtains the complete volumes of the upper, middle, or lower scriptures—or even possesses one or two of the Three Caverns’ teachings in the mortal world—they shall be titled *Shenshang Tàipíng Fǔhuà Dìzǐ* (Celestial Highness Great Peace’s Auxiliary Transformation Disciple). Upon attaining the Dao, they shall hold the rank of *Zhūtiān Xiānzhēn* (Various Heavens’ Immortal Perfected) or may also be appointed as *Shénfǔ Sǎn guān Xiānlì* (Jade Treasury’s Scattered Officials and Immortal Ministers). However, they shall not yet hold the noble status of the Highest Pure Jade Heaven, nor necessarily wield the authority of the supreme ritual officials.

Their ritual attire consists of:
- The *Sùyù Sānhuá Bìguān* (Pure Jade Triple Flower Precious Crown) or *Sān Sùyuán guān* (Three Pure Primordial Crown),
- The *Zǐjīng Shuǐyù zhī zān* (Purple Essence Water Jade Hairpin),
- The *Sùzǐ zhī bèi* (Pure Purple Robe, thirty-six layers),
- The *Bìhèhuáng shang lǜqīng zhī kūn* (Dark Brown-Yellow Robe with Green-Blue Skirt),

If one receives the teachings and fulfills all three stages, upon attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the position of *Sāntiān Gāohuáng Dàojūn* (Three Heavens’ High Sovereign Dao Lord), ranking equally with the saints.

Unless one submits a memorial and petition to the Perfected Court for ritual inspection, one may not arbitrarily wear the ritual attire. The Spirit Officials shall investigate and punish those who fall from the Dao.

The reception ceremony for the Highest Celestial Highness’s lineage master in receiving the scriptures is complete.
