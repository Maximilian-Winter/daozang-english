**Divine Lots of the Four Sage Perfected Lords**
**Celestial Admonitions for the World**

To seek glory through deceit is to gain no renown.
Wealth amassed through exploitation brings calamity upon descendants.
Cultivate virtue with mindfulness, and fortune and blessings shall descend.
Curb desires, diminish self-interest, and your destiny shall endure.

Do not deceive in darkness, nor betray the Three Luminaries.
Be upright and selfless, with a loyal and sincere heart.
Heaven and Earth bestow blessings; the gods stand guard beside you.
Prolong life and transcend hardship—prosperity shall surely come.
If you heed my words, all afflictions shall vanish like the sea.

When praying, first state your native place and name, then declare:
*"For [such-and-such a matter], I humbly invoke the Perfected Lords—*
*Marshal Tianpeng the Great, Vice-Marshal Tianyu,*
*Lord Xusheng the Protector of Virtue, and Lord Zhenwu the Spiritually Responsive—*
*along with the gods of Heaven and Earth, who witness all things.*
*I now cast this lot: may good or ill be revealed,*
*fortune or misfortune be foretold, life or death be decided—*
*let the judgment be without doubt."*

**First Lot** □□ *Lower-Lower* **Uphold the Old**

From dawn to dusk, toil without rest,
Seeing only gold, not the man.
Though hoarded wealth may rot,
In time, even blossoms turn to dust.

The soaring dragon transforms when the hour is right—
Today, its ascent is fulfilled.
Plans and wealth-seeking bring great fortune;
Seeking office and promotion leave no doubt.

The fierce general storms the palace gates—
How dare petty schemes stir conflict?
You must pay homage at the golden gate,
Where lords above and below stand in harmony.

**Sacred Intent:**
Chasing profit at dawn, abandoning truth for delusion.
What is amassed cannot be dispersed—retribution follows slander.
Hold fast to the ordinary; do not scheme.
Do not stir litigation; marriages shall prosper.
The sick recover slowly; travel faces obstacles.
Actions fall short—no path lies ahead.
Auspicious in autumn, inauspicious in spring and winter.
Selling goods is favorable.
Litigation brings no trouble; buying and selling yields no profit,
Or if slight gains come, they cost great effort.
For those under fifty, illness lingers but does not last.
The young should recover early; lying abed longer is no harm.
Affected by earth, but smallpox is no threat.
Sudden illness—if young, sweat comes in seven days, and life is secure.
Marriage brings discord; if the husband enters the wife’s home, misfortune follows.
Seeking livestock or servants brings ill fortune.
Studying medicine or crafts is inauspicious; lost items are hard to recover.
Whether early or late, reunion is delayed and difficult.
Borrowed items are mostly not returned, or only a few.

Relocation brings misfortune; only guarding the old homestead is fitting.
Household members are afflicted by earth, with taboos unsettling peace.
Cultivate blessings to protect them—childbirth should be swift; delay makes official promotion difficult, though greatly auspicious.

Those entrusted prove deceitful.
Buy goods promptly when buying; plans and actions come to fruition.
Obstacles arise; farming yields no harvest.

Seek shelter early to secure profit—
Diligently follow ancient methods, never overstepping time.
Reforming what is corrupt is people’s constant wish;
When deeds align with the heart, great rewards are enjoyed.
The tiger leaves the great forest, stirring the crowd—
Though people see it, they remain anxious and doubtful.
Though it harbors no intent to harm,
It still causes false alarms and suspicious affairs.
How can mountain dwellers host clamorous guests?
Better to cultivate the mind and refine oneself.
Amid all things, remain patient;
Burning with effort in alchemy is but vain labor.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Follow rules and norms, establish oneself by the Dao.
From long stillness comes the thought of movement—
Ever diligent and earnest.
Relocation is auspicious; plans proceed as the heart desires.
Marriage brings harmony; the ill recover lightly.
All matters flow smoothly; litigation brings joy.
Adhering to the Sage’s lot,

**Third: Moderate Fortune – From Adversity Comes Prosperity**
Exhausting diligence in hope of success,
Only to be met with sorrow and bitter countenance.
Worry not for the vain depletion of treasures—
Why toil in vain without holding to the mean?

From adversity now comes prosperity;
The dragon’s blade, polished, sheds its old dust.
Say not that self-restraint holds no other hope—
Even in seclusion, wealth is gained.

In office, slanderers arise,
Yet promotion follows in time.
Best to stay home, uphold the Dao,
And naturally, heroes appear within the household.

The Sage’s intent declares:
The times run contrary, unable to hold to constancy.
Diligence exhausted, one suffers calamity instead.
Lost items invite misfortune; actions turn ill.
In all matters, plan early and act in secret.
Great losses of wealth—best to maintain the norm.

**Fourth: Moderate Fortune – Cautious Restraint**
Say not that minor illness is but a fleeting worry—
Time and tide wait for none.
If one plans early within the Dao,
Perhaps peril may yet yield safety.

Laboring heart and strength to succeed,
Only to see the blossoms scattered by a gust of wind.
Yet if the Eastern Lord lends a gentle hand,
Another branch blooms in the distance.

Wind spurs lightning, thunder serves as messenger;
Drought breeds demons in the waters where dragons twist.
If one can avoid neither,
Timing and harmony suffice for excellence.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Be cautious in small matters, hold to oneself, and serve the spirits wholeheartedly.
Fulfill old vows early to avoid calamity.
Litigation is unfavorable; do not divine marriage.
Travel should be halted; the road is fraught with delay.

Trade is difficult; commerce should be swift.
Relocation is ill-fated.
Borrowing should be done promptly, though others may interfere.
Documents appear at once; delay brings failure.
Seeking physicians or studies is difficult with delay.
Dwelling in peace yet fearing danger,
Deep emotions bring separation.
Before good fruit can be sought,
First, one must suffer the loss of a branch.

**Fifth: Moderate Fortune – Beneficial Action**
With good intent, plan and scheme together—
Profit flows endlessly to meet your desires.
Do not forget good deeds in this pursuit,
Lest the withered vessel drift in the waves.

The sailing ship meets favorable winds without doubt;
Crossing the river is timely.
The Great Wall of ten thousand li is within reach—
Plans succeed as hoped, matters proceed as scheduled.

Two merchants seeking profit—
Best to set out and leave their homeland.
In three, five, or seven days, they reach Chang’an,
Where goods are traded—do not linger in the market.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Trade is most favorable; unite in purpose and plan.

The household—old in peril, young at peace.

Relocation is greatly auspicious.
Lost items appear after delay; plans and actions should be swift—
Delay brings no success within two or three days.

Childbirth—on even-numbered days brings peace and good fortune.
Selling goods—profit lies in swift sale; trade and commerce are auspicious.
Written contracts and transactions will not succeed.
For cart-making, the hub must be shaped with skill, relying on a master craftsman’s hand.
Layered mountains form brocade; fallen flowers bloom again.

Hexagram Six: "Great Auspiciousness in Mind" – Beneficial for Action and Use
To seek a foundation in letters and plans,
Why doubt or devise schemes?
Simply maintain a heart upright and just—
Naturally, transactions yield profit and surplus.

Mandarin ducks, parted, fly in two directions;
Schemes and wealth-seeking remain unfulfilled for now.
Better to hold fast to the old—no need for change;
Advance or retreat, hesitation lingers still.

Dwelling in peace is best within the village;
Should you wish to relocate, no cause for concern.
Even in solitude, all remains well;

Relocation is auspicious; entrusting matters to others follows the pattern of initial difficulty then ease. Documents bear the vigor of *qi*—propitious. When fish transform into dragons, the time of change arrives; cease speaking of ceaseless rains.

Azure clouds reappear in joy; a single thunderclap heralds the rains.

---

**Hexagram Seven: "Auspicious Rain" – Two Auspicious Omens in Motion**
*When talent and spirit ascend to knock upon the heavens,*
*Deep illness vanishes at once—divine merit is shown.*
*Whether young or old, all receive the blessings of this rain;*
*Its application is like tilling soil in a year of abundance.*

Withered trees meet spring and bloom with color;
Suddenly, branches flourish, sprouting new shoots.
Let no one cut them for firewood—
Wait until spring deepens, and they blossom again.

Travel east to Zhejiang for trade;
In Jiangxi, they speak of new tea.
Do not go east for business—
Buying tea there is like embroidering flowers upon brocade.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
Within, one’s essence is concentrated, making resonance easy to attain.
Though beset by worries, what need is there for excessive concern?
The sick gradually recover; chronic ailments also fade.

The blue clouds spread in pursuit.
Spring’s boundless beauty
Shines upon the Jade Pool.

---

**Hexagram Eight: "Adversity and Obstruction" – Clinging to the Old**
A foundation of hardship wearies those who sustain it;
Endless toil in base affairs blinds one to opportunity.
Livestock suffer losses—minor setbacks—
Yet greater worries arise among the household.

Seeing a fishing boat struggle upstream,
It docks here, lingering in hesitation.
Once the first rapids are passed, one might think the worst is over—
But ahead lie even more treacherous shoals.

Matters of the heart are hard to pursue;
If you proceed, fortune will diminish.
This is where wealth is lost on the road,
Where surging waves engulf the bright pearl.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
One possesses ancestral legacy yet fails to preserve it.
Greed knows no bounds; one exhausts schemes in vain.
Livestock perish, bringing sorrow to the household.
Plans come to naught; the sick recover slowly.

One should cling to the old and not seek change.

Seeking office or promotion is slow.

When treasures transform with the times,
Why do matters not return?
Fingers point to the setting sun—
A lone boat refuses to rest.

---

**Hexagram Nine: "Receiving Blessings" – Transcending the Mundane**
Longing to leave the old and embrace the new,
One encounters flourishing fortune, and aspirations expand.
Home and family are at peace, free from other concerns;
Hiding one’s light and biding time, one emerges from the dust.

Orchids in spring’s splendor are fragrant and lovely;
Chrysanthemums in autumn’s bloom are even finer.
Heaven and earth each follow their own inclinations—
Unbound by restraint, they open in succession.

How to address matters of two minds?
One must follow fate with reverence and pass through cautiously.
Yet the time of opportunity is not far off—
Though not grand, it is worthy of praise.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
After adversity comes prosperity; aspirations will unfold.
The long-established home is peaceful; one transcends the mundane.
All actions and plans succeed without fail.
Clinging to the old brings mediocrity; nearly achieved goals may collapse.
Trade proceeds without obstruction; fields and silkworms are fully prepared.
Changes and actions will surely bring satisfaction.

Most matters see partial success; farming yields two- or threefold. First marriages are auspicious; remarriage is mediocre. Seeking heirs is auspicious.

Seeking official position or promotion—unattainable. Household and family members are at peace; do not speak of borrowing. Childbirth proceeds smoothly; documents bring delayed auspiciousness. Transactions are slow to conclude; entrusting others with matters may fail. Venturing into trade is greatly auspicious.

For months on end, rain falls frequently,
Only at dusk does the sky begin to clear.
Raising one’s gaze to the heavens above,
The dim moon gradually grows bright.

□□  Tenth  Supreme  Auspicious

Auspicious repute overflows with boundless blessings,
The household brims with joy and felicity.
From whence comes the phoenix’s auspicious sign?
Virtue’s glory shines, bringing prosperity for generations.

Whether on level ground or mountain peaks,
All the boundless springtime beauty is claimed.
Having gathered the essence of a hundred flowers into honey,
For whom does one toil, and for whom is it sweet?

The imperial proclamation calls for worthy talents, courage and harmony aligned,
Just as spring’s hues are fitting to enter the gate.
Attaining office will ultimately lead to prominence,
Yet nothing compares to the stability of family wealth.

The Sage’s intent declares:
The Dao of the noble flourishes, the way of the petty wanes.
Seeking fame finds fulfillment, distinction in the imperial court.
A noble child is born, bringing future abundance.
Submitting memorials and strategies, one takes the lead in divination.
For the common person, such aspirations remain unattainable.
Vaguely adhering to the old ways,
One narrowly avoids calamity and misfortune.

Divining wealth—nobles prosper, while petty persons are present.
Small-scale acquisitions are auspicious.
Sell goods promptly; relocation is auspicious. Litigation is auspicious.
Farming depends on timing; mediocre transactions may succeed, but delay brings failure.
Household and family members are at peace; travel is auspicious.

Nobles give birth to the noble; petty persons face separation.
Borrowing—nobles find it auspicious, petty persons gain nothing.
Lost items should be sought gradually. Relocation is auspicious.
Seeking medical treatment or education is auspicious. Entrusting others with matters is auspicious, but petty persons meet with failure.
Seeking official position, promotion, or appointment is auspicious.
In affairs, it is best to rest the mind and settle the body, which will gradually improve.

Like fading blossoms that remain as before,
Their colors now full and abundant.

□□  Eleventh  Supreme  Diligence in Action

Do not let footprints linger long in dust and obscurity;
Fortunately, a true scholar is a treasure at the feast.
Upholding integrity need not mean perpetual seclusion—
Await the moment when grinding and polishing open the ford.

The prisoner leaves jail, disputes are settled,
Then one buys sweet melons to ascend the tavern.
By chance, an old friend is met, and they drink together,
The wine bill is paid, and they toast one another again.

Why rush matters when setting out?
Even hurrying to Chang’an takes three days.
Better to stay home and heed the news,
For affairs must be witnessed firsthand to bring glory.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Talents and skills long buried in dust,
The time approaches when the path will open,
Bringing success and fulfillment to plans.
Most fitting to pursue aspirations,
Yet impossible to linger.

Marriage remains steady, lawsuits incur no loss.
Clinging to the old is unwise—lest one face humiliation.
Regarding wealth: for scholars in trade, full profit awaits;
Light goods are easy to acquire, and sales proceed smoothly.
Moving residence is inauspicious.
Lawsuits turn favorable, yet all matters meet obstruction.
Travelers arrive in two or three days—if not, trust the news.
Journeys prove auspicious.
The sick recover in three to five days without harm;
Prolonged illness may require a vow, but pox brings good fortune.
Marriage is favorable, and seeking wealth through marriage succeeds.
Lawsuits should be settled amicably.
Purchases—be it property, servants, livestock, or textiles—face delays but will conclude.
Childbirth yields a noble son, safe and sound.
All matters should be hastened, for delay invites trouble.
Relying on others brings good fortune; household and family remain at peace.
Documents bear an auspicious aura; transactions should be swift—delay risks failure.
Relocation and commerce prosper.
Seeking medicine or official promotion brings success.
Borrowing should be done quickly, for others may interfere.
What one desires will surely come to pass—
If only someone could know!
When the dragon soars, the ravine appears;
The timely rain falls just as it should.

[Missing characters] Twelfth: Lowest of the Low—Foul Conduct Obscures Clarity

Foul conduct deceives the heart, betraying Heaven’s gaze;
Ghosts and spirits ever watch one’s hidden ways.
If arrogance could summon fortune’s grace,
No good would walk the earth in human form.

Willow catkins swirl on the wind, lost without trace—
Like King Xiang’s dream, fleeting as a breath.
In the quiet of night, beneath the moon’s pale glow,
They drift and scatter, entangling the fragrant groves.

One may laugh at the traveler’s tale:
Yesterday he was poor—today, rich with coin.
Yet without diligence, nothing is gained;
Know this: only later comes fulfillment.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
Deceit within and without—ghosts and spirits offer no protection.
In all affairs and movements, one must fear misfortune and blame.
Whether plotting or acting, all endeavors prove difficult to achieve.
Atoning for transgressions and seeking forgiveness may yet avert calamity.
Before any action comes to fruition, it is best to maintain the status quo.
Though this slip is deemed greatly auspicious, all matters go awry.

For wealth: buying, selling, and stocking goods is favorable; selling brings profit.
For litigation: auspicious. For relocation: inauspicious.
On days marked by the fourth, twenty-sixth, forty-eighth, or thirty-fourth,
undertaking journeys invites disaster.
Travelers will arrive in two or three days; if not, they are detained by matters abroad.
For illness, whether young or old: afflicted by earth spirits or unfulfilled vows,
or one who has left the ancestral line and resides elsewhere—first seek aid from the household,
fulfill new vows swiftly, for delay endangers recovery.
For pox: ominous; preserving life brings good fortune.
For marriage: entering the groom’s home is greatly inauspicious.
For advancement or promotion: aspirations remain unfulfilled.
For purchasing land, homes, or livestock: inauspicious.
All schemes, plans, and undertakings prove unfavorable.
For childbirth: difficult. Household and family are unsettled—seek blessings for peace.
Relying on others for matters brings no success; people are hard to find.
Success turns to adversity; anxiety weighs heavily on the heart.
The trials of the Nai River are not yet passed—pray for blessings to avert misfortune.

□□ Thirteenth: Middling—Perseverance in the Old Ways

A steadfast nature, reverent and diligent, never slighting the gods;
In dealings with others, one remains fair and just.
How can one provoke resentment and reproach?
Better to withdraw the heart and preserve what is already achieved.

Flowers bloom and bear fruit, meeting their timely season,
Relying on the workings of spring’s transformative power.
All hopes and plans come to fruition,
And the dream of returning home in brocade robes may yet be realized.

Affairs endure, and so too does intent—
Yet amid them, a single moment stands strongest.
Act in accord with the times, without negligence,
And return home in brocade to pay homage to father and mother.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
One’s nature is reverent and faithful, never slighting the gods.
Conduct is upright and just, never deceiving others.
When others harbor resentment, it rebounds upon oneself.
How much better to seek stillness and preserve one’s true nature?
Do not pursue new schemes—maintain the old, and renewal will follow.

For wealth: ordinary transactions and stocking goods are inauspicious; expenditures bring no good.
For litigation: inauspicious. For farming: observe the seasons.
For travel: unfavorable. Travelers have not yet arrived.
For illness, regardless of age: prolonged suffering requires patience;
In urgent cases, recovery is difficult—pray for blessings and protection.

The pox likewise follows this pattern.
For marriage and entering a household: mediocre prospects for heirs.
Lost items will reappear with patience.
Purchasing fields, houses, servants, or livestock should be delayed in completion.
Seeking office or promotion brings honorable status; the household is at peace.
Plans and undertakings come to fruition—proceed with patience, not haste.
Childbirth requires calm; difficulties will pass.
Borrowed items will not be repaid.
Learning medicine or crafts demands patience.
Moving is unfavorable; documents will be delayed.
Busy yet unsettled in heart, tilling the fields with little strength.
Wait for the right time—then use it.
When clouds disperse, the moon is reborn.

[Missing character] Fourteenth: Most Inauspicious
Restlessness
Right and wrong blur in clamorous strife; lawsuits drag on without cease.
Wealth scatters, people part, and hardships multiply.
Preserve yourself, avoid harm, and reduce blame.
Dragons and snakes intermingle, difficult to restrain;
The scales of wind and cloud have yet to transform.
One day, riding clouds to return to the Northern Sea,
Only then will the dragon’s true form appear.

Hearing the road is perilous makes the journey seem hard—
Yet you say it is hard, but it is not.
Better to set out, cross the waters,
And return home to find all settled and safe.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
Entangled in right and wrong, contending in litigation.
People part, wealth scatters, losses are hard to recover.
Do not covet action—preserve your wholeness.
Travel is unfavorable; marriage has no affinity.
The sick have not recovered—pray to Heaven.
Abide by constancy and duty to avoid misfortune.

For business: stocking goods is inauspicious; selling is favorable.

Appease the earth and perform blessings for protection.

Documents lack qi alignment; borrowed items will not be repaid.
The household and its members are restless.
Seeking office or promotion will not succeed.
Moving is unfavorable; relying on others for matters is inauspicious.
Childbirth endangers mother or child—neither is favorable.

Anxious as if accused of wrongdoing,
Bewildered, the right path is lost.
A fine lady draws water from the well,
But the basket and pipe return empty.

[Missing character] Fifteenth: Most Auspicious
Upholding Integrity, the Year’s Virtue
Matters should be settled in accord with Heaven’s design—
Do not heed the diviner’s or shaman’s disputes.
Follow the great Dao with rectitude,
And your household will naturally shine with radiance.

The moon, full tonight, departs the sea’s edge;
People gaze in admiration at the beauty of spring.
Where its pure light gleams, the stars retreat—
The nobleman’s schemes secure office.

Last year, you dwelled here in leisure;
Today, you return as if to an old friend.
It is good to seek wealth and abide in fortune—
Though petty men have been driven away by the wicked.

The Sage’s Intent declares:
A heart that accumulates goodness, though long obstructed, will not be denied.
Seeking gods or divination is reckless and vain.
Uphold integrity and constancy—do not weary of hardship.
Great vessels are late in completion; the time will come when all aligns.
In pursuit and planning, all affairs will prosper.
The sick will recover—do not seek external illusions.

For wealth: business is auspicious; selling goods is favorable.

Travelers will arrive on the 1st, 8th, 15th, or 23rd.
Relying on others for matters is difficult at first, then easy.
Illness is from cold damage—regardless of age, recovery comes after the solar term.

For pox and sores, preserve blessings and maintain stability—if consulted by a woman, the prognosis is poor.
Marriage will be delayed or disrupted; a second marriage may bring discord. Seeking heirs will be auspicious after delay.
Litigation is favorable; lost items will be found at the solar term, though no news arrives beforehand.
Plans and accomplishments will succeed if timed to the solar term, though later gains will be modest.
Relocation is auspicious after delay; documents will arrive late.
Seeking office or promotion will be finalized and complete at the solar term.
Childbirth on the solar term will bring a noble son.
Household and family remain stable; borrowed items will be returned late with minor issues.
Jade and stone remain indistinct—anxiety deepens into doubt.
Ahead lies the great Dao’s thoroughfare, yet blossoms bloom on withered branches.

◇◇　Hexagram Sixteen　Most Inauspicious　Hold to One’s Role
Treading perilous heights, one meets starving tigers;
Crossing waters by boat, one drowns in raging waves.
Hold to your role and remain at ease—disaster may yet pass.
Repay kindness and toil with gratitude.
Oil lamps flicker and dim, barely lit before fading.
Long wicks burn out in vain effort—
Better to withdraw early and return home.
In seeking wealth, know the true essence;
Once grasped, great fortune follows.
Three days of high prices, then none—
All returns to earth with a single thunderclap.

The Sage’s Intent:
Abandoning roots for branches, indulging in greed and excess,
One meets tigers on land, sinks with boats at sea.
Better to uphold the old and repay kindness—

Then may one pass through spring and autumn safely.

Relying on others for matters will fail; livestock will not appear, and news will be hard to find, with disputes arising.

To find fortune, cross towering mountains—
Yet returning home may bring sorrow.
Moonlight shines on a moored boat,
But who knows the chill and desolation?

A hundred blessings stir as earth meets spring’s return,
Warm breaths revive, all things assume their freshest mien.

Behold the long-delayed dawn of fragrant days unfold.

Clouds drift and rain descends in spring’s deep embrace;
All schemes and wealth-seeking find their heart’s desire.

In haste, one seeks the gods with forced sincerity,
Yet such devotion fails to move the divine.
Facing peril, one fears no safety can be found;
All hopes dissolve—success remains beyond reach.

A boat without oars drifts helplessly,
Swept by currents toward the boundless sea.
Alas, how many souls are led astray,
Wandering east and west in vain pursuit.

Those who act find their affairs unfulfilled;
Once achieved, they swiftly turn away.
If you seek this fate, all proves inauspicious—
Only through divination may peace be secured.

Human hearts grow lax, defiling the sacred with impurity.
Peril and danger loom; illness lingers in hesitation.
Plans falter; marriages fail to form.

◇◇ 21 ◇◇ Most Inauspicious ◇◇ Stagnation and Delay

Fine jade and bright pearls are not easily won—
Their blessings align with past merits long sown.
To grasp the truth of fate’s rise and fall,
One frets in vain, graying before their time.

A fish transforms into a roc, riding ocean waves,
As yin and yang harmonize in times of peace.
Even common folk may harbor lofty dreams—
A thunderous roar from flat ground stirs all anew.

The present scene is fraught with hardship’s weight;
Each day, one seeks to shed the old for change.
Trade and wealth slip ever out of reach—
Yet in your heart, let no despair take root.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Accumulated virtue brings blessings to the household.
Accumulated vice invites calamity to the door.
All follows nature’s course—why sink into despair?
Heirs are hard to secure; all undertakings falter.
Begin nothing new; guard your heart and wait.

For wealth: trading old goods is favorable; selling proves inauspicious.

◇◇ 22 ◇◇ Greatly Auspicious ◇◇ Later Fortune

One refines their craft with diligence, mastering knowledge deep,
Their nature as clear as still waters, profound and bright.
Long cherished treasures hold boundless worth—
Only when sold does their true value shine.

A phoenix takes flight from the forest,
Spreading its wings to soar above all birds.
One day, it ascends to the imperial court,
Admired and renowned in every land.

Spur the horse on the long road ahead,
Reaching the capital in a day or two.
In the imperial city, a carefree guest—
Early arrival secures office, fate’s design.

The Sage’s intent declares:
Through steadfast study, one’s talents remain unrecognized—
Long mired in hardship, plans fail to unfold.
Yet when the time comes, old paths lead to renewal,
Like withered wood blooming anew.
No need for distant worries—all matters shall succeed.
Lawsuits bring peace; all actions align with desire.
Plans come to fruition; all endeavors prosper.

For wealth: trade and sales yield modest gains in the present.

The traveler arrives; lawsuits are auspicious. Journeys are unfavorable—illness for the elderly and young, though grave conditions pose no harm. Smallpox and sores remain stable. Farming yields blossoms but no fruit; marriage and seeking heirs are inauspicious. Purchasing fields, estates, servants, or livestock is favorable; household and family remain at peace. Plans and accomplishments fare better if delayed. Lost items will be found after a long time; borrowing brings delayed fortune. Trade prospers; relocation is better postponed. Childbirth yields a son, auspicious and bright. Seeking medical treatment or education fares better later; pursuing office or promotion brings distant great fortune. Documents and correspondence are most favorable if delayed; transactions should be swift, as delay brings misfortune.

At first, change meets resistance, but light emerges as the Dao aligns and flows. Official documents, imperial posts, and stipends reach fulfillment, bringing joy and abundant years.

□□ Twenty-Third: *Moderate Balance* – *The Image of Temporal Obstruction*
Things remain, yet people change—let go of attachments,
Lest grievances and lawsuits turn to mutual provocation.
Though the heart shines bright as a mirror,
How can one endure when fortune’s hour has not yet come?

Peach trees planted fill the eastern courtyard,
Their blossoms battered by rain and wind.
Once hoped for fruit to savor,
Now all that remains is emptiness.

How wondrous the immortal’s art—
If you pursue it, you’ll transcend the world.
When the Dao’s fruit ripens and the elixir is refined,
The golden gate opens at the appointed time.

The Sage’s intent declares:
The hour is obstructed, the fate adverse—
Many troubles, many disputes,
All exhaust the heart and mind,
Yet who pities your woes?
Hold fast to the old and await the turning of the times.
First misfortune, then fortune;
Plans and hopes are delayed.
Seeking marriage brings distant success;
Litigants face no danger.
In all matters, proceed with patience—
Why harbor doubts?

For wealth: the later the trade, the greater the profit. Purchasing goods is favorable; selling may be slow but ultimately good. In all affairs, remain still and steady. Journeys are safe; the traveler has not yet arrived. Hesitation without action brings obstruction; lawsuits are best settled through mediation.

Documents and correspondence face delay but later succeed; borrowing is possible, though entrusting others fares better later.

Longing for the bright moon,
It waxes full, then wanes again.
Intentions may bloom like spring,
Yet in the end, all warmth fades.

□□ Twenty-Fourth: *Supreme* – *Receiving Blessings and Fortune*
A person of wealth and power, favored by auspicious spirits,
All actions proceed as the heart desires, naturally trusted.
Boldly venture into the tiger’s den,
And in time, you shall inherit the dragon’s pearl.

The bright moon hangs in the sky, illuminating all,
Its radiance dispelling every darkness.
All plans flourish; the household thrives—
This is the time for glory and prosperity.

If you speak of this matter, it must be praised,
Yet entrusting it to others leads astray.
Hasten to cultivate the heart and retreat to the mountains,
To escape the world’s entanglements, tangled as hemp.

The Sage’s intent declares:
By nature bold and proud,
You favor lofty heights.
Divine spirits aid your cause;
Profit and integrity are upheld.
Your conduct commands respect;
Lawsuits bring no toil.
A noble son is born,
And all things flow abundantly.
The sick recover swiftly;
Hopes are soon fulfilled.
Plans come to fruition;
Promotions and advancements rise.

For wealth: merchants of rank and title gain full advantage; common folk should avoid purchasing goods, though selling may be slow. In marriage, entering the household brings one of stern and impatient temperament, difficult to approach at first, but later ensuring long-term fortune. Documents and correspondence are auspicious; journeys bring wealth and honor. For common folk, no advantage; the traveler has not yet arrived. Illness in the elderly and young brings pain but slow recovery without harm. Borrowing is unlikely; plans and accomplishments face initial difficulty but later ease. Lost items are hard to recover; transactions succeed well. Trade ventures prosper; seeking office or promotion brings great fortune. Entrusting others with tasks faces initial difficulty but later ease.

□□ Twenty-Fifth: *Most Inauspicious* – *No Disaster Unmet*
Fortune meets misfortune; blessings are scarce—
Flee and hide, do not act lightly.
Merchants and traders should adhere to the old ways;
Watch for schemes that show only promise.

Hopes for success fall short of your desires;
The path to high office grows ever distant.
Remaining patient and steadfast is the true fortune—
In time, glory will surely appear.

One day, your affairs may seem praiseworthy,
But in the long run, they lead to wealth and splendor.
Some fail, some succeed—how many things are so?
Though the melon may be large, it remains sweet or bitter.

The Sage’s intent declares:
The hour is adverse, fate obstructed—
Best to retreat and hide.
Forced efforts bring no lasting labor.
Journeys risk bandits; the elderly toil in vain.
Farming yields no harvest; marriages bring endless chatter.
Hold fast to the old; do not cling to ambitions.

For wealth: trade when goods are available, but selling is slow. Farming yields shoots but no harvest; the sick do not recover; smallpox brings misfortune. Journeys are unfavorable; the traveler arrives. Trade ventures fail; relocation is inauspicious. Marriages face much talk but no success; lawsuits are unlucky. Transactions are difficult and unstable. Purchasing fields, estates, servants, or livestock is only favorable if they are your original property—otherwise, no benefit. Plans and accomplishments are unfavorable and, if achieved, short-lived. Lost items are hard to recover; borrowing brings little success.

Childbirth is difficult to preserve, yet no harm comes; entrusting matters to others brings completion. Households and family members find little peace; documents and omens do not proceed smoothly. Seeking office or promotion leads to appointments of short duration.

[Missing characters] Twenty-Sixth: Moderation
Impartial and Selfless

Heaven-sent disasters and clashing calamities arise by fate’s decree;
In vain one holds sincere devotion to move the heavens above.
Good fruits and karmic conditions are silently ordained—
No room for private desires to ensure safety.

Dwelling in peace brings prosperity and increasing wealth;
Clouds gather in the sky, the earth quakes with thunder.
Rank and position ascend to glorious heights;
Honor, wealth, and nobility enter the gate.

Abiding in the Dao, one dimly perceives great wealth;
Opportune actions need not be doubted.
If divining official matters within this,

**Hexagram Twenty-Seven: Utmost Adversity (向善)**

Noble patrons offer new assistance;
official troubles and gossip leave the household.

like one walking beneath the moon.

**Hexagram Thirty: Most Inauspicious (Void and Doomed)**

Litigation drags on, aspirations unfulfilled;
wasted wealth and labor, vain and fruitless strife.
Plan early for virtuous deeds to cultivate distant blessings—
lest delay bring suffering and weariness to others.

Flowers in full bloom meet night-long rain;
the moon at its brightest is veiled by clouds.
Remember: peach and plum must not mock one another—
the day clouds part will come in time.

Know this: affairs within demand caution,
yet on this day, clouds part to reveal good fortune.
If you divine for three or four days hence,
swift preparation will ensure success.

**The Sage’s Counsel:**

Pursue goodness to avert misfortune and calamity.
Plans and hopes come to naught; marriages fail.

[Missing characters] Hexagram Thirty-One: Great Auspice, Uprightness

Serving the public, upholding the law without shirking toil,
From this, one’s qi and character soar high.
Naturally, conduct and retreat align with Heaven’s principle—
How could the slightest flaw corrupt one’s steadfast integrity?

Heart’s affairs surge restlessly, never at ease;
Scarcely settled, unease returns again.
All undertakings remain unfulfilled,
Like the bright moon veiled behind clouds.

This matter is middling—difficult to accomplish;
Even when achieved, it brings no satisfaction.
If divining official matters, they shall ultimately dissolve;
For merchants seeking profit, gains will be slight.

The Sage’s intent declares: Uprightness accords with principle, eschewing crookedness.
In litigation, one gains the multitude—Heaven’s blessing extends afar.
Though minor distress may arise,
How could it mar one’s flawless virtue?

Action brings harmonious fortune,
Ever advancing toward prosperity.
In all dealings, one enjoys smooth passage,
And joy is met with greater glory.

The osprey and roc transform.
The roc soars a hundred thousand li,
Yet soon encounters the azure sky.

[Missing characters] Hexagram Thirty-Two: Supreme, Unworried in the Year’s Cold

Wiping tears, sighing often for distant news long sunk,
In vain, one consults ancient divination for glad tidings.
Do not let strange dreams breed needless worry—
The pine and cypress, steadfast in their resolve, hold true within.

The stars encroach upon the moon—beware of trouble ahead,
Minor ailments bring misfortune, heralding calamity.
Yet if one knows and calls out halfway,
Preemptive offerings to heaven may avert disaster.

Settling down yet planning to leave the neighborhood,
Trade and ventures lie far away.
Relying on Buddha and gods brings fortune—

Entering a household to seek heirs may not succeed.
The household suffers minor losses,
Unrest calls for virtuous protection.
Buying fields or homes brings minor losses first, then success.
Plans and actions face small setbacks at first,
No harm in borrowing,

Hexagram Thirty-Five: Moderate—Seek Not, Move Not

The local spirits and malevolent forces forbid construction,
Preserve the old—do not seek elsewhere.
Disturbing tombs and earth is especially fearful—
Hastening to honor the gods brings great blessing.

The crane cries in the heavens, its qi piercing the sky,
Nine thousand li shrink to a hand’s breadth.
Official rank and wealth ascend daily,
Peaceful living brings joy through the seasons.

Each departure leaves more behind,

□□  Thirty-Sixth: Utterly Inauspicious—Follow the Old

Routine leads to confusion, carelessness invites ruin;
Once defenses fail, chaos reigns unchecked.
Wealth scatters—seeking blessings anew,
Why not have spared harm from the start?

Fish leap through peach-blossom waves in the third month,
Only then does the dragon’s form delight.
Seeking office and emolument finds certainty,
All affairs free of worry—new fortune arrives.

By chance, in drought years, low fields are sown,
If waters come, the rice remains incomplete.
Hearing rumors of locusts and calamity,
False alarms subside—wholeness is restored.

Failing to uphold the law, ever prone to negligence—
Fire and theft strike once, and all collapses.

**Hexagram Thirty-Seven: Utterly Inauspicious – Abide in Stillness**
Fortune has roots as misfortune has a womb—
All summoned by man’s own hand.
A heart set on ill invites calamity;
Even with luck, the body may survive, yet wealth is lost.
How to cross waters without a boat?
Waves and billows rise in towering fury.
Neither advance nor retreat yields escape—
Follow not this path in all your comings and goings.
A lifetime spent wandering as a traveler,
What trade or profit ever thrives?
If buying food with a knife, act swiftly—
Know that haste brings advantage, east or west.

The Sage declares:
A life steeped in harm—
Fortune scant, misfortune manifold.
Now beset by sudden woe,
What recourse remains?

**Hexagram Thirty-Eight: Middling Fortune – Beset by Hardship**
Illness lingers, pitiably frail—
Physicians and shamans waste efforts to preserve life.
Sincere pleas and vows prove vain—
Why not quietly reflect and answer Heaven’s call?

The red sun pierces the clouds,
Illuminating all, even the hidden—
The multitudes turn their gaze.
The nobleman advances, his path bright,
His household prosperous and at peace.

When buying, prices soar—
Sell at a bargain, do not hesitate.
Though profit is meager,
Wandering here is but wasted effort.

The Sage declares:
Disaster clings like a web—
Who could foresee its source?
Unfulfilled vows endanger safety;
Physicians and shamans spin tales, squandering coin.
Hasten to cultivate virtue
To appease Heaven above.
First sorrow, then joy;
First hardship, then ease.
Perform good deeds—
The gods will grant protection.

Eight blades remain unfinished,
Dark arrows strike the unseen.
Harm to others returns to oneself—
Fortune departs, misfortune invades.

**[Missing character] Thirty-Ninth: Neutral – Guard Against Humiliation**
Speak not of heroes untouched by misfortune—
Grand ambitions meet disgrace, hard to endure.
Turn back, amend faults—no shame in correction;
Seek the open path, inquire wisely.

Suddenly lost in deep mountains,
Better to return, free of doubt.
Advance or retreat, travel—all bring misfortune;
Beware hidden deceit and loss.

Though goods arrive late, their prospects are bright—
Best to maintain the old and observe the bold.
When a leader emerges, fortune turns auspicious,
And wealth later flows like a blade.

**The Sage’s Intent:**
The strong and lawless
Lightly bully the good and kind.
Vicious debts are hard to seize—
Suffering disgrace, one is cast aside.
Yet amend faults once,
And misfortune vanishes, no more to return.
First ill, then good—
All depends on timely action.
This lot is not auspicious;
Hasten to fulfill old vows.

A heart harboring malice, lacking kindness,
In life and death, filial impiety spreads.
Yet turn toward the Dao, reform the old—
A foundation endures, heirs thrive in the household.

The swan soars to the heavens, naturally,
But before its time arrives, misfortune strikes.
This day, ascension brings freedom—
Soaring straight to the clouds of the nine skies.

Hearing news, the truth is praiseworthy;
Approach the gate, and splendor awaits.
If you entrust others, it ends inauspiciously—
Empty words tangle worldly affairs like hemp.

**The Sage’s Intent:**
A lifetime of malice,
Disharmony with kin.
Transforming life and death,
Turn toward this heart.
Swear to heaven, repent to earth,
Reform the old, renew the new.

Illness gradually lessens; plans and ventures succeed.
For marriage or lawsuits, peace is ultimately achieved.
Shift from ill to good—
Joy fills the household.

Opening one’s eyes only invites separation.
Best to maintain the old, passing days in peace,
To preserve contentment and steady fortune.

Falling blossoms, flowing water—both heartless,
The household is troubled, the master uneasy.
Women and children face illness and hardship—
Hasten to pray to the gods of prosperity.

Though treasures emerge from the sea,
Boarding a foreign ship is a vain journey.
Arriving, one knows not where to go—
Returning empty-handed, bare as before.

The Sage’s Intent declares: Journeys and schemes bring harm to oneself and loss of wealth. It is best to maintain the old and preserve yourself from disaster. Public matters are settled, but illness lingers long. Do not break ground, lest sorrow arise. Strange dreams unsettle the heart, and all affairs falter. In matters of wealth, if there is no old stock, guard what goods you have. Farming yields meager harvests. Illness spares neither old nor young—mostly inauspicious, rarely favorable.

**[Missing character] Forty-Second: Great Auspice – Awakening**
Long dullness stirs, as if waking from drunkenness,
Suddenly thoughts of change arise, though not yet to their source.
Ice melts, snow scatters, and the gentle breeze arrives—
The sunken rise in secret, the withered flourish anew.
Fish leap from the water, playing amidst the waves,
Leaping and gliding—do not take this lightly.
Fortune comes with ease, all matters flow smoothly,
Even in peril, victory surpasses the past.
Do not boast of martial prowess or extraordinary feats,
For in battle, few know true success or failure.
Even in victory, there is loss—
Better to avoid conflict and find peace.

The Sage’s Intent declares: Long stagnation is like drunkenness, yet many encounters follow. The sunken will not remain trapped; thunder rumbles slowly, ice melts, snow scatters, and the gentle breeze arrives of itself. All affairs proceed as wished, and suppressed paths unfold. Illness and disputes turn to fortune—you will be free from worry. All schemes are greatly auspicious; do not hesitate. In matters of wealth, trade at the start of spring brings profit; other months are less favorable. Storing goods is good; all affairs are auspicious. Farming yields a harvest. Travel should be swift, lest it fail; the traveler arrives in two or three days. Marriage is auspicious, though difficult at first, it becomes easy later. Relocation is favorable.

Nobles rejoice, and all flows smoothly.
Seeking wealth and schemes follows the heart’s desire;
Asking for office—surely one will gain a name.

Yet in their midst, affairs do not align.
Not a single flaw in their schemes—
In an instant, fame shines upon the great assembly.

Actions are ordinary—do not devise clever tricks. In matters of wealth, lightly stored goods are good; selling goods is good. Farming yields a meager harvest. Travel is safe for the young but perilous for the old; the traveler arrives. Relocation is swiftly auspicious.

Swift come, swift go—east or west.
Though wealth is not abundant,
Its clear light shines full before the eyes.
