### The Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm Speaks the *Zhenyuan Tongxian Daojing*
#### The Supreme Virtue Descends from the Great Ultimate (First Chapter)

In the boundless expanse of the Upper Realm’s true primordiality, there exists a heaven born of the unified qi, a land of the Nine Purities’ spontaneity. It nurtures the three-luminous herbs and plants the seven-jeweled trees. Its crimson walls rise in radiant splendor, its jade towers blaze with brilliance. Verdant palaces and purple-pure halls stand in majestic array; green-jade portals and vermilion gates gleam resplendent. Dragon chants and phoenix melodies resound, crimson mists swirl in molten flow, and azure clouds billow in layered grandeur. All is the congealing of the Great Primordial, the transformation of the true primordial, the sacred inner sanctum where the Heavenly Venerable alone is exalted.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable bore ten august titles: the Heavenly Master of the Upper Realm’s Qian-Yuan Supreme Sage, the Celestial Sovereign of the Great Primordial’s Upper Perfection, the Law King of the Nine Yangs’ Supreme True Primordial, the Enlightened Immortal Lord of the Three Caverns’ Opening Transformation, the Merciful and Benevolent Great Constant of the Ten Heavens’ Pure Propagation, the Wondrous Dao’s Harmonizing Highest Emperor, the Most Revered of Upper Virtue Who Absolves Sins and Purifies the Heavens, the Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm’s Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure, the Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm’s Limitless Supreme Dao and Virtue, the Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm’s Compassionate Salvation from Suffering, and the Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm’s Jade Clarity and Luminous Augustness.

His imperial consorts and divine maidens attended with ritual propriety, striking the law drums and chiming the flowered bells. The celestial maidens that followed bore the wondrous offerings of void-dispersing silk, held vermilion tassels and azure sashes with crimson-clouded regalia, raised the nine-heavenly flowered mushrooms, and unfurled the five-luminous feathered fans.

The Heavenly Venerable ascended the Thousand-Radian Cloud Palace, mounting the Seven-Treasure Throne, seated upon a luminous jade mat of rattan-light and radiant gold. Presently, the Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Upper Realm, the Great Sage of Eternal Life, the Boundless Highest-Ranked Great Spirit Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings, along with the thirty-two Heavenly Lords, their ministers, and the stellar officials and perfected immortals, the great balance-dispelling calamities and the celestial-spanning Miroku divine immortals and numinous officers—an innumerable host—all presented themselves before the celestial throne, paying homage.

The guardians of the Dao brandished their swords with clanging steel, while the demon-expelling immortals raised banners in blazing glory. Then, golden portals emitted true incense, wafting into the Great Desert and drifting above the unified qi. It cast celestial radiance, illuminating the Dao’s domain and shining resplendent within the eight directions.

Thereupon, the Ten-Flowered Immortal Lords, gazing upon the imperial light, rode cloud-dragons to arrive at the gates of the Great Luo’s flying Brahma. They returned to their morning duties, ushered into the phoenix-paved court. The natural heavenly winds blew solemnly, stirring the nine-dragon flowers. Immortal music resounded in harmonious melody, echoing the eight-luan hymns. The divine breeze played the yellow blossoms’ rhythm, while the numinous abyss revealed the azure flowers’ hue.

The assembled lords performed their rites, gazing upon the sacred countenance—like the crimson dawn’s radiant glow, dazzling and majestic—enshrined in profound dignity, its brilliance too blinding to behold directly.

Then, the Great Luminous Immortal Lord of the Upper Realm stepped forth and proclaimed: “Your servants have observed the Heavenly Venerable and Highest Emperor descending into the flowing-radiance palace, moving through the congealed-splendor halls, unfolding the four seasons’ course, and presiding over the seven governances’ offices. The immortal scriptures reveal the pure and true winds; the decrees admonish the divine primordial’s transformations. Your compassionate light shines universally, and your sagely grace extends evenly. We bow our heads and come to pay court in the imperial court. We humbly beseech your imperial compassion to bestow mercy. We dare to inquire of the Great Ultimate’s workings—without the Highest Emperor’s supreme illumination, how could its teachings be so resplendently bestowed? We reverently await the sagely jade utterance.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable concealed the mysterious darkness within the void, concentrated quiescence within spontaneity, blended the true primordial amid existence, and ordered the great simplicity within the unborn. Dissolving the proclamations of names and forms, he harmonized with the chapters of the subtle and formless. After a long while, he spoke:

“From whence does the supreme virtue arise? It descends from the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate encompasses all beyond heaven and earth, first dwelling within the primordial chaos. From the void, it generates being; from turbidity, it returns to clarity. When gathered, its source is unfathomable; when dispersed, its forms are manifest. Thus, it reveals the shining constellations, nurtures the myriad things, its power drawn from the unified qi, its blessings extending across the nine realms. Wherever transformation reaches, none exists without it.

Vast and boundless is the true imperial essence; vast and infinite is the primordial unity. It stabilizes the three powers and subordinates the five phases. The enduring heavens and lasting earth dwell within the Great Ultimate’s embrace. The sun’s yang and the moon’s yin flourish beneath the true primordial’s governance. Those who attain the great thereby achieve harmony and longevity; those who lose it wither prematurely. Within the great expanse, all named beings transform in accordance with its changes and look up to its transformations.

The true unity’s primordial qi generates and transforms in boundless measure—I cannot name its nature, so I forcibly call it the Dao. The Dao’s virtue is vast and cannot be without [omission]. I ascribe its origin to the mysterious sages. Its virtue, when broadly expounded, is clearly evident, resembling the true light’s radiant splendor. Even the divine books and secret scrolls—what more could they add?

It is said: The mysterious sages complete their chapters—how wondrous and boundless! They reveal the teachings to heaven, earth, and humanity, their virtue unceasing. Yet your servants, in their ignorance, are insufficient to comprehend the celestial plan. Today, we are most fortunate to encounter the Highest Emperor’s exalted virtue and sagely wisdom, his great illumination and penetrating insight. We now wish to hear the great teachings, daring to present them before the imperial presence. We humbly hope for your gracious attention.”

He replied: “What the mysterious sages esteem are three virtues. The first expounds supreme virtue; the next, luminous conduct; and the third, the teachings of conduct and prohibitions against wrongdoing. Though these three teachings differ in name, they never deviate from the Great Ultimate. All uniformly descend virtue to enact the subtle and wondrous transformations of the Dao. This is what we in the Upper Realm hold most precious.”

Should one fail to follow the subtle transformations of the Dao, how then could one advance upon the Way of True Primordial qi? Alas! How indeed could it be possible?

Thereupon, the immortals of the Upper Realm, led by the Venerable Guangling, raised their voices in praise of this grand discourse, extolling its profound words:

“The azure depths stretch boundless,
The cloud-palaces gleam resplendent.
Within them dwells sagely wisdom,
Unfolding the dragon-script of celestial decree.
The Great Ultimate flows vast,
True Primordial qi shines like jade.
Virtue descends with name,
Its transformations boundless through the Dao.
Luminous teachings shine forth,
Mysterious guidance spreads far.
Those who can inherit this—
Are the ministers who serve the Upper Realm.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable addressed the assembled immortals of the Three Nets, saying: “What the celestial work esteems above all is guidance and instruction. To universally deliver gods and humans, all may attain the utmost subtlety—departing from form, aligning with non-action. Thus freed from the sufferings of birth, transformation, descent, and mortality, they may obtain the Way of refined True Primordial qi. Today, I shall instruct the Purple Empyrean; can you, my disciples, follow?”

Thereupon, the assembled immortals pledged to obey the imperial decree. At that moment, the incense burners paused, emitting auspicious smoke, and flowers bloomed in fragrant mist. The immortal soldiers set forth on their path, bearing banners that fluttered in formation. The celestial guards led the way, wielding swords that gleamed with divine radiance. The immortals, in their ranks, attended the imperial procession. Phoenix canopies billowed, dragon chariots rumbled. Ascending the five-cloud imperial carriage, the ministers drove nine-spotted leviathans. Crimson wheels lingered as clouds and mist bore them aloft; white cranes soared as wind and haze intertwined. The yellow gates rose in tiers, the azure heavens stretched distant. The first chime of the qing bell rang out, and immortal melodies rose in graceful turns. The cymbals and bells dispersed, and celestial music resounded with resonant harmony. Jade maidens waved their banners, emerging from the mysterious void; golden youths beat time, descending upon the Purple Void.

The Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm expounded the *Scripture of the Way of True Primordial Communion with Immortals*. The *Power Returns to the Plain Non-Being* chapter states:

Within the realm of Purple Clarity, the land of azure clouds, amid the celestial mists, there resides the Supreme August One. Leaning upon a jade table of the Yellow Dragon, his celestial bearing is majestic. Seated within the golden chariot of the White Unicorn, the sound of its bells rings clear. True Persons flank the axle, flying through the misty hubs. Divine immortals guide the carriage, treading upon the rushing clouds. Winds flutter the dragon banners; clouds swirl around the crane-feathered robes. They step through the Gate of Clear Yang, ascending the Heaven of Flying Spirits, entering the realm of the Three Radiant Ones—the wondrous and true domain of Purple Empyrean. Suddenly, melodious voices drift by, their pure tones floating and free. The assembled immortals draw near to listen; the Venerable Guangling gazes from afar. Clouds bear the Crane Terrace into the distance; winds lead the starry banners into formation. Among them, the presiding master is named the Immortal Lord of Pure Capital. Gazing upon the cloud-borne carriage, he pays homage before the imperial seat:

*“We revere the Most Sagely One,
Whose immortal journey graces Purple Clarity.
The nine-sun chariot turns in graceful arcs,
Ten-flowered clouds trail in its wake.
Today, we are most fortunate to encounter your presence.
Daring to hope for the celestial grace,
We humbly beseech your divine attention,
And pray for your compassion.”*

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable granted their prayer. At that time, the perfected ones presented the jade-green imperial regalia, descending from the imperial palace. They raised the Purple Clarity imperial carriage, arriving at the royal court. Naturally, clouds and mountains formed in towering majesty; the qi of the Dao flowed and transformed, the immortal gardens vast and shimmering. The capital of rosy clouds, the halls of auspicious mist—corridors echoed in the distant haze, palace courtyards gleamed with radiance. Jade flowers drifted down amid the clouds; crimson staffs scattered in the courtyard below. Azure dragons offered treasures in the ponds; white deer bore lingzhi herbs along the railings. Divine simurghs wove through the crimson steps; celestial unicorns exhaled fragrance upon the jade terraces.

The Supreme August One ascended the throne of carved jade; cloud officials attended in the golden hall. Thereupon, the Immortal Lord offered incense and presented offerings, extending the rites to all the perfected ones. Once the vegetarian feast was arranged, the Heavenly Venerable and Supreme August One addressed the Immortal Lord, saying:

*“We receive the mandate of the Jade Clarity Lord,
Entrusted with the honor of the Upper Realm’s throne.
Delighting in the principle of Great Communion with the Radiant and True,
We govern the celestial administration and the boundless Way of Primordial qi.
Gazing down upon the multitudes,
What strategy could be lacking?
Yet they lose virtue and stray from the Primordial,
Failing to return to the Great Plain of Simplicity.”*

The ceaseless descent of mortals fills Us with profound sorrow. Then, We summoned the radiant light of flying spirits to assemble the hosts of all heavens. Desiring to reckon the myriad perfected ones, We traversed the Nine Heavens, dispatching the stalwart officials of the True to bestow transformation through teaching.

Moreover, the sagely lord’s instruction is to transform by aligning with virtue. This virtue is that by which Heaven and Earth attain harmony, the ten thousand classes of beings come into existence, and men, if they follow it, ascend to immortality. In the era when the sagely lord’s virtue and teaching prevailed, none among gods or men could fathom it—only the True Sovereign recognized it and inscribed it upon the Jade Capital. Tracing its great origin, virtue is held most precious. Consider the ten directions’ immortal lords: though they have not heard the True Scriptures, by their virtue they have attained great accomplishment, and now they rank among the immortal courts—surely the ultimate of virtue.

The Immortal Lord said: *“Your servant, trembling with awe, reverently gazes upon Your august presence, having emerged from the golden palaces of the Nine Empyreans to convene with the immortals at the corners of the Jade Capital. Your singular decree of great strategy descends to instruct us, your servants. We humbly wish to hear: of the Ten Heavenly Lords, what meritorious deeds did they perform in the past to become Heavenly Kings today? Your servant knows not how this came to be. We beseech the Most Sagely One to graciously bestow compassion. Overwhelmed with trepidation, we await Your celestial judgment.”*

The reply came: *“To establish virtue is what the Supreme Most venerates. To lose virtue is what the August Emperor forbids. Thus, those who perfect virtue through cultivation and harmonious refinement—those who concentrate spirit and qi—may then ascend to the Jade Throne. Without the ceaseless accumulation of merit through practice, how could one attain the celestial rank? Now, let Us inquire of you all: We may freely expound upon the highest good. The virtuous lords of old, while still among men, all mastered the Three Tombs’ classics and understood the Seven Divisions’ scriptures. Their vast virtue and universal salvation elevated their spirits to the ten directions.*

*The Supreme August Lord of the Upper Realm’s Primordial Void Immortal Court once practiced supreme virtue, showing compassion to the people of his land. The Venerable Virtue Immortal Lord of the Lower Realm’s Myriad Transformations Heavenly Court formerly administered virtuous governance, loyally serving the sagely lord. The Dawn Radiance Immortal Lord of the Eastern Florescence’s Divine Transformation Heavenly Court once practiced filial piety and fraternal duty, his heart set on acts of life-saving. The Vermilion Radiance Immortal Lord of the Southern Culmen’s Vermilion Yang Luminous Heavenly Court early cultivated virtuous deeds, achieving world-transcending merit. The Pure Harmony Immortal Lord of the Western Numinous’s Primordial Purity Heavenly Court; he illuminated the Dharma of awakening, practiced lofty and pure conduct, expounded the Three Vehicles’ models, and inaugurated the Four Schools’ strategies. The Primordial Darkness Immortal Lord of the Northern True’s Primordial Abyss Heavenly Court refined inner and outer elixirs, followed the protection of yin and yang, unfolded the Four Assistants’ origins, and revered the Three Caverns’ mysteries. The Luminous Script Immortal Lord of the Northeastern Dawn’s Central Completion Heavenly Court bore the rise and fall of Heaven’s movements, harmonized the waxing and waning of temporal things, recited the Three Sovereigns’ teachings, and practiced the Five Constants’ Dao. The Advancing Dao Immortal Lord of the Southeastern Peace’s Vermilion Florescence Heavenly Court established temples to deliver beings, practiced ritual teachings to save the dead, propagated the Nine Heavens’ Dharma, and received the Three Realms’ registers. The Vermilion Florescence Immortal Lord of the Earthly Domain’s Vast Peace Heavenly Court initially transmitted the writings of the Master of Penetrating Mystery, ultimately revering the principles of the Perfected One of Cavernous Spirit. He relinquished harm to embrace beneficial nature, abided in non-action while advancing spontaneity. At intervals, he guided and led to nourish qi and flavor; at times, he breathed to return primordial essence. He penetrated the principles of the Cavernous True and Cavernous Mystery, aligning with the wondrous transformative source of the primordial spirit. The Dark Origin Immortal Lord of the Heavenly Pillar’s Supreme Purity Joyous Heavenly Court once advanced his heart in the Celestial Lord of Destiny’s teachings and diligently applied himself to the statutes of the Primordial Dao. Knowing black and white, he employed the Mysterious Female; ingesting celestial qi, he transmitted spirit. He consumed immortal medicines to subdue yin’s corporeal soul, refined the divine elixir to transmute yang’s ethereal soul. He absorbed the clarity of the Two Luminaries and Seven Origins, embraced the harmony of the Eight Vastnesses and Five Wefts. Thus, he preserved the true unity of the primordial qi, discerned the first and ninth yang lines. Therefore, the elixir formed within, and his conduct was perfected without.*

*All these lords of old refined spirit, refined qi, refined form, refined substance. Without hesitation, they consumed and ingested, studying the writings of the Flame Emperor. With reasoned regulation, they practiced the books of the Yellow Emperor. Thus, their virtue filled the lower realms, their thoughts purified and wearied of the world. Their bodies transformed, their spirits shed, they ascended as immortals inscribed in white script. Riding the cloud paths, they roamed freely to the Purple Culmen, returning to the Primordial of Great Simplicity. Yet even so, they had not heard the cloud-script True Writings.”*

Thereupon, the Immortal Lord of the Pure Capital, reverently bearing the Heavenly grace, said: *“Vast indeed is virtue! Your servants have all received Your teaching.”*

At that time, the Purple Void Perfected One of the Upper Realm, his Dao-qi pure and majestic, his immortal countenance divinely radiant, his green hair crowned with a yellow cap, his crane-feather cloak and cloud robes, stepped forth, performed the rites, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: *“Your servant humbly observes that our Master, the August Emperor, radiates sagely virtue in the Phoenix Tower and vibrates divine scriptures across the cloudy heavens, gathering the source of all wonders and extending the vastness of numinous hearing. Your servant’s wish is that the imperial carriage might descend upon Kunlun, universally bestowing compassionate instruction and grandly inaugurating the Dharma’s words. We beseech Your sagely judgment; may the Heavenly might specially permit it.”*

The reply came: *“To convey the subtle and penetrate the wondrous is to transmit the true and orthodox of former masters. To utter words that propagate the Dao is to bestow the mandate of future sages. Since you have inquired, the duty lies in delivering beings. This is the supreme good—how could We refuse?”*

Then, the Lords of the Nine Empyreans and the Kings of the Ten Poles were commanded to don robes embroidered with mountain patterns and array their ranks with starry banners, the celestial soldiers and immortal hosts of the Upper Realm. Bearing the jade-green parasols of the Heavenly procession, they trod the purple void’s cloud paths. The chiming tones of jade bells ceased at the Heavenly Gate, the panpipes’ music arose in unison at the Earthly Portal. The palace halls congealed to return to their origin; the pools and ponds flowed to revert to their source. Clouds swirled in numinous brilliance; winds moved in radiant splendor. Pointing afar to Kunlun, the immortals journeyed and arrived.

*The Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm expounds the Scripture of the True Origin’s Communion with Immortality*
*True Origin’s Communion with Immortality, Lower Scroll*

Now, the Nine Pures stretch into the distant, enfolding the heavens of Kunlun.

One qi congeals in primordial unity, gracing the peaks of Xian by the limpid streams. The celestial mountains rise in towering majesty; the brook’s waters ripple and flow, their clear currents encircling the cloud-wreathed divine pavilions and celestial cities. Amidst the mist and clouds, the hosts of the manifold heavens assemble, their regalia arrayed with the jade-green parasols of the Heavenly procession, ocarinas and flutes harmonizing with the music of jade and stone. Solemnly attending the Heavenly Thearch’s imperial carriage, they enter together the Mystic Flower’s numinous park. All is wreathed in purple mists of divine transformation, the cloud-gate palaces and dragon courts. The yang essence coalesces and takes form, the immortal officials ascending the phoenix-paved terraces. They mount the jade altar and ascend the jeweled throne, the perfected attendants and celestial guards reverently standing by the imperial dais.

Thereupon, the Perfected of the Purple Void and the attendants of the immortal palaces strike the bells and sound the chimes, burn incense and scatter blossoms, chant the jade-toned hymns, and present the golden ceremonial silks. Prostrating in reverence, they await the sacred instruction. The Heavenly Venerable of the Upper Realm then addresses the assembly of the Perfected of the Purple Void:

"Of old, the profound and boundless True Origin arose from the Great Dao, commencing at the inception of the Primordial Void. Though the Spirit was One, its form was beyond description. At the dawn of the Grand Beginning, in the Upper Nine, it congealed into the celestial script. Those who comprehend it are naturally revered. Before the wondrous and nameless Supreme Thearch, it first inaugurated the unfolding of the Primordial Chaos. It ordained the Perfected Sovereign of the Heavenly Truth to succeed the era of the Dragon Han. Thus, the cloud-scriptures established their decree, prized within the immortal capital—not as vain or frivolous words, but as profound and resplendent texts. I, by fortune, have inherited the teachings of the Great Cavern and now administer the rites of enlightenment. Should you pose your question, I shall now expound upon it."

At this, the Perfected, hearing the master’s compassionate instruction, bowed twice, knelt in reverence, and prostrated, saying: "I have heard that the virtue of Heaven is most profound, unfolding the Dao without end. Having received your luminous instruction regarding the Origin of Virtue, I now humbly request the cloud-scriptures, hoping for your gracious permission. Gazing upon your sagely virtue, I beseech the descent of your dharma-sound."

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "How magnificent is your inquiry! Without profound contemplation, who could fathom such matters? Though my earlier words briefly illuminated the Way, its depth remains unplumbed. Now, I shall expound further for you.

The Great Void is boundless; the Perfected are self-so. The wondrous subtlety of the vast and undifferentiated, the profound mystery of the Primordial Chaos—these are the lords of luminous images and the forgetting of forms, the origin of the wondrously non-existent and the subtly existent. They cannot be known through sight or hearing, nor grasped through transmission or application. Only the treasure of the formless true spirit is the source of the Primordial Simplicity’s essence. Thus, the qi of this precious source is spirit yet without interval. Supreme is this qi, its unity all-pervading: above, it becomes the vast and boundless gale; below, it sustains the teeming and abundant flow. Within the winds and marshes, the primordial qi abides. How vast is the Mystic Void, the numinous yang’s celestial abyss!

The Mystic One is named Father, endowed with the potent yang’s qi of the One and the Non-Radiant. The Primordial Perfected of the Cavernous Yin embodies the yielding earth’s softness. The True One is called Mother, receiving the feminine white essence of the One. The two halves unite to form the Supreme One. The Supreme One deploys its transformations through divine metamorphosis; the Three Ones generate the Jade Infant, while the Nine Ones complete the full image. The ministers pay homage to the Imperial One as their sovereign.

Thus, the One Qi congeals in primordial unity, establishing the foundation of the Nine Yangs. Its qi is pure and void, subtle and indistinct. In the unfathomable workings of the obscure and dark, the Supreme Harmony’s numbers arise. At the inception of change and transformation, there were the Ancient Perfected. Next came the Supreme Lofty Perfected. In the era of antiquity, at the division of the primordial chaos, they exhorted the Spirit Thearch to descend and ordain the separation of the pure and the turbid. Thus, though not by ability, they were able; though not by necessity, it was so. Thereafter, they unfolded the Dao, elucidated the numinous scriptures, recorded and transmitted their teachings—also known as the cloud-scriptures. They pacified and stabilized the celestial realms, presiding over the center, governing the Eight Extremities, and engendering the Five Constants. Thus, the Three Powers and Nine Qi bestowed their grace upon the True Origin. The Cavernous Perfected transformed the workings of spirit, water, wood, fire, earth, and metal, shaping forms upon the earth. The Primordial Numinous revolved the qi of wind, fire, summerheat, dampness, dryness, and cold, distributing the mysterious across the heavens. Their transformations flowed through the seasons, and the generation of beings was thereby assured.

The Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, and Supreme Yin succeed one another; the Lesser Yang, Yang Brightness, and Supreme Yang follow in turn. Ending and beginning anew, they emulate the linked rings. They are the origin of the most divine and the lord of wondrous transformation.

Later, the Cavernous Spirit of the Primordial Chaos and Supreme Ultimate Thearch divided their radiance across the ages. The Cavernous Perfected of the Primordial Origin again commanded the Perfected Sovereign of the Mystic Dao to inscribe the cloud-scriptures, designating them as the True Writ. Their words transcend the florid embellishments of the Radiant and the Prodigious; their principles enfold the intent of the Profound and Obscure. Engraved upon crimson crystal jade and adorned with azure auroral characters, they are the celestial teachings of the heavenly order, not the common words of the mundane world. Enshrined within a cinnabar-sealed pouch and placed upon a verdant auroral pedestal, their divine radiance descends and gathers, resembling clouds and mist. Secretly sealed within the Jade Treasury of the Perfected King of the Divine Empyrean Heaven, they were guarded by the Celestial Void Immortals, who marshaled the valiant celestial soldiers to protect the precious scriptures of the cloud-scriptures and True Writ.

At the kalpa of the Kaihuang era, the August High One of the Great Existence issued a decree from the Heaven of Equal Purity, specially proclaiming my mandate. The Celestial Prime Minister of the Supreme Mystery Capital and the Perfected Lord of the Heavenly Pivot were commanded to open the jeweled pedestal, retrieve the untransmitted scripture, and bestow it upon me. Having received and expressed my gratitude, I withdrew, thereby attaining the boundless capacity for enlightenment—what teachings could surpass this? This is the most wondrous and divine scripture of the Heavenly Venerable of the Great Veil, a treasure none can equal.

When the great kalpa turns and the time of the Nine Sixes arrives, it shall be the year of advancing its power. Then, one may ascend the cloud chariot, follow the wind-drawn steeds, and promulgate these cloud-scriptures as an eternal teaching, universally bestowing deliverance upon humanity—is this not fitting? Should the celestial and terrestrial beings recite and comprehend them, they may complete their practice in a single day. By the imperial decree, they shall be summoned to transcend the mortal world. Escaping the苦海 of suffering, they shall ascend the immortal realms of unending light. Riding the azure simurgh’s chariot, they shall enter the Purple Obscurity’s capital, pay homage at the Crimson Gate’s palace, and wander the Mystic Orchard’s gardens. There, they shall commune with the origin of the Dao’s qi and the Perfected, delighting in the wondrous and unfathomable transformations. Is not this sagely achievement most excellent?"

Thereupon, the august commissioner of the imperial destiny and the scribe of the immortals transmitted the Crimson Jade Book of the Supreme Void. Its radiant brilliance gathered and coalesced into resplendent hues, which they bestowed upon the Perfected of the Purple Void.

The Perfected received it, and with reverent invocation and solemn prayer, proclaimed to the Heavenly Venerable: "Your lofty virtue, vast and towering, seeks to spread the profound mysteries of the cloud-script, thus revealing them to the assembly of heaven and humanity. To rescue the benighted and corrupt of this age, and to emulate the equalizing transformations of the Dao—such is the Heavenly Compassion’s teaching, a singular act of merciful bestowal. Yet I humbly consider my own capacities, though still unrefined and incomplete. Having received the Heavenly Mandate, how dare I not comply? Now, in solemn obedience, I shall reverently proclaim it:

If one truly wishes to magnify these ancient cloud-scriptures and celestial writings, to illuminate the Dao of the Cavern-Real, the Primordial Origin, and the Mystic Communion—then let virtue suffuse the immortal canons, for nothing is beyond attainment. With my full merit, I shall respond to the karmic tide and deliver humankind. Truly, as you have said, is this not magnificent?

The *Cavern-Real Primordial Writ of the Cloud-Scriptures: Opening the Source of the Dao* states:

The cloud-scriptures of the Three Heavens, the wondrous and true One,
Vast and silent, dim and obscure,
Elusive and boundless, of being and non-being intertwined.
The Dao is great and boundless, naturally nameless.
The primordial chaos knows no limit, whence the Five Ultimates arose.
Still and desolate, the divine qi first stirred;
Quiescent and active, it responds and purifies anew.
The Mystic Lord fashions all things, the Yellow Mother conceives souls.
In the harmony of primordial qi, forms take shape and divide.
The First Azure inaugurates the covenant, inscribing the Eight Gates.
Through them, the myriad beings are enlivened, and the fluid of life nourishes the sentient.
The imperial origin flourishes, not through writing yet written,
Pervading all, in every direction weaving the warp of scripture.
Qi circulates and nurtures all, from ancient times to the present.
The immortals’ virtue suffuses, their conduct perfectly harmonized.
They refine and solidify the peaks, infusing the root of true qi.
The Mud-Pill Emperor’s Unity, the Cinnabar Infant of Yang,
The Crimson Palace resplendent, the Yellow Court of Grand Harmony—
When merit and conduct are both complete, they ascend to the Upper Capital.
The Great Luo stretches boundlessly, the Jade Clarity’s palace.
The Teaching Lord imparts his instructions, whether in absence or presence.
The Nine Perfected have awakened, the Mandate’s origin profound and luminous.

The *Scripture of Wondrous Oneness of Being and Non-Being*:
The feminine and masculine as one, qi transforms and engenders spirit.
The true and constant Primordial Beginning, the mystic source’s transforming mist.
Subtly entering wondrous being, vastly abiding in heaven and earth.
In solemn contemplation of the Sage Lord, preserving the true and numinous.
The Yin Morning’s Grand Inception, the Yang Splendor’s qi exalted.
Light floats in Brahmanic radiance, grandly journeying to meet the welcoming.
The emptiness and cavernous are revered, treasuring this precious attainment.
The divine phoenix dances, the jade fields and pure gold.
The Three Flowers and Cinnabar Mystery, the Nine Gates arrayed in heaven.
Oh, the divine transformation! All attain eternal life.

The *Scripture of the Cavern-Real Primordial Dao*:
The cavernous communicates with the true, the Non-Exalted and White Origin.
The vast spirits leap forth, the Five Emperors’ expansive immortals.
Shaking the Nine Abysses, wondrously transforming and enlivening all.
Body and triumph unite, in accord with the divine source.
Within, the soaring clouds, azure mists and purple haze.
Boundless and merged, crystalline and towering.
Refining the Six Radiant Ones, cultivating the Yellow Mystery.
Eternally bearing form and spirit, ascending to the vast and great.
[Untranslatable characters]."

The radiant essence coalesces, the grand qi flourishes in splendor.
The Way advances in sequence, its intent directed toward the profound.
The Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces align, the Five Agents and Six Harmonies converge.
The brine channels gleam bright, wondrous jade congeals upon the waves.
The great qi surges vast, attaining the true Primordial Dao.

Thereupon, the Purple Void Perfected One bowed in reverence and withdrew.
Driving his spirit-steed, he trod the hues of cloud and mist.
Striking the immortal music, he stirred the celestial sounds of heaven’s harmony.
The attendants bearing azure banners and yellow pennants emerged,
accompanied by officers in star-crowned caps and cloud-woven robes.
All the retinue of officials trod upon the emerald haze.
As the mist and clouds wafted gently, the celestial gates were unlocked.

At that time, the host of divine immortals and perfected beings of the many heavens
had repeatedly received the sublime discourses of the August Void’s great compassion.
They declared: “We, your servants, are most fortunate to encounter such sacred grace.
Proclaimed are the wondrous transformations of the true spirits,
and made clear is the Dao of primordial qi that permeates and quickens all life.”
Thus, the great assembly, deeply reverent, extolled the majestic and virtuous teachings.
They then chanted in unison the *Steps of the Void*,
their voices rising as one like celestial immortals amid the clouds,
soaring forth from the grotto-heaven.
In the ethereal and natural realm, they roamed freely, venerating the Numinous Treasure.
In the distant kalpas of primordial creation, these cloud-script texts were transmitted.
Luminous indeed is the principle that pervades the mysterious,
and manifest is the unfolding of the Cavern-Real.
The great penetration flows through the wondrous origin,
the divine transformations adapt to the pure and dark.
What is the meaning of this? It is simply to deliver humankind.
Those who return to the ultimate transformation
shall ascend on clouds to attend the imperial throne.

The perfected immortals then bowed in gratitude and withdrew,
each riding clouds back to their celestial abodes.
At that moment, the jade dragons raised their heads,
their roars resounding with the force of mist-laden radiance.
The golden simurghs lifted their voices,
their songs weaving the dance of heaven’s harmony.
The divine immortals of the Highest Heaven, their majesty solemn,
brandished the Nine-Palace treasure swords and unfurled the Ten Transcendent spirit-pennants.
Our Supreme Heavenly Venerable One, serene and joyful,
rode the jade-reined spirit-dragon, bearing the jeweled canopy of harmonious bells.
The celestial maidens, graceful and fair,
held jade vases of lotus, their pure fragrance rich and pervasive.
The immortal maidens, elegant and radiant,
grasped golden censers of wondrous grottoes, their auspicious vapors curling and dense.
They waved the banners of the Great Transformation’s wondrous observation,
and struck the jade-light rhythm of the True Flower.
The morning attendants sang and played music, its notes resonant and clear.
The divine guards marched forth, banners and flags fluttering.
Auspicious winds whispered, stirring sleeves and setting jade pendants chiming.
Felicitous clouds drifted gently, encircling the chariot wheels and swirling about rainbow robes.
Preparing to return to the celestial palace,
they first ascended beyond the Starry River.

Thereupon, the azure registers inscribed with phoenix script were recorded,
and the cinnabar crucibles stilled the dragon-script incense.
Alas! The clouds of Kunlun soared,
raining down osmanthus blossoms in joyous abandon.
The echoes of the altar’s rites dissolved,
the clashing of golden cymbals fading into stillness.
The image of the celestial pole’s wondrous transformation,
the form of the divine abyss’s profound obscurity—
neither wind nor dew’s domain,
the mystery of presence and absence.
The true origin returns to the foundation of the Great Beginning,
the empty void reverts to the nameless root.

The Supreme Heavenly Venerable One concluded the *Scripture of the True Origin’s Permeating Immortal Dao*.

At that time, the Most High addressed Gong Ziming:
“I have heard that learning progresses through discipleship, and the Dao is transmitted by a master.
Though disciples may begin their studies under a teacher,
the pursuit of ultimate truth arises from innate nature.
Thus, even Bo Le cannot drive a dull nag and make it a unicorn,
nor can a master craftsman hew rotten wood into a ridgepole.
For truly, rotten wood cannot be carved,
and a wall of dung and earth cannot be plastered.”

The *Record of the True Origin* states:
“The ancestral masters of the teaching were serene and without action,
devoted solely to the pursuit of longevity.
Alas, sentient beings are deluded by the snares of desire and attachment—
how could they be without fault?
The supreme sages, moved by compassion, constantly strive to save humankind.
When people in the world suffer bodily disharmony,
mild cases become illness, and severe ones turn to disease.
Amid misfortunes and calamities, or when assailed by demonic influences,
they should face the northwest celestial gate, burn incense, and reverently recite the ten sacred titles:
First, the Supreme Heavenly Master of the Qian Origin;
Second, the Central August Supreme True Dharma King;
Third, the Supreme Sovereign of the Nine Yangs and True Origin;
Fourth, the Supreme Transcendent Lord of the Three Caverns’ Transformative Teaching;
Fifth, the Merciful and Compassionate Great Constant Wondrous Dao of the Ten Heavens’ Flourishing Sagely Talent;
Sixth, the Supreme Venerable of Pure Forgiveness and Virtue, Responding to All Heavens’ Titles;
Seventh, the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable One of the Boundless Above;
Eighth, the Supreme Heavenly Venerable One of the Dao and Virtue of the Boundless Above;
Ninth, the Heavenly Venerable One of Universal Compassion and Salvation from Suffering of the Above;
Tenth, the Heavenly Venerable One of the Jade Void and Luminous August of the Above.

Prostrating in reverence, we recall the celestial titles of the Heavenly Venerables,
inscribed within the jade cases of the Daoist canon.
In the blessed lands of the mortal realm, people propagate the scriptures of the Most High.”

With reverent devotion and sincere faith, the living shall receive blessings; with incense and floral offerings, the departed shall ascend to heaven. May all people of the world together partake in this luminous efficacy. When petitioning for talismanic water, one shall likewise receive healing. Thus, the talisman is the token of Heaven; water is one aspect of the Dao. If the Dao enters the belly through birth, natural well-being follows.

On days such as *jiazi*, *jiayin*, *jiachen*, *jiawu*, *jiashen*, and *jiaxu*, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Sagely Divine Kings of Wisdom of the Above, the Heavenly Generals of the Balanced Heavens, and the Divine Lads of the True Origin and Medicinal Immortals. May they deign to descend, deploy divine *qi*, treat illnesses, expel malevolence, and eradicate calamities and misfortunes. The prayers and vows expressed in the following passages all follow this precedent and need not be reiterated.

On the days of the Three Primes and the Eight Festivals, inscribe in azure ink the cloud-seal script of the True Origin of the Above. Recite the incantation:

*"The Primordial Beginning is spontaneous,
Azure Yang shrouded in darkness,
Mysterious transformation, empty and vast,
Boundless and formless.
Condensing *qi* to stabilize the realm,
Fragrant through the world in name.
Encompassing all heavens,
Nurturing the myriad spirits.
Cloud chambers and golden nets,
Towering in the Supreme Clarity.
Twelve supreme grades,
Inscribed with primordial essence.
Jade tones penetrate the subtle,
Mysterious echoes resound like jade.
Chanting and intoning issue forth,
The Imperial Perfected descends to the court.
Curved reflections hang like branches,
I offer to the Supreme Spirits.
Attaining rank equal to Heaven,
The Three Luminaries merge in brilliance.
Eternally preserving the Great Void,
Unshaken through kalpas."*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Supreme Lord Emperor.*

Within each person’s sixty-day cycle of *jiazi*, all procedures are to be fully observed. Next, on days such as *yichou*, *yimao*, *yisi*, *yiwei*, *yiyou*, and *yihai*, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Mighty Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Might, and the Supreme Mystery Lads. Following this, on days such as *bingzi*, *bingyin*, *bingchen*, *bingwu*, *bingshen*, and *bingxu*, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Sagacious Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Great Might, and the Supreme Origin Lads. Continuing, on days such as *dingchou*, *dingmao*, *dingsi*, *dingwei*, *dingyou*, and *dinghai*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Majestic Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of the Above, and the Supreme Void Lads. Proceeding to days such as *wuzi*, *wuyin*, *wuchen*, *wuwu*, *wushen*, and *wuxu*, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Auspicious Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Communication, and the Supreme Emptiness Lads. Further, on days such as *jichou*, *jimao*, *jisi*, *jiwei*, *jiyou*, and *jihai*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Virtuous Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Radiance, and the Supreme Immortal Lads. Additionally, on days such as *gengzi*, *gengyin*, *gengchen*, *gengwu*, *gengshen*, and *gengxu*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Numinous Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Wisdom, and the Supreme Perfected Lads. Moreover, on days such as *xinchou*, *xinmao*, *xinsi*, *xinwei*, *xinyou*, and *xinhai*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Revered Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Numinosity, and the Supreme Wisdom Lads. Again, on days such as *renzi*, *renyin*, *renchen*, *renwu*, *renshen*, and *renxu*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Manifest Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of Celestial Fruition, and the Supreme Auspicious Lads. Finally, on days such as *guichou*, *guimao*, *guisi*, *guiyou*, and *guihai*, with sincere devotion, pay homage to the hosts of the Communicative Divine Kings, the Heavenly Generals of the Celestial Canopy, and the Supreme Virtue Lads.

Within the above six cycles of *jiazi*, pay homage to the hosts of the True Origin divine immortals. The prayers and vows expressed are all identical. They deliver and protect all beings, ensuring peaceful fruition. If one ingests the talisman, it can dispel misfortune. Not only does it dispel misfortune and disperse calamity, but it also cures illnesses and heals diseases. Only through single-minded, devout faith can one receive the methods of the Nine Perfected. If one wears it, it can protect the body. Not only does it protect the body and preserve the spirit, but it also bestows blessings and eliminates misfortune. Moreover, it is inscribed with golden names on purple slips, written in green characters upon the Jade Capital. Once a person attains well-being, it is called the Great Field of Blessing. Within this Field of Blessing, one may cultivate the Supreme True Origin Dao, and upon fulfilling the practices, ascend as an immortal.

According to the *Scripture of the Sagely Chronicle*, if one pays homage and recites the ten titles of the Heavenly Venerable of the Above on the twenty-ninth day of each month, one shall not fall into hell in the future. The *Scripture of Anticipatory Cultivation* states: At the time of death, the virtuous shall be reborn in the natural domain of the Above, ascending according to their wishes. Furthermore, the *Preface to the Chart of Heavenly Officials* states: The Dao is fundamentally empty and nonexistent, yet through the obscure and indistinct, things come into being. The primordial *qi* of things is originally harmonious; it first rides the transformations of movement to differentiate forms. The subtle images of essence become manifest, arranging palaces and towers in the pure realms. The hidden essences silently congeal, opening grotto-heavens in the famous mountains. The Primordial Sovereign precedes the Lord of Images, uniquely transforming and standing alone as the True Master. Profoundly tranquil and still, it responds when stimulated—how majestic!

The *Scripture of the Jade Capital* declares: The myriad immortals of the Ten Flowers gather, forming palaces with purple mist. How luminous are the sagely ones, for their virtue and power are thus accomplished. Thus, the Proclaimed King is without preference yet without exclusion; the Most High is without action yet without inaction. The Mysterious Sovereign rode a white deer to ascend to heaven; the Yellow Emperor mounted a fiery dragon to depart the world. Dwelling high in golden halls, resting in jade terraces, they all knew the Dao of long life—this is surely not false.

Those who cultivate the Dao and practice virtue encompass five aspects. First, cultivating the Dao within the body entails calming the heart and expanding one’s nature, cherishing *qi* and nurturing the spirit, reducing selfishness and curbing desires, thereby prolonging life and extending years. All falsity is eradicated, and one’s virtue becomes the conduct of a true person. Second, cultivating the Dao within the family entails a father’s kindness, a son’s filial piety, an elder brother’s friendliness, a younger brother’s deference, a husband’s trustworthiness, and a wife’s virtue. With harmony above and below, one’s virtue becomes the method of abundance. Third, cultivating the Dao within the village entails respecting the elderly, nurturing the young, instructing the ignorant and unrefined, so that the hundred surnames live in harmony, with trust and reverence above and below. Such virtue endures long.

One cultivates the Dao within the state by ensuring the ruler’s trustworthiness and the ministers’ loyalty, the court free from obstruction, ritual and music naturally flourishing, the hundred officials fulfilling their duties, calamities and disorders never arising, and the myriad treasures abundant and ripe—such virtue becomes full and substantial. One cultivates the Dao throughout the world by transforming without speech, governing without instruction, acting with simplicity and non-action, harmonizing all into great unity, so that every household merits enfeoffment, and transformation extends even to foreign lands—such virtue becomes all-pervading.

Those who advance the Dao and establish virtue live; those who violate the Dao and oppose virtue die. Thus, Heaven possesses the Four Controller stars, located between *Xu* and *Wei*, beside the Human star, to oversee humanity. The two *Siming* stars govern one’s merits and faults, years and lifespan, rewards and deprivations. The two *Silu* stars govern one’s official rank, emoluments, clothing, and sustenance. The two *Siwei* stars govern one’s arrogance, dissipation, and impropriety. The two *Sifei* stars govern one’s perversity, delusion, and selfishness.

How luminous is Heaven’s manifestation of these! It bestows and withdraws its officers accordingly. The mirror of the sun shines here—how could one not reflect upon and understand this?
