The work of obscuring traces is but a false echo.
The pure qi, in its uncarved simplicity, remains dim and veiled.
The flowing talisman casts fleeting shadows; silence severs the wandering soul.
It bears blossoms through the cycles, qi gathers or scatters in haste.
Fierce flames blaze without base or wheel.
The radiance of the transcendent dusk gleams, illuminating the dark essence of the soul.
Blood irrigates the five viscera; the talisman of the Fire Lord takes hold.
The brain is bathed in luminous fluid; the embryo ascends to assist the True.
The border gates remain unmoved; the spirit agitates the Gate of Life.
Gazing, one summons wind and rain—yet all is vast and still, each kind clinging to its root.

Three transformations settle into constancy; nine transformations reach the divine.
The first bears the sun; the second divides the moon’s phases.
The pure and numinous converge in submission; the clogs of the feet are cast off to rouse the True.
The heart lies concealed in resolve; traces vanish into the hidden gate.
It pierces the veiling haze, stealing the thunderous conveyance of Yu.
The emperor’s mandate spans the ages—*the Yang Talisman is its heart*.
The myriad transformations of all things endure through kalpas without end.
