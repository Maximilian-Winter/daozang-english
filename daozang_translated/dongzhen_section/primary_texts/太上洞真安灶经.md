*The Supreme Cavern of Perfection Scripture for Pacifying the Hearth*

The Supreme Primordial Most High ascended his unicorn-drawn feathered chariot, descending upon the golden-silver altar of Kunlun Mountain, seated upon a terrace of myriad treasures. At that moment, the divine immortals of the ten directions and three realms came to pay homage and attend his presence.

There was the Hearth Mother, the Divine Matron of Cooking, who ascended the cinnabar steps and addressed the throne, saying: "By virtue of past-life blessings, I have been entrusted with governance over the human realm, serving as an official under the Northern Emperor in the lower department, acting as the Director of Destiny for the Five Thearchs, and serving as the Direct Attendant in the Celestial Bureau. I transformed the customs of drinking blood and eating raw flesh, refining them into the arts of cooking and preparing meals. I record the karmic merits and transgressions of the world’s people and oversee the affairs of the monthly dark and new moons. Yet, I am often offended by the vulgar sentiments and base manners of the common folk, and so I dare to present this petition, awaiting the sagely decree."

The Most High replied: "The dwelling (*zhai*) is for shelter, the house (*wu*) for residence, the chamber (*shi*) for rest, and the abode (*she*) for auspiciousness. The people of the world know only to erect towering halls and carve ornate walls, recklessly adorning them with extravagance. They do not realize that the Director of Destiny, the Hearth Lord, presides over the central hall, favoring only purity and tranquility, safeguarding the common folk.

If people can carefully tend to their hearths, ensuring that no bronze or iron implements—knives or axes—nor the feathers of fowl or fur of beasts, nor impure firewood or defiled water, violate the taboos, they may prevent discord in the household and sudden illness among its members.

The ritual is as follows: Each month, on an auspicious day and propitious night, one may set a pot of pure water, lay out a mat of fragrant grass, arrange an offering table, burn incense, and present wine and fruit. Summon the Lord Director of Destiny for the Five Thearchs and the spirits of the Six Gui Divine Maidens, and as if in the presence of the true divinities, recite the incantation:

*Northern Emperor, Supreme Spirit,*
*Six Gui Divine Maidens.*
*I now perform this sacrifice,*
*May you preside as host.*
*Divine waters flow abundantly,*
*Incense and lamps are raised in unison.*
*I gaze reverently toward your numinous chariot,*
*Come and attend this offering site.*

After the incantation, dip a willow branch into the water and sprinkle it upon the ritual space. Then recite again:

*Cool and clear, the moon’s repast,*
*Refined delicacies beyond thought.*
*Five fragrances in pure water,*
*Sweetly scattered by willow’s touch.*

By thus reciting the scripture in accordance with its teachings and presenting one’s case before the sages, one may ensure a father’s kindness and a son’s filial piety, a husband’s lead and a wife’s compliance, an elder brother’s deference and a younger’s obedience, proper order between high and low, harmony among all members, joy in times of misfortune, prosperity in the household, peace among kin, tranquility in rest and meals—what need is there to fear malevolent spirits or ghosts that bring calamity upon people?

One must strictly avoid loud speech or coarse language, violating taboos and incurring misfortune, or allowing foul and putrid impurities to offend. If these are transgressed, ghosts and demons will be summoned, and one will suffer disaster in return."

Thereupon, the sagely decree was proclaimed, and the following gatha was recited:

*The Dao preserves life,*
*Life preserves the Dao.*
*To pacify the dwelling is to pacify the self,*
*To cherish the self is to cherish the Dao.*
*If the Director of Destiny is revered,*
*A thousand evils find no path to approach.*
*Hearth Mother and Six Gui Spirits,*
*In food and drink lies the mystery of the true spirits.*
*Serenity and harmony, true harmony,*
*Longevity—aging is not old age.*

At that moment, as the Celestial Worthy finished expounding the scripture, the divine immortals of the three realms, the Hearth Mother, and the Divine Matron of Cooking vowed to uphold the sagely decree and forever abide by it.

*Thus concludes The Supreme Cavern of Perfection Scripture for Pacifying the Hearth.*
