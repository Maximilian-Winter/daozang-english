*The Scripture on the Supreme Perfection of the True One’s Repayment of Parents’ Profound Kindness*

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Seven Jeweled City of the Western Jasper Realm, within the Lapis Lazuli Palace, expounding the Dao as ever to the assembled host of celestial transcendents. An innumerable throng encircled him in reverence.

At that time, among the assembly was a transcendent named Superior Wisdom (Shangzhi), who bowed and advanced, addressing the Celestial Worthy: "From kalpas past, your disciple has repeatedly heard the true Dao, yet of all teachings, none surpasses the repayment of parents’ profound kindness. Though I have not beheld its causes and conditions, I pray you, let me hear your wondrous voice and expound it for the multitude, that future generations may receive and cultivate it."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Compose your mind and listen closely; I shall now speak for you.

All people under heaven owe their bodily existence to their parents, who conceive and nurture them in the womb, where they receive qi and endure boundless suffering. For ten months, the gestation swiftly progresses without pause. When the time of birth arrives, their limbs and vessels dissolve in agony. Many perish in the process, while those who survive as infants are tenderly reared—washed of filth, their parents sparing no toil, even harming themselves to ensure their child’s well-being. The kindness of parents is profound, difficult to repay, impossible to measure.

If there be one who, for their parents, diligently establishes vegetarian feasts, widely creates true scriptures, recites and upholds them, and teaches others to follow, know that such a person, along with their parents, shall receive this karmic reward: they will attain longevity, their sustenance will arise naturally, and their minds will abide in joy. If they dedicate merit to the deceased, performing feasts for seven sevens (forty-nine days), reciting sacred texts to aid the departed’s consciousness, they shall not traverse the paths of suffering but ascend to heaven, their bodies arriving at the Jade Capital, their spirits roaming the Golden Towers. Should their parents suffer from lingering illness, the establishment of a ritual arena (daochang) and the cultivation of Daoist rites will restore them to health, as if never afflicted. If their parents face peril—imprisonment, malevolent spirits, venomous creatures, or nightmares—let them reverently purify their minds, recite the Dao, and perform feasts; thus shall calamities recede, and demonic influences vanish. On the day of their birth, let them silently recall their parents’ kindness in giving them life, diligently observe precepts, and widely cultivate good deeds to repay their toil. Those who uphold these practices shall avoid the dark paths and be born into right awakening.

You must follow and proclaim this teaching, disseminate this scripture, and never allow slander or disbelief to arise, lest one incur immeasurable transgressions."

When Superior Wisdom and the assembled celestial host heard these words, they rejoiced and leapt with delight, declaring: "If we encounter such devotees, we shall all protect and shelter them, that they may receive joy and gaze upon the Celestial Worthy without end."

Then they spoke this verse:

The supremely compassionate, peerless Worthy,
True father and mother of all beings.
Who expounds this scripture on repaying kindness—
All who hear it shall awaken.
Those who diligently receive and uphold it
Shall soon ascend the immortal’s path.
A mere fraction of praise, a hair’s tip of merit—
We bow our heads and depart in homage to the Celestial Worthy.
