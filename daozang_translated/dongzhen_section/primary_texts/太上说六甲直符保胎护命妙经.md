**The Most High’s Scripture of the Six Jia Direct Talismans for Protecting the Fetus and Safeguarding Life**

At that time, the Most High Lord of Primordial Beginning was in the Jade Purity Palace, expounding the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures to an immeasurable assembly of sages. Then the Perfected One named Yin Xi arose from the multitude, bowed reverently, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Your servant has observed that in the world, when women carry the union of yin and yang and give birth to sons and daughters, at the moment of delivery, they are harassed by all manner of malevolent spirits—demons, goblins, specters, and ghosts—who recklessly afflict them. Some harm or kill the child, while others cause the mother to rave in delirium, her mind confused and bewildered. How may they be saved? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity and teach what has not yet been heard. If this wisdom is granted, I shall be forever indebted to your sagely grace."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One, saying: "When heaven and earth commingle their essence and yin and yang spread their transformations, when father and mother unite in harmony, a person receives life. In the first month, the fetal essence and blood congeal; in the second, the form of the embryo appears; in the third, the yang spirit becomes the hun-soul; in the fourth, the yin numen settles the po-soul; in the fifth, the organs are divided and the spirit is established; in the sixth, the viscera are fixed and the numen is nourished; in the seventh, the orifices open and light is transmitted; in the eighth, the spirit is complete and the numen descends; in the ninth, the palace chambers are arrayed; in the tenth, the qi is full and the form is perfected. Only then do the hundred spirits take shape, and birth may occur.

What you have asked concerns those sons and daughters born into the world who do not believe in the supreme Dao, do not revere the scriptures, or who bear the weight of past karmic conditions or present transgressions. Ignorant of their former lives and not venerating the true teaching, they place their trust in perverse and demonic forces, their minds growing ever more confused. When they receive the primordial qi and carry the union of yin and yang, at the time of delivery, the true spirits do not attend them, allowing malevolent specters, goblins, and ghosts to recklessly invade. If you wish to save them from this peril of childbirth, you must place faith in my words:

When a woman first conceives, before the ten months are complete, she must cultivate merit in advance, establish a Daoist sanctuary, and commission the copying of this scripture, wholeheartedly making offerings. When the month of delivery arrives, invite Daoist priests—three, five, seven, or ten—either in a temple or at home. Hang silk banners and canopies, light lamps to continue the brightness, burn incense, and perform rites of reverence. Recite this *Scripture of the Six Jia Direct Talismans for Protecting the Fetus and Safeguarding Life* forty-nine times, or a hundred, even a thousand or ten thousand times. Then I shall dispatch the Six Jia Direct Talisman Generals, leading the heavenly soldiers, immortals, jade maidens, and an immeasurable assembly of sages, bearing talismans and holding staffs of office, to descend upon the sanctuary. They will protect the pregnant woman, sparing her from suffering. When mother and child separate, their lives will be safeguarded, their bodies shielded, their dwelling purified, and their household at peace. All demonic and perverse forces will naturally retreat and hide.

The Perfected One Yin Xi, receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s instructions, bowed in reverence and exhorted all people: If there are those who face difficulty in childbirth, they must broadly cultivate merit, reverently commission this scripture, and make offerings with utmost sincerity. Thus will they safeguard life, protect the body, and obtain boundless blessings.

This talisman should be written in cinnabar. The mother should wear it on her head to repel all demonic forces, nightmares, and malevolent influences.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy commands the Six Jia Direct Talisman Divine Lords and their attending officials: Should any woman in the world give birth to a child—whether male or female—on the aforementioned days, you must lead the Six Jia Direct Talisman Divine Lords and their attending officials to protect the fetus and safeguard life, ensuring swift and safe delivery, peaceful rest, and a composed spirit, free from all pain and distress.

If a virtuous woman copies this sutra, enshrines it in purity, burns incense, lights lamps, hangs banners and canopies, and makes offerings with reverence, I shall grant her the vision of the true Dao, longevity, household harmony, success in all endeavors, filial piety, and natural abundance in food and clothing.

Should she face difficulty in childbirth, let her single-mindedly take refuge in this mantra, reciting it forty-nine times, and all divine beings shall constantly guard and protect her.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke the mantra, saying:
*Eight thousand in the world above,*
*Four generals rule the earth below.*
*Three-five officers expel evil ghosts,*
*Four-six youths guard my spirit.*
*Six Jia talismans drive away nightmares,*
*Six Ding jade maidens shield my body.*
*To my left, the Azure Dragon; to my right, the White Tiger,*
*Above, the Vermilion Bird; below, the Dark Warrior.*
*Before me, the Merit Officer; behind, the Registrar,*
*Banishing all demons, nightmares, and curses.*
*If any curse is cast, return it to its sender,*
*All evil spirits must depart—*
*If they linger but a moment, the Heavenly Axe awaits!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking this divine mantra, all the heavenly beings, immeasurable sacred assemblies, and the Six Jia Direct Talisman attending officials heard the sutra with joy, paid homage, and vowed to uphold it.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Sutra of the Six Jia Direct Talismans for Protecting the Fetus and Safeguarding Life*, as spoken by the Most High.
