*The Sutra of the Golden Light Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended the jeweled throne with a great assembly to expound the Dao. Surveying the worlds, he beheld sentient beings enduring manifold sufferings:
Some afflicted by epidemics, their eyes dimmed, though the Three Lights shone, they were as blind—all for failing to revere the Three Treasures.
Some ensnared by karmic grievances and curses, their eyes grown dull, seeing nothing before them.

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy opened the gate of great compassion and skillful means, moved by pity for the people, and proclaimed this sutra to deliver all beings.

Good men and good women, should you encounter this sutra of salvation, swiftly bathe in fragrant waters, establish a ritual arena, recite this sutra with devotion, and make offerings in faith. Thereupon shall appear:
The Golden Light Youth, the Sunlight Youth, the Moonlight Youth, the Light-Opening Youth, the Starlight Youth, the Radiant Light Youth, the Resplendent Light Youth, the Pure Light Youth, the Dao-Eye Youth, the Dharma-Realm Youth, the Perfect Light Youth, and the Wisdom Light Youth.

The Dao declares: These twelve youths dispel calamities. If any being suffers from dimmed vision, hasten to recite this sutra, and they shall naturally be liberated—unobstructed light shall dawn, immortals and perfected beings shall guard them, all evils shall vanish, lingering corpse qi and malevolent spirits shall be banished afar.

Good and faithful men and women who revere this sutra shall find their illnesses healed, their eyes brightened, past karmic obstructions and present transgressions dissolved, their sins erased. Assisted by the host of sages, they shall together behold the light.

This sutra’s divine efficacy is beyond conception. Those who slight it shall bring misfortune upon seven generations and invite disaster upon themselves.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, the perfected immortals, the celestial and terrestrial immortals, and the officials of the Three Realms, having heard this wondrous Dharma, rejoiced greatly and received it with faith to uphold and practice.

Here ends *The Sutra of the Golden Light Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*.
