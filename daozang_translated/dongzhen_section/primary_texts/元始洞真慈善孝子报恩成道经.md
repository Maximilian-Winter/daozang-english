The Dao speaks:
At the inception of the true forms to the left, right, and center, they were divided from the qi of the Primordial’s peerless, supreme Dao in its responsive transformation. They gestated within the numinous jade womb for ninety thousand great kalpas, secluded in profound stillness. After ninety thousand kalpas, by dharma’s decree, they were to manifest in the world, coalescing form and ordering qi, emerging from the jade womb.

At the moment of their emergence, the nine heavens thundered, and the nine earths split open. With their first steps, they ascended upon celestial jeweled lotuses, their bodies radiating golden light like the nascent sun. The two luminaries flanked them, their crystalline radiance gleaming bright; their pupils held the essence of the Dipper, with stars arrayed before the sun’s image. Their hair was green as jade, their teeth aligned like beads, and purple qi trailed into the skies. Wherever they dwelled, clouds of the seven purities shaded them morning and evening, while hidden dragons bore lotuses as their thrones. Celestial lamps and candles illuminated the cloud paths; celestial music and chants resounded in myriad harmonies. Dragons and phoenixes kept time, singing odes to great peace. The harmonious elegance was beyond description.

Sweet springs and wells cured all ailments when drunk; their forms were like gold and jade, free from decay or aging. In effortless harmony, they passed through ninety thousand kalpas.

At that time, the Three Perfected Ones transformed into infant boys, entrusted to a true mother. Gradually, they grew and matured in accordance with the world. The peerless, supreme Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, bestowed upon these Three Perfected Ones the title *Utmost Filial True Kings*. They governed the central lands and oversaw the four barbarian realms; all living beings came to receive their teachings, learning compassion and filial piety, reverence for heaven and obedience to earth, preserving the unity of the precious form, and cherishing all things.

After thirty-three hundred years, they renewed their transformation, refining away impurities through water and fire. At that time, the Three Filial True Kings governed in three realms: one in the sun, one in the moon, and one in the Dipper. Above, they upheld the three luminaries, their brilliance illuminating the darkest nights; in profound governance, they harmonized the three qi, attuning the void and existence. Their responses to change were fleeting, requiring no summons, like a shadow following form, without reliance on thought. Though dwelling in the upper realms, their Dao extended to the lower worlds—without above or below, without bounds or limits. Adapting their teachings to all directions, they delivered beings of all kinds, uniting with those of shared affinity without doubt or error.

Their filial hearts were lofty and far-reaching, their spiritual power unmatched; they could reverse heaven and earth, command yin and yang, extend or contract the workings of fate, and command the thousand spirits. Auspicious omens stirred in response; they soared without wings. In the blink of an eye—within the span of a breath—they traversed the ten thousand heavens, all through the power of utmost filial piety.

Compassion and obedience to the two parents, cherishing all beings, both moving and still—this is the filial Dao of mercy, loving life and detesting killing. Eating meat and drinking wine is not the filial Dao. Indulging in lust and defilement is not the filial Dao. Birth, death, corpses, and decay are not the filial Dao. Harm, injury, and bloodshed are not the filial Dao. Theft, robbery, and deceit are not the filial Dao. Delighting in evil or discussing wickedness is not the filial Dao. Taking pleasure in defilement and baseness, inwardly and outwardly polluted, with a lazy mind and body, neglecting the Dao of life—such is not the filial Dao. A faith that is not steadfast, frivolously following others’ preferences, drifting with events, failing to focus on the One, with scattered mind and qi—this leads to birth, aging, sickness, death, and myriad afflictions. Upon death, one falls into hell, suffering for endless kalpas without hope of escape, lacking good causes and conditions. Forsaking our filial Dao, one incurs all manner of suffering.

Those men and women of later generations who cultivate our filial Dao will share the same virtue as the Dao. Having shared virtue, they will share the same radiance as the Dao. Having shared radiance, they will share the same reality as the Dao. Having shared reality, they will share the same body as the Dao. Having shared the body, they will share the same spirit as the Dao. Having shared the spirit, they will share the same transformations as the Dao. Having shared transformations, they will share the same longevity as the Dao. Having shared longevity, they will share the same existence as the Dao. Having shared existence, they will share the same non-existence as the Dao. Having shared non-existence, there is nowhere that is not non-existent. Nowhere that is not non-existent—yet also nowhere that is not existent. Nowhere that is not existent—profound, empty, and vast. Nowhere that is not non-existent, yet responding to the mind’s changes with boundless transformation.

They may become emperors or loyal ministers, sages or filial children, Daoists or national preceptors, dwelling in cold forests, practicing purity and austerity, reciting scriptures and contemplating the Dao, establishing merit and virtue. They may become great generals, victorious without battle, or accumulate grain and silk to relieve hunger and cold. They may serve as enlightened masters, dispelling plagues and illnesses, bringing myriad benefits to all living beings. They may light lamps and candles to illuminate the long night, or condense ten thousand kalpas into one, or extend a single kalpa into a hundred. A single hair’s tip may surpass the great earth; a single pore may contain the nine great rivers and the four seas, undisturbing the nature of things, unperceived and unknown. They may draw the worlds of the ten directions to the tip of a needle, bringing them before their eyes. All living beings behold the Three Perfected Ones’ dharma bodies of light and qi, expounding the Dharma in myriad forms, each attaining understanding.

Those who uphold our filial Dao can enter realms beyond conception and perform deeds beyond imagination. Those who lose our filial Dao are beyond even the reach of salvation, endlessly cycling through birth and death in ways beyond comprehension.

Those who uphold our filial Dao attain the fruit of fearlessness. First, they depart from the terror of birth and death, attaining the fruit of non-birth-and-death. Second, they depart from the terror of dark obstructions, attaining the fruit of radiance—by day, the light of divine illumination; by night, the lamps of heaven. In time, their bodies emit light, transcending day and night. Third, they depart from the terror of hunger and cold, attaining the fruit of celestial kitchens and heavenly robes. Fourth, they depart from the terror of myriad trials, and all demon kings and fierce beasts come to serve them as attendants and guards. Fifth, they depart from the terror of form, attaining the fruit of formlessness.

To attain the fruit of formlessness is neither extinction nor birth, yet without form or appearance. With this ordinary body, one achieves the body of the Dao, the body merging with light and qi, ascending into formlessness, becoming one with the void. Thus it is called attaining the fruit of formlessness. High or low, one moves as one wishes; gathering or dispersing, one follows the heart; being or non-being, one acts at will, no longer dependent on body or mind.

When filial piety governs the world, laws and decrees are not labored over. When filial piety governs the body, the will and nature become firm and upright. When filial piety governs the hundred illnesses, heaven acts as the physician. When filial piety governs the myriad things, no poisons can harm. When filial piety governs mountains and rivers, grasses and trees do not wither. When filial piety manages livelihood, fields and silkworms yield ten thousandfold. When filial piety reaches heaven, wind and rain come in their seasons. When filial piety reaches earth, the ten thousand kinds are at peace, divine mushrooms and spirit trees appear everywhere as auspicious signs. When filial piety reaches birds and beasts, dragons, unicorns, phoenixes, and simurghs soar and gather within the borders. When filial piety reaches deep pools and marshes, the River Earl offers pearls, fish and dragons leap, and waves grow still.

Simply by being filial to one’s parents, one repays their boundless great kindness. The spirits of heaven and earth and the myriad numina attend and guard morning and night. Practicing the Dao and preserving unity, one naturally attains the Dao. The Dao of filial piety is supreme, coeval with the formless, governing the Three Luminaries, illuminating the darkest nights. All living beings depend on it endlessly.

At that time, the Divine Youth bowed his head and asked the Heavenly Worthy: In the world below, many are unfortunate, losing their parents early—how may they express their filial devotion?

Thereupon the Heavenly Worthy replied: Revering heaven and complying with earth, paying homage to the Three Luminaries as one would to one’s parents—there is no difference. The attainment of the Dao will be swift, and all wishes will follow the heart.

Moreover, to comply with earth is to follow the royal qi. Pay homage to the Five Peaks, both great and small, and attend to convenience. Do not offend the Grand Year, but follow the four seasons. Cultivate the Dao of daily renewal, observing the eight solar terms. Seek life and repent of transgressions, keeping inner and outer purity. Bare one’s heart and expose one’s innermost feelings; the incense of the heart naturally perfumes. Wash away defilement and impurity, refining again and again, yet still fearing it is not refined enough; becoming true and ever more true, yet still fearing it is not true enough. Taking what is not true as true, seek our true Dao. Demonic beings will respond, but swiftly retreat in defeat.

Those who enter deviant paths, whose hun and po are scorched by heat, become deranged and confused. They devise their own methods, defiling the essentials of the Dao to seek personal gain. With corruption full and sins accumulated, their living bodies are examined, enduring all manner of suffering and affliction. Upon death, they enter hell, suffering through boiling cauldrons endlessly, with no hope of release. Even if they escape and are reborn, they fall into the six paths of beasts, never content. Or they are born lowly, blind, deaf, mute, or maimed, never seeing the Dao, never hearing the Dharma, cast out and enslaved by humans and beasts alike. Hunger, cold, hardship, and peril threaten their lives. Once the great Dao is lost, one sinks into evil destinies for kalpas beyond conception.

The Dao says: Those of virtue, whose filial devotion is lofty and far-reaching, in harmony with heaven and earth—heaven cannot kill them, and the Dao cannot be destroyed, so earth cannot bury them. Like frost on jade, they ultimately become golden treasures, indestructible. Ascending to heaven or entering earth, they encounter no obstacles.

In the past, there was one who did not recognize the great Dao, fearing death and clinging to life. Morning and night, with right mindfulness, he paid homage to a withered tree, seeking immortality, for forty years. The great Dao took pity on his unrelenting diligence and saved his Dao-qi. Thus the withered tree suddenly flourished. Overjoyed, the man redoubled his efforts, plucked and consumed its blossoms, and thereby attained the Dao.

Those who cultivate the Dao must never slacken. Accumulating merit and virtue, their hearts and conduct renew daily. Divine lamps, divine incense, divine light, and divine penetrations are the signs of the Dao. If their resolve does not waver, the Dao will descend to teach them the true essentials—this is certain.

The Dao says: In the world below, the vulgar see the subtle verifications of the Dao and seek to exploit it. They scheme to use others’ offerings for their own private gain. Struck by deviance, they will never attain the Dao. Stingy and unwilling to let go, they lose the Dao of compassion and kindness, lacking filial and obedient hearts. Practicing the Dao for profit increases their deceit and falsehood. The sin of deceit and falsehood is unforgivable by heaven and earth.

Those who study the Dao must not associate with such people. They should be rebuked, their faults and transgressions exposed. Cast them out and punish them; do not permit false repentance. If others in the Dao community receive their ill-gotten gains, use them to aid the poor and sick. Do not defile the wealth to cultivate divine merit.

The Dao says: When filial piety governs halls and chambers, adorn and maintain the pure abodes—let them not become dilapidated. Common men and women, base and foul-smelling, afflicted with sores and filth, ruined by wine and lust, consuming fish and meat, eating pungent and rank foods—forever sever ties with them. Do not draw near or associate with them, nor let them set foot in the fasting kitchens.

The Dao says: Furthermore, there are the ten evils and the five rebellions, including unfilial acts, secret malice, slander, and the destruction of good paths. Jealousy, arrogance, greed, lust, and drunkenness; fondness for fish and meat; hunting and killing; theft and banditry; following deviant paths; lacking kindness and filial piety; harboring unequal intentions; abandoning the poor to favor the rich; delighting in mockery and ridicule; engaging in strife and combat; collecting weapons; lacking forbearance; benefiting oneself at the expense of others—these are detested by the Dao of filial piety and feared by humans and beasts alike. They are unfit to hear the Dao. One must keep far away and not associate with them.

The Supreme Great Dao expounds these teachings and precepts to enlighten the sagely and filial rulers of later ages, that they may govern the world with filial piety, and to enable all filial children to repay the boundless kindness of their parents. These principles serve as models for families and states, bringing great peace to the world and unifying the eight directions. All shall follow the perfection of filial piety. Those who attain this Way shall recite and uphold it morning and evening, without distinction of male or female, noble or base, all shall be taught to study and recite it, in repayment of the profound and primal kindness of their two parents.

When this sutra is expounded, divine lamps appear in the heavens, illuminating all places with radiance. Heavenly bells and heavenly chimes resound, celestial hymns and celestial music arise, and drums sound of themselves in the void. Heavenly incense and heavenly flowers drift and turn upon the wind. In every household and state, all people shall make offerings to this sutra, contemplate its meaning, and practice its teachings, while also exhorting others to listen. Those who employ it should prepare fine paper and brushes, purify themselves with ablutions, burn incense, and copy it—whether a hundred or a thousand scrolls—circulating and making offerings to it without cease. With lamps and incense perpetually lit and hearts free from weariness, they shall surely attain the Dao, in ways beyond imagination.
