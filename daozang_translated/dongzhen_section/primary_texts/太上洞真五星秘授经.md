**The Supreme Cavern-Real Secret Transmission of the Five Stars Sutra**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, within the White Jade Capital of the Great Luo Heaven, in the Golden Palace’s Hall of Bearing Splendor, addressed the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic immortals on the names of the Three Origins, the Two Luminaries, the Five Stars, and the true lords of Rāhu, Ketu, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, saying:

“I observe that within the Four Seas and across the Nine Lands, from emperors, kings, and feudal lords down to the myriad creatures that fly and run, wherever the mountains and rivers’ destinies cast their influence, fortune and misfortune manifest, yet none can discern them in detail. Moreover, the people of the great earth commit many sins and rarely cultivate good causes. Thus, the Nine Provinces’ numinous officials and the Three Origins report their grave transgressions, diminishing their blessings and shortening their lives, hastening their descent to the netherworld, where they assume various forms and dwell forever among beasts. Now, I expound this true sutra so that the people of the Nine Lands may follow its precepts with reverence, obtain manifold blessings, and all attain longevity.”
