**The Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Salvation from the Blood Lake, Scroll One**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided in the Three Yuan Treasure Palace of the Ninefold Pure Wondrous Realm, beneath the *qian* wood grove of the Terrace of Effortless Transformation. Ascending the Seven Treasures’ Wondrous Throne, he was joined by the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Lords, the Heavenly Thearchs of the Ten Directions, the Flying Heavenly Kings of the Boundless Realms, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms and Five Directions, and the host of immortals of the Three Realms. All arrived together, riding eightfold radiant phoenix chariots, five-colored jade carriages, unicorn-drawn feathered steeds, phoenix-canopied dragon banners, traversing the void in flight, chanting sacred hymns, paying homage to the Heavenly Worthy, collectively reviewing the registers of destiny, and delivering beings from life and death.

At that moment, the Heavenly Thearchs, their consorts, jade maidens, and fragrant celestial maidens—all assembled—adorned their robes and crowns, advanced with graceful steps, burned incense, scattered flowers, bowed in reverence, and stood in solemn attendance, singing the hymns of immortals.

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the August Jade Emperor emitted boundless nine-colored auspicious light, illuminating all realms near and far. Within these rays, a hundred thousand myriad transformations manifested. The Three Pure Highest Lords and the Jade Emperor of Heaven all sat upon wondrous thrones of thousand-petaled auspicious lotuses adorned with a hundred treasures and nine dragons. Again, within the light, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriad transformations appeared.

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct arrayed themselves in ranks to attend the Most Venerable. Once more, the auspicious light descended to illuminate the boundless worlds of the ten directions, from the Round Net above to the Wind Springs below, within and beyond the Iron Enclosure. All became radiant and translucent, akin to the light of nine-colored lapis lazuli and crystal, so that the Three Realms were as one before their eyes.

At that time, the Great Perfected of Compassion and Salvation from Suffering, riding this auspicious light, ascended to the celestial palaces. Burning incense, scattering flowers, holding jade tablets, and kneeling in reverence, they addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Though your humble servants are unworthy to rank among the perfected immortals, our duty lies in deliverance. Suddenly, we beheld in the northeast a dense, black, noxious *qi*, surging upward to the celestial palaces, coiling and refusing to disperse. Its stench is foul and putrid, alarming the assembly. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what we have not heard, that we may comprehend the karmic roots from which this arises. Bestow the great medicinal Dharma, heal the drowned; sound the great Dharma’s thunder, awaken the ignorant; pour the great Dharma’s rain, cleanse body and mind; spread the great Dharma’s clouds, shelter all beings; kindle the great Dharma’s torch, illuminate the dark and obscure; open the great Dharma’s gate, guide all creatures step by step. Should you deign to show compassion, we would humbly receive your profound grace."

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, resting his hand upon the table, gazed into the azure void, refining his true nature. Collecting his thoughts in distant contemplation, he pitied all beings and broadly opened the gates of compassionate Dharma. He commanded the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and the Seeker of Sounds to Save from Suffering of the Eastern Ultimate Joyful World to open the Three Yuan’s secret treasury of cinnabar tablets and jade towers, revealing the *Great Practice’s Brahman Qi Three Yuan Golden Scripture*, the true writ of salvation, and the standards for deliverance and ascent. He instructed the spirit officials and talismanic clerks of the Azure Mystery, numbering in the billions, to descend to the dark paths, seek out voices, and rescue the souls of those ready for deliverance, guiding them to ascend to the celestial paradise.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy spoke again: "The scriptures of the Three Caverns and the treasured Brahman chants of the myriad heavens are inscribed in the void as seals, gathered *qi* as texts, pervading the empty vastness, weaving beyond the bounds of the mysterious and vacuous. They possess established canons, enduring through ancient and modern times. All things are born of me; all spirits are transformed by me. Yet, the beings of the lower realms, deluded in their own nature, suffer afflictions and calamities—I must save them. Thus, I shall once more expound the causes and conditions for all beings, who, from kalpa to kalpa, abandon their bodies and receive new forms. Those who receive bodies yet are neither loyal nor filial, neither benevolent nor righteous, neither compassionate nor respectful, neither yielding nor humble, arrogant and neglectful of the true and upright, disdainful of the Great Dao, slandering scriptures, defaming the virtuous, harming creatures, injuring life, insatiably greedy, entangled in the seven emotions and six desires, bound by the three karmas and ten fetters—cultivating the roots of sin, accumulating evil deeds—suffer the consequences of their own actions, as echo follows sound. Even if I were to expound through the kalpas, it would be difficult to exhaust their offenses. Let me briefly outline the essentials:

When a person receives life, they are endowed with the same *qi*. Yet upon birth, their fate is tied to the Three Yuan. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, the myriad karmic rewards and punishments, virtuous deeds and life or death—all follow the roots of their past lives, each bearing its retribution. According to their karmic power, it never deviates.

Among the beings of the lower realms—men and women—while in the world, some suffer the imposition of royal law, unjust violence, execution by blade or punishment, imprisonment in shackles, festering sores and toxic boils, oozing pus and blood, abandoned by others, unable to live yet unable to die, tormented by sorrow and vexation, with no means of liberation. Their karmic burden grows heavier, and they fall into the Blood Lake, forever without hope of escape, as their karmic retribution. All this arises from beings’ deluded attachments and cravings, their failure to recognize the true and upright, their clinging to right and wrong, their accumulation of sinful deeds, following the dictates of their hearts and minds. What is not a transgression? Unaware of the light of compassion, they have no means of awakening.

Moreover, endowed with the finest essence of the five phases, they are the most numinous of all creatures. To be born a man is a marvel that shakes heaven and earth, a rarity beyond measure. Yet, due to greed and lustful desires, they lose their original true nature. A single misguided thought, and they are reborn as women—embodied in the five turbidities, paired as husband and wife, the union of yin and yang conceiving pregnancy. Debtors and creditors, they repay one another in turn. Thus, childbirth entails myriad hardships and calamities. Some, during menstruation, wash soiled clothes; others, in bearing children, stain the earth spirits with blood. Filthy water is poured into streams, rivers, ponds, and wells. Unaware, people draw and drink this water, offer it to the gods, and offend the Three Luminaries."

Some, in error, consume poisonous drugs, harming their children and inducing miscarriage; others, burdened by many sons and daughters, deliberately drown their infants. Vengeance and retribution unfold, demonic forces assail them. Some children perish in the womb, mothers die in childbirth, or both mother and child succumb, their lives tragically cut short. Some face execution, unable to escape the blade; others fall prey to malevolent spirits, meeting violent, untimely deaths. They descend into the Fengdu Blood Lake Hell, enduring every torment. For the lake is formed from accumulated blood, and the prison arises from illusory karma.

If you, with your vast vow, seek to deliver them from this suffering, I shall expound the True and Non-Dual Dharma Gate to rescue them from their tribulations.

The esoteric incantations of the Three Caverns’ Great Dharma, the Celestial Salvation, and the Hidden Qi of Brahma:

Observe the profound and tattered, the Great Radiance of the Purple Spirit.
Nine deities deliver souls, opening the Jade Truth of creation.
Ah, resplendent and luminous, the flying heavens’ flowing sound.
The Wheel of Light, the Eternal Emperor, the Capital of Spirits attains perfection.
Vast and boundless, auspicious clouds awaken the numinous.
The Seven Luminaries shine upon demons, serenity and harmony spread glory.
The Void’s supreme origin, the celestial order extends to the imperial throne.
The Four Exhalations nurture forms, washing and illuminating the soaring essence.
Brilliant and blazing, the cavernous yang, the floating light of the Jade Hall.
The Seven Spirits’ hymns and songs, the Purple Hall of the World’s Origin.
The net of heroes scatters light, illuminating the Jade Chamber.
The Eight Sceneries gather beasts, the Shao Qi captures essence.
The Nine Capitals soar in splendor, flying life ascends to the highest spirits.
The tranquil realm of the Starry Net, the fragrant nurturing of the empty wheel.
Irrigating the Yellow Flower, the profound and luminous revolves.
The divine should expand and open, extending and ascending to the court.
The great plan floats in light, the true stability transforms the origin.
Graceful and subtle, the Jade Beam clears the mist.
Towering and serene in the corner, the net of light entwines the Seven Coils.
The Jade Treasury flourishes, its radiance flowing through the Nine Mysteries.
Silent and distant, flying blossoms brush the canopy.
Dawn’s overflow records the register, the Great Desert follows its course.
Ah, the Nine Crossings of the Hill, the Six Dragons dance the chariot’s pole.
Lush and misty, the floating net, the purple essence fragrant in the abyss.
The vast primordial nurtures, the Nine Mechanisms transform the heavens.
Covering forms with profound virtue, the primordial river sinks into essence.
Nurturing the radiant Mingtuo, the dawn’s subtle clouds.
The great peak oversees all, the flourishing joy of the forbidden heavens.
The Purple Void stands in Tuo, the kalpas’ measures intersect.
The azure haze diminishes the Brahma, subtly wandering the origin.
The Six Transformations revolve in measure, severing evil transgressions.
The vast crown of the mysterious desert, myriad kalpas achieve immortality.

At this time, the Great Saints of the Heavens, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the innumerable true lords of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, gathered beneath the seat of the Primordial Beginning, heard the Dharma sound, awakened to their true nature, and each paid reverence, accepting and vowing to uphold it.

Thus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on Deliverance from the Blood Lake*.

The *Middle Scroll of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on Deliverance from the Blood Lake*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy sat suspended upon a five-colored lion throne floating in the void, attended by jade lads and jade maidens, and myriad celestial perfected beings arrayed in attendance. He addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying:

In the northeast, the region of Ren and Gui, lies the vast and boundless wilderness of the Dark Sea, its waters putrid and foul, immeasurable in depth. Within it stands a great mountain, its summit piercing the azure heavens, its base descending into the windy springs, named the Fengdu Luoshan of the Northern Yin. Spanning ten thousand *li* in circumference, it governs the host of yin qi and serves as the pivot of the Nine Earths. Its many prisons mete out punishment for the sins of humankind, as well as for the flying birds, running beasts, creatures born of womb, egg, moisture, or transformation—those with scales, shells, feathers, or fur—all are subject to its jurisdiction.

Within it lies a prison at the bottom of the Northern Yin’s great sea, called the Blood Lake. Surrounded by iron walls of varying size, its depths are boundless and frigid. This hell is further divided into four subsidiary prisons: the Blood Pool, the Blood Basin, the Blood Mountain, and the Blood Sea. These four prisons are interconnected, each governed by a deity known as the Great God of the Blood Lake, dwelling in the bottomless waters. The water flows above, its stench rising to the heavens.

All women who die in childbirth, their bodies drenched in blood, are in truth ancient mothers and children locked in enmity, their karmic debts entangling and harming one another, now repaid in full in this life. Silently, in the depths of the dark night, they wail in the blackness below, their bodies drenched in filthy blood, the stench reaching the heavens. Iron hammers and rods rain down ceaselessly; they hunger for ravenous flames and thirst for the blood of the pool. Dying and reviving ten thousand times, unceasing day and night, they dwell in eternal darkness, never beholding the light. Though they may encounter talismans or meritorious deeds that slightly reduce their sins, they cannot escape. Even if they do, they are reborn as other beings, and unless their children possess divine power, they cannot be delivered.

In the Eastern Land of Eternal Joy, there resides the Great Compassionate One, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through the Great One. In the beginning of the kalpa, he made a vast vow, manifesting as many bodies as the sands of the Ganges, responding to beings according to their cries. In heaven, he is called the Blessed Spirit of the Great One; in the world, the Great Compassionate One; in hell, the Radiant Emperor of the Sun; among heretics, the Lion King of Light; in the watery realms, the Emperor of the Abyssal Cavern. You are my qi, I am your root—you know me, I know you.

This is the essence of the Nine Yangs, most numinous, most numinous. Sometimes he dwells in the heavenly palaces, sometimes descends to the human realm, sometimes resides in hell, sometimes subdues demonic hordes, sometimes appears as jade lads and maidens, sometimes as emperors and sages, sometimes as Heavenly Worthies and Daoist masters, sometimes as the Yellow Emperor and the Old Lord, sometimes as celestial physicians and merit officials. His divine powers are boundless, his meritorious deeds inexhaustible. He responds to cries for help, adapting to all circumstances.

You may all raise your voices and chant the name of the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through the Great One, so that the celestial officials may join in unison. Naturally, he will manifest in response.

Thereupon, the Perfected and Immortals all chanted in unison the name of the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through the Great One. They beheld the Heavenly Worthy riding upon five-colored auspicious clouds, mounted on a nine-headed lion, radiating a hundred treasures’ luminous glow, floating through the void to the assembly of the Primordial Beginning. He bowed in reverence, received the precepts, and pledged to uphold them.

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke: I observe that among the women of the Desire Realm, those who commit various sins and karmic offenses fall into the Blood Lake, suffering and sinking without end, their torment spanning countless kalpas, with no hope of escape.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy now unseals the sacred scripture repository, revealing the golden register of amnesty. You shall bear it to the lower realms, proclaiming it throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, and the Nine Dark Hells of the Blood Lake. By this decree, deliver the sinful souls, that they may depart the eternal night and behold the light of dawn.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through the Great One, vast in compassion and mercy, universally saves and delivers all. Present were the Merciful and Compassionate Savior Perfected, the Greatly Compassionate and Benevolent Perfected, the Eighty-One Spirits of the Great One, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mightiest Warriors, the Green Mystery Merit Officers, the Yellow-Threaded Lads, and the Jade Maidens and Divine Kings, all escorting the divine carriage. The Heavenly Worthy radiated a hundred million auspicious lights, holding in his left hand a lapis lazuli treasure vase and in his right a feathered branch of azure malachite. Mounted upon a nine-headed lion seated upon a golden lotus with jade leaves, he soared through the void. He commanded the Nine Phoenixes Breaking Impurity Great Spirits, the Washing and Purifying Great Spirits, the Severing Ingratitude Great Spirits, the Upright Essence Fire-Eyed Great Spirits, the Thunderous Drum-Eyed Great Spirits, the Whole Form Restoring Great Spirits, and the Resolving Grievances and Releasing Oppositions Great Spirits to cleanse the Blood Lake, break through defilements, and proclaim the Primordial Beginning’s decree of amnesty. By the Primordial August One’s gracious pardon, the sinful souls of those who died in childbirth were delivered, ascending at once.

At that time, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu and all ghostly officials, Ox-Head jailers, Mighty Constellation Spirit Kings, great demons of the Three Realms, nine hundred million ghost kings, and the Blood Lake’s great spirits all obeyed the edict, delivering the sinful souls. The Black Registers of the Nine Dark Hells were burned to ashes in an instant, the Blood Lake purified and transformed into a treasure pond. Golden hammers and iron staves became lotus blossoms, and the consumption of blood and filth turned into sweet dew.

All sinful souls, awakening to their original true nature, rode the light to transcendence and were reborn in heaven. The dark officials of hell all generated good intentions, together riding the power of compassion to realize the Dao and attain perfection.

Then they offered this hymn of praise:
We bow to the boundless, supreme Dao,
Great Compassionate Savior, Lord of Mercy.
A hundred million divine lights illumine the midst of darkness,
Pervasive compassionate clouds showering the Dharma rain.
The pitch-black, icy Avīci Hell of the Gorge,
The Blood Lake, Blood Sea, and Blood Pool Basin—
By the jade register’s great amnesty, all sinful souls
Are liberated from ten thousand kalpas of sinking suffering.
Refining form and delivering life, they leave the prison of death,
Awakening to the Dao and ascending to perfection through the gates of myriad wonders.
Vast and towering, your merit defies thought,
Forever serving as the compassionate father to all beings.

At that time, the merciful and compassionate Perfected Ones, following the sacred words, proclaimed the decree, illuminating the eternal night and delivering those on the dark paths. All who bathed in this compassionate grace together transcended to the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

*Thus concludes the Middle Scroll of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s True Scripture for Delivering the Blood Lake.*

*The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s True Scripture for Delivering the Blood Lake, Final Scroll*

Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembled Perfected Ones of wondrous practice: The sentient beings of the lower realms, with their five turbid physical forms, do not recognize the causes and conditions of sin and blessing. Clinging to lust and desire, some take female form, bearing sons and daughters, only to suffer calamities, contract strange illnesses, or die prematurely. They revolve endlessly in the wheel of rebirth, unaware of their plight.

I now tell all beings: If you can generate a good heart, revere the Three Treasures, refrain from killing or harming, from envy or jealousy, from lust or theft, from greed or desire, from hatred or deceit, and uphold the precepts with a serene mind—if you can maintain the merit of this scripture—then the Ten Heavenly Good Spirits, the Dharma-Protecting Spirit Kings, the Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Holy Mothers, the Birth-Monitoring Great Spirits, and countless Heavenly Perfected Ones and Great Sages will all come to guard and protect you.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things. They embrace yin and carry yang, in a state of constant flux. Within it is something. Within it is something—its name does not depart. Though the myriad things return to it, it never becomes great. Look for it, and it cannot be seen; listen for it, and it cannot be heard; use it, and it cannot be exhausted.

All who hear this scripture should each contemplate the Dao and observe the mind, cultivating inner peace and silent awakening.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through the Great One, the Heavenly Thearchs, and the merciful and compassionate Perfected Ones, bearing the radiant majesty of the Primordial Beginning, proclaimed the Three Primes’ decrees, universally announcing them to the Northern Yin World, the eternal night of the Nine Dark Hells, the Avīci of the Gorge, the Blood Lake, and all great hells, delivering and transcending all beings.

The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the assembled Perfected Ones: What I now expound is the *True Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Ascending Mystery for Delivering the Blood Lake*. Formerly, it was hidden in the Three Heavens’ Mysterious Treasury of the Purple Tenuity Palace, sealed by a covenant of the Perfected with prohibitions, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, as the kalpic destiny draws to a close, the great Dharma should manifest. It may now be transmitted to the human realm, circulated and recited. If men and women can cultivate it according to the method, they will benefit both humans and heavens, gaining immeasurable blessings.

Then he again proclaimed the Three Primes’ secret Brahma-heaven treasure scripture:
One qi completes the Perfected,
The Two Modes revolve in emptiness.
The Five Spirits continue the severed,
The Seven Luminaries support the declining.
Turning the net, treading the void,
Flying steps through the cloud palaces.
Embryos have a beginning,
But kalpas are without end.
The golden city nurtures essence,
The jade grotto congeals spirit.
The true qi is inwardly cultivated,
To complete the Perfected One.
Above, it enters the Great Void;
Below, it communicates with the dark springs.
Within the cloud palace’s treasure chamber,
There is the true soul.
It enters and leaves the land of blessings,
Revolving through the gates of life.
Chewing numinous mushrooms,
Rinsing with golden springs.
Sweet dew flows like rivers,
Pouring into the cinnabar field.
Purple auroras dawn and reflect,
The Three Qi condense into mist.
The jade chamber transforms into immortals,
Seated securely upon golden lotuses.
The true countenance obscures the sun,
Dust kalpas become years.
The dust kalpas become years.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the assembled Perfected Ones: How long is a human life? It arises and perishes easily, like a spark from stone, unable to endure. Like a floating bubble, how can it be firm? Birth, aging, illness, and death assail us day and night. Change and decay are constant; in an instant, all disperses and breaks apart. If you can forget the eyes, then light overflows without limit. If you can still the ears, then the mind’s awareness remains profound. When both senses are forgotten, pure and complete, you merge with the great square, vast and boundless, uniting with the measureless. What I uphold endures as long as heaven and earth.

Then, upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy expound the bridge of deliverance for humankind—its merit and virtue beyond all conception—the assembled Perfected Ones each bowed their heads in reverence, giving thanks, and with faith received and vowed to practice.

Thus concludes the *True Sutra of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy for Salvation from the Blood Lake*, Scroll the Lower. #1 "同" should read "日".
