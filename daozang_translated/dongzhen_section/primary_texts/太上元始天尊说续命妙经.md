**The Marvelous Scripture of Life-Prolonging Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: "The sentient beings of the Three Realms drift in the sea of suffering, with no liberation. How can you bear this? You must diligently uphold and practice my Dharma, universally saving and delivering them."

The Most High Dao Lord, having received the command, dared not conceal his true intent. If there are sentient beings in peril or afflicted by illness, they should recite this scripture and invoke the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Perfected One, and the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering. Thereby, they shall escape suffering, attain lasting liberation, forever break free from karmic entanglements, prolong life, renew their aged years, and all calamities and hardships shall be extinguished.

The Most High Dao Lord proclaimed a hymn, saying:

The Two Perfected Ones of Great Compassion,
Can save the suffering of the Three Realms.
Radiating light to illuminate the world,
Hell’s torments all cease.

Knife-mountains rise towering,
Cauldron-waters boil fiercely.
With sincere mind, invoke the Perfected Ones,
Sinful souls resolve past grievances.

Illness and hardship bring many woes,
Beyond words of disaster and distress.
Alas! The Five Spirits are harmed,
The Perfected Ones pity their bitter pain.

Devout faithful men and women,
Must wholeheartedly surrender.
Constantly invoke the Two Perfected Ones,
To escape suffering and avoid sinking sorrow.

Illness and calamities dispelled,
Evil demons dare not encroach.
Day and night, the mind unwavering,
Liberation secures your entire being.

With courage, dedicate the merit,
Together return to the Forest of Seven Treasures.

**Thus concludes the *Marvelous Scripture of Life-Prolonging Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*.**
