**Volume One: The Chapter of Divine Prowess in the Qingwei Celestial Palace**

At that time, Yuan Shi Tianzun sat upon the Radiant Seat in the Qingwei Celestial Palace, within the Seven-Treasured Mysterious Gardens of the Jade Emperor’s Golden Threshold in the Jade Capital of the Uppermost Realm. There, He expounded the *Lingbao* doctrine of Pure, Immaculate, True, and Undivided Dao to countless assemblies of the *Wu Yang* multitudes.

The Jade Emperor, in His august presence, stood with the myriad True Saints, the Flying Celestial Saints, the Gods of the Boundless, and the Nine Thousand Myriads of Spirit Boys and Jade Girls. They observed strict fasting and ceremonial rites, attending at His side.

When the time drew near, the Jade Emperor manifested His Six Transcendent Powers, emitting boundless radiance that illuminated all the heavens and the Boundless Brahman abodes—every realm trembled in response. The ten directions of the Boundless worlds became as transparent as crystal and glass, with no obstruction between them. The assemblies from all directions arrived, riding five-colored jade wheels, lingyus, and emerald palanquins, nine-hued dark dragons, and ten-perfect feathered canopies. The phoenixes danced, the dragons sang, their melodious cries resounded, while Spirit Consorts scattered flowers and Golden Boys wafted incense. They chanted sacred hymns, floating through the air to the assembly.

At that moment, the Celestial Brahmans and all the Golden Immortals, the Great Vehicle Bodhisattvas, and the Four Assemblies of the Eight Departments—bathed in this radiance—rode upon golden clouds, nine-hued misty carriages, and jade palanquins, circling in the four celestial gatherings. The Three Celestial Luminaries exhaled fragrance, and the Eight Harmonious Melodies played as they revolved before the Dao. A shower of wondrous flowers descended like clouds, covering the entire assembly.

This radiance illuminated all the heavens and the lower Boundless worlds, merging with the Pure Capital’s domain. Even the mortal realm, reaching up to the Nine Heavens, became intimately connected. The lower Boundless worlds—mountains, ridges, valleys, and ravines—lay flat as the palm, with the six directions now near and the three realms no longer distant.

The Celestial Treasures Platforms dotted the mortal world, their jade and rare gems arrayed in splendor, shining along the cloudy thoroughfares. Seven-Treasured railings marked the paths, and jade trees with resplendent fruits and flowers flourished in the Vermilion Fields, their luster surpassing all.

At that time, even the lower realms beheld the heavens. The divine music of the Pin Heaven resounded spontaneously, its vibrations filling the air. They also heard the cranes’ cries and the phoenixes’ songs, their harmonious calls in perfect rhythm, while dragons danced and unicorns coiled in aerial grace. The celestial treasure flowers scattered across the paths, filling every road.

Then, both mortals and immortals were astonished, their darkness dispelled by light. Celestial beings and humans rejoiced, leaping in delight. Even the common scholars ascended, gazing upward at the towering treasure platforms and downward at the vast purple clouds.

All the peoples of these worlds attained the Dao’s *qi*, their aged faces wrinkled and graying transformed into youthful radiance—blue-black hair turned crimson, their forms renewed in beauty. Their suffering vanished, and they were universally liberated, dwelling in perfect bliss. Across the land, songs of joy celebrated the Great Peace.

At that moment, the divine winds blew far and wide, the ten thousand *qi* surged, the earth trembled and split, and even the bones of the dead regenerated. Sunken corpses and wandering spirits rose anew. The Iron Enclosure of the Underworld and the Nine Dark Nights of eternal night were instantly shattered. The tormented souls of hell were reborn in the heavens, and the sufferings of the Three Evil Paths were all relieved.

At that time, even the guilty were, by this radiance’s power, born into the great celestial palaces of the ten directions.

The Jade Emperor then divided His body, manifesting in each of the ten-directional great celestial palaces. There, the palaces naturally transformed—white jade became the capital, yellow gold the threshold, and the Seven-Treasures Mysterious Gardens housed the Great Radiant Hall with its Radiant Seat. Banners, flags, and canopies of rare treasures and wondrous flowers adorned the place.

The Jade Emperor, through His divided forms, sat upon the Radiant Seat within the Golden Threshold of the White Jade Capital, the Seven-Treasures Mysterious Gardens, and the Great Radiant Hall. There, He universally expounded the Dao of Pure Liberation to the ten directions.

The transformed Jade Emperors, each attended by countless Heavenly True Saints, Marvelous Conduct Immortals, and Spirit Consorts and Jade Girls, stood at their sides. These Jade Girls possessed exquisite, peerless beauty, their features adorned with celestial rarities and treasures. Their voices were clear and melodious, delighting all who heard.

Moreover, their bodies emitted a subtle, natural fragrance of liberation. This scent permeated the Boundless lands of the heavens and all the fortunate places of the great earth. All beings of the Six Paths who smelled it were universally enlightened—whether the Path of Heaven, the Path of Humans, the Path of Demons, the Path of Hell, the Path of Hungry Ghosts, or the Path of Beasts.

For those on the Path of Heaven, all celestial beings who heard this fragrance saw their Five Decays and Four Marks vanish, their heavenly blessings eternally increased.

For those on the Path of Humans, kings, ministers, and commoners who heard it attained the joys of human and celestial longevity. If their bodies perished, they achieved the *tuoké* liberation of the empty shell.

For those on the Path of Demons, all demons who heard it found rest in celestial palaces, free from the sufferings of war.

For those on the Path of Hell, all beings who heard it escaped the torments of hell and attained the bliss of Pure Lands.

For those on the Path of Hungry Ghosts, all hungry ghosts who heard it were sated, their hunger and thirst no longer tormenting them.

For those on the **Path of Beasts**, all beasts who heard this fragrance escaped the sufferings of animal existence and attained the joy of wisdom.

At that time, all the sinful beings born in heaven, having already been reborn in this supreme celestial palace, through the grace of the compassionate light’s guidance, awakened and clearly understood the causes and effects of sin and virtue. They performed celestial arts with their retinues before the Emperor and paid homage.

These beings, filled with sorrow, spoke in unison: *"For countless kalpas and myriads of kalpas, we saw no sun, moon, or stars, dwelling always in darkness within the Three Evil Paths, enduring endless torment. By the Emperor’s compassionate light, we were rescued and born into heaven. Our evil deeds are now all extinguished, with no more bonds—we have attained rebirth."*

They then knelt and bowed before the Jade Emperor, arriving at the Dao field. After speaking thus, they prostrated themselves and returned to their seats.

The Jade Emperor then emitted a wondrous voice, addressing all the sacred assemblies of the ten directions: *"Hear me well! These sinful beings, for eons without wisdom, committed the Ten Evils, defiled by the Six Dusts, entangled by the Three Karmas, indulging their hearts without awakening. Their hidden and manifest sins accumulated day by day, abandoning the Dao and betraying truth, following evil and rejecting righteousness. Every thought and intention bound them further. Thus, after death, they fell into the Three Realms, unable to escape. Had they not encountered this Dharma feast today, how could they have liberated themselves?"*

At that moment, the Jade Emperor’s transformation body, without moving from his place, used divine power to transport all the heavenly and human beings to the Pure and Refined Heavenly Palace of the Jade Purity Sacred Realm beneath the Primordial Assembly. These beings were unaware of the journey.

When the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly saw the ten-directional Jade Emperors’ transformation bodies gather before the Heavenly Worthy’s assembly, they shone like boundless mirrors reflecting countless forms, merging seamlessly. The great assembly then bowed in reverence.

The Jade Emperor’s transformation body, most exalted among the saints, grew in pure faith and joy, his resolve unshaken, his heart unyielding. The heavenly and human beings, newly born in heaven, suddenly beheld the Heavenly Worthy in this supreme Dao field, adorned with the merit of non-action, pure and first among all. Overwhelmed with joy, they prostrated themselves in homage, exclaiming in wonder.

The ten-directional transformation Jade Emperors then merged into one body, rose from their seats, and knelt northward.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: *"In a past age, there was a kingdom named Light-Strong and Wondrous-Joy. Its king was named Pure Virtue. The king had a queen named Treasure-Moonlight. Since the king had no heir, one day he pondered: ‘I am aging, yet have no prince. When I die, who will inherit the throne and temples?’ After this thought, he issued an edict to all Daoist assemblies in the palaces, following the rites, hanging banners, and making offerings in purity. For half a year, he never wavered in his devotion.

One night, Queen Treasure-Moonlight dreamed of the Most High Dao Lord and the Perfect Ones, their forms golden and jade-like, pure and refined, riding a five-colored dragon carriage, surrounded by radiant banners and canopies of misty clouds. The Most High Dao Lord sat in the carriage, holding an infant whose pores emitted a hundred billion lights, illuminating the palaces in a hundred treasures’ hues. The banners and flags led the way as they floated through the air. The queen, overjoyed, knelt in reverence before the Dao Lord and said: ‘The king has no heir. I beg you to grant this child as the future ruler. Please have mercy and grant my wish.’

The Dao Lord replied: ‘I grant this to you.’ The queen then thanked the Dao Lord and took the child. Upon waking, she found herself with child.

After a year, in the first month of the *bingwu* year, at noon on the ninth day, she gave birth in the royal palace. At birth, the child’s body radiated treasure-light, filling the kingdom with splendor, his form exquisite and never-ending in beauty. As a child, he was quick and wise; as he grew, he was kind and benevolent. He distributed all the kingdom’s treasures—gold, jewels, and wealth—to the poor, the widowed, the orphaned, the homeless, the hungry, and the sick, his kindness and humility earning songs of praise. His influence reached distant lands, and all under heaven followed him, calling him the Prince of Virtue. The king rejoiced.

After this, the king suddenly passed away, and the prince ruled in his place. Moved by the transient nature of life, he instructed the ministers in righteous governance, then abandoned the throne and retired to the Fragrant and Pure Mountain to cultivate the Dao, achieving transcendence through merit.

After this kalpa, over eight hundred kalpas passed, and he repeatedly abandoned his kingdom for the sake of all beings, severing attachments to learn the Dao.

In the following eight hundred kalpas, he practiced medicine to heal the sick, rescuing beings and bringing them peace.

After another eight hundred kalpas, he widely employed expedient means, expounding the Daoist canon, reciting sacred verses, and spreading true teachings to aid the nation and save people—from the hidden to the manifest.

Following this, in another eight hundred kalpas, he sacrificed his body and life through endurance, offering his flesh and blood.

Thus, over three thousand two hundred kalpas of such practice, he finally attained the Golden Immortal rank, named the Pure and Natural Awakened King Asura, who taught the Bodhisattvas the sudden insight into the Great Vehicle’s true essence and gradually entered the wondrous Dao of Emptiness.

After another hundred million kalpas of cultivation, he attained the rank of Jade Emperor."*

After this discourse, the assembly of the Dao/Way was hushed, and all voices in unison sighed in wonder, exclaiming that such a thing had never been heard before.

At that moment, among the gathering, there arose a jade maiden named Yèguāng (夜光, "Moonlight"). She rose from her seat, adjusted her attire with solemn grace, and moved with composed elegance. Kneeling deeply before the Dao/Way, she addressed the Heavenly Venerable (天尊) thus: *"Your humble servant has been most fortunate to serve in Your presence, offering reverent devotion and countless kalpas of worship. The Three Pure Ones’ realm, with its golden palaces and jade capitals, is serene and unbounded—a place of boundless joy and ease where I wander among sacred domains, feasting on the sounds of the Dao/Way. Yet even here, I have never witnessed such a rare and wondrous sight as this.

I do not understand how, within the luminous interior of the past, the ten directions of all celestial realms (十方诸天) displayed their holy transformations—each with the Jade Emperor’s (玉帝) manifested dharmakāya (法身), the Heavenly True Saint (天真大圣), the Marvelous Conduct Immortal (妙行真人), and the Spirit Consort Jade Maidens (灵妃玉女) as attendants. These jade maidens possessed noble and refined features, exquisite forms, and emitted divine fragrances unmatched by any other.

Yet by the Jade Emperor’s divine powers (神通), they were summoned here, all now gathered in the Pure and Microcosmic Heaven (清微天). I do not know by what cause and condition this jade maiden has attained such a supreme and radiant form (色身). It is only by Your boundless compassion (圣慈) that she may now understand."*

Then the Heavenly Venerable (天尊) replied to the Moonlight Jade Maiden (夜光玉女): *"You have indeed just entered the sacred stream of the Dao/Way. Though you possess wisdom, you have yet to fully comprehend its depths.

These jade maidens, from countless kalpas past, cultivated marvelous practices (妙行), mastered the gates of liberation (解脱门), and shared in the Pure and Natural faith (清净自然), the Pure and Natural understanding (清净自然), the Pure and Natural mindfulness (清净念), the Pure and Natural conduct (清净行), the Pure and Natural body (清净身), the Pure and Natural heart (清净心), the Pure and Natural intention (清净意), and the Pure and Natural fruits and retributions (清净果、清净报). They also shared in the Great Compassion (大慈心) and Great Mercy (大悲心), sheltering beings as a mother cherishes her child, loving them as her own. With unwavering dedication to the precepts (奉戒专一), their minds illuminated by the Great Dao/Way (冥心大道), they observed strict fasting (清斋) and took grand vows (弘誓) for countless kalpas, reverently serving the Jade Emperor (玉帝).

These jade maidens are not truly maidens—they are the Heavenly Essence of Truth (天至真), appearing in the form of jade maidens solely to guide all beings. Thus, their radiant forms (身色), divine powers (神通), and wisdom (智慧) manifest in hidden and revealed transformations, all in harmony with the Emperor’s.

When the Moonlight Jade Maiden (夜光) heard these words, her heart opened in enlightenment. She bowed her head in joy, then silently returned to her seat.

At that moment, the Sovereign of the High Void and Pure Clarity Heaven (高虚清明天主), along with the celestial retinue (眷属), rode in the Eight Auspicious Celestial Chariot (八景鸾舆) beneath the Nine Radiant Jewel Canopy (九光宝盖). They played celestial hymns of profound harmony (玄歌妙乐), recited the limitless sacred verses (无量洞章), scattered the Heavenly Treasure Flowers (天宝花), and sprayed the Heavenly True Fragrance (天真香). With steps suspended in the void, they approached the Dao/Way’s assembly.

By the Jade Emperor’s (玉帝) mighty virtue and power (威神之力), these Heavenly Treasure Flowers instantly formed a canopy in the air, sheltering all the gathered beings without exception. At that moment, the Sovereign of the High Void and Pure Clarity Heaven, seeing this rare wonder, knelt and bowed deeply, addressing the Heavenly Venerable Jade Emperor (天尊玉帝): *"Your lowly servant was negligent and missed the earlier assembly. Today’s joyous occasion, this radiant bridge of the Dao/Way, spans the hidden and the manifest, the sacred and the mundane, and all beings partake in Your sacred blessings (圣泽). Your boundless light (大光明) shines forth in wondrous forms (希有相), illuminating the heavens above and the realms of the Four Celestial Kings (四梵) and the Six Desires (六欲) in all directions. The holy and true assemblies (真圣众) behold this light and converge in response, while below, the boundless worlds of the lower realms (下方无极世界) align with the Mysterious Capital (玄都境), drawing near to the Nine Heavens (九天). The spiritual winds play celestial melodies (灵风奏乐), the tones of the cosmos resonate in harmony (宫商相和), and the clouds echo with profound hymns (激朗云庭), all forming limitless sacred verses (洞章).

All beings, great and small, attain the Dao/Way’s transformation (道化). Even the tormented souls of the Iron Enclosure of the Netherworld (酆都铁围), the Nine Abysses of Eternal Night (长夜九幽), and all suffering beings in the various hells (一切地狱), by the power of this light (光力), are reborn in the heavens (诸天) and granted boundless joy (快乐).

The Heavenly Treasure Flowers (天宝奇花) scattered today have swiftly formed this canopy, sheltering all beings beneath its radiance. Your virtue and power (威神之力) are such that Your humble servants have accumulated merit over a thousand kalpas (千劫良因), the Nine Heavens (九天) have gathered in auspicious alignment (运会), and the august Dao/Way flourishes in its vastness (皇道荡荡), with the true teachings (正法) thriving. Today is a great day of fortune—all bow in reverence to Your sublime powers (玄功)."*

Then the Sovereign of the High Void and Pure Clarity Heaven (高虚清明天主) chanted a gāthā in praise of the Jade Emperor (玉帝):

*"O Sovereign of the Golden Palace and Mysterious Vault,
The Highest Jade Emperor, Your marvelous form surpasses all the heavens,
Your compassionate radiance illuminates the Three Realms.
You are the True Saint, the Master of the Marvelous Dao/Way,
The support of both celestial beings and humans.
With the Great Vehicle’s teachings, You guide the lost,
Pointing toward the One True Essence.
Your virtues and powers are as boundless as the void,
Praise for You knows no end.

You are the Sovereign of the boundless cosmos,
The Venerable of the vast kalpas,
With profound insight and wisdom,
Unmatched and peerless.
In serene stillness and true tranquility,
Vanishing yet ever-present,
The highest of saints and spirits,
Possessing great divine powers,
The luminous treasury of the Dao/Way,
The Great Hero,
You open the path for all humanity and celestial beings,
Teach the Dao/Way without end,
With great compassion and mercy,
Your dharma-wheel shines forth,
Guiding all beings—
Thus You are named the Jade Emperor.

The True Elder of the boundless cosmos,
In perfect roundness and purity,
With wisdom and eloquence,
The highest of the Dao/Way’s sovereigns,
You liberate all beings—
Thus You manifest this light."*

When the Sovereign of the High Void and Pure Clarity Heaven (高虚清明天主) finished chanting his gāthā in praise, the Heavenly Venerable (天尊) proclaimed to the Four Assemblies (四众):

*"The Emperor’s body is the Dao/Way’s body, not an ordinary form (非常体). It is the body of boundless virtues and powers (无量功德之身), the Pure and Natural body (清净自然之身), the unshakable, divine, and luminous true void’s supreme dharmakāya (神明坚固不坏真空无上法身). His virtue and power are vast and encompassing (威灵恢廓), his fame resounding throughout the cosmos (名声周徧). There is no hidden realm He cannot illuminate (无幽不开), and His divine marvels are resplendent (神奇堂堂). Such a being is beyond measure.

The Emperor’s virtues and powers are not attained through worldly deeds (有为功德). Though in the past He descended into the human world for countless kalpas, demonstrating great divine powers (神通) while maintaining a Pure and Natural body (身清净), He never ceased to reside in the Golden Palace (金阙). Through His limitless transformations (分身变化), He manifested in response to all beings, benefiting them and guiding them toward the Dao/Way’s shore (超升道岸). He universally bestowed His teachings (普垂教法), awakening future generations, leading them to follow and attain true enlightenment (登真成道).

By the might of these virtues, His light perpetually fills the heavens (光明常充诸天), and His divine wisdom reaches beyond all measure (神智妙达). This radiant body (身光明) bears wondrous names: the Great Divine Power Light (大神通光), the Great Compassion and Mercy Light (大慈悲光), the Great Joyous Renunciation Light (大喜舍光), the Great Endurance Light (大忍辱光), the Great Equality Light (大平等光), the Great Gentle Harmony Light (大柔和光), the Great Freedom Light (大自在光), the Great Beneficial Light (大利益光), the Great As-You-Wish Light (大如意光), the Great Wisdom Light (大智慧光), the Great Auspicious Light (大吉祥光), the Great Liberation Light (大解脱光), the Great Refuge Light (大归依光), the Great Virtue and Power Light (大功德光), the Great Perfect Light (大圆满光), the Great Unobstructed Light (大无碍光), and the Unsurpassable Light (无能胜光)."*

Thus, you who wish to behold this Sovereign—yet cannot—do so because your bodies and speech remain bound to defilements, clinging to habitual patterns and afflictive deeds. By this obstruction, you fail to glimpse His merciful countenance.

Now, before this gathered assembly, I proclaim the method to sever these barriers. All of you must diligently practice it.

At these words, the great assembly rejoiced beyond measure, each prostrating before the Most Exalted Throne, bowing in reverence, all eager to hear.

The Celestial Sovereign spoke:

*"The method to sever barriers is this: cultivate boundless compassion, harbor no doubt or confusion, no greed or wrath, no lust, no jealousy or malice, no killing or harm, no mundane emotions, no mundane thoughts, no dullness or filth, no attachment to sounds and forms, no clinging to right or wrong, no aversion or fondness, no discrimination, no arrogance, no fixation.

Concentrate your spirit, purify your thoughts—subdue all spirits, let your heart be as boundless void. Within and without, pure and untainted, containing all yet accepting all. Do not allow external evils to disrupt your Dao, to drag you from the True Path, to corrupt your sacred root, to steal your supreme treasure, lest you fall into the mundane realm for countless kalpas, ensnared in the net of the vulgar, assailed by myriad demons, condemned by ghosts and spirits, cycling endlessly through birth and death.

Therefore, you must wholeheartedly resolve to safeguard the True Path, lest it be lost. As previously stated, all these barriers must be severed by you—thus your body attains purity, transcending all hardships.

This is the Dao-Treasure, the pillar of the Law.

Moreover, you must revere and uphold this sacred text, approaching the Sovereign with reverence, meditating on His august form, extolling His sacred name—only then will you behold His merciful face, all receiving His protection, universally hearing the wondrous Law, personally offering devotion and worship, forever freed from transmigration."*

At these words, the Four Assemblies rejoiced, marveling as never before.

**Volume I, Chapter II: The Great Perfect Light and Supreme Divine Spell of the Highest and Most Illuminating Dao**

At that time, the Five Elders—Heaven’s Primordial Ancestors—prostrated and knelt, addressing the Celestial Sovereign:

*"We humbly hear that the Highest and Most Illuminated Sovereign, in boundless compassion for the common folk, universally emanates divine light, illuminating the Dharma-realm. The Six Ordinary and Four Holy beings alike partake in the blessings of the Dao.

Alas, as mortal lives are brief and the kalpa nears its end, the True Path must now be practiced to save the myriad people, enabling those who cultivate the True Way to ascend swiftly, while the common folk of the latter age all attain longevity.

Since ancient times, the *Elemental Origins: Sacred and Mysterious Treasure—The Crimson Scripture of the True Text*, emerged before the Primordial Beginning, within the Void of Emptiness, before Heaven and Earth took form, before the sun and moon shone—dark and obscure, without origin or lineage, without qi or form, without color or name, without shape or trace, without sound or voice. It was the boundless chaos, yet within it, sacred scriptures glimmered, appearing and vanishing.

The Two Principles awaited its division, the Great Sun its illumination. As cosmic patterns shifted and celestial omens emerged, it manifested in response to the moment.

The Jade Emperor entrusted us with the Sacred Seal of the Treasure and the Inconceivable Divine Spell, thus Heaven and Earth were divided, the Three Lights shone forth. The sacred scriptures flourished, illuminating the Pure and Transcendent. They emanated from the Azure Beginning-Heaven, their hue undefinable, their branches winding and intricate, beyond tracing.

The Primordial Origin refined it in the Hall of Mystic Yang, tempered it in the Courtyard of Flowing Fire, revealing its true text, radiant with brilliance. The Yang-qi was crimson, hence its name: *Crimson Scripture*.

When the sacred scriptures shone forth, ten thousand emperors paid homage to the True One, flying through the void, circling the Celestial Palace, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting sacred hymns.

At that time, Heaven sent twelve mysterious auspices, Earth produced twenty-four responses, celebrating the nine heavens’ sacred mysteries, praising the three heavens’ treasured brilliance. The divine wind stirred, and the Imperial Dao flourished.

The Primordial Origin ascended to command, the Most True One took up the brush, the Jade Consort swept the table, casting gold tablets and carving the Jade Texts. The Five Elders recorded them, sealing them in the Celestial Treasury of the Nine Heavens.

The Jade Maiden attended to the incense, the Great Hua held the cloth, the Jade Boys stood guard, the Jade Terrace faced the hall, and the Nine Heavens’ decrees were beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits.

Thus, Heaven treasured it to attain stability, Earth concealed it to ensure peace, the Five Emperors held it to secure dominion, the Three Lights rode upon it to ascend in splendor, the Sage Emperors upheld it to attain divinity, the Highest Exalted revered it to achieve the True, the Five Sacred Peaks followed it to gain spiritual power, the Son of Heaven obtained it to govern wisely, and the nation’s lineage enjoyed it to attain eternal peace.

Its virtue is the wondrous power of the sacred scriptures, the primordial root of Heaven and Earth. Its might is vast and boundless, encompassing all without measure, sweeping through the great transformation as the source of divine wisdom.

Its extent is unfathomable, towering in the boundless void. Its truth has a fixed principle, now to be put into practice.

At that time, the Primordial Origin shifted the cosmic patterns, the celestial omens unfolded, the sacred scriptures flourished, and divine manifestations appeared in the Five Directions, dividing Heaven and Earth, enlightening all living beings.

This is the work of the Great Ancestor—may we dare to glimpse its essence in the sacred repository?

Now the Imperial Dao spreads and blesses the ten directions. Observing the kalpa’s end, the True Wind must prevail.

Our humble wish is to let the clouds shade the eight extremes, the wind moisten the orchid groves, that withered branches may aspire to the luxuriance of Hua-Yang, and decaying bodies receive the elixir of the sacred isles.

Gazing upward in reverence to the Primordial Mercy, we humbly plead below: We pray for Your compassionate consideration of the common folk. Might the *Sacred Treasure Jade Texts* be granted to those unworthy, taught to those who have not heard?

Thus, the Primordial Celestial Sovereign, leaning on the table with uplifted bearing, concentrated His True Essence in profound contemplation. Observing that the time had come, He addressed the gathered assembly of all True Saints, determining yin and yang, calculating kalpas and cosmic cycles, comparing the Yellow River’s source, verifying celestial degrees, selecting worthy disciples, pointing to the Great Void, and chanting the Nine Mysteries. His words were not for the unenlightened, as if sealing the path to the True for those obstructed by ignorance."

At that moment, the Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns pressed their inquiries without ceasing. After a long while, the Primordial Celestial Sovereign then lowered His gaze in solemn contemplation and sighed deeply:

"How profound and subtle it is! What you now seek is not distant, yet its essence is vast. This is the **Primordial Dao’s Sacred Treasure**—the **True Texts of the Empty Void and Natural Mystery**—which gives birth to the heavens, establishes the earth, and enlightens the divine. It governs the Five Sacred Mountains, secures the realm, and brings prosperity to the people. The Sacred Treasure is **mysterious and profound**, the sovereign of all things; the heavens manifest this **primordial omen**, and the **spiritual response** arises naturally.

Now, the **three celestial cycles** are in motion, the **six heavenly Dao**s unfold, and **diverse methods** of enlightenment are at work. There shall be **thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao** to select the hearts of those who come. When this **methodical cycle** concludes, after the **three dragons**, in the year **Gengzi**, the **mixed qi** will universally dissipate. All the heavens will rejoice in assembly, and then My **True Dao** shall be revealed. For now, it may be entrusted to you, but it shall be recorded in the **Upper Register** and not yet practiced in this lower world. The **mysterious teachings** are forbidden—do not transmit them lightly.

You may proceed to **Sacred Capital’s Purple Micro Upper Palace**, where you shall hear the **Celestial Sound** in the **Golden Register**, receive the **divine decree** from the **Spiritual Sovereign**, and then be granted the **completion of heavenly texts** to oversee the Primordial Dao’s celestial domain.

Thus, the Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns, along with all the **True Saints**, in **pure incense and solemn vows**, wandered the **cloud paths**, and with a **divine chant** addressed the **Ten Heavens**, ascending to the **Uppermost Pure and Mysterious Jade Capital**—the **Cold Spirit Hall of the Primordial Treasure**—in the **Purple Micro Upper Palace**, to receive the **divine decree** of reverence. Only then did they realize that the **Celestial Mystery** is precious and rare, difficult to hear immediately.

Returning, they further visited the **Primordial Dao’s Hall**, seeking guidance on the **forbidden prohibitions**. They humbly declined, unable to grasp them.

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign’s **compassionate visage** pitied and instructed them. The **Spiritual Gate** opened wide, and the decree was given to the Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns to establish the **Hall of the Yang Void**. There, they unfolded the **Nine Radiant Eight-Colored** treasures—**cloud brocade’s pouch**—and produced the **Primordial Sacred Treasure’s Scarlet Book True Texts**, inscribed in **golden script and jade seals**, with **subtle and secret mysteries**, the **perfect and divine incantation** governing the **Great Radiance of the Primordial Void**. These were entrusted to the Five Elder Celestial Sovereigns and all the **True Saints**, commanding them to follow the **mysterious teachings** and adhere to the **method** in transmission.

At that time, the **Eastern Divine Treasure’s** **Green Spirit Elder Sovereign** received the **divine decree** of the **Nine Qi** from the **Primordial Sovereign of Jade Emperor**:
The **Eastern Nine Qi**, the **Primordial Sovereign of Azure Heaven**, where **Emerald Constellations** gather in dense layers. Within lies the **Elder Sovereign**, who oversees the **divine registers**, collects the **Qi**, and raises the **transcendent**. The **Twenty-Four-Character Eastern Sovereign’s Secret Texts**, written on the **Primordial Platform of the Nine Heavens**, govern the summoning of the **Nine Heavenly Sovereigns** and the **divine registers of immortals**. The **Year Star** assists the **Liver**, while **Jiao and Qiang** constrain the **True**. **Zi and Fang** regulate the **Heart and Tail**. The **Four Celestial Guardians** revolve in harmony. **Qi** presides over **Seven Celestial Beings**, while the **Upright Dipper** illuminates the **Wheel of Destiny**. **Capturing Qi and seizing the false**, they sweep away calamitous crowds. The **Thirty-Two-Character Secret Texts**, inscribed in the **Eastern Hall of the Purple Micro**, govern the summoning of **celestial officials**, the rectification of **heavenly divisions**, and the **establishment of celestial degrees**. The **Eastern Mountain’s Divine Incantation** collects the **Nine Heavens**. The **Scarlet Book’s Decree** commands the **Assembly of the Nether Mountains**. **Binding demons and dispatching ghosts**, none escape their judgment. All are summoned to the **Wood Palace**—none dare delay. The **Thirty-Two-Character Secret Texts**, written in the **Eastern Hall of the Primordial Spirit**, govern the **collection of ghosts and demons** and the **rectification of the Nine Heavenly Qi**. Below, they command the **Eastern River’s Water Sovereign**, the **Great Effort’s Dragon King**, the **Water Palace’s Paths**, and the **thousandfold routes**. The **Scarlet Book’s Decree** ensures **uninterrupted wind and fire**. The **Thirty-Two-Character Secret Texts**, inscribed in the **Primordial Jade Gate of the Nine Heavens’ Eastern-Northeast**, govern the **Eastern Sea’s Water Sovereign**, the **Great Effort’s flood**, and the **summoning of dragons and water spirits**.

This is the **Eastern Nine Qi’s Sacred Treasure True Texts**, totaling **one hundred and twenty characters**. All are the **Primordial Sovereign’s** **Great Perfect Divine Incantation** of the **Empty Void and Natural Mystery**, also known as the **True Chapter of the Primordial Spirit’s Preservation**, the **Eastern Mountain’s Divine Incantation**, and the **Eastern Sovereign’s Eightfold Strategy**.

The **rightful decree** of the **Jade Emperor** is hereby bestowed upon the **Eastern Nine Qi Sovereign**, commanding Him to oversee all the **eastern heavens and earths**, the **sun, moon, stars, and constellations**, the **sacred mountains and spiritous caverns**, the **Water Palace and Spring Courts**, the **highest saints and transcendent immortals**, and all **divine and potent beings**. Wherever the **decree and command** reach, they shall be followed as ordained.

The **Southern Divine Treasure’s** **True Elder Sovereign of Vermilion Spirit** received the **divine decree** from the **Primordial Sovereign of Scarlet Emperor**:

**Volume III: The Jade Emperor’s Merit and Virtue**

At that time, the **Jade Emptiness Supreme Emperor** spoke to the **Heavenly Venerable**:
*"May your compassion endure. May you benefit the Four Assemblies of Imperial Liberators, the Four Heavenly Kings, all celestial beings, all immortals, and all future beings who uphold this scripture for their benefit."*

The **Heavenly Venerable** replied to the **Jade Emptiness Supreme Emperor**:
*"How excellent your question! How virtuous you are!*
In compassion, you pity all beings and thus inquire of me."

The **Heavenly Venerable** said:
*"If there be a land in the Three Realms and Ten Directions—whether a kingdom’s ruler, ministers, or armies clashing in war—when pestilential qi spreads, or floods, droughts, locusts, or calamities bring famine, the king, queen, crown prince, prime ministers, and officials must, out of compassion for their people, **command all prefectures, counties, and magistrates** to **purify their halls, set great offerings, and recite the Dao six times daily**, turning this scripture. Thus shall their land be peaceful, the five grains abundant, and the people secure.*

*"If one enters mountains or forests and encounters venomous beasts, but **merely recalls this true scripture in thought**, the mountain spirits shall guard, and the beasts shall retreat, never harming them.*

*"If one enters rivers or seas to gather treasures, and encounters fierce winds, **reciting this true scripture as prescribed**, the winds and waves shall cease, and they shall reach shore safely.*

*"If in battle, when blades clash, **one silently recalls this true scripture**, the evil foes shall scatter.*

*"If imprisoned in shackles, **with a pure heart and steady mind, recalling this true scripture**, wrongs shall be righted, and liberation shall come.*

*"If tormented by malevolent spirits or demons, **reciting this true scripture as prescribed**, the evils shall flee, and healing shall follow naturally.*

*"If one seeks descendants, **revering and reciting this scripture as prescribed**, the **Jade Emperor’s decree** shall command the **Heavenly Tribunals** to inspect the **Dan Register**, and among the **Nine Ranks and Four Fruits of immortals**, those whose fate aligns shall be reborn to become their child—bright, eloquent, and noble among mortals.*

*"If a woman faces childbirth, **reciting this true scripture as prescribed**, mother and child shall be safe, bearing virtuous sons or daughters, beloved by all.*

*"If one seeks official promotion, noble rank, or favor from the sovereign, **reciting this true scripture as prescribed**, they shall ascend in office, their descendants honored, their lineage unbroken."*

If one seeks wealth and abundance, and **reveres and recites this true scripture as prescribed**, then treasures shall overflow, and sustenance shall come naturally. Blessings shall flow to their descendants, passed down through ten thousand generations.

If one is afflicted by malevolent stars, suffering in bed and couch, and **recites this true scripture as prescribed**, then these malevolent stars shall retreat, yielding auspicious fortune.

If one’s life is forfeit and they are destined for the underworld, their name recorded in the register of evils, then their parents, teachers, spouses, and children must **recite this true scripture** for them, or establish a Daoist ritual site with banners and floral offerings. Thus, the deceased’s ghostly records shall be erased, their spirit reborn in a pure land, and together with all suffering souls, they shall be protected and guided, attaining this supreme victory—all shall be born in heaven.

Moreover, wherever this scripture resides, the **Ten Heavenly Sovereigns of Supreme Truth** and the **Limitless Flying Celestial Kings** shall always attend as guardians, offering reverence and sustenance.

Those who uphold this scripture shall be entitled to call themselves **Orthodox One True Persons**. Such individuals, wherever they go, shall be invisibly protected by the **Supreme Saints of the Ten Directions**, the **Vajra Warriors**, as though guarding their own bodies. Whether entering or exiting, wherever they wander, all malevolent forces shall avoid their path, demons and ghosts shall be exterminated, spirits shall cower in hiding, and all calamities shall be powerless to approach.

When such a person nears the end of their life, they shall not see the horrors of the underworld, but instead shall behold heavenly maidens bearing banners descending to welcome them, and they shall be born in heaven.

When their heavenly blessings are exhausted and they are reborn in the mortal realm, they shall, across countless lifetimes, always be reborn as kings, great ministers, or sages, presiding over peaceful lands where the people prosper. They shall always retain their innate clarity, follow the Great Dao, and through successive cultivation, ultimately attain the Daoist path.

Such are the blessings bestowed upon those who uphold this scripture.

Furthermore, if one who holds this scripture, when rain falls, arises with great compassion and, as prescribed, recites this scripture three times in its entirety toward the sky, then wherever the rain touches and in whatever direction they face, all beings—even those guilty of the five heinous and ten grave offenses, or bearing heavy sins—shall have their transgressions utterly erased. All grave illnesses shall be instantly cured.

These beings, upon death, shall not fall into the underworld but shall be reborn in pure lands, emerging from lotus flowers. How much more so for those who uphold this scripture itself.

Again, if one who holds this scripture walks the roads and encounters a great wind blowing, the dust that touches their body shall, wherever it lands, cause all beings to have their evil deeds utterly eradicated, sparing them from the three evil paths, and they shall be born in heaven.

Thus, the merits of upholding this scripture are unfathomable.

If such a person bathes in rivers, lakes, or the sea, the water that touches them shall, wherever it flows, cleanse all beings within—fish, turtles, and all aquatic creatures—of their sins.

For this lifetime alone, upon death, they shall no longer take rebirth in any form—whether as embryo, egg, or wet-born.

Whatever words such a person speaks—whether good or evil—all heavenly demons and heterodox sects who hear them shall regard them as the pure sound of the law.

If such a person encounters a shrine, they may recite this scripture for the deities within. The ghosts and spirits who hear it shall escape the ghostly realm and ascend to the path of true immortality, revering this person as though they were the Emperor himself.

If one in this world is unfilial to their parents, disrespectful of the Three Jewels, guilty of killing, stealing, adultery, or false speech, and has committed the gravest offenses, and as they near death, if a virtuous and faithful being arises with great compassion and, while the dying still breathe, invokes the Emperor’s sacred name—whether for one, two, three, or four seven-day periods, up to a hundred or a thousand recitations—the deceased’s past misdeeds shall all be erased, and they shall avoid all evil destinies, ascending to the Ninth Heaven. How much more so for those who uphold this scripture.

Again, if one, from past eons to this very life, has cycled through the realms of humans and gods, drifting through the world with countless sins accumulated, and merely brushes against the shadow of one who upholds this scripture—or even hears their voice, as though receiving imperial edicts or comforting words from the Dao—their sins shall be permanently eradicated.

If one who upholds this scripture crafts a long banner inscribed with the Emperor’s name and hangs it on a tall pole, whether in a temple or a household, and the wind carries it, all beings in the direction it faces shall be blessed, and their evil deeds shall be utterly destroyed.

If one who upholds this scripture inscribes the Emperor’s name on any resonant object—bells, chimes, gongs, drums, or any Daoist ritual implements—whether used in ceremonies, performances, or carried by the wind, the sound they produce, near or far, shall purify all beings who hear it of their sins.

If one who upholds this scripture awakens to the nature of life and death, retreats into the mountains to cultivate the Dao, and gazes upon the world from afar, wherever their eyes rest—across mountains, forests, streams, and valleys—all living beings, visible and invisible, born of embryo, egg, or wetness, moving or still, flying or swimming, of every kind, shall have their sins permanently erased. Their body and mind shall be purified, and upon death, they shall be born in heaven. How much more so for those who uphold this scripture.

Know that such a person is the very embodiment of the Daoist Canon, a body of boundless merit.

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign spoke to the **Jade Emptiness Emperor**, saying: *"Now I have spoken briefly, yet the wonders remain unexplained."*

If I were to expound at length, all who cling to heretical views and harbor doubts would remain in confusion and disbelief. The merits of this scripture transcend all kalpas and cannot be fully expressed.

At that time, the Jade Emptiness Emperor, upon hearing these words, rejoiced with a boundless heart, leaping with exhilaration. Gazing upon the Celestial Sovereign’s benevolent visage, he bowed deeply and chanted in praise:

*"Above the Nine Heavens lies the Great Luo,*
*Where the Jade Capital and Golden Gates stand,*
*Clouds piled high in majestic tiers.*
*Within dwell the Heavenly Sovereigns,*
*Renowned for mercy and harmony.*

*The Dao is unrivaled, subduing all demons,*
*Heaven’s treasures and sacred laws shine,*
*With myriad gods and immortal hosts,*
*Banners and flags unfurled in splendor.*
*All who hear shall see their sins erased,*
*Forever freed from the river of desire.*

*This is the Jade Emperor,*
*The Celestial Lord of the Vault of Heaven,*
*Pure and radiant, wisdom and eloquence incarnate,*
*The Supreme of the Dao,*
*Teacher of the Three Realms,*
*Primordial Ancestor of the Mystic One,*
*None can surpass Him,*
*The Merciful Father of the Four Births,*
*The Highest Sage of the Upper Realms,*
*The Great Benevolent One—*
*Ten titles perfected,*
*Ten thousand virtues embodied.*

*He liberates countless beings,*
*Rescuing them from the suffering of birth and death."*

When the Jade Emptiness Emperor finished reciting this hymn and the Ten Titles, all the celestial hosts spoke in unison, marveling at what they had never before heard.

**The *Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture*, Volume Two**
**Chapter Four: The Heavenly True Ones’ Protection**

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven, upon hearing the scripture’s teachings, rose from his seat and knelt long before the Emperor, addressing him: *"O Jade Emperor, I humbly request permission to propagate this scripture’s benefits for all beings and celestial assemblies."*

The Jade Emperor, moved by compassion, opened the path of benefit and declared the sacred laws of the Jade Treasury, transmitting the *Lingbao* methods. He spoke to the Celestial Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven: *"Listen carefully—I shall now expound upon the merits of upholding this scripture, its power to rescue the perishing, benefit the living and the dead, and perform divine wonders."*

The assembled immortals bowed in reverence and spoke in unison: *"Your disciples today are fortunate to hear this eternal and abiding law. May it uplift the blessings of the Three Realms’ celestial hosts and dispel the poisons of the Three Lower Realms. We pray for Your compassion to unfold this wondrous meaning for our sake."*

The Emperor replied: *"Should any being honor their parents, revere the Three Jewels, serve their ruler with loyalty, refrain from killing, stealing, lust, jealousy, anger, or malice, avoid arrogance and deceit, uphold precepts and observe fasts, cultivate the Dao with sincerity, and with reverence recite this scripture—I shall command the sands of the Western Regions to spread this teaching across the Ten Directions and the Boundless Worlds.

I command the Eastern Heavenly Sovereign of Eastern Hua, with his green-clad celestial armies—innumerable in number—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Southeastern Sovereign of Fusan, with his retinue of celestial armies—innumerable in number—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Southern Sovereign of Zhuling, with his red-clad celestial armies—innumerable in number—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.

I command the Upper Sovereign of Laihe, along with the mountain and cave immortals—innumerable in number—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command all the Golden Immortals of the Lower Realms, the Four Assemblies and Eight Departments, and their attendants—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Flying Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions, the Great Flying Gods, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Two Luminaries and Nine Stars, the Northern and Southern Dipper Constellations, the Eastern, Western, and Central Dipper Stars, the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions and the Celestial Hosts, the Vajra Warriors, and all divine kings with their retinues—to descend and protect all who uphold this scripture.
I command the Demonic-Subduing Warriors, the Four Heavenly Gate Kings, the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Seas, the remaining mountains, the Four Oceans and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, and all rulers of mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes—to descend with their attendants and protect all who uphold this scripture, ensuring their safety in perilous places.
I command all local land spirits, ditch and canal deities, and great ghostly kings of might—to protect all who uphold this scripture.

Let all malevolent demons and heterodox forces be subdued, vanishing in fear, fleeing to distant skies or foreign lands. May all spirits summoned through mountain schemes, hall altars, blood offerings, or other rites self-destruct;
May the plague and pestilence spirits of the Five Directions, the hungry ghosts, the Wind King and water monsters, the malevolent dragons and demonic spirits, the earth and wood imps—all self-destruct;
May the Five Musts and Six Taboos, those who disrupt dreams, and practitioners of wild sorcery, curses, and poison—all self-destruct.

For those whose hearts harbor pure wishes, all desires shall be fulfilled.
Those who uphold this scripture—whether they follow the prescribed rites, observe fasts, or possess pure precepts—yet hold it in faith and reverence, or even those who merely venerate this scripture alongside others who uphold fasts and pure precepts—all shall share in its protection."*

The virtues of such a person are boundless and unobstructed,
free and unrestrained—known as the Sage among mortals,
their virtue and blessings ever renewed, equal to the Immortals.

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Highest Heaven, upon hearing this,
composed a song before the Celestial Assembly:

*"Great is the Dao of the Highest,
Formless, nameless.
Vast through countless kalpas,
The Yellow Path opens clear.
Divine and luminous,
The Nine Souls exhale their essence.
The Jade Void shines pure,
The Supreme Radiance ascends high.
The Jade Emperor’s transformation,
Universal salvation for Heaven and Earth.
The Three Primordials nourish the Dao,
The Two Symbols awe all life.
Skillfully replanting ancient roots,
What was withered blooms anew.
The sluggish stir to life,
Eternal transformation takes form.
Conceiving and gestating,
All attain birth.
The departed pass beyond,
Their spirits return to the Three Pure Ones,
Their souls receive the Chain of Degrees,
Ascending to the Southern Palace.
This day is most auspicious,
All are bathed in light.
The Five Degrees reflect their glory,
Proclaiming to all beings.
To the gods of Heaven and Earth,
And the rivers’ sources.
To the Five Peaks and Four Seas,
And the sacred mountains.
To the Caverns of Mystery and Emptiness,
The Caverns of Void and Immortality.
To the Supreme Saint of the Boundless,
The Most True and Noble Deity.
Boundless and infinite,
They universally guide and save all beings.
Evil roots are severed,
Names recorded in the Mystic Capital.
The ranks of Immortals assemble,
All listen to the Emperor’s decree.
This is the Emperor’s edict,
Protecting those who chant and uphold it.
To the utmost shores of the Dao,
No calamity shall intrude.
I, by the Emperor’s command,
Proclaim this to all."*

At that time, the Celestial Sovereign of the Highest Heaven,
having finished this song, addressed the Great Assembly:
*"This is the profound speech of the Jade Emperor,
The secret words of the Saints.
The path is cut off, the Dao is severed—
Subtle and beyond thought,
Vast and all-encompassing,
The foundation of divine wisdom,
Guarding the land and delivering beings from birth and death."*

When the Celestial Sovereign spoke these words,
The gathered assembly, all reverent,
Gazed upward and attained enlightenment.

Then the Heavenly Lord declared:
*"The Jade Emperor’s virtues are supreme,
His mysteries profound and deep.
He existed before the Great Calamity,
His transformations span ancient and modern times.
Now I proclaim this wondrous scripture,
Out of compassion for all sentient beings.
This is the most sublime of laws,
The foremost of virtues.
The name of the Great Radiant Sovereign,
Whose power and virtue are unparalleled.
He can subdue violent demonic kings,
All bow their hearts in submission;
He can erase the gravest offenses,
All attain purity and justice.
If one hears this scripture,
Or even the Emperor’s name,
And bows in reverence,
All sins are annihilated.
The Ten Evils and Four Grave Offenses,
The Five Heinous Crimes against parents—
With but a single devout invocation,
All vanish at the sound.
It protects both heavenly and human hosts,
From the Four Calamities and Five Decays.
From the Three Realms’ extreme sufferings,
From human misfortunes and disasters.
From famine, plague, and poisonous drugs,
From curses and malevolent spirits,
From lawsuits and vengeful enemies,
From battles and warfare’s torments,
From the perils of wild mountains,
From tigers, leopards, wolves, and hyenas,
From venomous dragons of river and sea,
From swift lightning, wind, and hail,
From fire, thieves, and bandits,
From sorcery and poisonous plots,
From madness and loss of reason,
From venomous snakes and noxious creatures,
From malevolent demons and monstrous gods—
All who seek to harm,
By holding this true scripture,
Shall all disperse and perish.
Chronic illnesses, long endured,
Even in dreams, bring no rest—
No unnatural death shall claim them,
No loss of treasures shall befall.
Through encountering this scripture,
They attain peace and freedom.
All desires and aspirations—
Wealth, treasures, and noble status—
Through this scripture’s virtues,
Shall be fulfilled as wished.
The divine power of the Immortal Sage,
The Eleven Lights of Virtue,
The Thirty-two Heavenly Lords,
The Twenty-eight Constellation Kings,
The Celestial Consorts and Jade Maidens,
The gods of Heaven and Earth,
The gods of the Three Realms and Void,
The Dragon Kings of rivers and seas,
The gods of water, fire, and wind,
The palaces and dwellings,
The mountains, forests, and trees,
The spirits of ditches, wells, and springs—
All, by upholding this scripture,
Shall protect and defend.
Food and clothing shall come naturally,
Children shall dwell in wealth and honor.
Their words shall be heard with awe,
All shall revere them wherever they go.
If one seeks sons or daughters,
And chants this true scripture,
The Emperor shall descend to the Celestial Bureau,
Registering them as Heavenly Immortals,
Condescending to be reborn in their family,
To become their son or daughter.
Their descendants shall be noble and esteemed,
Seven generations ascending to Immortality.
Their lineage shall flourish,
Blessings extending to their parents."*

The blessings of auspiciousness shall ever flourish and thrive,
While calamities and obstacles shall fail to intrude.
Therefore, I now proclaim—
The assembly must listen with utmost care.

With boundless compassion, all shall attain the Upper Purity.
Thus, the Celestial Sage addressed the Four Assemblies:
*"All mortals who uphold and recite this scripture,
Who receive and bear the Imperial Name,
Shall have deep Daoic roots and virtuous karmic ties from past lives.
This scripture is sublime and exalted,
Universal in its salvation of both heavenly and human beings.
If one devotes oneself with sincerity and reverence,
Their family and nation shall know peace,
Their life preserved, disasters averted,
All ill omens swept away.

When emperors and kings uphold it,
Their realm shall know great harmony,
Bandits and tyrants shall be pacified,
Borderlands shall know no strife.
The common folk shall sing in joy,
And the land shall flourish in prosperity.
As the cosmic cycles turn,
The true Dao shall prevail.
Those who attain this scripture—
Heaven’s essence is profound and weighty;
Guard it, guard it well.

**Section Five: Divine Retribution and Verification**

At that time, the True Persons of Compassionate Liberation, Seeking-Voice for Suffering, Saving-Life from Death, and Ten-Thousand Blessings for Protection—
All rose from their seats, stepping beyond their ranks,
And together addressed the Celestial Sage:
*"If the common folk of the degenerate age,
Though they may have past virtuous ties,
Encounter this scripture yet are defiled by malevolent obstacles,
Their doubts—both origin and end—
Shall cause them to disbelieve in its merits.
What retribution, then, shall they suffer in the hells of the past or present?
We humbly pray for Your Holiness
To expound upon their suffering in the evil destinies."*

The Celestial Sage then spoke to the Four True Persons:
*"If the world’s fierce, violent, and wicked beings,
Day and night before Daoic images,
Hold no reverence, uttering blasphemies,
Their crime shall cast them into the Five Uninterrupted Hells.
But if they meet one who upholds this scripture,
And through skillful means is led to repent,
Even if their wicked hearts are but momentarily extinguished,
And they take faith in this scripture,
Their sins shall be utterly purged without remainder.

Yet if there are those with perverse views and foolish obstinacy,
Seeing one who holds this scripture,
They may harbor malice, cast sidelong glances,
Or even conceive a single evil thought,
Utter a single evil word,
And slander those who uphold this scripture—
Their offense is such that, after death,
They shall fall into the Great Hell,
With no hope of escape.
How much more so for those in the world
Who, though they encounter this scripture,
Generate no reverence,
Defile it with unclean hands,
Recite it with unclean mouths,
Place it upon impure beds,
Or read it aloud in jest,
Treating it as common scripture.
Such persons, after death,
Shall descend into the Uninterrupted Hell,
With no hope of escape,
Their misfortunes extending to nine generations,
Subjected to torments in the Underworld’s prisons.
Their descendants shall be ensnared in suffering,
Enduring uncountable eons of torment in hell,
Encountering countless sages who rescue them,
Their sins slightly diminished.
When rescued by a sage, they shall be reborn as hungry ghosts,
Suffering for countless eons without even the name of water.
From the ghostly realm, they shall be reborn as beasts,
And from beasts, as humans—
Yet even then, as barbarians or heretics,
Or as women in poverty and wretchedness,
Stricken with a hundred ailments,
Abandoned by all, unable to live or die.
Thus, to slight this scripture brings such retribution.

Again, if one initially takes faith but later grows negligent,
The Virtuous Boys shall report them to the Three Officials,
Their names added to the Black Register,
Their merits subtracted from the Green Ledger.
After death, they shall be imprisoned in the Netherworld,
Traversing the Three Realms without escape.
Or in this life, they shall suffer myriad diseases—
Leprosy, scabs, and festering sores—
As karmic fruit.
Day and night, they shall be tormented by sorrow,
Their bodies ravaged by sudden violence;
Or imprisoned in chains, wrongfully harming themselves,
Or mistakenly consuming poison;
Or devoured by tigers, wolves, or venomous serpents,
Or slain by enemies in vengeance;
Or, wandering in forests, meeting bandits who slaughter them,
Hurl them from cliffs;
Or harmed by malevolent spirits and goblins,
Or burned and drowned by fire and water,
Or slaughtered by blades and weapons.
To slight this scripture brings untimely death,
Such is their fruit, such their retribution.
How can one not grieve? How can one not lament?

Therefore, I warn you—
Follow this path with devotion,
Nurture no evil thoughts.
If no evil thoughts arise,
All entanglements shall cease,
And defilements as vast as dust shall dissolve with the mind.
All calamitous demons shall be naturally extinguished.
The merits of this scripture are unfathomable.
It is the supreme, unparalleled, wondrous law,
The sovereign of all scriptures,
Of great benefit.

Let no commoner reveal it.
If heavenly and human beings,
Facing decline and decay, the wheel of rebirth pressing in,
Can abandon delusion and uphold this scripture,
They shall naturally summon celestial blessings,
Their lifespan extended, transcending the Three Realms,
And abide with the Dao eternally.

This scripture is unmatched, unsurpassed.
It is the Great Powerful and Great Divine Spell,
Capable of making withered branches sprout leaves and fruit,
Flourishing and abundant,
Able to eliminate the gravest sufferings of beings,
And grant longevity to those with short lives.
Its merits are unfathomable, beyond all praise.

If one lacks past Daoic roots,
Or has not cultivated vast merit,
Even the name of this scripture may not be heard—
How much less shall they see it?
For this scripture follows the true patterns of the Three Caverns,
Transmitted but once in eighty thousand eons.
It is the treasure of the Most Pure and Supreme Sage of the Celestial Capital,
Secreted within the Jade Capital’s Golden Gate Palace,
Exceedingly subtle and rare,
Difficult to encounter.
Only those with innate Daoic essence—
Future Nine-Heaven True Immortals—
Shall, by fate’s design,
Receive it from their master after oaths of allegiance,
And only then may they inherit its transmission."

**Translation:**

*"Do not reveal this lightly—revere it and guard it carefully.*

Then, the Celestial Sage expounded this truth and spoke in verse:

*If the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers*
*Could sprout lotuses from their waves,*
*If the raven’s feathers turned as white as snow,*
*Still, this scripture would be as rare to encounter.*

*If tortoises grew fur,*
*Fit for weaving into robes,*

*If rabbits grew horns,*
*Fit for ladders to the heavens,*

*Still, this scripture would be as rare to encounter.*

*If shrews climbed those horned ladders,*
*And ate the moon in the sky,*
*Still, this scripture would be as rare to encounter.*

*If donkeys’ lips turned*
*The color of the *pīngpó* fruit,*
*And they could sing and dance,*
*Still, this scripture would be as rare to encounter.*

*If flies could drink from stone jars,*
*And drown in wild intoxication,*
*Still, this scripture would be as rare to encounter.*

At that time, the Celestial Sage finished speaking the verse and declared to the Four Assemblies:

*Thus, those who hold this scripture*
*Are called the **Body of Virtue**—*
*All beings benefit from its shade.*

*Those who hold this scripture*
*Are called the **Body of Mystic Power**—*

*Illuminating all they encompass.*

*Those who hold this scripture*
*Are called the **Body of Freedom**—*
*They wander the celestial palaces,*
*Their spirits unbound.*

*The merits of this scripture are beyond measure.*

*Moreover, if a Daoist adept,*
*Having purified themselves,*
*Wears new, clean robes,*
*And at midnight, in solitude,*
*In a quiet chamber,*
*Knocks their teeth nine times,*
*Sits facing east,*
*And recites this scripture—*

*Then, the Most Pure Sovereign takes their seat,*
*The Jade Consort sweeps the hall,*
*The myriad spirits assemble in ranks,*
*The celestial hosts stand at attention,*
*The Three Realms guard in attendance,*
*And the Five Emperors oversee the welcome.*

*Then, closing their eyes and stilling their mind,*
*They visualize this scripture,*
*And unknowingly find themselves within the Five Clouds.*
*Suddenly, their body shines brightly,*
*Ascending to the celestial palaces,*
*Where the Immortals descend to greet them.*
*Whatever they request is granted,*
*And wondrous elixirs and treasures appear at will.*

*Thus, one must focus their heart and follow this scripture’s methods.*
*Even the Three-World Golden Immortals and the Ten-Direction Great Sages*
*All depend on this scripture for their cultivation and attainment,*
*And thereby swiftly realize the Supreme Wondrous Dao.*

*This is the Emperor of all—*
*The Teacher of the Buddhas,*
*The King of the Saints.*

*Therefore, even ordinary mortals who encounter this scripture*
*Shall be aided by the Five Emperors,*
*Summon spirits and immortals,*
*Command the celestial palaces,*
*Direct the forces of yin and yang,*
*Receive reverence from the myriad True Ones,*
*And cause all spirits to submit.*
*All malevolent forces flee,*
*And demons bind their forms.*
*After death, they ascend to the Southern Palace for refinement,*
*Walk the Flying Steps to Upper Purity,*
*And dwell in boundless freedom,*
*Living eternally with the Dao.*

*Furthermore, if even worldly beings*
*Have once heard this scripture*
*And long for it with devotion,*
*And in their homes choose a pure place,*
*Paint the Emperor’s likeness,*
*And with sincere reverence,*
*Morning and evening offer incense, flowers, lamps, and fruit,*
*Honoring and venerating the name—*

*Such a person shall attain thirty kinds of supreme merit:*
1. *The praise of the Immortals,*
2. *The rebirth of the deceased in heaven,*
3. *Liberation from past misfortunes,*
4. *Smooth passage in all endeavors,*
5. *Freedom from thieves and robbers,*
6. *All desires fulfilled,*
7. *Avoidance of water and fire calamities,*
8. *The dissolution of hostile affairs,*
9. *Auspicious dreams at night,*
10. *No sickness or illness,*
11. *Wisdom and clarity,*
12. *The joy of all who see them,*
13. *Abundant food and clothing,*
14. *Honored and noble descendants,*
15. *The delight of relatives,*
16. *Harmony in their clan,*
17. *Escape from the three evil retributions,*
18. *Transformation from female to male,*
19. *Graceful and dignified appearance,*
20. *Appointment as a great minister of the realm,*
21. *Birth as an emperor,*
22. *The reverence of ghosts and spirits,*
23. *Knowledge of past lives,*
24. *The protection of all spirits,*
25. *The blessings of the nine clans,*
26. *A long life in this world,*
27. *The reliance of all sentient beings on their goodness,*
28. *The welcome of the Demon Kings,*
29. *Transcendence beyond the Three Realms,*
30. *Ascension in broad daylight.*

At that time, the Celestial Sage again declared to the Four Assemblies:

*This scripture’s merits*
*Can shatter iron-enclosed mountains,*
*Drain the苦海 of suffering,*
*Break the Great Hell,*
*Extract the deepest sins,*
*Subdue violent demon-kings,*
*Protect all lands,*
*Extinguish all malevolent ghosts,*
*Remove all grave illnesses,*
*Dissolve all poisons,*
*Free one from all wicked men,*
*Tame all venomous beasts,*
*Crush all heretical paths—*
*And all the celestial hosts*
*Shall bow in submission."*

The remaining virtues are beyond measure.

At that time, the gathered assembly of the Dao/Way, the Golden Immortals and Bodhisattvas, and the true saints and their consorts, upon hearing these words, rejoiced and leapt in delight, bowed in reverence, and composed this hymn:

*"Great is the Supreme Dao/Way,
Without sect or ultimate truth.
Above, it transcends all celestial realms;
Below, it rescues the lost spirits.
It has no master or ancestor—
The Dao/Way itself is the body.

In the Dan Platform and Purple Bureaus,
At the Golden Gates and Jade Capitals,
This wondrous law is concealed,
Bestowing boundless blessings upon all living things.

It extinguishes my ten thousand sins,
And prolongs my boundless years.

Ten thousand spirits pay homage,
And the Demon Kings welcome in protection.

Its virtues flourish grandly,
Recorded in the Yellow Register of Merit.
Through countless eons, it grants me eternal life."*

Thus, the assembly having recited this hymn, bowed in homage and took refuge, then respectfully withdrew.

*The Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct Scripture, Volume Two, ends.*
