# 无上大乘要诀妙经

*The Supreme Mahāyāna Esoteric Sūtra of Essential Precepts*

Thus have I heard: In the Dragon-Han era, the Heavenly Worthy manifested within the Land of Great Blessing Hall, transforming into a spontaneous seven-jeweled mystic terrace adorned with myriad precious grains. Banners and flowered canopies enveloped the entire realm. Seated in equipoise at its center, he radiated boundless luminosity, illumining the ten directions and all worlds without limit, so that all became resplendently clear.

At that time, the assembly of great holy deities, Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elders, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords of the Supreme, the Jade Dawn Highest August Perfected Ones, the Left and Right Two Perfected, and immeasurable hosts gathered as one. The Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms, Dragon Kings of the Ten Thousand Seas, and Immortals of the ten directions arrived upon beams of light, offering priceless treasures. Incense of a hundred harmonies perfumed the air without burning, and celestial music resounded in unison.

The Primordial Heavenly King addressed the Supreme Great Dao Lord, saying: "You have accumulated vast merit, attained the wisdom of the Dao, and instructed sentient beings, delivering all without exception. The Three Expedients are now mastered, and the lineage of the myriad sages is complete. Yet you have not yet received this Supreme Mahāyāna Esoteric Precept—the ultimate, eternally abiding Dharma of boundless profundity. Through kalpas of accumulated virtue, the fruit is now ripe."

Thereupon, he bestowed the Supreme Mahāyāna Esoteric Precept: "The supreme Dharma transcends form above and depth below. Through it, the ultimate Dharma-body attains irreversible realization, its station equal to mine. I entrust you with the Three Vehicles’ teachings to deliver sentient beings. You must diligently cultivate the mind of great compassion, enabling all beings to escape affliction, transcend the Three Realms, and cross the bridge you provide."

Then, the Supreme Dao Lord rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and received the prophecy, declaring: "Today, hearing this Dharma-sound, my heart leaps with joy—such has never been before! Why is this? Since first studying the Dao, I have dwelled alone in mountains and forests, sitting or walking, ever pondering: *I too have entered the Dharma-nature—why then has the Heavenly Worthy delivered me with the lesser vehicle?* Yet this is my own fault, not the Heavenly Worthy’s. Why is this?"

"If I had resolved my mind to cultivate the profound wisdom of the Cavernous Illightenment, I would surely have been delivered by the Great Vehicle. Yet our wisdom was shallow—upon hearing of the Daoist teachings, we merely believed and accepted them, thus attaining immortality and dwelling for eons, never once hearing of this boundless Great Vehicle Dharma. Today, by your gracious instruction, my doubts and misgivings dissolve entirely. Only now do I realize I am a true child of the Dao, born of the Dao, transformed by the Dharma."

Thereupon, the Supreme Dao Lord, overcome with joy and relief, extolled in verse:

I hear this Dharma-sound,
Attaining what was never before.
My heart brims with boundless joy,
All doubts crumble to dust.
Now I shall not lose the Great Vehicle,
My life undying, everlasting.
It dispels the afflictions of beings—
Hearing it, all my leaks are healed.
Once clinging to the lesser vehicle,
I reproached myself for the gravest fault.
Today I receive the supreme prophecy,
Utterly freed from all suffering.
Together in this single Dharma,
This truth I never knew before.
How can afflicted beings
Ever overcome their clinging?
By accumulated virtue and practice,
Now I am bathed in sweet dew.
Golden-hued, thirty-two marks,
Eighty subtle signs adorn my form.
My merit is profound and weighty—
No demon king can slander me.
In the emptiness of Dharma, I attain realization,
All doubts and regrets are washed away.
The waves of illusion now subdued,
I bow in deepest reverence.

The Dao declared: "In countless kalpas past, I have expounded the supreme Dao, ever teaching and transforming you. You have followed me through long nights of study, and as each was fit to be delivered, I guided you into the Dao and Dharma, desiring that your aspirations ascend to my highest Way. Yet you were content with the lesser vehicle, deeming it sufficient. Now I proclaim to you the Great Vehicle sutra, named *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Teachings of All Perfected Dharmas*."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "You have amassed deep and weighty practice, and now attain your wish—ascending to the supreme station, your wisdom complete, your celestial palace adorned with the seven treasures, resplendent with heavenly blossoms. You too shall teach the Three Vehicles’ Dharma to transform beings."

Thereupon, the assembly of sages and the hosts of heavens gathered, witnessing the Supreme Dao Lord receive the prophecy of the supreme fruit. Their hearts overflowed with joy, leaping boundlessly, and each removed their celestial robes, exquisite blossoms, and fragrant offerings to make obeisance. Countless heavenly musicians played myriad instruments in the void, all at once, and the entire great assembly aroused the mind of the supreme, true, and correct Dao.

At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord, having received the prophecy of the supreme Dao, addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Formerly, following your teachings, I attained the Dharma of transcending birth, old age, sickness, death, and abiding eternally. I now wish to expound its causes and conditions to the fourfold assembly, having dispelled all doubts and regrets."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Those of wisdom comprehend through analogy. Consider an elder, advanced in years, possessing vast wealth and a vast estate. His home has but one gate, within which dwell over a hundred people. The halls and pavilions, decayed and crumbling, suddenly burst into flame, causing great alarm. Though I escape, my children remain inside the burning house, playing heedlessly, unaware of danger. The fire closes in, yet they do not perceive the peril. I call to them: *This is a burning house—you will soon perish! I have small carts, medium carts, and great ox-carts waiting outside. Come forth and play as you wish; I shall grant whatever you desire.* Overjoyed, the children rush out in competition."

The elder, seeing his children safely emerged and no longer obstructed on any side, felt his heart at ease, filled with joy and exultation. Then each of the children addressed their father, saying: *"The playthings you promised earlier—the small carts, the medium carts, and the great ox-carts—we now wish to receive them as you pledged."* Thereupon, the elder bestowed upon each child a single great cart. These carts were tall and wide, adorned with manifold treasures, their sides encircled by railings and balustrades, with bells hanging on all four sides. Above, canopies were spread, embellished with rare and wondrous jewels, while jeweled cords intertwined, garlands of flowers hung down, and layers of fine silken drapes were laid, with crimson pillows set in place. They were drawn by white oxen, their hides lustrous and full, their forms comely and strong, possessed of great vigor, walking with steady gait, swift as the wind. Many attendants and guards accompanied them. The elder declared: *"These young ones are all my children. Since I am so abundantly wealthy, with countless treasure-carts, I should treat them all equally, granting each one without distinction. Why? Even if I were to distribute all my treasures to an entire kingdom, they would not be exhausted—how much less for my own children!"* Each child, riding in a great cart, rejoiced exceedingly, for this was beyond their original hopes.

The Dao said: *"This elder rescued my children from the peril of the burning house and further bestowed upon them these seven-jeweled carts. My practice of great compassion is likewise. I am the father of all in the world, having forever extinguished all fear, decay, sorrow, affliction, and the darkness of ignorance, ever employing good deeds to deliver beings. The Three Realms are but a burning house; all beings are scorched by birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and the obscurity of delusion—the fires of the Three Poisons. I teach them to enter the supreme, most true Dao. Seeing beings seared by birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, and suffering, and further tormented by the pursuit of the five desires and wealth, enduring manifold afflictions—yet still clinging and craving, presently suffering in this life and later in the hells, as beasts, or as hungry ghosts—even if born in heaven or among humans, they face poverty, hardship, the pain of separation from the beloved, and the harm of hatred. Such are the sufferings in which beings are submerged, playing heedlessly, unaware and unknowing, not seeking liberation. Within this burning house of the Three Realms, they run to and fro, though beset by great suffering, yet do not perceive the peril. Seeing this plight, I declare: I am the father of beings; I must rescue them from suffering and grant them boundless wisdom, the limitless Dao-ground, that they may play freely and find ease. The Dao said: If I were to refrain from speaking of their fears through spiritual power, beings could not thereby be delivered. Why? These beings, though spared birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, and suffering, are still scorched by the burning house of the Three Realms—how could they attain the wisdom of the sages? Just as that elder, though strong in body and hand, did not employ force, but with earnest skillful means rescued his children from the burning house and later gave each a great treasure-cart, so too do I employ the skillful means of wisdom to deliver beings from the burning house of the Three Realms, establishing them in the Three Vehicles: the earthly immortals, the heavenly immortals, and the supreme Dao Vehicle. You must not delight in dwelling within the burning house of the Three Realms, nor cling to coarse and base sounds, forms, fragrances, and tastes. If you cling and generate attachment, you will be burned by the fire. Swiftly depart the Three Realms and attain the Three Vehicles: the lesser immortals, the middle immortals, and the supreme Dao Vehicle. These words are true and shall never be false. You who understand these Three Vehicles, praised by the sages, should pity beings who seek nothing, abide in stillness and contemplation, and find joy in themselves, thereby attaining peace, security, and the bliss of non-action. If there are beings who hear this Dharma, believe and accept it, cultivate diligently, and seek omniscience, pitying and delivering all beings, this is called the Great Vehicle. Those who seek this Vehicle are called the supreme and ultimate ones. Just as those children, seeking the ox-carts, emerged from the burning house, I wish to free beings from the sufferings of the Three Realms and grant them the joy of the unending. Thus, the Dao teaches the Three Vehicles to guide beings, but ultimately delivers them solely through the Great Vehicle. This Dharma is inexhaustible, yet not all can receive it. For this reason, know that the sages teach according to what is fitting."*

Thereupon, the Dao Lord, having received this prophecy and rejoiced, spoke these verses:

*The Heavenly Worthy expounds the wondrous teaching,
Now heard as never before.
Attaining the Dao’s great power of wisdom,
Life spans become immeasurable.
All rejoice together,
Hearing the Dao-ground of the sutra.
Diligently cultivate the Six Perfections,
Hold fast to your resolve and be courageous.
The profound chapters spread through the Three Realms,
Their wondrous resonance flowing in the ten directions.
Ascending beyond the Great Veil,
Soaring in the realm of non-action.
With great compassion for beings,
Again proclaiming long life.
All possess good roots,
Leaks extinguished, they turn toward coolness.
If you seek omniscience,
Practice the Six Great Perfections.
Guard the precepts and remain pure,
Firm in resolve for the supreme endeavor.
Offer treasures and make offerings,
Devoting your heart without stinginess.
Holding to this single-minded merit,
Aspire to the supreme virtue.
I attain omniscience,
All the powers of divine concentration.
Scattering incense and making vows,
Accumulating merit in the billions.
Believe and accept the Great Vehicle Dharma,
Mindful of the Dao, casting off attachments.
Roaming the spirit through the empty vastness,
Ten thousand vows without obstruction.
Since I attained the immortal Dao,
Countless kalpas have passed.
Ever expounding the Dharma to teach,
All the myriad beings.
Mindful of entering the mysterious true path,
Divine methods surpassing your form.
Refining the body with the art of enduring vision,
Abiding in spirit in the Upper Clarity.
I ever dwell here,
Wisdom and power in harmony.
Diligently ascending the Great Veil,
Roaming and delighting in the Jade Capital.
All immortals are my companions,
Spirit and soul attain ease and glory."*

Alas, all sentient beings,
Sunk deep in suffering and affliction.
Thus I do not manifest this body,
That they may contemplate the wondrous Dao.
For in their hearts they yearn and long,
I expound for them the Numinous Treasure.
Ascending in spirit to the Jade Capital,
Its palaces most rare and fine.
When kalpas end, fire and water sweep,
That land follows its course in vastness.
Jade groves gleam with blossoming fruit,
Dharma pools where one may bathe and refine.
Abiding in non-action, the Cavern of Non-action,
No need to eat, yet fully sated.
Enjoying life without end,
Fulfilling the vow to guard the Three Treasures.
Pity these sentient beings,
Whose evil karma is the cause and condition.
For ten thousand kalpas they suffer in anguish,
Never hearing the Numinous Treasure scriptures.
The wise cultivate merit and virtue,
Gentle and harmonious, their nature firm and steadfast.
Seeking the place of the Dao’s arising,
Conceived and born within the lotus blossom.
Dharma sounds awaken ear and eye,
All hosts and all devas together.
Ascending as immortals, their lives boundless,
The virtuous should turn to the worthy.
Through long-cultivated karma they attain this,
Breaking through demonic forces, uprooting defilement.
Their lifespan spans countless kalpas,
Their nature striving for long life.
All afflictions utterly extinguished,
Swiftly they become the Supreme Perfected.

The Heavenly Worthy says: This Great Vehicle sutra
Is most profound and mysterious.
Those of shallow understanding,
Bewildered, cannot comprehend it.
Other lesser immortals,
Believing the words of the Dao, follow this sutra,
Yet it is not their own wisdom.
Those filled with anger, arrogance, sloth, and indolence,
Should not believe this sutra.
Ordinary beings of shallow understanding,
Deeply attached to the five desires,
Hearing it, cannot grasp its meaning—
Do not teach it to them.
If there are those who do not believe this sutra,
Yet hear of others receiving, upholding, offering, and observing fasts,
Reading and reciting it, and then slander it,
Despising, envying, and harboring resentment,
The sin of such a person is most grave and heavy.
When their life ends, they fall into hell,
Passing through countless kalpas,
Enduring great and bitter suffering.
Emerging from hell, they yet fall among beasts,
Assuming leaky forms—scabies, leprosy,
Myriad poisonous sores—all borne upon their bodies.
Though they may be said to live, their suffering is extreme.
For slandering this sutra, such is the retribution they incur.
If such a sinner is later reborn among humans,
Their faculties dull and dim,
Lame, crippled, hunchbacked, or bent,
Blind, deaf, or stooped.
Whatever they say, none will believe,
Their breath ever foul, possessed by ghosts and spirits.
Poor, lowly, and servile,
Used by others, sickly and emaciated.
Lacking clothing,
Though they cling to others, none regard them.
If they gain anything, it soon vanishes.
Should they practice medicine, following prescriptions to treat illness,
They only worsen the ailments, or even cause death.
If they themselves fall ill, none will heal them,
And though they take fine medicines, their condition only worsens.
Rebellious, they fall prey to bandits,
Repeatedly suffering calamity.
Such sinners will never
Behold the assembly of sacred divine kings expounding the wondrous sutras.
Only those who uphold precepts and maintain purity,
Who yearn for the Dao with earnest hearts,
Aspiring to the Great Vehicle—
Only such people may be taught the Numinous Treasure’s wondrous sutra.

The Dao Lord bows his head and asks the Heavenly Worthy:
In this latter age, if there are good men and good women
Who hear this Numinous Treasure sutra,
And according to their wishes, offer gold and treasures in faith,
Or go to listen to it,
How much merit will they gain?

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy tells the Dao Lord:
In this latter age, if there are faithful Daoists or other wise ones,
Regardless of age, who suddenly hear this sutra,
And can receive, uphold, and savor its teachings for good,
Expounding its matters in places of merit and virtue,
And those who hear it then generate faith,
Their merit is most great.
It is like a wealthy householder,
Who, moved by great vows, distributes treasures to aid the needy,
And with the Dao’s methods teaches and guides sentient beings,
Enabling them to become lesser immortals,
Soaring over the Five Peaks.
Is their merit not vast?

The Dao Lord bows his head and says: It is vast.

The Heavenly Worthy says: That person merely distributes treasures to aid sentient beings—
Their merit is already immeasurable.
How much more so if they teach them divine methods,
Enabling them to ascend as immortals.
Though this merit is weighty,
It does not compare to hearing this Numinous Treasure sutra with joy—
That merit is far greater, surpassing the benefactor’s,
Beyond calculation or analogy.
Yet this person’s deeds are few,
Yet they gain such merit—
How much more so for those who offer and receive it with devotion.
If there are those at the place of Dharma exposition,
Or those who have entered the fast,
And tell their friends:
“There is this Numinous Treasure’s venerable sutra,
Its words profound and wondrous—
Let us go together to listen and receive it.”
The merit of such a person,
In their next life, will attain the path of the Great Vehicle,
Sharp in wisdom and insight,
For a hundred thousand kalpas never mute or dumb.
Their breath not foul, their tongue never first to ail,
Nor their mouth diseased.
Their teeth not filthy or black,
Not yellow or sparse, nor missing or fallen.
Their lips not drooping or shriveled,
Their mouth not crooked, thick, or large,
Nor dark and sallow, with no repulsive traits.
Their nose not flat or sunken,
Nor crooked or bent.
Their complexion not dark or twisted,
Without any unpleasing features.
Lips, tongue, and teeth all refined and fine,
Nose high and straight,
Face full and round,
Eyebrows high and long,
Forehead broad and level—
Possessing all the marks of a noble person.
In life after life, they will always encounter good fortune,
And meet with the sutras and teachings.
To encourage others to listen brings such merit—
How much more so for those who wholeheartedly observe the fast,
Receive, read, and recite it?
Their merit is boundless, beyond conception.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke in verse:

If one, during the fast,
Hears the sound of this sutra,
That person’s merit is weighty,
Gaining blessings profound and deep.
Like a great benefactor,
Providing for countless guests,
And further expounding the Dharma,
Guiding them to enter immortality—
Fleeting as a bubble on water,
Swiftly they awaken the mind of weariness and renunciation.
Attaining the rank of Perfected One,
Mastering the Three Clarities and the Six Spirits.
Yet it does not compare to a single line of this sutra,
Teaching and transforming those of the same Dharma.

This person’s blessings run deep and thick,
Their merit beyond all reckoning.
They attain a body complete in marks,
Lofty as the noble saintly guests.
Their breath holds no foulness or decay,
But exhales fragrant smoke with every breath.
In later lives among gods and humans,
They dwell in palaces adorned with rare treasures.
Exhorting others to sit and hear the sutra,
The true Dao remains ever their neighbor.
How much more for those who receive and uphold it—
Their blessings defy all description.

Suppose there were one who,
With a kingdom’s cities, wives and children,
And boundless treasures of rare goods,
Made offerings of them all—
The merit gained by such a person
Would not equal that of one who receives and upholds
This sacred scripture of the Numinous Treasure,
Whose blessings are the greatest of all.

Just as among all flowing rivers and streams,
The sea stands first,
So too this sutra,
Among all sutras, is supreme.

Just as among all the stars,
The moon stands first,
So too this sutra,
Among the billions of sutras and teachings,
Shines most brightly.

Just as the radiant sun
Dispels all darkness,
So too this sutra
Shatters all the darkness of unwholesomeness.

Just as among all lesser kings,
The sagely emperor is first,
So too this sutra,
Among all sutras, is most exalted.

Just as the Great Brahmā Deva King
Is father to all beings,
So too this sutra
Is father to all the worthy sages and immortals.

This sutra can save all beings,
Freeing them from every suffering and affliction.
This sutra can greatly benefit all beings,
Fulfilling all their aspirations.

Like a cool, clear pool
That slakes the thirst of all who drink,
Like fire for one who is cold,
Like clothing for one who is naked,
Like a mother for her child,
Like a ship for one who must cross,
Like a physician for the sick,
Like a lamp for one in darkness,
Like treasure for the poor—
So too this Great Vehicle sutra
Can liberate all beings
From every suffering and the bonds of birth and death.

If one carries gold and treasures
To receive, uphold, and make offerings to it,
Or if one merely hears it,
The merit of such a person
Cannot be reckoned even by the saintly spirit-kings
Or the kings of the heavenly emperors.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Lord of the Dao, saying:
“Beings are pitiable,
Ensnared in suffering and affliction—
How deeply sorrowful!
For this reason, I earnestly expound this sutra again.
You must diligently and widely proclaim it,
To deliver and save all beings.”

The Lord of the Dao bowed his head,
Reverently receiving the command.

At that time, all those gathered in the assembly
Awakened the mind of the natural, true, and correct Dao.
The fourfold assembly of spirit-kings bowed in homage and withdrew.

Thus concludes the *Supreme Great Vehicle Essential Teachings Wondrous Sutra*.
