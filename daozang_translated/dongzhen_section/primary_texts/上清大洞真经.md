The Twenty-Third Patriarch of Mount Mao’s Shangqing Lineage, Master Guanmiao Zhu Ziying, presents *The Supreme Purity Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Purity Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*
**Full Title:** *The Supreme Purity Great Cavern Perfection Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters*

Tradition holds that in the third year of the Xingning reign of the Eastern Jin (365 CE), the Shangqing Immortals, led by Lady Wei, descended to transmit this scripture to the Daoist Yang Xi, making it the foundational text of the Shangqing lineage. The original comprised a single scroll. The extant version, preserved in the Mao Mountain lineage’s altar edition, spans six scrolls. It was collated by the Southern Song Shangqing Patriarch Jiang Zongying and finalized by the early Ming Zhengyi Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu.

*Preface to the Supreme Purity Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*

Master Zhu Ziying of the Twenty-Third Generation of Maoshan Shangqing Lineage, the Master Who Contemplates the Wondrous, states:

The Dao arises from Non-Being, abiding in the hidden numinous yet unfathomable;
The spirit congeals in Emptiness, wondrously transforming the myriad changes without fixed form.
In the profound obscurity, essence abides, and in supreme tranquility, radiance emerges;
In the boundless Great Mystery, one attains Emptiness and preserves Stillness—
This is called the *Great Cavern*.

When essence is gathered and spirit is concentrated, one rides the primordial qi in cyclic rotation;
When spirit is refined and the Dao is realized, auspicious winds are set in motion and dance.
From Non-Being, Being suddenly arises, and through breath, the myriad spirits’ forms disperse;
When movement reaches its extreme, stillness returns, and in the indistinct, the wondrous unity of the Imperial One is encircled—
This is called the *Cyclic Wind Unified*.

It is the root of universal propagation for Heaven and Earth, the origin of creation for emperors and sages.
Humans are born, receiving qi from the Supreme Ultimate, their movement and stillness patterned after Heaven and Earth;
They originate in the One Primordial, their opening and closing embodying Yin and Yang.
Thus, the Thirty-Nine August Lords of Shangqing reflect their true forms downward, entering the thirty-nine portals within the adept’s body.
Each portal, according to its corresponding passage, bears one chapter of the scripture.
Its words are profound and abstruse, serving to command the hundred spirits, summon the true, and repel the false—
What is called "auspicious clouds open the Gate of Life, and propitious mists seal the Portal of Death" refers to this.

Therefore, the Central Yellow Elder of the Primordial Essence Dao Lord synthesized the esoteric intentions of the host of sages and compiled the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, hence its name: *The Thirty-Nine Chapters Scripture*.
Additionally, there are the *Cyclic Wind Imperial One*, the *Lofty Primordial Mighty One*, and the *Five Elders Feminine One*—these three scriptures serve to supplement the venerable *Thirty-Nine Chapters*.

The Dao possesses three marvels:
The first marvel is the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters*;
The second marvel is the *Precious Scripture of the Five Elders Feminine One*;
The third marvel is the *Wondrous Scripture of the Vast and Subtle Primordial Numinosity*.

Thus, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters* is the esoteric formula of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Supreme Primordial Lord, inscribed in golden characters.
It is also called the *Dragon Script of the Three Heavens* and the *True Dao Scripture of the Nine Heavens*.
This scripture was composed by the Primordial Heavenly King, who circulated qi across the ten directions of the Mysterious Subtle.
The Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Heavenly King and, together, they inscribed it in the Northern Primordial Heaven, in the Land of Luyena, upon the Spirit Mirror Mountain of the Bird-Men, within the Grotto of Shelai.
In a chamber of Emptiness, they gathered the qi of the Ninefold Mysterious Unity, coalescing it into a book. The characters measured a *zhang* in height, and it remains preserved to this day.
The Primordial Heavenly King further transmitted it to the Central Yellow Elder of the Eight Perfected of Shangqing, instructing him to teach it to those below who would become true persons and ascend to the Three Luminaries.

This scripture was concealed and guarded by the Central Yellow Elder, unknown to the world. Thus, in the mortal realm, upon the Five Sacred Peaks and within the celestial precincts of Heaven, it has never been present.
The Perfected of the Shangqing Heaven treasure and secrete it; only in the Great Mystery are there golden pavilions and jade tablets, purple slips and cinnabar records.
In the Three Origins, there are the *Secret Registers of the Conjoined Dawn*; in the Cinnabar Terrace, the yellow characters of the scripture.
Only those destined to become true persons may receive it.

This scripture is the banner of the Dao of the Supreme August, the wondrous text of the Purple Dawn.
It governs the ranks of the Nine Heavens, summons the numinous powers of the Five Emperors,
Unifies the *Cyclic Wind* in its primordial harmony, coagulates the ninefold transmutations in mysterious essence,
Conjoins the feminine and masculine, unites the myriad spirits,
Arrayed in profound solemnity, resonating with the jade tones of the Great Perfected.
It dispels the false in the Luminous Beam, communicates the mutable in the Mysterious Gate,
Penetrates virtue to attain the wondrous, washes radiance to illumine the clouds.
The Great Han becomes the qi of the Numinous Pass; the Boundless becomes the years of the Vast Kalpa.
Majestic are the spirit halls, the abyss of the myriad Perfected;
Resplendent the golden chambers, flourishing in the Shangqing Heaven.

Its purport is subtle and profound, difficult to exhaust in detail.
If the adept can maintain long-term purification, severing worldly attachments,
Recite the jade chapters in the secluded chamber, and invoke the jade tones to stir the numinous,
Then the true person’s register will be established in the Eastern Florescence,
The Seven Mysteries will be further refined in the Purple Chamber,
The Demon Kings will be subdued by numinous might,
The Five Emperors will be harnessed to guard the body.
After ten thousand recitations, the fleshly body will ascend;
After seven invocations, the Controller of Destiny will arrive.
These are the marvelous chapters of the *Great Cavern*, which gather the myriad Dao to return to life.
Without extraordinary feathers or anomalous forms, without golden bones or jade names,
None may rashly peruse the numinous text—its prohibitions strictly follow the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*.

The adept must undergo three years of arduous purification before being permitted to read it.
Upon completing ten thousand recitations of these chapters, the Central Yellow Elder Dao Lord will memorialize above,
And the Supreme Lord will command the cinnabar-gale chariot with its green canopy,
While the Nine Numinous Envoys and the Controller of Destiny of the Great Unity come to welcome the adept.
Thus, the Five Elders will flank the carriage, the Eight Winds will fan their feathers,
Divine thunder will lead the way, jade splendor will support the wheels.
Riding clouds and driving dragons, the adept will ascend to Heaven that very day,
Proceeding to the palace of the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Simplicity to receive the scripture.
This is called ascending to the Shangqing Heaven, receiving the scripture in the Supreme Ultimate,
And being appointed as the Left Minister of the Lofty Immortals.

If the adept merely possesses this scripture but does not recite it,
The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity will strike the adept’s name from the Register of Death.
At the outset of scripture transmission, the true register is established;
At the beginning of the purification rite, the Supreme Ultimate is invoked to inscribe the name in the Eastern Florescence.
A memorial is presented to the Supreme Lord, and the name is recorded in the Tortoise Terrace.
The myriad spirits and thousand numina will then address the adept as the *Grand Master of the Nine Mysteries*,
Ranking equivalent to the *Immortal Earl of the Supreme Purity*.

The protocols for receiving the scripture strictly adhere to the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*; the adept should comply accordingly.

**Postface**
The *Book of Changes* states: "Great indeed is the Primal Qi of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it."
It further states: "The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each attaining its proper nature and destiny. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony, only then is there benefit and correctness."
The earlier scholars explained: "What is called *yuan*? It is that which cannot be spoken—perhaps the state before Yin and Yang took form."
What Heaven bestows is *ming* (destiny); what beings receive is *xing* (nature).
Nature and destiny are wondrous; only by preserving and uniting the Great Harmony can there be benefit and correctness.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* fundamentally concerns the return to the origin and the restoration of destiny.
Those who discuss it in the world all say: "The Dao is wondrous in Emptiness and Non-Being; the spirit is hidden in the sudden arising of Being."

Before heaven and earth existed, this Dao already was. The disciples of the Mo and Si schools spoke of Confucius, saying: "His nature and the Dao of Heaven—these could not be heard." Yet this Dao is none other than the wondrous subtlety of "only the refined, only the unified," transmitted heart-to-heart by the Three Sages—Yao, Shun, and Yu—each in unbroken accord, never for an instant apart. By the Spring and Autumn period, as the age declined and customs decayed, it was regarded as something loftily impracticable, leaving people at a loss, and so the Master seldom spoke of it. Yet when Yanzi sat in forgetfulness and Zengzi responded with singular devotion, did they hear anything different? The purport of this scripture is to preserve the heart and nurture nature in serving Heaven, to gather essence and unite spirit in harmonizing with the Dao—entirely consistent with the Master’s teaching that "when you grasp it, it remains; when you release it, it vanishes."

Since the Yellow and Lao Lords of the Central Realm withdrew into seclusion, the world has known nothing of this. Thus, among the earthly realms of humanity and the five sacred mountains, this scripture has vanished forever. Later generations, never hearing of the Great Dao, have abandoned themselves to the sea of desires, drowning their aspirations in the dusty waves. How pitiable are those who would preserve the Great Harmony and rectify nature and destiny!

At the Shangqing Ancestral Altar of Mount Mao, transmission has spanned over a thousand years, yet only thirty-eight individuals have received it. For it reveals the hidden truths of heaven and earth before form arose and dissects the mysteries of the union of father and mother’s essences—thus it must remain concealed, never lightly or carelessly passed on.

In the second lunar month of the Xianchun reign, the Perfected Master of Jade Ocean’s Profound Mystery visited Jiuhua Mountain. While visiting a Daoist chamber, he spoke of this matter, and few were those who heard. Fearing its imminent extinction, he wished to broaden its transmission. I, Gongduan, bound by the green threads of three lifetimes’ karmic practice, received the Master’s instruction and, overwhelmed with gratitude, commissioned this carving in wood to fulfill his intent, sharing it with scholars across the world. May those who treasure this text, pledging their hearts before Heaven in transmission, vow to practice it and thus flourish this Dao.

On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the ren-shen year of the Xianchun reign, the Dharma-heir Cheng Gongduan reverently inscribed this with burning incense.

What is bestowed upon beings as nature and destiny is at once vast and minute, light and weighty, boundless in its presence and absence—yet never apart from the Dao, all may be seen and sought. Thus, one who attains the self becomes enlightened, then knows that heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are but a single entity. That which is empty, numinous, and wondrous—do I not possess it? Since I possess it, it may be seen and sought. Why should it not share the same endowment as the vast and minute, the light and weighty, without ever being obscured?

What is called a *scripture* of the Dao arises from the sound of celestial truth, the text of the Three Qi. None but the Perfected Immortals of the Supreme Emperor expound it before transmitting it to the world below. Its sound is heard in the absence of sound; its text takes form in the absence of form. It divides at the beginning of the primordial chaos, yet its unfolding and nurturing manifestations may be heard and perceived—hence it is called a *scripture*.

To unlock the treasury within oneself, to expound the scripture within oneself, to reveal its most profound truths and dispel the obstructions of the benighted—is it not that every being possesses this scripture? The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* comprises thirty-nine chapters, all concerning the principles of refinement. Those who practice it to completion—such as Wei, Yang, Guo, and Xu—attest to this.

Some ascend to the lofty void, some penetrate to luminous clarity; some are meticulous in ritual observance, some nourish themselves through ingestion—each method has its similarities and differences, and none may be casually pursued. For the path of refinement must be rooted in nurturing qi and preserving spirit. Only after dispelling external distractions and dissolving thoughts does qi congeal and spirit transform. When all things and concerns are severed, and not even a hair’s breadth of obstruction remains, one returns to the primordial chaos. Thus, hunger and thirst vanish, birth and extinction cease. One roams with the clouds drifting through the sky, coming and going without limit.

When such scriptures circulate in the world, those of reverent virtue must consider broadening their transmission. At its core, the intention to preserve goodness is one and the same.

The Daoist Xiong Changyi of Min, who has sought the Dao for years, sponsored the carving of this scripture and requested a preface. Alas! Many know the scripture as the Dao and follow it, yet few truly practice its Way. The teachings established by the Most High extend their grace to all creatures, enduring through countless generations without cease—such is their origin. How many can truly believe in themselves and diligently cultivate it? Those who believe and cultivate—what hinders them from attaining the scripture? How much more does it transcend the bounds of existence and non-existence, its numinous wonders far exceeding what the scripture alone conveys!

Holders of this scripture should take heed of these words.

The Orthodox Unity Dharma-heir, Illuminator of the Dao’s Radiance, Perfected Zhang Yu Chu, Forty-Third Celestial Master and Overseer of Daoist Affairs, respectfully inscribed this.

Maoshan Supreme Clarity Thirty-Eighth Patriarch Master Jiang Zongying collated and annotated.

**Jade Formula for Reciting the Scripture**

The formula states: First, outside the chamber, hold a tablet before the heart, face forward with eyes closed, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the chamber filled with purple cloud-qi, dense and swirling, crowning and enveloping the body. Envision jade lads and jade maidens attending the scripture on left and right, while the Three Lights and precious mushrooms illumine the chamber with radiance. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth three times and recite the Entering-the-Chamber Incantation:

*"The heavens are bright, the qi is clear,
The Three Lights illumine the cavern’s splendor.
Golden chambers and jade halls,
Five mushrooms bloom as treasures.
Mystic clouds and purple canopies
Come to adorn my form.
Immortal lads and jade maidens
Bestow their numinous power upon me.
The Nine Qi ascend in harmony,
The Three Lights unite as one.
Mounting the purple canopy,
I ascend to the imperial court."*

Having recited this, step forward with the right foot to enter the chamber. Pinch the incense three times, knock the teeth three times, and pray:

*"Jade radiance scatters its light,
The Nine Qi bear fragrant mist.
Clouds of incense weave a dense net,
Piercing straight to the Nine Heavens.
The incense-attending golden lad
And the message-bearing jade maiden
Convey my words to the imperial presence,
Granting me long life,
That I may become a transcendent for all generations,
Every wish fulfilled as spoken."*

**Diagram of Visualization for Entering the Chamber and Reciting the Scripture**

After completing the visualization, next recite the Mystic Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture:

*"Subtle is the gate of the Mystic Origin,
Resplendent and bright, it pervades empty sameness.
The Supreme Dao arises from stillness and silence—
Then shall you behold the Three Pure Palaces.
The Great Dao is perfected here,
Riding the clouds and spurring the dragon.
Transcendents attend the scripture on left and right,
Jade maidens and jade lads.
My body is saved by the elixir of deathlessness,
Loosening the nets to follow the numinous wind.
Seven ancestors return to womb-life,
Becoming the lineage of divine transcendents for all generations."*

Having recited this, face north and knock the teeth thirty-six times. Close the eyes in inner vision, bow the head, and pray:

*"I, the humble mortal so-and-so, born a man of this dusty world, now offer these humble words to the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Sovereign of the Numinous Origin. Having entered the retreat chamber to recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I humbly pray that demonic trials be dispelled, ghostly afflictions and illnesses averted, and that my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and blessings be born."*

Next, pray:

*"Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens,
Bound by the desolate void’s restraints,
White-clawed apes and crimson-scaled poisonous dragons,
Guard the four directions,
Safeguarding the ninefold layers.
White eagles cry aloft,
Unsheathing their talons and shaking their manes.
All hidden spirits vanish,
Evil is destroyed and demons shattered.
When the Heavenly Soldiers rage,
The Five Peaks tremble.
Wind and fire launch their campaign,
The Nine Heavens open their court."*

Having recited this, face north and bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel with eyes closed, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and declare:

*"I, the humble mortal so-and-so, born a man of this dusty world, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Most High and Sagely Vast Realized One, the Supreme Dao Lord. Having entered the oratory to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I refine my spirit and guard my essence, beseeching the flowering of my destiny’s splendor. May I rise bodily upon the void to bow before the imperial court, and may my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved, ascending to the Hall of Blessings."*

Having recited this, bow four times again, then kneel and declare:

*"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Central Yellow Elder of Primordial Simplicity, Sovereign of the Dao. Having entered the chamber to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I pray that within my oratory, mushroom blossoms may spontaneously arise, jade radiance and precious luminosity illumine the chamber, and the Three Lights shine with clarity. May I ascend to the Supreme Clarity and unite with the imperial numen, that my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and I attain long life."*

Having recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

*"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Marshal of the Hosts of Transcendents, the Long-Life Dharma Master, the Three Heavenly Lords, and Perfected One Wang Baicheng."*

Having recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

*"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Ancestral Master who bestowed the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the Perfected Sagely Mother, Primordial Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity, Lady Wang."*

Having recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

*"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Master who bestowed the *Great Cyclic Harmony of the Returning Wind*, the Perfected Sagely Mother, Primordial Sovereign of the Central Candidate, Lady Wang. Having entered the chamber to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I humbly pray for the harmonization of my three hun-souls and the refinement of my seven po-souls, the sinking of corpse-worms, the radiance of my viscera and bowels, the prevention of all illness, the elimination of calamities, the return of my complexion to that of an infant, and my ascent in broad daylight. May my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and they ascend to the Hall of Blessings."*

Having recited this, face east and bow four times, burn incense, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Six Gates of the Eastern Florescence, governing the Eastern Mound Mountain, encircling three thousand *li*. Within the gates stand the Three Offices, arrayed in perfect order.

The First Palace is the Azure Palace of the Square Reservoir, governed by the Azure Lad, the High Minister.
The Second Palace is the Azure Palace of Jade Preservation, governed by the High Minister, Great Marshal of the Hosts, and Perfected Master Gao Chen.
The Third Palace is the Azure Palace of Jade Florescence, governed by the Little Lad of Azure Florescence of the Eastern Sea.

Next, visualize and recite the names of the Six Gates and their gatekeepers:

The Eastern Azure Florescence Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Qiu Boyuan.
The Southern Spirit Florescence Jade Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wang Zusi.
The Western Jade Cavern Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Yu Shangjie.
The Northern Jade Yin Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Shi Shaohua.
The Southeastern Heavenly Pass Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wen Wuche.
The Northeastern Cold Water Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Tong Lindu.

Next, knock the teeth three times and pray facing upward:

*"Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Dawn,
Three Palaces and Six Gates,
Record my jade name,
Send down my spirit-transcendents.
Dragon skirts and feathered regalia
Adorn my body.
As I recite the cavern’s chapters,
May they resound through the Nine Heavens.
Ascending to the Jade Clarity,
I submit my writ to the Eastern Florescence.
My name is carved on golden tablets,
That I may long be an imperial guest."*

Having recited this, swallow the qi nine times, face east, burn incense, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

*"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Ninefold Subtlety, the Great Perfected Jade Preserver King, the Golden Watchtower’s High Minister and Great Controller of Destinies, Perfected Master Gao Chen, and the Great Lord of the Eastern Sea’s Jade Clarity and Azure Florescence, the Little Lad."*

Having recited this, burn incense again, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

With utmost sincerity, I, so-and-so, reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Great Non-Being, the Eastern Aurora’s Fusang Vermilion Grove Great Emperor, and the Supreme Dao Lord.

Having recited this, burn incense again, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:

With utmost sincerity, I, so-and-so, reverently address the Ancestral Master, the Southern Culmen’s Purple Perfected Supreme Clarity Dao Lord; the Grand Tenuity’s Jade Clarity Sagely Empress; the Golden Watchtower’s High Preserver, Eastern Florescence Dao Lord; and the Golden Watchtower’s Grand Master, Supreme Clarity Immortal Marquis. Now entering the chamber, I recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*. May the dawn’s radiance shine forth, illuminating my body; may my viscera and organs flourish; may calamities and misfortunes dissipate; may my seven ancestors return to the womb and together ascend the cloud chariot.

Having recited this, burn incense again, bow in reverence before the scripture, and gently knock the teeth fourteen times, then pray:

Supreme Unity Emperor Lord,
Imperial Unity Mysterious Scripture,
Five Numinous Ones scatter their effulgence,
Dense and penetrating through the Three Clarities.
Jade lads and jade maidens,
Burn incense and attend the numinous.
May my highest aspirations be declared,
That I may merge my form with theirs,
Becoming an immortal,
And long enjoy felicity and purity.

Having recited this, knock the teeth fourteen times again, then softly recite the *Casket-Opening Incantation*:

Jade Emperor’s supreme dharma,
Ascends to the Three Clarities.
On this auspicious day of purification,
I dare open the divine scripture.
Ten thousand trials concealed,
All shall succeed as I direct.
Jade lads stand guard,
Jade maidens scatter fragrance.
Voices numbering five hundred million,
Resound through the ten thousand numina.
Supreme report to the Three Origins,
Grant me long life eternal.

Having recited this, knock the teeth twenty times, then bow in reverence again. Next, offer three pinches of upper-grade incense, ascend the seat, sit upright, face north, knock the teeth thirty-two times, swallow saliva thirty-two times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Imperial Unity Honored Lord.

Next, envision the disciple’s head as true azure, like jasper; the two shoulders as cinnabar; the two feet as snow. Clad in a nine-colored feathered robe, draped with a dragon-patterned mantle, crowned with a Jade Clarity coronet, holding a nine-colored staff. A green dragon attends to the left, a white tiger guards the right; a canopy of blossoms shades the head, and below sits a lion. Immortal lads attend with incense, jade maidens scatter flowers. Purple clouds billow thickly, filling the chamber; five-colored mystic yellows array before and behind, clearly distinct, all brightly illumined.

Having completed this, knock the teeth thirty-six times, then softly recite the *Three Heavens Demon-Quelling Incantation*:

Northern Emperor, Great Demon King,
Before the Emperor Lord you serve.
Ghosts of the Yellow Springs’ bends,
Four Luminaries, Fengdu’s peaks.
A thousand demons blend their forms,
Nine heads share one body.
Divine tigers spew their venom,
Severed by thunder’s might.
Divine efficacy utters the curse,
None slain shall be spared.
Grand Tenuity’s command,
Subdues mountains and streams.
Clashing bells cast forth,
Flowing brilliance through the Nine Heavens.
Wind and fire launch their assault,
Divine blades arrayed tenfold.
Malevolent trials subdue and perish,
Ten thousand spirits beheaded and annihilated.
Dare any demonic toxin arise,
Sealed within the Three Passes.
Invoking the Cavern Dharma,
None shall disobey these words.

Having recited this, knock the teeth thirty-six times again, then recite the *Great Cavern Demon-Quelling Divine Wisdom Jade Clarity Hidden Writ*:

Mysterious effulgence scatters at heaven’s edge,
The clear Han thins as clouds retreat.
Wondrous qi illumines the Three Mornings,
Cinnabar clouds radiate the Purple Tenuity.
All heavens unfurl their numinous hues,
Streaming auroras, how they billow.
Divine lamps brighten the Long-Lived Star,
Nether webs emit their luminous glow.
Revolving peaks gird high clouds,
Suspended essence shades the eight directions.
Three Primes open the high void,
Orchid towers unfold their layered gates.
Golden walls reflect Jade Clarity,
Numinous splendor marks heaven’s precincts.
Winds arise in the Eight Convergence Palaces,
Fierce beasts gallop through the clouds.
In the Three Caverns’ bustling courts,
Perfected ones intermingle in profusion.
Above dwell the Dry-Light Essences,
Their dark virtue towering and majestic.
Great Unity gathers its plans,
Gripping the mandate, wielding the divine banner.
Orthodox Unity treads the flourishing numinous,
Summoning and commanding the ten thousand spirits to return.
The Duke’s son flanks the silent axle,
Cavern Yang guards the mysterious mechanism.
At dawn’s first light, harmonizing with the Dao’s peace,
The dragon chariot pauses in its circuit.
Seven luminaries align with the divine kings,
Whirlwind wheels traverse the myriad treetops.
Their forms soar above the Mystic Ford,
Flying steps transcend the mountain’s ladder.
Donning brocade, they enter the divine mounds,
Resplendent, their feathered robes flutter.
Darkly they traverse the cloudy assemblies,
Flying effulgences bear their divine efficacy.
Clear peaks without the slightest haze,
Wondrous unions arise in the void.
Golden splendor girds the numinous carriage,
Lofty immortals, how they soar.
Ten thousand reins scatter through the void,
Lush and misty, the Mystic Upper Window.
Within arises the Union-Light Lord,
Nine Emperors flourish the Supreme August.
Bright wheels reflect the Yellow Tranquility,
Feathered pearls gleam in the Mystic Yang.
Heavenly essence, primordial elemental qi,
The Central Five is called Nourishing Light.
Luminous coalescence gives birth to the gods,
Nine Perfected unite as pairs.
Wondrous effulgences reveal the dark reckoning,
Following resonance, they mark the divine traces.
Mud-Pill Palace’s Cavern-Origin Light,
The Moving Pearl governs the Crimson Palace.
Primal Yang commands the Gate of Life,
Three spirits accompany the Purple Lad.
Restraining and summoning, they return above,
Flanking the gates, attending the Luminous Window.
Dense and luxuriant, facing the Dawn Star,
Circular blossoms illumine the Three Peaks.
Square vessels guide and receive life,
Reversing age, returning to infancy.
Whirlwinds radiant, adorning the Nine Heavens,
Green axles encircle the cinnabar chambers.
Howling winds coil beyond the mists,
Descending in curves to the flowery hall.
Roaming and feasting, gazing across ten thousand kalpas,
Returning to assemble with the Divine Aurora King.
The immortal’s path delights in life,
The ghostly path delights in misfortune.
One hears only of the noble path of life,
Never of the ghostly path’s ascendancy.
Chants and songs intermingle with heaven’s qi,
The youth Jia sings the Primal Orthodox Chapter.
Divine wisdom commands the Vermilion Troops,
Five Emperors’ talismans chill the northern wastes.
Wielding banners, they capture the ten thousand demons,
Jade texts restrain Fengdu’s north.
Embodied dissolution is the natural Dao,
Demon-quelling is not your merit.
Floating effulgences beat the long fan,
Uniting the void, they celebrate the auroral peak.
Looking down upon the four flying Xie,
Heaven’s kalpas shall never end.
Within the wondrous, true effulgences arise,
The returning chariot lingers, reluctant to depart.
Intent harmonizes in dark resonance,
Lifting and guiding to the lofty heights.
Soaring wings await the wondrous assembly,
Cavern visions stir deeper sorrow.
Whistling and shouting in an instant,
Swiftly traversing the nine enclosures.
Gathering qi, returning to the primal exchange,
Merging effulgences in the dark and mysterious.
Thereupon, the Seven Stars halt their radiance,
The layered passes open wide.
A hundred yangs surge like lightning,
Five planets hasten in their course.
Grasping the staff, commanding the numinous,
All qi are summoned.
Iron bears array their nets,
Fierce tigers transform their might.
Six armies slay the demons,
Bronze-headed ones seize the deviant.
Heavenly macaques devour their poison,
Crystal shields shatter and crumble.
Ten thousand spirits annihilated,
The Six Heavens collapse and topple.
The Three Paths proceed rightly,
What qi would not return?
Mountains and rivers overturn,
Sun and moon veil their brilliance.
Numinous beasts plunge from the peaks,
Golden wings fall from flight.
Five Emperors gird their sashes in the divine precincts,
Ten thousand spirits receive their seals in the Grand Tenuity.
The Lofty One floats his canopy above the cinnabar cliffs,
The Eight...

The radiant chariot ascends to the gates of heaven,
Gazing through the cavernous depths to behold the wondrous transformations of the source,
Rejoicing in the Dao with an open heart.

When complete, close the eyes and silently recite, then bow in the four directions in the mind. Envision the self seated amidst five-colored clouds, with cloud-qi covering above the head, and settle the vision. Then take the seat, turn right to face east, empty the mind, and knock the teeth nine times. Silently recite the inner incantation of the Supreme Thearch’s plain words:

*"Vast Azure Origin, Lesser Yang Master,
Nine qi return to the liver, calming my hun-soul.
The hidden palace knots its blossoms,
The inner treasury shines with clarity.
Refining the countenance and fortifying the marrow,
Reverting white to green.
The divine transformation arises within,
Radiance ascends to the Purple Court.
Dare any transgress and test,
Be shattered by the flowing bells.
The Jade Register of the Thearch,
Name inscribed in the Grand Purity."*

When finished, draw in the azure qi of the green yang essence of the east with the mouth. First inhale through the nose, then draw fully through the throat with the mouth. The other four directions are the same. Then hold the qi for nine breaths, swallowing the qi nine times, allowing it to fill and spread through the liver’s viscera, coalescing into nine spirits. Clad in green robes and caps, their forms like Jupiter, they descend into the liver, seated face-to-face, exhaling in harmony with the seasons.

Then take the seat, raise the head to face south, close the eyes, and knock the teeth three times. Silently recite the inner incantation of the Heavenly Thearch’s plain words:

*"Crimson Court, Vermilion Palace,
Above dwell the lofty perfected.
Three qi return to the heart,
This is my mother-heart.
Lift my purified body,
Directly ascend to make it known.
Heart firm, spirit still,
Nine numina seal the gates.
Golden perfection shines within,
Purple mist knots into clouds.
The Jade Script of the Grand Tenuity,
Inscribes the name of the divine immortal.
Soaring to ascend the Grand Clarity,
To pay homage to the August Honored One."*

When finished, draw in the red qi of the cinnabar essence of the south with the mouth. Then hold the qi for three breaths, swallowing the saliva three times, allowing it to fill and spread through the heart’s viscera, coalescing into eight spirits. Clad in red robes and caps, their forms like Mars, they descend into the heart, seated face-to-face, exhaling in harmony with the seasons.

Then take the seat, turn left to face west, close the eyes, and knock the teeth seven times. Silently recite the inner incantation of the Supreme Prime of the Southern Culmen’s plain words:

*"Primal Simplicity, Cavernous Void,
Divine abode of the heavenly perfected.
Seven qi guard the lungs,
Dwelling with the spirit.
Preserving and refining the five viscera,
Blossoms enfolded within.
Limpid sincerity, luminous as stone,
Roaming and ascending the mysterious void.
Jade script, golden tablets,
True writ of the Nine Thearchs.
Let me soar as an immortal,
Death’s name already erased.
Roaming the Three Clarities,
Freely as the heart desires."*

When finished, draw in the white qi of the metal soul essence of the west with the mouth. Then hold the qi for seven breaths, swallowing the saliva seven times, allowing it to fill and spread through the lung’s viscera, coalescing into seven spirits. Clad in white robes and caps, their forms like Venus, they descend into the lungs, seated face-to-face, exhaling in harmony with the seasons.

Then take the seat, face directly north, close the eyes, and knock the teeth five times. Silently recite the inner incantation of the Later Sage Thearch’s plain words:

*"Mysterious Origin, Northern Culmen,
Mechanism of the Supreme.
Five qi guard the kidneys,
Tortoise and jade interlaced.
Precious blossoms knot the network,
The stomach’s tube shines clear.
Inscribed on the jade tablet,
Years equal to the Two Modes.
The Supreme August Thearch,
Stands firm, unwavering.
Commanding the Six Jias,
Summoning the Eight Might.
Riding dragons, driving the floating,
Transcending to ascend and soar.
Exhaling and inhaling divine mushrooms,
Enduring through kalpas without decline."*

When finished, draw in the black qi of the mysterious radiance essence of the north with the mouth. Then hold the qi for five breaths, swallowing the saliva five times, allowing it to fill and spread through the kidney’s viscera, coalescing into five spirits. Clad in black robes and caps, their forms like Mercury, they ascend into the Crimson Palace, three on the left and two on the right, entering the two bladder channels, piercing the *Weilü* cavity upward, filling the space between the two kidneys, seated face-to-face, exhaling in harmony with the seasons.

Then take the seat, face directly toward one’s own life-destiny, close the eyes, and knock the teeth twelve times. Silently recite the inner incantation of the Grand Tenuity Heavenly Thearch’s plain words:

*"Yellow Origin, Central Thearch,
Spirit of my life-destiny.
One qi attends the spleen,
Let me attain the true.
Precious treasury generates blossoms,
Knots the network of the Purple Dawn.
Transforming radiance, refining the countenance,
Preserving life and prolonging years.
Later things shall incline,
A thousand spirits come to serve.
The Dark Lord’s mysterious register,
Inscribes the name of the divine immortal.
Long life and enduring vision,
Abiding with heaven forever."*

When finished, draw in the yellow qi of the lofty august essence of the center with the mouth. Then hold the qi for one breath, swallowing the saliva twelve times, allowing it to fill and spread through the spleen’s viscera, coalescing into twelve spirits. Clad in yellow robes and imperial crowns, their forms like Saturn, they descend into the spleen, seated face-to-face, exhaling in harmony with the seasons.

When the qi of the five directions is fully stored, softly recite the incantation:

*"Five qi blend and arise,
Essence of the mysterious above.
Filling the five viscera,
The six palaces shine bright.
Inwardly irrigating, outwardly overflowing,
Within and without both purified.
Eradicating defilement, summoning the true,
I ascend to the Grand Numinous.
Ever facing the lofty dawn,
Reciting and chanting the Cavernous Scriptures."*

Then envision the left eye emitting the sun and the right eye emitting the moon, each nine inches in diameter, positioned above the two ears, called the "Lofty Window of the Six Harmonies." Settle the vision and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Mysterious Unity,
Nine August Ones exhale their essence.
Three, five, seven transformations,
Gaze through the cavernous depths.
Sun and moon hang their light,
Shining down into the divine court.
Flanking and illuminating the Six Harmonies,
The Yellow Tranquility of the Grand Unity.
The Thearch’s command tablet,
Golden script unshaken.
Five Elders bear the talisman,
Heaven and earth together complete.
Let me not die,
Attaining the true numina.
Repelling the myriad evils,
Calamities and harms extinguished.
Ascending to pay homage to the Heavenly Thearch,
Returning old to infancy.
The Supreme Thearch decrees,
All spirits heed."*

When finished, draw in the qi of the sun and moon with one breath, dividing it into twenty-seven swallows, coalescing into twenty-seven August Lords, all clad in purple robes and caps. The inner nine August Lords descend into the Crimson Palace, piercing the *Weilü* cavity, ascending into the *Niwan*. Another nine August Lords likewise descend, piercing the Crimson Palace, entering the lower barrier’s realm. Another nine August Lords enter the middle barrier’s realm. Let the sunlight illuminate the entire body, inwardly penetrating the *Niwan*, shining down upon the five viscera, and through the intestines and stomach, all perceiving its illumination within and without.

Let the entire body merge with the radiance of the sun and moon. After a long while, knock the teeth and exhale with the sound *xi*. Next, visualize the twenty-four stars, each one inch in size. This method may be practiced daily whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, as if in continuous union. Further visualize within each star a figure, so that the twenty-four stars contain twenty-four beings, all in the form of infants, naked and without garments or sashes. Then see the twenty-four stars descend from the void, circling the body three times.

When this is complete, recite the invocation:
*"Twenty-four Perfected, return to the Yellow Court,
Exhale yellow qi from your mouths.
Twenty-four stars, pour into my Gate of Life,
A hundred spirits receive numinous power,
Body filled, bones strengthened,
Hun and po at peace,
Five viscera sealed with talismanic signs,
Heaven and earth stand firm."*

Then draw in the qi of the twenty-four stars with a single breath, swallowing saliva twenty-four times. With each swallow, feel a star enter the mouth and pass directly to the navel, its radiance illuminating the entire abdomen, penetrating the five viscera. Next, visualize the starlight transforming into twenty-four Perfected Ones, each exhaling yellow qi like mist, filling the navel and suffusing the interior and exterior with a dense, luminous glow. After a long while, exhale with the sound *hu*, and bow thirty-nine times.

Then contemplate the thirty-nine portals of the body, each distinct and guarded by a divine spirit. Visualize the thirty-nine Lords descending their true qi to bathe the thirty-nine portals, swallowing saliva thirty-nine times. Next, shake the left hand three times, as if ringing a golden fire-bell; shake the right hand three times, as if casting the Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse. Tilt the head back and turn the neck nine times, as if bearing the heavens; stamp the foot once, as if treading the earth. Shake the body twice seven times to delight the myriad spirits. Wipe the eyes three times to brighten the Three Luminaries. Pinch the nose seven times to clear the Bridge of Light. Press the two points behind the eyebrows three times to block the source of evil. Rotate the ears three times to open the Heavenly Windows. Swallow saliva nine times to savor the Jade Pitchpipe.

When all these practices for guiding the entire body are complete and the myriad spirits rejoice, softly recite the charm:
*"Bearing heaven, treading earth,
Entering and exiting the Cavernous Gate,
Left hand ringing the flowing bell,
Right hand casting the Seven Origins,
Girded with gold, adorned with jade,
Immortal robes fluttering,
Eight Effulgences arrayed,
Driving the chariot upon clouds,
Ten thousand traversals luminously attained,
Soaring into the Imperial Dawn."*

Then sit upright and recite the scripture, visualizing the August Lord of the Supreme Unity facing you from the empty mystery, his mouth aligned with yours, listening to the recitation of the true scripture.

*Here ends the first scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*
*Here begins the second scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*

Master Jiang Zongying of the Thirty-Eighth Generation of Maoshan Supreme Clarity, Collator

**First Scripture of the August Lord of the Supreme Void**
**Chapter of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity**

Reverently invoke the Celestial Radiance Essence of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity, whose style is Meeting-the-Primordial Child, who ever guards the Gate of Dead Qi beneath the root of your tongue. His mouth exhales a crimson cloud that encircles your entire body, transforming and engendering blood and fluids, which ascend to congeal in the Muddy Pellet. When the Muddy Pellet is firm and luminous, the hundred spirits assume their proper positions.

With true contemplation, visualize the true qi of the Celestial Radiance Essence of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity, the hue of the crimson cloud, shrouding your crown. Silently recite the charm:

*"True qi flows downward to fill the Dark Pass,
Sealing the spirits, securing essence, blocking the source of death.
The Jade Scripture’s wisdom illumines the myriad spirits,
That for me they may summon true destiny and enduring life.
Deliver the seven ancestors to revert as womb-born immortals,
Tempering and refining the hundred spirits into wholeness of qi."*

Next, visualize the crimson qi entering from your Muddy Pellet. You then inhale the divine cloud through your mouth and swallow the saliva thrice, forming three spirits.

The first spirit resembles the Great General Tianpeng; the other two attend him. They descend to roam throughout your liver, then enter the Crimson Palace of the heart, ascending to fill the Mansion of Blood and Fluids beneath the root of the tongue. Exhale gently in accord with the rhythm of time.

Before reciting the Jade Scripture, first press the philtrum with your left hand, then proceed to recite.

The Jade Scripture of the Grand Cavern states:

*"Supreme Cavern of the Primordial,
Primordial engendering the Nine Heavens,
Qi-ancestor of the Great Nonbeing,
Hosts of winds in chaotic mystery.
Mystery once severed and scattered,
The Four Clarities pacify the tranquil.
The August Lord of the Supreme Unity of the Grand Cavern,
Titled Lord of the Upper Effulgence,
Links the multitudes, gathers the mists,
Eternally bound to the One Revolution.
Seven generations cast into tranquility,
Entrusting numen, attaching destiny,
Reverting to spontaneous splendor,
Dissolving into the flowing void.
The Six Luminaries sink and shift,
The August Lord of the Jade Terrace, named Radiant Banner,
The White August Lord of the Western Florescence, named Manifest Peace,
Both inscribed in the imperial registers,
All attain liberation at the source.
In the profound recesses of the Womb Field and the Talisman Field,
Where the jade orchid of the world blooms,
The numinous light of the Eight Effulgences
Intermingles to engender the myriad spirits."*

The Demon-Quelling Incantation of the Jade Sovereign of Jade Clarity states:

*"Heaven holds the great hidden treasure of the heart’s engendering,
Called the Luminous Beam above the heart’s qi, dispelling the non-smoke.
Guard my sealed pass beneath the Dark Boundary,
Beyond the Gate of Life in the Gate of the Kidneys’ Prison.
Then summon the Feathered Youth of the Nose-Spirit of Beneficent Primordial,
Arrayed in the Green Chamber at the balcony of the philtrum,
To unbind the hundred knots of the seven ancestors,
Following the wind to sever their roots,
Matching heaven in shifting their foundation,
Attaining transformation through entering the mystery."*

The Incantation of the Supreme Numinous Azure of the Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Sovereign states:

*"Primordial qi is fundamentally non-born,
The Five Paths and Five Phases bear the void to emerge.
Female and male, yin and yang, lodge in divine transformation,
The profound and dark forests of the abstruse,
The jade tone resounds in Grand Harmony.
Ten thousand chants arise from the midst of nothingness,
The immortal court revolves through nine transformations.
The hundred chaos merge into the One.
There is in the northwest a Heavenly Gate named Converging the Void Center,
All together they enter the imperial hall to assemble."*

Conclude by softly reciting the charm:

*"Inner tone of heaven,
Three Indigos arrayed, waves reach the terrace.
Outer tone of earth,
Heaven’s mandate endures, humanity ever tranquil."*

**Jade Talisman of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity for Demon-Quelling**

Method: Write in blue upon yellow silk and wear it. Visualize and invoke the inner taboo name of the Youth to guard beneath the root of your tongue, solidifying fluids and congealing spirit, severing and sealing the source of death.

Then knock the teeth nine times, and again swallow the saliva thrice.

*Here ends the second scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*
Master Jiang Zongying of the Thirty-Eighth Generation of Maoshan Supreme Clarity, Collator.

**Second Scripture of the Jade Void Lord of the Highest Sovereign**
**Chapter of the Venerable Supreme Unity**

Reverently invoke the Venerable Supreme Unity, styled *Wuyou Shou*, whose taboo name is *Guihuichang*. May he ever guard beneath the jade pillow of your occiput, shielding the gate of death-qi behind the mud-pill, that the qi of living truth may enter the mud-pill. Thus shall your seven generations of ancestors receive the mystery of rebirth, their names inscribed in the registers of the Jade Sovereign, and myriad blessings of renewal be bestowed.

Visualize the true qi of the Venerable Supreme Unity, *Wuyou Shou*, its hue that of purple clouds, veiling your crown. Silently recite the charm:

*"Supreme Unity preserves life,
Firms spirit and secures existence.
For me, summon on high
The qi of the imperial perfected.
Below, spread it through the courtyard of the Purple Chamber.
The Jade Scripture ascends, piercing the heavens;
Nine Mysteries shine bright,
Seven Ancestors rejoice together,
All ascend to Supreme Clarity."*

Next, visualize the purple qi entering your mud-pill. Inhale the divine cloud through your mouth, swallow the saliva thrice, and condense it into three spirits, each resembling the planet Jupiter, clad in purple robes and caps. They descend into the Crimson Palace, pass through the *Weilü* cavity, and surge upward to the rear gate of the mud-pill beneath the jade pillow.

The three spirits stand in unison, their divine eyes inwardly gazing upon the Purple Chamber. Exhale gently in accord with the rhythm of time. Recite the Jade Scripture.

The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states:

*"The Jade Sovereign wields the Dark Prime Banner,
Commanding the nine celestial terraces.
Those who attain the Dao through the Seven Awakenings inherit its numerology;
Jubilant, the divine wind returns,
The radiant chariot halts in the north beneath the Flourishing Canopy.
Purple Essence, Eastern Jade—chant the Three Powers!
Jade harmony resounds beyond the Nine Empyreans.
The Jade Talisman summons the Great Tenuity’s Mud-Pill Palace.
The Three Pure Spirits are named within the mud-pill,
Their effulgence golden, their splendor luminous.
Lord Lao firmly inscribes the names of the Three Pure Ones above,
Guarding the mechanism of death’s threshold."*

The Jade Sovereign of Great Harmony of Jade Clarity invokes:

*"As dawn’s first radiance arises,
Purple clouds illumine the Dark Slope.
Resplendent, the Round Light of the Cavern shines—Flourishing Sun!
Brilliant, it bathes in luminous glory—Lustrous Sun!
Subtle, the numinous radiance—Primal Sun!
Verdant, the azure expanse unfurls.
The Nine Heavens’ halls host jade guests;
Golden chambers sing the Empyrean hymn.
Virtuous indeed, facing the imperial guest—Left Immortal Zhongchengzi!
Commanding the Dark Chariot of Lord Bo,
Seven Ancestors dissolve the roots of the womb,
Generation upon generation, they become immortals."*

The Highest Sovereign of Divine Empyrean, Jade Clarity, invokes:

*"Cinnabar Sovereign wields the Pearl Spirit—name of power,
Guarding the Gate of Death.
Above, the Crimson Child,
Dark Sovereign congeals the heavens—Celestial Lord of Heaven,
Also named *Bowushang*,
Also called *First of the Three Primes*.
Support and nurture my form,
That I may ascend the cloud-wheel,
Ever seated in the Supreme Clarity Pavilion,
Seven Mysteries become immortal lords."*

Conclude by softly reciting the charm:

*"Inner tone of heaven,
Pearl and Indigo arrayed, waves reach the Numinous Capital.
Outer tone of earth,
Body endures long, harm departs."*

**Jade Talisman of the Jade Sovereign of the Great Cavern for Demon-Quelling**

Method: Write in vermilion upon yellow silk and wear it. Visualize and invoke the inner taboo name of the Sovereign to guard beyond your Purple Chamber, calming the spirit in the Purple Chamber, harmonizing the true numen, sealing the apertures of death, and eternally preserving the Flourishing Canopy.

Then knock the teeth nine times, and again swallow the saliva thrice.

*Here ends the second scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*
Master Jiang Zongying of the Thirty-Eighth Generation of Maoshan Supreme Clarity, Collator.

**Third Scripture of the August Jade Sovereign, Chapter of the Jade Sovereign**

Reverently invoke the Sovereign: *Jiang Lingfan*, styled *Lǚchānglíng*, who ever guards between the adept’s brows, beyond the Purple Chamber at the gate of the qi of death. Let the Flourishing Canopy enter between the brows, ascend to the Purple Chamber, and may the seven generations of parents have their sins dissolved and blessings born, ascending to the Sovereign’s palace.

With true contemplation, visualize the Sovereign *Jiang Lingfan*’s true qi, the color of purple clouds, veiling the crown. Silently recite the charm:

*"The Sovereign bestows the register of talismans,
The upright qi summons the ten thousand spirits.
Above, it calls the Jade Perfected qi,
Filling and spreading between the brows.
Merging as one, it engenders the Sovereign’s radiance,
The Three Primes complete my immortality.
Swift and resplendent, I ride the soaring canopy,
Directly ascending to the lofty celestial terrace."*

Next, visualize the purple qi entering from the adept’s *Niwan* (Mud-Pill Palace). The adept then inhales the divine clouds through the mouth, swallows the saliva nine times, and forms nine spirits: one spirit in red ceremonial robes and crown, four spirits on the left in blue-green robes and caps, and four spirits on the right in white robes and caps. They descend into the Crimson Palace, passing through the two bladder meridians and the *Weilü* (Tailbone) point, surging upward to the *Niwan* and beyond the Purple Chamber between the brows. Exhale gently in accord with the breath.

Recite the *Jade Scripture*. The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states:

*"The Jade Sovereign possesses the Dark Prime Banner,
Commanding the nine celestial terraces.
Those who attain the Dao through the Seven Awakenings receive the Dao’s tally,
Joyous and divine winds return,
The resplendent chariot named ‘Northern Flourishing Hua.’
The Purple Essence and Eastern Jade sing of the Three Powers,
Jade harmony beyond the Nine Heavens.
The Jade Talisman summons the Great Subtlety in the Niwan Palace,
The Three Primes’ divine title is born in the Niwan.
Radiant golden numen shines forth,
The Venerable Lord firmly upholds the Three Primes’ names,
Guarding the mechanisms of death’s nodes."*

The Perfected Lord of Great Harmony of Jade Clarity prays:

*"Supporting the dawn’s first radiance,
Purple clouds reflect the Dark Slope.
Resplendent, the Round Brilliance flourishes as the Sun’s name,
Dazzling and luminous, it washes the radiance of the Webbed Sun’s name.
Vast and subtle, the Numinous Radiance is the Primal Sun’s name,
Lush and scattered, the Azure Flower of the Void.
The Nine Heavens’ halls host jade guests,
The Golden Chamber sings the celestial hymn.
Virtuous indeed, facing the Sovereign’s left-hand immortal, Zhongchengzi,
Commanding the Dark Chariot of Lord Bo,
The seven ancestors dissolve the roots of the womb,
Generation after generation, they become immortals."*

The Highest Numinous Empyrean Jade Clarity Lord prays:

*"The Cinnabar Sovereign moves the Pearl Spirit’s name,
Guarding and stabilizing the Gate of Death.
Above, the Crimson Child,
The Dark Sovereign congeals the Heavenly Heavenly Sovereign’s name,
Also called ‘Unsurpassed Lord,’
And ‘Three Primes’ Foremost.’
Support and nurture my form,
Let me ascend the cloud chariot,
Ever seated in the Upper Clarity Terrace,
The Seven Mysteries become immortal lords."*

Conclude by softly reciting the charm:

*"Inner tone of heaven,
Pearl and Indigo arrayed, waves reach the Numinous Capital.
Outer tone of earth,
Body endures long, harm departs."*

**Jade Talisman of the Jade Sovereign of the Great Cavern for Demon-Quelling**

Method: Write in vermilion upon yellow silk and wear it. Visualize and invoke the inner taboo name of the Sovereign to guard beyond your Purple Chamber, calming the spirit in the Purple Chamber, harmonizing the true numen, sealing the apertures of death, and eternally preserving the Flourishing Canopy.

Then knock the teeth nine times, and again swallow the saliva thrice.

*Here ends the third scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*
Master Jiang Zongying of the Thirty-Eighth Generation of Maoshan Supreme Clarity, Collator.

**Scripture of the Purple Dawn Lord of the Supreme Sovereign, Scroll Four: The Chapter of the Left Radiant Duke**

Reverently invoke the Left Radiant Duke, Master Xuanchongshu, styled Hefuzi, who eternally guards beneath the adept’s left armpit, behind the liver, at the gate of the qi of death. There, beneath the left armpit, let jade light ever abide, guiding the numinous spirits upward into the pupils of both eyes.

In true contemplation, visualize the true qi of the Left Radiant Duke, Master Xuanchongshu, and the hue of jade light, veiling the crown of the head. Silently recite the charm:

*"The divine true of Radiance begets purple and yellow,
Three qi blend in harmony to form gong and shang.
Summoning true qi to guard the bladder,
Flowing through the Three Cinnabar to meet in the Grotto Chamber.
For me, it brings transcendence and transforms the cinnabar countenance,
Ascending on clouds to the golden-walled palace."*

Next, visualize the jade light entering from the adept’s Mud-Pill Palace. The adept then inhales the numinous cloud through the mouth, swallows the saliva thrice, and condenses it into three spirits. The first spirit appears as a refined scholar, clad in a turquoise brocade robe with a jade sash; two attendant spirits stand beside him. They descend into the right breast, pass through the Crimson Palace, enter the left bladder, then the right bladder, ascend again through the Crimson Palace, and enter the left breast. Passing behind the liver through the posterior gate, they follow the breath in exhalation.

Recite the *Jade Scripture*:

The *Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* states:
*"Supreme Darkness severs the Nine Mysteries,
The Grotto’s radiance entrusts the divine penetration.
The Jade Sovereign rides the vermilion aurora,
Verdant mists illumine the golden-walled palace.
Above, in the cloud-pearl chamber,
Gazing upward, I cast toward the uncarved peak of Jade Capital Mountain.
At the numinous pass beneath the Great Desert,
Misty vapors mirror the void.
The Dark Transformation blends the child of blood and spirit,
The Mysterious Mysterious Uncle, Fire King, Primordial Mother,
The wondrous stillness of the Lofty Peer, born with the Primordial Father.
The Boundless protects the Valley Youth,
The round path knows no stagnation.
The ornate terrace bears nine tiers,
To the south, the roots of seven ancestors are sundered,
To the west, the misfortunes of karmic entanglements are dissolved.
The body is tender amidst the myriad tidal waves,
The spirit arises to gather the ten directions.
The great return reverses the womb’s axle,
The Three Harmonies ride the celestial dragon."*

The Jade Clarity Supreme Sovereign of the Central Ultimate, Treasure Radiance King, intones:
*"Spirit calms, qi pervades,
Above, it communes with heaven.
Transcending the earthly gate,
Passing through the celestial portal,
Concealing breath in the four absolutes,
The Seven Stars scatter and disperse.
Flying through the Yin Chamber and the nostrils,
Sun and moon take root.
Guard the metal, conceal the jade,
Command the myriad spirits.
O Immortal King, what man is there?
I have already attained the true.
Concealed and stored, the feminine and masculine,
The Mysterious Grotto’s four directions—
The feminine, the One, the Four Palaces.
Within the knot, azure qi arises,
Named An Yanchang, the spirit’s knot.
Guard it, called Heying, the spirit’s knot.
Govern destiny, eternal and long.
The Mysterious Return to the Womb Spirit, name Gunei,
J

Earthly outer resonance, ever-present, follows the Wheel-less Dharma.
Great Cavern’s Primal Hero Lad’s Demon-Quelling Jade Talisman—
Incantation: Write in cinnabar on yellow silk, wear it, and inwardly invoke the Primal Hero Lad’s esoteric name, anchoring it beneath your left armpit. Let jade radiance inwardly illumine, spirit and clarity shine resplendent, sealing the portals of death, your body uniting with jade numen.

Then knock the teeth nine times and swallow saliva nine times.

*Highest Clarity Great Cavern True Scripture, Scroll the Second*
Collated by Jiang Zongying, the Thirty-Eighth Patriarch of Maoshan Highest Clarity

*Fifth Scripture of the Celestial Thearch of Grand Tenuity*
*Right White Prime Honored Spirit Chapter*
Reverently invoke Right White Prime Cavern Yang Lord Yu Lingbiao, styled Mystic Yi Jue, to ever guard beneath your right armpit, behind the lungs at the gate of death-qi. Let golden light ever abide beneath your right armpit, guiding spirit luminants into the palace of the Six Qi. May your seven generations of ancestors return to the womb of the Thearch’s Unity, your body ascending to the Jade Chamber.

In true contemplation, visualize Right White Prime Cavern Yang Lord Yu Lingbiao’s true qi, the hue of golden light, crowning your head. Silently intone:
*"Cavern Yang Yu Lingbao’s soul quickens,
Golden light gleams bright, essence within qi.
Summon truth, secure spirit, command long life,
Uproot the dark root, the womb’s infant.
Harness dawn’s qi, ascend to Highest Clarity."*

Next, visualize golden light entering through your Mud Pill, then orally draw in spirit-clouds and swallow saliva thrice, forming three spirits. One spirit appears as a refined scholar, clad in crimson brocade, girded with a jade sash; two attendant spirits stand beside him. They descend into the left breast, traverse the Crimson Palace, enter the right bladder, then the left bladder, ascend through the Crimson Palace into the right breast, pass behind the lungs at the posterior gate, and follow the exhalation’s course.

Recite the Jade Scripture.
The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states:
*"The Celestial Thearch of Grand Tenuity’s Mud Pill spirit,
Eight floating winds enter Cloud Camp,
Spirit’s lineage governs the numinous lapel.
Dragon Mountain Terrace, named Jade Capital of Radiance,
Golden Chamber, luxuriant with bright auroras.
Nine portals, the orifices of desire, gleam with lofty jasper.
Yellow Court traverses Northern Prime,
Prime Father turns left—Luminous Prime Father, styled—
Vermilion Essence Cavern Yang Lord, named Radiant Master White Plain Lord.
Secluded kidney spirit ascends to Highest Clarity,
Four Mysteries grasp the Prime Prohibition,
Long guard the Five Thearchs’ City."*

The Jade Clarity Great Thearch Lord intones:
*"Cavern Yang Yu Lingbiao, spirit’s name,
Guards the body’s death-gate,
Expels the Three Corpses’ accumulations,
Receives entry into the Nine True Sources.
Unbinds the womb, scatters stagnant blood,
A hundred joints quicken with true spirits.
Seven ancestors extinguish corpse-calamity,
Uproot ruin’s posterity, dispel harm’s cycle.
Black qi transforms, engendering womb-spirits,
Sever the womb’s death-root.
Former lives receive the Dao’s virtue,
Later generations attain the Thearch’s legacy.
Who is this Thearch’s legacy?
The seventh-generation descendant of Radiant Brilliance.
Thus do your ancestors enter the Immortal Capital,
Together seated at the Gate of Essence’s Perfection."*

Concluding, softly intone:
*"Heaven’s inner resonance,
Transcends stagnant heavens,
Traverses the Primordial Darkness’s inception."*

On earth’s outer resonance,
Bursts forth the dark sands, without fixed power.

*The Chapter of the Central Director of Destinies, Venerable Lord of Longevity*

Respectfully invoke the Central Director of Destinies, Venerable Lord of Longevity—*Li Mingchu*, styled *Xuandu Qing*—who ever guards the vermilion palace of your heart chamber, the gate of blood’s apertures, the door of death’s *qi*. From his mouth issues the *qi* of purple clouds, suffusing the five viscera within, so that the true *qi* of spirit and perfection arises in your heart, and the vermilion palace blossoms with five-colored flowers.
Inwardly visualize the true *qi* of the Central Director of Destinies, Venerable Lord *Li Mingchu*, its hue of purple clouds, veiling your crown. Silently intone:

*"The Director of Destinies fixes the years,
The Venerable Lord safeguards immortality.
Convey my name to the Southern Palace,
To be memorialized before the Thearch.
Lifetimes become lords of immortals,
Uprooting the seven-generation root.
Boundless blessings are repaid,
All as the Jade Scripture declares."*

Next, visualize purple *qi* entering through your *Niwan* palace. Inhale the divine clouds through your mouth, swallow saliva thrice, and coalesce them into a single spirit—feather-robed, crowned with a transcendent’s kerchief, resembling the Star of Earth. Descend into your heart, transforming it into a round, luminous moon. The spirit sits within the moon, exhaling in rhythm with the seasons.
Recite the *Jade Scripture*.

The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states:
*"Within the Purple Essence’s Great Void,
The Three Primordials’ Upper Radiant Way,
Resplendent, precious, vast brilliance,
Vast and distant, fanning the Thearch’s decree across the Nine Darks.
The spirit *Boshi* invokes the names of the Three Pristine *qi*,
The Thearch’s numen ascends Jade Clarity.
Auspicious *qi* nurtures the Five Numinous Ones,
The Director of Destinies, spirit of the primordial heart."*

The *Jade Thearch for Dispelling Demons* intones:
*"The Meeting of the Three Epochs’ collars joins the Lesser Lad of Grand Tenuity,
Who escorts the returned-womb infant,
Assisted by the Radiance-Supporter Minister guarding the lower pass.
The Prime Lord of Vast Mystery attends the Moon’s clarity.
Thus the Crimson *Qi* Lord of Chaotic Separation secures the lock,
The Bright Chariot Yellow *Qi* Lord receives completion.
Blessings extend to ten ancestors,
Calamities scatter for the dark-born.
Guarding the radiance of the six directions,
Transcending the Jade Thearch of Brahma’s name—the Seven Numinous Ones—
Together they engender billions,
Swiftly ascending the Jade Court.
The infant lingers, then departs,
Feather-robed, destiny shifts.
Myriad myriads of blessings,
Thousands of thousands of fortunes spread.
Bones gleam with jade’s luster,
Blood becomes a fountain of nectar.
Born to delight in heaven and earth,
Coeval with sun and moon."*

The *Highest Numinous Empyrean Jade Clarity Thearch* intones:
*"Fortunes spread before the Seven Mysteries,
Sins vanish within the Three Paths.
Divine breaths of the Nine Dawns’ tips,
Draw *qi* into the Northern Thearch’s palace.
Jade immortals escort the Great One,
Together enthroned in the profound void—
The Thearch of the Dark Empyrean, the Great One’s name.
Then they withdraw into the Upper Clarity’s chamber,
The Feathered Clarity’s Thearch’s abode."*

Concluding, softly intone:
*"Heaven’s inner resonance,
Soars through the blossoming court,
Gazes upon the accomplished plan, stills the swelling depths—
These three are the sun’s inner names.
Secretly recite them thrice.

Let him roam within your navel’s midst, where yellow clouds brim and overflow, the three destinies take root, and the fetal knots dissolve and disperse. Thus, may your seven generations of parents be free from accumulated calamities, with no lingering karmic debts, and attain liberation across lifetimes, ascending to the Celestial Emperor’s palace.

Evil demons sever their smoke.
All come before the Emperor,

Deliver my life’s register,

Next, visualize the qi of dark clouds entering through your *Niwan* (Mud-Pill Palace). Inhale the divine cloud through the mouth, swallow saliva seven times, and coalesce it into seven spirits. Loosen the hair and bare the feet, enter the Crimson Palace, then divide into the two bladder channels, piercing the *Weilü* (Tailbone Hollow), ascending to fill the two kidneys, emerging at the hollow bone of the back, exhaling in rhythm with the breath.

Recite the *Jade Scripture*.

The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states:

*"August Supreme transcends the shadowless sound,
Wheel-turning Nine Luminaries name life.
Whirling winds merge the imperial heart,
Eight qi revolve in eternal peace.
Vast rosy clouds mount the mountain of divine heaven,
Five Emperors, Solar Emperor spread solar essence.
Fluid drifts in the primordial membrane,
Blood congeals the Five Flowers’ balance.
The body’s treasure, round pearl, mirrors solar essence,
Flowing radiance plucks my form.
Named ‘Receiving Leisure’s Abundance’—Solar White Emperor’s title,
Also called ‘Limpid Depths’—Solar Black Emperor’s name.
Together they cross the Three Gates of Extinction,
Unlock the register to ascend Great Clarity.
Let me preserve the immortal true,
Seven generations don the green-blue primordial qi.
Unravel misfortune from the dark paths below,
Raise blessings to the dawn’s numinous above.
Generation upon generation ascend the Jade Realm, Jade Void’s borders,
Seven ancestors reverse the womb’s rebirth."*

The *August Supreme Jade Clarity Three Primordials King* proclaims:

Holding the register of records,
Riding the radiant dragon,
Left whirls the numinous luminaries,
Right fans the divine winds.
Lofty, concealed-pearl Solar Lady,
Fragrant and lustrous, infant’s dawn,
Vastly beholds the Great Void.
Launder and refine the Five Penetrations,
Clarify the soul’s feathered darkness,
Refine the po in the hollow sameness.
Summon my hundred spirits,
Lunar Emperor reports merit.
Seven ancestors follow life,
Radiant blessings flourish and prosper.
Return my aged years,
Restore the dark youth.
Above, face the Divine Empyrean,
Golden light in ten directions.
Jade wheels fly in the whirlwind,
Strike gold and ring bells."*

Soaring to the Mornlight Capital."*

Next, visualize white qi entering from the mud-pill between the brows. Inhale the divine cloud through the mouth, swallow saliva six times, and condense it into Six Spirits, shaped like golden stars, clad in pale azure robes and caps. They descend into the Crimson Palace, enter the two bladder channels, pass through the Tail Gate, ascend along the spine, and enter the mud-pill.

Together with the Moon’s Feathered Dawn Spirits.
The Great One summons the celestial demons,
The Emperor-Lord reviews the myriad essences.
Severing the accumulated qi of death,
Transcending to the Immortal Emperor’s court.
The Emperor stands atop the Three Passes,

In the left hand, the chalice of fortune’s nectar;
In the right, the vase of blessed source."*

The Five Elders rectify solemnity,
The Imperial One preserves the spirit.
The Controller of Destiny presents the register,
Offering the talisman to the Three Primes.
The womb-tree severs and falls,
The blood-corpse’s root is cut off.
Returning the womb to vermilion fire,
Revolving the qi to the mud-pill.
I unite with the Nine Immortals,
Greatly harmonizing the hundred spirits.
The body ascends to the Jade Chamber,
Riding alongside the Golden Immortals.
Carefree in the Supreme Primordial,
Gazing back to the Three Heavens.
The flourishing brush of Chonghua,
Layered branches flow with the mysterious.
For generations a Dao Earl,
Great fortune entwined.

At dawn, ascend the Ninefold Luminous Terrace,
At dusk, enter the Divine Empyrean Gate.
The Great One’s Divine Master—
Or thrice daily, the name of the Inner Concubine within the Dipper’s bowl.
In the left hand, he holds your talisman and register;
In the right, he grasps the Cavern Yang Sovereign.
Determining life, he meets in the Purple Chamber,
The five spirits intermingle and divide.
Dividing, they roam the Thearch’s chambers,
The seven ancestors’ roots of death are severed.
The five poisons’ qi scatter and vanish,
Obstructions and hindrances dissolve without trace.

blending to form the true,
summoning the Moon’s soul above,
descend as spirit for me,
open my immortal gate,
seven ancestors ascend together,
to audience with the Imperial Lord.

Next, visualize the moonlight’s radiance entering through my Mud-Pill Palace. I then orally absorb the divine cloud and swallow saliva three times, coalescing it into a spirit, shaped like the Great Yin Star, wielding moonlight, descending to spread through the Crimson Palace, threading through the Jade Stem into the Tailbone Hollow, entering the spinal marrow, ascending to the First Vertebra, piercing the Mud-Pill Palace, passing into the right pupil. Roll the eyes seven times, without moving the left eye, exhaling in accord with the breath’s rhythm.

Recite the Jade Scripture.

The Great Cavern’s Jade Scripture states:

Within the Dipper’s four stars dwell four Perfected Ones,
scattering blossoms upon the Jade Clarity Terrace.
The Imperial Minister Zhongxuan, born as the Celestial Emperor’s aide,
once circled—all the host of Perfected came.
Incense winds fan the Three Treasures,
the Five Viscera shine upon the Azure Barrier Palace’s name.
The Celestial Emperor presents the immortal,
plucks forth the Seven Mysteries,
transforms the seeds of death into trees,
severs the roots of the womb’s bonds.
The Great One brandishes the wind,
styled “Lodge-Frequency,” the Great One’s name,
cuts off the polluted blood,
hews down the miasmic smoke.
The White Emperor of Western Florescence, the White Emperor’s name,
becomes my Northern Spirit.

The Most High Divine Numinous-Heaven Jade Clarity King invokes:
The Three Primes firmly spread above,
the Elder Lord’s spirit engenders the Dao of the Three Primes’ name.
Secure my ethereal soul’s wanderings,
guard my sixfold brain’s convergence.
Sorrow and suffering sink into the Crooked Gate,
the breath of death seals the earth below.
My body and the Emperor Unity Lord,
side by side, delight the Six Palaces.
Mirror the heart within the Cinnabar Mystery Chamber,
brighten the qi of the Mud-Pill Wilds.
The body gleams with golden radiance,
the feathered register summons the Perfected.
White qi densely gathers,
the hundred spirits glow resplendent.
Ever with the sun and moon,
talismanic records entwine.
Through generations preserve virtue and the Dao,
forever become a Heavenly Immortal.
Silently, inwardly concentrate—
thus ascend to the Imperial Morn.

Done, then softly intone:
Heaven’s inner tone,
fresh and crooked, mysterious,
mirrored, layered chariot.

Earth’s outer tone,
ever-aiding joy,
shedding sorrow and suffering.

styled "Mystic Passage Minister, Director of Destinies by name,"
guardian of life in the Great Auroral Palace,
arrayed among the guest chambers of the Upper Clarity.
The Gate of Destiny joins with essence to prolong,

To my left, the Primordial Simplicity Lord is borne;
to my right, the Vermilion Luxuriance Spirit is grasped.

Five Elders sit in paired attendance;

ascending to the imperial dawn.
Seven generations of stagnant blood
are all uprooted;
returning to the Southern Palace’s womb,
they receive rebirth in the imperial chariot.
I feast in the Jade Hall,
robed in shared splendor with the imperial wheel.
Generation upon generation, inscribed in the charts,
feathered garments unfurl their banners.
Children’s children preserve prosperity—
blessings extend to later mysteries.
Ever a transcendent elder,
commanding the ten thousand spirits.

This concluded, softly intone:

Together, may they guard beneath the five viscera of the adept, at the gate of dead qi above the great stomach. Let the golden liquid flow and spread, the jade radiance illumine the soul, the spirit’s nourishment overflow through the deepest intestines, and the imperial qi fill the nine barriers. Release the Seven Ancestors from the dark and hidden, rebirth them in the Southern Immortals’ womb, unravel the upper knots, and cast off the lower fetal root.

Returning to the Vermilion Fire Chamber’s womb,
Receiving anew life within the Cavern.

Reverently invoke the Great Cavern Primordial One, the Supreme Numinous Sovereign of Grand Simplicity—Father Tranquility and Mother Essence, the dual union of the two, the vast convergence of the hundred perfected, the revolving inception of the One. The body coalesces into mist, transforming the fetal primordial infant. The radiant treasures of sun and moon illumine my corporeal form. The Great One abides above, merging with the August Emperor. The Mud-Pill Palace preserves jade, the five viscera blossom with splendor, ever conjoined with sun and moon. Grasping the Cavern Scripture, one ascends as an Immortal Duke, rising at dawn to the Highest Clarity. Thirty-nine chapters, golden talismans of the Feathered Court.

In profound meditation, visualize the Great Cavern Primordial One, Sovereign Father Tranquility, within the true qi. The qi of five-colored purple clouds enshrouds the crown. Then silently intone:

Next, visualize the five-colored purple clouds entering through the Mud-Pill Palace. Inhale the divine clouds through the mouth, swallowing saliva twelve times, coalescing into a single spirit. The body is clad in a halo of five-hued purple and white mist, the spirit dwelling within its light. It descends into the body’s interior, dispersing qi through the nine apertures, gathering upon the tongue’s tip. Exhale gently in accord with the seasons.

Recite the Jade Scripture.

The Jade Talisman of the Great Cavern Primordial One for Dispelling Demons

Instructions state:
Inscribe in purple upon yellow silk and wear it. Visualize and invoke the inner secret names of the Venerable Sovereign to revolve the wind and merge into unity, coalescing into the perfection of the Dao. Grasping the talismanic register, prolonging destiny’s span, undergoing a thousand transformations and myriad changes, ascending into the Nine Profounds. Seven ancestors attain liberation, reverting to the fetal state in the Three Heavens, sharing the Emperor’s repose, all forms becoming immortal.

Then strike the teeth thirty-nine times and swallow saliva thirty-nine times.

The Secret Instructions on Revolving the Wind and Merging with the Primordial One:
Upon completing the recitation of the Jade Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters, strike the teeth thirty-nine times. Then close both eyes and visualize the hundred spirits transforming into white qi, chaotic as white clouds, emerging from the primordial void to enter the mouth, dense and lingering for a long while.

Perceive the white qi emanating from the lower body, from the Jade Stem, from the soles of both feet, and from the palms of both hands, enveloping the entire body. Above and below, hands and feet merge into one with the white qi, ascending and descending indistinctly.

After a long while, the white qi suddenly transforms into dense purple clouds, entering the head through the mouth and filling the five viscera within the abdomen.

After another long while, the purple clouds emerge from the soles of both feet, the palms of both hands, the lower body, and the Jade Stem, enveloping the entire body in dense mist. Above and below, they merge with the form, indistinct from one another.

Presently, visualize the purple cloud qi filling the left and right, permeating the chamber. Then perceive wind qi issuing from the mouth, fanning the purple mist, causing it to revolve and intertwine. Suddenly, it coalesces into a perfected person, male in form, resembling a newborn infant, four inches in height, named the Great Cavern Primordial One Venerable Sovereign. His name is Father Tranquility Abiding, his style Mother Essence Prolonged. He guards the life-and-death barrier, the revolving wind of the host of spirits merging and transforming to form this Venerable Sovereign of the Primordial One.

The Venerable Sovereign enters through the mouth beneath the tongue, ascending directly into the Purple Chamber’s Sixfold Union Palace, seated upright facing outward.

In his left hand, the Venerable Sovereign holds my five talismans; in his right hand, my five registers.

To the left of the Venerable Sovereign’s mouth shines sunlight, nine fen in diameter; to the right, moonlight, one cun in diameter.

The Venerable Sovereign exhales the revolving wind’s qi, blowing upon the light of sun and moon, which transforms into dense white or purple hues.

The light and qi descend into my five viscera, six bowels, and hundred joints, illuminating the entire body within with penetrating clarity, so that inside and out appear as bright as daylight. After a long while, I suddenly forget my own form. When the ritual is complete and the spirit and qi have settled, I feel my body light and pure, my spirit refreshed and expansive.

Then I click my teeth thirty-nine times, rub my face with both hands, and recite the following ode:

The Most High instructs me,
To recite the *Dongzhen* scripture,
Jade tones harmonize with golden notes,
Rising to fill the Court of Supreme Nothingness.
They untie knots and disperse hidden misfortunes,
Liberate the spirits of seven generations of ancestors,
Return to the womb and meet in the Southern Palace,
That each generation may bear a jade name.
The Three Paths’ roots of sin are extinguished,
And through cyclic transformation, one ascends to the Upper Clarity.

After reciting the scripture, I restore the incense burner and pray:

I, your humble servant [Name], having entered the oratory on this auspicious day to perform the recitation of the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern True Scripture*, now offer my wishes. May the immortal spirits and immortal officials, the Golden Lads and messengers, the Five Thearchs, the gods and immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the perfected of the Three Heavens, the True Spirits, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, the immortals of heaven and earth, the Five Numinous Fragrance Officials, and the mighty spirits attendant upon the scripture, command the summoning of the upright qi from the ten directions. May the golden liquid, cinnabar, and jade mushrooms naturally arise, and may the Nine Mysteries and Jade Perfected gather in this hall of purification. Together, may they bathe my body, so that I may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality, soar through the Great Void, and ascend in radiance through the Nine Heavens. May jade lads and jade maidens attend me with fragrant incense, and may they report all that I have petitioned and vowed here, directly to the presence of the Lofty Perfected, the Jade Thearch, the Supreme Dao, and the myriad sagely hosts.

When the prayer is finished, I bow in reverence to the four directions and rise.
