# 元始天尊说玄微妙经

*The Venerable Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning Expounds the Sutra of the Mysterious and Subtle*

The Dao speaks: To fathom the subtlety of the mysterious and subtle, one must cultivate stillness of mind and practice the Dao in accordance with the seasons. On the vernal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing east. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yang Brightness Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yang Brightness Star is the eastern spirit of the Northern Dipper. There, visualize entering the star’s center and sitting within it. Swallow the purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Eastern Supreme Palace of the Yang Brightness Star, where the Azure Mystery Youth dwells, bestowing upon you the True Light.

First, visualize beneath the Northern Dipper a purple qi as vast as a bowstring, descending straight before you, and only then visualize the Three Ones. Master Zhou’s oral instructions state: Visualize the seven figures beneath the seven stars of the Dipper, ascending together to the Yang Brightness Star in a formation like wild geese, with you at the center. "Beneath the stars" means the Dipper’s bowl covers your head, its handle pointing forward. Swallowing the purple qi thirty times means visualizing the purple qi and drawing it in. Also imagine the Three Ones and Three Ministers swallowing it simultaneously. After swallowing, further visualize the seven figures riding the purple qi, descending from the void, and returning to your Three Palaces. After a long while, recite this prayer from the heart:

*"Three Venerable Perfected Ones, Supreme Mysterious Lofty Spirits,*
*Yang Brightness governs spring, myriad youths open the gates;*
*Cinnabar Prime governs summer, vermilion and purple merge in mist;*
*Yin Essence governs autumn, celestial might arrays six ranks;*
*North Culmen governs winter, all evil and treachery are blocked.*
*Five Earths hold the ren, the celestial passes of wu and ji,*
*All they shatter is destroyed, all they face remains unharmed.*
*Refine my seven po, harmonize my three hun,*
*Vitalize my five viscera, let me attain the True.*
*Ascend to soar in the Upper Clarity, float through the Seven Origins’ radiance,*
*Abide in longevity and compliance, command the thousand spirits with a whistle."*

This may also be practiced while lying down. The same incantation applies to all four seasonal nodes.

On the summer solstice, at midnight, rise and sit facing south. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Cinnabar Prime Star of the Northern Dipper. The Cinnabar Prime Star is the southern spirit of the Northern Dipper. There, visualize entering the star and sitting within it. Swallow the purple qi thirty times. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive the Southern Culmen Supreme Palace of the Cinnabar Prime Star, where the Vermilion Yang Numinous Consort dwells, bestowing upon you the Crimson Script and Treasure Texts.

On the autumnal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing west. With eyes closed, visualize the Three Ones within the Three Palaces of your body, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in total, with you at the center. Together, you all ride the mist of purple qi and ascend to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence Star is [text incomplete, missing approximately 470 characters].

[...] The eight seasonal nodes are to be determined by consulting the calendar. These eight nodes mark the correct degrees of the Jade Armillary, the days when the myriad perfected, numinous immortals, and divine spirits gather in audience. The Northern Thearch’s natural method holds that within the lunar cycle, the days when the three luminaries’ qi align are also most auspicious. It is fitting to cultivate the Dao on these days.

In synthesis, I follow the One alone. Foreign lands reckon the first day of the month as *jian*, the second as *chu*, and so on in sequence. This may be used where no calendar is available in remote regions. The Xiongnu kingdom takes the first day of the first month as *jiayin*, with the six *jia* days cycling continuously. Their months alternate as follows: first month long, second month long, third month short, fourth month long, fifth month short, sixth month long, seventh month short, eighth month long, ninth month short, tenth month long, eleventh month short, twelfth month long. Those dwelling in remote forests or distant, inaccessible places should also follow this reckoning.

On *jian* days, or the first day of the month, at dawn, visualize the Three Ones emerging from your Three Palaces and sitting before you. Then rise from the heart and bow twice, as if seeing them faintly. Recite this prayer from the heart: [...]

The Heavenly Honored Three Emperors guard the Gate of my life,
roaming the Void within,
where the six qi divide in mystery,
nurturing my five spirits,
rectifying my three hun-souls,
so the five viscera generate of themselves,
and I attain long life and ascend as a flying immortal.

When finished, again visualize them returning from the Void into the Three Palaces.
After a long while, swallow saliva thirty times.
Perform this ten times, and at night you will dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers.
Or you may dream of white crows, white cranes,
white tigers, or objects of gold and jade—
all are manifestations and signs of the Three Ones’ transformations.
If you maintain this practice without negligence,
the visions will appear,
and you will gradually see them face to face.

On every *chu* day at midnight,
rise in secret and face north,
gazing at the forms within the seven stars of the Northern Dipper.
Visualize the Three Ones descending from the Auxiliary Star
and entering your Three Palaces.
When this is complete, return to bed and meditate quietly,
imagining them as if faintly seen.
Then softly recite this prayer:

Great Heavenly Auxiliary,
where the Three Emperors roam,
the Three Ministers support my bones,
uniting with the Perfected,
descending into my body,
settling in tranquil primal seat,
exhaling essence to bathe my form,
so hun and po harmonize and moisten,
that I may ascend as a flying immortal,
traveling the clouds in floating roam.

When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times.
Do this once on each *chu* day of the month.

On every *kai* day at midnight,
rise and sit facing east,
remove your headwrap,
or let your hair loose,
then comb and bind it again,
taking care to tie it securely.
Softly recite this invocation:

Supreme Three Perfected,
Divine Infant within the Real,
hair unbound to open the mist,
ascending to connect with Heavenly Terrace,
mud-pill solidified and firm,
moving in time with Heaven,
that I may fly as an immortal,
traversing the towers of the Wu Terrace.

When finished, swallow saliva nineteen times,
then replace your headwrap and return to bed.
With focused mind, visualize the Three Ones and Three Ministers
each settled in their palaces,
the Emperor and his ministers seated facing one another.
Visualize the Three Ones exhaling qi thirty times within their palaces—
when you do this, exhale qi yourself thirty times as well.
Exhaling qi means the method of opening the mouth and releasing breath.
At that time, you will feel your body grow warm,
a sign of harmonized spirit and congealed hun-soul.
In all visualizations, close your eyes slightly
and inwardly gaze upon the divine palace.
The Dao of visualizing the One
causes the Supreme Three Primordial qi to appear within the Three Palaces.
The Three Primordials are the three faint hues of purple, azure, and crimson—
purple above.
Then visualize and guard the Three Ones within them,
and imagine the Jade Palace of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Gate,
where the celestial officials are arrayed in order.
Envision yourself seated before the Emperor,
and whatever you seek, bow in your heart.
The Supreme is the Shangqing;
the Emperor of Shangqing is the most exalted.
The Northern Culmen’s Purple Chamber is the Emperor’s chamber.
Also visualize your Three Ones
discussing with the Emperor the Dao of flying immortality and eternal life.

Whenever partaking of a grand feast,
always rectify your mind and visualize the One,
imagining the One partaking of the food first,
then you may eat.
If you do this consistently,
perverse qi will retreat far away,
and true qi will come forward.
After eating, recite this prayer in your heart:

The hundred grains enter the stomach,
uniting with spirit and qi,
filling and replenishing blood and fluids,
the corpse-demons fall away,
to live as long as Heaven and Earth,
ascending to the Golden Gates,
commanding the Six Dings,
with divine youths attending and guarding.

The method of guarding the One:
on *jia-wu*, *jia-chen*, and *jia-yin* days at midnight,
sweep and purify a quiet chamber’s courtyard,
lay out a mat one *zhang* square,
burn incense and bow twice facing north—
this may also be done as a mental bow.
Then gaze upward at the seven stars of the Northern Dipper,
visualizing purple qi emerging from the Dipper
and entering the Three Palaces within your body.
Facing north, clasp your hands over your knees,
and visualize the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and yourself
all riding the purple qi to ascend to the Great Ultimate.
The Great Ultimate is a star.
Let your body and form fade away,
as if in a trance like ascending to Heaven—
this brings the immortal Dao near.
The immortals call this the Great Stillness.
On overcast or rainy days,
you may perform this visualization on your bed,
or prepare a platform in a quiet place,
one *zhang* square,
enclosed by a fence several *chi* high.
On the appointed day, always cultivate this—
this is the Dao of the Great Stillness.

The Dao of guarding the One:
always observe the time of the moon’s first appearance,
face the moon and bow twice,
then softly recite this prayer:

Mysterious Essence of the Great Yin,
Lady of the Radiant Moon,
newly born flowing light,
illuminating my Three Palaces,
that I may fly as an immortal above,
soaring freely through the eight directions,
wherever I turn, wherever I wish,
all shall be within fortune’s embrace.

The Dao of guarding the One:
always visualize the Northern Dipper hovering above your head,
its handle pointing forward—
this is the essential secret to repel all perverse influences
and extinguish inauspicious qi.

When guarding the One,
avoid eating the five pungent vegetables and all meat,
and do not enter the home of a woman who has recently given birth.
On *jia-zi* days, also avoid seeing drunkards
and all foul or putrid things—
keep your distance and be cautious,
dismissing all doubts without hesitation.
Do not hold infants—
only your own child is permitted.
Do not share clothing, shoes, beds, or mats with others—
only when guarding the One.
Cultivating the real, stilling the spirit,
focusing on the Dao to summon the numinous—
all these require separate spaces,
not merely this one practice.

The Later Sage, Lord Emperor of the Golden Gates,
once received the *Scripture of the Three Primordial Ones of the Three Origins*,
the *True Talisman of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*,
the *Scripture of the Five Dippers’ True One*,
and the *Precious Chapters of the Lord Emperor of the Great Ultimate*—
four methods in all,
which he later transmitted to the immortal Juanzi.
Juanzi, while fishing in the river, caught a fish
and upon cutting it open, found a green jade casket.
Opening it, he discovered two talismans and two scriptural methods—
this was it.

This is the supreme Dao of the Inner Concealed Earthly Perfected,
by which one may attend banquets in the Shangqing,
wander and gaze upon the Great Ultimate,
soar and roam Mount Kongtong,
rest and sleep on Mount Kunlun.

According to the *Illuminating Regulations of the Four Poles*,
the method of the *Life-Bestowing Talisman of Radiant Light*:
all those who possess the supreme scriptures of the Earthly Perfected
must observe transmission time limits,
swear oaths before the Three Officials,
present silk and blood at the altar,
and make covenants with blood and leather
before receiving the transmission.
The recipient must purify themselves for a hundred days,
or fifty, thirty, twenty-one, ten, or seven days.
Only those who can be taught—
those of sincere heart and true faith—
should be transmitted the method of guarding the Three Origins’ Perfected,
using the talismans of the Two Emperors,
and ascending the Dao of the Five Dippers.
This is the supreme Dao of the Earthly Perfected.

The method allows transmission to one person every forty years,
and no more than ten people in four hundred years.
If no suitable person is found,
write a copy on white silk,
seal it, and deposit it in a hidden cave within the Five Marchmounts.
Every forty years, write another copy
and seal it in the Five Marchmounts.
The Five Marchmounts are gathered in one mountain—
they need not be evenly distributed across five peaks,
but rather placed in the nearest suitable location.
If no marchmount is nearby,
famous mountains will suffice—
such as Mount Baodu in the north,
Mount Difei in the west,
Mount Luofu and Mount Taihe in the south,
Mount Tiantai and Mount Kuohuo in the east—
these and others are all famous mountains.

If ten suitable people are found within four hundred years,
they may be transmitted the method;
beyond that time, it may no longer be revealed.
Those who violate the regulations, leak the secrets,
or fail to follow the proper methods
will be sent to the Water Officials,
to suffer the trials of the Wind Blade,
and their descendants will meet with calamity and extinction.

The blood oaths of the fragile covenants
were received by the Green Lad,
who revealed them to later students
as enduring standards and measures.

Should one receive the *Scripture of the Three Primordials and the True Unity*, one must seek a master of the Dao who is bound by fragile covenants, offering eighty-seven feet of plain white silk and three pairs of silver rings. (For a single copy, twenty-nine feet of white silk and one pair of silver rings suffice. The above is the total sum.) Alternatively, three jade tablets may be used in place of the oath sworn by cutting leather to seal against leaks. For the *Scripture of the Supreme Five Dipper True Unity*, one must seek a master who holds the scripture, presenting forty feet of purple inscribed silk and two pairs of gold rings, substituting for the blood-oath contracts that risk decay and disclosure. For the *True Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master who holds the talismans, offering twenty feet of vermilion silk. For the *Precious Chart Talismans of the Great Ultimate*, one must seek a master of the scripture and charts, presenting twenty feet of azure silk, equivalent to the vow made upon ascending the altar and shearing one’s hair—a pledge binding until death. Those who receive these must await the depths of forests, marshes, mountains, and wilds, and may not recklessly employ them for private gain. Should one violate and fail to uphold them, the statutes of severance and erasure shall apply, and the transgressor shall perish, cast into the Three Springs. Transmission from father to son must likewise adhere to the fragile covenants as prescribed. All transmissions are conducted between master and disciple, thereby honoring the root and foundation and making clear the gravity of Heaven’s sincerity. Yet this is not the sole purpose; rather, it is to ensure that the methods of instruction have a proper beginning. Truly, unless one is predestined with immortal bones and the mysterious registers, one shall never even hear or glimpse the wondrous Dao of the True Unity.
