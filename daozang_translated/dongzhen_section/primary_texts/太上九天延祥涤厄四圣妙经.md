### **Invocation of the Four Saints**

We reverently invoke the Four Marshals of the Northern Quadrant,
Great Sage Lords who bind and subdue the hordes of demons.
With disheveled hair and sword in hand, their majestic forms,
A million heavenly soldiers ever surround and protect.
Heavenly Peng and Heavenly You eradicate evil,
Yi the Saintly and True Martial bestow blessings.
We humbly beseech your descent to the sacred altar,
That all calamities and misfortunes may dissolve of themselves.

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:
Six dragons ascend the left steps, nine tigers guard the center,
Manifesting the awe-inspiring visage of three heads and six arms,
Wielding the vast creation of the Seven Governors and Eight Spirits.
At the first toll of the imperial bell, myriad saints arrive as one;
With a light sweep of the halberd-axe, legions of demons shatter.
Divine radiance blazes forth, ever rescuing sentient beings;
True nature stands towering, vowing to eternally uphold the true Dao.
Splitting corpses for a thousand miles, beheading ghosts of five forms—
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy,
He who Communicates with Heaven to Pray for Blessings,
Prolongs Auspiciousness and Dispels Calamities,
Preserves Peace of Body and Life—
**The Great Marshal of the Eighty-One Armies of the Northern Pole, Heavenly Peng,**
**True Lord of the Nation-Protecting Demon-Quelling,**
**Heavenly Worthy of Universal Coverage through the Clouds of Dharma-Fruition.**

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:
In the wondrous midst of Heaven, to the right of the Hall of Luminous Clarity,
Leading the secondary marshals of the Celestial Stem,
Ranked among the lords of the earthly realm,
Moved by the deluded mortals who lose their true nature,
Gazing upon the great light of the saintly countenance to compose this preface,
Praising and expounding the hidden rhymes of the myriad heavens,
Recounting the immortal chapters of the Great Brahma.
Looking down in pity upon the sincerity of devotees,
Bestowing the great power of protection and support—
Clouds arise with each step, seas flow with the body’s passage.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy,
He who Communicates with Heaven to Pray for Blessings,
Prolongs Auspiciousness and Dispels Calamities,
Nurtures and Sustains Body and Life—
**The Great Marshal of the Northern Pole, Heavenly You,**
**Universal Transforming Heavenly Emperor,**
**Heavenly Worthy of Impassive Harmony and Responsive Goodness through Dharma-Fruition.**

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:
Having accomplished merit at the imperial gate,
Ranked among the celestial court,
Commanding the decrees of the Three Caverns and Five Thunders,
Holding the balance of power over the Eight Heavens and Nine Earths,
Mastering the pivot of creation and transformation,
Assisting the immortals and divine officers,
No evil remains unsevered, what ghost dares stand before him?
Seizing the mighty demons, driving away the darting comets of malevolence,
Radiance outshines sun and moon, might shakes heaven and earth.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy,
He who Communicates with Heaven to Pray for Blessings,
Prolongs Auspiciousness and Dispels Calamities,
Protects and Sustains Body and Life—
**The Great Marshal of the Northern Pole, Yi the Saintly, Black Slayer,**
**True Lord of Stored Blessings and Preserved Virtue,**
**Heavenly Worthy of Wandering the Three Realms through Dharma-Fruition.**

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:
The stars of *Xu* and *Wei* divide their lodging,
*Ren* and *Gui* nurture the numinous,
Transforming his body from the august Golden Gate,
Residing in the ultimate mystery of the Jade Void.
Profound and wondrous to the utmost—how could it be merely aiding the upright and expelling evil?
Born of the Orthodox Unity—how could it be merely quelling demons and protecting the nation?
Preserving the end of the kalpa and regulating its beginning,
Guarding all beings and governing all immortals,
Courageous, resolute, and perfect in talent,
Majestic in spirit and replete in virtue.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy,
He who Communicates with Heaven to Pray for Blessings,
Prolongs Auspiciousness and Dispels Calamities,
Brings Peace and Harmony to Body and Life—
**The Great Marshal of the Northern Pole, True Martial, Protector Saint,**
**August Emperor of Mysterious Heaven, Origin Saint, Benevolent Might,**
**Incarnation of the Golden Gate,**
**Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through Dharma-Fruition at the Kalpa’s End.**

With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence and submission:
The Most Supreme Heaven of the Azure Beginning,
The true and wondrous gate of the Pure Capital,
Receiving the five-colored radiance of penetrating illumination,
A rare assembly, hearing the profound mechanism of the Nine Heavens’ Prolonged Auspiciousness.
The Four True Ones may be relied upon—
Joyfully encountering the august elder of the Golden Quadrant,
Reopening the karmic causes of the mundane world,
Fortunate that the Primordial Worthy deigned to bestow talismans,
Before the assembled saints, entrusting secret incantations anew.
Opening the convenient path of the great earth’s prayers for blessings,
Manifesting the majestic numen of the Great Mystery’s responsiveness.
What calamity will not be extinguished? What fortune will not be attained?
Act according to the vow, respond according to sincerity.
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—
In the assembly of numinous multitudes, among the ranks of calamity-dispelling,
The Emperors and Lords of the Ten Directions and Myriad Heavens,
The Three Officials and Five Emperors,
The sun, moon, and all stars,
The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms,
Perfected Persons and Divine Immortals,
Utmost True Great Saints,
The Heavenly Elders of the Nine Heavens,
The ranked saints of the celestial bureaus,
The deities of one’s birth date and destiny,
The stars governing fate and fortune,
The divine youths and powerful warriors of the Four Saints’ retinue,
The divine kings and fierce generals,
The northern armies,
The majestic spirits of the ritual registers,
The lords of mountains and marshes,
The deities of the sacrificial canon,
The witnesses of the sutra assembly—
All true numina,
We humbly beseech that our earnest sincerity ascend,
That the saintly presence deign to descend,
Eradicating disasters and recording good deeds,
That all we invoke and follow,
May sever poisons and protect living beings,
Wielding authority and bestowing fortune.
May all sentient beings, with one heart, bow in reverence and submission.

### **Mystic Essence Incantation for Opening the Sutra**

The true origin of Heaven and Earth takes form,
In the human realm, the honored Dao/virtue.
The celestial patterns inscribe eight corners,
Those who awaken uproot the roots of evil.
With diligent intent, one reaches the cinnabar gate,
With devout heart, one attains the Purple Clarity.
Auspicious mists pervade the eight extremities,
Auspicious vapors spread over the immortal capital.
The profound principles of the Three Vehicles,
The luminous preservation of the One Nature.
Now we contemplate the supreme Dharma,
Wishing to emerge from the sea of delusion.

### **The Supreme Nine Heavens Sutra of Prolonging Auspiciousness and Dispelling Calamities by the Four Saints**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Heaven of the Azure Beginning,
Within the Jade Capital, upon the Numinous Terrace,
Emitting five-colored radiance, each hue distinct,
Illuminating all within and without, making everything bright and clear.
Assembling the myriad heavens of the ten directions,
The sun, moon, and stellar lodgings,
The Three Officials and Four Saints,
The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms,
Perfected Persons and Divine Immortals,
Utmost True Great Spirits,
The four quarters and above and below,
The lords of mountains and marshes,
An innumerable host,
Expounding the wondrous Dao of Non-Action.
Golden light shot forth like the sun,
Purple vapors suffused his body,
Dharma rain spread everywhere,
Numinous winds fanned universally.
Golden lads held the tablets,
Jade maidens bore the incense,
Phoenixes and simurghs sang in harmony,
Consorts and empresses performed music.
Before the throne, even the spirits of earth and wood listened in contemplation.

At that moment, beneath the throne there was a Heavenly Lord named the Western White Emperor of the Seven Qi, who held a tablet and knelt at length, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Your servant observes that people in the world dwell within cages, each of their circumstances different. Some are clad in brocade and feast on delicacies, dwelling in golden halls and jade chambers, with carved beams and towering eaves. Others beg from dawn to dusk, clad in tattered garments, their bodies exposed to the elements, seeking shelter in spirit temples or hiding where no place offers refuge. Some, though born into the human realm, are hunchbacked or afflicted with sores and leprosy, shunned by all, suffering from cold and hunger, poverty and distress, blind, deaf, mute, or crippled, their bodies incomplete. Others are of lowly status, enduring beatings and hardships, a thousand torments and ten thousand sorrows, with no recourse for complaint. Still others rely on their superiors to oppress their subordinates, using strength to bully the weak. I do not understand why these causes and conditions are thus. Your humble servant remains unenlightened; I humbly beseech the Heavenly Countenance not to abandon me, but to expound the wondrous meaning, illuminating what is not yet understood and resolving what is unknown."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, White Emperor, that you raise this question. Return to your seat and preserve your true nature; I shall explain it to you. People are born and raised in the dusty world, bearing the heavens above and treading the earth below. From youth to old age, from strength to decline, they delight in the splendor of fame and profit, revel in the abundance of life, ceaselessly pursuing their desires, heedless of danger and ruin. They entrap the worthy and good, allowing the three karmic actions to arise and the six senses to contend, for the six senses, once bound to the nine knots, bring calamity. Thus, to have a body is to have burdens; to have burdens is to have karma; to have karma is to have retribution. Knowing there is retribution, all depends on cultivation and reflection. The fruits of sentient beings—poverty and lowliness—are shaped by past karma, while wealth and honor arise from past accumulations. The paths of good and evil are clearly divided, yet the deluded crowd rushes toward one way. Those who do good shall receive good retribution; those who do evil shall dwell in evil roots. Past lives and the present—such is the principle."

The Heavenly Lord asked again: "Some people suffer from grave illnesses, their years and lives afflicted, assailed by misfortunes, malevolent ghosts, and demonic harms. What good and beneficial practices can dispel these?"

The reply came: "People do not realize that their bodies are like wind and candlelight, illusory and fleeting. Moment by moment, they follow old habits—how can this last long? They contend for wealth and treasure, benefiting themselves at others' expense, speaking falsely while harboring deceit, indulging in jealousy and resentment. Thus, demons and harms arise, leaving them with nowhere to turn, resulting in untimely injuries and undeserved suffering. Within my domain, there are Four Generals. If one sincerely and secretly recites their texts, there is nothing they cannot respond to."

The Heavenly Lord said: "Who are these Four Generals? I humbly beseech the Merciful Worthy to clearly record their traces."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "In the north, there are Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Zhenwu, who command heavenly soldiers, dispatching generals and officers. In times of urgent peril, one may invoke them with focused intention, and their divine might will descend, arriving as summoned. Their numinous radiance blazes, their killing aura looms vast; demons and ghosts conceal their forms, evil spirits hide in fear. All calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly extinguished."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings, proclaimed the *Four Saints' Divine Incantations for Heavenly Petition, Blessing, Longevity, and Disaster-Purification*.

**Tianpeng Incantation:**
Tianpeng, Tianpeng, Nine Mysteries Killing Lad.
Five Ding Governors, Gao Diao, Northern Elder.
Seven Governances, Eight Numinous Ones, Supreme White Might.
Long-skulled giant beast, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.
White Owl Three Spirits, sternly driving Kui Dragons.
Mighty Sword Spirit King, slaying evil and erasing traces.
Purple qi ascends the heavens, cinnabar clouds surge fiercely.
Devouring demons, consuming ghosts, standing tall to drink the wind.
Azure tongue, green teeth, four-eyed Elder.
Heavenly Ding Warriors, warding off southern ills.
Heavenly Couriers, fierce and swift, bearing northern blades.
Three hundred thousand soldiers, guarding my ninefold layers.
Split corpses for a thousand miles, dispelling misfortune.
Dare any petty ghost approach to witness this?
Heaven-Splitting Great Axe, severing the five forms of ghosts.
Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, Northern Dipper burns bones.
Four Brightnesses shatter remains, Tianyu annihilates kinds.
One stroke of the divine blade, and ten thousand ghosts scatter.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Tianyu Incantation:**
Tianyu, Tianyu, ranked among the feudal lords.
Aiding the Northern Emperor above, overseeing the Nine Provinces below.
Four arms sprouting from his shoulders, three heads growing from his neck.
Clad in golden armor, wielding halberd and spear.
Clouds follow his steps, seas flow with his body.
Crimson light stretches far, purple qi drifts endlessly.
Mighty winds billow, fierce mists howl.
True qi coils and turns, stars and constellations revolve.
A thousand spirits pay homage, the Five Peaks make their rounds.
Golden lads drum and blow, jade maidens sing and chant.
Named in the Golden Portal, stationed to guard Fengdu.
Azure birds and lions, vast seas and jiao dragons.
Three hundred thousand soldiers, following me on my rounds.
Encountering demons, they are slain; meeting ghosts, they are captured.
People suffer misfortune, but curses meet no end.
Descending to bring fortune, sweeping away all worries.
Dare any ignorant petty ghost linger?
One glance from my eyes, and they become eternal prisoners of the springs.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

**Heisha Incantation:**
Northern Black Emperor, Six Jia of the Supreme Subtlety.
Five Emperor Spirit Lords, radiant as sun and moon.
Might shakes heaven and earth, talismans run and registers are seized.
Sealing the Ghost Gate, divine spirits move and qi is spread.
Capturing and removing the Five Pestilences, left and right officers and soldiers.
Three-Five Generals, Thunder Lords and lightning bolts.
Lightning flashes, winds rush, blades and swords fall like rain.
Troops and banners like clouds, grasping the Emperor’s Bell.
Wearing Kunlun on their heads, traversing the distant world.
Hunting and seizing ghosts and spirits, the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces.
Soldiers of blood offerings, none dare resist.
Dare any spread scales? The Star of Pacification binds their hands,
The Northern Dipper seizes their souls.
Three Terraces and Seven Stars, wielding swords to sever bodies.
If crimes are not severely examined, calamities extend to descendants.
Evil spirits and demons, their ears shall not hear.
Those who hear my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,
Crushed to fine dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"

**True Warrior Divine Incantation**

From Qian-Yuan comes the General,
Crowned with the Three Terraces.
Hair unbound in cosmic round,
True Warrior’s majestic power.
Aiding my great Dao,
Tortoise and Serpent merge as one.
Body like a mountain,
Four qi radiant and clear.
Golden light blazing,
Eyes flashing with brilliance.
Teeth like sword-trees,
Hand grasping the Seven Stars.
Heavenly demons and heretics,
Ghosts and malevolent spirits—
Upon seeing me, they turn to blood,
Transformed into purple dust.
The upright qi of the Big Dipper,
This is my true form.
Heavenly talismans manifest,
Greatly safeguarding Heaven and Earth.
The gods of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji rivers,
The Five Peaks’ deities,
City gods and Earth Lords,
All bow and heed my command.
I govern the cosmic order—
Dare any defy or delay?
By the Emperor’s decree,
I rescue and protect all beings.
Should any petty ghost appear,
Seize and bind them for my inspection.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!

The Heavenly Worthy spoke again:
Living beings dwell in an age of the Three Poisons and Ten Evils,
Constantly afflicted by all manner of malevolent spirits,
Evil ghosts and wicked gods,
Venomous creatures and fierce beasts,
Blades and warfare, flood and fire,
Shackles and prisons,
Sickness and suffering—
Each and every one entangles them,
Leaving them unable to find peace.
I once revealed a wondrous Dharma,
Universally delivering all beings,
Bestowing talismanic charts and divine incantations upon those who study the Dao,
And dispatching the Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens throughout the human realm,
To rescue and protect all,
Allowing them to attain natural harmony.

Those who break fasts, violate precepts,
Defy Heaven and betray Earth,
Fail to recognize karmic conditions,
Know not good from evil,
Shun the sacred teachings,
Distance themselves from the immortal lineage,
Gradually succumb to deviant winds,
And follow the currents of affliction—
Openly or secretly, they commit evil,
Indulging body and mind,
Harming living beings.
The Dao of Heaven is not distant,
Like a mirror or still water,
Every detail is revealed without error.
Thus, poisonous winds and evil qi,
The demon ghosts of the Six Heavens,
Pervade the human world,
Spreading slaughter and strife,
Causing injury and death,
Countless each day and night,
Beyond measure.

I have sent the Ten Celestial Kings of the Ten Poles
To descend into the human realm,
Broadly delivering and rescuing all beings,
Ensuring their purity and fortune—
Yet how many truly know this?

From this time forth,
If people devote themselves to the great Dao,
Reverently uphold the true lineage,
Repent their transgressions and pray for blessings,
Avert disasters and extend their lifespan,
Yet find no means of relief—
Or when building new homes,
Breaking ground for construction,
And violating taboo directions—
They should light seven lamps in the central courtyard,
Prepare fresh seasonal fruits,
Burn various fine incense,
Sincerely face north and recite the scripture,
And inscribe the Four Sage Talismans in vermilion,
Posting them at the four corners of their dwelling.
Thus shall they obtain good fortune,
As the Four Heavenly Emperors and Four Sage Marshals descend to protect them.

This wondrous scripture subdues all that is besought,
Grants all that is sought,
Conveys all that is presented,
And fulfills all that is petitioned.

The Four Sage Perfected Lords respond to the title *True Talisman*:
**First:** The Great Marshal Tianpeng of the Northern Pole,
Prolongs fortune, dispels misfortune,
Preserves life and destiny.
**Second:** The Vice Marshal Tianyou of the Northern Pole,
Prolongs fortune, dispels misfortune,
Nurtures life and destiny.
**Third:** The Perfected Lord of Stored Blessings and Preserved Virtue,
Prolongs fortune, dispels misfortune,
Safeguards life and destiny.
**Fourth:** The Perfected Lord of Assisted Sagehood and True Warrior Emperor,
Prolongs fortune, dispels misfortune,
Brings peace and harmony to life and destiny.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
The merit of these Four Sage Names and Incantations is immense.
When encountering yearly disasters or monthly misfortunes,
Face north, burn incense,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
All shall dissipate.
If afflicted by frequent illness,
Uncured by medicine,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, all shall be purified.
When locusts cause harm,
Or drought and flood bring disaster,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, all shall be pacified.
When misfortunes entangle,
Unable to be resolved,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, all shall be purified and fortunate.
When evil spirits or malevolent forces
Cause harm and injury,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, all shall be driven away.
When dwellings are unsettled,
Wealth and possessions dissipate,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, all shall be peaceful and prosperous.
When imprisoned,
Suffering harsh punishments,
Face north,
Focus the spirit and calm the mind,
Sincerely pay homage and recite—
Naturally, the celestial immortals’ soldiers and horses,
The Four Sage Generals,
Shall protect their body.

This scripture is the hidden text of my lineage,
The profound canon of the Celestial Emperor.
On one’s natal day,
Or during fast days,
Purify body and mind,
Whether for parents,
Siblings,
Oneself,
Or kin,
Either recite it oneself,
Or invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests—
Three, five, seven,
Or up to forty-nine—
To sincerely recite it before the sages.
Then shall spirit youths, divine warriors,
Mighty generals, and the northern legions
Act according to one’s wishes,
Responding to sincerity.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the *Four Sage General Incantation*:

In the North there is a General,
The divine honored one of the Emperor.
Hair unbound, wielding a sword,
Master of the four directions.
Heaven above, Earth below,
All are made to know his command.
Blades like rain,
Weapons radiant with light.
Encounter demons, slay them;
See the good, bid them return.
When facing calamity,
Sincerely recite and uphold.
Flying spears, hurled fire,
Ascend to the Purple Tenuity.
In the palace of life and destiny,
Misfortune follows—
Swiftly turn peril to fortune,
Sun and moon aligned.
Recite now,
And obtain compassion.
The Three-Five Generals,
Protect my body.
Golden light shimmering,
Thunder crashing.
Those who oppose me die,
Those who avoid me live.
Household and kin,
All preserved in purity and peace.
The Big Dipper and Stars of Merit,
Three hundred thousand soldiers.
Venomous dragons and fierce beasts,
Golden essence of the vast sea.
Greedy Wolf, Great Gate,
Wealth Star, Literary Curve,
Martial Curve, Integrity—
Left Assistant, Right Supporter,
Slaying evil, breaking armies.
True light swiftly arrives,
Ten thousand ghosts conceal their forms.

Swiftly gather, swiftly gather—delay not!
With all doors blessed and prosperous,
Ascend into the formless.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Primordial August Emperor!*

The Vermilion Four Saints’ Talisman, inscribed on yellow paper,
When worn, knows no failure in efficacy.

The Dao declares: The Four Saintly Marshals eternally guard beneath the Jade Emperor,
Commanding the demonic and wayward of the Three Realms.
Each year they descend to the mortal world,
Observing human goodness,
Bestowing prosperity and fortune,
Preserving the imperial throne,
Sheltering the lost,
Severing the roots of evil,
And extending life and official rank.

Should mortals devote themselves with reverence,
Purifying body and mind in ritual recitation—
Once recited, the body is refined;
Twice recited, purity and peace are attained;
Thrice recited, harmony within and without;
Four times, divine soldiers stand guard;
Five times, demons and ghosts flee afar;
Six times, all illness and suffering cease;
Seven times, the true light is beheld;
A hundred times, the Three Realms offer protection;
A thousand times, eternal felicity is witnessed;
Ten thousand times, the body dwells in the celestial palace,
Merging with the Dao as one.

This text is the path of cultivation,
The ladder to spiritual ascent.
Within, it preserves and refines the true self;
Without, it dispels karmic hindrances.
In stillness, observe stillness—
Mystery within mystery.

Thereupon, the immortals and sages of the heavens,
Hearing these wondrous teachings,
Obtained the true scripture,
Leaping with joy beyond measure.

The Heavenly Lords advanced, bowed in reverence,
Offering thanks to the Heavenly Worthy with this hymn of praise:
*"The Dao, august and primordial,
Nurtures all heavens.
Originally tranquil, originally still—
Thus are sages and immortals born.
Embracing yellow, circling purple,
Emerging from azure, entering the profound.
The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion,
Reveals the true scripture.
Subtle principles, beyond sound and form—
Above, the Kun; below, the Qian.
Uncarved, unhewn,
Impartial, unbiased.
Embody and enact it,
And the body ascends the great kalpa.
The primal qi governs myriad transformations,
Wielding the pivot of destiny.
Unobstructed, free from hindrance,
Abiding in perfect clarity.
Now, receiving this sacred text,
The words of the exalted sages—
Those who awaken to it
Shall endure through endless eons,
Lifespan vast and distant,
Fortune and rank enduring.
Dwelling in purity,
Forever advancing toward the Dao."*

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the immortals of the heavens:
*"We vow to disseminate this scripture.
Should one recite it with sincere devotion,
Disasters shall vanish, blessings descend,
Eternal protection from the immortals,
Descendants unbroken,
Generation after generation,
Beholding the Heavenly Worthy and the sages expounding the scriptures."*

Having received the wondrous Dharma,
They turned their chariots, mounted cranes,
Phoenix carriages and cloud-borne palanquins,
Bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy,
And departed.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Four Saints of the Nine Heavens for Prolonging Fortune and Dispelling Calamity* concludes.
